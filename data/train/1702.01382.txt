    "long duration gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are thought to be caused by a core - collapse of massive star ( woosley 1993 ; paczyski 1998 ) , which is also supported by several lines of observational evidence .",
    "( 1 ) a handful of long grbs are associated with type ic supernovae ( galama et al .",
    "1998 ; stanek et al . 2003",
    "; woosley & bloom 2006 ) . ( 2 ) the host galaxies of long grbs are in intense star formation galaxies ( fruchter et al .",
    "2006 ) . following the collapse ,",
    "a black hole or magnetar central engine is formed and it powers a ultra - relativistic jet ( usov 1992 ; thompson 1994 ; dai & lu 1998 ; popham et al .",
    "1999 ; narayan et al . 2001",
    "; lei et al . 2013 ; l & zhang 2014 ) .",
    "numerical simulations show that a relativistic jet can be launched successfully , and it breaks out the stellar envelope of the progenitor star ( macfadyen & woosley 1999 ; zhang et al .",
    "2003 ; morsony et al .",
    "2007 ; mizuta & ioka 2013 ; geng et al .",
    "2016 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if the mass density of collimated outflow is less than that of the stellar envelope .",
    "a @xmath5cocoon@xmath6 component is an inevitable product when the jet propagate within the stellar envelope ( ramirez - ruiz et al .",
    "2002 ; lazzati & begelman 2010 ; nakar & piran 2017 ) .",
    "the wasted energy of jet is recycled into a high pressure cocoon surrounding the relativistic jet ( ramirez - ruiz et al .",
    "2002 ; lazzati & begelman 2005 ) .",
    "the gained energy of cocoon is comparable with that released energy of observed grb .",
    "so that , the emission from the cocoon has been invoked to be as explanation of the thermal emission of grbs ( fan et al .",
    "2006 ; ghisellini et al . 2007 ;",
    "piro et al .",
    "2014 ) , or the precursors emission and the steep decay in the early x - ray afterglow of grbs ( ramirez - ruiz et al . 2002 ; peer et al . 2006 ; lazzati et al .",
    "theoretically , ramirez - ruiz et al . (",
    "2002 ) proposed that a @xmath7-ray and x - ray transients with a short duration may be produced from the cocoon emission .",
    "lazzati et al.(2010 ) suggested that the transients may be seen similar to a short grb by an observer at wide angles .",
    "nakar & piran ( 2017 ) proposed that a possible signatures ( @xmath7-ray , x - ray and optical ) of the cocoon emission may be detected , but it is strongly dependence on the level of mixing between shocked jet cocoon and shocked stellar cocoon . in any case , the cocoon emission was also expected that it has a thermal component of observed spectrum in above models ( ramirez - ruiz et al .",
    "2002 ; lazzati & begelman 2005 ) .",
    "after the jet breaks out the star envelope , the outflow of relativistic jet produces the prompt @xmath7-ray emission getting through the internal shocks or magnetic dissipation when it become optically thin ( mszros & rees 1993 ; piran et al .",
    "1993 ; rees & mszros 1994 ; zhang & yan 2011 ) . within the matter - dominated fireball scenario ,",
    "it was expected that an observed grb spectrum should be composed of a thermal component from the photosphere emission and a non - thermal component from the synchrotron radiations of relativistic electrons in the internal shock regions ( mszros & rees 2000 ; rees & mszros 2005 ; peer et al .",
    "2006 ; giannios 2008 ; beloborodov 2010 ; lazzati & begelman 2010 ) .",
    "therefore , a bright black body component should be detectable .",
    "after that , a multi - wavelength afterglow emission is produced when the fireball ( outflow ) propagates into the circum medium ( mszros & rees 1997 ; sari et al .",
    "1998 ; zhang & kobayashi 2005 ; fan & piran 2006 ; gao et al . 2013 ) .    from observational point of view",
    ", only 10% grbs have a precursor emission component , and the spectra properties of precursors and main outbursts do not show any statistical difference ( troja et al .",
    "2010 ; hu et al .",
    "2014 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the grbs with precursors are not substantial difference from the other grbs without precursors ( troja et al .",
    "2010 ; hu et al .",
    "those results suggested that the precursor would be the same emission component with the fireball .",
    "recently , an extremely bright grb 160625b was detected by _",
    "gamma - ray burst monitor ( gbm ) and large area telescope ( lat ) , and measured redshift @xmath8 ( xu et al .",
    "its prompt @xmath7-ray lightcurve is composed of three episodes : a short precursor , a very bright main emission episode , and a weak emission episode .",
    "the three episodes emission are separated by two long quiescent intervals ( zhang et al . 2016 ) .",
    "interestingly , zhang et al .",
    "( 2016 ) found that a pure thermal spectral component and non - thermal spectrum ( known as band function ; band et al .",
    "1993 ) are existed in the precursor and main emission episodes , respectively .",
    "they suggested that the thermal component is from the photosphere emission of a fireball , and non - thermal component is from a poynting - flux - dominated outflow .",
    "however , it is inconceivable that the transition from fireball to poynting - flux - dominated jet lasts that long quiescent stage . in this paper , by reanalysing the multi - wavelength data of grb 160625b , we propose that the precursor and main emission may be origin from different physics process , i.e. , cocoon emission surrounding a jet and relativistic jet .",
    "then , we also explore its long term evolution of ejecta .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : the data reduction and data analysis are presented in  2 and  3 . in  4 , we derive the ejecta properties from the data .",
    "conclusions and discussion are reported in  5 and  6 .",

    "grb 160625b triggered the _ fermi_/gbm at 22:40:16.28 ut on 25 june 2016 ( @xmath10 ) for the first time ( burns 2016 ) .",

    "we download the gbm and lat data of grb 160625b from the public science support center at the official _ fermi _ web site .",
    "gbm has 12 sodium iodide ( nai ) detectors covering an energy range from 8 kev to 1 mev , and two bismuth germanate ( bgo ) scintillation detectors sensitive to higher energies between 200 kev and 40 mev ( meegan et al .",

    "the first episode lasts about one second ( episode i ) .",
    "the inset in the top panel of figure [ promptlc ] shows the lightcurve in 64 ms time - bin .",
    "one can find that it is a single pulse with rapidly rising and decaying .",
    "it was not detected with gbm - bgo and lat .",
    "the source was in a quiescent stage with a duration of about 180 seconds without detection of any gamma - rays in the gbm and lat bands .",
    "an extremely bright gamma - ray outburst with multiple peaks ( episode ii ) triggered fermi - lat and were also observed with gbm and even in the optical band since @xmath15 seconds .",
    "the source was in quiescent again and triggered gbm at @xmath16 seconds .",
    "the emission in this episode ( episode iii ) was detected with gbm - nai detector and lat .",
    "the lightcurve of this episode features as a long - lasting , low flux - level episode , similar to the extended emission ( ee ) component ( e.g. , hu et al . 2014 ) .",
    "its duration is 372 seconds .",
    "therefore , grb 160625b experiences a short precursor , a main burst , and a long - lasting extended emission stages .",
    "the initial three data points of the v band lightcurve of the optical flare observed during the episode ii with the mini - mega tortora system is very spike .",
    "it rapidly increases to the peak brightness ( @xmath17 magnitude ) at @xmath18 seconds with a slope of @xmath19 , then drops with a slope of @xmath20 after the peak .",

    "we jointly analyze the spectra observed with different detectors / telescopes for the three emission episodes of the prompt gamma - rays .",
    "we do not make the spectral fit with the empirical band function ( band et al .",
    "1993 ) , but use an empirical model motivated by the standard fireball models . in general , a single black body is invoked to describe the photosphere emission ( rees & mszros 2005 ; peer et al . 2006 ; giannios 2008 ; beloborodov 2010 ; wang et al . 2016 ) .",
    "in fact , it should be contributed by superposition of various black body radiation , namely , a multi - color black body ( mbb ) is more convinced ( e.g. , ryde et al .",
    "2010 ; lazzati & begelman 2010 ; peer & ryde 2011 ; lundman et al .",
    "2013 ) . in the framework of the fireball model , the observed spectrum of prompt gamma - rays should be composed of an mbb component from the photosphere emission and a non - thermal emission component from the optically thin internal shock region ( e.g. , mszros & rees 2000 ) .",

    "we show the model curves derived from our fit for the spectrum observed in the time slice [ 195 - 205 ] seconds in comparison with the peak optical flux in figure [ spec_eii_opt ] . here , the optical data is corrected by the extinction of the milk way galaxy ( @xmath41 ) , but is not corrected for the extinction by the grb host galaxy due to uncertainly extinction curves .",
    "it is found that the optical flux is higher than the model result with a factor of 3 .",

    "three well separated emission episodes observed in grb 160625b have distinct spectral properties .",
    "this may shed light on the evolution of the outflow and even the activity of the grb central engine . in this section ,",
    "we discuss possible physical origins of these distinct emission episodes and implications for the central engine of grb 160625b .",
    "episode i is a short precursor with following long quiescent stage .",
    "hu et al . (",
    "2014 ) made an analysis for a large sample of grb lightcurves observed with _",
    "burst alert telescope ( bat ) in order to search for the possible precursor emission prior to the main outbursts .",
    "they found that about 10% long grbs have a precursor emission component .",
    "most of precursors show as continuous fluctuations with low flux level .",
    "being due to the narrowness of the bat band , they fitted the spectra of both the precursors and the main outbursts .",
    "they found that their photon indices do not show any statistical difference and suggested that the precursor would be the same emission component from the fireball ( see also lazzati , 2005 ; burlon et al .",
    "the emission of episode i of grb 160625b is dramatically different from these precursors .",
    "its spectrum is well fitted with a mbb model .",
    "in addition , it is very short and bright . figure [ hrt90](a ) compares episode i of grb 160625b with precursors of some _ swift _ grbs in the plane of the hardness ratio ( hr ) vs. the duration of the precursors @xmath106 , where hr is the ratio of photon fluxes between the 50 - 100 kev and 15 - 150 kev bands .",
    "it is found that the emission of episode i is significantly harder than that of the _ swift _ grbs .",
    "the peak fluxes of the precursors of these _ swift _ grbs are also tightly corrected with that of the main outbursts , but the emission in episode i deviates this correlation , as shown in figure [ hrt90](b ) .",
    "the peak flux of episode i of grb 160625b is much brighter than other _",
    "swift _ grbs . after the end of episode",
    "i , no signal was detected by gbm and lat until the episode ii comes .",
    "although tail emission of episode i may be detectable with _ swift_/xrt as usually seen in some grbs ( e.g. , peng et al .",
    "2014 ) , the rapid cease of this episode and a long quiescent stage may indicate the rapid close of this emission channel .",
    "therefore , the physical origin of emission in episode i may hold the key to reveal the evolution of the grb jet .",
    "several models were proposed to interpret the precursor emission of grbs ( lyutikov & usov 2000 ; ramirez - ruiz et al .",
    "2002 ; wang & mszros 2007 ; bernardini et al 2013 ) .",
    "it is believed that long grbs are a relativistic fireball from collapses of massive stars .",
    "lyutikov & usov ( 2000 ) suggested that a weak precursor may attribute to the photosphere emission of the grb fireball when it becomes transparent . in this scenario ,",
    "spectrum of the precursor should be thermal or quasi - thermal .",
    "our spectral analysis indicates that the spectrum of episode i indeed can be fitted with the mbb model . in this scenario ,",
    "our results likely suggest that the grb fireball experienced an acceleration stage from episode i to epsode ii when the fireball was expanded .",
    "however , the short duration of episode i and long quiescent stage after episode i are difficult to be explained with this scenario since the photosphere emission could not be rapidly shut up when the fireball is transparent .",
    "ramirez - ruiz et al . ( 2002 ) suggested that a cocoon surrounding a relativistic jet may be formed when the jet breaks out of the progenitor envelope .",
    "they assumed that the cocoon has the same lorentz factor as the grb jet and discussed possible photospheric `` cooling emission '' from the cocoon .",
    "this emission component may produce gamma - ray and x - ray transients with a short duration since this channel should be rapidly closed due to the drop of pressure .",
    "lazzati et al.(2010 ) investigated the cocoon evolution and suggested that the transients may be seen similar to a short grb by an observer at 45@xmath107 .",
    "more recently , nakar & piran ( 2017 ) explored the possible signatures of the cocoon emission .",
    "they showed that the cocoon signature depends strongly on the level of mixing between the shocked jet and shocked stellar material . in case of no mixing at all , bright gamma - ray emission with a duration of seconds from the cocoon",
    "can be detectable with current missions , such as _ swift _ and _ fermi_. non - detection of such an emission component in most grbs implies that indicates that such kind of mixing must take place .",
    "the spectrum and duration of emission in episode i of grb 1600625b seem to be consistent with the case of no mixing at all .",
    "this makes this grb very valuable for revealing the progenitor and jet of this grb ( nakar & piran 2017 ) .",
    "our time - resolved spectral analysis for the emission in episode ii shows that the spectra are well fitted with the mbb+cpl model .",
    "l et al . ( 2017 ) present a systematical spectral fit for 37 bright grbs simultaneously observed with gbm and lat by invoking the mbb+cpl or mbb+pl models .",
    "they show that the spectra of 32 grbs can be fitted with the mbb+cpl model , and the spectra of other 5 grbs are adequately fitted with the mbb+pl model .",
    "therefore , the gamma - ray emission of episode ii should be resemble typical lat grbs .",
    "a bright optical flare was simultaneously detected in the episode ii . based on our theoretically modeling with the forward and",
    "reverse shock models for the optical and x - ray data as shown in figure [ spec_eii_opt ] , one can find that this flare is shaped by both the prompt optical emission and reverse shock emission , similar to that observed in grb 140512a ( huang et al .",
    "2016 ) . by subtracting the contribution of the reversed shock emission ,",
    "the optical flux at the peak time is scaled down a little bit to that extrapolated from the fitting result of the gamma - ray emission - ray to optical band .",
    "another one may have different radiation mechanisms between @xmath7-ray and optical emission ] .",
    "with the derived isotropic kinetic energy from our modeling for the afterglow data and the observed gamma - ray energy of episode ii , we also calculate the grb radiation efficiency with @xmath108 and obtain @xmath109 .",

    ", one can observe that the emission of this episode is clearly detected with gbm - nai and lat .",
