    "recently it was demonstrated that cosmological apparent horizons are also endowed with thermodynamical properties , formally identical to those of event horizons @xcite .",
    "the connection between gravity and thermodynamics was reinforced by jacobson , who associated einstein equations with clausius relation @xcite , and later on by padmanabhan who linked the macroscopic description of spacetime , given by einstein equations , to microscopic degrees of freedom , @xmath4 , through the principle of equipartition of energy , i.e. , @xmath5 in particular , padmanabhan , starting from the field equations arrived to the equipartition law @xcite and indicated how to obtain the field equations of any diffeormorphism invariant theory of gravity from an entropy extremising principle @xcite , the entropy of spacetime being proportional to @xmath4 .",

    "+ for the connection between horizons and thermodynamics to hold , these quantum entropy corrections must translate into modifications of the field equations of gravity , see e.g. @xcite . in any sensible cosmological context",
    "these modifications must fulfill the generalized second law ( gsl ) of thermodynamics .",
    "the latter asserts that the entropy of the horizon plus the entropy of its surroundings must not decrease in time .",
    "as demonstrated by bekenstein , this law is satisfied by black holes in contact with their radiation @xcite .    the aim of this paper is to see whether the modified friedmann equations coming from logarithmic corrections and from power - law corrections , in conjunction with clausisus relation or the equipartition principle , are compatible with the generalized second law",

    "this section investigates whether by relaxing the dominant energy condition ( dec ) or by allowing particle production , the range of values of @xmath8 compatible with the gsl gets wider .",
    "the above analysis shows that this may be the case but there are regions where the gsl is still violated so long as ghost fields are excluded . in figs .",
    "[ fig : inequality1][fig : inequality4 ] these regions are explicitly marked .",
    "we begin with the logarithmic corrections to the horizon entropy .",
    "first we note that an equivalent rewriting of the entropy rate in eq.([entropyrate ] ) , for both eq.([flog1 ] ) and eq.([flog2 ] ) , is @xmath87 then , for non - superaccelerated expansion @xmath88 , the gsl will be fulfilled if @xmath89 .",
    "this means that we the line @xmath62 should not be crossed if a meaningful description of the expansion is required .",
    "+ nevertheless , we can focus on the positive range of the @xmath8 parameter in case of equipartition of energy that , as inspection of fig.[fig : inequality1 ] reveals , can be enlarged from the minimum of the dashed curve , @xmath90 , to the minimum of the dot - dashed curve , @xmath91 , by allowing the fluid to be phantom during the evolution .",
    "these positive values of @xmath8 may be seem too big , but they are not inconsistent with quantum calculations @xcite .",
    "+ let us note that , at present , @xmath92 .",
    "this means that the phantom phase lies far in the past .",
    "could it give rise to a `` reasonable '' inflation ?",
    "the first thing to check is whether there are accelerated phases in this modified theory of gravity ( because of quantum corrections proportional to @xmath8 ) . introducing the parameter @xmath93 appearing in the equation of state , @xmath94 , in the phantom region , when @xmath95 and @xmath96 , positive values of @xmath8 are compatible with acceleration @xmath97 provided that the inequality @xmath98 is fulfilled .",
    "then , an inflationary period can be obtained for @xmath99 ; the latter bound corresponds to the minimum of the dot - dashed curve in fig.[fig : inequality1 ] .",
    "+ for this early inflation to be successful in solving the problems of the standard big - bang model it must yield a sufficient number of e - folds , @xmath100 . bearing in mind eqs.([h ] ) and ( [ hdot ] ) we get @xmath101 the question now reduces to finding an appropriate expression for @xmath102 such that the field can be phantom for a period that gives a suitable number of e - folds , with the initial and final values of the phantom period being the intersection of the line of a given @xmath8 with the appropriate curve in fig.[fig : inequality1 ] .",
    "+ in the case of logarithmic entropy correction and equipartition of energy , eq.([e - folds ] ) can be analytically integrated to give a constant value of @xmath93 .",
    "for example , for @xmath103 , one has , @xmath104 although this is just a rough estimate it makes clear that , given an evolution for the equation of state parameter , it suffices that it slightly crosses the phantom divide - line to get a convenient amount of inflation .    in the case of power - law entropy corrections , allowing for a phantom field may enlarge the range of the @xmath8 parameter towards negative values , but a deeper analysis of the evolution equation shows that the requirement that the gsl is fulfilled forces the hubble parameter and the dimensionless variable we have defined , not to cross the curve @xmath105 of fig.[fig : inequality4 ] . in fact , the entropy rate can be written as @xmath106 \\dot{x } x,\\ ] ] hence in the region above that curve @xmath107 must be negative , and in the region below , positive ( @xmath52 and @xmath108 ) .",
    "+ actually this depends on the choice of the crossover scale @xmath39 that we have identified as @xmath73 .",
    "nevertheless , if this also depends on the parameter @xmath8 , through a factor , the whole negative region can correspond to a meaningful expansion , with @xmath52 and @xmath48 ; while all non accessible regions shifting to the positive sector , with a wider range in case the clausius relation to be used .",
    "+ thus , the results strictly depend on the explicit choice of the crossover scale , once assumed its order of magnitude is about @xmath73 ; but it seems that the negative region is accessible , provided a redefinition of the scale is made , while the positive part remains largely determined by the power - law dependence .",
    "as is well known , on a phenomenological level particle production can be described in terms of an effective bulk viscosity @xmath109 , with @xmath110 the coefficient of bulk viscosity @xcite .",
    "thus the total pressure is @xmath111 where @xmath94 , denotes the equilibrium pressure . in the case of a isentropic particle production",
    "there exists a general relation between the viscous coefficient and the particle production rate @xcite . in this effective picture ,",

    "likewise , the entropy rate acquires a new term entirely due to the increase in the number of particles : @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the @xmath115-spatial volume enclosed by the horizon , @xmath116 . as before ,",
    "the fluid is assumed in thermal equilibrium with the horizon ( see eq.([temperature ] ) ) .",
    "+ by using eqs.([entropyrate ] ) and ( [ fluidrate ] ) , the total entropy rate is @xmath117.\\ ] ] the first term , with particle creation , can allow some region to be reached , in the sense that gsl can hold with a non - phantom fluid .",
    "inspection of figs.[fig : inequality1 ] and [ fig : inequality2 ] shows that in case of logarithmic entropy corrections , the @xmath8 negative range from @xmath118 to @xmath119 could be accessible .",
    "in fact , in this region the field is non - ghost and it was discarded not to have a superaccelerating evolution so long as @xmath120 .",
    "moreover , @xmath121 often appears in the literature @xcite    now , because of effective viscosity , a positive term has been included in the entropy rate .",

    "we analyzed two entropy - area terms , logarithmic ( [ log ] ) , and power - law corrections ( [ power ] ) , the former coming from loop quantum gravity , the latter from the entanglement of quantum fields .",
    "both quantum corrections have been widely investigated but , since they come from very different techniques , one should not be surprised that total agreement on these corrections is still missing . in particular , there is a lack of consensus on the value of the constant parameter @xmath8 .",
