    "in recent years , a series of young stellar kinematic groups ( clusters , associations , and moving groups ) of late - type stars with similar space motion and ages ranging from 8 to 50 myr ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) has been discovered in our neighbourhood : tw  hya , @xmath0  pic , ab  dor , @xmath1  cha , @xmath2  cha , tucana and horologium associations .",
    "in addition , several more distant young associations such as mbm  12 @xcite , corona australis @xcite , and possibly the group of stars with a motion similar to that of hd  141569 @xcite have also been identified . in the galactic velocity space , they situate inside the boundaries of the ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : uv ] ) , a mixture of young stellar complexes   ob and t - associations   and clusters with different ages @xcite . these associations of very young stars are excellent laboratories for investigations of forming planetary systems @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , they are generally situated at distances above 50 pc , which makes them less accessible to adaptive optics systems even on large telescopes .",
    "it is well - known that tightly bound , long - lived open clusters can account for only a few per cent of the total galactic star formation rate @xcite .",
    "therefore , either most clusters and associations disperse very quickly after star formation has started or most are born in isolation @xcite .",
    "the existence of very young moving groups ( mgs ) with a few dozens of stars showing the same spectroscopic properties   i.e. age , metallicity , level of magnetic activity   is in agreement with the first explanation .",
    "small associations of stars may be dispersed by galactic differential rotation since they are not gravitationally bounded enough , taking into account that their nucleus consist of only a few stars as in the case of the ursa major mg ( see king et al .",
    "2003 , for a recent review ) or the recently discovered ab  doradus mg @xcite .",
    "the location of these young mgs inside the local association and its proximity in the @xmath3-plane can be explained as the result of the juxtaposition of several star forming bursts in adjacent cells of the velocity field ( see montes et al .",
    "2001 , and references therein ) or dynamical perturbations caused by spiral waves @xcite .",
    "thus , one expects to find groups of coeval stars with similar space motion in our neighbourhood . in 2001 , the @xmath0  pic  mg @xcite  a group of stars with an age of @xmath4  12  myr @xcite at a mean distance of @xmath4  35  pc co - moving with the well - known young star @xmath0  pic  was confirmed to be the closest kinematic group up to date .",
    "more recently , @xcite have identified a new group of stars co - moving with the also well - known young star ab  dor , at a mean distance of @xmath4  30  pc , and with an age of @xmath4  50  myr .",
    "nevertheless , the existence of a nearer association of a few stars was proposed by @xcite and studied in detail by @xcite , though its existence is quite controversial . here",
    "we discuss about the fact of the nearest mgs using both spectroscopic and photometric criteria of membership for a sample of stars that includes the proposed members from the literature and our list of young cool stars possible members of young stellar kinematic groups @xcite .",
    "based on the kinematics of young solar analogues in the solar neighbourhood , @xcite confirmed the existence of a group of four stars ( marked with @xmath5 in table  [ tab : mgs ] ) co - moving in the space towards the constellation of hercules .",
    "recently , @xcite has extended the sample of late - type stars of this mg up to 15 nearby ( d  @xmath6  25  pc ) candidates , proposing the name hercules - lyra since several members show a radiant `` _ evenly matched _ '' with this constellation . comparing the level of chromospheric activity of the stars of his sample with that of the members of the ursa major association and looking for the existence of lithium in their spectrum , he notices that several candidates of hercules - lyra appear to be coeval of the ursa major stars , for which he gives an age of @xmath4  200  myr . on the contrary ,",
    "other candidates seem to be older ( e.g. hd  111395 ) or younger ( hd  17925 , hd  82443 , and hd  113449 ) , questioning the existence of hercules - lyra as an entity independent of the local association .",
    "however , he considers unlikely that the majority of his sample can originate from the pleiades alone , or other clusters of the local association since `` _ they are poorer and more distant _ '' as pointed out by @xcite .",
    "thus , he confirms `` _ the bulk _ '' of the sample  formed by the stars hd  166 , hd  96064 , hd  97334 , hd  116956 , hd  139777 , hd  139813 and hd  141272 ( see his table  1 )  to be an entity on its own .",
    "here we discuss the possible existence of the hercules - lyra mg as an independent association using kinematic ( space motion ) , spectroscopic ( lithium abundance ) and photometric ( isochrone fitting ) criteria .",
    "a total of 12 possible members ( stars marked with _ a _ in table  [ tab : mgs ] ) have been added to the initial sample of @xcite from our catalogue of _ late - type stars possible members of young stellar kinematic groups _ @xcite .",
    "the candidates have been chosen by their kinematics assuming a total dispersion of in @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively ; that is , an average position of km  s@xmath9 has been determined using the stars given by @xcite , and every star in our catalogue in a radius of has been selected .",
    "the value of the dispersion has been chosen equal to that of the old castor  mg @xcite , coeval of the hercules - lyra association .",
    "no restriction in the @xmath10 component has been imposed in this first selection .    in table",
    "[ tab : mgs ] we summarize the results obtained by us . from the whole sample of 27 candidates ,",
    "eight stars have been discarded as members by their space motion : hd  25457 , located inside the b4 subgroup ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : uv ] ) ; hd  96064 , hd  112733 , hip  67092 , the binary system made up of the f - type star hd  139777 and hd  139813 , and hd  207129 all them with a value in @xmath10 higher than that of the rest of the candidates ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : uvw_mgs ] ) ; and hd  113449 , classified as member of the ab  dor  mg by @xcite ( see table  [ tab : mgs ] and @xmath11  [ sec : abdor ] for a more detailed discussion ) and questioned by @xcite because of its relatively high lithium abundance .",
    "we have also studied the lithium abundance  measured as the equivalent width of the lithium line @xmath126707.8   , @xmath13(li  i )  in each one of the candidates .",
    "the values of @xmath13(li  i ) have been taken from @xcite and compared with those of the members of well - known stellar clusters ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : li_mgs ] ) .",
    "the results appear to be consistent with an age of for seven candidates .",
    "however , several stars ( hd  1466 , hd  17295 , , and hd  82443 ) show an @xmath13(li  i ) comparable to that of the members of the pleiades while other five ( hd  37394 , hd  97334b , hd  111395 , hd  116956 and hd  141272 ) are fully depleted or have a value lower than the expected for a member of the hercules - lyra association . for isochrone",
    "fitting , we have adopted pre - main sequence models from @xcite . for @xmath14",
    "k , the models systematically underestimate the age when comparing with clusters of known age such as the pleiades and ic  2391 in a @xmath15 vs. @xmath16 diagram @xcite due to the transformation from flux to colour . bearing this in mind",
    ", the corrected transformation adopted by @xcite and @xcite for stars cooler than 4000  k has been used in this work .",
    "the values of @xmath16 have been taken from the hypparcos catalogue @xcite .",
    "the result of comparing the position of the stars with the isochrones in the colour - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vi ] ) is again in agreement with and age of .",
    "nevertheless , no conclusions can be inferred from the cmd alone since isochrones of more than 80  myr converge for @xmath17 mag . , and ages larger than 300 myr could be adopted .    from the combination of the three criteria ,",
    "the total sample of candidates is reduced to 10 stars with @xmath13(li  i ) and position in the cmd compatibles with an age of , which could form the bulk of the hercules - lyra association , and other 15 definitively non members or with a doubtful classification ( table  [ tab : mgs ] ) .",
    "the members show a deviation from the centre ( ) lower than that of other coeval mgs such as castor and ursa major ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . a similar dispersion ( )",
    "is found in w , confirming the results in @xmath7 and @xmath8 . in the same way ,",
    "the shape of the mg in the velocity field is in agreement with the theory of the mgs @xcite . according to this theory , not - gravitational bounded stars formed in the same forming region and with low sigmas in @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath10",
    "are dispersed during their rotation around the galactic centre , inducing a particular shape in both the space and the velocity field since some of the stars fall behind while others go ahead .",
    "the galactic potential maintains the group bounded during several hundreds of years , in spite of the initial velocity dispersion in the molecular cloud , in both the @xmath3-plane and the @xmath10 component .",
    "very recently , @xcite have identified a large group of stars with the same space motion than the well - known young k - dwarf ab  dor ( d = 15  pc ) , a quadruple system @xcite made up of three late - type stars  ab  dor  a ( hd  36705 ) , ab  dor  ba and ab  dor  bb  and a very low mass companion which has recently been object of discussion because of the discrepancy between its dynamical mass and that predicted by evolutionary models @xcite .",
    "all the stars listed in table  1 of @xcite are situated inside the local association ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : uv ] ) near the boundaries of the young disk stellar population @xcite , and have at least one indicator of youth . taking the intensity of the h@xmath18 emission line of these stars and the position in a @xmath19 diagram of three m - type members of the mg into account",
    ", they estimate an age of @xmath20 myr for the ab  dor mg .",
    "very recently , @xcite and @xcite have showed that the components of ab  dor should have an age of 75  150 myr based on the comparison of both their position in the @xmath21 vs. @xmath19 diagram with respect to the pleiades and ic  2391 clusters , and the @xmath13(li  i ) of ab  dor  a with that of rapidly rotating k dwarfs in the pleiades . moreover , with an age of @xmath4  100 myr the discrepancy between observations and models for the very low - mass companion ( ab  dor  c ) would disappear ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "taking this into account , they propose an age range of 75  150 myr for all the mg .    to the initial sample of @xcite",
    ", we have added 13 stars ( marked with _",
    "b _ in table  [ tab : mgs ] ) from our catalogue of _ late - type stars possible members of young stellar kinematic groups _ @xcite .",
    "these stars have been included to both searches : a ) for other members of the group and b ) to show the existence of two subgroups of different ages more clearly .",
    "they have been chosen because of their kinematics , assuming a total dispersion of in @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively , around the centre of the ab  dor  mg defined by @xcite .",
    "we have imposed no restriction to the @xmath10 component for this first selection .",
    "the whole sample contains a total of 50 stars .",
    "we have compared the @xmath13(li  i ) of every star in the sample with that of known members of young open clusters ( fig .",
    "[ fig : li_mgs ] ) , as well as their position in the @xmath16 diagram with the isochrones of @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vi ] ) .",
    "the results reveal the existence of two subgroups with stars showing different spectroscopic and photometric features , mixed in the velocity field ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : uvw_mgs ] ) .",
    "the members of the first subgroup , that includes ab  dor and pw  and  a very active young k2-dwarf @xcite  show @xmath13(li  i ) similar to that of the high - rotators in the pleiades ( upper continuous line in fig .",
    "[ fig : li_mgs ] ) which are above the values found in the low - rotators of ic  2602 ( lower dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : li_mgs ] ) .",
    "their position between the 30 and the 80 myr isochrones in the @xmath16 diagram , together with the first result , is compatible with an age of 30 - 50  myr .",
    "moreover , the stars from the sample of @xcite belonging to this subgroup are situated above the sequence of the pleiades in the @xmath21 vs. @xmath19 diagram in @xcite . here",
    "we have obtained a dispersion @xmath22 km  s@xmath9 in the w component , quite similar to the one observed in other young stellar associations such as tucana or @xmath2  cha ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . for determining the dispersion",
    "we have rejected the stars bd+07  1919a and b ( marked with * in table  [ tab : mgs ] ) since their radial velocities  used for calculating the galactic velocity components  have not been corrected for binarity since no orbital solution has been found in the literature . nevertheless ,",
    "although the membership of this system is not completely reliable taking the value of their @xmath10 component into account , it has been included in the sample as possible member because of the position of the a component in the cmd , which suggests an age of @xmath4  30  myr .",
    "the stars in the second subgroup show features , in terms of @xmath13(li  i ) values and position in the cmd , comparable with that of the members of the pleiades cluster : in fig .",
    "[ fig : li_mgs ] they are situated slightly above the lower envelope of the pleiades , while in fig .",
    "[ fig : vi ] they situate on the ( zams ) 80  myrs isochrone . its members could be considered as part of subgroup b4 , one of the four subgroups found by @xcite inside the local association in their study of the space motion of ob  associations using hypparcos astrometric data .",
    "the authors find a mean age of @xmath4  150  myr for this subgroup using information from the photometry .",
    "the higher dispersion found for the stars of this second subgroup in the velocity space ( fig .",
    "[ fig : uvw_mgs ] ) is in agreement with the age estimated by us .    on the other hand ,",
    "the results about ab  dor mg indicate that this quadruple system has indeed @xmath4  50  myr .",
    "the value of @xmath13(li  i ) for ab  dor  a is somewhat above the upper envelope of the pleiades but not so high as the one of ic  2602 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : li_mgs ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "its ( @xmath16 ) colour situates it between the 30 and 80 myr isochrones ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vi ] ) .",
    "the same result is clearly visible in fig .  1 of @xcite , where ab  dor is situated above the lower sequence of the pleiades in the @xmath21 vs. @xmath19 diagram .",
    "with an age of 50  myr , the discrepancy between observations and models for the ab dor very low - mass companion ( ab dor c ) shown in @xcite continuous , although it can be solved if the very low - mass companion were indeed an unresolved binary system @xcite .",
    "in table  [ tab : mgs ] we list the stars belonging to the nearest moving groups : hercules - lyra association and ab  dor mg , and those being part of the local association b4 subgroup . for the hercules - lyra association ,",
    "a division between certain members and candidates with doubtful classification or non members has been made . in the three groups , new candidates from our catalogue of _ late - type stars possible members of young stellar kinematic groups _ @xcite have been selected because of their kinematics ( see @xmath11  [ sec : herc ] and @xmath11  [ sec : abdor ] ) .",
    "a total of 75 stars including the known members and the new candidates selected by us have been analysed .",
    "kinematic , spectroscopic and photometric criteria have been utilized to discriminate non members from the rest of candidates of the hercules - lyra association , and to distinguish between the members of the ab  dor mg and those of the b4 subgroup .    in the velocity space",
    ", hercules - lyra is clearly distinguishable from the rest of the sample ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : uv ] and  [ fig : uvw_mgs ] ) .",
    "the dispersion in @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath10 is comparable with that of other coeval mgs such as castor and ursa major ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and compatible with its age ( see @xmath11  [ sec : herc ] ) . on the other hand , ab  dor  mg and b4 subgroup are mixed up and age - dating criteria are necessary to distinguish between the members of both groups .",
    "nevertheless , the dispersion in @xmath10 for ab  dor mg is quite smaller than the one of b4 subgroup .",
    "age - dating criteria are also necessary to discriminate non members of hercules - lyra from the certain ones . the results of applying them are summarized in table  [ tab : mgs ] : the hercules - lyra association is formed by 10 certain members situated at a mean distance of @xmath4  20  pc and show values of @xmath13(li  i ) ( fig .  [",
    "fig : li_mgs ] ) and a position in the @xmath16 cmd ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vi ] ) compatible with an age of 150    300  myr ;",
    "the members of ab  dor mg are situated at a mean distance of @xmath4  30  pc and show lithium abundances typical of stars with 30    50  myr ( fig .",
    "[ fig : li_mgs ] ) , which is in agreement with their position in the @xmath23 vs. @xmath16 diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vi ] ) ; finally , a set of stars with @xmath13(li  i ) and positions in the cmd compatible with an age of 80    120  myr are mixed with hercules - lyra and ab  dor mg , and have been classified as other members of the local association b4 subgroup ( see @xmath11  3 ) . note that the age estimated using the position of the members of hercules - lyra in the cmd is a lower limit since the 80  myrs isochrone is overlapped with the zams for spectral types earlier than about k5 .",
    "on the other hand , the age estimated using the equivalent width of the li  i line @xmath126707.8   is more robust since the 50% of the stars classified as members have measurements of the @xmath13(li  i ) : the li indicator is useful only for spectral type later than g0 , but only three of the 25 candidates of the initial sample are f stars .",
    "stars in these three subgroups form an excellent list of young cool stars for studying how planets are formed , since they cover a range of ages between 30 and 200 myr , characteristic of the period during which the solar system was formed , and they are close enough to be accessible to adaptive optics .",
    "in addition , they can be taken as targets for direct imaging detection of sub - stellar companions   brown dwarfs and extra - solar giant planets   @xcite and for cold dust , debris disks @xcite .",
