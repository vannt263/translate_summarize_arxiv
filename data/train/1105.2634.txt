    "in the long - ago published article@xcite , hannes alfvn pointed out that electromagnetic response of an atomic nucleus should manifest features generic in hydromagnetic vibrations of an ultra fine piece of a perfectly conducting continuous medium of nuclear density with frozen - in magnetic field and made an attempt to evaluate `` the order of magnitude of possible magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) resonance frequencies '' and in context of physics of nano - particles in [ 16 - 18 ] . ] . in this communication",
    "we revisit this alfvn proposition with focus on the magnitude of intranuclear magnetic field , whose presence in the nucleus volume is the chief prerequisite of sustaining mhd oscillations . in approaching this issue",
    "it seems best to start with the current understanding of `` the history of matter from big bang to the present''@xcite , which teaches us that the nuclear material objects , both neutron stars and atomic nuclei heavier than fe-56 , are produced in the magnetic - flux - conserving core - collapse supernovae .",
    "the implosive contraction of massive main - sequence star gives birth to a neutron star - neutron - dominated mass of self - gravitating nuclear matter with frozen - in magnetic field of extremely large intensity .",
    "since the r - process of explosive nucleosynthesis proceeds too in the presence of super strong magnetic field , it seems not inconsistent to expect that neutron - dominated mid - weigth and heavy nuclei come , like neutron stars , into existence with entrapped magnetic field . in other words ,",
    "the frozen - in magnetic field is the fundamental property of both neutron stars and heavy atomic nuclei .    before embarking on theoretical underpinning for the collective model of nuclear hydromagnetic vibrational response",
    ", we remind that basic purpose of continuum - mechanical description of nuclear giant resonances in terms of vibrational eigenstates of an ultra - fine piece of continuous nuclear matter is to gain some insight into macroscopic properties of nuclear material . the macroscopic nature of giant resonance",
    "is determined by restoring force .",
    "the position of energy centroid of a resonance in the nuclear spectrum is defined by the standard quantum - mechanical equation @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the frequency of nuclear vibrations carrying information about electromagnetic and mechanical parameters of nuclear material and upon the nucleus radius @xmath8 .",
    "the key idea is to extract the magnitude of these parameters by identifying theoretical and empirical energies of resonance under consideration .",
    "a representative example of such an approach is the macroscopic treatment of isoscalar giant resonances in terms of spheroidal and torsional modes of shear elastic vibrations of a solid sphere whose fundamental frequency reads @xmath9^{1/2}$ ] , where @xmath10 is the shear modulus of nuclear matter .",
    "this interpretation rests on observation @xcite that the energy of vibrational eigenstates , @xmath11 , has one and the same mass - number dependence as the empirical energy of giant isoscalar resonances @xmath12 .",
    "the main outcome of this line of argument consists in an assessment of shear modulus @xmath10 of nuclear material , @xmath13 dyn @xmath14 , which is of particular interest in the asteroseismology of neutron stars ( e.g. , [ 22 - 24 ] and references therein ) . in this context",
    "it worth mentioning that magneto - hydrodynamic theory rests on the statement that magnetic field pervading perfectly conducting medium imparts to it a supplementary portion of solid - mechanical elasticity@xcite .",
    "this suggests that hydromagnetic vibrations in question should have some features in common with elastic vibrations of solid sphere and , hence , manifest itself as giant resonances of isoscalar type .",
    "adhearing to the idea that the mid - weight and heavy nuclei are produced ( in r - process of explosive nucleosynthesis ) with frozen - in magnetic field , we consider the nuclear mhd vibrations with focus not on the energy of hydromagnetic resonances but on the intensity of intranuclear magnetic field .",
    "namely , having observed that the mass - number dependence of energy of hydromagnetic resonant excitations is similat to that for empirically established giant resonances we show that above line of reasoning allows one to evaluate the magnetic field magnitude .",
    "following a line of alfvn s argument@xcite , we assume that strongly collective response of atomic nucleus ( to perturbation induced by inelastically scattered electrons or elastically scatted photons ) is dominated by hydromagnetic vibrations .",
    "the relevant to this case mhd equations can be conveniently written in the form@xcite @xmath15,\\quad \\delta { \\bf j}=\\frac{c}{4\\pi}[\\nabla\\times \\delta { \\bf b}],\\\\    \\label{e1.2 }   & & \\delta { \\dot { \\bf b}}=\\nabla\\times [ \\delta { \\bf v}\\times { \\bf b } ] , \\quad \\nabla\\cdot \\delta { \\bf v}=0    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these equations describe lorenz - force - driven oscillations of velocity @xmath16 of material flow coupled with fluctuations of magnetic field @xmath17 about immobile equilibrium state of incompressible and perfectly conducing continuous medium of density @xmath18 pervaded by magnetic field @xmath19 .",
    "taking into account that @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the field of material displacement ( which is the basic variable of solid - mechanical theory of elasticity ) , the coupled equations ( [ e1.1 ] ) and ( [ e1.2 ] ) can be reduced to only one equation , where @xmath22 $ ] is the maxwellian tensor of magnetic field stresses with @xmath23 $ ] .",

    "we obtain @xmath62 remarkably , that according to qcd estimates of radius distribution of magnetic moment in a nucleon ( whose origin is attributed to persistent fermi - motion of quarks ) falls in the range @xmath63 fm .",
    "taking into account that nuclear magneton , @xmath64 erg / g , it easy to see that the intensity of dipole magnetic field @xmath65 on the magnetic poles of sphere of above radius ( spherical region occupied by quark matter ) is ranged in the interval : @xmath66 g. similar argument has been used in paper@xcite , devoted to the possibility of ferromagnetic state of superdense matter .",
    "the above estimates give an idea about magnetic field intensity in the quark matter which is expected to exist in deep cores of neutrons stars@xcite . in this latter context",
    "also noteworthy that current investigations on search for the chiral magnetic effects lead to the conclusion that magnetic fields of above strength should be generated in heavy - ion collisions at intermediate energies@xcite .",
    "it seems interesting to note that the magnetic field energy stored in spherical volume of nuclear radius , @xmath8 , is proportional to the mass number @xmath58 , namely : @xmath67 , as is the case of volume - energy - term in semi - empirical formula for the nuclear binding energy .",
    "this suggests that the volume term of nuclear binding energy may be of magnetic origin , that is , due to the energy of huge magnetic field stored in the nucleus on the stage of explosive nucleosynthesis . in this connction",
    "it is appropriate to note that synthesis of chemical elements in the presence of a super strong magnetic fields of magnetars has recently been studied in [ 28 - 31 ] with remarkable conclusion that the fields of order of @xmath68 g can substantially affect both the r - process of neutron capture and formation of shell nuclear structure , that is , magic nuclei with enhanced stability .",
    "finally , it may be worth mentioning the well - known in astrophysics argument@xcite regarding the effect of strong internal magnetic field on the star shape : the prevailed poloidal magnetic field leads to the oblate deformation of the star shape , whereas the toroidal field leads to prolate deformation is the one in which the conservation of magnetic flux density in the process of the main - sequence star formation from gravitationally contructing gas - dust interstellar medium has been discussed for the first time . as is commonly known today ,",
    "ginzburg and woltjer were the first to suggest that super strong magnetic fields of neutron stars can too be explained as due to the magnetic flux conservation in process of gravitation collapse of massive main - sequence stars . ] .",
    "from this perspective , it is not implausible to expect , therefore , that it is the super strong internal magnetic field plays decisive part in the formation of equilibrium shapes of nuclei heavier than fe-56 .",
    "as a development of alfvn hypothesis about the atomic nucleus capability of responding by magneto - hydrodynamic vibrations , we have set up a collective model providing theoretical basis for computing energies of nuclear hydromagnetic resonances .",
    "the central to this model , which is appropriate to nuclei heavier than fe-56 , is the intranuclear magnetic field .",
    "this field is considered as being frozen - in the mid - wight and heavy nuclei on the stage of their formation in the r - process of explosive nucleosynthesis .",
    "the model predicts that the energy of nuclear hydromagnetic resonances is a linear function of internal magnetic field .",
    "the mass - number dependence of energy has one and the same shape as that for typical giant resonances .",
    "based on this and assuming that some of observed giant resonances are predominantly of hydromagnetic nature we found that the intensity of intranuclear magnetic field falls in the realm of magnetic fields of magnetars .",
