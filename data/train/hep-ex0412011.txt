    "we describe measurements and searches performed using a data sample of photonic events with large missing transverse energy collected with the opal detector in 1999 and 2000 , the final two years of lep operation .",
    "the events result from @xmath9 collisions in the centre - of - mass energy range of about @xmath1  gev with a combined integrated luminosity of 426.5  pb@xmath94 . when deriving cross - section limits on new physics processes , these data are combined with previously published data@xcite taken at 189  gev and corresponding to 177.3  pb@xmath94 .",
    "the present paper builds on past publications based on data samples collected at lower centre - of - mass energies@xcite .",
    "the new data samples , taken at the highest energies achieved by lep , provide discovery potential in a new kinematic regime with a large increase in integrated luminosity .",
    "similar searches have been made by the other lep collaborations  @xcite .",
    "the analysis presented here is designed to select events with two photons and significant missing transverse energy in the final state , indicating the presence of at least one neutrino - like invisible particle which interacts only weakly with matter .",
    "the event selection for this search topology is identical to that used in our most recent publication@xcite . within the standard model ,",
    "such events are expected from the @xmath2 process .",
    "the selection is designed to retain acceptance for events with an additional photon , provided that the system formed by the three photons is consistent with the presence of significant missing transverse energy .",
    "this final - state topology is also sensitive to several new physics scenarios . in the context of the search for new physics , the emphasis in this publication is on general searches applicable to a broad class of models . to this end",
    ", a generic classification is used : @xmath95 where @xmath96 is neutral and can decay radiatively ( @xmath97 ) and @xmath4 is stable and only weakly interacting . the limits presented for this generic process are applicable to a variety of physics searches . for the general case of massive @xmath96 and @xmath4 this includes conventional supersymmetric processes @xmath98 .",
    "there is particularly good sensitivity for the special case of @xmath99 .",
    "this is applicable both to the production of excited neutrinos @xmath100 and to supersymmetric models in which the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is a light gravitino and @xmath101 is the next - to - lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) which decays to a gravitino and a photon ( @xmath102 ) . in the latter case",
    ", we also set limits on an example light - gravitino model@xcite .",
    "the neutralino lifetime in such models is a free parameter . in this paper",
    "we address only the case of promptly decaying  @xmath96 .",
    "this search topology also has sensitivity to the production of two particles , one invisible , or with an invisible decay mode , and the other decaying into two photons .",
    "such events might arise from the production of a higgs - like scalar particle , @xmath103 : @xmath104 , followed by s@xmath105@xmath106 , @xmath107 .",
    "the results of an opal search for this process , including the hadronic and leptonic @xmath108 decays , have been separately reported  @xcite .",
    "finally , this search topology can also probe ww@xmath109 quartic couplings in the @xmath110 process .",
    "the opal quartic gauge coupling measurements are described in  @xcite .",
    "this paper first describes the opal detector and the monte carlo samples used . a brief summary of the event selection",
    "will then be given , followed by cross - section measurements and comparisons with standard model expectations .",
    "the new physics search results will then be discussed .",
    "the opal detector , which is described in detail in  @xcite , contained a silicon micro - vertex detector surrounded by a pressurized central tracking system operating inside a solenoid with a magnetic field of 0.435 t. the barrel and endcap regions of the detector were instrumented with scintillation counters , presamplers and a lead - glass electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecal ) .",
    "the magnet return yoke was instrumented for hadron calorimetry and was surrounded by muon chambers .",
    "electromagnetic calorimeters close to the beam axis measured luminosity and completed the acceptance .",
    "the measurements presented here are based mainly on the observation of clusters of energy deposited in the lead - glass electromagnetic calorimeter .",
    "this consisted of an array of 9,440 lead - glass blocks in the barrel region , @xmath111 , with a quasi - pointing geometry and two endcap arrays , each of 1,132 lead - glass blocks , covering the polar angle axis points along the direction of the @xmath112 beam .",
    "the polar angle @xmath113 is defined with respect to the @xmath112 beam direction and @xmath114 is the azimuthal angle measured from the @xmath115 axis . ] range , @xmath116 .",
    "hermetic electromagnetic calorimeter coverage was achieved beyond the end of the ecal down to 33 mrad in polar angle with the use of the gamma - catcher calorimeter , the forward calorimeter and the silicon - tungsten calorimeter .",
    "scintillators in the barrel and endcap regions were used to reject backgrounds from cosmic - ray interactions by providing time measurements for the large fraction ( @xmath117 80% ) of photons which converted in the material in front of the ecal .",
    "the barrel time - of - flight ( tof ) scintillator bars were located outside the solenoid in front of the barrel ecal and matched its geometrical acceptance @xmath111 .",
    "tile endcap ( te ) scintillator arrays were located in front of the endcap ecal at @xmath118 .",
    "additional scintillating - tile arrays , referred to as the mip plug , were located at more forward angles . in the region from 125 to 200 mrad these detectors were used to provide redundancy in the rejection of events with significant electromagnetic activity in the forward region .",
    "the integrated luminosities of the data samples are determined to better than 1% from small - angle bhabha scattering events in the silicon - tungsten calorimeter .",
    "triggers based on electromagnetic energy deposits in either the barrel or endcap electromagnetic calorimeters lead to full trigger efficiency for photonic events passing the event selection criteria used in this analysis .",
    "the nunugpv98  @xcite and kk2f  @xcite monte carlo generators were used to simulate the standard model signal process , @xmath2 . for other expected standard model processes , a number of different generators were used : radcor  @xcite for @xmath119 ; bhwide  @xcite and teegg  @xcite for @xmath120 ; koralw  @xcite using ` grc4f `  @xcite matrix elements for @xmath121 and @xmath122 , and koralz@xcite for @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "the bdk program@xcite was used for @xmath125 , except for @xmath126 which was generated using the vermaseren program@xcite . the expected contribution from each of these standard model processes",
    "was evaluated using a total equivalent integrated luminosity at least five times larger than the integrated luminosity of the data sample .    to simulate possible new physics processes of the type @xmath95 where @xmath96 decays to @xmath127 and",
    "@xmath4 escapes detection , a modified version of the susygen  @xcite monte carlo generator was used to produce neutralino pair events of the type @xmath128 , @xmath129 , with isotropic angular distributions for the production and decay of @xmath130 and including the effects of initial - state radiation . for @xmath131 206 gev ,",
    "monte carlo events were generated at 49 points in the kinematically accessible region of the ( @xmath132 , @xmath133 ) plane .",
    "monte carlo events at 42 points in ( @xmath132 , @xmath133 ) with @xmath131 189 gev were generated for our previous publication@xcite .",
    "using these two samples , the selection efficiency was determined for each generated point and then parametrized as a function of ( @xmath132 , @xmath133 ) and centre - of - mass energy .",
    "the efficiency varies slowly with energy and for energies above 206 gev , the 206  gev values were used .",
    "all monte carlo samples described above were processed through the full opal detector simulation  @xcite .",
    "a detailed description of the event selection is given in our previous publications@xcite .",
    "in brief , photons are identified as energy deposits in the electromagnetic calorimeter .",
    "events are required to have no other significant activity , except for the possibility of additional photons .",
    "information from the tracking chambers is used to reject electromagnetic clusters associated with prompt charged tracks while retaining sensitivity for photons which converted in the material between the interaction point and the calorimeter .",
    "timing information is used to reject backgrounds from cosmic - ray events .",
    "events with activity beyond the acceptance of the ecal are vetoed using information from the gamma catcher , the forward calorimeter , the silicon - tungsten calorimeter and the mip plug.the kinematic acceptance of the selection is defined by requiring :    * at least two photons , each with @xmath134 and @xmath135 , or one photon with @xmath136 gev and @xmath137 and a second photon with @xmath136 gev and @xmath135 ; here @xmath138 is the photon energy , @xmath113 is the photon polar angle and @xmath139 is the photon scaled energy @xmath140 * that the two - photon system consisting of the two highest - energy photons have momentum transverse to the beamline ( @xmath141 ) satifying @xmath142    the selection is designed to retain acceptance for events with additional photons in which the resulting photonic system is still consistent with the presence of significant missing energy .",
    "this reduces the sensitivity of the measurement to the modelling of higher - order contributions .",
    "the data described in this paper were taken during the final two years of lep operation , at centre - of - mass energies between 192 and 209 gev .",
    "for the purposes of this publication the data have been binned into six samples with mean centre - of - mass energies of approximately 192 , 196 , 200 , 202 , 205 and 207 gev .",
    "the energy ranges and luminosity breakdown are summarized in table  [ tab : g2_xsec_new ] . applied to the entire sample , the selection yields a total of @xmath143 events , in good agreement with the kk2f prediction of @xmath144 events for the standard model @xmath2 contribution .",
    "the expected contribution from other standard model processes and from cosmic ray and beam - related backgrounds is @xmath145 events , dominated by contributions from low - angle radiative bhabha events and radiative four - fermion final states .",
    "the selection results are included in table  [ tab : g2_xsec_new ] . the selection efficiency for @xmath2 events within the kinematic acceptance of the selection is ( @xmath146)% , independent of energy .",
    "the cross - section within the kinematic acceptance of the selection is also shown in table  [ tab : g2_xsec_new ] as are the corresponding predictions obtained using the kk2f monte carlo generator .",
    "the predictions of the nunugpv98 monte carlo generator were also examined and agreed well with those of kk2f .",
    "small differences are accounted for in the systematic uncertainties .",
    "the dominant sources of systematic uncertainties arise from modelling of the event selection efficiency , especially the simulation of the detector material and consequent photon conversion probabilities .",
    "the effects of these uncertainties and of uncertainties on the efficiency of timing cuts used to suppress cosmic - ray events are calculated accounting for different event topologies ( both photons in the barrel region , both in the endcap , or one in each ) .",
    "this total uncertainty is 1.7% .",
    "other sources arise from uncertainties on the integrated luminosity measurement ( 0.5% ) , on detector occupancy estimates ( 1% ) obtained from the analysis of randomly triggered events , on comparisons of different monte carlo event generators for the process @xmath2(1% ) .",
    "the total systematic uncertainty common to each energy bin is 2.3% . in individual energy bins ,",
    "monte carlo statistics account for an additional systematic uncertainty of @xmath147% .",
    "the kinematic properties of the selected events , summed over all energies , are displayed in figure  [ f : g2_kine_all ] where they are compared with the predicted distributions for @xmath2 obtained using the kk2f generator normalized to the integrated luminosity of the data .",
    "plot ( a ) shows the recoil mass distribution of the selected events ( for the two most energetic photons in the case of events with three or more photons ) .",
    "the distribution is peaked near the mass of the @xmath148 as is expected for contributions from @xmath2 .",
    "the resolution of the recoil mass is typically @xmath149 gev for @xmath150 .",
    "events with a negative recoil - mass squared are plotted in the zero bin of the distribution .",
    "plot ( b ) shows the distribution of the scaled energy of the second most energetic photon .",
    "plot ( c ) shows the @xmath151 invariant - mass distribution for which the mass resolution is typically @xmath152 gev .",
    "plot ( d ) shows the distribution in scaled transverse momentum of the selected two - photon system .",
    "there are 3 selected events having a third photon with deposited energy above 300 mev and within the polar - angle acceptance of the selection .",
    "the corresponding expectation from kk2f is @xmath153 events .",
    "the results of this selection are used to test the standard model and to search for new physics contributions . in the absence of an excess of events beyond the standard model expectation , we set 95% cl upper limits on the quantity @xmath3 for the general case of massive @xmath96 and @xmath4 , and separately for the special case of @xmath99 .",
    "efficiencies were evaluated under the assumption that @xmath96 decays promptly .",
    "monte carlo samples were generated for a variety of mass points in the kinematically accessible region of the @xmath154 plane .",
    "to set limits for arbitrary @xmath132 and @xmath133 , the efficiency over the entire @xmath154 plane was parameterized using the efficiencies calculated at the generated mass points . for @xmath132 values below @xmath155/2 ,",
    "search results based on lep1 data have been previously reported  @xcite . in this low - mass region ,",
    "events with radiative return to the @xmath148 followed by @xmath156 would yield very different kinematics than those used here to generate the signal monte carlo samples .",
    "for this reason , the search is restricted to the mass region @xmath157 .",
    "[ sec : g2_results_allmy ]    the searches for @xmath95 , @xmath97 , both for the general case discussed here and the special case of @xmath99 discussed in section 5.2 , use the methods described in our previous publications@xcite .",
    "selected events are classified as consistent with a given value of @xmath132 and @xmath133 if the energy of each of the photons falls within the region kinematically accessible to photons from the process @xmath95 , @xmath97 , including resolution effects .",
    "selection efficiencies at some of the generated grid points for the @xmath95 , @xmath97 @xmath159  gev monte carlo events are shown in table  [ tab : g2_eff_206 ] .",
    "these values include the efficiency of the kinematic consistency requirement which is higher than 95% at each generated point in the region of the @xmath154 plane .",
    "for @xmath160 values lower than 5 gev the efficiency begins to fall off rapidly and is thus difficult to model accurately .",
    "for this reason , we place limits only in the region of the @xmath161 plane satisfying @xmath162 gev .",
    "efficiencies at lower centre - of - mass energies are obtained from an interpolation between these efficiencies and the equivalent efficiencies at 189 gev , which are given in our previous publication  @xcite . for data taken at centre - of - mass energies above 206 gev ,",
    "the 206 gev efficiencies are used .",
    "events from @xmath2 are typically characterized by a high - energy photon from the radiative return to the @xmath108 and a second lower energy photon .",
    "the kinematic consistency requirement is such that the two photons must have energies within the same ( kinematically accessible ) region .",
    "thus , as @xmath132 and @xmath133 increase , the allowed range of energy for the photons narrows , and fewer @xmath163 events will be accepted .",
    "for the 54 selected events , the distribution of the number of events consistent with a given mass point ( @xmath132,@xmath133 ) is consistent with the expectation from @xmath2 monte carlo , over the full ( @xmath132,@xmath133 ) plane .",
    "upper limits are placed on @xmath3 accounting for the number of selected events and the expected number of background events from the process @xmath2 .",

    "these limits range from @xmath169 fb .    systematic uncertainties arise from the sources described in section 4 .",
    "however there are additional contributions due to limited monte carlo statistics at each of the generated ( @xmath170 ) points and from uncertainties on the efficiency parameterization across the ( @xmath170 ) plane and as a function of energy .",
