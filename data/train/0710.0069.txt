    "barrier options are a type of path - dependent options whose values depend on the specific path followed by the underlying asset during the option s life , and w.r.t .",
    "some specified asset values , usually referred to as barriers .",
    "these options are exotic derivatives traded in over - the - counter markets and they can therefore be tailored to specific customer needs .",
    "moreover , the additional constraints imposed on them by the barrier makes them a much cheaper and attractive product then the standard options .",
    "barriers can also be added to any existing type of standard or exotic option .",
    "the barrier option market has thus been expanding rapidly and it has been estimated @xcite that it has doubled every year since 1992 . in parallel with this development , a large number of newly designed barrier options have been trading very actively in financial markets @xcite .",
    "analytical formulas exist for most of the standard barrier options .",
    "rubinstein and reiner @xcite , rich @xcite , and kunitomo and ikeda @xcite derived analytical formulas for a variety of standard knock - in and knock - out european options with full barriers .",
    "heynen and kat @xcite obtained similar formulas for some special types of barrier options , namely the partial barrier options , and for so - called outside barrier options where it is another variable different from the underlying asset which determines whether the option knocks in or out .",
    "closed - form solutions for double barrier options , some of which are time - dependent , have been obtained @xcite .",
    "the extension of these formulas to the more complex case of american - style barrier options has been undertaken by broadie and detemple @xcite , gao _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , as well as haug @xcite .",
    "however , all the formulas obtained in such extensions are only closed - form approximations .    despite all these efforts to derive analytical pricing formulas for barrier options ,",
    "there is still no analytical formulas available for large classes of both european- and america - style barrier options @xcite .",
    "although merton @xcite proposed the closed - form solution for the continuously monitored down - and - out barier option in 1973 , it s only in the @xmath0 s that valuation formulas were obtained for other variants of this european - style option @xcite .",
    "this is simply because the valuation of financial options has led to mathematical models which are most often challenging to solve .",
    "for instance , for most of the complex options , there are no analytical formulas available , and almost all formulas have been obtained under the assumptions that , amongst others , the underlying asset price has a lognormal distribution with constant drift and volatility parameters , and that there are no transaction costs @xcite . however , as empirical evidence suggest the contrary , new models with stochastic or time - dependent volatilities , or including transaction costs have been designed and implemented .",
    "nevertheless , these attempts to improve on the assumptions underlying the derivation of analytical formulas have been made mostly for standard american options @xcite .",
    "for the valuation of options , and exotic options in particular , numerical methods remain a tool of choice .",
    "this is first justified by the fact that the number of exotic options that can be designed is limitless , and as new products enter the market one of the most practical way , if not the only available means to price them , are quite often the numerical methods .",
    "they are also a convenient benchmark for testing the validity of analytical formulas , especially as they become available .",
    "there are even instances where they are faster than analytical methods , even those analytical methods involving fast converging infinite sums , when the required accuracy is nt too high .    as a numerical method for option valuation ,",
    "the lattice methods have been used extensively , and for barrier options it appears however that they are essentially useless without the proper positioning of the barrier which must line - up with the tree nodes .",
    "despite all the techniques that have been developed to improve on lattice methods , they are still quite computer - intensive @xcite .",
    "monte carlo methods have been considered as inflexible and unreliable for option pricing , until the last decade where they yielded more promising results based on innovative techniques which are now a topic of current research .",
    "barraquand and martineau @xcite amongst others , obtained in this context some interesting results for multi - asset american options .",
    "the most commonly used numerical method in option pricing these days appears to be the finite difference methods .",
    "they have an acceptable computational cost when an appropriate implicit method is used ( see @xcite ) .",
    "they can also be extended to cater for american - style options , by formulating them as linear complementary problems .    in this paper",
    "we consider an implicit finite difference approach to the valuation of barrier options .",
    "these barrier options may have various features including double barriers , dividend - paying - stocks , rebate payments , or some combination of these .",
    "barriers may be monitored either continuously or discretely .",
    "we use a well - known @xmath1-method which is fourth - order accurate in space and second - order accurate in time , by relating the parameter @xmath1 to the mesh sizes .",
    "in addition to the high - order accurate scheme and the stretching effect of the coordinate transformation used , the strength of this approach lies on a probability - based optimal determination of the boundary conditions , along which the option values are known exactly . in this way , with a reasonable accuracy and for the most practical considerations , we are generally able to use fewer than 20 asset prices and 20 time steps per year to value most of the barrier options , especially when the barrier is continuously applied .",
    "however , the efficiency of our approach is much clearly demonstrated in the case of discretely monitored barrier options , when we compare the results we obtained with that of several other authors . as usual ,",
    "due to some parity considerations , we shall focus our attention only on knock - out call options .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [",
    "s : model ] we discuss the mathematical model for valuing barrier options .",
    "section [ s : fds ] is devoted to the discretization of the modeling differential equation , while section [ s : nsol ] discusses applications of the resulting implicit scheme to the various types of barriers options , and section [ s : nres ] reports the corresponding numerical results .",
    "we make the usual assumption that the underlying asset price @xmath2 has a geometric brownian motion , with drift and volatility parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively . thus the process followed by @xmath2",
    "can be written with the usual notation and in terms of the wiener process @xmath5 as    @xmath6    the price @xmath7 of a european option contingent on @xmath2 must then satisfy the black - scholes differential equation    @xmath8    where the partial differential operator @xmath9 is given by @xmath10 and where @xmath11 denotes the risk - free interest rate .",
    "we shall usually assume that the underlying asset price pays a continuous dividend yield at a continuous rate of @xmath12 per year , and as we are placing ourselves in the traditional risk - neutral world in which the market price of risk is zero , we shall have in this case @xmath13    thanks to the put - call parity for european options , and also to the similar parity relation between knock - ins and knock - outs , we shall consider only knock - out call options . to begin with ,",
    "let @xmath14 denote the constant barrier value for a down - and - out barrier option .",
    "since the value of the option at expiration time @xmath15 is its payoff @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the strike price of the option , the initial condition for equation is given by @xmath18 the corresponding boundary conditions follow from the properties of call options . in the simplest case where the constant barrier value @xmath14 is continuously applied , denoting by @xmath19 the rebate received",
    "if the barrier is ever breached , the boundary conditions are    @xmath20    it should be noted that boundary condition which is usually used for the valuation of call options is not suitable for an optimal algorithm , in particular because the value of @xmath2 in that condition is generally exceedingly large , and the resulting equality is only an approximation , and all these tend to slow down the valuation algorithm .",
    "we shall therefore always strive in this paper to find optimal boundaries of the solution domain along which the option values are known exactly , and which also yield an optimal truncation of the solution domain .",
    "the black - scholes equation can be analyzed directly for the valuation of barrier options , as for example in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , there is a numerically more effective coordinate transformation that we shall adopt here , and which is obtained by first setting @xmath21 since for all practical considerations the underlying price range generally lies in a subinterval of @xmath22 it appears that restricts the underlying asset price in the @xmath23-coordinate to range most often in a small interval such as @xmath24 on the other hand , not only transforms into a forward - time problem , but it also has the advantage of shrinking the time range . under the change of coordinates @xmath25 and ,",
    "equation is transformed into @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 so , @xmath29 where @xmath30 . here",
    "@xmath31 and @xmath32 are the only two non - dimensional parameters of the black - scholes equation for dividend - paying - assets . to discard the terms in @xmath33 and @xmath34 in this last differential equation",
    ", we now make a change of the dependent variable by setting    @xmath35    where @xmath36 and @xmath37 this last change of variables reduces the original equation to the diffusion equation    @xmath38    letting @xmath39 the initial and boundary conditions given earlier are also transformed into the following expressions in the @xmath40-coordinates .",
    "@xmath41    it is worth nothing at this point that the change of variable is also very convenient for an efficient numerical algorithm .",
    "indeed , it gives the final solution as a scalar multiple of the numerically computed factor @xmath42 where the scalar @xmath43 is known exactly and so , does not involve any error . in this way any error expansion due to transformation will tend to be minimized .",
    "denote by @xmath44 and @xmath45 the mesh sizes in the space and the time directions , respectively .",
    "denote also by @xmath46 the discrete approximation of @xmath47 at the grid node @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 let @xmath51 be the difference operator given by @xmath52 for the discretization of the reduced equation we choose the two - time level , three - space - point scheme @xmath53 also called weighted average approximation or @xmath1-method .",
    "the weight @xmath1 in this expression is assumed to satisfy the condition @xmath54 in order to avoid negative weights .",
    "the values @xmath55 and @xmath56 give the explicit scheme and the fully implicit scheme , respectively .",
    "if we let @xmath57 i.e. @xmath58 then for @xmath59 the scheme is stable if and only if @xmath60 for @xmath61 it is stable for all values of @xmath62 for this scheme , the truncation error , i.e. the amount by which the exact solution of the differential equation does not satisfy the discrete approximation , is generally of first order accuracy in @xmath63 while the popular crank - nicolson scheme which corresponds to @xmath64 is second - order accurate in both @xmath65 and @xmath66    for a much higher accuracy of the finite difference scheme ( fds ) , we shall relate in this paper the choice of the parameter @xmath1 to the values of @xmath67 and @xmath65 of the grid line spacings .",
    "more precisely , we shall assume that @xmath68 it is well - known that the resulting scheme is @xmath69 i.e. second- order accurate in time and fourth order accurate in space ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "such a scheme has been used in @xcite for the valuation of american options with error correction at the critical boundary , leading to results that are comparatively more accurate than the standard ones found in the literature . however",
    ", this specific weighted average scheme has not yet been applied to the valuation of barrier options , to the best of our knowledge .",
    "et al _ used a method called point - distributed finite volume scheme in @xcite to directly discretize the black - scholes equation , but that method is only first order accurate in time , and the paper does not comment on the speed ( in terms of number of time steps ) of the scheme for achieving a given level of accuracy .",
    "since @xmath70 is positive , condition restricts @xmath1 to the interval @xmath71 but the condition for stability @xmath72 is always satisfied in this case .",
    "moreover , the condition @xmath73 implies that @xmath74 this in practical terms means that even by requesting to hold , we can still take large time steps while maintaining accuracy and stability .",
    "if we denote by @xmath75 and @xmath76 the number of space- and time - intervals , respectively , in the solution grid , and by @xmath77 the finite difference operator given by @xmath78 then an expansion of the discretized equation leads to a linear algebraic system of equations of the form    @xmath79    the system can be written in terms of tridiagonal matrices and we shall solve it with the thomas algorithm which includes gaussian elimination without pivoting .",
    "we discuss in this section the application of the fds described above to the derivation of a numerical solution to the pricing problem for barrier options .",
    "as already indicated , we shall always implement whenever possible in this paper an optimal truncation of the solution domain by replacing the approximate boundary condition of the form , or equivalently , with a boundary condition for which both the option value is known exactly and the resulting solution domain is the smallest possible .",
    "let @xmath80 be the initial price of the underlying and @xmath81 the price of the underlying at a time @xmath82 in the case of a down - and - out call option , the probability @xmath83 that the barrier will not be breached at time @xmath84 is given by @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the standard normal distribution function and @xmath87 let @xmath88 be the smallest number such that @xmath89 has numerical value @xmath90 the value of @xmath88 depends on the level of accuracy required and also on the computing system used for the calculations .",
    "an appropriate value for @xmath88 usually lies in the interval @xmath91 depending on the level of acuracy required . for a given parameter set ,",
    "the minimum value of @xmath92 which guarantees that the barrier will not be breached at time @xmath84 is given by the inequality @xmath93 or equivalently by @xmath94 now , let @xmath95 be the turning point of the function @xmath96 and denote by @xmath97 the minimum value of the current stock price @xmath80 above which the barrier becomes worthless , and set @xmath98 then it is easy to see that    @xmath99    for any value of @xmath92 above @xmath100 or equivalently for any value of @xmath101 above @xmath102 where @xmath103 the barrier is worthless and the option behaves exactly as a standard option . in particular , the corresponding option value along the boundary @xmath104 or above this boundary is given by the well - known black - scholes formula for european call options .",
    "it therefore follows from equations , and that the solution domain for @xmath105 reduces to the rectangle @xmath106\\times [ 0,\\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{2 } t].$ ] similarly for an up - and - out barrier option , if we let @xmath97 denote the maximum value of the current underlying asset price below which the barrier becomes worthless , then @xmath107 is given by    @xmath108    in this case the optimal solution domain reduces to the rectangle @xmath109\\times[0,\\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{2 } t ] .$ ] this optimal determination of the boundary conditions has several applications , including the classification of double barrier options .",
    "a similar determination of optimal boundary conditions can be achieved for time - varying barriers , as opposed to the constant barriers we have discussed here .",
    "note that by construction we have @xmath110 in and @xmath111 in    our determination of the numerical solution for a pricing problem will amount to calculating @xmath112 where @xmath113 and this may require interpolation if @xmath101 does not line up with a grid line .",
    "however , for @xmath75 large , it is always possible to slightly enlarge the range of the spacial variable @xmath23 without affecting the performance of the algorithm in any way , just by adjusting the value of @xmath114 by a fraction of the grid increment by so doing , we can always line up @xmath101 with a grid point , and such adjustment of @xmath114 is feasible when for instance the grid increment @xmath44 is small .",
    "we shall therefore combine these two techniques in our calculation of @xmath115    the price of barrier options often displays some singularities near the barrier value and it is therefore customary in a finite difference pricing approach for these options to use adaptive grids in an attempt to achieve the required accuracy of the numerical solution with a smaller number of mesh points , i.e. with a faster algorithm .",
    "suppose that the grid increment @xmath44 of the spacial variable @xmath23 is non constant and denote by @xmath116 the @xmath117th grid increment , where the @xmath118s are grid points in the @xmath119direction .",
    "the number @xmath120 is often called non uniformity parameter of the difference grid @xcite .",
    "a direct substitution of the non constant increment @xmath121 into the fds gives rise to the nonuniform version of equation .",
    "a similar but much simpler discretization of equation can be derived for a nonuniform time stepping . for the nonuniform discretization of either of the variables",
    ", we used a geometric progression . thus for the space variable , we set @xmath122 for some positive numbers @xmath123 and @xmath124 here",
    ", @xmath123 turns out to be the non uniformity parameter and the @xmath121 s form a geometric progression with common ratio @xmath125 values of @xmath123 not close to @xmath126 will lead to instability of the numerical solution , while for @xmath123 close to @xmath126 the resulting scheme will tend to be stable @xcite .    a two - dimensional grid made up of @xmath75 space intervals and @xmath76 time intervals will be referred to as a grid of mesh ( size ) @xmath127 in the case of the @xmath128 that we are considering , @xmath76 and @xmath75 are to be so chosen that is satisfied , and this is easily achieved by letting @xmath129 in some very rare cases ( e.g when @xmath130 ) , the occurrence of negative option prices at the intermediary time steps might become persistent and slow down the convergence of the scheme .",
    "this type of difficulty is also easily resolved by letting @xmath76 be slightly larger than @xmath131 say @xmath132    it should be noted that our algorithm for the implementation of the optimal boundary condition shares some similarities with the method for finding the conditional expectation estimator in the monte carlo simulation of a down - and - in barrier option @xcite .",
    "indeed , in such a monte carlo valuation , as soon as the barrier is breached , the simulation run is ended , and the corresponding estimator is the black - scholes value for the resulting option parameters . in the same way for the finite difference scheme , as soon as we are certain that the initial price is sufficiently far away for the barrier to become worthless , the corresponding option value is its black - scholes value .      in the case of",
    "discretely sampled barriers , we assume that barrier monitoring occurs either on a daily basis or on a weekly basis .",
    "we adopt a day count convention which will allow a comparison of our numerical results with others at our disposal by letting a year consist of @xmath133 weeks , and a week to consist of @xmath134 days , so a year has @xmath135 days . for the numerical solution , we let @xmath136 be the number of time steps implemented between two consecutive monitoring dates , so that the total number of time steps is given by @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the number of monitoring dates during the option s life .",
    "as is well - known @xcite , for increased accuracy and improved convergence , we shall place the barrier itself midway between grid points .",
    "we start by showing the result of the performance test for the proposed optimal truncation of the solution domain . in most papers where",
    "approximate conditions of the form are used to determine boundary conditions in barrier option pricing problems , the value used for @xmath139 , the maximum asset price in the solution domain , is usually not indicated .",
    "that is the case for instance in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , by rewriting and implementing the same algorithm described in the latter paper under the scheme termed modified explicit finite difference ( mefd ) in that paper , we ve found by trial and error that choosing @xmath140 gives exactly the same results as those in table 1 and table 4 of the said paper .",
    "this value of @xmath141 also turns out to give the best results for the parameter sets considered in that same paper .",
    "other choices for @xmath139 which are commonly used for a similar range of data are @xmath142 or @xmath143 , as in @xcite and @xcite . however , inappropriate choices for @xmath139 lead to very poor results as we show in table  [ tb : boyle ] .    rcrcrcrcrcrcr + & & & & +   + & & obes & & & & obes & & +   + & & & & @xmath144&&@xmath144 & & & & + & & & & @xmath145&&@xmath146 & & & & + & & & & & & & & & & & & + 50 & & 6.01109 & & 6.0111 & & 6.8299 & & 1.2654 & & 1.2654 & & + & & ( 0.36 ) & & ( 0.344 ) & & & & ( 0.39 ) & & ( 0.33 ) & & + 100 & & 5.9984 & & 5.9984 & & 6.8603 & & 1.2704 & & 1.2704 & & + & & ( 0.53 ) & & ( 0.44 ) & & & & ( 0.53 ) & & ( 0.47 ) & & + 150 & & 5.9965 & & 5.9997 & & 6.7449 & & 1.2719 & & 1.2719 & & + & & ( 2.09 ) & & ( 2.33 ) & & & & ( 2.203 ) & & ( 2.42 ) & & + 200 & & 5.9993 & & 5.9993 & & 6.6897 & & 1.2725 & & 1.2726 & & + & & ( 2.54 ) & & ( 2.70 ) & & & & ( 2.58 ) & & ( 2.85 ) & & + 700 & & 5.9970 & & 5.9970 & & 6.74 & & 1.2738 & & 1.2738 & & + & & ( 15.81 ) & & ( 17.766 ) & & & & ( 15.75 ) & & ( 18.16 ) & & + 800 & & 5.9972 & & 5.9972 & & 6.78 & & 1.2739 & & 1.2739 & & + & & ( 19.20 ) & & ( 21.906 ) & & & & ( 19.44 ) & & ( 22.30 ) & & + 900 & & 5.9973 & & 5.9973 & & 6.80 & & 1.2739 & & 1.2739 & & + & & ( 10.703 ) & & ( 12.047 ) & & & & ( 10.922 ) & & ( 11.625 ) & & + 1000&&5.9969 & & 5.9969 & & 6.7991 & & 1.2739 & & 1.2739 & & + & & ( 33.86 ) & & ( 40.59 ) & & & & ( 34.31 ) & & ( 42.25 ) & & + 2000&&5.9970 & & 5.9970 & & 6.7949 & & 1.2738 & & 1.2738 & & + & & ( 72.67 ) & & ( 85.97 ) & & & & ( 75.12 ) & & ( 85.797 ) & & + 3000&&5.9969 & & 5.9969 & & 6.7718 & & 1.2738 & & 1.2738 & & + & & ( 189.34 ) & & ( 238.141 ) & & & & ( 192.062)&&(236.66 ) & & + 4000&&5.9969 & & 5.9969 & & 6.8020 & & 1.2738 & & 1.2739 & & + & & ( 263.28 ) & & ( 320.187 ) & & & & ( 268.39 ) & & ( 335.31 ) & & + & & & & & & & & & & & & +    contrary to conditions of the form given by equations - that yield a systematic determination of the optimal boundary conditions , there is certainly no formula available for the best choice of @xmath139 and it s value is usually determined only by trial and error .",

    "a striking feature of the high - order accurate hobis is its fastest convergence for initial asset prices closest to boundaries of the solution domain . for initial asset values closest to @xmath158 on the upper boundary ( u ) , the minimum mesh size that returns the anlytical option price is @xmath174 and corresponds to a cpu time of @xmath175 seconds . for values closest to the barrier on the lower boundary ( l )",

    "this performance is clearly due to the exactness of option values at the boundaries in combination with the fact that interpolation yields best results for points closest to known function values .",
    "but this is also a consequence of the coordinates transformation ( in the first set of data with @xmath178 in table  [ tb : bound ] , @xmath179 ) , the higher - order accuracy of the scheme that forces all error less than one to quickly disappear , and the implicit nature of the scheme that also tends to quickly reduce any error .",
    "for instance , in the second set of data in table [ tb : bound ] with @xmath180 and @xmath181 although the space increment is @xmath182 all significant errors have disappeared by the completion of the first time step .",
    "the table also shows as expected that the more we move away from the boundaries , the higher the error tends to become in option values with a fixed mesh size .",
    "we have therefore also indicated the minimum cpu time required for initial values midway ( m ) between the boundaries , and we can reasonably argue that for any given scheme and any parameter set , the maximum cpu time for all values of @xmath80 in the solution domain is close to the maximum cpu time obtained for @xmath80 close to the boundaries and at midway .",

    "it should be noted that this is also the maximum cpu time for any possible value of the initial price .",
    "indeed , another feature of the optimal boundary condition is to determine exactly when a barrier becomes worthless for a given value of @xmath147 so its value is reduced to the corresponding vanilla black - scholes value .",
    "more precisely , by construction of @xmath187 whenever @xmath188 the barrier option value is the vanilla black - scholes value , and so any scheme ( explicit , implicit or otherwise ) based on the optimal boundary returns the option value in zero seconds for such values of @xmath189    the @xmath134th column of table  [ tb : bound ] shows that implementing the same high - order accurate implicit scheme by using the approximate boundary condition of the form leads to much more inaccurate results and requires about @xmath190 times more computing time , although the value of @xmath140 appears to be the best choice for all sets of parameters considered .",
