    "in high-@xmath8 cuprates , the @xmath0-axis transport occurs as a tunneling process , and therefore signifies the density of electrons available for the tunneling as well as the tunneling matrix elements .",
    "@xcite as a result , the @xmath0-axis resistivity @xmath11 is a useful probe @xcite of such features as the pseudogap @xcite or the superconducting correlations @xcite above @xmath8 .",
    "on the other hand , there are a number of open questions regarding the interpretation of the magnetic - field ( @xmath12 ) dependence of @xmath11 below @xmath8 , in which the suppression of superconductivity and the subsequent negative magnetoresistance ( mr ) at higher @xmath12 defines a peak value of @xmath11 at @xmath7 .",
    "one question is whether the magnetic - field region above @xmath7 can be viewed as the normal state and , if not , how one can determine the upper critical field @xmath6 .",
    "@xcite another question is whether the @xmath1 data can be used to derive a characteristic field for the closing of the pseudogap by the zeeman splitting .",
    "@xcite    it was argued by morozov _",
    "_ @xcite that @xmath7 separates the two regions in the superconducting state , one dominated by cooper pair tunneling and the other dominated by quasiparticle tunneling",
    ". this proposal has been backed up by more recent argument @xcite and it seems indeed likely that @xmath7 signifies a crossover from a phase - coherent regime ( where the @xmath0-axis transport is dominated by the cooper pair tunneling ) to a phase - incoherent regime . in this sense , if one assumes that the phase coherence is the defining factor for the superconducting state in cuprates , one can identify that @xmath7 is the characteristic field for superconductivity , although it clearly lies below the mean - field @xmath6 which describes the onset of superconducting pair correlations .",
    "( therefore , whether to call the region between @xmath7 and @xmath6 the  normal state \" is a matter of semantics ;  fully resistive state \" might better suit this regime that is so strikingly different from the normal state of bcs superconductors . )    later , shibauchi _ et al . _ argued @xcite that the negative mr data above @xmath7 can be used to estimate the field at which the pseudogap collapses due to the increasing zeeman energy , calling this field the pseudogap closing field @xmath10 .",
    "although their procedure relies on determining the putative intrinsic @xmath11 in the absence of the pseudogap and a necessary extrapolation to determine a value for @xmath10 , their central assertion is that the negative mr comes from a recovery of the electronic density of states near the fermi energy @xmath13 that is suppressed in the pseudogap state .",
    "the work by shibauchi _",
    "@xcite was done on bi@xmath2sr@xmath2cacu@xmath2o@xmath14 ( bi-2212 ) for which the intrinsically high @xmath8 makes the measurements and the analysis inherently difficult ; it would be useful to examine @xmath10 in another cuprate that has lower @xmath8 and thus is expected to have lower characteristic magnetic - field scales . from this point of view , the bi@xmath2sr@xmath3la@xmath4cuo@xmath5 ( bslco ) system is particularly suitable for examining the behavior of @xmath1 , because the @xmath8 of this system never exceeds 40 k and one can obtain high - quality single crystal samples for a wide range of hole doping .",
    "@xcite    recently , it was shown that the nernst effect in cuprates is a useful probe of the presence of vortices and , hence , superconducting correlations , @xcite from which wang _ et al .",
    "_ deduced the pseudogap onset temperature above @xmath8 ( ref . ) and @xmath6 below @xmath8 ( ref . ) .",
    "in particular , recent nernst effect measurements in magnetic fields up to 45 t make a very good case @xcite that the vortex nernst signal disappears above a well - defined field @xmath15 and it is reasonable to consider that @xmath15 marks the field where the superconducting pair correlations disappear , _",
    "i.e. _ , the upper critical field .",
    "therefore , it would be illuminating to compare the information obtained by @xmath11 measurements with that obtained by nernst effect measurements .",
    "the bslco system is ideal for this purpose as well , because detailed nernst effect measurements have already been performed on bslco .",
    "@xcite    in this work , we measure @xmath11 of a series of high - quality bslco single crystals in pulsed magnetic fields up to 58 t and examine the implication of the observed @xmath1 behavior in the context of nernst effect measurements that were performed on the samples from the same batch .",
    "it is found that the doping dependence of @xmath7 essentially tracks that of @xmath8 , and , moreover , there is an approximate relation @xmath16 ( in kelvin ) @xmath17 ( in tesla ) , which suggests that the electronic zeeman energy at @xmath7 ( @xmath18 ) equals the thermal energy @xmath19 .",

    "@xcite , width=302 ]    next we examine whether the present data for @xmath1 can be used to deduce the pseudogap closing field @xmath10 .",
    "according to the procedure proposed by shibauchi _",
    "et al._,@xcite one first determines the putative @xmath11 in the _ absence _ of the pseudogap , @xmath35 , @xcite by linearly extrapolating the high - temperature part of @xmath27 where it shows a metallic behavior ( @xmath39 ) . as shown in fig .",
    "3(a ) , for our overdoped sample ( @xmath20 = 0.18 ) , such an extrapolation gives @xmath35 of about 3 m@xmath40 cm at low temperature .",
    "one then calculates @xmath41 and fits the high - field part of @xmath42 with an empirical formula @xcite @xmath43 ; extrapolation of this fit to @xmath36 = 0 gives the estimate of @xmath10 in the manner of shibauchi _ et al .",
    "_ when applied to our @xmath20 = 0.18 data , this analysis gives an estimate of @xmath10 of about 600 t [ see fig .",
    "3(b ) ] , which is almost certainly too high for an overdoped sample and suggests the inapplicability of the procedure proposed by shibauchi _ et al . _ for determining @xmath10 , at least for the bslco system .",
    "the reason for the inapplicability probably lies in the assumptions used to determine @xmath35 : as we have shown in our previous paper , @xcite the  insulating \" temperature dependence of @xmath11 comes not only from the pseudogap but also from the charge confinement effect .",
    "because of the existence of the latter , the assumption of a @xmath44-linear @xmath35 down to the lowest temperature becomes dubious .",
    "therefore , we claim that any determination of @xmath10 from resistivity data should not rely on any assumptions about @xmath35 or @xmath1 .     of the la - free sample at selected temperatures ; here the data are mildly filtered to remove the high - frequency noise apparent in the raw data shown in fig .",
    "the solid lines are linear fits of the high - field data .",
    "arrows mark the field above which the @xmath1 shows a near - saturation and thus would corresponds to @xmath10 .",
    "( f ) temperature dependence of @xmath10 obtained from the above method.,width=283 ]    incidentally , the @xmath1 data of our la - free sample ( whose @xmath20 value has been estimated @xcite to be 0.17 ) shows a behavior that is almost saturating at high field even at the lowest temperature .",
    "this is probably because this sample has the lowest @xmath8 ( @xmath21 = 9.1 k and @xmath22 = 10.2 k ) and accordingly low magnetic field scales .",
    "as one can see in figs .",
    "4(a)-4(e ) , the high - field @xmath11 is saturating to a value which increases with decreasing temperature , indicating that the true @xmath35 presents an  insulating \" behavior ( @xmath45 ) even when the pseudogap is closed by the magnetic field . also , one can crudely estimate @xmath10 from this near - saturation as shown by the arrows in figs .",
    "4(a)-4(d ) .",
    "[ the solid straight lines are the fits to the region where we consider the rapid decrease of @xmath11 is finished ; these lines at low temperatures are slightly sloped , which may mean that there is some intrinsic negative mr in the absence of the pseudogap or mean that the pseudogap is not yet fully closed . ] intriguingly , while there is no negative mr ( and thus there appears to be no pseudogap ) at 40 k , by 30 k the pseudogap opens and the @xmath10 suggested by the data is already higher than 30 t.    it is useful to note that if one were to apply the same method of extracting @xmath10 that we demonstrated for the la - free sample to the data for @xmath20 = 0.18 , the estimated @xmath10 would be larger than 60 t , because there is no saturation below 60 t [ see fig .",
    "this might seem rather odd , since the doping level in the la - free sample is @xmath20 = 0.17 , which is slightly more underdoped than @xmath20 = 0.18 , and yet the estimated @xmath10 for the la - free sample would be smaller than that for @xmath20 = 0.18 ; normally , one would expect @xmath10 to be larger in more underdoped samples .",
    "however , one must take into account the fact that the @xmath8 of the la - free samples is significantly lower than that of the la - doped samples at the same doping level , which strongly suggests that there exists some additional pair - breaking mechanism in the la - free samples .",
    "remember , as has been argued by shibauchi _",
    ", @xcite @xmath10 is likely to reflect the spin singlet formation ; thus , if there is an additional pair - breaking mechanism in the la - free sample , it is rather natural for @xmath10 to become accordingly small . a recent work by eisaki _ et al . _",
    "@xcite reported a clear relationship between @xmath8 and the cation disorder in the sr site ( @xmath46-site disorder ) for the single - layer bi - based cuprates , so that the strong @xmath46-site disorder caused by excess bi in the la - free samples is likely to be responsible for the strong pair breaking .",
    "we measure and examine the behavior of @xmath1 for a series of bslco samples in magnetic fields up to 58 t. the salient points are : ( i ) the peak field in the zero - temperature limit , @xmath32 , shows a dome - shaped doping dependence and is related to @xmath8 via the relation @xmath47 , which is understandable if both @xmath8 and @xmath32 are determined by the onset of phase coherence .",
    "( ii ) there is no feature in the @xmath1 data at the upper critical field determined by the nernst effect , @xmath15 .",
    "( iii ) the pseudogap closing field @xmath10 can be determined by @xmath1 in overdoped samples with low @xmath8 , but one should not employ an extrapolation of high - temperature @xmath27 to low temperatures in its determination , because one can not _ a priori _ know the temperature dependence of the @xmath0-axis resistivity in the absence of the pseudogap .    the work at criepi was supported in part by the grant - in - aid for science provided by the japanese society for the promotion of science .",
