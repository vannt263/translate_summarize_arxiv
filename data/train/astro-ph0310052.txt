    "_ hst_/nicmos ( nic1 with pol0s , pol120s , and pol240s filters ) during cycle 11 ( go 9377 ) .",
    "our main objective was to study the dust distribution in these _ optically thin _",
    "ppn shells around the bright central star .",
    "imaging polarimetry ( e.g. , gledhill et al .",
    "2001 ) is a very effective technique for this purpose because ( 1 ) bright stellar emission ( unpolarized component ) is automatically removed when the linearly polarized component ( i.e. , dust - scattered star light of the reflection nebula ) is computed from the stokes @xmath0 and @xmath1 parameters , ( 2 ) the dust distribution in the reflection nebula can be probed at high resolution as opposed to the mid - ir diffraction - limit resolution , and ( 3 ) dust properties ( e.g. , the size distribution ) can also be investigated .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows imaging polarimetry data for iras 07134 + 1005 ( left ) and iras 06530 - 0213 ( right ) .",
    "the iras 07134 + 1005 data illustrate the distribution and strength of polarization .",
    "the four frames display , from top left to bottom right , the total intensity ( the stokes @xmath2 ) , the polarized intensity ( @xmath3 ) , the degree of polarization ( @xmath4 ) , and the 10.3 @xmath5 m gemini image ( kwok et al .",
    "2002 ) for comparison .",
    "the total and polarized intensity images look similar , suggesting that the nebula emission consists mostly of scattered star light as expected in this reflection nebula .",
    "the total intensity image confirms the equatorially enhanced ( toroidal ) structure of the shell as seen in the 10.3 @xmath5 m image and also shows the structure _ within _ the reflection nebula in an unprecedented detail .",
    "such detailed structure of the shell was not seen well in _",
    "hst_/wfpc2 data due to the invasively bright central star and its enormous psf spikes ( ueta et al .",
    "2001 ) .    in the iras 06530 - 0213 data",
    ", the distribution and angles of polarization vectors are displayed .",
    "the four frames shows the the polarized intensity , the distribution of polarization vectors of less than 30% ( @xmath6 ) strengths , of 30 to 40% strengths , and of more than 40% strengths , from top left to bottom right .",
    "the vectors are distributed in a clear centro - symmetric pattern with respect to the central star .",
    "this confirms the optically thin nature of this ppn shell .",
    "it is also apparent that the stronger polarization is found near the edge of the shell .",
    "this is because dust - scattered light near the nebula edge tends to have near 90@xmath7 scattering angle , and hence , tends to yield the highest degree of polarization .",
    "our data yielded rather high degrees of polarization in our target ppns .",
    "this may be due to a population of small dust grains residing in these shells .",
    "we are currently finalizing our data analysis , and the results would shed light on the ppn shell structure as well as the properties of dust grains present in ppns .",
    "support for go-9377 was provided by nasa through a grant from the stsci , which is operated by the aura , inc .",
    ", under nasa contract nas 5 - 26555 .",
    "ueta was also supported by iuap p5/36 financed by the ostc of the belgian federal state ."
