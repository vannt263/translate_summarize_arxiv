    "the long unsolved problem of asymmetries in magellanic type spirals has come under increased scrutiny due to recent kinematic studies of the large and small magellanic clouds ( lmc and smc ) .",
    "these studies also showed that an interaction with the smc passing close to the center of the lmc is the most probable cause of the off centered stellar bar @xcite .",
    "off - center or `` offset bars '' are a characteristic feature in late - type spiral galaxies and in particular magellanic types @xcite  the usual definition of an offset bar is a stellar bar whose photometric center is offset from the photometric center of the outer isophotes of a galaxy disk .",
    "off - centered stellar bars coupled with remnant spiral structure could contribute to asymmetries in a stellar disk ",
    "asymmetrical stellar disks are often referred to as `` lopsided '' disks .",
    "however , a recent study of lopsidedness in 167 galaxies by @xcite from the _ spitzer _  survey of stellar structure in galaxies ( s@xmath1 g ) @xcite , found that lopsidedness is a generic feature of disks . while the lopsidedness is correlated with the strength of the spiral pattern it is _ not _ correlated with the presence of a stellar bar .",
    "@xcite specifically note that a stellar bar is neither the cause of lopsidedness nor is the lopsidedness giving rise to the formation of a stellar bar .",
    "numerical simulations of barred galaxies have shown that a bar may become off - centered through from its disk via an interaction of a small companion @xcite .",
    "@xcite investigated possible evolutionary scenarios that show that an off - center bar with some degree of spiral structure can form in the lmc if a galaxy collides with a low - mass galactic subhalo corresponding to only a few per cent of the total mass of the lmc .",
    "these subhaloes were referred to as ` dark satellites ' since they may have no or little visible matter . @xcite claimed that dark satellites with masses in the range of @xmath3@xmath4  can strongly disturb the disk of low mass galaxies such as the lmc .",
    "however there are many isolated magellanic galaxies . in a vla study",
    ", @xcite found only two of thirteen magellanics were clearly interacting with their neighbor .",
    "they argued that in most cases the asymmetry in barred magellanic spirals can not be explained by on - going interactions with a companion galaxy or by environment .",
    "this earlier result was put on solid ground with the larger s@xmath1 g  study by @xcite .",
    "so the offset bars , which are a common feature of magellanics , may be a long lived feature that is caused by some other process .",
    "@xcite suggested that the asymmetry in a disk may suggest that it is a `` protogalaxy '' that might be forming a bar as well .",
    "ngc  3906 is an ideal case to study these odd properties of a disk and an offset bar in detail .",
    "classified as a magellanic type face - on spiral , ngc  3906 hosts a displaced stellar bar from what appears to be an otherwise _ undisturbed _ circular stellar disk , showing no signature of any tidal interaction at ultra - violet and optical wavelengths .",
    "a search with nasa s extragalactic database reveals that the closest companions to ngc  3906 are located 14 - 16@xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) away .",
    "@xcite mapped the distribution of neutral hydrogen gas in ngc  3906 and found a very circular hi disk similar to that seen at the other wavelengths .",
    "there was no evidence of tidal tails or streams which suggests that the off - centered bar in ngc  3906 is likely not from any on - going interaction of the galaxy with any nearby galaxies .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the origin of the off - centered bar in ngc  3906 using 3.6 and @xmath7 m imaging from the _ spitzer _  survey of stellar structure in galaxies ( s@xmath1g)@xcite .",
    "these observations allow us to peer through the layers of dust so that we are looking at the dominant older stellar population in the galaxy .",
    "the observations and basic properties of the galaxy are described in  2 .",
    "more clues to the structure of ngc  3906 are obtained from the photometry of the _ spitzer _  3.6 and @xmath7 m images . these results are presented in  3 together with the properties of the stellar bar .",
    ".properties of ngc  3906 .",
    "[ ngc3906_param ] [ cols= \" < , > \" , ]     the extended stellar disk of the galaxy is best modeled using a srsic function with an effective radius of @xmath8 and index @xmath9 .",
    "perturbations were introduced in to the model in the form of the azimuthal @xmath10 fourier mode to obtain a measure of the asymmetry of the stellar disk . in face - on systems ( inclinations of @xmath11 ) such as ngc  3906 , the amplitude of the fourier @xmath10 mode ( @xmath12 ) is an excellent indicator of lopsidedness of the disk @xcite .",
    "the projection effects are minimized in these low inclination galaxies so that the apparent structure of the disk is revealed .",
    "the 3.6@xmath0 m image of ngc  3906 allows for the measurement of the fourier @xmath12 amplitude in the extended stellar disk out to at least three times the effective radius of the disk .",
    "an amplitude of @xmath13 was measured for the disk component using multigalfit , consistent with the @xcite measurement in the outer disk as shown in their figure 6 .",
    "@xcite measured a mean fourier @xmath10 amplitude of 0.1 for a sample of 149 spiral galaxies in the near - infrared with values above this threshold indicating lopsidedness .",
    "@xcite have done the same for 167 face - on galaxies from s@xmath1gas noted earlier . compared to other disks ,",
    "ngc 3906 shows a modest amount of lopsidedness in its outer disk but as @xcite note the lopsidedness is typically uncorrelated with the presence of the bar .    by making a cut perpendicular to the bar and through the photometric center of the galaxy ( given in table  [ phot_param ] ) the symmetry of the disk",
    "could be further investigated .",
    "the opposite sides of the one - dimensional cut about the photometric center are plotted in fig .",
    "[ ngc3906_cut ] where the strongest peak in the intensity distribution corresponds to the bar itself on the northern side of the galaxy .",
    "the intensity peak at a radius of @xmath14 coincides with the spiral arm feature in the northern part of the stellar disk .",
    "the technique of unsharp masking @xcite was applied to the @xmath15 m s@xmath1 g  image to reveal underlying structure in the stellar disk .",
    "the features are detected by dividing the original galaxy image by a smoothed image of the galaxy .",
    "the unsharp mask for ngc  3906 was produced by smoothing the @xmath15 m galaxy image with an elliptical gaussian of kernel size @xmath16 pixels .",
    "figure  [ ngc3906_unsharp ] shows the residual image of ngc  3906 after carrying out the unsharp masking .",
    "the stellar bar and inner disk can be clearly seen in the residual image .",
    "a single bright dominant spiral arm is seen to originate from the east side of the bar and winds in a clockwise direction in the disk .",
    "fainter arms can be seen extending from the bar edges from both the east and west regions of the bar .",
    "the fainter arms eventually merge with the dominant spiral form .",
    "the asymmetric spiral structure is seen as the unsharp mask makes prominent the single , bright spiral arm ( as opposed to symmetric grand design spiral arms ) .",
    "this is characteristic in late - type spirals and magellanic - type galaxies @xcite .",
    "however it is unclear what phenomenon gives rise to these types of spiral features typical in late - type magellanic systems .",
    "the mass of the individual stellar components were calculated from the total fluxes measured from multigalfit .",
    "the luminosity of each stellar component was determined using the zero point flux of 280.9  jy for irac channel 1 @xcite and an absolute magnitude of @xmath17 for the sun in the irac @xmath15m - band @xcite .",
    "both the lmc and ngc  3906 are late - type disk galaxies having similar morphology and stellar populations .",
    "the mass - to - light ( @xmath18 ) ratio obtained for the lmc was therefore adopted when transforming luminosity in to mass in ngc  3906 .",
    "the @xmath18 of 0.5 for the lmc from @xcite was used to derive the mass for the stellar components listed in table  [ galfit_param ] .",
    "these results show that ngc  3906 has a massive disk in which the bar and inner disk contribute to less than @xmath19 to the mass of the extended stellar disk . adding the mass estimates of the three stellar components and the  mass in table  [ ngc3906_param ]",
    "gives a total baryonic mass of @xmath20 for ngc  3906 which is comparable to the mass estimates obtained for the lmc and other barred magellanic spirals in @xcite .",
    "tidal interactions remain as the most likely explanation for the offset between the kinematic and photometric centers of ngc 3906 .",
    "new numerical simulations from our team are finding that an interaction with a body at least 1/10th the mass of the main galaxy is needed to create the observed offset ( pardy et al .",
    "2015 , in preparation ) , consistent with previous studies @xcite .",
    "however the main problem for ngc 3906 is that observations in a wide range of wavelengths rule out a nearby companions .",
    "this is also the case for many other magellanics with offset bars @xcite .",
    "an interaction with a dark companion such as a dark matter sub - halos could explain the offset as suggested by @xcite but the constraints on the type of collision required may be that the companion galaxy has to pass close to the center of the main galaxy ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we are currently studying the precise range of interaction / merger parameters that can lead to an offset bar to constrain the nature of the dark matter substructure .",
    "we are also investigating how long the observed offset can last in different types of collisions to better constrain the evolution of this system .",
    "ngc 3906 is also a lopsided disk with the strongest asymmetry in the inner parts evidently from the offset between the bar and the disk . @xcite",
    "have already shown that the general class of asymmetries ( m=1 fourier modes ) is too common to exist from purely interaction events .",
    "the asymmetry must also be long lived since it is commonly observed .",
    "noordemeer et al ( 2001 ) and levine & sparke ( 1998 ) have argued that long - lived lopsidedness may occur if the stellar disk is off - center from a galaxy s dark matter halo .",
    "however , they do not provide any reason or mechanism which would cause the disk to be displaced in the first place .",
    "secular and internal processes such as gas accretion can also lead to lopsidedness in the disk @xcite .",
    "images from s@xmath1 g  of ngc  3906 reveal a strikingly odd offset between the stellar bar and the underlying stellar disk .",
    "analysis of the s@xmath1 g  data and vla hi data reveal that , unlike the lmc , the hi kinematic center is coincident with the bar , but is offset from the photometric center of the stellar disk by @xmath2720 pc .",
    "investigation of the bar structure using ellipse fits and a full 2-d decomposition using multigalfit using a bar , inner and outer disk components reveals a strong 1.4 kpc bar ( q@xmath21 = 0.74 ) containing @xmath210% of the total baryonic mass ( m@xmath22 3 @xmath23 10@xmath24 @xmath4 ) of the galaxy .",
    "residual images of the galaxy also show the presence of asymmetric spiral structure . given the lack of any nearby companions , a likely explanation for",
    "the offset may be an interaction with a dark matter sub halo .",
    "we are carrying out new simulations to create the observed offsets and find that a companion with at least 1/10th the mass of the disk is needed .",
    "we are currently studying the lifetime of the offset to better constrain the likely evolution of this system .",
    "other observations have shown that many magellanic systems with offset bars are also similarly isolated and therefore may offer a unique probes for the structure of the dark matter halo if collisions with dark matter sub halos are responsible for offset bars .",
