    "in the standard model ( sm ) of elementary particle interactions , breaking of electroweak symmetry is achieved through the higgs mechanism .",
    "the simplest realization is provided by the introduction of a complex higgs doublet , which leads to the presence of a neutral cp - even higgs boson @xmath0 in the physical spectrum",
    ". this state has not been observed , but a good theoretical description of the precision electroweak data @xcite within the sm requires the higgs boson to be lighter than about 200 gev  @xcite .",
    "although it can be argued that there are internal inconsistencies in the data  @xcite that may demand the presence of new physics  @xcite , the sm with a light higgs boson provides a surprisingly good description of the data . this success has induced an overwhelming preference for weakly interacting extensions of the sm , incorporating a light higgs boson in a natural way , in comparison with heavy higgs boson models in which the effect of the large higgs boson mass in the oblique corrections is compensated by new physics contributions  @xcite .    among the possible extensions of the sm ,",
    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) has been considered most seriously .",
    "the minimal realization of the higgs mechanism within supersymmetric extensions of the standard model requires the presence of two higgs doublets at low energies . in most regions of the supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking parameter space , the lightest neutral cp - even higgs particle @xmath1 resembles the sm higgs boson in many of its properties  @xcite .",
    "searches for experimental manifestations of the higgs states are a central motivation for the experimental programs at the fermilab tevatron and the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) , with experimental detection techniques guided by theoretical expectations about the anticipated properties of these states .    within the mssm ,",
    "the upper bound on the mass of the lightest higgs state is roughly 135 gev  @xcite . for higgs boson masses @xmath2 between 115 and 135 gev ,",
    "the total sm decay width is predicted to grow from about 3 to about 6 mev  @xcite . at @xmath3 gev ,",
    "the principal decay mode is into a pair of bottom quarks @xmath4 , with about 69% branching fraction ; this sm branching fraction drops to about 34% at @xmath5 gev while branching fractions into weak boson decays increase . in weakly interacting extensions of the sm ,",
    "it is natural to assume that the light sm - like higgs boson state has decay branching ratios similar to those in the sm .",
    "this expectation may be modified easily under the presence of light particles , weakly coupled to the weak gauge bosons , but strongly coupled to the higgs field .",
    "the resulting higgs boson decay properties will depend on the rates for decay to these new particles .",
    "for instance , the possible decay of the higgs boson into stable neutral particles , such as neutralinos in the mssm or neutrinos within models of extra dimensions , may lead to a higgs particle with mainly invisible decays  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the higgs boson may decay predominantly into hadronic jets , without any particular bottom or charm content . in this article",
    ", we consider scenarios which lead to this latter possibility .",
    "direct experimental searches at the cern large electron positron collider ( lep ) place the mass of a sm - like higgs state , with a significant decay branching ratio into bottom ( @xmath6 ) quarks , above approximately 115 gev  @xcite .",
    "an alternative analysis , based only on the assumption of higgs boson decay into hadronic jets , without @xmath6-tagging , leads to a bound of about 113 gev  @xcite . in this article",
    ", we explore in detail the possible detection of such a higgs boson at future hadron and lepton colliders .",
    "a higgs boson with a dominant effective decay branching ratio into jets may be obtained within the mssm , under the assumption of the presence of light bottom squarks in the spectrum .",
    "the possible existence of bottom squarks @xmath7 with low masses is advanced in several recent papers  @xcite .",
    "bottom squarks are the spin-0 , charge -1/3 , and color triplet supersymmetric partners of bottom quarks .",
    "interestingly , very small @xmath7 masses on the order of 10 gev may be compatible with existing measurements  @xcite . within susy theories , a light bottom squark is obtained most readily for large values of @xmath8  @xcite , the ratio of neutral higgs field vacuum expectation values , and we work in this limit .",
    "moderate to high values of @xmath8 are further motivated by the fact that experiments at lep ii did not find conclusive evidence of the light susy higgs boson ; such values are favored in order that the predicted mass of the higgs boson remain above the value excluded experimentally  @xcite .",
    "we restrict @xmath9 , as for larger values the bottom quark couplings to some of the higgs particles can be strong enough that perturbation theory breaks down . within the light bottom squark scenario ,",
    "the dominant higgs decay is into a pair of bottom squarks @xmath10  @xcite that , in turn , manifest themselves as jets of hadrons .",
    "the total width is predicted to increase by a factor of ten to several hundred , depending upon the value of @xmath8 .",
    "since the couplings to sm particles remain approximately unchanged , the upshot is that branching fractions into conventional decay modes ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) are all reduced by a corresponding factor .    in order to fix the framework , we concentrate for the most part on the particular example of a light bottom squark . while details of our approach depend on the existence of low mass @xmath7 s , the principal conclusions are illustrative of the challenges to be faced if the dominant decays of a light higgs state , with @xmath18 gev , are into hadronic jets without specific flavor tags . in sec .",
    "ii , we summarize salient aspects of the phenomenology of bottom squarks , including constraints on their couplings , and we review available experimental bounds . in sec .",
    "iii , we compute the higgs boson width for decay into a pair of bottom squarks as well as the influence of bottom squarks in loop processes that describe decay into other final states . the decay width into the gluon - gluon @xmath14 final state is enhanced as is the partonic production cross section @xmath19 .",
    "we show that decay to a pair of bottom squarks is by far the dominant decay mode of the higgs boson for large values of @xmath20 . since the sm decay couplings are essentially unaffected , the total decay width of the higgs boson is increased and the branching fractions into the sm decay modes",
    "are decreased accordingly . except for the gluon fusion process ,",
    "the higgs boson production rates are not enhanced in hadron collisions and in electron - positron annihilation processes . as we discuss in sec .",
    "iv , dominant decay into bottom squarks that materialize as hadronic jets makes it much more difficult , if not impossible , to discover the higgs boson at a hadron collider .",
    "the possibilities at an electron - positron linear colliders are examined in sec .",
    "v where we demonstrate that it remains possible to discover the higgs boson and to measure its mass and several of its coupling strengths .",
    "light bottom squarks are discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of an explanation for the large bottom quark production cross section at hadron colliders . in that work , a light gluino",
    "is also postulated with 100% branching fraction into a bottom quark and a bottom squark . in this discussion of higgs boson decay",
    ", we need not assume a light gluino since there is a direct coupling of the higgs boson to a pair of bottom squarks .",
    "the bottom squark is the lsp , the susy particle with lowest mass .",
    "it may decay promptly through baryon - number and @xmath21-parity violating interactions into light quarks  @xcite , or it could be stable on collider time scales  @xcite .",
    "the least model - dependent statement one can make is that at high energies the @xmath7 is likely to manifest itself experimentally as a jet of hadrons in the detector .",
    "if we introduce somewhat more model - dependent assumptions about decay modes of the @xmath7 , identification of the higgs boson at hadron colliders could be facilitated if jets containing charm and/or leading baryons can be identified cleanly .",
    "the lighter bottom squark is a mixture of the scalar partners of the left- and right - chiral bottom quarks .",
    "after susy breaking and electroweak symmetry breaking , the mass matrix for bottom squarks in the weak eigenstate basis is [ eq : massmatrix ] (    cc m^2_q + m_b^2 + d_l & m_b + m_b & m^2_b + m_b^2 + d_r    ) , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the susy - breaking masses for the third family squark doublet and down - type singlet , respectively , @xmath24 is the susy - breaking interaction term for the higgs boson and bottom squarks , @xmath25 is the bottom quark mass , @xmath26 is the higgsino mass parameter , and @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the @xmath29-terms for the bottom quark sector , given by @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively .",

    "there are important constraints on couplings of the bottom squarks from precise measurements of @xmath43 decays .",
    "a light @xmath44 would be ruled out unless its coupling to the @xmath43 is very small .",
    "the squark couplings to the @xmath43 depend on the mixing angle @xmath45 . as described in ref .",
    "@xcite , the lowest - order ( tree - level ) coupling of @xmath40 to the @xmath43 can be arranged to vanish when @xmath46 .",
    "an interesting conclusion of ref .",
    "@xcite is that in order to obtain appropriately small oblique corrections , in addition to a light bottom squark , a light top squark with mass @xmath47 gev is required . in the remainder of this paper",
    ", we use @xmath7 without a subscript to denote the lighter bottom squark .",
    "bottom squarks make a small contribution to the inclusive cross section for @xmath48 hadrons , in comparison to the contributions from quark production , and @xmath49 resonances are difficult to extract from backgrounds in @xmath50 annihilation  @xcite .",
    "the angular distribution of hadronic jets produced in @xmath50 annihilation can be examined in order to bound the contribution of scalar - quark production .",
    "spin-1/2 quarks and spin-0 squarks emerge with different distributions , @xmath51 , respectively . within the limits of current experimental sensitivity , the angular distribution measured by the cello collaboration",
    "@xcite is consistent with the production of a single pair of charge-1/3 squarks along with five flavors of quark - antiquark pairs .",

    "the @xmath7 ( as a color triplet scalar ) contributes little to the running , equivalent to one quarter of a new flavor of quark and can not be excluded with the current data @xcite .",
    "the exclusion by the cleo collaboration  @xcite of a @xmath44 with mass 3.5 to 4.5 gev does not apply since their analysis focuses only on the decays @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the @xmath44 need not decay leptonically nor into charm .",
    "in the standard model , a higgs boson of mass below @xmath59 gev , as is always the case for the lightest higgs boson in the mssm , decays predominantly into pairs of bottom quarks , @xmath60 . the sm prediction for the partial width is @xmath61 where @xmath25 is the @xmath62 bottom quark mass , evaluated at the mass @xmath2 of the higgs boson , @xmath63 is the mass of the @xmath64 boson , and @xmath65 is the @xmath66 coupling strength .",

    "in susy theories at large values of @xmath8 , there can be important loop - effects ( enhanced by @xmath8 ) that affect the couplings of the bottom quark to the higgs bosons  @xcite .",
    "the couplings to the higgs mass eigenstates may be determined from the couplings to the weak eigenstates , y_b h_d^0 b + y_b h_u^0 b , where @xmath75 is the tree - level coupling of the bottom quark to the real part of the neutral components of the down - type higgs field @xmath76",

    "on the other hand , for large values of @xmath20 , the coupling of light bottom squarks to the light higgs boson in the decoupling limit is governed by the presence of a tree - level coupling of the bottom squarks to @xmath83 , g_h b ^ * 2 _ b , where we have neglected subdominant terms in @xmath8 .",
