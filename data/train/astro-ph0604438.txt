    "0.2 cm    a noteworthy feature seen in figure 5b is the dip in the mean light curve of the 6.7-h period at phase 1 .",
    "its reliability was checked by subtracting a pure sinusoidal with a peak - to - peak amplitude of 0.20 mag from the folded and binned data , resulting in a distribution of the points around zero level .",

    "we suggest that @xmath11 is the orbital period of the underlying binary system .",
    "our conclusion is supported by the fact that this period was present in both light curves in 2003 and 2005 , with no apparent change in its value .",

    "a similar behavior was observed in two other novae , v838 her and v1494  aql .",
    "leibowitz et al . ( 1992 ) performed photometric observations of nova v838 herculis 1991 .",
    "they detected eclipses with a period of 7.1 h in the light curve and thus interpreted the periodicity as the obital period .",
    "they also found that the eclipse depth increased from about 0.1 mag in 1991 april to more than 0.4 mag in 1991 july .",
    "bos et al . ( 2002 ) analyzed photometry of nova v1494 aql 1999 # 2 during 12 nights in 2001 .",
    "they found that the eclipse depth of the 3.2-h period was 10 times larger than in mid-2000 . both leibowtiz et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and bos et al .",
    "( 2002 ) interpreted the phenomenon as an eclipse of the accretion disk by the secondary star .",
    "similarly , we propose to explain the 6.7-h variation in the light curve of v4743  sgr as an eclipse of the accretion disk by the companion star or as a combination of an eclipse and aspect variations of the side of the comparison star , which is heated by the white dwarf ( see also balman , retter & bos 2006 ) .    within the errors , @xmath12 is the beat period between the orbital period and the spin period , which we take as the mean of the two values given for the x - ray period ( ness et al .",
    "2003 ; orio & tepedelenlioglu 2004 ) : 1344 @xmath7 21 sec @xmath0 22 min .",
    "ness et al . ( 2003 ) argued that the 22-min period could either be a pulsation or a spin period .",
    "however , if this periodicity represents the pulsation of the hot white dwarf , it should change as the temperature of the white dwarf cools down ( e.g. , somer & naylor 1999 ) .",
    "we estimated the ratio of the luminosity in 2003 april ( when the x - ray period was detected ) to 2005 june ( when our observations ended ) . using the relation between the luminosity and temperature of the white dwarf ( eq . 21 in prialnik 1986 ) , we estimated the change in the effective temperature .",
    "then , we calculated the expected change in the frequency from the relation between frequency and temperature for stellar oscillations ( eq . 10 in kjeldsen & bedding 1995 )",
    "thus , we estimated that , if interpreted as a pulsation , the 22-min period , which was found in 2003 april , should have increased to about 38 min in 2005 june . since we did not detect any periodicity around 38 min , we believe that the 22-min period found in the x - ray band is the spin period , and not a pulsation period .",
    "wagner et al . ( 2003 ) reported continuous photometric observations of v4743 sgr using a @xmath6-band during three nights in 2003 july .",
    "in addition to the presence of the long - term period of 6.7 h , they argued that another periodicity of 69 min existed in the data .",
    "our observations could not confirm the presence of such a coherent period ( section 3 ) , thus we believe that this is a quasi - periodicity .",
    "0.3 cm      the am her stars ( magnetic cvs ) differ from the non - magnetic systems in two important qualitative respects : ( 1 ) a strong magnetic field on the primary star funnels the infalling gas onto one or two localized accretion shocks near the white dwarf s magnetic pole(s ) , where x - ray bremsstrahlung and polarized optical / infrared cyclotron emission arise ; and ( 2 ) the white dwarf spin and binary orbital motions are locked in a rigid corotating geometry ( e.g. , schmidt & stockman 1991 ) .",
    "intermediate polars ( also known as dq her stars ) are binary systems , which are a subclass of the am her stars . unlike in other members of the am her class , in intermediate polars the rotation of the primary white dwarf",
    "is not synchronized with the orbital motion of the binary system .",
    "the spin periods found in intermediate polars are usually much shorter than their orbital periods ( patterson 1994 ; hellier 1996 ) .",
    "one of the major observational characteristics of intermediate polars is the presence of multiple periodicities in the power spectra of their light curves , emanating from the non - synchronous rotation of the primary with the orbital revolution .",
    "in fact , this characteristic has become , together with the presence of x - ray modulations , a major criterion for membership in the intermediate polar group .",
    "we found several characteristics of the intermediate polars in v4743 sgr .",
    "first , we detected several periodicities in the light curve .",
    "second , the orbital period ( 6.7 h ) is much longer than the spin period ( 22 min ) .",
    "third , the spin period was found in x - ray observations .",
    "fourth , the short term periodicity @xmath10 shows up about where it should be for an orbital sideband of the x - ray pulse ( see above ) . finally , the orbital period and the spin period roughly fit the relation @xmath16 @xmath0 0.1@xmath17 , which applies to many other known intermediate polars ( norton , wynn , & somerscales 2004 ) .",
    "we thus suggest that v4743 sgr should be classified as an intermediate polar .",
    "0.3 cm      the optical light curves of classical novae are typically characterized by a smooth decline . however , certain novae show a deep minimum in the light curve while others have slow oscillations with amplitudes of 12 mag typically a few weeks  months after maximum , during the so called ` transition phase ' .",
    "the deep minimum ( e.g. , in dq her 1934  walker 1958 ) is understood by the formation of an optically thick dust envelope around the binary system .",
    "several models for the oscillations during the transition phase have been proposed : oscillations of the common envelope , dwarf - nova outbursts , pulsations of the hot white dwarf , and winds , but there is still not enough observational evidence to understand this phenomenon ( see retter 2002 for a review ) .",
    "retter ( 2002 ) argued that the explanation by oscillations of the common envelope can be easily rejected since this phase lasts only about 12 days after the nova event .",
    "he further concluded that dwarf nova outbursts can be ruled out as well because the accretion disks in young post - novae are thermally stable ( e.g. , retter & naylor 2000 ; schreiber , gansicke , & cannizzo 2000 ) .",
    "shaviv ( 2001 ) proposed that steady - state winds of systems with super eddington luminosities can be a natural explanation for the transition phase , and showed that a steady - state super eddington stage could be maintained in a few novae .",
    "retter , liller , & gerradd ( 2000b ) observed lz mus , a nova that erupted in 1998 , and clearly showed oscillations during the transition phase .",
    "they found several periods in its light curve .",
    "therefore , they suggested that lz  mus is an intermediate polar system .",
    "they further proposed a new solution to the transition phase in novae by invoking a possible connection between the transition phase and intermediate polars .",
    "it was also found that lz mus was a strong x - ray source in 2001 , which is consistent with the idea that the white dwarf has a strong magnetic field ( hernanz & sala 2002 ) .",
    "retter ( 2002 ) argued that the observations are consistent with the proposed link between the transition phase in novae and intermediate polars . for examples ,",
    "nova gk per 1901 showed transition phase oscillations .",
    "its orbital period was found in optical observations and the spin period was detected in x - ray observations ( bianchini & sabadin 1983 ) .",
    "v603 aql 1918 was another transition - oscillation nova .",
    "it was suggested several times as an intermediate polar and showed strong variations in its x - ray light curve .",
    "however , there has been an extended discussion whether this nova is indeed an intermediate polar ( e.g. , borczyk , schwarzenberg - czerny , & szkody 2003 ) .",
    "0.3 cm    retter ( 2002 ) pointed out that about 10@xmath18 of the cataclysmic variable population are classified as intermediate polars , which is consistent with the rarity ( @xmath19 ) of the transition phase in novae .",
    "note that these values are low limits due to the lack of observations .",
    "he hypothesized that the accretion disks in intermediate polars are easy to destroy in the nova outburst unlike other systems because the mass of the accretion disk in intermediate polars is much lower than in non - magnetic cvs .",
    "observational evidence for the presence of the accretion disk was found in a few novae several weeks  months after eruption ( e.g. , leibowitz et al .",
    "1992 ; skillman et al .",
    "1997 ; retter et al .",
    "1997 , 1998 ; retter 1999 , iijima & esenoglu 2003 ; retter 2004 ; kang et al 2006 ) . the fact that the accretion disk is recovered around the same time the transition phase occurs supports a connection between the two phenomena .",
    "csk et al .",
    "( 2005 ) found that spectra obtained during the maxima of the oscillations in the transition phase of v4745 sgr are similar to spectra taken just after its nova eruption in 2003 .",
    "therefore , they proposed to explain the oscillations by several episodes of mass ejection , which they called mini nova - outbursts . this can be understood by the repeated destruction of the accretion disk and its re - establishment because of high mass transfer rates .",
    "the material accumulated on the surface of the white dwarf heats it and then another mini nova - outburst occurs .",
    "we note that the critical mass required for the mini - outburst is lower than the nova event because the white dwarf is hotter than before eruption .",
    "the proposed link between the transition phase in novae and intermediate polars ( retter et al . 2000b ; retter 2002 ) makes a simple prediction : novae whose light curves show transition phase oscillations should be intermediate polars .",
    "iijima & esenoglu ( 2003 ) presented a spectroscopic coverage of the transition phase in nova v1494 aql 1999 and displayed its optical light curve .",
    "its transition stage started a month after maximum brightness ( kiss & thompson 2000 ) , and the amplitude of the oscillations during the transition phase was @xmath201 mag similar to v4743 sgr ( see fig .",
    "a period of 3.2 h was discovered in its optical light curve ( retter et al .",
    "2000a ) and was interpreted as the orbital period of the binary system .",

    "woudt , warner & spark ( 2005 ) found two periodicities , 5.92 h and 719 s , in its light curve , which they respectively interpreted as the orbital and spin periods .",

    "two more examples of recent transition - oscillation novae are v2540 oph 2002 ( ak , retter , & liu 2005 ) and v4745",
    "sgr 2003 ( csk et al .",
    "in both cases , the orbital periods were found from optical photometry ( ak et al .",
    "2005 ) , but no short - term periodicities were detected . to our knowledge , no x - ray observations of these two novae were made .",
    "another example of an old transition - oscillation nova is v373 sct ( mattei 1975 ) . in the light curve of v373 sct , woudt & warner ( 2003 )",
    "detected a period of 258 sec , which is very likely the spin period of the white dwarf , but no long - term period was found .",
    "thus , the intermediate polar model for v2540 oph , v4745 sgr and v373 sct has yet to be confirmed .",
    "\\(1 ) we found two periods of 0.2799 d @xmath0 6.7 h and 0.01642 d @xmath0 24 min in the 2005 photometric observations of v4743 sgr . in the 2003 data , we also detected the longer periodicity , but only found weak evidence of the shorter period .",
    "\\(2 ) we interpret the 6.7-h period as the orbital period of the binary system and the 24-min period as the beat periodicity between the orbital period and the spin period , which was found in x - ray observations .",
    "we thus suggest that v4743 sgr should be classified as an intermediate polar .",
    "\\(3 ) the light curve of v4743 sgr seemed to show quasi - periodic oscillations that are typical of the transition phase in novae .",
    "thus , our results support the previously suggested link between transition - oscillation novae and intermediate polars .",
    "\\(4 ) in three cases ( v1494 aql , v1039 cen and v4743 sgr ) the proposed connection between transition - oscillation novae and intermediate polars seems to be vaild . however , more observations in the x - ray and optical bands are required to confirm or refute the proposed link , and to follow the evolution in time of the periodicities in v4743 sgr .",
