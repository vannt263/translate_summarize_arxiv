    "much of the theoretical analysis of deformation and plastic flow in amorphous solids and other non - crystalline materials ( structural glasses , metallic glasses , pastes , foams , gels etc . )",
    "is still influenced to a large degree by the understanding of crystalline materials . in the latter",
    "the deformation and flow are governed by topological defects known as dislocations , whose dynamics are the basis of the theory of crystalline plasticity @xcite .",
    "indeed , following the pioneering work of maeda and takeuchi @xcite on metallic glasses and those of argon and coworkers @xcite on bubble rafts , workers in the field of amorphous elasto - plasticity @xcite proposed theoretical schemes based on the notion that also in amorphous solids plastic events are carried by some sort of micro - structural defects , referred to as  shear transformation zones \" ( stz ) . while the precise nature of these stz or how to measure them experimentally or even simulationally has never been fully clarified , their existence as the source of ` quanta ' of plastic relaxation carried by a small number of atoms was taken as a basis for developing mean - field models of elasto - plasticity .",
    "although these models are not unique and are sometimes even in disagreement with each other , careful attempts to apply them to a variety of phenomena , from shear banding @xcite to fracture @xcite and from necking instabilities @xcite to grooving via grinfeld instabilities @xcite all showed considerable promise and a fair agreement with experiments or simulations . the fundamental question of whether plasticity in amorphous solids is indeed due to local events in which a microscopic number of atoms ( independent of the system size ) are involved remained unanswered .",
    "a serious doubt on this fundamental assertion was recently cast by maloney and lema@xmath0tre @xcite with their presentation of a series of two - dimensional atomistic computer simulations of amorphous solids subject to simple shear in the athermal , quasistatic limit .",
    "these authors argued that the plastic events themselves were lines of slip which span the length of the simulations cell .",
    "if it were shown that these findings extend to physical experiments , this would put in question the very fundamental assumptions underlying mean - field theories that were put forward , irrespective of their relative success to parameterize a number of interesting elasto - plastic phenomena . in a recent meeting at the lorentz center in leiden the conclusions of maloney and lema@xmath0tre",
    "were criticized @xcite on the basis of the algorithm used , in which after each step of strain the energy was minimized , irrespective of the computer time needed for this minimization or whether the trajectory followed is physical .",
    "this opens up the possibility that the spanning events seen in @xcite would not be seen in a system with ` natural ' dynamics in which the limit of zero strain rate is not to be confused with arbitrary waiting times between strain steps .",
    "the aim of this paper is not to form judgment about the assumed locality of plastic deformations in laboratory experiments done at finite strain rates and finite temperatures .",
    "rather , we focus on the fundamental issue of the spatial extent of plastic deformations using a variety of algorithms and a number of simulational tests for the locality ( or rather non - locality ) of these deformations in two - dimensional amorphous solids . among other things",
    "we provide evidence that the results found in @xcite are generic .",
    "but we go further in analyzing the system - size dependence of various measures of elasto - plastic deformation .",
    "our conclusions are even more pessimistic than those given by @xcite ; we conclude that it is quite difficult to try to isolate the plastic contribution to an elasto - plastic event .",
    "the ` plastic energy ' part of such an event is ill - defined ; every plastic deformation is accompanied by an elastic deformation which is trivially long ranged because elasticity is long ranged .",
    "the elastic contribution to every energy change in an elasto - plastic event can be much larger than the purely plastic energy change even if the latter were well defined .",
    "measuring the latter is almost like weighing the captain by weighing the captain with the ship and and ship without the captain and taking the difference .",
    "we therefore propose below a number of new measures that are able to distinguish the irreversible plastic contribution from the elastic affine and non - affine contributions .",
    "our conclusion is that the generic plastic deformations are not localized , and this is * not * because of the elastic response that accompanies it .",
    "we will show that direct measures of the ` size ' of the purely plastic events scale with the size of the system similarly to the scaling of the elasto - plastic events .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in the second part of the introduction we describe the model used in the majority of the paper below . in sect .",
    "[ pullin ] we describe an experiment of pulling one particle in a glassy system of varying sizes and measuring the maximal force on this particle before the plastic deformation .",
    "we show that the average maximal force depends on the size of the system as a power law , indicating that the system is never too large such that the walls do not matter .",
    "the power law has a non - trivial exponent that we discuss below . in sect .",
    "[ drops ] we consider systems of various sizes under strain , and study the scaling properties of the distributions of stress and energy drops when the system reaches a steady - state plastic flow .",
    "we demonstrate that these distributions are characterized by sub - extensive scaling with non - trivial exponents , again indicating that the plastic events are not localized .",
    "we introduce a measure of the size of plastic events that filters out the effect of non - affine elasticity , and show that this measure scales with essentially the same exponent as the totality of the elasto - plastic energy drop . finally , to remove the last doubts , in sect .",
    "[ another ] we introduce a new model glass for which we can precisely measure the size and extent of a purely plastic event , filtering out completely any possible elastic contribution .",
    "the conclusion is as above , that the size of plastic events scales in a sub - extensive fashion with a non - trivial exponent . in the discussion section [ summary ]",
    "we provide a summary of the result and discuss the apparent non - universality of the scaling exponents .",
    "it is stated that understanding the numerical values of the found exponents should be an important step in improving our understanding of the physics of amorphous solids .",
    "almost all the simulations below are performed in a glassy system consisting of poly - dispersed soft disks .",
    "we work with point particles of equal mass @xmath1 in two dimensions with pair - wise interaction potentials .",
    "each particle @xmath2 is assigned a interaction parameter @xmath3 from a normal distribution with mean 1 .",

    "the time units @xmath12 are accordingly @xmath13 .",
    "the motivation of this somewhat lengthy form of the potential is to have continuous first and second derivatives at the built - in cutoff of @xmath14 . in the present simulations we chose @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "the choice of a quartic rather than a quadratic correction term is motivated by numerical speed considerations , avoiding the calculation of square roots . in all the simulations discussed below the number density @xmath17 and",
    "the boundary conditions are periodic .",
    "to initiate the discussion of locality vs. non - locality issues we begin with a simulation of the lovely experiment presented in @xcite . in this experiment one",
    "pulls a * single * disk at a constant ( low ) velocity through a disordered array of disks whose diameters have two possible values . in our case",
    "we use the system described in subsect . [ model ] .",
    "we start by quenching a system of @xmath18 particles from @xmath19 to @xmath20 at a cooling rate of @xmath21 @xmath22 . at this point",
    "we remove any residual heat by conjugate gradient minimization @xcite . after this preparation",
    "we choose one particle out of the @xmath23 available ones ( referred to below as the ` center ' particle ) , and draw a circle of radius @xmath24 around it .",
    "next we freeze all the particles outside this circle , leaving the particles inside the circle to interact normally according to newton s equations .",
    "an example of the results of such a procedure is shown in fig .",
    "[ showcircle ] .",
    "the procedure is then repeated for each and every one of the @xmath23 particles for the sake of statistics .",
    "the experiment performed consists of pulling the center particle at a velocity @xmath25 .",
    "we reach this velocity with a smooth initiation as seen in fig .",
    "[ trajpul ] in order to minimize elastic shock waves .",
    "obviously , when the particle begins to move it increases the elastic energy in the whole system .",
    "this increase continues until the first plastic event in which an irreversible re - organization of the particle positions takes place .",
    "this event is irreversible in the sense that until it happens one can reverse the motion and return to the initial condition , but after the event heat is released in the form of kinetic energy and reversibility is lost .",
    "an example of a typical run is available in a movie that can be found in @xcite , and the results of this run are displayed in fig .",
    "[ trajpul ] .",
    "one can see in the movie that the plastic event appears local to the eye .",
    "the main question of this paper is whether this is just an eyeball impression or is it quite true .",
    "we study this issue by changing the radius @xmath24 and examining the distribution of the maximal force exerted on the particle before the plastic failure . at each value of @xmath24",
    "we repeat the experiment @xmath23 times , once for each particle in the system being the center particle . in each trial",
    "the center particle is pulled in a random direction and we measure the force exerted on it in the direction of the motion .    -0.5",
    "cm    in fig .",
    "[ trajpul ] one can see the force as a function of time and as a function of displacement for a typical run .",
    "naively one could expect that if the plastic failure were a localized phenomenon , then the average ( over @xmath23 ) maximal force in the direction of pulling before that failure should not depend crucially on the circle radius @xmath24 , or if it does depend on @xmath24 that dependence should fall off exponentially to an @xmath24-independent value as @xmath24 increases . to test this expectation",
    "we compute the average maximal force for different values of @xmath24 .",
    "in fact , when we increase @xmath24 we find that the maximal force falls off very slowly as a function of @xmath24 , as a power law , cf . fig .",
    "[ maxforce ] .    -.5",
    "cm    the distributions of maximal force , @xmath26 moves systematically to smaller values of @xmath27 when @xmath24 increases . for the present system",
    "we find a power law decay in the average value of the maximal force , with the excellent fit exhibited in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ maxforce ] .",
    "the power law reads @xmath28 with @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 being the asymptotic average maximal force for @xmath32 .",
    "this power law is the first one found in this paper with a non - trivial exponent , others will follow below .",
    "we have checked that the exponent in the power law is _ not _ universal , being dependent on the potential and other characteristics of the system . at this point",
    "we do not have a solid theory to predict the value of either this or the other exponents discussed below , but we conjecture that the present exponent is determined by the fractal dimension @xmath33 of the force - chains created by the loading , and may even be precisely that number , i.e @xmath34 .",
    "obviously it is highly desirable to develop such scaling relations in the near future .",
    "the reason of the slow decay in the average maximal force is that in disordered systems one can always find regions that either respond via non - affine elasticity or yield plastically for smaller forces when the system increases in size and the availability of softer regions becomes apparent .",
    "nevertheless the convergence to a finite average maximal force for @xmath32 shows that there exists a material parameter , analogous to the yield stress , which determines the density of weak pathways per unit volume when the system is sufficiently large .",
    "we can therefore conclude that the plastic events incurred during the pulling of the center particle ` know ' about the size of the system , and the disorder does not screen the boundary from the local loading .",
    "one could argue that this is expected since the loading creates force chains that must end at the boundaries , and that the long range effects found here are nothing but a consequence of the fact that elasticity is long ranged .",
    "indeed , it is very difficult to disentangle purely plastic from elastic contributions in any elasto - plastic material .",
    "thus to drive our point further we turn next to the stress and energy drops during plastic irreversible deformations under a different kind of loading .",
    "to explore the locality vs. non - locality issues of the plastic deformation we turn now to a direct exploration of the plastic failure when our system is subjected to a simple shear .",
    "in such simulations one expects to see an elastic branch where the stress increases linearly with the strain until the yield - stress is achieved and plastic events begin .",
    "there are a number of ways that such simulations can be done .",
    "one way is by solving the so - called sllod equations @xcite , another way is to introduce and move two walls with no - slip boundary conditions @xcite , and the third is to impose small strain increments as described below and then to minimize the energy of the resulting configuration under the constraints imposed by the strain increment @xcite .",
    "we opt for the third option in order to be able to accurately measure the distribution of stress and energy drops in the plastic events which are well defined only in this method . in doing",
    "so we will be able also to validate the results of @xcite and even to strengthen them .    in detail",
    ", we prepare the same system described in subsect . [ model ] but now with @xmath35 , 1024 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , cooled at a rate of @xmath40 @xmath22 .",
    "beginning from a quenched unstrained configuration we impose a simple shear strain increment which will be denoted @xmath41 .",
    "this is achieved by applying the following transformation on the particles coordinates : @xmath42 in addition to imposing lees - edwards boundary conditions .",
    "typical stress - strain and potential energy - strain curves for a system with @xmath43 are shown in fig .",
    "one sees the main elastic branch after which the evolution consists of small elastic branches ending with plastic drops .",
    "we employ a basic strain increment of @xmath44 for systems smaller than @xmath45 and @xmath46 for the larger systems . to increase our precision in determining the stress and energy drops and to guarantee that we do not overshoot and miss the next minimum we stop the simulation after a drop is detected , backtrack to the configuration prior to the drop and half the strain increments .",
    "the way the detection of the plastic drop is done is explained in detail in appendix [ dropdet ] .",
    "this procedure is repeated until the strain increment is smaller than @xmath21 for systems smaller than @xmath45 and @xmath47 for the larger systems .",
    "an example of a trajectory approaching the plastic drop is shown in the blown - up right panel of fig .",
    "[ ss ] .",
    "the statistics of the stress and energy drops is collected from between 4500 and 9000 plastic drops for each system size , where all the considered drops are after steady state plastic flow had been reached , with measurements collected after about 40% strains .",
    "-1.6 cm    the raw distributions of the energy and stress drops are displayed in the upper panels of fig .",
    "[ rawandmean ] .",
    "the lower panel of the same figure display the system size dependence of the average energy drop and average stress drop respectively , in a log - log plot .",
    "the conclusion is that the mean drop are described to a very high precision by power laws of the form @xmath48 with @xmath49 while we did not expect these scaling exponents , it is very easy to understand that there exists a scaling relation between them , @xmath50 to see this , we note that in the athermal limit at very low strain rates the steady state plastic flow occurs around a fixed value of the stress , which is the yield stress @xmath51 . on the average , for every elastic increase in the energy which occurs for a strain increment @xmath52 we have a corresponding plastic drop @xmath53 , and we can estimate the mean energy drop according to @xmath54 since in our systems of fixed density @xmath55 , the scaling relation ( [ screl ] ) follows immediately",
    ".    we can use the scaling laws eq .",
    "( [ laws ] ) to re - scale the raw distribution functions of fig .",
    "[ rawandmean ] .",
    "the resulting distributions are presented in fig .",
    "[ rescaled ] .",
    "we note that the data collapse is superb for probabilities larger than about 1% . for lower probabilities",
    "the quality of the collapse deteriorates ; due to the paucity of data there we can not determine whether the deteriorating collapse is due to multiscaling of higher moments or due to statistical errors .",
    "if we attempt to rescale using a somewhat higher exponents we can get the tails to collapse but then the high probabilities fail to collapse .",
    "-1.2 cm    the scaling eq .",
    "( [ laws ] ) and the quality of the data collapse demonstrate that the plastic drops are not localized , but in fact are sub - extensive .",
    "this finding is in agreement with @xcite , although the numerical value of our scaling exponents @xmath56 and @xmath57 differs from theirs ( both @xcite and @xcite report @xmath58 ) .",
    "we return to the issue of non - universality of the scaling exponents in sect .",
    "[ another ] .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the work of @xcite was criticized on the basis of their algorithm ; it was proposed that the energy minimization procedure follows an un - physical trajectory in configuration space , and increases artificially the amount of energy drop in a plastic event . also , since the energy minimization does not correspond to real time units , the system has effectively infinite time to reach the minimum energy , and this this is not a proper small strain rate limit .",
    "we demonstrate now that this criticism is incorrect , and in fact molecular dynamics can often lead to * larger * energy drops .",
    "energy minimization often stops in the next available minimum , whereas true dynamics can often trigger subsequent energy drops and ends up increasing the size of the average region involved in the plastic event .",
    "this conclusion is demonstrated with trajectories of the two methods in fig .",
    "[ dynamics ] , and a movie of a multiple avalanche that is seen in true molecular dynamics is available in @xcite .    -1.0",
    "cm    we conclude that the energy minimization procedure produces a _ lower bound _ to the energy drops rather than an exaggerated result .",
    "one should understand that the true dynamics releases kinetic energy after the first drop which is negligible on the system scale , being the difference between a single saddle and a neighboring minimum .",
    "but before this negligible energy is spread over the whole system it heats up considerably the local neighborhood and can easily trigger further energy drops which in turn heat up the local region even further . accordingly",
    "the ` energy drop ' is well defined only within the energy minimization procedure , where it is not in the eyes of the beholder .",
    "one could argue that the reason that the energy drops are sub - extensive is only because every change in an elasto - plastic medium involves also an elastic relaxation .",
    "this is of course true ; since elasticity is long - ranged , one could expect some kind of sub - extensive scaling .",
    "in fact , this underlines our belief that it is futile to talk about pure plastic energy changes , since the contribution of the purely plastic part of an energy drop can be very small compared to the associated elastic contribution .",
    "furthermore , any measure that employs the coordinates of all the particles in the system , like various participation numbers , will always collect some elastic relaxation contributions which can be quite large .",
    "notwithstanding , we propose here that the sub - extensive scaling of the energy drops is not * only * because of the elastic contributions , and that we can demonstrate this scaling also when we carefully exclude the elastic contributions .",
    "this will be done in the next subsection .      to single out the purely plastic contributions to the elasto - plastic events we will track the neighbor lists during the straining simulations . before every flow event each particle in the system",
    "is assigned a neighbor list consisting of the particles residing within the range of interaction , cf .",
    "( [ potential ] ) .",
    "after the elasto - plastic event each particle is checked against the original neighbor list and the number of neighbor changes is monitored .",
    "it is important to state that upon loading , the neighbor list may change due to non - affine elastic effects when a neighboring particle leaves the range of interaction or a new particle enters that range . during",
    "an affine linear elastic loading the neighbor list does not change at all .",
    "however , during the loading we encounter also nonlinear non - affine elasticity . we have checked carefully and determined that during the latter there exist t1 processes in which the neighbor list does change .",
    "such processes are reversible and can be traced back by unloading . in our simulations",
    "we find that in order to detect more than one change in the neighbor list per particle in the non - affine elastic processes we need to undergo very large strain intervals .",
    "we therefore conclude that during the plastic drops , where the displacement field changes only little , it is unlikely that the non - affine elastic strains would involve more than one change per particle in the neighbor list .",
    "we thus propose that by filtering those particles whose neighbor list had undergone more than one change during the elasto - plastic event we capture essentially only those that were a part of a purely plastic irreversible event .",
    "we formed a measure of the size @xmath59 of the purely plastic event from summing up the number of particles whose neighbor list changed by more than unity . in fig .",
    "[ distance ] we show the raw distribution of @xmath59 for systems of varying sizes , with an inset exhibiting the average of @xmath59 .    -1.2 cm    as before , we find that the raw distribution tend to higher and higher values of @xmath59 when the system size increases , and as before we find that the average of @xmath59 scales nicely with the system size , @xmath60 with @xmath61 .",
    "note that with the present accuracy we can not rule out that @xmath62 .",
    "the purpose of this section is to remove the last doubts about the sub - extensivity of the plastic events . to this aim",

    "we can thus simply count the number of particles that underwent a bond break or a bond creation during a stress drop , to obtain an unquestionable measure of the size of the purely plastic event . to do this , we repeat the straining experiment in much the same way as discussed above , but for systems with the present potential ( [ potent2 ] ) for system sizes of @xmath72 , 2500 , 4096 and 10 000 , keeping the same value of the density @xmath73 as before . in every stress drop event",

    "we believe that the difference between @xmath78 and @xmath79 is outside the error bars for either number , indicating that changing the potential very well may result in changing the value of the scaling exponents .",
    "we have examined the issue of the non - locality of plastic deformation by a set of numerical experiments of increasing stringency in filtering out the elastic contributions .",
    "first we examined the maximal force exerted on a particle moving within a glassy medium of finite size , and discovered that the average maximal force before a plastic deformation depends on the system size as a power law .",
    "not being able to filter out the elastic from the plastic effects in this experiment , we turned to examining the distribution of stress drops and energy drops in a straining experiment once the system exceeded the yield stress and landed on the steady state plastic flow .",
    "again we found that both the stress and the energy drops had distribution function that exhibited an interesting scaling law with the size of the system , strengthening the conclusion that the plastic events are not localized .",
    "the scaling exponents found were non trivial , but in agreement with the presumably exact scaling relation eq .",
    "( [ screl ] ) . having still difficulties in distinguishing elastic from plastic contributions in these measurements",
    ", we turned to the neighbor lists whose large changes are most likely not due to non - affine elasticity .",
    "those changes scaled again with the size of the system , and the scaling exponent @xmath79 was numerically sufficiently close to @xmath56 to indicate that they are the same exponents , and that the scaling of the energy drops in the plastic events is the same as that of the purely plastic contribution . finally , to remove the last doubts we constructed a model in which the plastic events can be accurately separated from any elastic contribution , and found that also there the size of the plastic events scales sub - extensively with the size of the system .",
    "the exponent @xmath78 was sufficiently different from @xmath56 or @xmath79 to indicate a lack of universality in these exponents .",
    "it is very likely that the scaling exponents seen here depend on the details of the models , on the nature of disorder and on parameters like pressure , density etc .",
    "we propose that understanding these exponents and finding a theoretical calculation of them will shed important light on the physics of amorphous solids .",

    "since our system is disordered , the affine transformation defined in ( [ shear ] ) does nt take the system to a minimum of the potential under the strain constraint .",

    "we denote the energy read after minimizing this state as @xmath81 , and define the difference between the energies of the system after imposing the affine strain increment and the resulting minimized configuration as @xmath82 .",
    "we expect this difference to be proportional to the system size , since it must be extensive . also ,",
    "since this quantity represents the extent to which the affine transformation does nt match the new potential energy minimum , we expect this mismatch to be symmetric under the direction in which the strain increment is imposed starting from a given configuration .",
