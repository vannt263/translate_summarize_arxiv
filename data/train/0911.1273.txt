    "the atlas , cms and lhcb experiments feature detection capabilities at forward rapidities ( @xmath0  3 , see fig .

    "+ on the one hand , having the possibility to reconstruct jets beyond @xmath2  3 in atlas and cms is crucial to signal higgs boson production in vector - boson - fusion ( vbf ) processes , @xmath3 ( with @xmath4 ) , where the valence quarks @xmath5 from each proton fragment into jets in the forward and backward hemispheres  @xcite .",
    "the presence of such low - angle jets is instrumental to significantly reduce the qcd backgrounds in various vbf higgs discovery channels at the lhc , particularly for low @xmath6 masses  @xcite . in the case of lhcb , given the excellent secondary vertex capabilities of the detector , forward jet studies have focused on the reconstruction of @xmath7-jets aiming at the @xmath8 decay channel in higgs production associated with vector bosons ( about one third of the cross section falls within the lhcb acceptance )  @xcite .",
    "+ on the other hand , forward jet production is in its own right an interesting perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) process whose study yields important information on the underlying parton structure and its dynamical evolution in the proton .",
    "in particular , it provides valuable information on the gluon density @xmath9 in a regime of low momentum fraction , @xmath10  =  @xmath11  10@xmath12 , where standard deep - inelastic @xmath13-@xmath1 data can only indirectly constrain its value  @xcite , and where its evolution is expected to be affected by non - linear qcd dynamics  @xcite .",
    "indeed , in @xmath1-@xmath1  collisions , the _ minimum _ parton momentum fractions probed in each proton in a @xmath14 process with a jet of momentum @xmath15 produced at pseudo - rapidity @xmath16 are @xmath17 i.e. @xmath18 decreases by a factor of @xmath1910 every 2 units of rapidity .",

    "the jet radii are often chosen relatively small ( e.g. @xmath31 for the cone and @xmath32 for the @xmath33 algorithms ) so as to minimise the effects of hadronic activity inside the jet due to the underlying event and beam - remnants .",

    "we note that though the forward calorimeters have a coarser granularity than the barrel and endcap ones , the energy resolution is _",
