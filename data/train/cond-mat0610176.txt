    "insulating oxides and nitrides are indispensable materials for diverse applications due to their superior mechanical , thermal , chemical and other outstanding high temperature properties . furthermore , in the electronic industry these wide band gap materials are being considered for alternative gate oxides @xcite and in the field of integrated optics they provide low - loss dielectric waveguides @xcite .",
    "recently the subject of wide bandgap oxides and nitrides have gained interest within the context of nanocrystals which offer silicon - based technology for light emitting devices and semiconductor memories @xcite .",
    "these nanocrystals are embedded in an insulating matrix which is usually chosen to be silica @xcite . however , other wide bandgap materials are also employed such as germania @xcite , silicon nitride @xcite , and alumina @xcite . as a matter of fact , the effect of different host matrices is an active research topic in this field .    among these insulating oxides and nitrides technologically most important ones",
    "are sio@xmath0 , al@xmath0o@xmath1 , si@xmath1n@xmath2 .",
    "the activity around geo@xmath0 is steadily increasing .",
    "another closely - related material , ge@xmath1n@xmath2 has attracted far less attention up to now even though it has certain interesting properties @xcite .",
    "the major obstacle has been the sample growth .",
    "however , a very recent study reported an _ in situ _",
    "ge@xmath5n@xmath6 growth on ge , demonstrating high thermal stability and large band offsets with respect to the ge system @xcite . in this comprehensive work",
    ", we present the _ ab initio _ structural and electronic properties of all these materials considering their common polymorphs ; these are for sio@xmath0 : @xmath3-quartz , @xmath3- and @xmath4-cristobalite and stishovite phases , for geo@xmath0 : @xmath3-quartz , and rutile phases , for si@xmath1n@xmath2 and ge@xmath1n@xmath2 : @xmath3- and @xmath4-phases and for al@xmath0o@xmath1 : @xmath3-phase . for amorphous and inherently imperfect matrices ,",
    "these perfect crystalline phases serve as important reference systems .",
    "moreover , due to their distinct advantages , _ epitaxial _ host lattices are preferred over the amorphous ones for specific applications .    with an eye on these technological applications , we focus on several physical properties of these lattices .",
    "the elastic constants play an important role on the strain profile of the embedded core semiconductor . using eshelby s continuum elastic consideration @xcite the radial and tangential stress fields of the nanocrystal",
    "can be determined @xcite ; these in turn , affect the optical properties @xcite .",
    "the static and optical dielectric constants of these lattices introduce nontrivial local field effects that modify the absorption spectra of an isolated nanocrystal when embedded inside one of these matrices @xcite .",
    "based on the simple effective medium theory which has been tested by _ ab initio _",
    "calculations @xcite , one can assess which host lattice and nanocrystal combination would possess the desired optical properties .",
    "because of the dielectric mismatch between the nanocrystal core and the surrounding lattice , image charges will be produced @xcite .",
    "these image charges should be taken into account in characterizing nanocrystal excitons @xcite .",
    "another promising application is the visible and near infrared electroluminescence from si and ge nanocrystals @xcite .",
    "the electroluminescence is believed to be achieved by the recombination of the electron hole pairs injected to nanocrystals under high bias @xcite . in this context",
    "the bulk state impact ionization process which can also give rise to electroluminescence is considered to be detrimental leading to dielectric breakdown .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,^,^ \" , ]     for all of the considered polymorphs the conduction band minima occur at the @xmath7 point whereas the valence band maxima shift away from this point for some of the phases making them indirect band gap matrices ( see table  [ egap ] ) .",
    "however , the direct band gap values are only marginally above the indirect band gap values .",
    "these lda band gaps are underestimated which is a renown artifact of lda for semiconductors and insulators @xcite . in this work",
    "we do not attempt any correction procedure to adjust the lda band gap values .",
    "we present in figs .",
    "[ aquardos],[rutiledos],[sige3n4dos ] the element- and angular momentum - resolved pdos .",
    "a common trend that can be observed in these various lattices is that their valence band maxima are dominated by the @xmath8 states belonging to o atoms ; in the case of si@xmath5n@xmath6 and ge@xmath1n@xmath2 they are the n atoms . for the conduction band edges ,",
    "both constituent elements have comparable contribution .",
    "this parallels the observation in amorphous sio@xmath9 where due to large electronegativity difference between si and o , the bonding orbitals have a large weight on o atoms whereas the lowest conduction band states with antibonding character have a significant contribution from the si atoms @xcite .    from another perspective , the band structures and the associated dos reveal that there is a marked discrepancy between the valence and conduction band edges where for the former there occurs a sharp increase of dos just below the band edge . as the probabilities of most scattering processes are directly proportional to dos @xcite , in the case of high - field carrier transport the electrons should encounter far less scatterings and hence gain much higher energy from the field compared to holes . in this respect si@xmath1n@xmath2 and ge@xmath1n@xmath2",
    "are further different from the others where for both conduction and valence bands the dos dramatically increases ( cf .",
    "[ bdsige3n4 ] ) so that the carriers should suffer from excessive scatterings which practically precludes the bulk impact ionization for this material .",
    "another common trend can be investigated between the density of each polymorph and the corresponding static permittivity , @xmath10 .",
    "such a correlation was put forward by xu and ching among the sio@xmath9 polymorphs @xcite .",
    "we extend this comparison to all structures considered in this work and rather use @xmath11 which corresponds to electric susceptibility .",
    "it can be observed from fig .",
    "[ epsdensity ] that the trend established by sio@xmath9 polymorphs is also followed by @xmath4-si@xmath5n@xmath6 and @xmath3-al@xmath0o@xmath5 . on the other hand , ge - containing structures while possessing a similar trend among themselves , display a significant shift due to much higher mass of the this atom .",
    "this dependence on the atomic mass needs to be removed by finding a more suitable physical quantity .",
    "we should mention that such a correlation does not exist between the volume per primitive cell of each phase and the static permittivity .",
    "after these general comments , now we concentrate on the results of each lattice individually .",
    "the @xmath3-quartz sio@xmath0 is one of the most studied polymorphs as it is the stable phase at the ambient pressure and temperature @xcite , furthermore its short - range order is essentially the same as the amorphous sio@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "@xmath3-quartz sio@xmath0 has a hexagonal unit cell containing three sio@xmath0 molecules .",
    "a plane - wave basis set with an energy cutoff of 60  ha was used to expand the electronic wave functions at the special @xmath12-point mesh generated by 10@xmath1310@xmath138 monkhorst - pack scheme @xcite .",
    "the band structure of @xmath3-quartz sio@xmath0 has been calculated by many authors ( see , for instance @xcite ) . our calculated band structure and total dos shown in fig .  [ bdsio2](a )",

    "calculated values of the elastic constants and bulk modulus listed in table  [ elastic ] are in good agreement with the experiments .",
    "apart from @xmath15 , the elastic constants are within 10@xmath16 of the experimental values .",
    "the discrepancy in @xmath15 can be explained by the fact that @xmath15 is very soft and this type of deviation also exists among experiments which is also the case for @xmath17 .",

    "the band structure of stishovite with a wide single valence band is markedly different from that of the previous three crystalline phases of sio@xmath0 having two narrow upper valence bands .",
