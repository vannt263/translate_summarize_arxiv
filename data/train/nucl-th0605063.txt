    "the bound state of few - body systems seems to be an ideal laboratory to determine two- , three- and four - body nuclear forces .",
    "the studies of the four - body bound state properties for the case of few - body interactions have received increasing attention theoretically and experimentally in recent years .",
    "although the four - body bound state poses a challenging problem numerically , because of presence of fourth body , its investigation promises insights into the rich structure of nuclear interactions . to this aim",
    "one requires an accurate and reliable method to obtain the full solution of four - body bound state in a straightforward manner .",
    "the four - body bound state calculations are carried out by different methods to solve the nonrelativistic schrdinger equation such as , the coupled - rearrangement - channel gaussian - basis variational(crcgv ) @xcite-@xcite , the stochastic variation(sv ) with correlated gaussians @xcite-@xcite , the hyperspherical harmonic variational ( hh ) @xcite-@xcite , the green s function monte carlo(gfmc ) @xcite-@xcite , the no - core shell model(ncsm ) @xcite-@xcite , effective interaction hyperspherical harmonic(eihh ) @xcite,@xcite and the faddeev - yakubovsky ( f - y ) . in the last method the nonrelativistic schrdinger equation is transformed to two coupled sets of finite number of coupled equations in three variables for the f - y amplitudes .",
    "the calculations based on f - y are performed in configuration space @xcite-@xcite and in momentum space @xcite-@xcite after a partial wave ( pw ) expansion , where the algebraic and algorithmic steps can be quiet involved .",
    "though a few partial waves often provide qualitative insight , modern four - body calculations need 1572 or more different spin , isospin and angular momentum combinations @xcite,@xcite .",
    "it appears therefore natural to avoid a pw representation completely and work directly with vector variables . on this basis in recent years w. glckle and collaborators have introduced the three - dimensional ( 3d ) approach which greatly simplifies the two- and three - body scattering and bound state calculations without using pw decomposition @xcite-@xcite .",
    "our aim in this paper is to extend this approach for four - body bound state with two - body interactions , we work directly with vector variables in the f - y scheme in momentum space . here the dependence on momentum vectors , i.e. the magnitudes of momenta and the angles between the momentum vectors , shows that the full solution can be reached exactly and simply whereas the pw representation of the amplitudes leads to rather complicated expressions @xcite .",
    "the calculations of four - body bound state with the three - body interactions is currently underway and it will be reported elsewhere . as a simplification we neglect spin and isospin degrees of freedom here and",
    "study the four - boson bound state .",
    "so this work is the first step in the direction of solving the four - nucleon bound state problem without performing the pw decomposition .",
    "recently the four - boson bound state has been studied with short - range forces and large scattering length at leading order in an effective field theory approach @xcite-@xcite , but this investigation is also based on pw decomposition and the interactions are restricted to only s - wave sector .    this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ ii ] reviews the f - y equations for four - boson bound state . in section [ iii ]",
    "we represent the coupled f - y equations as function of momentum vectors . in section [ iv ]",
    "we discuss our choice for independent variables of momentum and angle variables for the unknown amplitudes in the equations and in their kernels , where this new representation(3d ) is contrasted with traditional pw representation .",
    "section [ v ] describes details of our algorithm for solving coupled f - y three - dimensional integral equations . in section [ vi ] we compare our results for three- and four - boson binding energies to results obtained from other techniques . in order to test our calculation",
    "we investigate the stability of the eigenvalue of the yakubovsky kernel with respect to the number of grid points and we calculate the expectation value of hamiltonian operator .",
    "finally we summarize in section [ vii ] and provide an outlook .",
    "the bound state of four identical particles which interact via pairwise forces @xmath0 and @xmath1 is given by schrdinger equation which reads in integral form : @xmath2 here the free four - body propagator is given by @xmath3 , and @xmath4 stands for the free hamiltonian .",
    "introducing yakubovsky components @xmath5 , with @xmath6 leads to the six coupled integral equations : @xmath7 the operator @xmath8 describes the two - body @xmath9matrix in the two - body subsystem @xmath10 .",
    "we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) as : @xmath11 among various possibilities to decompose @xmath12 into three f - y components we choose the following one : @xmath13 the f - y component @xmath14 belongs to a @xmath15 partition . they fulfill the following relation : @xmath16 or @xmath17 fragmentation .",
    "it is easily seen that every @xmath18 component contains two @xmath19 type chains and one @xmath17 type chain , therefore total wave function @xmath20 contains twelve different @xmath19 type chains and six @xmath17 type chains .",
    "so altogether one has eighteen f - y components . if we consider identical particles ( here bosons , since we are omitting spin ) , the four - body wave function @xmath20 has to be totally symmetric . as a consequence",
    "all twelve components of @xmath19 type are identical in their functional form and only the particles are permuted .",
    "the same is true for the six components of @xmath17 type .",
    "thus it is sufficient to consider only two independent f - y components corresponding to the @xmath19 and @xmath17 partitions , @xmath21 coupled f - y components shrink to two coupled f - y equations : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the permutation operator between the @xmath24 and @xmath25 particle , and @xmath26 the total four - body wave function is then given as : @xmath27 \\label{9}\\ ] ] the symmetry property of @xmath28 under exchange of particles @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and @xmath31 under separate exchanges of particles @xmath32 and @xmath33 guarantee that @xmath20 is totally symmetric .",
    "we would like to add the remark that another derivation of f - y components is also possible @xcite . in this representation",
    "two transition operators which follow the subcluster faddeev - like equations have been introduced as a function of two - body transition operator @xmath34 .",
    "consequently the kernel of coupled yakubovsky integral equations contains two subcluster kernels that should be evaluated by pad technique .",
    "so its numerical calculations is more complicated and time consuming in comparison to above derivation .",
    "in order to solve the coupled equations ( 7 ) , in momentum space we introduce standard jacobi momenta sets corresponding to both @xmath35 and @xmath36 chains : @xmath37 then we introduce the four - body basis states corresponding to each jacobi momenta set : @xmath38 both basis states are complete in the four - body hilbert space : @xmath39 where @xmath40 indicates each one of @xmath41 and @xmath42 vectors and @xmath43 .",

    "( [ 30 ] ) : @xmath71 from the f - y components @xmath72 and @xmath73 the four - body wave function is obtained by adding the components defined in different @xmath19 and @xmath17 type chains as given in eq .",

    "( [ 30 ] ) .",
    "since we ignore spin and isospin dependencies , the both f - y components @xmath82 are scalars and thus only depend on the magnitudes of jacobi momenta and the angles between them .",
    "the first important step for an explicit calculation is the selection of independent variables .",

    "the evaluation of two - body @xmath9matrices and permutation operators @xmath124 and @xmath75 as well as coordinate transformations due to considering angular momentum quantum numbers instead of angle variables lead to more complicated expressions in comparison to our 3d representation .",

    "the coupled f - y equations eq .",

    "the dependence on the continuous momentum and angle variables @xmath125 and @xmath126 is replaced in the numerical treatment by a dependence on certain discrete values .",
    "let the numbers of these discrete points be denoted by @xmath127 and @xmath128 corresponding to momentum @xmath129 , spherical angle @xmath130 and polar angle @xmath131 variables , the dimension of the eigenvalue problem is : @xmath132 the huge matrix eigenvalue equation requires an iterative solution method .",
    "we use a lanczos - like scheme , the method of iterated orthonormal vectors ( iov ) that is proved to be very efficient for nuclear few - body problems @xcite .",
    "this technique reduces the dimension of the eigenvalue problem to the number of iteration minus one .",
    "the eigenvalue equation , eq . ( [ 51 ] ) , schematically can be written as : @xmath133 the kernel of the linear equations @xmath134 is energy dependent , and @xmath135 is its eigenvalue with @xmath136 as the corresponding eigenvector .",
    "@xmath136 represents the set of f - y components as @xmath137 . for the physical binding energy the eigenvalue @xmath135 of the matrix kernel @xmath134 has to be one",
    "we start the iteration with two gaussian f - y components and stop the iteration after 5 - 10 times . in order to solve the eigenvalue equation , eq .",
    "( [ 54 ] ) , for the f - y components , eq .",
    "( [ 51 ] ) , we use the gaussian quadrature grid points for the momentum and angle variables .",

    "because the f - y components drop sufficiently rapidly we limit the intervals to suitable cut - offs .",
    "we choose the cut - offs as @xmath139 , @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "these cut - off values vary depending on the potential we use but they are chosen large enough to achieve cut - off independence .    the iteration of eq .",
    "( [ 51 ] ) requires a three - dimensional and a six - dimensional interpolation on @xmath142 and a six dimensional interpolation on @xmath143 for the first f - y component .",
    "also it requires a five - dimensional interpolation on @xmath144 and a two - dimensional interpolation on @xmath143 for the second f - y component .",
    "the interpolations should be carry out in the shifted momentum and angle arguments . by adding the additional grid points , @xmath145 to all momentum and @xmath146 to all angle grid points , we avoid the extrapolation outside the gaussian grids .",
    "we would like to point out that the symmetry properties as shown in eq .",
    "( [ 32 ] ) can be implemented in the iteration of eq .",
    "( [ 51 ] ) to cut down the size of the f - y components and thus save time and memory when computing the integrals .",
    "the functional behavior of @xmath134 is determined by the two - body @xmath9matrices @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "we solve the lippmann - schwinger equation for the fully - off - shell two - body @xmath9matrices directly as function of the jacobi vector variables as described in ref .",

    "so each energy depends on two momentum variables .",
    "the number of different energies , where both @xmath9matrices are needed , is quadratic in the number of momentum grid points .",
    "consequently both @xmath9matrices would be extremely huge if we keep the dependence on both momenta .",
    "therefore we introduce two additional energy grids @xmath177 and @xmath178 and insert an interpolation step from these grids to @xmath179 and @xmath180 .",
    "this reduce the memory and computing time necessary for both @xmath9matrices tremendously .",
