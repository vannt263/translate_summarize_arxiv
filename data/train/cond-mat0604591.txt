    "bell s inequality , published more than four decades ago , has not ceased to invoke keen interest in the physics community .",
    "the title of the seminal paper of j.  bell @xcite refers to the famous article of a.  einstein , b.  podolski , and n.  rosen @xcite ( epr ) who concluded that , according to their criteria , quantum theory ( qt ) is incomplete .",
    "bell proved that the assumptions of epr lead to an inequality for measurable correlations of spin measurements for two particles which is violated in qt , and , as later work showed , also in experiments .",
    "thus certain kinds of hidden variable theories are empirically ruled out .",
    "of course , the exact relation between bell s assumptions and those of epr has to be carefully examined . according to an analysis of l.  e.  ballentine and j.  p.",
    "jarrett @xcite the assumptions of bell , simple locality and predictive completeness , are even weaker than the epr assumptions . hence",
    ", in the words of these authors , the _ incompleteness _ of qt _ is , in some sense , a property of nature _",
    "+ there have been many proposals to generalize bell s inequality .",
    "an important generalization is the clauser - horn - shimony - holt inequality @xcite ( chsh ) which is about a linear combination of the correlations of two pairs of measurements .",
    "a generalization to @xmath4 pairs of measurements has been considered by pearle @xcite and later investigated by braunstein and cave @xcite . other work generalized bell s inequality to an arbitrary number of measurements @xcite or to more than two particles @xcite .",
    "see the textbook of a.  peres @xcite and literature quoted there for more details .",
    "+ in this article we will point out a close correspondence between possible generalized bell inequalities ( gbi s ) and certain frustrated _ classical _ spin systems @xmath5 .",
    "these terms will be explained in more detail below .",
    "it is important to distinguish the spin system @xmath5 from the _ quantum _ spin system @xmath6 on which the epr measurements are performed .",
    "the number @xmath7 of spins in @xmath5 corresponds to the number of measurements considered in the context of gbi s . as a by - product of the correspondence",
    "we will obtain a procedure to generate new gbi s including a test whether these inequalities are violated in qt .",
    "+ this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : g ] we explain the basic idea of the correspondence using the example of the chsh inequality",
    ". then we will give the general definitions for the spin systems which give rise to a correspondence with gbi s .",
    "the gbi is violated by the singlet state if and only if the corresponding heisenberg spin system has a classical ground state with a lower energy than the corresponding ising ground state .",
    "these systems thus have necessarily non - collinear ground state configurations , i.  e.  coplanar or @xmath8-dimensional ones , although in all examples considered in this article it is not necessary to consider @xmath8-dimensional ground states . in section [ sec : c ] we present some methods to calculate classical ground states and apply these to the construction procedure for gbi s in section [ sec : b ] .",
    "section [ sec : e ] is devoted to a couple of examples , including the frustrated @xmath9-ring leading to the pearle - braunstein - cave inequality , the frustrated hexagon and the frustrated hypercubes @xmath10 .",
    "in all these examples it is possible to analytically calculate classical heisenberg ground states and ising ground states and to compare their ground state energies . with the exception of @xmath11",
    "the ising ground state energy is higher and hence we obtain gbi s violated in qt by the singlet state .",
    "more general entangled states are considered in section [ sec : s ] and are shown to lead to xxz - models of spin systems .",
    "we close with a conclusion in section [ sec : cc ] .",
    "the correspondence between gbi s and frustrated spin systems is summarized in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "in order to motivate the correspondence between generalized bell inequalities ( gbi s ) and frustrated spin systems we consider the chsh inequality @xcite , following @xcite . + let @xmath12 be four numbers which assume only the values @xmath13 .",
    "then either @xmath14 or @xmath15 and hence @xmath16 assumes only the values @xmath17 , which yields the inequality @xmath18 imagine that the numbers @xmath19 are the outcomes of four @xmath7-times repeated experiments and consider the mean values of the above products , i.  e.  the correlation , @xmath20 then the inequality ( [ g1 ] ) also holds for the mean values , i.  e. @xmath21 this is an equivalent form of the chsh inequality @xcite which belongs to the family of generalized bell inequalities gbi .",
    "it bounds the classical correlations between four different measurements .",
    "we have formulated it without the assumption that the mean values converge against some expectation values for @xmath22 , following @xcite since it seems to be more appropriate to consider this as part of the postulates which connect the chsc inequality to measurements or to qt .",
    "these postulates are known to lead to a contradiction .",
    "the chsc inequality alone is a mathematically valid statement about @xmath23-matrices with entries @xmath13 . + now consider in qt a pair of particles with spin @xmath24 in its entangled singlet @xmath25 spin state @xmath26 .",
    "these are measurements of observables represented by the hermitean operators @xmath27 where @xmath28 are the pauli matrices and the observables @xmath29 for the other directions @xmath30 are analogously defined .",
    "it is possible to combine any two of these measurements and to measure , say , @xmath31 at the left - hand particle and @xmath32 at the other one .",
    "the two experimenters doing these measurements are traditionally called  alice \" and  bob \" . according to the rules of qt",
    ", the combined measurement is represented by the tensor product operator @xmath33 .",
    "if @xmath34 are the outcomes of @xmath7 repetitions of this combined measurements , the mean values @xmath35 according to ( [ g2 ] ) converge towards the expectation value , which can be calculated by qt and depends on the state of the system . for the singlet state ( [ g4 ] )",
    "the expectation value turns out to be @xmath36 and analogously for @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "hence the correlation term in the chsh inequality ( [ g3 ] ) has the quantum theoretical counterpart @xmath39 it is easily seen that the extreme values of ( [ g7 ] ) exceed the bounds of the chsh inequality .",
    "the possible values of ( [ g7 ] ) are symmetric with respect to @xmath40 , since the substitution @xmath41 changes the overall sign in ( [ g7 ] ) . writing ( [ g7 ] ) in the form @xmath42 it is obvious that each term is minimal for the choice @xmath43 and @xmath44 is maximal for @xmath45 .",
    "this is equivalent to the statement : the square has the maximal circumference among the rectangles with fixed length of their diagonals .",
    "hence @xmath46 or @xmath47 and the lower bound is assumed for any configuration with @xmath48 , see figure [ fig04a ] .",
    "the upper bound is assumed similarly . here and in what follows we always count the angles @xmath49 between two unit vectors counter - clockwise , beginning with @xmath50 .",
    "equation ( [ g8b ] ) expresses the bounds for quantum correlations between four possible measurements . since the bounds are attained the chsh inequality ( [ g3 ] )",
    "is violated in qt for suitable measurements and entangled states .",
    "+ the violation of the chsh and similar inequalities , which are rigorously proven theorems , can only be understood in the sense that some of the assumptions leading to ( [ g3 ] ) must not hold in qt . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath51\\neq 0 $ ] and @xmath52\\neq 0 $ ] , only one of the four possible combinations of measurements @xmath53 can be performed as a joint measurement and hence only two of the four numbers @xmath54 can be actually measured in one single experiment . if qt is right , it is thus not possible , by whatever means , to predict the missing two numbers in a consistent way , i.  e.  in such a way that the mean values of all correlation measurements ( actual and hypothetical ones ) approach the mean values of the actual correlation measurements alone . in the words of a.  peres",
    "@xcite : _ unperformed experiments have no results_. + next we introduce the correspondence to spin systems , see table [ tab2 ] .",
    "the basic idea is to re - interpret ( [ g8a ] ) as a statement about the energy of a classical heisenberg spin system @xmath55 of four spins , which are represented by the unit vectors @xmath56 .",
    "of course , @xmath55 has nothing to do with the quantum two - spin system for which the epr type of measurements are performed .",
    "the different signs in ( [ g8a ] ) reflect the coupling between the four spins : @xmath55 can be visualized as a square with three anti - ferromagnetic bonds ( @xmath57 ) and one ferromagnetic bond ( @xmath58 ) , see ( [ e31 ] ) and figure [ fig03 ] .",
    "each spin configuration @xmath56 realizing the lower bound of ( [ g8a ] ) is thus a classical ground state for the ( dimensionless ) hamiltonian    @xmath59    in this paper we will always denote the ground state energy of a spin system by @xmath60 in order to avoid inequalities of the form @xmath61 .",
    "+ the ground states do not minimize each term in ( [ g9 ] ) separately .",
    "indeed , each term in ( [ g9 ] ) has the form of a spin dimer with a classical ground state energy of @xmath62 , irrespective of the sign of the dimer term . adding these four ground state energies would result in @xmath63 ( the same as in the case where all four signs in ( [ g9 ] ) are @xmath64 )",
    ". actually , the ground state energy of ( [ g9 ] ) is only @xmath65 since one can not minimize each term of ( [ g9 ] ) separately without regard to the other terms .",
    "+ spin systems with this property , namely where not each term in the heisenberg ( or ising ) hamiltonian can be minimized simultaneously by a classical ground state will be called  frustrated \" throughout this article . sometimes this notion is used in the literature with slightly different meanings .",
    "for the theory of frustrated spin systems , see , for example , @xcite , or , for an introduction , @xcite .",
    "one of the simplest examples is the anti - ferromagnetic ( af ) spin triangle where the local states @xmath66 minimize one term in the heisenberg hamiltonian but can not be extended to a global ground state .",
    "the af triangle has coplanar ground states with angles of @xmath67 between the spin vectors and is said to be  geometrically frustrated \" .",
    "the frustrated square ( [ g9 ] ) , or ",
    "bell square \" , as we will call it , is an example of non - geometric frustration . + the bell square is an  ab - system \" , that is , the spins can be divided into two sub - lattices @xmath68 and @xmath69 such that only @xmath68-spins interact with @xmath69-spins .",
    "( the nomenclature is again reminiscent of  alice \" and  bob \" ) . a system with this property , non - positive interaction _ _ w__ithin the sub - lattices and non - negative interaction _ _ b__etween the sub - lattices",
    "is usually called a  bi - partite \" system and has ground states of the form that , say , all @xmath68-spins are down and all @xmath69-spins are up . the bell square is an ab - system , but not bi - partite .",
    "this could be taken as a preliminary definition of  non - geometric frustration \" . however ,",
    "we will not attempt to define  geometrical frustration \" and  non - geometrical frustration \" more precisely and will rather use these notions in a somewhat intuitive and vague sense .",
    "+ now we can also re - interpret the chsh inequality , or , rather , its precursor ( [ g1 ] ) , as a statement about the bell square spin system : it simply says that its energy according to the ising model is bounded by @xmath17 . in the ising model ,",
    "the individual spin is not represented by a @xmath8-dimensional unit vector , but , so to speak , by an @xmath70-dimensional unit vector @xmath71 or @xmath72 , or , equivalently , by numbers @xmath13 .",
    "the bi - partite systems mentioned above have ground states of the form @xmath73 , i.  e.  collinear or ising ground states .",
    "but the bell square heisenberg spin system has a coplanar ground state with a ground state energy @xmath74 below its ising model ground state energy @xmath75 .",
    "this is the violation of the chsh inequality in qt , translated into the language of spin systems .",
    "+ we will try to exploit the described correspondence in order to construct gbi s violated by the entangled singlet state in qt by considering the corresponding non - geometrically frustrated spin systems with only coplanar or @xmath8-dimensional ground states . to this end",
    "we need some more general notation which will be adapted to the described correspondence . + the state of the spin system @xmath55",
    "is described by @xmath7 unit vectors @xmath76 .",
    "moreover , the set of spins is divided into two disjoint subsets , @xmath77 , such that the hamiltonian of @xmath55 can be written in the form @xmath78 where the @xmath79 are real coupling coefficients .",
    "the minimum of the hamiltonian ( [ g10 ] ) is called the ground state energy @xmath60 .",
    "+ the corresponding ising model has states described by numbers @xmath80 and an ising hamiltonian @xmath81 with the minimum @xmath82 , the ising ground state energy . in both cases , the values of the hamiltonian change their sign under the spin flip transformation @xmath83 , resp .",

    "the quantum theoretical counter - part of ( [ g11 ] ) is the inequality @xmath90 where all correlations are calculated in the singlet state ( [ g4 ] ) .",
    "the gbi ( [ g11 ] ) is hence violated in qt if and only if @xmath91 .",
    "for the calculation of the classical ground state of a spin system @xmath55 there exists no straightforward method . however , sometimes the following considerations are useful . for more details",

    "analogously we can argue for three linearly independent eigenvectors which yield a @xmath8-dimensional ground state of @xmath103 .",
    "+ to find the ising ground state @xmath104 , the simplest method would be to check all @xmath105 ising spin configurations .",

    "assume , for example , that we have @xmath108 spins as in section [ sec : e3 ] and that the calculation of the ising energy of a single state and the comparison with the minimum previously obtained requires approximately @xmath109 seconds for a program on a desktop computer .",
    "then the total number of @xmath110 calculations would already last longer than eight months .",
    "there exist sophisticated methods to find ising states which represent a local , rather low energy minimum , see e.  g.  @xcite , but for these methods we can not be sure that we have found the global minimum . in our case of weakly bi - partite systems the following simplification is possible : it suffices to check all ising states of a subsystem , say , @xmath111 .",

    "this simplification reduces in our above example @xmath110 calculations to @xmath115 ones and thus the time for the total calculation from months to minutes .",
    "+ an alternative method to calculate the exact ising ground state is the so - calledbranch and bound \" method , see @xcite . according to this method",
    "the ground state problem is viewed as the problem of finding a minimum ( or maximum ) of a function defined on the binary tree given by the possible signs of the individual ising spins , such that good trial state energy or  bound \" for",
    "the minimum is available .",
    "when scanning through the various possibilities of the tree , one can  cut \" those branches of the tree which will never reach the bound , even if the most optimistic expectation for the remaining energies is adopted .",

    "in this section we describe a recipe how to construct new gbi s and provide a test whether they are violated by the singlet state in qt .",

    "this can be done by using the procedure described in the previous section [ sec : c ] .",
    "let @xmath82 denote the ising ground state energy .",
    "we thus obtain a gbi of the form @xmath120 * we perform a spin flip transformation ( [ e11a]),([e11b ] ) such that the ising ground state becomes @xmath121 .",
    "denote the transformed coefficients again by @xmath79 .",
    "* we define a symmetric matrix @xmath93 with @xmath122 as non - diagonal elements .",
    "the diagonal elements of @xmath93 are chosen in such a way that @xmath93 will have constant row sums @xmath123 and vanishing trace , see @xcite .",
    "this leaves the hamiltonian ( [ g10 ] ) unchanged .",
    "consequently , the ising ground state @xmath124 will be an eigenvector of @xmath93 with eigenvalue @xmath123 .",
    "* we calculate the lowest eigenvalue @xmath94 of @xmath93 .",
    "if @xmath125 the ising ground state is already the heisenberg ground state of the spin system and our gbi will not be violated in qt .",
    "we have to start the search anew .",
    "if , however , @xmath126 we are done : we have found a gbi which is violated by the singlet state in qt .",
    "the single steps of this recipe are more or less obvious except the last one . we know from ( [ c1a ] ) that @xmath126 is a necessary condition for a spin system to have a ground state energy @xmath127 , but is it also sufficient ? + in order to prove this we choose the fully polarized ising ground state to point into the @xmath8-direction of our coordinate frame .",
    "let @xmath128 denote an eigenstate of @xmath93 with eigenvalue @xmath94 .",
    "since , by assumption , @xmath126 this eigenstate is orthogonal to the ising ground state , i.  e.  @xmath129 .",

    "satisfying @xmath131 the taylor expansion at @xmath132 of the hamiltonian evaluated at the states of this curve , @xmath133 , yields , after a straightforward calculation , using @xmath129 and @xmath134 , @xmath135 hence @xmath136 for sufficiently small @xmath137 and @xmath82 can not be the ground state energy .",
    "this concludes the proof of the above statement .",
    "+ note , that we did nt prove that the energy @xmath138 is assumed by some ground state .",
    "in general , this will not be the case .",
    "the proof only shows that @xmath139 .",
    "according to section [ sec : b ] arbitrary many gbi s can be constructed .",
    "nevertheless , it will be instructive to show how known examples of gbi s fit into our scheme and to consider further examples for which the ground states can be calculated in closed form .      as a generalization of the frustrated bell square with @xmath140",
    "we consider a spin ring with an even number @xmath141 of spins , cyclic boundary condition @xmath142 and nearest neighbor interaction .",
    "let us for a moment also consider the bi - partite af system with @xmath143 .",
    "it has a ground state @xmath144 which is also an ising ground state .",
    "the energy is unchanged by a spin flip transformation @xmath145 where @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "hence the transformed ground state will be the ground state of the transformed hamiltonian .",
    "the spin flip transformation does not alter the number of @xmath62-signs in the ring mod @xmath148 : after the transformation there exists an even number of @xmath62-signs , compared to zero @xmath62-signs before the transformation .",
    "obviously , any distribution of an even number of @xmath62-signs in the ring can be obtained by a suitable spin flip transformation starting from the the bi - partite af system with @xmath143 .",
    "similarly , all distributions of an odd number of @xmath62-signs are equivalent up to spin flip transformations .",
    "hence it will be enough to consider only one of these , say , the ring with one negative coupling constant between @xmath7 and @xmath70 : @xmath149    this system will be called the frustrated @xmath9-ring .",

    "since this result can be confirmed by using the same methods as in section [ sec : e1 ] , we leave the details to the reader .",
    "another way to generalize the bell square is to consider  frustrated hypercubes \" @xmath10 with @xmath170 vertices and @xmath171 .",
