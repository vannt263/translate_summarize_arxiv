    "it is well known that the equation satisfied by a world - line @xmath1 of a massive charged particle in a @xmath0-dimensional riemannian space - time in presence of an electromagnetic field is given by @xmath2 in this expression , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the mass and the charge , respectively , of a test particle , @xmath5 is the @xmath0-dimensional proper time and the electromagnetic field @xmath6 is defined by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the vector potential .",
    "the @xmath9 are the @xmath0-dimensional christoffel symbols .",
    "the second term of the above equation represents the inertial force whereas the last term is the lorentz force .",
    "the study of geodesics in multidimensional theories of kaluza - klein type has been performed by many authors @xcite - @xcite in quite an exhaustive manner .",
    "it has been known since the very beginning @xcite that , in the simplest version of the theory ( without scalar field ) , the geodesic equation in @xmath10 dimensions coincides with the geodesic equation in @xmath0 dimensions with an extra term which can be identified with the lorentz force .",
    "indeed , in @xmath10 dimensions , the geodesic equation is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the @xmath10-dimensional interval length , and the brackets @xmath13 are the @xmath10-dimensional christoffel symbols .",
    "projecting this equation under the assumption that all the quantities are independent of the fifth coordinate , @xmath14 , it is easy to establish , using the formulae displayed in the appendix , that one obtains @xmath15 the second equation , telling us that the quantity @xmath16 is constant along the @xmath10-dimensional geodesics parametrized by @xmath12 , reflects the fact that the backgrounds have been chosen such that @xmath17 is a cyclic co - ordinate . since we have the following relation between the squares of the intervals in @xmath10 and @xmath0 dimensions : @xmath18 which amounts to @xmath19 , we see that the @xmath0-dimensional equation ( [ geo4 ] ) is recovered provided that we make the following identification : @xmath20 this means that we suppose that @xmath21 , so that @xmath22 is timelike whenever @xmath23 is timelike , and vice versa . a more general situation is discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "the non - abelian generalization has been considered in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "since the multidimensional theories of kaluza - klein type are constructed as copies of einstein s general relativity theory in more than @xmath0 dimensions , all the usual mathematical corollaries remain valid .",
    "for example , it is possible to cancel the christoffel symbols along a given geodesic curve by an appropriate choice of coordinates , which amounts to the annulation of forces acting on a test particle moving along that geodesic line . in @xmath0 dimensions ,",
    "the cancellation along the worldline of the @xmath10-dimensional christoffel symbols may be interpreted as the simultaneous compensation of gravitational and the lorentz forces by an appropriate acceleration field .",
    "it is also a well known fact that such cancellation can be performed along only one given geodesic line at once , but not necessarily along all its neighbors .",
    "this fact becomes obvious when one looks at the _ geodesic deviation _",
    "equation @xmath24 where @xmath25 is an infinitesimal `` geodesic deviation '' vector , and @xmath26 denotes the pull - back of covariant derivatives along the time - like geodesics . for a massive _ and _ charged test particle in the presence of both gravitational and electromagnetic fields ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 )",
    ", it is not difficult to derive the generalized world - line deviation equation by taking direct variation of the world - line equation ( [ geo4 ] ) : @xmath29,\\ ] ] here the riemann tensor appears explicitly , making it automatically impossible to cancel its influence by any local or global coordinate or gauge transformations .",
    "this is why the study of the geodesic deviation in multidimensional theories , which reads @xmath30 is of particular interest . indeed ,",
    "when explicited in the form that splits up the @xmath0-dimensional space - time and the @xmath31-dimensional internal space , _ a priori _ , new terms show up , containing quadratic expressions of the type @xmath32 appearing in the @xmath10-dimensional riemann tensor ( cf .",
    "appendix ) , that can not be foreseen or derived from a purely @xmath0-dimensional point of view , even if one tries to introduce the interaction of charges with gauge and scalar fields .",
    "it will fix in a canonical way the terms describing the purely gravitational influence of those fields , which by their energy density must influence the trajectories of chargeless massive particles , too , provoking tidal effects which should deform the initially parallel geodesic lines .",
    "= n y    hence the question arises whether calculation of the geodesic deviation after reduction to 4 dimensions yields the same result as projecting the 5-dimensonal geodesic deviations to 4 dimensions , rendering the diagram of fig .  1 commutative .",
    "this is of course an important issue since any difference could be used to discriminate a purely @xmath0-dimensional theory from a kaluza - klein approach .",
    "the purpose of this short technical note is to address this question . to our knowledge",
    ", the analysis of this problem can not be found in the existing literature , and we believe that the present study will close this gap , and in addition , will shed some new light on the interplay between the gauge fields and gravitation , and on the interpretation of the equivalence principle in multidimensional theories as well .",
    "we consider here the version of the @xmath10-dimensional kaluza - klein theory in which the scalar field @xmath34 is put equal to @xmath35 from the beginning , which makes the field equations arising from the variational principle in @xmath10 dimensions strictly equivalent to the einstein - maxwell system .",
    "we shall perform all the calculations in a holonomous coordinate system in order to make the interpretation of the geodesic equations and the affine parameters as straightforward as possible .",

    "the derivatives with respect to @xmath10-dimensional interval @xmath22 should be replaced by the derivatives with respect to the @xmath0-dimensional proper time @xmath37 .",
    "next , the second - order covariant derivative appearing on the right - hand side and containing the @xmath10-dimensional connection coefficients and their partial derivatives , has to be expressed in terms of ordinary derivatives and @xmath0-dimensional christoffel symbols along with the gauge - invariant quantities containing the faraday tensor @xmath38 .",
    "the relation between the covariant derivations with respect to the parameters @xmath22 ( the @xmath10-dimensional line element ) and @xmath37 ( particle s proper time in @xmath0 space - time dimensions ) is quite complicated when it comes to the second - order covariant derivatives .",
    "this is why we omit all the intermediary calculations , giving here the final result .",
    "the second covariant derivatives are related as follows for the @xmath0-dimensional components of a given @xmath10-dimensional vector @xmath39 : @xmath40.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] combining equations ( [ geomu ] ) and ( [ der54 ] ) and using homogeneous maxwell s equations , @xmath41 and the identification of the physical charge - to - mass ratio ( [ identify ] ) , one obtains @xmath42 + f^{\\mu } { } _ { \\lambda } \\frac{{\\rm d } x^{\\lambda } } { { \\rm d } \\tau } \\biggl[\\frac{{\\rm d}}{{\\rm d}\\tau } ( a_{\\kappa}\\delta x^{\\kappa } + \\delta x^5)+f_{\\kappa \\rho } \\frac{{\\rm d } x^{\\kappa } } { { \\rm d } \\tau } \\delta x^{\\rho } \\biggr].\\ ] ] this equation would coincide with the usual @xmath0-dimensional deviation equation ( [ devi4f ] ) if it were not for the last term , which contains the standard lorentz force multiplied by the expression in square brackets , linear in the infinitesimal deviation vector . however , it is easily recognized that the last term just represents the deviation of the 5th component of the momentum @xmath43 , which by equation ( [ eom ] ) is conserved , and which we identified with the charge through equation ( [ identify ] ) : @xmath44.\\ ] ] it is noteworthy that the same result can be obtained by using the simpler , but non - covariant form of the geodesic deviation equation ( [ devi5 ] ) : @xmath45 which makes the calculations much less tedious .",
    "the fifth component of the previous equation leads to @xmath46   = 0.\\ ] ] which means that @xmath47 is indeed a constant . from a purely mathematical point of view",
    ", this constant can take on any real value , depending on the arbitrary choice of _ initial conditions _",
    ", which include the initial values of _ ten _ variables , @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( 0)$ ] , as it is the case for any system of five ordinary differential equations of second order .",
    "the fact that @xmath47 is a constant means that not all the initial data can be independent . as a matter of fact , the first derivative of the fifth component of the deviation , @xmath50 ( 0)$ ] , is an imposed function of the four - dimensional initial deviations , namely @xmath51(0).\\ ] ] requiring that @xmath52 is the condition which must be imposed if we want to maintain a one - to - one correspondence between the geodesic deviation equation in @xmath10-dimensional kaluza - klein space and the usual deviation equation in presence of the electromagnetic field in @xmath0 dimensions .",
    "now , returning to equation ( [ inter ] ) , we get the final result that can be stated very simply as follows : 0.2 cm _ the space - time projection of the five - dimensional kaluza - klein geodesic deviation equation yields for fixed @xmath43 the usual four - dimensional world - line deviation equation in the presence of both gravitational and electromagnetic fields , for particles of the same @xmath53 ; geodesic deviations between five - dimensional worldlines with different values of @xmath43 describe the four - dimensional deviation of world - lines for particles with different values of @xmath53 . _ 0.2 cm",
    "the only influence of the electromagnetic fields on chargeless particles comes through the term linear in the @xmath0-dimensional riemann tensor , which is a solution of the coupled einstein - maxwell equations ( see ref .",
    "although the final answer to the problem of the projection of the geodesic deviation equation from the 5-dimensional kaluza - klein metric space onto its 4-dimensional space - time basis is very simple and does not bring any surprise , it is worth to be checked ( the above calculations have never been published elsewhere , at least to our knowledge ) , and does not seem to be totally trivial . it can be interpreted as a strong _ equivalence principle _",
    "generalized to the @xmath10-dimensional theory incorporating electromagnetism into geometry .",
    "our result can be easily generalized to the non - abelian case @xcite , @xcite , where the conservation of charge @xmath43 is replaced by a condition on the rotation of the charge isovector in the lie algebra space in which it takes its value .",
    "there is no guarantee that the higher - order deviation equations , obtained with a similar technique of new independent variation of einstein - maxwell equations do also project properly , although such a statement seems very plausible .",
    "however , the introduction of the _ dilaton field _ , i.e. supposing that the radius of the compactified 5-th dimension depends on the space - time position @xmath54 , may bring new effects leading to certain anomalies in the deviation equation and its projection onto the usual space - time . one can apply a similar technique of probing the deviations to the equations of motions of the @xmath55 embedded in multi - dimensional spaces , which represent a natural generalization of geodesic curves in kaluza - klein theories .",
    "these developments should become the object of another independent study .",
    "the @xmath10-dimensional metric tensor of the theory reads ( @xmath56 ) : @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 , which means that we consider that both @xmath60 and @xmath61 do not depend on the fifth coordinate @xmath62 . here",
    "are the christoffel symbols of the metric ( [ 5metric ] ) : @xmath63 with this in mind , we can proceed with the computation of the components of @xmath10-dimensional riemann tensor in a holonomous system . using the convention : @xmath64 and",
    "after some calculus , using also the bianchi identities satisfied by the tensor @xmath38 , we get : @xmath65 here the greek indices @xmath66 are raised and lowered by means of the @xmath0-dimensional metric tensors @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
