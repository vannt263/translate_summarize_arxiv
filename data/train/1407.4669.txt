    "<S> motivated by the wide range of known self - replicating systems , some far from genetics , we study a system composed by individuals having an internal dynamics with many possible states that are partially stable , with varying mutation rates . </S>",
    "<S> individuals reproduce and die with a rate that is a property of each state , not necessarily related to its stability , and the offspring is born on the parent s state . </S>",
    "<S> the total population is limited by resources or space , as for example in a chemostat or a petri dish . </S>",
    "<S> our aim is to show that mutation rate and fitness become more correlated , _ even if they are completely uncorrelated for an isolated individual _ , underlining the fact that the interaction induced by limitation of resources is by itself efficient for generating collective effects .    </S>",
    "<S> this work concerns the population dynamics of a system of self - replicating individuals , with complex internal dynamics , where the state of the system is not necessarily characterized by a genum , but could also be the transcriptional situation . . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , genetic mutation rates themselves may vary by many orders of magnitude @xcite , and epigenetic changes occur at yet another set of time - scales @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , in systems that have not yet undergone a long process of evolution , mutation rates might not be much smaller than growth rates .    </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of this paper is to study the effect that the spread of mutation rates has on the population development , through its interplay with fitness of the individuals , and to do so in a setting which assumes as little as possible about the individuals internal structure . given the wide range of disparate systems which are able to self - replicate and subsequently evolve , it is natural to ask what phenomena will be common to many of them . </S>",
    "<S> a ` null model ' for such a general situation should include as little as possible of details of the systems phase - space ( ` phenotypes ' ) and dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> for example , we wish to exclude effects of long memory of the state in a _ </S>",
    "<S> single _ individual after many mutations , which may be highly relevant for genetics , and indeed lead to effects such as genetic ` hitchhiking ' effects , or to the length of adaptive walks , where an individual wanders on a given landscape @xcite . in genetics , </S>",
    "<S> mutation rates are often low compared to growth rates , and can often be taken to be constant or assumed to have a small number of values . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the stability of a dynamical self - replication state ( interpreted as an inverse mutation rate ) may vary significantly between states , and can not be taken a - priori as much lower than growth rates .    to model the individuals dynamics , trap models @xcite </S>",
    "<S> have been extensively used to give simple descriptions to highly complex systems , including relaxation of glasses and rehology of soft and biological materials @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> trap models have no memory of the state after leaving it , and the new state is chosen at random . </S>",
    "<S> the model is therefore fully characterized by the distribution of trap ` stabilities ' , the average times spent in a given trap . by considering a population of systems with </S>",
    "<S> can also self - replicate , the resulting model belongs to the house - of - cards class of models @xcite , but with a large dispersion of mutation rates . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of multiple mutation rates has been studied in the past @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we are interested here specifically in the phenomena derived from the combination of _ </S>",
    "<S> ( i ) _ a large number possible states ( as one may envision in a cellular system with more than a few phenotypic switches ) and _ ( ii ) _ a large dispersion in the mutation rates . </S>",
    "<S> individuals interact _ only _ via some constraint on the total population size , due to limitations such as space or nutrients . </S>",
    "<S> some of our results are , as we shall see , remarkably insensitive to details .      </S>",
    "<S> we shall assume that the system has @xmath0 individuals , with an internal dynamics that has states or attractors ( for example a ` cell fate ' ) labeled ` * * a * * ' that are not fully stable , mutations are random with probability per unit time @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> being in a state * a * confers an individual a rate of reproduction , @xmath2 per unit time . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , each individual is characterized by a pair of numbers @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics is as follows : when an individual leaves a state @xmath4 , it may fall on another state @xmath5 with probability @xmath6 , which defines the distribution of states , and is independent of @xmath4 . after a replication , which is asexual , the two daughters inherit the state of the parent . </S>",
    "<S> we will work in the limit where the number of attractors @xmath7 is very large , so that the chances of falling twice in the same one are negligible . </S>",
    "<S> this means that within this model if two individuals have exactly the same @xmath5 , they are in the same state as their common ancestor and have never mutated . </S>",
    "<S> this model may be viewed as a ` house of cards ' model with variable mutation rates @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , it is a ` trap model ' @xcite with added self - replication .    </S>",
    "<S> reproduction rates can not be arbitrarily large because of physical constraints , so the distribution must be bounded , @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> on the contrary , mutational timescales @xmath9 might be quite large , as one may conceive that , for example , some phenotypic ` cell fates ' may be very stable . </S>",
    "<S> we shall thus consider @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is always small , even zero . </S>",
    "<S> although mutations and fitness may be directly correlated , it is instructive and simpler on a first approach to consider them independent ; _ especially because one of the main purposes of this paper is to pinpoint the correlations that develop in a population but are absent for a single individual_. we shall thus choose a product form @xmath12 @xmath13 is defined for @xmath10 , which we shall often take as @xmath14 . for small @xmath15 </S>",
    "<S> we shall consider below a power law ( @xmath16 ) , and more rapidly decaying distributions @xmath17 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we shall assume the distribution of @xmath18 falls to zero above some @xmath19 , as @xmath20 , with @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> the independence of the distributions corresponds to the assumption of absence of a mechanism tailored to tune mutation rates of an individual according to the external conditions . </S>",
    "<S> another possibility we could have considered is that the independent variables are @xmath18 and @xmath22 : @xmath23 in order to complete the definition , it is natural to assume that some mechanism , such as the total amount of food or space , constrains the population . in both cases </S>",
    "<S> , our conclusion will be that _ a priori _ uncorrelated fitness and mutation rates become correlated through natural selection . </S>"
