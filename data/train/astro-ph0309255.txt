    "since accurate measurements of the deuterium abundances are important for understanding the early history of the universe and galactic chemical evolution , investigators have pursued a variety of techniques to measure d / h in different locations . as reviewed by linsky ( 2003 )",
    ", these techniques include the study of ( 1 ) deuterated molecules in cold interstellar clouds , ( 2 ) hd / h@xmath0 in the ism , ( 3 ) deuterium balmer-@xmath1 emission in the orion nebula , ( 4 ) 92 cm emission from the hyperfine transition line of d  i in the ism , ( 5 ) d / h in the solar photosphere , ( 6 ) d / h in comets , meteorites , and planetary atmospheres , and ( 7 ) deuterium lyman line absorption in warm interstellar gas .",
    "the last technique has proven to be the most accurate because in the warm ( @xmath2  k ) component of the ism there are very few molecules , depletion of h and d onto grains is minimal , and the ionization equilibria of d and h are very similar .",
    "thus measurements of the d  i and h  i column densities , n(d  i ) and n(h  i ) , directly provide the d / h total abundance ratio .",
    "however , the factor of @xmath3 difference in the abundances of d and h means that the interstellar h lyman lines are all very optically thick , whereas the d lyman lines are optically thin . thus this technique must be applied with care as the extremely thick lyman lines of h may contain unresolved absorption components not seen in lines of any other element and small errors in the assumed background continuum can result in large errors in the h column density and thus the d / h ratio .",
    "high s / n : : :    signal / noise @xmath4 is highly desirable especially for    column densities n(h  i ) @xmath5 @xmath6    when the wings of the ly-@xmath1 line are not yet strong    and n(h  i ) must be measured from the outer edges of the absorption    line core .",
    "knowledge of the line of sight : : :    the low mass h and d lines are broadened primarily by thermal motions    and thus provide little information on the velocity structure along    the line of sight .",
    "the intrinsically narrow lines of heavier ions like    mg  ii and fe  ii provide information on the doppler motions ( systematic    and turbulent ) along the line of sight .",
    "it is important to include    this information to the analysis of the very saturated h lines since    small errors in the nonthermal broadening of these lines due to not    including the doppler shifts of h  i along the line of sight can    translate into very large errors in n(h  i ) .",
    "high spectral resolution : : :    to disentangle the velocity structure along a line of sight , spectral    resolution comparable to the spacing of the velocity components is    required .",
    "welty et al . (",
    "1996 ) showed that even resolutions of 0.31.0    km  s@xmath7 , are inadequate to fully resolve the    interstellar velocity structure observed with the ca  ii k line .",
    "it is    likely that the velocity structure for warm interstellar h  i gas will    have similar velocity structure . since the thermal width of the h  i    lines is about 10 km  s@xmath7 , the inferred d / h ratio will    be an average value for the line of sight .",
    "it is essential , however ,    to include the velocity structure when deriving n(h  i ) from the shape    of the interstellar absorption .",
    "a resolution better than 5    km  s@xmath7 is needed to measure n(h  i ) from the shape of    the outer edges of the interstellar absorption .",
    "low n(h  i ) : : :    since the h and d lyman lines are separated by only 82    km  s@xmath7 , there will be a `` horizon '' for each lyman    line set by the value of n(h  i ) when the interstellar h absorption    becomes so broad that the d line can not be observed . the horizon is    @xmath8 @xmath6 for    ly-@xmath1 and @xmath9    @xmath6 for ly-@xmath10 . while hst can    observe the ly-@xmath1 line , the far ultraviolet    spectrometer explorer ( fuse )",
    "is needed to study ly-@xmath10    and the higher lyman lines which have more distant horizons .",
    "depending    on the value of n(h  i ) along the line of sight and how accurately it    can be measured , various strategies have been employed to measure d / h    bny measuring n(d  i ) from different lines than are used for measuring    n(h  i ) and by using proxies like n(o  i ) for estimating n(h  i ) ( see    below ) . also , n(h",
    "i ) can be measured from the lyman continuum    absoprtion observed , for example , by euve .",
    "knowledge of the `` continuum '' : : :    for hot white dwarfs , subdwarfs , and oba stars , the stellar lyman    lines are absorption features , while for late - type stars the lyman    lines are in emission . since the interstellar absorption is broad , one    can not simply interpolate the intrinsic stellar flux from the emission    outside of the lyman line cores , but instead one must compute the    stellar line shape using a model atmosphere program or estimate the    line shape from comparison with other stars line the sun .",
    "the former    approach typically used for the hotter stars requires that one know    the stellar parameters accurately , while the latter approach typically    used for late - type stars requires that one know the intrinsic shape of    the line in the comparison star . both approaches are sources of    systematic error in the inferred d / h ratio .",
    "knowledge of the heliosphere and astrosphere : : :    the interaction via charge exchange between the ionized solar ( or    stellar ) wind and the inflowing partially ionized ism gas leads to    additional neutral h absorption . the heliospheric absorption is    redshifted relative to the ism for all viewing angles and the    astrospheric absorption is blueshifted ( cf .",
    "wood et al .",
    "since    the heliospheric and astrospheric absorption in h  i is not very    optically thick , there is negligible absorption in d and metal lines",
    ".    the heliospheric and astrospheric absorption can be very important    because it broadens the total absorption in the h lyman lines .",
    "if not    properly modelled , this extra absorption would appear to be    interstellar , raising the inferred n(h  i ) and thereby lowering the    inferred d / h ratio for the line of sight .",
    "the problem is h : : :    for most galactic lines of sight studied so far , the errors in n(h  i )    usually exceed those in n(d  i ) , since the h lines are very optically    thick . also , the hard to estimate systematic errors usually exceed    random measurement errors .",
    "one should keep this in mind when using d / h    measurements reported in the literature .",
    "table 1.1 lists the various satellites and instruments that have been used to measure d / h using uv and far - uv spectrographs .",
    "the fourth column of the table lists the target stars observed giving their spectral types and whether they are a white dwarf ( wd ) or subdwarf ( sd ) .",
    "d / h values are published for the ism along these lines of sight , but for some of the older data sets ( especially iue ) the d / h values are not very accurate and will not be used later in this paper .",
    "* unlike the observed constant value inside of the lb , the gas phase measurements of di / oi outside of the lb show very credible variations with a range ( 1.35.9)@xmath11 . this range is more than a factor of 4 ! * by contrast , the hst gas phase observations of oi / hi beyond the lb show very little variation with a mean value @xmath12 .",
    "measurements of oi / hi based on data from fuse and other satellites show some scatter but are consistent with the hst result . *",
    "if we adopt the hst value for oi / hi in the gas phase , then the di / oi ratios imply that di / hi lies in the range 4.320.2 ppm .",
    "since some of the oxygen is condensed on to grains , the inferred d / h ratios will be somewhat higher .",
    "moos et al .",
    "( 2002 ) estimate that 25% of the oxygen in the lb could reside in grains , and jenkins ( 2003 ) provides additional support for this estimate .",
    "if this rough estimate is representative of the region within 12 kps of the sun , then the inferred range in d / h rises to 5.526.0 ppm , which is similar to the directly measured range in d / h of 5.021.8 ppm ( table 1.4 ) .",
    "thus the two methods of determining d / h are consistent , implying that no large systematic errors are present . *",
    "the question of whether the sun is metal rich compared with the ism has been raised many times . if we adopt the meyer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) value for oi / hi in the ism gas phase and the most recent ( and lowest ) value for the solar o / h ratio ( allende prieto et al .",
    "2001 ) , then the sun is oxygen rich by the factor 490 ppm/343 ppm = 1.43 ( 0.16 dex ) . if , on the other hand , we assume that 25% of oxygen is condensed on to grains , then the ratio becomes 490/457 = 1.07 ( 0.03 dex ) .",
    "thus the sun either has the present interstellar abundance of oxygen , or , if there is minimal depletion of oxygen in the ism , the sun is slightly oxygen rich . *",
    "the extent to which primordial deuterium has been burned by nuclear reactions in stars to form heavier elements is often called the astration factor , a = ( d / h)@xmath13/(d / h)@xmath14 . if we assume that the most recent value of d / h for 5 quasars with low metal abundances is close to the primordial value , then in the lb we have a = ( d / h)@xmath13/(d / h)@xmath15 = @xmath16 . * beyond the lb and extending out to 12 kpc , the astration factors appear to have a wide range of values from 1.3 to 5.6 .",
    "this very large range in the astration factor over a small portion of our galaxy challenges contemporary galactic chemical evolution models as i will describe below . *",
    "since deuterium is destroyed and oxygen created over time , one might expect that the o / h and d / h ratios are inversely correlated .",
    "in fact there is as yet little evidence of any correlation ( moos et al .",
    "could there be something missing in the galactic chemical evolution models ?",
    "[ [ can - the - do - measurements - be - reconciled - with - galactic - chemical - evolution ] ] can the d / o measurements be reconciled with galactic chemical evolution ? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~      if galactic chemical evolution occurs in a closed box in which the original gas is nearly primordial and evolution proceeds without the input of extragalactic material , then one expects d / h to decrease monotonically with time and o / h to increase . in this simplest of chemical evolution models , one would expect to see an anticorrelation of d / h and o / h when one samples different parcels of gas with different chemical histories .",
    "this scenario is rather simple , but it does suggest that we search for an anticorrelation of d and o in he fuse data .",
    "moos et al .",
    "( 2002 ) did this by plotting o / h vs d / h and d / o vs d / h for the nine sightlines for which good measurements were available .",
    "they concluded that there was no significant anticorrelation , although there is a hint of decreasing d / o with increasing o / h .",
    "steigman ( 2003 ) also says that there is a hint of an anticorrelation between d / o and o / h .",
    "observations of more sightlines is needed to verify or refute this hint .",
    "geiss , gloeckler , and charbonnel ( 2002 ) have developed an empirical approach to explaining the present abundances of d / h , o / h , n / h , and @xmath17he / h in the lic that has interesting implications .",
    "they start with the abundances of the protosolar nebula measured in the most primitive material in the solar system , specifically d / h = @xmath18 ppm and o / h = @xmath19 ppm .",
    "they also assume that at the beginning of the galaxy , d / h = @xmath20 ppm and o / h = 0 , and that the rate of galactic chemical evolution is constant with time . then extrapolating the primordial abundances forward 4.6 gyr to the present",
    ", they predict that in the closed box approximation d / h = 12 ppm and o / h = 710 ppm .",
    "since d / h is too low , o / h too high , and the other ratios are also inconsistent with the lic values , they look for an alternative solution .",
    "the input of less evolved gas from outside of the galaxy would increase d / h and lower o / h , leading to better agreement with the lic values .",
    "geiss et al .",
    "( 2002 ) assumed that the gas falling into the galaxy in the region of the sun during the last 4.6 gyr was similar in composition to the lmc with d / h = 27 ppm and o / h = 160 ppm ( 30% of the protosolar nebular value ) .",
    "the abundances of d / h , o / h , n / h , and @xmath17he / h are consistent with lic values if the total gas includes a mixture of 3044% infalling material with the chemical composition of the lmc .    this purely empirical model demonstrates the need for infalling gas to explain the abundances of deuterium and oxygen in the local region of our galaxy .",
    "the observations of large variations in d / o over distance scales of several hundred parsecs would suggest spatially and perhaps time dependent differences in the infall rate and long mixing timescales .",
    "recent theoretical models of chemical evolution in the galaxy provide different scenarios for the input of relatively unprocessed material into the galaxy .",
    "for example , chiappini , renda , and matteucci ( 2002 ) compute a `` two - infall '' model to explain the halo and thin disk .",
    "their model explains the d / h , @xmath17he / h , and @xmath21he / h ratios near the sun .",
    "they find that the value of d / h is very sensitive to both the infall rate and the star formation rate .",
    "their predicted astration rate is @xmath22 in the solar neighborhood and increases gradually to @xmath23 in the thin disk at 2 kpc from galactic center .",
    "these astration rates cover the range of astration that we already see within a few hundred pc of the sun .",
    "this suggests that the spatial variations in the infall and stellar formation rates are much larger than assumed in the chiappini et al .",
    "( 2002 ) models , and that the time scales for mixing are very long .",
    "before i complete this summary of deuterium as a tool for measuring chemical inhomogeneity in our galaxy , let us consider whether there could be a systematic error in the way that we measure the d / h ratio .",
    "there are four important questions to answer :    1 .",
    "could the deuterium abundances be very inaccurate ?",
    "i do not think so because the d / h ratios measured directly from the lyman lines and indirectly through the di / oi ratio are in substantial agreement .",
    "also the d / h measurements obtained with hst and fuse toward many different types of stars by different authors using different analysis software are in excellent agreement for sightlines inside of the lb bubble .",
    "there is no reason for expecting that a major systematic error should begin just as we consider sightlines outside of the lb .",
    "could the deuterium absorption lines actually be blueshifted stellar hydrogen ? in the copernicus observations of ob stars , one occasionally sees transient extra absorption near the location of the deuterium lines ( -81 km s@xmath7 from the hydrogen line ) , presumably produced by transient absorption in the stellar wind .",
    "the fuse onservations , on the other hand , are mostly of white dwarfs and hot subdwarfs that do not show low velocity wind features .",
    "thus there is no reason to presume that the deuterium lines are not genuine .",
    "could a significant amount of deuterium be tied up in molecules ? in the fuse observations of white dwarfs very few h@xmath0 lines and no hd lines are observed . in particular , jenkins et al .",
    "( 1999 ) detected no hd lines toward @xmath24  ori  a , a line of sight with low d / h .",
    "thus n(h@xmath0)/n(hi ) @xmath25 and n(hd)/n(hi ) is very much smaller .",
    "4 .   could a significant amount of deuterium be tied up in grains as originally suggested by jura ( 1982 ) ? even in the warm ism , grains are cold and the binding energy of deuterium to carbon or metals on the surface of grains is slightly larger than for hydrogen . a serious calculation of this process is needed to address this question .",
    "draine ( 2003 ) calculates that extreme d - enrichment of carbonaceous grains is possible in the absence of grain destruction processes .",
    "accurate measurements of interstellar deuterium abundances along lines of sight extending out to several hundred parsecs by fuse and other instruments is making d / h a useful tool for understanding galactic chemical evolution .",
    "i believe that the new d / h measurements directly from the lyman line absorption and indirectly from the d / o ratio are credible and for the most part may not have systematic errors .",
    "we find that the gas inside the local bubble is chemically homogeneous , but that large variations in d / h beyond the local bubble are real and challenge present concepts of chemical evolution .",
    "a new set of models is needed that will include spatially dependent infall of relatively unprocessed material and the timescales for mixing should be investigated .",
    "i would like to thank the fuse science team for providing the beautiful data upon which much of this paper is based .",
    "i also thank seth redfield and brian wood for helpful discussions on this topic .",
    "this work is supported by nasa through grants to the johns hopkins university and to the university of colorado ."
