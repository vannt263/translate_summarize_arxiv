    "it has long been known that noise can significantly affect physical and biological dynamical systems at a wide variety of levels .",
    "for example , in biology , noise can play a role in sub - cellular processes , tissue dynamics , and large - scale population dynamics  @xcite .",
    "stochasticity can arise in a number of ways .",
    "for example , in epidemiological models , noise is due to the random interactions of individuals in a population as well as uncertainty in epidemic parameter values  @xcite . in population ecology",
    ", noise may be the result of environmental factors including climatic effects , natural enemies , or inter - specific competition , or may be due to demography  @xcite .",
    "stochasticity manifests itself as either external or internal noise .",
    "external noise comes from a source outside the system being considered ( e.g the growth of a species under climatic effects ) , and often is modeled by replacing an external parameter with a random process .",
    "internal noise is inherent in the system itself and is caused by the random interactions of discrete particles ( e.g. individuals in a population ) . in this article , we are interested in the dynamics of an isolated single - species population undergoing a set of random gain - loss processes that simulate births and deaths .",
    "thus , in this particular case , the internal noise of the population model is demographic noise .",
    "mathematically , the effects of these random interactions are described using a master equation  @xcite .",
    "small fluctuations captured in this modeling approach may act as an effective force that drives the population to extinction  @xcite . while population extinction is assumed to be a rare event",

    "for single populations , it has long been recognized that extinction risk is dependent on the carrying capacity of the model  @xcite .",
    "mathematically , the carrying capacity is a positive stable equilibrium in the deterministic model . in this paper",
    ", we consider a population with multiple deterministic stable equilibria where the population size can stochastically fluctuate between these states .",
    "one such example can be found in the data of forest lepidoptera  @xcite as shown in fig .",

    "the drastic population shifts are attributed to a mix of parasitoids , viral outbreak among the moths , and the quality of the available foliage  @xcite .",

    "regardless of the specific context , it is useful to increase our understanding of pre - extinction dynamics , as well as the mean time to extinction and the path that optimizes the probability of extinction .    in this article",

    "it provides an example of the analytical and numerical methods used to find the mean time to extinction .",
    "pre - extinction cycling is considered in section [ sec : cycling ] and the probabilistic result used to describe pre - extinction dynamics is derived .",
    "a control term is introduced in section [ sec : control ] to increase the rate of extinction in the model .",
    "the methods from the previous sections are used to quantify the effects of the control . in the last section ,",
    "we generalize these results and give a brief discussion .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , to study the effects of internal noise on the dynamics of a population , a stochastic model must be considered .",
