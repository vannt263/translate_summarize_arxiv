    "the recent advent of the neutrino oscillation data from super - kamiokande has provided a solid evidence that neutrinos have small but non - zero masses",
    ". the global fit to current data from neutrino oscillation experiments give the following best fit values and @xmath2 limits for the mixing parameters  @xcite , @xmath3 in addition , recent analyses  @xcite from the bari group have given hints on possible non - zero value for @xmath4 , with @xmath5 at @xmath6 .",
    "since then , the measurements of neutrino oscillation parameters have entered a precision era . in the standard model , due to the lack of right - handed neutrinos and lepton number conservation , neutrinos",
    "are massless . to generate non - zero neutrino masses thus calls for physics beyond the standard model .",
    "there have been many theoretical ideas proposed with an attempt to accommodate the experimentally observed small neutrino masses and the larger mixing angles among them .",
    "most of the models are either based on grand unification combined with family symmetries or having family symmetries in the lepton sector only .",
    "recently , it was realized that small neutrino masses can also arise with new physics at the tev scale , contrary to the common belief that the scale of the seesaw mechanism has to be high . in this talk , we review some of these ideas as well as the predictions of various existing models . for more extensive reviews , see , for example , ref .  @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "in the conventional wisdom , the smallness of the neutrino masses is tied to the high scale of the new physics that generates neutrino masses .",
    "as the new physics scale is high , it is very hard , if not impossible , to probe such new physics at current collider experiments . in @xcite ,",
    "an alternative was proposed in which the small neutrino masses are generated with tev scale physics .",
    "this allows the possibility of testing the new physics that gives rise to neutrino masses at the tevatron and the lhc .",
    "this is achieved by augmenting the standard model with a non - anomalous @xmath7 symmetry and @xmath8 right - handed neutrinos . due to the presence of the @xmath7 symmetry ,",
    "neutrino masses can only be generated by operators with very high dimensionality , which in turn allows a low cut - off scale .",
    "the new anomaly cancellation conditions are highly non - trivial , especially because all fermion charges are expected to be commensurate . nevertheless , assuming that all quark yukawa couplings and all diagonal charged - lepton yukawa couplings to the standard model higgs doublet @xmath9 are gauge invariant , it is found that the most general solution to the anomaly cancellation conditions when @xmath10 or 3 . only in the @xmath11 case , scenarios consistent with light neutrino masses and @xmath12 at the tev scale were found . for @xmath11 ,",
    "the charges of all quarks and leptons ( including right - handed neutrinos ) are determined in terms of four rational parameters , assumig one of the fermion charges is fixed by an appropriate normalization of the gauge coupling .",
    "there exist regions in the parameter space that fit the neutrino oscillation data . depending on the choice of parameters",
    ", the neutrinos can be either dirac or majorana fermions . in scenarios with majorana neutrinos , the existence of `` quasi - sterile '' neutrinos that mix slightly with the active neutrinos and couple to the new @xmath13 gauge boson is predicted .",
    "these quasi - sterile neutrinos may have interesting phenomenological consequences for cosmology and oscillation physics . in the case of dirac neutrinos ,",
    "potentially observable consequences of the new degrees of freedom are also predicted .    because the @xmath7 symmetry is spontaneously broken at around the weak scale , the @xmath13 gauge boson and the particles from the @xmath7 breaking sector will manifest themselves in a variety of interesting ways .",
    "@xmath13 exchange can mediate neutral - fermion flavor violating processes , which may be observable in next - generation neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "the new heavy states can be discovered in current and upcoming collider experiments , enabling the possibility of probing the neutrino sector at the collider experiments .",
    "it was claimed  @xcite that in susy gut models , in order to generate realistic fermion masses and mixing angles from a @xmath1 family symmetry , the gauge anomalies can only be cancelled by the green - schwarz mechanism , and thus the @xmath1 must be anomalous . however ,",
    "this is not a no - go theorem , and in the model described below , solutions that satisfy all the gauge anomaly cancellation conditions and at the same time accommodate realistic fermion mass patterns have been found to exist .      in ref .",
    "@xcite , a non - anomalous @xmath1 was proposed as a family symmetry , in a susy @xmath0 model .",
    "there are three anomaly cancellation conditions that must be satisfied : the @xmath14^{2}-u(1)$ ] mixed anomaly , the @xmath15-gravitation anomaly , and the @xmath16^{3}$ ] anomaly .",
    "the set of charges that satisfy these conditions are given in table  [ table:2 ] .",
    "these charges give rise to the following mass matrices , @xmath17 where @xmath18 with @xmath19 being the scalar field that breaks the @xmath1 family symmetry .",
    "for the neutrinos , @xmath20 leading to the following effective neutrino mass matrix , @xmath21    it is interesting to note that , the non - anomalous @xmath1 in this model also forbids operators that lead to proton decays mediated by the color - triplet higgsinos .",
    "in @xcite , a comparison of the predictions of some sixty - three models was presented .",
    "these include models based on @xmath22 , models that utilize single rh neutrino dominance mechanism , and models based on family symmetries such as @xmath23 symmetry , @xmath24 symmetry , @xmath25 symmetry , and @xmath26 symmetry , as well as models based on texture zero assumptions .",
    "the predictions of these models for @xmath27 are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : all ] .",
    "an observation one can draw immediately is that predictions of @xmath22 models are larger than @xmath28 , and the median value is roughly @xmath29 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath30 can only arise in models based on leptonic symmetries",
    ". however , these models are not as predictive as the gut models , due to the uncertainty in the charged lepton mixing matrix . in this case , to measure @xmath4 will require a neutrino superbeam or a neutrino factory .",
    "in addition to the value of @xmath4 , predictions for various lfv charged lepton processes can also be a powerful way to distinguish different models  @xcite .     from various models  @xcite .",
    "we review a few recent models for neutrino masses and mixing .",
    "we present a successful recent attempt based on a su(5 ) grand unified model combined with @xmath31 symmetry , in which both the tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing and realistic ckm mixing matrix are generated .",
    "a model based on non - anomalous @xmath1 in which small neutrino masses are generated with new physics at the tev scale has also been shown .",
    "we also describe a susuy su(5 ) model with non - anoumalous @xmath1 for fermion masses .",
    "a study of existing models indicates that the range of predictions for @xmath4 is very broad , although there are some characteristic model predictions with which more precise experimental measurements may tell different models apart .",
    "it is a great pleasure to thank the organizers , in particular professors gian luigi fogli and eligio lisi , for hosting such a stimulating workshop at the beautiful conca seaside , for the hospitality they had extended throughout the meeting , and for their kind invitation to speak at the workshop .",
    "thanks are also due to carl albright , andre degouvea , bogdan a. dobrescu , d. r. tim jones , arvind rajaraman and hai - bo yu for their collaborations on some of the works presented here .",
