    "the evidence for a massive bh in henize  2 - 10 comes from a wealth of multi - wavelength data @xcite , including very large array ( vla ) radio observations that reveal an unresolved non - thermal nuclear point source ( also see @xcite and @xcite ) .",

    "chandra _ observations of henize 2 - 10 in february 2015 .",
    "the total exposure time of @xmath0200  ks was broken up into two observations of 159066 s and 37577 s beginning on february 5 and 16 ( pi : reines , obsids 16068 and 16069 ) .",
    "these observations were taken in vfaint mode .",
    "we also retrieved the archival observation taken on 2001 march 23 ( pi : martin , obsid 2075 ) , which was taken in faint mode with an exposure time of 19755 s. in all three observations , the galaxy was placed on the s3 chip of the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) detector .",
    "the data were reduced and reprocessed with ciao version 4.6 @xcite utilizing caldb version 4.6.3 . to improve the image quality",
    ", the data were reprocessed with the edser algorithm enabled @xcite and subsequently rebinned to 1/8th the native acis pixel size before convolving with a fwhm=0.25@xmath8 gaussian .",
    "our spectral and variability analysis is performed on the event files .        to improve the astrometry , we co - aligned the three _ chandra _ observations and then tied the corrected images to the absolute reference frame defined by our radio observations , which is accurate to @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "we first averaged the coordinates of a bright point source common to all three _ chandra _ observations , yet outside the vicinity of the nuclear region .",
    "this reference source is located @xmath10 east of the nuclear radio source and has a corrected ( mean ) position of ra=8:36:15.83 , dec=@xmath1126:24:34.1 ( figure [ fig:3epochs ] ) .",
    "we then registered the three _ chandra _ observations by determining the relative offset between this mean position and the position of the reference source in an individual observation .",
    "the required ( ra , dec ) shifts in arcseconds are ( 017 w , 013 n ) , ( 008 e , 000 s ) , and ( 008 e , 013 s ) for the 20  ks , 160  ks , and 40  ks observations , respectively .",
    "there is no evidence for significant rotation between the different observations .",
    "a comparison between our deep 160  ks observation and the vla contours from @xcite indicates a close match between bright regions of x - ray and radio emission from recent star formation ( inset figure  [ fig : he210 ] ) , strongly suggesting the absolute astrometry of our corrected _ chandra _ observations is accurate and requires no additional shift .",

    "our primary goal in this letter is to examine the nuclear x - ray source in henize 2 - 10 . from figures [ fig : he210 ] and [ fig:3epochs ]",
    ", we can now see that a previously unidentified x - ray source is spatially coincident with the central radio source , hereafter referred to as the nuclear x - ray source ( visible in the 160 ks image at ra=8:36:15.12 , dec=@xmath1126:24:34.1 ) , and that the bright x - ray emission identified in the 2001 observation @xcite is dominated by an x - ray source ( ra=8:36:15.10 , dec=@xmath1126:24:33.5 ) distinct from the nuclear radio source .",
    "the spatial offset between the bright off - nuclear x - ray source in the subpixel image from 2001 and the vlbi position is @xmath15 ( @xmath16  pc projected ) .",
    "this offset is significantly larger than our astrometric uncertainties , and thus our conclusion that the hard x - ray source is distinct from the nuclear radio source is secure .",
    "this source is also highly variable  it dominates the emission in 2001 , is essentially absent in our new 160 ks observation , and returns in the 40 ks observation taken only 9 days later .",
    "the spectrum of the bright , off - nuclear variable source dominating the 2001 observation is poorly constrained , but consistent with a highly absorbed power - law ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) . assuming a common spectral shape in each of the three observations , we measure unabsorbed 0.3 - 10.0 kev fluxes of @xmath19 , and @xmath20 erg s@xmath21 @xmath22 respectively ( 90% confidence intervals ) , i.e. , variability of a factor of @xmath23 . the large - amplitude variability",

    "the background was estimated from a source - free annular region extending from 20 - 25@xmath8 centered on the nuclear source .",
    "we note that the external background contribution is negligible at the position of the nucleus ; however , we can not reliably separate the point source from any local background within the source extraction region .",
    "we obtained a total of 183 net counts .",
    "the spectrum was grouped to have snr=3 per bin , and spectral fits to the background subtracted spectrum were carried out within xspec 12.8.2q @xcite using the chi statistic and standard gaussian weighting .",
    "galactic foreground absorption was held fixed at @xmath46 @xmath22 @xcite and the internal absorption was found to be negligible .",
    "we used the ` phabs ` absorption model , with abundances and cross - sections adopted from @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",

    "both models give a consistent intrinsic luminosity of @xmath49 erg s@xmath21 .",
    "we also examine the temporal behavior of the nuclear x - ray emission during the 160 ks observation .",
    "utilizing the same extraction regions as used for the spectral analysis , a background subtracted light curve was created using dmextract . as the count rate is low ,",
    "the light curve was extracted at 5 ks resolution and gehrels errors are assumed @xcite .    from figure",
    "[ fig : lightcurve ] , we can see that the light curve exhibits clear variability ( a factor of @xmath50 ) and the x - ray emission appears to oscillate within the 160 ks exposure .",

    "[ fig : lightcurve ] , we plot the resulting light curve when folded on the detected period of @xmath53 = 33.5 ks ( 9.3 hrs ) .",
    "the amplitude of the sine model is @xmath54 counts sec@xmath21 , and thus is measured to @xmath55 .",
    "if instead the light curve is modeled as a constant , we obtain a best fit of @xmath56 .",
    "an f - test was used to determine that the sine model is a superior description of the data at the 99.9866% confidence level ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "this simple statistical test is dependent on the binning of the light curve , e.g. , a binning of 3/10 ks resolution favors a sine wave over a constant model at the 95.7%/99.3% level with @xmath58  ks respectively .",
    "however , the best fit period is robustly determined irrespective of the actual binning .",
    "the power - spectrum also hints at the presence of a periodic signal . utilizing the entire observation at the native temporal resolution ( @xmath59 t = 3.14104 s )",
    "reveals the presence of a low significance peak ( @xmath60 ) at a frequency @xmath61 ( @xmath62  ks ) on top of a white noise background .",
    "if the signal is in fact periodic , the detected peak in the power - spectrum is likely of low statistical significance due to the small number of cycles sampled in our 160 ks observation ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "however , we can not rule out the possibility that the seemingly periodic signal could be produced by stochastic variability , which can sometimes mimic intervals of periodicity ( e.g. ,  red noise , \" @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the oscillating signal is uniquely coincident with the nuclear source as identified in our sub - pixel spatial analysis .",
    "we have examined light curves from the bright region 2@xmath8 to the east and find no evidence for any significant periodic signal at this location only 3 acis - s pixels from the nucleus .",
    "likewise , analysis of the light curves of the remaining point sources on the acis - s3 detector reveals no evidence for periodicity .",
    "neither do we observe significant background flaring or the presence of periodic variability in the background signal on the acis - s3 detector during this observation .",
    "a period of @xmath0  33 ks should also not be due to aspect dithering .",

    "the x - ray spectrum is soft and can be well - fit by either a thermal plasma model with @xmath72 kev or a power - law model with @xmath47 , similar to sagittarius a@xmath2 at the center of the milky way @xcite and other massive bhs accreting at very low eddington ratios ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the presence of a spatially coincident non - thermal radio source , with a physical size of @xmath73 @xcite , also strongly suggests a massive bh .",
    "furthermore , the nuclear source in henize 2 - 10 falls along the correlation between nuclear radio and x - ray luminosity for low - luminosity radio galaxies ( within the @xmath74 scatter ) found by @xcite .",
    "our temporal analysis of the nuclear x - ray emission reveals clear variability and a potential @xmath75-hr periodicity .",
    "the oscillatory signal is apparent by eye and significant when fitting the light curve .",
    "however , the x - ray periodicity is not yet significant when considering the power spectrum , and at present we can not distinguish between a true periodic signal and random fluctuations in brightness mimicking a periodic signal during our 160  ks observation ( e.g. , red noise , see @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , we discuss possible origins for a @xmath75-hr x - ray periodicity below .",
    "the most likely origin is a low frequency quasi - periodic oscillation ( lfqpo ; @xcite ) .",
    "qpos are generally thought to arise from instabilities in the accretion flow ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or geometric oscillations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it has been proposed that lfqpos may be due to the orbital precession of non - equitorial particles in the dragged spacetime around a spinning bh ( i.e. , lense - thirring precession ; @xcite ) .",
    "given the timescale of the apparent periodicity and the low luminosity , current observational constraints on such variability are limited , with only a single claimed detection of a lfqpo from a massive bh that is accreting at a relatively high rate ( @xmath76 , * ? ? ?",
    "we also considered a high frequency qpo ( hfqpo ) as an origin for the x - ray periodicity , however the observed luminosity and frequency argue against this .",
    "the known stellar and massive bh qpo detections that are consistent with a hfqpo origin are all from sources known to be accreting at close to the eddington limit ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "hfqpos are thought to originate in the inner regions of the accretion flow in the immediate vicinity of the bh .",
    "the observed relation between qpo frequency and bh mass ( e.g. , @xcite ) would predict a mass of @xmath77 for a frequency of @xmath78  hz , more than an order of magnitude greater than the expected mass of the bh in henize 2 - 10 .",
    "a final intriguing possibility is orbital variability related to a massive bh binary , where at least one of the bhs is actively accreting , albeit at a low level @xcite . in this case",
    "the periodicity would correspond to the serendipitous electromagnetic discovery of a massive bh binary with @xmath79 years until merger , for an assumed total system mass of @xmath80 @xcite .",
    "although there is evidence that henize 2 - 10 has experienced a merger in the recent past @xcite , and thus the presence of two massive bhs is possible , we regard this possibility as unlikely given the extremely short timescale until coalescence implied by the observed frequency .",
    "while we consider a weakly accreting massive bh the most likely origin for the nuclear x - ray / radio source in henize 2 - 10 , we nonetheless revisit alternative explanations including a stellar - mass xrb and/or a young supernova remnant ( snr ; also see the supplementary information in @xcite as well as the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "neither an xrb nor a snr alone can account for _ both _ the x - ray and radio properties of the nuclear source .",
    "the radio emission is simply too luminous to be produced by an xrb , especially one in the soft thermal state @xcite as would be indicated by the observed spectrum , and the x - ray variability is incompatible with a snr .",
    "our constraints on the positions of the nuclear radio and x - ray sources , however , strongly suggest a common / related source . in principle",
    ", we can imagine a scenario in which the x - rays originate from an accreting stellar - mass xrb residing within the radio - emitting remnant of the supernova that created the compact object . given the size and luminosity of the radio source",
    ", a snr would likely be only decades old @xcite and therefore the nuclear x - ray source would be the new record - holder for the youngest xrb known by a wide margin ( e.g. , circinus x-1 has an age @xmath81 yr ; * ? ? ?",
    "while we can not definitively rule out this scenario , we consider it somewhat contrived .",
    "moreover , the radio / x - ray source is at the center of the galaxy ( the natural place for a massive bh ) and there is no star cluster or recent star formation at the location of the source as would be expected for a young xrb / snr origin @xcite .",
    "finally , our study demonstrates the value of x - ray imaging at sub - arcsecond scales and emphasizes the need for a high - resolution next generation x - ray observatory .",
    "our detection of the first potential lfqpo from a low - luminosity massive bh would not have been possible with any existing x - ray observatory other than _ chandra_. future studies of this class of objects ( e.g. , with _",
    "athena _ and the x - ray surveyor ) would open a new window to study low luminosity accretion flows , which are the dominant mode of bh accretion on cosmological scales .",
