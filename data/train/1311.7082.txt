    "in fact , hakimi proved a slightly stronger result that determines all possible out - degree sequences produced by orientations of a given graph @xmath0 .",
    "his proof uses induction on the number of edges , but the weaker statement given above is a straightforward consequence of hall s marriage theorem .",
    "what about hypergraphs ?",
    "suppose an @xmath1-uniform hypergraph @xmath0 ( i.e. a family of @xmath1-sets ) is given an _ orientation _ , by which we mean that for each edge @xmath9 one ordering of the vertices of @xmath9 is chosen .",

    "when does an @xmath1-uniform hypergraph @xmath0 have an orientation such that @xmath20 for every vertex @xmath14 ? again , an obvious necessary condition is that @xmath5 for every subgraph @xmath6 ( where as usual @xmath7 is a subgraph of @xmath0 if @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) .",

    "now , in contrast to the situation for graphs , for oriented hypergraphs there is a sensible notion of degree for sets of _ multiple _ vertices .",
    "for example , given an orientation @xmath12 and a pair of vertices @xmath23 , we can define @xmath24 to be the number of edges @xmath9 such that @xmath25 and @xmath14 ( in some order ) are in the first two positions of @xmath13 .",
    "so if the oriented edges are @xmath26 ( where the vertex set is @xmath27 $ ] ) then @xmath28 .    more generally , for a @xmath2-set of vertices @xmath29 and a @xmath2-set @xmath30 $ ] , the _ @xmath31-degree _ of @xmath32 , denoted by @xmath33 , is the number of edges @xmath9 such that the elements of @xmath13 in positions labeled by @xmath31 are @xmath34 ( in some order ) .",

    "we mainly consider the former notion ( of ` unordered ' degrees ) , but a brief analysis of the latter is given in section [ sec : ordereddegrees ] . ]    in @xcite caro and hansberg asked if a result similar to their theorem [ thm : hakforhyp ] can be found in the setting of degrees for multiple vertices .",
