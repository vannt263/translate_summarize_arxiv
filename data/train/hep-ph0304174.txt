    "the statistical description of proton - proton and heavy - ion reactions has already a long tradition .",
    "it was hagedorn @xcite , who showed in a sequence of papers that many aspects of these reactions are close to that one expects assuming that the transition matrix element is constant and therefore the distribution of final state particles is completely determined by phase space .",
    "more recently the statistical interpretation of nuclear reactions regained interest , after it had been demonstrated that in heavy ion reactions at cern ",
    "sps amd rhic energies the multiplicities of a multitude of non strange hadrons is in remarkable agreement with the assumption that all particles are created in thermal equilibrium at a temperature which is close to that expected from lattice calculations for the transition of a hadron gaz towards a quark - gluon plasma [ 3 - 5 ] .",
    "also strange hadrons fit into this picture if one includes a penalty factor for each strange quark which is contained in a hadron .",
    "later this approach has been successfully extended towards ags and sis energies @xcite , as well as towards pp and @xmath2 reactions @xcite . whereas the former are large systems with a large reaction volume , the latter ones yield only a small hadron multiplicity and require volumes of the order of 25 @xmath6 . for such small systems",
    ", it is not evident that a canonical or a grand canonical description is justified .",
    "therefore it is worthwhile to check whether for these small volumes and particle multiplicities a microcanonical description still coincides with the canonical one .",
    "it is the purpose of this article to investigate this question employing for the first time a numerical realization of the algorithm to calculate the microcanonical phase space which has been presented by us in ref .",
    "for the present investigation , we limit the number of hadrons to 54 , which include pseudoscalar and vector mesons ( octet and singlet ) as well as the octet and decouplet of baryons and antibaryons .",
    "strange particles are produced according to phase space , i.e. without applying any suppression factor .",
    "the results are compared to that of two canonical calculations using the approach of becattini et al .",
    "@xcite , but without strangeness suppression : in the first calculation the number of hadrons which can be produced is limited to the same 54 species allowed in our microcanonical treatment , in the second calculation the standard set of hadrons @xcite is included . in principle",
    "we can include more hadrons in the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "this makes a detailed comparison more difficult , because the less known decay channels of the additional hadrons have to agree .",
    "following the general philosophy of statistical approaches to hadron production , we suppose that the result of a high energy collision can be considered as a distribution of `` clusters '' , `` droplets '' , or `` fireballs '' , which move relative to each other . here , we are only interested in @xmath7 particle yields and average transverse momenta , and therefore collective longitudinal motion needs not to be considered , and the distribution of clusters may be identified with one single `` equivalent cluster '' , being characterized by its volume @xmath8 ( the sum of individual proper volumes ) , its energy @xmath9 ( the sum of all the cluster masses ) , and the net flavor content @xmath10 .",
    "the basic assumption is that a cluster , characterized by @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath11 , decays `` statistically '' according to phase space .",
    "more precisely , the probability of a cluster to hadronize into a configuration @xmath12 of hadrons @xmath13 is given by the microcanonical partition function @xmath14 of an ideal , relativistic gas of the @xmath15 hadrons @xmath13 @xcite,@xmath16 with @xmath17 being the energy , and @xmath18 the 3-momentum of particle @xmath19 .",
    "the term @xmath20 ensures flavour conservation ; @xmath21 is the flavour vector of hadron @xmath19 .",
    "the symbol @xmath22 represents the set of hadron species considered : we take @xmath22 to contain the pseudoscalar and vector mesons @xmath23 and the lowest spin-@xmath24 and spin-@xmath25 baryons @xmath26 and the corresponding antibaryons .",
    "@xmath27 is the number of hadrons of species @xmath28 , and @xmath29 is the degeneracy of particle @xmath19 .",
    "we are going to employ monte carlo techniques , so we have to generate randomly configurations @xmath30 according to the probability distribution @xmath14 .",
    "we need a method in particular for intermediate size droplets , covering droplet masses from few gev up to 100 or 1000 gev .",
    "so the method should work for particle numbers @xmath31 between 2 and @xmath32 , which means , we have to deal with a huge configuration space .",
    "such problems are well known in statistical physics , and the method at hand is to construct a markov process .",
    "so for a given cluster with mass @xmath9 , volume @xmath8 , and flavor @xmath11 , we start from some arbitrary initial configuration @xmath33 , and generate a sequence @xmath34 , with @xmath35 being sufficiently large to have reached equilibrium ( which is defined to be the steady state of the markov process ) .",
    "if we repeat this procedure many times , getting configurations @xmath36 these configurations are distributed as @xmath14 .",
    "we need a transition probability @xmath37 such that it leads to an equilibrium distribution @xmath14 , with the initial transient @xmath35 being as small as possible .",
    "such an algorithm has been realized for the first time in @xcite .",
    "the problem is solved in several steps .",
    "one first writes the phase space integral as @xmath38 with @xmath39 , and with the `` random walk function '' @xmath40 given as @xmath41 with @xmath42 .",
    "the name `` random walk function '' is due to the fact that @xmath40 represents the probability to return back to the origin after @xmath15 `` random walks '' @xmath43 with given step sizes @xmath44 . in @xcite ,",
    "many details can be found about an efficient calculation of @xmath40 for any @xmath15 ( big or small ) .",
    "the next step amounts to getting rid of the energy delta function .",
    "a variable transformation gives    @xmath45    with @xmath46 the symbol @xmath47 denotes the total kinetic energy @xmath48 , and the absolute values of the momenta are expressed in terms of the @xmath49 as @xmath50{r_{i}},\\ , \\ , x_{n}=1.\\label{49}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in principle one may use monte carlo techniques to calculate the integral , but this is very time consuming . a more elegant method amounts to generalizing the hadronic final state by considering not only hadron species , but also their momenta .",
    "so we use the generalized configurations @xmath51 where the @xmath49 are related to the momenta @xmath44 via eq .",
    "( [ 49 ] ) .",
    "the weight of such a configuration is @xmath52 this expression is well suited to generate configurations @xmath53 according to @xmath54 , by constructing markov chains , for details see @xcite .",
    "flavor conservation is trivial to take into account , by considering only propositions in the markov chain construction which conserve the total flavor @xmath55    our algorithm provides a fast method to generate hadron configurations , characterized by the number of hadrons , their type , and their momenta . in this sense",
    "we have a real `` event generator '' of statistically generated hadrons .",
    "in order to see best how the results of a microcanonical calculation approach those of a canonical one , we investigate the average particle density @xmath56 , where @xmath27 is the average particle multiplicity @xmath27 of hadron species @xmath28 , and @xmath8 is the volume . in the microcanoncial approach ,",
    "the average particle density is in general a function of the two variables @xmath9 and @xmath8 . for large volumes , however , @xmath57 should only depend on the ratio @xmath58 , and this represents the limit where microcanonical and canonical description should coincide .",
    "we therefore calculate the density @xmath59 as a function of the energy density @xmath60 , for different volumes .",
    "we expect these curves to converge for large volumes",
    ".    figs .",
    "1 - 3 show the average particle density @xmath59 as a function of the energy density @xmath60 for three different volumes v= 12.5 ( line ) , 25 ( dashed line ) and 50 ( dotted ) @xmath6 the baryon density is fixed at 0.08 @xmath61 and the total charge is 2 for reasons which will be explained later .",
    "the particle densities for v = 12.5 @xmath6 and v = 25 @xmath6 differ at low energy densities for heavy mesons as well as for many of the baryons .",
    "the deviation increases - as expected - either with increasing particle mass or with increasing strange quark content , because the strange quarks have to be compensated by other particles in order to obtain the quantum numbers of the two incoming protons .",
    "we see as well that all mesons and almost all of the baryons have already arrived at the canonical limit for a volume as small as v= 25 @xmath6 .",
    "the only exceptions are the heavy triple strange barons @xmath62 and @xmath63 at low energy densities , where the total energy of the disintegrating system is ( at v= 25@xmath6 ) only a couple of times larger than the mass of the @xmath62 , @xmath63 pair .    from this observation",
    "we can conclude that the canonical limit is obtained if the total energy of the system is about 10 times the energy of the sum of the particles under consideration and of that particles necessary to compensate the deviation of the quantum numbers of the considered particle from that of the total cluster .    with the exception of the proton the density of all particles increases with increasing energy density .",
    "for the proton this is not the case because at very low energy densities the baryon can not get rid of its charge , whereas at higher energies a produced meson can carry this charge leaving behind a neutral baryon .    in figs . 1 - 3 we have marked as a dot the results of a canonical calculation with the parameters fitted to describe the particle yields observed in pp collisions at 27.4 gev @xcite .",
    "the parameters used in this calculations are @xmath64 @xmath6 and @xmath65 @xmath66 . in contradistinction to the calculation with these parameters which is presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , here the strange particles are not suppressed by a @xmath67 factor and only the 54 hadron species mentioned above are produced .",
    "therefore this canonical calculation can directly be compared with our microcanonical approach .",
    "the average energy of the clusters obtained in this calculation is 8.74 gev , resulting in an average energy density of @xmath68 @xmath69 .",
    "we observe that for all light hadrons the agreement is very nice , verifying that indeed at a volume of @xmath70 the multiplicity has arrived at its canonical limit .",
    "for the heavy particles , such as @xmath62 and @xmath63 , volumes above @xmath0 are needed .",
    "another interesting question is how the observed particle yield is influenced by feeding .",
    "it is addressed in figs .",
    "4 - 6 which show for the 54 hadrons two densities : that of those particles which are produced directly and that present after electromagnetic and strong decays",
    ". both microcanonical calculations are compared with the corresponding canonical results .",
    "we see that feeding is unimportant for the vector mesons , whereas for the pseudoscalar mesons feeding increases the yield by more than a factor of 2 for the @xmath71 s and by more than 50% for the k s . with the exceptions of protons , neutrons and",
    "@xmath72 s feeding is much less important in the baryonic sector .",
    "the strange ( anti)baryons in the electromagnetic decay chain of @xmath62 and @xmath63 show some feeding whereas for @xmath73 s , @xmath62 s , @xmath74 s and @xmath75 s feeding is absent .",
    "we display in figs .",
    "3 - 6 as well the results of the canonical calculation with the same parameters in which the standard set of hadrons is included . for the heavy hadrons",
    "both canonical results differ little , whereas the standard set yields more pions and kaons , the decay products of the hadrons not included in 54 particle set . for the pions both",
    "canonical results differ by less than 50\\% for all the other hadrons the differences are much less important .      in fig .  7",
    ",    we plot the average transverse momentum @xmath76 as a function of the hadron mass @xmath77 .",
    "we compare our microcanonical results ( points ) with an energy density of @xmath78 to the canonical result , using    @xmath79 @xcite , with a temperature of t = 162 mev ( solid lines ) .",
    "the @xmath76values obtained in the canonical calculation of becattini agree with that analytical formula .    on the left hand side",
    ", we display @xmath76 of hadrons before decay as a function of their mass , for a volume of @xmath70 , and a total baryon number @xmath80 ( stars ) and @xmath81 ( squares ) . whereas the @xmath76 of @xmath71 s and k s are close to the value one expects for an equivalent canonical system , for the heavier particles the deviation from the canonical value increases with increasing mass .",
    "the reason is easy to understand : if such a heavy particle is produced , the available energy is not sufficient to fill phase space up to the high momenta .",
    "we see as well that the @xmath76 of the @xmath62 is 1.5 time the value of a @xmath71 .",
    "please note that relativity moderates the increase . in a nonrelativistic calculations we expect that @xmath76 increases as @xmath82 .",
    "we display on the left hand side as well the average transverse momenta after the strong electromagnetic interaction decay for the case of @xmath81 ( cycles ) .",
    "the decay modifies considerably the @xmath76of the light mesons and baryons .    on the right hand side",
    ", we study the critical volume for a droplet with total baryon number 0 ( in order to keep the baryon density constant when changing the volume ) .",
    "we see that with increasing volume the @xmath76 of the heavy baryons approaches only very slowly the canonical value .",
    "however , even at volumes of 100@xmath83 the asymptotic value is not reached .",
    "thus kinematical observables are much more suited to observe the deviations between canonical and microcanonical systems .",
    "we have presented the first numerical calculations of the multiplicity distribution of hadrons assuming that they are distributed according to microcanonical phase space . in this study",
    "we have limited ourselves to a set of 54 hadrons .",
    "the results have been compared with the results of a canonical system which has the same size and the same average energy , and agreement has been found .",
    "we observe that for the multiplicity the canonical limit is obtained , if the energy of the system is around ten times the mass of the observed particle plus that of those particles which are necessary to compensate its deviation from the quantum numbers of the cluster .",
    "these results raise doubts whether heavy hadrons in small systems like pp , kp and @xmath2 can be described in a canonical approach but shows as well that for a heavy collision a canonical treatment is valid . both",
    ", canonical and microcanonical calculations , show that feeding is very important for the pseudoscalar mesons as well as for p , n and @xmath72 but that is of minor or no importance for the other particles .",
    "we observe , as predicted analytically , an increase of the average transverse momentum @xmath76 with the mass of the hadron .",
    "however , we also find that a very big volume is required to obtain the value of the equivalent canonical system .",
