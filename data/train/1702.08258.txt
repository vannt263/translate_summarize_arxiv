    "o accommodate the exponential growth of data traffic over the last few years , space - division multiplexing ( sdm ) based on multi - core optical fiber or multi - mode optical fiber @xcite is expected to overcome the barrier from capacity limit of single - core fiber @xcite .",
    "the main challenge in sdm occurs due to in - band crosstalk between multiple parallel transmission channels ( cores or modes ) .",
    "this non - negligible crosstalk can be dealt with by using multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) signal processing techniques . assuming important crosstalk between channels ( cores or modes ) , negligible backscattering and near - lossless propagation , we can model the transmission channel as a random complex unitary matrix @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", authors introduced the jacobi unitary ensemble to model the propagation channel for fiber - optical mimo channel and they gave analytical expression for the ergodic capacity .",
    "however , to the best of the authors knowledge , no bounds for the ergodic capacity of the uncorrelated mimo jacobi - fading channels exist in the literature so far .",
    "the two main contributions of this work are : ( * i * ) the derivation of a lower / upper bounds on the ergodic capacity of an uncorrelated mimo jacobi - fading channel with identically and independently distributed input symbols , ( * ii * ) the derivation of simple asymptotic expressions for ergodic capacity in the low and high snr regimes .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : section [ sec.:problemformulation ] introduces the mimo jacobi - fading channel model and includes the definition of ergodic capacity .",
    "we derive a lower and upper bound , at any snr value , and an approximation , in high and low snr regimes , to the ergodic capacity in section [ sec.:tightbounds ] .",
    "the theoretical and the simulation results are discussed in section [ sec.:simuresults ] . finally , section [ sec.:conclusion ] provides the conclusion .",
    "consider a single segment @xmath0-channel lossless optical fiber system , the propagation through the fiber may be analyzed through its @xmath1 scattering matrix given by @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 sub - matrices correspond to the transmitted from left to right and from right to left signals , respectively .",
    "the @xmath5 and @xmath6 sub - matrices present the reflected signals from left to left and from right to right .",

    "each of these @xmath0 transmission eigenvalues is a real number between 0 and 1 . without loss of generality",
    ", the transmission matrix @xmath19 will be modeled as a haar - distributed unitary random matrix of dimension @xmath20 @xcite .    in this paper , we consider that there are @xmath21 excited transmitting channels and @xmath22 receiving channels coherently excited in the input and output side of the @xmath0-channel lossless optical fiber .",
    "therefore , we only consider a truncated version of the transmission matrix @xmath19 , which we denote by @xmath23 , since not all transmitting or receiving channels may be available to a given link . without loss of generality , the effective transmission channel matrix @xmath23 is the @xmath24 upper - left corner of the transmission matrix @xmath19 @xcite . as a result ,",
