    "<S> * the ability to manipulate phonon waveforms in continuous media has attracted significant research interest and is crucial for practical applications ranging from biological imaging to material characterization . although several spatial focusing techniques have been developed , these systems require sophisticated artificial structures , which limit their practical applications . this is because the spatial control of acoustic phonon waves is not as straightforward as photonics so there is a strong demand for an alternative approach . </S>",
    "<S> here we demonstrate a phononic time lens in a dispersive one - dimensional phononic crystal waveguide , which enables the temporal control of phonon wave propagation . </S>",
    "<S> pulse focusing is realized at a desired time and position with chirped input pulses that agree perfectly with the theoretical prediction . </S>",
    "<S> this technique can be applied to arbitrary systems and will offer both an improvement in time and spatial sensing resolution and allow the creation of a highly intense strain field , enabling the investigation of novel nonlinear phononic phenomena such as phononic solitons and rogue waves . </S>",

    "<S> a time lens , which is a temporal analogue to a spatial lens , has been introduced in the field of optics @xcite . according to space - time duality , which describes the mathematical equivalence between paraxial - beam diffraction and dispersive pulse broadening , </S>",

    "<S> importantly , this temporal focusing method can be applied in an arbitrary dispersive material in which it imparts quadratic time - varying phase shift . on the basis of this concept , </S>",
    "<S> various useful ideas have been developed including temporal imaging , temporal magnification and real - time spectroscopy in optics @xcite . by introducing the approach in the field of phononics , </S>",
    "<S> we have realized a phononic time lens in a one - dimensional ( 1d ) phononic crystal waveguide ( pnc wg)@xcite which is constructed by nanoelectromechanical systems ( nems ) technology . </S>",
    "<S> ultrasound phonon waves travelling through the wg experience pulse broadening due to the group velocity dispersion ( gvd ) effect . </S>",
    "<S> this gvd effect can be used to compensate for the frequency modulation of the initial pulse that leads to temporal focusing . by further incorporating excellent mechanical properties of nems such as high - quality factors , integrability and nonlinearity into this device@xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the ability to temporally focus the travelling phonons will open up the possibility of developing an ultrashort and highly intense phonon pulse generator , which will be useful for practical applications as in the case of optical laser systems@xcite , and investigaing nonlinear phononic phenomena .    </S>",

    "<S> the phonon vibrations are observed in 3.5 - 7.5 mhz owing to the presence of 1st phonon band , where the phonon vibrations propagate in the wg and are reflected at both clamping edges thus resulting in the generation of equidistant fabry - perot peaks in the spectral response . on the other hand , phonon waves around 8 mhz experience bragg reflection from the periodic air holes , giving rise to a phonon bandgap , and </S>",
    "<S> this prevents them from propagating in the wg@xcite . above the bandgap </S>",
    "<S> , there is a new phonon branch that again allows the phonon vibrations to be guided . in the experiments described below , we focus on the 1st phonon branch to investigate the temporal dynamics of the phonon vibrations in the device .    </S>",
    "<S> a transverse deflection @xmath3 travelling in a 1d pnc wg can be described by euler - bernoulli equations as@xcite , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the young s modulus , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the area and moment of inertia of the cross section , @xmath8 is the density of the wg per unit length and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the elastic coefficients of the wg . to solve equation ( [ eq : w ] ) </S>",
    "<S> , the slowly varying amplitude of travelling wave is assumed that the envelope of a travelling vibration pulse centred around wavenumber @xmath11 and angular frequency @xmath12 varies slowly in temporal and spatial domain on the moving - frame with group velocity , @xmath13 . </S>",

    "<S> these terms are determined by the material and geometric parameters of the wg in equation ( [ eq : w ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the dynamics of phonon propagation based on the euler - bernoulli equation corresponds to a nonlinear schr@xmath20dinger equation ( nlse ) , which is used to describe the dynamics of an optical wave propagating in a dispersive medium@xcite . by neglecting the nonlinear term in equation ( [ eq : aa ] ) and using the new time coordinate @xmath21 moving with the group velocity @xmath22 , @xmath23 </S>",
    "<S> at the same time we introduce a normalized amplitude @xmath24 , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the peak amplitude of the input pulse , and the equation can be simplified as @xmath27 interestingly , equation ( [ eq : u ] ) is mathematically equal to the paraxial wave equation that governs the diffraction of cw light . </S>",
    "<S> if we assume a gaussian pulse as an input , the normalized amplitude at distance @xmath28 is given by@xcite , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the half - width at the 1/@xmath31-intensity point , and its output width @xmath32 is written as @xmath33 thus a phonon temporal waveform travelling down a dispersive medium depends on the absolute value of the gvd coefficient that enables the temporal pulse width to be broadened further due to the larger dispersion .    to elucidate the temporal characteristics of this device experimentally , </S>",
    "<S> phonon vibrations are measured at the left edge by exciting them with a gaussian pulse with @xmath34s from the right edge as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) . </S>",

    "<S> 2(b ) and 2(c ) respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental @xmath35 value increases with increasing frequency i.e. anomalous dispersion ( @xmath37 ) in the band except near the bandgap where there is a large reduction in @xmath35 , i.e. normal dispersion ( @xmath38 ) , because of the decreased slope of the band . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the temporal waveform of the pulse around the band edges is distorted and becomes asymmetric with an oscillation near the trailing edge caused by a contribution from the 3rd order dispersion effect ( see supplementary information for more detail ) . </S>",
    "<S> these experimental results can be well reproduced by the calculation results obtained with fem - simulated band structures .    </S>",
    "<S> the temporal pulse widths can also be estimated from the time - of - flight measurement in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) by fitting a gaussian envelope to the output waveforms . </S>",
    "<S> figures 3(b ) and 3(c ) reveal the output pulse widths at various excitation frequencies when exciting gaussian pulses with @xmath39 and 0.7 @xmath0s respectively and measuring them at distances @xmath40 1 , 3 and 5 mm ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(a ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> as theoretically predicted , the pulse widths are greatly increased as the frequency approaches the band edges where @xmath41 is large and the gvd - induced pulse broadening becomes distinct with increasing propagation distance as shown in figs . </S>",
    "<S> 3(b)and 3(c)@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , shortening the input pulse from @xmath42 @xmath0s to 0.7 @xmath0s , namely spectrally broadening , leads to the significant influence of the propagation distance on the output width as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(c ) .    in the previous experiment we confirmed that the pulse is broadened during propagation thanks to the gvd effect . in an anomalous ( normal ) dispersion regime , </S>",
    "<S> the high - frequency components of the pulse travel faster ( slower ) than its low - frequency components , thus allowing the injected un - chirped pulse to be frequency chirped and broadened , where the product of the temporal and spectral widths is not transform limited . in general </S>",
    "<S> , this effect is unfavorable for efficient phonon guiding . </S>",
    "<S> however , we utilize the disadvantage to demonstrate temporal focusing , namely the compression and amplification , of the travelling phonon pulse . here </S>",
    "<S> , a frequency - chirped pulse is excited as the input , and frequency modulation within the pulse is compensated for by the gvd via propagation , thus resulting in the pulse being compressed to the lower limit for the pulse width determined by a given spectrum , namely transform limited , and the peak amplitude being amplified . </S>",
    "<S> thus this temporal analogue of a spatial lens , called a time lens , enables the temporal focusing of a phonon wave@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of the chirped pulse evolution in the wg can also be described by nlse , and the output pulse width @xmath43 is given by @xmath44 @xmath45 is a chirp parameter that is positive ( negative ) when the frequency increases ( decreases ) linearly from the leading to the trailing edge , and is defined by @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the spectral half - width at the 1/@xmath31-intensity point . </S>",
    "<S> equation ( [ eq : t ] ) indicates that pulse focusing occurs only when @xmath48 , where an up - chirped @xmath49 ( down - chirped @xmath50 ) pulse is used as an input in an anomalous ( normal ) dispersion regime @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) .    as an experimental demonstration in this device </S>",
    "<S> , an up - chirped pulse is injected in the anomalous dispersion regime between 3.5 - 7 mhz as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the output pulse width is measured at various distances by exciting different chirped pulses with a centre frequency of 5.8 mhz as shown in figs . </S>",
    "<S> 4(b)-(d ) . </S>",
    "<S> the pulse widths with negative @xmath45 monotonically increase with increasing distance ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(b ) and the upper panel of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(c ) ) , whereas the widths with a positive @xmath45 first decrease to the transform limited value , and in turn , increase with distance ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(b ) and the lower panel of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(c ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> it should be also noted that a smaller pulse width is observed when we employ a larger absolute value of positive @xmath45 and indeed , strong focusing is realized when @xmath53 where the pulse width is compressed from 2 @xmath0s to 0.5 @xmath0s and the strain energy is enhanced more than one order of magnitude . making use of the gvd effect enables a travelling pulse waveform to be engineered that leads to the temporal focusing of phonons .    in a conventional spatial lens , </S>",
    "<S> the figures of merit such as the compression and amplification factors , and the ability to spatially adjust the focusing position , are mainly determined by the geometric parameters of the system . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , these techniques require sophisticated artificial structures if they are to control waves . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast this time lens enables them to be dynamically designed by simply changing the excitation frequency , input pulse width and chirp parameters . </S>",
    "<S> although , in this study , these focusing properties are limited by the device structure causing the reflection at both wg edges , and the finite bandwidth of the lock - in amplifier , it is possible to further enhance this focusing effect by modifying the device structure and optimizing the measurement set - up .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have demonstrated a phononic time lens in a 1d pnc wg . </S>",
    "<S> the dispersion effect determined by the periodic geometry of the device induces frequency chirp in the gaussian input pulse during propagation . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon also allows the travelling wave to be temporally focused , and this can be controlled by changing the input chirp parameters . </S>",
