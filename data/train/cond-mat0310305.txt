    "recently , various authors have discussed the application of the continuous - time random walk ( ctrw ) @xcite to finance ( see sec . 2 for details ) .",
    "the basic point is that , in financial markets , not only returns , but also waiting times between two consecutive trades can be considered as random variables . to our knowledge , the application of ctrw to economics dates back , at least , to the 1980s . in 1984 ,",
    "rudolf hilfer published a book on the application of stochastic processes to operational planning , where ctrws were used for sale forecasts @xcite .",
    "the ( revisited ) ctrw formalism has been applied to the high - frequency price dynamics in financial markets by our research group since 2000 , in a series of three papers @xcite .",
    "other scholars have recently used this formalism @xcite .",
    "however , ctrws have a famous precursor . in 1903 ,",
    "the phd thesis of filip lundberg presented a model for ruin theory of insurance companies , which was further developed by cramr @xcite .",
    "the underlying stochastic process of the lundberg - cramr model is a particular example of ctrw .    among other issues",
    ", we have studied the independence between log - returns and waiting times for the 30 dow - jones - industrial - average ( djia ) stocks traded at the new york stock exchange in october 1999 .",
    "for instance , according to a contingency - table analysis performed on general electric ( ge ) prices , the null hypothesis of independence can be rejected with a significance level of 1 % @xcite . in this letter , however , the focus is on the empirical distribution of waiting times .",
    "> from our study , it turns out that the marginal density for waiting times is definitely not an exponential function .",
    "after the publication of our paper series , different waiting - time scales have been investigated in different markets by various authors .",
    "all these empirical analyses corroborate the waiting - time anomalous behaviour . a study on the waiting times in a contemporary forex exchange and in the xixth century",
    "irish stock market was presented by sabatelli _",
    "they were able to fit the irish data by means of a mittag - leffler function as we did before in a paper on the waiting - time marginal distribution in the german - bund future market @xcite .",
    "kyungsik kim and seong - min yoon studied the tick dynamical behavior of the bond futures in korean futures exchange(kofex ) market and found that the survival probability displays a stretched - exponential form @xcite .",
    "moreover , just to stress the relevance of non - exponential waiting times , ! a power - law distribution has been recently detected by t. kaizoji and m. kaizoji in analyzing the calm time interval of price changes in the japanese market @xcite .",
    "the importance of random walks in finance has been known since the seminal thesis of bachelier @xcite which was completed at the end of the xixth century , more than a hundred years ago .",
    "the ideas of bachelier were further carried out by many scholars @xcite .",
    "the price dynamics in financial markets can be mapped onto a random walk whose properties are studied in continuous , rather than discrete , time @xcite . here , we shall present this mapping , pioneered by bachelier @xcite , in a rather general way .",
    "it is worth mentioning that this approach is related to those of clark @xcite and to the introductory notes in parkinson s paper @xcite . as a further comment ,",
    "this is a purely phenomenological approach .",
    "no specific assumption on the rationality or the behaviour of market agents is taken or even necessary .",
    "in particular , it is not necessary to assume the validity of the efficient market hypothesis @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , as shown below , a phenomenological model can be useful in order to empirically corroborate or falsify the consequences of behavioural or other assumptions on markets . in its turn ,",
    "the model itself can be corroborated or falsified by empirical data .    as a matter of fact , there are various ways in which random walk can be embedded in continuous time .",
    "here , we shall base our approach on the so - called continuous - time random walk in which time intervals between successive steps are random variables , as discussed by montroll and weiss @xcite .",
    "let @xmath0 denote the price of an asset or the value of an index at time @xmath1 . in a real market ,",
    "prices are fixed when demand and offer meet and a transaction occurs . in this case , we say that a trade takes place .",
    "returns rather than prices are more convenient .",
    "for this reason , we shall take into account the variable @xmath2 , that is the logarithm of the price .",
    "indeed , for a small price variation @xmath3 , the return @xmath4 and the logarithmic return @xmath5 $ ] virtually coincide .",
    "as we mentioned before , in financial markets , not only prices can be modelled as random variables , but also waiting times between two consecutive transactions vary in a stochastic fashion . therefore ,",
    "the time series @xmath6 is characterised by @xmath7 , the _ joint probability density _ of log - returns @xmath8 and of waiting times @xmath9 .",
    "the joint density satisfies the normalization condition @xmath10 .",
    "montroll and weiss @xcite have shown that the fourier - laplace transform of @xmath11 , the probability density function , _ pdf _ , of finding the value @xmath12 of the price logarithm ( which is the diffusing quantity in our case ) at time @xmath1 , is given by : @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the waiting time pdf .",
    "the space - time version of eq .",
    "( [ montroll ] ) can be derived by probabilistic considerations @xcite .",
    "the following integral equation gives the probability density , @xmath11 , for the walker being in position @xmath12 at time @xmath1 , conditioned by the fact that it was in position @xmath16 at time @xmath17 : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the so - called survival function .",
    "@xmath19 is related to the marginal waiting - time probability density @xmath20 .",
    "the survival function @xmath19 is : @xmath21    the ctrw model can be useful in applications such as speculative option pricing by monte carlo simulations or portfolio selection .",
    "this will be the subject of a forthcoming paper .",
    "in fig . 1 , the waiting - time complementary cumulative distribution function ( or survival function ) @xmath22 is plotted for three different periods of the day ( morning 9:00 - 10:59 ; midday 11:00 - 13:59 , afternoon 14:00 - 17:00 ) and for the ge time series of october 1999 . in the above formula",
    ", @xmath20 represents the marginal waiting - time probability density function .",
    "@xmath19 gives the probability that the waiting time between two consecutive trades is greater than the given @xmath23 .",
    "the lines are the corresponding standard exponential complementary cumulative distribution functions : @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the empirical average waiting time .",
    "an eye inspection already shows the deviation of the real distribution from the exponential distribution .",
    "this fact is corroborated by the anderson - darling test @xcite .",
    "the anderson - darling ( ad ) @xmath26 values for the three daily periods are , respectively , 352 , 285 , and 446 .",
    "therefore , the null hypothesis of exponential distribution can be rejected at the 5 % significance level .    in tab .",
    "1 , the values of the ad @xmath26 statistics are given for the 30 djia stocks traded in october 1999 .",
    "in all these cases the null hypothesis of exponentiality can be rejected at the 5 % significance level .",
    "why should we care about these empirical findings on the waiting - time distribution ? this has to do both with the market price formation mechanisms and with the bid - ask process . _ a priori _",
    ", one could argue that there is no strong reason for independent market investors to place buy and sell orders in a time - correlated way .",
    "this leads to a poisson process with exponential survival function for the bid - ask process .",
    "if price formation were a simple thinning of the bid - ask process , then exponential waiting times should be expected between consecutive trades as well @xcite .",
    "eventually , even if empirical analyses should show that time correlations are already present at the bid - ask level , it would be interesting to understand why they are there .",
    "in other words , the empirical results on the survival probability set limits on statistical market models for price formation .",
    "we would like to acknowledge useful discussions with sergio focardi of the intertek group . this work has partially been carried out in the frame of the intas project 00 - 0847 .",
