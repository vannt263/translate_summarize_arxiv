    "recent results from the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) demonstrate qualitatively new behavior for heavy - ion collisions at high energies .",
    "rhic appears to probe a regime where quarks and gluons are no longer bound into hadrons but form a new state of matter , a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "the experimental results suggest that the transition does not occur directly from a confined phase to an ideal qgp but that it goes through a phase where the deconfined phase is non - perturbative  @xcite .",
    "in fact , `` partial '' deconfinement is expected from the gross - witten matrix model for su(@xmath0 ) wilson lines at large @xmath0  @xcite and from quasi - particle approaches  @xcite .",
    "here , we investigate an effective theory of straight , thermal wilson lines  @xcite which respects the global z(n ) symmetry of yang - mills and might be able to describe the region below about @xmath1 , where resummed perturbation theory fails .",
    "we focus , in particular , on the distribution of the _ eigenvalues _ of the su(2 ) wilson line at , and slightly above , the deconfining phase transition .",
    "we consider an effective theory in three dimensions which uses the thermal wilson line @xmath2 as the fundamental degree of freedom in the electric sector . this is a matrix valued field which exists in three dimensional space .",
    "the effective lagrangian is composed of a kinetic term , the one - loop potential , and a non - perturbative term proportional to a `` fuzzy - bag '' constant @xmath3 : @xmath4 @xmath5 is the non - abelian magnetic field strength and @xmath6 the covariant derivative .",
    "this theory does not involve elements of the algebra , i.e.  @xmath7 , and respects the z(n ) center symmetry of the su(n ) gauge group .",
    "it is therefore able to generate fluctuations between different z(n ) vacua , just above the phase transition .",
    "the lagrangian is non - renormalizable in three dimensions and thus applies only at distances @xmath8 .",
    "we performed simulations of the effective theory for two colors , employing three - dimensional cubic lattices with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we use metropolis and overrelaxation techniques @xcite to update the lattice configurations and to generate a thermal ensemble .",
    "we currently neglect all but the @xmath9 term of the perturbative potential which can then be combined with the non - perturbative term .",
    "the lattice action then reads @xmath10 it contains the standard kinetic wilson action for the magnetic fields , where the sum runs over all `` plaquettes '' , gauge - covariant kinetic nearest neighbour interaction for the wilson lines and a mass term .",
    "the index @xmath11 labels lattice sites and @xmath12 labels links .",
    "initial results were obtained by neglecting the magnetic sector @xcite .",
    "the theory is then essentially reduced to a sigma model with global @xmath13 symmetry .",
    "when @xmath14 , a second order phase transition occurs at @xmath15 . here , the expectation value of the `` length '' of @xmath16 , @xmath17 , takes on a non - zero value  @xcite .",
    "the effective screening mass , which equals the inverse spatial correlation length , drops to zero here ( up to finite lattice size effects ) and remains zero above the phase transition point , due to massless goldstone modes .",
    "choosing a fixed value for @xmath18 and varying @xmath19 also gives a second order phase transition .",
    "here , the proper order parameter is the expectation value of the polyakov loop , which is the trace of the wilson line .",
    "larger @xmath18 shifts the phase transition point to smaller @xmath19 . to obtain non - zero vevs for the polyakov loop for negative @xmath19 , an infinitesimal background field must be added .",
    "these results suggest that the phase boundary of the theory runs diagonally in the @xmath18-@xmath19 plane  @xcite .",
    "we measured the average and the difference of eigenvalues of the wilson lines @xmath20 and determined their distribution in the thermal ensemble over a broad range of couplings .",
    "we find , that for @xmath14 and small @xmath18 , the distribution is dominated by the group integration measure which leads to a logarithmic divergence for @xmath21 . for large",
    "@xmath19 one approaches the perturbative vacuum , where the distribution of the average @xmath22 is peaked around 1 . in the confined phase at large @xmath18 the wilson lines fluctuate about the non - trivial vacuum @xmath23 , or su(2 ) rotations thereof",
    "( eigenvalues `` repel '' ) .",
    "fluctuations diminish with increasing @xmath18 .",
    "lattice for different values of @xmath19 and @xmath18 .",
    "magnetic fields are included .",
    "[ fig : histo_fig],title=\"fig : \" ]   lattice for different values of @xmath19 and @xmath18 .",
    "magnetic fields are included .",
    "[ fig : histo_fig],title=\"fig : \" ]   lattice for different values of @xmath19 and @xmath18 .",

    "magnetic fields are included .",
    "[ fig : histo_fig],title=\"fig : \" ]    adding gauge fields now leads to a few qualitative changes in the observables .",
    "foremost , it is no longer necessary to use the 0(4)-length as an order parameter , since the presence of gauge fields explicitly breaks the @xmath24 symmetry of the kinetic term .",
    "the polyakov loop is now a good order parameter , even for @xmath14 .",
    "all massless goldstone modes disappear as well , so that the inverse correlation length is only zero ( again up to finite size effects ) exactly at the phase transition point .",
    "qualitative differences in the distribution of eigenvalues arise from the fact that even at @xmath14 raising @xmath18 can now lead to eigenvalue attraction .",
    "the qualitative dependence on @xmath19 for fixed @xmath18 is similar to the spin - model case , although the transition from the perturbative vacuum to the confined vacuum is smoother across the point @xmath14 ( as one would expect , since this is reminiscent of the change of the behavior of the polyakov loop ) .",
    "overall , changes in the electric sector due to magnetic fields are qualitatively similar to the effect of the external field which was formerly used to find the phase boundary in the spin model at @xmath25 .    to assess the influence of the dynamics of the wilson lines on the magnetic fields we have also measured the expectation value of the wilson action itself and of the spatial string tension .",
    "this was done by obtaining expectation values of rectangular wilson loops @xmath26 , where i and j are the dimensions of the loop in lattice units .",
    "such loops obey the area law @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the area of the loop and the string tension @xmath29 plays the role of a decay constant .",
    "one normally uses creutz ratios  @xcite but our comparison of both methods suggests that in 3d , using the wilson loops directly works equally well .",
    "( left ) and as a function of @xmath19 for fixed @xmath30 ( right ) .",
    "the string tension appears to be independent of @xmath19 .",
    "[ fig : string_fig],title=\"fig : \" ]   ( left ) and as a function of @xmath19 for fixed @xmath30 ( right ) .",
    "the string tension appears to be independent of @xmath19 .",
    "[ fig : string_fig],title=\"fig : \" ]    we find that both the string tension and the wilson action drop approximately exponentially with @xmath18 but are independent of @xmath19 .",
    "both are also independent of the lattice size .",
    "the magnetic sector is largely unaffected by deconfinement in the electric sector .",
