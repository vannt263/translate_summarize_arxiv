    "quantum entanglement is the key element in many applications of quantum information processing ( qip ) ranging from quantum computation @xcite to communication @xcite .",
    "the studies of entanglement represent an active line of research in modern quantum physics which so far has found only partial answers . on the practical side , entanglement is the core of a new _ paradigm _ for quantum computation  @xcite and the catalyst for the performance of tasks which are impossible within the classical domain  @xcite .",
    "more recently , the relation between quantum entanglement and thermodynamical properties of macroscopic objects has become the center of an extensive study  @xcite .",
    "the existence of long - range quantum correlations between the parties of a complex many - body system is allegedly the reason for the peculiar behavior of macroscopic properties of solids  @xcite . in this context",
    ", it is intellectually stimulating and pragmatically very important to investigate and understand the existence of entanglement between macroscopic physical systems and the influences of temperature on it .",
    "theoretically , some steps in this direction have been performed with the study of radiation pressure - induced entanglement between a movable mirror and the electromagnetic field of a cavity  @xcite .",
    "very often , the quantitative analysis of even simplified models of interaction faces important practical difficulties related to the necessity of treating non - gaussian states of continuous - variable ( cv ) systems . for non - gaussian states ,",
    "there is a lack of objective criteria to determine whether or not entanglement is present . in these years , there have been a few proposals designed to bypass this problem , including @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , so far a totally satisfactory answer has not been provided .",
    "this serious limitation largely affects the extent to which an analysis of thermally entangled systems can be conducted . a way to bypass the problem",
    "is given by the formal restriction of the hilbert space of the composite cv system to an effective discrete one  @xcite , where necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of bipartite entanglement can be used  @xcite .",
    "however , even though this strategy is theoretically exploitable , its experimental realization is extremely hard .    in this paper , we investigate the entanglement properties of a class of states which have been very recently introduced by jeong and ralph  @xcite in order to provide a reasonable analogy of the schrdinger s cat paradox  @xcite .",
    "a class of entangled state in @xcite can be considered as a generalization of the two - mode schrdinger cat - like state @xcite , which corresponds to an entangled state between microscopic and macroscopic systems , to a thermal mixture .",
    "macroscopic _ part of this cat - like state is represented by the displaced thermal state of a harmonic oscillator while the microscopic part is an atomic ( or single photon ) qubit .",
    "the other type of entangled state studied in  @xcite corresponds to an entangled state between two macroscopic systems and can be generated _ through an additional conditional measurement_. such a state can be understood as a generalization of an entangled coherent state @xcite , which has been found useful for qip @xcite , to a thermal mixture . for the second type of the macroscopic entangled state , it was found that bell s inequality can be violated up to the maximum bound even though the thermal temperature becomes extremely large  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the existence and degree of entanglement in the first type of the microscopic - macroscopic entangled state , which we shall call  generalized cat - like state \" , remains a question to be answered .",
    "in other words , the first question that should be answered in this paper is `` how much entanglement can be generated by an interaction between microscopic quantum state ( qubit ) and macroscopic classical system ( thermal state ) without any additional process when the thermal temperature becomes extremely large ? ''",
    "however , unfortunately , the states which we are interested in are non - gaussian mixed cv states for which the known entanglement criterions for cv states  @xcite fail , leaving a degree of ambiguity which prevents any firm statement on the presence of quantum correlations . to bypass this problem , we describe an alternative theoretical method which is then corroborated by testing the _ entangling power _ of the generalized cat - like state  @xcite . the test is based on the capability of a state to induce entanglement , by means of only bilocal interactions , between two initially uncorrelated qubits . as local unitary operations alone can not create entanglement , the entangling power provides a sufficient condition for the inseparability of the cv state being investigated .",
    "therefore , another question that we naturally address in this paper is  how can we transfer the entanglement generated by a microscopic - macroscopic interaction to the initially separable bipartite system of two non - interacting qubits ? \"    differently from the above mentioned effective - projection technique  @xcite , our procedure is operative as it is immediate to design the general scenario for an experimental investigation .",
    "this approach can be extended to other non - trivial class of non - gaussian cv states , for example a set of states which can be generated from the generalized cat - like state by measuring the microscopic part of the superposition and subsequently unitarily manipulating the remaining macroscopic part .",
    "this results in the coherent superposition of thermally averaged two - mode states . again , the application of the entangling power test shows ability to induce entanglement in a two - qubit system .",
    "our analysis reinforces the ideas related to the possibility of macroscopic entanglement at non - zero temperature .",
    "we thus provide a new tool in the non - trivial problem of the quantitative analysis of the properties of non - gaussian states which is flexible enough to reveal temperature - resilient macroscopic entanglement .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ gattogenerale ]",
    ", we introduce a generalized cat - like state , which is a macroscopic non - local state .",
    "we first address the behavior of the state s variance matrix to show that the simon s cv - state entanglement criterion fails in revealing any quantum correlation in this state . on the other hand , by changing picture and restricting the attention to bidimensional subsectors of the infinite dimensional hilbert space of the cv subsystem , it is possible to infer the entanglement properties of this class of generalized cat - like states .",
    "this approach allows us to highlight the striking effects of temperature and displacement ( in the phase space ) over the entanglement of the state , thus providing an important quantitative insight into its properties . in section  [ trasferisco ] , by adopting the entangling power viewpoint , we show that entanglement can be reliably transferred to two independent qubits which have interacted with the state under investigation , giving us the possibility of constructing a highly entangled quantum channel of static qubits . on the other hand",
    ", this approach provides us with a way to detect entanglement in the cv state simply by looking at the state of two qubits .",
    "section  [ experiment ] describes exactly this experimental protocol and a modified one which , with limited modifications to the original idea , turns out to be realistic .",
    "finally , in section [ conclusioni ] we resume the central results of our analysis and complement it with a brief study the entanglement of thermally weighted entangled coherent states .",
    "we show that the entangling power is an exploitable tool in this case as well and reveals the presence of entanglement within a significant range of temperature .",
    "let us consider the interaction of a qubit of its logical states @xmath0 , initially prepared in the balanced linear superposition @xmath1 , with the macroscopic part of the generalized cat - like state here represented by a physical system @xmath2 in an initial displaced thermal state @xmath3 .",
    "we have introduced the coherent state @xmath4 of its amplitude @xmath5 and the thermal probability distribution @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the variance of the distribution , related to the temperature of the thermal distribution by the relation @xmath8 with @xmath9 . here",
    ", @xmath10 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath11 is the radiation temperature and @xmath12 its frequency .",
    "we have indicated with @xmath13 the displacement of the state from the origin of the phase - space .",
    "the relation between the variance and the mean photon number @xmath14 of the field is @xmath15 .",
    "the interaction is ruled by the cross - phase modulation hamiltonian @xmath16 ( @xmath17 is assumed throughout the paper ) .",
    "here @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) are the annihilation and creation operators of the microscopic ( macroscopic ) system respectively and @xmath22 is the rate of non - linearity of the interaction  @xcite . after an interaction time @xmath23 ,",
    "the dynamical evolution corresponding to the hamiltonian @xmath24 gives rise to the state @xmath25 with @xmath26 .",
    "here , @xmath27 is the cross - phase shift induced by the model @xmath24 .    in order to pursue our investigation",
    ", we find it convenient to preliminarily consider just the pure superposition @xmath28 , whose entanglement properties we want to quantitatively address .",
    "this state has been considered as a reasonable example of schrdinger cat state and has been experimentally produced as an entangled state of internal and external degrees of freedom of a single trapped - ion  @xcite .",
    "clearly , for @xmath29 , this state carries almost one ebit of entanglement .",
    "however , the asymmetric non - gaussian nature of this superposition makes the entanglement analysis of this state quite non - trivial .",
    "for instance , the entanglement does not emerge at the level of the variance matrix .",
    "the variance matrix of a two - mode cv state is defined as @xmath30 .",
    "the variance matrix is in one - to - one correspondence with the characteristic functions of a gaussian cv state which , in turns , gives us information about the actual state of the system  @xcite .",
    "however , this is not true for the non - gaussian state @xmath28 , whose variance matrix reads @xmath31 with @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 here we have defined @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 . we have found that simon s separability criterion  @xcite which is the most successful criterion for cv entanglement , is not able to show quantum correlations in this state . interestingly enough",
    ", the criterion fails for @xmath38 which is the value at which one would expect the largest degree of entanglement to be found between the subsystems .",
    "we have also checked that the conditions for inseparability established in  @xcite is not verified by the state we are considering so that other ways have to be researched .",
    "the above intuitive expectation about the entanglement at @xmath38 is confirmed by the following simple analysis .",
    "the state @xmath28 can be written in its schmidt decomposition as @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 with the normalization factors @xmath42)}}.\\ ] ] the coefficients of the superposition ( [ schmidt ] ) are defined in terms of the @xmath43 factors as @xmath44 . in order to quantify the entanglement within a state of its density matrix @xmath45",
    ", we use the _ negativity of partial transposition _ ( npt )  @xcite .",
    "npt is a necessary and sufficient condition for entanglement of any bipartite qubit state  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding entanglement measure is defined as @xmath46 with @xmath47 the negative eigenvalue of the partial transposition of @xmath45 with respect to one of its parties .",
    "the entanglement in @xmath28 can be expressed as @xmath48 in the range @xmath49 $ ] and regardless of @xmath50 , eq .",
    "( [ gattononintegrato ] ) is a monotonously increasing function of the phase @xmath51 saturating at @xmath52 .",
    "the saturation value of this function depends on @xmath50 and , as a function of the interaction phase @xmath51 , is reached faster as @xmath50 is increased .    0.5cm*(a ) *    the schmidt decomposition of @xmath28 is a useful tool in order to test in a simple way the entanglement present in the thermally weighted superposition @xmath53 . by applying the npt criterion",
    ", we find that @xmath54 which , involving the double gaussian integration of the square root of an exponential function is , in general , hard to compute analytically .",
    "nevertheless , it has been possible to numerically sample the behavior of this function against the interaction phase @xmath51 , for different values of the variance @xmath7 and the displacement @xmath13 .",
    "the results are shown in figs .",
    "[ gattointegrato ] * ( a ) * and * ( b ) * , where @xmath55 and @xmath56 have been considered , respectively .",
    "counterintuitively , the thermal weighting of the superposition does not smear out the entanglement in the bimodal state .",
    "significant entanglement can be found for any value of the variance @xmath7 ( _ i.e. _ at any value of the temperature considered ) . by looking at fig .",
    "[ gattointegrato ] * ( a ) * we see that , as the variance @xmath7 increases , more entanglement is found in the state in eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) .",
    "moreover , as soon as a large displacement @xmath13 is considered , the differences between the results corresponding to distributions characterized by increasing variances becomes irrelevant .",
    "the saturation value of entanglement is reached regardless of the actual value of @xmath7 ( see fig .",
    "[ gattointegrato ] * ( b ) * ) , quicker than the case of a small @xmath13 .",
    "this matches the results found in terms of the negativity of the wigner function associated with the state @xmath53 which , for moderate values of @xmath7 , deepens its negative part for larger values of @xmath13 .",
    "on the other hand , this effect represents a huge practical advantage in the production of the entangled state we are studying .",
    "indeed , it is well - known that the currently achievable rates of non - linearity are not sufficiently large to guarantee an interaction phase @xmath38  @xcite .",
    "this would signify that , for a small @xmath7 , the produceable entanglement would be very faint ( see fig .",
    "[ gattointegrato ] * ( a ) * ) .",
    "however , it is sufficient to displace the thermal field more in order to achieve a significant improvement in the rate of entanglement generation .",
    "this is in line with the idea of using weak nonlinearities for various applications @xcite .",
    "thus , our scheme seems to be experimentally accessible even in the more realistic situation of a small kerr non - linearity .",
    "we believe that this result is important in the context of entanglement in mesoscopic systems at finite temperatures  @xcite as we have shown a model where the quantum nature of a microscopic resource is enough in order to induce intrinsically quantum features in a macroscopic object ( as our displaced thermal field ) .",
    "these features , which are temperature - resilient , can be highlighted by partitioning the cv hilbert space into quadruplets at fixed @xmath57 and averaging over the temperature - dependent probability distribution .",
    "in this section we address a relevant question related to the possibility of transferring the quantum correlations established in the generalized cat - like state @xmath53 to the initially separable bipartite system of two non - interacting qubits .",
    "this problem is worth addressing under many viewpoints . _ in primis _ , would the entanglement set in the generalized cat - like state be useful if a quantum channel has to be realized ? in the context of distributed qip , this is a relevant question as it has been shown that reliable channels , exhibiting genuine quantum features , are an irremissible resource for the performances of quantum computation  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the interface between hetero - dimensional systems is _ per se _ a hot topic which has attracted a considerable attention , recently , especially focused onto the transfer of entanglement from a cv system to one which",
    "_ lives _ in a discrete hilbert space  @xcite .",
    "finally , while the tomographic reconstruction of the properties of a cv system is a hard task to perform , its discrete - variable counterpart may be accomplished with much easier experimental protocols  @xcite .",
    "it would be thus desirable to design a protocol which allows one to infer the entanglement within a cv state without relying on its direct tomography . in a discrete - variable system",
    "this is possible through , for instance , entanglement witnesses detected with a minimal number of measurements @xcite .",
    "such a protocol is provided by the research for the entanglement generated in a discrete - variable bipartite subsystem by the cv one via some _ local _ qubit - cv interaction .",
    "this gives a sufficient criterion for the entanglement between the field modes  @xcite .",
    "indeed , if the two cv modes are separable , there is no way that , through simple local interactions , quantum correlations could be established .",
    "this strategy has been already proven to be efficient in revealing the entanglement between two cv modes which have been fed into two spatially separated cavities and interacted with a pair of qubits .",
    "the question of there being any entanglement left between the cavity field modes after the interaction with the qubits has found a positive quantitative answer through the analysis of the _ entangling power_. this is the strategy we would like to use here .    of course , the quantitative results will depend on the model chosen for the local mode - qubit interaction . however , the implementation of an arbitrary model for light - matter interaction is not a trivial point . specifically , it is a physical setup - dependent issue ( meaning that certain physical setups enable the implementation of certain interaction models more straightforwardly than other ) .",
    "it is the physical system that one has in mind which dictates the most suitable form of the local interaction .",
    "nevertheless , recently it has been shown that the standard jaynes - cummings ( jc ) model for resonant ( as well as dispersive ) qubit - boson interaction is common to many different physical realization of a quantum device and in a range of frequency from microwave to optical @xcite .",
    "this dresses with physical significance the choice of the interaction @xmath58 [ @xmath59 for the first field mode - qubit system and @xmath60 for the second ] to govern the local dynamics of each qubit - field mode subsystem . here",

    "in investigating the entangled properties of mesoscopic systems at finite temperature , in the quantum optics domain , we often face some difficulties related to a certain lack of analytical tools .",
    "this has strongly limited the insight we could gain about the specific behavior , in terms of quantum correlations , of particular classes of states ( especially non - gaussian states ) .",

    "it has revealed that powerful experimental criteria exist , for the entanglement investigation , beyond the cv criteria for inseparability  @xcite .",
    "our study is , thus , a particularly illuminating case of this second , more operative scenario .    as an additional example of the effectiveness of the entangling power test , here we briefly assess the problem of the entanglement in the class of states generated by the entire protocol described by the setup in fig .",

    "the detection of mode @xmath92 is performed onto the basis @xmath105 ( with @xmath106 ) . conditioned on finding @xmath107 , the action of the beam - splitter which mixes mode @xmath2 to vacuum gives rise to the state ( we assume @xmath38 ) @xmath108 where @xmath109 and @xmath110 are proper normalization factors . in order to fix the ideas ,",
    "let us focus on the case of @xmath111 being found with @xmath112 , for which the expression of the variance matrix is particularly straightforward , reading @xmath113 it is easy to check that simon s separability condition is not violated by eq .",

    "however , following the lines depicted in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is straightforward to show that eq .",

    "this result is confirmed by the application of the entangling power test which shows that entanglement ( as large as @xmath114 for v around @xmath115 and @xmath116 ) can be transferred to two mutually non - interacting qubits using the symmetric scheme of section  [ trasferisco ] .",
