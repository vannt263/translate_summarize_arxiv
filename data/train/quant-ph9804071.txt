    "in a quantum setting , the coexistence of regular and chaotic regions in a mixed phase space leads to a variety of uncommon coherence phenomena .",
    "most prominent among them is chaotic tunneling@xcite , the coherent exchange of probability between symmetry - related regular islands that are separated by a chaotic layer , not by a static potential barrier .",
    "chaotic tunneling comes about by an interplay of classical nonlinear  typically bistable  dynamics and quantum coherence .",
    "it therefore reflects features of the classical phase space , such as the width of the chaotic layer@xcite and the structure of the `` coast line '' @xcite separating it from the adjacent regular regions , as well as fine details of the quantum spectrum like exact and avoided crossings . in previous work @xcite",
    ", it has been shown that , as the chaotic layer grows with increasing nonlinearity , the tunnel splittings widen collectively .",
    "superimposed on this global trend of the parameter dependence , however , there are strong fluctuations , occurring on a smaller parameter scale and restricted to individual tunnel doublets @xcite .",
    "a major source of these fluctuations are the disturbances of doublets , suffered as they are intersected by other levels .",
    "the most common type of such intersections is formed when a doublet , pertaining to a pair of eigenstates located on symmetry - related quantizing tori , encounters a singlet that belongs to an eigenstate in the chaotic sea@xcite .",
    "the chaotic states , even if they no longer come in pairs close in energy , can still be classified as even or odd .",
    "this fact determines the structure of the singlet - doublet crossings : the partner in the doublet sharing the symmetry of the chaotic singlet is repelled by the singlet  together , they form an avoided crossing .",
    "the partner with opposite symmetry must either be intersected in an exact crossing close to the avoided one , or else the order within the doublet is reversed from one side of the crossing to the other .",
    "the variety of configurations of such crossings is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : crossing ] .    in the present paper , we study chaotic tunneling in the vicinity of singlet - doublet crossings , under the influence of incoherent processes . near a crossing ,",
    "level separations deviate vastly , in both directions , from the typical tunnel splitting ( cf .",
    "[ fig : crossing ] ) .",
    "this is reflected in time - domain phenomena ranging from the suppression of tunneling to a strong increase in its rate and to complicated quantum beats@xcite . in section [ sec : cons ] , we briefly review chaotic tunneling in our working model , a harmonically driven quartic double well@xcite .",
    "singlet - doublet crossings are identified and characterized by their signature in terms of quasienergy and mean energy .",
    "we describe the behaviour of the eigenstates close to a crossing and analyze the coherent dynamics in terms of a simple three - state model .",
    "tunneling is associated with extremely small energy scales , all the more in the semiclassical regime we are interested in .",
    "it is therefore particularly sensitive to any disruption of coherence as it occurs due to the unavoidable coupling to the environment . as immediate consequences",
    ", the symmetry underlying the formation of tunnel doublets is generally broken , and an additional energy scale is introduced , the effective finite width attained by each discrete level .",
    "tunneling and related coherence phenomena are thus rendered transients that occur  if at all  on the way towards an asymptotic equilibrium state .",
    "singlet - doublet crossings , in turn , drastically change the nondissipative energy scales and replace the two - level by a three - level structure . as a consequence ,",
    "the familiar way tunneling fades out in the presence of dissipation is also significantly altered . near a crossing ,",
    "the coherent dynamics can last much longer than for the unperturbed doublet , despite the presence of the same decoherence than outside the crossing , establishing `` chaos - induced coherence '' . depending on temperature",
    ", it can also be destroyed on a much shorter time scale .    in section",
    "[ sec : diss ] , we first outline the modifications of our model necessary to incorporate dissipation .",
    "we treat the quantum dissipative dynamics within the framework of the floquet formalism @xcite . in the present context of an interplay of tunneling with incoherent processes , we focus on the regime of weak dissipation .",
    "very long time scales are therefore involved , both in the coherent dynamics and in the bath response . in this case",
    ", the usual ( markov and rotating - wave ) approximations resorted to in the elimination of the external degrees of freedom , have to be reconsidered critically .",
    "the coupling to the environment indirectly couples the three levels in the crossing to all the other states of the central system . on the basis of numerical results for the full driven double well with dissipation",
    ", we reveal the limitations of the three - level approximation and identify additional features of the full dynamics not covered by it .",
    "in particular , we consider the long - time asymptotics  the quantum attractor  and the phase - space structure associated with it .",
    "section [ sec : conc ] serves to summarize our results and to suggest directions of further research .",
    "as a prototypical working model , we consider the quartic double well with a spatially homogeneous driving force harmonic in time .",
    "it is defined by the hamiltonian @xmath0 apart from mere scaling , the classical phase space of @xmath1 depends only on the presence or absence , and the sign , of the @xmath2 term .",
    "otherwise , it has no free parameter . in the quantum - mechanical case , the parameter @xmath3 plays the rle of an inverse quantum of action .",
    "it controls the barrier height and can be interpreted as the ( approximate ) number of doublets with energies below the top of the barrier .",
    "accordingly , the classical limit is reached by letting @xmath4 .",
    "the influence of the driving on the classical phase space structure is characterized by the rescaled amplitude @xmath5 and frequency @xmath6 .",
    "this implies that the classical dynamics is independent of the barrier height @xmath7 .",
    "the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath1 is invariant under the parity @xmath8 : @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "this symmetry is generally destroyed by the driving . with the above choice of @xmath12 ,",
    "however , a more general , dynamical symmetry is retained @xcite .",
    "it is defined by the operation @xmath13 and represents a generalized parity acting in the extended phase space spanned by @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and phase , i.e. , time @xmath16 .",
    "the invariance under @xmath17 of @xmath18 allows to classify all its quantum eigenstates as even or odd .    as a consequence of the periodic time dependence of @xmath18 ,",
    "the relevant generator of the quantum dynamics is now the floquet operator @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes time ordering . according to the floquet theorem ,",
    "the adiabatic states of the system are the eigenstates of @xmath21",
    ". they can be written in the form @xmath22 with @xmath23 the associated eigenphases @xmath24 , referred to as quasienergies , come in classes , @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "this is suggested by a fourier expansion of the @xmath27 , @xmath28 the index @xmath29 counts the number of quanta in the driving field .",
    "otherwise the members of a class @xmath30 are physically equivalent .",
    "therefore , the quasienergy spectrum can be reduced to a single `` brillouin zone '' , @xmath31 .",
    "since the quasienergies have the character of phases , they can be ordered only locally , not globally .",
    "a quantity that is defined on the full real axis and therefore does allow for a complete ordering , is the mean energy @xcite @xmath32 it is related to the corresponding quasienergy by @xmath33 ) .",
    "the second term on the right - hand side plays the rle of a geometric phase accumulated over this period@xcite . without the driving , @xmath34 , as it should be . by inserting the fourier expansion ( [ floquet : fourier ] ) the mean energy takes",
    "the form @xmath35 it shows that the @xmath36th floquet channel gives a contribution @xmath37 to the mean energy , weighted by the fourier coefficient @xmath38@xcite .",
    "quasienergies and floquet states are obtained numerically by solving the matrix eigenvalue equation@xcite @xmath39 equivalent to the time - dependent schrdinger equation .",
    "it is derived by inserting the eigenstates ( [ eq : floquetstat ] ) into the schrdinger equation , fourier expanding , and using the representation by the eigenstates of the unperturbed hamiltonian , @xmath40 the invariance of the system under @xmath17 is of considerable help in solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : floqueteq ] ) , because it completely decouples the respective systems of eigenvalue equations for the even and odd subspaces @xcite .      with the driving @xmath12 switched off ,",
    "the classical phase space generated by @xmath18 exhibits the constituent features of a bistable hamiltonian system .",
    "there is a separatrix at @xmath41 .",
    "it forms the border between two sets of trajectories : one set , with @xmath42 , comes in symmetry - related pairs , each partner of which oscillates in either one of the two potential minima .",
    "the other set consists of unpaired trajectories , with @xmath43 , that encircle both wells in a spatially symmetric fashion .    increasing the amplitude of the driving from zero onwards has two principal consequences for the classical dynamics ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cldyn ] ) : the separatrix is destroyed as a closed curve and replaced by a homoclinic tangle@xcite of stable and unstable manifolds . as a whole , it forms a chaotic layer in the vicinity and with the topology of the former separatrix .",
    "it opens the way for diffusive transport between the two potential wells . due to the nonlinearity of the potential",
    ", there is an infinite set of resonances of the driving with the unperturbed motion , both inside and outside the wells@xcite .",
    "since the period of the unperturbed , closed trajectories diverges for @xmath44 , the resonances accumulate towards the separatrix of the unperturbed system . by its sheer phase - space area ,",
    "the first resonance ( the one for which the periods of the driving and of the unperturbed oscillation are in a ratio of 1:1 ) is prominent among the others and soon ( in terms of increasing amplitude @xmath45 ) exceeds the size of the `` order - zero '' regular areas near the bottom of each well .",
    "for the values of @xmath45 and @xmath6 chosen in the numerical calculations in this paper , all higher resonances remain negligible in size .",
    "the borderline between the chaotic layer along the former separatrix and the regular regions within and outside the wells is therefore quite sharply defined .",
    "the `` coastal strip '' formed by hierarchies of regular islands around higher resonances remains narrow .",
    "for the tunneling dynamics , the rle of states located in the border region@xcite is therefore not significant here .",
    "both major tendencies in the evolution of the classical phase space  extension of the chaotic layer and growth of the first resonance  leave their specific traces in the quasienergy spectrum .",
    "the tunnel doublets characterizing the unperturbed spectrum for @xmath42 pertain to states located on pairs of symmetry - related quantizing tori in the regular regions within the wells . with increasing size of the chaotic layer ,",
    "the quantizing tori successively resolve in the chaotic sea .",
    "the corresponding doublets disappear as distinct structures in the spectrum as they attain a splitting of the same order as the mean level separation .",
    "the gradual widening of the doublets proceeds as a smooth function of the driving amplitude @xcite .",
    "this function roughly obeys a power law@xcite , cf.fig .",
    "[ fig : powerlaw ] .",
    "as soon as a pair of states is no longer supported by any torus - like manifold , including fractal@xcite and vague tori @xcite , the corresponding eigenvalues detach themselves from the regular ladder to which they formerly belonged .",
    "they can then fluctuate freely in the spectrum and thereby `` collide '' with other chaotic singlets or regular doublets .",
    "the appearance of a regular region , large enough to accomodate several eigenstates , around the first resonance introduces a second ladder of doublets into the spectrum .",
    "size and shape of the first resonance vary in a way different from the fate of the main regular region .",
    "the corresponding doublet ladder therefore moves in the spectrum independently of the doublets that pertain to the main regular region , and of the chaotic singlets .",
    "this gives rise to additional singlet - doublet and even to doublet - doublet encounters .      among the various types of quasienergy crossings that occur according to the above scenario , those involving a regular doublet and a chaotic singlet are the most common . in order to give a quantitative account of such crossings and the associated coherent dynamics , and for later reference in the context of the incoherent dynamics",
    ", we shall now discuss them in terms of a simple three - state model , devised much in the spirit of ref .",
    "@xcite .    far to the left of the crossing , we expect the following situation : there is a doublet of floquet states @xmath46 ' ) and odd ( ` @xmath47 ' ) generalized parity , respectively , residing on a pair of quantizing tori in one of the regular ( subscript ` r ' ) regions",
    ". we have assumed that the quasienergy splitting ( as opposed to the unperturbed splitting ) is @xmath48 .",
    "the global relative phases can be chosen such that the superpositions @xmath49 are initially localized in the right and the left well , respectively , and tunnel back and forth with a frequency @xmath50 given by the tunnel splitting in the presence of the driving .",
    "as the third player , we introduce a floquet state @xmath51 contains a large number of harmonics . without loss of generality",
    ", its generalized parity is fixed to be odd . for the quasienergy",
    ", we have assumed that @xmath52 , where @xmath53 can be regarded as a measure of the distance from the crossing .",
    "the structure of the classical phase space then implies that the mean energy of the chaotic state should be close to the top of the barrier and far above that of the doublet .",
    "we assume , like for the quasienergies , a small splitting of the mean energies pertaining to the regular doublet , @xmath54 .    in order to model an avoided crossing between @xmath55 and @xmath56",
    ", we suppose that there is a non - vanishing matrix element @xmath57 . for the singlet - doublet crossings under study",
    ", we typically find that @xmath58 .",
    "neglecting the coupling with all other states , we obtain the three - state ( subscript ` 3s ' ) floquet hamiltonian @xmath59 in the three - dimensional hilbert space spanned by @xmath60 . its floquet states read @xmath61 their quasienergies are @xmath62 the mean energies are approximately given by @xmath63 where contributions of the matrix element @xmath64 have been neglected .",
    "the angle @xmath65 describes the mixing between the floquet states @xmath66 and @xmath56 and is a measure of the distance to the avoided crossing . by diagonalizing the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham3s ] )",

    "therefore , there is also an exchange of @xmath77 and @xmath78 in an exact crossing , cf .",

    "their crossing is exact , since they pertain to states with opposite parity ( cf.fig .",
    "[ fig : crossing]a , b ) .",
    "numerical evidence shows that this idealized picture is not always correct .",
    "it may well happen that even far away from a crossing , the doublet splitting does not exactly return to its value on the opposite side ( cf .  figs .",
    "[ fig : num3s]a , [ fig : splitting ] ) .",
    "it is even possible that an exact crossing of @xmath80 and @xmath81 does not take place at all in the vicinity of the crossing . in that case , the relation of the quasienergies in the doublet gets reversed via the crossing ( fig .",

    "nevertheless , the above scenario captures the essential features .",

    "both have now support in the chaotic layer as well as in the symmetry - related regular regions and thus are of a hybrid nature .",
    "here , the tunneling involves all the three states and must at least be described by a three - level system .",
    "the exchange of probability between the two regular regions proceeds via a `` stop - over '' in the chaotic region@xcite .",

    "this restores the familiar coherent tunneling in the sense that there is again a simple periodic exchange of probability between the regular regions@xcite .",
    "however , the rate is much larger if compared to the situation far off the crossing , and the chaotic region is now temporarily populated during each probability transfer , twice per tunneling cycle ( fig .",

    ", each floquet state @xmath138 contains a large number of fourier components and @xmath161 is given by a sum over contributions with quasienergies @xmath167 .",
    "thus a decay to states with `` higher '' quasienergy ( recall that quasienergies do not allow for a global ordering ) becomes possible due to terms with @xmath168 .",
    "physically , they describe dissipative transitions under absorption of driving - field quanta .",
    "correspondingly , the system tends to occupy floquet states comprising many fourier components with low index @xmath29 . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : meanen : fourier ] ) , these states have low mean energy .",
    "the effects under study are found for a driving with a frequency of the order of unity .",
    "thus for a quasienergy doublet , i.e. , far off the three - level crossing , we have @xmath169 , and @xmath170 is dominated by contributions with @xmath168 , where the splitting has only small influence .",
    "however , as a consequence of symmetry , the splitting is the main difference between the two partners of the quasienergy doublet . therefore ,",
    "with respect to dissipation , both should behave similarly . in particular",
    ", one expects an equal population of the doublets even in the limit of zero temperature ( fig .",
    "[ fig : occupation]a ) .",
    "this is in contrast to the undriven case .    in the vicinity of a singlet - doublet",
    "crossing the situation is more subtle . here , the odd partner , say , of the doublet mixes with a chaotic singlet , cf.eq .",
    "( [ eq : psi012 ] ) , and thus acquires components with higher energy . due to the high mean energy @xmath171 of the chaotic singlet , close to the top of the barrier",
    ", the decay back to the ground state can also proceed indirectly via other states with mean energy below @xmath171 .",
    "thus @xmath172 and @xmath173 are depleted and mainly @xmath174 will be populated . however",
    ", if the temperature is significantly above the splitting of the avoided crossing , thermal activation from @xmath174 to @xmath175 , accompanied by depletion via the states below @xmath171 , becomes possible .",
    "thus asymptotically , all these states become populated in a steady flow ( figs .  [",
    "fig : occupation]b , c ) .",
    "an important global characteristic of the asymptotic state is its coherence @xmath176 .",
    "its value gives approximately the reciprocal of the number of incoherently occupied states .",
    "it equals unity only if the attractor is a pure state . according to the above scenario",
    ", we expect @xmath177 to assume the value @xmath178 , in a regime with strong driving but preserved doublet structure , reflecting the incoherent population of the ground - state doublet . in the vicinity of the singlet - doublet crossing where the doublet structure is dissolved",
    ", its value should be close to unity for temperatures @xmath179 and much less than unity for @xmath180 ( figs .",
    "[ fig : cic ] , [ fig : coh ] ) .",
    "this means that the crossing of the chaotic singlet with the regular doublet leads to an improvement of coherence if the temperature is below the splitting of the avoided crossing , and a loss of coherence for temperatures above the splitting .",
    "this phenomenon amounts to a _ chaos - induced coherence _ or incoherence , respectively .",
    "the crucial rle of the decay via states not involved in the three - level crossing can be demonstrated by comparing it with the dissipative dynamics including only these three levels ( plus the bath ) . at the crossing , the three - state model results in a completely different type of asymptotic state ( fig .",
    "[ fig : coh ] ) .",
    "the failure of the three - state model in the presence of dissipation clearly indicates that in the vicinity of the singlet - doublet crossing , it is important to take a large set of levels into account .",
    "nonlinear systems with a mixed phase space still represent a formidable challenge for a theoretical understanding . on the classical level ,",
    "the intricate fractal interweaving of regular and chaotic regions of phase space is far from being exhaustively studied .",
    "quantum - mechanical uncertainty reduces the richness of the classical phase - space structure , but at the same time , coherence effects like tunneling add new elements to the dynamics . for example , in a bistable system , a driving with an energy in the regime between the unperturbed tunnel splittings and the typical separation of doublets leads to transport phenomena that combine tunneling and classical chaotic diffusion as essential elements .",
    "yet another basic energy scale enters if the unavoidable coupling of the system to its environment is taken into account . if the finite width the levels attain in the presence of dissipation is comparable , in turn , to the energies characterizing driven tunneling , unfamiliar phenomena due to the interplay of chaos , tunneling , and decoherence occur in the transient dynamics and possibly also in the asymptotic state of the driven damped quantum system .    in this paper , we have selected a specific case out of the host of problems to be studied in this field : dissipative chaotic tunneling in the vicinity of crossings of chaotic singlets with tunnel doublets . in order to obtain a firm quantitative basis ,",
    "we have endowed a prototypical model for chaotic tunneling , a harmonically driven double well , with dissipation .",
    "thereby , we have followed the usual approach of coupling to a heat bath , but adapted to the periodic time dependence of the central system .",
    "moreover , we have carefully avoided to destroy , by the approximations introduced in the derivation of a master equation , the specific spectral characteristics of chaotic tunneling that we are interested in . as a simple intuitive model to compare against ,",
    "we have constructed a three - state system which in the case of vanishing dissipation , provides a faithful description of an isolated singlet - doublet crossing .    as an example for the interplay of chaotic tunneling with dissipation , we mention an effect that might be termed `` chaos - induced coherence '' for short .",
    "suppose that damping and temperature are such that far off the singlet - doublet crossing , the level width is of the same order or larger than the tunnel splitting .",
    "there , coherent tunneling is then largely suppressed even as a transient .",
    "close to the crossing , however , the widening of the doublet enforced by the intersecting third level creates a separation of the time scales of the coherent tunneling and of its decay due to incoherent processes , without altering the dissipation as such . as a consequence ,",
    "the transient dynamics now exhibits many tunneling cycles , each of which includes two `` stop overs '' in the chaotic phase - space region , one on the way to , one on the way back .",
    "the study of the asymptotic state , the `` quantum attractor '' , demonstrates clearly that a three - state model of the singlet - doublet crossing is no longer adequate once dissipation is effective .",
    "this is so because the coupling to the heat bath enables processes of decay and thermal activation that connect the states in the crossing with other , `` external '' states of the central system . in the presence of driving , the asymptotic state",
    "is no longer literally a state of equilibrium .",
    "rather , incoherent processes create a steady flow of probability involving states within as well as outside the crossing . as a result ,",
    "the composition of the asymptotic state , expressed for example by its coherence @xmath176 , will be markedly different at the center of the crossing as compared to the asymptotic state far away from the crossing , even if that is barely visible in the corresponding phase - space structure",
    ".    many more phenomena at the overlap of chaos , tunneling , and dissipation await being unraveled .",
    "they include four - state crossings formed when two doublets intersect , chaotic bloch tunneling along extended potentials with a large number of unit cells instead of just two , the influence of decoherence on a multi - step mechanism of chaotic tunneling @xcite and transient tunneling between coexisting strange attractors , to mention only a few . at the same time , analytical tools more specifically taylored to the investigation of the quantum - classical correspondence in mixed systems , such as a phase - space entropy @xcite , will provide additional insight .",
