    "this agrees with the nonrelativistic result where there is no radiative correction at all to the propagator .",

    "this last step is the fundamental reinterpretation required for our reduction process .",
    "it produces an unrenormalized logarithmic divergent four - point function as one has in the nonrelativistic theory ( [ lagrannr ] ) .",
    "the above nonrelativistic reduction of the leading term of the l - contribution to the two particle scattering amplitude is equivalent to the @xmath139 limit effectuated on the classical lagrangian@xmath140 and it is also reproduced by making a foldy - wouthuysen transformation in the free part of the lagrangian ( [ lagran])@xmath141 .",
    "an interesting aspect of this reduction procedure is that the contribution of high energy states appears providing the necessary counterterm to make the amplitude finite instead of logarithmic divergent .",
    "the divergence produced in the low energy contribution ( [ aldom ] ) would be naturally compensated by the high part , if the full , relativistic , theory were considered .",
    "one can , in this way , better understand the renormalization of the nonrelativistic model of ref . .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that , one could naively think that the divergence of the 2-particle amplitude calculated with the nonrelativistic theory is due to the complete exclusion of the propagation backwards in time .",
    "in fact , if one splits the relativistic propagator as a sum of its positive ( particle ) and negative ( antiparticle ) frequency parts ,    @xmath142    the relativistic cm s - channel amplitude can be written as @xmath143 where    @xmath144 with the superscripts @xmath145 and @xmath146 denoting the contributions of the particle - particle and the antiparticle - antiparticle propagations , respectively . as one immediately sees , both of these parcels are finite when @xmath147 naturally , one can introduce an auxiliary cutoff to separate the l- and the h- contributions for each part , and doing so , one finds that the particle propagation contribution is dominant , as expected .",
    "let us now examine the sub - dominant order .",
    "disregarding constant terms which can be absorbed into a coupling constant renormalization , the low energy part is @xmath148 \\left [ \\ln \\left ( \\frac{4\\lambda ^2}{(\\vec p_1-\\vec p_2)^2}\\right ) + i\\pi \\right ] .\\label{ll}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to reproduce the new terms appearing in this expression , we add to ( [ lagrannr ] ) the effective interaction lagrangian @xmath149 which is the more general , dimension 6 , quadrilinear local nonrelativistic interaction . for the calculation of the contributions arising from these new vertices we will have to introduce ultraviolet cutoffs .",
    "it is easily verified that the polynomial part of the result is cutoff dependent and this freedom can be used to adjust it to match the polynomial part of ( [ ll ] ) .",
    "for that reason , we restrict the discussion to the non - polynomial part of the additional contribution which , in one loop order and up to @xmath150 , is ( again , disregarding constant terms )    @xmath151.\\ ] ]    comparing with ( [ ll ] ) we find @xmath152 which fixes the effective nonrelativistic lagrangian up to the order @xmath82 . as before ,",
    "the high energy part furnishes theo counterterm needed to make the amplitude finite .",
    "in this work we discussed the nonrelativistic limit of the 2 + 1 dimensional @xmath153 theory by means of a scheme which separates the contributions from the high and low virtual momenta in the loop integrations .",
    "this method provides a systematic way of extracting different orders in @xmath154 in the nonrelativistic approximation and can be applied to more general situations .",
    "proceeding along these lines , we were able to derive an effective lagrangian which , up to order @xmath155 , correctly reproduces the nonrelativistic limit .",
    "the interaction lagrangian so obtained is equivalent , in the leading order , to the quantum mechanical delta function potential .",
    "the new terms arising in the subleading order , however , can not be interpreted in terms of a two body potential ."
