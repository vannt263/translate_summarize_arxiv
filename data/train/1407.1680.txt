    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) belong to the most energetic classes of astrophysical objects , since they can be seen even in the far distances of the universe .",
    "especially blazars , a sub - class of agn , characterize these high energetic events .",
    "blazars cover the entire electromagnetic emission spectrum from the very low radio frequencies up to very high energy @xmath0-rays , divided into two broad non - thermal emission humps . according to the generally accepted agn classification scheme ( urry & padovani , 1995 )",
    ", blazars are viewed at a very small angle with respect to the jet .",
    "the jet originates close to the central accreting super - massive black hole , and is a highly collimated , magnetized , relativistic outflow containing a mixture of electrons , positrons , and protons .",
    "the standard one - zone model of blazar emission assumes a spherical , homogeneous emission region ( also referred to as a blob ) travelling at relativistic speeds down the jet . in the reference frame of the blob ,",
    "the relativistic particles contained in the emission region emit powerful , non - thermal radiation .",
    "this emission is strongly boosted in the observer s frame due to the relativistic motion of the blob and the small viewing angle .",
    "it is widely accepted that the low - energetic feature in a blazar spectrum is synchrotron emission from electrons ( and probably positrons , which we imply from now on ) . in leptonic models ( for reviews",
    "see bttcher , 2007 ; 2012 ) the protons are assumed to be cold and do not contribute to the blazar emission ( but see , e.g. , bttcher et al . , 2013 ) .",
    "the high energetic emission is then produced by inverse compton scatterings of the electrons with ambient soft photon fields .",
    "such photon fields can be either the internally self - produced synchrotron photons in the so - called synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) process ( jones et al . , 1974 ) , or the thermal photon fields , which are abundant external to the jet , in the so - called external compton ( ec ) process .",
    "external photon fields can be the direct accretion disk radiation ( dermer & schlickeiser , 1993 ) , the radiation of the broad line regions ( sikora et al .",
    ", 1994 ) , or the emission of the dusty torus ( blazejowski et al . ,",
    "2000 ; arbeiter et al . ,",
    "if the blazar emission occurs far away from the central engine , the cosmic microwave background could also serve as a soft target photon field ( bttcher et al . , 2008 ) .",
    "blazars can exhibit very rapid flares with doubling time scales on the order of a few minutes as in the case of pks 2155 - 304 ( aharonian et al .",
    ", 2007 ; 2009 ) , or pks 1222 + 216 ( tavecchio et al . , 2011 ) in the tev range , or mrk 421 ( cui , 2004 ) in the x - rays .",
    "such short flares are theoretically challenging , since typical cooling and light crossing time scales are much longer .",
    "several models have been invoked to explain these fast flares ( e.g. , giannios et al . , 2009 ; ghisellini et al . , 2009 ;",
    "barkov et al . , 2012 ; biteau & giebels , 2012 ) .",
    "most of them have in common that they assume an emission region that is smaller than the cross - section of the jet , and moves much faster than the surrounding jet material .",
    "thus , the smaller light crossing time scale in combination with stronger beaming effects explains the rapid flares .",
    "however , the majority of these models also have in common that the underlying electron energy distribution function is stationary .",
    "since particles are continuously injected into and lost from the source , the particle distribution will reach equilibrium , even if some parameters of the emission region change ( in order to `` cause '' a flaring event ) . on the other hand ,",
    "several investigations have shown that a flare caused by a time - dependent injection of particles into the emission region gives rise to substantially different effects , which decrease the cooling and variability time scales significantly , since the particles can not reach equilibrium ( li & kusunose , 2000 ; katarzynski et al . , 2006 ; schlickeiser & lerche , 2007 ; schlickeiser , 2009 ) .",
    "consider a time - dependent scenario , where highly relativistic electrons are injected once into an emission region pervaded by an isotropic magnetic field .",
    "the electrons inevitably produce synchrotron emission and subsequently inverse compton scatter these self - produced synchrotron photons ( ssc process ) . since no equilibrium can be established , the cooling of the electrons causes a decrease in the energy density in the synchrotron field , and thus the strength of the ssc process decreases accordingly .",
    "this implies a non - linear feedback , since the ssc cooling term depends on the time - dependent electron distribution function itself .",
    "therefore , the ssc cooling efficiency decreases with respect to time .",
    "schlickeiser ( 2009 ) , and zacharias & schlickeiser ( 2010 ) were able to show that this non - linear feedback substantially increases the electron cooling , implying much shorter variability time scales .",
    "the combination of the non - linear ssc cooling term with the linear , time - independent synchrotron and ec cooling terms has strong impacts on the electron distribution function .",
    "due to the time - dependent decrease of the ssc cooling efficiency , the linear cooling terms will begin to dominate the cooling at a certain moment in time .",
    "thus , the cooling behaviour of the source changes , which has strong consequences . for example , in the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) unique breaks emerge , which depend solely on the changing cooling behaviour ( schlickeiser et al . , 2010 ; zacharias & schlickeiser , 2012a ; 2012b ) , and which would normally be explained with complicated equilibrium electron distribution functions ( in some cases without a thorough theoretical justification , e.g. abdo et al . , 2011 )",
    ".    in a recent paper ,",
    "zacharias & schlickeiser ( 2013 , hereafter referred to as zs ) concentrated on the effects of the combined linear and non - linear cooling on the emerging synchrotron light curves .",
    "they incorporated the retardation due to the finite size and the geometry of the source , which washed out some of the effects of the rapid non - linear cooling .",
    "nevertheless , clear differences were shown between the combined and the purely linear cooling .",
    "for instance , breaks in the rising part of the light curve before the light crossing time ( lct ) occurred earlier in the combined cooling scenario than in the purely linear scenario . for variability taking place beyond the lct at lower energies",
    "the respective variability time scales were also considerably shorter in the combined scenario .",
    "thus , at least for the synchrotron emission , the non - linear , time - dependent cooling can potentially explain the rapid flares without the need for extreme assumptions .",
    "in this paper we continue this analysis by calculating analytically the monochromatic light curves for the ssc and the ec emission .",
    "we will use the same set - up as zs , which is outlined in section [ sec : app ] . section [ sec : int ]",
    "presents the necessary parameters and the ssc and ec intensities .",
    "details of the derivation of the intensities are given in appendix [ app : int ] . in sections",
    "[ sec : ssca01 ] and [ sec : ssca10 ] the ssc light curves are calculated for purely linear and combined cooling scenarios , respectively , while the same is done for the ec light curves in sections [ sec : eca01 ] and [ sec : eca10 ] .",
    "we discuss the obtained analytical results and compare them to numerical integrations in section [ sec : dis ] .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to highlight the arising differences between the usual linear and the non - linear cooling scenarios .",
    "we therefore stick to a rather simple model , e.g. monochromatic injection of the electrons .",
    "the simplicity highlights the theoretical differences between the models , but the achieved results are probably too simple for a comparison with actual data .",
    "( with volume @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the position - dependent cross - section ) is received by the observer located to the right at time @xmath3 . figure taken from zs.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    we follow closely the steps of zs ( which are similar to , e.g. chiaberge & ghisellini , 1999 ) .",
    "the light curves are calculated from the respective intensities by incorporating the retardation due to the finite size of the source , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : geo ] . a photon emitted at the front of",
    "the source will arrive at the observer at an earlier time than a photon emitted at the back .",
    "thus , even if the variability in a specific energy band is significantly shorter than the lct scale , we expect photons to be detected until the lct is reached , since photons at the back of the source take a longer time to reach the observer .",
    "additionally , we take into account the geometry of the source , namely in our case the spherical geometry . since in such a geometry every slice of the source has a different volume ( c.f .",
    "[ fig : geo ] ) , the amount of photons reaching the observer depends on the position of the specific emission slice in the source .",
    "this includes the assumption that the observer is located far away from the source implying all photons of a specific slice travel the same distance to the observer .        since we use a spherical geometry ,",
    "the actual position of a comoving observer is not important , since the emitted radiation is distributed isotropically . due to the relativistic transformations , for a stationary observer",
    "the source becomes oblate and brighter depending on the viewing angle to the direction of motion of the emission blob .",
    "this , however , is incorporated by the beaming and doppler corrections , which can be applied after the calculations .",
    "since these effects do not alter the principle differences between the linear and non - linear scenario , they are of no concern for our discussion .    thus , according to zs the monochromatic light curves are calculated with @xmath4 } { \\ , \\mathrm{d } { \\lambda}\\ , } \\label{eq : lc0 } { \\,\\ , .}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath5 is the monochromatic intensity at scattered energy @xmath6 , which is normalized to the electron rest energy @xmath7 , and emission time @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath9 is the observer time located in front of the source ( fig .",
    "[ fig : geo ] ) , and @xmath10 is the lct , with @xmath11 cm being the radius of the spherical source and @xmath12 the speed of light .",
    "the factor @xmath13 is the geometrical weight function , introduced to take into account the different contributions of each slice due to its position @xmath14 in the source .",
    "the integral with respect to @xmath14 over the geometrical weight function yields unity per definition .",
    "the heaviside function in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lc0 ] ) is defined as @xmath15}=1 $ ] for @xmath16 , and @xmath15}=0 $ ] otherwise .",
    "it implies that photons emitted by a specific slice at position @xmath14 can only be detected by the observer after they have crossed the distance from the position of the slice to the front of the source .",
    "hence , only for @xmath17 all slices contribute to the light curve .",
    "the purpose of the heaviside function is to make sure that especially in the beginning the retardation is correctly taken into account , since this is the main cause for the increase of the light curves at early times ( c.f",
    "[ fig : lslog ] - [ fig : lelin ] in section [ sec : dis ] ) .    by altering the heaviside function , more realistic scenarios could be invoked .",
    "for example , by including a velocity - dependent function an internal shock scenario could be realised .",
    "however , such a scenario requires also an alteration of the kinetic equation of the electron distribution function ( c.f .",
    "appendix [ app : int ] ) to include particle acceleration , diffusion and catastrophic losses .",
    "such a thorough treatment can only be done numerically ( e.g. sokolov et al .",
    ", 2004 ; graff et al . , 2008 ; bttcher & dermer , 2010 ) .",
    "since we intend to stick to an analytical derivation , the approach used in this paper is kept simple , and we have to leave aside potentially important processes .",
    "for example , we account for the retardation due to the finite size of the source , but we neglect the internal retardation of the ssc processes . if a synchrotron photon is scattered , it has travelled a short distance between creation and scattering .",
    "this causes a delay in the onset of the ssc process ( cooling ) with respect to the synchrotron and external compton processes ( chen et al . , 2014 ) .",
    "furthermore , the volume from which an electron ( called the scattering electron in this paragraph ) is supplied with synchrotron photons for ssc scattering increases with time until the lct ( sokolov et al . , 2004 ) .",
    "consider two synchrotron photons arriving at the same time at the scattering electron : the photon created at the edge of the volume has travelled a longer time ( and , therefore , was created at an earlier time ) than the photon created closer to the scattering electron .",
    "thus , the photon from the edge of the volume stems from a higher energetic electron , since that electron did not have as much time to cool as the electron creating the photon closer to the scattering electron , as seen from the point of view of the scattering electron .",
    "hence , the photon from the edge of the volume has a higher energy than the photon created nearby .",
    "approximately , a higher incident photon energy implies a larger cross section of the ic scattering .",
    "thus , the ssc process remains strong until the lct ( since until then photons with the highest possible energies are provided from the receding edge of the volume around the scattering electron ) and does not decrease as much as if the internal retardation of the ssc process is neglected .",
    "the potential importance of this effect will be discussed by bttcher et al .",
    "( in prep ) .    for the external compton process",
    "such an intrinsic retardation is not expected , as long as the soft external photon source is stationary in time ( sokolov & marscher , 2005 ) .",
    "further aspects are discussed in section 6.1 of zs .",
    "to summarize , the acceleration time scale might have an impact , since it will contribute to the rising part of the light curve .",
    "it might cause an additional delay at higher energies , since particles have to reach their maximum energy causing the light curve for higher energies to be delayed with respect to lower energies .",
    "such inclusions of acceleration , or the internal retardation , and other potentially important aspects , can not be included in the analytical calculations of this paper for obvious reasons .",
    "they are incorporated in more and more realistic numerical schemes ( e.g. , li & kusunose , 2000 ; mimica et al . , 2004 ; weidinger & spanier , 2010 ; joshi & bttcher , 2011 ; chen et al . , 2014 ) .",
    "in order to calculate the light curves of the ssc and ec processes with eq .",
    "( [ eq : lc0 ] ) , we require the respective monochromatic intensities at emission time @xmath18 . from section [ sec : ssca01 ] on we will refer to the intensities as the unretarded light curves , since they would resemble the light curves for negligible retardation .",
    "the detailed calculations of the ssc and ec intensities can be found in zacharias & schlickeiser ( 2012a ; 2012b ) , respectively .",
    "we present the essential steps in appendix [ app : int ] .",
    "basically , the intensities of all radiation processes are divided into two cases by the injection parameter @xmath19 intensities for @xmath20 are influenced only by the linear and time - independent synchrotron and ec cooling , while intensities for @xmath21 are also influenced by the non - linear , time - dependent ssc cooling term .",

    "this has the disadvantage that we can only present a very narrow part of the light curves in a linear plot .",

    "the early phases of the light curves cover a large part of the plot and may seem overly enhanced compared to the later parts .",
    "the rising phase of the light curves might in this case appear to be more important than the behaviour around the maxima .",
    "the following description of plot properties focuses on the logarithmic plots . in most cases they also apply for the linear plots .",
    "it might seem difficult to directly compare the theoretical light curves with observational ones , since in observations it is hard to mark the starting point @xmath363 . however , the starting point is not really important , since one can always try to fit the maxima by shifting the theoretical light curves . as noted earlier ,",
    "it is not our purpose to fit the theoretical light curves to data , since the injection model is too simple for that .",
    "this work is meant to highlight the differences between the linear and non - linear cooling cases , and that the latter might be important to model rapid flares of blazars .    in order to check the validity of the analytical approximations , we performed numerical integrations of eq .",
    "( [ eq : lc0 ] ) for the respective cases using a gauss - kronrod quadrature method .",

    "they are not shown in the linear plots , since they focus on the more important details of the analytical and numerical curves .    in the following ,",
    "we first describe the ssc and ec light curves , respectively , and then discuss some general considerations that apply for all cases , including synchrotron .",
    "the logarithmic and linear ssc light curves are presented in figs .",
    "[ fig : lslog ] and [ fig : lslin ] , respectively .",
    "the general points , which were briefly mentioned during the analytical calculations , are obvious .    for times smaller than the lct",
    "the light curves increase , because the emission of an increasing number of slices becomes observable . at first , the increase of the emission is quadratic for all energies . if the unretarded light curve cuts off before the lct , the light curves exhibit a break by unity at the time of the unretarded cut - off , and the retarded light curves are cut off at the lct .",
    "this is reasonable , since at later times ( between the unretarded cut - off and the lct ) only a decreasing number of slices in the back contribute .",
    "light curves of lower energies , where the unretarded cut - off is beyond the lct , break at the lct exhibiting the behaviour of the unretarded light curve for later times .    as a matter of fact , the behaviour of the light curves before the lct depends both on the retardation and the geometry of the source .",
    "the former causes the increase , while the latter controls the power of the increase . in the spherical geometry used in this work",
    "the main increase is quadratic , while for example in a cylindrical geometry the main increase would be linear .",
    "furthermore , the early part before the lct is also influenced by the cooling time @xmath276 , if the unretarded light curve cuts off beyond the cooling time , and if the cooling time is shorter than the lct . for example the red and the black curve in the top right plot of fig . [",
    "fig : lslog ] deviate from a quadratic increase between the cooling time for large @xmath364 ( @xmath365 ) and the lct .",
    "a similar behaviour is obvious for the black curves in both lower plots in fig .",
    "[ fig : lslog ] .    such features might already be used to discriminate between different models and the parameters of the source . on the other hand ,",
    "such small deviations from a simple power - law might be hard to detect , since very precise sampling is necessary to confirm the powers and the breaks .",
    "current x - ray and @xmath0-ray observatories are not able to measure with the necessary precision .",
    "the behaviour of the retarded light curves beyond the lct matches , as stated before , the unretarded one quite well , which is expected , since the retardation becomes increasingly unimportant .",
    "however , as is obvious in fig .",
    "[ fig : lslin ] , the light curves are still influenced a bit by the retardation , since the numerical curve is slightly delayed compared to the analytical one .",
    "this is reasonable , since a small delay will always be present due to the finite extension of the emission region .",
    "this is most obvious in the linear plots , which cover only a narrow time range around the lct .",
    "the analytical results leave this retardation effect aside .",
    "the delay of the exponential cut - off of the black analytical curve in the right plots of fig .",
    "[ fig : lslog ] is due to the approximation to use the exponential cut - off of the early time limit ( @xmath167 ) also beyond the crossover time @xmath137 .",
    "since the exponential cut - off of the early time limit is less severe than the one of the late time limit , the analytical curve cuts off slower than the numerical and the unretarded curve .    comparing the plots for low ( left plots ) and high ( right plots ) values of the injection parameter @xmath364 clear differences become obvious .",
    "first of all , since the cooling time @xmath366 is much reduced in the @xmath367 case , the unretarded light curves are variable on shorter time scales than the light curves for @xmath368 .",
    "the variability time scales of the unretarded light curve have direct consequences on the retarded light curves as discussed above .",
    "thus , only by increasing @xmath364 , the behaviour of the light curves is completely altered .",
    "for example in the top plots of fig .",
    "[ fig : lslog ] , the blue curve exhibits the break at earlier times ( that is to say , after a shorter flare duration ) , the green curve cuts off at the lct , the exponential cut - off of the red curve takes place an order of magnitude earlier , and temporal shape of the black curve exhibits a clear deviation form the @xmath20 case .",
    "these examples show that the non - linear , time - dependent ssc cooling significantly shortens and alters the flare duration while most of the input parameters are unchanged .",
    "such short temporal variability would normally be explained with higher electron energies , which also shortens the variability time ( see lower plots on fig .",
    "[ fig : lslog ] ) , but which would not change the temporal appearance apart from retardation effects ( c.f . left plots in fig .",
    "[ fig : lslog ] ) .      figs .",
    "[ fig : lelog ] and [ fig : lelin ] display the logarithmic and linear plots of the ec light curves , respectively . in order to decrease the variability time from the top plots to the lower ones we increase the external compton parameter @xmath36 instead of the electron lorentz factor @xmath369 .",
    "interestingly , apart from specific temporal shapes of the light curves , the behaviour of the ec light curves are remarkably similar to the ssc case . before the lct",
    "the light curves are dominated by the retardation and the geometry , while the cut - off of the unretarded light curves might cause a break in the retarded light curve . beyond the lct the shape of the unretarded light curves",
    "is recovered , although the mentioned delay of the numerical light curve is also evident here ( especially in fig .",
    "[ fig : lelin ] ) .",
    "the sharp cut - off of the light curves is due to the soft photon field used for the inverse compton scattering .",
    "as mentioned in section [ sec : app ] , the soft external photon field is assumed to be monochromatic with normalized energy @xmath39 .",
    ", which is in the uv range near the ly@xmath370-line , implying the inverse compton process to be in the thompson limit ] thus , one can expect a different temporal shape of the ec light curve compared to the ssc case , where the broad ( non - thermal ) synchrotron emission is scattered .",
    "having discussed the temporal shapes of the ssc and ec light curves separately , we now focus on some general aspects , which are even true for the synchrotron light curves calculated by zs .",
    "it is a general feature of all cases that for high energies , where the unretarded light curve cuts off long before the lct , the retarded light curves exhibit lower maximum fluxes than the unretarded light curves .",
    "however , we expect photon number conservation , implying that the same number of photons is emitted by the source ( this might be different when taking into account photon - photon absorption ) .",
    "the retardation merely causes the photons to be observed over longer time scales , since the slices contribute at different times to the observed emission , while the overall produced number of photons is the same as without retardation . since for low energies the maximum of the light curve , and thus the bulk of photon emission is beyond the lct the photon numbers",
    "should also be conserved .",
    "the delay due to retardation has consequences also for the observed spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , since snapshots of the sed at different times will show a flux at an energy where , if retardation is not taken into account , no flux should be detected .",
    "the total seds ( that is , integrated over the entire flare ) should therefore not be affected by the retardation .",
    "the earlier cut - off of the high energies for high @xmath364 in the unretarded light curves causes the retarded light curves to exhibit lower photon fluxes compared to the low @xmath364 case .",
    "this flux reduction for high energies can also be seen in the seds , where an additional break appears , which strongly depends on the value of @xmath364 ( see schlickeiser et al . , 2010 ; zacharias & schlickeiser , 2012a ; 2012b ) .",
    "both breaks in the sed and flux reduction in the light curve are due to more intense electron energy losses of the non - linear , time - dependent ssc cooling .",
    "the light curves presented in this theoretical investigation have some features that are interesting for observational purposes .",
    "if multi - wavelength light curves are available , the combination should give some clues regarding the parameters of the source .",
    "since both sed and light curves must in principle be fit with the same set of parameters , the light curves serve as a test for the parameters usually deduced from sed modelling .",
    "the variability time scale observed in the light curves is generally equalled with the lct .",
    "this is true for higher energies , and can be discriminated if some of the higher energy light curves peak at roughly the same time .",
    "the maximum of lower energy light curves will occur at increasingly later times .",
    "however , this also depends on the injection energy of the electrons .",
    "hence , if most light curves are close to the lct , the initial electron energy is high , while for light curves peaking significantly later than the lct the electron energy is low .",
    "this interpretation is , however , not directly applicable , since the non - linear ssc cooling might decrease the variability times , too .",
    "as stated above , well sampled light curves might be used to discriminate between the high and low @xmath364 cases , since the temporal shape of the light curves is altered . that this is difficult with current instruments and observations has been stated above as well , but might be less an issue if very detailed light curves with very precise time binning should become available .",
    "the lct can be further deduced from the symmetry of the light curves around their maximum . without going into details",
    ", the light curves cutting off at the lct are symmetric around the maximum , meaning that the times from half the maximum to the maximum and down again to half the maximum are roughly equally long . for the synchrotron and the ssc light curves for maxima occurring beyond the lct the decay time is longer than the rising time .",
    "hence , in such cases the light curves are skewed towards earlier times ( c.f .",
    "[ fig : lslin ] ) .",
    "for the ec light curve , most likely due to the simple assumption of line - like soft target photons , the decay time is shorter than the rising time , and the light curves are skewed towards later times ( c.f .",
    "[ fig : lelin ] ) .",
    "thus , a symmetric light curve implies that the maximum is close to the lct , while an asymmetric light curve belongs to a maximum beyond the lct .    to conclude ,",
    "the theoretical investigations outlined in this paper have clearly shown , again , that rapid blazar flares might be explained by the non - linear , time - dependent ssc process , and that significantly different features arise in the ssc and ec light curves compared to the purely linear cooling case .",
    "explaining very short flares with a non - equilibrium , single injection model seems a viable alternative to the standard equilibrium models .",
    "furthermore , with the assumption of very small emission regions , the non - linear ssc process would be favoured over the linear - only models ( c.f .",
