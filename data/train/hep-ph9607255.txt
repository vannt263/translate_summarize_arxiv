    "one constructs @xmath5 for arbitrary invariant mass , @xmath6 , by means of cutkosky s rule @xcite , which is a corollary of @xmath7-matrix unitarity . in the second step , appealing to analyticity , one derives @xmath8 by integrating @xmath5 over @xmath9 according to a suitable dr .",
    "dispersive techniques offer both technical and physical advantages . within perturbation theory ,",
    "they allow us to reduce two - loop calculations to standard one - loop problems plus phase - space and dr integrations , which can sometimes be performed analytically even if massive particles are involved @xcite .",
    "this procedure can also be iterated to tackle three - loop problems @xcite . on the other hand , dispersive methods",
    "can often be applied where perturbation theory is unreliable . to this end ,",
    "one exploits the fact that , by virtue of the optical theorem , the imaginary parts of the loop amplitudes are related to total cross sections , which may be determined experimentally as a function of @xmath9 .",
    "perhaps , the best - known example of this kind in electroweak physics is the estimation of the light - quark contributions to the photon vacuum polarization  and thus to @xmath10based on experimental data of @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "this type of analysis may be extended both to higher orders in qed @xcite and to a broader class of electroweak parameters @xcite .",
    "these lecture notes are organized as follows . in section  2 , we derive dr s appropriate for physical amplitudes .",
    "cutkosky s rule is introduced in section  3 . as an elementary application",
    ", we calculate , in section  4 , the leptonic contribution to the photon vacuum polarization to lowest order in perturbation theory , and relate its hadronic contribution to the total cross section of @xmath12 . in section  5 ,",
    "we derive , from a ward identity , a subtraction prescription for general vacuum polarizations . in section  6 ,",
    "we evaluate , via a dr , the @xmath0 vertex form factor generated by the exchange of a massive vector boson between the two fermion legs . in section  7",
    ", we outline the application of dr s at the two - loop level , considering the bosonic decay width of a high - mass higgs boson .",
    "in elementary particle physics , we often encounter form factors ( _ i.e. _ , functions of @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is some transferred four - momentum ) which are real - valued for @xmath13 below some threshold , @xmath15 , and exhibit a branch cut for @xmath16 .",
    "we shall discuss various examples of form factors in sections  47 . in order to benefit from the powerful theorems available from the theory of complex functions , it is necessary to allow for @xmath13 to be complex , although this may contradict the nave physical intuition .",
    "let us then consider a complex - valued function , @xmath17 , of complex argument , @xmath9 , and assume that : ( 1 ) @xmath17 is real for real @xmath18 ; ( 2 ) @xmath17 has a branch cut for real @xmath19 ; ( 3 ) @xmath17 is analytic for complex @xmath9 ( except along the branch cut ) . as usual",
    ", we fix the sign of the absorptive ( imaginary ) part of @xmath20 along the branch cut by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is infinitesimal . by schwartz reflection principle",
    ", we then have @xmath23 since @xmath20 is analytic at each point @xmath13 within contour @xmath24 depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we may apply cauchy s theorem to find @xmath25 where we have employed eq .",
    "( [ eqsch ] ) in the last step .",
    "suppose that we only know @xmath26 along the branch cut and wish to evaluate @xmath20 at some point @xmath13 .",
    "then , eq .  ( [ eqdis ] )",
    "is not useful for our purposes , since @xmath20 also appears on the right - hand side , under the integral along the circle .",
    "thus , our aim is to somehow get rid of the latter integral .",
    "if @xmath27 then we obtain the unsubtracted dr @xmath28 this means that @xmath20 can be reconstructed at any point @xmath13 from the knowledge of its absorptive part along the branch cut . in particular , the dispersive ( real ) part of @xmath20 may be evaluated from @xmath29 where @xmath30 denotes the principal value .",
    "equation  ( [ eqcon ] ) is not in general satisfied .",
    "it is then useful to subtract from eq .",
    "( [ eqdis ] ) its value at some real point @xmath31 , @xmath32 if the last term in eq .",
    "( [ eqsub ] ) vanishes for @xmath33 , then we have the once - subtracted dr @xmath34 otherwise , further subtractions will be necessary .",
    "for the use of dr s in connection with dimensional regularization , we refer to ref .",
    "in the previous section , we explained how to obtain the dispersive part of a form factor from its absorptive part .",
    "here , we outline a convenient method how to evaluate the absorptive part within perturbation theory .    decomposing the scattering matrix as @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the transition matrix",
    ", we obtain @xmath37 from the unitarity property @xmath38 . since four - momentum is conserved in the transition from some initial state @xmath3 to some final state @xmath4 , we may always write @xmath39 consequently , @xmath40 inserting a complete set of intermediate states @xmath41 , we find @xmath42 using eqs .",
    "( [ eqt])([eqtt ] ) in connection with eq .",
    "( [ equni ] ) and peeling off the overall delta function , we obtain cutkosky s rule , @xmath43 where it is understood that the sum runs over all kinematically allowed intermediate states and includes phase - space integrations and spin summations . appealing to time - reversal invariance , we may identify the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eqcut ] ) with @xmath44 . in summary",
    ", we may construct the absorptive part of a loop diagram according to the following recipe : ( 1 ) cut the loop diagram in all kinematically possible ways into two pieces so that one of them is connected to @xmath3 and the other one to @xmath4 , where cut lines correspond to real particles ; ( 2 ) stitch each pair of pieces together by summing over the spins of the real particles and integrating over their phase space ; ( 3 ) sum over all cuts .",
    "one of the most straightforward applications of cutkosky s rule and dr s is to evaluate the one - loop photon vacuum polarization induced by fermions .",
    "to avoid possible complications due to large nonperturbative qcd corrections , we start by considering leptons . for the sake of generality , we keep the electric charge , @xmath45 , and the number of colours , @xmath46 , arbitrary .      given the qed interaction lagrangian , @xmath47 , we wish to compute @xmath2 depicted in fig .",
    "we start from the cut amplitudes , @xmath48 summation over spins yields @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the fermion mass and @xmath51 . defining @xmath52 , eq .",
    "( [ eqcut ] ) takes the from @xmath53 where @xmath54 is sommerfeld s fine - structure constant and @xmath55 upon integration , @xmath56 is the only four - momentum left , so that we can make the ansatz @xmath57 . in order to determine @xmath58 and @xmath59",
    ", we form the lorentz scalars @xmath60 we so find @xmath61 , so that @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the absorptive part of the photon vacuum polarization .",
    "notice that the dot product of @xmath2 with @xmath56 vanishes in compliance with electromagnetic gauge invariance . using the once - subtracted dr ( [ eqonc ] ) with @xmath64",
    ", we obtain the renormalized photon vacuum polarization as @xmath65 where @xmath66 appropriate for @xmath67 .",
    "this agrees with the well - known result found in dimensional regularization @xcite .",
    "representations of @xmath68 appropriate for @xmath69 and @xmath70 emerge from eq .",
    "( [ eqf ] ) through analytic continuation .",
    "specifically , we have @xmath71 we verify that , for @xmath70 , eq .  ( [ eqimp ] ) is recovered from eq .",
    "( [ eqpih ] ) .",
    "the expansions of @xmath68 for @xmath72 and @xmath73 read @xmath74 respectively . from eq .",
    "( [ eqlim ] ) , we conclude that heavy fermions , with mass @xmath75 , decouple from qed @xcite , while light fermions , with @xmath76 , generate large logarithmic corrections .",
    "the latter point creates a principal problem for the estimation of the hadronic contribution to @xmath77 .",
    "the evaluation of eq .",
    "( [ eqpih ] ) using the poorly known light - quark masses , @xmath78 , would suffer from large uncertainties proportional to @xmath79 .",
    "in addition , there would be large nonperturbative qcd corrections in connection with the subtraction term @xmath80 . in the next section",
    ", we discuss an elegant way to circumvent this problem .",
    "let us consider the creation of a quark pair by @xmath1 annihilation via a virtual photon , @xmath81 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath36-matrix element reads @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 is given in eq .",
    "( [ eqtni ] ) . taking into account the @xmath85 spin average and the flux factor",
    ", we evaluate the total cross section as @xmath86 where we have exploited eq .",
    "( [ eqimt ] ) . substituting eq .",
    "( [ eqsig ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eqpih ] ) , we obtain @xmath87 equation  ( [ eqhad ] ) allows us to estimate the hadronic contribution to @xmath77 from the total cross section of hadron production by @xmath1 annihilation measured as a function of @xmath9 .",
    "a recent analysis @xcite has yielded @xmath88 .",
    "vacuum polarizations have mass dimension two , so that the unsubtracted dr ( [ equns ] ) in general leads to ultraviolet divergences quadratic in the cutoff @xmath89 , which violate the ward identities of the theory and are not removed by renormalization .",
    "it is therefore necessary to use a subtraction . as we have seen in section  3 , in the case of qed , the nave subtraction of eq .",
    "( [ eqsub ] ) with @xmath64 leads to the correct physical result . in the presence of unconserved currents , as in the standard model ,",
    "the situation is more complicated @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we discuss a suitable subtraction prescription @xcite .",
    "starting from the general interaction lagrangian @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is some vector field and @xmath92 is the associated current , it is straightforward to derive the vacuum - polarization tensor , which , by convention , differs from the @xmath36-matrix element of @xmath93 by a minus sign , as @xmath94 where @xmath36 denotes the time - ordered product . by lorentz covariance , @xmath95 has the decomposition @xmath96 where @xmath83 . integrating by parts , we obtain from eq .",
    "( [ eqcor ] ) @xmath97 where the last step follows from lorentz covariance . on the other hand , from eq .",
    "( [ eqdec ] ) we get @xmath98 $ ] . consequently , we have @xmath99    by its definition ( [ eqcor ] ) , @xmath100 has mass dimension two , so that its evaluation from @xmath101 via the unsubtracted dr ( [ equns ] ) would be quadratically divergent .",
    "however , eq .  ( [ eqpdl ] ) relates @xmath100 to quantities for which unsubtracted dr s are only logarithmically divergent .",
    "this is obvious for @xmath102 , which is dimensionless . in the case of @xmath103 ,",
    "this may be understood by observing that @xmath92 is softly broken by mass terms and that one power of the external four - momentum is extracted in eq .",
    "( [ eqdel ] ) . writing unsubtracted dr s for @xmath103 and @xmath102 , we find @xmath104\\nonumber\\\\ & { \\hspace*{-2.5mm}}={\\hspace*{-2.5mm}}&\\frac{1}{\\pi}\\int_{m^2}^{\\lambda^2}ds^\\prime \\left[\\frac{{\\mathop{{\\mbox{im}}}\\nolimits}\\pi(s^\\prime)}{s^\\prime - s - i\\epsilon } + { \\mathop{{\\mbox{im}}}\\nolimits}\\lambda(s^\\prime)\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the lowest threshold .",
    "detailed inspection at @xmath105 and @xmath106 @xcite reveals that the logarithmic divergences of eq .",
    "( [ eqks ] ) exhibit a similar structure as the poles in @xmath107 found in @xmath108-dimensional regularization , so that both methods lead to the same physical results .",
    "cutkosky s rule ( [ eqcut ] ) is also applicable if the initial and final states are different . as an example",
