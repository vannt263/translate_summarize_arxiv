    "quantum impurity models , describing a discrete degree of freedom coupled to a continuous bath of excitations , arise in many different contexts in condensed matter physics . in particular , they are relevant for the description of transport through quantum dots and of qubits coupled to a dissipative environment @xcite . in recent years , there has been increasing interest in studying the real - time dynamics of such models for hamiltonians @xmath1 that are explicitly time - dependent , as relevant , for example , to describe external manipulations being performed on a qubit . it is thus important to develop reliable numerical tools that are able to deal with such problems under very general conditions .",
    "the most widely used numerical method to study quantum impurity systems is wilson s numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) @xcite . with the recently proposed time - dependent nrg ( td - nrg ) @xcite one can now calculate certain class of time - dependent problems where a sudden perturbation is applied to the impurity at time @xmath2 .",
    "td - nrg may very well be accurate for arbitrary long time",
    ". however , up to now , td - nrg is not capable of dealing with a hamiltonian @xmath1 with a time - dependence more general than a single abrupt change in model parameters at @xmath2 .",
    "we will show in this paper that the adaptive time - dependent density matrix renormalization group method ( t - dmrg ) is a promising candidate for treating a general time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath1 .",
    "the density matrix renormalization group method ( dmrg ) is traditionally a numerical method to study the low lying states of one - dimensional quantum systems @xcite .",
    "the recent extension of this method , the adaptive time - dependent dmrg ( t - dmrg ) @xcite , can simulate real - time dynamics of one - dimensional models with time - dependent hamiltonians as well .",
    "t - dmrg has already been used to study problems involving real - time dynamics of one - dimensional quantum systems , for example the far - from - equilibrium states in spin-1/2 chains @xcite , dynamics of ultracold bosons in an optical lattice @xcite , transport through quantum dots @xcite , dynamics of quantum phase transition @xcite , and demonstration of spin charge separation @xcite .",
    "these works showed that t - dmrg is a versatile and powerful method to study the real - time dynamics of one - dimensional quantum systems .",
    "the underlying mathematical structures of dmrg and nrg are similar in the matrix product state representation language @xcite .",
    "indeed , once a quantum impurity model has been transformed into the form of a wilson chain model , it can be treated by dmrg instead of nrg @xcite .",
    "this possibility opens the door toward studying time - dependent quantum impurity models using t - dmrg . in this paper",
    ", we take a first step in this direction by using t - dmrg to study a simple , exactly solvable quantum impurity model whose hamiltonian is a function of time .",
    "this model allows us to benchmark the performance of t - dmrg by comparing its results to those of the exact solution .",
    "we study the resonant - level model with a time - dependent potential applied to the level . the hamiltonian is @xmath3 @xmath4 creates a spinless fermion on the level ( impurity ) and @xmath5 creates a spinless fermion with momentum @xmath6 in a conduction band whose density of states is constant between @xmath7 and @xmath8 and zero otherwise , with fermi energy set equal to 0 . the energy of the local band is swept linearly with time , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the sweeping rate in units of the half band width @xmath8 .",
    "this model is equivalent to the dissipative landau - zener model with a ohmic boson bath whose spectral function is @xmath11 , for @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the high energy cutoff @xcite , and the dimensionless strength of dissipation parameter @xmath14 is henceforth set equal to @xmath15 .",
    "when @xmath14 is close but not equal to @xmath15 , the hamiltonian ( 1 ) contains an additional interaction term proportional to @xmath16 @xcite , but this case will not be considered here .    at time",
    "@xmath17 the local level contains a spinless fermion and the band is half filled .",
    "then , we lift the energy of the level linearly with time .",
    "as the level approaches the band , the probability that the fermion jumps to and from the band will increase , and decrease after the level has passed the band . in this paper",
    "we study this problem in detail .",
    "in particular , we are interested in the expectation value of the occupation number on the level @xmath0 at time @xmath18 .    before using t - dmrg to solve this problem",
    ", we need to transform the hamiltonian to a dmrg - friendly form .",
    "this can be realized by using a standard wilson mapping ( originally invented in the context of nrg ) , which include two steps : logarithmic discretization of the band and converting the hamiltonian to a hopping form @xcite . here",
    ", we just give the final result : the hamiltonian  ( [ horiginal ] ) is mapped to a semi - infinite wilson chain @xmath19 where @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21 is the hybridization parameter , and @xmath22 is the density of states at the fermi level .",
    "@xmath23 is a logarithmic discretization parameter , which means we divide the band into discrete energy intervals determined by @xmath24 . in the limit @xmath25 ,",
    "the discretized spectrum becomes dense throughout the band .",
    "the hopping factors in hamiltonian  ( [ hwillsion ] ) decrease exponentially , so it is sufficient to keep the first @xmath26 sites to achieve an energy resolution of @xmath27 .",
    "the dimensionless parameter @xmath28 can be used to define three typical regimes of this problem .",
    "they are :    * _ fast sweep _ : @xmath29 * _ intermediate sweep _ : @xmath30 * _ slow sweep _ : @xmath31    we will examine the performance of dmrg in all these regimes .    the wilson - chain form of hamiltonian  ( [ hwillsion ] ) can now be treated using dmrg .",
    "we first use infinite and finite dmrg @xcite to calculate the ground state of the initial hamiltonian @xmath32 at @xmath33 .",
    "this ground state is a very good approximation to the true initial state in the ideal case in which the level would start from @xmath34 as long as @xmath35 . in the fast and intermediate sweep regimes , we can choose @xmath33 so that the @xmath36 is far below the fermi surface to satisfy @xmath35 .",
    "in slow sweep regime we can do the same if we use a very large @xmath37 .",
    "however , a more efficient way we adopt is to use a moderate @xmath33 , but set @xmath38 as a very low value ( e.g. @xmath39 ) .",
    "after we get the starting state we apply the evolution operator @xmath40 on the starting state @xmath41 to get the state @xmath42 at time @xmath18 using t - dmrg : @xmath43 here @xmath44 is the time - ordering operator , and we set @xmath45 in this paper .    more specifically , we first divide the time interval @xmath18 into a series of tiny time steps of the length @xmath46 . the hamiltonian is a function of time , but in each tiny time step it can be approximated by a constant , so we have @xmath47    we chose the the value of hamiltonian in the middle of each interval to represent the hamiltonian of that interval . at every time step",
    "we decompose @xmath48 into local operators using second order suzuki - trotter decomposition , and we get @xmath49}\\nonumber \\\\               & = & e^{-i   \\frac{\\tau}{2 } \\hat{h}_{d,0}(s)}e^{-i   \\frac{\\tau}{2 } \\hat{h}_{0,1 } } e^{-i   \\frac{\\tau}{2 } \\hat{h}_{1,2}}\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\cdots e^{-i \\frac{\\tau}{2 } \\hat{h}_{l-1,l}}e^{-i \\frac{\\tau}{2 } \\hat{h}_{l-1,l}}\\cdots \\nonumber \\\\ & & e^{-i   \\frac{\\tau}{2 } \\hat{h}_{1,2}}e^{-i   \\frac{\\tau}{2 } \\hat{h}_{0,1 } } e^{-i \\frac{\\tau}{2 } \\hat{h}_{d,0}}+o(\\tau^3),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 and @xmath51 is the hopping term involving site @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the only time - dependent part of the hamiltonian is the impurity , so we only need to update the suzuki - trotter term of the impurity and the first site of the wilson chain @xmath54 at every time step .",
    "we can also easily extend this method to study finite temperature dynamics . instead of using infinite and finite dmrg to find the starting state , we use finite - temperature dmrg @xcite to get the starting state .",
    "then , one can evolve this purified state using t - dmrg to simulate the real - time dynamics at finite temperature @xcite . in this paper , however , we only focus on the zero temperature and noninteracting case .",
    "the hamiltonian  ( [ hwillsion ] ) is of quadratic form , so we can write it as @xmath55 where @xmath56 , @xmath57 .",
    "@xmath1 is a @xmath58 hermitian matrix with @xmath26 being the length of the wilson chain .    by diagonalizing @xmath59",
    "we get @xmath60 the @xmath6-th single particle state is @xmath61 where @xmath62 are the eigenvectors of @xmath59 , in the sense that @xmath63 .    at @xmath33",
    "the system is in its ground state , characterized by the single - particle distribution function @xmath64 the initial density matrix of the whole system is @xmath65 the density matrix evolves according to the von neumann equation @xmath66.\\ ] ] this equation can easily be solved with an ordinary differential equation solver such as matlab s ode45 .",
    "then we can calculate the expectation value of operators , like @xmath67 , as @xmath68= { \\rm tr}\\left[a^\\dagger_0 a_0 \\hat{\\rho}(t)\\right].\\ ] ]",
    "in fig .  [ 3regimes ] we plot both the exact and dmrg results in the three typical parameter regimes at zero temperature respectively .",
    "we use wilson - chain length @xmath69 and logarithmic discretization parameter @xmath70 for all the three figures .",
    "we will discuss the discretization method in more detail in the next section .",
    "note that we set @xmath71 in our calculation .",
    "for all three regimes , the dmrg error ( shown in fig .",
    "[ error ] for fast regime ) is at worst of order @xmath72 when keeping @xmath73 states during dmrg calculation .",
    "this error can be further reduced by increasing @xmath74 .",
    "[ cols= \" < \" , ]     with the physical picture described in the last section , we can also understand why there are artificial oscillations if @xmath75 is big .",
    "if we use a big logarithmic discretization parameter , the part of the band far away from the fermi level is poorly represented by only a few levels , which means that the oscillations from different levels do not average out as well as would have been the case for a true continuum of levels .",
    "we use logarithmic discretization instead of linear discretization because in the problem we studied , the levels near fermi surface contribute more than levels far away from it , and logarithmic discretization represents the part of band around fermi surface more efficiently .",
    "this is reflected in the convergence of the results with respect to the wilson - chain length @xmath26 shown in fig .",
    "[ discretization ] .",
    "as other parameters are the same , the two discretization methods will both converge to the same result when @xmath76 .",
    "therefore the faster the result converges the better the method is .",
    "we can see from fig .",
    "[ discretization ] ( b ) that the difference of @xmath0 between @xmath77 and @xmath69 chains is already negligible for the case of logarithmic discretization while still significant if using linear discretization , which means the results converge more quickly if we use logarithmic discretization .",
    "this is even more obvious by comparing the convergence speed of @xmath78 shown in fig .",
    "[ discretization](c ) .",
    "by studying a benchmark model we demonstrated that the t - dmrg is a very accurate method to calculate real - time dynamics of quantum impurity system with a time - dependent hamiltonian . to compare with the exact results ,",
    "the model we studied here is a non - interacting model , but dmrg can also treat interacting problems similarly .",
    "though t - dmrg can not calculate arbitrary long times ( in contrast to td - nrg ) it can give reliable results in a relatively long time which we expect to be long enough for numerous practical purposes .",
    "for example , in quantum information , where fast quantum processes are more useful , the relevant physics happens in a relatively short time scale , which can be simulated by t - dmrg with a high precision .",
    "we thus expect t - dmrg to be a powerful tool to study the real - time dynamics of quantum impurity systems , in particular in the context of modeling the dynamics of damped , driven qubits .",
