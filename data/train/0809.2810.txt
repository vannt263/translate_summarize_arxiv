    "type iin supernovae ( hereafter sne iin ) show narrow h@xmath1 emission line atop a broad emission feature , with no broad absorption .",
    "this classification was suggested by @xcite who noticed the above properties in 8 supernovae ( sne ) .",
    "the h@xmath1 and bolometric luminosities of most sne iin are large , which can be explained by the shock interaction of supernova ( sn ) ejecta with a very dense circumstellar ( cs ) gas @xcite .",
    "many sne iin also show an excess late time infrared emission , which is a signature of dense cs dust @xcite .",
    "cs interaction in sne is typically observed by radio and x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "however , in many cases , radio emission from sne iin has not been detected @xcite .",
    "one of the important issues for sne iin is their high presupernova mass loss rates .",
    "for example , for sn 1997ab the derived mass loss rate for a presupernova wind velocity of @xmath2 is @xmath3 @xcite . for sn",
    "1994w the mass loss rate was @xmath4 @xcite , and for sn 1995 g @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "one possibility for these high mass loss rates is that they are related to an explosive event a few years before the sn outburst @xcite .",
    "radio observations may put better constraints on the mass loss of the progenitor stars .",
    "sn 1995n was discovered in mcg @xmath602@xmath638@xmath6017 ( arp 261 ) on 1995 may 5 @xcite at a distance of 24 mpc ( see * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite estimated that the supernova was at least 10 months old upon discovery by comparing it with spectroscopic chronometers , and classified it as a type iin supernova .",

    "sn 1995n has declined very slowly in the optical band @xcite , with only a 2.5 mag change in the v - band over @xmath7 days after explosion .",
    "this is consistent with the slow spectral evolution reported in @xcite .",
    "ground based optical and hst observations of the late - time spectral evolution of sn 1995n were used by @xcite to argue that the late - time evolution is most likely powered by the x - rays from the interaction of the ejecta and the circumstellar medium of the progenitor .",
    "they in turn proposed that the progenitors of type iin supernovae are similar to red supergiants in their superwind phases , when most of their hydrogen - rich gas is expelled in the last @xmath8 before explosion .    in this paper , we report extensive radio observations of sn 1995n taken with the vla and gmrt .",

    "the radio emission in a sn is from the shocked interaction shell and is non - thermal synchrotron in nature . in the simplest models",
    ", it can initially be absorbed either by the internal medium due to synchrotron self absorption ( ssa ) or by the external medium through free - free absorption ( ffa ) , depending on the mass loss rate of the presupernova star , magnetic field in the shocked shells , density of the ejecta and the cs parameters .",
    "unfortunately , a clear distinction between the two absorption processes lies in the optically thick part of the light curve or spectrum , where the data for sn 1995n are quite sparse .",
    "therefore , before attempting detailed model fits , we try to extract information about both absorption processes from other wavebands .",
    "we can relate the free - free optical depth of the external medium to the hydrogen balmer line luminosity , which can be written as @xcite @xmath18 here , cgs units are used and we assume the electron temperature of the csm to be 20,000 k , deduced by @xcite using the optical narrow line emission for sn 1995n .",
    "the radius @xmath19 is the outer radius of the shock and @xmath20 is the csm density at a distance @xmath19 from the explosion center .",
    "@xcite estimate the sn h@xmath21 luminosity to be @xmath22 erg s@xmath23 .",

    "substituting @xmath24 erg s@xmath23 , this becomes @xmath27 here @xmath28 implies ffa optical depth derived from h@xmath21 luminosity .",

    "7 ) plot the peak radio luminosity vs the time of peak radio flux for various supernovae , marking the lines of constant shock velocity derived assuming ssa absorption process .",
    "if we place sn 1995n in this plot , it falls close to a velocity of 3000 km s@xmath23 .",
    "however , the optical line emission observations suggest ejecta velocities of at least 5000 km s@xmath23 @xcite",
    ". hence , the velocity of the radio - emitting region must be at least be equal to or greater than 5,000  km  s@xmath23 , an indication that ssa is not a significant factor in the the radio emission measured from sn  1995n .",
    "the h@xmath21 luminosity and the inferred expansion of the radio - emitting region suggest that ffa is the dominant radio absorption mechanism .",
    "we now fit the ffa model to the data .",
    "the model for ffa was given by @xcite and was formulated in detail by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the radio flux density , @xmath29 , under the ffa assumption can be written as : @xmath30 where @xmath1 is the frequency spectral index , which relates to electron energy index @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) as @xmath33 . to determine the value of @xmath1 , we plot spectral indices between 8.46 ghz and 4.86 ghz bands ( @xmath34 $ ] ) as well as between 4.86 ghz and 1.46 ghz bands ( @xmath35 $ ] ) at various epochs ( see fig [ fig : alpha ] ) . from fig .",
    "[ fig : full - lc ] , it is evident that the light curves becomes optically thin for these three bands after day @xmath36 .",
    "thus we average both @xmath37 and @xmath38 for all the values after day 2500 .",
    "the average spectral index is @xmath39 .",
    "hence , we use @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) in the radio absorption models . here",
    "@xmath42 is the radio flux density normalization parameter and @xmath43 is the ffa optical depth normalization parameter .",
    "the parameter @xmath44 is related to the expansion parameter @xmath45 in @xmath46 as @xmath47 .",
    "the assumption that the energy density in the particles and the fields is proportional to the postshock energy density leads to @xmath48 @xcite . for @xmath41",
    ", this becomes @xmath49 .",
    "using these values , we fit the sn 1995n radio data to eq .",
    "[ eq : ffa ] .",
    "the parameters for the best fit model are : @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 .",
    "the above fit parameters yield @xmath53 , and @xmath54 . in the cs interaction model of @xcite , the power law index of the supernova density profile , @xmath55 ,",
    "is related to @xmath45 by @xmath56 , so that the above value of @xmath45 implies @xmath57 .",
    "although our fits for the ffa model are reasonable , we try to fit other radio absorption models as well .",
    "we use the formulation of @xcite for the radio flux density with ssa present : @xmath58 here @xmath59 gives the time evolution of the radio flux density in the optically thick phase ( @xmath60 ) and @xmath61 in the optically thin phase ( @xmath62 ) . under the assumption that the energy density in the particles and the fields is proportional to the postshock energy density ,",
    "these quantities are related with expansion parameter @xmath45 and electron energy index @xmath31 as @xmath63 , and @xmath64 ( as before ) .",
    "the estimation of @xmath61 from the fits is expected to be robust because there are ample data points in the optically thin part of the light curve , whereas @xmath59 is determined by the optically thick regime and can not be constrained well due to sparse data in this region .",
    "here @xmath65 is the flux normalization parameter and @xmath66 is the ssa optical depth normalization parameter .",
    "the best fit model gives @xmath67 and @xmath68 . for @xmath41 ,",
    "the above value of @xmath61 corresponds to @xmath69 .",
    "the best fit value of @xmath59 corresponds to @xmath70 .",
    "however , @xmath59 is not well constrained by the data , so we fix it to a value of @xmath71 , corresponding to @xmath69 and fit the data again .",
    "the best fits in this case are : @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 .",
    "as expected , the evolution deduced during the optically thin case is similar to that found in the ffa model .",
    "we note that there are more complicated possibilities for the absorption , but our data are not sufficient to test them .",
    "in particular , @xcite found that the optically thick radio evolution of the type iin sn 1986j could not be fit by a model with external ffa , but could be fit by a model with internal ffa mixed with the synchrotron emitting region .",
    "such a model is plausible for sne iin , because of the evidence for clumping in the cs medium , but we can not test it here .",
    "although both ffa and ssa give acceptable fits due to the lack of data points in the optically thick regime , the ssa derived velocity and information using optical data suggest that ffa is the most relevant radio absorption process .",
    "we produce light curves ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] ) and spectra ( see fig . [",
    "fig : spectra ] ) for both ffa and ssa processes . in fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] , there is a sudden rise in the radio flux around day @xmath75 , plotted with grey dashed - dotted lines ; this is evident in all the frequency bands almost at the same time .",
    "this effect can also be see in the spectra on days 1440 and 1812 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] ) .",
    "we speculate that this feature is due to a density enhancement in the csm .",
    "however , if the time decay @xmath21 is somewhat shallower at the early epoch , and there is a steepening in @xmath21 at later epochs , this may also cause such a bump in the light curves .",
    "such time evolution in @xmath21 has been seen for sn 1993j and a few other supernovae @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to distinguish between the two possibilities in view of the sparse data .",
    "sn 1995n was extensively observed in many wavebands of the electromagnetic spectrum . we will utilize this information and derive constraints on various physical parameters of sn 1995n .",
    "if ffa is the dominant absorption process , we can estimate the mass - loss rate of the progenitor star before it underwent the explosion phase using the radio data .",

    "uncertainties in the ejecta velocity , electron temperature and wind velocity introduce more uncertainty in the mass loss rate estimation .",
    "in addition , equation ( [ eq : massloss ] ) is based on the assumption that the absorbing wind gas is smoothly distributed",
    ". however , @xcite found that the density of ionized gas obtained from line diagnostics is higher than would be expected for smoothly distributed gas .",
    "with clumping , there is less matter for the same amount of absorption and the mass loss rate is reduced .",

    "having an estimate for the mass loss rate and the density profile index , one can estimate the temperatures in the shocked circumstellar shell and the reverse shocked shell .",

    "@xcite estimate the electron density of the reverse shocked shell to be @xmath98 @xmath25 .",
    "the density of the shocked csm shell is thus @xmath99 @xmath25 .",
    "this gives the estimates for equipartition time scales in the reverse shocked and the forward shocked shells as @xmath100 days and 1007.5 days , respectively .",
    "hence , at the time of _ chandra _ and xmm observations , the epoch at which the above parameters are derived , both the shocked shells have most likely attained electron - ion equilibrium .",
    "a useful way to characterize the radio emission from supernovae is by considering their peak radio luminosity and time of the peak ; the more luminous type ii supernovae peak at a later time , indicating that they have a denser circumstellar medium @xcite .",
    "in such a plot , sn 1995n is close to the type iil sn 1979c and type iin sn 1978k , but is less luminous that the type iin sne 1986j and 1988z @xcite .",

    "the same value of @xmath55 is consistent with the x - ray properties of sn 1995n .",
    "although there are clear indications of early low frequency absorption in the radio light curves of sn 1995n , there is little information on the evolution during the optically thick phase so that the nature of the absorption can not be deduced from the radio light curves .",
    "based on the emission measure of the gas deduced from optical observations and the late peak radio luminosity , we infer that free - free absorption is the likely absorption mechanism .",
    "the implied mass loss rate for the supernova progenitor is @xmath103 , but this value has a number of uncertainties . the assumed velocity of the radio emitting region is @xmath104 km s@xmath23 ; however , there are some indications from the h@xmath1 line that there are higher velocities @xcite , which would lead to a higher value of @xmath105 .",
    "the assumed wind velocity of 10 km s@xmath23 is lower than has been inferred from the narrow h@xmath1 lines observed in some sne iin , e.g. , 90 km s@xmath23 in sn 1997ab @xcite , 160 km s@xmath23 in sn 1997eg @xcite , and 100 km s@xmath23 in sn 2002ic @xcite .",
    "an order of magnitude increase in @xmath106 would increase @xmath105 by an order of magnitude .",

    "regardless of the uncertainty in @xmath105 , the values deduced for sne iin from optical observations listed in   1 are significantly larger than the value deduced for sn 1995n . in some of those cases , the mass loss may be a short lived event before the supernova .",
    "the long time coverage of sn 1995n , especially at radio wavelengths , shows that the circumstellar gas is extended in this case , out to radii @xmath107 cm .",
