    "since the dawn of quantum information theory its development has been guided by the findings of classical information theory .",
    "indeed , some key quantum information concepts including early entanglement distillation protocols @xcite , quantum error correction @xcite and some fundamental quantum information inequalities @xcite , appeared initially as nontrivial translations of their classical counterparts into the language of quantum states .",
    "naturally , the further independent development of quantum information theory has led to the emergence of concepts with no analogy in classical theory .",
    "this category includes , for instance , bound entanglement @xcite , entanglement distribution by separable states @xcite and superactivation of entanglement @xcite .",
    "it is not surprising then , that the opposite effect occurred when quantum information started to enrich classical information theory with new concepts such as bound information @xcite , secrecy distribution by non - secret correlations @xcite and a classical analogy to superactivation @xcite .",
    "classical analogies of quantum phenomena are almost exclusively cryptographic analogies of some properties of quantum entanglement .",
    "entanglement is the key resource in quantum information and it is synonymous with correlations among two or more quantum systems which can not be prepared by local operations and classical communication ( locc ) .",
    "the cryptographic parallels of entanglement properties are carried by classical probability distributions containing so called secret correlations @xcite .",
    "the correlations are a fundamental resource in cryptography and appear in the scenario when two honest parties , alice and bob , and an adversary eve , share three correlated random variables @xmath0 and @xmath1 obeying a probability distribution @xmath2 .",
    "the distribution carries secret correlations if it is impossible for alice and bob to create the distribution by local operations and public communication @xcite . owing to the apparent similarity with entanglement",
    ", secret correlations can therefore be viewed as a classical analogy to entanglement @xcite .",
    "in fact , secret correlations and quantum entanglement are not just analogs but are directly linked as the latter can be mapped onto the former as follows @xcite .",
    "a third adversary party eve , seemingly missing in a quantum state @xmath3 , is associated with all information which could potentially be carried by a third system @xmath1 , i.e. , the global state @xmath4 of the tripartite system is a purification of the state @xmath3 ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "a given quantum state @xmath3 can then be mapped onto a probability distribution @xmath2 by performing measurements @xmath6 and @xmath7 on subsystems @xmath0 and @xmath1 of the purification as @xcite @xmath8 the presence of secret correlations in the obtained distribution can be certified with the help of the so - called intrinsic conditional information defined as @xcite @xmath9.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath10 is the mutual information between @xmath11 and @xmath12 conditioned on @xmath1 , where @xmath13 is the shannon entropy @xcite , and the minimization is performed over all channels @xmath14 characterized by a conditional probability distribution @xmath15 .",
    "the intrinsic information gives a lower bound to the information of formation @xcite quantifying the amount of secret bits @xcite needed for preparation of the distribution , and an upper bound to the rate at which a secret key can be distilled from the distribution @xcite in the secret - key agreement protocol @xcite .",
    "more importantly , the distribution @xmath2 contains secret correlations if and only if @xmath16 @xcite . moving back to the mapping ( [ mapping ] ) one",
    "can then show using intrinsic information ( [ intrinsici ] ) that provided that the state @xmath3 is entangled one can always find measurements @xmath17 such that the obtained distribution contains secret correlations @xcite .",
    "moreover , the multipartite form of the mapping ( [ mapping ] ) is even capable of mapping more subtle properties of entanglement such as its boundedness @xcite .",
    "so far , the mapping ( [ mapping ] ) has been investigated only from the point of view of the ability to transmit qualitative properties of quantum states onto classical probability distributions .",
    "a natural step forward would therefore be to elucidate whether the mapping can also preserve the quantitative properties of input states .",
    "specifically , it would be of interest to know whether there is a function of a probability distribution @xmath2 associated with a quantum state @xmath3 via mapping ( [ mapping ] ) which does not increase under any locc operation on the state .",
    "this would mean that the composition of the mapping and the function preserve the fundamental property that entanglement does not increase under locc operations .",
    "this is , however , important from a practical point of view because such a function then can be used to quantify entanglement @xcite .",
    "an interesting attempt to quantify entanglement with the mapping ( [ mapping ] ) has been put forward by gisin and wolf @xcite .",
    "they introduced the following optimized intrinsic information @xmath18\\right\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the supremum is taken over all projective measurements @xmath19 and @xmath20 on subsystems @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively , and the infimum is taken over all purifications @xmath21 of the state @xmath3 and all positive operator - valued measures ( povm ) @xmath22 on subsystem @xmath1 .",
    "further , in ref .  @xcite it was shown that the quantity ( [ muadd ] ) possesses some properties of an entanglement measure such as equality to the von neumann entropy on pure states and convexity , and it was also calculated analytically for two - qubit werner states .",
    "the quantity ( [ muadd ] ) is particularly interesting because unlike most of the other entanglement measures it is intimately related with a meaningful protocol ",
    "it is an upper bound in the secret - key agreement protocol @xcite .",
    "what is more , it may even characterize secret correlations distillable to a secret key provided that the conjectured bipartite nondistillable secret correlations with a strictly positive intrinsic information ( the so - called bipartite bound information @xcite ) do not exist .",
    "despite this fact , the other properties of entanglement measures have not been investigated for the quantity ( [ muadd ] ) but it inspired the introduction of a different measure called squashed entanglement @xcite .",
    "in particular , the key questions of whether the quantity ( [ muadd ] ) is non - increasing under locc operations and whether it can be calculated also for other quantum states remain open .    to find answers to the latter questions can be a hard or even intractable task owing to the apparent complexity of the quantity ( [ muadd ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , the quantity ( [ muadd ] ) can still inspire the introduction of a closely related quantity for which the proof of monotonicity under locc operations as well as its computation can be considerably easier .",
    "the quantity in question is the so - called _ intrinsic entanglement _ ( ie ) defined as @xcite @xmath23\\right\\}.\\ ] ] in comparison with the quantity ( [ muadd ] ) the order of optimization in the definition of ie is reversed and hence @xmath24 due to the max - min inequality @xcite .",
    "in fact , the two quantities may coincide if the intrinsic information ( [ intrinsici ] ) together with the sets @xmath25 and @xmath26 possess the strong max - min property @xcite which guarantees that the order of optimization in eq .",
    "( [ edownarrow ] ) can be commuted .",
    "the ref .",
    "@xcite further deals with a gaussian version of ie , the so - called gaussian intrinsic entanglement ( gie ) .",
    "the gie is defined as in eq .",
    "( [ edownarrow ] ) , where all channels @xmath14 in eq .",
    "( [ intrinsici ] ) , and all quantum states @xmath3 and @xmath21 , and measurements @xmath27 , @xmath28 , are assumed to be gaussian .",
    "it is further shown that gie simplifies considerably to the optimized mutual information of a distribution of outcomes of gaussian measurements on subsystems @xmath11 and @xmath12 of a conditional state obtained by a gaussian measurement on subsystem @xmath1 of a gaussian purification of the state @xmath3 .",
    "next , it is proved that gie vanishes if and only if the state @xmath3 is separable and that it does not increase under gaussian local trace - preserving operations and classical communication ( gltpocc ) .",
    "finally , some analytical formulae are obtained for gie as well as ie .",
    "first , gie is calculated analytically for pure gaussian states as well as for a two - mode reduction of the three - mode cv ghz sate @xcite and it is shown that it always coincides with the gaussian rnyi-2 ( gr2 ) entanglement @xcite .",
    "second , an analytical lower bound on ie is derived for a subset of the set of the non - gaussian continuous - variable werner states @xcite , which is given by convex mixtures of the two - mode squeezed vacuum state and the vacuum state .",
    "the present paper accompanies the original paper on gie @xcite .",
    "it contains details of proofs of the properties of gie presented in ref .",
    "additionally , we also provide two new results not mentioned in ref .",
    "first , we show that the monotonicity of gie under gltpocc implies the invariance of gie with respect to gaussian local unitaries .",
    "second , we prove that if we allow for non - gaussian measurements @xmath25 in the definition of gie we get a quantity which is on pure gaussian states equal to the entropy of entanglement in analogy with the quantifier ( [ muadd ] ) which is also equal to the entropy of entanglement for pure states @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec_0 ] contains a brief introduction into the formalism of gaussian states . in section  [ sec_1 ]",
    "we show explicitly that for gie the channel @xmath14 in eq .",
    "( [ intrinsici ] ) can be integrated into eve s measurement .",
    "the next section  [ sec_2 ] contains a proof that in the definition of gie ( [ edownarrow ] ) we can use a fixed purification and the minimization over all gaussian purifications can be omitted .",
    "section  [ sec_3 ] then presents the construction of a gaussian measurement which projects a gaussian purification of a separable gaussian state onto a product state and section  [ sec_4 ] is dedicated to a detailed proof of the monotonicity of gie under gltpocc operations .",
    "derivation of an analytical expression for gie and proof of its equality to gr2 entanglement is given for pure gaussian states in section  [ sec_5 ] and for the two - mode reduction of the three - mode cv ghz state in section  [ sec_6 ] .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec_7 ] we derive an analytical lower bound on ie for a subclass of the non - gaussian continuous - variable werner states .",
    "section  [ sec_8 ] contains conclusions .",
    "in this paper we consider quantum systems with infinite - dimensional hilbert state spaces which can be physically implemented by modes of the electromagnetic field .",
    "a system of @xmath29 modes can be conveniently described by a vector of quadratures @xmath30 whose components obey the canonical commutation rules @xmath31=i(\\omega_n)_{jk}$ ] with @xmath32 being the so - called symplectic matrix . according to definition , gaussian states are quantum states of modes , which possess a gaussian wigner function .",
    "an @xmath29-mode gaussian state @xmath33 is therefore fully characterized by a vector of first moments @xmath34 , and by a covariance matrix ( cm ) @xmath35 with entries @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the anticommutator .",
    "the quantity gie analyzed in this paper depends only on the elements of the cm and thus the vector of the first moments @xmath39 is from now assumed to be zero for simplicity .",
    "we use gaussian unitary operations which are for @xmath29 modes represented at the level of cms by a real @xmath40 symplectic matrix @xmath41 fulfilling @xmath42 .",
    "recall also , that any cm @xmath35 can be symplectically diagonalized , i.e. , there exists a symplectic matrix @xmath41 that brings @xmath35 to the williamson normal form @xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44 are the symplectic eigenvalues of @xmath35 .    as for measurements we restrict ourselves to gaussian measurements which can be implemented by appending auxiliary vacuum modes , using passive and active linear optics ( phase shifters , squeezers and beam splitters ) and homodyne detections .",
    "any such measurement on @xmath29 modes is described by the following povm @xcite @xmath45 where the seed element @xmath46 is a normalized density matrix of a generally mixed @xmath29-mode gaussian state with zero first moments and cm @xmath47 , @xmath48 is the displacement operator , and @xmath49 is a vector of measurement outcomes . from the normalization condition @xmath50=1 $ ] it follows that the povm ( [ povmn ] ) satisfies the completeness condition @xmath51 where @xmath52 .    in the present analysis of ie ,",
    "( [ edownarrow ] ) , we assume that the state @xmath53 is an @xmath54-mode gaussian state of @xmath55 modes @xmath56 and @xmath57",
    "modes @xmath58 , which is described by the cm @xmath59 .",
    "further , we also assume that @xmath60 is an @xmath61-mode gaussian purification of the state @xmath3 , which contains @xmath62 purifying modes @xmath63 , and which is described by the cm @xmath64 . by performing gaussian measurements ( [ povmn ] ) with covariance matrices ( cms ) @xmath65 and @xmath66 on subsystems @xmath0 and",

    "we assume that the channel @xmath14 in eq .",

    "such a channel is described by a linear transformation @xmath82 where @xmath83 is a fixed real @xmath84 matrix and @xmath85 is an @xmath80 random column vector distributed with a zero mean gaussian distribution characterized by an @xmath86 ccm @xmath87 with elements @xmath88 , @xmath89 .",

    "( [ sigma ] ) .",
    "the channel is therefore fully characterized by a joint gaussian distribution @xmath91 with zero mean and a ccm of the form @xmath92 the input gaussian distribution @xmath93 , eq .",
    "( [ pinput ] ) , is then transformed by the channel as @xmath94 where @xmath95 is a conditional gaussian probability distribution of the channel .",
    "we now substitute into the right - hand side ( rhs ) of eq .",
    "( [ ptilde ] ) for the distribution @xmath96 from eq .",
    "( [ pinput ] ) , which gives the output distribution ( [ ptilde ] ) in the form @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 where the matrices @xmath100 and @xmath101 are defined in eq .",

    "a natural question that then arises is whether ie can be calculated also for some non - gaussian states .",

    "therefore , in eq .",
    "( [ ielowerbound ] ) we can omit minimization with respect to all purifications and we can minimize only over single - qubit measurements on the fixed purification ( [ psiwerner ] ) . the latter minimization can be carried out with the help of the following upper bound on the classical mutual information @xcite @xmath921 where @xmath922 and @xmath923 are marginal von neumann entropies of the reduced states @xmath632 and @xmath924 , respectively , of subsystems @xmath11 and @xmath1 of the state ( [ psiwerner ] ) and @xmath925 is the quantum mutual information of the reduced state @xmath926 of the subsystem @xmath927 . from the purity of the state ( [ psiwerner ] )",

    "in this paper we gave a detailed analysis of the properties of gie , which is a new quantifier of bipartite gaussian entanglement introduced in ref .",
    "the gie is a gaussian version of a more general quantity ie which is a lower bound to the `` classical measure of entanglement '' @xcite obtained by commuting the order of optimization in the definition of ie .",

    "the gie boils down to the optimized mutual information of a distribution of outcomes of gaussian measurements on subsystems @xmath11 and @xmath12 of a conditional state obtained by a gaussian measurement on subsystem @xmath1 of a gaussian purification of the considered state .",
    "next , the simple form of gie enabled us to show that it satisfies some properties of a gaussian entanglement measure .",
    "for this purpose we have constructed for any gaussian separable state a gaussian purification and a gaussian measurement on the purifying part @xmath1 , which projects the state onto a product of states of subsystems @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",

    "first , making use of the result we have shown that if a gaussian state is separable then gie vanishes .",
    "second , combining the result with the realization of locc operations by teleportation with a separable shared state we have arrived to an important observation that gie does not increase under the gltpocc . in particular , the monotonicity property implies that gie is invariant with respect to all local gaussian unitary operations .",
    "finally , we have calculated analytically gie for two simple classes of two - mode gaussian states . for pure gaussian states",
    "gie is equal to the gr2 entanglement @xcite whereas equality to the entropy of entanglement is established provided that alice and bob are allowed to perform non - gaussian measurements .",
    "an analytical formula for gie has been also derived for one - parametric family of two - mode reductions of the three - mode cv ghz state , which was also found to be equal to the gr2 entanglement .",
    "last but not least , we have also extended our analysis of the proposed entanglement quantifier to a non - gaussian case by calculating a lower bound on ie for a particular subset of a set of two - mode continuous - variable werner states .",
    "the results obtained in the present paper rise several questions which remain open for further research .",
    "first , it is imperative to know , whether gie is monotonic under all ( including trace - decreasing ) glocc operations .",
    "if answered in affirmative , we could call gie a gaussian entanglement measure",
    ". another important question concerns computability of gie on other gaussian states .",
    "knowing gie for other gaussian states , one can then further investigate a rather surprising finding that gie and gr2 entanglement are equal on some gaussian states . a proof showing",
    "the equality of the two quantities on all bipartite gaussian states would link gr2 entanglement with the secret - key agreement protocol @xcite and what is more , this would also mean , that gie possesses all the properties of gr2 entanglement including , e.g. , monogamy .",
    "finally , gie is a faithful quantity @xcite which is nonzero on all entangled states and therefore it opens a possibility to quantify the amount of entanglement in gaussian bound entangled states @xcite .                                by public communication",
