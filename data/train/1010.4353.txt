    "in a recent paper @xcite two of us showed that the system of 60 rays derived from the vertices of a 600-cell could be used to give two new proofs of the bell - kochen - specker ( bks ) theorem @xcite ruling out the existence of noncontextual hidden variables theories . a later work @xcite presented several additional proofs based on the same set of rays .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to add to the store of proofs in @xcite , but , even more than that , to convey a feeling for the variety and flavor of the proofs ( both through the examples presented here and the far more extensive listing on the website @xcite ) and to show interested readers how many of the proofs can be obtained by simple constructions based on the geometry of the 600-cell .",
    "there are two aspects of the present proofs that make them noteworthy .",
    "the first is that they are all `` parity proofs '' ( this term is explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : parity - proof ] ) whose validity can be checked by simple counting . and",
    "the second is that there are about a hundred million of them in this 60-ray system . while many of the proofs are just replicas of each other under the symmetries of the 600-cell , the number of distinct proofs , in terms of size and other characteristics , is still fairly large ( we used a random exhaustive generation of proofs to obtain over 8,000 proofs , most of which turned out to be parity proofs  @xcite ) .",
    "the sheer profusion and variety of parity proofs contained in the 600-cell is unmatched by that in any other system we are aware of and motivated us to study this system in detail , both for its geometric interest as well as for its possible applications .",
    "a brief survey of earlier proofs of the bks theorem may be helpful in setting the present work in context .",
    "after kochen and specker @xcite first gave a finitary proof of their theorem using 117 directions in ordinary three - dimensional space , a number of authors gave alternative proofs in three @xcite , four @xcite and higher @xcite dimensions .",
    "some of the proofs in higher dimensions are much simpler than the three - dimensional proofs and , in fact , are examples of the `` parity proofs '' we discuss throughout this paper . in recent years",
    "there has been a resurgence of interest in the bks theorem as a result of the fruitful suggestion by cabello @xcite of how it might be experimentally tested .",
    "cabello s basic observation is that many proofs of the bks theorem based on a finite set of rays and bases can be converted into an inequality that must be obeyed by a noncontextual hidden variables theory but is violated by quantum mechanics .",
    "experimental tests of cabello - like inequalities have been carried out in four - level systems realized by ions @xcite , neutrons @xcite , photons @xcite and nuclear spins @xcite , and violations of the inequalities have been observed in all the cases .",
    "still other inequalities , some state - dependent and others not , that must be satisfied by noncontextual theories have been derived for qutrits @xcite , n - qubit systems @xcite and hypergraph models @xcite .",
    "it has been argued in @xcite that contextuality is the key feature underlying quantum nonlocality .",
    "a wide ranging discussion of the kochen - specker and other no - go theorems , as well as the subtle interplay between the notions of contextuality , nonlocality and complementarity , can be found in @xcite . aside from their foundational interest ,",
    "proofs of the bks theorem are useful in connection with protocols such as quantum cryptography @xcite , random number generation @xcite and parity oblivious transfer @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "[ sec : parity - proof ] reviews the bks theorem and explains what is meant by a `` parity proof '' of it .",
    "an explanation is also given of the notion of a `` basis - critical '' parity proof , since only such proofs are presented in this paper .",
    "[ sec : parity - overview ] introduces the system of 60 rays and 75 bases derived from the 600-cell that is the source of all the proofs presented in this paper .",
    "a notation is introduced for the ray - basis sets underlying the parity proofs , and an overview is given of all the parity proofs we were able to find in the 600-cell .",
    "the algorithm we used to search for the proofs is described , and a few of the proofs are displayed in a tabular form so that the reader can see how they work .",
    "an equivalent mckay - megill - pavicic ( mmp ) hypergraph representation @xcite is used to give the reader a graphical visualisation of some of the proofs . in an mmp",
    "hypergraph vertices correspond to rays and edges to tetrads of mutually orthogonal rays ( see figs .  [ fig:30 - 15-a - b ] and [ fig:3417 - 2613 ] ) . sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] summarizes the general features of the parity proofs and also points out their relevance for quantum key distribution and experimental disproofs of noncontextuality .",
    "the appendix reviews some basic geometrical facts about the 600-cell and shows how they can be used to give simple constructions for some of the parity proofs in table [ overview ] .",
    "space prevents us from discussing more than a handful of examples , but the ones chosen may help to convey some feeling for the rest .",
    "some virtues of the treatment in the appendix are ( a ) that it allows many of the proofs to be constructed `` by hand '' without the need to look up a compilation , ( b ) that it allows the number of replicas of a particular proof under the symmetries of the 600-cell to be determined , and ( c ) that it reveals close connections between different proofs that might otherwise appear to be unrelated .",
    "however the treatment in the appendix is not needed for an understanding of the main results of this paper and can be omitted by those not interested in it .",
    "this paper is written to be self - contained and can be read without any knowledge of our earlier work @xcite on this problem .",
    "the bks theorem asserts that in any hilbert space of dimension @xmath0 it is always possible to find a finite set of rays @xcite that can not each be assigned the value @xmath1 or @xmath2 in such a way that ( i ) no two orthogonal rays are both assigned the value 1 , and ( ii ) not all members of a basis , i.e. a set of @xmath3 mutually orthogonal rays , are assigned the value 0 .",
    "the proof of the theorem becomes trivial if one can find a set of @xmath4 rays in @xmath3 dimensions that form an odd number , @xmath5 , of bases in such a way that each ray occurs an even number of times among those bases .",
    "then the assignment of 0 s and 1 s to the rays in accordance with rules ( i ) and ( ii ) is seen to be impossible because the total number of 1 s over all the bases is required to be both odd ( because each basis must have exactly one ray labeled 1 in it ) and even ( because each ray labeled 1 is repeated an even number of times ) .",
    "any set of @xmath4 rays and @xmath5 bases that gives this even - odd contradiction furnishes what we call a `` parity proof '' of the bks theorem .",
    "let us denote a set of @xmath4 rays that forms @xmath5 bases a @xmath4-@xmath5 set .",
    "a @xmath4-@xmath5 set that yields a parity proof of the bks theorem will be said to be basis - critical ( or simply critical ) if dropping even a single basis from it causes the bks proof to fail .",
    "basis - criticality is not to be confused with ray - criticality , which takes all orthogonalities between rays into account and not just those in the limited set of bases considered .",
    "we focus on basis - criticality because it is more relevant to experimental tests of the kochen - specker theorem .",
    "such tests typically involve projective measurements that pick out whole sets of bases , and performing a test that corresponds to a basis - critical set is an efficient strategy because it involves no superfluous measurements . the only parity proofs exhibited in this paper",
    "are those that correspond to basis - critical sets .",
    "table [ tab : ray ] shows the 60 rays derived from the vertices of the 600-cell and table [ tab : basis ] the 75 bases ( of four rays each ) formed by them .",
    "each ray occurs in exactly five bases , with its 15 companions in these bases being the only other rays it is orthogonal to .",
    "thus table [ tab : basis ] ( or the `` basis table '' ) captures all the orthogonalities between the rays and is completely equivalent to their kochen - specker diagram .",
    ".the 60 rays of the 600-cell .",
    "the numbers following each ray are its components in an orthonormal basis , with @xmath6 , @xmath7 , a bar over a number indicating its negative and commas being omitted between components .",
    "the entries can also be regarded as coordinates of 60 of the vertices of a 600-cell , located on a sphere of radius 2 centered at the origin .",
    "the other 60 vertices are the antipodes of these . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]        one of us ( m. p. ) would like to thank his host hossein sadeghpour at itamp .",
    "m. p.s stay at itamp was supported by the us national science foundation through a grant for the institute for theoretical atomic , molecular , and optical physics ( itamp ) at harvard university and smithsonian astrophysical observatory and ministry of science , education , and sport of croatia through the project no .",

    "m. p. carried out his part of the computation on the cluster isabella of the university computing centre of the university of zagreb and on the croatian national grid infrastructure .",
    "( this site has a link to an excel file that lists many examples of the parity proofs in table 3 and also a link to a web application that shows many of these proofs in an easily visualized tabular form ) .",
    "we explain some aspects of our terminology for readers unfamiliar with the bks theorem . by a `` ray '' we mean an equivalence class of quantum states that differ from each other only by an overall phase . only orthogonalities between states play a role in the bks theorem , and since orthogonalities are unaffected by a change of phase , it is rays rather than states that are of relevance for the bks theorem .",
    "the bases are related to the projective measurements that one can carry out on the system .",
    "the projectors on to the rays in a basis form a set of commuting operators , and a joint measurement of these projectors causes the system to collapse into the ray associated with one of them , with the eigenvalue 1 being returned for this projector and 0 for the others .",
    "this explains why a hidden variables theory attempting to simulate quantum mechanics is required to assign a 1 to one projector and 0 s to the others .",
    "the rays and bases in our theoretical discussion correspond to states and compatible sets of projective measurements in an actual experiment .",
