    "pairing of electrons by exchange of spin fluctuations is a popular paradigm proposed for unconventional superconductivity including fe - based superconductors , cuprates , and heavy fermion systems .",
    "since many of these systems exhibit an ordered magnetic phase coexisting with , or in close proximity to , the superconducting phase , a small number of studies have addressed the subsidiary problem of pairing of quasi - particles in the symmetry broken spin - density - wave ( sdw ) phase . while this problem has a long history , recent experimental and theoretical developments have led a number of authors to revisit it.@xcite    for the simplest case of a doped one - band hubbard model with standard commensurate @xmath4 ordering , the existence of pairing and its consequences for the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter was initially investigated in a seminal paper by schrieffer _",
    "et al . _ ,  @xcite where the effective pairing interaction was obtained within the random phase approximation ( rpa ) arising from longitudinal spin fluctuations in the magnetically ordered phase .",
    "these authors neglected the contribution to pairing from the transverse spin fluctuations corresponding to the goldstone mode of the spin symmetry broken state , arguing that while such modes lead to a divergent contribution to the spin susceptibility at the ordering vector @xmath5 , the coherence factors of the sdw phase screen the bare electron - electron interaction vertex , which therefore vanishes at @xmath5 .",
    "soon after , frenkel and hanke  @xcite showed that the transverse fluctuations do contribute to the pairing interaction in the same order as the longitudinal fluctuations ; the divergence of the transverse spin susceptibility is eliminated by the coherence factors , but a residual constant interaction remains .    for electron - doped cuprates , the one - band hubbard model seems to provide a reasonable minimal model since the doped electrons reside primarily on the copper sites .",
    "furthermore , calculations of band parameters for the electron - doped cuprates point to the fact that the coulomb interaction is smaller than the bandwidth ,  @xcite in contrast to their hole - doped counterparts . in consequence ,",
    "the mean field treatment of the sdw order works quite well for the normal state properties of the electron - doped systems .",
    "in particular , arpes reports show a fermi surface evolution upon increased electron doping which agrees well with the band reconstruction of the one - band hubbard model due to commensurate @xmath4 order . upon electron doping ,",
    "the fermi surface consists of electron pockets around @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "close to critical electron doping , the emergence of hole pockets at ( or close to ) the fermi level around @xmath8 , @xmath9 may occur .",
    "@xcite    theoretically , the study of spin - fluctuation pairing for the electron - doped cuprates has been addressed mostly in the paramagnetic phase ,  @xcite where the mechanism was found to give rise to a gap with @xmath0 symmetry with strong non - monotonic features as a function of momentum as a result of fermi surface intersections with the magnetic zone boundary , the so - called hot spots . at these positions",
    "the pairing becomes particularly pronounced .",
    "this behavior was found to agree qualitatively with arpes  @xcite and raman  @xcite observations . in ref .   the possibility for a cross - over to @xmath10 symmetry",
    "was found at large dopings . in a later work , krotkov and chubukov",
    "@xcite studied the spin - mediated pairing gap close to the quantum critical point of antiferromagnetic ( af ) order and found an anisotropic @xmath0 gap symmetry , but the anisotropic behavior was not related to the hot spots , as opposed to previous work .",
    "a few studies also addressed the coexistence of superconductivity and long - range af order but treated the pairing phenomenologically , and also found a @xmath0-wave solution .",
    "@xcite    for hole - doped cuprates , stronger interactions imply that application of a weak - coupling approach to pairing is somewhat less justified .",
    "in addition , calculations of the spin wave spectrum suggest that the commensurate @xmath4 order in this case is not the ground state solution ,  @xcite complicating the theoretical modelling .",
    "spin - fluctuation - mediated pairing has , however , been extensively applied to study also hole - doped cuprates within the one - band hubbard model .",
    "first , for the paramagnetic phase scalapino _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite generalised the approach of berk and schrieffer  @xcite and found a dominant @xmath0-wave pairing instability .",
    "later , the study was extended by various methods and numerical approaches  @xcite including discussions of the possibility of other superconducting pairing symmetries arising from spin fluctuations . from a strong coupling approach ,",
    "as derived from the @xmath11 model , analysis of the effective pairing at low hole doping  @xcite suggests a @xmath3-wave superconducting ground state in any coexistence phase .",
    "this is consistent with rigorous perturbative weak - coupling calculations in the presence of weak density - wave order  @xcite as well as a study of hole - doped cuprates in the coexistence phase .",
    "@xcite in addition , a recent study of spin - fluctuation mediated superconductivity in the sdw ordered metal attacked the problem by analytical rpa calculations in the large magnetization ( small pocket ) limit  @xcite and found that interactions were dominated by longitudinal fluctuations on the electron - doped side , supporting a nodeless @xmath0 gap , whereas on the hole - doped side both longitudinal and transverse fluctuations support a nodal @xmath0 gap .",
    "recently , lu _ et al . _  @xcite studied the case of underdoped cuprates in a @xmath11 like model and came to a rather different conclusion . in this paper , the coexistence of commensurate af and superconductivity was investigated in a phenomenological model where the pairing interaction arises based on nearest - neighbor magnetic exchange neglecting the double occupancy constraint . in the coexistence phase , this study found the leading superconducting instability to be triplet @xmath1-wave in the case of hole doping , providing a potential explanation for recent photoemission measurements indicating a  nodal gap \" , a state with a full gap near the usual positions of the @xmath0 gap nodes whose existence is well - established at higher dopings.@xcite it is worth noting , however , that in the original strong - coupling study of unconventional superconductivity driven by the spin waves , studied within the @xmath11 model , the @xmath0-wave symmetry of the superconducting gap was found to be the only stable solution .",
    "@xcite we also note that there exist other potential explanations of the existence of the nodeless gap in the literature .",
    "@xcite    this controversy suggests the need for a better understanding of the phase diagram of the single - band hubbard model within a single , reliable approximation scheme which can encompass paramagnetic , superconducting and coexistence phases , and which is capable of identifying the strength of pairing by both longitudinal and transverse spin fluctuations and charge fluctuations , and their relative importance for pairing across a large doping range , for different electronic structures , and for both weak and strong magnetism .",
    "therefore , we extend the work of ref .   by a more complete , fully numerical solution of the problem to both confirm the analytical calculations and extend them to the larger phase diagram .",
    "we address the question of how the pairing interactions and resulting gap symmetry in the one - band hubbard model , treated within the full spin - fluctuation approach with self - consistently determined sdw order , evolve as a function of doping throughout the phase diagram , including the coexistence dome of sdw order and superconductivity .",
    "we show that the @xmath0 solution is in fact the leading superconducting instability for all electron doping levels . in the hole - doped case ,",
    "we limit ourselves to small hole doping only and force the @xmath4 order to be stable by a suppression of additional intrapocket nesting contributions to the transverse spin susceptibility .",
    "this approach also yields a coexistence phase with @xmath0 order .",
    "thus , the weak - coupling approach where pairing is mediated by spin fluctuations gives qualitatively different results than the `` strong - coupling '' approach of ref .   in the case of hole doping .",
    "we find that the sub - leading instability is a singlet @xmath2-wave solution , which shares common nodes with the @xmath0 solution along the zone diagonals , and has additional nodes along the momentum axes . in the hole - doped case where",
    "the fermi pockets are located far away from the zone axis , @xmath2 and @xmath0 become nearly degenerate .",
    "however , since the two solutions share common nodes , there is no gain in condensation energy by e.g. a time - reversal - symmetry broken solution of the form @xmath12 , and the solution of the full gap equation in fact favors @xmath0 over @xmath2 .",
    "we find further that extended @xmath13-wave is always suppressed in the coexistence phase , in agreement with the findings in ref .   for small doping levels , and on the electron - doped side we do not encounter a leading triplet gap at any moderate doping away from half - filling .",
    "the spin - fluctuation - pairing mechanism becomes strongly suppressed above the critical doping for which long - range magnetic order vanishes , since the nesting conditions are rapidly weakening as the fermi surface segments of the paramagnetic phase move apart .",
    "in a recent study of the iron - based superconductors by hinojosa _ et al . _",
    "@xcite it was pointed out that additional interband gaps may develop in the coexistence phase due to pairing of two fermions residing on different bands .",
    "such pairs are naively expected to be negligible because they involve fermionic states far from the fermi energy and do not alone manifest a cooper instability . in this regard ,",
    "these interband pairs can be considered as `` anomalous '' .",
    "however , they are non - zero in the sdw state due to a combined effect of the sdw gap and coupling to the intraband gaps ( dubbed in the following as normal gaps ) . in the iron - based system , this effect is predicted to create a different superconducting phase which explicitly breaks time - reversal symmetry by development of chiral gaps .",
    "we find from a self - consistent treatment of the coupled gap equations that the one - band hubbard model also supports substantial anomalous interband pairings .",
    "the structural factor of the anomalous gaps is @xmath0 as for the intraband gaps , but the phase structure of the intraband and interband gaps can be different . however ,",
    "unlike the case of iron - based system ,  @xcite the chiral solution @xmath14 does not appear to be favored in our numerical calculations .",
    "the model is the one - band hubbard hamiltonian @xmath15 where @xmath16 creates an electron on site @xmath17 with spin @xmath18 .",
    "the interaction term @xmath19 denotes the energy cost associated with having two electrons on the same site . in reciprocal space",
    "the hamiltonian reads @xmath20 with @xmath21 - 4t'\\cos(k_x)\\cos(k_y)-\\mu.\\ ] ] the parameter @xmath22 is the energy gain corresponding to hopping between neighboring sites , and @xmath23 denotes the energy gain by hopping to next - nearest neighbor sites .",
    "the doping level of the system is controlled by changing the chemical potential @xmath24 .",
    "the interaction between two electrons is first treated in the hartree - fock approximation giving rise to af ordering of the spins .",
    "we therefore consider the mean field hamiltonian @xmath25 where @xmath26 $ ] is the af order parameter , and @xmath27 refers to summation over the reduced brillouin zone only .",
    "diagonalization of the mean field hamiltonian leads to the energy spectrum @xmath28 the magnetic gap equation is solved self - consistently given the hopping integrals @xmath29 , @xmath30 , the coulomb repulsion @xmath19 and the doping .",
    "a gapless goldstone mode at @xmath31 in the transverse spin channel is obtained automatically , since the magnetic gap equation is equivalent to the condition @xmath32 .",
    "@xcite      higher order interactions in @xmath19 generate superconductivity on top of the af order through longitudinal and transverse spin fluctuations , following the original proposals of refs .  .",
    "since @xmath19 scatters the bare electrons , the diagrammatics are performed in terms of the bare electron green s functions , but the cooper pairing takes place between the quasi - particles of the af state .",
    "the quasi - particle operators are related to the bare electron operators by the transformation : @xmath33.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] transverse and longitudinal spin fluctuations give rise to fundamentally different interactions .",
    "inspection of the interaction vertex formulated in real space  @xcite shows that the charge and longitudinal interaction vertices give rise to no spin flips , whereas the transverse interaction does . in the latter channel",
    ", we have the gapless goldstone mode of the af phase which gives rise to a divergent interaction potential between the bare electrons . however , when we consider pairing between the quasi - particles of the af state , this divergence is removed by the coherence factors as noted in earlier works .",

    "<S> we study the phase diagram of the hubbard model in the weak - coupling limit for coexisting spin - density - wave order and spin - fluctuation - mediated superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> both longitudinal and transverse spin fluctuations contribute significantly to the effective interaction potential , which creates cooper pairs of the quasi - particles of the antiferromagnetic metallic state . </S>",
    "<S> we find a dominant @xmath0-wave solution in both electron- and hole - doped cases . in the quasi - spin triplet channel , </S>",
    "<S> the longitudinal fluctuations give rise to an effective attraction supporting a @xmath1-wave gap , but are overcome by repulsive contributions from the transverse fluctuations which disfavor @xmath1-wave pairing compared to @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the sub - leading pair instability is found to be in the @xmath2-wave channel , but complex admixtures of @xmath3 and @xmath2 are not energetically favored since their nodal structures coincide . </S>",
    "<S> inclusion of interband pairing , in which each fermion in the cooper pair belongs to a different spin - density - wave band , is considered for a range of electron dopings in the regime of well - developed magnetic order . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that these interband pairing gaps , which are non - zero in the magnetic state , must have the same parity under inversion as the normal intraband gaps . </S>",
    "<S> the self - consistent solution to the full system of five coupled gap equations give intraband and interband pairing gaps of @xmath0 structure and similar gap magnitude . in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , the @xmath0 gap dominates for both hole and electron doping inside the spin - density - wave phase . </S>"
