    "<S> the task is to place @xmath0 facilities along the line and find the configuration that minimizes an objective function , in this case the average distance to the nearest facility  @xcite . ignoring small - scale heterogeneity in the population , </S>",
    "<S> an analytic calculation predicts a simple scaling law for the length of the line segments served by different facilities . </S>",
    "<S> the exact optimum locations can be computed numerically for realistic input data and are in good agreement with the analytic prediction . using techniques from statistical physics </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate the number of possible facility locations for non - minimal costs . </S>",
    "<S> with monte carlo simulations we will then quantify how deviations from the optimum make it less likely to find the theoretical exponent . </S>"
