    "recently , liu and vohra@xcite presented intriguing evidence regarding the pressure dependence of the born effective charge in @xmath2-sic .",
    "these authors found that the effective charge increased initially with increasing pressure , reaching a maximum at about 0.4 mbar . further increasing the pressure , however , resulted in a decrease in the magnitude of the effective charge .",
    "because of its great potential in device applications , especially in harsh environments , it is important to accurately characterize the properties of this unusual material .",
    "sic crystallizes in hundreds of polytypes , corresponding to different stacking sequences of si - c bilayers in the cubic direction.@xcite polytypes with cubic , hexagonal and rhombohedral symmetry are designated @xmath0 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively , where @xmath6 is the number of layers in the repeating unit , with the @xmath0 structure corresponding to the zincblende structure .",
    "the different polytypes have very similar properties , since differences in local atomic coordination first appear in the second neighbor shell and the experimental equation of state for the different polytypes are very similar.@xcite phonon dispersion along the stacking direction is considered universal for different prototypes and this universality has been used to map out the phonon frequencies in this direction from raman scattering measurements.@xcite indeed , a recent self - consistent study of @xmath0 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 sic by karch _ et al._@xcite found only small differences in the calculated phonon frequencies along the stacking direction .",
    "the main purpose of the present work is to report a first - principles study of structural and dynamical properties of sic under high pressure . in particular , the volume dependence of the born effective charges and the dielectric constant were obtained .",
    "we find that the born effective charge increases nearly linearly as the volume is decreased .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with the above - mentioned turn - over behavior reported recently for @xmath2-sic .",
    "the likely reasons for this discrepancy will be discussed in light of the calculated results .",
    "first principles total - energy calculations in the local - density approximation ( lda ) were performed using the linearized augmented plane wave ( lapw ) method@xcite to determine the ground state structural properties of @xmath0-sic at equilibrium and under pressure .",
    "lattice dynamical properties , born effective charges , and the dielectric constant were obtained with a linear response algorithm developed recently within the lapw method.@xcite to dispense with the need to treat the chemically inert localized inner core orbitals , we employ a hard kerker@xcite type pseudopotential . the muffin - tin radii for si and c",
    "are 1.79 and 1.50 @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "we used the wigner interpolation formula for exchange - correlation potential.@xcite born effective charges and the dielectric constant were calculated using up to a uniform _",
    "k_-point mesh@xcite , which corresponds to 28 special points in the irreducible brillouin zone ( bz ) . at this level of convergence ,",
    "the acoustic sum - rule is satisfied with an error of only 0.6% . in calculating the dynamical matrices",
    ", we used an -point mesh .",
    "tests with denser meshes show that phonon frequencies are converged to better than about 0.5% .",
    "tests with other exchange - correlation functionals also display differences at this level .",
    "phonon dispersions in the harmonic approximation were obtained in the full bz as follows .",
    "first , _ ab initio _ calculations were carried out to determine the dynamical matrix at the irreducible phonon wavevectors corresponding to a uniform mesh , which by symmetry gives the dynamical matrix at all mesh points .",
    "the dynamical matrix can then be obtained at arbitrary wavevectors by interpolation , first separating it into a long - range dipole - dipole term and a short - range term.@xcite the former is evaluated exactly from the calculated born effective charges and dielectric constant using the ewald summation technique .",
    "the remaining short - range part is then interpolated using real - space force constants , which are found through fourier transform .",
    "lapw total energy calculations were performed to determine the theoretical lattice constant @xmath10 , bulk modulus @xmath11 and its pressure derivative @xmath12 for @xmath0-sic by fitting to the murnaghan equation of state.@xcite earlier experimental and theoretical studies suggest that the pressure - volume relations for different polytypes are similar , due to the rigidity of the nearest - neighbor coordination .",
    "the equation - of - state data for the two polytypes @xmath0-sic and @xmath2-sic have been found to be essentially the same up to the transition pressure of @xmath0-sic.@xcite theoretical calculations@xcite also yield very small difference in the bulk modulus ( less than 1% ) between the @xmath0 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 polytypes .",
    "the calculated pressure derivative of the bulk modulus for these polytypes are different by only 7%.@xcite    results for @xmath0-sic are presented in table  [ equil - sic ] and compared with other calculations and experiment for @xmath0 and other polytypes .",
    "our results agree well with other calculations given in the table .",
    "slight differences may be due to the use of different forms of the exchange - correlation potential .",
    "there is nearly perfect agreement between the present calculations and those of chang and cohen@xcite , both using the wigner exchange - correlation potential .",

    "@xcite used an lmto basis set and the von barth - hedin parametrization of the exchange - correlation energy.@xcite as also seen in other systems@xcite , the wigner form tends to yield slightly larger equilibrium lattice constants than other forms , and as expected the bulk modulus is accordingly slightly smaller .    a number of high - pressure experiments have been carried out on various polytypes of sic . while they generally show little difference between the equation of state for different polytypes , there are large discrepancies between the results of different experimental groups for the bulk modulus and its pressure derivative",
    ". most earlier experiments report a bulk modulus around 2.25 mbar . the recent work of yoshida",
    "_ et al._@xcite on sic polytypes up to 0.95 mbar , the highest pressurization on these materials so far , reported a relatively large bulk modulus @xmath11 ( @xmath13  mar ) and a smaller pressure derivative @xmath12 ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "they ascribed the discrepancy with the previous measurements to fitting to the larger pressure range in their experiment .",
    "analysis of our calculated results does not support this explanation . using our calculated total - energy at various volumes",

    "we find only small differences ( both @xmath11 and @xmath15 change about 1 @xmath16 ) compared to fitting over a smaller pressure range .",
    "the explanation is also inconsistent with the experiments of aleksandrov _",
    "et al._@xcite and goncharov _",
    "et al._@xcite , which were carried out respectively to 0.425 mbar and 0.45 mbar but obtained smaller bulk modulus as compared with that of strssner _",
    "et al._@xcite , which went up to only 0.25 mbar . based on the results of all existing well - converged theoretical calculations",
    ", it seems reasonable to suggest that the lower range of the experimental bulk modulus is more likely to be correct .",
    "we have also determined the volume dependence of the total energy for rocksalt structure sic .",

    "the agreement between the different calculations is good , predicting that the transformation from the zincblende phase to the rocksalt phase takes place at about 0.65 mbar .",
    "the volume of the zincblende phase at the phase transition is predicted to be about 82% of its equilibrium volume at ambient pressure , and the volume reduction accompanied by the transition is predicted to be about 20% .",
    "the predicted transition pressure and the volume of the @xmath0-sic phase before the transition differ considerably from the experimental data , but the observed volume reduction is in good agreement",
    ". this may be due to the fact that the experimental transition pressure was obtained for the forward transition ( from zincblende phase to rocksalt phase ) , where an excess pressure beyond the equilibrium value appears and is included in the measurements.@xcite      the born effective charge @xmath17 and dielectric constant @xmath18 are calculated at small * q * wavevector , where @xmath19 is the lattice constant .",

    "the acoustic sum rule requires that @xmath17(si ) and @xmath17(c ) have the same magnitude and opposite sign .",
    "violations arise from finite @xmath20-point sampling .",
    "however , good results can be obtained with 10 special @xmath20 points , especially after averaging the magnitudes of @xmath17(si ) and @xmath17(c).@xcite the averaging also reduces the effect of using a small but finite wavevector .",
    "this effect was checked by using a slightly larger wavevector , which yielded only a slightly larger discrepancy .",
