    "in the present universe , most bright galaxies have regular and symmetric morphologies , which can be classified in the framework of the hubble sequence @xcite . on the other hand , using the high - resolution imaging capability of the _ hubble space telescope _ ( @xmath9 ) , it has been found that many star - forming galaxies at @xmath10 have irregular shapes with asymmetric structures , ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "although these high - redshift irregular galaxies show a variety of morphologies , they commonly have giant ( kpc scale ) star - forming clumps ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "recent nir integral field spectroscopy observations of star - forming clumpy galaxies at @xmath11 revealed that a significant fraction of these galaxies show coherent rotation with a relatively large turbulent velocity in their ionized gas kinematics ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "several studies of the radio co line observations also found that actively star - forming galaxies at @xmath12 have large gas mass fractions of @xmath13  0.8 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "while some of these galaxies are galaxy mergers ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , these results can be explained by theoretical models where gas - rich rotational disks are gravitationally unstable for the fragmentation and lead to the formation of giant star - forming clumps ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the high gas mass fraction of these galaxies is considered to be maintained by the rapid and smooth cosmic infall of gas along large - scale filaments . since the accretion rate of gas is expected to decrease with time , especially at @xmath14 , the gas fraction of these clumpy galaxies declines at lower redshifts as the gas consumption by the star formation proceeds , which results in the stabilization of the gas disks @xcite . in this view",
    ", these high - redshift clumpy galaxies are considered to be progenitors of normal ( disk ) galaxies at low redshifts .",
    "therefore , it is important to study the evolution of these clumpy galaxies in order to understand the formation process of normal galaxies in the present universe .    however , the number of systematic surveys for clumpy galaxies is very limited , because wide - field imaging data with high spatial resolution are required .",
    "while @xcite claimed that clumpy galaxies are dominated at high redshift based on the morphological analysis of galaxies in the hudf field , @xcite reported that @xmath1540% of 100 h@xmath16 emitters at @xmath17 and @xmath18 in the ukidss / uds - candels field show clumpy morphologies .",
    "@xcite measured the fraction of clumpy galaxies in star - forming galaxies with @xmath19 at @xmath11 in the goods - south field , and found that the fraction is 74% for clumps selected at the rest - frame 2800",
    "  and 42% for those selected at the rest - frame @xmath20 band , which suggests that the morphological k - correction can be important for the selection of clumpy galaxies .",
    "although systematic surveys of clumpy galaxies at lower redshifts are also important for understanding the connection between clumpy galaxies at high redshifts and normal galaxies in the nearby universe , there is few survey for clumpy galaxies at @xmath14 . in this paper , we systematically search clumpy galaxies at @xmath0 in the cosmos field @xcite and investigate their physical properties .",
    "the high spatial resolution images taken with @xmath9/advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) over the very wide field allow us to construct a large sample of clumpy galaxies at @xmath21 and to investigate the fraction of clumpy galaxies and its evolution as a function of physical properties such as stellar mass and star formation rate for the first time .",

    "the resulting catalog in this second sextractor run was cross - matched with that in the first run .",
    "we then selected sample galaxies which are deblended into more than two components as clumpy galaxy candidates . in order to ensure that at least three clumps are comparatively bright , we set further criteria for clumpy galaxies as @xmath32 and @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 are @xmath27-band fluxes of the brightest , the second brightest , and the third brightest clumps , respectively , in the galaxy . in figure",

    "we show the m@xmath29sfr diagram for the clumpy and non - clumpy galaxies , respectively , in figure [ fig : mstar ] . relatively small number of galaxies around @xmath37 in the both samples is due to the magnitude limit of @xmath38 . since the observed @xmath27 band samples a shorter rest - frame wavelength at higher redshift , low - mass galaxies with lower sfrs in the high redshift bins tend to be missed by this magnitude limit .",
    "we discuss possible systematic effects of the magnitude limit on our results in section [ sec : bias ] .",
    "the distribution of non - clumpy galaxies in the m@xmath29sfr diagram shows a bimodality , which consists of passively evolving galaxies mainly located at higher stellar mass around @xmath39 and star - forming galaxies located at @xmath40 .",
    "the sfrs of star - forming galaxies increase with increasing stellar mass , and they form a sequence in the m@xmath29sfr plane , namely , the `` main sequence '' of star - forming galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "[ fig : mstar ] , we plot the boundary line of the @xmath42 gyr@xmath25 , which divides galaxies into the passively evolving and star - forming populations , for reference . since almost all clumpy galaxies lie above the boundary line , especially , at high redshift , they are star - forming galaxies . the range of the sfrs of clumpy galaxies at a given stellar mass is similar to that of the other star - forming galaxies in all the mass and redshift ranges , although their sfrs tend to be higher values as we will show in detail in the following subsection .",
    "we investigated the fraction of clumpy galaxies in our sample at @xmath0 as a function of stellar mass , sfr , and specific sfr ( @xmath43 sfr / m@xmath29 , hereafter ssfr ) , to study their role in the galaxy evolution and the origins of their morphology .",

    "while the range of ssfrs of clumpy galaxies is similar to that of the other ( non - clumpy ) star - forming galaxies as shown in figure [ fig : mstar ] , the distribution of ssfr of clumpy galaxies tends to be skewed toward higher values .",

    "the rest - frame @xmath66 band at @xmath67 , the relatively bright @xmath27-band magnitude limit can lead to a bias for galaxies with higher ssfrs at lower stellar mass .",
    "therefore we may preferentially miss low - mass galaxies with relatively low ssfrs at higher redshift . in order to check this point in more detail",
    ", we show the ssfr - m@xmath29 diagram for galaxies with @xmath38 and those with @xmath68 in figure [ fig : msbias ] .",
    "it is shown that galaxies with relatively low ssfrs are missed by the @xmath27-band magnitude limit at @xmath69 in the @xmath3 bin , while almost all galaxies with @xmath44 gyr@xmath25 are picked up down to @xmath70 at lower redshifts . in figure",
    "[ fig : biasmf ] , we show the fraction of clumpy galaxies in star - forming galaxies as in figure [ fig : mfrac ] but for galaxies with @xmath71 .",
    "it is shown that the relatively high fraction around @xmath45 for galaxies at @xmath3 seen in figure [ fig : mfrac ] becomes lower , and the fraction is consistent with a constant value of @xmath13 .",
    "this is because we include low - mass galaxies with relatively low ssfrs at high redshift by using galaxies down to @xmath72 .",
    "although we can mitigate the bias against low - mass galaxies with low ssfrs by including more faint galaxies into the sample , we note that the selection of clumpy galaxies becomes less secure for galaxies at @xmath73 . on the other hand ,",
    "the bias caused by the @xmath27-band magnitude limit does not seem to affect the results in figures [ fig : msfrac ] and [ fig : fssfr ] , because the fraction of clumpy galaxies _ at a given ssfr _ is not changed by this effect .",
    "in fact , we performed the same analysis by using the different @xmath27-band magnitude limits and confirmed that the trends seen in figures [ fig : msfrac ] and [ fig : fssfr ] do not depend on the magnitude limit .",
    "second , we examined the effect of the morphological k - correction in our analysis .",

    "@xcite also pointed out that the morphological k - correction significantly affects the fraction of clumpy galaxies at @xmath11 . taking account of these results , we keep in mind the effect of the morphological k - correction when discussing the evolution of the fraction of clumpy galaxies in the following section .",
    "in this study , we constructed a large sample of clumpy galaxies at @xmath0 in the cosmos field using the @xmath9/acs data and investigated the fraction of these galaxies and its evolution as a function of stellar mass , sfr , and ssfr .",

    "our main results are as follows .    *",
    "the fraction of clumpy galaxies in star - forming galaxies decreases with time from @xmath2 at @xmath3 to @xmath4 at @xmath5 irrespective of stellar mass , although the fraction tends to be slightly lower at @xmath81 in each redshift bin . *",
    "the fraction of clumpy galaxies increases with increasing both sfr and ssfr in all the redshift ranges we investigated . in particular , the ssfr dependences of the fractions are similar among galaxies with different stellar masses .",
    "moreover , the fraction at a given ssfr does not depend on stellar mass in each redshift bin . *",
    "the fraction of clumpy galaxies at a given ssfr decreases with time at @xmath44 gyr@xmath25 .",
    "this can be explained by the effect of the morphological k - correction .",
    "we found that the fraction of clumpy galaxies increases with increasing both sfr and ssfr .",
    "the similar fractions at a given ssfr among galaxies with different stellar masses may indicate that the ssfr is more important and fundamental physical parameter for the origin of the clumpy morphology . among previous studies on clumpy galaxies ,",
    "@xcite studied 14 clumpy galaxies and 13 smooth disk galaxies at @xmath82 selected by an eyeball classification , and found that the average and median ssfrs of clumpy galaxies are higher than those of smooth disk galaxies . @xcite also reported that clumpy galaxies at @xmath83 have systematically higher ssfrs than the other star - forming galaxies at the same redshifts .",
    "they selected clumpy galaxies with a quantitative clumpiness parameter , but their measurement of the clumpiness includes the surface brightness fluctuation on relatively small scales . the ssfr dependence of the fraction of clumpy galaxies seen in figure [ fig : msfrac ] is consistent with the results of these previous studies , although the selection methods for clumpy galaxies are different among the studies .",
    "since the ssfr is a current birth rate of stars relative to the integrated past star formation rate , it can be considered to represent the evolutionary stages of the stellar mass assembly by the star formation . in this view",
    ", the relatively high ssfrs of clumpy galaxies indicates that these galaxies may be systematically in younger stages in their star formation history .",
    "we can also consider the ssfr as a proxy for the gas mass to stellar mass ratio , m@xmath84/m@xmath29 , if we naively assume that the sfrs of galaxies roughly reflect their gas mass .",
    "clumpy galaxies are expected to be ( probably young ) objects with relatively high gas mass fraction in this case .",
    "recently , the gravitational instability and fragmentation in gas - rich disks is often proposed as a possible origin of the clumpy morphology of high - redshift galaxies , which show both coherent rotation and relatively large velocity dispersion in their gas ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "gas - rich rotational disks are gravitationally unstable for the fragmentation and lead to the formation of large clumps . in this framework",
    ", the gas mass fraction is a key physical parameter .",
    "the stability for the gravitational fragmentation of the disks and the maximum unstable mass scale strongly depend on the gas mass fraction ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "if the ssfr is closely related to the gas mass fraction , the strong ssfr dependence of the fraction of clumpy galaxies in figure [ fig : msfrac ] can be explained by the relationship between the gravitational fragmentation and the gas mass fraction of the rotational disks .",
    "@xcite also discussed that a large maximum unstable mass of gas - rich disks corresponds to a large velocity dispersion of turbulent motions of gas in the self - regulated quasi - stationary state with the toomre parameter @xmath85 .",
    "they also claimed that the large velocity dispersion can cause an enhancement of star formation activity .",
    "in fact , the correlation between the mass of the most massive clump of galaxies and their surface sfr density has been observed at @xmath47 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this scenario may explain the relatively higher ssfrs of clumpy galaxies .",
    "another possible origin of the clumpy morphology is the galaxy merger ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "for example , @xcite performed extensive numerical simulations of major mergers and found that gas - rich major mergers can cause the greater disk fragmentation than the cases of isolated gas - rich galaxies .",
    "morphological studies of high - redshift galaxies and comparisons of these objects with merger galaxies in the nearby universe suggested that some fraction of clumpy and irregular galaxies at @xmath47 are ongoing mergers ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite suggested that a non - negligible fraction of large clumps in high - redshift clumpy galaxies come from minor mergers , based on a numerical cosmological simulation of disk galaxies .",
    "@xcite reported that a significant fraction of intermediate - mass clumpy galaxies at @xmath86 have complex kinematics , which is compatible with major mergers . in this scenario ,",
    "the ssfr dependence of the fraction of clumpy galaxies can be understood by the enhancement of star formation caused by the galaxy mergers .",
    "the galaxy interaction / merger does not only cause disturbed and clumpy morphologies , but also triggers intense star formation .",
    "thus the ssfrs of clumpy galaxies tend to be enhanced from the main sequence of star - forming galaxies",
    ". however , it is unclear whether such starbursts by mergers are consistent with the relatively tight sfr - m@xmath29 relation or not ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we found that the overall fraction of clumpy galaxies in star - forming galaxies with @xmath87 decreases from @xmath2 at @xmath67 to @xmath4 at @xmath8 . while many actively star - forming galaxies with clumpy morphologies",
    "have been observed at @xmath10 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , most relatively bright galaxies belong to the hubble sequence and clumpy galaxies are very rare at @xmath88 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "our result naturally connects between these previous studies in the early universe and those in the nearby universe , although the morphological k - correction may affect the result ( section [ sec : bias ] ) .",
    "@xcite reported that the fraction of clumpy galaxies in star - forming galaxies at @xmath63 is 27 % when the selection for clumps was performed at the rest - frame @xmath20 band .",
    "our result at @xmath3 ( @xmath89% ) , which was obtained at the rest - frame @xmath66 band ( see section [ sec : bias ] ) , is consistent with their result , although the selection criteria for clumpy galaxies are different .",
    "several authors pointed out that the clumpy morphology persists to lower redshifts in lower - mass galaxies , so called `` down - sizing effect '' in the clumpy morphology ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "there are many bright / massive clumpy galaxies at @xmath90 , while such clumpy morphology can be seen only in low - mass systems such as dwarf irregular galaxies in the present universe . in figure",
    "[ fig : down ] , we show the evolution of the fraction of clumpy galaxies with different stellar masses in order to investigate the down - sizing effect .",
    "the evolution is similar among the different mass samples , while the fraction of clumpy galaxies is slightly lower in massive galaxies with @xmath6 .",
    "the differences of the fraction among galaxies with different masses become larger when we include passive galaxies with @xmath54 gyr@xmath25 into the samples ( the right panel of figure [ fig : down ] ) .",
    "if we extrapolate the trend in figure [ fig : down ] to the present , the fraction of clumpy galaxies in more massive galaxies is expected to become negligible earlier .",
    "therefore , our result is not inconsistent with the down - sizing picture , but the mass dependence of the evolution is weak in the stellar mass range we investigated",
    ". the lower fraction of clumpy galaxies in massive star - forming galaxies with @xmath91 at each redshift may be explained by lower ssfr of these massive galaxies ( figure [ fig : msbias ] ) .     and",
    "the fractions of barred spiral galaxies from @xcite as a function of redshift .",
    "diamonds show the fraction of all barred spiral galaxies , while triangles represent that of strong barred galaxies .",
    "these fractions of barred galaxies are measured in face - on spiral galaxies with inclination angles of @xmath92 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    ", width=340 ]    another our result of the ssfr dependence of the fraction of clumpy galaxies seen in all the mass and redshift ranges indicates that the evolution of the ssfrs of galaxies leads to the evolution of the fraction of clumpy galaxies .",
    "in fact , the median ssfr of star - forming galaxies decreases by @xmath93 dex from @xmath7 to @xmath94 ( figure [ fig : msfrac ] ) .",
    "for example , if we assume the relation between the fraction of clumpy galaxies and ssfr at @xmath3 shown in figure [ fig : fssfr ] , the decrease of the ssfr from @xmath95 gyr@xmath25 ( median value at @xmath67 ) to @xmath96 gyr@xmath25 ( that at @xmath8 ) corresponds to the evolution of the fraction from @xmath2 to @xmath4 .",
    "thus the evolution of the fraction of clumpy galaxies in star - forming galaxies at @xmath0 appear to be explained by the evolution of the ssfr . on the other hand , from such correlation between the fraction of clumpy galaxies and ssfr ,",
    "the fraction of clumpy galaxies is expected to be higher at higher redshifts , because galaxies tend to have higher ssfrs than those at @xmath41 .",

    "the average ssfrs of star - forming galaxies at @xmath11 in both studies are @xmath98 gyr@xmath25 , and therefore the fractions of clumpy galaxies of @xmath99% in these studies seem to be consistent with the relation between the fraction of clumpy galaxies and ssfr at @xmath3 shown in figure [ fig : fssfr ] .    in the gravitational fragmentation model for the formation of giant clumps in disk galaxies , the rapid and smooth streams of gas along filaments effectively penetrate halos of galaxies at high redshift ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this `` cold accretion '' keeps active star formation and a high gas mass fraction of these galaxies , which leads to the formation of the clumpy morphology .",
    "in fact , such high gas mass fraction of star - forming galaxies at @xmath11 have been observed ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , and the observed high turbulent velocity of gas in high - redshift clumpy galaxies also supports this scenario ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) . using an analytic model , @xcite predicted that such disks tend to stabilize at @xmath100 mainly due to the decrease of the gas mass fraction .",
    "they suggested that the decrease is attributed to the gradual decline of the cosmological accretion rate into halos of galaxies with time ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the gas consumption by the star formation , the inflows of clumps into the center of galaxies by the gravitational torque ( e.g , @xcite ) , and the gas outflows by the supernova feedback . if the ssfrs of galaxies are closely related to the gas mass fraction as discussed above , the evolution of the fraction of clumpy galaxies at @xmath0 could be explained by this scenario .",
    "the decrease of the gas mass fraction with time at @xmath14 causes the stabilization of galactic disks , while it also leads to the decrease of the ssfrs of these galaxies .",
    "interestingly , several studies reported that the fraction of barred spiral galaxies increases with time in the same redshift range ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the bar instability is considered to occur in `` mature''systems where stellar disk is dynamically cold and rotationally supported , and the surface stellar density is sufficiently high .",
    "clumpy galaxies may evolve to these barred galaxies when the gas fraction becomes lower and the stellar disk is stabilized ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : bar ] , we compare the fraction of clumpy galaxies with the fraction of barred spiral galaxies in the same cosmos field from @xcite . note that since the bar fraction in @xcite is the fraction of barred galaxies in face - on spiral galaxies with @xmath92 excluding irregular galaxies , it is difficult to directly compare the absolute values of the both fractions .",
    "nevertheless , we can see the fraction of barred spiral galaxies increases with time , as the fraction of clumpy galaxies decreases in the figure .",
    "the transition from clumpy galaxies to barred spiral galaxies may gradually occur from @xmath63 to @xmath88 .",
    "on the other hand , in the major merger scenario for the origin of the clumpy morphology , the evolution of the major merger rate may explain the evolution of the fraction of clumpy galaxies at @xmath0 .",
    "many observational studies have found that the major merger rate decreases with time at @xmath14 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , several studies reported that the gas - rich wet major merger , which is considered to be important for making the clumpy morphology @xcite , decreases with time in the redshift range ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ fig : merger ] compares the observed fraction of clumpy galaxies at @xmath0 with that expected from the wet major merger rate of galaxies with @xmath101 by @xcite .",
    "we multiplied the major merger rate from @xcite by an arbitrary time scale when the merged galaxies are seen as clumpy galaxies to estimate the expected fraction of clumpy galaxies .",
    "the evolution of clumpy galaxies can be roughly explained by the evolution of the major merger rate with the time scales of @xmath79 36 gyr .",
    "however , these time scales seem to be too long for the merger time scale during which the morphology is disturbed and clumpy ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "if we assume a typical merger time scale of @xmath102 gyr , the expected fraction of clumpy galaxies become much lower than the observed fraction at @xmath103 ( the dashed line in figure [ fig : merger ] ) .",
    "it seems to be difficult to explain the fraction of clumpy galaxies at @xmath0 only by the wet major merger .",
    "finally , we note that the fraction of clumpy galaxies at a given ssfr decreases with time from @xmath7 to @xmath8 .",
    "this can be due to the morphological k - correction because we selected clumpy galaxies at the observed @xmath27 band as discussed in section [ sec : bias ] .",
    "if this is the case , the intrinsic fraction of clumpy galaxies at a given ssfr could not depend on redshift .",
    "there may be the universal relation between the fraction of clumpy galaxies and ssfr .",
    "we would like to thank the anonymous referee for valuable comments and suggestions .",
    "we also thank tsutomu t. takeuchi at nagoya university for his generous support to k. l. m. and for useful discussion .",
