    "some modified theories of gravity are an actual alternative to the dark matter paradigm , which in spite of its success to explain astrophysical problems like the flat rotation curves of spiral galaxies , the gravitational lensing by clusters of galaxies and the formation of structure in the early universe , is not the ultimate word of the story .    in the different alternatives we find the modifications to the hilbert - einstein action , which introduce an arbitrary function of the ricci scalar @xmath4 in the action .",
    "this modification is relevant , because there s no exist an _ a priori reason to restrict the gravitational action to @xmath4 and has the advantage to be a metric theory of gravitation that carry out with several physical principles and at the same time accounts to the energy - momentum conservation , as well as the equations of the theory are invariants . _    in this sense , sobouti ( 2007 ) has developed a metric theory @xmath0 that reproduces flat rotation curves in different spiral galaxies ( with @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) , reproduces the tully - fisher relation , converges to a version of mond in the weak field approximation and the resulting differential field equations are of the second order .",
    "the model introduces the following modification to the hilbert - einstein action ( @xcite ; @xcite ) :    @xmath7    variation of the action @xmath8 with respect to the metric @xmath9 gives the following field equations ( @xcite ) :    @xmath10    for an application of this theory to different galactic systems , the metric is chosen like a schwarzschild - like one given by ( @xcite ; @xcite ) :    @xmath11    if the function @xmath12 differs not too much from general relativity at first order of approximation , the exterior solution ( @xmath13 ) to the field equations is obtained with the assumption that @xmath14 is a parametric function @xmath15 with @xmath1 a real number such that @xmath16 ( for @xmath17 the solution converges to g.r . ) . proposing a solution of the form @xmath18 ,",
    "results in @xmath19 and the solutions for the metric are ( @xcite ) :    @xmath20 ; \\rm { } \\rm { }    b(r ) = \\left ( \\frac { r}{s } \\right ) ^ \\alpha \\frac { 1}{a(r ) } \\label{ionflux};\\ ] ]    where @xmath21 is the schwarzschild radius . for @xmath16 , @xmath0",

    "mendoza & rosas - guevara(2007 ) have shown that the deflection angle @xmath23 for a spherically symmetric mass distribution in this metric theory ( cf .",

    "when @xmath17 , the deflection angle equals the einstein s one : @xmath26 .    for an application in gravitational lensing for a symmetric object ( e.g. a cluster of galaxies ) with mass @xmath27",

    "since these results are derived from a metric with spherical symmetry , we use observations in x - rays of gravitational lensing by 13 clusters of galaxies that approximate well to this symmetry ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in order to estimate the parameter @xmath1",
    ", we assume that the estimated values of the einstein angle from the observations approximates @xmath53 .",
    "we use this as a first way to mesure the order of magnitude to @xmath1 .",
    "the cosmological model used is : @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 . to calculate the einstein angle we use the virial mass of the system with",
    "the mean velocity dispersion observed in a particular system ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    using this method we can solve numerically the equation ( 10 ) to obtain @xmath1 .",
    "sobouti s @xmath59 theory is a first approximation to a modified metric theory of gravity in order to account for phenomena usually adscribed to dark matter .",
    "however , there is a caveat with sobouti s approach .",
    "the mass dependency of @xmath60 destroys one of the most important facts of an ordinary action : it should be invariant under the changes of sources .",
    "also , this mass dependency means that the function @xmath61 varies from source to source .",
    "however , as mentioned by sobouti  ( 2007 ) , perhaps we need to re - think whether this postulate has to be accepted when modifications to standard general relativity are done .",
    "the way sobouti ( 2007 ) calculated the value for the parameter @xmath62 was using a spherically symmetric metric , applied to spiral galaxies .",
    "this is of course wrong since these galaxies are far from spherical symmetry .",
    "this is the reason as to why we decided to callibrate the @xmath63 parameter using spherical symmetric astrophysical systems : cluster of galaxies . from the many cluster of galaxies",
    "known we have chosen a set of very well spherically symmetric objects .    to summarize , our main results are as follows :    * the caustic in the source plane is the point colinear with the lens and the observer .",
    "this is an expected result since the metric is a schwarzschild - like one for a spherically symmetric matter distribution . *",
    "the @xmath1-mass relation from sobouti ( 2007 ) is given by @xmath64 .",
    "+ our best linear fit gives a value of @xmath65x@xmath66 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , that differs in three orders of magnitude from the value obtained by sobouti ( 2007 ) , @xmath67x@xmath68 , for 31 spiral galaxies with @xmath69 ( @xmath70 is the asymptotic constant tangential speed of the galaxy ) . +   vs. @xmath71 .",
    "the best linear fit is shown by the line.,width=453 ] * the log - log plot of @xmath1 vs. @xmath72 , leads the power law fit : @xmath73 \\left ( \\frac{m } { m_\\odot } \\right ) ^ { 0.25 } $ ] , i.e. a relation of the form : + @xmath74 +   vs. @xmath75 . the best linear fit is shown by the line.,width=453 ] * although the calculations are only a first approximation to the order of magnitude to the @xmath1 parameter , this is the correct way for evaluating it , since the distribution of barionic matter approximates to a spherical symmetric one in clusters of galaxies .",
    "* one could be tempted to use the results also for quite `` spherical '' elliptical galaxies . however , this approximation fails because the einstein angle in these galaxies is very small and so the variables @xmath76 and @xmath77 ( cf .",
    "eq.7 ) diverge . *",
    "_ future work : in section [ approximation ] we approximated the value @xmath60 by using the estimated einstein angles and equate them to @xmath78 .",
    "this is a first approximation to the real value of @xmath60 and the only way to correct this is to develope a complete theory of gravitational lensing for the metric theory proposed by sobouti . in this way",
    ", we intend to determine with much precision the exact value for the @xmath1 parameter , and check whether this theory can account for different astrophysical problems . _",
