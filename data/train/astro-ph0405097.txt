    "it is a measure with fractional value and gives the number of components measured at any brightness level : @xmath33 for a single iso - intensity contour ( i. e. component ) and @xmath34 for multi - contours .",
    "multiplicity is different than the euler characteristic ( @xmath35 ) , a member of the scalar mfs ( see rs1 for more ) .",
    "the ec is an integer number that gives the total number of components present at any given level but does not provide any information regardless of their sizes .",
    "multiplicity , on the other hand , is able to extract this information .",
    "it may be mentioned here that thomas et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have also used multiplicity as a parameter for sub - structure measure in n - body simulations .",
    "they define it as a ratio of mass of sub - clumps to cluster mass . in this study",
    "it is a ratio of the areas as defined in equation 1 .",
    "we use two variants of @xmath26 to present our results : one is the average of multiplicity over all density / brightness levels , @xmath36 , and the other is the maximum of the multiplicity found at one of the levels , @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath28 ellipticity ( @xmath27 ) : we adopt the definition of ellipticity , @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the semi - axes of an ellipse . for our purpose",
    "the semi - axes correspond to the `` auxiliary ellipse '' constructed from the eigenvalues of the area tensor ( see rs1 for detail ) .",
    "we have used two variations of @xmath27 : one is sensitive to the shape of the individual cluster components present at a given level while the other is sensitive to the collective shape formed by all the components present at that level .",
    "we label these two variants of @xmath27 , respectively , as the effective ( @xmath41 ) and the aggregate ( @xmath42 ) ellipticity .",
    "morphological properties of clusters such as shape and the nature or the degree of irregularity existing in these systems can be probed effectively with these two parameters .    at any given density / brightness level , we construct @xmath41 as , @xmath43 where @xmath44 are ellipticities of the individual iso - intensity contours measured as stated earlier and @xmath26 is the multiplicity at that level . the symbols @xmath30 and @xmath31 have similar meanings as before .    to construct @xmath42 , we take the union of all components present at a given level and form a collective region .",
    "the integrated region can be expressed as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the region enclosed by each component .",
    "subsequently we find the components of the area tensor and the `` auxiliary ellipse '' for the region @xmath47 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the behavior of @xmath42 is similar to conventional ellipticity measure based on inertia tensor ( carter & metcalf 1980 ) .",
    "but the construction procedure of these two measures are different .",
    "the conventional method finds the eigenvalue of the inertia tensor for an annular region enclosing mass density or surface brightness , on the other hand , the method based on mfs finds the eigenvalues of regions enclosed by the contour(s ) is assumed to be homogeneous .",
    "we have expressed ellipticities after averaging the estimates at all density / brightness levels .",
    "our final result is , therefore , expressed by @xmath48 and @xmath49 rather than @xmath50 and @xmath51 .      to get a better feeling of the parameters mentioned above we provide an illustrative example with toy models .",
    "one can think of these toy models as snap shots of different x - ray clusters in projection taken at one particular time .",
    "we include clusters with different types of internal structures in fig .",
    "[ toy_img ] : unimodal elliptic structure ( panel 1 ) , asymmetric and symmetric bimodal clusters ( panels 2 and 3 , respectively ) , cluster with filamentary structure ( panel 4 ) etc .",
    "the multi - modal clusters have clumps with different peak brightness .",
    "we show contour plots of toy models at different brightness levels where the choice of levels is arbitrary . for all clusters the outer line represents the percolation level at which substructures merge with one another forming a single , large system .",
    "multiplicity as a function of area ( in grid unit ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ toy_mul ] .",
    "as mentioned earlier @xmath26 is sensitive to the sizes of the substructures .",
    "the simplest case to check this is to take a bimodal cluster . for a bimodal structure with unequal sized sub - clumps ( panel 2 ) ,",
    "the fractional value of multiplicity ( @xmath52 ) tells us that the components of the system have different sizes .",
    "the isolated components eventually percolate giving @xmath53 at low brightness level , i. e , at larger area . on the other hand , for a cluster with equal components @xmath54 until percolation occurs ( panel 3 ) . for clusters with three components ( panels 4 and 5 ) ,",
    "we see that for a short range of brightness levels the components are well separated where two of these are bigger then the third one ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "afterwards two of the three clumps merge giving @xmath52 .",
    "these two remaining components eventually percolate to become a single system .",
    "the clumps in panel 6 are distributed around the center . for this cluster ,",
    "we see two unequal size but well separated clumps ( @xmath52 ) with same peak brightness .",
    "the behavior of clusters in panels 7 and 8 is similar except that they have different number of substructures .",
    "the cluster in panel 9 has the largest number of components ( a total of 7 ) .",
    "two of its clumps are so large compared to the other ones that they dominant mostly .",
    "the multiplicity is always in the range @xmath56 reflecting the merging of clumps at different levels .",
    "ellipticity as a function of area is shown in fig .",
    "[ toy_ell ] . in this figure",
    "the solid and dotted line represent , respectively , @xmath51 and @xmath50 . for the unimodal cluster in panel 1 , @xmath57 . for the bimodal cluster in panel 2 ,",
    "the estimate of @xmath50 gives an ellipticity weighted more by the larger component . in this case it is zero .",
    "however , for a bimodal system with equal sized sub - clumps but different elongation , @xmath50 will give an average elongation of the two .",
    "the estimate of @xmath42 , on the other hand , tells us about the overall shape of that system irrespective of the sizes and elongations of its sub - clumps . due to the presence of two isolated components",
    ", the system itself appears more elongated than the shape of its sub - clumps .    the important point to note that the estimate provided by @xmath42 depends not only on the relative sizes of the components but also on their relative separation .",
    "this is reflected in all panels containing multi - clump clusters . with the decrease of brightness ,",
    "as the clumps get bigger and appear close to one another , @xmath42 gets smaller .    for a multi - component system with filamentary structure , @xmath58 ( panel 4 ) . if components are distributed around the cluster center , @xmath59 ( panel 6 )",
    ". the cluster in panel 5 has the unique property that is shown separately by clusters in panel 4 and 6 . in transition from peak brightness to lower level",
    ", the cluster changes its filamentary shape to the one where the components are distributed over a region around the center .",
    "the @xmath51 profile in panel 8 shows that in the range , @xmath60 , the cluster develops two , almost equal size clumps that are very close to each other .",
    "cluster in panel 7 follows the behavior of a bimodal cluster except that there is jump in between @xmath61 where the cluster changes its structure having two unequal size clumps to two equal size clumps .",
    "the shape of the cluster in panel 9 changes consistently following the merging of its clumps at different brightness .",
    "we demonstrate the behaviors of @xmath26 and the variants of @xmath27 as a function of area for several simulated clusters ( figs .",
    "[ multip_area ] and [ ellip_area ] ) . for each sample",
    "we choose two clusters at each redshift for illustration purpose .",
    "we use dark and gray lines to represent matter and x - ray clusters , respectively .",
    "[ multip_area ] shows that both matter and x - ray clusters with cooling have higher number of sub - clumps than those without cooling .",
    "[ ellip_area ] shows that in most cases the central part of clusters consists of single peak ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "the central region of these clusters do not appear spherical . rather the region appears to have some degree of flattening .",
    "we see that multi - peak systems , mostly bimodal clusters with un - equal size sub - clumps ( @xmath63 ) , are not uncommon for these clusters . in low brightness levels , i. e. , in the outer regions of cluster , the sub - clumps appear to be homogeneously distributed ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "the objective of this paper is to study morphological evolution in simulated cluster using @xmath26 and @xmath27 as quantitative measures .",
    "the parameters represent the shape characteristics of a set of iso - intensity contours corresponding to a set of density / brightness levels .",
    "the levels represent equal interval in area ( i.e. size ) in log space .",
    "we select the range of area in between @xmath65 ( in grid unit ) with 100 intervals .",
    "the lower limit is to avoid the discreteness of the grid whereas the upper limit covers the significant part of the entire image of each cluster analyzed .",
    "in fact with this range we can analyze clusters from @xmath66 h@xmath24 kpc up to a distance @xmath67 h@xmath24 mpc .",
    "we do not smooth either the cluster image or its iso - intensity contours .",
    "the probability and cumulative distribution functions of these parameters determined from the cluster samples are shown in figs .",
    "[ adiabatic_m ] to [ radiative_e ] . in each of these figures",

    "earlier these parameters provide estimate averaged over 100 brightness levels .    from a visual examination of the distribution functions in figs .",
    "[ adiabatic_m ] to [ radiative_e ] one can notice an evolutionary trend in cluster morphology since the gross properties of clusters indeed change with redshifts",
    ". our goal is to determine the statistical significance of this trend and than compare it with the observation .",
    "we should mention that multiplicity as defined here had not been used before .",
    "it is , therefore , not possible to make a direct comparison with other studies or observations . as a result",
    "we will use only ellipticity for comparison with observations . we will explore the robustness and sensitivity of @xmath26 in our future work on sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) clusters .    to check whether or not the trend is significant , we have performed k - s test between cumulative functions at two different @xmath68 for each parameter .",
    "the test is repeated for all combinations of redshifts and the results are presented in the tables 1 to 4 where d and p represent the k - s statistic and significance level probability .",
    "the tables show test results only for those redshift combinations that may indicate a significant evolution , i. e. , only those results for which p @xmath69 .",

    "the evolution is less significant ( p @xmath74 ) .",
    "table 2 shows that the evolution of dark matter clusters in the cooling sample is stronger compared to the x - rays .",
    "the low significance is a reflection of less efficient merging in the x - ray gas .",
    "in fact in terms of @xmath37 , the x - ray clusters do not show any significant change in the distribution functions over redshift . for dark matter",

    "the distribution functions of ellipticities for both samples are shown in figs .",
    "[ adiabatic_e ] and [ radiative_e ] .",
    "we see that the x - ray clusters , in general , are more regular than those of dark matter .",
    "the x - ray gas evolves in the dark matter potential and due to the radiation pressure it is distributed homogeneously in the background . as a result",
    "the morphological characteristics of systems containing baryonic fluids will be more regular . for these clusters",
    "the irregular components are distributed over a region instead of concentrating along one direction making them appear regular .",
    "a comparison of @xmath48 with @xmath49 for dark matter clusters shows that the sub - clumps are not distributed homogeneously around the central region .",
    "rather these clumps are spread out mostly in one direction forming filamentary structure , as indicated by the larger value of @xmath49 .",
    "no significant evolution is signaled by @xmath48 either for matter or for x - ray clusters in the adiabatic sample ( table 3 ) .",
    "it indicates that the shape of individual components of a cluster at one redshift may appear similar at other redshifts .",
    "since @xmath48 puts emphasize on individual components , therefore , it is not unusual to see no evolution quantified by this parameter . in terms of @xmath49 , we see that the overall shapes of x - ray clusters do evolve from @xmath75 , @xmath76 towards @xmath71 ( p @xmath77 ) .",
    "the matter clusters , however , show less significant evolution ( p @xmath74 ) from @xmath75 to @xmath71 .    once again no evolution is signaled by @xmath48 for clusters with radiative cooling ( table 4 ) .",

    "we take projection along each axis at a time and repeat the k - s tests . recall that in this case sub - samples ( along each axis ) have 41 clusters in the adiabatic limit and 43 clusters with radiative cooling .",
    "the results of these sub - samples show insignificant variation from the bigger primary sample .",

    "the solid and dashed lines represent the best fit to the data given , respectively , by the median and the mean .",
    "we summarize our measurements in tables 5 and 6 .",
    "several conclusions can be drawn from these tables .",
    "first , the dark matter shows very similar evolution in both samples of clusters .",
    "second , the x - ray clusters in adiabatic simulation evolve faster than those with radiative cooling .",
    "third , the rate of ellipticity evolution is higher for x - ray clusters irrespective of cooling history .",
    "fourth , as far as the strength of evolution is concerned , multiplicity , especially @xmath37 , appears to be more sensitive indicator than ellipticity .",
    "we note that the measured quantities for the dark matter in the adiabatic and cooling cluster samples are very similar .",
    "this is a check on the consistency of the simulations and analysis .",
    "the result is expected as the n - body segment of the simulations are identical in the two cluster samples with the exception of the gas that has relatively minor contribution to the total gravitational potential .",
    "the lss of adiabatic and cooling clusters are generally similar but their small scale structures are dictated by the overall cluster properties rather than perturbative interactions ( motl et al .",
    "2003 ) . in adiabatic clusters infalling sub - clumps mix into the main cluster medium in a faster manner relative to the radiative cooling where sub - clusters can be long lived .",
    "this is the reason behind fast evolution of adiabatic x - ray clusters .",
    "the relaxation times scale for collisionless particles is much longer than that of the collisional gas particles ( frenk et al .",
    "1999 ; valdarnini , ghizzardi & bomometto 1999 ) .",
    "therefore matter clusters will appear not only more elongated than the x - ray gas distribution but the redshift evolution of their shapes will also be slow .",
    "more spherical configuration for x - ray clusters is also expected from the point of view that intracluster gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium whereas the dark matter is distributed like galaxies ( kolokotronis et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "fmm have analyzed the same sets of simulated clusters in the redshift range @xmath84 using eccentricity ( @xmath85 ) as the quantitative measure .",
    "the eccentricity is defined as , @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are eigenvalues of the inertia tensor ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "note that the eigenvalues are proportional to the square of the semi - axes of an ellipse .",
    "fmm used moment of inertia technique for an annular region to calculate @xmath85 .",
    "the size of the annulus is fixed either by r@xmath90 or r@xmath91 where r@xmath90 is the 1.5 @xmath92 mpc aperture and the r@xmath91 is the radius from cluster center up to a distance where the density is @xmath93 200 times the background .    to make a comparison with fmm , we measure eccentricity for our data sets . using both effective ( @xmath94 ) and aggregate ( @xmath95 )",
    "eccentricities , we find that 1 ) the results agree , at least , qualitatively in the slow evolution of simulated clusters and 2 ) both studies show that clusters without cooling evolve faster compared to those having radiative cooling in a @xmath4 dominated universe .",
    "however , we note two systematic differences between the results . first",
    ", our results show that matter distributions generally are more elongated than the x - ray gas whereas in fmm both of these systems have comparable eccentricities .",
    "as mentioned earlier the collisionless dark matter distribution relaxed in longer time than the hot gas , it seems unlikely that both systems will have comparable flattening within the same cosmological time slot ( i. e. , @xmath0 ) .",
    "second , at each redshift our estimates are higher compared to those of fmm .",
    "fmm focuses mainly to determine the shape in the outer region of galaxy - clusters .",
    "our method , on the other hand , measures shapes from the central regions towards the edge of clusters ( up to @xmath67 h@xmath24 mpc ) . in cluster morphology",
    "it is important to know which part of a cluster needs to be analyzed that will give a realistic estimate of its shape .",
    "for example , to study clusters with cool core one should include the central region in the analysis to see to what extent it influences the overall shape since cooling is is a small scale phenomenon that occurs within 100 to 200 h@xmath24 kpc of cluster center . emphasizing only on the outer part for cool core clusters , therefore ,",
    "may not reflect the estimate of actual shape .",
    "clusters with or without cooling appear to be more elongated around the central region ( see fig . [ ellip_area ] ; note that a similar trend in simulated cluster without cooling has also been reported by jing & suto 2002 ) . since we estimate an average eccentricity , our result is weighted more by the large flattening around the central part . the difference in results is , therefore , a reflection of different methodology .",

    "this sample is slightly better than the mcm since it has clusters with higher redshift . besides , @xmath98 clusters of this sample are also present in the mcm .",
    "the rate of evolution for this sample is @xmath99 .",
    "however , if both are combined , replacing the common ones by the apm clusters , the rate increases . the combined sample of @xmath100 optical clusters with @xmath97 shows @xmath101 .",
    "it is rare to find a large sample of x - ray clusters with up - to - date ellipticity measure .",
    "we use the sample of mcm that is compiled from mcmillan , kowalski & ulmer ( 1989 ) and kolokotronis et al .",
    "it only has 48 clusters with @xmath1 which is three times smaller than the mcm optical sample and an order of magnitude smaller than the apm .",
    "it also has low redshift limit than the apm .",
    "the rate of evolution for this sample is @xmath102 .",
    "the result suggests faster evolution for x - ray clusters than the opticals .",
    "although the result is in accordance with our expectation , we should not make any definite conclusion because of the size of the sample .",
    "a large sample of x - ray clusters with better selection criteria and extended over wide redshift is needed to be conclusive .",
    "we reanalyze the apm clusters and the combined sample imposing redshift cutoff @xmath1 in order to have redshift range consistent with the mcm x - ray sample .",
    "these samples show , respectively , @xmath103 and @xmath104 . even though evolution of optical clusters gets faster in this redshift range , it is still slower than that of the x - rays .",
    "when we compare the rate of evolution between simulated and observed cluster ellipticity , we find slower evolution in simulations . in spite of this , it is interesting that the simulation is able to capture the essence of reality : faster evolution of gas than the dark matter distribution .",
    "numerical simulations provide an unique opportunity to understand the underlying physics of structure formation . in order to be representative of the real world",
    ", the results from simulations should agree with observations .",
    "observations provide evidence of morphological evolution in galaxy - clusters ( melott , chambers & miller 2001 ; plionis 2002 ; jeltema et al .",
    "2003 ) , simulations should show similar evolution . with this in mind , we have studied redshift evolution of cluster morphology simulated , respectively , in the adiabatic limit and with radiative cooling .    since observed clusters are projected along the line of sight and lack of full 3 dimensional information we , therefore , use projected simulated clusters .",
    "each cluster image is within a 8 h@xmath24 mpc frame containing 360 @xmath25 360 pixels .",
    "the clusters are analyzed at 100 different density / brightness levels using multiplicity and ellipticity as two different probes to quantify morphological evolution .",
    "our results show that if cluster shapes are quantified by ellipticity , than simulations do not model the observed local universe well enough .",
    "the results indicate that the simulated clusters do evolve with redshift but the evolution is slower than the observed one .",
    "the outcome of our analyses , however , should be taken with a caution since the measurements from different samples do not agree to be conclusive on the slower evolution .",
    "take , for example , the optical clusters for @xmath1 : the apm sample shows @xmath103 , whereas the mcm sample shows @xmath105 .",
    "a recent study by flin , krywult & biernacka ( 2004 ; hereafter fkb ) reports very weak evolution for a sample of 246 aco clusters for redshift range @xmath106 .",
    "they analyze clusters at five different annular radii and the mean of these estimates shows @xmath107 . for @xmath1 ,",
    "their result also indicates weak evolution ( flin , 2004 ) . in terms of ellipticity , therefore , we can see clearly from table 5 and 6 that the evolution is slower for both sets of simulations with respect to the apm sample but it is stronger compared to both mcm and fkb .",
    "a preliminary analysis of a sample of 800 clusters constructed from the sdss shows that ellipticity evolution of optical clusters within @xmath1 is weaker than that of the apm clusters .",
    "the result also shows that clusters with different mass limits evolves differently .",
    "large , massive clusters ( @xmath108 ) have stronger evolution compared to the less massive clusters ( @xmath109 ) ( miller 2004 ) .",
    "the sample is uniform with a well documented selection function and high degree of completeness .",
    "if this is the case then we can infer that the cluster samples mentioned above have less uniformity in mass range : the apm catalogue is biased towards the massive cluster and both mcm and fkb samples contain less massive clusters .",
    "note that we have checked the evolution in simulated clusters with the mass limits as mentioned above but have not found any difference .",
    "the discrepancy in the optical samples is an indication of different selection criteria used to construct the catalogues .",
    "larger and more complete catalogues obtained from sloan digital sky survey and xmm - newton survey may be able to shed more light into this issue .",
    "it is also likely that numerical simulations may lack crucial physics that needs to be included ( see fmm for discussion ) . in the forthcoming paper in this series",
    "we will analyze cluster samples simulated with various gas physics , for example , star formation and feedback from supernovae explosion .",
    "the result of that study may give some clue to gain better insight of the discrepancy .",
    "finally , our result indicates that multiplicity ( @xmath37 ) indicates relatively stronger evolution in cluster morphology compared to ellipticity this particular result suggests that it is a more sensitive parameter than ellipticity ( see also thomas et al .",
    "1998 ; suwa et al .",
    ". we will further explore the sensitivity of this measure in our future work on simulation and observed clusters .",
