    "the application of statistical mechanical methods to the dynamics of individual motile objects started shortly @xcite after einstein s work on brownian motion  @xcite . recently , the _ collective _ behavior of systems consisting of interacting self - propelled particles attracted interest @xcite . an important motivation for studying ` active ' systems is to understand spectacular dynamics observed in assemblies of living systems , such as coherent motion @xcite .",
    "a more fundamental motivation stems from the nonequilibrium nature of active systems that are driven by internal , non - thermal self - propulsion forces , which represents a difficult challenge for statistical physics .",
    "the behavior of such systems may defy our equilibrium - based physical intuition , as demonstrated by large - scale collective motion in persistent hard disk systems  @xcite , and the emergence of dynamic clustering  @xcite , phase separation  @xcite , and nonequilibrium equation of state  @xcite in repulsive self - propelled particles .",
    "active particles may also exhibit behavior similar to that found in equilibrium systems , such as crystallization @xcite .",
    "this behavior suggests that , like thermal systems @xcite , dense active systems could possibly be supercooled and exhibit glassy dynamics ; as recently argued theoretically on the basis of a simple driven glassy model  @xcite .",
    "this study was followed by numerical investigations of active particles with hard - core @xcite or continuous @xcite interactions .",
    "active glassy dynamics was observed , but when compared with thermal systems , the onset of glassy behavior was always pushed towards higher densities and lower temperatures . when self - propulsion is progressively added to an otherwise thermal system , it was noted that the local structure becomes less pronounced @xcite .",
    "such change in local structure suggests both a simple physical explanation for the shift of the onset of glassy behavior , and that a straightforward extension of mode - coupling theory @xcite can describe this shift @xcite .    here",
    "we present a simulational and theoretical study of the structure and glassy dynamics of a more complex system in which _ self - propulsion is the only source of motion_. we study self - propelled particles interacting with a continuous potential ( differently from @xcite ) and without thermal brownian motion ( differently from @xcite ) .",
    "thus , our model is ` athermal '  @xcite , and the degree of nonequilibrium is quantified by the persistence time @xmath0 of the self - propulsion . as @xmath0 increases at a constant effective temperature , we find that the structure of the system becomes more pronounced , whereas the dynamics initially speeds up and then slows down , showing that in our model the shift of the glassy dynamics with self - propulsion is not simply the direct consequence of the changing microstructure @xcite .    to elucidate these findings we develop a microscopic theory that accounts for the nonequilibrium nature of athermal self - propelled systems .",
    "we are aware of no other approach where many - body interactions are taken into account at the microscopic level .",
    "the theory is constructed from the steady state structure factor and the steady state correlations of the velocities .",
    "the latter correlations are non - trivial only for self - propelled systems with a finite persistence time , and are central to explain the opposite , and seemingly contradictory , evolution of the structure and dynamics in dense active materials .",
    "we study a system of interacting self - propelled particles in a viscous medium .",
