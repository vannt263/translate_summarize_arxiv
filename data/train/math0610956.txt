    "[ sec : intro ]    we show that a hamiltonian diffeomorphism of a closed symplectically aspherical manifold has infinitely many periodic points .",
    "more precisely , we prove that such a diffeomorphism with finitely many fixed points has simple periodic points of arbitrarily large period .",
    "for tori , this fact , recently established by hingston , @xcite , was conjectured by conley , @xcite and is frequently referred to as the _ conley conjecture_. ( see also @xcite and references therein for similar results for hamiltonian diffeomorphisms and homeomorphisms of surfaces . ) the proof given here uses some crucial ideas from  @xcite , but is completely self - contained .",
    "the main result of the paper is    [ thm : main ] let @xmath0 be a hamiltonian diffeomorphism of a closed symplectically aspherical manifold @xmath1 .",
    "assume that the fixed points of @xmath2 are isolated .",
    "then @xmath2 has simple periodic points of arbitrarily large period .",
    "we refer the reader to section [ sec : general ] for the definitions . here",
    "we only point out that a hamiltonian diffeomorphism is the time - one map of a time - dependent hamiltonian flow and that the manifolds @xmath1 with @xmath3 ( e.g. , tori and surfaces of genus greater than zero ) are among symplectically aspherical manifolds .",
    "thus , theorem [ thm : main ] implies in particular the conley conjecture for tori , @xcite , and the results of @xcite on hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of such surfaces .",
    "[ cor : main ] a hamiltonian diffeomorphism @xmath2 of a closed symplectically aspherical manifold has infinitely many simple periodic points .",
    "the example of an irrational rotation of @xmath4 shows that in general the requirement that @xmath1 is symplectically aspherical can not be completely eliminated ; see , however , @xcite .",
    "let @xmath5 be a periodic in time hamiltonian giving rise to @xmath2 .",
    "since periodic points of @xmath2 are in one - to - one correspondence with periodic orbits of the time - dependent hamiltonian flow @xmath6 , theorem [ thm : main ] and corollary [ cor : main ] can be viewed as results about periodic orbits of @xmath5 .",
    "then , in both of the statements , the periodic orbits can be assumed to be contractible .",
    "( it is not hard to see that contractibility is a property of a fixed point rather than of an orbit , independent of the choice of @xmath5 . )",
    "finally note that , as simple examples show , the assumption of theorem [ thm : main ] that the fixed points of @xmath2 are isolated can not be dropped as long as the periodic orbits are required to be contractible .",
    "there are numerous parallels between the hamiltonian conley conjecture considered here and its lagrangian counterpart ; see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein .",
    "the similarity between the two problems goes beyond the obvious analogy of the statements and can also easily be seen on the level of the proofs , although the methods utilized in @xcite are quite different from the floer homological techniques used in the present paper .",
    "thus , for instance , our proposition [ prop2 ] plays the same role as bangert s homological vanishing method originating from @xcite in , e.g. , @xcite .      in the framework of symplectic topology",
    ", there are two essentially different approaches to proving results along the lines of the conley conjecture .    the first approach , due to conley and salamon and zehnder , @xcite , is based on an iteration formula for the conley",
    " zehnder index , asserting that the index of an isolated weakly non - degenerate orbit either grows linearly under iterations or its absolute value does not exceed @xmath7 , where @xmath8 .",
    "this , in particular , implies that the local floer homology of such an orbit eventually becomes zero in degree @xmath9 as the order of iteration grows , provided that the orbit remains isolated .",
    "( we refer the reader to sections [ sec : prelim ] and [ sec : lfh ] for the definitions .",
    "the argument of salamon and zehnder , @xcite , does not rely on the notion of local floer homology , but this notion becomes indispensable in the proof of theorem [ thm : main ] . )",
    "since the floer homology of @xmath1 in degree @xmath9 is non - zero , it follows that when all one - periodic orbits are weakly non - degenerate , new simple orbits must be created by large prime iterations to generate the floer homology in degree @xmath9 ; see @xcite for details .",
    "the second approach comprises a broad class of methods and is based on the idea that a hamiltonian @xmath5 with sufficiently large variation must have one - periodic orbits with non - vanishing action . since iterating a hamiltonian diffeomorphism @xmath2 has the same effect as , roughly speaking , increasing the variation of @xmath5 , one can expect @xmath2 to have infinitely many periodic points .",
    "when a sufficiently accurate upper or lower bound on the action is available , the orbits can be shown to be simple .",
    "the results obtained along these lines are numerous and use a variety of symplectic topological techniques and assumptions on @xmath1 and @xmath5 .    for instance , if the support of @xmath5 is displaceable and the variation of @xmath5 is greater than the displacement energy @xmath10 of the support , one - periodic orbits with action in the range @xmath11 $ ] have been shown to exist for many classes of symplectic manifolds and hamiltonians ; see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "then , the _ a priori _ bound on action implies the existence of simple periodic orbits with non - zero action and arbitrarily large period .",
    "these methods do not rely on particular requirements on the fixed points of @xmath2 , but the assumption that the support is displaceable appears at this moment to be crucial . within",
    "this broad class is also a group of methods applicable to hamiltonians @xmath5 with sufficiently degenerate large or `` flat '' maximum and detecting orbits with action slightly greater than the maximum of @xmath5 ; see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "iterating @xmath2 can be viewed as stretching @xmath5 near its maximum , and thus increasing its variation .",
    "hence , methods from this group can also be used in some instances to prove the existence of simple periodic orbits of large period . here the condition that the maximum is in a certain sense flat is crucial , but the assumption that the support of the hamiltonian is displaceable is less important and , in some cases , not required at all .",
    "in fact , what appears to matter is that the set where the maximum is attained is relatively small ( e.g. , symplectic as in @xcite or displaceable as in @xcite or just isolated as in @xcite ) .",
    "it is one of these methods , combined with the conley ",
    "zehnder approach , that we use in the proof of the conley conjecture .",
    "a work of hingston @xcite clearly suggests the idea , which is central to our proof , that the two approaches outlined above can be extended to cover the case of an arbitrary hamiltonian .",
    "namely , the method of @xcite detects infinitely many simple periodic points of arbitrarily large periods , unless there exists a strongly degenerate @xmath12-periodic point @xmath13 such that the local floer homology groups of the @xmath12-th iteration @xmath14 and of a large iteration of @xmath14 at @xmath13 are non - zero in degree @xmath9 ; see section [ sec : proof ]",
    ". then we show ( proposition [ prop1 ] ) that the @xmath15 is the time-@xmath12 flow of a @xmath12-periodic hamiltonian , say @xmath16 , such that @xmath13 is a ( constant ) local maximum of @xmath16 for all @xmath17 and this maximum is in a certain sense very degenerate ; cf .",
    "( however , the hessian @xmath18 need not be identically zero . )",
    "finally , we prove ( proposition [ prop2 ] ) that large iterations of @xmath5 have periodic orbits with actions arbitrarily close to the action of the iterated hamiltonian at @xmath13 .",
    "these orbits are necessarily simple due to the lower and upper bounds on the action .",
    "proposition [ prop2 ] is established by using a simple squeezing argument akin to the ones from @xcite .",
    "this concludes the proof of the theorem .",
    "this argument is extremely flexible and readily extends to manifolds convex at infinity or geometrically bounded and wide ; see @xcite and @xcite for the definitions",
    ". we will give a detailed proof of the conley conjecture for such manifolds elsewhere .",
    "in section [ sec : prelim ] , we set notation and conventions , briefly review elements of floer theory , and also discuss the properties of loops of hamiltonian diffeomorphisms relevant to the proof .",
    "local floer homology is the subject of section [ sec : lfh ] . in section [ sec :",
    "proof ] , we state propositions [ prop1 ] and [ prop2 ] mentioned above and derive theorem [ thm : main ] from these propositions .",
    "proposition [ prop1 ] reduces the problem to the case of a hamiltonian with strict , but `` flat '' , local maximum .",
    "this proposition is proved in sections [ sec : pr - prop1 ] and [ sec : gf ] by adapting an argument from @xcite .",
