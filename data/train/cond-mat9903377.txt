    "this work investigates theoretically the lifetime of single particle excitations due to electron - electron ( _ e - e _ ) interaction in atoms .",
    "in particular we are interested in the manifestation of this lifetime in the measured spectrum .",
    "although a large atom and a quantum dot ( qd ) may contain a similar number of electrons , their spectral characteristics are very different .",
    "in qds the level broadening by _ e - e _ interaction severely limits the number of discrete single particle levels .",
    "for example , sivan _",
    "et al._@xcite were able to resolve only @xmath0 discrete levels in the excitation spectrum of a diffusive qd containing about @xmath1 electrons . in atoms on the other hand ,",
    "hundreds of spectral lines have been measured and tabulated , with no appreciable effect of _ e - e _ interaction on level widths . hence , the effect of _ e - e _ interaction seems to be very different in these two systems , and this work attempts to understand the roots of this difference .",
    "we do not intend to obtain exact results for a specific atom , but rather to develop a general understanding of how atomic spectra are influenced by _",
    "e - e _ interaction in comparison with qds .    atoms and",
    "qds both contain a comparable number of interacting electrons in a confined volume .",
    "however , they differ in size , symmetry and confining potential .",
    "the latter are typically larger , possess no particular symmetry , and are confined by a sharper potential .",
    "we find that the different spectral characteristics of these two systems are primarily due to the different confining potentials .",
    "we focus our attention on excited atomic states in which one electron is excited to a weakly bound state , while the other electrons remain in their ground state configuration .",
    "the excited electron then occupies a hydrogen - like orbital , whose spatial extent is much larger than that of the remaining electrons .",
    "the excited electron is subject to the coulomb potential of the rest of the atom ( which we refer to as `` ion '' ) .",
    "this interaction is divided into a static potential ( averaged over ionic degrees of freedom ) and a residual interaction . to calculate the lifetime of an excited atomic state",
    ", we consider the residual interaction acting on the excited electron in the confining potential of the ion .",
    "the ionic spectrum of alkali atoms is characterized by a large gap ( on the order of the ionization energy ) at the ground state . as a result , single particle excitations are , to good approximation",
    ", eigenstates of the atom , and no level broadening due to _ e - e _ interaction is expected .",
    "complex atoms with a number of valence electrons are different .",
    "typically , there are several open shells with many single particle states of similar binding energies .",
    "the corresponding number of many - body states , @xmath2 , is hence exponentially large .",
    "we find that the interaction matrix elements are @xmath3 , while the relevant density of states is @xmath4 .",
    "consequently , for large @xmath2 the matrix elements of the residual interaction are larger than the level spacing of the spectrum to which the excited state is coupled .",
    "the use of fermi s golden rule is hence justified .",
    "the resulting level width is independent of @xmath2 , and typically smaller than the single - particle level spacing@xcite .",
    "the different effect of _ e - e _ interaction in complex atoms and qds can be qualitatively understood in the following way .",
    "the scattering rate is proportional to the residual interaction matrix element squared times the density of final states ( relaxed electron plus excited ion ) . in qds , due to the sharp confining potential , the matrix elements are on the average only weakly dependent on energy .",
    "the density of final states is proportional to the excitation energy squared .",
    "the resulting scattering rates grow with energy and eventually exceed the fairly constant single particle level spacing . in complex atoms , due to the shallow confining potential , the radius of the excited electron s orbit grows rapidly with energy leading to suppressed matrix elements and diminishing _ e - e _ scattering rates .",
    "the decrease of _ e - e _ scattering rates as a function of excitation energy is in sharp contrast to the corresponding trend in qds and fermi liquids .",
    "the hydrogen - like single particle level spacing is also reduced with energy , but slower than the scattering rates .",
    "consequently , in complex atoms the discrete nature of the spectrum is preserved .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section ( [ sec - measure ] )",
    "we define _ e - e _ lifetime of single particle excitations and discuss its meaning in a finite system .",
    "we consider in particular the manifestation of _ e - e _ lifetime in a spectroscopic measurement . in section ( [ sec - ee lifetime ] ) we estimate the _ e - e _ lifetime of single particle excitations in atoms .",
    "we distinguish between alkali atoms for which we find no broadening due to _ e - e _ interaction , and complex atoms for which such broadening may occur .",
    "finally , in section ( [ sec - con ] ) we compare our results for _ e - e _ lifetime in atoms to previous results concerning _ e - e _ lifetime in qds .",
    "consider an isolated , @xmath5-electron system in its ground state , @xmath6 , and an excited state , @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are single particle creation and annihilation operators respectively . in the absence of interaction",
    ", @xmath10 is an eigenstate , and therefore characterized by an infinite lifetime . in the presence of interaction ,",
    "it is no longer an eigenstate and decays with time .",
    "the _ e - e _ lifetime , denoted by @xmath11 , is defined as the decay time of the initial state , @xmath12 this analysis assumes zero temperature .",
    "generalization to finite temperature is straightforward .",
    "the meaning of _ e - e _ lifetime in a system characterized by a discrete energy spectrum , such as an atom below the ionization threshold or a qd , should be clarified .",
    "let @xmath13 be a basis of exact eigenstates of the system with energies @xmath14 .",
    "the initial state can be expressed as a superposition of these eigenstates , @xmath15 the time evolution of the initial state is given by , @xmath16 and the probability to remain in the initial state at time @xmath17 is , @xmath18 strictly speaking , as opposed to the case of a continuous spectrum , here there is no decay of the probability to remain in the initial state .",
    "this probability oscillates , and for long enough times it can get arbitrarily close to @xmath19 ( it can return exactly to @xmath19 if the energy spectrum is commensurate ) .",
    "nevertheless , as the number of dominant terms in ( [ eq : decomposition ] ) increases , it takes longer for the initial state to reconstruct .",
    "the typical time scale for this reconstruction is the rabi - time , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the average many - body level spacing . on shorter time",
    "scales the probability effectively decays exponentially with time .",
    "consequently , we define the _ e - e _ lifetime in a finite system as in ( [ eq : sp lifetime ] ) , keeping in mind the restriction on the time scales @xmath22 .",
    "the _ e - e _ lifetime of a single particle excitation can be estimated using fermi s golden rule .",
    "the full interacting hamiltonian @xmath23 is divided into an unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath24 , which may include part of the e - e interaction ( for example , the hartree or hartree - fock part ) , and a perturbation hamiltonian @xmath25 which includes the rest of the _ e - e _ interaction .",
    "let @xmath26 be the @xmath5-particle eigenstates of @xmath24 with eigenenergies @xmath27 .",
    "the golden rule result for the _ e - e _ lifetime of a single particle excitation @xmath28 is , @xmath29 the sum in ( [ eq : gr ] ) extends over all n - particle eigenstates of @xmath24 other than the initial one .",
    "following @xcite , we arrange the eigenstates of the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath24 in the form of a hierarchal tree emanating from the ground state of @xmath24 .",
    "the first generation includes all eigenstates of @xmath24 which are coupled by the interaction to the ground state , in particular single particle excitations ( as in ( [ eq : sp excitation ] ) ) are included .",
    "each generation includes all eigenstates of @xmath24 not previously incorporated in the tree which are connected by non - vanishing interaction matrix elements to the previous generation .",
    "the problem of _ e - e _ lifetime of single particle excitations can be mapped on the problem of anderson localization on the hierarchal tree , described by a hamiltonian @xmath30 .",
    "each eigenstate @xmath31 of @xmath24 is a site in the hierarchal tree with an on - site energy @xmath32 .",
    "the hopping amplitude between two sites is given by the corresponding residual interaction matrix element .",
    "the single particle spectrum of @xmath30 on the hierarchal tree is equivalent to the many - body spectrum of @xmath24 .",
    "an excitation of the type ( [ eq : sp excitation ] ) corresponds to a single site on the lattice .",
    "its time evolution is determined by the overlap of this site with exact eigenstates of @xmath33 .",
    "an overlap of this site with extended states leads to exponential decay , while overlap limited to localized states leads to beating of few frequencies .",
    "we now turn to discuss how _ e - e _ lifetime of single particle excitations is manifested in the measured many - electron spectrum of a quantum dot or an atom . a finite , isolated , fermi system has discrete energy levels of zero width , which correspond to _ exact _ many - body eigenstates of the system .",
    "a spectroscopic measurement involves coupling the system to some external measuring device .",
    "typically , the measurement operators are single electron ones . as a result",
    ", only many - body eigenstates with finite overlap with single particle excitations can be detected .",
    "consider a specific example , an optical absorption experiment on a many - electron system in its ground state @xmath34 .",
    "the measurement operator in this case is given by , @xmath35 where @xmath36 are coefficients ( including matrix elements of photon operators ) determining the strength of the coupling to various single particle excitations .",
    "the absorption of the system is characterized by the spectral function , @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are exact final many - body eigenstates and eigenenergies of the system , and @xmath40 is the ground state energy of the system . in the absence of",
    "_ e - e _ interaction , @xmath41 exhibits a series of @xmath42-peaks corresponding to single particle excitations of the system .",
    "e - e _ interaction is included , each single particle excitation becomes a superposition of several exact many - body eigenstates .",
    "the spectral function then displays many more absorption peaks corresponding to many - body eigenstates that overlap with single particle excitations .",
    "a many - body eigenstate can overlap several single particle excitations , which then generate interfering contributions to its absorption peak .    a significant simplification of the spectral function and its relation to the concept of _ e - e _ scattering rate is obtained by assuming that each many - body state @xmath43 overlaps with at most one single particle excitation , an approximation equivalent to the reduction of the hierarchal tree into a cayley tree@xcite .",
    "this approximation is valid when the _ intra_-generation matrix elements are negligible , or when the single particle level spacing is much larger than the resulting _ e - e _ broadening . within this approximation ,",
    "the intensity of peaks having significant overlap with a particular single - particle excitation @xmath44 is approximated by @xmath45 .",
    "the relative intensity of all @xmath42-peaks @xmath38 associated with this single particle excitation is proportional to @xmath46 .",
    "the factor @xmath47 is common to all of them .",
    "consider the time evolution of a system initially in a state , @xmath48 , @xmath49 the _ e - e _ scattering rate is determined by the energy spread of exact many - body eigenstates , @xmath38 , that participate in the sum ( [ eq : time ] ) , provided there are many such states .",
    "these many - body eigenstates are exactly those that generate the absorption peaks associated with @xmath50 in the spectral function .",
    "e - e _ scattering rate of a single particle excitation is manifested in the energy width of the cluster of absorption peaks associated with it in the spectral function .    in a real experiment",
    "the resolution of the measuring device is finite .",
    "the measured many - body spectrum is smeared , so that each @xmath42-peak in the spectral function appears as a broadened peak .",
    "this broadening may have a typical scale larger than the many - body level spacing . in this case , the many - body eigenstates can no longer be resolved in the spectrum .",
    "then , a cluster of @xmath42-peaks associated with a given single particle excitation appears as a broad single particle resonance whose width is equal to the inverse _ e - e _ lifetime of the excitation .",
    "single particle resonances can be resolved as long as their broadening is smaller than the single particle level spacing .",
    "when the broadening of single - particle resonances exceeds the single - particle level spacing , the measured spectrum becomes essentially continuous .",
    "in this section we investigate the _ e - e _ lifetime of single particle excitations in atoms or ions below the ionization threshold@xcite .",
    "we consider an atom ( or ion ) composed of a fixed nucleus with charge @xmath51 and @xmath5 electrons .",
    "the full non - relativistic hamiltonian of such a system is , @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the momentum and position operators of the electrons , respectively , @xmath55 is the electron s mass and @xmath56 is the electron s charge .",
    "since an exact solution to the full hamiltonian is generally not known , one resorts to approximation methods .",
    "a standard approximation is the replacement of the full hamiltonian by a single particle hamiltonian that includes an effective potential induced by the average electron density ( e.g. the hartree approximation ) .",
    "the resulting single particle spectrum is degenerate due to spherical symmetry , leading to the well known shell structure of atoms .",
    "the degeneracy in the single particle spectrum leads to a much larger degeneracy in the many - body spectrum .",
    "for example , the ground state configuration of an europium atom includes @xmath57 electrons in an open f - shell .",
    "the @xmath58-fold single particle degeneracy of an f - shell , yields a @xmath59-fold degeneracy in the non - interacting many - body ground state . within such degenerate subspaces",
    "the interaction matrix elements are in many cases comparable or larger than the many - body level spacing . as a result ,",
    "_ e - e _ interaction has significant effect on the many - body eigenstates and eigenenergies .",
    "this is demonstrated in the numerical calculations of the eigenstates and eigenenergies of a cerium atom by flambaum _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "thus , in a perturbative calculation of _ e - e _ lifetime most of the interaction has to be included in the unperturbed hamiltonian , @xmath24 , which is no longer a simple sum of single particle hamiltonians .",
    "we consider the _ e - e _ lifetime of high energy single particle excitations ( but still below the ionization threshold ) . as a result the excited electron spends most of the time in regions where the density of the other electrons is exponentially small .",
    "two major simplifications can hence be made ,    1 .",
    "the exchange integral between the excited electron and the rest of the electrons is exponentially small and can be neglected .",
    "the excited electron can therefore be considered distinguishable from other electrons .",
    "the excited electron is subject to a potential which is roughly that of a hydrogen atom .",
    "its wavefunction may then be approximated by the corresponding hydrogenic one , except for s - shell electrons that penetrate into the ion .",
    "the atom is divided in our treatment into an excited ( distinguishable ) electron and an ion containing all other electrons and the nucleus .",
    "the hilbert space is spanned by direct products of the ionic states and the excited electron states .",
    "the unperturbed hamiltonian is , @xmath60 @xmath61 is the full hamiltonian of the ion , and @xmath62 is the effective single particle hamiltonian of the excited electron which includes an effective potential @xmath63 induced by the nucleus and the spherically averaged ionic ground state electron density . in regions exterior to the ionic electron density , the effective potential experienced by the excited electron is simply @xmath64 .",
    "the perturbation hamiltonian is , @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the density operator of the @xmath67 electrons of the ion , and @xmath68 is its fluctuating part .",
    "@xmath69 refers to the ionic ground state , and @xmath70 is the position operator of the excited electron .    the golden rule is now employed to the calculation of the lifetime of an excited electron due to the residual coupling @xmath71 with the rest of the electrons .",
    "we first consider the relevant density of states and the interaction matrix elements .",
    "the density of states of @xmath24 , @xmath72 , is a convolution of the density of states of the excited electron , @xmath73 , and the density of states of the ion , @xmath74 , @xmath75 where all energies are measured relative to the ground state . in order to study the spectrum of @xmath24 ,",
    "we first examine the single particle spectrum of the atom within the thomas - fermi model , which gives a fairly good picture of a large enough atom .",
    "we later consider the characteristics of the many - body spectrum of the ion and the effect of _ e - e _ interaction .      the thomas - fermi model ( tf )",
    "( see e.g. @xcite ) is a self - consistent single particle model used to obtain the approximate ground state electron density of an atom from which an effective single particle potential is calculated .",
    "here , we use it to estimate the density of states for excitations above the atomic ground state .",
    "the tf effective potential in a neutral atom is the solution of the tf equation , @xmath76 with , @xmath77 here , @xmath78 is the chemical potential and @xmath79 is the bohr radius .",
    "we define , as customary , @xmath80 with these definitions , the tf equation reduces to , @xmath81 this non - linear differential equation is solved numerically@xcite , and we denote its solution by @xmath82 .",
    "since the equation and its boundary conditions are independent of @xmath51 , so must be its solution @xmath82 .",
    "the tf potential is given by , @xmath83 asymptotically , @xmath84 the length scale @xmath85 characterizes screening in a tf atom .",
    "an obvious flaw in the tf potential is that it includes the electrostatic self - interaction of the electron .",
    "this has a noticeable effect at large distances where the electron is essentially outside the ionic charge distribution , and therefore experiences a potential @xmath86 , rather than @xmath87 as obtained from the tf model .",
    "the tf potential can be modified to correct this erroneous result in various ways@xcite leading to , @xmath88 the modification to the potential is important for the excited electron we consider , since it spends most of its time at distances larger than @xmath89 from the nucleus .",
    "the ionization energy of the atom is the difference between the chemical potential of a neutral atom ( @xmath90 ) , and that of an ion ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "to lowest order in @xmath92 , the ionization energy is constant and given by@xcite , @xmath93 the ionization energy is approximately the same for all atoms .",
    "this result does not account for the irregular variation of @xmath94 as a function of @xmath51 arising from the shell structure .",
    "the single particle density of states of a tf atom is obtained by numerically solving the schredinger equation with @xmath95 .",
    "alternatively , the single particle density of states can be calculated in the semiclassical approximation employed in the derivation of the tf equation .",
    "since we are interested only in the approximated density of states@xcite , the semiclassical approach is sufficient .",
    "the density of states of a free 3d fermi gas enclosed in a volume @xmath96 is given by @xmath97 . to obtain the density of states in a tf atom with a space dependent potential we use the expression for the free fermi gas locally , replacing @xmath98 by @xmath99 at each point .",
    "integrating over space we obtain the single particle density of states in the semiclassical approximation , @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the classically accessible radius given by @xmath102 .    introducing explicit z - dependence and using the definition of @xmath103 in ( [ eq : x ] )",
    "we obtain , @xmath104 @xmath105 is the solution of @xmath106 , hence @xmath107 .",
    "we find that @xmath108 obeys the following scaling rule , @xmath109 where @xmath110 stands for the integral appearing in ( [ eq : gtf(e , z ) ] ) .",
    "consider the single particle density of states at energies comparable to the ionization energy , @xmath111 , since only electrons in this energy range participate in real scattering processes contributing to the _ e - e _ lifetime of excitations below the ionization threshold .",
    "we refer to such electrons as _ active _ electrons . in order to evaluate the tf single particle density of states , @xmath108 , for @xmath112",
    ", we divide the spatial integration in ( [ eq : tf dos ] ) into two parts :    a. : :    * core ( @xmath113 ) * - in this region    @xmath114 , and    @xmath115 . the contribution of this    region to @xmath116",
    "can thus be approximated by ,    @xmath117 the physical meaning of this is that for large    @xmath51 the core electrons lie deep in the atomic potential    well , and their contribution to the single particle density of states    at high energies is negligible .",
    "b. : :    * outer shell ( @xmath118 ) * - substituting the    asymptotic expression for the potential ,    @xmath119 , valid for @xmath120 , we    obtain , @xmath121    thus , the tf model indicates that most electrons belong to the core , and only a small number of them ( @xmath122 ) are active . for a neutral atom",
    "the number of active electrons is estimated by , @xmath123 the contribution of the core electrons to @xmath124 is @xmath125 , so for large atoms @xmath126 is composed solely of electrons from the outer shell .",
    "the results of numerical calculation of @xmath124 are shown in figure ( [ fig - neff(z ) ] ) , for @xmath51 values characteristic of real atoms . indeed",
    "in this range ( @xmath128 ) , @xmath126 is found to be roughly proportional to @xmath129 .",
    "however , within the tf model , @xmath124 does not diverge as @xmath130 .",
    "rather it is upper bounded@xcite by , @xmath131 for large enough @xmath51 the number of active electrons in a tf atom is constant , independent of @xmath51 .",
    "there are , however , no real atoms with large enough @xmath51 to check this prediction experimentally .    for a particular atom ,",
    "the actual number of active electrons , @xmath132 , depends irregularly on @xmath51 due to the shell structure .",
    "the number of electrons in the ground state configuration with single particle energy @xmath133 , according to a hartree - fock - slater calculation@xcite , is compared with @xmath124 in figure ( [ fig - neff(z ) ] ) .",
    "it is @xmath132 and not @xmath124 , which determines the spectra of different atoms .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath124 gives a rough estimate for @xmath132 , and leads us to the important observation that this number is @xmath122 .",
    "the tf model suggests that the single particle density of states of an atom ( or ion ) is finite at the atomic fermi energy , even for @xmath134 .",
    "however , because of the degeneracy of the single particle spectrum and the importance of _ e - e _ interaction , the characteristics of the many - body spectrum vary strongly between atoms .",
    "we recall that the density of states of @xmath24 is a convolution of the density of states of the excited electron , @xmath135 , and the ionic many - body density of states , @xmath136 .",
    "apart from the few lowest levels , the spectrum of the excited electron is hydrogen - like in all atoms .",
    "hence , @xmath135 depends only weakly on the specific atom under consideration .",
    "the converse is true for the ionic density of states since the many - body density of states in the vicinity of the ground state strongly depends on the number of valence electrons and on the number of available single particle states of similar energy .",
    "we discuss two limiting cases - alkali atoms characterized by a sparse spectrum in the vicinity of the ground state , and complex atoms characterized by an exponentially large density of states in that energy range .",
    "alkali atoms are characterized by a single valence electron in an s - shell .",
    "all other electrons reside in closed shells with relatively deep single particle energies . exciting an additional electron",
    "has a relatively large energy cost , hence the spectra of singly ionized ions have large gaps ( nearly @xmath137 ) at the ground state .    atoms with a few valence electrons are termed `` complex atoms '' .",
    "typically such atoms have several open shells with similar single particle energies in the vicinity of the fermi level .",
    "as @xmath51 increases these shells can acquire large orbital momenta , and consequently large degeneracy .",
    "the distribution of @xmath138 valence electrons of the ion among those @xmath139 single particle states gives rise to @xmath140 many - body states of comparable energy , leading to an average many - body level spacing , @xmath141 .",
    "the effect of _ e - e _ interaction on the many - body spectrum of a complex atom is demonstrated in the numerical calculation of the spectrum and eigenstates of a cerium atom by flambaum _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "a cerium atom contains only @xmath142 valence electrons , which are sufficient to generate a complex many - body spectrum .",
    "the eigenstates of a cerium atom are shown to become chaotic superpositions of slater determinants belonging to different configurations , already at low excitation energies .",
    "it is evident that _ e - e _ interaction can not be treated perturbatively in complex atoms .",
    "generally ( a ) it lifts most degeneracies peculiar to the non - interacting spectrum , leading to a more homogeneous spectrum and ( b ) it mixes slater determinants , so that exact eigenstates are superpositions of many determinants .",
    "the single particle selection rules are hence relaxed , and only rules concerning the total spin and angular momentum hold .",
    "consequently , the density of states for transitions is significantly increased .",
    "we consider matrix elements of @xmath25 between the initial excited state , @xmath143 , and any final state , @xmath144 . @xmath145 and @xmath146 refer , respectively , to the initial ( hydrogen - like ) and final state of the excited electron@xcite . similarly , @xmath147 and @xmath148 refer to the initial and final state of the ion . @xmath147 and @xmath148 are exact eigenstates of the ion , so that @xmath149 and @xmath150 are eigenstates of @xmath24 .",
    "the multipole expansion of @xmath25 is , @xmath151 where @xmath152 are the spherical harmonics , @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "since the excited electron is practically exterior to the ion , @xmath155 can be identified with its coordinate and @xmath156 with the ion electrons .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian is hence a sum of terms acting separately on the excited electron and on the ion , @xmath157    eq . ( [ eq : simplified multipole ] ) is essentially an expansion in the ratio between the characteristic radius of @xmath158 ( @xmath159 ) and the average radius of the excited electron ( @xmath160 ) .",
    "this ratio is small due to the large spatial extent of the excited electron , which follows directly from the softness of the confining atomic potential at large distances .",
    "roughly , we expect the @xmath161 term in the sum to scale like @xmath162 .",
    "thus , high order terms in the multipole expansion diminish quickly .    calculation of matrix elements of the simplified form of @xmath25 ( [ eq : simplified multipole ] ) involves separate calculations of matrix elements for the excited electron , @xmath163 , and for the ion , @xmath164 .",
    "the infinite sums in ( [ eq : simplified multipole ] ) practically contain only few terms , due to angular momenta selection rules .",
    "the sum over @xmath165 reduces to a single term with @xmath166 . as a result of parity conservation",
    ", the sum over @xmath167 has non - vanishing terms for either odd or even values of @xmath167 ( but not for both ) .",
    "the @xmath168 term ( monopole ) vanishes since it is already included in @xmath24 . due to angular momenta addition rules for the excited electron",
    ", @xmath167 is upper bounded by @xmath169 .",
    "the terms in the expansion decrease with @xmath167 , so the dipole term is dominant ( unless it vanishes ) .",
    "next , we examine the extent to which the interaction couples degenerate eigenstates of @xmath24 . the odd terms in the multipole expansion , and in particular the dominant dipole term ( @xmath170 ) ,",
    "do not couple degenerate states .",
    "this follows from the observation that terms with odd @xmath167 contribute only when the parity of @xmath147 and @xmath148 are different , and ionic states of opposite parity are non - degenerate ( apart from rare cases of accidental degeneracy ) .",
    "@xmath25 may have non - vanishing matrix elements within a degenerate sub - space originating from the even @xmath167 terms in the multipole expansion , prominently the quadrupole term ( @xmath171 ) . in these cases",
    ", one should use degenerate perturbation theory .",
    "however , since the quadrupole matrix elements are negligible compared with the dipole contribution , we focus on the latter using non - degenerate perturbation theory .",
    "consider the matrix elements of the excited electron . in cases where the final state can be described as an ion and a hydrogenic electron , just as we assume for the initial state , the matrix element is calculated by substituting the appropriate hydrogenic wavefunctions and performing the integrals .",
    "this is done in appendix [ sec - hydrogen integrals ]",
    ". as expected , the matrix elements decrease with increasing k , roughly as @xmath172 .",
    "moreover , the matrix elements decrease rapidly as the difference between @xmath173 and @xmath174 increases , because the radial integral is strongly suppressed by the phase difference between the initial and final hydrogenic wavefunctions .",
    "when the final state , @xmath175 , is not a hydrogen - like state , the calculation of the matrix element depends on the specific atom and particularly on the potential at @xmath176",
    ". however , for such final states , the matrix elements are negligible because of the small spatial overlap between the confined final wavefunction and the relatively extended initial wavefunction@xcite .    to examine the dominant dipole term ( @xmath170 ) we exploit the commutation relation , @xmath177 $ ] .",

    "we find , @xmath182 the overlap integral and hence the matrix element is strongly suppressed when @xmath174 differs from @xmath173 .",
    "an exact calculation of the ionic part of the interaction matrix elements is notably more difficult , since it depends on the ionic many - body wavefunctions . due to parity conservation , the dipole term in ( [ eq : simplified multipole ] ) has only non - diagonal matrix elements , @xmath183 where @xmath184 is the tensorial representation of the dipole operator , @xmath185 . from the wigner - eckart theorem",
    "we learn that @xmath186 connects only states with equal @xmath187 and @xmath188 , @xmath189 , @xmath190 and opposite parity .",
    "we now estimate the dipole matrix elements @xmath191 for final ionic states that appear in the golden rule sum which is restricted by energy conservation . the energy transferred by the excited electron ( @xmath192 ) is too small for exciting core electrons .",
    "therefore , the final ionic states that should be summed over involve valence electrons excitations only .",
    "the dipole operator can be expressed in terms of single particle creation and annihilation operators , @xmath193 where @xmath194 are the matrix elements of the single particle dipole operator .",
    "this sum can be divided as follows , @xmath195 we define a projected dipole operator , @xmath196 . for final ionic states with no core excitations , @xmath197 , @xmath198 and ,",
    "@xmath199 the last equation can be used to estimate the average squared dipole matrix element appearing in the golden rule , @xmath200 where @xmath2 , as defined earlier , is the number of final ionic states coupled by the interaction to the initial state .",
    "similarly , we define a projected density operator , @xmath201 . with this definition , @xmath202 where we have introduced the pair correlation operator @xmath203 .",
    "thus , @xmath204 the first integral in ( [ eq : d2a ] ) is due to auto - correlation while the second integral reflects correlations between electrons . for a system of many electrons interacting repulsively ,",
    "one expects the ground state to be a fermi - liquid - like state , with a short range pair correlation function @xmath205 ( on the order of the average distance between electrons ) .",
    "furthermore , since repulsive interaction tends to keep the valence electrons away from one another , @xmath206 for small @xmath207 .",
    "consequently , @xmath208    alternatively , @xmath209 can be estimated using the chaotic nature of the many - body eigenstates .",
    "@xmath210 can be decomposed into a sum of single slater determinants , @xmath211 , where @xmath212 .",
    "following flambaum@xcite we assume that @xmath147 are chaotic superpositions , so the coefficients @xmath213 are random . the number of principle components in the decomposition is denoted by @xmath214 , so that @xmath215 .",
    "thus , @xmath216 it is easily shown that the matrix elements of @xmath217 in a basis of single slater determinants are all @xmath218 , where @xmath219 is the number of valence electrons .",
    "the first sum in ( [ eq : chaotic ] ) is @xmath218 , since it has @xmath214 non - negative terms of order @xmath220 .",
    "the second sum is of the same order , since it is a random sum of @xmath221 terms of order @xmath220 .",
    "both points of view lead , then , to the estimate , @xmath222 where @xmath223 is the average radius of a valence electron .",
    "the number of valence electrons , as well as their average radius , vary between atoms due to the shell structure .    a very rough estimate of the interaction matrix element , taking into account only the dominant dipole contribution ( for @xmath224 and @xmath38 satisfying all the selection rules described above ) ,",
    "is obtained by combining ( [ eq : hydrogen me ] ) and ( [ eq : ion me ] ) , @xmath225 for @xmath174 close to @xmath173 .",
    "the dependence upon the specific atom under consideration comes from the ionic part of the matrix element via @xmath226 and @xmath227 .",
    "the dependence of the matrix elements on the initial excitation energy is mainly due to the excited electron .",
    "since @xmath2 grows exponentially with @xmath219 , the interaction matrix elements are very small compared with the level spacing of the single particle hamiltonian , @xmath62 .",
    "the considerations above show that in alkali atoms below the ionization threshold there is no level broadening due to _ e - e _ interaction , and each low lying many - body eigenstate can be identified with a particular single - particle excitation ( i.e. there is a large overlap @xmath228 between these two states ) .",
    "the number of single particle excitations in this energy range is very large ( infinite in principle ) , because the single particle spectrum becomes hydrogen - like as the ionization threshold is approached .",
    "the existence of many single particle excitations with no _ e - e _ broadening in alkali atoms follows from the non - uniform single particle density of states , characterized by a gap at the fermi energy and becoming dense near the ionization threshold .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the problem of _ e - e _ lifetime of single particle excitations can be mapped onto the problem of localization on a hierarchical tree .",
    "let us consider the hierarchal tree of an alkali atom shown schematically in figure ( [ fig - alkali atom tree ] ) .",
    "any @xmath229-particle @xmath229-hole excitation with @xmath230 involves excitation of @xmath231 electrons from closed shells , and therefore a large excitation energy .",
    "this is manifested in the tree by a large gap between the lowest state in the @xmath232 generation and the ground state , a gap that grows rapidly with @xmath229 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - alkali atom tree ] ) .",
    "the structure of the hierarchical tree forces low lying single particle excitation to be localized in fock space .",
    "therefore , they are not broadened by _ e - e _ interaction . the suppression of _ e - e _ broadening is characteristic of systems with a gap at the fermi level , and it persists to excitation energies considerably larger than the gap .",
    "the atomic system is unique in that the single particle spectrum becomes dense above the energy gap , so the number of single particle excitations in alkali atoms for which _ e - e _ broadening is suppressed is very large .",
    "we argued earlier that the density of states of ionic excitations in complex atoms is exponentially large .",
    "the question is whether this density of states is sufficient to induce broadening of single particle excitations .",
    "the general criteria for applying the golden rule to the calculation of lifetime is that the resulting scattering rate , @xmath233 ( where @xmath234 is the average interaction matrix element and @xmath235 is the relevant density of states ) is larger than the level spacing of the relevant final unperturbed states @xmath236 .",
    "this requirement is equivalent to the condition , @xmath237 @xmath235 refers only to final states which are coupled to the initial state by the interaction , and generally may be considerably smaller than the full many - body density of states . in our case , @xmath235 is smaller than the full many - body density of states due to the selection rules associated with symmetry ( for the dominant dipole term ) .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath235 still grows exponentially with the number of active electrons @xmath219 .",
    "@xmath2 is the number of accessible final states , and the relevant density of states is roughly given by @xmath238 .",
    "we saw in the previous section that @xmath239 .",
    "since @xmath240 , eventually for large enough @xmath2 , ( [ eq : condition gr ] ) is satisfied .",
    "we conclude that _ for large enough @xmath2 , _ e - e _ interaction leads to finite lifetime of single particle excitations_.    the lifetime of a single particle excitation @xmath224 with energy @xmath241 is , @xmath242 the summation is restricted to final states of the excited electron , as we have averaged the interaction matrix elements over the ionic states and correspondingly introduced the ionic density of states .",
    "taking into account only dipole matrix elements ( eq . [ eq : dipole me ] ) , one obtains , @xmath243 the single particle excitation spectrum is hydrogen - like with @xmath244 , so the single particle level spacing is @xmath245 . for large enough @xmath173 , the level spacing of the excited electron becomes smaller than the level spacing of the ion .",
    "for such single particle excitations , no _ e - e _ lifetime can be defined and ( [ eq : gr for atoms ] ) becomes irrelevant .",
    "the calculated _ e - e _ scattering rate depends on the specific atom through @xmath246 , which depends irregularly on @xmath51 due to the shell structure . for all atoms ( @xmath247 ) ,",
    "the number of valence electrons @xmath248 , and the resulting _ e - e _ scattering rate is much smaller than the single particle level spacing .",
    "one may consider atoms with larger @xmath51 . according to the tf model ( see [ sec - sp tf ] above ) , @xmath249 for small @xmath51 , but in the limit @xmath250 it saturates to a constant .",
    "this yields _ e - e _ scattering rates which are independent of @xmath51 in the limit @xmath250 .",
    "the tf model , however , ignores the shell structure .",
    "the shell structure suggests that the largest open sub - shell in an atom may have @xmath129 electrons , so the number of valence electrons fluctuates , as a function of @xmath51 , between @xmath251 and @xmath252 electrons .",
    "the average radius of the valence electrons , @xmath227 , also depends on @xmath51 . as the number of valence electrons increases , we expect @xmath227 to decrease because the screening of the nucleus is less efficient .",
    "this tends to reduce the fluctuations in @xmath253 as a function of @xmath51 .",
    "e - e _ scattering rates in atoms fluctuate with @xmath51 .",
    "a small fraction of atoms have @xmath252 valence electrons . for such atoms",
    "the typical scattering rates increase as a function of @xmath51 ( @xmath254 ) , and eventually , for large enough @xmath51 , become larger than the single particle level spacing . for most atoms , however , the number of valence electrons is small and the _ e - e _ scattering rates of single particle excitations remain smaller than the single particle level spacing .    for a specific complex atom ,",
    "the width of single particle excitations decreases as the excitation energy increases , in contrast with the analogous width in quantum dots .",
    "this decrease is a direct consequence of the soft atomic potential at large distances ( @xmath255 ) .",
    "a small increase in the excitation energy amounts to a substantial increase of the average radius of the excited electron . as a result , the interaction matrix elements and therefore the _ e - e _ broadening are significantly reduced .",
    "we estimated the _ e - e _ scattering rate of single particle excitations in atoms below the ionization threshold .",
    "we conclude that _ e - e _ interaction does not limit the number of discrete single particle excitations observable below the ionization threshold in naturally occurring atoms , since the broadening it induces is small compared with the level spacing of single particle excitations . in practice ,",
    "broadening due to electron - photon interaction limits the number of resolved single particle excitations .",
    "we find that _ e - e _ scattering rate in atoms decreases with excitation energy ( below the ionization threshold ) , contrary to its behavior in fermi liquids .",
    "the _ e - e _ scattering rates in ballistic ( clean ) and diffusive ( dirty ) qds have been calculated theoretically@xcite .",
    "these calculations indicate that _ e - e _ interaction severely limits the number of observable levels in qds . in a ballistic qd containing @xmath5 electrons , only @xmath256 discrete single particle resonances can be resolved . the effect of _ e - e _ interaction is even more dramatic in diffusive qds . the number of resolved single particle resonances in a 0-d diffusive qd@xcite is approximately equal to the dimensionless conductance @xmath257 which is typically @xmath258 . in addition",
    ", the _ e - e _ scattering rate of single particle excitations in qds is shown to increase as the excitation energy becomes larger .",
    "this fermi - liquid like behavior is in contrast with our results for atoms .",
    "the profound difference of the _ e - e _ scattering rate in qds and in atoms can be attributed to the different confining potentials . in atoms ,",
    "the confining potential is very soft at large distances @xmath259 , while in qds , the potential has sharper boundaries @xmath260 .",
    "the characteristics of the confining potential determine the spatial extent of the single particle wavefunctions as well as the single particle spectrum .",
    "these properties have substantial influence on _ e - e _ scattering rates .",
    "in qds the confining potential generates a fairly uniform single particle spectrum in the vicinity of the fermi level .",
    "the single particle spectrum leads to a relevant density of states ( in this case , the 2-electron 1-hole density of states ) which grows quadratically with excitation energy .",
    "the resulting _ e - e _ scattering rates increase with excitation energy .",
    "the spectrum consists of a small number of discrete single particle resonances , beyond which the broadening exceeds the single particle level spacing , and the single particle resonances merge and form a continuous spectrum .",
    "in contrast , the coulomb confining potential in atoms produces a dense single particle excitation spectrum as the ionization threshold is approached .",
    "the spatial extent of an excited electron s wavefunction increases rapidly with excitation energy , due to the softness of the coulomb potential at large distances .",
