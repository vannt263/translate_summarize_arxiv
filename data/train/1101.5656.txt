    "the cosmic star formation ( sf ) history is a fundamental quantity that illustrates the buildup of galaxies .",
    "it can be estimated by direct measurement of sfrd as a function of redshift through rest - frame h@xmath5 , uv , and far - ir emission with dust extinction corrections ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the stellar mass density ( @xmath0 ) at various redshifts is an indirect measurement of the cosmic sf history , because it is indeed the integral of sfrd , after considering the recycling of gas into interstellar medium . given this simple relationship , in principle the measurements of the two quantities should be consistent with each other .",
    "however , in this paper we show that this is not the case for current observational estimates , and other authors have reached similar conclusions @xcite .    over the past decade ,",
    "large samples of color selected high-@xmath2 galaxies such as lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) have enabled us to measure the cosmic sfrd at @xmath6 from rest - frame uv luminosity density ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a number of near - infrared observations have also constrained the galaxy stellar mass function ( gsmf ) at @xmath7 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , the advent of the _ wide field camera 3 _ ( _ wfc3 _ ) on board the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) has dramatically improved our ability to measure the rest - frame uv light from galaxies at @xmath8 . combined with the measurement of rest - frame optical light by the _ infrared array camera _ ( _ irac _ ) on _ spitzer space telescope _ , it is now possible to measure the characteristic stellar mass of galaxies at @xmath8 using stacked spectra @xcite .    ccccccc name & box - size & @xmath9 & @xmath10 & @xmath11 & @xmath12 & @xmath13 + n216l10 & 10.0 & @xmath14 & @xmath15 & @xmath16 & 1.85 & 2.75 n400l34 & 33.75 & @xmath17 & @xmath18 & @xmath19 & 3.38 & 1.0 n600l100 & 100.0 & @xmath20 & @xmath21 & @xmath22 & 4.30 & 0.0 [ table : sim ]    however , the sources at @xmath23 are very faint , and so far we have only detected the massive end of gsmf .",
    "in addition , there are still significant uncertainties in the estimates of sfrd and @xmath0 .",
    "given this situation , it would be useful to obtain predictions on sfrd and @xmath0 from theoretical models .",
    "in particular , cosmological hydrodynamic simulations have been widely used to investigate cosmic star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .    in this _ letter _ , we focus on the cosmic sf history at @xmath24 using cosmological simulations . the remaining of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [",
    "sec : method ] , we describe the cosmological hydrodynamic simulations . in section  [ sec : mf ] , we construct the composite gsmf by combining the samples of galaxies from simulations with different resolution and volumes .",
    "we study the cosmic sfr and @xmath0 evolution in section  [ sec : sf ] .",
    "we summarise and discuss our findings in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "we use the modified version of the tree - particle - mesh smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code gadget-3 ( originally described in * ? ? ?",
    "our conventional code includes radiative cooling by h , he , and metals @xcite , heating by a uniform uv background of a modified @xcite spectrum @xcite , star formation , its feedback , a phenomenological model for galactic winds , and a sub - resolution model of multiphase ism @xcite . for the star formation model",
    ", we use the `` pressure model '' which reduces the high-@xmath2 sfrd @xcite relative to the previous model by @xcite . for the galactic outflow model",
    ", we use the multicomponent variable velocity wind model developed by @xcite .",
    "we adopt the following cosmological parameters that are consistent with the wmap best - fit values @xcite : @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 . to identify galaxies in simulations",
    ", we use simplified variant of the subfind algorithm @xcite .",
    "although cosmological simulations have been widely used to study galaxy formation , there are inevitable limitations due to resolution and box size .",
    "one critical limitation is that the low - mass galaxies are not captured in a low - resolution simulation with a large box size , and the high mass galaxies are missed in a small box size simulation due to limited box size . to alleviate this problem",
    ", we construct composite gsmfs in a wide range of galaxy stellar mass using a few simulations with different resolution and volumes ( see table  [ table : sim ] ) .    an important point to note",
    "is that the sfrd is one of the most direct output of our ab initio cosmological simulations ; our simulation follows the gas and dark matter dynamics within the framework of @xmath1cdm model , and converts part of the gas into star particles when the sf threshold density is satisfied at every time step .",
    "therefore the sfrd is the most direct outcome of gas dynamics , and no uncertain conversion is necessary to obtain sfrd from our simulations .",
    "this is why our simulations are helpful to resolve this problem between sfrd and @xmath0 .",
    "figure  [ fig : mf ] shows the composite gsmfs for different redshifts .",
    "three simulations with different resolutions and volumes ( n216l10 , n400l34 , and n600l100 runs ) are used to construct the composite gsmfs , which cover the galaxy stellar mass range of @xmath31 .",
    "the lowest mass galaxies are represented by the n216l10 run , the intermediate mass galaxies by the n400l34 run , and the most massive galaxies by the n600l100 run .",
    "the covered mass range for each run is determined by the following two criteria : first , the lowest @xmath32 of a given simulation is equivalent to that of 32 star particles , which is @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 for the n216l10 , n400l34 , and n600l100 runs , respectively .",
    "second , if the gsmfs overlap between different runs , the one from a larger volume run is used , because a smaller volume run tend to underestimate the number density of galaxies at the massive end owing to the limited box size .",
    "figure  [ fig : mf ] shows marginal overlaps between two simulations for presentation purposes .",
    "three segments of gsmf from three simulations smoothly form one mass function .",
    "the simulated gsmf shows a reasonable agreement with observations ( yellow and blue shade ) at @xmath36 , although the simulated gsmf is slightly lower than the observations at the very massive end of @xmath37 .",
    "the number density of these high - mass galaxies is so low that there are only about @xmath38 galaxies in a volume of @xmath39 , therefore this discrepancy could be due to the cosmic variance .",
    "another possible reason is that the lower mass galaxies are scattered up into the more massive bins due to observational errors , causing it to be higher than the intrinsic simulated gsmf .",
    "a marked feature in the simulated gsmf is the very steep slope at the low - mass end .",
    "when fitted with a schechter function , the simulated composite gsmf has a faint - end slope of @xmath40 at @xmath41 for the mass range of @xmath42 , while the observations suggest @xmath43 based on the data at @xmath44 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the simulation suggests that a large fraction of stars is located in the galaxies with @xmath45 at @xmath41 .",
    "we find that 22% of total @xmath0 is located in the galaxies with @xmath46 , 34% in @xmath47 , 31% in @xmath48 , and 13% in @xmath49 for the simulated gsmf at @xmath41 .",
    "in general , current galaxy surveys can not detect galaxies with @xmath45 due to their flux limit at @xmath50 , and deeper observations are needed to probe the gsmf at lower masses .",
    "another notable feature of simulated gsmf is that its low - mass slope becomes steeper as @xmath2 increases .",
    "for example , the slope is @xmath51 at @xmath52 , and @xmath53 at @xmath54 .",
    "we perform more rigorous @xmath55 fitting with a schechter function in a separate publication @xcite , which still shows @xmath3 .",
    "this steepness of simulated gsmf has significant consequences when one measures the global quantities such as cosmic sfrd and @xmath0 .",
    "we note that the integration of gsmf to @xmath56 = 0 will diverge if @xmath57 , and it requires a low - mass limit to compute the total @xmath0 . in our simulations ,",
    "the lowest galaxy mass is determined by the atomic cooling limit of @xmath58k , which corresponds to @xmath59 .",
    "therefore the summation of simulated galaxy stellar mass stops at @xmath60 .",
    "figure  [ fig : sf ] shows the evolution of sfrd and @xmath0 as functions of redshift . we decompose the total sfrd and @xmath0 into different galaxy mass ranges using our simulations .",
    "we note that the galaxy masses used for decomposition are the values at each redshift . at @xmath61 ,",
    "most of the stars form in low - mass galaxies with @xmath62 , while at @xmath63 most form in massive galaxies with @xmath64 .",
    "the same trend is also found in the @xmath0 evolution .",
    "it shows that the low - mass galaxies are preferred sites for sf in the early universe as one would expect in the hierarchical structure formation model .",
    "the black solid lines in figure  [ fig : sf ] show the sum of sfrd and @xmath0 in three different galaxy mass ranges ; i.e. , the total sfrd and @xmath0 for all galaxies with @xmath65 . an important point",
    "to notice in figure  [ fig : sf ] is that the simulated _ total _ sfrd is well within the observed range ( yellow shade and the other data points including those from gamma - ray bursts by @xcite ) , while the simulated _ total _",
    "@xmath0 is clearly higher than the observed @xmath0 . since the black solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : sf]b is a direct outcome of simulated sfrd in our simulation , the two are theoretically consistent with each other as we described at the end of section  [ sec : method ] .",
    "whereas in the observations , different techniques are used to estimate sfrd and @xmath0 with different mass limits , therefore the inconsistency could arise between the two measurements . the comparison of black solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : sf]b and the observed data clearly indicates the inconsistency between the observational measurements of sfrd and @xmath0 .    according to our simulation",
    ", the solution to the above discrepancy is that the current observations are missing the starlight from low - mass galaxies at @xmath66 , and that the low - mass end of gsmf is steeper than what current observations suggest .",
    "this would explain why the observed @xmath0 is lower than the simulation result .",
    "this point was partly addressed earlier by @xcite , but our new set of simulations reinforce their argument with a better handle on the gsmf over a wider range of galaxy mass .",
    "the uncertainty in the dust extinction correction needs to be addressed , as the rest - frame uv light can be extinguished by dust . @xcite",
    "estimated the sfrd at @xmath67 both with and without dust corrections as shown in the figure  [ fig : sf]a , integrating their estimated uv luminosity function down to zero luminosity .",
    "their total sfrd estimate ( inverted solid triangle ) agrees with our simulation very well .",
    "therefore it is unlikely that the dust extinction correction plays a significant role in resolving the inconsistency between the observed sfrd and @xmath0 estimates .",
    "furthermore , the observational estimates by @xcite at @xmath68 , which takes into account of galaxies with @xmath69 show a good agreement with our simulation results for galaxies with @xmath70 for both sfrd and @xmath0 .",
    "the correspondence between luminosity and stellar mass has a large scatter , but we find @xmath71 both observationally and in our simulations",
    ". therefore the @xmath72 limit of @xcite would correspond to roughly @xmath73 .",
    "observational estimates by @xcite include galaxies with an order of magnitude less luminous galaxies ( @xmath74 , corresponding to roughly @xmath75 ) , so it would correspond to the sum of a part of red line ( @xmath76 ) and the blue line ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "therefore a proper comparison between simulations and observations with the same galaxy mass limit does not show the inconsistency of our concern , and the nice agreement between simulations and the data of @xcite and @xcite support our argument that the missed low - mass galaxies can account for the discrepancy between the observed sfrd and @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite also demonstrated that the uv luminosity functions from our simulations and observations show an acceptable agreement , while the gsmfs show a larger discrepancy .",
    "generally , sfrd is estimated from the rest - frame uv measurement , and the nice agreement between the sfrds of simulation and observations supports the agreement in the uv luminosity function as well . whereas the @xmath0 is computed by integrating the gsmfs , which constrained less robustly at high - redshift due to uncertain light - to - mass conversion .",
    "this also supports our argument that the origin of the discrepancy being in the low - mass end slope of the gsmf .    the reasonable agreement between our total sfrd ( black solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : sf]a ) and the data points of @xcite corroborates our argument that the low - mass galaxies are the dominant contributor to the total sfrd at high redshift .",
    "this is because the grb observations are independent of the rest - frame uv flux limit of galaxy surveys , and grbs would occur wherever the star formation takes place .",
    "however the grbs may also be biased tracers of star formation , and the current grb data suggests that an enhancement of the grb rate at high-@xmath2 is necessary to account for the observed redshift distribution of grbs @xcite .",
    "a grb rate increase due to lower metallicity at high-@xmath2 may not be the singular cause , and other effect such as the evolution of the grb luminosity function break with redshift might be important .",
    "given these complications , further studies are needed in the future to better understand the relationship between the grb rate and cosmic sfrd .",
    "based on the results of self - consistent cosmological hydrodynamic simulations , we argued that the current high-@xmath2 observations are missing low - mass galaxies with @xmath78 at @xmath68 when accounting for the total @xmath0 , and this results in the inconsistency between the observational estimates of sfrd and @xmath0 . but are there any other possibilities to explain the above inconsistency , or is it possible that our simulations are incorrect ?",
    "below we discuss two points for such possibilities .",
    "first possibility is that our simulation might be overproducing the low - mass galaxies at @xmath68 .",
    "recent observational and theoretical studies show that the low - mass , high-@xmath2 galaxies could have lower sf efficiencies than the normal local galaxies @xcite owing to lower molecular hydrogen fractions in low - metallicity environments .",
    "if this is true , our current simulations might be overpredicting the @xmath0 at @xmath68 .",
    "however if we revise our sf model to account for this effect , the sfrd will also decrease together with @xmath0 , and we might underpredict sfrd instead . in the future",
    "we will revise our sf model to consider the h@xmath79 fraction in high-@xmath2 galaxies , and evaluate how strong this effect would be .",
    "the second possibility is that the imf at high-@xmath2 could be different from the local one .",
    "all data in figure  [ fig : sf ] assume the @xcite imf .",
    "as we emphasized in the last paragraph of section  [ sec : method ] , the amount of gas converted into stars is a direct output of our simulations , therefore there are no uncertainties as to stellar imf except the instantaneous gas - recycling fraction , i.e. , the ratio between the gas expelled from stars ( via stellar winds and supernovae ) and the total initial stellar mass . in our simulations , we assume the salpeter imf whose instantaneous gas - recycling fraction ( @xmath80 ) is @xmath810.1 @xcite .",
    "if we use the @xcite imf that has a lower number of low - mass stars , @xmath80 increases to @xmath810.2 , which would reduce the simulated @xmath0 by about 10% .",
    "note that @xmath80 here only considers the gas - recycling from massive stars .",
    "if we take into account of the contribution from long - lived , low - mass stars , the value of @xmath80 will increase by a factor of a few . however , this paper focuses on the high-@xmath2 galaxies , and we can safely ignore the gas - recycling from low - mass stars .",
    "therefore the change from salpeter to chabrier imf can not fully account for the inconsistency between sfrd and @xmath0 .",
    "the top - heavy imf in high-@xmath2 galaxies has been speculated by many authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and it has a much higher value of @xmath80 .",
    "consequently , the resulting @xmath0 will decrease significantly for a given sfrd , and it may alleviate the discrepancy in @xmath0 .",
    "however , the current theoretical models and observational support for top - heavy imf are not very robust ; for example , @xcite suggested abundant low - mass stars in high-@xmath2 star - forming galaxies , which argues against a top - heavy imf .    in summary",
    ", we find a good agreement between our self - consistent cosmological simulations and the observational estimates of sfrd and @xmath0 if we limit the comparison to galaxies with @xmath82 .",
    "in particular , the consistency between our simulations and the observational estimates by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite at @xmath68 is very encouraging .",
    "our simulations predict the existence of numerous low - mass galaxies with @xmath83 , and these low - mass galaxies are not included in the current observational estimates of @xmath0 .",
    "this paper demonstrates that the current observational estimates and understanding of the formation of high-@xmath2 galaxies are still uncertain . to resolve this problem",
    ", we need future observations with increasing sensitivity and reduced uncertainties ( e.g. , jwst ) to provide more robust constraints for the abundance of low - mass galaxies at @xmath68 , as well as the improvement in the theoretical modeling of galaxy formation , particularly on star formation and its feedback .",
