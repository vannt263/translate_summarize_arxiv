    "algorithms are often implicit , such as general symplectic runge - kutta methods , and the roots of the implicit iterations are usually difficult to search exactly for complicated vector fields . in order to improve the efficiency and accuracy of long - term simulations for hamiltonian systems ,",
    "explicit symplectic algorithms are desired @xcite , especially for relativistic dynamics of charged particles , which describes many important multi - timescale dynamics , such as runaway electrons in tokamaks @xcite . however , explicit methods for the relativistic system is difficult to find , except for the 1st order symplectic euler method @xcite .",

    "the long - term relative mass - shell error by non - symplectic method gradually increases without bound due to numerical errors . on the contrary , for the symplectic integrators ,",
