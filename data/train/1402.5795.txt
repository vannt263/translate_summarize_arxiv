    "<S> differences between the two    calculations provide a measure of missing configurations in the gsm - cc    calculation of low - energy states of @xmath4na due to the    restriction on the number of excited states of @xmath0ne . </S>",
    "<S> results : : :    we present the first application of the gsm - cc formalism for the    calculation of excited states of @xmath0ne and    @xmath4na , excitation function and the elastic / inelastic    differential cross - sections in the    @xmath0ne@xmath1 reaction at different    energies . </S>",
    "<S> this is the first unified description of the spectra and    reaction cross - sections in the gsm formalism . </S>",
    "<S> the method is shown to    be both feasible and accurate . </S>",
    "<S> the approximate equivalence of gsm and    gsm - cc in describing spectra of @xmath4na has been    demonstrated numerically . </S>",
    "<S> conclusions : : :    the gsm in the coupled - channel representation opens a possibility for    the unified description of low - energy nuclear structure and reactions    using the same hamiltonian . while both gsm and gsm - cc can describe    energies , widths and wave functions of the many - body states , the    gsm - cc can in addition yield reaction cross - sections . </S>",
    "<S> combined    application of gsm and gsm - cc to describe energies of resonant states    allows to test the exactitude of calculated cross - sections for a given    many - body hamiltonian . </S>"
