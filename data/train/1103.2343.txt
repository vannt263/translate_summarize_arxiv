    "tensor network formalisms have been very successful in describing quantum many - body systems , and their theoretical study is expected to play a crucial role for the understanding of strongly correlated phenomena in condensed matter physics . despite the huge hilbert space associated to the many - body system , scaling exponentially with the number of particles , the introduction of the density matrix renormalization group @xcite and matrix product states algorithms to simulate ground states of one dimensional quantum many - body systems @xcite have given strong evidence for the fact that physically interesting states are confined to reside in a small submanifold of the full hilbert space .",
    "this observation was later proven in the context of quantum information theory in terms of entanglement properties of ground states .",
    "more specifically , it was shown that ground states of one dimensional systems whose hamiltonian is gapped are only weakly entangled ( they obey the area law ) and can as such be faithfully and efficiently simulated in terms of matrix product states @xcite .",
    "the main point of the tensor network formalism is that many - body quantum states are described in terms of local tensors ( or matrices ) where the number of parameters scales polynomially with the system size , and this in turn makes the classical simulations tractable .",
    "the matrix product state formalism was later generalized to two spatial dimensions by the introduction of 2 different methods , the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz ( mera ) @xcite and the projected entangled pair states ( peps ) @xcite both of which have later also been extended to fermionic systems @xcite .",
    "tensor network methods have a great potential in describing two dimensional quantum systems as they do not suffer from the notorious `` sign problem '' which makes frustrated spin systems and fermionic spin systems essentially untractable by quantum monte carlo methods .",
    "however , both mera and peps suffer from relatively high computational complexity .",
    "the performance of peps algorithms is furthermore hindered by the instabilities that arise due to the lack of a normal form of the peps structure ; this has to be opposed to the optimization using matrix product states in one dimension where such a normal form makes the environment essentially disappear from the local optimization procedure .",
    "the environment plays an important role in the context of both density matrix renormalization group and tensor network methods as it is responsible for a faithful projection of quantum states to a bounded submanifold of the hilbert space , technically known as truncation .",
    "still , the complexity of the peps algorithm scales as @xmath0 for open boundary conditions which essentially restricts the computations to small bond dimensions of @xmath1 for finite size peps algorithms ( but @xmath2 for infinite peps algorithms ) which is much smaller than in the one dimensional systems where one can reach bond dimensions of a few thousands .",
    "note however that that much smaller bond dimensions should give already reasonable results ; this follows from the monogamy properties of entanglement .",
    "another crucial difficulty in simulating two dimensional many - body systems in terms of peps is however not only the computational complexity itself but also instabilities which occur due to the lack of the normal peps structure as is the case in one - dimensional systems .",
    "it turns out that the objects in the peps algorithm become less and less conditioned with increasing bond dimension and cutting ill - defined components immediately induces effective reduction of the bond dimension .",
    "this requires drastic changes to the peps simulation techniques , not so much in terms of complexity but rather in terms of stability , calling for the elimination of the double layer structure which is the root of both stability and complexity issues .",
    "the first step in this direction was made by not calculating the environment at all but letting it evolve in the process of imaginary time evolution @xcite .",
    "such an approach allows to achieve very large bond dimensions @xcite but nevertheless seems to require a good initial approximation and works best for translation invariant peps states .    in this paper",
    "we provide answers to both questions concerning the complexity and stability of the peps algorithms .",
    "we propose a method to simulate the time evolution of peps state using an approximate effective environment , avoiding manipulations with the double layer tensor network .",
    "the approach is justified by the fact that the effective environment indeed exists and reproduces the effect of the full environment on the system exactly .",
    "similarly as in the density matrix renormalization group method , the environment is approximated by a system of particles of an effective physical dimension which faithfully describe the effect of the environment to the system .",
    "the approach allows for high bond dimensions @xmath3 or more , although the calculation of energy and other observables still requires the full calculation with the double layer tensor network structure .",
    "alternatively , quantum monte carlo sampling can be used to calculate the energy and expectation values of tensor networks with a large bond dimension @xcite .",

    "we shall assume open boundary conditions such that @xmath10 will only refer to a map from a high - rank tensorial object ( of unit size ) resulting from the contraction of the square , to a scalar .    let us consider a bipartite splitting of the @xmath4 system of qubits to a part consisting of a contiguous block of @xmath11 qubits and a part containing the remaining @xmath12 qubits .",
    "the first part we shall call the subsystem _ s _ and the second part the environment _ e_. if the subsystem _ s _ is subject to a local transformation resulting from e.g. a suzuki - trotter decomposition of the evolution operator , the internal bond dimension between the qubits in the subsystem _ s _ will increase . in order to keep the tensor network description  ( [ eq : peps ] ) manageable , the tensors @xmath5\\ , s_{i , j}}$ ] for @xmath13 must be truncated such that no bond dimension exceeds the chosen bond dimension @xmath9 .",

    "the peps state  ( [ eq : peps1 ] ) now takes a simple form @xmath26 due to the entanglement between the subsystem _ s _ and the environment , the former is in a mixed state given by the reduced density matrix @xmath27 which reads ( up to a normalization factor ) @xmath28 if one is to apply a local transformation to the subsystem _ s _ , such as a trotter gate , the only relevant quantity to consider is the reduced density operator @xmath29 which in turn only depends on the environment through inner products @xmath30 and not the state of the environment itself .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that , for a fixed set of basis states for the system _ s _ , there exists an effective environment of physical dimension @xmath23 which exactly reproduces these inner products and is given by @xmath31 { \\tilde s}_{\\rm e } }   { { \\vert { \\tilde s}_{\\rm e } \\rangle}}\\ ] ] where @xmath32}$ ] is obtained by an orthogonal factorization e.g. @xmath33 where @xmath34_{(s_{\\rm e } ) , ( lruu'dd ' ) } \\equiv e^{[\\mu,\\mu ' ] s_{\\rm e}}_{lruu'dd'}$ ] and @xmath35 { \\tilde s}_{\\rm e } } = [ \\mathbf{r}]_{({\\tilde s}_{\\rm e } ) , ( lruu'dd')}$ ] ; the unitary matrix @xmath36 is thus irrelevant .",

    "the tensor network is contracted row by row ( or column by column ) starting from above and from below such that the @xmath40-th row is surrounded by a single row of effective particles on both sides .",
