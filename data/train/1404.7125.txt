    "the main component being that with age 30myr . particularly conspicuous in the h@xmath3 flux distribution and in the young population contribution is the  knot \" of strong h@xmath3 emission at approximately 1  e of the nucleus .",
    "this region shows a large velocity dispersion , being observed from the channel maps in blueshift centered at @xmath102130kms@xmath16 up to the one in redshift at 112kms@xmath16 and even at 172kms@xmath16 .",
    "one possibility to explain this high velocity dispersion is the presence of supernova remnants there , what would be compatible with the age of the stellar population . in spite of having a larger velocity dispersion than in the rest of the ring ,",
    "the h@xmath103m)/@xmath104 m line ratio at this location does not differ from those in the remainder of the ring , supporting also thermal excitation there .",
    "using long - slit spectroscopy of a sample of 67 emission - line galaxies together with photoionization models , @xcite have investigated the origin of the h@xmath3 line emission and concluded also that heating by x - rays is the dominant thermal process for active galaxies .",
    "our more detailed data suggests that this also happens in ngc1068 : the h@xmath103m/@xmath105 m ratio also indicates that the h@xmath3 emission is mainly due to x - ray heating .",
    "most of the previous studies referred to in the previous section , address also the excitation mechanisms of the near - ir [ feii ] emission lines and in general support a larger contribution of excitation by shocks to the [ feii ] than to the h@xmath3 excitation , based mainly on emission - line ratios .",
    "however , in @xcite , we showed that the [ feii ] emission in active galaxies can also be reproduced by photoionization models which include only x - rays from the central agn , even though a contribution from shocks can not be discarded . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite found that shocks play an important role in the origin of the [ feii ] emission in agns .",
    "thus , the [ feii ] origin in agns is still an open question to be further investigated .",
    "one interesting property of the [ feii ] emission in ngc1068 is the fact that , within the fov of our observations , its emission is more extended than that of [ oiii ] , as discussed in previous sections . as the br@xmath106 flux distribution seems to be similar to that of [ oiii ] ( see fig.[fig : maps ] ) , we have used the channel maps of br@xmath106 @xcite to investigate this difference between the [ oiii ] and [ feii ] emitting gas also regarding their kinematics .",
    "what can be seen in the channel maps is that there is a strong similarity between the two in the blueshift channels , although only at the highest flux levels , as the emission in the [ feii ] map is more extended than that of br@xmath106 .",
    "but the most striking difference is observed in the redshift channels , in which little emission is seen in br@xmath106 to the n - ne and s - sw , while in [ feii ] there is strong emission within the whole quadrant between n and e. adopting the approximate geometry for the outflow proposed by @xcite , the origin of this emission in redshift would be the back wall of the conical / houglass outflow to the ne .",
    "actually , the hourglass shape of the outflow seen in the [ feii ] flux distribution has an important contribution from this redshifted part of the outflow .",
    "but why there is emission from this part in [ feii ] and not in br@xmath106 ?",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , the [ feii ] emission is excited by electrons in a zone of partially ionized h. this zone is found around agn because it is formed when the h ionizing photons have been already absorbed but there is heating of the gas by x - rays and/or shocks , that can still ionize the fei .",
    "this explains why we see a lot of [ feii ] emission and little br@xmath106 emission from the back part of the outflow : most of this region is a partially ionized zone .",
    "further investigation on the origin of the [ feii ] emission can be done via the line ratios shown in fig .",

    "in particular , the [ feii]@xmath107 m and [ pii]@xmath108 m emission lines have similar excitation temperatures , with their parent ions having similar ionization potential and radiative recombination coefficients . in hii regions , where shocks are not important , the ratio [ feii]/[pii ] is @xmath109 . in supernova remnants , fast shocks",

    ". similar behavior of the [ feii ] emission has also been observed for other active galaxies @xcite : an enhancement of [ feii]/[pii ] line ratio in association with a radio jet .",
    "the [ feii ] ( 1.2570@xmath5m)/pa@xmath6 line ratio can also be used to investigate the origin of the [ feii ] emission .",

    "nevertheless , some higher values are observed to ne along the bicone  at the same location where the feii]/[pii ] presents the highest values ",
    "consistent with shock excitation at these locations .    in summary",
    ", we conclude that the [ feii ] near - ir lines are originated from the emission of an outflowing gas excited mainly by x - rays from the central agn , but also with a contribution from shocks associated to the radio jet to ne and sw of the nucleus .      we can use the fluxes of the br@xmath106 and h@xmath3 ( 2.1218@xmath5 m ) emission lines to derive the mass of ionized and hot molecular gas in the inner @xmath0400@xmath21400  pc@xmath33 of ngc1068",

    "the integrated flux of the h@xmath3 line is @xmath124 for ngc1068 , resulting in a mass of only @xmath8 .",

    "the ratio @xmath125 is similar to those we have found in similar studies of other active galaxies , which ranges from @xmath126 to 10@xmath115 @xcite .",

    "previous studies of many active galaxies , in which masses of both cold and hot molecular gas have been obtained , imply factors of 10@xmath127 to 10@xmath128 between the mass of cold and hot molecular gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the main conclusions of this paper are :    * the emitting h@xmath3 and ionized gases have completely different flux distributions .",
    "the first is observed in a circumnuclear ring in the plane of the galaxy with radius 75pc and the latter trace the bipolar outflows previously observed in the optical ; * the comparison of line - ratio maps with the values predicted by different excitation models shows that most of the h@xmath3 line emission is excited by thermal processes , mainly due to heating of the gas by x - rays from the central agn to an excitation temperature of 2200k ; * the flux distribution in the h emission lines , such as br@xmath106 , follows that observed in the optical [ oiii ] emission , previously described as having a bipolar cone - shaped structure ; the [ feii ] flux distribution is nevertheless more extended and shows an hourglass structure , broader than a cone and similar to that seen in planetary nebulae such as ngc6302 ; * the broader and more extended flux distribution in the [ feii ] emission lines is attributed to the fact that the it originates in a partially ionized region , that extends beyond the fully ionized region and is excited mainly by x - rays from the central agn , with some contribution from shocks to ne and sw of the nucleus along the bicone axis .",
