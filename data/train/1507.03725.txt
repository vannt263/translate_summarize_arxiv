    "the cross correlation power spectrum of the isw effect and mass tracer shows the typical behavior of the change from the anti - correlated to the positively correlated when it reaches to specific scale .",
    "this is due to the fact that the non - linear over density causes the sign change of the time derivative of the gravitational potential .",
    "this scale depends on dark energy ( @xmath30 ) and the matter energy density contrast @xmath31 at the specific epoch .",
    "this method requires the measurement of the location of the sign change of the cross correlation power spectrum instead of the amplitude of it .",
