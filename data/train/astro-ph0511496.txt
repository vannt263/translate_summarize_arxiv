    "narrow - line seyfert 1 ( nls1 ) galaxies were identified by osterbrock & pogge ( 1985 ) as a subgroup of seyfert galaxies with small widths of the broad balmer lines ( fwhm@xmath10 2000 km / s ) .",
    "correlation analyses have shown that h@xmath4 line width is anti - correlated with the strength of feii / h@xmath4 emission complexes and correlated with the strength of [ oiii]@xmath95007 ( boroson & green 1992 ) .",
    "the study of nls1s and correlations among their properties is expected to hold important clues on the physical processes in the central region of agn ( see veron - cetty & veron 2000 for a general agn review ) .",

    "2004 , mathur & grupe 2005 ) .    while the optical and x - ray properties of nls1s were explored intensively in the last decade , relatively little is known about their radio properties ( ulvestad et al 1995 , moran 2000 , greene et al .",
    ". in particular , only a few radio loud nls1s and narrow - line quasars ( nlqsos ) have been identified so far , namely three detections and one or two candidates .",

    "the reason for the scarcity of radio loud nls1s is still unknown . finding new radio loud nls1s is thus of great importance for understanding the nls1 phenomenon . according to boroson & green ( 1992 ) , radio loudness in their quasar sample",
    "is closely linked to `` eigenvector 1 '' in the sense that radio sources tend toward _ small _ values of feii equivalent width and high [ oiii ] peak values ( see also marziani et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the study of radio properties of nls1s , in particular their radio loudness and radio variability , also allows us to re - address questions related to the orientation of the inner region of nls1s .",
    "it was originally suggested that nls1s are preferentially viewed face on ( osterbrock and pogge 1985 ) and some evidence for and against this scenario has been presented since then . the orientation issue is important not only for its own sake , but also enters black hole mass and accretion rate estimates and consequently affects black hole mass  bulge mass relations of nls1s and their cosmological implications ( e.g. see the discussion in collin & kawaguchi 2004 ) .",

    "the emission - line ratio [ oii]@xmath93727/[oiii]@xmath95007 is a good indicator of the ionization parameter @xmath67 ( penston et al .",

    "the ionization parameter estimated for sdssj172206.03 + 565451.6 is comparable to other seyferts and in particular is similar to the nls1 galaxy ngc4051 ( @xmath71 applying the same method ; komossa & fink 1997 ) .",
    "examining other line ratios for their diagnostic value , we find that once the ionization parameter is known , the ratio of [ nev]/[neiii ] is a very good diagnostic of the euv - soft x - ray continuum , relatively independent of density ( fig .",
    "2b ) . sdssj172206.03 + 565451.6 is unusual in its relatively strong nev emission which does indicate the presence of a high - energy continuum excess , i.e. , a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) similar to continuum ` c3'-`c4 ' ( see fig .",
    "essentially all of the 128 nlqsos listed in the `` catalogue of quasars and agn '' compiled by veron - cetty & veron ( 2003 ) have redshifts in a range where both [ oii]@xmath93727 and [ nev]@xmath93426 are easily measurable by optical spectroscopy . the combination of the [ oii]/[oiii ] and [ nev]/[neiii ] diagrams is thus a very useful tool in estimating ionization parameters of nls1s and constraining their euv continua .",
    "these line - ratios should be a beneficial addition in sampling the `` eigenvector '' parameter space of radio loud and radio quiet nls1s , complementing line ratios such as feii / h@xmath4 and line profiles shapes already in use ( e.g. sulentic et al .",

    "<S> we report identification of the radio loud narrow - line quasar sdssj172206.03 + 565451.6 which we found in the course of a search for radio loud narrow - line active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . </S>",
    "<S> sdssj172206.03 + 565451.6 is only the @xmath04th securely identified radio loud narrow - line quasar and the second - most radio loudest with a radio index @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> its black hole mass , @xmath2 m@xmath3 estimated from h@xmath4 line width and 5100  luminosity , is unusually small given its radio loudness , and the combination of mass and radio index puts sdssj172206.03 + 565451.6 in a scarcely populated region of @xmath5-@xmath6 diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> sdssj172206.03 + 565451.6 is a classical narrow - line seyfert1-type object with fwhm@xmath7 km / s , an intensity ratio of [ oiii]/h@xmath8 and feii emission complexes with feii@xmath94570/h@xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the ionization parameter of its narrow - line region , estimated from the line ratio [ oii]/[oiii ] , is similar to seyferts and its high ratio of [ nev]/[neiii ] indicates a strong euv to soft - x - ray excess . </S>",
    "<S> we advertise the combined usage of [ oii]/[oiii ] and [ nev]/[neiii ] diagrams as a useful diagnostic tool to estimate ionization parameters and to constrain the euv  soft - x - ray continuum shape relatively independent from other parameters . </S>"
