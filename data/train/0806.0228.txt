    "they argued that this time delay , opposite to that found by @xcite , could be realized if electrons are injected into an asymmetric magnetic loop toward a footpoint with a stronger magnetic field .",
    "@xcite analyzed the spatial and spectral variations of hxr and microwave emissions in the 2003 may 29 flare , and showed that the observed characteristics can be interpreted as a consequence of the electron transport called trap - plus - precipitation @xcite .",

    ", they found two different classes of propagating features of non - thermal microwave sources along the loop ( see fig . 3 in y2002 ) .",
    "one is a slower propagation at a speed of @xmath3 , and the other is a faster propagation at a speed of @xmath4 .",
    "the origin of the slower propagating feature is discussed by .",
    "they interpreted this feature as propagation of low - frequency whistler waves that can trap the parent electrons by wave - particle interactions at their turbulent front .",
    "the phase velocity of low - frequency whistler waves is roughly in agreement with the observation .",
    "the origin of the faster propagating feature is discussed by y2002 .",
    "they interpreted this propagating feature as a free stream of relativistic electrons along the loop .",
    "assuming that the 17 ghz microwave - emitting electrons are almost relativistic ( @xmath5 ) , they concluded that the parent electrons are injected with large pitch angle , @xmath6 .",
    "the interpretation of y2002 on the microwave propagating feature is subject to the following assumptions .",
    "first , they assumed that electrons freely stream along the loop .",
    "however , since the flare loop must be a converging magnetic loop , electrons suffer the magnetic mirroring force .",
    "second , they assumed that the apparent motion of the microwave source , which is generated via gyrosynchrotron radiation , corresponds to the trajectory of the parent electrons .",
    "however , since the gyrosynchrotron radiation mechanism intricately depends on many physical parameters , it is not necessarily evident that the apparent motion of the radiation source is identical to the trajectory of the electrons with a specific pitch angle .    in this paper",
    "we reconsider the rapidly propagating feature of the microwave source in the 1999 august 28 flare and address the pitch - angle distribution of the electrons , by refining the treatments of the emission mechanism as well as the electron motion . in   [ sec : analytic - treatment ] we present an analytic solution of the electron motion in a converging magnetic loop .   [ sec : numerical - model ] shows our numerical model of the electron motion along the loop , in which we use the gyro - averaged fokker - planck equation to determine the electron phase space distribution .",
    "we calculate the gyrosynchrotron intensity distribution along the loop from the calculated electron distribution for comparison with the observation . in   [ sec : result - discussion ] we present our calculation results .",

    "[ sec : summary ] we summarize this paper .",
    "we show an analytic solution of the motion of a single electron in a converging magnetic loop that helps to understand calculation results in  [ sec : result - discussion ] .",
    "this is described by the following equations : the equations of motion along the magnetic field line and the conservation of the magnetic moment , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the position measured from the loop top ( @xmath9 is the initial position ) along the field line , @xmath10 is the velocity , @xmath11 is the pitch - angle cosine , @xmath12 is the initial pitch - angle cosine , and @xmath13 is the magnetic field strength at the position , respectively .",
    "we do not consider the energy change of an electron , thus @xmath10 = constant .    for mathematical convenience ,",
    "we give the magnetic field strength as a quadratic function with respect to @xmath8 of the form ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "[ eq : drdt ] ) and ( [ eq : mag_mom ] ) give a solution of the bounce motion as simple harmonic oscillation : @xmath21 where @xmath22 equation ( [ eq : omega ] ) tells that an electron with a smaller @xmath12 ( larger initial pitch angle ) has a higher frequency of the bounce motion .",
    "we apply the above solution to the propagating feature of the microwave source reported by y2002 .",
    "we assume , in the same manner as y2002 , that the apparent propagating motion of the radiation source corresponds to the trajectory of electrons with a specific initial pitch angle .",
    "the observation gives constraints on several variables appearing in equations ( [ eq : rr ] ) and ( [ eq : omega ] ) . according to the analysis by y2002 ( see fig .",
    "3 in their paper ) , the electrons traveled @xmath23 from the injection site ( loop top ) to the loop end ( footpoint ) .",
    "we adopt this value as the footpoint distance @xmath17 , and evaluate @xmath24 .",
    "an observed travel time of 0.5 s is roughly equal to a quarter of the bounce period , @xmath25 .",
    "assuming that the magnetic field strength at the emission site is on the order of 100 gauss ( by y2002 ) , the velocity of non - thermal gyrosynchrotron - emitting electrons is almost the speed of light @xcite , @xmath26 . using these , we can evaluate the magnetic mirror ratio as well as the initial pitch - angle cosine from equations ( [ eq : rr ] ) and ( [ eq : omega ] ) , @xmath27 y2002 obtained a magnetic field strength at the loop top , @xmath28 by potential field extrapolation .",
    "the photospheric magnetic field strength at the loop end is @xmath29 .",
    "we consider that the electron propagation end is above the photosphere where the field strength is probably lower than that at the photosphere , because numerous collisions with ambient plasma prevent them from reaching the photosphere .",
    "therefore we consider @xmath30 . from this inequality and equation ( [ eq : omega ] ) , we obtain @xmath31 . consequently we evaluate @xmath32 , thus @xmath33 which is smaller than that derived by y2002 .",
    "this is because we consider the field convergence while they did not .",
    "in the previous section we only treat the motion of a single electron .",
    "our goal is to numerically model the gyrosynchrotron intensity distribution along the loop for comparison with the observation . for this purpose , we first numerically model the electron motion along the loop by the fokker - planck approach of the electron distribution in phase space .",
    "the gyro - averaged fokker - planck equation is as follows : @xmath34 here @xmath35 is the electron distribution in phase space ( number of electrons per unit length per unit pitch - angle cosine per unit energy ) , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the coulomb energy loss rate and pitch - angle diffusion coefficient , @xmath38 is the magnetic mirroring force , @xmath39 is the kinetic energy in units of the electron rest mass energy @xmath40 , @xmath41 is the lorentz factor , @xmath42 , @xmath43 is the electron mass , respectively .",

    "the initial condition is given to be symmetric in @xmath64 space , which yields the symmetric solution of equation ( [ eq : fp ] ) : @xmath65 .",
    "we numerically solve equation ( [ eq : fp ] ) by using a finite difference method with operator splitting .",

    "we employ the symmetric boundary condition in @xmath11 space to ensure total number conservation . for the advection term in @xmath66 space",

    "we adopt the cip - csl2 scheme developed by @xcite .",
    "this scheme simultaneously solves the integrated value of @xmath61 as well as @xmath61 itself to keep `` subgrid '' information and to satisfy the mass conservation .",
    "a boundary condition at @xmath67 is @xmath68 , for the symmetry .",
    "another boundary condition at @xmath69 is as follows : ( 1 ) electrons with positive pitch angle , @xmath70 , are lost from the calculation box ; and ( 2 ) there is no flow from outside the box , @xmath71 .",
    "physically , the former corresponds to the electron precipitation into the footpoint , and the latter means that the possibility of electrons originating below the footpoint ( chromosphere ) is excluded .",
    "we set @xmath72 cells in ( @xmath73 ) space , and 128 logarithmically - spaced grids from 50 to 5000 kev in @xmath66 space .    using the electron distribution @xmath35",
    ", we further numerically calculate the distribution of the gyrosynchrotron radiation for comparison with the observation of y2002",
    ". a general calculation of the gyrosynchrotron radiation in a magnetized plasma includes effects such as self - absorption , absorption by ambient plasma , and the razin suppression @xcite .",
    "these effects contribute at low harmonics ( @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the electron gyrofrequency ) of the radiation in the optically - thick regime .",
    "however , y2002 showed that the 17 ghz emission observed with the norh in the 1999 august 28 flare is the optically - thin , non - thermal gyrosynchrotron radiation .",
    "therefore , it is sufficient for our purpose in this paper to consider only the optically - thin radiation at high harmonics ( @xmath76 ) from mildly relativistic electrons ( @xmath77 ) . under such limited condition , @xcite gave an useful approximation to calculate the gyrosynchrotron emissivity from mildly relativistic electrons with arbitrary energy and pitch - angle distributions ( eq .",

    "subsequent diffusion by coulomb collisions is ignorable because the collision time ( @xmath94 s ) is much longer than the loop transit time ( @xmath95 s ) .",
    "we calculate the electron distribution not only in space but also in energy ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : fp ] ) and ( [ eq : ini_con ] ) ) .",
    "since the electron propagation is velocity - dispersive , the time variation of the electron number distribution differs with energy .",

    ", radiation primarily comes from the footpoint . in the top view ( middle left )",
    ", strong radiation comes from the intermediate position between the loop top and footpoint .",
    "these results are attributed to the dependence of the gyrosynchrotron emissivity on a viewing angle as well as the parent electron distribution along the loop .",

    "the intensity distribution is quite different from that in the narrow - angle injection case ( middle and bottom left panels ) .",
    "the strong radiation source is broadly distributed along the loop .",
    "we can see the propagating feature of the strong radiation source from the loop top to the footpoint in both the middle and bottom right panels , similar to the observation of y2002 .",
    "for example , rapidly propagating features are found during 0.3 - 0.5 s and 0.9 - 1.2 s in the bottom right panel .",
    "these features do not result from the motion of electrons with a specific initial pitch angle but from the motion of an ensemble of electrons with different initial pitch angles .",
    "we discuss the apparent motion of the radiation source by using the analytic solution in  [ sec : analytic - treatment ] . for mathematical simplicity , we consider the side - view case . as mentioned in ",
    "[ sec : narrow - band - case ] , the gyrosynchrotron radiation is primarily produced by the electrons with @xmath113 in the side view . it is found from equations ( [ eq : sol_mu ] ) and ( [ eq : omega ] ) that the pitch - angle cosine of an electron with the initial pitch - angle cosine @xmath12 becomes zero at @xmath114 where @xmath115 is an odd integer .",

    "using this , @xmath12 in equation ( [ eq : t_g ] ) can be removed and it is rewritten as @xmath119 this equation shows that when @xmath100 is smaller @xmath116 is smaller . therefore , @xmath100 is smaller when @xmath12 is smaller .",
    "electrons produce strong radiation at different time and position , depending on their initial pitch angle . by this equation",

    "as can be seen , the analytic solution well explains the propagating feature of the radiation source .    based on these discussions ,",
    "we interpret the microwave propagating feature as follows . electrons with a larger ( smaller ) initial pitch angle emit microwaves earlier ( later ) at the position closer to ( farther from ) the loop top , as seen in the peak of the dash - dotted ( solid ) line in figure [ fig : result_zoom ] .",
    "this difference , due to the difference of the initial pitch angle of the parent electrons , appears as the propagating motion of the strong microwave source along the loop from the loop top to the footpoint .",
    "the propagation of the radiation source seen in figure [ fig : result ] is periodic .",
    "this is because the initially injected electrons remain to oscillate in the loop @xmath123 .",
    "actual flares , on the other hand , show the light curve with a duration ( tens of second ) longer than the electron loop transit time scale ( @xmath124 s ) , indicating that electrons are continuously injected into the loop ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the periodic propagation seen in our calculation is probably occulted by the emissions from subsequently injected electrons , except the first one . the observable propagating motion is the first line @xmath125 .",
    "the time of electrons reaching the footpoint and the propagation speed of the radiation source are calculated from equation ( [ eq : ana_solution ] ) with @xmath102 , @xmath126 the propagation speed of the radiation source is determined from the electron velocity and the magnetic mirror ratio .",
    "when the magnetic field strength at the emission site is on the order of 100 gauss , effective energy of electrons producing @xmath127 gyrosynchrotron radiation is @xmath128mev @xcite , hence their velocity is nearly @xmath96 .",
    "the propagation speed , @xmath129 with @xmath130 , is almost independent of the observation frequency , as long as parent electrons are relativistic .",
    "this frequency - independent microwave propagating feature is found not only at 17 ghz but also at higher frequencies up to 34 ghz in our calculation .",
    "we performed the calculation for two ideal cases of the view ( top and side ) because the gyrosynchrotron radiation depends on the viewing angle . the apparent propagating motion seen in the top - view case ( middle right panel of fig .",

    "difference of the view , which depends on the magnetic field configuration and location of the loop , does not influence our interpretation on the microwave propagating feature .",
    "it is supposed that a specific electron accounts for the propagating feature of the microwave source .",
    "to produce the strong radiation , the pitch angle @xmath131 of the electron should be close to @xmath79 at any time and position throughout its propagation along the loop .",

    "the former case is realized if the field strength and the viewing angle do not change along the loop .",
    "the latter case may be realized if the loop is on the limb with east - west orientation , because @xmath79 as well as @xmath131 increase toward the footpoint in such configuration .",
    "these cases are , however , limited ones .",
    "our interpretation holds in any probable field configuration and loop location .",
    "we presented analytic and numerical treatments of the electron motion along a magnetic loop , and consider the rapidly propagating feature of the non - thermal microwave source reported by y2002 .",
    "we studied this issue by describing the electron distribution with the fokker - planck equation and by calculating the gyrosynchrotron radiation .",
    "we first assumed that electrons injected into the loop have an almost unique initial pitch angle , following the interpretation made by y2002 .",
    "these electrons do not yield the propagating feature of the radiation source along the loop . this does not support the interpretation of y2002 .",
    "we next assumed that electrons injected into the loop have an isotropic pitch - angle distribution . in this case , the intensity distribution shows the apparent motion of the strong radiation source from the loop top to the footpoint , similar to the observation .",
    "this feature is interpreted as the motion of an ensemble of electrons ( not a specific electron ) , which have different time and position to produce strong radiation due to the difference of their initial pitch angle . to show the microwave propagating feature ,",
    "the injected electrons should be broadly distributed in pitch - angle space .",
    "we discuss a probable physical process of electrons in the 1999 august 28 flare .",
    "it is thought that this flare was triggered by the interaction between the microwave - propagating loop and a compact loop .",
    "such configuration is suggested by @xcite , called `` double - loop flare '' .",
    "@xcite concluded that in the double - loop flare electrons are accelerated at the region where two loops interact .",
    "based on this model , y2002 interpreted that the acceleration site in the 1999 august 28 flare is where the propagation of the non - thermal microwave source starts , that is , the injection region .",
    "we conclude that the electrons in the 1999 august 28 flare started to propagate along the loop just after being isotropically accelerated at the site . in  [ sec : narrow - band - case ] we discussed the calculation for the narrow - angle injection case with @xmath132 only .",
    "the discussion can be applied to electrons with different pitch - angle distributions . when the electron pitch - angle distribution is concentrated perpendicular to the magnetic field , @xmath133 . in this case",
    ", it is found from equations ( [ eq : rg_disk ] ) or ( [ eq : rg_limb ] ) with @xmath134 that the strong radiation source is confined to the loop top . when the electron pitch - angle distribution is concentrated parallel to the field , on the other hand , @xmath135 . in this case",
    "the solution of equations ( [ eq : rg_disk ] ) or ( [ eq : rg_limb ] ) with @xmath136 is @xmath137 , meaning that there is no position within the loop to satisfy the condition for strong radiation .",
    "neither of these cases results in the microwave propagation .",
    "we calculated the gyrosynchrotron intensity from the approximation of @xcite , which is valid when ambient plasma density at the emission site is so low that the absorptions and the razin suppression are not important .",
    "we have to use a more exact formula of the gyrosynchrotron intensity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in case that microwaves are produced at the high - density site in which these effects are important .    as well as the intensity",
    ", one can utilize the degree of circular polarization of the gyrosynchrotron radiation for diagnostics of the pitch - angle distribution of parent electrons ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite found from their numerical calculations that the degree of polarization increases when the electron pitch - angle distribution is more anisotropic and/or the line of sight is more parallel to rather than perpendicular to the magnetic field line . propagating electrons in a converging magnetic loop",
    "have a more anisotropic distribution at the footpoint than the loop top .",
    "furthermore , it is expected for the disk flares ( top view ) that the magnetic field line at the footpoint is close to parallel to the line of sight .",
    "therefore , gyrosynchrotron emission is more likely to be polarized at the footpoint than the top of the electron - propagating loop .",
    "the 1999 august 28 flare certainly showed that the degree of polarization increases toward the footpoints from the loop top ( see fig . 2 in y2002 )",
    ", agrees with the above statement .",
    "the propagating feature of the microwave source gives us great opportunities to study the gyrosynchrotron radiation mechanism and the electron transport , and to constrain the pitch - angle distribution of the injected electrons which is crucially important to understand the electron acceleration mechanism . as is evident from many hard x - ray observations showing footpoint sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , propagation of electrons and the microwave source along the loop commonly occurs in the flare . however , detection of such phenomena is quite difficult .",
    "the 1999 august 28 flare is the unique event in that norh detected the microwave propagating feature during its observational period until end of 2004 since its operation start in 1992 june @xcite .",
    "this event was an extremely well resolved one in both space and time by norh .",
    "for further study , improvement of radio observatories is important .",
    "observations with high temporal ( @xmath138 ) and spatial ( @xmath139 ) resolutions more clearly resolve the microwave source because it propagates with a speed close to the speed of light along a loop with typical length @xmath140 .",
    "such observations should be implemented at frequencies greater than @xmath141 which correspond to the optically - thin regime of the microwave emission in typical solar flares , to obtain the spectral property of non - thermal electrons .",
    "since the gyrosynchrotron radiation depends on the viewing angle with respect to the loop , the center - to - limb variation of the microwave distribution is studied to address the electron distribution in the loop .",
    "such study has been carried out statistically by e.g. , @xcite and @xcite with spatially - unresolved data . statistical study on the center - to - limb variation of the spatial distribution of the microwave emission",
    "further gives constraints on the pitch - angle distribution of the injection electrons .",
    "our numerical study will be of help to the future observational study for understanding the electron dynamics in solar flares .",
    "we would like to thank m. hoshino , k. makishima , m. fujimoto , s. masuda , and s. tsuneta for fruitful discussions and variable comments .",
    "we also thank k. shibasaki , m. shimojo , a. asai , and h. nakajima for discussions and advises on the norh data .",
