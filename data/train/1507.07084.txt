    "the anti - de sitter / conformal field theory ( ads / cft ) duality @xcite provides a powerful relation between a theory of gravity in ( d+1 ) dimensional ads bulk space - time and a quantum field theory at the boundary of the bulk . on the boundary , basic properties of a d - dimensional superconductor such as ; critical temperature , phase transition ,",

    "the general @xmath0-type non - minimal models with vanishing scalar field and cosmological constant were considered to find solutions to the problems such as dark matter , dark energy , gravitational waves and primordial magnetic fields in the universe @xcite-@xcite . in the previous article @xcite , we have considered the holographic superconductor with arbitrary and perturbatively small coupling constants , and obtained a relation for critical temperature and condensation as approximate analytical solution .",
    "it is interesting to find how the description of the holographic superconductor change when we consider numeric solutions to this model .    in this study",
    "we investigate numeric properties of the non - minimal model with arbitrary coupling constants @xmath7 and compare them with approximate analytic results in the probe limit .",

    "we have also the regularity condition at the horizon @xmath70 :    @xmath71    we obtain numerical solutions of the general non - minimal @xmath0-type holographic superconductors with the boundary conditions ( [ solasy ] ) and ( [ sagasy ] ) . in figures 1 and 2 , we give the solutions of the condensates @xmath65 and @xmath66 depending on the relative temperature @xmath72 for different @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "the coupling constants @xmath73 and @xmath74 appears as the same combination @xmath75 in these differential equations ( [ phi1 ] ) , ( [ psi1 ] ) and ( [ ax ] ) . thus one can choose either @xmath76 or @xmath77 without loss of generality . in figure 1 ,",
    "the cases with @xmath78 are obtained by setting @xmath79 and @xmath80 , respectively .",

    "we note that the condensates of the general @xmath0-type model have similar behaviors with the condensates of the special combination of @xmath0 corrections in @xcite .",
    "but these results are completely different from the effects of the weyl corrections discussed in @xcite .",
    "[ tcg ] +    a comparison of the numerical and approximate analytical results for the dependence of the critical temperature @xmath94 to the coupling parameters @xmath2 and @xmath1 can be found in figure 3 .",
    "the approximate analytic results deviate from the numeric solutions after @xmath95 , excessively .",
    "this implies that there is an upper limit as @xmath96 in the approximate analytic results .",
    "we see from figure 3-(a ) the critical temperature @xmath94 will increase as the coupling parameter @xmath1 increases for the condensates .",
    "thus the formation of scalar hair becomes more easier .",
    "but @xmath2 does not have any important effect on the critical temperature for @xmath97 , see figure 3-(b ) .",
    "however , when @xmath90 , this situation of @xmath2 will change .",
    "we give the formation of condensates in figure 4 for the last case .",
    "in this section , we investigate electrical conductivity of the general non - minimal @xmath0-type holographic superconductors . since the current one - form @xmath98 on the boundary is related with the maxwell potential one - form in the bulk , we consider the perturbed maxwell potential @xmath99 , which has only x - component and find the following differential equation from maxwell field equation :    @xmath100 a_x''+ \\left [ \\frac{3\\beta z^2}{z^3 - 1 }   + \\frac{12a_1z^2(2z^3 + 1 ) } { z^3 - 1 } \\right ] a_x ' \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\left [ \\frac{\\beta \\omega^2 } { ( z^3 - 1)^2 }    + \\frac{4a_1 \\omega^2(z^3 + 2 ) } { ( z^3 - 1)^2 } + \\frac{2\\psi^2}{z^3 -1 } \\right ] a_x = 0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we have the following ingoing wave boundary condition near horizon ( z=1 ) : @xmath101 and the asymptotic ads boundary condition at @xmath58 : @xmath102 the conductivity of the dual superconductor is calculated from @xmath103    we calculate numerically the conductivities depending on the frequency @xmath104 using ( [ ax ] ) , ( [ psi1 ] ) , ( [ phi1 ] ) with the above boundary conditions .",
    "these results from the condensate @xmath105 are illustrated in figure 5 for different @xmath2 values with @xmath106 and for different @xmath1 values with @xmath107 .",
    "+    in figure 5 , we see that there is a gap in the conductivity with the gap frequency @xmath108 and the gap rises quickly near the gap frequency which corresponds to the minimum of the imaginary part . furthermore , the value of the gap frequency decreases ( from right to left ) as the parameter @xmath109 increase ( from bottom to top ) .",
    "but , while @xmath106 , @xmath2 does not have any important effect on the value of the gap frequency and it has nearly the same gap frequency with the minimal coupling case ( @xmath110 and @xmath92 ) , that is ; @xmath3 . on the other hand , the effect of the smaller @xmath4 or @xmath1 is shown as gradually stronger and narrower the coherence peak .",
    "these results support the previous findings obtained from the holographic models with the special @xmath0 correction in @xcite and weyl correction in @xcite .",
    "this shows that the correction terms with @xmath1 , will have important effects on the gap frequency for the strongly coupled model .",
    "as we see the curves for @xmath86 in figure 6 , there is another type of choice with @xmath111 and @xmath112 in the conductivity . in this case",
    "the gap frequency has more shifts according to the case @xmath111 and @xmath113 .",
    "the smaller @xmath2 parameters lead to the bigger deviations for @xmath90 , especially ; for @xmath114 .",

    ", we see that the horizontal lines in the real part of the conductivity represent the cases with the temperatures @xmath119 and in these cases we can not observe any condensation .",
