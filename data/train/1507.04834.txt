    "the dynamics of electroweak symmetry breaking has become even more mysterious after the discovery of the higgs boson .",
    "it is widely believed that the standard model is merely an effective theory of the electroweak symmetry breaking and some unknown physics or dynamics should exist behind it .",
    "many possibilities , mainly motivated by naturalness , have been examined , for example , dynamical symmetry breaking by strong coupling gauge interactions @xcite , radiative symmetry breaking with @xcite or without supersymmetric extensions @xcite , hosotani mechanism in the gauge - higgs unification with extra dimensions @xcite and so on .",
    "it is also an important issue to pursue the origin of the masses of quarks and leptons , namely , how the electroweak symmetry breaking is mediated to them . in the standard model it is simply described by yukawa couplings , and",
    "much efforts have been made to derive realistic yukawa couplings .",
    "model buildings with d - branes in string theory are most attractive , because yukawa couplings can be understood by configurations of d - branes in the six - dimensional compact space of ten - dimensional superstring theories .",
    "some examples are intersecting d - brane models @xcite or models of d - branes at singularities @xcite .",
    "in these models , massless states of string with appropriate quantum numbers are identified with the higgs doublet fields , but it will be generically difficult to obtain small vacuum expectation values of the weak scale in the string theory setup .    in this paper we propose a new mechanism of spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking by assuming that our 3 dimensional space consists of revolving d - branes around a fixed point in 9 + 1 dimensional space - time . as a simple model , we study d - branes at fixed points of a @xmath0 orbifold in type iib superstring theory @xcite .",
    "we assume that all the moduli , except for the d - brane moduli , are stabilized .",
    "the six - dimensional torus is assumed to be factorizable , @xmath9 , and the action of @xmath10 is described by the twist vector @xmath11 .",
    "there are three fixed points in each @xmath12 and 27 fixed points in total .",
    "we distribute d3-branes and d7-branes and their anti - branes so as to cancel the twisted r - r tadpoles at each fixed point as well as the untwisted r - r tadpoles in the compact space . as a result",
    "all supersymmetries in the type iib superstring theory are broken through the `` brane supersymmetry breaking '' mechanism @xcite .",
    "in particular , we consider a system of four d3-branes and three anti - d7-branes discussed in @xcite .",
    "three of four d3-branes can move away from the fixed point in a @xmath10 invariant way , and the separation of these d3-branes causes spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking of u@xmath13u@xmath14u@xmath15 u@xmath16u@xmath17 on the world - volume theory on the d3-branes .",
    "the rank of the gauge group is reduced due to the identification of three d3-branes by the @xmath10 action .",
    "the reduction of rank is actually necessary in the electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "when we put anti - d7-branes on the fixed point as well as the d3-branes , there appears an attractive force between the d3-branes and the anti - d7-branes , and when d3-branes move away from the fixed point , they are forced to be pulled back .",
    "thus d3-branes tend to be localized at the fixed point , and the gauge symmetry breaking does not occur unless there exists an additional balancing force that repels d3-branes from the fixed point . in this paper",
    ", we consider revolution of the d3-branes whose centrifugal force balances against the attractive force .    in section [ sec : d - branes_at_singularities ] we give a brief review of the models with d3-branes and d7-branes at the orbifold fixed points of a @xmath0 orbifold .",
    "we explain how the vacuum expectation values of the d - brane moduli fields describe the displacements of the d3-branes . in section",
    "[ sec : rotating_d3-branes ] the world - volume theory of revolving d3-branes is introduced .",
    "the effect of revolution is an introduction of the centrifugal potential in the rest frame of the revolving d3-branes . in section [ sec : symmetry_breaking ] the spectrum in the world - volume theory is discussed .",
    "we find that the spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking takes place and the scale of the expectation value is stable against the string scale perturbations . in section [ sec : conclusion ] , we conclude and discuss some important issues not studied in details in the present paper .",
    "general ideas and formulations of d - branes at orbifold fixed points are discussed in @xcite . in this section",
    "we particularly consider the models with d3-branes , d7-branes and their anti - branes in a @xmath18 orbifold .",

    "we also identify points on the torus transformed by the @xmath10 action @xmath26 where @xmath11 is the twist vector .",
    "there are three fixed points in each two - torus under the above identifications , and in total 27 fixed points in the @xmath0 orbifold .",
    "since the string world - sheet fields should follow the same identifications as the coordinates @xmath21 , there is an untwisted closed string propagating in the ten - dimensional space - time , and twisted closed strings localized at each fixed point .",

    ", we discuss the low energy spectrum of the d3anti - d7 brane system with the above potential .",
    "since the potential @xmath179 depends only on the combination @xmath180 , mass term appears only in the _ breathing _ mode that changes the magnitude of the same combination . in the rotating reference frame on the third torus , without loss of generality",

    "this satisfies the d - flat condition .",
    "note that we are now in the rotating reference frame of the d3-branes and the vacuum expectation value is set stationary without the phase .",
    "the breathing mode @xmath182 is defined as that to change the magnitude of @xmath180 , @xmath183 the normalization of the @xmath182 field is chosen so that the kinetic term becomes canonical . inserting this into the potential @xmath184",

    "of course , it is much larger than the corresponding `` mass '' obtained from the critical density @xmath191 of our current universe @xmath192 .",
    "it is nothing but the cosmological constant problem , since the energy scale of the tension of d3-brane is typically as large as the string scale and much larger than the energy scale of the dark energy at the present universe , i.e. mev . the total angular momentum of the d3-brane is thus given by @xmath193 in the second equality , we dropped numerical factors and used @xmath194 and @xmath195 . when we put , e.g. @xmath196 , the angular momentum is roughly @xmath197 .",
    "hence , we can treat the revolution of the d3-brane classically . though the angular velocity @xmath128 is as huge as the string scale , the velocity of the revolution is non - relativistic if the vacuum expectation value is much smaller than the string scale .",
    "for example , if @xmath198 , the radius of the revolution is @xmath199 .",
    "then the velocity of the revolving d3-brane is given by @xmath200 , and the motion is quite non - relativistic .",
    "the acceleration is given by @xmath201 , and it is again much smaller than the string scale .",
    "it justifies the validity of the dbi action and its expansions .",
    "in this section we investigate the low - energy spectrum of the world - volume theory with revolving d3-branes on the third torus , and calculate the masses of various fields .",
    "we also discuss stability of the vacuum expectation value .",

    "the potential @xmath184 is the supersymmetry breaking potential induced by the anti - d7-branes and the revolution of d3-branes discussed in the previous section .",

    "next let us calculate the mass spectrum of the scalar fields .",
    "as we discussed at the end of the previous section , since the potential @xmath184 is a function of a single combination of fields , only the breathing mode of eq .",

    "this mode corresponds to changing the positions of revolving d3-branes without changing their relative positions and the distance from the origin .",
    "this global symmetry is the anomalous u@xmath248 symmetry of the full theory with the superpotential of eq .",
    "( [ superpotential ] ) , and accordingly the corresponding scalar field becomes massive .",
    "the following arguments indicate stability of the mass spectrum of the scalar fields against radiative corrections .",
    "the spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs due to the potential @xmath184 in eq .",

    "then the symmetry breaking of the global u@xmath250 symmetry produces one massive `` higgs '' boson and nine massless nambu - goldstone bosons . in presence of the gauge interactions , four of these nine nambu - goldstone bosons",
    "are absorbed into the gauge bosons through the higgs mechanism , and the remaining five scalars become massive as pseudo - nambu - goldstone bosons ( pngbs ) , because the corresponding u@xmath250 symmetries are explicitly broken by the gauge interactions . the radiative correction to the mass of the pngb",
    "is protected by the approximate symmetry .",
    "the mass spectrum of the pngb is generally written as the dashen formula @xcite @xmath252 \\rangle,\\ ] ] where @xmath253 is the decay constant and @xmath254 is the broken generator corresponding to the fluctuation of the pngb around the minimum , and stable under radiative corrections so long as the coupling is weak @xcite . in our scenario",
    "the vacuum expectation value @xmath129 is determined in terms of the initial angular momentum of the d3-branes which is conserved .",
    "hence , it is fixed by the input of the initial condition , not by the field theory itself .",
    "this guarantees the stability of the value of the distance between the revolving d3-branes and the fixed point where anti - d7-branes are localized . in this geometrical way the symmetry breaking scale",
    "is invariant , we discuss possible decay of the revolution radius ( i.e. , the vacuum expectation value ) through emissions of massless closed string states . ] .",
    "furthermore , since the mass of the @xmath255 field is much heavier than the other scalar fields , quantum fluctuations of the vacuum expectation value are highly suppressed in the low - energy effective theory .",

    "so far we have considered only the scalar fields @xmath110 on the third torus .",
    "let us now see how the masses for other fields @xmath67 with @xmath256 are generated .",
    "they were originally moduli fields corresponding to the motion of d3-branes along the first and second tori . when @xmath110 have the vacuum expectation values of eq .",
    "( [ z - sol - revolv ] ) , they acquire their masses through the interactions described by the f - term potential ( [ f - potential ] ) . for their fermionic superpartners",
    ", they acquire the same masses through the yukawa couplings , since the gauge symmetry breaking by the vacuum expectation value ( [ z - sol - revolv ] ) does not break supersymmetries .",
    "all the fields , which are associated with the first and second tori , obtain masses of the order of @xmath210 .",
    "thus all the d - brane moduli fields corresponding to the first and the second tori are stabilized .",
    "they may also obtain their masses through one - loop effects of open strings between d3 and anti - d7 branes , which are not supersymmetric .",
    "yukawa couplings between the scalar fields @xmath67 and the fermion fields in the chiral multiplets come from the superpotential of eq .",
    "( [ superpotential ] ) .",
    "because of the @xmath257-tensor in the superpotential , the yukawa couplings must contain at least one field associated with each of the three tori .",
    "hence , since the scalar fields @xmath110 with the nonzero vacuum expectation values couple to the fermions associated with the first and the second tori , the fermion in the first and the second tori become massive in pairs . especially , the yukawa coupling of the `` higgs boson '' , @xmath255 , with the fermions are proportional to their masses .",
    "but it is not the case for light scalar fields , @xmath258 and @xmath259 .",
    "note that the fermion fields associated with the third torus do not obtain their masses through the yukawa couplings . a brief discussion towards more realistic model constructions of the standard model is given in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in this paper , we have proposed a new mechanism of spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking in string theory with revolving d - branes around an orbifold fixed point .    in orbifold compactification of the string theory two types of d - branes",
    "are known : ordinary d - branes and fractional d - branes .",
    "the ordinary d - branes can move away from the fixed points by forming an invariant set under the orbifold projections while the fractional d - branes are localized at the fixed points .",
    "when the ordinary d - branes move away from the fixed point , the gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken with reduction of the rank of the gauge group .",
    "if the separation scale of the d - branes is shorter than the string length and their relative motion is non - relativistic , the dynamics can be well described by the low - energy world - volume theories of d - branes @xcite .",
    "the separation length corresponds to the vacuum expectation value of the d - brane moduli fields .",
    "unless supersymmetry is broken , the moduli fields have the flat potential along the vacuum expectation values .",
    "if we consider configurations of d - branes with broken supersymmetries , the flat directions will be lifted up by the one - loop corrections , whose mass scales are generically given by the string scale with a small correction of the one - loop suppression factors .",
    "such effects are responsible for attractive forces between d - branes and anti - d - branes .    in the present paper",
    ", we consider a particular model of d3 and anti - d7 branes at a fixed point of a @xmath175 orbifold . in order to stabilize the separation of d3-branes from the fixed point",
    ", we introduced revolution of d3-branes around anti - d7-branes localized at the fixed point .",
    "the revolution can be described as the time - dependent phase of the classical solution of d - brane moduli fields . in the rest frame of the revolving d3-branes",
    ", the centrifugal potential appears .",
    "this force can balance the attractive force between the d3 and anti - d7 branes .",
    "the distance of the revolving d3-branes from the fixed point is determined by the value of the angular momentum , which should be given by the initial condition of the cosmological evolution of the d - brane configuration .",
    "an important point is that the scale of the distance , namely the vacuum expectation value of the moduli fields , is determined in terms of the angular momentum and can be taken much lower than the string scale .",
    "the situation is quite similar to the revolution radius of the earth around the sun , where it was determined by the initial condition of the solar system evolution .",
    "we can imagine that the early universe are filled with gas of d - branes and anti - d - branes .",
    "they collide and some of them are annihilated , but due to the conservation of the angular momentum , some branes revolve around others .",
    "we calculated the mass spectrum of various moduli fields .",
    "the breathing mode , in which all the nonzero expectation values of the moduli fields change simultaneously , becomes super heavy as the string scale @xmath2 because the mass comes from the balance of the attractive potential between d3 and @xmath260 and the repulsive centrifugal potential . on the other hand ,",
    "the other scalar modes acquire their masses through the gauge symmetry breaking , and hence their masses are of order of the vacuum expectation value @xmath261 .",
    "they are stable under radiative corrections due to their nature of the pseudo - nambu - goldstone bosons .",
    "it is interesting to note that the stability of the scale @xmath129 is related to the stability of the geometrical distance of the revolving d3 branes from the fixed point .",
    "the distance is classically stable due to the conservation of angular momentum .",
    "now several important remarks are in order .",
    "the first remark is possible loss of the angular momentum of the revolving d3-branes by emitting massless closed string states ( gravitons or 4-form r - r field ) .",
    "if the effects are large , the revolution frequency @xmath128 decreases and the d3-branes fall into the fixed point rapidly .",
    "as we discussed at the end of section [ sec : rotating_d3-branes ] , the velocity @xmath262 and the acceleration @xmath263 are very small and the emission may be expected to be tiny . however , it is not the case since both of the tension and the r - r charge are very large . here",
    "let us estimate the emission rate of the gravitational radiation into the bulk from the revolving d3-brane by using the formula in @xcite .",
    "the energy emission rate per unit time and unit volume of the d3-brane is estimated by @xmath264 .",
    "huge factor comes from the tension of the d3-brane .",
    "the rate is very large in comparison with the kinetic energy of the revolving d3-branes per unit volume @xmath265 , even though @xmath266 is very small . if it is really the case , the stability of the vacuum expectation value will be lost .",
    "but , the formula of the emission rate may not be applicable to the present case since the typical frequency of the radiation , which is of the same order of the angular velocity of the revolution @xmath267 , is close to the cut off scale of the low - energy effective theory , @xmath2 .",
    "also , it is not certain whether radiation itself is possible since the length scale of the compact space is comparable to the typical wave length of the emitted radiation .",
    "furthermore , the ns - ns tadpoles are not cancelled in this non - supersymmetric configurations of d - branes and we may need to take the effects of the backreaction to the space - time metric , dilaton and b - fields , which may drastically change the emission rate of radiation .",
    "so more detailed analysis will be necessary to give the correct estimates of the emission rate .",
    "the second remark is a possibility of a modification of gravity in the ir region .",
    "one may expect that the revolution of d3-branes affects the gravity in the ir region since our model is similar to the ghost condensation @xcite . in both of the ghost condensation and our setting ,",
    "the time - dependent classical solutions of the scalar fields play an important role . in the ghost condensation",
    ", @xmath268 has a non - vanishing vacuum expectation value at the minimum @xmath269 of the function @xmath270 .",
    "then the field can be expanded around the time - dependent solution @xmath271 , which breaks the poincar symmetry .",
    "writing @xmath272 , we have @xmath273",
    ". then the kinetic term @xmath270 becomes @xmath274 \\",
    "\\dot{\\varphi}^2 $ ] .",
    "the @xmath275 term is absent , and the ir dispersion relation is drastically modified as @xmath276 . in our case of the revolving d - branes , the time - dependent solution appears not because it gives a minimum of the kinetic term but it is due to the centrifugal potential in the rest frame of the d - branes . because of this ,",
    "if the centrifugal potential is stronger than the tension of the brane and each point of the brane is bound strongly at the minimum of the potential , the spectrum of the fluctuation seems to keep the lorentz invariance and different from the case of the ghost condensation .",
    "but lorentz invariance is generally broken due to the revolution , especially if the tension is comparable to the centrifugal potential .",
    "we come back to this issue in near future .",
    "the third remark is a construction of more realistic models of particle physics .",
    "there have been many efforts to construct realistic models in the system of d - branes at orbifold fixed points or other singular points , in general ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "though the aim of this paper is not to propose a realistic model , some interesting structures of realistic models are included in the model we have discussed above . for example , following @xcite , we can identify the subgroup su@xmath69 in u@xmath69 as the standard model su@xmath277 group and a non - anomalous combination of u@xmath17 symmetries , @xmath278 , as the u@xmath279 in the standard model . here",
    "@xmath254 , @xmath280 and @xmath281 are charges of u@xmath17 in u@xmath69 , u@xmath70 and u@xmath64 , respectively . in the identification",
    ", the value of the weinberg angle becomes @xmath282 .",
    "since the charges are normalized to take values of @xmath283 , we can identify the scalar component of @xmath284 as a higgs doublet field ( @xmath285 ) , the fermion components of @xmath286 as the left - handed lepton doublets of the first and the second generations ( @xmath287 ) , and the fermion components of @xmath288 as the right - handed neutrinos of the first and the second generations ( @xmath289 ) . in this simple",
    "setting , the yukawa couplings are originated from the superpotential of eq .",
    "( [ superpotential ] ) and give large masses to neutrinos .",
    "it would be interesting to try to construct more realistic models with quarks and leptons in the framework of the spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking by the revolution of d - branes .",
    "the fourth remark is a realization of an inflationary universe with the revolving d - branes . in the present paper",
    ", we treated the bulk space - time as the flat minkowski , but of course it receives huge backreaction effects , since the configuration is not supersymmetric . in the following , instead of solving the bulk 10-dimensional einstein equation , we study time - evolution of the induced metric on the d3-branes @xcite . since d3-branes are isotropic and homogeneous , the time - evolution of the metric will be described by the frw universe with the scale factor @xmath146 . in the frw universe ,",
    "the solution to the equation of motion is changed from eq .",
    "( [ classical - solution - massivescalar ] ) to @xmath290 this solution is valid when the oscillation frequency @xmath126 is larger than the hubble parameter @xmath291 . in the opposite case @xmath292 , the field is frozen so that the prefactor is almost constant .",
    "such a scale factor dependence is understandable since the oscillation in a harmonic potential behaves as non - relativistic particles and the energy density @xmath293 must decay as @xmath294 .",
    "now suppose that d3-branes , while they are rotating , start rolling down along the potential from a larger value of @xmath295 to the stabilized point @xmath129 .",
    "the current @xmath296 is proportional to @xmath297 . due to an additional factor @xmath298 in the current conservation @xmath299",
    ", the same quantity @xmath300 is conserved .",
    "the hamiltonian density @xmath223 for @xmath301 becomes @xmath302 the minimum of the potential is given by the same value @xmath303 .",
    "the pressure density @xmath49 is given by changing the sign of the second term as @xmath304 this is because the first term ( centrifugal potential ) is originated from the kinetic energy while the second one comes from the attractive interaction between d3 and anti - d7 branes . denoting the ratio of @xmath295 to @xmath305 by @xmath306 , @xmath223 and @xmath49 can be written as @xmath307 and @xmath308 .",
    "then the equation of state becomes @xmath309 it is interesting that the equation of state of the revolving motion interpolates between @xmath310 and @xmath311 . at the final stage of the evolution ,",
    "d3-branes are stabilized at @xmath312 and the equation of state is @xmath311 .",
    "the energy density is then given by @xmath313 .",
    "on the other hand , in the initial stage of the cosmic evolution , the second term @xmath293 in @xmath223 and @xmath49 dominates the first term and the equation of state is @xmath310 . in this case , the field is frozen and the prefactor @xmath294 is replaced by a constant .",
    "then the energy density becomes @xmath314 , which gives the hubble constant of the inflationary universe caused by the revolving d3-branes . in this scenario ,",
    "the radial direction of the revolving d - branes , @xmath315 , plays a role of the inflaton field , similar to the brane - inflation model @xcite .",
    "similar angular motions of d - branes in the dbi inflation scenario has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "the final remark is about possible modifications of the background geometry of the compact space due to introductions of the three - form fluxes and additional ( anti)-d - branes for the moduli stabilization .",
    "the form of the angular momentum conservation might be modified as well as the attractive potential .",
    "but as far as the rotational symmetry is preserved and the angular momentum is conserved , the essential mechanism will not be changed much .",
    "the non - trivial modification of the background geometry could make it easier to obtain the small scale of the gauge symmetry breaking in comparison to the string scale , as is the case in the warped geometries @xcite .",
    "each of the above mentioned issues is very interesting , but needs more careful and detailed investigations .",

    "<S> a set of three d3-branes at an orbifold fixed point can separate from the point , but when they move perpendicular to the anti - d7-branes put on the fixed point , they are forced to be pulled back due to an attractive interaction between the d3 and anti - d7 branes . in order to stabilize the separation of the d3-branes at nonzero distance , </S>",
    "<S> we consider revolution of the d3-branes around the fixed point . </S>",
    "<S> then the gauge symmetry on d3-branes is spontaneously broken , and the rank of the gauge group is reduced </S>",
    "<S> . the distance can be set at our will by appropriately choosing the angular momentum of the revolving d3-branes , which should be determined by the initial condition of the cosmological evolution of d - brane configurations . </S>",
    "<S> the distance corresponds to the vacuum expectation values of brane moduli fields in the world - volume theory and , if it is written as @xmath1 in terms of the string scale @xmath2 , the scale of gauge symmetry breaking is given by @xmath3 . </S>",
