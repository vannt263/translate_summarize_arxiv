    "ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) contain the regions of most intense star formation in the local universe .",
    "although their high rates of star formation and accretion appear to be triggered by the merger of two gas - rich galaxies @xcite , the detailed physical connection between galaxy mergers and star formation and , in particular , the time evolution of this process , is not well understood .",
    "relating numerical hydrodynamical models @xcite to observations is complicated by the difficulty in identifying the precise stage of the merger @xcite .",
    "in addition , while high resolution imaging has found that most ulirgs have nuclear separations from @xmath70.3 kpc to 48 kpc @xcite , other strongly interacting galaxies with these nuclear separations which are _ not _ ulirgs have also been found @xcite .",
    "these observations suggest that the onset of the intense star formation and accretion which produces a ulirg is not a simple function of the age of the merger and leaves open the question of whether all luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs @xmath8 , where @xmath9 erg @xmath10 s@xmath11 and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the iras fluxes in jy at 60 and 100 @xmath4 m @xcite . ] ; @xmath14 ) will pass through a ulirg phase ( @xmath15 ) at some point in their evolution .",
    "local ulirgs are also important as the closest analogs to the high - redshift submillimeter galaxies ( smgs ; * ? ? ?",
    "both populations have high infrared luminosities , large amounts of molecular gas @xcite , and morphological evidence of recent or ongoing mergers @xcite .",
    "since galaxy merger rates are substantially higher in the early universe @xcite , understanding the physical and dynamical properties of nearby ulirgs is also important for understanding the processes in the early universe which give rise to the very luminous submillimeter galaxy population .    because molecular gas is the fuel for current and future star formation , the physical properties and distribution of the warm , dense molecular gas are crucial for understanding the processes and timescales controlling star formation in galaxy mergers .",
    "previous high - resolution studies of molecular gas in luminous infrared galaxies have used primarily the ground - state rotational transition of co , which is sensitive to gas as cold as 10  k @xcite , with a few galaxies observed in the co j=2 - 1 line @xcite . however , since the co j=3 - 2 line traces the warmer and denser gas , it is more likely to be directly associated with the starburst activity and/or fueling of the active galactic nuclei ( agn ) in these galaxies .",
    "indeed , observations of the co j=3 - 2 emission in two luminous infrared galaxies , vv 114 @xcite and ngc 6090 @xcite , reveal that the large - scale distribution and kinematics of the co j=3 - 2 line can be significantly different from those of the co j=1 - 0 line . in this paper , we present new data obtained with the submillimeter array ( sma ) for a sample of fourteen luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies in the co j=3 - 2 , co j=2 - 1 , @xmath2co j=2 - 1 , and hco@xmath3 j=4 - 3 lines . in addition",
    ", we present new high - resolution observations of continuum emission at 880 @xmath4 m and 1.3 mm , which allow us to study the dust properties in the central kiloparsec of the galaxies .",
    "this sma legacy survey aims to address five broad scientific questions :    1 .",
    "_ what are the distributions , kinematics , and physical conditions of dense molecular gas in u / lirgs ? _",
    "the high resolution co j=3 - 2 data cubes trace the distribution of the warm and dense gas that feeds the starburst ( and any accretion ) activity in these luminous galaxies .",
    "the new sma co j=3 - 2 , j=2 - 1 , and @xmath2co j=2 - 1 data can be combined with published co j=1 - 0 and j=2 - 1 data for a detailed investigation of the physical properties of the molecular gas using large velocity gradient ( lvg , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and monte carlo @xcite models as our primary diagnostic tools .",
    "the co j=3 - 2 kinematics allow us to study the detailed gas dynamics in the inner few hundred parsecs , yielding measurements of the total enclosed mass and of the local linewidth that is a parameter in models of disk turbulence .",
    "the combination of morphology and kinematics offers clues to the geometry of each merger via comparison of the separation and orientation of the galaxy nuclei with the results from numerical simulations ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* for an analysis of arp 220 ) .",
    "_ what is the distribution of the dust in u / lirgs ? _ the 880 @xmath4 m continuum images trace the spatial distribution of the cold and warm ( 1070 k ) dust , which reflects both the local rate of star formation activity and the available mass of gas .",
    "the submillimeter dust emission is often significantly more compact than that of co ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) arising exclusively from deep in the gravitational potential wells of the galactic nuclei .",
    "high - resolution continuum images from the sma can be combined with spectra from the _ spitzer space telescope _ ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to estimate the dust temperature via the mid - infrared to submillimeter spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , the dust mass ( including both small and large grains , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and , indirectly , the gas mass based on 3d radiative transfer modeling @xcite .",
    "in addition , these spatially resolved seds of local u / lirgs will improve our interpretation of the templates used for determining photometric redshifts of high - redshift submillimeter galaxies @xcite .",
    "do the gas properties change as the interaction progresses ?",
    "_ our sample of fourteen u / lirgs covers a range from mid to late merger stages and should be sufficiently large that we can establish a merger sequence through comparison of global morphologies with numerical models @xcite .",
    "this data set allows us to determine how the distribution and kinematics of the gas change as a function of physical conditions such as density and temperature , or vice versa , and to correlate those changes with the stage of the merger .",
    "this type of detailed gas physics on small scales still poses challenges for numerical simulations .",
    "thus , on large scales , where the dynamics of the system are well described by the models , the numerical simulations can help with the interpretation of the data , while on smaller scales , the data can drive the development of more accurate descriptions for the gas physics in the simulations .",
    "_ how do the properties of the dense gas in local u / lirgs compare to those of the gas in high - redshift submillimeter galaxies ? _ armed with a robust local sample of fourteen u / lirgs , we can make a rigorous comparison of the properties of the gas with those in higher redshift galaxies @xcite .",
    "changes in gas characteristics over the age of the universe will reveal important information about the process of star formation and ultimately the formation and evolution of galaxies at early times . 5 .",
    "_ what is the origin of nuclear oh megamasers ?",
    "bright 1667 mhz oh megamaser emission is observed in the nuclei of some luminous infrared galaxies , including five galaxies in our sample ( iras 17208 - 0014 , mrk 231 , mrk 273 , ugc 5101 and arp 299 ) .",
    "these extremely bright masers are promising tracers of dust - obscured star formation and mergers at high redshifts , and could ultimately be used to estimate the merger rate as a function of redshift @xcite . however , in order to use oh megamasers as high - redshift probes , we need to understand whether there is a specific type or stage of merger that leads to oh maser emission .",
    "whether maser emission occurs is likely governed by the physical , chemical , and kinematic conditions in the molecular gas in the nuclear regions of the mergers .",
    "for example , using global co and hcn luminosities , @xcite concludes that oh megamasers are associated with high mean molecular gas densities and high dense gas fractions . our sample , which contains galaxies with and without megamasers , is well suited for identifying any unique nuclear conditions that produce oh megamasers in luminous infrared galaxies .    in this paper",
    ", we describe the sample selection , observations , and reduction of the survey data (   [ sec - obs ] ) .",
    "we also examine the gas to dust mass ratio in the central kiloparsec (   [ sec - gasdust ] ) and correlations between the central gas mass , gas surface density , infrared luminosity , dust temperature , and co j=3 - 2/2 - 1 line ratio (   [ sec - corr ] ) .",
    "a companion paper presents a detailed analysis of the galaxy vv 114 @xcite ; a detailed analysis of ngc 6240 is given in @xcite .",
    "future papers will compare the results from this survey with similar observations of high - redshift submillimeter galaxies @xcite ; examine the physical properties of the molecular gas by combining molecular line observations with radiative transfer models ; use the molecular gas data to place constraints on the origin of the oh megamaser activity seen in some of the galaxies in our sample ; compare the properties of the cold gas and dust as seen with the sma with the properties of the warm dust derived from _",
    "data ; and compare the molecular gas and dust properties with the predictions of numerical simulations to place the galaxies into a merger sequence .",
    "for this survey , we selected a sample of luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies with redshifts @xmath16 ( distances @xmath0 mpc , adopting @xmath17 km s@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) and far - infrared luminosities @xmath1 .",
    "the distance limit was chosen to allow spatial resolutions of order 1 kpc or better in all the target galaxies .",
    "the luminosity cutoff was chosen to allow us to span a wide range of merger properties and luminosities while still concentrating on the most infrared - luminous nearby galaxies . out of a total of 39 galaxies above declination -20@xmath20 @xcite which meet these two criteria , we selected for this survey 14 galaxies with previous interferometric observations in the co j=1 - 0 transition .",
    "the galaxies observed in this survey are listed in table  [ tbl - sample ] and shown in figure  [ fig - dss_beam ] .",
    "the sample includes five systems in which the two progenitor galaxies are still distinct ( arp 299 , arp 55 , vv 114 , ngc 5331 , and ngc 5257/8 ) ; the remaining nine galaxies show a single central concentration .",
    "compared to the full sample of 39 galaxies , the sample observed with the sma has a much higher fraction of galaxies with a large far - infrared flux ( 86% with @xmath21  jy compared to 44% for the full sample ) .",
    "the sma sample contains a higher proportion of nearby galaxies ( 29% with @xmath22 compared to 15% for the full sample ) , although the mean distance of the sma sample is only 4% smaller than the mean distance of the full sample .",
    "the sma sample also has a higher proportion of more luminous galaxies ( 29% with @xmath23 compared to 13% for the full sample ) , and has a mean far - infrared luminosity that is 35% larger ( 0.13 in @xmath24 ) than the full sample .",
    "thus , the sample of galaxies discussed in this paper is slightly biased towards more luminous galaxies than the full luminosity and distance limited sample .",
    "observations with the submillimeter array ( sma : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) were obtained between 2005 may 16 and 2007 may 2 .",
    "the correlator was configured to have a spectral resolution of 0.8125 mhz ( typically @xmath25 km s@xmath11 for co j=3 - 2 and @xmath26 km s@xmath11 for co j=2 - 1 ) and a bandwidth of 2 ghz , which was covered by 24 `` chunks '' overlapping slightly in frequency in each of the upper and lower sidebands .",
    "each galaxy was observed with the co j=3 - 2 transition in the lower sideband of the receiver and continuum in the upper sideband , 10 ghz away .",
    "the hco@xmath3 j=4 - 3 line lies in the high - frequency end of the upper sideband window and was detected in seven of the galaxies in our sample .",
    "in addition , nine galaxies were observed in the co and @xmath2co j=2 - 1 lines and in 1.3 mm continuum in a single tuning .",
    "it was not possible to also include the c@xmath27o j=2 - 1 line in our passband due to the broad lines of these galaxies .",
    "each galaxy was observed in a single configuration of the sma , either the extended array ( unprojected baselines of 50 to 182 m ) or the compact array ( unprojected baselines of 16 to 69 m ) . the largest angular scale to which these data are sensitive , as calculated from the minimum @xmath28 distance that the data sample well , ranges from 12 - 16@xmath29 ( 19 - 25@xmath29 ) for the compact array co j=3 - 2 ( j=2 - 1 ) data to 7 - 10@xmath29 ( 10 - 15@xmath29 ) for the extended array co j=3 - 2 ( j=2 - 1 ) data . the configuration used in each case",
    "was chosen to yield a spatial resolution of 0.7 - 1 kpc in the co j=3 - 2 line ; the typical angular resolution at this wavelength is 2.5@xmath29 for the compact configuration and 0.9@xmath29 for the extended configuration .",
    "the exceptions were ngc 2623 in co j=2 - 1 , and ngc 6240 and iras 17208 - 0014 in co j=3 - 2 , which were observed in both the extended and compact arrays , and ngc 5257/8 , which was observed in both the compact and sub - compact arrays . for a given galaxy ,",
    "the same configuration was used for both the co j=2 - 1 and the co j=3 - 2 observations .",
    "the field of view of the sma is @xmath30 for the co j=2 - 1 data and @xmath31 for the co j=3 - 2 data .",
    "three of the galaxies have sufficiently extended co emission that a small mosaic of two ( arp 299 , ngc 5331 ) or three ( ngc 5257/58 ) pointings was used .",
    "the data for each line - configuration combination in each galaxy were obtained in a single night s observing except for ngc 2623 ( co j=2 - 1 extended array data ) , ngc 5257/8 ( co j=3 - 2 data ) , and vv 114 ( co j=2 - 1 data ) . between 6 and 8 antennas",
    "were used in the observations and the total on - source integration time ranged from 3.0 to 13.0 hr .",
    "the typical double sideband system temperatures at transit ranged from 240 to 800 k for the co j=3 - 2 data , except for iras 17208 - 0014 , for which the values ranged from 650 to 1900 k , and from 140 to 550 k for the co j=2 - 1 data .",
    "the observing dates , on - source integration times , and sensitivities obtained with robust weighting are given in table  [ tbl - obs ] .",
    "the initial data calibration was done using the mir software package .",
    "observations of uranus , neptune , ganymede , or callisto were used to determine the current flux of the gain calibrator , which was a nearby quasar with a flux of at least 0.6 jy .",
    "the amplitude and phase gain variations with time were calibrated using this gain calibrator .",
    "antenna - based gain solutions were used throughout except for the extended array observations of ngc 2623 which required baseline - based gain solutions .",
    "bandpass calibration was determined using a strong quasar such as 3c273 , 3c279 , or 3c111 .",
    "we estimate the absolute flux calibration accuracy of these data to be 20% . however , some of the galaxies are at redshifts such that ozone lines affect the atmospheric transmission in the co j=3 - 2 line ( arp 55 , ugc 5101 ) or 880 @xmath4 m continuum ( arp 299 , mrk 273 , and , to a lesser extent , arp 55 , mrk 231 , ngc 5331 , and ugc 5101 , for which only 200 mhz of the continuum bandwidth might be affected ) ; thus , the absolute calibration for these galaxies is more uncertain . after calibration in mir ,",
    "the data were exported to miriad format @xcite for further editing and imaging .",
    "the data were first flagged to remove the six beginning and ending channels of each of the 24 chunks of the correlator .",
    "the data were also flagged to remove high amplitude data points , with typically @xmath7 1% of the data removed in this step .",
    "for a few data sets , additional flagging was used to remove data at the beginning or end of the track when deteriorating weather conditions or high system temperatures at lower elevations had caused a larger amplitude scatter .",
    "data cubes were made using velocity resolutions of 10 , 20 , and 40 km s@xmath11 for the co j=3 - 2 and j=2 - 1 lines , 20 , 40 , and 100 km s@xmath11 for the @xmath2co j=2 - 1 line , and 40 and 100 km s@xmath11 for the hco@xmath3 j=4 - 3 line . for the @xmath2co j=2 - 1 and hco@xmath3 data sets where significant continuum emission was detected ( see below ) , the continuum emission was subtracted in the @xmath28 plane using line - free channels before imaging .",
    "all data cubes were inverted with weighting by the system temperature and moderate robustness , which gives the optimal tradeoff between sensitivity and resolution .    each data cube was cleaned down to two times the rms noise , except for ngc 6240 , which was cleaned down to the rms noise . for most sources ,",
    "the beam was sufficiently clean and the emission sufficiently compact that cleaning the inner quarter of the image produced good results .",
    "however , four sources located near the equator ( iras 17208 - 0014 , ngc 5331 , ngc 5257 , and ngc 6240 ) had large sidelobes and/or extended emission and were cleaned using regions chosen by inspecting the dirty maps to isolate the emission from the galaxy ; the same fixed regions were used for all velocity channels .",
    "the final data cubes were corrected for the attenuation of the sma primary beam or the analgous response for the combined mosaic before we measured the integrated source fluxes .",
    "continuum maps at 1.3 mm and 880 @xmath4 m were made by imaging the individual line - free regions of the spectra ; there were four such regions at 1.3 mm ( one on either side of each of the co and @xmath2co j=2 - 1 lines ) and three regions at 880 @xmath4 m ( one on either side of the co j=3 - 2 line and a single broad region in the upper sideband that excluded the region of the spectrum containing possible emission from the hco@xmath3 j=4 - 3 line ) .",
    "these continuum images were then averaged together , weighting by the inverse of the product of the bandwidth of each image and the square of its noise , to obtain a single continuum image with the best sensitivity .",
    "the continuum images were not cleaned , as the signal - to - noise ratio was low and the source(s ) were generally compact and well separated from any sidelobes of the main beam .",
    "the one exception is mrk 231 , where the central source was sufficiently strong that cleaning was useful .",
    "table  [ tbl - fluxes ] gives the continuum and integrated @xmath32co , @xmath2co , and hco@xmath3 fluxes measured for the galaxies in our sample .",
    "the fluxes measured for the co j=3 - 2 line and 880 @xmath4 m continuum emission for ngc6240 differ somewhat from the values given in @xcite due to the different weighting used .",
    "previously published data for the co j=2 - 1 and j=1 - 0 lines are also given where available .",
    "figures  [ fig - i17208co32]-[fig - ngc1614co21 ] show the moment 0 , 1 , and 2 images for the co j=3 - 2 and co j=2 - 1 data , the 880 @xmath4 m and 1.3 mm dirty maps where signal was detected from the galaxy at the 3@xmath33 level or better , and the @xmath2co j=2 - 1 and hco@xmath3 j=4 - 3 integrated intensity maps , where these lines were detected . unless otherwise noted in the figure captions , the moment",
    "0 maps have been made from the 40 km s@xmath11 resolution data cube using only signal greater than @xmath34 , while the moment 1 and 2 maps have been made from the 20 km s@xmath11 resolution data cube using only positive signal greater than 4@xmath33 .",
    "these images have not been corrected for the primary beam or mosaic response .",
    "figures  [ fig - co32_mrk_iras]-[fig - co32_n1614_n5258 ] show the co j=3 - 2 spectra , figures  [ fig - co21_i10565_u5101_arp299]-[fig - co21_n1614_n5257 ] show the co j=2 - 1 spectra , figures  [ fig-13co21_arp299]-[fig-13co21_rest ] show the @xmath2co j=2 - 1 spectra and figure  [ fig - hcop ] shows the hco@xmath3 j=4 - 3 spectra . in all cases except hco@xmath3 , both the spectrum at the position of the emission peak and the spectrum integrated over the entire region with emission are shown .",
    "figures  [ fig - i17208co32]-[fig - ngc1614co21 ] reveal a diversity of morphologies and kinematics for the molecular gas in our sample of galaxies .",
    "nine of the galaxies show a predominantly compact morphology while the remaining five galaxies range from well - separated pairs of galaxies to highly complex morphologies .",
    "the galaxies with extended co emission are all found in the lower luminosity half of our sample , although some low luminosity galaxies also show a compact morphology .",
    "the source sizes derived from two - dimensional gaussian fits to the co j=3 - 2 images and the line widths ( full width at half maximum ) derived from the co j=3 - 2 spectra are tabulated in @xcite .",
    "the distributions of the co j=3 - 2 and j=2 - 1 emissions are qualitatively similar ; we will discuss the line ratio distributions in more detail in a future paper .",
    "the kinematics of the molecular gas are also quite varied . integrating over the full emission region in each galaxy ( figures  [ fig - co32_mrk_iras]-[fig - co21_n1614_n5257 ] ) , the line widths at half maximum range from 200 km s@xmath11 in mrk 231 to 650 km s@xmath11 in ugc 5101 .",
    "some of the line profiles are quite smooth and gaussian ( e.g. mrk 231 ) , while others have more of a double - peaked structure ( e.g. ugc 5101 ) .",
    "the maps of the velocity fields ( figures  [ fig - i17208co32]-[fig - ngc1614co21 ] ) show many examples of smooth and regular rotation among the more compact galaxies , although some of the compact galaxies , such as mrk 273 and ngc 6240 , are significantly distorted .",
    "two of the galaxies with extended co emission , arp 299 and vv 114 show very complex and distorted velocity fields .",
    "the maps of the velocity dispersions show that the peak velocity dispersion is commonly 80 - 100 km s@xmath11 . however , the peak velocity dispersions for iras 17208 - 0014 , mrk 273 , ugc 5101 , ngc6240 , and ngc 5331s are twice as large as the typical galaxy in our sample .",
    "the lower velocity dispersions seen for ngc 5257/8 are likely due to the lower signal - to - noise of those maps ; similarly , a lower velocity dispersion is seen for ngc 5331s in the co j=3 - 2 line than in the co j=2 - 1 line .",
    "our velocity dispersions are typically about 70% of the values measured from co band - head emission in the near - infrared @xcite . in some cases ,",
    "the lower values found in this paper may be related to the somewhat lower angular resolution of the millimeter - wave co observations , as discussed by @xcite .",
    "the near - infrared data may also overestimate the velocity dispersion if the co band - head emission is strongly peaked on the nucleus @xcite .",
    "we derive a significantly larger velocity disperion for iras 17208 - 0014 ; this may be due to the lower signal - to - noise ratio of the near - infrared spectrum for this galaxy .",
    "we detect the hco@xmath3 j=4 - 3 line in seven of the fourteen galaxies in our sample .",
    "since the weak hco@xmath3 emission is extremely compact , we compare the line strength to the peak line strength of the co j=3 - 2 line .",
    "the co / hco@xmath3 line ratios are 8 and 16 for mrk 231 and ngc 2623 , respectively , and range from @xmath357 to @xmath3532 for the other five galaxies . treating all the hco@xmath3 lines as detections rather than upper limits , and treating the detections of the eastern and central components of vv114 separately",
    ", the average line ratio is 19 with an rms deviation of 9 .",
    "however , the true average line ratio for these galaxies is likely somewhat smaller , since many of the hco@xmath3 detections are lower limits because the line emission extends to the edge of the spectral window .",
    "this line ratio is comparable to the average co / hco@xmath3 line ratio using the j=1 - 0 and j=3 - 2 lines , respectively , determined for 6 of the galaxies in our sample by @xcite , who also find a roughly constant co / hco@xmath3 line ratio as a function of l@xmath36 .",
    "high - resolution hco@xmath3 j=1 - 0 data have been published for four of the galaxies in our sample by @xcite . comparing their data with our new measurements yields hco@xmath3 j=4 - 3/j=1 - 0 line ratios of about 4 in both mrk231 and arp 299 , while this same line ratio appears to vary dramatically from place to place within vv 114 . the hcn / hco@xmath3 j=1 - 0 line ratio also varies spatially in vv 114 @xcite and in arp 299 @xcite , which suggests that there are interesting physical and/or chemical variations in the gas properties in these early - stage mergers .",
    "large variations in the hcn j=4 - 3/j=1 - 0 ratio in a sample of four galaxies are evidence for significant differences in the excitation in the gas phase @xcite .",
    "the seven galaxies detected in hco@xmath3 are the galaxies with strong centrally peaked lines , for which the ratio of the co peak flux to the full - width half - maximum of the line is greater than 1 ( table  [ tbl - dustmasspeak ] and figure  [ fig - co32_mrk_iras]-[fig - co32_n1614_n5258 ] ) .",
    "thus , it appears that we have detected hco@xmath3 in all the galaxies in our sample where we have sufficient sensitivity to detect the peak of the line in a single channel .",
    "the fact that the remaining galaxies are not detected may be attributed to insufficient sensitivity ; while it is possible that some of these galaxies may be relatively weak in hco@xmath3 compared to co , we have no direct evidence of any such line ratio variations .      of the nine galaxies observed at 230 ghz with the sma , we have detected @xmath2co j=2 - 1 emission in only four galaxies : arp 299 , vv 114 , ngc 5331s , and ngc 1614 .",
    "all of these galaxies except ngc 5331s were also detected in hco@xmath3 ; the only galaxy that was observed at 230 ghz and detected in hco@xmath3 but _ not _ in @xmath2co is ngc 2623 .",
    "this is likely because ngc 2623 is less luminous in co j=2 - 1 ( compare ngc 2623 with ngc 1614 in table  [ tbl - fluxes ] ) .",
    "given the average strength of the @xmath2co line compared to the co line in our four detections , we would not expect to detect any of the remaining galaxies in our sample at the 3 sigma level or better .      in this section ,",
    "we summarize published single - dish data for the co j=3 - 2 line and 880 @xmath4 m continuum from the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) . to these published results we add unpublished continuum and spectral line data taken from the jcmt archive .",
    "the sample of single - dish data for the co j=2 - 1 line and 1.3 mm continuum is less complete ; the available data will be discussed in a future paper .",
    "a search of the jcmt archive reveals that many of the galaxies in our sample have been observed in the co j=3 - 2 line with the jcmt with a 15@xmath29 beam .",
    "in addition , we used the jcmt to make small ( 7x7 ) nyquist - sampled maps ( program m05ac05 ) or 2@xmath37 nyquist - sampled maps with the new array receiver harp - b ( program m07ac11 ) of many of our galaxies in the co j=3 - 2 line .",
    "our ultimate goal is to combine these single - dish data with our sma data to obtain complete maps without any missing spatial frequencies .",
    "an example and discussion of this technique as applied to vv 114 is given in @xcite .",
    "these maps also can be used to estimate the total co j=3 - 2 emission from some of our galaxies . by combining our new data with archival data ,",
    "we can obtain single - dish co j=3 - 2 spectra for all the galaxies in our sample except ngc 5331 .",
    "the quality of the data varies quite significantly from one galaxy to another . for three galaxies ( vv 114 , ngc 2623 , ngc 1614 )",
    ", we have maps covering 35@xmath29 on a side that clearly include all the emission from the galaxy . for arp 299 and ngc 5258",

    "a comparison of the co j=3 - 2 fluxes recovered by the sma with the fluxes seen by the jcmt shows that the interferometric data miss a significant fraction of the co j=3 - 2 emission for eight of the galaxies in our sample . in these galaxies",

    "the 880 @xmath4 m continuum suggests that the missing continuum flux comes from dust emission associated with molecular gas in the more extended disks of the galaxies .",
    "such gas could be associated with a disk - wide starburst ( as opposed to a nuclear starburst ) or more quiescent star formation as is seen in less luminous spiral galaxies .",
    "the difference between our results and previous results for arp 220 and mrk 231 is likely due to the fading contribution from dust emission at 1.3 mm combined with the importance of non - thermal and possibly free - free emission in these two galaxies .",
    "we can use our new co j=3 - 2 and 880 @xmath4 m data to estimate the gas and dust masses , and in particular the gas - to - dust mass ratio , in the central regions of these luminous infrared galaxies .",
    "the gas - to - dust ratio is interesting because it allows us to probe the physical properties of the interstellar medium on kiloparsec scales in regions of galaxies with intense heating from starburst activity and ( perhaps ) vigorous accretion .",
    "alternatively , it can be used to provide an independent check of the gas masses determined from the co emission lines .",
    "the gas mass in the central region is a critical quantity for understanding the evolution of these galaxies , as it determines the fuel for the current activity , be it a central starburst or accretion onto an active nucleus .",

    "while this conversion factor is now reasonably well determined for normal galaxies @xcite , it has been clear for many years that the standard conversion factor does not apply to starbursting systems like the galaxies studied here @xcite .",
    "in addition , the conversion factor has been determined for the co j=1 - 0 line only .",
    "to apply the appropriate conversion factor to our co j=3 - 2 data also requires us to know or assume an appropriate co j=3 - 2/j=1 - 0 line ratio .    to calculate the h@xmath6 gas mass",
    ", we adopt the revised conversion factor advocated by @xcite , @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the h@xmath6 gas mass in @xmath52 and @xmath53 is the luminosity of the co j=1 - 0 line in k km s@xmath11 pc@xmath54 .",
    "[ this equation corresponds to a co - to - h@xmath6 conversion factor of @xmath55 h@xmath6 @xmath10 ( k km s@xmath11)@xmath11 . ] to convert our measurements in jy km s@xmath11 to units of k km s@xmath11",
    "pc@xmath54 , we use the equation @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the co integrated intensity , @xmath58 is the rest frequency of the co transition , and @xmath59 is the redshift . to determine the co j=3 - 2/j=1 - 0 line ratio , we compared the interferometric and single - dish co j=3 - 2 data discussed here with published interferometric co j=1 - 0 data of similar angular resolution @xcite , and single - dish data for mrk 231 @xcite and mrk 273 @xcite .",
    "the average single - dish line ratio for the latter two galaxies is 0.48 , while the average interferometric line ratio is 0.56 , where both values are calculated on the temperature scale . assuming absolute calibration uncertainties of 20% for both data sets , these two values agree well , and so we adopt an average co j=3 - 2/j=1 - 0 line ratio of 0.5 in calculating the h@xmath6 gas mass .",
    "thus , the h@xmath6 gas mass is calculated via @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the luminosity of the co j=3 - 2 line in k km s@xmath11 pc@xmath54 .",

    "the primary source of uncertainty in the h@xmath6 masses we have calculated is the co - to - h@xmath6 conversion factor .",
    "we have adopted here the value advocated by @xcite as being the most appropriate for ultraluminous infrared galaxies .",
    "the milky way value for this conversion factor is about 5 times larger @xcite .",
    "thus , if some of the galaxies in our sample , particularly the less luminous ones , have an interstellar medium more similar to that of the milky way than that of ultraluminous infrared galaxies , the h@xmath6 masses in tables  [ tbl - dustmass ] and  [ tbl - dustmasspeak ] could be underestimated by up to a factor of five .",
    "detailed radiative transfer and dynamical modelling can reduce the uncertainty in this factor by probing the physical conditions directly @xcite and may provide an independent determination of the co - to - h@xmath6 conversion factor , and will be presented in a future paper .",
    "a second source of uncertainty comes in our adopted value of the co j=3 - 2/j=1 - 0 line ratio .",
    "this uncertainty is probably not as large as the uncertainty caused by the co - to - h@xmath6 conversion factor , as the line ratio we have adopted as being appropriate for mrk 231 and mrk 273 agrees very well with the line ratio seen in star forming regions in more normal spiral galaxies such as m33 @xcite and in the more highly inclined galaxies from the sample of @xcite .",
    "however , many of the galaxies in the @xcite sample have line ratios of 1 - 1.4 , so if it introduces any bias , our adopted line ratio would overestimate the h@xmath6 mass by a factor of at most 2 - 3 . also , any systematic changes in the line ratio with luminosity or evolutionary phase would introduce similar systematic effects into the gas - to - dust mass ratio .",
    "a spatially resolved comparison with high resolution co j=1 - 0 images of these galaxies , which would reduce the uncertainty due to the line ratio , will be presented in a future paper ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "one major source of uncertainty in the dust masses we have calculated is the dust temperature .",
    "an alternative to assuming optically thin dust with emissivity varying as @xmath64 is to assume that the 60 and 100 @xmath4 m fluxes can be fit with an optically thick blackbody as in @xcite .",
    "this method gives , on average , dust temperatures that are 1.5 times larger and dust masses that are 0.55 times smaller than the values given here .",
    "the net result of assuming optically thick emission in the far - infrared would be to increase the gas - to - dust mass ratio by about a factor of two .",
    "conversely , if we have overestimated the dust temperature by using single component fits (  [ calc ] ) , this would have a net effect of decreasing the gas - to - dust mass ratio .",
    "another source of uncertainty comes from the value of the dust emissivity that we have assumed .",
    "a value of @xmath65 @xmath44 g@xmath11 is appropriate for moderately dense gas in star - forming regions in the galaxy @xcite , while @xcite assumed @xmath66 @xmath44 g@xmath11 @xcite in deriving dust masses for their survey of nearby galaxies .",
    "it is possible that the dust emissivity is modified drastically in the hot , dense central regions of these galaxies .",
    "however , without sufficient data at high angular resolution to fit physical dust models ( see below ) , it is impossible at the moment to determine how large an effect this might be . in any case , the dust masses determined here are likely uncertain by a factor of less than 2 due to the uncertain value of @xmath67",
    ".    the ideal procedure for determing dust mass would be to fit a detailed physical model to the full infrared spectral energy distribution , as has been done by @xcite for the dwarf galaxy ngc 1569 or @xcite for ngc 7331 .",
    "however , only near - infrared and ground - based mid - infrared data can approach the angular resolution of our 880 @xmath4 m sma data .",
    "the critical mid- and far - infrared spectral regions can be covered by the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _ , for which the angular resolution ranges from 1.5@xmath29 at 3.6 @xmath4 m to 47@xmath29 at 160 @xmath4 m . near - infrared data from _",
    "spitzer _ can probe the hot dust continuum @xcite , while data for the mid- and far - infrared part of the spectrum only allow a determination of galaxy - wide dust properties and do not isolate the central regions discussed here .",
    "in addition , diffraction - limited ground - based mid - infrared photometry at 12.5 @xmath4 m is available for nine galaxies in our sample @xcite ; however , no data beyond 30 @xmath4 m with arcsecond - scale resolution are currently available from any instrument .",
    "we defer a more detailed analysis of the dust temperature and properties inferred by combining our submillimeter data with infrared data to a future paper .",
    "the central h@xmath6 gas masses calculated from the total luminosities detected with the sma range from @xmath68 @xmath52 for ngc 5257 to @xmath69 @xmath52 for ngc 6240 while the central dust masses range from @xmath70 @xmath52 for ngc 1614 to @xmath71 @xmath52 for mrk 231 ( table  [ tbl - dustmass ] ) . the central gas - to - dust ratios also show a wide variation , from as low as 29 for arp 55(ne ) to as high as 720 for ngc 6240 . excluding the three galaxy components with non - detections in the continuum , the average gas - to - dust ratio is @xmath72 ( rms deviation 207 ) .",
    "this value is about 40% larger than the typical milky way value of @xmath73150 @xcite , and there is a large dispersion of the individual values about the average .",
    "our value is also significantly smaller than the value of 540 ( rms deviation 290 ) determined by @xcite using single - dish co j=1 - 0 data and far - infrared luminosities .",
    "however , that study adopted a co - to - h@xmath6 conversion factor that is six times larger than our value , which almost certainly results in an overestimate of the total amount of molecular gas in these galaxies . adopting the same conversion factor",
    "as used in this paper would give a gas - to - dust ratio of 90 for the data in @xcite , somewhat smaller than the ratio obtained here .",
    "the extremely low values seen for arp 55 and , to some extent , for ugc 5101 and mrk 231 may be due to a significant contribution to the 880 @xmath4 m flux from non - thermal or radio free - free emission .",
    "however , arp 55(ne ) shows no evidence for a central agn that could be a source of non - thermal emission ( see appendix ) .",
    "there is some evidence to suggest that ugc 5101 contains a buried agn ( see appendix ) , which could increase the 880 @xmath4 m flux and lead to a small overestimate in the dust mass and an underestimate of the gas - to - dust ratio .",
    "mrk 231 is the one galaxy in our sample for which a dominant agn contribution has been identified previously at millimeter wavelengths @xcite ; it is possible that we have underestimated the contribution from the agn at 880 @xmath4 m in our calculations .",
    "mrk 273 , arp 299 , ngc 6240 , and ngc 2623 have all been identified as containing an agn from x - ray data @xcite ; however , the contribution of non - thermal emission from the agn at millimeter wavelengths appears to be small ( see appendix ) .",
    "extremely high values for the gas - to - dust ratio are measured for ngc 6240 , vv 114 , and ngc 1614 . for ngc 6240",
    ", the very broad co emission line reduces the bandwidth available to measure the continuum flux and produces a large uncertainty in the flux .",
    "in addition , the co j=3 - 2 emission may be moderately optically thin @xcite , which could result in the gas mass being overestimated .",
    "vv 114 and ngc 1614 are some of the nearest galaxies in our sample and , along with arp 299 , are the only ones for which large amounts of missing flux produce negative bowls in the co j=3 - 2 maps . because these galaxies are relatively nearby ,",
    "the sma has greater sensitivity to low surface density gas that is likely to be spatially extended than it would have in some of our more distant galaxies .",
    "figures  [ fig - vv114co32 ] and [ fig - ngc1614co32 ] show that the co - emitting regions in these galaxies are quite extended ; however , the dust continuum emission does not appear to be significantly extended in these three galaxies .",
    "the compact nature of the dust emission suggests that the sma data are not sufficiently sensitive to pick up continuum emission from dust outside the peak central concentration .",
    "in addition , the continuum data suffer slightly more from the missing flux problem than the spectral line data do (   [ missing ] and tables  [ tbl - co32 ] and  [ tbl - cont ] ) because the line emission is intrinsically more compact in an individual spectral channel .",
    "an examination of the relative strengths of the co j=3 - 2 emission and the 880 @xmath4 m emission suggests that this is a reasonable explanation .",
    "for example , if the gas - to - dust mass ratio were 150 , then , using the equations for dust and gas masses given above , we would expect the flux in the co j=3 - 2 moment map to be roughly 10@xmath74 times brighter ( in jy km s@xmath11 ) than the flux in the 880 @xmath4 m map ( in jy ) . for ngc 1614 and arp 299 ,",
    "if we compare the two maps using contours scaled by this factor of 10@xmath74 , we see a very similar extent and relative strength in the co j=3 - 2 and 880 @xmath4 m maps . for vv 114 ,",
    "the central and western peaks are similar in extent and relative strength in the co j=3 - 2 and 880 @xmath4 m maps . however , the eastern peak is fainter in 880 @xmath4 m continuum than we would expect by a factor of about two , which suggests that either the gas - to - dust ratio or some other property of the gas and dust ( such as co emissivity or temperature ) is different in this region .      the previous discussion combined with the large range in the gas - to - dust mass ratios seen in table  [ tbl - dustmass ] led us to examine the gas - to - dust ratio using a single resolution element to probe the most central region of each galaxy or galaxy component .",
    "for these calculations , we compared the h@xmath6 mass calculated from the integrated co j=3 - 2 intensity in a single beam at the peak of the emission with the peak 880 @xmath4 m continuum intensity ( table  [ tbl - dustmasspeak ] ) .",
    "note that since many of the continuum sources are not resolved , the peak continuum emission given in table  [ tbl - dustmasspeak ] has the same value as the integrated flux given in table  [ tbl - fluxes ] .",
    "the average gas - to - dust ratio including all 15 galaxies or galaxy components with continuum detections in table  [ tbl - dustmasspeak ] is @xmath5 ( rms deviation 109 ) .",
    "this value is smaller than the average value obtained from the values in table  [ tbl - dustmass ] ( i.e. , using the total mass detected with the sma data ) and agrees somewhat better with the typical milky way gas - to - dust ratio .",
    "perhaps more importantly , the dispersion about the mean value is smaller by about a factor of two when only the peak values are used , which suggests some of the dispersion seen in the integrated values can be attributed to the better mass sensitivity of the co observations ( see previous section ) .",
    "thus our new sma data suggest that the gas - to - dust mass ratio in the central kiloparsec of these luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies is very similar to the gas - to - dust ratio measured in the milky way .",
    "this result is somewhat surprising given that the dust in these nuclear regions is subject to more intense heating ( as well as perhaps processing due to shocks ) compared to typical regions in the milky way .",
    "perhaps the main zone of activity is very compact and so does not dominate the energetics of the ism in the entire central kiloparsec ; this could be tested by sub - arcsec resolution observations in a direct star formation tracer .",
    "alternatively , perhaps most of the gas and dust reside in high column density clouds or cores that help to shield much of the mass from external heating .",
    "the normal gas - to - dust ratio seen in these galaxies provides additional validation for the co - to - h@xmath6 conversion factor derived by @xcite and adopted in this analysis . in this section",
    ", we check for any systematic differences in the gas - to - dust ratio among the galaxies in our sample that may point to differences in the interstellar medium properties .",
    "our overall picture is one in which the formation and heating of dust tracks the location of molecular gas , regardless of whether that gas is distributed largely in discrete virialized clouds ( as in the galaxy ) or to a large extent in a diffuse intracloud medium ( as in ulirgs , where the co - to - h2 conversion factor is consequently lower ) .",
    "we might expect there to be some differences in our sample , which spans a factor of ten in infrared luminosity and exhibits nuclear separations from less than 1 kpc ( if multiple nuclei are seen at all ) to 20 kpc .",
    "relatively undisturbed galaxies with a larger nuclear separation are more likely to have a normal interstellar medium with a more normal co - to - h@xmath6 conversion factor , which would increase the gas mass and the gas - to - dust ratio .    among the fourteen objects in our sample",
    "are five systems in which the two progenitor galaxies can still be clearly distinguished ( arp 299 , arp 55 , vv 114 , ngc 5331 , ngc 5257/8 ) , while the remaining nine objects show a single nucleus or a pair of nuclei separated by less than 1 kpc . if we calculate the gas - to - dust ratio in the central kiloparsec for the extended and the compact galaxies separately , we find no significant difference between the two samples .",
    "if we divide the sample as a function of luminosity , we find that the average gas - to - dust ratio calculated for the lower - luminosity galaxies ( 160 - 180 depending on where we divide the sample ) is roughly three times larger than the gas - to - dust ratio for the more luminous galaxies ( 50 - 70 ) .",
    "thus , there appears to be a strong dependence of the central gas - to - dust ratio on infrared luminosity in our sample , but not on nuclear separation .",
    "these nominally discrepant ratios are in fact compatible with a reasonably uniform gas - to - dust ratio of @xmath75 once plausible corrections are made .",
    "we consider here simply changes to the co - to - h@xmath6 conversion factor , how the dust temperature is derived ( optically thick versus optically thin ) , and the origin of the submillimeter luminosity .",
    "we do not consider varying the absolute value of the dust emissivity , @xmath67 , since this is relatively poorly constrained in any case . since the less luminous galaxies show on average good agreement with the milky way s gas - to - dust ratio , we focus on possible changes to our analysis that could increase the gas - to - dust ratio in the more luminous galaxies .",
    "one possibility is that the dust temperature is underestimated by our optically thin models and that in fact a higher dust temperature , such as those derived by @xcite , is more appropriate .",
    "using the optically thick dust temperatures would raise the gas - to - dust ratio in these galaxies by about a factor of two .",
    "a second possibility is that there is significant non - thermal or free - free emission contaminating the 880 @xmath4 m flux .",
    "this is difficult to quantify but would also act to raise the gas - to - dust ratio .",
    "there can be a significant contribution to the far - infrared luminosity from a buried agn and this contribution can increase with increasing @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "assuming tha tthe agn also contributes significant emission at 880 @xmath4 m , this effect has the right sense to explain the trend of the gas - to - dust ratio with @xmath76 .",
    "in contrast , adopting a larger value for the co - to - h@xmath6 conversion factor ( to bring it closer to the value in normal spiral galaxies ) would also increase the gas - to - dust ratio , but would not be consistent with previous studies of these extremely luminous galaxies .",
    "we have searched for correlations among the gas and dust properties in the galaxies in our sample .",
    "the physical and observational quantities that were considered were : far - infrared luminosity ; dust temperature ; the peak h@xmath6 surface density derived from the co j=3 - 2 emission ; co j=3 - 2 beam area ; total h@xmath6 gas mass derived from the co j=3 - 2 emission detected with the sma ; the ratio of the far - infrared luminosity to the total h@xmath6 mass ; the ratio of the far - infrared luminosity to the peak h@xmath6 mass ; the peak gas - to - dust mass ratio ; and the co j=3 - 2/2 - 1 line ratio measured from the total flux detected with the sma .",
    "this list includes both physical quantities associated with the star formation and ism properties as well as properties of the sample ( such as beam area and distance ) that may introduce selection effects .",
    "we note that the co j=3 - 2/2 - 1 line ratio could be underestimated if the sma maps resolve out a larger fraction of the flux in the higher frequency line .",
    "we also note that the peak h@xmath6 surface density may be underestimated in iras 17208 - 0014 , which has a bright unresolved core , and also somewhat underestimated in six galaxies ( mrk 231 , mrk 273 , ic 694 ( arp 299 ) , arp 55 ne , arp 193 , and ngc 2623 ) for which the co emission is resolved along the long axis but only slightly extended relative to the beam along the short axis of emission .",
    "we calculated the correlations using the method described in @xcite to correct for any distance biases in our sample .",
    "we identified eleven correlations that are statistically significant at the 95% confidence level or better ( @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the probability of a false correlation after removing the effect of distance ; table  [ tbl - corr ] ) : far - infrared luminosity and peak h@xmath6 surface density ; far - infrared luminosity and dust temperature ; dust temperature and peak h@xmath6 surface density ; beam area and peak h@xmath6 surface density ; co j=3 - 2/2 - 1 line ratio and beam area ; co j=3 - 2/2 - 1 line ratio and total h@xmath6 mass detected with the sma ; and the ratio of the far - infrared luminosity to the total h@xmath6 mass detected with the sma with each of far - infrared luminosity , dust temperature , beam area , co j=3 - 2/2 - 1 line ratio , and the ratio of the far - infrared luminosity to the peak h@xmath6 mass .",
    "however , the correlation of surface density with beam area becomes consistent with a null correlation if we use only the twelve galaxies for which the linear resolution of the beam lies between 0.5 and 1.1 kpc , e.g. , excluding ngc 5257 and arp 299 .",
    "in addition , all five of the correlations with the ratio of the far - infrared luminosity to the total h@xmath6 mass become consistent with a null correlation if we remove ngc 5257 or arp 299 from the data set .",
    "thus , we conclude that these five correlations are less robust .",
    "the remaining five correlations are all significant at the 99% confidence level except for far - infrared luminosity with dust temperature , which is significant at the 98% confidence level ; however , this correlation is well known from previous studies with larger samples @xcite .",
    "plots of these pairs of quantities are shown in figures  [ fig - correlations ] and  [ fig - bad_correlations ] .",
    "the correlations of peak h@xmath6 surface density with the far - infrared luminosity and dust temperature suggest that galaxies with higher gas surface densities are more rapidly producing hot young stars , which in turn heat the gas and dust more efficiently .",
    "this correlation is consistent with the observed systematic correlation of the hcn luminosity ( which traces dense gas mass ) with @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "the far - infrared luminosity can be used to estimate the star formation rate @xcite , although there can also be a significant contribution from a buried agn @xcite .",
    "thus , this correlation suggests that higher star formation rates and/or agn activity are associated with higher gas surface densities inside the central kiloparsec .",
    "( note that this conclusion is somewhat different from the correlation between star formation efficiencies and gas surface densities seen by @xcite and discussed in   [ sec - scov ] . )",
    "interestingly , the total h@xmath6 mass detected with the sma does not correlate with the far - infrared luminosity in our sample , although this may be partly due to the limited range of @xmath76 in our sample ( see @xcite for a discussion of this correlation in the context of a larger sample including high - redshift galaxies . )",
    "this lack of correlation suggests that it is the concentration of gas into the central regions that is important for generating the high star formation rates seen in these merging and merger - remnant galaxies , rather than the total amount of fuel available on somewhat larger scales .",
    "this result suggests that the increased star formation rate and/or agn activity inferred for the more luminous infrared galaxies is primarily a result of the increased availability of fuel for star formation in the central kiloparsec .",
    "the co j=3 - 2/2 - 1 line ratio has been used as an indicator of temperature in the molecular gas @xcite .",
    "however , for the galaxies in our sample , there is no obvious correlation between this ratio and the dust temperature derived from the 60 and 100 @xmath4 m iras data .",
    "one possible reason for this lack of correlation is that the derived dust temperatures are based on global measurements while the co j=3 - 2/2 - 1 line ratio traces material more concentrated to the center .",
    "the line ratio does correlate with both the total molecular gas mass and the beam area ( fig  [ fig - correlations ] ) .",
    "we can think of no obvious physical reason why the line ratio should correlate with the beam area , and so this may be produced by better sensitivity ( particularly important for the co 3 - 2 line ) in the lower resolution data .",
    "a similar effect could produce the correlation with total mass , although it could also be hinting at a temperature dependence in the co - to - h@xmath6 conversion factor , which would affect the derived mass .",
    "we do not detect @xmath2co j=2 - 1 emission from enough of our galaxies to make similar correlation plots involving this line .",
    "we will present an analysis of the various co line ratios , both integrated and spatially resolved , in combination with radiative transfer models in a future paper .",
    "@xcite found that the central gas surface density increased as the ratio of far - infrared luminosity to nuclear gas mass increased .",
    "the far - infrared luminosity is a good tracer of the star formation rate @xcite ; thus , if most of the far - infrared luminosity occurs in the central regions , then this ratio traces the star formation efficiency of the central , high density starburst .",
    "@xcite interpreted the observed trend as indicating that higher star formation efficiencies are produced by higher gas surface densities .",
    "however , our data do not show any evidence of a similar correlation ( figure  [ fig - sigma_l / m ] ) and so it is worth examining further the possible explanations for the disagreement between these two results .",
    "@xcite adopted a standard co - to - h@xmath6 conversion factor and so their gas surface densities can be expected to be a factor of six higher and their infrared luminosity to h@xmath6 mass ratios a factor of six lower than our values .",
    "however , this would only shift the absolute scale of their correlation and not change the correlation itself . indeed , when we estimate their relationship and correct for the different gas masses , we find that it agrees well with the location of most of the points in our analysis ( figure  [ fig - sigma_l / m ] ) .",
    "@xcite used the co j=1 - 0 transition in their study , which is more sensitive to cooler , more spatially extended emission than is the co j=3 - 2 transition used here .",
    "however , by isolating the nuclear emission from any more extended emission , @xcite may have mitigated the contribution of any extended disk gas in their study .",
    "an additional issue worth considering is the possibility of different sample selection or observational biases .",
    "our galaxy sample spans a slightly smaller range of central gas surface density ( a factor of 60 ) than does the sample in @xcite , which had a range of a factor of 100 .",
    "however , our range of surface density drops to only a factor of 10 if the galaxy with the poorest spatial resolution ( ngc 5257 ) is removed from the sample . on the other hand",
    ", some of the large range in @xcite may be due to the range of spatial resolution discussed below .",
    "the sample in @xcite has a factor of 10 larger range in @xmath76 and a factor of 5 larger range in the nuclear or peak gas mass .",
    "however , the net result is that the range of @xmath79 ( a factor of 10 ) is similar in the two studies ( although the range in our sample drops to a factor of only 4 if we remove ngc 6240 ) .",
    "@xcite calculated this ratio using only the gas mass in the central nuclear source that was also used to calculate the gas surface density , while we have used the peak h@xmath6 mass in the central beam , which would be a difference in the method if many of the sources in the @xcite sample were spatially resolved . however , most of the sources in the @xcite sample appear to have been unresolved in the original data sets , which implies that the method used to calculate the surface density and the @xmath79 ratio is very similar in this paper and in @xcite .",
    "@xcite used co j=1 - 0 data for a sample of 14 galaxies , including 5 galaxies from our sample , with resolutions ranging from 0.1 to 3.2 kpc .",
    "although their _ range _ of resolution is similar to that of the sample presented here , the _ distribution _ of resolutions is much broader than for our data set , where all but two galaxies ( arp 299 and ngc 5257/8 ) have resolutions between 0.7 and 1.1 kpc .",
    "this distribution of resolutions might introduce systematic effects into the analysis of @xcite in the sense that galaxies observed with better angular resolutions could have higher gas surface densities . indeed , the average resolution for the seven galaxies at the high end of the correlation is 0.66 kpc , while the average resolution for the remaining seven galaxies is 1.14 kpc .    to examine the effect of resolution",
    "further , we looked at the five galaxies that are common to both samples ( arp 299/ic694 , iras 17208 - 0014 , arp 55 , vv 114 , and ngc 1614 ) .",
    "the values of surface density and @xmath79 ratio are very similar for arp 299 and ngc 1614 , which are two galaxies for which the angular resolutions of the co j=1 - 0 and the co j=3 - 2 data agree within a factor of two .",
    "both iras 17208 - 0014 and vv 114 move to higher surface densities and @xmath79 ratios using the co j=3 - 2 data , which have angular resolutions a factor of 2 - 3 better than the co j=1 - 0 data .",
    "the most dramatic change is for arp 55 , for which the co j=3 - 2 data have a factor of 8 better angular resolution : its surface density and @xmath79 ratio increase dramatically , to the point where it is larger in both quantities than ngc 1614 .    in summary ,",
    "the better uniformity in angular resolution in our sample compared to that of @xcite gives us confidence that the lack of correlation seen between the peak h@xmath6 surface density and the ratio of infrared luminosity to h@xmath6 mass seen in our analysis is a real effect and not an artifact of our sample selection or observing techniques .",
    "while such a correlation may exist for galaxies with lower far - infrared luminosities ( below the luminosity cutoff of our sample ) , it can not help us in understanding the high star formation rates in the luminous systems studied here .",
    "the data presented here imply a star formation rate (   [ sec - corr ] ) , not a star formation efficiency , that increases with the central gas surface density .",
    "we will explore these interesting correlations further in a future paper .",
    "in this paper , we have presented new data obtained with the submillimeter array for a sample of fourteen luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies selected to have distances @xmath0 mpc and far - infrared luminosities @xmath1 .",
    "we have obtained data in the co j=3 - 2 , co j=2 - 1 , @xmath2co j=2 - 1 , and hco@xmath3 j=4 - 3 lines as well as continuum data at 880 @xmath4 m and 1.3 mm with spatial resolutions of order 1 kpc or better in all but one of the target galaxies .",
    "we present integrated intensity , velocity field , and velocity dispersion maps for the @xmath32co lines , integrated intensity maps for the continuum , @xmath2co , and hco@xmath3 lines , and peak and integrated spectra for all the detected lines .",
    "we have compared our co j=3 - 2 and 880 @xmath4 m continuum fluxes detected with the sma with published , archival , and new data from the james clerk maxwell telescope .",
    "this comparison shows that the interferometric data miss a significant fraction ( typically 50% ) of the co j=3 - 2 emission for eight of the galaxies in our sample and also a significant fraction ( typically 50 - 80% ) of the continuum flux for nine of the galaxies .",
    "this large amount of missing continuum flux suggests that a significant fraction of the 880 @xmath4 m emission in these systems occurs on moderately large spatial scales . the good agreement between the percentage of missing flux seen in the co j=3 - 2 line and",
    "the 880 @xmath4 m continuum suggests that the missing continuum flux comes from dust emission associated with molecular gas in the more extended disks of the galaxies .",
    "we have combined our co and continuum data to determine the gas - to - dust mass ratio in the central regions of these galaxies .",
    "we adopt the smaller value of the co - to - h@xmath6 conversion factor from @xcite and calculate the dust temperature by fitting a modified blackbody function as in @xcite . because of the lower signal - to - noise ratio in the continuum data , we find that we obtain more consistent measurements of the gas - to - dust mass ratio if we use a single beam to probe the central region of each galaxy or galaxy component .",
    "we find an average gas - to - dust mass ratio of @xmath5 ( rms deviation 109 ) , very similar to the value of 150 determined for the milky way .",
    "this similarity between the gas - to - dust ratio in these luminous systems and that in the milky way is somewhat surprising , given that the dust is subject to more intense heating from the starburst and possibly accretion activity compared to typical regions in the milky way .",
    "we have searched for correlations among nine physical and observational quantities for the galaxies in our sample .",
    "we find five correlations that appear to be statistically significant as well as robust to small changes in the exact galaxy sample .",
    "the most interesting correlation is that of peak h@xmath6 surface density with the far - infrared luminosity .",
    "since the far - infrared luminosity can be used to estimate the star formation rate , these correlations suggest that galaxies with higher gas surface densities inside the central kiloparsec have a higher star formation rate .",
    "we do not see a significant correlation of total h@xmath6 mass with the far - infrared luminosity , which suggests that the increase in star formation rate is due to the increased availability of molecular gas as fuel for star formation in the central regions , rather than the total amount of gas available on somewhat larger scales .",
    "our data do not show any evidence of a significant correlation between central gas surface density and the ratio of far - infrared luminosity to nuclear gas mass .",
    "this lack of correlation is different from the results of @xcite , who interpreted their observed correlation as indicating that higher star formation efficiencies result from higher gas surface densities .",
    "we suggest that the correlation seen by @xcite was produced by the wider distribution of spatial resolutions in their data set and is not an intrinsic property of these very luminous galaxies . to reiterate ,",
    "our new data show that it is star formation _ rate _",
    ", not star formation _ efficiency _ , that increases with the central gas surface density in luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies    there are a number of additional papers in preparation or planning that will present more detailed analysis of various aspects of the data .",
    "we will compare the results from this survey with similar observations of high - redshift submillimeter galaxies to study the gas properties of a wide range of luminous galaxies using the co j=3 - 2 line to trace the molecular gas content @xcite .",
    "a detailed analysis of the molecular gas properties of ngc 6240 has already been presented in @xcite ; we will present similar detailed analyses of the gas , dust , and star formation properties individual galaxies such as vv 114 @xcite and arp 299 .",
    "we will examine the physical properties of the molecular gas for the entire sample using spatially resolved radiative transfer models , similar to what has been done for ngc6240 @xcite , as well as carry out dynamical analysis and modeling of the galaxies , both of which can give an independent estimate of the co - to - h@xmath6 conversion factor , similar to the analysis of @xcite .",
    "this physical analysis will also allow us to place constraints on the origin of the oh megamaser activity in luminous infrared galaxies @xcite .",
