    "the cosmological constant problem has a long and checkered history ( see refs.@xcite for reviews ) .",
    "the  old \" cosmological constant problem is to understand why the vacuum energy is so small . in light of the recent type ia supernova observation @xcite ,",
    "the new cosmological constant problem is to understand why the vacuum energy is not only small , but also of the same order of magnitude as the present matter density of the universe .",
    "this is much harder than the old one ( so a lot of alternative explanations of the cosmic acceleration have appeared in the literature .",
    "see refs.@xcite for reviews ) .    allowing the cosmological constant to be dynamical to resolve the fine - tuning has been proposed rather early @xcite and the cosmological consequence of various specific models have been discussed extensively in recent years @xcite and references therein .",
    "it is worth mentioning that some authors have also argued that a dynamical cosmological constant is the requirement of the laws of quantum field theory @xcite ( see ref.@xcite for recent reviews ) .    to get a definite model of @xmath0cdm cosmology",
    ", one should specify a vacuum decay law .",
    "there are a lot of proposals of the vacuum decay law in the literature ( see ref.@xcite for a comprehensive list ) .",
    "we will review shortly five of them whose cosmological implications are mostly discussed in the literature .",
    "i. @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the hubble parameter .",
    "this was proposed by carvalho et al .",
    "@xcite based on dimensional argument ( see ref.@xcite for subsequent discussions ) . the same law can also be deduced by argument related to effective field theory and black hole thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "recently , it is argued in ref.@xcite that this type of decaying law is inconsistent with current constraint on the dark energy equation of state .",
    "while we agree with this conclusion , we do not agree with the author s argument .",
    "we will present our argument disfavoring this decaying law in sec.[evolution ] .",
    "see also ref.@xcite for related discussion .",
    "@xmath3 where @xmath4 is the scalar curvature .",
    "this was proposed by al - rawaf and taha @xcite in order to solve the entropy problem .",
    "this was proposed by arbab @xcite , which has used an argument based on the law @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the matter energy density .",
    "this was proposed by vishwakarma @xcite using dimensional argument .",
    "v. @xmath9 .",
    "this was proposed by shapiro and sola @xcite based on renormalization group argument and its cosmological constraint is recently discussed in detail in ref.@xcite .",
    "recently , ray and mukhopadhyay @xcite showed that the laws i , iii and iv are actually dynamically equivalent . more concretely ,",
    "if we denote the dimensionless proportional constants in those three models as @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , then the three laws will give precisely the same cosmological evolution under the condition that @xmath13 note that we have assumed that besides vacuum energy , the remaining component of the universe is mainly pressureless matter .",
    "we think this equivalence actually means that we can not distinguish those three laws by cosmological observations !",
    "so in view of cosmology , there is actually no need to discuss them separately and if one of them is excluded by observation , all the remaining one are also excluded .",
    "this observation motivates us to explore in a more general ground the equivalence between different vacuum decaying laws .",
    "complementarily , we also want to ask the question : whether there are some general features in decaying vacuum cosmology that are independent of the decaying law ? if this is true , we can faithfully talk about constraining the vacuum decaying rate even if we still do not understand the physics underlying the law .    in the usual way of studying @xmath0cdm ,",
    "one need first specify a vacuum decay law , then the evolution of cdm and the vacuum energy can be solved . in this paper",
    ", we will take a different approach .",
    "the starting point of this work is an assumption about the form of the modification of the cdm expansion rate due to the vacuum decay ( see eq.([6 ] ) below ) .",
    "we think this is a rather physical approach since in cosmological observations , the vacuum decay rate actually can not be directly observed and it is the modified cdm expansion rate that we can directly observe ( if it indeed exists ) . in other words , we can prove or disprove a particular vacuum decay law by cosmological observation only through its effects on the cdm expansion rate .",
    "we will try to probe what features of the vacuum decay law can be deduced from this simple assumption and how can we constrain them . in this approach",
    ", we can also probe the question of whether we can discriminate between various vacuum decay laws by cosmological observations .",
    "roughly speaking , what we want to do can be said as a  model - independent \" study of decaying vacuum cosmology .",
    "we will be mainly interested in the late cosmological evolution , so we will consider only the case of the vacuum energy decaying to cold dark matter ( cdm ) . from the equation @xmath14 , we can find that the standard continuity equation for cdm will be modified by a term that is proportional to the vacuum energy decay rate , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the energy density of vacuum .",
    "note that although the vacuum is decaying , the physical equation of state ( eos ) of the vacuum @xmath17 is still equal to constant @xmath18 , which follows from the definition of the cosmological constant .",
    "since vacuum energy is constantly decaying into cdm , cdm will dilute in a smaller rate compared with the standard relation @xmath19 .",
    "thus we assume that the energy density of the cdm will dilute in a rate whose deviation from the standard case can be characterized by a positive small _ constant _ @xmath20 , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the present value of @xmath8 .",
    "this is the main assumption of this paper , which we think is rather natural .",
    "actually , this assumption is valid in all the existing models of @xmath0cdm .",
    "an immediate simple observation is that we must have @xmath23 .",
    "otherwise the universe will expand accelerated in the matter dominated era , which is excluded by the observation of sne ia that our universe expanded decelerated before redshift @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "actually , we should expect @xmath25 since so far there has been no report from observation about an anomalous cdm expansion rate .    rewriting the continuity equation ( [ 5 ] ) in the form",
    "@xmath26 then substituting the ansatz ( [ 6 ] ) into eq.([con2 ] ) , we can find that @xmath27 is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is an integration constant representing the ground state value of the vacuum .",
    "note that the present value of the vacuum energy density is @xmath30 .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the decaying part of the vacuum energy , i.e. the second term in eq.([6.1 ] ) , dilutes at exactly the same rate as that of cdm .",
    "actually , it is easy to see from eq.([con2 ] ) that the vacuum always dilutes in the same rate as the dominate fluid of the universe if the fluid dilutes in a power law form .",
    "so the vacuum decay rate always exhibits a  tracking behavior \" .",
    "as will be discussed in more detail below , it is just this tracking behavior that makes a @xmath0cdm model with zero vacuum ground state unrealistic model of our universe .",
    "based on the prediction of inflation @xcite and the recent data from wmap @xcite , we will assume spatial flatness in this paper .",
    "thus the friedamnn equation of @xmath0cdm reads , @xmath31 where @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the present critical energy density .",
    "note that by the assumption of spatial flatness , we have @xmath35 . from the friedmann equation ( [ 7 ] ) , the universe will expand exponentially when the term @xmath29 dominates .",
    "when the first term dominates , i.e. matter domination , the scale factor evolves like , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "thus the universe will expand slower during matter domination than standard @xmath38cdm and thus the universe becomes older in @xmath0cdm .",
    "the deceleration equation follows from eqs.([7 ] ) and ( [ 5 ] ) , @xmath39    [ width=0.8]turnpt.eps    from this we can find the parameter @xmath40 which is defined to be the zero point of the deceleration parameter @xmath41 . from eq.([dece ] ) , it is given by , @xmath42^{{1\\over3-\\epsilon}}-1\\ .\\label{turnpt}\\ ] ]    fig.1 shows the dependence of @xmath40 on @xmath20 . from it",
    "we can see that @xmath40 will be larger when @xmath20 is larger , i.e. the universe begins to accelerate earlier for larger @xmath20 .",
    "we can also see that when @xmath43 , @xmath40 converge to the value in the standard @xmath38cdm case .",
    "equations ( [ 6 ] ) , ( [ 6.1 ] ) , ( [ 7 ] ) and ( [ dece ] ) determine completely the evolution of a universe in which the vacuum is decaying .",
    "it is only the result of the assumption ( [ 5 ] ) and the laws of general relativity .",
    "so we can see that under the assumption ( [ 5 ] ) , the most general @xmath0cdm cosmology can be characterized by only two parameters : @xmath29 and @xmath20 . since the assumption ( [ 5 ] ) is also valid in all the existing models of @xmath0cdm , we should expect that all the existing models of @xmath0cdm can be reproduced by special choice of the parameters @xmath29 and @xmath20 .",
    "this is indeed the case .",
    "model i with proportional constant @xmath10 is just given by @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "model iii with proportional constant @xmath11 is just given by @xmath44 and @xmath46 .",
    "model iv with proportional constant @xmath12 is just given by @xmath44 and @xmath47 .",
    "thus in our framework , we easily reproduced the result of ref.@xcite that those three laws are dynamically equivalent .",
    "model ii with proportional constant @xmath48 is just given by @xmath44 and @xmath49 .",
    "thus we can see that actually the all the models i , ii , iii and iv are dynamically equivalent .",
    "specifically , in those four models , the ground state of the vacuum must be zero .",
    "model v with proportional constant @xmath50 is just given by @xmath51 and @xmath29 an arbitrary value .",
    "the freedom in choosing @xmath29 is conceivable since in this law @xmath38 appears as a derivative and so is constrained up to a constant .",
    "thus we can see that cosmology in renormalization group model is just the most general cosmology for a vacuum decaying universe .",
    "it can be seen from eqs.([6.1 ] ) and ( [ 7 ] ) that if the ground state of the vacuum is zero , i.e. @xmath44 , as in models i , ii , iii and iv , we can get a currently accelerating universe only if @xmath52 .",
    "however , this is unacceptable because this means the universe will also be accelerating in the matter dominated era from eq.([6 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , in this case , the ratio of vacuum energy density @xmath53 and the cdm energy density @xmath8 will be a constant @xmath54 .",
    "this means that the universe can never change from a matter dominated era to a vacuum dominated era .",
    "so the universe is either always accelerating or always decelerating from the onset of matter domination to today . both cases",
    "are excluded by observation .",
    "thus we conclude that those four models is unrealistic models of our universe .",
    "this conclusion agrees with that of ref.@xcite . in ref.@xcite",
    ", the author also noticed the tracking behavior of the vacuum energy , then from this he concluded that vacuum will dilute as @xmath55 and then due to the standard relation @xmath56 , this will give a vacuum eos equaling to zero that is incompatible with current constraint on dark energy eos .",
    "we do not agree with this argument .",
    "first , from eq.([6.1 ] ) , vacuum will not dilute as @xmath55 due to the interaction between vacuum and matter .",
    "second , in @xmath0cdm , the standard relation @xmath57 between energy density and eos fails for both matter and vacuum energy which is due to the modified continuity equation ( [ 5 ] ) .",
    "third , by choosing @xmath58 , the universe will expand exponentially and thus model i can fit perfectly with current constraint on dark energy .",
    "the real reason that model i is incompatible with observation is that this model can not accommodate simultaneously an accelerating universe today and a decelerating universe during matter dominated era .",
    "so in order for @xmath0cdm to give realistic cosmology , we must have @xmath29 to be non - zero and to be of the order @xmath59 .",
    "we think this means that _ in @xmath0cdm we can not evade the fine - tuning problem in ordinary @xmath38cdm cosmology . _",
    "the question of  why the vacuum energy is so small \" changes to  why the ground state value of the vacuum energy is so small \" , which we think is not easier or technically more natural than the original one .",
    "it is worth mentioning that in order to circumvent the above difficulty .",
    "a possible way is assuming that the rate of vacuum decaying into baryon and cdm is different .",
    "imagine that @xmath60 is smaller than one and @xmath61 is larger than one .",
    "then , if cdm dominates over baryon only recently , we can have a decelerating universe in the past and an accelerating universe in the present .",
    "however , we think this can not work .",
    "since this requires baryon dominates over the cdm when redshift is larger than one so the universe is actually baryon - dominated after recombination to the formation of large scale structure . as is well - known , this can not reproduce the observed large scale structure . actually ,",
    "the problem of large structure formation in baryon - dominated universe is worsen in decaying vacuum cosmology because evolution of linear perturbation will be slowed down if vacuum is decaying , see eq.([per ] ) .    finally , from eqs.([6.1 ] ) , ( [ 7 ] ) and ( [ dece ] ) , we can find that the following vacuum decaying law can also give a @xmath0cdm model with arbitary @xmath62 @xmath63 where @xmath4 is the scalar curvature of the spacetime .",
    "up to our knowledge , this form of vacuum decaying law has not been discussed in the literature .",
    "we think one of its appealing feature is that all the quantities appearing in it is covariant .",
    "now we still do not know whether this can really be predicted from a fundamental theory .",
    "but this is surely an interesting question that deserves further investigation .",
    "note that based on our above discussion , the law ( [ law ] ) can not be distinguished from the model v by cosmological observations .",
    "their difference lies only in that whether they can be derived from a fundamental theory .",
    "in this section we discuss the observational consequence of the system ( [ 5]-[dece ] ) .",
    "since they are essentially the same as the one in renormalization group model @xcite , some of its conclusions can be applied here . specifically , they performed data fitting with sne ia observation and considered constraint from bbn , they found the constraint @xmath64 .",
    "so in our discussion , we will focus our attention to the case of @xmath43 in numerical illustrations .",
    "however , due to the modified expansion rate , confronting @xmath0cdm with observation is a subtle issue : care should be paid to understand what are the real parameters in @xmath0cdm that is constrained in various cosmological observations . for example , we _ can not _ compare the vacuum energy density ( [ 6.1 ] ) or the physical eos @xmath65 directly to current constraints on the dark energy density @xcite and eos @xcite . recall that in constraining dark energy eos , we take the standard relation @xmath19 for cdm and assume _ a prior _ an ansatz for the dark energy eos @xcite or energy density @xcite",
    ", then we constrain the parameter(s ) in the ansatz using data from sne ia , cmb and lss observation .",
    "so the constraint on dark energy eos in the literature @xcite depends crucially on the assumption of standard expansion rate of the cdm .    due to the modified matter expansion rate ,",
    "it is the effective eos defined in ref.@xcite that is the real quantity in @xmath0cdm that is constrained in dark energy reconstruction works .",
    "rewrite the friedmann equation ( [ 7 ] ) in the form @xmath66 where @xmath67 is given by @xmath68 note that the term @xmath69 should be interpreted as @xmath70 , not @xmath71 , so it can take both positive and negative value .",
    "for example , in @xmath0cdm , as can be seen from eq.([7.1 ] ) , @xmath69 is positive at small redshift and negative at large redshift .",
    "the effective eos @xmath72 is defined as @xcite @xmath73 while the explicit form in @xmath0cdm can be found from eq.([7.1 ] ) , @xmath74    it is worth mentioning that this definition of effective eos is motivated by the fact that from the definition ( [ 3 ] ) , the friedmann equation ( [ 7 ] ) can be written in the form @xmath75\\right)\\ .\\label{0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is just the standard form of the friedmann equation in which case the dark energy is modelled as an ideal fluid with equation of state @xmath76 .",
    "thus @xmath76 is the real quantity in @xmath0cdm that is constrained in dark energy reconstruction works .    ) .",
    "the three lines correspond to @xmath77 from top to bottom . ]",
    "fig.2 shows the evolution of @xmath76 up to redshift 1 for @xmath78 from top to bottom .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath79 for small @xmath80 while @xmath81 and if @xmath82 , @xmath76 changes slowly with time . in current works of constraining @xmath72",
    ", the most reliable results assumed that @xmath72 is a constant @xcite ( this is conceivable since allowing eos to vary will increase the number of parameters to constrain ) .",
    "thus what is actually constrained in those works is the average value of the effective eos @xmath83 @xcite , which from eq.([eos ] ) is smaller than @xmath18 if averaged over small redshift .",
    "thus @xmath0cdm is a possible candidate of  phantom energy \" @xcite . in this picture , @xmath84 is not the result of exotic behavior of the dark energy , but the modified expansion rate of the cdm , i.e. decaying vacuum can trick us into thinking that @xmath85 @xcite ( see ref.@xcite for another interesting model of this type ) .",
    "this possibility would be more interesting when considering the fact that modelling dark energy as scalar field with @xmath85 has encountered fundamental theoretical difficulties @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in @xmath0cdm , the argument leading to  big rip \" fate of the universe in phantom cosmology @xcite no longer applies .",
    "the universe will just expand exponentially forever just as in @xmath38cdm . under the assumption of constant eos , current constraint on @xmath86 from sne ia data",
    "is @xmath87 at @xmath88 c.l . @xcite .",
    "then @xmath43 is obvious consistent with current constraint on dark energy eos .",
    "moreover , it is easy to see from fig.2 that @xmath86 will be more and more negative when the redshift gets larger .",
    "so if more high redshift sne ia data is available in the future , @xmath0cdm predicts that we will get a more negative @xmath86 .     from bottom to top .",
    "( b ) . the fractional change to the standard @xmath38cdm with @xmath89.,title=\"fig : \" ]   from bottom to top .",
    "the fractional change to the standard @xmath38cdm with @xmath89.,title=\"fig : \" ]    it is also necessary to analyze carefully various methods of constraining matter energy density parameter in @xmath0cdm ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite for a review ) . due to the modified matter expansion rate",
    ", they may actually constrain different things in @xmath0cdm .",
    "for example , if we want to constrain the evolution of @xmath90 using sne ia data , we must first specify a model for the dark energy .",
    "current popular choice is take the @xmath38cdm model , i.e. we will assume the matter expands in the standard rate and the cosmological constant is a true constant .",
    "so in sne ia observation , if we want to compare the prediction of the @xmath90 in @xmath0cdm with the one in @xmath38cdm , the correct quantity is @xmath91 .",
    "fig.3(a ) shows the evolution of @xmath92 up to redshift 2 for @xmath93 from bottom to top with @xmath94 .",
    "it is different from fig.2 in ref.@xcite since they used the definition @xmath95 .",
    "correspondingly , the deviation parameter @xmath96 in our case , defined as the fractional change of @xmath90 with respect to the standard @xmath38cdm will be different from that of ref.@xcite .",
    "this is shown in fig.3(b ) corresponding to the same @xmath20 value of ref.@xcite : @xmath89 .",
    "we can see that at redshift 1.5 , the fractional change is less than @xmath97 and at redshift 1 it is less than @xmath98 . in ref.@xcite , those two numbers are @xmath99 and @xmath100 respectively , which is much larger than ours .",
    "so we conclude that for @xmath89 , it will be very hard to distinguish it from @xmath38cdm by the evolution of @xmath90 using sne ia data in the near future .    on the other hand , the physical matter energy density @xmath8 given by eq.([5 ] )",
    "is constrained in more direct methods such as galaxy dynamics or gravitational lensing .",
    "however , since vacuum is constantly decaying to matter , care should be paid to analyze in those direct methods what is the redshift that the matter density is constrained . in this work , since our main interest is constraining the vacuum decay rate @xmath20 , in the following discussion we will simply take @xmath94 .",
    "constraint on the dark energy eos can be considerably tightened if we combine data from sne ia , cmb and lss observations .",
    "for example , in ref.@xcite , yun wang _ et al .",
    "_ showed that when combining data from sne ia , cmb and lss , we have @xmath101 at @xmath88 c.l , which is much tighter than the bound we quoted above using only the sne ia data .",
    "however , in @xmath0cdm , it is problematic to apply constraints on @xmath86 from cmb or lss data .",
    "the reason it that , from eq.([eos ] ) , we can see that the effective eos will tend to negative infinity at redshift @xmath102 defined by @xmath103 for example , for @xmath104 , we have @xmath105 , respectively .",
    "this pathological behavior of @xmath76 is not a sign that some unphysical thing happens at @xmath102 .",
    "it is just due to the implicit assumption underlying the definition ( [ 3 ] ) : the modification term to the standard matter dominated friedmann equation @xmath69 must be always non - zero .",
    "this means that the expansion rate of the universe should be always larger than the standard matter dominated case even at high redshift .",
    "if this assumption fails , i.e. @xmath106 as the redshift approaches a finite value @xmath102 , then @xmath72 will tend to infinity at @xmath102 . in @xmath0cdm ,",
    "this divergence in @xmath76 is the direct result of the decreased matter expansion rate . due to this pathological behavior ,",
    "if we consider cmb and lss data , i.e. we are considering @xmath86 averaged up to the redshift of recombination , it is suspicious that this makes sense .",
    "however , based on the same reasoning of effective eos formalism , we can construct the effective energy density of dark energy and in this formalism we will not encounter the problems in the effective eos formalism .",
    "so we can compare the effective energy density to the recent reconstructed dark energy density using sne ia , cmb and lss data @xcite .    ) .",
    "the three lines correspond to @xmath77 from top to bottom . ]",
    "so let s write the friedmann equation ( [ 7 ] ) into the form @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the effective energy density of the dark energy which is given by @xmath109    fig.4 shows the evolution of @xmath108 up to redshift 1.2 .",
    "this can be compared to fig.3(a ) of ref.@xcite , which is the most up - to - date constraint on dark energy density using data from sne ia , cmb and lss observations .",
    "we can see that all three curves in fig.4 is consistent with current observational constraint at @xmath110 level .",
    "to confront @xmath0cdm with the matter power spectrum of lss , it is necessary to consider the evolution of linear perturbations .",
    "it is possible that this will give a tighter constraint on the vacuum decay rate .",
    "following from the property that vacuum do not fluctuate , we can see that the density perturbation @xmath111 will satisfy the standard continuity equation , @xmath112     from bottom to top . ]    then following the standard treatment ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite ) , we can find that the density contrast @xmath113 satisfies , @xmath114 this is just the same form as that in @xmath38cdm . in matter",
    "dominated era of @xmath38cdm , it is well - known that the density contrast evolves as @xmath115 @xcite . in @xmath0cdm , during matter dominated era , it can be found that @xmath116 which will be slower than the standard case when @xmath117 .",
    "thus it will be harder for large scale structure to form in @xmath0cdm .",
    "fig.5 shows the evolution of the linear growth factor @xmath118 for @xmath119 from bottom to top with @xmath94 .",
    "the topmost curve corresponds to the evolution in standard @xmath38cdm model .",
    "several features are quite obvious from this figure .",
    "first , in matter dominated era , the perturbation will evolve slower when @xmath20 is larger .",
    "second , in vacuum dominated era , they evolve in almost the same rate since the universe expands exponentially in all those cases .",
    "so under the same initial condition , the growth factor will be smaller when @xmath20 is larger .",
    "to say it in other words , for the same @xmath120 , @xmath0cdm with larger @xmath20 demand larger density fluctuations at early times .",
    "this effect should lead to a difference between cmb normalization and low - redshift normalization .",
    "for example , we can see that for the case of @xmath121 , the fractional change with the @xmath38cdm case is about @xmath122 .",
    "such a non - negligible fractional change can be distinguished from precise lss data .",
    "compared to the upper bound from sne ia observation , @xmath64 @xcite , we can see that the evolution of linear growth factor can give tighter constraint on the vacuum decay rate .",
    "finally , all the four evolution curves begin to slow down at roughly the same redshift .",
    "this is due to the observation in in sec.[evolution ] that , for @xmath43 , the universe begins to accelerate at roughly the same redshift .",
    "in sum , we discussed the cosmological evolution of decaying vacuum cosmology based on a simple assumption about the modified matter expansion rate .",
    "we showed that all the existing models of decaying vacuum cosmology can be elegantly unified in this framework .",
    "so even if we do not understand the physics of vacuum decay , we can still faithfully talk about whether vacuum is decaying by constraining the vacuum decay rate using the system ( [ 5]-[dece ] ) .",
    "based on this approach , we also proposed a new vacuum decay law .",
    "we emphasized that due to the modified matter expansion rate , it should be careful to make predictions of cosmological parameters in @xmath0cdm .",
    "specifically , we discussed the effective eos and density parameter . from the effective eos , we indicated that @xmath0cdm is a possible candidate for phantom energy .",
    "however , there is a possible trouble in the effective eos formalism so we constructed the effective energy density , from which we showed that @xmath43 is consistent with current data from sne ia , cmb and lss observations .",
    "finally , we discussed the evolution of linear perturbations in @xmath0cdm and showed that it can give tighter constraint than just the cosmological evolution .",

    "<S> we take a phenomenological approach to study the cosmological evolution of decaying vacuum cosmology ( @xmath0cdm ) based on a simple assumption about the form of the modified matter expansion rate . in this framework , almost all the current vacuum decaying models can be unified in a simple manner . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the idea of letting vacuum decay to resolve the fine - tuning problem is inconsistent with cosmological observations . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss some issues in confronting @xmath0cdm with observation . using the effective equation of state formalism , </S>",
    "<S> we indicate that @xmath0cdm is a possible candidate for phantom cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , confronted with a possible trouble of effective equation of state formalism , we construct the effective dark energy density . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss the evolution of linear perturbation . </S>"
