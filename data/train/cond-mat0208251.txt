    "the study of metallic multilayers has been a very active area of research in recent years .",
    "of particular interest are alternating layers of ferromagnetic and paramagnetic metals called magnetic multilayers .",
    "a relatively small magnetic field aligns the magnetic moments in the different ferromagnetic layers , leading to a large magnetoresistance , which is called the giant magnetoresistance ( gmr ) .",
    "@xcite the gmr has technological applications in magnetic read heads , magnetic sensors , and magnetic memory devices .",
    "consequently , it has been studied extensively , including such effects as bulk and interface scattering , magnetic and non - magnetic scattering , fermi wave vector mismatch and magnetic coupling between the layers .",
    "@xcite    one aspect of metallic multilayers which has been less studied theoretically is the effect of long length scale fluctuations of the layer thicknesses and heights . in an ideal multilayer",
    "the interfaces between the layers are perfect planes .",
    "the thickness of each layer and the height of each layer above the substrate would be constant . obviously , this is not the case in any real system .",
    "in addition to interdiffusion and other atomic scale disorder at the interfaces , the actual thicknesses and/or heights of the layers can vary on a length scale which is large on the atomic scale .",
    "indeed , these long length scale fluctuations seem to be the rule rather than the exception",
    ".    since the fermi wave vectors for these metals are of order the atomic spacing , interdiffusion and atomic scale disorder are strong sources of scattering .",
    "fluctuations on a length scale of 10 or more atomic spacings should not appreciably effect the surface scattering .",
    "nonetheless , long length scale disorder can be important .",
    "it has been demonstrated both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite that nonplanar interfaces can create new kinds of magnetic coupling between the layers .",
    "this tends to reduce the gmr because the fraction of a sample that is antiferromagnetically aligned at zero applied field is reduced .",
    "consequently , many of the experiments that study the role of interfacial roughness rescale the magnetoresistance by the fraction of the sample which is antiferromagnetically coupled .",
    "this fraction can be determined experimentally from magnetization measurements .",
    "there are two common geometries used in studying the giant magnetoresistance .",
    "the current flows parallel to the layers in the current - in - plane ( cip ) geometry and normal to the layers in the current - perpendicular - to - plane ( cpp ) geometry .",
    "the cip geometry has been more widely studied than the cpp geometry because measurements in the cip configuration are easier to achieve experimentally .",
    "simultaneous measurements of the cip magnetoresistance and roughness using low angle x - ray scattering have been made on samples with roughness that has been systematically varied by changing growth parameters and annealing .",
    "one set of experiments on fe / cr multilayers finds that the change in the resistivity between low and high field , @xmath0 , rescaled by the antiferromagnetic fraction , @xmath1 , increases with roughness.@xcite schad _ et al_.  also simultaneously measured the surface roughness and the magnetoresistance of fe / cr multilayers.@xcite in one set of experiments they find that @xmath2 decreases with the increasing fluctuations in the layer heights while the saturation resistivity decreases.@xcite in another set of experiments on fe / cr multilayers which are dominated by surface scattering they find that the cip magnetoresistance increases with interface fluctuations , which were determined by the ratio of the vertical roughness amplitude to the lateral correlation length.@xcite    the effect of long length scale roughness on the cip magnetoresistance has been studied theoretically by barnas and bruynseraede @xcite and by levy _",
    "et al_.  @xcite barnas and bruynseraede studied the scattering between quantum states in different layers allowing for uncorrelated variations in the layer thicknesses .",
    "they find that the magnetoresistance can either increase of decrease with roughness depending on the parameters in the problem .",
    "indeed there are even cases where the magnetoresistance decreases and then increases with roughness .",
    "et al_.  studied the magnetoresistance of multilayers deposited on grooved substrates , @xcite which produce roughness which is correlated between the layers . using a general linear response approach they find that the roughness mixes the cip and cpp geometries , leading to what is called the cap or current - at - an - angle - to - plane configuration .",
    "since the cip magnetoresistance is typically smaller than the cpp magnetoresistance , this would tend to increase the magnetoresistance with roughness .",
    "the difficulty in making cpp measurements is due to the large surface area relative to the thickness of the samples .",
    "this results in a cpp resistance which is too small to measure using conventional techniques and also makes the measurements susceptible to inhomogeneous current paths .",
    "these difficulties have been overcome by making small area pillar samples , @xcite by using superconducting leads , @xcite and by combinations of these two techniques .",
    "@xcite experiments on co / ag multilayers find that the cpp magnetoresistance decreases with interface disorder while the cip magnetoresistance increases .",
    "@xcite cyrille _",
    "et al_.  measured the cpp magnetoresistance of fe / cr multilayers and quantified the roughness in their samples using both low angle x - ray scattering and transmission electron micrographs of cross - sectional samples .   @xcite they find that @xmath2 increases with roughness proportionally to the rms deviation in the layer heights .",
    "still more recent experiments by zambano _",
    "et al_.  see no change in the cpp magnetoresistance of fe / cr multilayers with increasing roughness.@xcite    the effect of long length scale interface fluctuations is therefore unclear , with some work pointing to an increase in the magnetoresistance , some a decrease , and some no change at all .",
    "some of the differences between the experiments is due to changing a growth parameter like the sputtering pressure probably changes more than just the interfacial roughness .",
    "a theoretical calculation can vary just the interface fluctuations and hence hope to isolate the effect of long length scale interface fluctuations on the magnetoresistance .",
    "while the earlier theoretical work is consistent with the cip magnetoresistance experiments , the cpp magnetoresistance experiments remain unexplained . in particular the extensive work of cyrille _",
    "et al_.  @xcite which shows an increase in the magnetoresistance with interface roughness is not possible to explain as a mixing of the cpp and cip geometries since the cip magnetoresistance is usually lower than the cpp one , as is the case in their measurements .    in this paper",
    "we examine the effects of long length scale fluctuations in the layer thicknesses and heights using the boltzmann equation . a semiclassical approach like",
    "the boltzmann equation is a good choice for this problem because the length scales involved are large compared to the atomic spacing .",
    "various versions of the boltzmann equation have also been used extensively in modeling the gmr .",
    "@xcite the boltzmann equation we use here has a simple , but current conserving form for the scattering term , and we can solve it essentially exactly numerically in the limits of long and short mean free paths . here , a long mean free path is much larger than the layer thicknesses , and a short mean free path is much smaller than the layer thicknesses .",
    "we consider both the cpp and cip geometries and find that the gmr can either increase or decrease with interface roughness depending on the parameters in the problem .",
    "explicit predictions are made for when the gmr increases and when it decreases .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "ii we provide a formal solution to the boltzmann equation which is valid for arbitrary mean free paths .",
    "next , in sect .",
    "iii we apply this formal solution to reproduce the well known results for the cip and cpp geometries when the interfaces are flat . in sect .",
    "iv we consider sinusoidal interfaces , which model the long length scale interface fluctuations . both the long mean free path case ( sect.iv a ) and the short mean free path case ( sect .",
    "iv b ) are considered .",
    "these two cases are compared numerically in sect .",
    "iv c. in sect .",
    "v we use the results from sect .",
    "iv to determine the effect of long length scale interface disorder on the giant magnetoresistance in the long mean free path case ( sect .  v a ) and the short mean free path case ( sect .  v b ) . in sect .",
    "v c the changes in the cpp and cip resistivities due to increasing long length scale roughness are estimated in the long and short mean free path cases using experimentally determined parameters .",
    "all the results are summarized in the conclusion , sect .",
    "the model system we study is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : parameters ] .",
    "multilayers of thickness @xmath3 are separated by sinusoidal interfaces with amplitude @xmath4 and period @xmath5 . within each layer the relaxation time , @xmath6 , is constant . for numerical considerations ,",
    "our calculations are performed in two dimensions , namely the multilayers are strips in a two - dimensional plane ; however , we nonetheless expect the results to remain qualitatively the same when generalized to three dimensions . moreover , in both the long and short mean free path limits we will present analytic expressions for our results , which have direct generalizations to the three - dimensional case .    the boltzmann equation we use represents elastic s - wave scattering within a current - conserving right - hand side , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the distribution function , @xmath9 is the spherical average of @xmath10 in momentum space , and @xmath11 is the relaxation time . to get the linear response conductivity the distribution function",
    "is expanded to first order in the applied electric field , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the equilibrium fermi - dirac distribution function and @xmath14 is proportional to the applied electric field , @xmath15 .",
    "the linear response boltzmann equation is @xmath16    this equation may be further simplified using the fact that the temperature is far below the fermi temperature in these metals .",
    "consequently , the energy derivative of the equilibrium fermi function in eq .",
    "( [ eq : boltz2 ] ) is approximately a delta function which pins the energy to the fermi energy .",
    "one can define another distribution function on the fermi surface , @xmath17 , @xmath18 so that the boltzmann equation becomes @xmath19    this first order differential equation can be integrated to find @xmath17 and hence @xmath10 . as a first step the deviation of @xmath17 from its spherical average @xmath20 is defined as @xmath21 , @xmath22 substituting @xmath21 into eq .",
    "( [ eq : boltz4 ] ) , the boltzmann equation on the fermi surface is now @xmath23 both the gradient of the electrical potential , @xmath24 , and the gradient of @xmath20 appear on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : boltz5 ] ) .",
    "consequently , it is useful to define the electro - chemical potential , @xmath25 , @xmath26 so that there is only a single gradient on the right - hand side , @xmath27    equation ( [ eq : boltz5b ] ) can be solved by integrating along paths in phase space . letting @xmath28",
    "be a trajectory in phase space which satisfies the equation of motion , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , the distribution function along this path is @xmath31 substituting eq .",
    "( [ eq : gtilde ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : boltz5b ] ) , one obtains a first order ordinary differential equation , @xmath32 the general solution of this equation is @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 represent the initial and final coordinates in phase space , respectively .",
    "note that with these simple equations of motion for this boltzmann equation , the trajectories are lines , @xmath36 and @xmath37 when the starting point of integration is taken to infinity , @xmath38 , eq .  ( [ eq : gensol ] ) simplifies to @xmath39 equation ( [ eq : gensol2 ] ) is the starting point for the calculations in this paper .",
    "solving it is not always straightforward because the electro - chemical potential is not known a priori . in some cases one can deduce @xmath25 from general principles . in other cases",
    "( [ eq : gensol2 ] ) must be solved self - consistently as described below .",
    "once one has a solution to @xmath40 , the current density , @xmath41 , can be obtained directly from @xmath42 because @xmath43 has no angular dependence . in this equation",
    "the density of states at the fermi surface is @xmath44 .",
    "for the nonuniform samples considered in this paper , the current density and the electric field will vary with position .",
    "an effective conductivity , @xmath45 , for the entire sample is defined using the spatial average of the current density , @xmath46 , and the electric field , @xmath47 , @xmath48 this is the conductivity one would obtain by measuring the net current and voltage drop for a large sample and multiplying by the usual factors of length and cross - sectional area . in eq.([eq : conductivity ] ) the conductivity is defined in terms of the electric field instead of the gradient of the electro - chemical potential . however , because of the periodicity in the multilayers , @xmath20 is periodic .",
    "thus @xmath49 because the spatial average of the derivative of a periodic function is zero .",
    "consequently , from eq.([eq : v ] ) the average electric field , @xmath47 , is the same as the average gradient in the electro - chemical potential , @xmath50 .",
    "in this section we apply the formalism developed in the previous section to solve the case of flat interfaces ( @xmath51 in fig.[fig : parameters ] ) .",
    "this will provide the basis for the calculations with wavy interfaces in the next section , since in this case we are able to solve the boltzmann equation exactly for arbitrary mean free paths .",
    "it will also allow us to demonstrate that this formalism reproduces the conventional results in the limit of weak spin - flip scattering .      in the current - perpendicular - to - plane ( cpp ) geometry the current flows in the @xmath52-direction of figure [ fig : parameters ] .",
    "current conservation and translational symmetry in the @xmath53-direction imply that the current density is uniform throughout the sample .",
    "translational symmetry also implies that the electro - chemical potential , @xmath25 , only depends on the @xmath52 variable .",
    "the actual functional form of @xmath54 , however , is not known a priori .    in order to determine @xmath54 or equivalently @xmath55 , the condition that the spherical average of @xmath21 is zero ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltag ] ) ) was used in conjunction with eq.([eq : gensol2 ] ) .",
    "this leads to an integral equation for @xmath55 .",
    "because of the periodicity of the multilayers and hence @xmath56 , the infinite integral can be converted to a finite integral .",
    "discretizing @xmath56 then leads to a linear equation , which is easily solved numerically .",
    "the results of this numerical calculation show that for all mean free paths the derivative of the electro - chemical potential in the @xmath57 layer is proportional to the inverse of @xmath6 . substituting this result into eq .",
    "( [ eq : gensol2 ] ) , it follows that the distribution function is independent of position and proportional to @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the direction of the momentum .",
    "the current is uniform as expected .",
    "current uniformity and the fact that @xmath56 within a layer is proportional to @xmath60 imply that the resistance is the same as one would obtain by adding classical resistors in series . the series resistor model for the cpp geometry",
    "is commonly used to analyze experiments in the limit of weak spin - flip scattering .",
    "@xcite      in the current - in - plane ( cip ) geometry the current flows in the @xmath53-direction of figure [ fig : parameters ] . in this case",
    "the electric field must be constant because of the symmetry of the problem and @xmath61 .",
    "furthermore , if we make the ansatz that @xmath62 , then eq .  ( [ eq : gensol2 ] ) can be integrated analytically . the spherical average of the resulting distribution function , @xmath21 , is indeed zero , which is consistent with the ansatz that @xmath62 .",
    "thus , in this case we also have a complete analytic solution for the distribution function .",
    "figure [ fig : cipcurrent ] shows the cip current density in a two - layer repeat unit multilayer with @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "each curve corresponds to different mean free paths , ranging from much less than to much greater than @xmath3 . for comparison ,",
    "the curves are normalized by the maximum of @xmath65 . as the figure illustrates , when the mean free paths are much less than @xmath3 , @xmath65 changes rapidly at the interface .",
    "moreover , in this limit the ratio of the current density in layer 2 to that in layer 1 equals the ratio of the corresponding mean free paths , which is what one would expect for classical macroscopic resistors in parallel . as the mean",
    "free paths increase , the current density smooths out , becoming roughly uniform across the repeat unit as the mean free paths become much greater than the layer thicknesses .      in",
    "the long mean free path limit the current density and the distribution functions in both geometries are independent of position . as seen in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gensol2 ] ) , there is an average over a mean free path which goes into computing the distribution function . if the mean free path is large enough , then the average effectively smears out the variations in the sample , producing a homogeneous current and distribution function .    in the short mean free path limit",
    "the current density is the same as one would obtain classically from adding resistors in series ( cpp geometry ) or in parallel ( cip geometry ) . in this case",
    "the integral used to calculate the distribution function , eq.([eq : gensol2 ] ) , is short ranged and in particular much smaller than the layer thicknesses .",
    "each layer behaves like a macroscopic piece of metal .",
    "for the case of the wavy interfaces shown in fig.[fig : parameters ] it is not possible to obtain simple analytical expressions for the distribution function like the ones for the flat interface cases of the previous section .",
    "moreover , direct numerical solution of the boltzmann equation requires the solution of a three - dimensional problem ( two space coordinates and one angular variable along the fermi surface ) .",
    "however , we saw in the previous section that there are two natural limiting cases : ( i ) the long mean free path case , where the current density and distribution function are uniform , and ( ii ) the short mean free path case , where the current density and distribution function are determined by the local gradient in the electro - chemical potential . in this section",
    "we solve for the distribution function , current density , and conductivity in these two limiting cases .      in the case",
    "where the mean free path is long compared to the layer thicknesses the integral used in computing the distribution function ( eq .  [ eq : gensol2 ] ) averages the gradient in the electro - chemical potential over a large region of the sample .",
    "if the mean free path is long enough , then the gradient in the electro - chemical potential may be approximated by its average value .",
    "the distribution function then becomes @xmath66 where the angular brackets denote a spatial average . as discussed in sect .",
    "ii , the average of the gradient in the electro - chemical potential , @xmath67 , is equal to the average electric field , @xmath47 , for a periodic system .    in the previous section , where we considered flat interfaces",
    ", we did not include interface scattering in the interest of simplifying the calculation .",
    "the scattering rates changed as electrons went from one material to another , but there was no additional scattering due to the interfaces . here",
    "we include interface scattering since it is crucial for comparing to experiments .",
    "we model a simplified surface scattering as infinitesimal layers of a higher - resistivity material .",
    "surface scattering is included on the right - hand side of the boltzmann equation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : boltz ] ) in addition to the bulk scattering term , @xmath68 , @xmath69 where the integration runs along the @xmath57 interface , @xmath70 is the position of the @xmath57 boundary , and @xmath71 is a parameter characterizing the surface scattering rate .",
    "letting @xmath72 be the angle between the velocity , @xmath73 , and the unit vector normal to the boundary with the convention that @xmath74 , the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : longmfpgp ] ) from slightly below ( @xmath75 ) to slightly above ( @xmath76 ) the interface is @xmath77 physically , this means that the probability of an electron being scattered at an interface is lowest when its trajectory is perpendicular to the boundary ( @xmath78 ) and larger when it crosses the boundary at an angle .    to test the approximation of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : longmfpg ] ) and ( [ eq : longmfpgp ] ) we now evaluate the integral of eq.([eq : longmfpgp ] ) numerically .",
    "the resulting function , @xmath79 , should be independent of both angle and position .",
    "figure [ fig : gtilde ] shows @xmath80 versus @xmath81 for a multilayer composed of two - layer repeat units with @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 .",
    "the dashed and solid lines represent this sample at @xmath51 and @xmath87 , respectively .",
    "the statistical noise present in the latter curve near @xmath88 and @xmath89 corresponds to electrons whose trajectories run nearly parallel to the @xmath53 axis .",
    "although these electrons intersect significantly fewer interfaces than those that travel along the @xmath52 axis , the interfaces can nevertheless be much more effective in scattering them if they intersect a boundary nearly tangentially within a few mean free paths .",
    "therefore @xmath90 is highly sensitive to small changes in @xmath81 near @xmath88 and @xmath89 . despite the magnitude and frequency of the fluctuations in this region , the noise averages to the smooth value of @xmath90 seen in the vicinity of @xmath91 .",
    "this kind of averaging is performed to compute the current , eq .  ( [ eq : current ] ) , and the conductivity , eq .  ( [ eq : conductivity ] ) .",
    "thus , once the small angle fluctuations are averaged the function @xmath92 is independent of angle .",
    "we have also verified that it is independent of position for a given sample .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : gtilde ] it is apparent that @xmath92 decreases with increasing interface roughness ( @xmath4 ) , resulting in a decreasing conductivity in both the cip and cpp geometries .",
    "performing the same calculation except without surface scattering ( @xmath93 ) , one finds that the two values for @xmath92 are the same . in other words , with only bulk scattering in our model interface roughness",
    "does not effect the conductivity . in",
    "the long mean free path limit , it is therefore necessary to have interface scattering in order to have a change in the conductivity with roughness .    in order to examine the additional contribution to the resistance due to interface scattering , we define an interface conductivity , @xmath94 , which is extracted as follows .",
    "for a given geometry the conductivities with and without interface scattering are computed , @xmath95 and @xmath96 , respectively .",
    "treating the bulk and interface resistances as resistors in series , the interface conductivity is given by @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the number of layers in a repeat unit and @xmath3 is the thickness of a repeat unit . in the example above",
    "the number of layers is @xmath99 and the length of a repeat unit is @xmath100 . using a resistors in series model is natural in the cpp geometry ; however , it may be less clear that this is a good model for the cip geometry . here , because @xmath92 is independent of angle , the changes in the cpp and cip conductivities are equal .",
    "thus , what works in one geometry will also work in the other .    for a given set of bulk and surface scattering rates",
    "define @xmath101 as the difference between the interface conductivity for @xmath102 and @xmath103 , @xmath104 figures [ fig : percchangecpp ] ( a ) and ( b ) contain plots of @xmath105 versus @xmath106 for the cpp and cip geometries , respectively . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : longmfpg ] ) one can see that the distribution function @xmath107 in the cip case , where the average electric field is in the @xmath53-direction , is largest near @xmath108 and @xmath89 , while in the cpp case , @xmath21 is largest near @xmath109 .",
    "the larger scatter in the data of fig.[fig : percchangecpp ] for the cip case than the cpp case reflects the larger scatter in @xmath110 near @xmath108 and @xmath89 .",
    "the curves in these figures represent either various positions within a particular sample or fixed positions within samples that have different mean free paths or surface scattering rates . when plotted in this manner ,",
    "all of the data fall onto the same line . thus , not only is @xmath111 proportional to @xmath106 , but the proportionality constant is independent of the model parameters .",
    "one difference between a curved interface and a flat interface is that the curved one is longer . because of surface scattering",
    ", a curved interface will have more scattering and hence a larger resistance .",
    "the amount of extra scattering provided by a curved interface should be proportional to the additional length in the boundary .",
    "let @xmath112 be the length of the interface and @xmath113 be the change in the interface length from the flat case ( @xmath51 ) to the wavy case ( @xmath114 ) .",
    "the percent increase in the interface length , @xmath115 , is plotted as the @xmath116 s in fig.[fig : percchangecpp ] . to a good approximation",
    "it is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : percchangecpp ] that the percent decrease in the interface conductivity is equal to the percent increase in the length of the interface . for our sinusoidal boundaries",
    "the percentage change in the interface length is @xmath117 for small @xmath4 , so within our model we have @xmath118      in the short mean free path limit the integral used to compute the distribution function , eq .",

    "thus , we may approximate the electro - chemical potential as constant within the integral , and the distribution function becomes @xmath119 in this approximation , the current density and conductivity in the @xmath120-th layer are given by @xmath121 since the conductivity is constant within each layer , the current conservation condition , @xmath122 , within a given layer implies that @xmath123 , where @xmath124 is the electro - chemical potential in layer @xmath120 .",
    "the problem of finding the current density and effective conductivity due to roughness thus reduces to solving laplace s equation within each layer subject to the boundary conditions that the current is conserved and that the electro - chemical potential is continuous . as noted earlier ,",
    "the average electric field , @xmath125 , is the same as the average of the gradient in the electro - chemical potential , @xmath126 , because of the periodicity of the multilayers .",
    "whereas in the long mean free path limit we had to include interface scattering or else there would not have been any effect , in the short mean free path limit there is already an effect without surface scattering . from calculations which include both bulk and surface scattering , we have found that the presence of interface scattering does not qualitatively alter the results for the conductivity .",
    "thus , in the results presented below we do not include interface scattering .",
