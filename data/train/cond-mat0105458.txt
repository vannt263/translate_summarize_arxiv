    "a crucial prerequisite for the prediction of transport parameters of porous media is a suitable characterization of the microstructure @xcite . despite a long history of scientific study",
    "the microstructure of porous media continues to be investigated in many areas of fundamental and applied research ranging from geophysics @xcite , hydrology @xcite , petrophysics @xcite and civil engineering @xcite to the materials science of composites @xcite .",
    "my primary objective in this article is to review briefly the application of local porosity theory , introduced in @xcite , as a method that provides a scale dependent geometric characterization of porous or heterogeneous media .",
    "a functional theorem of hadwiger @xcite emphasizes the importance of four set - theoretic functionals for the geometric characterization of porous media .",
    "in contrast herewith local porosity theory has emphasized geometric observables , that are not covered by hadwigers theorem @xcite .",
    "other theories have stressed the importance of correlation functions @xcite or contact distributions @xcite for characterization purposes .",
    "recently advances in computer and imaging technology have made threedimensional microtomographic images more readily available .",
    "exact microscopic solutions are thereby becoming possible and have recently been calculated @xcite .",
    "moreover , the availability of threedimensional microstructures allows to test approximate theories and geometric models and to distinguish them quantitatively .",
    "distinguishing porous microstructures in a quantitative fashion is important for reliable predictions and it requires apt geometric observables . examples of important geometric observables are porosity and specific internal surface area @xcite .",
    "it is clear however , that porosity and specific internal surface area alone are not sufficient to distinguish the infinite variety of porous microstructures .",
    "geometrical models for porous media may be roughly subdivided into the classical capillary tube and slit models @xcite , grain models @xcite , network models @xcite , percolation models @xcite , fractal models @xcite , stochastic reconstruction models @xcite and diagenetic models @xcite .",
    "little attention is usually paid to match the geometric characteristics of a model geometry to those of the experimental sample , as witnessed by the undiminished popularity of capillary tube models .",
    "usually the matching of geometric observables is limited to the porosity alone .",
    "recently the idea of stochastic reconstruction models has found renewed interest @xcite . in stochastic reconstruction models",
    "one tries to match not only the porosity but also other geometric quantities such as specific internal surface , correlation functions , or linear and spherical contact distributions .",
    "as the number of matched quantities increases one expects that also the model approximates better the given sample .",
    "matched models for sedimentary rocks have recently been subjected to a quantitative comparison with the experimentally obtained microstructures @xcite .",
    "a two - component porous sample @xmath0 is defined as the union of two closed subsets @xmath1 and @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes the pore space ( or component 1 in a heterogeneous medium ) and @xmath4 denotes the matrix space ( or component 2 ) . for simplicity",
    "only two - component media will be considered throughout this paper , but most concepts can be generalized to media with an arbitrary finite number of components .",
    "a particular pore space configuration may be described using the characteristic ( or indicator ) function @xmath5 of a set @xmath3 .",
    "it is defined for arbitrary sets @xmath3 as @xmath6 the geometrical problems in porous media arise because in practice the pore space configuration @xmath5 is usually not known in detail . on the other hand the solution of a physical boundary value problem would require detailed knowledge of the internal boundary , and hence of @xmath5 .    while it is becoming feasible to digitize samples of several mm@xmath7 with a resolution of a few @xmath8 m this is not possible for larger samples .",
    "for this reason the true pore space @xmath3 is often replaced by a geometric model @xmath9 .",
    "one then solves the problem for the model geometry and hopes that its solution @xmath10 obeys @xmath11 in some sense .",
    "such an approach requires quantitative methods for the comparison of @xmath3 and the model @xmath9 .",
    "this in turn raises the problem of finding generally applicable quantitative geometric characterization methods that allow to evaluate the accuracy of geometric models for porous microstructues .",
    "the problem of quantitative geometric characterization arises also when one asks which geometrical characteristics of the microsctructure @xmath3 have the greatest influence on the properties of the solution @xmath12 of a given boundary value problem .",
    "some authors introduce more than one geometrical model for one and the same microstructure when calculating different physical properties ( e.g. diffusion and conduction ) .",
    "it should be clear that such models make it difficult to extract reliable physical or geometrical information .",
    "a general geometric characterization of stochastic media should provide macroscopic geometric observables that allow to distinguish media with different microstructures quantitatively .",
    "in general , a stochastic medium is defined as a probability distribution on a space of geometries or configurations .",
    "probability distributions and expectation values of geometric observables are candidates for a general geometric characterization .",
    "a general geometric characterization should fulfill four criteria to be useful in applications .",
    "these four criteria were advanced in @xcite .",
    "first , it must be well defined .",
    "this obvious requirement is sometimes violated .",
    "the so called `` pore size distributions '' measured in mercury porosimetry are not geometrical observables in the sense that they can not be determined from knowledge of the geometry alone .",
    "instead they are capillary pressure curves whose calculation involves physical quantities such as surface tension , viscosity or flooding history @xcite .",
    "second , the geometric characterization should be directly accessible in experiments .",
    "the experiments should be independent of the quantities to be predicted .",
    "thirdly , the numerical implementation should not require excessive amounts of data .",
    "this means that the amount of data should be manageable by contemporary data processing technology .",
    "finally , a useful geometric characterization should be helpful in the exact or approximate theoretical calculations .",
    "well defined geometric observables are the basis for the geometric characterization of porous media .",
    "a perennial problem in all applications is to identify those macroscopic geometric observables that are relevant for distinguishing between classes of microstructures .",
    "one is interested in those properties of the microstructure that influence the macroscopic physical behaviour . in general",
    "this depends on the details of the physical problem , but some general properties of the microstructure such as volume fraction or porosity are known to be relevant in many situations .",
    "hadwigers theorem @xcite is an example of a mathematical result that helps to identify an important class of such general geometric properties of porous media .",
    "it will be seen later , however , that there exist important geometric properties that are not members of this class .",
    "a geometric observable @xmath13 is a mapping ( functional ) that assigns to each admissible pore space @xmath3 a real number @xmath14 that can be calculated from @xmath3 without solving a physical boundary value problem .",
    "a functional whose evaluation requires the solution of a physical boundary value problem will be called a physical observable .    before discussing examples for geometric observables",
    "it is necessary to specify the admissible geometries @xmath3 .",
    "the set @xmath15 of admissible @xmath3 is defined as the set of all finite unions of compact convex sets @xcite . because @xmath15 is closed under unions and intersections it is called the convex ring .",
    "the choice of @xmath15 is convenient for applications because digitized porous media can be considered as elements from @xmath15 and because continuous observables defined for convex compact sets can be continued to all of @xmath15 .",
    "the set of all compact and convex subsets of @xmath16 is denoted as @xmath17 . for subsequent discussions the minkowski addition of two sets @xmath18",
    "is defined as @xmath19 multiplication of @xmath20 with a scalar is defined by @xmath21 for @xmath22 .",
    "examples of geometric observables are the volume of @xmath3 or the surface area of the internal @xmath23 . of a set @xmath24",
    "is defined as the difference between the closure and the interior of @xmath24 where the closure is the intersection of all closed sets containing @xmath24 and the interior is the union of all open sets contained in @xmath24 .",
    "] let @xmath25 denote the @xmath26-dimensional lebesgue volume of the compact convex set @xmath27 .",
    "the volume is hence a functional @xmath28 on @xmath17 .",
    "an example of a compact convex set is the unit ball @xmath29 centered at the origin @xmath30 whose volume is @xmath31 other functionals on @xmath17 can be constructed from the volume by virtue of the following fact . for every compact convex @xmath32 and every @xmath33 there are numbers @xmath34 depending only on @xmath27 such that @xmath35 is a polynomial in @xmath36 .",
    "this result is known as steiners formula @xcite .",
    "the numbers @xmath37 define functionals on @xmath17 similar to the volume @xmath38 .",
    "the quantities @xmath39 are called quermassintegrals @xcite . from one",
    "sees that @xmath40 and from that @xmath41 .",
    "hence @xmath42 may be viewed as half the surface area .",
    "the functional @xmath43 is related to the mean width @xmath44 defined as the mean value of the distance between a pair of parallel support planes of @xmath27 .",
    "the relation is @xmath45 which reduces to @xmath46 for @xmath47 .",
    "finally the functional @xmath48 is evaluated from by dividing with @xmath49 and taking the limit @xmath50 .",
    "it follows that @xmath51 for all @xmath52 .",
    "one extends @xmath53 to all of @xmath17 by defining @xmath54 .",
    "the geometric observable @xmath53 is called euler characteristic .",
    "the geometric observables @xmath55 have several important properties .",
    "they are euclidean invariant ( i.e. invariant under rigid motions ) , additive and monotone .",
    "let @xmath56 denote the group of translations with vector addition as group operation and let @xmath57 be the matrix group of rotations in @xmath26 dimensions @xcite .",
    "the semidirect product @xmath58 is the euclidean group of rigid motions in @xmath16 .",
    "it is defined as the set of pairs @xmath59 with @xmath60 and @xmath61 and group operation @xmath62 an observable @xmath63 is called euclidean invariant or invariant under rigid motions if @xmath64 holds for all @xmath65 and all @xmath32 . here",
    "@xmath66 denotes the rotation of @xmath27 and @xmath67 its translation .",
    "a geometric observable @xmath13 is called additive if @xmath68 holds for all @xmath69 with @xmath70 .",
    "finally a functional is called monotone if for @xmath69 with @xmath71 follows @xmath72 .",
    "the special importance of the functionals @xmath73 arises from the following theorem of hadwiger @xcite .",
    "a functional @xmath63 is euclidean invariant , additive and monotone if and only if it is a linear combination @xmath74 with nonnegative constants @xmath75 .",
    "the condition of monotonicity can be replaced with continuity at the expense of allowing also negative @xmath76 , and the theorem remains valid @xcite .",
    "if @xmath13 is continuous on @xmath17 , additive and euclidean invariant it can be additively extended to the convex ring @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the additive extension is unique and given by the inclusion - exclusion formula @xmath77 where @xmath78 denotes the family of nonempty subsets of @xmath79 and @xmath80 is the number of elements of @xmath81 . in particular , the functionals @xmath55 have a unique additive extension to the convex ring @xmath15@xcite , which is again be denoted by @xmath55 .    for a threedimensional porous sample with @xmath82 the extended functionals @xmath55 lead to two frequently used geometric observables .",
    "the first is the porosity of a porous sample @xmath83 defined as @xmath84 and the second its specific internal surface area which may be defined in view of as @xmath85 the two remaining observables @xmath86 and @xmath87 have received less attention in the porous media literature .",
    "the euler characteristic @xmath53 on @xmath15 coincides with the identically named topological invariant . for and",
    "@xmath88 one has @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the number of connectedness components of @xmath24 , and @xmath91 denotes the number of holes ( i.e. bounded connectedness components of the complement ) .      for theoretical purposes the pore space @xmath3 is frequently viewed as a random set @xcite . in practical applications the pore space",
    "is usually discretized because of measurement limitations and finite resolution .",
    "for the purpose of discussion the set @xmath92 is a rectangular parallelepiped whose sidelengths are @xmath93 and @xmath94 in units of the lattice constant @xmath95 ( resolution ) of a simple cubic lattice .",
    "the position vectors @xmath96 with integers @xmath97 are used to label the lattice points , and @xmath98 is a shorthand notation for @xmath99 .",
    "let @xmath100 denote a cubic volume element ( voxel ) centered at the lattice site @xmath98 .",
    "then the discretized sample may be represented as @xmath101 .",
    "the discretized pore space @xmath102 , defined as @xmath103 is an approximation to the true pore space @xmath3 .",
    "for simplicity it will be assumed that the discretization does not introduce errors , i.e. that @xmath104 , and that each voxel is either fully pore or fully matrix .",
    "this assumption may be relaxed to allow voxel attributes such as internal surface or other quermassintegral densities .",
    "the discretization into voxels reflects the limitations arising from the experimental resolution of the porous structure .",
    "a discretized pore space for a bounded sample belongs to the convex ring @xmath15 if the voxels are convex and compact .",
    "hence , for a simple cubic discretization the pore space belongs to the convex ring . a configuration ( or microstructure ) @xmath105 of a @xmath106-component medium may be represented in the simplest case by a sequence @xmath107 where @xmath98 runs through the lattice points and @xmath108 .",
    "this representation corresponds to the simplest discretization in which there are only two states for each voxel indicating whether it belongs to pore space or not . in general a voxel could be characterized by more states reflecting the microsctructure within the region @xmath100 . in the simplest case",
    "there is a one - to - one correspondence between @xmath3 and @xmath105 given by .",
    "geometric observables @xmath109 then correspond to functions @xmath110 .    as a convenient theoretical idealization it is frequently assumed that porous media are random realizations drawn from an underlying statistical ensemble",
    "a discretized stochastic porous medium is defined through the discrete probability density @xmath111 where @xmath112 in the simplest case .",
    "it should be emphasized that the probability density @xmath113 is mainly of theoretical interest . in practice @xmath113",
    "is usually not known .",
    "an infinitely extended medium or microstructure is called stationary or statistically homogeneous if @xmath113 is invariant under spatial translations .",

    "a stochastic medium was defined through its probability distribution @xmath113 . in practice @xmath113",
    "will be even less accessible than the microstructure @xmath114 itself .",
    "partial information about @xmath113 can be obtained by measuring or calculating expectation values of a geometric observable @xmath13 .",
    "these are defined as @xmath115 where the summations indicate a summation over all configurations .",
    "consider for example the porosity @xmath116 defined in .",
    "for a stochastic medium @xmath116 becomes a random variable .",

    "it happens frequently that one is given only a single sample , not an ensemble of samples .",
    "it is then necessary to invoke an ergodic hypothesis that allows to equate spatial averages with ensemble averages .",
    "the porosity is the first member in a hierarchy of moment functions .",
    "the @xmath120-th order moment function is defined generally as @xmath121 for @xmath122 . where @xmath123 for @xmath124 are the quermassintegral densities for the voxel at site @xmath125 .",
    "] for stationary media @xmath126 where the function @xmath127 depends only on @xmath128 variables .",
    "another frequently used expectation value is the correlation function which is related to @xmath129 . for a homogeneous medium it is defined as @xmath130 where @xmath131 is an arbitrary reference point , and @xmath132 .",
    "if the medium is isotropic then @xmath133 .",
    "note that @xmath134 is normalized such that @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "the hierarchy of moment functions @xmath137 , similar to @xmath113 , is mainly of theoretical interest . for a homogeneous medium @xmath137",

    "numerically becomes impractical as @xmath120 increases .",
    "if only @xmath138 points are required along each coordinate axis then giving @xmath137 would require @xmath139 numbers . for @xmath47",
    "this implies that already at @xmath140 it becomes economical to specify the microstructure @xmath3 directly rather than incompletely through moment or correlation functions .      an interesting geometric characteristic introduced and discussed in the field of stochastic geometry are contact distributions @xcite .",
    "certain special cases of contact distributions have appeared also in the porous media literature @xcite .",
    "let @xmath24 be a compact test set containing the origin @xmath30 .",

    "the probability density @xmath147 was discussed in @xcite as a well defined alternative to the frequently used pore size distrubution from mercury porosimetry .    for an oriented unit interval @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the unit vector one obtains the linear contact distribution . the linear contact distribution written as @xmath150",
    "is sometimes called lineal path function @xcite .",
    "it is related to the chord length distribution @xmath151 defined as the probability that an interval in the intersection of @xmath3 with a straight line containing @xmath152 has length smaller than @xmath153 @xcite .",

    "mainly the special case @xmath47 will be of interest . for @xmath47 the local porosity",
