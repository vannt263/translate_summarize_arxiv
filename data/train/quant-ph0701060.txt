    "in recent times laser cooling and trapping of atoms has become an area of active research@xcite .",
    "the measurement of the initial temperature of the cloud of atoms is crucial for characterising the properties of atom traps .",
    "the temperature of the cloud can be inferred from the velocity distribution of atoms in the cloud .",
    "a well - known technique of measuring this velocity distribution is the time of flight ( tof ) method .",
    "measurements of the tof distribution have been employed to analyse various experimental data such as those involving ions and isotopes@xcite , and also in performing mass spectroscopy of biomolecules like dna@xcite .    the theoretical treatment of the tof distribution that can be obtained using for instance , the green s function method@xcite , however , turns out to produce perfect agreement with the tof distribution obtained by using newton s equations for ballistic motion of particles accelerated by the earth s gravitational field@xcite .",
    "thus , the interpretation of the results of the various tof experiments@xcite where classical trajectories are inferred from newtonian mechanics@xcite remains debatable , especially in the domain of small atomic masses and low temperatures where quantum mechanical effects should be significant .",
    "though there exists no unique prescription for the definition of time of flight and arrival time in quantum mechanics , experimentalists measure arrival times of elementary particles , atoms and molecules using the tof methods . in spite of the difficulties to give time an observable status in quantum mechanics ,",
    "several logically consistent schemes for the treatment of the arrival time distribution have been formulated , such as those based on axiomatic appraches@xcite , opearator constructions@xcite , and trajectory models@xcite .",
    "it is thus desirable that some of the conceptually sound theoretical formulations of the quantum mechanical arrival time distribution@xcite be confronted with accurate experimental data .",
    "if such quantum mechanical approaches are employed for analysing experiments using tof measurements , it should not only enable to determine the empirical viability of various competing arrival time models@xcite , but also possibly shed new light on the conventional interpretation of the results of these experiments .",
    "in this paper we employ the probability current approach@xcite towards obtaining the quantum arrival time distribution of cold trapped atoms . the probability current approach for computation of the mean arrival time of a quantum ensemble",
    "not only provides an unambiguous definition of arrival time at the quantum mechanical level@xcite , but also adresses the issue of obtaining the proper classical limit of the time of flight of massive quantum particles @xcite .",
    "here we derive the quantum arrival time distribution for the case of initially trapped atomic clouds that are subsequently allowed to fall freely under gravity@xcite .",
    "we compute the mean time of arrival for these atoms and compare it with the mean arrival time obtained through the classical time of flight analysis@xcite that has frequently been employed for such experiments@xcite .",
    "our analysis predicts the mass and temperature range of the atomic clouds where the quantum mechanical treatment alters the arrival time distribution and the mean arrival time from that obtained through the classical analysis .",
    "we begin with a brief description of the classical analysis of tof measurements of trapped atoms .",
    "a probe laser , focussed in the form of a sheet , is placed underneath the atomic cloud .",
    "when the trapping forces are turned off , the cold atom cloud falls through the laser probe under the influence of gravity .",
    "it is then possible to detect the fluorescence from the atoms as they reach the sheet .",
    "the fluorescence is measured as a function of time and the initial temperature of the cloud is determined by fitting the experimental result to the theoretically predicted tof signal of the cloud@xcite . a detailed derivation of the tof signal recorded by the detector ( that is , the number of atoms arriving at the probe laser as a function of time ) was derived by yavin _ et al_@xcite .",
    "the cloud of atoms consisting of noninteracting particles has a maxwell - boltzmann velocity distribution given ( in one dimension ) by @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the initial temperature of the cloud , and @xmath2 is the atomic mass . using the newton s equations for ballistic motion of a particle accelerated by the earth s gravitational field ( in the vertical @xmath3-direction ) ,",
    "the velocity is obtained in terms of the time of flight as @xmath4 substituting the above expression for @xmath5 from eq.(2 ) in eq.(1 ) , one can obtain the time of flight distribution at an arbitrary distance @xmath3 , given by @xmath6 the corresponding classical mean time of flight or mean arrival time @xmath7 for the atomic cloud calculated using @xmath8 as the time of flight distribution is given by @xmath9 for simplicity , here we restrict ourselves to the case of a point - sized cloud .",
    "the three - dimensional calculation was done by yavin et al@xcite using a simple coordinate transformation and the same expression was obtained for the tof distribution .",
    "these authors@xcite have claimed perfect agreement of their results with a previous calculation@xcite where the tof distribution was derived using a sophisticated green s function technique .",
    "we call this tof distribution given by eq.([classdist ] ) as the classical time of flight distribution , and eq.([classarrtim ] ) denotes the corresponding classical mean arrival time since the classical newtonian equation is used from the outset to derive this tof distribution .",
    "our aim here is to derive an expression for the time of flight distribution for the atomic cloud through the quantum probability current without using any classical ingredients . to that end , let the initial state of each of the atoms be represented by a one dimensional gaussian wave function of the form @xmath10 centered at @xmath11 and moving with a group velocity @xmath5 .",
    "the schr@xmath12dinger time evolved wave function under the hamiltonian @xmath13 is given by @xmath14\\\\ & & \\times \\exp \\left[i(\\frac{m}{\\hbar } ) \\left\\{\\left(v- gt\\right ) \\left(z - vt/2\\right ) -\\frac{1}{6}g^2",
    "t^3 \\right\\ } \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 .    considering the free fall of the atoms under gravity , the expression for the schr@xmath12dinger probability current density @xmath16 for the time evolved state is calculated using the initial state given by eq.([wavefn1 ] ) to be @xmath17 \\label{purecurrent}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the expression for the position probability distribution is given by @xmath18 \\label{pure}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath19 .",
    "the modulus of the probability current density @xmath20 given by eq.([purecurrent ] ) provides the arrival time distribution for a pure wave packet falling under gravity .",
    "note that the quantum probability current as defined by eq.([currdens ] ) is formally ambiguous up to a total divergence term@xcite .",
    "however , @xmath20 can be uniquely defined through relativistic wave equations which impart appropriate spin - dependent corrections to it that persist even in the non - relativistic limit@xcite .",
    "the ensuing arrival time distribution defined through the probability current thus contains a spin - dependent correction for particles with spin@xcite .",
    "the atomic cloud is represented by an ensemble of particles in thermal equilibrium with a thermal distribution of initial velocities .",
    "each particle has a wave function of the form ( [ wavefn1 ] ) , with a maxwell - boltzmann distribution of initial velocities given by eq.(1 ) .",
    "thus the initial thermal state of the atomic cloud we have described is a mixed state .",
    "we obtain the corresponding position probability distribution by averaging the pure state distribution ( [ pure ] ) over a thermal distribution of initial velocities .",
    "the result is @xmath21 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 .",
    "the peak of the position probability distribution @xmath23 follows the classical trajectory and the effect of the mass and temperature dependences of the position probability occurs essentially because the spreading of the wave packet is different for different atomic mass and temperature of the cloud .",
    "= 3.5in=4.5 in    taking the modulus of the quantum probability current density as determining the quantum arrival time distribution@xcite , we obtain the arrival time probability distribution for the atomic cloud ( which is a mixed state ) by averaging the pure state distribution ( [ purecurrent ] ) over a thermal distribution of initial velocities .",
    "the result is @xmath24\\\\ & & \\times \\left[\\frac{(z+\\frac{1}{2}g t^2)(\\frac{kt}{m}+\\frac{\\hbar^2}{4 m^2   { \\sigma_0}^2})t}{{\\sigma_t}^2 } \\right ] \\label{quantdistri}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this way we generalise the probability current density approach to calculate the quantum arrival time distribution for the mixed state at finite temperature . it may be mentioned here that in the present calculation we neglect the small spin - dependent correction@xcite that may appear in the probability current density , as mentioned above , and consequently the mean arrival time that we compute for any fermionic atoms .",
    "= 3.5in=4.5 in    the corresponding quantum mean arrival time @xmath25 which is an observable quantity , is given by @xmath26 one may note that though the integral in the numerator of eq.([quantarrtim ] ) formally diverges , several techniques have been employed in the literature ensuring rapid fall off for the probability distributions asymptotically@xcite , so that convergent results are obtained for the integrated arrival time . for our present purposes",
    "it is sufficient to employ the simple strategy of taking a cut - off ( @xmath27 ) in the upper limit of the time integral@xcite with @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the width of the wave packet at time @xmath30 .",
    "thus , our computations of the mean arrival times are valid up to the @xmath31 level of spread in the wave function .",
    "if we impose now the classical limit for the quantum tof distribution given by eq.([quantdistri ] ) , then one can check that under the large mass and high temperature limits , and when @xmath32 , one can take @xmath33 .",
    "thus , @xmath34 , i.e. , the two distributions match in the limit of large mass and high temperature .",
    "the probability current method of computing the quantum arrival time distribution furnishes an effective way of approaching the classical limit of the distribution by smoothly varying the parameters such as mass and temperature of the quantum distribution@xcite .",
    "note also , that the mass dependence of arrival time distribution given by eq.([quantdistri ] ) and consequently , the observable mean arrival time given by eq.([quantarrtim ] ) , signifies the quantum mechanical violation of the gravitational weak equivalence principle@xcite .",
    "thus tof measurements@xcite offer a practical possibility for experimental demonstration of the equivalence principle violation at the quantum level@xcite .",
    "we perform a numerical study of the quantum arrival time distribution of the falling atomic cloud by varying its mass and temperature separately . we first plot @xmath8 and @xmath35 for fixed temperature of @xmath36 in fig.1 .",
    "it is seen the classical and the quantum distributions are clearly different for clouds of small atomic mass such as li and na . however , as one increases the atomic mass , one sees that @xmath8 and @xmath35 begin to overlap for heavy atoms such as rb for this value of temperature .",
    "the temperature variation of the arrival time distributions are displayed in fig . 2 where one sees that even for heavy rb atoms , the two distributions are quite distinct in the low ( nano kelvin ) temperature range .",
    "it would be interesting if our prediction in the low temperature and lower atomic mass region where the quantum time of flight distribution sharply differs from the classical tof distribution could be verified in actual experiments .",
    "= 3.0in=3.0 in    the variation with mass of the quantum and classical mean arrival times at a particular detector location for the ensemble of falling atoms is depicted in fig.3 .",
    "one can see that in the limit of large mass the mean arrival time @xmath25 asymptotically approaches the classical result .",
    "one can also investigate the variation of the mean arrival times ( @xmath25 and @xmath7 ) with varying temperature of the cloud , and obtain similar results , as expected from the temperature variation of the classical and quantum arrival time distributions plotted in fig.2 .",
    "the mass and temperature dependences of the quantum arrival time distribution and consequently the quantum mean arrival time arise essentially due to the spread of the wave packet for the atoms . a smaller value of the initial width @xmath37 for the wave packet results in its faster spread .",
    "the amount of departure of the quantum distribution from its classical counterpart is thus contingent on the magnitude of the ensemble spread ( since @xmath8 is independent of @xmath37 ) .",
    "this is clearly depicted in fig.4 where the classical ( @xmath8 ) and quantum ( @xmath35 ) tof distributions are plotted for three different values of @xmath37 at a fixed mass and temperature .",
    "= 3.5in=4.5 in",
    "to summarize , in this work we have considered the analysis of the time of flight measurements of falling cold atomic clouds .",
    "the inference of the temperature of the cloud in various experiments@xcite is usually performed through a classical analysis in which the results obtained are same as through the solution of newton s equations for ballistic motion of particles falling under gravity@xcite . here",
    "we emphasize the relevance of employing a quantum mechanical arrival time distribution for the analysis of such experiments .",
    "we use the probability current density approach towards obtaining the arrival time or the tof distribution .",
    "our definition of the quantum arrival time distribution and the observable mean arrival time in terms of the modulus of the probability current density is particularly motivated from the equation of continuity , and other physical considerations discussed in the literature@xcite .",
    "further , we generalise the probability current density approach to calculate the quantum arrival time distribution for a mixed state describing the maxwell - boltzmann distribution of velocities for the falling atomic clouds in the relevant experiments@xcite .",
    "we compute the tof distribution and mean arrival time through this scheme and compare our results with those obtained through a classical analysis@xcite for various atomic masses .    the obtained quantum arrival time distribution matches with the classical tof distribution in the high temperature and the large mass limits , hence furnishing another example of the smooth emergence of the classical limit@xcite of the quantum arrival time in the framework of the probability current approach",
    "however , a clear distinction between the quantum and the classical distributions is exhibited for either small atomic mass , or low temperature of the cloud .",
    "this results from differential wave packet spreading depending upon the mass , velocity and width of the wave packet for the atoms .",
    "our scheme thus provides a new method for experimental verification of the probability current density approach for calculating the arrival time distribution , in addition to an earlier proposed method using the spin rotator as a quantum clock@xcite .",
    "finally , we wish to emphasize that more investigations of modern experiments employing time of flight techniques should be performed using various quantum mechanical schemes@xcite .",
    "such studies have the potential to empirically resolve ambiguities inherent in the theoretical formulations of the quantum arrival time distribution using cold trapped atom experimental techniques , and may also shed new light on the inference of the experimental data .",
