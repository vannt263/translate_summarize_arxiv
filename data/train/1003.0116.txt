    "recent technological advances in optics @xcite , mechanics @xcite , and superconducting microwave circuits @xcite have made observations of various quantum phenomena in microscopic systems possible .",
    "such advances also suggest that quantum effects will play a major role in future communication , sensing , and computing technology .",
    "each physical system has its own advantages and disadvantages for different applications , so it is desirable to transfer classical or quantum information to different systems for different purposes . at the quantum level ,",
    "accurate information transfer requires coherent coupling among the systems . while opto - mechanical and electro - mechanical coupling have attracted a lot of attention recently @xcite , the coherent coupling between optical and microwave fields has been largely overlooked in the context of quantum information processing , even though electro - optic modulation is a well known phenomenon in classical optics @xcite .",
    "previous studies on the quantum aspects of the electro - optic effect mainly treat the microwave as a classical signal for linear quantum optical processing @xcite , but treating both fields quantum - mechanically should give rise to novel physics .    in this paper ,",
    "i consider both the optical field and the microwave field as quantum degrees of freedom and study the coupling between the fields via the electro - optic effect .",
    "both fields are assumed to be modes in a cavity or a resonator , since it is likely that both of them need to be resonantly enhanced for quantum effects to be observable . in terms of prior work ,",
    "ilchenko _ et al .",
    "_  have previously outlined such a theory in their study of photonic microwave receivers @xcite , while matsko _",
    "_  have studied the quantum back - action noise in electro - optic modulation @xcite . as noted by matsko _",
    "_ , the electro - optic coupling has the same form as the opto - mechanical coupling via radiation pressure , so all previously considered opto - mechanical effect can in principle be observed in electro - optic systems as well . in particular ,",
    "i point out the possibilities of laser cooling of the microwave mode , entanglement between the optical mode and the microwave mode via electro - optic parametric amplification , and back - action - evading optical measurements of a microwave quadrature .",
    "all these effects require optical sideband pumping , which is not considered in refs .",
    "@xcite and is the main technical novelty of this paper compared with the prior work on quantum electro - optics .",
    "if realized , the proposed effects should be useful for both fundamental science and information processing applications in the quantum regime .",
    "for example , electro - optic cooling allows one to observe quantum optical effects at higher background temperatures or lower microwave or even radio frequencies , while coherent optical detection of microwave quadratures potentially allows one to leverage the high efficiency of optical detectors compared with conventional microwave detectors , the highest reported quantum efficiency of which is only 27% @xcite , for continuous low - noise microwave measurements .",
    "a full quantum treatment of the electro - optic effect can be done using standard quantum optics theory @xcite , but here i shall use a more phenomenological treatment to emphasize the similarity between electro - optics and opto - mechanics . consider the cavity electro - optic system depicted in fig .  [ oe_setup ] .",
    "the transverse electro - optic modulator , which consists of a second - order nonlinear optical medium , such as lithium niobate or an electro - optic polymer , introduces a voltage - dependent phase shift to the intra - cavity optical field resonant at frequency @xmath0 . for simplicity ,",
    "i first consider one optical mode .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the interaction hamiltonian is @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the optical annihilation and creation operators , respectively , which obey the commutation relation @xmath4 = 1 $ ] , @xmath5 is the optical round - trip time , and @xmath6 is the single - round - trip phase shift .",
    "this hamiltonian is exactly the same as the one for opto - mechanics , in which case @xmath6 is the phase shift introduced by the cavity mirror displacement @xcite . the round - trip electro - optic phase shift , on the other hand ,",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the optical refractive index inside the electro - optic medium , @xmath9 is the electro - optic coefficient in units of m@xmath10v , @xmath11 is the length of the medium along the optical axis , @xmath12 is the thickness , and @xmath13 is the voltage across the medium . if the modulator is modeled as a capacitor in a single - mode microwave resonator , one can quantize the voltage by defining @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the microwave annihilation and creation operators , respectively , which obey @xmath17=1 $ ] , @xmath18 is the microwave resonant frequency , and @xmath19 is the capacitance of the microwave resonator .",
    "the full hamiltonian becomes @xmath20 the fact that the hamiltonian for electro - optics has the same form as that for opto - mechanics allows one to apply known results for the latter to the former .",
    "@xmath13 then plays the role of the mechanical position and @xmath21 , the current in the microwave resonator , plays the role of the mechanical momentum . for the whispering - gallery - mode electro - optic modulator reported by ilchenko _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , the microwave frequency @xmath18 is close to the optical free spectral range @xmath22 , so one should include multiple optical modes in the analysis @xcite .",
    "dobrindt and kippenberg also performed a similar multi - mode analysis for opto - mechanics @xcite .",
    "one can limit the analysis to three optical modes if @xmath23 is much larger than the optical linewidth @xmath24 , so that higher - order optical harmonics are not resonantly coupled , or if one introduces two or three non - degenerate optical modes via normal - mode splitting using two or three coupled optical cavities , so that higher - order modes are farther away in frequency @xcite . to demonstrate cooling or parametric amplification alone ,",
    "only two modes are needed .",
    "one can also detune the high - order modes by introducing an appropriate frequency dispersion to the cavity .",
    "this may be done by engineering the geometry of the cavity or using a photonic crystal structure .",
    "let @xmath2 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 be the annihilation operators for the center optical mode , red - detuned mode , and the blue - detuned mode , respectively .",
    "the hamiltonian becomes @xcite @xmath27 assuming that the coupling coefficients for different optical modes are the same for simplicity and @xmath28 is slightly modified to account for the partial overlap among the modes . in the following ,",
    "i shall focus on the experimentally more relevant case of multiple optical modes .",
    "to describe cooling and parametric amplification , it is more convenient to use the interaction picture",
    ". let @xmath29 , \\\\",
    "a_2 & = a_+\\exp[-i(\\omega_a+\\delta\\omega)t].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the rotating - wave approximation , the hamiltonian becomes @xmath30 = a_1 \\exp[i(\\omega_a-\\omega_b)t ] , \\\\",
    "\\alpha_+ & \\equiv a_+ \\exp[-i(\\delta\\omega-\\omega_b)t ] = a_2 \\exp[i(\\omega_a+\\omega_b)t].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if one pumps the optical cavity at frequencies @xmath31 such that @xmath32 can be approximated as classical complex numbers , @xmath33 corresponds to linear coupling between @xmath34 and @xmath35 like a beam splitter , while @xmath36 corresponds to non - degenerate parametric amplification of the two modes .",
    "these two effects are schematically described in fig .",
    "[ cool_pa ] .     via parametric up - conversion .",

    "the easiest way is to use quantum langevin equations @xcite .",
    "assuming @xmath38 , the equations of motion for @xmath34 and @xmath35 are @xmath39 where @xmath24 and @xmath40 are the optical and microwave decay coefficients , respectively , and @xmath41 and @xmath42 are input quantum langevin noise operators , which obey the commutation relations given by @xmath43 } & = \\delta(t - t ' ) , & { \\left[b(t),b^\\dagger(t')\\right ] } & = \\delta(t - t').\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] assuming thermal and white statistics for @xmath41 and @xmath42 such that @xmath44 it can be shown that the microwave occupation number at steady state is @xmath45 which implies cooling for @xmath46 , since @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "this is the electro - optic analog of opto - mechanical sideband cooling @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath49 can saturate with increasing pump power when @xmath50 and the upper limit is @xmath51 in which case cooling is limited by the decay rate of the optical mode rather than the electro - optic coupling strength @xcite .",
    "the linear coupling between @xmath52 and @xmath53 also allows classical or quantum information to be transferred coherently between the microwave mode and the optical mode and may be useful as a coherent microwave receiver @xcite .    with blue - detuned pumping at @xmath54 , the parametric amplification process can create entangled photons or , equivalently , a two - mode squeezed state in the optical and microwave modes , if thermal fluctuations are negligible .",
    "the effect of thermal fluctuations on the entanglement can also be studied using quantum langevin equations and is qualitatively the same as that on the analogous phenomenon of opto - mechanical entanglement @xcite .",
    "one may also use parametric amplification beyond threshold to generate coherent microwaves , analogous to a phonon laser in opto - mechanics @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that the oscillation threshold condition is @xmath55 , which requires a similar number of pump photons to that required for significant cooling .",
    "as mentioned in sec .  [ formalism ] , if a whispering - gallery - mode optical cavity is used , parasitic coupling to higher - order modes can hamper the cooling or parametric amplification efficiency . to investigate the effect of this parasitic coupling on cooling , consider optical pumping at frequency @xmath56 and @xmath57 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ higher - order ] .",
    "the up - conversion process is then resonantly enhanced with respect to the down - conversion process .",
    "assuming undepleted pumping , the steady - state center - mode field is @xmath58 defining @xmath59 the coupled - mode equations become @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the input langevin noise operators for the @xmath63 and @xmath64 modes , respectively .",
    "assuming @xmath65 for simplicity , i obtain , after some straightforward but cumbersome algebra , @xmath66 the lowest achievable microwave occupation number is thus @xmath67 interestingly , this expression is identical to that for the minimum mechanical occupation number in opto - mechanical cooling using one optical mode @xcite . since the pump photon number @xmath68 also depends on @xmath69 , the optimal @xmath69 depends on the specific parameters of the system and can be calculated by minimizing @xmath70 with respect to @xmath69 .",
    "for example , when @xmath71 , @xmath72 is maximized and @xmath70 is minimized when @xmath73 .",
    "to perform qnd measurements of the microwave voltage , one can pump the optical cavity with laser light at @xmath0 in the single - optical - mode case and estimate the microwave voltage by measuring the phase of the output optical wave @xmath74 .",
    "if the optical pump is strong enough , in addition to the intrinsic shot noise in the phase quadrature of @xmath75 , one can also observe excess noise due to the back - action of light on the microwave .",
    "the shot noise relative to the signal decreases with optical power but the back - action noise increases with power , so there is a standard quantum limit ( sql ) to voltage measurement sensitivity , much like the sql of displacement measurement due to radiation pressure @xcite . in both cases",
    ", the sql can be overcome using squeezed light @xcite , variational measurement @xcite , or two mechanical or microwave resonators @xcite . although the sql has not been observed in opto - mechanical or electro - optic systems , it can be simulated by adding classical excess noise to the optical pump @xcite , and the aforementioned noise cancellation techniques can be used to remove any classical back - action noise as well .",
    "an interesting way of making back - action - evading measurements is to use double - sideband optical pumping @xcite . assuming equal - magnitude and undepleted double - sideband pumping , so that @xmath76 defining quadrature operators as @xmath77 } , \\\\",
    "x_b & \\equiv \\exp(-i\\nu)\\tilde{b}+\\exp(i\\nu)\\tilde{b}^\\dagger , \\\\",
    "y_b & \\equiv -i{\\left[\\exp(-i\\nu)\\tilde{b}-\\exp(i\\nu)\\tilde{b}^\\dagger\\right ] } , \\\\",

    "\\theta & \\equiv \\frac{\\theta_++\\theta_-}{2 } , \\quad \\nu \\equiv \\frac{\\theta_+-\\theta_-}{2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and again making the rotating - wave approximation , the equations of motion become @xmath78 where coupling to travelling waves and reservoirs for the microwave mode is neglected for clarity . the measured microwave quadrature @xmath79 is dynamically decoupled from the orthogonal quadrature @xmath80 , so the back - action introduced to @xmath80 via @xmath81 does not affect the estimation accuracy of @xmath79 .",
    "@xmath79 and @xmath82 can be changed independently by adjusting the phases of the two pump waves .",
    "this technique should also enable microwave squeezing by measurement and feedback @xcite .",
    "the double - sideband - pumping back - action - evading measurement scheme has recently been demonstrated for the measurement of a mechanical quadrature with a microwave field acting as the meter @xcite .",
    "for the cavity electro - optic modulator reported by ilchenko _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , @xmath83 if we assume a pump power @xmath84 of @xmath85  mw , @xmath86  nm , and @xmath87 , then @xmath88 @xmath49 thus needs to be increased by a factor of @xmath89 for cooling to be significant .",
    "apart from increasing the pump power , one can also improve the @xmath28 coefficient by reducing the size and capacitance of the microwave resonator . if one can make use of the maximum electro - optic coefficient @xmath90 pm / v in lithium niobate @xcite , make @xmath91  @xmath92 m instead of the 150  @xmath92 m reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , and assume @xmath93 and @xmath94  pf , the @xmath28 coefficient given by eq .",
    "( [ g ] ) can be as high as @xmath95  khz , which would make @xmath96 .",
    "this @xmath49 is already close to the upper limit @xmath97 according to eq .",
    "( [ g_limit ] ) , so one should reduce @xmath40 for more significant cooling .",
    "@xmath40 can be significantly reduced if the microwave resonator is unloaded or made of a better conductor .",
    "the quality factor of superconducting microwave resonators can be as high as @xmath98 to @xmath99 @xcite and @xmath40 can then be reduced and @xmath49 be enhanced by a factor of @xmath100 to @xmath101 . hence ,",
    "cooling and the other quantum effects proposed in this paper should be experimentally observable in the near future , as the technology for electro - optic integration continues to improve .",
    "in conclusion , i have outlined several interesting quantum effects that can in principle be observed in electro - optic systems .",
    "although these effects are challenging to demonstrate experimentally with current technology , they will enable new classical and quantum information processing capabilities that should be useful for both fundamental science and applied technology .",
