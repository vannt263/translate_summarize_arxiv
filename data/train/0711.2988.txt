    "neutrinos have been a focus of experimental effort over the last decade with old questions answered and new ones emerging .",
    "this review attempts to summarize the state of the field , highlighting progress made in the last two years ( the time since the last eps hep conference ) , and outlining prospects for the near future .    of necessity",
    "many neutrino related areas have been omitted from this work , either because they are covered in other parts of the eps hep conference , because they are too futuristic to be considered prospects for the near term , or because time and page constraints do not allow complete coverage .",
    "in particular , theoretical developments and the physics of cosmic ray neutrinos are covered in other reviews .",
    "neutrinos in cosmology , neutrino magnetic moment searches , and big bang relic neutrinos are absent due to lack of time and space .",
    "there is also no mention of superbeam experiments beyond no@xmath0a and t2k and no mention of neutrino factories or beta beams as these subjects will not be real in the near ( @xmath15 year ) term",
    ".     stands for  @xmath2 and similarly for @xmath3 etc . @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the two majorana phases and @xmath6 is the cp violating phase . ]    over the last decade the theoretical framework with which we describe the three known neutrinos has crystallized .",
    "the three neutrino mass eigenstates , conventionally known as @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 are related to the three flavor eigenstates @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 by a unitary matrix that can be conveniently broken into four parts .",
    "these are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : matrix ] . this particular way of breaking up the transformation is logical on experimental grounds .",
    "typically , a given experiment or measurement will be looking to study just one of these matrices or sectors , though knowledge of the other sectors is often needed to do this .",
    "one can then speak of measurements that probe the 12 sector , the 23 sector , the 13 sector , or the mass sector .",
    "being an interference phenomenon , neutrino oscillation is sensitive to differences between squared neutrino masses rather than the masses themselves .",
    "[ fig : hierarchy ] displays graphically what oscillation experiments have so far taught us about the neutrino masses .",
    "the overall mass scale is not known , but the lightest neutrino is constrained by tritium beta decay measurements to be less than about 2.2 ev . the solar neutrino experiments and the kamland reactor experiment measure the squared mass difference between the 1 and 2 mass eigenstates to be @xmath13ev@xmath14 .",
    "the atmospheric neutrino measurements , as long baseline measurements of @xmath11 disappearance , constrain the squared mass difference between the 2 and 3 mass eigenstates to be @xmath15ev@xmath14 . both of these are 3@xmath16 ranges .",
    "it is not determined , however , whether the mass of @xmath9 is larger or smaller than the @xmath7 and @xmath8 masses .",
    "these two scenarios are referred to as the normal and inverted hierarchy respectively .",
    "[ fig : numbers ] lists what we currently know about the neutrinos using the same color scheme established by figs .",
    "[ fig : matrix ] and [ fig : hierarchy ] .",
    "the structure of this review is provided by the structure of the transformation in fig .",
    "[ fig : matrix ] .",
    "there are sections describing experiments that measure the 12 sector , the 23 sector , the 13 sector , and , finally , the mass sector . before entering this logical progression ,",
    "however , there is a diversion in the next section to describe the new miniboone results and how they probe the indication of oscillations from lsnd .",
    "the liquid scintillator neutrino detector ( lsnd ) experiment @xcite operated at los alamos national lab in the 1990 s and produced evidence for @xmath17 oscillations at the @xmath18 ev@xmath14 scale .",
    "although the karlsruhe rutherford medium energy neutrino experiment ( karmen ) observed no evidence for neutrino oscillations @xcite in a similar mass range , a joint analysis @xcite showed compatibility at 64% cl .",
    "this @xmath19 scale is incompatible with those of the solar @xcite and `` atmospheric '' @xcite oscillations , and so requires there be more than 3 neutrinos if all three are to be interpreted as evidence of neutrino oscillation .",
    "the mini - booster neutrino experiment ( miniboone ) was built to test the oscillation interpretation of the lsnd result .",
    "it uses 8 gev protons from the fermilab booster to produce a high purity beam of @xmath20 gev @xmath11 by running the protons into a be target followed by a focusing horn .",
    "the detector is located 541 m from the target and comprises a spherical tank of inner radius 610 cm filled with 800 tons of pure mineral oil ( ch@xmath21 ) .",
    "the oil is viewed by 1280 8inch pmts and surrounded by a veto region viewed by 280 pmts . using the pattern and timing of the cerenkov and scintillation light hitting the tubes the experiment can distinguish electrons from other particles ( in particular @xmath22s and @xmath23s ) and so test for @xmath24 oscillations . in april 2007",
    "the experiment released it s first results @xcite .",
    "the experiment found no evidence of neutrino oscillations in its analysis region above a neutrino energy of 475 mev , though there was a excess of events found below this energy and this is currently under investigation .",
    "the exclusion plot that results from this measurement is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mbresult ] . the miniboone and lsnd results are only compatible at the 2% level if both are interpreted in the framework of two flavor neutrino oscillations .",
    "miniboone is currently taking data in anti - neutrino mode ( where the horn focusses negative particles ) and intends to make a measurement of @xmath25 appearance to more fully check the lsnd result .",
    "the 12 sector comprises the mixing angle @xmath26 and the squared mass difference @xmath27 between @xmath8 and @xmath7 .",
    "there are two types of experiment that have probed this sector ; solar neutrino measurements and long baseline reactor anti - neutrino experiments .",
    "these two will be covered in the next two sections .",
    "the values of @xmath27 and @xmath26 are such that the higher energy electron flavor neutrinos produced in the core of the sun leave it s surface as almost pure @xmath8 eigenstates .",
    "this is an effect of neutrino creation and adiabatic propagation through the very high matter densities in the sun .",
    "the expressions for the survival probability of an electron flavor neutrino are @xmath28    historically this probability for electron flavor neutrinos to disappear was known as the `` solar neutrino problem '' and it s measurement started with the pioneering experiments of ray davis at the homestake mine @xcite .",
    "a whole sequence of measurements of solar neutrinos culminated in the sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno ) which used the deuterium in heavy water as a target for solar neutrinos .",
    "this enabled a measurement of both the electron neutrino flux using the electrons produced by the charged current interaction and the flux of all active neutrino flavors using the neutrons produced by the neutral current breakup of the deuteron .",
    "[ fig : snoresult ] summarizes the beautiful set of measurements from sno .",
    "it plots the measured flux of electron neutrinos against the measured flux of muon and tau neutrinos .",
    "the sun is not energetic enough to produce muons or taus and yet sno shows conclusively that there is a flux of muon and tau neutrinos from the sun .",
    "the conclusion is that the electron flavor neutrinos are oscillating into muon and tau flavored on their way to the earth .",
    "the sno measurements put the `` solar neutrino problem '' to rest and , along with the kamland reactor neutrino experiment , enable precision measurement of the 12 sector parameters .      if one solves the vacuum equation of motion using the matrices of fig .",
    "[ fig : matrix ] and extracts the survival probability of electron neutrinos ( or more strictly electron anti - neutrinos ) one obtains @xmath29 from eqn .",
    "[ eqn : kamland ] it is clear that with the right choice for the neutrino energy @xmath30 and distance from neutrino source to detector @xmath31 an experiment could be sensitive to the parameters of the 12 sector with an electron anti - neutrino disappearance measurement .        for reactor anti - neutrinos with energies of a couple of mev the optimal distance from source to detector from eqn .",
    "[ eqn : kamland ] is about 200 km .",
    "this simple logic is what led to the proposal and construction of the kamland experiment in japan .",
    "the experiment uses 1000 tonnes of liquid scintillator in the kamioka mine in central japan to measure the flux of electron anti - neutrinos from all the power reactors in japan .",
    "these reactors are at a flux weighted average distance of 180 km , almost the ideal length .",
    "the kamland experiment measured a deficit of electron anti - neutrinos consistent with that expected from the measurement of the 12 sector parameters by sno . in fact , as fig .",
    "[ fig:12sector ] shows , the two experiments are wonderfully complementary .",
    "they use utterly different sources of neutrinos to measure the 12 sector parameters via two completely different effects and the agreement is remarkable .      the measurements of sno and kamland have put knowledge of the 12 sector parameters on a very secure footing , nonetheless the parameters can always be better constrained and the energy dependent step in the survival probability evident in eqn .  [",
    "eqn : solar ] has yet to be observed .",
    "the sno experiment will soon publish the results of the third and final phase of measurement where discrete neutron counters ( ncds ) were placed in the heavy water .",
    "this result should further pin down the mixing angle @xmath26 .",
    "a new generation of experiments are attempting to measure solar neutrinos down to 1 - 2 mev and look for the energy dependent shape of the survival probability : borexino @xcite started data taking in mid 2007 and kamland ii , the solar neutrino phase of the kamland experiment will soon get underway . beyond these efforts",
    "there are several proposals for measurements of solar neutrinos below 1 mev using the inverse @xmath5 decay of various isotopes .",
    "the 23 sector comprises the mixing angle @xmath32 and the squared mass difference @xmath33 between @xmath9 and @xmath8 . measurements of muon neutrino survival probability probe this sector . using the matrices of fig .",
    "[ fig : matrix ] and the vacuum equation of motion the probability that a muon neutrino of energy @xmath30 will survive as a muon neutrino after having traveled a distance @xmath31 is given by @xmath34    in order to probe the mass ranges relevant to the 23 sector with the gev scale energies at which @xmath11s are most readily produced eqn .",
    "[ eqn : numu_survival ] dictates that the baseline @xmath31 be in the few 100 km range .",
    "there are two types of experiments that can be done with these sorts of parameters : experiments measuring the neutrinos produced when cosmic rays hit the atmosphere and experiments located several hundred km from an accelerator source of muon neutrinos .",
    "the next two sections describe each of these types .",
    "historically the disappearance of atmospheric muon neutrinos indicated by eqn .",
    "[ eqn : numu_survival ] was known as the `` atmospheric neutrino anomaly '' .",
    "several experiments @xcite , but most notably the kamiokande and superk experiments @xcite in japan , clearly showed that the flux of muon neutrinos from the atmosphere was significantly less than predicted whereas the flux of electron neutrinos agreed well with predictions ( at least within the normalization systematic error ) .",
    "furthermore , the zenith angle dependence , which is directly related to the baseline @xmath31 , of the deficit is exactly what one would predict from eqn .",
    "[ eqn : numu_survival ] .    since the atmosphere is not a very well controlled source of neutrinos a confirmation that the atmospheric results were due to the oscillations of eqn .",
    "[ eqn : numu_survival ] was sought .",
    "the k2k experiment @xcite , also in japan , provided that reassurance .",
    "they used 12 gev protons incident on a carbon target within a focusing horn to create a very pure beam of muon neutrinos at the kek lab directed toward the superk detector @xmath35 km away .",
    "they were able to demonstrate disappearance of the @xmath11s consistent with the predictions of eqn .",
    "[ eqn : numu_survival ] with the parameters inferred from the atmospheric measurements .",
    "there was agreement both in the overall level of disappearance and in the spectral distortion produced by the energy dependence of the oscillation .          with the k2k experiment confirming the disappearance of muon neutrinos as a result of oscillations it falls to the minos experiment to make a precision measurement of the effect and",
    "further constrain the 23 sector parameters .",
    "minos uses 120 gev protons from the fermilab main injector incident on a carbon target in a system of two horns to create a high purity @xmath11 beam that is directed toward the soudan mine 735 km away in northern minnesota .",
    "there is a near detector at fermilab and a far detector at soudan .",
    "each are made from alternating planes of steel and scintillator with the near detector weighing about 1 kton and the far detector 5.4 kton .",
    "the comparison of @xmath11 rates in near and far detectors and the very large numbers of protons incident on target enables a precision measurement of the @xmath11 disappearance to be made .",
    "new results from minos on the 23 sector parameters were announced at the eps hep 2007 conference @xcite and are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:23sector ] along with the older results from the superk atmospheric measurements and the k2k experiment .",
    "the oscillations in this sector are consistent with being maximal ( i.e. @xmath36 ) , but the precision with which @xmath32 is known is not great .",
    "it is an interesting open question how close to maximal @xmath32 really is .",
    "the recent minos results shown in fig .  [ fig:23sector ] are still statistics limited and , as minos continues to take data over the next few years , it will continue to improve the constraints on @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the upcoming experiments t2k @xcite and no@xmath0a @xcite are designed to probe the 13 sector and are described more fully in the later sections , but they will also be able to make very precise measurements of the 23 sector and probe the issue of how close @xmath32 comes to being maximal .    if the @xmath11s are oscillating away in experiments with gev energies and baselines hundreds of kilometers long then they must be oscillating into tau neutrinos if the scheme of mixings and masses described in figs .",
    "[ fig : matrix],[fig : hierarchy],[fig : numbers ] is correct .",
    "it would be a powerful test of the scheme to look for these @xmath12s and the opera experiment @xcite is designed to do just that .",
    "opera is a hybrid emulsion and tracking detector that has recently started taking data in gran sasso .",
    "it detects neutrinos from the cngs beam created at cern .",
    "the baseline is 732 km and the mean neutrino energy 17 gev .",
    "this energy is high enough for any @xmath12s in the beam to be able to create @xmath37 leptons via charged current interactions .",
    "opera will look for these @xmath37s by carefully scanning the 1.8 kton of lead / emulsion bricks that form the heart of the detector .",
    "the 13 sector comprises the mixing angle @xmath38 , the phase @xmath6 which , if different from 0 or @xmath39 , would induce cp violation into the scheme of neutrino oscillations , and the hierarchy which is just the question of whether the masses are ordered with the almost degenerate doublet @xmath7 and @xmath8 higher or lower than the @xmath9 mass",
    ". there are no constraints of any significance on @xmath6 and the hierarchy is unknown .",
    "we do have constraints on @xmath38 , however , provided by experiments measuring electron anti - neutrino disappearance at baselines roughly 1 km from the reactor source .",
    "the oscillation is described in the next section and the best of these measurements to date is the chooz experiment that operated in france in the 1990 s @xcite .",
    "shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:13sector ] are the current constraints on the 13 sector mixing parameters .",
    "note that the smallness of @xmath27 ensures that @xmath40 and @xmath33 are the same to the level of precision at which current and near future experiments operate .    besides the disappearance of reactor anti - neutrinos the 13 sector can also be probed by looking for @xmath24 oscillations using baselines and energies sensitive to the parameters of both the 12 and 23 sectors .",
    "future experiments using this process are described in a later section .",
    "[ sec : kamland ] described how the kamland experiment used reactor anti - neutrinos and a baseline of order 200 km to measure parameters of the 12 sector . in this configuration the @xmath41 is matched to @xmath27 . by instead measuring the disappearance of reactor anti - neutrinos at a baseline @xmath31 of @xmath42 km",
    "one can match the @xmath41 to @xmath40 and be sensitive to the parameters of the 13 sector .",
    "the expression for the electron anti - neutrino survival probability is then @xmath43    the chooz experiment used a single detector located 1.05 km from the reactor core .",
    "a new generation of these kilometer baseline reactor experiments is being constructed in the hope of improving on the chooz measurement and further constraining the value of @xmath38 , either limiting it to be even closer to zero or measuring a non - zero value for it .",
    "these new experiments hope to be sensitive to a value of @xmath44 as small as 0.01 .",
    "to do this they are making several upgrades to the chooz approach .",
    "most importantly they are using multiple detectors to cancel systematics .",
    "these detectors will be larger , be located at very high flux reactors , and be exposed to the beam for longer",
    ". they will be underground to reduce the effect of cosmics and be thoroughly calibrated .",
    "the main contenders in this next round are double chooz @xcite , located at the same site as the original chooz experiment , and the daya bay experiment @xcite located in china .",
    "both experiments are under construction and have a staged approach to the measurement , bringing out results first with a subset of the final detector configuration and later with the full complement of detectors .          the second way to probe the 13 sector is by looking for @xmath24 oscillations at values of @xmath41 matched to @xmath33 .",
    "one is then looking at a process usually used to probe the 12 sector , but with experiment parameters appropriate to the 23 sector .",
    "it is via this interference that the 13 sector is probed .",
    "the full expression for the oscillation probability is @xmath45 @xmath46    eqn .",
    "[ eqn : nueapp ] is not a simple expression . with the exception of the overall neutrino mass scale , it involves all the parameters defined in figs .",
    "[ fig : matrix],[fig : hierarchy],[fig : numbers ] in complicated combinations .",
    "the @xmath47 sign is negative if the hierarchy is normal and positive if it is inverted . when running in anti - neutrino mode and looking for @xmath48 oscillations the same expression holds , but with the sign of the cp violating phase @xmath6 and the sign of the matter term @xmath49 flipped .",
    "the comparison of the oscillation in neutrino and anti - neutrino mode can therefore be used to search for cp violation , but the complicating effects of the matter potential have to be understood .",
    "two of the three terms on the right hand side of eqn .",
    "[ eqn : nueapp ] depend on @xmath50 and enable the search for @xmath24 oscillations to look for a non - zero @xmath38 .",
    "there are two experiments under construction that will use eqn .",
    "[ eqn : nueapp ] to probe the 13 sector , first by searching for a non - zero @xmath38 and if one is found then determining the hierarchy and searching for cp violation .",
    "the two experiments are no@xmath0a and t2k .",
    "no@xmath0a will use the beamline currently used by minos , with a new detector being built 810 km away in far northern minnesota .",
    "t2k will use the existing superk detector and the beam will be sent from the jparc accelerator lab currently under construction about 250 km away .",
    "both experiments will make use of an off - axis beam to reduce backgrounds and increase sensitivity .",
    "as one moves off the beam axis of a conventionally produced neutrino beam the high energy tail of neutrinos is dramatically reduced leading to fewer backgrounds from neutral current events .",
    "also , the @xmath10 contamination of the beam from sources such as @xmath51 and @xmath52 decay is significantly reduced .",
    "these two features come at little cost in @xmath11 flux , in fact the more peaked off - axis @xmath11 spectrum can be better tuned to the oscillation maximum .      on several occasions",
    "this review has noted that current or upcoming experiments are making measurements with neutrinos of gev energies .",
    "typically these experiments use the charged current quasi - elastic ( ccqe ) interaction because the neutrino energy and flavor can be inferred from the final state particles .",
    "[ fig : ccqe - xsec ] is a compilation of the world s ccqe cross - section measurements in the few gev range .",
    "it is clear that the ccqe cross - section in this range is not particularly well know . for experiments with a near detector",
    "this level of cross - section uncertainty is tolerable as it largely cancels when one takes a ratio of near detector to far detector rates ( so long as the two detectors have the same target nuclei ) .",
    "the situation is more serious for the cross - sections of processes that can produce backgrounds to either a search for @xmath10 appearance or @xmath11 disappearance .",
    "neutral current @xmath23 production and charged current @xmath53 production are two examples where the cross - sections are very poorly known . even using near to far ratios ,",
    "if the upcoming experiments are to perform to their full capacity it will be necessary for the signal and background cross - sections to be better measured .",
    "to this end two current experiments , miniboone and sciboone and one near future experiment , miner@xmath0a are setting out to measure neutrino cross - sections in the gev energy range .",

    "[ sec : miniboone ] in the context of its test of the lsnd measurement .",

    "sciboone is a new experiment that has taken the scibar fine grained tracking calorimeter from the k2k experiment and put it into the same booster neutrino beamline at fermilab that miniboone uses",
    ". the fine grained detector will give sciboone an ability to distinguish final states that big cerenkov detectors like miniboone can not match .",
    "the detector is already taking data and first results are expected soon .",
    "the miner@xmath0a experiment is building a high granularity detector in the numi beamline at fermilab .",
    "it will have the ability to run with a variety of target materials .",
    "it has a large physics program including cross - section measurements in the few gev energy range .",
    "the mass sector comprises the mass of the lightest neutrino , the two majorana phases in the mixing matrix ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 in fig .",
    "[ fig : matrix ] ) and the question of whether the neutrinos are dirac or majorana particles . since the squared mass differences can be measured with the oscillation experiments",
    "already described it is only the overall mass scale , in the form of the lightest neutrino mass , that is left to be determined .",
    "this lightest mass can be constrained by kinematic measurements of the electron produced in @xmath5 decay .",
    "the masses , majorana phases , and the dirac or majorana nature of the neutrino can be studied by looking for neutrinoless double @xmath5 decay .",

    "the presence of the neutrino masses @xmath62 in this expression only has a noticeable impact close to the endpoint energy @xmath59 where they cause the spectrum to cutoff at lower energy than would be expected if the neutrinos were massless .",
    "it is this features than enables experiments to search for neutrino mass by studying this endpoint region with extreme precision .",
    "the fraction of @xmath5 decays where the electron is close to the endpoint energy scales inversely with that endpoint energy and so the best @xmath5 decay limits on neutrino mass come from looking at the decays with the lowest endpoint energy .",
    "as well as having a very low endpoint energy of 18.6 kev , tritium is very light and so has nuclear and atomic corrections to the spectrum that are relatively easy to calculate .",
    "this is why the best limits on neutrino mass from @xmath5 decay kinematics come from measuring tritium .",
