    "calculations with x - wind jet models in @xcite support the notion that the higher luminosities of [ ne ii ] 12.81  line in the bimodal distribution correlate well with the presence of stronger [ o i ] @xmath45 emission , which is an indicator of jet activity . additionally , [ ne ii ] emission was not detected in sz 102 with the vlt / visir long - slit spectroscopy , as the slit orientation was perpendicular to the jet axis .",
    "this non - detection supports the interpretation that the irs - detected [ ne ii ] 12.81  might come from the jet @xcite .",
    "further constraints require velocity - resolved spectra of both [ ne ii ] and [ ne iii ] in the mir .",
    "since high - dispersion observations of the mir [ ne iii ] line are not viable from the ground , the optical [ ne iii ] @xmath57 doublet , with critical electron density of @xmath58 @xmath11 , stands out as a critical tracer for the jet origins of neon emission from low - mass ysos .    in this work ,",

    "we also explore scenarios that could lead to the irradiation by x - rays in the sz 102 system in section [ discussion ] and summarize the perspectives in section [ summary ] .",
    "on 2011 july 21 we obtained a low - dispersion ( @xmath60 ) blue spectrum of sz  102 ( figure  [ fig - blow ] ) .",
    "the data were obtained using the smarts / ctio 1.5 m with the long slit rc spectrograph in first order with grating 26 ( see * ? ? ? * for a description of the instrumental setup and data reduction ) .",
    "the reduced image is the sum of three 1200 s integrations .",
    "the slit width is 10 ; the slit is oriented fixed at 90 . at the time of observation the air mass was 1.03 , the parallactic angle was 60 , and",

    "line intensities , relative to h@xmath61 , are given in table  [ tbl - blow ] .",
    "intensities of the lines are not in great agreement with those of @xcite .",
    "this is likely attributable to the different slit sizes , and perhaps some stellar variability .",
    "in particular , the large discrepancy in the strengths of the 3933 , 3968 , and 4072 lines may be due to the fact that the smarts slit is relatively narrow , and fixed in position angle .",
    "we likely lost some blue light .",

    "the slit was kept parallel to the parallactic angle in order to minimize flux loss due to atmospheric scattering .",
    "this results in slit misalignment with the jet axis ranging from 4  to 18  during the observation . to mitigate the effect of misalignment , only the first exposure ( with an average misalignment of @xmath70 ) was used for analysis .",
    "two - dimensional spectral images were reduced using the eso uves pipeline version 4.9.8 .",
    "bias subtraction , order determination , flat - fielding , wavelength and flux calibration were executed during the pipeline cascade .",
    "night - sky emission lines were identified based on the list of @xcite , and then spatially averaged and subtracted from the spectra .",
    "the heliocentric correction , obtained from the pipeline - reduced one - dimensional spectrum , was used to correct the wavelengths in the two - dimensional spectra .",
    "furthermore , all the wavelengths were shifted by the @xmath71 kms@xmath5 systemic velocity @xcite of the star .",
    "figure [ 1dspec ] shows the one - dimensional spectrum extracted from the flux - calibrated two - dimensional spectra .    only the reflection nebula associated with sz 102 , not the star , is visible in the optical .",
    "its wavelength - dependent peak positions and widths were determined by fitting the spatial profiles with one - dimensional gaussians .",
    "for every 100 pixels in the wavelength domain , spatial profiles in the line - free regions were binned and fitted .",

    "the binned two - dimensional spectra were analyzed by fitting one - dimensional gaussians along both the spatial and dispersion axes .",
    "offsets from the centroid of reflection nebula ( @xmath72 ) were determined by fitting a single - component gaussian along the cross - dispersion axis for each spectral bin .",
    "for each spatial row , the line profile was fitted with multiple gaussians , depending on the skewness .",
    "based on the peak positions of the gaussian fitting , each row was decomposed into a blueshifted and a redshifted component by subtracting either the redshifted or the blueshifted gaussians . for each of the lines , a set of `` blue '' spectra",
    "were then formed from the residual blueshifted component , and a set of `` red '' spectra were formed from the redshifted component . for presentation purposes ,",

    ". properties of the emission lines , including ionization potentials ( i.p . ) of the species , critical densities ( @xmath82 ) , upper - level energies relative to the ground state ( @xmath83 ) , and noise and contour levels of pv diagrams , are summarized in table [ lineproperties ] .",
    "the panels are arranged such that the ionization potentials generally decrease from left to right and from top to bottom , and critical densities decrease from left to right for the same ionization state ( [ s ii ] ) and from top to bottom for the central column ( [ n ii ] , [ o ii ] , and [ s ii ] ) . cyan filled circles overlaid on the pv diagrams are the fitted spatial centroids of different velocity bins .",
    "the centroid positions depend primarily on @xmath82 ; line species with @xmath84 @xmath11 tend to have centroids within 03 from the position of reflection nebula but those with @xmath85 @xmath11 ( the central column ) have centroids at up to or beyond 05 .",
    "a trend that the redshifted spatial centroids are closer to @xmath72 than the blueshifted counterpart can be seen in high - ionization lines .",
    "the trend can also be seen but is less obvious in low - density lines .",
    "such relative spatial offsets seem to be counter - intuitive for an edge - on system with a flat disk that usually has its reflection nebula at the blueshifted side",
    ". the true stellar position may be anywhere between the positions of the blueshifted and redshifted peaks and can not be determined from the current data set .",

    "therefore , the kinematics of the lines are better deciphered after decomposition . for most of the lines ,",
    "the redshifted component is stronger and centered at a velocity @xmath89 kms@xmath5 , with velocity widths ranging from 100 to 140 kms@xmath5 .",

    "species such as [ n",
    "ii ] , [ o i ] , [ o ii ] , and [ s ii ] , traces the receding jet @xcite .",
    "the kinematics traced by the blueshifted emission is remarkably different from its redshifted counterpart .",
    "the peaks of the lines range between @xmath90 to @xmath91 kms@xmath5 , with an averaged line width of @xmath92 kms@xmath5 .",
    "the blueshifted peak velocities obtained from the line profiles appear to be a factor of @xmath93 larger than the velocities obtained through low- to medium - dispersion spectra ( @xmath94 kms@xmath5 ; @xcite ; @xmath95 kms@xmath5 ; @xcite ) .",
    "asymmetries between the blueshifted and redshifted jets in velocity and intensity can also be seen among different emission lines .",
    "the most obvious difference appears in oxygen lines with different ionization states . in [ o iii ] @xmath37 lines , the peak intensity and total flux from both sides are nearly identical . in [ o ii ] @xmath96 lines , the blueshifted peak becomes @xmath97 of the redshifted peak , and in [ o i ] lines , the ratio drops to @xmath98 . for other lines , the ratios decrease from @xmath99 in [ ne iii ] , to @xmath100 in [ n ii ] , and @xmath98 in [ s ii ] lines . that the trend of intensity contrast generally follows the ionization states of the lines suggests very different ionization conditions inside the two jets .",
    "the higher flux ratios in the high - excitation oxygen lines suggest that the ionization fraction in the blue jet is higher , despite the much weaker intensity due to the lower density overall .    emission spectrally extending across the systemic velocity",
    "was observed in both the blueshifted and redshifted jets in all the lines .",
    "the redshifted profile extends blueward up to @xmath101 kms@xmath5 and the blueshifted profile has a redward extension up to @xmath102 kms@xmath5 .",
    "this kind of spectral feature was first mentioned as the `` excess '' emission by @xcite in comparing the observed [ fe ii ] spectra of the rw aur a jet with the synthetic spectra predicted by models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "observationally , it is easily missed after the continuum subtraction due to its relative weakness and its proximity to the scattered stellar continuum in some low - mass sources ( see discussions in , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it may be understood that for the case of sz 102 , its edge - on disk has reduced the amount of scattered stellar continuum and helps to raise the contrast between the jet emission and stellar contributions .",
    "this also results in fewer artifacts that may be introduced by the stellar continuum subtraction and enables a better assessment of the origins of emission lines since the entirety of the line profiles can be preserved .",
    "these features are prominent in all the forbidden lines reported here , especially in the redshifted jet .",

    "comparing with the uves spectra that were resampled and convolved with the stis instrumental profile , the somewhat larger line widths and higher peak velocities of the redshifted emission in the stis spectra may be an effect of its lower velocity resolution and lower spectral sampling rate .",
    "comparisons for the blueshifted line profiles are less robust since both spectra are faint .",
    "imperfect decomposition residuals in the blueshifted components of the uves spectra may also cause confusion .",
    "the overall agreements from the two data sets suggest that the uves spectra mainly trace the jet emission from a nearly edge - on system and that the velocity decomposition can separate the two jets despite confusion close to the star .      [ ne iii ]",

    "ionization mechanisms , such as _ in situ _ shock ionization beyond @xmath178 kms@xmath5 , external irradiation by euv and hard x - rays , are discussed in the context of the sz 102 system .",
    "the inferred temperature from optical line ratios ( @xmath244 k ) is incompatible with that of strong shocks ( @xmath245 k ) , suggesting the ionization of neon and excitation of the optical [ ne iii ] line may not occur in the same volume of the jet .",
    "soft x - rays as well as euv radiations produced in accretion shocks may be easily absorbed and would not provide enough hard photons for the doubly ionized neons .",
    "large but rare flares are known to generate ample kev photons in other yso systems such as dg tau .",
    "although undetected in sz 102 thus far , they may meet the energetic requirement of the ionizing photons .",
    "future x - ray monitoring of the sz 102 system is key to confirm the existence of the hard x - ray component .",
    "further higher angular - resolution optical observations are also needed to trace the ionization and heating history of the microjets . to accomplish this mission , combined observations with _",
