    "the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) , a representative intermediate - age population , is the most luminous evolutionary stage for low- and intermediate - mass ( 1  8 m@xmath2 ) stars .",
    "agb stars emit a huge amount of near- to mid - infrared light because of their low effective temperature ( @xmath3 1000  4000 k ) and circumstellar dust .",
    "hence it is expected that they contribute significantly to the infrared light of galaxies . however , their infrared luminosity contribution in galaxies , even in a simple stellar population ( ssp ) , is still a debating issue with regard to constructing evolutionary population synthesis ( eps ) models ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "the eps models are an useful tool to determine physical parameters of stellar complexes such as star clusters and galaxies by spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting .",
    "these models reproduce seds of stellar systems by synthesizing the seds of stellar populations in various evolutionary stages , assuming age , metallicity , foreground and internal reddening values , star formation history , and so on . therefore , the spectral energy contribution of individual stellar populations influences the estimation of physical parameters of stellar systems , and especially that of the agb population plays a key for understanding of the seds for stellar systems expected by eps models .",
    "there are various eps models that include the agb evolutionary process ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "bruzual & charlot ( 2003 , hereafter bc03 ) , for example , presented an eps model based on padova evolutionary tracks including just two evolutionary stages for thermally pulsing agb ( tp - agb ) @xcite , while their recent model includes 15 evolutionary stages of the tp - agb oxygen - rich and carbon - rich phases @xcite .",
    "the padova evolutionary tracks adopted in the bc03 model include a given core overshooting efficiency .",
    "on the other hand , maraston ( 1998 , 2005 ) used evolutionary tracks assuming zero efficiency of the core overshooting from cassisi et al.(1997 , 2000 ) to determine luminosity contribution of main - sequence populations .",
    "it makes the lifetime of main - sequence stars in the @xcite model shorter compared with padova isochrones .",
    "in addition , she used the fuel consumption theorem @xcite for post - main - sequence stars , not adopting the isochrone synthesis method . in the model of @xcite ,",
    "the tp - agb evolutionary process is modified in the fuel consumption theorem , applying the advanced envelope burning process of agb stars . @xcite estimated the contribution of tp - agb population in the young ssps with ages @xmath4 yr , and compared it with the star clusters in the the magellanic clouds ( mcs ) .",
    "they found that it is too high to be consistent with the observational results based on these star clusters . considering this difference , @xcite suggested a revised model , assuming shorter lifetime and lower fuel consumption of tp - agb stars than @xcite .",
    "bc03 and @xcite adopted different stellar population synthetic methods , and the seds reproduced by these models show recognizable differences .",
    "a number of studies argue whether or not these eps models reproduce well observational quantities of stellar systems related with the agb population as follows .",
    "some studies found that spectra and seds of post - starburst galaxies or distant galaxies ( z @xmath1 1  2 ) have no near - infrared boosted features , which is similar to the expectation of the bc03 model ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , @xcite suggested that the bc03 model and their own eps model , a flexible stellar population synthesis model , reproduce the color of star clusters and post - starburst galaxies better than the @xcite model .",
    "in contrast , others confirmed that the @xcite model performs well in reproducing near - infrared colors , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and seds of low to high redshift galaxies ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , @xcite and @xcite showed that the rest - frame @xmath7 band mass - to - light ratio evolution and @xmath0 band luminosity evolution of galaxies are explained better by the @xcite model than by the bc03 model .",
    "in addition to these galaxy studies , there are several studies investigating star clusters , especially star clusters in the mcs , considering the relevance between the model performance and ages of stellar systems . because of their proximity , they are very useful to examine not only the individual stellar population directly but also the integrated properties of star clusters .",
    "therefore , they are an ideal object to calibrate ssp models . @xcite investigated optical to near - infrared colors , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , of 54 star clusters in the mcs , and concluded that the bc03 and the @xcite present the best performance for intermediate - age ( 0.2  2 gyr ) and old ( @xmath11 2 gyr ) star clusters , respectively .",
    "lyubenova et al .",
    "( 2010 , 2012 ) analyzed integrated near - infrared high - resolution spectra of six globular clusters in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) with ages @xmath1 1  13 gyr .",
    "they showed that the @xcite model expects @xmath12 and @xmath13 band spectra of all their sample star clusters adequately , while it does not for @xmath7 band spectra of the star clusters with ages @xmath14 2 gyr .",
    "recently @xcite presented the calibration data for stellar population models using 43 star clusters in the mcs .",
    "they compared the observed colors of the star clusters , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 , as a function of ages with the theoretical expectation of various models including bc03 and @xcite . in conclusion , for the ages older than 1 gyr , the models of @xcite and bc03 are along the upper end lower end of the observed color , respectively . in the case of the younger ages ,",
    "bc03 model reproduces well the observed color of star clusters , while @xcite model expects them too red .",
    "while above studies investigated the integrated properties of star clusters , @xcite analyzed the resolved agb population in the lmc star clusters in detail .",
    "they investigated 19 lmc star clusters in terms of @xmath0 band luminosity contribution of agb stars as a function of cluster ages .",
    "the star clusters used in @xcite have ages of 100 myr  3 gyr ( log(age ) @xmath1 8.0  9.5 ) .",
    "they concluded that their empirical results are consistent with the expectation of @xcite for this age range .",
    "later , @xcite suggested a similar conclusion from the additional study of four old star clusters in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) . in this study , we investigate the evolution of agb luminosity contribution with a large number of lmc star clusters with log(age ) @xmath1 7.3  9.5 , overcoming the shortcomings in the previous studies . because mucciarelli et al .",

    "in addition , most of previous star cluster studies adopted star cluster ages from various literature .",

    "@xcite presented an extended source catalog of the mcs including star clusters , emission nebulae , associations , and hi shells .",

    "we constructed 2-dimensional number density maps of bright stars with @xmath27 20.5 mag around the center coordinates of the star clusters presented by @xcite .",
    "the number density maps are smoothed with a boxcar filter whose width is 20@xmath28 .",
    "center coordinates , coordinate errors , and position angles of each star cluster were estimated by 2-dimensional gaussian fitting of this smoothed number density map .",
    "the field of view for the fitting region is 3 times larger than the radius of each cluster given in @xcite .",

    "we estimated the @xmath0 band luminosity of star clusters by aperture photometry using 2mass @xmath0 band images .",

    "the background level was estimated using the mode value of the annulus region . for cluster photometry we used circular apertures with radius that is the same as the cluster radius .",
    "figure [ fig : aperture ] displays a @xmath0 band image of an example star cluster , ngc 1861 , showing the position of apertures for the cluster and background area .",
    "we calculated the @xmath0 band luminosity of agb stars in each cluster by summing their luminosity converted from 2mass magnitudes , and obtained the @xmath0 band luminosity fraction of agb stars in the star clusters .",
    "table [ tab : agb.lf ] summarizes the properties of agb populations as well as other basic parameters of 102 lmc star clusters .",
    "it lists the number of agb stars , and the @xmath0 band luminosity and luminosity fraction of agb stars in each cluster , as well as @xmath0 band integrated magnitude and luminosity of the star clusters .",

    "we adopted the @xmath0 band absolute magnitude @xmath58 mag for the sun , using @xmath59 mag @xcite and @xmath60 mag @xcite , to convert the magnitude into the luminosity .",
    "the error of the agb luminosity fraction is contributed by various errors in addition to the photometric ones estimated for the integrated magnitude of star clusters and presented for the 2mass magnitude of agb stars .",
    "first , there exist the errors of center coordinates and radii of star clusters , influencing the estimation of their integrated luminosity .",
    "we performed aperture photometry for all sample clusters , setting different center positions and radii according to their errors .",
    "we selected the upper and lower errors of the integrated luminosity of star clusters , also considering photometric errors .",
    "secondly , there are the errors for the luminosity of agb stars , which consist of ( a ) 2mass photometric error for individual agb stars and ( b ) the uncertainty from the poisson error for the number of agb stars in each star cluster associated with agb star counts .",
    "of these two , the latter is much larger than the former .",
    "the agb luminosity error from poisson error is calculated by multiplying the square root of the number of agb stars by the mean luminosity for an agb star in each cluster .",
    "we tabulated upper and lower errors of the @xmath0 band luminosity fraction obtained by error propagation , considering overall error budget mentioned above ( see table [ tab : agb.lf ] ) .",
    "note that the smaller the numbers of agb stars in star clusters are , the larger the errors of the luminosity fraction are .    additionally , we checked the field contamination in agb star count .",

    "we obtained the maraston model prediction for the luminosity contribution of agb stars in ssps as a function of ages @xcite .",
    "the theoretical isochrones of @xcite are based on isochrones of @xcite for low- and intermediate - mass stars ( m @xmath68 m@xmath67 ) and @xcite for high - mass stars ( m @xmath69 m@xmath67 ) .",
    "note that stellar evolutionary tracks of @xcite are adopted in the bc03 model . in this model",
    ", they included the simplified tp - agb phase and no circumstellar dust that form in agb stars .",
    "@xcite presented optical to far - infrared isochrones with improved tp - agb models .",
    "@xcite searched for the tp - agb population of 12 galaxies in the acs nearby galaxy survey treasury , and found that the model of @xcite creates more tp - agb populations than observed ones .",
    "they corrected the mass - loss rate of tp - agb stars in this model by reducing their lifetime ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this model reproduces the number of tp - agb stars well , but still has uncertainties in their 1.6@xmath70 m band flux contribution @xcite .",
    "additionally , we adopted the isochrone set that includes the circumstellar dust from agb stars @xcite and assumed that the dust composition is 100% silicate and 100% amorphous carbonate dust for o - rich and c - rich agb stars , respectively .",
    "these two kinds of padova isochrones consider the core convective overshooting . in order to investigate this effect , we used the basti isochrone dataset ( pietrinferni et al .",
    "2004 , 2006 ) without overshooting efficiency .",
    "we selected a scaled solar isochrone set that contains the extended agb population .",
    "we calculated the predicted @xmath0 band luminosity fraction of agb stars in ssps by analyzing the mock star clusters produced from the isochrones of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "we used the isochrone sets with metallicity z = 0.008 , corresponding to [ z / h ] @xmath1 -0.35 for mock cluster experiments .",
    "this value is close to the mean value for the lmc , for our cluster samples .",
    "the method is described as follows .",
    "we created model stars in mock star clusters assuming the salpeter initial mass function , and assigned @xmath12 and @xmath0 magnitudes to each star using four different isochrone sets .",
    "in addition , we considered magnitude errors for each star in order to make the model prediction more realistic . in the 2mass catalog ,",
    "mean magnitude errors and error variances of stars in each magnitude bin vary as a function of magnitudes .",
    "we assumed that photometric errors of model stars are distributed normally with the mean value and the variance according to magnitude bins . in @xmath71",
    "cmds of model stars in mock star clusters with empirical magnitude errors , agb stars are selected with the same criteria as done for observational data ( see  4.1 ) .",
    "the @xmath0 band luminosities of mock star clusters and agb stars are calculated by summing the @xmath0 band luminosity of member stars and agb stars , respectively .",
    "note that for the basti models , they do not provide the magnitudes of 2mass filter system , so that we adopted those of the bessell filter system .",
    "finally , we obtained the @xmath0 band luminosity fraction of agb stars in mock star clusters with three different mass ( @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 @xmath75 ) , assuming 15 different ages ( 8.0 @xmath76 log(age ) @xmath76 9.5 ) for each mass scale .",
    "stochastic effects are inevitable in agb star counts because of the short lifetime of agb stars . in figure",
    "[ fig : main1](a ) , there is a large scatter in the @xmath0 band luminosity fraction of agb stars in the star clusters derived in this study .",
    "the agb stars evolve fast , and become blue and faint when they enter the post - agb phase .",
    "therefore , we can not detect all stars that have entered the agb phase . as a result it makes the luminosity fraction of agb stars in star clusters lower than expected .",
    "especially , this effect becomes significant for faint star clusters , because of a smaller number of stars .",
    "bright star clusters ( @xmath77 ) show relatively smaller scatters and seem to be located along a sequence .",
    "this trend also appears in the mock star clusters ( see figure [ fig : stoch ] ) .",
    "we made mock star clusters with 15 different ages and three different masses using four different isochrone sets as above .",
    "for each age and mass bin , we made 10 mock star clusters in order to analyze them statistically .",
    "figure [ fig : stoch ] shows the @xmath0 band luminosity fraction of agb stars in the mock star clusters as a function of ages . in this figure , the most massive mock star clusters with m = @xmath74",
    "m@xmath67 show the smallest scatter among mock clusters with other mass scale , and make a well - defined sequence ( shaded region ) .",
    "however , mock star clusters with m = @xmath73 m@xmath67 ( circles ) are distributed with large scatter from the massive mock cluster sequence .",
    "therefore we presented two representatives for the observational data : mean values and the bright cluster sequence .",
    "figure [ fig : main2 ] shows a comparison of our results and those expected from five models . in the case of padova and basti models , we adopted the mean locus line of the massive mock star clusters presented in figure [ fig : stoch ] .",
    "note that the padova02 and basti_os models show almost same results of agb luminosity evolution in ssps .",
    "it reflects that the padova models include the same ingredients as the basti_os model in terms of the core overshooting . except for these two models ,",
    "there are several differences in model expectations .",
    "first , peak values of the luminosity contribution of agb stars expected in models are different .",
    "the maraston and padova10 models suggest 0.7  0.8 for the value of the highest agb fraction , while other three models ( padova02 , basti_std , and basti_os ) do just up to @xmath1 0.6 .",
    "second , all models expect peak values at the similar age range with log(age ) @xmath1 8.6  8.8 , except for the basti_std model .",
    "the peak position of the basti model expectation lies at slightly younger age compared with the expectation of other models .",
    "it is because the null overshooting efficiency leads to the shorter lifetime of main - sequence stars .",
    "third , both young and old parts are different between the maraston model and other models .",
    "padova02 , padova10 , and basti_os models show that the agb luminosity fraction in ssps is lowest at log(age ) @xmath1 8.0 and increases continuously up to the highest value as ssps are getting older , while the maraston model suggests that it comes up to already @xmath1 0.4 at log(age ) = 8.0  8.3 and increases drastically afterwards . the basti_std model , however , expects higher agb luminosity contribution than any other models at log(age ) @xmath1 8.0 as mentioned above . in the case of ssps",
    "older than 1 gyr , the agb luminosity contribution decreases in all models , but the maraston model shows the steepest decrease .",
    "the bright cluster sequence represents well - populated systems that are less influenced by the stochastic fluctuation than faint star clusters , so that it is more appropriate to compare with the expectation of ssp models . in figure",
    "[ fig : main2 ] , we notice two points with regard to the comparison between the bright cluster sequence and the model expectation : ( 1 ) the maximum value of the bright cluster sequence and ( 2 ) the age range corresponding to the maximum agb luminosity contribution . first , the peak value of the agb luminosity contribution for bright clusters is up to 0.7  0.8 .",
    "only two models , maraston and padova10 models , reproduce this maximum value .",
    "second , the peak position for the bright cluster sequence appears at log(age ) = 8.5  8.7 , which is slightly younger than for model predictions ( log(age ) = 8.6  8.8 ) .",
    "however , this discrepancy is not significant because the errors of ages are around 0.1 .",
    "the calibration of the eps models influences galaxy studies because the determination of physical parameters of galaxies depends on the amount of the agb near - infrared luminosity contribution in eps models .",
    "the difference between the agb luminosity fractions expected by padova02 and maraston models is largest at log(age ) @xmath1 8.7  8.9 ( age @xmath1 0.5  0.8 gyr ) , as shown figure 13 .",
    "this indicates that the differences of galaxy mass estimates based on the eps models can be significant at this age range . this can be important for galaxies with young stellar ages , such as high - redshift ( @xmath78 2  3 ) or post - starburst galaxies . in these kinds of galaxies ,",
    "the young stellar component with ages @xmath1 1 gyr is dominant .",
    "for example , @xcite presented sed fitting results of 79 early - type galaxies at @xmath79 1.3 , finding the differences in stellar ages and masses of galaxies estimated with the bc03 and maraston models , respectively .",
    "they showed that the masses of galaxies derived with the maraston model tend to be lower than those estimated with the bc03 model , and this discrepancy is prominent ( by a factor of two ) at galaxy ages @xmath1 1.0  1.3 gyr with uncertainty of @xmath1 1.0  1.5 gyr ( see figure 5 in @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite reported how the galaxy evolution process depends on eps models .",
    "they investigated the size and mass growth of high - redshift galaxies ( @xmath79 2.3 ) . from the galaxy mass differences based on the eps models",
    ", they found that the galaxy size growth from @xmath79 2.3 to @xmath80 0 is faster in the case of the bc03 model than the case of the maraston model , assuming that the mass growth rate is same in these two cases .",
    "thus , the size - mass relation of galaxies can be influenced by the agb luminosity contribution in each eps model .",
    "our results of the bright cluster sequence are closer to the maraston model so that they support the size - mass relation of galaxies derived with this model .",
    "we investigated the @xmath0 band luminosity evolution of the agb population in ssps using 102 lmc star clusters .",
    "first , we determined ages and foreground reddening of star clusters from the @xmath81 photometry in the mcps @xcite using padova isochrones @xcite",
    ". then agb stars in each cluster were selected using 2mass @xmath82 cmds .",
    "we derived the @xmath0 band luminosity fraction of agb stars in 102 star clusters as a function of ages .",
    "the @xmath0 band luminosity fraction of agb stars in star clusters increases as age increases from log(age ) @xmath1 8.0 .",
    "it reaches a maximum up to @xmath1 0.6 for mean values and @xmath1 0.8 for bright cluster sequences at log(age ) @xmath1 8.5 , and decreases afterwards .",
    "the agb luminosity fraction for given ages shows a large scatter caused by stochastic effects .",
    "we compared our results with five ssp models : padova02 , padova10 , maraston , basti_std , and basti_os models .",
    "it is found that the only two models ( padova10 and maraston models ) match approximately the observational @xmath0 band agb luminosity contribution of bright star clusters derived in this study , while other models predict the agb luminosity contribution much lower .",
