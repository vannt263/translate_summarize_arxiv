    "low dimensional spin systems have attracted a great deal of interest over the last years because , both , theoretical and experimental reasons . in fact , from the experimental point of view , there are actually many quasi one dimensional compounds such as the organic series @xmath0 with @xmath1 , the cuprate @xmath2 or the @xmath3 compounds , as well as other series as the @xmath4 with @xmath5 or @xmath6 , which can be well described as spin - peierls chains @xcite . furthermore , we have now the evidence that the two dimensional antiferromagnetism is one of the crucial components of the high temperature superconductivity @xcite , and we have also heisenberg spin - ladder compounds which can be viewed as intermediaries between one and two dimensions , and also as between half - integer @xmath7 and integer @xmath8 spin chains .    from the theoretical side ,",
    "these systems are interesting since their low dimensionality makes that their properties are strongly affected by quantum fluctuations and also because of its apparent simplicity .",
    "for example , low dimensional electronic materials are known to be very sensitive to structural distortions driven by the electron - phonon interactions which breaks the symmetry of the original ( i.e. without electron - phonon interaction ) ground state , resulting in a less symmetric but lower energy state , in which the electrons and ions are shifted , from their symmetric positions , in a regular manner that creates a periodic variation of the charge density called charge density wave .",
    "this is the famous peierls instability which opens a gap at the fermi surface of the one - dimensional electronic chain , transforming what would be a metal ( in absence of electron - phonon interactions ) in a semiconductor .",
    "a similar effect is expected for one dimensional spin chains which are unstable against a dimerized spin - singlet ground state .",
    "one of the most widely used model for spin interactions is the generalized one dimensional heisenberg hamiltonian which can be written , in terms of the quantum spin operators @xmath9 ( where @xmath10 are the pauli matrices at the site @xmath11 ) , as @xmath12 and that , after some transformations , can be seen also as a one dimensional hubbard model for electronic interactions .",
    "the case when the coupling @xmath13 between nearest spins is taken as a constant is exactly soluble after bethe and his celebrated bethe ansatz @xcite .",
    "later it was solved again by applying the quantum inverse scattering methods , with which this model results inside of a family of solvable models @xcite .",
    "however the heisenberg model must be seen only as a first approximation to the real interactions , as long as a constant coupling between nearest - neighbors implies that the atoms are taken at fixed positions .",
    "if we account for the vibrations of the atoms , then the coupling between two nearest spins is proportional to the exchange integral and then it can be written , up to first order , as @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are constants and @xmath17 is the displacement of the nth atom from its equilibrium position . in the born - oppenheimer approximation , @xmath18 ( adiabatic limit ) the hamiltonian ( [ heis ] )",
    "can be written as @xmath19 with @xmath20 .",
    "the pauli matrices @xmath21 act on the two - dimensional space @xmath22 whereas @xmath23 acts on the @xmath24-dimensional hilbert space , @xmath25 which is the tensor product of @xmath26 two - dimensional @xmath27 spaces .",
    "we use periodic boundary conditions on the lattice with @xmath28 even playing the role of the length of the chain .",
    "the total third component of the spin , @xmath29 is a conserved magnitude that we shall use to describe the states of the system . in general , to find the exact spectrum of the hamiltonian ( [ hp ] ) is a difficult task and several methods like bosonization @xcite and variational @xcite have been applied and actually for @xmath30 , case of weak dimerization , the low energy region is believed to be equivalent to that of the gaussian model @xcite . in this paper",
    "we want to find the low spin excitations over the state where all @xmath26 spins are aligned and pointing in the @xmath31 direction ( note that the particular direction in which the spins are aligned is not relevant due to the rotational invariance of the hamiltonian ) .",
    "to do this we shall fermionize the problem with the jordan - wigner transformation and use a method analogous to that of the richardson s solution @xcite of the bcs model of superconductivity .",
    "as said above , our starting point will be an eigenstate of @xmath23 with all spins aligned in the @xmath31 direction so that it is also an eigenstate of @xmath32 with eigenvalue @xmath33 ; starting from it , we want to find the eigenstates of the hamiltonian that have one spin flipped in the @xmath34 direction and we call them the one - particle states . the first task is to transform the hamiltonian ( [ hp ] ) in a fermionic hamiltonian by means of the jordan - wigner transformation since , although this is not strictly necessary for these one - particle states , it will be need for the two - particle states , so we start by defining the fermionic operators : @xmath35 being @xmath36 and @xmath37    these operators are true fermionic operators in the sense that @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath40 the total third component of the states is , up to a constant factor , the number operator @xmath41 , and we can identify the states with @xmath42 spins flipped with those states that have @xmath42 particles of type @xmath43 ; furthermore , the total number of fermions is also a conserved quantity . transforming from the @xmath44 to the @xmath43 operators",
    ", the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath45 being @xmath46 and @xmath47 . due to the last term",
    ", the hamiltonian reads different depending on the number of particles that has the state on which @xmath23 acts .",
    "howewer , considering separately the subspaces of even and odd total number of fermions , we may write @xmath23 in a simple universal way , that is @xmath48 where @xmath49 then , acting on states that have an even number of fermions the hamiltonian ( [ vii ] ) has antiperiodic boundary conditions , whereas the boundary conditions are periodic when @xmath23 acts on states with an odd number of fermions . trasforming to momentum space with the fourier transformation given by @xmath50 where    @xmath51 and @xmath52 means the number of fermions of the subspace on which @xmath23 acts ; then the operators @xmath53 and @xmath54 create or destroy , respectively , a fermion of momentum @xmath55 . with these transformations ,",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ vii ] ) in the momentum space is composed of four pieces , plus the identity times @xmath56 , @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59    the space of states will be generated now by a vacuum @xmath60 with zero excitations , over which act the operators @xmath61 and @xmath62 that create and destroy excitations that we call particles with momentum @xmath63 ; those states are described by kets of the form @xmath64 that represents a state of @xmath52 particles with momentums @xmath65 , @xmath66 . obviously , the total number of particles is conserved by every piece of the hamiltonian and then we can calculated the energy of the eigenstates with a given number of particles .",
    "the spectrum of energies in the one particle subspace can be obtained easily due to the fact that @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the only pieces that gives a non null contribution . acting with @xmath23 on the states",
    "@xmath69 and @xmath70 , we have @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "then we see that the two dimensional subspace generated by the states @xmath73 and @xmath74 is invariant under the action of @xmath23 and consecuently the eigenvalues of @xmath75 are those of the matrix , @xmath76 and the total energies will be these eigenvalues plus @xmath77 , i.e. , @xmath78 where now @xmath79 as corresponds to the subspace with one particle .",
    "the corresponding eigenvectors are those of the matrix ( [ xv ] ) @xmath80 where @xmath81^{1/2}$ ] and @xmath82^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "in this case , the pieces of the hamiltonian @xmath83 and @xmath84 acting on the states are not zero and it does more difficult to find the solution .",
    "the states are described by the kets of the form @xmath85 with , @xmath86 .",
    "we can observe that they are eigenstates of @xmath67 and that the action of @xmath83 on them gives new states @xmath87 , in both cases they fulfill the condition @xmath88 .",
    "in the same form , the parts @xmath68 and @xmath84 mix the states @xmath85 with states @xmath87 being @xmath89 . in other words ,",
    "@xmath67 and @xmath83 conserve the total momentum whereas @xmath68 and @xmath84 change the total momentum by an amount of @xmath90 .",
    "then , the subspace generated by states of the form @xmath91 is invariant by the hamiltonian , and we can reduce to this subspace the problem of finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath23 . note that in equations ( [ xviii1]-[xviii ] ) the functions @xmath92 and @xmath93 are antisymmetric in their arguments , that is @xmath94 and @xmath95 , in the same way as they are the fermionic states @xmath96 .",
    "let us begin with the case @xmath97 .",
    "then the total hamiltonian has only the alternating term so the equations are simpler and we can see beter the method . working in units of @xmath98 ( or @xmath99 ) and taking @xmath100 and demanding that @xmath101 we obtain that @xmath102=\\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad   \\nonumber   \\\\ 8\\left\\ { 2b(m ) \\sin\\left[k(l - m/2)\\right]+ { 1\\over 2}\\sin\\left[k(l)\\right ] \\left ( h(l - m/2,m - l )",

    "now we return to the general case when @xmath15 and @xmath98 are @xmath121 .",
    "the action of the different parts of the hamiltonian on the states ( [ xviii1 ] - [ xviii ] ) is given by , @xmath122 being now @xmath123 and @xmath124        equating the coefficients of every state in the first member and in the second member , we can observe that the relations between them mix only the @xmath126 , @xmath127 and @xmath128 terms , besides of the functions @xmath104 and @xmath105 that depends of all coefficients .",
    "this relations are expressed as the system of linear equations , @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the matrix @xmath131 with @xmath132    from the equations ( [ xxiii ] ) , we can get the solutions of @xmath133 and @xmath134 by making use of the inverse matrix of @xmath135 .",

    "it can happen that some of this factors will be common to all numerators of the functions @xmath107 and @xmath108 involved in the same set of equations ( [ xxiii ] ) .",
    "then , the corresponding eigenvalue @xmath154 of @xmath156 will be also eigenvalue of the total hamiltonian , i.e. , solution of ( [ xxviii ] ) . due to that",
