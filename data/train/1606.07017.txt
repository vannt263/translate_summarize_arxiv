    "chaotic dynamics makes it difficult to give a geometric description of an attractor in many situations , when probabilistic and ergodic analysis becomes relevant . in a long record of a chaotic signal generated by a deterministic time evolution , for suitable initial conditions the expected time average exists",
    " see @xcite",
    ". however , there are cases where the time averages do not converge no matter how long we wait .",
    "this _ historic behaviour _ is associated with intermittent dynamics , which happens typically near heteroclinic networks .",
    "the aim of this article is to explore the persistence of this behaviour for a deterministic class of systems involving robust heteroclinic cycles , leading to an answer to taken s last problem @xcite .",
    "more precisely , we study non - hyperbolic heteroclinic attractors such that the time averages of all solutions within their basin of attraction do not converge , and for which this holds persistently .    this is done by first studying a one - parameter family of vector fields having periodic solutions connected in a robust cycle .",
    "we show that under generic conditions there are parameter values for which the invariant manifolds of a pair of periodic solutions have a heteroclinic tangency .",
    "this implies the newhouse property of existence of infinitely many sinks .",
    "results by kiriki and soma @xcite may then be used to provide an affirmative answer to the problem proposed by takens in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath2 be a compact three - dimensional manifold without boundary and consider a vector field @xmath3 defining a differential equation @xmath4 and denote by @xmath5 , with @xmath6 , the associated flow with initial condition @xmath7 .",
    "the following terminology has been introduced by ruelle @xcite ( see also sigmund @xcite ) .",
    "[ historicdef ] we say that the solution @xmath5 , @xmath7 , of has _ historic behaviour _ if there is a continuous function @xmath8 such that the time average @xmath9 fails to converge .",
    "a solution @xmath5 , @xmath7 with historic behaviour retains informations about its past .",
    "this happens , in particular , if there are at least two different sequences of times , say @xmath10 and @xmath11 , such that the following limits exist and are different : @xmath12    the consideration of the limit behaviour of time averages with respect to a given measure has been studied since sinai @xcite , ruelle @xcite and bowen @xcite .",
    "usually , historic behaviour is seen as an anomaly .",
    "whether there is a justification for this belief is the content of takens last problem @xcite : _ are there persistent classes of smooth dynamical systems such that the set of initial conditions which give rise to orbits with historic behaviour has positive lebesgue measure ? _ in ergodic terms , this problem is equivalent to finding a persistent class of systems admitting no physical measures @xcite , since roughly speaking , these measures are those that give probabilistic information on the observable asymptotic behaviour of trajectories",
    ".    the class may become persistent if one considers differential equations in manifolds with boundary as in population dynamics @xcite .",
    "the same happens for equivariant or reversible differential equations @xcite .",
    "the question remained open for systems without such properties until , recently , kiriki and soma @xcite proved that any newhouse open set in the @xmath13-topology , @xmath14 , of two - dimensional diffeomorphisms is contained in the closure of the set of diffeomorphisms which have non - trivial wandering domains whose forward orbits have historic behaviour .",
    "as far as we know , the original problem , stated for flows , has remained open until now .      in this section ,",
    "we present some non - generic examples that , however , occur generically in families of discrete dynamical systems depending on a small number of parameters .",
    "the first example has been given in hofbauer and keller @xcite , where it has been shown that the logistic family contains elements for which almost all orbits have historic behaviour .",
    "this example has codimension one in the space of @xmath15 endomorphisms of the interval ; the @xmath15 regularity is due to the use of the schwarzian derivative operator .",
    "the second example is due to bowen , who described a codimension two system of differential equations on the plane whose flow has a heteroclinic cycle consisting of a pair of saddle - equilibria connected by two trajectories . as referred by takens @xcite , apparently bowen never published this result .",
    "we give an explicit example in [ subsecbowen ] below .",
    "the eigenvalues of the derivative of the vector field at the two saddles are such that the cycle attracts solutions that start inside it . in this case",
    ", each solution in the domain has historic behaviour . in ergodic terms",
    ", it is an example without srb measures .",
    "breaking the cycle by a small perturbation , the equation loses this property .",
    "this type of dynamics may become persistent for dynamical systems in manifolds with boundary or in the presence of symmetry .",
    "we use bowen s example here as a first step in the construction of a generic example .",
    "other examples of high codimension with heteroclinic attractors where lebesgue almost all trajectories fail to converge have been given by gaunersdorfer @xcite and sigmund @xcite .",
    "ergodicity implies the convergence of time averages along almost all trajectories for all continuous observables @xcite . for non - ergodic systems",
    ", time averages may not exist for almost all trajectories .",
    "in karabacak and ashwin ( * ? ? ?",
    "* th 4.2 ) , the authors characterise conditions on the observables that imply convergent time averages for almost all trajectories . this convergence is determined by the behaviour of the observable on the statistical attractors ( subsets where trajectories spend almost all time ) .",
    "details in @xcite .",
    "the paradigmatic example with persistent historic behaviour has been suggested by colli and vargas in @xcite , in which the authors presented a simple non - hyperbolic model with a wandering domain characterised by the existence of a two - dimensional diffeomorphism with a smale horseshoe whose stable and unstable manifolds have persistent tangencies under arbitrarily small @xmath0 perturbations .",
    "the authors of @xcite suggest that this would entail the existence of non - wandering domains with historic behaviour , in a robust way .",
    "this example has been carefully described in @xcite .    for diffeomorphisms ,",
    "an answer has been given by kiriki and soma @xcite , where the authors used ideas suggested in @xcite to find a nontrivial non - wandering domain ( the interior of a specific rectangle ) where the diffeomorphism is contracting . in a robust way",
    ", they obtain an open set of initial conditions for which the time averages do not converge . basically , the authors linked two subjects : homoclinic tangencies studied by newhouse , palis and takens and non - empty non - wandering domains exhibiting historic behaviour .",
    "an overview of the proof has been given in  2 of @xcite .",
    "we refer those that are unfamiliar with newhouse regions to the book @xcite .",
    "the goal of this article is twofold .",
    "first , we extend the results by takens @xcite and by gaunersdorfer @xcite to heteroclinic cycles involving periodic solutions with real floquet multipliers .",
    "the first main result is theorem  [ main1 ] , with precise hypotheses given in section [ hypotheses ] :    1@xmath16 result : : :    consider an ordinary differential equation in    @xmath17 having an attracting heteroclinic cycle    involving periodic solutions with two - dimensional heteroclinic    connections .",
    "any neighbourhood of this cycle contains an open set of    initial conditions , for which the time averages of the corresponding    solutions accumulate on the boundary of a polygon , and thus , fail to    converge .",
    "the open set is contained in the basin of attraction of the    cycle and the observable is the projection on a component .",
    "this situation has high codimension because each heteroclinic connection raises the codimension by one , but this class of systems is persistent in equivariant differential equations .",
    "the presence of symmetry creates flow - invariant fixed - point subspaces in which heteroclinic connections lie  see for example the example constructed in @xcite .",
    "another example is constructed in section  [ seclifting ] below .",
    "the second main result , theorem  [ teorema tangency ] , concerns tangencies :    2@xmath18 result : : :    consider a generic one - parameter family of structurally stable    differential equations in the unfolding of an equation for which the    1@xmath19 result holds .",
    "then there is a    sequence of parameter values for which there is a heteroclinic    tangency of the invariant manifolds of two periodic solutions .",
    "we use this result to obtain theorem  [ teoremahistoric ] :    3@xmath20 result : : :    consider a generic one - parameter family of structurally stable    differential equations in the unfolding of an equation for which the    1@xmath19 result holds .",
    "therefore , for    parameter values in an open interval , there are vector fields    arbitrarily @xmath0-close to an element of the family , for    which there is an open set of initial conditions exhibiting historic    behaviour .",
    "in other words , we obtain a class , dense in a @xmath0-open set of differential equations and elements of this class exhibit historic behaviour for an open set of initial conditions , which may be interpreted as the condition required in takens last problem .",
    "the idea behind the proof goes back to the works of @xcite , combined with the recent progress on the field made by @xcite .",
    "the proof consists of the followingsteps :    1 .",
    "use the 3@xmath20 result to establish the existence of intervals in the parameters corresponding to newhouse domains ; 2 .",
    "[ item1 ] in a given cross section , construct a diffeomorphim ( @xmath0-close to the first return map ) having historic behaviour for an open set of initial conditions ; 3 .",
    "[ item2 ] transfer the historic behaviour from the perturbed diffeomorphism of _ [ item1 ] .",
    "_ to a flow @xmath0-close to the original one .    furthermore ,",
    "in the spirit of the example by bowen described in @xcite , we obtain :    4@xmath21 result : : :    we construct explicitly a class of systems for which historic    behaviour arises @xmath0-close to the unfolding of a fully    symmetric vector field , we may find an open set of initial conditions    with historic behaviour .",
    "in contrast to the findings of bowen and    kleptsyn @xcite , our example is robust due the hyperbolicity of the    periodic solutions and the transversality of the local heteroclinic    connections .",
    "the results in this article are stated for vector fields in @xmath17 , but they hold for vector fields in a three - dimensional riemannian manifold and , with some adaptation , in higher dimensions .",
    "concerning the first result , the outstanding fact in the degenerate case is that the time averages diverge precisely in the same way : they approach a @xmath22-polygon .",
    "this is in contrast with ergodic and hyperbolic strange attractors admitting a physical measure , where almost all initial conditions lead to converging time averages , in spite of the fact that the observed dynamics may undergo huge variations .    if a flow @xmath23 admits an invariant probability measure @xmath24 that is absolutely continuous with respect to the lebesgue measure and ergodic , then @xmath24 is a physical measure for @xmath23 , as a simple consequence of the birkhoff ergodic theorem . in other words",
    "if @xmath25 is a @xmath24-integrable function , then for @xmath24-almost all points in @xmath2 the time average : @xmath26 exists and equals the space average @xmath27 . in the conservative context",
    ", historic behaviour has zero lebesgue measure .",
    "physical measures need not be unique or even exist in general . when they exist , it is desirable that the set of points whose asymptotic time averages are described by physical measures be of full lebesgue measure .",
    "it is unknown in how much generality do the basins of physical measures cover a subset of @xmath2 of full lesbegue measure .",
    "there are examples of systems admitting no physical measure but the only known cases are not robust , _ ie _ , there are systems arbitrarily close ( in the @xmath0 whitney topology ) that admit physical measures . in the present article ,",
    "we exhibit a persistent class of smooth dynamical systems that does not have global physical measures . in the unfolding of an equation for which the first result holds ,",
    "there are no physical measures whose basins intersect the basin of attraction of an attracting heteroclinic cycle .",
    "our example confirms that physical measures need not exist for all vector fields .",
    "existence results are usually difficult and are known only for certain classes of systems .",
    "generalised lotka - volterra systems has been analysed by duarte _",
    "et al _ in @xcite .",
    "results about the convergence of time averages are known in two cases : either if there exists a unique interior equilibrium point , or in the conservative setting ( see @xcite ) , when there is a heteroclinic cycle . in the latter case ,",
    "if the solution remains limited and does not converge to the cycle , then its time averages converge to an equilibrium point .",
    "the requirement is that the heteroclinic cycle is stable but not attracting , and the limit dynamics has been extended to polymatrix replicators in @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to our findings in the degenerate case , emphasising the importance of the hypothesis that the cycle is attracting in order to obtain convergence to a polygon .",
    "preliminary definitions are the subject of section  [ preliminaries ] and the main hypotheses are stated in section  [ hypotheses ] .",
    "we introduce the notation for the rest of the article in section  [ local ] after a linearisation of the vector field around each periodic solution , whose details are given in appendix  [ appendix ] .",
    "we use precise control of the times of flight between cross - sections in section  [ organizing ] , to show that for an open set of initial conditions in a neighbourhood of asymptotically stable heteroclinic cycles involving non - trivial periodic solutions , the time averages fail to converge .",
    "instead , the time averages accumulate on the boundary of a polygon , whose vertices may be computed from local information on the periodic solutions in the cycle .",
    "the proofs of some technical lemmas containing the computations about the control of the flight time between nodes appear in appendix [ appendixb ] , to make for easier reading .    in section  [ tangencies ]",
    ", we obtain a persistent class of smooth dynamical systems such that an open set of initial conditions corresponds to trajectories with historic behaviour .",
    "symmetry - breaking techniques are used to obtain a heteroclinic cycle associated to two periodic solutions and we find heteroclinic tangencies and newhouse phenomena near which the result of @xcite may be applied .",
    "this is followed in section [ example ] by an explicit example where historic behaviour arise in the unfolding of an @xmath1-equivariant vector field .",
    "to make the paper self - contained and readable , we recall some definitions .      several definitions of heteroclinic cycles and networks have been given in the literature .",
    "in this paper we consider non - trivial periodic solutions of ( [ general ] ) that are hyperbolic and that have one floquet multiplier with absolute value greater than 1 and one floquet multiplier with absolute value less than 1",
