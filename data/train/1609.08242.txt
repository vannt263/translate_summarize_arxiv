    "black holes have been used as the laboratory of many kinds of theories , specially the thermodynamics of black holes plays an important roles .",
    "it has been found that a black hole possesses not only standard thermodynamic quantities but abundant phase structures and critical phenomena , such as those involved in the hawking - page phase transition , similar to the ones of a general thermodynamic system .",
    "even more interesting is that the studies on the charged black holes show they may have an analogous phase transition with that of van der walls - maxwell s liquid - gas . in recent years",
    ", the cosmological constant in @xmath3-dimensional ads and ds spacetime has been regarded as pressure of black hole thermodynamic system with @xmath4 and the corresponding conjugate quantity , thermodynamic volume @xmath5 the @xmath6 critical behaviors in ads and ds black holes have been extensively studied@xcite .",
    "a completely simulated gas - liquid system has been put forward .    using ehrenfest scheme ,",
    "ref.@xcite studied the critical phenomena in a series of black holes in ads spacetime , and proved the phase transition at critical point is the second order one , which has also been confirmed in ref.@xcite by studying thermodynamics and state space geometry of black holes . although some encouraging results about black hole thermodynamic properties in ads and ds spacetimes have been achieved and the problems about phase transition of black holes have been extensively discussed , an unified recognition about the phase transition of black hole has not been put forward .",
    "it is significant to further explore phase equilibrium and phase structure in black holes , which can help to recognize the evolution of black holes .",
    "we also expect to provide some relevant information for exploring quantum gravity properties by studying the phase transition of charged topological dilaton ads black holes .",
    "the motivation for studying higher dimensional black holes comes from developments in string / m - theory , which is believed to be the most consistent approach to quantum theory of gravity .",
    "it was argued that black holes may play a crucial role in the analysis of dynamics in higher dimensions as well as in the compactification mechanisms . in particular , to test novel predictions of string / m - theory black holes may serve as good theoretical laboratories .",
    "it has been thought that the statistical - mechanical calculation of the bekenstein - hawking entropy for a class of supersymmetric black holes in five dimensions is one of the remarkable results in string theory  @xcite .",
    "another motivation on studying higher dimensional black holes originates from the braneworld scenarios , as a new fundamental scale of quantum gravity .",
    "an interesting consequence of these models is the possibility of mini black hole production at future colliders  @xcite .",
    "the theory of nonlinear electrodynamics was first introduced in 1930 s by born and infeld to obtain a classical theory of charged particles with finite self - energy  @xcite .",
    "born - infeld(bi ) theory has received renewed attentions since it turns out to play an important role in string theory .",
    "the bi action , including a dilaton and an axion field , appears in the coupling of an open superstring and an abelian gauge field thory  @xcite .",
    "here we would like to consider another type of nonlinear electrodynamics , namely , the exponential form of the nonlinear electrodynamics in the setup of dilaton gravity .",
    "these serve as our main motivation to explore the effects of dilaton field on the properties of higher dimensional charged black holes with a nonlinear source .",
    "the isotherms in @xmath7 diagrams of charged topological dilaton ads black hole in ref.@xcite show there exists thermodynamic unstable region with @xmath8 when temperature is below critical temperature and the negative pressure emerges when temperature is below a certain value .",
    "this situation also exists in van der waals - maxwell gas - liquid system , which has been resolved by maxwell equal area law . in this paper , using the maxwell equal area law , we establish a phase transition process in charged topological dilaton ads black holes , where the issues about unstable states and negative pressure are resolved . by studying the phase transition process , we acquire the two - phase equilibrium properties including the @xmath1 phase diagram , clapeyron equation and latent heat of phase change .",
    "the results show the phase transition below critical temperature is of the first order but phase transition at critical point belongs to the continuous one .",
    "outline of this paper is as follows : the higher dimensional charged topological dilaton ads black hole as a thermodynamic system is briefly introduced in section 2 . in section 3 , by maxwell equal area law the phase transition processes at certain temperatures are obtained and the boundary of two phase equilibrium region are depicted in @xmath0 diagram for a higher dimensional charged topological dilaton ads black hole .",
    "then some parameters of the black hole are analyzed to find the relevance with the two - phase equilibrium . in section 4 ,",
    "the @xmath1 phase diagrams are plotted and the clapeyron equation and latent heat of the phase change are derived .",
    "we make some discussions and conclusions in section 5 .",
    "we use the units @xmath9 in this paper )",
    "we consider the @xmath3-dimensional@xmath10 action in which gravity is coupled to dilaton and nonlinear electrodynamic field .",
    "the einstein - maxwell - dilaton(emd ) action in @xmath11-dimensional @xmath12 spacetime is@xcite @xmath13 where the dilaton potential contains two liuville terms : @xmath14 and @xmath15\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the ricci scalar curvature , @xmath17 is the dilaton field and @xmath18 is a potential for @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are constants,@xmath24 is a constant determining the strength of coupling of the scalar and electromagnetic field .",
    "this kind of potential was previously investigated in the context of bi - dilaton ( bid ) black holes  @xcite as well as emd gravity  @xcite .",

    "this universal law applies to almost all kinds of black holes , including dilaton black holes , in einstein gravity  @xcite .",
    "it is easy to show @xmath58 recent development on the thermodynamics of black holes in extended phase space shows that the cosmological constant can be interpreted as the thermodynamic pressure and treated as a thermodynamic variable in its own right , @xmath59 one may then regard the parameters @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 as a complete set of parameters for the mass @xmath63 and define the parameters conjugate to @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",

    "the higher - dimensional charged topological dilaton ads black hole with a non - linear source is regarded as a thermodynamic system , and its state equation has been derived .",
    "but when temperature is below critical temperature , thermodynamic unstable situation appears on isotherms , and when temperature reduces to a certain value the negative pressure emerges , which can be seen in fig.1 and fig.2 .",
    "however , by maxwell equal law we established an phase transition process and the problems can be resolved .",
    "the phase transition process at a defined temperature happens at a constant pressure , where the system specific volume changes along with the ratio of the two coexistent phases .",
    "according to ehrenfest scheme the phase transition belongs to the first order one .",
    "we draw the isothermal phase transition process and depict the boundary of two - phase coexistence region in fig.2 .",
    "appropriate theoretical interpretation to the phase structure of the ads black hole thermodynamic system can help to know more about black hole thermodynamic properties , such as entropy , temperature , heat capacity and so on , of black hole and that is significant for improving self - consistent thermodynamic theory of black holes .",
    "the clapeyron equation of usual thermodynamic system agrees well with experiment result . in this paper",
    "we have plotted the two - phase equilibrium curves in @xmath1 diagrams , derived the slope of the curves , and acquired information on latent heat of phase change by clapeyron equation , which could create condition for finding some usual thermodynamic systems similar to black holes in thermodynamic properties and provide theoretical basis for experimental research on analogous black holes .",
