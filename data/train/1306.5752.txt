    "the observed properties of the large scale structure in our universe are well described by a @xmath16cdm cosmological model @xcite . within this model",
    "the formation of structure progresses in a hierarchical fashion , culminating with the formation of clusters of galaxies .",
    "hierarchical cluster growth occurs via several modes with varying degrees of impact on the state of the cluster , from the benign continuous infall of material from the surrounding filaments , to the high impact merger of two approximately equal mass clusters .",
    "simulations indicate that a significant fraction of both the mass and galaxies in massive ( @xmath17@xmath10 ) clusters at the current epoch have been accreted through minor and major cluster mergers ( @xmath18 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , it is important that we understand the impact of this process on the cluster constituents and , in particular , how this violent environment affects the resident galaxies .",
    "initial indications that cluster mergers may affect the star formation in the resident galaxies came from observations of the coma cluster , where @xcite discovered an excess of rapidly - evolving post - starburst galaxies coincident with a merging subgroup to the southwest of the cluster core . further investigation by @xcite revealed that galaxies with evidence for recently truncated episodes of starburst activity were co - spatial with intra - cluster medium ( icm ) substructures associated with the dynamical evolution of the cluster .",
    "this indicates that an interaction with the dynamically evolving icm may be responsible for the triggering and/or truncation of star formation in these galaxies .",
    "simulations support this conclusion and show that it is possible that the high icm pressure a galaxy experiences during the core - passage phase of a merger can trigger star formation @xcite while the high relative velocity of icm and galaxies can enhance ram pressure stripping of the interstellar medium , leading to a sharp truncation of star formation @xcite .",
    "observations at optical and radio wavelengths of several other merging clusters support this scenario @xcite . since the timescales for the radio and star forming phases of galaxies ( @xmath19myr ) are shorter than typical merger timescales ( @xmath20gyrs ) , a detailed understanding of the dynamics and merger stage of the cluster are crucial when attempting to interpret the observed galaxy populations .    the combination of multi - object spectroscopy with x - ray spectro - imagery has proven a powerful tool in understanding cluster mergers @xcite .",
    "the multi - object spectroscopy allows efficient collection of large , highly complete , samples of spectroscopically confirmed cluster member galaxies .",
    "these member galaxies act as excellent kinematic probes that can be used to first identify merger related substructures , and then to determine substructure characteristics .",
    "these are important for constraining merger configurations , such as velocity dispersion and the line of sight velocity with respect to the parent cluster .",
    "high fidelity x - ray data , such as that provided by the _ chandra _ and xmm - newton satellites , maps the distribution and thermodynamic properties of the icm .",
    "the collisional nature of the icm means that it provides a number of morphological and thermodynamic signatures of merger activity such as shocks @xcite and cold fronts @xcite .",
    "these signatures are extremely useful in inferring the direction of motion of structures @xcite , the merger velocity perpendicular to our line of sight @xcite , and also for understanding if a merger is observed at pre- or post - pericentric passage .",
    "the complementary nature of these two probes of cluster mergers allows tight constraints to be placed on merger configurations and histories , allowing a more complete understanding of the merger process and the identification of regions which are currently , or have recently been , affected by the cluster merger .    in this paper",
    "we present a detailed analysis of the cluster abell  1882 ( hereafter a1882 ) utilizing the highly complete gama spectroscopic data along with archival _ chandra _  and xmm data .",
    "a1882 is the richest cluster in the gama group catalog @xcite where it was allocated 264 members , median redshift z=0.1394 and velocity dispersion @xmath21@xmath2 .",
    "it is an abell richness class 3 @xcite and was included in the @xcite multiwavelength study of rich abell clusters where an x - ray luminosity @xmath22 erg@xmath23 was measured .",
    "a1882 was notable in this study as having the highest fraction of blue galaxies , @xmath24 .",
    "the isopleth maps presented there showed a complex multi - modal distribution in galaxy surface density , while the x - ray images revealed multiple peaks in the icm distribution , indicating that a1882 is not a relaxed system and may be undergoing a merger",
    ". however , these substructures may simply be due to fore- and background structures aligned along the line of sight that are not physically associated with a1882 .",
    "moreover , the low resolution x - ray images used in @xcite are prone to point - source contamination while the projection - effect - prone isopleth maps give little information on the details of the merger .",
    "these merger details are necessary to understand the impact of cluster mergers on the member galaxies and can not be achieved by shallow , large - area surveys which do not obtain high spectroscopic completeness in dense environments .",
    "the aim of this paper is to answer two questions : ( i ) what is the dynamical state of a1882 ; is it in a pre- or post core passage merger phase ? and ( ii ) what is the nature of the apparently high blue fraction within a1882 and is it anomalous ? the first question is addressed by using a sample of spectroscopically confirmed cluster members selected from the gama survey , along with archival _ chandra _  and xmm data , to detect and characterize substructure .",
    "the high spectroscopic completeness ( @xmath25 even in dense cluster environments ) and depth ( @xmath26 ) of the gama survey is crucial to allow the robust identification and characterization of dynamical substructure , which is usually only attainable through pointed observations . to address the second question",
    ", we make use of the gama group catalog @xcite to select a benchmark sample of mass- and redshift - matched clusters for comparing blue fractions",
    ". this study forms part of a larger body of work aimed at understanding the impact of hierarchical structure formation on cluster galaxies .",
    "in previous studies , we have provided detailed pictures of the merger states of several clusters ranging from post - core passage major mergers @xcite to minor mergers first identified by the existence of cold fronts @xcite . in a forthcoming paper",
    ", we will compare the galaxy properties across the spectrum of cluster dynamical states in order to asses the effect of the merger induced rapidly changing environment .    in section  [ data ]",

    "we use archival x - ray observations of abell  1882 taken with xmm - newton using the european photon imaging camera ( epic ) in february 2003 ( obsid 0145480101 ) and with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) onboard _ chandra _  in march ,",

    "roughly @xmath45 of the mos observations were rejected due to flare contamination leaving a cleaned exposure times of 11.0ks and 11.6ks for mos1 and mos2 , respectively .",
    "the pn data were severely affected by flares , with roughly 70 percent rejected as being contaminated by flares , leaving 6.9ks of clean exposure .     for the xmm imaging analysis , we make use of blank sky and filter wheel closed ( fwc ) observations produced by the epic background team and tailored to the observations @xcite . these datasets are filtered to exclude periods of high background evident in the 1012kev and 27kev band light curves .",
    "we use the imagbgsub software to produce background corrected images using a double background subtraction procedure .",
    "briefly , this method uses the fwc observations to subtract the instrumental background from both the blank sky observations and a source free region in the observations leaving only the cosmic x - ray background . due to differences in sky pointings between the observations and blank sky datasets ,",
    "there are small differences in the soft x - ray background flux .",
    "this is accounted for by comparing the cosmic x - ray background flux in the blank sky with that in a source - free region in the observations .",
    "the comparison is made in four energy bands in the 0.52.5kev range with the differences used to make vignetting - corrected `` soft excess '' images .",
    "these soft - excess images are combined with instrumental and cosmic x - ray background images to produce a total background which is subtracted from the observations .",

    "light curves were extracted from source - free regions and examined for periods of high backgrounds due to flares .",
    "no significant flares were detected and the cleaned exposure times for the pointings are listed in table  [ xray_obs ] .",
    "for both imaging and spectral analyses , we use the period e blank sky observations .",
    "the blank sky files were processed in the same manner as the observations and reprojected onto the sky to match the observations . for imaging and spectral analysis ,",
    "the backgrounds are normalized to match the observation counts in the 1012kev band where the _ chandra _  effective area is close to zero and the counts are dominated by the particle background .",
    "this procedure leads to background subtraction accurate to a few percent for energies @xmath50kev .",
    "however , the softer , diffuse x - ray background is known to vary over the sky . to account for this ,",
    "we extract spectra from the s1 chip which is not contaminated by point sources and is free from cluster emission .",
    "there is a clear residual excess below 2kev after background subtraction .",
    "this excess is well - fitted by two unabsorbed mekal models with abundance set to the solar value and temperatures of kt=@xmath51kev and kt=@xmath52kev .",
    "including this soft component , scaled by the ratio of the region areas , in the spectral fits performed in section  [ temps ] result in a @xmath53 increase in the measured temperatures .",
    "cluster membership was achieved using a two - step approach .",
    "first , we identify candidate cluster members as those galaxies lying within a projected radial distance of 3.5mpc from the brightest cluster galaxy ( r.a.=14:15:08.39 , decl.=@xmath5400:29:35.7 ) , having a redshift quality @xmath55 and a peculiar velocity ( defined with respect to the gama redshift of the bcg , @xmath56 ) of @xmath57@xmath2 .",
    "this serves as a coarse first cut membership allocation and 481 galaxies are selected in this first step .",
    "the membership allocation is refined using the redshift - space distribution of galaxies and iteratively applying the caustics method of @xcite .",
    "the caustic amplitude is proportional to the escape velocity of the cluster and , therefore , determining the caustic amplitudes as a function of radius provides an excellent boundary with which cluster membership can be defined .",
    "briefly , the distribution of galaxies in peculiar velocity - radius space is smoothed by a gaussian kernel with an adaptive smoothing width ( with @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the smoothing widths in velocity and radius , respectively ) which is proportional to the local density .",
    "the local density is determined from the velocity - radius distribution which has been smoothed with a kernel of constant width , although again the smoothing width used for the velocity and radius are different .",
    "the constant smoothing widths are @xmath61 and @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are outlier - trimmed estimates of the standard deviations of the radial and peculiar velocity distributions , respectively . here , @xmath65 is the number of galaxies assigned as cluster members .",
    "we then follow the basic method outlined in @xcite to locate the caustic amplitudes and define membership based on the position of these caustics .",
    "we iterate the procedure until @xmath65 is stable and allow galaxies previously rejected as non - members to be reassigned as members if they fall within the latest iteration of the caustic boundaries .",
    "the caustics method has been shown to be an accurate mass estimator at large clustercentric radii @xcite and a robust method for allocation of cluster membership @xcite .",
    "for further details , we refer the interested reader to the excellent explanations of the caustics method contained within the previously cited works .",
    "the phase - space distribution is shown in the top panel of figure  [ vpec_rad ] where it can be seen that there is significant structure at @xmath66@xmath2  which , given the offset at all radii from the main cluster body , is likely a background structure lying in projection along the line of sight ( los ) .",
    "this structure makes locating the caustic amplitude difficult and for this reason we choose to use the well - separated negative @xmath67 caustic amplitude to define the cluster membership .",
    "the caustic amplitude used to define cluster membership is shown in red , along with its associated uncertainty ( shown only on the outer - side ) which is determined as described in @xcite .",
    "the final sample of spectroscopically confirmed cluster members contains 283 galaxies within a cluster - centric radius of 3.5mpc .    in the bottom panel of figure  [ vpec_rad ]",

    "the spatial distribution of the fore- and background galaxies is different from the distribution of member galaxies .",
    "this provides additional support for them not being associated with the cluster .",
    "we also show the positions of the two brightest cluster galaxies as crosses , along with the cluster center assigned to a1882 in @xcite ( r.a.=14:14:42 , decl.=-00:19:00 ) as a plus sign .",

    "also measured is the cluster velocity dispersion @xmath72@xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath69 uncertainties on our cluster redshift and velocity dispersion measurements are determined with the jackknife resampling technique .",

    "we can reproduce the results of these earlier works by including galaxies with @xmath79@xmath2  as cluster members .",
    "this selection includes the background interlopers removed by our caustics member allocation .",
    "remeasuring the biweight estimators for this modified member selection , we find @xmath80 and @xmath81@xmath2 , consistent with the larger redshift and velocity dispersion from earlier results .",
    "this indicates that these studies were affected by interloper contamination from the background galaxies that our member selection technique successfully rejected .",
    "indeed , the `` modality '' and kurtosis measurements provided in the @xcite catalogs indicate significant departures from a gaussian shape , likely due to the effect of interlopers .    for a dynamically relaxed cluster , the peculiar velocity distribution is well approximated by a gaussian shape .",
    "the large peculiar velocities induced during cluster mergers can perturb this gaussian shape , particularly when the merger is close to core - passage and the merger axis is aligned close to our los ( e.g. , a2744 , * ? ? ?",
    "these perturbations are detected as higher order moments in the velocity distribution , such as the skewness and kurtosis .",
    "here we use the gauss - hermite reconstruction technique to test for non - gaussianity in the peculiar velocity distribution ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ? * for a detailed description ) .",
    "briefly , the velocity distribution is described by a series of gauss - hermite functions with the gauss - hermite moments @xmath82 multiplying the best - fitting gaussian with mean @xmath83 and dispersion @xmath84 , while the @xmath85 and @xmath86 terms describe asymmetric and symmetric deviations from a gaussian shape , respectively .",

    "@xmath86 terms , representing symmetric and asymmetric deviations from a gaussian shape , respectively , are not significant and indicate that the shape of the observed distribution does not differ significantly from a gaussian .",
    "[ vpec ] ]      while the peculiar velocity distribution is an excellent probe for detecting high velocity merger aligned along our los , it is generally a poor indicator for mergers which are occurring with the majority of their motion directed perpendicular to our los , e.g. , the well - known major merger abell  3667 has a velocity distribution which is well described by a single gaussian distribution @xcite . here",
    ", the spatial distribution of the member galaxies are an excellent probe of substructure , particularly when the merging structures are well separated and , therefore , easily discernible as enhancements in the surface density of the galaxies .",
    "the isopleths shown in @xcite reveal complex multimodality in the spatial distribution of galaxies in the direction of a1882 .",
    "however , those isopleths are generated without the aid of spectroscopic redshifts and may be significantly affected by contamination from unassociated structure lying along the los toward a1882 .",
    "we have shown in section  [ sec : memsel ] that there exists a great deal of background structure lying in the direction of a1882 . using our spectroscopically confirmed members defined in section  [ sec : memsel ] , we can asses whether the rich structure seen by @xcite is present in our sample .",
    "we have applied a two - step adaptive smoothing algorithm to the spatial distribution of the cluster members in order to reveal local overdensities in the galaxy surface density .",
    "on the first pass the spatial distribution is smoothed by a gaussian kernel with an optimum width which is proportional to number of cluster members , @xmath65 , and the standard deviation of the spatial distribution , @xmath92 and @xmath93 , such that @xmath94 @xcite .",
    "this provides an initial estimate of the galaxy surface density distribution .",
    "the initial density estimate is used in the second pass to define an adaptive smoothing kernel with width @xmath95 where @xmath96 , @xmath97 is the geometric mean of the first - pass density distribution and @xmath98 is the initial estimate of the density at position of interest .",
    "the results of this smoothing procedure are shown as black contours in figure  [ bubbles ] .",
    "consistent with the analysis of @xcite , the galaxy surface density shows a rich array of local peaks .",
    "there are two prominent peaks ; one is associated with the bcg ( within 100kpc ) and the second , located @xmath0mpc to the northwest , lies within 100kpc of the second rank cluster galaxy .",
    "having identified the existence of multiple local peaks in the spatial distribution of galaxies , we now wish to determine if these structures are also kinematically distinct .",
    "this is achieved by using the @xmath99-test @xcite to search for departures of the local kinematics around each galaxy in the member sample from the global cluster kinematics .",
    "we define `` local '' as the @xmath100 nearest neighbors to the galaxy of interest where @xmath101 is the number of cluster members in our sample .",
    "the peculiar velocity distribution of the near neighbors is compared to the global velocity distribution using the kolmogorov - smirnov test to assess the likelihood , @xmath102 , that the local and global distributions are drawn from the same parent distribution .",
    "we note that in defining the global velocity distribution , we have excluded the @xmath100 members local to the galaxy of interest .",
    "a measure of the overall kinematical substructure present within the cluster is determined by the summation @xmath103 .",
    "the significance of @xmath104 is determined by comparison to the distribution of 10,000 monte carlo realizations of @xmath105 .",
    "these realizations are produced by fixing the spatial coordinates for each cluster member and randomly shuffling the peculiar velocities , thereby erasing any correlation between position and velocity , and measuring @xmath105 .",
    "the @xmath106 value lies @xmath107 from the mean of the distribution of the @xmath105 values and @xmath108 does not occur in the 10,000 realizations .",
    "thus , there is only a very small probability that the observed @xmath104 value has occurred by chance .",
    "+    +    the results of the @xmath99-test are best visualized in the form of `` bubble '' plots where , at the position of each member galaxy , a circle with radius @xmath109 is plotted .",
    "kinematical substructures are revealed by regions containing clusters of large circles in figure  [ bubbles ] . where the departure is significant , i.e. , the value of @xmath102 occurs in only @xmath110 of the monte carlo realizations , we plot an emboldened circle . to give an indication as to whether the departure in the local kinematics is due to a local deviation in the peculiar velocity , we have colored the circles red or blue in order to indicate positive or negative peculiar velocities with respect to the cluster mean , respectively . a number of significantly large , blue bubbles are associated with the local peak in the galaxy density distribution located @xmath111mpc to the northwest , strongly indicating that it is also distinguished as a local kinematical substructure with a negative peculiar velocity .",
    "the bubble plot shows a number of significantly large circles near to the bcg , indicating evidence for kinematical substructure there . however",
    ", the colors of the circles indicate that there is no preference for either negative or positive peculiar velocities in this region .",
    "therefore , the significant departure of the local kinematics from the global kinematics revealed here is likely to be due to differences in the shapes of the local and global velocity distributions , rather than due to a large local peculiar velocity difference .",
    "for example , the velocity dispersion may be enhanced in this region compared with the global velocity distribution .",
    "alternatively , the contribution of other localized kinematical substructures to the global velocity distributions may lead to differences between the local and global velocity distributions .",
    "finally , the less - significant local peak in the galaxy surface density distribution which is @xmath112mpc northwest of the bcg also harbors significant kinematical substructure and the galaxies have systematically higher peculiar velocities in this region .",
    "the majority of the kinematical substructures , particularly the nw one , show a preference for having either positive or negative peculiar velocities .",
    "a better indication of where these structures lie in peculiar velocity space can be gleaned from the 3d smoothed galaxy density distribution . for the spatial portion of the smoothing",
    ", we apply the same adaptive kernel as outlined in section  [ adapt_smooth ] while in the velocity direction we smooth with a gaussian kernel with a constant width of @xmath113@xmath2 . in the top right and bottom panels of figure  [ bubbles ] we present tomograms showing the smoothed 3d galaxy density in velocity slices centered at @xmath114@xmath2 .",
    "these velocity positions were chosen from the full velocity range because they reveal where peaks in the 3d distribution lie in velocity space .",
    "the analyses presented above reveal a significant substructure @xmath0mpc  to the northwest of the main cluster in a1882 which is both spatially and kinematically distinct .",

    "while the assumption of a gaussian shape for the spatial distribution of galaxies in a cluster is not physically well motivated the kmm methodology has been shown to work well with spatial information alone @xcite .",
    "another limitation of the kmm algorithm is that it can be significantly affected by the presence of outliers .",
    "preliminary test runs of the algorithm indicate that the two substructures located to the northwest at radii @xmath115mpc significantly affect the stability of the kmm fits to a1882b .",

    "the kmm algorithm requires fairly robust initial estimates of the 3d positions and dispersions of the substructures , as well as estimates of the fraction of galaxies within the substructure .",
    "the initial estimates for the spatial positions of the substructures are obtained from the peaks in the galaxy surface density distribution section  [ adapt_smooth ] .",

    "the kmm algorithm was designed to assess one - dimensional distributions for bimodality and return a p - value which provides a quantitative assessment of the improvement in going from a unimodal to a bimodal fit .",
    "this is achieved by comparing the likelihood ratio test statistic ( lrts ) to a chi - squared distribution . however , as noted in @xcite the p - value only gives a useful indication of the improvement in the fit for the specific case of a one - dimensional , homoscedastic ( i.e. , equal variances ) bimodal versus unimodal fit .",
    "our data fail these criteria on two accounts ; they are three - dimensional and non - homoscedastic .",
    "we overcome this issue using the method described in @xcite , i.e. , we use parametric bootstrapping to determine the probability of obtaining a lrts as large as that observed . briefly , this is achieved by resampling the best fitting single gaussian 3d model 5000 times , refitting for both the single and two - gaussian cases using the same input estimates listed in table  [ kmm_fits ] , and determining the distribution of the lrtss . as can be seen in table  [ kmm_fits ] ,",

    "also included in each fit is the correction for the soft x - ray background component described in section  [ chandra_red ] .",
    "we also present a temperature map for a1882b in the lower right panel of figure  [ a1882b_xray_imgs ] .",
    "however , the lower surface brightness and shorter exposure time mean that there is a high degree of correlation between the temperature measurements in each of the pixels .",
    "this is indicated by the range in extraction region size , shown as white circles in the lower right panel of figures  [ a1882a_xray_imgs ] and [ a1882b_xray_imgs ] , which reveal that the extraction region radii range from @xmath197 and @xmath198 for a1882a and a1882b , respectively .",

    "however , the higher resolution hr maps reveal that the cool gas @xmath203 west of the core is in fact not connected by a finger of cool gas to the core , as indicated in the temperature map .",

    "<S> we present a combined optical and x - ray analysis of the rich cluster abell  1882 with the aim of identifying merging substructure and understanding the recent assembly history of this system . </S>",
    "<S> our optical data consist of spectra drawn from the galaxy and mass assembly ( gama ) survey , which lends itself to this kind of detailed study thanks to its depth and high spectroscopic completeness . </S>",
    "<S> we use 283 spectroscopically confirmed cluster members to detect and characterize substructure . </S>",
    "<S> we complement the optical data with x - ray data taken with both _ </S>",
    "<S> chandra _  and xmm . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis reveals that a1882 harbors two main components , a1882a and a1882b , which have a projected separation of @xmath0mpc and a line of sight velocity difference of @xmath1@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the primary system , a1882a , has velocity dispersion @xmath3@xmath2 and _ chandra _  ( xmm ) temperature @xmath4kev ( @xmath5kev ) while the secondary , a1882b , has @xmath6@xmath2 and _ chandra _  ( xmm ) temperature @xmath7kev ( @xmath8kev ) . </S>",
    "<S> the optical and x - ray estimates for the masses of the two systems are consistent within the uncertainties and indicate that there is twice as much mass in a1882a ( @xmath9@xmath10 ) when compared with a1882b ( @xmath11@xmath10 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we interpret the a1882a / a1882b system as being observed prior to a core passage . </S>",
    "<S> supporting this interpretation is the large projected separation of a1882a and a1882b and the dearth of evidence for a recent ( @xmath12gyr ) major interaction in the x - ray data . </S>",
    "<S> two - body analyses indicate that a1882a and a1882b form a bound system with bound incoming solutions strongly favored . </S>",
    "<S> we compute blue fractions of @xmath13 and @xmath14 for the spectroscopically confirmed member galaxies within @xmath15 of the centers of a1882a and a1882b , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these blue fractions do not differ significantly from the blue fraction measured from an ensemble of 20 clusters with similar mass and redshift . </S>"
