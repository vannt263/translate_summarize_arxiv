    "we are motivated by the steep evolution of the bright quasar ( qs ) population ; out to @xmath3 their number exceeds the local value by some @xmath4 ( schmidt & green 1983 , schmidt 1989 ) . around @xmath5",
    "the evolution culminates , and farther out it goes into a decline ( osmer 1982 , shaver et al .",
    "1996 ) .    our work will be based on two widely shared notions .",
    "first , the qss are powered by massive black holes ( bhs ) accreting gas from their host galaxies ; thus e.m .",
    "outputs @xmath6 obtain when the baryonic mass @xmath7 is accreted over the time @xmath8 with conversion efficiency up to @xmath9 ( rees 1984 ) .",
    "second , the structures surrounding the bhs develop after the hierarchical clustering ( see peebles 1993 ) ; this envisages the galaxies as baryonic cores within heavier halos of cold dark matter ( dm ) . before @xmath3 galactic halos",
    "are built up through merging of smaller units ; thereafter the galaxies begin to assemble into small groups of dynamical mass @xmath10 , which in turn merge into richer groups and eventually into clusters . by such a hierarchical development ,",
    "the numbers of structures in each mass range undergo a fast increase followed by a slow demise .    on these grounds , the high qs luminosities in the optical , ir or x - ray bands",
    "may be expected to signal out to @xmath11 environmental conditions conducive to accretion .",
    "in fact , the decline ( a rise in cosmic epoch ) of the early qss is widely held to be geared to galaxy formation .",
    "specifically , their environment is held to be constituted by protogalactic spheroids being built up hierarchically through major , chaotic merging events between dense , very gas - rich subunits . in these events the gravitational potential",
    "is strongly distorted , while the baryons are lumped and shocked ; so the angular momentum @xmath12 of the gas orbiting at kpc distances in the host is efficiently transferred to the heavier dm substructures , and the gas can begin an inward course toward pc or smaller scales . from the plenty of gas",
    "so made available , central massive bhs collapse and/or accrete rapidly ; they can accrete at their full _ self - limiting _ rate , and easily attain eddington luminosities @xmath13 erg@xmath14 .",
    "this is indicated by eq .",
    "( 1.1 ) , when the bhs double their mass and make @xmath15 over short dynamical scales @xmath8 that match the effective eddington time @xmath16 gyr . in sum ,",
    "the number of early qss ought to track the galaxy formation , and _ rise _ together with the number of host galactic halos exceeding some @xmath17 .",
    "such a direct connection of qss with newly forming galaxies has been represented with models developing over the years from the first attemps by cavaliere & szalay ( 1986 ) and efstathiou & rees ( 1988 ) , to haehnelt & rees ( 1993 ) , haiman & loeb ( 1998 ) , haehnelt , natarajan & rees ( 1998 ) , cavaliere & vittorini ( 1998 , henceforth cv98 ) .",
    "concurring evidence is being provided by observations such as those by fontana et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , and in djorgowski ( 1998 ) .",
    "here we focus on the dramatic _ fall _ of the bright qs population later than @xmath3 , where more features can be observed and the picture is more complex . the time scale involved is around @xmath18 gyr , fast compared with the gentle demise of the galaxy formation envisaged by the hierarchical clustering .",
    "the behavior of the optical luminosity function ( lf ) is dominated by luminosity evolution ( le , see boyle , shanks & peterson 1988 ; hatziminaoglou , van waerheke & mathez 1998 ) , a trend also shared by the lfs in x - rays ( della ceca et al .",
    "1994 , boyle et al .",
    "1994 ) and in the radio band ( dunlop & peacock 1990 ) .",
    "additional features appear in the optical data toward low @xmath19 .",
    "first , a minor component of density evolution ( de ) has been discerned at blue magnitudes @xmath20 by boyle et al .",
    "( 1988 ) , and confirmed by maloney & petrosian ( 1999 ) .",
    "second , la franca & cristiani ( 1997 ) , and goldschmidt & miller ( 1998 ) found an excess of bright qss over previous surveys ; from these observations and those by khler et al .",
    "( 1997 ) the lfs appear to be stretched out into a generally smoother shape on approaching low @xmath19 .",
    "finally , faint x - ray emissions and liner - type activity are increasingly found to be widespread among otherwise normal galaxies , see ho , filippenko & sargent ( 1997 ) ; miyaji , hasinger & schmidt ( 1998 ) ; giommi , fiore & perri ( 1998 ) .",
    "on the other hand , sharp imaging of a number of bright qss at intermediate @xmath19 has revealed host galaxies which are not really newly forming , but rather are surrounded by a complex environment . some still exhibit morphological marks of a recent tidal interaction , in spite of the low surface brightness and short duration ( @xmath21 gyr ) of such features ; others are found in close association with comparable or fainter companions ; a fraction even appear to harbor secondary nuclei ( see hutchings & neff 1992 ; hutchings , crampton & johnson 1995 ; rafanelli , violato & baruffolo 1995 ; hasinger et al .",
    "1997 ; bahcall et al .",
    "1997 ; boyce et al . 1998 ; mclure et al . 1998 ; ridgway et .",
    "al . 1999 ) .",
    "in addition , recent statistical evidence ( fisher et al . 1996 ; jaeger , fricke & heidt 1998 ; wold et al . 1999 ) points toward a poor group environment also for radio - quiet qss , perhaps poorer than for the radio - loud objects ( yee & green 1987 , lehnert et al . 1999 ) .    but the issue is not settled .",
    "other observers detect at most marginal evidence that the environments of the bright qs are richer than the field ( see smith , boyle & maddox 1995 ; teplitz , mclean & malkan 1999 ; croom & shanks 1998 ) , and find low incidence of peculiarities in galaxies active at the levels of the seyfert nuclei ( malkan , gorjian & tam 1998 ) .",
    "many point out the need to enlarge and complete the qs samples , and to compare them with proper controls .    such a complex data situation warrants exploring what predictions follow from pursuing the physical connection of bright qs activity with host interactions .",
    "our guideline ( taking up cavaliere & padovani 1989 , small & blandford 1992 , cv98 ) will be that later than @xmath3 the accretion feast ought to cease turning the qs rise into a descent , due to a gradual _ change _ in their environment .",
    "in fact , toward lower @xmath19 major merging events ( with the associated gas imports into the host ) become rarer and rarer at galactic scales ; the prevailing dynamical events are best described as _",
    "interactions _ between developed galaxies , occurring mainly in the small groups which then begin to virialize .",
    "these events do not necessarily increase the dark halo masses , yet they can _ destabilize _ the gas in the hosts and trigger limited accretion episodes ; these draw from the gas reservoirs in the hosts , and concur with starbursts in progressively exhausting them .",
    "but as exhaustion is approached other , lesser gas supplies become relevant for lower level activity , such as those provided from accretion of satellite galaxies that occours even in low density environments or in the field .",
    "we intend to single out and address directly the astrophysical processes involved , rather than base upon numerical and phenomenological treatments as in kauffmann & haehnelt ( 1999 ) .",
    "specifically , we shall simplify the dynamical history of the dm , to focus on the consumption and depletion of the gas reservoirs in the host galaxies .",
    "first , in  2 and  3 we will examine the outcomes of encounters of the host with sizeable companions , occurring mainly in poor _",
    "groups_. then in  4 we examine accretion of satellite galaxies with their additional but small gas supplies , and consider also other processes that can occur in the _ field_. finally , in  5 we summarize and discuss our conclusions , stressing implications and predictions .",
    "our study will be based on the standard hierarchical development of cosmic structures past the era of galaxy formation ; poor groups , in particular , are expected to start condensing at a considerable rate later than @xmath22 in viable cosmologies . and tilted cold dm initial perturbations ; our numerical calculations will also cover the flat , @xmath23 case with @xmath24 and standard cold dm perturbations ( see bunn & white 1997 ) .",
    "we recall that in the former cosmology the standard hierarchical clustering implies the virializing masses to attain density contrasts close to 180 over the field and to scale up like @xmath25 , while the velocity dispersions scale like @xmath26 ; here @xmath27 is the power spectral index of the perturbations at group scales . ]",
    "we hold that the approximate equality at @xmath28 of the qs peak with the group onset constitutes not a coincidence but rather an _",
    "feature , telling of a connection of the qss with the environment at scales larger than galactic .",
    "our starting point is that qs hosts in early , poor but dense groups are bound to _ interact _ with their companions .",
    "the role of these dynamical events for nuclear activity is again to destabilize the gas in the host , specifically causing it to lose angular momentum .",
    "so they trigger inflows that rekindle the existing but dormant bhs into intermittent , dwindling episodes of _ supply - limited _ accretion and emission .",
    "that encounters occur preferentially in groups is shown by many simulations ( see governato , tozzi & cavaliere 1996 , athanassoula 1998 ) .",
    "this may be anticipated ( see cv98 ) on the basis of the average time @xmath29 gyr between encounters , basically because in groups the galaxy number density @xmath30 is high .",
    "on the other hand , in poor groups the velocity dispersion @xmath31 only modestly exceeds the internal galaxian velocities @xmath32 , so that the cross section for effective interactions ( see binney & tremaine 1987 ) is close to the geometrical value @xmath33 related to the radii @xmath34 of the host and @xmath35 of the interaction partner .",
    "the time scale for inflows to develop is of order @xmath36 gyr , the galaxian dynamical time .",
    "that such encounters can lead to substantial gas funnelling toward the nucleus is shown by a number of high resolution simulations comprising both the n - body treatment of the dm component and a hydrodynamic treatment of the gas ( see mihos & hernquist 1996 , barnes & hernquist 1998 ) .",
    "these simulations show that over a few @xmath37 gyrs following a grazing encounter up to @xmath38 of the gas orbiting in a galaxy at distances of kpc is driven into the central @xmath39 pc , the resolution limit .",
    "the result follows from a number of dynamical steps , as discussed by mihos ( 1999 ) .",
    "first comes the gravitational action from the partner , which depends on its mass @xmath40 and impact parameter @xmath41 and lasts for a time @xmath42 . then follows the response by the dm and the baryonic components developing in the host over times @xmath43",
    "; this is possibly amplified by internal metastability conditions to form true bars . finally , it ensues the loss by the gas of a considerable amount of orbital energy and angular momentum @xmath44 , which triggers the gas inflow .",
    "an internal loss of @xmath12 ( that is , @xmath45 ) may be anticipated , since the asymmetries and inhomogeneities induced in the baryonic and in the dm components do not superpose or align ; so the gravitational coupling will transfer @xmath12 from the former to the latter , more massive component .",
    "but most accretion episodes will be milder , originating from a fly - by of the host by a smaller or a comparable companion at impact parameters @xmath46 . from eq . ( 1.1 ) it is seen that in gas - rich hosts still containing @xmath47 of gas , a fractional gas mass @xmath48 a few @xmath49 sent to the central bh over @xmath50 gyr is enough to yield outputs approaching @xmath51 erg@xmath14 .",
    "the actual gas amount made available by an encounter will _ limit _ the maximal luminosity attained by the qs before fading out .",
    "the controlling factor will be @xmath44 , which closely bounds from above the gas fraction @xmath52 funneled to a small inward velocity ( see gunn 1977 ) .",
    "in fact , the gas funneled inward may end up not only in accretion onto the central bh , but also in a less constrained nuclear starburst ( see sanders & mirabel 1996 ) , or it may be mostly dispersed .",
    "we shall assume that about 1/3 of the destabilized fraction @xmath52 constitutes the fraction @xmath53 actually accreted .",
    "it is convenient to rewrite the output in eq .",
    "( 1.1 ) as @xmath54 apart from the factor @xmath55 fixed for a given host .",
    "this is to visualize and tell apart the long - term trend and the fluctuating component in the gas accretion .",
    "the factor @xmath56 _ drifts down _ on the long scale set by the time @xmath57 gyr between encounters ; over the shorter scales @xmath58 gyr of a fly - by the factor @xmath56 stays nearly constant , but the other factor @xmath59 is statistically _ distributed _ following the distributions of the dynamical parameters of the fly - by events .",
    "here we show how the _ distribution _ @xmath60 of the fractions @xmath52 gives rise to the shape of the lf , that we indicate with @xmath61 .",
    "we expect that many encounters can destabilize gas fractions of order @xmath62 ; these will lead to accretion of @xmath63 , and to outputs up to @xmath64 erg@xmath14 in a gas - rich host .",
    "we shall see that they produce @xmath65 const in this luminosity range .",
    "higher luminosities require larger destabilized fractions @xmath66 ; in turn , these require closer encounters with larger companions , and these events are fewer .",
    "when we compute the corresponding distribution @xmath60 , we expect it to drop steeply , producing a steep bright end of @xmath67 .    to show this , we consider a group and inside it we examine the interaction of a gas - rich host galaxy ( with radius @xmath34 and circular velocity @xmath32 ) with a group companion of mass @xmath40 on its orbit with relative velocity @xmath31 and impact parameter @xmath41 .",
    "the gas mass @xmath68 in the host , at equilibrium on scales @xmath69 of some kpcs with the velocity @xmath70 enforced by the host mass @xmath71 within @xmath72 , has the specific angular momentum @xmath73 .",
    "the maximal @xmath74 obtains when the gas rotates slowly and responds strongly to the gravitational force from the companion . in such conditions ( see appendix a ) we evaluate the time - integrated , relative change @xmath75 , which easily approaches 1 . using this to evaluate @xmath76 in eq .",
    "( 2.1 ) , we see that @xmath77 holds , on neglecting over the time scale @xmath43 the slow decrease of @xmath68 .",
    "so @xmath60 as defined above is computed on convolving the distributions of the dynamical parameters @xmath40 and @xmath41 , namely , @xmath78 and by @xmath79 combined into @xmath80 where the factor @xmath81 is fixed for a given host and over times of order @xmath43 .",
    "the distribution @xmath78 is dispersed over a wide range ; we adopt the press & schechter ( 1974 ) form which includes the power - law factor @xmath82 , from @xmath83 up to the mass of the host , often the brightest group member .. ] the scaling of @xmath60 in the upper range of @xmath52 depends only moderately on @xmath84 .",
    "the latter reflects the poorly known geometry of the galaxian orbits in the group ; but when the group is small , with membership of a few to several bright galaxies , the range of @xmath41 extends by a factor of hardly @xmath85 , from the minimal value about @xmath34 ( which sets encounters apart from prompt merging , see governato el al .",
    "1996 ) to the upper value @xmath86 ( which defines the effective binary encounters in terms of the group radius @xmath87 and the membership @xmath88 ) .",
    "we represent in fig .",
    "1 the probability @xmath60 that we compute in the appendix a from eq . ( 2.2 ) in three cases that bracket the variance expected .",
    "one is the simplest case @xmath89 obtained on using a peaked distribution @xmath84 ; we find that the shape in the main body of @xmath60 follows the shape of @xmath90 , to yield @xmath91 before going into a cutoff .",
    "the second case @xmath92 is the other limit holding for a flat distribution @xmath84 , and yielding a shape still close to @xmath93 before the cutoff ; this will constitute our reference frame .",
    "case @xmath94 obtains when the gas rotation is fast and the gravitational torque from the partner can be described as a truly tidal effect ( see appendix a ) . then integrating over the fly - by time we evaluate @xmath95 ; the shape of @xmath60 turns out to be somewhat flattened in the extended lower range of @xmath52 .    to evaluate the corresponding shape of @xmath96",
    ", we consider that after times of order @xmath97 gyr taken by a fly - by ( see  2 ) the gas will increasingly flood the accretion disk in the nucleus on a galactic timescale @xmath43 again of order @xmath37 gyr ( see  2 ) .",
    "the reactivated qss will brighten up at the rate @xmath98 , up to the value of @xmath99 allowed by the accreted fraction @xmath100 ; in the range @xmath101 corresponding to minimal @xmath102 their number is conserved , that is , @xmath103 const applies .",
    "then they fade off and drop out of the lf ; the relative number of objects doing so in each range @xmath104 around @xmath99 is given by the relative variation of @xmath105 as given by @xmath106 where the right hand side is evaluated at @xmath107 ( note the analogy with the radiative transfer formalism ) .",
    "the result is @xmath108 with @xmath109 at luminosities brighter than @xmath110 .    in sum ,",
    "past a break at @xmath64 erg / s corresponding to @xmath111 , the qs luminosity function fed by encounters _",
    "steepens _ from @xmath112 to @xmath113 , and then goes into a cutoff .",
    "this evaluation will be checked with the systematic computation given in  3 .",
    "the comoving lf evolves over the long time scales provided by time between encounters @xmath114 .",
    "the latter grows longer as @xmath19 decreases , basically because the density @xmath115 of galaxies in a group is proportional to the decreasing mass density in the background at virialization .",
    "this is offset only in part by the increase of the encounter velocities @xmath116 caused by the gravitational clustering , which approximately yields @xmath117 in the critical universe where @xmath118 holds . in the absence of strong galaxy evolution the cross section remains close to @xmath119const in groups or poor clusters .",
    "then @xmath120 closely obtains in groups .    as a consequence , two components to the qs evolution",
    "may be anticipated .",
    "a first , milder component is due to the encounters becoming _",
    "rarer _ as richer , but less dense groups come of age .",
    "this clearly causes in the qs population a mild de proportional to @xmath121 at late epoch @xmath122 .",
    "the second and stronger component is in the form of le ; it occurs because on long time scales the luminosities decrease together with the available gas mass , following @xmath123 . in other words ,",
    "the interactions also become _ less _ effective in feeding the bhs as the host gas reservoirs are depleted by all previous discharges .    from @xmath60 given by eq .",
    "2.2 , we compute @xmath124 corresponding to an average @xmath125 and to a minimal fraction @xmath126 actually accreted . so the gas is _ depleted _ following @xmath127 to yield @xmath128 , where @xmath129 gyr is the present epoch .",
    "the value @xmath130 of the time between encounters in local , virialized systems may be scaled from the classic census in the local field of bright galaxies with persisting signatures of interactions ( toomre 1977 ) ; this leads to a time around @xmath131 gyr between such encounters in the field .",
    "the value scales with the inverse of the galaxy density down to @xmath132 gyr in virialized groups , where density contrasts of about @xmath133 over the field are indicated by the hierarchical clustering .",
    "the resulting behavior is a strong le ; in particular , in the critical universe the break luminosity @xmath134 evolves as @xmath135 to sum up the contents of this section , from direct evaluation of the rates and strength of the accretion episodes driven by encounters we have found the following features : the comoving number of the qss evolves like @xmath136 for @xmath137 , the era of near completion for group formation , see  3 ; the shape of the lfs has the form of a double power law broken at @xmath138 ^ 3 $ ] ; the bright end is given by @xmath139 with @xmath140 .",
    "collecting these results in one expression , we expect the lf of qss to follow @xmath141 with the last factor applying only beyond the break @xmath110 . these basic behaviors of @xmath142 will be checked and completed in the next section .",
    "here we present a systematic computation of @xmath143 , the differential and evolving lf in comoving form , produced when the bhs are reactivated by encounters to bright qs luminosities .",
    "we will base our computations upon the formalism of the so - called continuity equation ( see cavaliere et al .",
    "1983 ) .",
    "this pictures the statistics of the qss as analogous to a hydrodynamical flow along the @xmath99-axis with sources and sinks .",
    "in fact , the equation that we are going to recall and use is the analog ( whence the name ) of the continuity equation for a 1-d fluid , with the density replaced by the comoving number of objects per unit luminosity @xmath144 , and the velocity replaced by @xmath145 .",
    "the equation stems from the general expression for the rate of change @xmath146 in a given bin @xmath104 around @xmath99 ; the change is due to three causes .",
    "first , the objects are activated at the luminosity @xmath99 and with the rate given by a source function @xmath147 .",
    "second , they brighten up at the rate @xmath145 on the time scale @xmath43 discussed in  2 , and so flow out of the bin @xmath104 at the net rate @xmath148 .",
    "third , they may quench for lack of fuel after attaining the luminosity @xmath99 , at the rate given by a sink function @xmath149 .",
    "the algebraic sum of the above contributions yields the net rate of change @xmath146 in the form of the kinetic equation @xmath150 this is the `` continuity equation '' treated by cavaliere et al .",
    "we now discuss in turn the three astrophysical inputs @xmath151 , and @xmath152 that substantiate the general formalism for the present scope .    in the present context",
    ", the brightening @xmath98 develops on the time scale @xmath58 gyr ( discussed in  2 ) taken by the gas to be directed on an inward course and to flood the accretion disk in the nucleus .",
    "this implies @xmath153 , where @xmath154 is the epoch when reactivation and brightening begin from a faint luminosity @xmath155 .",
    "these `` characteristic lines '' @xmath156 are related to the streamlines in our hydrodynamical analogy , as shown in appendix b ; there we also show that they provide a simple way to find the relevant solution of eq .",
    "( 3.1 ) .",
    "the source function @xmath157 represents the rate of bh reactivations per unit @xmath99 . as to its @xmath99-dependence",
    ", reactivation implies scarce if any accretion occurring previously , so the initial luminosities @xmath155 are faint compared to the bright levels we focus on ; hence to a first approximation we shall necglect the dispersion , and take @xmath158 to be concentrated around a single value @xmath155 in the form of a @xmath159-function @xmath160 . as to the @xmath161-dependence ,",
    "the reactivation rate is given by the ( comoving ) number density of hosts located in groups at the epoch @xmath161 , divided by the mean time @xmath162 between reactivations .",
    "we focus on the member in a group that is so large and gas - rich as to fuel a sizeable activity upon encounters ; often this will be single , based on the magnitude difference between the members of small groups observed by ramella et al . ( 1999 ) .",
    "so the number density of effective hosts will equal @xmath163 , the density of groups in the universe at the epoch @xmath161 . in sum ,",
    "our source function is given by @xmath164 most rekindled sources attain @xmath165 erg s@xmath166 as said in  2 .",
    "so at _ faint _ luminosities @xmath167 no quenching occurs , and only the source term @xmath168 is present in eq . ( 3.1 ) ; then the solution of eq .",
    "( 3.1 ) takes the simple form ( derived in appendix b , see eq .",
    "b.6 ) @xmath169 here we see the basic shape @xmath112 ( corresponding to @xmath170 const , as expected from our preliminary discussion of  2.1 ) ; this reflects the object population established by the brightening along the lines @xmath153 .",
    "the modulating exponent @xmath171 ( evaluated in appendix b ) takes values close to @xmath172 at epochs close to @xmath173 ( i.e , at @xmath28 ) , when the group number rises briskly .",
    "this is because at such epochs the source function @xmath174 increases appreciably over the time scale @xmath43 , so it tends to populate the faint bins close to @xmath155 faster than the objects can flow out to brighter bins , and @xmath61 steepens somewhat .",
    "at @xmath122 instead , @xmath175 is on its slow demise ; so the exponent @xmath171 vanishes or becomes slightly negative . at these late epochs the @xmath161-dependence of the lf",
    "is dominated by the decreasing factor @xmath176 which yields a weak and late de ; this is maximized in the critical universe where it follows @xmath136 .",
    "but we recall from eq .",
    "( 2.6 ) that for @xmath177 a stronger le of the form @xmath178 is driven by the depletion of gas accreted or condensed into stars following each interaction . for @xmath179",
    "also the sink function @xmath180 intervenes at the right hand side of eq .",
    "( 3.1 ) ; this represents the number of objects per unit time that brighten beyond @xmath110 , but then quench and drop out of the lf at some larger @xmath99 due to fuel limitations .",
    "if these independently affect the qs population at a given @xmath19 , then @xmath181 is to hold . on the other hand ,",
    "the drop out rate is related to the probability @xmath182 discussed in  2.1 ; clearly , a steeper slope @xmath183 will corresponds to faster drop out rates compared with the scale @xmath43 of the brightening .",
    "these considerations lead to @xmath184 @xmath185 ; in other words , @xmath186 is the qs lifetime at high luminosities before fading out . since @xmath187 , and recalling that @xmath188 holds , the relation also writes @xmath189 this is just the same as given by eq .",

    "note that this goes over smoothly from the limiting form ( 3.3 ) at the faint end to the other limiting form ( 3.5 ) at the bright end .",
    "note also that the natural normalization of the lf given by eq .",
    "( 3.6 ) turns out to be a few @xmath195 shining qss per bright galaxy ; this arises with no parameter adjustement from the factor @xmath196 , and from the fraction up to 40% of bright galaxies residing in groups with membership @xmath197 ( ramella et al .",

    "2 we have added to the bright end of the lfs two small contributions which arise even when the qs hosts are located in the field , due to the following processes .",
    "\\(i ) bh fueling from encounters of their host with a substantial partner ; these occur mainly in the large - scale structures which contain most galaxies and have contrasts of a few units over the general average as shown by redshift surveys ( ramella , private communication ) .",
    "such galaxy densities are still lower by about @xmath203 compared with those in virialized groups ( see footnote @xmath204 ) , so the field encounters take place at the correspondingly lower rate @xmath205 . on the other hand , they involve more hosts by a factor about @xmath206 ; this arises ( see the discussion at the end of  3 ) because the most effective groups have membership @xmath207 and comprise about @xmath208 of the bright galaxies . thus the contribution from field encounters is around @xmath209 relative to encounters in groups .",
    "\\(ii ) a lesser contribution ( around 5 % , as discussed by cv98 ) is due to bhs flaring up to eddington luminosities in the minority of galaxies still formed after @xmath3 by the few major merging events still occurring .",
    "these two contributions are small but decrease slowly , because field galaxies undergo rare encounters and their gas is used mainly by the slow quiescent star formation ( see guiderdoni et al .",
    "so on approaching low @xmath19 such contributions are bound to emerge at the _ bright _ end , and to exceed there the rapidly decreasing contribution due to encounters in groups ( singled out by the dotted lines in fig .",
    "2 ) .    on the other hand , nuclear activities fainter than @xmath210 erg s@xmath166 are less demanding in terms of accretion , and may feed on a number of different and superposing processes . to complete the above picture , we examine here the minor host - satellite interactions which become relevant when the gas reservoirs in the hosts approach exhaustion . from these events",
    "we anticipate a considerable addition to the _ faint _ end of the lfs ; our expectations are outlined below , and are all checked and expanded in appendix c.    since also the host galaxies located in the field can accrete their satellites , many more bhs can be activated by accretion related to such events .",
    "but lower activity levels @xmath211 erg / s will be so allowed . this is because of two concurring reasons : first , the satellites masses are small , in the range @xmath212 complementary to that discussed in  2.1 ; second , the usable gas supplies are provided mainly by the satellite cores , as we shall see below , and these contain meager gas amounts @xmath213 .",
    "very sub - eddington @xmath99 will be produced in this way , since the central bhs in the hosts are already grown up .",
    "another expected feature is that the distribution of the gas masses to be accreted from the satellites should be as steep as , or even steeper than the distribution of the faint galaxy masses . in conclusion",
    ", the associated lfs will be _ steep _ , and their normalization will be high due to the many field galaxies also activated in this mode , though at faint levels .",
    "on the other hand , the event rate will decrease sharply as satellites are accreted out of the initial retinue and their residual number per host galaxy is depleted .",
    "this will yield a _",
    "strong _ de ( in fact , one which is @xmath99-dependent as we shall see ) , but will cause no le since the satellite gas supplies will be accreted either all or nothing .    finally , as the accretion rate diminishes , the radiative efficiency itself may decrease below @xmath214 ; moreover , the optical emission is expected to be especially weak and often drowned into the galactic light , while the associated emissions in x - rays will be stronger and also more easily pinpointed .",
    "these features arise because regimes of adaf or adios kind ( see the discussion by blandford & begelman 1998 and references therein ) are to set in at low accretion rates such as those fed only by satellites .",
    "while it is much debated which regime actually prevails , both will yield a low overall efficiency in using and/or converting into radiation the gas that reaches the accretion disk . in both cases",
    "the hard x - rays should dominate over the soft x - rays , even more over the optical emissions , see di matteo et al .",
    "so at these low accretion rates the soft x - ray and the optical bands comprise a small fraction of the small bolometric luminosity actually radiated .",
    "our detailed computations are given in appendix c. here we stress that both the gas supply carried by a satellite , and the gravitational perturbation affecting the host , will be effective for accretion only when a satellite or its residual core sinks deep into the host body and delivers there the gas to be accreted .",
    "such sinking may be triggered by encounters , but more often will begin as orbital decay caused by dynamical friction ; the formal time scale is given by @xmath215 gyr , see binney & tremaine ( 1987 ) .",
    "however , the effective time scale actually depends on the current satellite mass @xmath216 ; it has been recently stressed how thoroughly the sinking satellites will be peeled off along their way by tidal disruption and stripping , especially those which are initially larger , see walker , mihos & hernquist ( 1996 ) and colpi et al .",
    "the full process is very delicate to calculate and even to simulate numerically , but it basically leads to a _ weak _ dependence on the initial @xmath217 . in view of these uncertainties , our scope here will be limited to explore trends ; to this specific purpose we adopt the phenomenological scaling @xmath218 with the exponent @xmath219 @xmath220 designed to describe a weak dependence on the initial @xmath217 .    for consistency",
    ", we have also to consider that the gas effectively sunk into the host body is provided only by the fraction residing in the satellite cores ; this is not only small but also will depend weakly on the initial total mass @xmath217 . again",
    "phenomenologically , we will use the exponent @xmath221 to describe this dependence in the form @xmath222    the full lfs so generated are computed in appendix c , and given in eq .",

    "is also given in gyrs .    in fig .",
    "3 we represent specifically the soft x - ray lfs at low @xmath19 resulting in the critical universe from cannibalism of satellites .",
    "we have adopted @xmath228 @xmath229 , considering ( as commented above ) the small efficiency @xmath230 and the large bolometric correction @xmath231 expected for soft x - ray emission at low accretion rates .",
    "we represent also how these lfs add to the contribution from group encounters that has been computed in  3 and represented in fig .",
    "2a .    in sum , the contributions from satellite cannibalism to the lfs tend to pile up toward the faint end , producing steep lfs which steepen yet to a cutoff .",
    "such contributions will evolve following a strong , @xmath99-dependent de .",
    "we have shown that a steep qs fall for @xmath232 is to result from the effects of the hierarchical _ growth _ of structures around accreting bhs , amplified by the exhaustion of the gas available for the accretion .",
    "the hierarchical clustering envisages the era of galaxy formation to go over to an era of group assemblage for @xmath233 . in a group ,",
    "the settled host galaxies keep on evolving for a while , no longer by major merging events but rather via _",
    "encounters _ which occur at rates @xmath234 gyr@xmath166 .    these are milder events , yet able to destabilize the host gas , specifically by causing considerable _ loss _ of angular momentum as tackled in  2 .",
    "we have shown how they trigger intermittent and _ supply - limited _ accretion episodes onto the central bh , yielding blue luminosities @xmath235 erg / s for some @xmath37 gyr in large , gas - rich galaxies .",
    "but we have additionally shown in  2.2 how such substantial gas discharges , which also fuel simultaneous starbursts activity , _ deplete _ the host reservoirs and cause the gaseous mass to decrease substantially following @xmath236 on average .",
    "thus the encounters not only turn rarer ( @xmath237 ) as the clustering proceeds toward groups richer but less dense , and so produce a later , _ weak _ de ; but they also become less and less effective in terms of triggered accretion , and this causes _ strong _",
    "le with the luminosities scaling down close to @xmath238 .",
    "the result we predict for bright qss in the range @xmath233 is outlined in eq .",
    "( 2.6 ) , is derived and shown in more details in  3 to yield eq .",
    "( 3.6 ) , and is represented in full by fig .",

    "1988 , but also with the recent re - analysis of variuos samples by maloney & petrosian 1999 , and with the greatly extended samples being provided at @xmath239 by shanks at al . 2000 .    as to the shape of the lfs , we have shown in  2.1 that the statistics of the encounters naturally yields a double power - law",
    "_ broken _ from about @xmath240 toward the faint end , to @xmath241 and _ steeper _ at the bright end , in accord with the above data . but toward low @xmath19 a _ smoother _ overall shape is produced by the changing tilt @xmath171 given by eqs .",
    "( 3.6 ) ; this concurs with the enhancement of the bright end at @xmath242 erg / s provided by the additional feeding processes in the field discussed in  4 and shown in fig .",
    "2 . our result accords with the observations by la franca & cristiani ( 1997 ) and by goldschmidt & miller ( 1998 ) , which are confirmed by a recent survey being analyzed by cristiani and collaborators ( see grazian et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the above values and behaviors are given for the critical universe , see fig.2a ; but fig .",
    "2b shows that similar or better results obtain in a flat , low density cosmology .    from a different path",
    ", we agree with cattaneo , haehnelt & rees 1999 and kauffmann & haehnelt 1999 that strong qs evolution down to very low @xmath19 implies destabilization of substantial fractions of the gas stockpiled in the hosts .",
    "only a minor part of such gas ends up into accretion episodes ; the major part is likely to be heated and/or ejected , or used up to produce  over and above the quiescent star formation ",
    "star bursts specifically in the bright host galaxies , mostly ellipticals .",
    "but we see reasons why the le evolution component may be expected to slow down on approaching @xmath243 . for example , when interactions cause outright galaxy aggregations the host mass @xmath244 grows appreciably while its internal density @xmath245 decreases ; then it is easily checked that the scaling of @xmath162 includes the factors @xmath246 , giving rise to @xmath247 with @xmath248 .",
    "correspondingly , from eq . ( 2.4 ) the late evolution @xmath249 brakes into a softening exponential at low @xmath99 and @xmath19 .",
    "on the other hand , when it comes to faint agns at @xmath250 the situation becomes more complex , since the underlying bhs may be fed at low levels by various processes which superpose .",
    "we have explored in  4 and in fig .",
    "3 one such process , namely , the _ accretion _ of satellites with the associated gas supplies ; this contributes many more but weaker sources , in the range of the seyfert galaxies and below .",
    "these sources undergo a strong @xmath99-dependent de , similar to that observed in x - rays by miyaji , hasinger & schmidt ( 1998 ) ; many , in fact , will be more easily pinpointed in x - rays at @xmath251 erg / s or fainter .",
    "other feeding processes are conceivably provided by the self - destruction of giant nuclear star clusters ( see norman & scoville 1988 ) , and by internal instabilities and bar formation in disk galaxies ( see heller & shlosman 1994 , merritt 1998 , sellwood & moore 1998 ) .",
    "it will be interesting to see what specific shape and evolution are predicted for the lfs of agns fed in this latter fashion .",
    "here we focussed on _ dynamic _ losses of the gas angular momentum @xmath12 as primary triggers of the inflow eventually leading to bh accretion ; the gas may undergo other adventures before actually fueling the central bh , see e.g. siemiginowska & elvis ( 1997 ) . but the straight prediction from our study substantiating the outline by cavaliere & padovani ( 1989 ) , is that the emissions from the average qs or agn should go progressively _ sub - eddington _ later than @xmath22 , even at constant @xmath214 ; this accords with the data trend taking shape from various observational lines , see sun & malkan ( 1989 ) , haiman & menou ( 1998 ) , salucci et al .",

    "this is based on the intrinsically _ depleted _ accretion onto already existing , massive bhs which yields @xmath254 as discussed above ; the other factor is the related mass growth by the ratio @xmath255 , see cv98 .",
    "in fact , as outlined there and expanded elsewhere , by all episodes of rekindled accretion in the range @xmath256 the central bhs now dormant in most galaxies grow by an average factor @xmath257",
    ". this will be lower for hosts which are disk dominated at radii of a few kpcs , based on the values of @xmath258 indicated in  2.1 by case @xmath94 compared with case @xmath92 .",
    "otherwise , the factor will be limited by the bound @xmath259 set when a large central condensation enforces axial symmetry despite the dynamical perturbations .",
    "correspondingly , the local density of baryons collapsed into bhs amounts to @xmath260 gpc@xmath261 .",
    "these findings agree with the observational estimates of the central bh masses in many local galaxies given by richstone et al .",
    "1998 , and with the upper bounds set by magorrian et al . 1998 .    toward a comprehensive picture",
    ", we point out that the losses of @xmath12 during galaxy - galaxy interactions as here analyzed go back to dynamically generated _ asymmetries _ of the gravitational potential . compared with the major merging events during the build up of the spheroids ,",
    "these do not differ in kind , but only as for the lesser strength and as for their falling rate and decreasing gas amounts involved .",
    "so we conclude that most of the bright qs evolution can be understood in terms of _ one _ engine ( the accreting bh ) and _ one _ trigger ( dynamical destabilization of the gas ) , which however operate under _ two _ adjoining regimes geared to the development of cosmic structures . such regimes are related to the early , violent merging events when the gas - rich spheroids form ; and to the later , dwindling interactions of host galaxies in groups or even in the field , with the slow demise of galaxy formation magnified by the fast depletion of the gas supplies .",

    "<S> we derive quantitative predictions of the optical and x - ray luminosity functions for quasars in the redshift range @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> based on accreting black holes as primary sources for the quasar outputs , we investigate how the accretion is controlled by the surrounding structures , as these grow hierarchically from the formation of the host galaxies to their assemblage into poor and eventually into rich groups . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that for @xmath1 efficient black hole fueling is triggered by the encounters of a gas - rich host with its companions in a group ; these destabilize the gas and induce accretion , giving rise to the following features . </S>",
    "<S> the dispersion of the dynamical parameters in the encounters produces luminosity functions with the shape of a double power - law . </S>",
    "<S> strong luminosity evolution is produced as these encounters deplete the gas supply in the host ; an additional , milder density evolution obtains since the interactions become progressively rarer as the groups grow richer but less dense . </S>",
    "<S> we carry out these arguments to derive a specific model for the evolving luminosity functions . from the agreement with the optical and the x - ray data , </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the evolution of the bright quasars is driven by the development of cosmic structures in two ways . </S>",
    "<S> earlier than @xmath2 the gas - rich protogalaxies grow by merging , which also induces parallel growth of central holes accreting at their full eddington rates . in the later era of group assemblage </S>",
    "<S> the host encounters with companions drive onto already existing holes further but meager accretion ; these consume the gas reservoirs in the hosts , and cause supply - limited emissions which are intermittent , go progressively sub - eddington and peter out </S>",
    "<S> . then other fueling processes occurring in the field come to the foreground ; we specifically discuss the faint emissions , especially noticeable in x - rays , which are expected when hosts in the field cannibalize satellite galaxies with their meager gas contents . </S>"
