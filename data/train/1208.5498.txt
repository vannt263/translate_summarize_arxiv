    "one of the most intriguing questions in studies of the chemistry of the early solar system is whether , how , when and where complex organic and potentially prebiotic molecules are formed .",
    "one of the key species in this context is glycolaldehyde ( hcoch@xmath0oh ) .",
    "it is the simplest sugar and the first intermediate product in the formose reaction that begins with formaldehyde ( h@xmath0co ) and leads to the ( catalyzed ) formation of sugars and ultimately ribose , the backbone of rna , under early earth conditions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the presence of glycolaldehyde is therefore an important indication that the processes leading to biologically relevant molecules are taking place .",
    "however , the mechanism responsible for its formation in space is still unclear ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "glycolaldehyde has so - far been detected in two places in space  toward the galactic center source sgrb2(n ) ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) and the high - mass hot molecular core g31.41 + 0.31 @xcite .",
    "another compelling related discovery is that of ethylene glycol ( `` anti - freeze '' ; ( ch@xmath0oh)@xmath0 ) , the reduced alcohol variant of glycolaldehyde , found also toward sgrb2(n ) at comparable abundances @xcite .",
    "searches for glycolaldehyde in comets have so - far only resulted in upper limits , whereas ethylene glycol is detected toward hale - bopp and found to be at least 5 times more abundant than glycolaldehyde @xcite .",
    "comparisons between these species are therefore particularly interesting as their relative abundances potentially provide strong constraints on their formation and the chemical evolution from protostars to primitive solar system material .",
    "the protostellar ( class  0 ) binary iras16293 - 2422 ( iras16293 hereafter ) at a distance of 120  pc @xcite has long been considered to be the best low - mass protostellar testbed for astrochemical studies ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , a status that has been further bolstered by the detection of a wealth complex organic molecules toward this source @xcite .",
    "( sub)millimeter wavelength interferometric studies of its chemistry have revealed strong differentiation among different species toward the two components in the binary ( iras16293a and iras16293b ; @xcite ) including complex organic molecules @xcite .",
    "with the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) beginning operations a completely new opportunity has arisen for studies of the astrochemistry of solar - type stars .",
    "alma provides high sensitivity for faint lines , high spectral resolution which limits line confusion , and high angular resolution making it possible to study young stars on solar - system scales . in this letter",

    "excellent agreement is seen between the sma and alma spectra at the two continuum peaks with fluxes for bright lines agreeing to better than 1020% .",
    "this illustrates that the relative calibration of the two arrays is good but also , equally important , that the detected line emission is compact in both beams : the larger sma beam of 4@xmath2@xmath32.4@xmath2 does not pick up significant extended emission that may have been missed by alma .",

    ", the observed line strength would require an ethylene glycol abundance of 0.30.5 with respect to glycolaldehyde .",
    "this is comparable to the estimates by @xcite for sgrb2(n ) , but notably smaller than the inferred values from comet hale - bopp where ethylene glycol is at least five times more abundant than glycolaldehyde @xcite .",

    "also , if ascribed to c - c@xmath1h@xmath0 , this emission would be red - shifted by about 2  km  s@xmath5 which should be easily discernable toward iras16293b .",
    "likewise the transitions at 220.196  ghz could also be attributed to a vinyl cyanide ( ch@xmath0chcn ) line at 220.1964  ghz . however",
    ", this species would have a much stronger transition at 220.138  ghz that is not seen .    a strong confirmation of the identification of glycolaldehyde is provided by the 690  ghz observations .",
    "a large number of glycolaldehyde transitions are expected to be located in this band with a range of energy levels and line strengths .",
    "the model based on the 220  ghz data predicts that a number of these transitions are becoming optically thick ( @xmath57 averaged over the 0.5@xmath2 region used for the column density estimates ) .",
    "[ band9 ] shows the spectra toward the iras16293b continuum peak as well as offset by one synthesized beam for the lines expected to be most optically thick . toward the continuum peak ,",
    "the 7 most optically thick transitions all show red - shifted absorption against the iras16293b continuum whereas they are seen in emission at the offset position . again",
    ", these lines show a nearly perfect correspondance to the expected systemic velocity of 2.7  km  s@xmath5 . equally important",
    ", the models do not predict other lines of glycolaldehyde that should be detectable elsewhere in the large 690 ghz spectral window at the sensitivity of the observations , nor in the 220 ghz window .",
    "the absence of emission toward the continuum peak for iras16293b suggests that the continuum is completely optically thick at these high frequencies and scales ( 0.25@xmath2 ; 30  au diameter ) .",
    "this is consistent with the observations of @xcite who showed that the continuum at centimeter wavelengths was due to optically thick thermal dust emission at the same scales ( 0.150.25@xmath2 ) .",
    "the fact that glycolaldehyde and other complex species show infall signatures toward source b ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) implies that these molecules are moving toward the planet - forming zones at @xmath58 30 au radius .",
    "the main uncertainty in the assignments is the accuracy and completeness of the spectroscopic catalogs .",
    "about one third of the lines brighter than about 0.1  jy  beam@xmath5 remain unidentified in the 220  ghz spectrum and other possible assignments for the potential glycolaldehyde lines can thus not be ruled out .",
    "also , not all glycolaldehyde line frequencies have been measured directly in the laboratory , especially for the vibrationally excited states detected here and for the lines at 690 ghz , but are based on a spectroscopic model using measurements at other frequencies . however , since the laboratory data cover lines up to 1.2  thz and include other vibrationally excited lines with a similar range of @xmath59 and @xmath60 values as observed here , the frequency predictions should be reliable .",
    "indeed , their quoted uncertainties are lower than what can be discerned in our data .",
    "a check can be made by comparing the frequencies from the jpl and cdms catalogs which have been computed using slightly different methods and datasets .",
    "for the lines detected in the alma spectra , the agreement between the frequencies is about 0.2  mhz  corresponding to @xmath61  0.1  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "thus , within the uncertainties given in the catalogs the identification of lines are secure .",
    "also , the relative column density ( or abundance ) of methyl formate to glycolaldehyde of 1015 is consistent with previous measurements ( see also   [ chemistry ] ) and , combined with the additional high frequency detections and the close matches in velocity for 13 lines , provide a compelling case for the assignments .",
    "we stress that iras16293b with its narrow line widths provides a much cleaner source for identification of complex species than high mass sources like sgrb2(n ) that have been studied so far .",
    "future searches with alma will be able to further strengthen the assignments either by extending the number of lines or searching for specific spectroscopic signatures ",
    "e.g. , those provided by the low excitation @xmath62 transitions used for previous detections at 3  mm .",
    "the similar spectral shapes of the lines of the complex organic molecules ( in particular , the line widths and the absorption profiles toward iras16293b ) as well as their similar spatial extent suggest that methyl formate , glycolaldehyde and other species coexist in the same gas .",
    "furthermore , methyl formate and glycolaldehyde are fit by similar excitation temperatures in our simple lte models .",
    "therefore , a discussion of the chemical relation between glycolaldehyde and methyl formate is relevant .",
    "our results indicate that methyl formate is a factor 1015 more abundant than glycolaldehyde in the warm gas toward the two binary components of iras16293 - 2422 .",
    "this value is consistent with previous measurements ranging from 52 in the hot core of sgrb2(n ) @xcite and the upper limit of 34 in g34.41 + 0.31 @xcite to the average of 56.5 found on more extended scales toward sgrb2(n ) @xcite .",
    "relative to the lower limit on the h@xmath0 column density from the optically thick dust continuum emission toward iras16293b @xcite and taking into account the filling factor , the two species are estimated to have abundances relative to h@xmath0 of 8@xmath63 ( methyl formate ) and 6@xmath64 ( glycolaldehyde ) .",
    "one of the major discussions concerning the origin of complex organic molecules in space is whether these form from second generation gas - phase reactions based on protonated ch@xmath1oh ( released from ices at high temperatures ) or due to first generation reactions in the icy grain mantles , possibly induced by uv- or cosmic - ray irradiation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "grain - surface reactions are becoming increasingly more popular , especially since the formation of methyl formate through gas - phase reactions seems to be too inefficient to explain the observed abundances @xcite .",
    "@xcite compared a survey of the glycolaldehyde emission toward sgrb2(n ) with formaldehyde ( h@xmath0co ) , motivated by the first step in the formose reaction consisting of two h@xmath0co molecules combining to form hcoch@xmath0oh .",
    "modeling the emission from h@xmath0c@xmath65o transitions detected in our sma survey with the same excitation temperature as for methyl formate and glycolaldehyde suggests a formaldehyde to glycolaldehyde abundance ratio of 4256 ( using a @xmath66o:@xmath65o abundance ratio of 560 characteristic for the local ism @xcite ) .",
    "this is in agreement with the estimate by @xcite of a ratio of 27 in sgrb2(n ) .",
    "@xcite interpreted this ratio in favor of the formation of glycolaldehyde in space through a gas - phase formose reaction . however , as pointed out by @xcite this and other gas - phase reactions tend to produce too little glycolaldehyde compared to observed abundances in an absolute sense .",
    "alternatively glycolaldehyde may be formed through grain - surface reactions in ices rich in methanol ( ch@xmath1oh ) or its derivatives . from laboratory experiments @xcite found that photochemistry of uv - irradiated methanol ices mixed with significant amounts of co can explain the observed fractions of oxygen - rich complex organics like methyl formate relative to methanol in sources such as iras16293 @xcite .",
    "although @xcite could not fully separate glycolaldehyde and methyl formate in their methanol - rich experiments , the derived lower limits on their abundances in co - containing ices relative to methanol are 4% and 8% , respectively , consistent with the combined iras16293 results of @xcite and those found here of @xmath67% and 1020% .",
    "also , their upper limit of ethylene glycol relative to glycolaldehyde ( @xmath6125% ) agrees roughly with our ratio of 0.30.5 .",
    "experiments with irradiation of pure ch@xmath1oh ices on the other hand produce too large ethylene glycol abundances relative to glycolaldehyde by an order of magnitude .",
    "the ch@xmath1oh : co ratio is clearly critical : laboratory results for the ch@xmath1oh : co=1:10 mixtures show a 4 times larger abundance of glycolaldehyde relative to ethanol , whereas the ethanol lines detected here and in the previous sma observations @xcite suggests that ethanol is 35 times more abundant than glycolaldehyde in iras16293 . as pointed out by @xcite the relative abundances of some species",
    "also strongly depend on the ice temperature , with the glycolaldehyde and ethylene glycol production requiring heating above @xmath6830 k. thus , both exact ice composition ( amount of co mixed with ch@xmath1oh ) and temperature play a role in the chemistry ; a combination of a moderately co - rich ice and mild heating best reproduce the current data .",
    "still , additional systematic surveys of more species and sources are needed to constrain the surface formation mechanisms in more detail .",
    "these early data illustrate the enormous potential of alma for doing this .",
    "the current sensitivity is already more than an order of magnitude better than that of previous single - dish or interferometric line surveys toward this source @xcite , revealing a line density toward iras16293b nearly ten times higher than before .",
