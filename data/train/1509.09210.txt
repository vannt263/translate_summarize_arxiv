    "the aim of this paper is to contribute towards a solution of stanley s question of whether there exist two non - isomorphic trees with the same chromatic symmetric function .",
    "the @xmath0-polynomial ( introduced by noble and welsh @xcite ) and the chromatic symmetric function @xmath3 ( introduced by stanley @xcite ) of a graph @xmath4 are powerful graph isomorphism invariants .",
    "they encode much of the combinatorics of the given graph .",
    "in particular , many other well - known invariants such as the tutte polynomial and the chromatic polynomial can be obtained as evaluations of them .",
    "the main problem about any graph invariant is to understand which classes of graph it distinguishes .",
    "one way of approaching this problem is by finding graphs with the same invariant . for the chromatic symmetric function",
    ", such examples already appear in @xcite . for the @xmath0-polynomial , by results of sarmiento @xcite , one checks",
    "that work of brylawski @xcite in the context of the polychromate provides such examples .",
    "however , the following question by stanley @xcite remains unsolved .",
    "do there exist non - isomorphic trees with the same chromatic symmetric function ?",
    "we note that it is well known that stanley s question is equivalent to the similar question for the @xmath0-polynomial , since , when restricted to trees , the chromatic symmetric function and the @xmath0-polynomial determine each other ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 6.1 ) ) .",
    "this means , in particular , that any statement related to the chromatic symmetric function of a tree can be rewritten in terms of the @xmath0-polynomial . in this article",
    ", we prefer to write everything in terms of the @xmath0-polynomial .",
    "there are several special classes of trees where the restriction of stanley s question has as solution . in @xcite ,",
    "martin , morin and wagner showed that the @xmath0-polynomial distinguishes spider trees and a subclass of caterpillars ( they also showed how to compute much of the combinatorics of a tree from the coefficients of its @xmath0-polynomial ) . in @xcite",
    ", the first and third author showed that the @xmath0-polynomial distinguishes the larger class of all proper caterpillars .",
    "it is still unknown to the authors whether the @xmath0-polynomial distinguishes non - proper caterpillars . in a different direction , in @xcite , orellana and",
    "scott showed how to reconstruct a tree from a _ labeled _ version of the @xmath5-polynomial , provided the tree has a unique vertex as a centroid ( the centroid and the @xmath5-polynomial are defined later on in this article , for the meaning of what labeled means in this context , we refer the reader directly to @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , in @xcite , smith , smith and tian have extended orellana and scott s results to show that a _ labeled _ version of the @xmath6-polynomial suffices to reconstruct any tree .",
    "finally , loebl and sereni @xcite have developed some techniques for constructing families of weighted graphs that are distinguished by the @xmath7-polynomial , which is the weighted version of the @xmath0-polynomial .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a restricted version of the @xmath0-polynomial , which we call the @xmath1-polynomial for any fixed integer @xmath2 .",
    "our main result is to exhibit examples of non - isomorphic trees with the same @xmath1-polynomial for every @xmath2 .",
    "one of the motivations for this work comes from orellana and scott s results , in the sense that our examples could shed some light about possible obstructions for extending orellana and scott s results into a solution of the stanley s question .",
    "this is emphasized by the fact that our examples generalize some of the examples already found in @xcite ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "let us note that smith , smith and tian @xcite have found , with the aid of the computer , the smallest pairs of non - isomorphic trees with the same @xmath1-polynomial for @xmath8 .",
    "in order to construct our examples , we reduce the problem to finding solutions of an old problem in number theory known as the _ prouhet - tarry - escott problem _ ( pte problem for short ) . given @xmath2 be a positive integer , we ask whether there exist integer sequences @xmath9 and @xmath10 , distinct up to permutation , such that @xmath11 if @xmath12 and @xmath13 are solutions for this problem for some @xmath14 , we denote it by @xmath15 for short .",
    "we call @xmath2 the _ degree _ of the solution and the length the sequences its _ size _ ( note that some terms could be zero ) .",
    "the history of the pte problem probably goes back to euler and goldbach ( 1750 - 51 ) who noted that @xmath16 independently , prouhet ( 1851 ) and tarry and escott ( 1910 ) showed that that for every @xmath2 there are solutions to the pte - problem . for more history and results related to the pte problem",
    ", we refer to the reader @xcite .",
    "we also note that once one solution for the pte problem has been found , many other _ equivalent _ solutions can be easily constructed .",
    "this follows from the fact that , if @xmath15 and @xmath17 is an affine transformation with integer coefficients , then it is easy to check that @xmath18 . for convenience ,",
    "we usually write @xmath19 instead of @xmath20 . for instance , if @xmath15 , then @xmath21 and @xmath22 for every integer @xmath23 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "background and statement of the main results is done in section  [ sec : back ] while section 3 and 4 are devoted to the proofs .",
    "in this section we recall the definitions of the @xmath0-polynomial and then state our results",
    ". it will be convenient to first recall the definition of the @xmath7-polynomial for weighted graphs . given a graph @xmath4 , a _ weight function _ is a map @xmath24 from the vertices of @xmath4 to the positive integers . a _ weighted graph _ is a graph @xmath4 endowed with a weight function @xmath24 , denoted by @xmath25 .",
    "the @xmath7-polynomial of a weighted graph was introduced in @xcite by means of a _ deletion - contraction _ formula .",
    "four our purposes , it is easier to use its states model representation ( see ( * ? ? ? * theorem 4.3 ) ) as a definition .",
    "we need some notation first .",
    "let @xmath25 be a weighted graph with @xmath26 .",
    "the number of connected components of @xmath4 is denoted by @xmath27 . given @xmath28 , the restriction @xmath29 of @xmath4 to @xmath30",
    "is obtained by deleting every edge that is not contained in @xmath30 ( but keeping all the vertices ) .",
    "the _ rank _ of @xmath30 , denoted by @xmath31 , is defined as @xmath32 the _ partition _ induced by @xmath30 , denoted by @xmath33 , is the partition of @xmath34 determined by the total weight of the vertices in each connected component of @xmath29 .",
    "when @xmath4 is clear from the context , we write @xmath35 and @xmath31 instead of @xmath33 and @xmath36 .",

    "the _ @xmath7-polynomial _ of @xmath25 is defined as @xmath40 if @xmath4 is a ( unweighted ) graph , then the _ @xmath0-polynomial _ of @xmath4 is defined as the @xmath7-polynomial of @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the weight function that gives weight @xmath43 to each vertex of @xmath4 . here",
    ", @xmath35 reduces to the partition induced by the number of vertices on each connected component of @xmath29 .    in what follows",
    ", all graphs are assumed to be trees . in this case , it is easy to check that @xmath44 for every @xmath28 .",
    "it follows that the @xmath0-polynomial of a tree @xmath45 can be rewritten as @xmath46 in this note , we focus on the following restricted - version of the @xmath0-polynomial .",
    "given a positive integer @xmath2 , let @xmath47 that is , we restrict the cardinality of the edge sets appearing in the definition of the @xmath0-polynomial . of course , if @xmath48 , then @xmath49 .",
    "the main goal of this note is to exhibit examples of non - isomorphic trees with the same @xmath1-polynomial for any given @xmath2 .",
    "to do so , we first introduce a new class of trees encoded by non - negative integer sequences . as a convention , the term _ @xmath50-star",
    "_ will refer to a star @xmath51 with @xmath50 vertices , and the term _",
    "@xmath50-path _ will refer to a path with @xmath50 vertices .    given two non - negative integers @xmath52 and @xmath53 , the tree @xmath54 is the tree formed by taking @xmath52 disjoint copies of a @xmath55-path and @xmath53 disjoint copies of a @xmath55-star , and then identifying one leaf - vertex of each copy into a common vertex @xmath56 .",
    "the vertex @xmath56 is considered as the root of @xmath54 .",
    "note that @xmath57 consists of an isolated vertex @xmath56 ( see figure [ fig : b ] for an example ) .",
    "next , given two sequences @xmath58 and @xmath59 of non - negative integers with length @xmath60 , the tree @xmath61 is constructed as follows .",

    "this yields @xmath61 .",
    "the subgraph induced on the vertices @xmath66 will be referred to as the _ core _ of @xmath61 .",
    "it is easy to see that the core is isomorphic to a @xmath67-star ( see also figure [ fig : b ] for an example ) .     and @xmath68 have the same @xmath5-polynomial but distinct @xmath6-polynomial .",
