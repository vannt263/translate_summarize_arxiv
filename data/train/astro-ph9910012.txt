    "x - ray transient source grs 1915 + 105 in our galaxy exhibits various types of quasi - periodic oscillations with frequencies ranging from @xmath2 to @xmath3 ( morgan et al , 1997 ; paul et al .",
    "1998 ; yadav et al .",
    "the object is sometimes in a flaring state with regular and quasi - regular bursts and quiescences , while at some other time it is in usual low - hard and high - soft states .",
    "while the light curves look very chaotic with no apparent similarity between observations in two different days , some of the features are classifiable : ( a ) low - frequency qpo ( @xmath4hz ) is due to the transition between burst and quiescence states ( which we term as ` on'-state and ` off'-state respectively ) and vice versa ; ( b ) the intermediate frequency qpo ( @xmath5hz ) could be due to oscillations of shocks located at tens to hundreds of schwarzschild radii @xmath6 ( @xmath7 is the schwarzschild radius . here , @xmath8 is the mass of the black hole , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are the gravitational constant and velocity of light respectively ) and ( c ) very high frequency qpo ( @xmath11hz ) , if at all present , could be due to oscillations of the shocks located at several @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath12 is generally observed during quiescence states .",
    "typically , a shock located at @xmath13 ( unless mentioned otherwise , measured hereafter in units of @xmath6 ) , produces an oscillation of frequency , @xmath14 where , @xmath15 is the compression ratio of the gas at the shock .",
    "here we used a result of molteni , sponholz & chakrabarti ( 1996 , hereafter referred to as msc96 ) which states that the time - period of qpo oscillation is comparable to the infall time ( @xmath16 ) in the post - shock region .",
    "however , we assume now that the post - shock velocity is not necessarily @xmath17 dependent as in a free fall but could be slowly varying , especially when angular momentum is high . in this case ,",
    "clearly , @xmath19 for a low angular momentum freely falling matter and @xmath20 for a post - shock flow of constant velocity @xmath21 . here",
    "@xmath22 is a dimensionless quantity which is exactly unity for a free - fall gas . for a gas of @xmath23 , @xmath24 and for @xmath25 , @xmath26 , when the shock is strong .",
    "thus , for instance , for a @xmath27hz , @xmath28 for @xmath29 and @xmath23 . for @xmath30hz , @xmath31 for the same parameters . msc96 and chakrabarti & titarchuk ( 1995 , hereafter ct95 ) postulated that since black hole qpos show a large amount of photon flux variation , they can not be explained simply by assuming some inhomogeinities , or perturbations in the flow .",
    "if the qpos are really due to shock oscillations , they should almost disappear at low energy soft x - rays , since these x - rays are produced in pre - shock flow which does not participate in large - scale oscillations .",
    "second , a shock - compressed gas with compression ratio @xmath32 , must produce outflows or extended corona which pass through sonic points located at at @xmath33 , where @xmath34 , if the flow is assumed to be isothermal till @xmath35 ( chakrabarti 1998 , 1999 , hereafter c98 and c99 respectively ) . in this solution the location of the sonic point @xmath35 and ratio between outflow and inflow rates",
    "are functions of the compression ratio @xmath15 of the shock alone .",
    "till the sonic point @xmath35 , matter is subsonic and this subsonic volume is filled in a time of ( c99 ) , @xmath36 where , @xmath37 is the average density of the sonic sphere , and @xmath38 is the outflow rate . the compton cooling becomes catastrophic when @xmath39 , @xmath40 is the thomson scattering opacity .",
    "thus the duration of the off - state ( i.e. , duration between the end of a burst and the beginning of the next burst ) is given by , @xmath41 we use now a simple relation between inflow and outflow rates given by ( c98 , c99 ) , @xmath42^{3/2 } exp   ( \\frac{3}{2 } - \\frac{r^2}{r-1 } ) \\eqno{(4)}\\ ] ] where , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the solid angles of the inflow and the outflow respectively . because of the uncertainties in @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 ( subscript ` in ' refers to the accretion rate )",
    "we define a dimensionless parameter , @xmath46 where , @xmath47 is the eddington rate . using eqs . ( 4 - 5 ) , we get the following expression for @xmath48 as , @xmath49 or , eliminating shock location @xmath13 using eq .",
    "( 1 ) and @xmath50 , @xmath51 , we obtain , @xmath52 for an average shock of strength @xmath53 , the result is insensitive to the compression ratio . using average value of @xmath54 and for @xmath55 ( which corresponds to @xmath56 eddington rate for @xmath57 ) we get , @xmath58",
    "thus , the duration of the off - state must go down rapidly as the qpo frequency increases if the flow geometry and the net accretion rate remains fixed . when one considers a constant velocity post - shock flow , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 ( chosen so as to keep the same numerical coefficient as in eq .",
    "8) the above equation is changed to , @xmath61 interestingly , @xmath60 ( i.e. , a constant velocity of seven percent of the velocity of light ) is very reasonable for a black hole accretion .",
    "if the hot post - shock gas of height @xmath62 intercepts @xmath63 soft photons per second , from the pre - shock keplerian component ( ct95 ) , it should intercept about @xmath64 soft photons per second when the sonic sphere of size @xmath35 is filled in .",
    "thus , the photon flux in the burst state should be about @xmath65 times larger compared to the photon flux in off - state .",
    "depending on the degree of flaring , and the fact that the wind is bent backward due to centrifugal force , the interception may be higher .",
    "since @xmath66 is basically due to recurrences of on and off - states , it is clear that @xmath67 . here",
    ", @xmath68 is the duration of the burst state which may be very small for extremely regular ( spiky ) bursts reported by in taam , chen & swank ( 1997 ) and yadav et al .",
    "1999 . in this case , @xmath69 when on - state has a non - negligible duration ( @xmath70 ) , it is found to be directly related to the @xmath48 ( belloni et al .",
    ", 1997 ; yadav et al .",
    "assuming @xmath71 , the @xmath66 would be less by a factor of two when on states are broad .",
    "when the burst is very regular but ` spiky ' ( i.e. , with momentary on - state ) , @xmath72 .",
    "the presence of @xmath66 for these regular ` spiky ' bursts are reported in manickam and chakrabarti ( 1999a )    thus , if our shock oscillation solution for qpo is correct , the observations must pass all the following tests : ( a ) the qpo in the off - state must disappear at low energies ,",
    "( b ) the qpo must generally be absent in the on - state , when the sonic sphere is cooled down , ( c ) the intermediate qpo frequency must be correlated with @xmath48 as in eqs .",
    "( 8 - 9 ) and ( d ) the photon flux must jump at least a factor of @xmath73 or more when going from quiescence to burst state . in addition , ( e ) lowest frequency @xmath66 observed must be correlated to the intermediate qpo frequency @xmath12 by eq .",
    "there are uncertainties regarding the inflow velocity and actual volume - filling time , but we expect that above relations to be satisfied in general .    in the present _ letter _",
    "we show that observations do pass through these tests and therefore the shock oscillation model may be the correct picture . in the next section , we present detailed analysis of some of the observational results on grs1915 + 105 available in public archive and show how they point to the shock oscillation model . finally in  3 , we make concluding remarks .",
    "figure 1 shows a light curve of the first phase of observation of june 18th , 1997 , on the right panel .",
    "the average count rate ( per second ) vary from around @xmath74 in the off - state to about @xmath75 in the on - state .",
    "the ratio of the fluxes is about @xmath76 .",
    "the duration of these states vary chaotically . at the mean location of a few off - states ( arrows on right axis ) , observation time",
    "is marked in seconds .",
    "for each of these off - states , the power density spectrum ( pds ) in arbitrary units is drawn in the left panel .",
    "the most prominent qpo frequencies ( @xmath12 in our notation ) are connected by a dashed curve just to indicate its variation with time .",
    "there are some weaker peaks which follow the short dashed curve , indicating that they may be higher harmonics .",
    "observations of this kind for several other days show similar variations in qpo frequencies and details are presented elsewhere ( manickam & chakrabarti , 1999ab ) .    in figure 2 ,",
    "variation of @xmath12 with the duration @xmath48 of the off - states ( triangles ) for the whole observation period on june 18th , 1997 in the log - log scale .",
    "observational results from several other days ( may 26th , 1997 ; june 9th , 1997 ; june 25 , 1997 ; october 7th , 1996 ; october 25th , 1996 )",
    "are also plotted on the same curve with circles , filled squares , squares , filled circles and stars respectively .",
    "we did not put error bars since in duration scale is it uniformly @xmath77 seconds , and in frequency scale error bar is decided by the chosen bin - size while obtaining the pds ( in our analysis it remains around 0.15 - 0.25 hz , increasing monotonically with qpo frequency ) .",
    "times at which the photon flux is halved during the on - to - off and off - to - on transitions are taken respectively to be the beginning and the end of an off - state . equation ( 9 ) is plotted in dashed lines with ( from uppermost to the lowermost line ) @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 respectively indicating a slow variation of the accretion rate , provided the collimation property remains the same .",
    "two dotted curves , on the other hand , represent eq .",
    "( 8) , with @xmath84 ( top ) and @xmath85 ( bottom ) respectively .",
    "we find that the inverse - squared law ( eq .",
    "9 ) may be a better fit to the observations . since on oct .",
    "7th , 1996 the points are lumped closed to the lower right corner , not much could be said about whether it follows our relation or not , but it is to be noted that its general behaviour ( low frequency , high duration ) follows our result for any reasonable @xmath86 .",
    "table 1 shows the variation of the @xmath12 ( taken from fig .",
    "2 ) with days of observations . in 3rd column ,",
    "the expected @xmath66 has been put ( @xmath87 for oct .",
    "7 and june 18 results as they show @xmath88 ) . in 4th column , the observed @xmath66 is given .",
    "generally , what we observe is that , when the drift of @xmath12 is large , pds around @xmath66 is also broad in any case , observed @xmath66 agrees with our expectations .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     figure 3 shows the pds of the off - state centered at 1576s ( see fig .",
    "1 ) of the june 18th observation .",
    "the energy range is given in each panel clearly , qpo disappears completely at low energies , exactly as is expected in the shock oscillation model ( msc96 ) though qpo frequencies , when present , seem to be energy independent ( see , manickam & chakrabarti , 1999b for details ) .",
    "the pre - shock flow which emits soft radiation participates little in the oscillation as the _ fractional change _ in the keplerian disk due to shock oscillation is negligible . on the contrary , the _ fractional change _ in the size of the post - shock flow during the oscillation is large .",
    "thus , the flux of hard x - rays oscillates as the size of the post - shock region oscillates .",
    "this is the cause of qpo in our model . in on - states , when they exist , the qpo is found to be very weak .",
    "in this _ letter _ , we have discovered a relation between the qpo frequency in 1 - 10hz range with the duration of the quiescence state at which the qpo is observed .",
    "we also derived a relation between the low qpo frequency and the intermediate qpo frequency .",
    "we analyzed several days of rxte observations and showed that our relations are satisfied , especially when the average bulk velocity in the post - shock region is constant .",
    "we showed that the qpo disappears in the low energy , but is very strong in high energies .",
    "the photon flux is found to fluctuate , typically by a factor of @xmath73 or more , indicating that a vertically inflated post - shock region is responsible for interception of the soft photons from a keplerian disk .",
    "this factor seems to be similar to @xmath89 ( c98 , c99 ) for any reasonable compression of the gas , which strengthens our belief that the quasi - periodic cooling of the sonic sphere of the outflow from the post - shock region may be responsible for the rapid transitions between on and off - states .",
    "our computation of the duration of the off - states from this considerations are found to be quite reasonable .",
    "we find that for @xmath90 law , @xmath48 is insensitive to the mass of the black hole while for @xmath91 law , @xmath48 is inversely proportional to the mass .",
    "trudolyubov et al .",
    "( 1999 ) recently found the duration of ` hard ' states varies as @xmath92 power of the _ lowest centroid frequency _ for a _ group _ of data while we find an inverse - squared law when we choose the qpo frequency where the power is strongest .",
    "although we chose a specific model for the outflow ( c99 ) for concreteness , the physical processes invoked are generic and the explanation should be valid even when other models for outflows are used ( except self - similar models )",
    ". the shock location near the inner edge of the keplerian disk can drift on viscous time scale ( see appendix of ct95 where the transition from keplerian to sub - keplerian is plotted as a function of viscosity ) .",
    "the shocks can evacuate the disk , and form once again , very similar to what was seen in the numerical simulation of ryu et al .",
    "this drift would cause a drift in frequency as trudolyubov et al .",
    "( 1999 ) recently showed ( see also , belloni et al .",
    "1997 ; markwardt , swank & taam 1999 , muno et al .",
    "our model invokes also outflows ( which we believe form naturally in the post - shock region and from the transition region from keplerian to a sub - keplerian flow ) which we find useful to explain variations in photon counts between ` off ' and ` on ' states .",
    "this work is partly supported by a project ( quasi periodic oscillations in black hole candidates ) funded by indian space research organization ( isro ) .",
    "the authors thank nasa for making rxte data available and isro for creating a data bank at their centre where these data are stored .",
