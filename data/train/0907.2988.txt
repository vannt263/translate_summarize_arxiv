    "technicolor is an attractive idea in which electroweak symmetry is dynamically broken by a strong dynamics operating around the tev energy scale  @xcite .",
    "the big hierarchy , @xmath2 , is elegantly explained by the very same reason as @xmath3 .",
    "however , it is well - known that there are two phenomenological difficulties in this idea .",
    "one is that the electroweak precision measurements seem to prefer scenarios with a weakly coupled light higgs boson  @xcite .",
    "another is the difficulty in writing down the yukawa interactions to generate fermion masses in the standard model .    after the lep - i experiments , supersymmetry ( susy )",
    "has become very popular as a natural scenario for the light weakly coupled higgs boson .",
    "however , with the experimental bound on the lightest higgs boson mass from the lep - ii experiments , parameters in the minimal susy standard model ( mssm ) are required to be more and more fine - tuned , at least in the conventional scenarios  @xcite .",
    "in this situation , it may be interesting to ( re)consider a hybrid of technicolor and susy along the similar spirit of the early attempts of susy model building  @xcite .",
    "we assume that strong dynamics breaks susy at the multi  tev energy scale ( which we call the scale @xmath4 ) , with electroweak symmetry breaking triggered by the dynamics through direct couplings between the higgs field and the dynamical sector .",
    "this scenario has several virtues : ( 1 ) the yukawa interactions can be written down by assuming an existence of elementary higgs fields in the uv theory , which mix with ( or remain as ) the higgs field to break electroweak symmetry at low energy  @xcite ; ( 2 ) the hierarchy problem , @xmath5 , is explained by dynamical susy breaking  @xcite ; ( 3 ) one can hope that the little hierarchy , @xmath6 , is explained by either susy or some other mechanisms such as the higgs boson as the pseudo - nambu - goldstone particle in the strong dynamics  @xcite ; ( 4 ) the cosmological gravitino problem is absent  @xcite ; ( 5 ) one can expect additional contributions to the higgs boson mass from the susy breaking sector , with which the mass bound from the lep - ii experiments can be evaded  @xcite ; and ( 6 ) , there is an interesting possibility that the lhc experiments can probe the susy breaking dynamics directly .",
    "susy is phenomenologically motivated from the point ( 1 ) ( and also ( 6 ) ) in this framework in addition to the connection to string theory .",
    "although the tev - scale susy breaking scenario is an interesting possibility , an explicit model realizing this scenario will not be attempted here . in this paper , we take a less ambitious approach and construct an effective lagrangian for the scenario without specifying ( while hoping for the existence of ) a uv theory responsible for susy breaking and its mediation .    in constructing the effective lagrangian , we take the following as organizing principles : ( 1 ) the lagrangian possesses non - linearly realized supersymmetry ; ( 2 ) the quarks / leptons and gauge fields are only weakly coupled to the susy breaking sector , so that the typical mass splitting between bosons and fermions are @xmath7  gev ( in other words , the matter and gauge fields are introduced as superfields which transform linearly under susy ) ; and ( 3 ) the higgs boson is introduced as a non - linearly transforming field because it is assumed to be directly coupled to the susy breaking sector .",
    "the higgsino field is absent in the minimal model .    in this higgsinoless model ,",
    "the higgs potential receives quadratic divergences from loop diagrams with the gauge interactions and the higgs quartic interaction although the top - quark loops can be cancelled by the loops of the scalar top quarks as usual .",
    "the rough estimate of the correction to the higgs boson mass is of the order of @xmath8 and @xmath9 with @xmath10 being the coupling constant of the higgs quartic interaction . by comparing with the quadratic term needed for electroweak symmetry breaking , @xmath11 ,",
    "naturalness suggests @xmath12 ( a few )  @xmath13  tev .",
    "precision electroweak constraints , on the other hand , obtained from the lep - ii and slc experiments do not generically allow such a low scale without fine - tuning @xcite .",
    "the dynamical scale may therefore have to be larger , @xmath14 . to obtain a light higgs boson at this larger scale either requires fine - tuning , or some new weakly coupled new physics below @xmath4 .",
    "( or simply the higgsino appears around a few tev . ) it is also true that the direct coupling to the dynamical sector generically gives the higgs boson mass to be @xmath15 .",
    "we may therefore need to assume that the higgs boson is somewhat special in the dynamics , e.g. , a pseudo - goldstone boson . in this paper",
    "we simply ignore the issue because its resolution depends on the uv completion , and here we only concerned with the effective theory below the tev scale .",
    "the stop potential also receives quadratic divergences , in this case from a loop diagram involving the higgs boson ( and proportional to @xmath16 ) .",
    "this divergence is not cancelled , simply because the higgsinos are not present in the low energy theory .",
    "one therefore expects the stops to have a mass no smaller than a loop factor below the scale @xmath4 .",
    "the lagrangian we construct needs to contain interaction terms among superfields and also partnerless fields such as the higgs boson . since these two kinds of fields are defined on different spaces ",
    "one superspace and the other the usual minkowski space ",
    "one needs to convert the partnerless fields into superfields or vice - versa .",
    "one approach is to utilize established formulations for constructing superfields out of partnerless fields  @xcite where the goldstino field is also promoted to a superfield . in this paper",
    ", we present a simple manifestly supersymmetric formulation where we do not try to convert partnerless fields into superfields , although it is totally equivalent to the known formalisms .",
    "the essence is to prepare two kinds of spaces : the superspace and the minkowski space , on which superfields and partnerless fields are defined . by embedding the minkowski space into the superspace by using a susy invariant map ,",
    "one can define a lagrangian density on a single space - time . by using the formalism",
    ", one can write down a susy invariant lagrangian , in particular the yukawa interactions , only with a single higgs field .",
    "we also find that the coupling constant of the higgs quartic interaction can be a free parameter , unrelated to the gauge coupling constant .",
    "therefore , the higgs boson mass can be treated as a free parameter in this model .    as a related topic , a model",
    "in which the mssm is only partly supersymmetric has been proposed in ref .",
    "there susy is broken explicitly at the planck scale , and only the higgs sector is remained to be supersymmetric which is made possible by a warped extra - dimension ( or a conformal dynamics ) .",
    "our philosophy is opposite to that and is , relatively speaking , closer to ref .",
    "@xcite by the same authors , where susy is broken on the ir brane ( or equivalently by some strong dynamics at the @xmath17 scale ) .    as a possible signature of the tev - scale dynamics ,",
    "we construct a model `` hidden gravity , '' which is an analogy of the hidden local symmetry @xcite in the chiral lagrangian .",
    "the hidden local symmetry is a manifestly chiral symmetric model to describe the vector resonance ( the @xmath18 meson ) as the gauge boson of the hidden vectorial su(2 ) symmetry ( the unbroken symmetry of the chiral lagrangian ) .",
    "when we apply this technique to susy , we obtain a supersymmetric lagrangian for a massive spin - two field which is introduced as a graviton associated with a hidden general covariance because the unbroken symmetry is the poincar ' e symmetry .",
    "one can consistently incorporate the resonance as a non - strongly coupled field for a range of parameters and small range of energy .",
    "indeed , we show that there is a sensible parameter region where we can perform a perturbative calculation of the resonant single - graviton production cross section . at energies not far above the graviton mass",
    "the effective theory becomes strongly coupled and incalculable .",
    "if the graviton is much lighter than the cut - off scale , new physics is required to complete the theory up to @xmath4 , another direction not pursued here .",
    "we discuss signatures of this graviton scenario at the lhc .",
    "in this section we present a method to construct a lagrangian invariant under the non - linearly realized global supersymmetry .",
    "we will introduce the higgs boson as a non - linearly transforming field ( which we call a non - linear field ) and also matter and gauge fields as superfields .",
    "we therefore need a formulation to write down a supersymmetric lagrangian where both kinds of fields are interacting .",
    "ro@xmath19ek  @xcite , ivanov and kapustnikov @xcite , and samuel and wess  @xcite have established a superfield formalism of non - linear susy by upgrading the goldstino fermion and other non - linear fields to constrained superfields .",
    "( see @xcite for a recent work . )",
    "although the formalism is somewhat complicated , using superfields is motivated there as a first step towards embedding the theory into supergravity .",

    "when all the mass scales are comparable and @xmath279 no one decay mode dominates over any other . for example , with @xmath272 and @xmath280 one has @xmath281 since producing the graviton in association with a gluon jet is also proportional to @xmath282 , searching for the invisible decay in this channel may be promising and important to validate this scenario .",

    "although by assumption they too are suppressed , the rare decay @xmath283 is of obvious experimental interest .",
    "the rapidity distribution of the photons depends on the spin of the resonance , which in principle may be used to distinguish the graviton from a scalar .",
    "finally , spin - two particles can also be produced through vector boson fusion @xmath284 , which has been recently studied in @xcite . in our model",
    "the production rate is proportional to @xmath250 and therefore under our assumptions can not be made arbitrarily small , unlike the production through gluon - gluon fusion which is suppressed by the small parameter ( @xmath285 ) .",
    "compared to higgs production from vector boson fusion , the production rate of the spin - two particle is suppressed by a factor of @xmath286 .",
    "this is simply because in unitary gauge the amplitude for producing the spin - two field involves two higgs vev insertions , whereas the same amplitude for producing the higgs boson has only a single insertion .",
    "the higgs and graviton production cross - sections through vector boson fusion are not trivially related however , since they scale differently with mass due to the dependence on spin .",
    "the rate in this channel could be of experimental interest if the spin - two mass is low and the scale @xmath221 not too large .    experimentally discovering the spin - two field in different production channels and measuring the branching ratios to the invisible and all visible decay channels will obviously help discriminate between different models of composite or kaluza - klein spin - two fields .",
    "if susy is broken near the tev scale by strong dynamics then there may be composites that can be accessed at the lhc .",
    "it is desirable to have a formalism for writing the effective theory describing the interactions between the matter or gauge fields and the composites , especially in the situation where the matter and gauge fields are not participants of these dynamics .",
    "the challenge then in this case is that the matter and gauge fields appear in linearly realized multiplets , whereas the composites do not .",
    "we have presented a formulation of non - linearly realized global susy in which this can be done .    as an application , we consider two scenarios . in",
    "both , the higgs boson is such a composite .",
    "no higgsinos are present in the low - energy theory .",
    "we show that it is possible to write down susy invariant yukawa couplings and @xmath42 terms , despite the presence of only one higgs boson .",
    "next , we further suppose that the composites include a light spin - two field in addition to the higgs boson .",
    "the construction of the susy invariant action is in analogy to the hidden local symmetry of chiral dynamics , where the @xmath18 meson is a massive vector boson of a hidden local su(2)@xmath165 symmetry . here though the hidden symmetry is local poincar ' e. thus we find that a massive graviton can naturally be incorporated in a theory with an enlarged spacetime symmetry , which in this case is global susy .    some phenomenological signatures are discussed . unlike a generic kaluza - klein graviton ,",
    "the spin - two particle does not couple to the stress - energy tensor .",
    "instead its interactions with matter and gauge fields are constrained only by gauge , lorentz and non - linear susy invariance .",
    "its dominant decay mode is to goldstinos ( invisible ) , electroweak gauge bosons and the higgs boson .",
    "search strategies to find boosted higgs bosons are particularly interesting for this scenario .",
    "vector boson fusion producing the spin - two particle occurs and may be of experimental interest .",
    "rare decays to di - photons also occur but the rate is more model - dependent .",
    "search strategies to find the standard model higgs boson are therefore simultaneously sensitive to finding the spin - two particle .",
    "this scenario has the usual low - energy susy experimental signatures ( without higgsinos ) , while in addition possessing signatures of both large @xcite and warped extra dimensions @xcite - monojets ( add ) and a spin - two resonance ( rs ) - even though there is no extra dimension .",
    "the discovery of susy particles and a single spin - two resonance is not sufficient to claim discovery of an extra ( supersymmetric ) dimension .",
