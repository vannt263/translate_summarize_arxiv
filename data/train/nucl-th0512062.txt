    "nevertheless , there is a well defined relation between the discrete states characterizing the closed system , and the resonance states appearing in the open system .",
    "the main difference in the theoretical description of quantum systems without and with coupling to an environment of the decay channels is that the function space of the system is supposed to be complete in the first case while this is not so in the second case .",
    "accordingly , the hamilton operator is hermitian in the first case , and the eigenvalues are discrete .",
    "the resonance states , however , characterize a subsystem described by a non - hermitian hamilton operator with complex eigenvalues .",

    "feshbach succeeded in formulating a unified description of nuclear reactions with both direct processes ( the short - time scale ) and compound nucleus processes ( the long - time scale ) .",

    "the profound relation between the appearance of the 2p radioactivity in even-@xmath10 systems and the short - ranged pairing correlations gives a hope that in future studies of the proton - proton spatial - momentum correlations in the asymptotic state of 2p decay , one will learn about the basic features of the pairing field , such as its radial dependence or the multipole structure .",
    "a possible influence of the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) correlations in the decaying even-@xmath10 nucleus on the asymptotic state of two protons , can be extracted from the data only in the unified theoretical framework which contains all ingredients which are necessary for a description of the initial state of @xmath11-nucleon system , the final state of @xmath12-nucleon system and the asymptotic state of two emitted protons . in the smec formalism with the two - particle continuum",
