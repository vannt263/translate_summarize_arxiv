    "a two - level laser is a source of coherent or chaotic light emitted by two - level atoms inside a cavity coupled to a vacuum reservoir via a single - port mirror . in one model of such a laser ,",
    "two - level atoms initially in the upper level are injected at a constant rate into a cavity and removed after they have decayed due to spontaneous emission [ 1,2 ] . in another model",
    "the two - level atoms available in a cavity are pumped to the upper level by some convenient means such as electron bombardment [ 2,3 ] .",
    "there has been a considerable interest to study the quantum properties of the light generated by a two - level laser [ 4 - 10 ] .",
    "it is found that the light generated by this laser operating well above threshold is coherent and the light generated by the same laser operating below threshold is chaotic . in the quantum theory of a laser ,",
    "one usually takes into consideration the interaction of the atoms inside the cavity with the vacuum reservoir outside the cavity",
    ". there may be some justification for the possibility of such interaction for a laser with an open cavity into which and from which atoms are injected and removed",
    ". however , there can not be any valid justification for leaving open the laser cavity in which the available atoms are pumped to the upper level by means of electron bombardment .",
    "therefore , the aforementioned interaction is not feasible for a laser in which the atoms available in a closed cavity are pumped to the upper level by electron bombardment .",
    "we seek here to analyze the quantum properties of the light emitted by two - level atoms available in a closed cavity and pumped to the upper level at a constant rate . thus taking into account the interaction of the two - level atoms with a resonant cavity mode and the damping of the cavity mode by a vacuum reservoir , we obtain the photon statistics , the quadrature variance , and the power spectrum for the light emitted by the atoms .",
    "we carry out this analysis by putting the noise operators associated with the vacuum reservoir in normal order and without considering the interaction of the two - level atoms with the vacuum reservoir outside the cavity .",
    "we consider here the case in which @xmath0 two - level atoms are available in a closed cavity .",
    "then the interaction of the cavity mode with one of the atoms can be described at resonance by the hamiltonian @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a lowering atomic operator , @xmath3 is the annihilation operator for the cavity mode , and @xmath4 is the coupling constant between the atom and the cavity mode .",
    "we assume that the laser cavity is coupled to a vacuum reservoir via a single - port mirror .",
    "in addition , we carry out our calculation by putting the noise operators associated with the vacuum reservoir in normal order .",
    "thus the noise operators will not have any effect on the dynamics of the cavity mode operators .",
    "we can then drop the noise operator and write the quantum langevin equation for the operator @xmath3 as @xmath5,\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the cavity damping constant . therefore , with the aid of ( [ 1 ] ) , we readily find @xmath7    furthermore , employing the relation @xmath8\\rangle\\ ] ] along with eq .",

    "constant , we infer that an atom in the upper level and inside a closed cavity emits a photon due to its interaction with the cavity light .",
