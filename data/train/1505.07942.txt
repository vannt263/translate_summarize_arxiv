    "the theoretical estimations of @xmath3 were not performed so far .",
    "as it was already mentioned above , the fe atoms in the bfo can have various oxidation states .",
    "the origin of this distinction in real materials can be related for instance with a particular sample preparation procedure , that can explain the large discrepancy in results of various experiments . in this work ,",
    "we investigate from first - principles the impact of fe oxidation states on structural , magnetic , optical , and electronic properties of chemically perfect bfo and bafeo@xmath0 ( @xmath23 ) with vacancies .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec2 ]",
    "we provide the essential details of our methods and calculations . in section  [ sec3 ] , we present the results and discuss the structural , electronic , optical , and magnetic properties of the bfo . finally , our summary and conclusions are drawn .",
    "our calculations of the bfo , undoped bafeo@xmath0 , and nominally overdoped bfo were performed using a first - principles green function method  @xcite based the multiple - scattering within the density functional theory in a generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) to the exchange - correlation potential .   @xcite we used a full charge density approximation to take into account possible non - sphericity of the crystal potential and the charge density .",
    "the fe oxidation state was modeled using a self - interaction correction ( sic ) method  @xcite as it is implemented within the multiple - scattering theory .",
    "@xcite in this case , an oxidation state can be defined by the number of valence electrons as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the total number of electrons of an isolated atom , @xmath26 is the number of electrons occupying the deep energy levels and treated as the core electrons , @xmath27 is the number of sic corrected 3@xmath28 electrons .",
    "since the sic approach is designed only for ground state properties,@xcite we used a gga+u method  @xcite to take into account electronic correlation effects in calculations of exchange parameters .",
    "the later were estimated within the magnetic force theorem .",
    "@xcite the critical temperature and the magnetic ordering were obtained within the heisenberg model @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 label the magnetic atoms , and @xmath32 is a unit vector in the direction of the magnetic moment of the _ i_th atom .",
    "the critical temperatures were estimated using both the mean field approximation ( mfa ) and random phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "@xcite both approaches were successfully applied to many magnetically ordered oxides including magnetic perovskites .",
    "@xcite    disorder effects in our study were simulated within the coherent - potential approximation ( cpa ) .",
    "@xcite the intrinsic oxygen vacancies in bafeo@xmath0 were modeled within the same cpa scheme , which implies randomly distributed vacancies over all oxygen sites . regarding the ba and fe vacancies , in the literature ,",
    "such cation - deficient perovskites are formally denoted as bafeo@xmath33 , although the bulk perovskite structures are unable to accommodate interstitial oxygen .",
    "the calculations of the xas and xmcd were performed using the spin - polarized fully relativistic linear - muffin - tin - orbital ( lmto ) method @xcite for the experimentally observed lattice constants .",
    "the details are described in our previous papers .",
    "the ground - state phase of bfo is hexagonal with the space group symmetry @xmath34.@xcite it contains six formula units ( f.u . ) and two types of environmentally different fe .",
    "we calculated the structural properties using both the lda @xcite and gga @xcite to the exchange - correlation potential .",
    "the gga ( lda ) yields the equilibrium volume of 378.66  @xmath35 ( 352.84  @xmath35 ) , which is in a good agreement with the experimental value of 388.42  @xmath35 . for this volume and chemically perfect bfo",
    ", we found that the afm configuration is marginally preferable by 9  mev / f.u .",
    ", as compared to the fm solution , while the magnetic moments of each type of fe differ significantly : 3.34  @xmath36 and 2.38  @xmath36 .",
    "the use of the electronic - correlation parameter u=2  ev applied on iron species increases the fe magnetic moments by 12% , whereas the energy difference @xmath37 increases up to 28  mev / f.u .    concerning the cubic bfo phase ,",
    "the lda equilibrium lattice parameter of 3.86    is significantly underestimated , as compared to the experimental value of 3.97   , while the use of gga results in @xmath38   . for the latter we found that the fm ordering is strongly favorable by 110  mev / f.u . with respect to the g - type afm configuration .",
    "thus , we suggest that the bfo phase transformation from its hexagonal afm to cubic fm structure goes with the volume reduction of 1.1% per f.u . and the corresponding energy barrier is 0.28  ev / f.u . in bfo films ,",
    "the cubic fm phase can be stabilized at room temperature by anharmonic contributions to the free energy and/or the effects of epitaxial strain .",
    "thus , the crystalline structure of the hexagonal and cubic bfo can be adequately described using a conventional gga functional .",
    "further , we focus our study on electronic , optic , and magnetic properties of the cubic bfo phase ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) .        since we found the gga to be an appropriate functional in describing the crystalline structure of the cubic bfo , we applied the method for further study of its electronic and magnetic properties .    within the gga ,",
    "the spin - polarized density of states ( dos ) of bfo exhibits a metallic behavior in the two spin channels , as it is shown in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "this agrees with the experimental findings of callender _",
    "et al._,@xcite who observed the ferromagnetic ordering and conductance in bfo films , annealed in the oxygen atmosphere .",
    "the iron atoms appear to have the oxidation state of @xmath39 .",
    "therewith , @xmath40 and @xmath16 states are almost occupied in the majority spin channel ( 4.5 electrons ) and only partially occupied ( 1.5 electrons ) in the minority spin channel .",
    "the @xmath41 electrons of iron experience a strong hybridization with the @xmath42 states of oxygen and are widely spread over the whole valence band region .",
    "the total magnetic moment , calculated within the gga , is 3.55  @xmath22 per f.u . , which includes the ferromagnetically induced o moments of about 0.15  @xmath22 .",
    "the exchange interaction between fe atoms is large and positive within the gga : 20.5  mev and 2  mev between the nearest and the next nearest neighbors , respectively .",
    "the estimated curie temperature is about 1000  k in the mean field approximation ( 700  k in the random phase approximation ) .",
    "it has to be mentioned here that the rpa provides usually a reasonable critical temperature , while the mfa represents average exchange interaction and overestimates @xmath3 by 30 ",
    "40%.@xcite    thus , the curie temperature , calculated in the cubic bfo using the gga method , is several times larger then the experimental values ( 100  400  k ) .",
    "the reason is that the system is metallic within this approach and , therefore , the double exchange interaction via the oxygens and the band ferromagnetism dominate over the other exchange mechanisms , which can reduce the magnetic interaction or change its sign . therefore , the electronic correlations , which can be substantial in oxides , must be taken into account using a more appropriate method .      at the next step , we chose the gga+u approximation , which provides a more adequate description of oxide materials then the conventional lda or gga approaches.@xcite since we could not estimate the value of @xmath43 from first principles , we used it as a parameter tracing the change of the electronic and magnetic properties with the value of @xmath43 . in our simulations we applied the hubbard @xmath43 corrections on fe @xmath41 states and varied the value of @xmath44 between 0 ( here , gga ) and 9  ev .",
    "as expected , the occupied ( unoccupied ) @xmath41 fe states are shifted down ( up ) in energy on the value of @xmath45 that opens the gap in the minority spin channel for @xmath46  ev ( see the dos in fig.[fig3 ] with @xmath47  ev ) .",
    "the size of the spin band gap depends strongly on the @xmath48 value .    in fig.[fig4 ]",
    ", we show the total and all site - projected magnetic moments , which are plotted as a function of @xmath49 .",
    "the local magnetic moment of iron increases from 3  @xmath14 to 4.18  @xmath14 within the given range of @xmath48 values , while the induced magnetic moment of oxygen decreases from 0.18  @xmath14 to -0.08  @xmath14 systematically with the increase of @xmath48 .",
    "the magnetic moment induced on ba is @xmath50 and its small value changes marginally on the model variations of @xmath43 .",
    "for @xmath46  ev the total moment is integer ( 4  @xmath22/f.u ) , which reflects the half - metallicity of the bfo .",
    "this is larger then the experimental values of 3.2  3.5  @xmath22/f.u .",
    ", reported previously in refs .  .",
    "as next , we calculated the exchange interaction as a function of @xmath48 .",
    "the results are presented in fig.[fig5 ] .",
    "since the bfo remains metallic within this approximation , we can classify the main magnetic interaction as the double exchange .",
    "the consequence of the strong ferromagnetic coupling is the largely overestimated @xmath3 compared to the measured values .",
    "although applying the gga+u method reduces slightly the exchange interaction , mainly due to the reduction of the overlap between the fe and oxygen states , the curie temperature is still too high in the whole range of @xmath48 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath3 on @xmath48 is nontrivial .",
    "first , it reduces with the increase of @xmath48 , since the fe @xmath41 states are getting localized and their overlap with @xmath51 states of oxygen . at @xmath52",
    "ev , a band gap forms in the minority spin channel and the @xmath53 rise up with the increase of @xmath48 .",
    "therewith , the exchange interaction between the nearest neighbors is getting larger only until @xmath54  ev and then decreasing , while the next nearest neighbor interaction continues to increase until @xmath55  ev . as result",
    ", the curie temperature gets up to 700  k within the rpa for @xmath55  ev and then starts to fall down . according to our estimations",
    ", the curie temperature agrees with experimental values only for @xmath56  ev , which are nonphysical for this compound .",
    "thus , consideration only electronic correlation effects does not explain magnetic properties of bfo .",
    "this fact motivated us to improve the model of bfo and make further calculations .",
    "in complex transition metal oxides , the xas and xmcd spectra at the @xmath57 absorption edges can be used as fingerprints of the ground state . in our study",
    "we simulated the xas and xmcd spectra varying the crystal structure , the chemical composition , the value of @xmath48 for electronic correlation effects , the magnetic order , and searching for optimal agreement with available experiments .",
    "[ fig6 ] displays the experimentally measured @xcite and theoretically calculated fe @xmath57 xas ( upper panel ) and xmcd ( lower panel ) spectra of the cubic bafeo@xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath58 xas spectrum exhibits a weak lower - energy shoulder at around 708  ev together with a high - energy shoulder at 713  ev .",
    "the @xmath59 xas spectrum exhibits a lower - energy peak at around 721  ev .",
    "the fe @xmath58 xmcd spectrum consists of major negative peak at 710  ev with low - energy shoulder and an additional positive peak at 713  ev .",
    "the fe @xmath59 xmcd spectrum has double - peak structure .",
    "first , we found the best agreement with experiments was achieved for @xmath47  ev .",
    "this value of @xmath48 is used later for all our calculations if it is not mentioned specifically .",
    "however , the experimental results could not explained only by taking into account strong correlations effect .",
    "for the ideal cubic bfo structure , our simulations of the xas and xmcd spectra provide x - ray absorption intensity in the fe @xmath58 only at the major peak and high - energy shoulder , while the low energy peaks at the @xmath58 and @xmath59 edges is not reproduced ( red dashed curve in fig .  [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "the calculation fails to reproduce low energy shoulder of the xmcd major negative peak at 709  ev in @xmath58 xmcd spectrum . also , the simulations for the ideal cubic bfo phase provide only one a high energy peak structure in the @xmath59 xmcd spectrum , however , the experimental measurements exhibit a double - peak structure .",
    "the correct explanation of the experimental xas and xmcd spectra is only possible by taking into account crystal imperfections , namely , oxygen vacancy . to investigate the influence of oxygen deficiency on the xas and xmcd spectra we created an oxygen vacancy in a double supercell in the first neighborhood of the second fe atom .",
    "we found that the presence of the oxygen vacancy decreases the valency of nearest fe ion from 4 + to 3 + ( see the corresponding discussion below ) .",
    "the x - ray absorption from the fe atoms with the oxygen vacancy in close vicinity ( dotted blue line in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) contributes to the low energy peaks in the @xmath59 absorption and xmcd spectra .",
    "the oxygen vacancy also explain the existence of the low - energy shoulder in fe @xmath58 xmcd spectrum at 709  ev .",
    "the same conclusion can be drawn from the interpretation of the xas and xmcd spectra at the o @xmath60 edge .",
    "fig.[fig7 ] shows the experimentally measured x - ray absorption and xmcd spectra @xcite ( open circles ) at the o @xmath60 edge in bafeo@xmath2 together with theoretically calculated spectra for the ideal crystal structure of bafeo@xmath2 ( red dashed curves ) and the structure with oxygen vacancy ( dotted blue curves ) .",
    "the calculations for the ideal structure are not able to describe the high - energy shoulder of major negative xmcd peak at 531  ev , which is due to the oxygen vacancy .",
    "we can conclude that the explanation of the experimental spectra at both the fe @xmath57 and o @xmath60 edges demands the presence of crystal imperfections in bafeo@xmath2 .      to understand the vacancy formation we performed first - principles study of the fe oxidation states in the cubic bafeo@xmath2 using a self - interaction method as it is described in sec .",
    "the fe oxidation state vary in different compounds from 2 + to 4 + . for a completely oxidized bfo",
    ", one can expect a high valency , fe@xmath6 .",
    "the total energy study of the oxidation state and further comparison between bfo and bafeo@xmath0 can provide us with some hints concerning the electronic properties and the preferable magnetic order in bfo .",
    "the goodenough - kanamori rules of the 180@xmath61 superexchange suggest that the interaction fe  o  fe can be switched from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic when the fe 3@xmath28-orbital filling changes . in this context , a variety of the superexchange options , such as fe@xmath6o ",
    "fe@xmath6 , fe@xmath7o  fe@xmath7 and fe@xmath6o  fe@xmath7 need to be inspected .",
    "however , the goodenough - kanamori simplifications work robustly for insulators only .",
    "when theory deals with metallic magnetic oxide , such as the cubic bfo , the superexchange coupling does not dominate there and double exchange complicates the long - range interactions between magnetic species .    in the case of the cubic symmetry ,",
    "the fe@xmath6 electronic configuration is @xmath15 , where the half - occupied @xmath16 orbital has ether @xmath62 or @xmath63 representation . for the cubic bfo case , which was treated within the lsda - sic model",
    ", we found that the two @xmath16 options result in the same equilibrium volume ( see fig.[fig8 ] ) , which is substantially smaller then the experimental result ( 62.57  @xmath35 ) and the volume calculated using the gga ( fe@xmath64 ) .",
    "although the volume computed within the gga is very close to the experimental value , the corresponding total energy is about 22  mev higher then the total energies of fe@xmath6 and fe@xmath7 configurations .    for the cation fe@xmath7",
    ", its t@xmath65 and e@xmath66 levels must be fully occupied in the majority spin channel .",
    "this electronic configuration yields the total - energy minimum value , which is not far above that of the fe@xmath6 ground state , as shown in fig .  [ fig8 ] .",
    "the calculated equilibrium volume is in a better agreement with the experimental results then the values obtained for fe@xmath7 ( sic ) and fe@xmath64 ( gga ) configurations .",
    "the energetics suggest that both oxidations , fe@xmath6 and fe@xmath7 , can be realized in epitaxially fabricated thin films .",
    "configurations with other oxidation states are much higher in energy and are excluded from the further consideration .    further , we compared the total energies of fe@xmath6 and fe@xmath7 oxidation states in the presence of oxygen vacancies . for @xmath67 the total energies in the equilibrium volumes",
    "are almost the same ( see fig .  [ fig8 ] ) .",
    "thus , the vacancy formation lowers the energy of the fe@xmath7 oxidation state , which agrees with our interpretation of the xas and xmcd experiments . in a real bfo sample",
    ", both oxidation states can coexist , which is as well evident from our xas and xmcd simulations . in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] we present the total energy for a mixed configuration , which is lower then the others in a particular concentration range .",
    "as next , we investigated the impact of oxygen vacancies on magnetic properties of the bfo .",
    "the oxygen vacancies were simulated within a @xmath68 supercell , in which one oxygen site was occupied by an vacancy with a given probability .",
    "the disorder was simulated using the cpa method .",
    "the use of the supercell enables to take into account short - range effects in a simple manner , which can take place in real materials .",
    "results for the exchange interaction , computed in this supercell and @xmath69 , are presented in fig .",
    "while the exchange interaction between the fe@xmath6 cations is strong and positive , it is week and negative between the fe@xmath7 atoms .",
    "the reason for this can be understood from the dos , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] . because of the vacancy ( missing oxygen ) , the @xmath41 states of the fe@xmath7 are more localized ( in particular the @xmath70 states ) and are shifted down in energy .",
    "this increases the tendency to an antiferromagnetic coupling .",
    "the coupling between the atoms in different oxidation states is as well antiferromagnetic and very strong due to the large difference of the dos .",
    "this funding agrees with the main conclusions of s. mori , who first developed a model for the magnetic structure of bafeo@xmath71.@xcite    depending on the vacancy concentration and their distribution , the non - trivial exchange interaction in bafeo@xmath0 can results in various magnetic orders . in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] , we show the change of critical temperature with the oxygen vacancy concentration simulated within the mfa and rpa approaches .",
    "the negative @xmath3 means here the absence of the ferromagnetic order ( either antiferromagnetic or non - collinear ) .",
    "thus , for a moderate vacancy concentration @xmath8 of 0.15  0.20 , @xmath3 lies in the experimental range of 250  100  k.",
    "in this work we studied electronic and magnetic properties of a cubic bafeo@xmath2 within a dft framework using a gga and a gga+u approaches .",
    "we predicted that the bafeo@xmath2 in an ideal stoichiometric cubic structure should be half - metallic and ferromagnetic with a high curie temperature of 700  900  k. however , this finding disagrees the experiments , which found that the compound has a @xmath3 far below the room temperature . to understand this discrepancy we simulated xas and xmcd spectra comparing the theoretically obtained results with available experimental data .",
    "herewith , we varied the chemical composition , structural and electronic parameters to obtain a better agreement with experiments .",
    "our simulations showed that the experimental observations can be explained by oxygen vacancies , which can be present in real bfo samples .",
    "thereby , fe atoms near an oxygen vacancy change their oxidation state from @xmath4 to @xmath5 .",
    "thus , a real cubic bafeo@xmath2 may contain both fe@xmath6 and fe@xmath7 cations , which explains the experimentally observed double peak structure in xas and xmcd spectra .",
    "further , we found that oxygen vacancies can substantially reduce the curie temperature of a cubic bfo or even change the ferromagnetic order to an antiferromagnetic one or a non - collinear structure .",
    "responsible for this is a strong antiferromagnetic exchange coupling between fe atoms of different oxidation states .",
