    "stochastic luminosity outbursts are the most extreme type of photometric variability observed in young stellar objects . these outbursts range from the less dramatic ex lupi - type sources , which occasionally climb in luminosity by a factor of a few , fade over a few years , and have the emission - line spectra of extreme t tauri stars @xcite , to the most dramatic fu orionis - type sources , which increase in optical brightness by at least four magnitudes , remain luminous for decades , and have absorption - line spectra with inferred spectral types that change with wavelength @xcite . based on their mid - infrared spectra , fu orionis sources have been divided into category 1 , which have the 10  silicate feature in absorption and still have infalling envelopes , and category 2 , which have silicate emission and lack significant envelopes @xcite .",
    "this suggests that these outbursts are an important phenomenon at all stages in the evolution of young stellar objects .",
    "the outbursts are due to luminosity generated by an increase in the rate at which the circumstellar disk material accretes onto the star .",
    "the notion that the disk - to - star accretion rate of a young stellar object is typically low but occasionally spikes during times of dramatically enhanced accretion activity is known as episodic accretion .",
    "this was proposed to explain why the observed luminosities of populations of protostars ( young stellar objects with envelopes ) have both systematically lower luminosities and a wider dispersion in luminosities than those predicted for the collapse of isothermal spheres ( the luminosity problem ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if each forming star experiences several relatively short but large luminosity outbursts , its time - averaged luminosity could agree with predictions even if the star is usually underluminous .",
    "outbursts have been modeled as the accretion of clumps formed via instabilities in a self - gravitating disk @xcite . in these models ,",
    "the infall of gas from the envelope causes the disk to grow in mass until it becomes gravitationally unstable .",
    "an open question is whether these events are frequent enough to solve the luminosity problem . @xcite",
    "distinguish between sources in which an outburst was actually observed and those that merely have outburst - like spectra , pointing to the importance of time monitoring to unambiguously classify each putative outburster and determine the frequency of these events . since the advent of large - scale optical and ir monitoring programs , several young stellar objects have been observed to undergo significant increases in luminosity ; e.g. , v733 cep @xcite , v2492 cyg @xcite , v2493 cyg @xcite , v2494 cyg @xcite , v2495 cyg @xcite , v900 mon @xcite , and v1647 ori @xcite , allowing a more thorough understanding of the range of outburst types and their frequencies .",

    "the goal of hops is to obtain 70 and 160  imaging and 50200  spectra of protostars in the orion molecular clouds that were identified with spitzer space telescope photometry by @xcite .",

    "v2775 ori is unresolved at both pacs wavelengths .",
    "we obtained aperture photometry using a 9.6  radius at 70  and a 12.8  radius at 160  with subtraction of the median signal in a background annulus extending from the aperture limit to twice that value in both channels .",
    "the results were divided by measurements of the encircled energy fractions in these apertures provided by the photaperturecorrectionpointsource task in hipe , adjusted for the fact that our close - in sky subtraction removes 34% of the flux in each point - spread function .",

    ", v2775 ori was observed with the saboca and laboca instruments on apex , the atacama pathfinder experiment .",
    "saboca , the submillimetre apex bolometer camera @xcite , operates at 350 .",
    "it was used to observe two fields containing the source , one on 2011 september 16 and one on 2011 september 18 .",
    "laboca , the large apex bolometer camera @xcite , operates at 870  .",
    "it also was used to observe two fields containing the source , one on 2011 september 22 and one on 2011 september 26 .",
    "the two fields at each wavelength were combined .",
    "cutouts from the apex fields appear in the bottom row of figure  [ f.farir ] .    for laboca , the data were first put on an approximate flux density scale using a standard factor to convert counts to flux density .",
    "atmospheric absorption was accounted for with atmospheric zenith opacities derived from skydips taken every one to two hours .",
    "finally , planets and secondary flux density calibrators ( observed at least once per hour ) were used to establish corrections to the standard flux density conversion and to account for imperfection in the opacity determination from the skydips .",
    "this yields a flux density calibration that is accurate to about 10% .",
    "we quote a larger 40% uncertainty for v2775 ori , as it is unclear how much the surrounding cloud / filament and the two other sources in the field contribute to the 870  flux density .    for saboca ,",
    "the procedure was similar , except that we used the atmospheric model directly ( with precipitable water vapor as measured by the apex radiometer at the time of the actual observation as input ) to get the zenith opacity .",
    "this has the advantage that the opacity is derived for the time and elevation at which the observation was actually taken , not from a nonsimultaneous skydip .",
    "nevertheless , the scatter of calibration factors remains substantial , as even relatively small changes in precipitable water vapor cause a fairly large change in atmospheric attenuation at 350 , where the opacity remains high even in very good conditions . from the scatter of the calibration factors , the flux densities can not be derived to better than 3040% for saboca outside of the very best conditions , which we did not have for v2775 ori .",
    "we thus quote a 40% uncertainty for saboca as well .    at both wavelengths , we report the flux densities without sky subtraction in circular apertures of diameter equal to the fwhm of the instrument beam : 7.3  at 350  and 19  at 870  .",
    "we observed v2775 ori with spex @xcite at the infrared telescope facility ( irtf ) on 2011 january 27 , 29 , 31 , and february 1 .",
    "we used the short - wavelength cross - dispersed ( sxd ) mode , selecting a 0.3@xmath15 slit and obtaining spectra that extend from 1.0 to 2.4  @xmath16 at a resolving power @xmath17 .",
    "( due to the extreme redness of the object , no continuum could be extracted over the 0.8 to 1.0  @xmath16 range normally accessible in sxd mode . )",
    "total exposure times were 36 minutes on 29 january and 32 minutes on the other nights , yielding a continuum @xmath18 at the one - micron @xmath19 band , increasing to about 120 at @xmath20 .    to facilitate the subtraction of sky emission lines , the observing sequence for a given object consisted of multiple 120 s exposures .",
    "after the first and third exposures of a four - exposure sequence , the telescope was nodded by 7.5@xmath21 ( an abba pattern ) such that the object remained in the slit .",
    "the normal a0 stars hd 35505 and hd 45137 , near the target and at similar airmass , were observed to allow the removal of atmospheric absorption lines and provide an approximate flux calibration .",
    "the data were reduced with spextool @xcite , an idl package containing routines for dark subtraction and flat fielding , spectral extraction , wavelength calibration with arc lamp lines , and the combining of multiple observations from a nodding sequence .",
    "the correction for atmospheric absorption lines was handled by _",
    "@xcite , an idl routine that divides the target spectrum by a calibrator .",
    "if the calibrator is an a0 star , then its spectrum consists to a good approximation only of hydrogen lines and atmospheric absorption lines .",
    "division by such a calibrator , if observed at approximately the same airmass as the target , removes the target s atmospheric absorption lines .",
    "the hydrogen lines in the calibrator were removed by fitting a scaled model of vega ; inspection of the spectra of v2775 ori before and after the telluric correction confirm that this process does not generate spurious hydrogen emission or absorption .",
    "after telluric correction , the merging of the six orders covered in the sxd mode and the removal of remaining bad pixels were accomplished with separate programs in the spextool package .",
    "the uncertainty in the spex flux calibration is dominated by different slit losses for the target and the calibrator . over the four nights , we measured some variation in the @xmath10 , @xmath9 , and @xmath20 magnitudes : @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .",
    "the @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 colors , however , were remarkably consistent from night to night , varying by at most 0.04 magnitudes .",
    "the lack of color change points to wavelength - independent slit losses , not intrinsic variability , and in the sed of v2775 ori we assume that the absolute flux of the source during the spex run is well represented by the mean of the four spectra .",
    "we observed v2775 ori ( target 8570200 - 8276310 ) on 2007 march 12 with the spitzer infrared spectrograph ( irs ; @xcite ) .",
    "the observations were made with the two low - spectral - resolution irs modules ( sl from 5.2 to 14.5  and ll from 14.0 to 38.0 ; @xmath28 ) in staring mode .",
    "the spectrum was generated from the spitzer science center ( ssc ) s18.7 pipeline basic calibrated data with the irs instrument team s smart software package @xcite . to prepare the data for extraction , we first replaced the permanently bad and `` rogue '' pixels flux values with those interpolated from neighboring functional pixels .",
    "background emission was removed by subtracting the opposite nod positions .",
    "the reduced two - dimensional data were extracted using a column with a width that was matched to the irs point - spread function .",
    "we then used the same method to extract spectra of the calibrators markarian 231 , @xmath29 lac , and @xmath30 dra .",
    "we divided template spectra of the calibrators by their extracted spectra at the two nod positions to create relative spectral response functions ( rsrfs ) .",
    "the extracted orders of v2775 ori at both nod positions were multiplied by the rsrfs , and the resulting nod - position spectra were averaged to obtain the final spectrum .",
    "the spectral uncertainties are estimated to be half the difference between the independent spectra from each nod position ; the median signal - to - noise ratio of the spectrum is 150 .      for comparison with the spex spectrum of v2775 ori in section  [ s.nirspec ] , we obtained a spectrum of fu ori with triplespec @xcite at the hale 200-inch telescope of palomar observatory on 2012 january 9 .",
    "we obtained four consecutive one - minute exposures of fu ori for a continuum @xmath31 in the @xmath19 band , increasing to about 800 at @xmath20 .",
    "the data were reduced with a version of spextool modified for triplespec by m. cushing , following the same steps as for the spex observations of v2775 ori and using hd 34317 as a telluric calibrator .",
    "the spectrum extends from 1.0 to 2.5  @xmath16 at a resolving power @xmath32 .",
    "here we present a brief overview of the new images described above . in the hst image , v2775 ori and an associated reflection nebula are visible , as well as [ ctf93 ] 216 ( 2mass j05424706 - 0817069 ; hops 221 ) and its associated nebulosity , 39  to the southwest .",
    "the latter is an embedded protostar with a redder near - to - mid - ir sed than v2775 ori , indicating a denser , less - evolved envelope @xcite .",
    "the near - ir image also shows a point source 11  to the northwest of v2775 ori , 2mass j05424814 - 0816250 .",
    "it does not have an ir excess @xcite .",
    "the 2mass colors and magnitudes are most consistent with a foreground dwarf of class m0 ( @xmath33 , extinction @xmath34 ) or a foreground dwarf of class k2 ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 ) .",
    "if the star were a background giant , it would be a g8 star at @xmath37 with a extinction @xmath34 , prohibitively low if it is viewed through a molecular cloud complex .",
    "the source may also be a pre  main - sequence companion to v2775 ori at a separation @xmath38 .    as in figure  [ f.wfc3 ]",
    ", v2775 ori appears at the center of the herschel and apex images shown in figure  [ f.farir ] , and [ ctf93 ] 216 appears in the southwest .",
    "a source newly identified by the hops team , invisible in hst , 2mass , spitzer / irac , and 24  spitzer / mips images , appears 25  to the northeast of v2775 ori at 70  and longer wavelengths . due to",
    "its extremely red sed , this is likely a cold source , more embedded and less evolved than the protostars detected in spitzer 324  images .",
    "it is part of a sample of such objects discovered in the hops images ( stutz et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "during all hops observations the laboca beam was very close to circular ; the elongation in the 870  image is not due to a noncircular beam , but rather to blending with the source to the northeast and perhaps dust between the two sources .",
    "the spitzer / irs spectrum of 2007 march 12 shows flux increases from the 2004 and 2005 spitzer photometry at 8.0 and 24  by factors of 15.7 and 13.4 , respectively .",
    "we thus conclude that the outburst took place between 2005 april and 2007 march .",
    "the source faded between the acquisition of the irs spectrum in 2007 and the second imaging by mips in 2008 november , with a 45% reduction in the 24  flux over this period .",
    "our analysis places the outburst earlier than the range of dates proposed by @xcite . in their figure  3 ,",
    "their archival irs spectrum from the same date is plotted with a median flux of @xmath39 erg @xmath40 s@xmath41 , making it consistent with the 2004 and 2005 photometry .",
    "they accordingly place the outburst _",
    "after _ the acquisition of the irs spectrum , i.e. , between 2007 march and the 2008 november observation by mips .",
    "our version of the same irs spectrum has a median flux of @xmath42 erg @xmath40 s@xmath41 , in agreement with the spectra obtainable via the cornell atlas of spitzer / irs sources ( cassis ; @xcite ) or the spitzer heritage archive , which were reduced independently with different software and different calibrators and have calibration uncertainties of order 1% .",
    "to analyze the sed evolution of v2775 ori , we separate the data into four epochs .",
    "epoch 1 is the 2mass epoch ( 1998 ) , epoch 2 is the first spitzer epoch ( 20042005 ) , and epoch 3 is the irs epoch ( 2007 march , after the outburst ) . since the 24  mips photometry from 2008 november and the 22  wise photometry from 2010 march are nearly identical , the sed appears to have been relatively stable since late 2008 .",
    "we thus define all data obtained from 2008 november to 2011 september as epoch 4 .",
    "the epoch 4 sed is well sampled from 1.0 to 870 , making it suitable for modeling with a radiative transfer code . even without rigorous modeling , the wide , flat shape of the epoch 4",
    "sed is informative .",
    "the ratio of @xmath43 at @xmath20 to that at 70  is near unity ( 0.68 ) .",
    "very dense envelopes absorb almost all near - ir flux , and the most tenuous envelopes emit very little far - ir flux , pointing to a moderate envelope density for the object .      to more precisely estimate the source s properties",
    ", we fit the epoch 4 sed with a grid of 3,600 models created with the monte carlo radiative transfer code of @xcite .",
    "the code contains a central luminosity source , a luminous accretion disk with power - law radial density profile and scale height , an envelope with a density that follows the rotating collapse solution of @xcite , and a bipolar envelope cavity . for protostars ,",
    "the seds are most sensitive to the total luminosity and the envelope density .",
    "the envelope density law can be scaled to match envelopes of varying average densities ; we quantify this scaling with a reference envelope density @xmath44 , the density at 1  au in the limit of no rotation . for a @xcite  envelope , @xmath45 @xcite , where @xmath46 is the infall rate of the envelope onto the disk and @xmath47 is the mass of the central source .",
    "thus , a reference envelope density can be converted to an envelope infall rate with an assumed central mass .",
    "the grid is a refinement of the one described in @xcite .",
    "the central source has fixed properties , with a radius of @xmath48 , a mass of @xmath49 , and an effective temperature of @xmath50 . in embedded low - mass protostars ,",
    "reprocessing of luminosity by the envelope generally destroys information about the central star , so this simplification does not reduce the range of sed shapes in the grid .",
    "the envelope dust properties are the same as those described by @xcite except that carbon is amorphous instead of in the form of graphite ; the grains are larger than a standard interstellar dust model and are thus more suitable for star - forming regions .",
    "the protostellar properties vary across the grid as follows : there are three disk radii of 5 , 100 , and 500 au .",
    "there are three envelope radii of 5,000 , 10,000 , and 15,000 au .",
    "there are four disk accretion rates that control the total luminosity , ranging from @xmath51  yr@xmath41 ( 1.06 @xmath52 ) to @xmath53  yr@xmath41 ( 56.3 @xmath52 ) in steps of one dex .",
    "there are five cavity opening half - angles extending from 5@xmath54 to 45@xmath54 in steps of 10@xmath54 . finally , there are twenty envelope infall rates taking on values of 0 ( disk - only ) and a range from @xmath55  yr@xmath41 to @xmath56  yr@xmath41 in approximately equal logarithmic steps .",
    "( with a central star of mass @xmath57 , the reference envelope densities @xmath44 for the models with envelopes extend from @xmath58 to @xmath59 . )",
    "each model can be viewed from one of ten angles , resulting in a grid of 36,000 seds .    during fitting ,",
    "a model sed can be modified in two ways to improve the fit .",
    "first , it can be multiplied by a constant between 0.3 and 3.3 ( corresponding to @xmath60  mag ) , which allows the source luminosity to fall along a continuum instead of the four discrete values represented in the grid .",

    "we can make robust estimates of the total luminosity in epochs 2 and 4 due to the relatively dense wavelength sampling of the seds at those times ( section 5 ) : the source increased in luminosity from @xmath90 in epoch 2 to @xmath84 in epoch 4 . the change in total luminosity between these epochs was roughly proportional to the change in 24  flux density : the luminosity was 6.2 times larger and the 24  flux density was 7.3 times larger .",

    "after the 45% drop in the 24  flux density between 2007 march and 2008 november , the object showed evidence of subsequent slight dimming . in the @xmath20 band , where the photometric time - coverage is best , @xcite reported a @xmath11 magnitude of 7.98 in 2009 february , a fading of 0.14 mag by the middle of 2010 october , and a fading of another 0.13 mag by the end of that month .",

    "the equivalent width of the 2.29  co 2 - 0 line in our spex spectrum is 10.0   . in figure 8 of @xcite , this equivalent width places v2775 ori on the dividing line between region b ( weaker absorption in normal stellar photospheres ) and region c ( stronger absorption in fu orionis objects ) .",
    "the co line in fu ori has the same equivalent width ; it is virtually indistinguishable from the v2775 ori profile in figure  [ f.lines ] .",

    "the near - ir hydrogen lines of t tauri stars are often used to estimate accretion luminosities in young stellar objects @xcite .",

    "a similar consideration applies to pa@xmath122 .",
    "the mismatch between the accretion luminosity derived from lines and the accretion luminosity derived from the sed is strong evidence for the fu orionis nature of the v2775 ori outburst as opposed to a lesser variety .      at the onset of an fu orionis outburst ,",
    "the spectrum should change from that of a normal active accretor to that of an fu orionis - like object .",
    "this has been observed most famously in the spectrum of v1057 cyg , which had optical hydrogen lines in emission in a pre - outburst spectrum obtained in 1957 @xcite and the same lines in absorption in a spectrum obtained immediately after its 19691970 outburst @xcite .",
    "the same behavior has also been reported for v2493 cyg ( hbc 722 / lkh@xmath29 188-g4 / ptf 10qpf ) , which had h@xmath122 in emission in a 1977 spectrum @xcite and the same line in absorption just after its 2010 outburst @xcite . characterizing the range of accretion rates over which the spectrum makes this transition would be important in refining the theory of disk accretion in young stars .",
    "while the physical basis for a tight correlation between the luminosity of br@xmath119 and the accretion luminosity in normally accreting young stellar objects is not completely understood , @xcite found that the fluxes and morphologies of near - ir hydrogen lines are reproduced well in models where the lines form in flows of matter from the accretion disk to the star along stellar magnetic field lines .",
    "in general , the widths of the lines ( @xmath129 ) point to gas that free - falls from several stellar radii before landing on the star .",
    "@xcite  found from their modeling that the correlations seem to be driven by the emitting area of the infalling gas :  objects with larger accretion luminosities have larger emitting areas for the emission lines and thus larger line luminosities .    in this scenario , known as magnetospheric accretion",
    ", the accreting material free - falls to the star from the disk truncation radius @xmath95 , the location where the pressure of the stellar magnetic field balances the ram pressure of the disk and the disk is truncated .",
    "magnetospheric accretion theory predicts @xmath130 if the stellar magnetic field , mass , and radius remain constant @xcite .",
    "thus if the accretion rate of a source engaged in magnetospheric accretion becomes several orders of magnitude larger , @xmath95 could shrink to the stellar radius .",
    "for example , if @xmath97 when @xmath131  yr@xmath41 @xcite , then @xmath132 when @xmath133  yr@xmath41 .",
    "this `` crushing of the magnetosphere '' would alter the line luminosity vs.  accretion luminosity relationship that holds for magnetospheric accretion , producing much less emission in spite of the dramatically larger accretion rate .",
    "this is seen in the model h@xmath122 profiles of @xcite , which weaken and go into absorption for the largest accretion rates and the smallest flows .",
    "the lack of br@xmath119 in the spectrum of v2775 ori suggests that the model of accretion along magnetic field lines that thread the disk at @xmath134 does not apply for stars with accretion rates @xmath135 , an order of magnitude below the canonical accretion rate for fu orionis objects .",
    "of the other young stellar objects with both documented outbursts and fu orionis - like near - infrared spectra @xcite , most have luminosities of at least @xmath136 .",

    "if v2775 ori is beginning to fade as suggested by recent observations in the @xmath20 band , monitoring its spectrum as it fades may reveal a critical accretion luminosity at which emission reappears , or it may show a gradual strengthening with decreasing accretion rate .",

    ", the source dimmed slightly , by 0.25 mag at @xmath11 .",
    "the change in luminosity and the peak luminosity are at the low end of the ranges for previously known fu orionis objects @xcite .",

    "the disk accretion rate of v2775 ori increased from @xmath138 to @xmath135 , about an order of magnitude less than the canonical value for fu orionis stars .",
    "the envelope infall rate remained constant at about @xmath139 , less than the disk accretion rate at either epoch and indicating that the source is approaching the end of its envelope - dominated phase .",
    "our near - ir spectra of v2775 ori are consistent with those of an object accreting mass at a rate toward the low end of the fu orionis regime :  they have co absorption lines in the @xmath20 band with equivalent widths that are large for normal photospheres and small for fu orionis stars , broad h@xmath1o absorption , strong and wide blueshifted  @xmath010830  absorption suggestive of a stellar or disk wind , and no atomic hydrogen emission , suggesting a lack of magnetospheric accretion .",
    "v2775 ori has a luminosity , disk - to - star accretion rate , and near - ir spectrum consistent with an fu orionis source , and it is the least luminous documented fu orionis outburster with a protostellar envelope .",
    "additional near - infrared photometry and spectra of v2775 ori will be instrumental in determining the time scale , if any , for the reappearance of its atomic hydrogen lines .",
    "the existence of sources at the low - luminosity boundary of the fu orionis regime supports the notion that there is a continuum of episodic accretion phenomena , not all of which result in sustained luminosities of order 100  @xmath52 , which may explain some of the observed spread in protostellar luminosities .",

    "<S> individual outbursting young stars are important laboratories for studying the physics of episodic accretion and the extent to which this phenomenon can explain the luminosity distribution of protostars . </S>",
    "<S> we present new and archival data for v2775 ori ( hops 223 ) , a protostar in the l 1641 region of the orion molecular clouds that was discovered by caratti o garatti et al .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 2011 ) to have recently undergone an order - of - magnitude increase in luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> our near - infrared spectra of the source have strong blueshifted  @xmath010830  absorption , strong h@xmath1o and co absorption , and no emission , all typical of fu orionis sources . with data from irtf , 2mass , hst , </S>",
    "<S> spitzer , wise , herschel , and apex that span from 1 to 70  pre - outburst and from 1 to 870  post - outburst , we estimate that the outburst began between 2005 april and 2007 march . </S>",
    "<S> we also model the pre- and post - outburst spectral energy distributions of the source , finding it to be in the late stages of accreting its envelope with a disk - to - star accretion rate that increased from @xmath2 to @xmath3 during the outburst . </S>",
    "<S> the post - outburst luminosity at the epoch of the fu orionis - like near - ir spectra is @xmath4 , making v2775 ori the least luminous documented fu orionis outburster with a protostellar envelope . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of low - luminosity outbursts supports the notion that a range of episiodic accretion phenomena can partially explain the observed spread in protostellar luminosities . </S>"
