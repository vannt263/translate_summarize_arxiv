    "glass transition is a ubiquitous phenomenon@xmath13 believed to occur in a supercooled liquid ( scl ) , which is one of the metastable states in nature , and has been investigated for at least over eight decades since the earliest works of nernst@xmath14 and simon@xmath15 . despite this , a complete understanding of the transition itself and related issues is still far from complete , although major progress has been made recently@xcite .",
    "theoretical and experimental investigations invariably require applying ( time - independent ) thermodynamics to scl to extract quantities like the entropy .",
    "this presumes , as we do here , that there exists a _ stationary limit _ of the metastable scl state ( sms ) under infinitely slow cooling in which the crystal ( cr )  is _ _",

    ", kauzmann suggested that something like a glass transition must intervene to avoid this entropy crisis , known commonly as the _ kauzmann paradox _ ( @xmath23 at some positive temperature .",
    "there are several computational@xmath24 and theoretical@xmath25 results clearly demonstrating the existence of some kind of entropy crisis .",
    "it should be stressed that there is no thermodynamic requirement for @xmath26 to be non - negative .",
    "there are physical systems like he@xmath27 in which @xmath26 can become negative at low temperatures",
    ". a recent exact calculation on a classical system@xmath28 clearly demonstrates a negative @xmath26 at low temperatures@xmath17 if there is any hope of finding a thermodynamic basis for the glass transition , we must look for a condition for the glass transition that is dictated by thermodynamics .",
    "thus , in the following , we replace @xmath26 by the entropy @xmath29 such as the configurational entropy , which represents the natural log of the _ number _ of microstates @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the average energy at that temperature .",
    "consequently , a state with negative entropy is impossible to observe in nature .",
    "the violation of the _ reality condition _",
    "@xmath32 signifies a genuine or absolute _ entropy crisis _ in nature .",
    "we will interpret the entropy crisis in this work to signify the reality condition violation @xmath33 and denote the temperature by @xmath7 the kauzmann temperature , when the violation begins as the temperature is reduced .",
    "it is widely recognized that @xmath9 is a theoretical point and not accessible by experiment . however , its accessibility in itself is not important if its usage helps us understand or explain glassy behavior .",
    "it is well known that absolute zero is inaccessible ; yet the study of a statistical model at @xmath1 is a time - honored first step to study the physics of the model at higher temperatures .",
    "the concept of a kauzmann temperature enables us to explain many glassy behavior .",
    "for example , the existence of the entropy crisis at a non - zero temperature is conceptually necessary for the observed vogel - fulcher behavior in fragile systems .",
    "its importance can not be denied just because it is experimentally inaccessible .",
    "a majority of the experts in the field continues to find the kauzmann temperature to be an extremely useful concept .",
    "the most important consequence of a positive @xmath9 is that there is a lower limit to supercooling before an experimental glass transition must intervene , and this lower limit is not absolute zero .",
    "this is an extremely useful information for experimentalists who are interested in investigating glassy behavior .",
    "the following two experimental observations play a very important role in our understanding of the glass transition :    ( expt1 ) the heat capacity of the glassy state can be substantially different from that of the corresponding crystal at the same temperature@xcite .",
    "( expt2 ) the energy of the glassy state ( @xmath34 after extrapolation to absolute zero is higher than that of the cr energy @xmath35 .     based on these observations , we have recently proposed@xmath36 a mechanism behind the entropy crisis and the ideal glass transition in the sms of a system of long polymers .",
    "the proposed mechanism is as follows .",
    "* entropy crisis * * * mechanism  * * _ _ since _ _ @xmath37 _ _  the sms free energy rises rapidly below the melting temperature _ _ @xmath38 _ _  as the system is cooled and crosses the _ _ ( @xmath39__cr free energy _ _ @xmath4 _ _  at some positive temperature _ _ 0__@xmath40__@xmath41 _ _  the sms free energy again equals _ _ @xmath42 _ _  at _ _ @xmath1__. therefore , it must go through a maximum at _ _",
    "0__@xmath40__@xmath43 _ _ , at which the entropy of the system vanishes . since negative entropy below _ _",
    "_  is not possible for physical states , the sms below _ _",
    "@xmath9 _ _  is replaced by an ideal glass with a constant free energy  _ _ @xmath12 _ _ , and zero entropy and heat capacity . _ _",
    "since the above two experimental observations are the main ingredients for the proposed mechanism , it appears likely that the mechanism is common to all glass forming systems with metastability , and not just restricted to long polymers .",
    "if true , this will suggest that the above mechanism is a generic root cause of the entropy crisis at a positive temperature in all systems in which glasses are formed by cooling their metastable states .",
    "however , the situation has become very confusing , as there have appeared several recent arguments@xmath44 against the existence of the entropy crisis .",
    "these arguments contradict many exact calculations@xmath45 and simulations@xmath24 that clearly establish a positive - temperature entropy crisis .",
    "we should also mention classical real gases , like the van der waals gas , or the classical ideal gas that are known to give entropy crisis at positive temperatures@xcite .",
    "it is , therefore , extremely important to clarify the issue , which we do by proving the general validity of the above mechanism behind all glass formation in metastable states .",
    "two important aspects in the mechanism require general justification@xcite :    ( m1 ) the sms free energy , obtained by mathematical continuation of the disordered equilibrium state below the melting temperature ,  and the cr free energy are the same at absolute zero .",
    "( m2 ) the temperature @xmath9 when the entropy crisis occurs first is non - zero .",
    "together , they support the existence of an _ entropy crisis _ at a positive temperature .",
    "the importance of a mathematical proof is that it settles the issue once for all .",
    "however , another very important consequence of the proof is , as we will see here , that if a phase in some calculation gives rise to an entropy crisis , it means that there must be another ( ordered ) phase without an entropy crisis .",
    "the proof uses general but rigorous thermodynamic and statistical mechanical arguments , valid for classical or quantum systems .",
    "we verify our conclusions by two exact calculations , one of which is not a mean - field calculation .",
    "as the issue has remained unresolved for so long most certainly implies that its resolution is not trivial .",
    "_ _  _ _ thus , it should come as no surprise to the reader that our arguments are somewhat involved , can be divided into several clear parts , and require patience to go through . however , we believe that they are certainly not beyond the reach of a majority of the workers studying glasses .",
    "the proof of the validity of the above mechanism follows from the various theorems that we prove here . to guide the reader ,",
    "we summarize the strategy for the eventual demonstration .    \\1 .",
    "we first prove that for @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the lowest energy for which sms exists @xmath48 $ ] , the sms free energy must become equal to the ( @xmath49- cr free energy @xmath4 at a positive temperature @xmath50 neither the sms entropy nor its inverse slope at @xmath47 need vanish for this to hold .",
    "we then prove that if the energy of the sms state is higher than @xmath51 then its temperature must be positive . from this",
    "it follows that sms can not reach @xmath1 with an energy @xmath52 .",
    "we then prove that sms free energy at @xmath1 again equals @xmath4  at @xmath1 .",
    "thus , the sms free energy must have a maximum somewhere in the range @xmath53 the entropy at the maximum is zero , identifying the maximum with the kauzmann point and its temperature with @xmath9 .",
    "this also identifies the lowest energy @xmath47 with @xmath12 , the energy at @xmath54 this energy is greater than @xmath4 because of the non - negative sms heat capacity .",
    "the existence of the maximum in the sms free energy thus finally proves the existence of a kauzmann point .",
    "our general proof assumes the _ existence _ of sms s , so that thermodynamics can be applied .",
    "the need for the assumption is easy to understand . at present",
    ", our understanding of whether equilibrium states can be demonstrated to exist mathematically even in simple models is too limited .",
    "we should recall that the existence of equilibrium states is taken for granted as a _ postulate _ in statistical mechanics and thermodynamics , where it is well known that it is extremely hard to prove their existence .",
    "we quote huang@xmath55 :  `` statistical mechanics , however , does not describe how a system approaches equilibrium , nor does it determine whether a system can ever be found to be in equilibrium .",
    "it merely states what the equilibrium situation is for a given system . ''",
    "ruelle@xmath56 notes that equilibrium states are defined _ operationally _ by assuming that the state of an isolated system tends to an equilibrium state as time tends to + @xmath57 whether a real system actually approaches this state can not be answered .",
    "we make a similar assumption about the existence of sms within the _ restricted _ ensemble that will be introduced below .",
    "any analysis of thermal data on glasses and supercooled liquids requires using time - independent thermodynamics , as discussed above",
    ". thus , _ hypothesizing _ the existence of sms is perfectly justified by the practice in the field .",
    "the existence of supercooled liquids , and glasses in systems with short- or long - range interactions or structural glasses , and their stability over a long periods of time is undeniable .",
    "these stable states are a manifestation of sms in these systems .",
    "without such an assumption , we can not justify using conventional ( time - independent ) thermodynamics to analyze scl data .",
    "the two exact calculations in this work show that the hypothesis is not vacuous .",
    "the behavior in real systems is , of course , oblivious to the state of our knowledge and is not controlled by the fact that we can only demonstrate sms in a few exact calculations .      as said above , the entropy @xmath29 such as the configurational entropy , that we consider in this work represents the natural log of the number of microstates @xmath58 where @xmath31 is the average energy at that temperature . for the microstates to exist in nature",
    ", it is evident that @xmath58 must satisfy the _ _ reality condition__@xmath59 [ @xmath32 ] .",
    "however , a state with _ negative entropy _ can emerge in theoretical calculations or extrapolations .",
    "if it happens that the calculations or extrapolations result in a negative @xmath2 below some positive temperature @xmath7 this should be interpreted as the absence of real microstates available to the system at those temperatures and the system can not be found in those microstates in nature .",
    "it is this violation of the reality condition @xmath32 that signifies the genuine entropy crisis in nature .",
    "it should be noted that our criterion for the entropy crisis is much more stringent than the original kauzmann requirement @xmath61 since it is possible to have @xmath32 even though @xmath62 thus , our @xmath9 is lower than the corresponding temperature where @xmath63    there are two @xmath64 aspects of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics .",
    "the first one is the requirement of _ stability _ according to which thermodynamic quantities like the heat capacity , the compressibility , etc .",
    "must never be negative .",
    "the other aspect , independent of the stability criteria , is the _ reality _ condition that ensures that such states occur in nature@xcite .",
    "the reality issue is central in our approach and is discussed further below .",
    "we will see below that the mathematical extension of the free energy of the disordered liquid phase below the melting temperature @xmath38 will always satisfy the stability criteria everywhere ( @xmath65 ) , but the reality condition is satisfied only above some positive temperature @xmath54      majority of the calculations displaying stationary metastable states are in spin models , and are carried out at the level of the random - mixing approximation ( rma ) ; the latter is valid in the limit of infinite coordination number @xmath66 and vanishing interaction strength @xmath67 keeping @xmath68 is fixed and finite .",
    "this approximation is equivalent to solving the models in an _ infinite - dimensional _ space .",
    "this has given rise to the common folklore that sms s occur only in an infinite - dimensional _",
    "_  _ _ space whose coordination number is also infinite .",
    "this is incorrect as we will clearly demonstrate here by an explicit calculation .",
    "the calculation is a _ non - mean - field calculation _ carried out exactly in a 1-dimensional model and captures sms .",
    "_ _  _ _ the calculation is presented to overcome this folklore .",
    "the model also shows the entropy crisis in sms . another alternative way to visualize",
    "the rma is to think of long - range interactions in a finite - dimensional space .",
    "thus , another folklore is that sms does not exist for short range models .",
    "even frustration is considered in the folklore to be necessary for the glassy behavior .",
    "the second example in the work is that of an ising model with _ short - range interactions and no frustration .",
    "_ this example establishes not only the existence of sms in short range models but also that frustration is not necessary for the existence .",
    "the model is solved exactly on a husimi cactus ; hence , its thermodynamics is proper .",
    "it is true that the cactus can only be embedded in an infinite dimensional space , but locally it resembles a square lattice which has a finite coordination number .",
    "the important point to note is that the interactions are short - ranged .",
    "the dimensionality is relevant only if we are interested in critical exponents , which we are not in this work .",
    "the _ finite coordination number _ of the cactus makes our calculation very different from rma .",
    "our general proofs are certainly not based on rma ideas . from all the experience",
    "we have accumulated , the cactus provides a much better description of the square lattice model than the conventional mean - field ( rma ) , as we have shown elsewhere.@xmath69",
    "the stationary nature of the sms allows us to investigate it using the partition function ( pf ) formalism .",
    "we consider a system composed of @xmath70 particles confined in a given volume @xmath71 and at a given temperature @xmath72 .",
    "the thermodynamic limit is obtained by taking the simultaneous limits @xmath70 @xmath73 , and @xmath71 @xmath74 such that the volume per particle @xmath75 is kept fixed and finite .",
    "the internal degrees of freedom of the system contain the configurational ( i.e. , positional ) degrees of freedom and all other degrees of freedom like the translational degrees of freedom _ coupled _ to them@xcite .",
    "the canonical pf determined by these degrees of freedom is given by @xmath76 where the trace operation @xmath77is over the coupled degrees of freedom  and @xmath78 @xmath72 being the system temperature in the units of the boltzmann constant @xmath79 in the following , we will usually suppress the index @xmath70 on the pf , unless necessary .",
    "the energy of the system @xmath31 is determined by the coupled degrees of freedom .",
    "the pf in ( [ dofz ] ) is _ irreducible _ in that it can not be written as a product of several non - trivial pf s corresponding to independent sets of degrees of freedom ; see @xcite .",
    "some coupling between different degrees of freedom , no matter how weak , is required to achieve equilibrium so that they all share the same common temperature .",
    "the weaker the coupling , the longer the time required to come to equilibrium .",
    "the temperatures in different pf factors in the product need not be the same as there is no coupling between independent degrees of freedom .",
    "therefore , such a situation does not have to be considered here .",
    "we only consider the case of an irreducible pf in this work .",
    "the microstates over which the operation @xmath80 is carried out in ( [ dofz ] ) are determined by the coupled degrees of freedom , while the macrostates are determined by the thermodynamic variables @xmath70 , @xmath71 and the temperature @xmath72 . since the degrees of freedom are not part of the macroscopic description , but the average energy defined below is , it is convenient to replace the trace operation in ( [ dofz ] ) by a trace only over the energy of each microstates .",
    "we classify different realizations of the degrees of freedom , i.e. the microstates , according to their energy @xmath31 , so that @xmath58 is the number of microstates of energy @xmath31 .",
    "we can now transform the above pf in ( [ dofz ] ) into @xmath81 where tr now stands for the trace operation over the energy ( eigenvalues ) @xmath82 up to its maximum@xmath17 we also introduce the following extensive quantities @xmath83 here , @xmath84 is the conventional helmholtz free energy .",
    "since the sign of the entropy is an important issue in the study of glasses , it is important that the entropy be introduced using the _ number _ of microstates @xmath30 so that @xmath85 .",
    "this requires some kind of _ discretization _ of the degrees of freedom @xcite to count the microstates . in the following",
    ", we will assume that such a discretization has been carried out so that we always have @xmath85 for states that occur in nature .",
    "this ensures that the corresponding _ microstate _",
    "entropy @xmath86  due to the coupled degrees of freedom  is non - negative . despite this",
    ", we will see below that negative entropies can be obtained from the free energy associated with the sms at low temperatures , even though the free energy itself is stable @xcite .",
    "this will force us to conclude that an ideal glass transition must intervene to avoid the resulting entropy crisis .",
    "the pf in ( [ pf ] ) is irreducible .",
    "it can happen in some cases that the pf is a product of several non - trivial pf s corresponding to independent sets of degrees of freedom , each set containing only coupled degrees of freedom ; see @xcite .",
    "the application of the reality condition to each set requires that the entropy from each set be non - negative for the system to occur in nature .",
    "the entropy crisis occurs when any of the entropies from the independent sets ( each containing coupled degrees of freedom ) becomes negative even if the total entropy due to all sets is non - negative .",
    "the thermodynamic limit is obtained by taking @xmath87 keeping @xmath75 fixed .",
    "to make the discussion clear , we will exhibit the subscript @xmath70 in various quantities in this subsection .",
    "the limit is taken by considering the sequence formed by @xmath88 for different values of @xmath70 as @xmath89 the volume may be changed according to @xmath90 for proper thermodynamics , the limit of the sequence must exist , which we denote by @xmath91    we express the fact that @xmath92 is fixed by stating that @xmath71 is a homogeneous function of order 1 in @xmath93 similarly , the existence of the limit @xmath94 is expressed by stating that @xmath95or @xmath96 are homogeneous functions of order 1 in @xmath93 one can also say that the temperature @xmath72 is a homogeneous function of order 0 in @xmath93 the average energy @xmath97 and the entropy @xmath98  are homogeneous functions of order 1 in @xmath93 for any quantity @xmath99 which is a homogeneous function of order 1 in @xmath100 the ratio @xmath101 is a homogeneous function of order 0 in @xmath70 and must possess a limit @xmath66  as @xmath89 we express this fact in the following as @xmath102 whose significance is as follows :  for finite @xmath70 , the meaning of ( [ hf00 ] ) is that the right side may differ from @xmath66 , but the difference vanishes as @xmath89    * remark 1 * : in the following , whenever we compare different extensive quantities @xmath103 or different pf s @xmath104 , it is implicit that we are comparing the ratios @xmath105 or @xmath106 respectively .",
    "the average energy and entropy in the canonical ensemble are continuous functions of @xmath72 and are given by    @xmath107    respectively ; we have suppressed the subscript @xmath70 for simplicity .",
    "they should not be confused with the microstate energy @xmath31 and entropy @xmath108 to see this clearly , we rewrite ( [ avs ] ) as  @xmath109 and exponentiate it .",

    "the difference between them is due to the last term in ( [ contw ] ) , which is non - negative , which vanishes as @xmath89 for finite @xmath100  the microstate entropy @xmath0 represent isolated points , which get closer and closer to the continuous function @xmath125 as @xmath70  increases , and cover it entirely as @xmath89  similarly , @xmath119 represents a continuous variable , and contains in its range isolated values given by the microstate energies ; the latter cover the entire range of @xmath119 as @xmath89     the continuous function @xmath125 is amenable to differentiation , which is not possible with the discrete set of points @xmath126 and contains all the useful physical information . because of this , there is no harm in expressing @xmath125 simply by @xmath0 ; the latter now represents a continuous function@xmath17 similarly , there is no harm in expressing the continuous variable @xmath119 by @xmath31 .",

    "the equilibrium ordered phase corresponding to @xmath414  disappear completely , and the disordered phase corresponding to @xmath405 becomes the equilibrium phase .",

    "consequently , there is _",
    "no _ kauzmann point since there is _ no _ other ordered state any more , as argued above .",
    "thus , our exact calculation confirms our earlier conclusion that the existence of an ordered state is crucial for the existence of the entropy crisis . the existence of an ordered state sets the zero of the temperature scale by its minimum energy @xmath4 .",
    "this scale then sets the temperature @xmath9 of the lowest sms energy @xmath233 to be positive .",
    "thus , one must consider the ordered and the metastable states together .",
    "we also observe that there is no singularity in @xmath405 or @xmath459 at @xmath417 , even though there is a phase transition there .",
    "similarly , there is no singularity in @xmath460 or @xmath461 at @xmath450  thus , the thermodynamic singularity in the equilibrium free energy does not necessarily create a singularity in @xmath459 or @xmath461 at @xmath462 as was discussed earlier .",
    "the existence of a singularity or spinodal at some other temperature is a different matter .",
    "it should be noted that the eigenvalues @xmath405 and @xmath414 are independent of the size of the lattice .",

    "in addition , we are interested in a first - order transition for conventional supercooling .",
    "we will , therefore , use an anti - ferromagnetic ising model in zero magnetic field with both two - spin ( @xmath466 ) , and three - spin interactions ( @xmath467 ) ; the latter ensures that the melting transition is first order . in order to solve the model exactly",
    ", we consider a husimi cactus made of squares , on which the model can be solved exactly@xcite .",
    "we consider the simplest cactus in which only two squares meet at a site ; they can not share a lattice bond .",
    "the squares are connected so that there are no closed loops except those formed by the squares .",
    "the cactus can be thought as an approximation of a square lattice , so that the exact husimi cactus solution can be thought of as an approximate solution of the square lattice model .",
    "there is a sublattice structure at low temperatures caused by the anti - ferromagnetic interaction :  particles of one species are found on one of the two sublattices .",
    "we identify this ordered structure as a crystal .",
    "the interaction energy is @xmath468 the first sum is over nearest - neighbor spin pairs and the second over neighboring spin triplets within each square . in the absence of the three - spin coupling ,",
    "the two - spin coupling gives rise to an antiferromagnetic ( af ) ordering at low temperatures .",
    "for @xmath469 the af ordering remains the preferred ordering , while for @xmath470  the ferromagnetic ordering is prefereed .",

    "the fix - point solution becomes independent of the level index @xmath380 as we move towards the origin @xmath472 , and is represented by @xmath479 for the current problem , it is given by @xmath480 , as can be checked explicitly by the above recursion relation in ( [ rr ] ) .",
    "it is obvious that it exists at all temperatures .",
    "there is no singularity in this fix - point solution .",
    "this solution corresponds to the disordered paramagnetic phase at high temperatures and the sms below the melting transition .",
    "the other fix - point solution is a 2-cycle solution , which has been found and discussed earlier in the semi - flexible polymer problem@xmath36 , the dimer model@xmath481 and star and dendrimer solutions@xmath482 the fix - point solution alternates between two values @xmath483 and @xmath484 on two successive levels . at @xmath5",
    "this solution is given either by @xmath485 and @xmath486 or by @xmath487 and @xmath488  the system picks one of these as the solution . at and near @xmath5",
    "this solution corresponds to the low temperature af - ordered phase , which represents the cr and its excitation at equal occupation , and can be obtained numerically .",
    "the 1-cycle free energy is calculated by the general method proposed in @xcite , and the 2-cycle free energy is calculated by the method given in @xcite .    for @xmath489",
    "we find that @xmath490 , where there is a discontinuity in the entropy per site of 0.0168 .",

    "thus , the free energy diagram we obtain in this case is similar to that in the inset in fig . 1 .",
    "the work was motivated by a desire to identify a general thermodynamic mechanism for the glass transition . for this",
    ", we identify a general thermodynamic condition .",
    "this general principle has also been verified in some recent work on lattice models that have been carried out@xcite , and has its foundation in the original idea of the entropy crisis @xmath495 noted by kauzmann , and is as follows .",
    "the entropy due to a set of coupled degrees of freedom , when properly defined either using quantum mechanics or by discretization as in a lattice model , can never be negative , since the number of configurations for a given set of macroscopic quantities must be an integer @xmath496 consequently , this condition of non - negative entropy @xmath295 is nothing but the condition of reality .",
    "its violation gives rise to the concept of absolute entropy crisis .",
    "it is in this sense we have used the entropy crisis in this work .",
    "such a notion is more stringent than the kauzmann criterion that @xmath497 be not negative , for which there is no thermodynamic justification , as we have argued in the introduction . for the glass transition , we are interested in the set of coupled degrees of freedom that contains the configurational ( i.e. , positional ) degrees of freedom .",
    "the entropy of such a set , regardless of whether quantum or classical mechanics is used in its calculation , is what we call the configurational entropy .",
    "it should be noted that there are various other definitions of the configurational entropy in the literature .",
    "many workers take @xmath497 to denote the configurational entropy . however , as said above , there is no thermodynamic basis for @xmath497 to be non - negative .",
    "so , it can not play any role in a thermodynamic theory of glass transition .",
    "the landscape picture identifies the entropy @xmath498 of the inherent structure with the configurational entropy .",
    "its vanishing is used to identify the glass transition .",
    "it is easy to see@xcite that for the classical configurational pf , the two entropies are related : @xmath499 where @xmath500 is the entropy arising from the average basin pf @xmath501 in the landscape picture .",
    "thus , our criterion @xmath502 of the entropy crisis is also stringent than @xmath503 in the landscape picture .",
    "our criterion will also require @xmath504 which can only occur at a temperature lower than the temperature at which @xmath505 it should be noted that there is no kinetic energy contribution in @xmath506 as the landscape picture deals only with the classical configurational pf ; the translational degrees of freedom are decoupled in classical mechanics , as discussed above .",
    "the best known example of classical models giving rise to negative entropy at low temperatures is the ideal gas .",
    "similarly , classical real gases also give rise to negative entropy at low temperatures .",
    "this problem can be easily traced to the fact that we are treating the real and momentum spaces as continuum@xcite .",
    "another well - known example is the tonks gas of rods in one - dimension ( no kinetic energy ) , which also gives negative entropy at high coverage@xcite . here",
    ", the one - dimensional space is treated as continuum . on the other hand",
    ", it is well known that a classical lattice model will never give rise to negative entropy .",
    "similarly , the random energy model@xcite , which treats energy as continuum , gives negative entropy at low temperatures .",
    "it is clear that the problem of negative entropy is not due to the classical nature of the systems , but due to the continuum nature of the model@xcite . to ensure non - negative entropy",
    ", we must discretize the model , as we have discussed here . once this has been done",
    ", the entropy crisis becomes a genuine crisis imposed by the reality condition as we have proposed earlier      the general thermodynamic mechanism of the ideal glass transition occurs in any system that has an ordered state , distinct from the high - temperature disordered state .",
    "the continuation of the free energy of the disordered state below the melting transition at @xmath38 gives the free energy of the stationary metastable state .",
    "we have shown that this continuation always gives rise to a stable free energy .",
    "for example , it gives rise to a non - negative heat capacity for @xmath411 .",
    "this sms free energy @xmath199 becomes equal to @xmath4 at @xmath507 , as the temperature is reduced .",
    "the energy continues to drop until finally , @xmath508 at @xmath277  since @xmath509 at @xmath1 and at @xmath510 , it must have a maximum at some intermediate temperature @xmath511 the energy @xmath233 at @xmath9 because of positive heat capacity .",
    "the entropy is zero at @xmath9 and negative below @xmath9 .",
    "thus , the sms over the range @xmath512 is unphysical and must be replaced by the ideal glass .",
    "the above mechanism has been shown to be generic by the rigorous analysis , which is valid for classical and quantum systems . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", this result is the first of its kind and shows that the entropy crisis is genuine in those systems in which there is a more stable ordered state than the disordered sms .",
    "we have also considered models@xcite in which there are two possible transitions ; one of them is from a disordered phase to an intermediate phase , and the second one at a lower temperature from the intermediate phase to an ordered phase . in this case , two possible sms s as the continuation of the disordered and intermediate phases emerge , with .",
    "each extension giving rise to its own entropy crisis ; in addition , both have the same free energy as @xmath1 as the ordered phase .",
    "thus , the mechanism is generic .",
    "the transition between sms and the ideal glass is not brought about by any thermodynamic singularity at @xmath513 rather , it is _ imposed _ by the reality requirement . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", the ideal glass state does _ not _ explicitly emerge as a phase in any calculation that has been carried out so far , including the two that are presented here . in this sense , this transition is a very special kind of transition , which does not seem to belong to the class of phase transitions in which various phases emerge in the calculation .",
    "the two examples that we have presented here show the existence of sms .",
    "thus , they demonstrate that our hypothesis of sms existence is not vacuous .",
    "both examples also show genuine entropy crisis in sms .",
    "thus , they provide support for the violation of the reality condition in sms at a positive temperature in exact calculations . we need to invoke an ideal glass transition at this temperature in each model .",
    "the one - dimensional exact calculation is not a mean - field type calculation , and is presented not only to overcome the folklore that sms s exist only at the mean - field level , but also to explicitly confirm the theorems .",
    "it is a model of a polymer system and confirms all the theorems . in particular",
    ", it shows that as @xmath404 , the ideal glass transition disappears because there is no ordered state anymore .",
    "hence , our results are not of mean - field nature .",
    "the second example is also presented not only to overcome the folklore that frustration is crucial in the transition , but also to establish that entropy crisis is possible in systems containing small molecules , and not just polymers .",
    "there is no frustration in the ising model because the cactus consists of squares .",
    "this example also confirms the theorems and the corollary .",
    "both examples show that the ideal glass transition occurs at a positive temperature and the energy @xmath12 at that temperature is higher than @xmath51 the ideal cr  energy at @xmath1 .",
    "this means that the ideal glass has a higher energy than the crystal at absolute zero , in conformity with the experiments .",
    "we now come to a very important consequence of our corollary .",
    "it is the following .",
    "the presence of an entropy crisis at a positive temperature implies that there must exist an equilibrium state for which no entropy crisis can exist .",
    "the equilibrium states in any system or model calculation , if carried out exactly , will _ never _ give rise to any entropy crisis at a positive temperature .",
    "this is because the lowest energy @xmath4 determines the lowest allowed temperature @xmath1 in the system , even for a finite system .",
    "since there can not be any singularity in any finite - system equilibrium free energy , the latter should continue all the way down to @xmath1 and the equilibrium entropy must remain non - negative at all temperatures ; the latter can only vanish at @xmath277 thus , there would be no entropy crisis at a positive temperature in the equilibrium state .",
    "this will remain true as the thermodynamic limit is taken .",
    "thus , _ no _ entropy crisis can occur at a finite temperature in the equilibrium state in that the entropy becomes _ negative _ below that temperature .",
    "however , it is possible that as @xmath87 the equilibrium free energy becomes horizontal , so that the entropy vanishes , over a non - zero temperature range @xmath514 since the equilibrium free energy exists with non - negative entropy for all @xmath411 for finite @xmath70 , the free energy must show a singularity at @xmath515 while the system is frozen over the range @xmath516 its appearance is accompanied by a phase transition .",
    "( this should be contrasted with the existence of a kauzmann point , below which the entropy becomes negative , but its appearance is not accompanied by any singularity in the sms free energy . replacing the unphysical sms free energy below the kauzmann point by a frozen state",
    "is done by hand ; it does not emerge as part of the calculation . )",
    "thus , we conclude that equilibrium state in any system will never show an entropy crisis at a positive temperature .",
    "the zero of the temperature scale is determined by the lowest possible energy @xmath228 if any exact calculation for the free energy or the entropy predicts an entropy crisis at a positive temperature , this will necessarily imply that there must exist another state , the equilibrium state , which will not show an entropy crisis .",
    "this observation has been crucial in a recent investigation of a dimer model @xcite in which the disordered phase underwent a first - order transition to an equilibrium ordered phase .",
    "the ordered phase then gave rise to an entropy crisis at a lower temperature , which forced us to look for another equilibrium state , which was eventually discovered above the temperature where the entropy crisis was found , so that the crisis occurred in a metastable state ( this time emerging form an intermediate ordered state ) as we have suggested and followed the mechanism proposed here .",
    "finally , we wish to make connection of the ideal glass energy @xmath12 with the inherent structure in the landscape picture",
    ". the ideal glass at @xmath517 in the canonical ensemble must be at a local minimum in the landscape .",
    "hence , its energy must be the energy of the particular inherent structure .",
    "since the ideal glass emerges at @xmath9 , where @xmath518 we are forced to conclude that this inherent structure also represents sms at @xmath519 this most certainly implies that sms must be confined in the basin associated with the sms inherent structure .",
    "this confinement must occur at a higher temperature ( than @xmath520 where @xmath505    in conclusion , we have justified the mechanism that gives rise to an entropy crisis in metastable states in systems in which there exists is a more stable phase .",
    "the generality of the mechanism is reflected in the generality of the validation of the mechanism , which is common in classical and quantum mechanical systems .",
    "it is well known that the configurational entropy in continuum space can become negative .",
    "this is true of the ideal gas at low temperatures . from the exact solution of the classical tonks gas of rods in one dimension",
    ", one also finds that the entropy becomes negative at high coverage .",
    "the stability criteria such as a non - negative heat capacity that immediately follow from the pf  formulation are independent of the non - negative entropy requirement .",
    "thus , it is possible for the sms to have a negative entropy over some temperature range .",
    "this will only means that such states are not observable in nature .",
    "in general , the total pf can be reduced to a product  of different pf s corresponding to independent degrees of freedom ( dsof ) .",
    "collisions between particles , which are not included in the pf , or weak quantum effects bring about a common temperature between these dsof ; otherwise their temperatures need not be the same .",
    "the factorization implies that the entropy contribution due to each dof must not only be additive , but also non - negative individually to avoid the entropy crisis .",
    "we only consider the irreduible pf in ( 1 ) containig the interaction energy in the rest of the paper . in quantum statistical mechanics for a system at rest and without rotation , the total hamiltonian including the kinetic energy operator determines the pf in ( 1 ) ; thus , @xmath295 represents the total entropy @xmath523 including the kinetic energy contribution ."
