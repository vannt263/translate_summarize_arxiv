    "deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) , the scattering of a high energy lepton off a quark inside a nucleon , has been a proving ground for qcd , the theory of strong interactions .",
    "charged - leptons and neutrinos have been used to measure parton densities and their qcd evolution with high - precision over a wide range in @xmath3 .",
    "uniquely , neutrino dis , via the weak interaction probe , allows simultaneous measurement of two structure functions : @xmath0 and the parity - violating structure function , @xmath1 .    in this paper",
    "we present a new measurement of high - energy neutrino and anti - neutrino differential cross sections from high - statistics data samples .",
    "the differential dependence of neutrino and anti - neutrino cross sections on bjorken scaling variable , @xmath4 , and inelasticity , @xmath2 , provide the most model - independent physics observable for this process @xcite .",
    "previous high - statistics measurements of the neutrino and anti - neutrino differential cross section have been reported @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this experiment has two improvements : first , a sign - selected beam allowed separate neutrino and antineutrino running and , second , a calibration beam continuously measured the detector s response .",
    "the largest experimental uncertainties in previous measurements arose from knowledge of energy scale and detector response functions @xcite , @xcite .",
    "nutev addressed this by using a dedicated calibration beam of hadrons , electrons and muons that alternated with neutrino running once every minute throughout the one year data - taking peroid .",
    "the calibration beam was used to measure the detector response for hadrons and muons over a wide range of energies ( 5 - 200  gev ) .",
    "detector response functions and energy scales for muons and hadrons were mapped over the full active area of the detector .",
    "energy scales for muons and hadrons were determined to a precision of 0.43% for hadrons and 0.7% for muons",
    "nutev s other improvement was separate neutrino and antineutrino running .",
    "nutev ran in two modes , ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) , with the muon spectrometer polarity always set to focus the primary charged - lepton from the interaction vertex ( _ e.g. _ @xmath7 in @xmath5-mode or @xmath8 in @xmath6-mode ) . in determining the charged - current differential cross sections , this allowed better and more uniform acceptance in the two running modes and removed ambiguity in the muon sign determination present in a mixed @xmath5 and @xmath6 beam .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized into four parts ; section ii describes the nutev detector , section iii gives the cross section extraction method and results , and section iv presents the extracted structure functions and the results are discussed in section v.",
    "the nutev experiment collected data during 1996 - 97 using separate high - purity @xmath9 and @xmath10 beam produced by the sign - selected quadrupole train ( ssqt ) beamline .",
    "a dipole magnet after the one - interaction - length beryllium oxide production target allowed the sign of secondary particles to be selected .",
    "neutrinos ( or anti - neutrinos ) are produced when sign - selected secondary pions and kaons decay in the @xmath11  m decay region located just downstream of ssqt optics .",
    "the nutev neutrino detector is @xmath12  km downstream of the beryllium oxide production target .",
    "neutrino energies ranged from 30 - 500  gev .",
    "figure [ fig : nuflux ] shows a prediction of the interacting @xmath9 and @xmath10 flux in each mode with it s small contribution from the wrong - sign background .",
    "the interacted neutrino fraction from @xmath13(@xmath5 ) in @xmath5(@xmath13)-mode is @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) .    the nutev / ccfr detector consisted of an 18  m long , 690  ton target calorimeter with a mean density of @xmath16 , followed by a 420  ton iron toroidal spectrometer .",
    "the target was composed of 168 steel plates , each @xmath17 , instrumented with liquid scintillator counters placed every two steel plates and drift chambers spaced every four plates .",
    "nutev refurbished the ccfr detector by replacing the scintillator oil and reconditioning the drift chambers .",
    "immediately downstream of the target - calorimeter was a magnetized iron toroidal spectrometer with inner radius 12.5  cm and outer radius 175  cm used to measure the momentum of high - energy muons exiting the downstream end of the target .",
    "the toroid spectrometer consisted of three magnetized sections each followed by a drift chamber station .",
    "two additional drift chamber stations were located a few meters downstream of the last magnetic section to analyze the highest momentum muons .",
    "the magnetic field in each toroidal section ( @xmath1815  kg ) was produced by four copper coils which emerged through the center hole .",
    "the magnetic field is azimuthal everywhere except for a small radial component in the region of the supporting feet and air gap between top and bottom halves of the washers .",
    "the azimuthal component of the field in the first toroid had an additional small asymmetry ( with respect to vertical ) due to a shorted coil on the west side . the detailed geometry of the spectrometer , ( including the missing coil ) , was input to ansys simulation @xcite to compute the magnetic field map .    a dedicated _ in situ _ calibration beam was used to determine the energy response of the calorimeter and spectrometer to hadrons , muons , and electrons and to map the response over the face of the detector .",
    "the tolerance of the calibration spectrometer to measure a beam particle s absolute momentum was 0.3% .",
    "the configuration is shown in figure [ fig : tb ] .",
    "details of the calibration and response measurements are given in @xcite .",
    "the hadronic resolution of the calorimeter was determined to be @xmath19 with an absolute scale uncertainty of @xmath20 .",
    "the latter uncertainty is dominated by the statistical precision in calibrating the time dependence of the counter response over a transverse grid for each counter .",
    "the absolute scale of the toroid spectrometer was calibrated with muons that were steered over the active area of the spectrometer .",
    "the magnetic field map from the ansys simulation was checked with the 50 gev muon calibration beam .",
    "the mean reconstructed muon momentum compared with the muon calibration beam had a 1@xmath21 variation of 0.63% over the active area of the toroid .",
    "this field map uncertainty is attributed to variation in magnetic susceptibility and thickness of the steel .",
    "the field map determination dominates the absolute muon energy scale uncertainty of 0.7% .",
    "in charged - current ( cc ) neutrino dis the @xmath5 scatters off a quark in the nucleon via exchange of a virtual @xmath22-boson .",
    "the cross section can be expressed in terms of structure functions , @xmath23 , @xmath0 , and @xmath1 + @xmath24\\\\ & & f_2(x , q^2 )   \\pm \\big[y-\\frac{y^2}{2}\\big]xf_3(x , q^2){\\big ) } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the fermi weak coupling constant , @xmath26 is the proton mass , @xmath27 is the incident neutrino energy in the lab frame , and @xmath2 , the inelasticity , is the fraction of energy transferred to the hadronic system .",
    "the @xmath28 term is added for neutrino interactions and is subtracted for antineutrinos .",
    "@xmath29 , the ratio of the cross section for scattering from longitudinally to transversely polarized w - bosons relates @xmath0 and @xmath23 @xmath30 structure functions depend on @xmath4 , the bjorken scaling variable , and @xmath3 , the four momentum squared of the virtual w - boson .",
    "relativistic invariant kinematic variables , @xmath4 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 can be evaluated in the lab frame using the three experimentally measured quantities : @xmath31 , energy of the outgoing primary charged - lepton , @xmath32 the energy deposited at the hadronic vertex , and @xmath33 , the scattering angle of the primary muon . @xmath34",
    "@xmath35 @xmath36 where the neutrino energy , @xmath37 , is reconstructed from the measured final state particle energies .",
    "events used in this analysis were triggered by the presence of a penetrating muon track determined by in - time hits in scintillation counters in the most downstream region of the target calorimeter and in the first station of the toroid spectrometer .",
    "this allowed acceptance for charged current events down to zero hadron energy .",
    "@xmath32 is determined by summing the pulse heights of consecutive counters from just downstream of the event vertex to five counters beyond the end of the shower region .",
    "longitudinal position of the event vertex is defined as the first of at least two consecutive counters with greater than four times the energy deposited by a minimum ionizing particle ( mip ) .",
    "the end of the shower region is the last counter before three consecutive counters with less than four mip s .",
    "energy deposited by the primary muon in this region is removed by subtracting the most probable energy loss for each counter in the sum .",
    "this energy is included in the reconstructed muon energy .",
    "@xmath38 at the event vertex is reconstructed in two parts : energy deposited in the target calorimeter ( typically less than 10  gev ) and remaining energy that is measured in the downstream toroid spectrometer .",
    "energy deposited in the target calorimeter includes the muon energy within the shower region ( discussed above ) and energy deposited beyond the shower region before the muon exits the calorimeter .",
    "the latter is determined from the pulse height of energy deposited in each counter by the muon . for small pulse heights , ( @xmath39 mips ) ,",
    "the muon energy loss is assumed to arise from ionization processes and is converted to gev using an @xmath38 dependent conversion function which was optimized using geant to reproduce both the most probable value and the width of this component of the energy loss ( see @xcite ) . for larger pulse heights ( @xmath40 mips ) ,",
    "the energy is assumed to have a contribution from catastrophic processes ( _ i.e. _  bremsstrahlung , pair production ) .",
    "therefore , the additional amount above 5 mips is converted to gev using a calibration constant determined from the calorimeter s electromagnetic response .",
    "the contribution to the muon energy resolution from determination of energy loss in the target is small for high energy muons and dominated by a long tail produced by catastrophic energy loss processes .",
    "muons that enter the toroid spectrometer are focused and tracked through the spectrometer where they are momentum analyzed .",
    "figure [ fig : pres ] shows the momentum resolution for the toroid spectrometer determined using test beam muons .",
    "the gaussian contribution is dominated by multiple coulomb scattering ( mcs ) and is independent of momentum ( @xmath18  11% ) .",

    "the small dependence on hadron energy comes from an @xmath32 dependent cut excluding tracking chambers near the event vertex due to the presence of additional hits in the shower region .",
    "the following criteria were used to select the events for the cross section sample :    * _ event containment : _ transverse vertex within 125  cm from detector center and longitudinal vertex at least four counters beyond the upstream end of the detector and beginning at least twenty counters from the downstream end . * _ reconstructed muon energy : _ a single muon in the event with minimum energy , @xmath58  gev . * _ reconstructed muon track in toroid : _ transverse position within , @xmath59 radius @xmath60  cm upon entering ; minimum penetration of track to the second chamber station ; and minimum fraction of integrated track in steel @xmath61 . * _ reconstructed hadronic energy : _",

    "at moderate @xmath4 , this result agrees well with ccfr over the full energy and @xmath2 range of the data , both in level and in shape , and agrees in level with cdhsw .",
    "the cdhsw measurement has a known @xmath3 shape difference with ccfr @xcite , and thus also with this result .",
    "there are differences in nutev and ccfr at @xmath131 where ccfr s measurement for both neutrino and antineutrino cross sections are consistently below our result for all energies .",
    "this is suprising since nutev used the refurbished ccfr detector and the analysis methods used by the two experiments were very similar . we discuss below several sources which may contribute to the high-@xmath4 cross section difference .",
    "we have determined that the largest single contribution to the discrepancy is due to a mis - calibration of the magnetic field map of the toroid in ccfr .",
    "nutev performed thorough calibrations of muon and hadron responses in the detector , including mapping the response over the detector active area and measuring the energy scale over a wide range of energies @xcite .",
    "this allowed nutev to measure precisely the radial dependence of the magnetic field in the toroid .",
    "both experiments used the same muon spectrometer ; therefore , the model of the magnetic field could have a different overall normalization , but the radial dependence ( which is determined by the geometry of the muon spectrometer ) should be the same for both .",
    "ccfr used one high statistics muon test beam run aimed at a single point in the spectrometer to set the absolute energy scale and modeled the radial dependence of the magnetic field using poisson @xcite .",
    "nutev used ansys to model the field and compared the prediction to a precision test beam map data .",
    "the width of the residual fractional difference distribution over the 45 test beam points is the main contribution to the absolute muon energy scale uncertainty ( 0.7% ) .",
    "if nutev uses the ccfr model the result is shifted to within 1.6 sigma agreement with ccfr at @xmath137 .",
    "this accounts for 6% of the 18% difference at @xmath137 .",
    "the field model differences can also be translated into an effective 0.8% difference in the muon energy scales by integrating the difference in the field models over the toroid .",
    "the cross section model contributes an additional @xmath183% to the discrepancy seen at x=0.65 .",
    "both experiments determine acceptance corrections using an iterated fit to the cross section data . because the measured cross sections are different , this necessarily requires that the respective cross section models reflect the data differences .",
    "for example , the nutev model is above ccfr by @xmath167 at x=0.65 .",
    "we have extracted cross sections using ccfr cross section model@xcite and find that this contributes @xmath183% to the discrepancy seen at x=0.65 .",
    "other smaller sources for the difference come from muon and hadron energy smearing models which can also contribute to extracted cross section differences through acceptance corrections .",
    "we have determined that using the ccfr muon and hadron smearing models results in a difference of @xmath168 at @xmath137 . in nutev",
    "the hadron energy response was found to have a small nonlinearity due to the shower @xmath169 fraction dependence on energy @xcite .",
    "this nonlinearity was taken into account in nutev but not in ccfr .",
    "the effect of incorporating the hadron energy scale nonlinearity is small and contributes mainly to the @xmath3 dependence .",
    "all together these three contributions account for about two thirds of the high-@xmath4 cross section difference seen .",
    "this brings the two measurements within 1.2 sigma agreement in the high-@xmath4 region .",
    "another significant difference in the two experiments is that , while both used wide - band beams , nutev s beam was sign - selected . in nutev ,",
    "neutrino and anti - neutrino data were taken using separate high - purity beams .",
    "this allowed nutev to run the detector s toroidal magnetic field polarity always set to focus the `` right - sign '' of muon produced in charged - current interactions . in ccfr ,",
    "the beam had an 11% anti - neutrino component and neutrino and anti - neutrino data were taken simultaneously .",
    "the toroidal field polarity was reversed perodically to alternately focus either @xmath8 or @xmath7 . to obtain adequate antineutrino statistics ccfr ran approximately half the time in focussing mode for each muon sign .",
    "this has two effects on the ccfr analysis that are not present in nutev .",
    "first , the acceptance corrections are different depending on whether the toroid is set to focus or defocus the muon .",
    "second , in defocussing mode acceptance corrections are larger and consequently need to be more accurately determined .",
    "acceptance falls off rapidly with @xmath2 at high-@xmath4 , especially in defocussing mode where low - energy and wide - angle muons are deflected outward and spend less time the toroid magnetic field .",
    "ccfr had no test beam data for defocussing mode and , while acceptance corrections were modeled with a field simulation , the smearing model was assumed to be the same in both modes . we speculate that this difference may also contribute to the discrepancy seen .",
    "figures [ compf2 ] and [ compxf3 ] show a comparison of nutev and ccfr data with two theory models .",
    "the plot on figure [ compf2 ] shows the ratio of @xmath0 to the thorne - roberts variable - flavor scheme ( trvfs ) nlo qcd model @xcite using the mrst2001 nlo @xmath120 set @xcite for all @xmath4 bins . the @xmath146 error band from the @xmath120 set is also shown .",
    "the second theory curve shown on the plot is acot fixed - flavor scheme ( acotffs ) nlo model @xcite using cteq5hq1 @xcite @xmath120s .",
    "similarily , the plot on figure [ compxf3 ] shows the same comparison for @xmath1 .",
    "all theory models have been corrected for target - mass effects using the georgi - politzer model @xcite .",
    "these are important at high-@xmath4 and low-@xmath3 .",
    "for example , they increase the theory prediction by about 5% at @xmath137 and @xmath170  gev@xmath65 . to make a direct comparison ,",
    "the theory curves are also corrected for nuclear target effects .",
    "a standard treatment of nuclear effects , which are not well determined for neutrino scattering , is to apply corrections measured in charged - leptons scattering from nuclear targets @xcite .",
    "we use a multiplicative correction factor of the form @xcite @xmath171 obtained from a fit to charged - lepton scattering on nuclear targets .",
    "the correction is independent of @xmath3 and is small at intermediate @xmath4 but is large at low and high @xmath4 , ( 10% at @xmath172 and increases from 7% at @xmath133 to 15% at @xmath137 ) .",
    "the data show reasonable agreement with both the trvfs(mrst2001e ) and the acotffs(cteq5hq1 ) nlo qcd calculations for most of the @xmath4 and @xmath3 range . at low @xmath4 ( @xmath172 and @xmath173 ) both nutev and ccfr results have different @xmath3 dependence than theoretical predictions . at high-@xmath4 ( @xmath174 ) our data",
    "are systematically above the theory predictions .",
    "compared with the trvfs(mrst2001e ) model the data are 15 - 20% high at @xmath137 and 25 - 40% at @xmath175 .",
    "the data are about 10% higher at @xmath137 and 15% at @xmath175 than the acotffs(cteq5hq1 ) model prediction .",
    "the @xmath3 dependence of the high - x data is similar to the prediction from the acotffs(cteq5hq1 ) model .",
    "a different theoretical treatment of nuclear effects could make a sizable difference at small and large @xmath4 .",
    "nutev perhaps indicates that neutrino scattering favors smaller nuclear effects at high-@xmath4 than are found in charged - lepton scattering . at small @xmath4 , new theoretical calculations",
    "show that in the shadowing region the nuclear correction has @xmath3 dependence @xcite .",
    "the standard nuclear correction obtained from a fit to charged lepton data implies a suppression of 10% independent of @xmath3 at @xmath172 , while for @xmath172 reference @xcite finds a suppression of 15% at @xmath176gev@xmath65 and suppression of 3.4% at @xmath177gev@xmath65 .",
    "this effect somewhat improves agreement with data at low-@xmath4 .",
