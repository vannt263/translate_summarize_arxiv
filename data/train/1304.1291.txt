    "in this article we are interested in the accuracy of gaussian beam approximations to solutions of the high frequency helmholtz equation with a source term , @xmath4 here @xmath5 is the wave number , assumed to be large , @xmath6 is the index of refraction and @xmath7 is a source function which in general also depends on @xmath0 .",
    "we assume that both @xmath7 and @xmath8 vanish for @xmath9 .",
    "the nonnegative parameter @xmath10 represents absorption .",
    "it is zero in the limit of zero absorption , where @xmath1 solutions of become solutions satisfying the standard radiation condition .    the helmholtz equation ( [ ho ] )",
    "is widely used to model wave propagation problems in application areas like electromagnetics , geophysics and acoustics .",
    "numerical simulation of helmholtz becomes expensive when the frequency of the waves is high . in direct discretization methods a large number of grid points is then needed to resolve the wave oscillations , and the computational cost to maintain constant accuracy grows algebraically with the frequency .",
    "the helmholtz equation is typically even more difficult to handle in this regime than time - dependent wave equations , as numerical discretizations lead to large indefinite and ill - conditioned linear systems of equations , for which it is difficult to find efficient preconditioners @xcite . at sufficiently high frequencies direct simulations are not feasible .    as an alternative",
    "one can use high frequency asymptotic models for wave propagation , such as geometrical optics @xcite , which is obtained when the frequency tends to infinity .",
    "the solution of the partial differential equation ( pde ) is assumed to be of the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the phase , and @xmath13 is the amplitude of the solution . in the limit @xmath14",
    "the phase and amplitude are independent of the frequency and vary on a much coarser scale than the full wave solution .",
    "they can therefore be computed at a computational cost independent of the frequency . however",
    ", a main drawback of geometrical optics is that the model breaks down at caustics , where rays concentrate and the predicted amplitude @xmath13 becomes unbounded .",
    "gaussian beams form another high frequency asymptotic model which is closely related to geometrical optics . however , unlike geometrical optics , the phase @xmath12 is complex - valued , and there is no breakdown at caustics .",
    "the solution is still assumed to be of the form ( [ goform ] ) , but it is concentrated near a single ray of geometrical optics . to form such a solution , we first pick a ray and solve systems of ordinary differential equations along it to find the taylor expansions of the phase and amplitude in variables transverse to the ray .",
    "although the phase function is real - valued along the central ray , its imaginary part is chosen so that the solution decays exponentially away from the central ray , maintaining a gaussian - shaped profile . for",
    "the simplest first order beams the phase @xmath12 is a second order taylor expansion , while the amplitude @xmath13 is a zeroth order expansion . for wave equations one can use time as a parameter for the rays , and the expressions for the phase and amplitude are @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the geometrical optics ray , @xmath17 is the direction of the ray and the second derivative matrix @xmath18 encodes the width and curvature of the beam ; @xmath19 has a positive definite imaginary part which ensures the beam has a gaussian shape . in the helmholtz case ,",
    "since there is no longer a distinguished variable with level sets transverse to the rays , one uses taylor expansion in the plane orthogonal to the ray direction .",
    "higher order beams are constructed through higher order taylor expansions in ( [ phaseamp ] ) .",
    "the existence of gaussian beam solutions to the wave equation has been known since sometime in the 1960 s , first in connection with lasers , see babi and buldyrev @xcite .",
    "later , they were used in the analysis of propagation of singularities in pdes by hrmander @xcite and ralston @xcite . in the context of the schrdinger equation",
    "first order beams correspond to classical coherent states .",
    "higher order versions of these have been introduced to approximate the schrdinger equation in quantum chemistry by e.g. heller @xcite , hagedorn @xcite , herman and kluk @xcite .",
    "more general high frequency solutions that are not necessarily concentrated on a single ray can be described by superpositions of gaussian beams .",
    "this idea was first introduced by babi and pankratova in @xcite and was later proposed as a method for approximating wave propagation by popov in @xcite . letting the beam parameters depend on their initial location @xmath20 , such that @xmath21 , @xmath22 etc .",
    ", and @xmath23 , @xmath24 , the approximate solution for an initial value problem can be expressed with the superposition integral @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a compact subset of @xmath27 .",
    "it should be mentioned that there are other related gaussian beam like approximations . in the _ thawed _",
    "gaussian approximation @xcite the phase @xmath12 is always a second order polynomial .",
    "higher order is obtained by instead taking a higher order polynomial in the amplitude , to correct also for errors in the phase . _",
    "frozen _ gaussian approximations @xcite also use a second order polynomial for the phase @xmath12 , but with a fixed size of the second derivative ( @xmath18=constant ) .",
    "single frozen gaussians are therefore _ not _ asymptotic solutions to the wave equation .",
    "however , superpositions of frozen gaussians are and they can be thought of as an efficient linear basis for the wave equation .",
    "numerical methods based on gaussian beam superpositions go back to the 1980 s with work by popov , @xcite , cerveny @xcite and klime @xcite for high frequency waves and e.g. heller , herman , kluk @xcite in quantum chemistry . in the past decade",
    "there was a renewed interest in such methods for waves following their successful use in seismic imaging and oil exploration by hill @xcite .",
    "development of new beam based methods are now the subject of intense interest in the numerical analysis community and the methods are being applied in a host of applications , from the original geophysical applications to gravity waves @xcite , the semiclassical schrdinger equation @xcite , and acoustic waves @xcite .",
    "see also the survey of gaussian beam methods in @xcite .",
    "individual beams are normally computed in a lagrangian fashion by solving odes along the central rays .",
    "the superposition is then replaced by a discrete summation of beams .",
    "there are also more recent numerical techniques based on eulerian formulations of the problem @xcite . in these methods a pde is derived for the parameters in the beams , i.e. the quantities in the odes .",
    "this is coupled with a level - set pde for the ray dynamics . with the eulerian formulation",
    "the result is no longer a superposition of asymptotic solutions to the wave equation ! for superpositions over subdomains moving with the hamiltonian flow , it was shown directly in @xcite that they are asymptotic solutions without reference to standard gaussian beams .",
    "numerical approaches for treating general high frequency initial data for superposition over physical space were considered in @xcite for the wave equation .    in this paper",
    "we study the accuracy in terms of @xmath0 of gaussian beams and superpositions of gaussian beams for the helmholtz equation ( [ ho ] ) . this would give a rigorous foundation for beam based numerical methods used to solve the helmholtz equation in the high frequency regime .",
    "in the time - dependent case several such error estimates have been derived in recent years : for the initial data @xcite , for scalar hyperbolic equations and the schrdinger equation @xcite , for frozen gaussians @xcite and for the acoustic wave equation with superpositions in phase space @xcite .",
    "the general result is that the error between the exact solution and the gaussian beam approximation decays as @xmath2 for @xmath3-th order beams in the appropriate sobolev norm .",
    "there are , however , no rigorous error estimates of this type available for the helmholtz equation .",
    "what is known is how well the beams asymptotically satisfy the equation , i.e. the size of @xmath28 for a single beam .",
    "let us also mention an estimate of the taylor expansion error away from caustics , @xcite .",
    "the analysis of gaussian beam superpositions for helmholtz presents a few new challenges compared to the time - dependent case .",
    "first , it must be clarified precisely how beams are generated by the source function and how the gaussian beam approximation is extended to infinity .",
    "this is done in  2 and  3 for a compactly supported source function that concentrates on a co - dimension one manifold .",
    "second , additional assumptions on the index of refraction @xmath6 are needed to get a well - posed problem with @xmath0-independent solution estimates and a well - behaved gaussian beam approximation at infinity .",
    "the conditions we use are that @xmath6 is non - trapping and that there is an @xmath29 for which @xmath6 is constant when @xmath9 .    in  4 we consider the difference between the gaussian beam approximation and the exact solution to the radiation problem with the corresponding source function .",
    "here we are interested in behavior of the local @xmath1 norm @xmath30 as @xmath31 .",
    "this depends on the well - posedness of the radiation problem .",
    "there are a variety of estimates that apply here @xcite , but the laplace - transform based estimates of vainberg @xcite suffice for our purposes . in  5 we compare the gaussian beam approximation with the result of stationary phase expansion of the exact solution in a simple example .",
    "sections  6 and  7 are devoted to superpositions of beams with fundamental source terms .",
    "our main result is theorem  [ ee ] where we are able to show that the error between superposition of @xmath3-th order beams and the exact outgoing solution decays as @xmath2 independent of dimension and presence of caustics .",
    "this is consistent with the optimal results of @xcite in the time - dependent setting . finally , ",
    "7 gives an example of how beams can be constructed for more general source functions .",
    "in this section we construct the gaussian beam solutions for ( [ ho ] ) when @xmath32 is compactly supported on a co - dimension one manifold .",
    "this construction has become standard ( see , for example , @xcite or @xcite ) and we review some details here which will be used later .",
    "the form of the beam solutions is @xmath33 each beam concentrates on a geometrical optics ray @xmath34 , which is the spatial part of the bicharacteristics @xmath35 defined by the flow for the hamiltonian @xmath36 @xmath37 we assume that there is a number @xmath38 such that the ( smooth ) index of refraction satisfies @xmath39 when @xmath9 and that the source function @xmath32 is compactly supported in @xmath40 . here",
    "we also restrict the construction of the gaussian beam solution to the larger region @xmath41 .",
    "the essential additional hypothesis for our construction is that the index of refraction does not lead to trapped rays .",
    "the precise non - trapping condition is that there is an @xmath42 such that @xmath43 for all solutions with @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "note that this implies that @xmath46 for @xmath47 since rays are straight lines when @xmath39 .",
    "applying @xmath48 in ( [ ho ] ) to ( [ wkb ] ) we have @xmath49 where @xmath50 odes for @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 arise from requiring that @xmath54 vanishes to third order on the ray @xmath55 , and that @xmath56 vanishes to first order on the ray .",
    "it leads to the equations @xmath57 this amounts to constructing a  first order \" beam .",
    "higher order beams can be constructed by requiring @xmath54 vanishes to higher order on @xmath58 .",
    "then one can require that the @xmath59 s with @xmath60 also vanish to higher order , and obtain a recursive set of linear equations for the partial derivatives of @xmath61 .",
    "more precisely , for an @xmath3-th order beam @xmath62 in ( [ wkb ] ) and @xmath63 should vanish to order @xmath64 when @xmath65 .    for initial data ,",
    "we let @xmath66 and choose @xmath67 so that @xmath68 then for all @xmath69 the matrix @xmath70 inherits the properties of @xmath67 : @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 is positive definite on the orthogonal complement of @xmath74 , see @xcite . for the amplitude",
    "we take @xmath75 .",
    "we can solve the ode for @xmath76 explicitly , and obtain @xmath77    the phase @xmath12 in ( [ wkb ] ) can be any function satisfying @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "however , to write down such a function we need to have @xmath69 as a function of @xmath81 .",
    "since we have @xmath82 , @xmath55 traces a smooth curve @xmath58 in @xmath83 , and the non - trapping hypothesis implies that this curve is a straight line when @xmath84 .",
    "we let @xmath85 be the tubular neighborhood of @xmath58 with radius @xmath86 in the ball @xmath87 . by choosing @xmath86 small enough",
    ", we can uniquely define @xmath88 for all @xmath89 such that @xmath55 is the closest point on @xmath58 to @xmath81 , provided @xmath58 has no self - intersections .",
    "we then define the phase function @xmath12 and amplitude @xmath90 on @xmath91 for first order beams by @xmath92 with @xmath88 .",
    "note that @xmath93 is constant on planes orthogonal to @xmath58 intersected with @xmath94 .",
    "since @xmath58 can have only finitely many self - intersections , we can cut @xmath58 into segments without self - intersections , and define @xmath93 on a tubular neighborhood each segment , ignoring the endpoints .",
    "for this reason self - intersections will not create difficulties , and without loss of generality we will assume that @xmath58 has no self - intersections in what follows .",

    "<S> the main result is that the relative local @xmath1 error in the beam approximations decay as @xmath2 independent of dimension and presence of caustics , for @xmath3-th order beams .     </S>",
