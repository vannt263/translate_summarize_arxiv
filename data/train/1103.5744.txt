    "we present the first comprehensive look at what orbital eccentricity measurements reveal about the nature of very low - mass stars and brown dwarfs .",

    "some binaries have multiple orbit determinations in the literature , and in these cases we used our published results in the following analysis . in most cases published",
    "orbits are in good agreement with each other , but a few binaries warrant special mention . in the case of lp  415 - 20ab , our astrometry results in a very different orbit than found by @xcite . as a test",
    ", we fitted their three keck epochs with the published gemini epoch from @xcite and found an orbit consistent with the one they reported ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "however , after including our four keck epochs we found that the 2007 december astrometry of @xcite is highly discrepant with the ensemble of measurements , resulting in a @xmath13 of 21.5 for 9 degrees of freedom ( dof ) .",
    "if we exclude this one measurement , we find good agreement between the data sets , and the best - fit orbit has a reasonable @xmath13 ( 6.83 for 7 dof ) and significantly different orbital parameters ( e.g. , our newly derived eccentricity of @xmath14 is 1.9@xmath15 discrepant with their @xmath16 ) .",
    "it appears that with only four epochs ( i.e. , 1 dof ) the orbit fit of @xcite was vulnerable to a single discrepant astrometric measurement leading to an incorrect orbit solution .",
    "we also note that our published orbit for 2mass  j2206@xmath172047ab @xcite is nominally inconsistent with that published by @xcite , with all orbital parameters discrepant by @xmath1124@xmath15 . using only their data ,",
    "we have found a lower @xmath13 orbit solution than they report , and although it is more consistent with our published orbit , it still has an unrealistically large @xmath13 ( 30.3 for 9 dof ) .",

    "the period and semimajor axis are smaller by 1.8@xmath15 , while the eccentricity and mass are consistent within 1@xmath15 .",
    "we use the more recent orbit from @xcite in the following analysis .",
    "we have constructed a sample of very low - mass ( @xmath19  ) binary orbits , including both visual and spectroscopic binaries . because it is imperative for our purposes that this sample be as unbiased as possible with respect to eccentricity ,",
    "in the following analysis we consider potential sources of selection bias , the nature of which varies between different types of binaries .",
    "below we describe how we have selected our orbit sample as well as the tests we have performed to quantify the level of eccentricity bias present in this sample .      in table",
    "[ tbl : vb ] , we present a list of all 20 visual binaries that have published orbit determinations and a total system mass @xmath20  . for each binary",
    "we list its distance , semimajor axis ( @xmath21 ) , and eccentricity ( @xmath5 ) , as these are the physical parameters that , along with three viewing angle parameters , determine the size and shape of a binary s orbit on the sky .",
    "thus , these are the three key parameters that must be considered when characterizing selection biases . in most cases",
    "we have used orbit parameters as published and distances determined from trigonometric parallax measurements . when parallax measurements were not available , we estimated distances based on the primary components resolved photometry and spectral types using the updated spectral type ",
    "absolute magnitude relations described in appendix  b of @xcite .    for all orbits published by other authors ,",
    "we have created our own markov chains using the published astrometry and the same analysis method described in section  [ sec : orbits ] . however , only in the cases where the astrometric orbit fits yield a reasonable @xmath13 can we trust the mcmc analysis to provide accurate posterior distributions of the orbital parameters . in cases where @xmath13 is unreasonably large ,",
    "the parameter space is not fully explored and uncertainties can be significantly underestimated by the mcmc method ( or in fact by any fitting method ) .",
    "we find such large @xmath13 values ( reduced @xmath22120 ) for five of the orbits published by @xcite . for three of these orbits they combined astrometry with radial velocities ( 2mass  j1847@xmath235522ab , 2mass  j1750@xmath234424ab , 2mass  j1426@xmath231557ab ) , which may have enabled them to achieve orbit fits with smaller @xmath13 than we found using the astrometry alone .",
    "for the other two orbits ( 2mass  j0850@xmath231057ab and 2mass  j1728@xmath233948ab ) , it is unclear why we are unable to reproduce their lower @xmath13 values from the same input data ( astrometry alone ) .",
    "for all five of these orbits we use the parameters derived by @xcite .",
    "( note that for reasons unrelated these discrepancies , none of these five binaries ultimately passes the selection criteria that we define below for our unbiased eccentricity sample . )      with a complete set of the known very low - mass visual binary orbits in hand , we now consider how selection biases may affect the eccentricity distribution of this sample .",
    "visual binaries must pass three independent selection criteria before having their orbits determined : ( 1 ) they must be initially resolved by a high - resolution imaging survey ;",
    "( 2 ) they must be included in subsequent astrometric monitoring programs ; and ( 3 ) their observed relative motion must yield a unique orbit fit .",
    "the first selection cut can result in biases on orbital parameters , as has been shown for direct imaging searches for extrasolar planets ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "the second cut results from the fact that it is impractical to monitor the orbits of all @xmath11100 known very low - mass binaries .",
    "rather , astrometric monitoring programs are inevitably optimized for measuring as many orbits as possible with limited observing resources over a limited amount of time by focusing on the binaries likely to have the shortest orbital periods .",
    "thus , the selection criteria used to define the monitoring sample can result in strong biases on the orbit parameters . because the orbital period must be estimated from the projected separation of the binary , binaries with wide separations are much less desirable to monitor .",
    "this introduces an eccentricity bias because more eccentric binaries at a given period and mass will , on average , have wider projected separations .",
    "we will therefore attempt to define a subset of visual binaries that has minimal eccentricity bias due to these selection criteria .",
    "* @xmath24 discovery bias .",
    "* we first consider the effect of `` discovery bias '' which causes the population of binaries resolved by imaging surveys to deviate from the true underlying eccentricity distribution of all binaries .",
    "for a given imaging surveys , the extent of this bias depends on how the semimajor axis ( @xmath21 ) distribution compares to that survey s resolution limit , or inner working angle ( iwa ) .",
    "for example , if the @xmath21 distribution peaks inside the iwa , the discovery of higher eccentricity binaries is favored , as such binaries spend more time at wider separations compared to more circular orbits . to quantify this bias , we have performed a simple monte carlo simulation in which @xmath21 was held fixed , while eccentricity was distributed uniformly from 0 to 1 , viewing angles were drawn from appropriate random distributions ( @xmath25 ; uniform in @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) , and the single - epoch observations were distributed uniformly in orbital phase .",
    "binaries were considered detected if their projected separation at the time of observation was above the resolution limit .",
    "the impact on the uniform input eccentricity distribution is illustrated in figure  [ fig : bias ] .",
    "when the resolution limit falls at or outside the fixed semimajor axis ( iwa  @xmath28 ) , high-@xmath5 orbits are strongly preferred as they spend the most time wider than the resolution limit .",
    "when the resolution limit falls inside the fixed value of @xmath21 ( iwa  @xmath29 ) both highly eccentric and circular orbits are preferred , with intermediate eccentricities being selected against .",
    "this is because in these cases any sufficiently eccentric orbit can be made unresolvable by an unfavorable viewing angle , but this can be compensated by the fact that the most eccentric orbits spend extended periods of time at very wide separations .",
    "thus , high-@xmath5 orbits are more likely to be detected than intermediate-@xmath5 orbits , as they spend the most time widely separated .",
    "to predict the exact form of the eccentricity discovery bias for our sample would require an assumption for the underlying semimajor axis distribution as well as careful accounting of the resolution limits of the numerous imaging surveys that have contributed to the current sample of very low - mass binaries .",
    "however , for our purposes we simply want to ensure that our sample of orbits has an acceptably small amount of bias .",
    "thus , we need only chose a cutoff in the ratio of iwa/@xmath21 that is small enough to minimize the bias while including as many binaries with orbit determinations as possible . in table",
    "[ tbl : vb ] , we give our estimate for the iwa of the imaging data used to discover each visual binary as well as the ratio iwa/@xmath21 . we have chosen a cutoff of iwa/@xmath30 , which figure  [ fig : bias ] shows produces a relatively unbiased selection over a full range of eccentricities from 0 to 1 .",
    "this cutoff excludes three binaries : lp  415 - 20ab ( iwa/@xmath31 ) , 2mass  j0920@xmath233517ab ( iwa/@xmath32 ) , and 2mass  j2140@xmath231625ab ( iwa/@xmath33 ) .",
    "the highest remaining iwa/@xmath21 value in our sample is 0.68 for lp  349 - 25ab .",
    "while it is unfortunate to have to exclude any orbits from our sample , we emphasize that this is a very important step in keeping potentially large biases from impacting the following analysis .",
    "the case of lp  415 - 20ab is a prime example of the problem with discovery bias on eccentricity .",
    "this binary was discovered at a projected separation of @xmath34  mas , right at the resolution limit of the imaging survey of @xcite .",
    "its actual semimajor axis turns out to be @xmath35  mas , so it could have only been discovered by that survey if it had an eccentric orbit , as it indeed does ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "thus , while lp  415 - 20ab does tell us that very low - mass binaries can be quite eccentric , it can not convey any other information about the eccentricity distribution since the only reason it was discovered is because of its large eccentricity .",
    "* @xmath24 monitoring sample bias .",
    "* next , we consider how to prevent the sample selection of orbital monitoring programs from biasing the resulting eccentricity distribution .",
    "this is essentially a matter of choosing a range of semimajor axes for which the monitoring sample is complete at all eccentricities .",
    "the lower limit in @xmath21 is simply defined by the visual binary orbit with the smallest semimajor axis ; this is gl  569bab with @xmath37  au @xcite .",
    "there are also no known visual binaries with projected separations ( @xmath38 ) at discovery smaller than 0.9  au , so we define this as the lower limit of our sample .",
    "the upper limit should be chosen to accurately reflect the completeness of orbit monitoring surveys that tend to focus on the smallest separation binaries , while also including as many of the resulting orbit measurements as possible .",
    "for the many binaries without orbit determinations , we must use their minimum possible semimajor axis , which would be the case of a highly eccentric , face - on orbit caught at apoastron ( physical separation of @xmath39 ) . since bound orbits have @xmath40 , the minimum possible semimajor axis for any binary is therefore half its projected separation ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "thus , some binaries that seem to be very wide ( i.e. , poor monitoring targets ) could in fact have much smaller semimajor axes but just be very eccentric .",
    "when choosing an upper limit in @xmath21 , we must therefore ensure that orbit monitoring programs are complete up to projected separations of @xmath42 , otherwise we would introduce a strong selection bias against high eccentricities .",
    "we choose an upper limit in @xmath21 of 3.7  au in order to include the binaries lhs  1070bc ( @xmath43  au ; ) and lhs  1901ab ( @xmath44  au ; @xcite ) .",
    "the next widest binary that would also pass our iwa/@xmath21 cut is 2mass  0850@xmath231057ab ( @xmath45  au , @xmath46 ) . our chosen 3.7  au upper limit means that binaries up to projected separations of 7.4  au should not have been intentionally excluded from orbit monitoring programs . to the best of our knowledge",
    "this is the case , as at least a second epoch has been obtained for all binaries with @xmath47  au , either by our own keck program or others .",
    "a slightly larger upper limit of 4.0  au would require several more binaries to have undergone orbit monitoring that have not , while adding no additional binaries with orbit determinations to our sample .",
    "* @xmath24 monte carlo simulations . * with these selection criteria of @xmath48  au , @xmath47  au , and iwa@xmath49 in hand , we have performed monte carlo simulations to assess the level of eccentricity bias that is expected for our sample . for this range of semimajor axes , the very low - mass binary parameter distributions derived by @xcite are appropriate .",
    "the semimajor axis distribution is lognormal , with a peak at @xmath50 and @xmath51 . to convert @xmath21 from au to arcseconds",
    ", we randomly drew distances in a monte carlo fashion incorporating the selection effects of the seeing - limited surveys that originally discovered the binaries as unresolved sources .",
    "we began with objects distributed uniformly in volume .",
    "we assigned magnitudes to these objects according to the empirical -band luminosity function of @xcite which is valid from @xmath52  mag ( i.e. , @xmath11m8 to l8 , encompassing the spectral type range of the bulk of our sample ) .",
    "we further added flux due to unresolved companions according to the @xcite binary frequency of 20% and mass ratio distribution of @xmath53 ; we converted mass ratio to flux ratio using the @xmath54 theoretical power - law relation of @xcite .",
    "the final distance distribution was then determined by magnitude cuts on this simulated population .",
    "we tested both strong ( @xmath55  mag ) and weak ( @xmath56  mag ) magnitude cuts equivalent to those used by @xcite and @xcite in mining 2mass for late - m dwarfs and l dwarfs , respectively . in the latter case , we applied an additional @xmath57  mag cut to approximate the @xmath58  mag color cut of @xcite that excluded brighter , bluer m dwarfs ; we based this cut on the color ",
    "absolute magnitude diagrams of @xcite .",
    "the strong magnitude cut for the brighter late - m sample resulted in a distance distribution peaking at @xmath1120  pc , while the weaker cut for the fainter l dwarf sample resulted in similarly shaped distribution peaked at @xmath1140  pc .",
    "we then randomly generated an observed projected separation ( @xmath38 ) for each binary in a similar manner as described earlier ( i.e. , random viewing angles and observing times , and a uniform eccentricity distribution ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : bias ] shows the resulting eccentricity distribution after applying the selection criteria of @xmath48  au , iwa@xmath49 , @xmath59  au , and @xmath60 ( i.e. , the binary was resolved ) . for both samples we conservatively assumed the worst - case iwa from the surveys that originally discovered the binaries in our sample . for",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . by assuming the worst - case iwa we find the largest possible amplitude of the eccentricity bias , since smaller values of the iwa will always yield less bias ( i.e.",
    ", more binaries will always be uncovered for a smaller iwa ) .",
    "the resulting maximal bias we find from our monte carlo simulations has an amplitude of less than @xmath62 for both the late - m and l samples .",
    "as expected , the level of eccentricity bias introduced by our selection criteria is negligible , since they were chosen to minimize the eccentricity bias , and as shown in figure  [ fig : bias ] there is no strong systematic trend in the bias .",
    "nearly circular ( @xmath63 ) and highly eccentric orbits ( @xmath64 ) are slightly preferred ( by @xmath114% ) as compared to intermediate eccentricities .",
    "we neglect this bias in the following analysis",
    ".    * @xmath24 orbit fitting bias . *",
    "finally , we consider one additional selection effect present in our sample : each binary must have undergone astrometric motion suitable for yielding a robust orbit determination .",
    "this can potentially introduce an eccentricity bias if orbit fits are more easily determined for certain ranges of eccentricity .",
    "for example , it is easy to imagine that an extremely eccentric binary would present a challenge to astrometric monitoring as it spends most of its time at a fixed projected separation before moving rapidly inward in nearly a straight line",
    ". such an orbit would be difficult to observe at just the right times needed for a good fit and would also appear to be less appealing for continued monitoring .",
    "@xcite investigated this bias by generating @xmath65 random orbits and classifying the expected quality of the orbit fit by eye , relying on their extensive experience working with such astrometric data .",
    "such an ad hoc method is necessary because in the marginal cases of visual binary orbit fitting the process of @xmath13 minimization is highly nonlinear and strongly dependent on the initial guess .",
    "@xcite found that on average orbits with @xmath66 all had the same likelihood of yielding a good fit , so they assigned this eccentricity range a normalized completeness factor of 100% .",
    "they found that this completeness drops to 77% for eccentricities of 0.60.8 and 42% for @xmath67 . in our sample",
    ", we have one visual binary with @xmath64 and none in the 0.60.8 range . in the following analysis",
    "we consider the impact of applying correction factors of 1.3@xmath68 and 2.4@xmath68 due to this orbit fitting bias .    *",
    "@xmath24 final visual binary sample . * in table  [ tbl : ecc ] , we list the orbital periods , eccentricities , and masses of the eleven visual binary orbits from table  [ tbl : vb ] that meet our eccentricity bias - minimizing criteria of having @xmath48  au and a discovery iwa@xmath49 .",
    "( note that we list orbital period here rather than semimajor axis in order to compare these orbits directly to the unresolved spectroscopic binary orbits . )",
    "although this nominally includes only a little over half of the 20 published visual binary orbit determinations , in fact the majority of the remaining orbits would not contribute much information as they are not as well constrained ( see the orbit quality metrics given in table  [ tbl : vb ] ) .",
    "for example , all orbits in our bias - minimized sample happen to have 1@xmath15 eccentricity confidence limits of @xmath69 ( median 0.005 ) . however , of the nine orbits not included in the sample , six of them have much more poorly constrained orbits ( 1@xmath15 confidence limits of 0.10.5 ) , with a median error of 0.26 that is @xmath70 larger than the median for the other orbits .",
    "in fact , the reason why these six orbits are poorly determined is the same as why they were excluded by our bias minimizing criteria : they are all the widest ( i.e. , longest period ) binaries , and this results in them having orbit monitoring observations that cover much less orbital phase ( as little as 0.2% and 1.3% of the orbit is covered in the two most extreme cases ) .      to date ,",
    "five unresolved very low - mass binaries have published orbit determinations .",
    "two of these were discovered via radial velocity ( rv ) monitoring as single - lined spectroscopic binaries ( sb1s ) : cha  h@xmath71  8 ( @xmath72 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and 2mass  j0320@xmath170446 ( @xmath73 ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite have examined the selection bias introduced by rv surveys on the eccentricity distribution through monte carlo simulations .",
    "they found that as long as the rv semiamplitude ( @xmath74 ) of an sb1 is @xmath753@xmath68 larger than the rms of the residuals ( @xmath15 ) , its eccentricity does not greatly impact its likelihood of discovery .",
    "as shown in their figure  4 , sb1s have a constant detection efficiency up to @xmath76 , beyond which there is a slight downturn .",
    "however , even at the highest eccentricities ( @xmath77 ) the detection efficiency is only @xmath1120% less than for @xmath78 orbits .",
    "the reason for this lack of a strong eccentricity bias in rv data is because eccentricity acts to boost the rv semiamplitude ( @xmath79 ) , counteracting the fact that eccentric orbits are more difficult to adequately sample with times series data .",
    "the two sb1s in our sample , cha  h@xmath71  8 and 2mass  j0320@xmath170446 , have large semiamplitudes relative to their rms ( @xmath80 and 21 , respectively ) , and thus are expected to harbor little bias ( @xmath81 ) with respect to eccentricity according to the analysis of @xcite . for this reason and the small size of the sample ( 2 systems ) we neglect the eccentricity bias for sb1s .",
    "one double - lined spectroscopic binary ( sb2 ) has a measured orbit : ppl  15 ( @xmath82 * ? ? ?",
    "it was discovered as an sb2 in three epochs of rv data .",
    "the identification of sb2s in spectroscopic data is subject to different eccentricity selection effects than for sb1s because changes in the velocity do not need to be measured to detect the two sets of absorption lines due to the binary . to quantify the eccentricity bias in detecting sb2s , we performed a monte carlo simulation similar to the one described above for visual binaries but with the detection criterion that the velocity shift between the binary components must be large enough to detect in high - resolution spectra at one of three random epochs .",
    "we fixed the period and semimajor axis to that of ppl  15 ( 5.8  days , 0.03  au ) .",

    "we find only a slight ( @xmath113% ) preference for the discovery of highly eccentric ( @xmath67 ) sb2s in such rv data . for comparison",
    ", we also show the results if the detection threshold were higher or lower by a factor of two , as would be the case for binaries with rv semiamplitudes different by a factor of two .",
    "higher semiamplitude binaries are less biased , while for lower semiamplitudes the eccentricity bias becomes a larger effect ( though still @xmath85 ) .",
    "thus , it seems reasonable to neglect eccentricity bias for ppl  15 , the one sb2 in our orbit sample .",

    "astrometric time series data is very similar to rv time series data and so would be subject to the same biases as for sb1s .",

    "both of these binaries were excluded from our sample by our criteria for minimizing eccentricity bias , and we also note that with only 2.2% and 0.4% observational phase coverage these orbit determinations and their uncertainties are not likely to be robust ( e.g. , see the cautionary example of df  tau  ab in @xcite ) .",

    "the same trend has also been reported for pre ",
    "main - sequence , solar - type binaries , implying that this period  eccentricity correlation is determined early in a binary s formation history .",
    "we confirm the significance of the correlation in the sample by computing spearman s rank correlation coefficient for solar - type binaries ( excluding those that lie below the critical period for tidal circularization ; @xmath116  days ) .",

    "as discussed above , our sample shows no such correlation , which is an indication that the solar and very low - mass populations are in fact dynamically distinct from one another .",
    "we also note that among the large sample of solar - type binaries from there is not a single orbit with @xmath3 beyond an orbital period of 22  days ,  days and @xmath3 are indeed known to exist , but none are included in the well - defined , volume - limited sample of .",

    "the @xmath96-value remains significant ( @xmath121 ) for any choice of the eccentricity division point ranging from 0.10 to 0.15 .",
    "this strong preference for near - circular orbits among very low - mass binaries provides additional evidence that their dynamical history may be different from solar - type binaries .",
    "we next consider the location in the @xmath96@xmath5 diagram of very low - mass binaries that are members of hierarchical triple systems as compared to their solar - type counterparts .",
    "the interpretation given by and @xcite is that solar - type binaries that are members of hierarchical triple or quadruple systems tend to lie near the upper envelope of eccentricity at a given orbital period .",
    "however , examination of the @xmath96@xmath5 diagram of solar - type binaries presented in figure  14 of @xcite shows that such members of hierarchical systems actually occupy a wide range of eccentricities at periods @xmath122  days .",
    "in fact , members of hierarchical triple and quadruple systems are the only near - circular ( @xmath123 ) solar - type binaries at these periods , suggesting that their higher order nature may be the cause of their unusually low eccentricities .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the only such long - period , near - circular binary in the pre  main - sequence sample of is now known to have a tertiary companion ( gw  ori ; * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast to solar - type binaries , the higher order multiples in our sample do not populate the upper eccentricity envelope at any period .",
    "in fact , the highest eccentricity orbit in our sample is a true binary , and the lowest eccentricity orbit belongs to a member of a triple system .",
    "this latter datum may be partially consistent with the fact that near - circular ( @xmath3 ) solar - type binaries tend to be members of higher order multiples .",
    "however , there remains the mystery as to why such near - circular orbits are much more common among the true binaries in our sample than in the solar - type binary sample .",
    "finally , we note that the shortest period binaries in our sample are not circularized , despite having shorter periods than the empirical limit from field solar - type binaries ( @xmath124  days ) .",
    "this was discussed by @xcite , who used brown dwarf structural models along with the circularization theory of to show that ppl  15 ( @xmath125  days ) is not expected to ever tidally circularize as its critical period is @xmath1264.5  days . by extension , the orbit of the eclipsing binary 2mass  j0535@xmath170546 ( @xmath127  days ) , which has even lower masses and thus a shorter critical period ,",
    "is also predicted to never circularize , so its nonzero eccentricity is not merely a symptom of its youth ( @xmath1261  myr ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite showed that if binary companions are distributed in phase space solely as a function of energy , whether according to the boltzmann distribution or any other arbitrary function , the cumulative distribution of eccentricities must be proportional to @xmath4 and the mean value of @xmath5 should be equal to @xmath128 .",
    "he argued that the observational data for wide stellar binaries at the time was in strong disagreement with this prediction , implying that binaries neither originate from nor relax via dynamical interactions into a state of statistical equilibrium .",
    "tested the @xcite distribution with modern data for solar - type binaries , applying a correction due to eccentricity bias from @xcite , and claimed that the @xmath4 distribution described the wider binaries ( @xmath129  days ) reasonably well .",
    "however , their data still possess a severe lack of high - eccentricity binaries , especially after excluding the three binaries with @xmath1301000-yr orbits , as these happen to include two of the most eccentric orbits in their sample ( @xmath131 ) .",
    "our sample seems to also contravene the @xmath4 distribution , as high-@xmath5 binaries are notably scarce . to quantify this",
    ", we performed ks tests as described in section  [ sec : solar ] . following the discussion in section  [ sec : vb ] , we corrected for visual binary orbit bias by adding simulated data points uniformly distributed in each of the last two bins ( @xmath5 = 0.60.8 and 0.81.0 ) .",
    "these bins contain 0 and 1 visual binary , respectively , and after accounting for the bias the number in each bin was 0 and 2.4 binaries , averaged over @xmath132 trials .",
    "the resulting probability that the null hypothesis is correct ( i.e. , the observed sample is drawn from the predicted @xmath4 distribution ) was @xmath133 for the entire sample and @xmath134 when considering only the visual binaries in our sample .",
    "because of the potential impact of our assumed bias correction on the results , we also performed ks tests considering only eccentricities below 0.6 , for which there is expected to be negligible observational bias .",
    "these tests gave probabilities of @xmath135 and @xmath136 for the full sample and visual binaries , respectively .",
    "thus , we conclude that our sample of very low - mass binaries does not follow an @xcite distribution over orbital periods of 5.8 to @xmath137  days .",
    "we have also compared our sample to the predictions of numerical simulations that strive to describe the formation of such low - mass binaries .",
    "@xcite simulated the collapse of a 500  molecular cloud , producing sufficiently large numbers of stars and brown dwarfs ( @xmath115 ) to do statistical comparisons with observations .",
    "@xcite reported the parameters of sixteen binaries with total masses of @xmath20  that were generated in this simulation , and we plot their orbital periods and eccentricities in figure  [ fig : compare ] .",
    "our observed eccentricity distribution agrees very well with the simulation of @xcite , with a 83% probability of both samples being drawn from the same parent distribution according to a ks test ( 92% for visual binaries alone ) , and this result is not changed if we consider only those simulated binaries within our sample s semimajor axis upper limit of 3.7  au . however , we note that @xcite does not produce any high-@xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) binaries over the same orbital period range as we observe , as all of his high-@xmath5 binaries have very long orbital periods ( @xmath138  days )",
    ". this could be due to the small number statistics of the simulation results , but if not then it is suggestive of a disagreement with the observations that is only made stronger by the fact that the orbit bias correction implies a total of @xmath113 binaries with @xmath139 for our sample",
    ". this discrepancy could be due to the fact that at the end of the simulation the @xcite binaries are still evolving toward shorter orbital periods by dynamical interactions with other protostars and their own accretion disks .",
    "thus , the high-@xmath5 systems could ultimately reach the orbital periods of our sample .",
    "however , their eccentricities would also likely damp down in the process , and thus the discrepancy with observations would remain .",
    "another significant concern is that the very low - mass stars and brown dwarfs in the simulation of @xcite are formed largely by being ejected from their initial gas reservoirs through dynamical interactions .",
    "@xcite showed that by including a more realistic equation of state and radiative feedback , such ejection events become much less common , which resolves the problem that previous simulations ( including @xcite ) produced far too many brown dwarfs .",
    "it remains to be seen how this improvement in the input physics will impact the orbital elements of binaries produced in these simulations .    in recent simulations by @xcite ,",
    "very low - mass stars , brown dwarfs , and planetary - mass objects are formed via gravitational instability in the outer parts ( @xmath140  au ) of massive circumstellar disks ( @xmath141 ) .",
    "the orbital periods and eccentricities of the twelve binaries with @xmath19 that were generated in these simulations are shown in figure  [ fig : compare ] .",
    "these binaries are a mix of three field binaries ( those that are ejected from the disk ) , and nine binaries that remain bound to the star in a hierarchical triple .",
    "the eccentricities of these two subsets are not statistically different from each other as shown by a ks test ( @xmath142 , 38% chance of being drawn from the same parent distribution ) , and so we simply compare the full set of simulated binaries to our sample .",
    "the simulated binaries have significantly higher eccentricities than we observe , with our ks test giving a probability of only @xmath143 that the two samples were drawn from the same parent distribution .",
    "this result is not changed significantly if we only consider simulated binaries within our sample s semimajor axis upper limit of 3.7  au . as discussed by @xcite ,",
    "the binary components formed in these simulations have their own disks , and after the initial 20  kyr their simulations ignore the gas in order to follow the long term evolution of the system .",
    "the tidal interactions associated with these disks that are not accounted for in the simulations at late times could damp the eccentricities of the simulated binaries .",
    "indeed , @xcite found that including such dissipative interactions was critical in reproducing the stellar eccentricity distribution .",
    "thus , including such additional input physics may solve the disagreement between our observed eccentricities and the simulations of @xcite . on the other hand , such large eccentricities may simply be a hallmark of forming in the frenetic dynamical environment of a fragmenting circumstellar disk .",
    "we have considered for the first time the eccentricity distribution of a large sample of orbits for very low - mass star and brown dwarf binaries .",
    "we have examined potential observational biases in this sample , and for visual binaries we show through monte carlo simulations that by choosing appropriate selection criteria all eccentricities are equally represented ( @xmath2 difference between input and output eccentricity distributions ) .",
    "we find that our sample of very low - mass binaries populate a broad range in eccentricity from nearly circular to highly eccentric ( @xmath144 ) , showing a strong preference for modest eccentricities ( the mean and median of the full sample is @xmath145 ) .",
    "the binaries among our sample that are members of hierarchical triple systems show no special preference for their eccentricity as compared to the other binaries , consistent with a common formation mechanism for both populations .",
    "the overall eccentricity distribution of our sample is similar to solar - type binaries from .",
    "however , very low - mass binaries lack any correlation between eccentricity and period or semimajor axis , which is one of the key features of the solar - type population . in addition , near - circular orbits appear to be quite common among very low - mass binaries , as at least 3 of our 16 sample binaries have @xmath3",
    ". however , such orbits are apparently rare among solar - type binaries ( in the sample , none of the 42 binaries beyond an orbital period of 22  days have @xmath3 ) .",
    "this difference between the two samples is statistically significant according to fisher s exact test ( @xmath96-value of 0.0155 ) .",
    "thus , the orbital data currently available are suggestive of a different formation mechanism or dynamical history for very low - mass binaries as compared to solar - type stars .",
    "we have also tested formation models by comparing our sample of very low - mass binaries to those produced in numerical simulations .",
    "the cluster formation model of @xcite predicts an overall eccentricity distribution that is well - matched to the data .",
    "however , there is a potential discrepancy with the observations due to the lack of any eccentric binaries ( @xmath139 ) at orbital periods corresponding to our sample .",
    "this may be caused by the same physical mechanism that is needed to bring binaries formed in the simulation to these orbital periods , namely tidal damping by the accompanying gas disks .",
    "in contrast , the gravitational instability model of @xcite produces too many high-@xmath5 binaries , with an absence of _ any _ modest eccentricity ( @xmath146 ) orbits .",
    "this may be due to the fact that tidal dissipation by gas disks is not included in the @xcite simulation , causing the resulting eccentricity distribution to be inconsistent with our sample at high significance .",
    "a third possibility is that the observed discrepancies are simply due to multiple formation processes being responsible for producing the field population of very low - mass binaries , so no one model matches all the data .",
    "a further complication is that binaries formed in a cluster environment are likely to undergo additional dynamical processing after their initial eccentricities are set , and thus @xmath147-body simulations are needed to assess the impact of such effects on the final eccentricity distribution .    to improve on our observational tests , future efforts should aim to cover a wider range of orbital parameter space , particularly expanding the sample at short orbital periods ( @xmath148  days ) .",
    "the discovery of such tight binaries is only currently feasible from rv monitoring or the `` spectral binary '' technique ( i.e. , identifying the signature of a fainter companion of disparate spectral type in the integrated light spectrum ) .",
    "for example , @xcite used this technique to identify 2mass  j0320@xmath170446 as a binary independent of its identification as an sb1 @xcite .",
    "however , even for such spectral binaries the determination of orbits requires either precise rv measurements or resolved astrometry .",
    "this will require new capabilities ( precision near - infrared radial velocities for l and t dwarfs ) as well as new facilities ( e.g. , tmt / gmt / e - elt and _ jwst _  to resolve the much smaller semimajor axes ) .",
    "fortunately , future binaries that will fill in the bottom two orders of magnitude in orbital period will not require the same duration of patient orbital monitoring that has been necessary over the last decade to develop the current sample of @xmath126330-yr period visual orbits .",
    "we have taken the first look at what clues the ensemble of orbital eccentricities of very low - mass stars and brown dwarfs reveal about their formation .",
    "this work follows on previous statistical studies of the visual binary population that found distributions of mass ratio and semimajor axis that were significantly different than for solar - type binaries ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the theoretical implication that disks may be critical in shaping the eccentricity distribution is in accord with the fact that eccentricity is closely associated with a binary s angular momentum .",
    "this potential relationship is intriguing , as it suggests the possibility for disk - related observational tests .",
    "for example , if high - eccentricity binaries are simply those that lost their disks early in their formation , then perhaps the binary components rotate more rapidly than lower eccentricity binary components due to a lack of disk - braking .",
    "observational evidence has also shown that the formation environment may play an important role in determining the orbits of binaries , with dynamical interactions in the dense orion nebula cluster likely responsible for sculpting the semimajor axis distribution of stellar binaries @xcite while binaries in the sparser taurus region seem to be able to survive at much wider separations @xcite .",
    "further theoretical modeling of the binary formation process taking such effects into account will enable us to better understand the physical processes influencing observed orbital eccentricities .",

    "<S> the cluster formation model of @xcite agrees very well with the overall @xmath5 distribution , but the lack of any high-@xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) binaries at orbital periods comparable to our sample suggests that tidal damping due to gas disks may play too large of a role in the simulations . </S>",
