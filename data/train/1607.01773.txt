    "<S> high - order harmonic generation by a bicircular field , which consists of two coplanar counter - rotating circularly polarized fields of frequency @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 are integers ) , is investigated for a polyatomic molecule . </S>",
    "<S> this field possesses dynamical symmetry , which can be adapted to the symmetry of the molecular hamiltonian and used to investigate the molecular symmetry . for polyatomic molecules having the @xmath4 symmetry only the harmonics @xmath5 , @xmath6 , </S>",
    "<S> are emitted having the ellipticity @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate this using the example of the planar molecules bh@xmath8 and bf@xmath8 , which obey the @xmath9 symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we show that for the bf@xmath8 molecule , similarly to atoms with a @xmath10 ground state , there is a strong asymmetry in the emission of high harmonics with opposite helicities . </S>",
    "<S> this asymmetry depends on the molecular orientation .    </S>",
    "<S> = 1    strong - field physics and attoscience are presently a very active area of research since they enable one to study matter on the scale of the electronic dynamics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the electron liberated by a strong linearly polarized laser field can return to the parent ion and trigger various strong - field processes , which include elastic rescattering ( the process in which the final electron energy is much higher than in direct ionization is called high - order above - threshold ionization @xcite ) , the inelastic process in which in an ionizing collision one or more additional electrons are liberated @xcite , and the laser - assisted electron - ion recombination process where a high - energy photon is emitted [ this is the so - called high - order harmonic generation ( hhg ) @xcite ] . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of electrons driven by a linearly polarized laser field is one - dimensional and with it it is difficult to explore structure and dynamics of more complex targets such as molecules ( for reviews about molecular strong - field processes see @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> since symmetry is a fundamental concept of science and since it is the key for understanding the structure and dynamics of molecules , it is important to find field configurations that possess both particular symmetry properties and the possibility that the laser - field - driven liberated electron returns to the parent ion </S>",
    "<S> . such a field will be the main subject of the present study .    </S>",
    "<S> the concept of symmetry is particularly relevant for polyatomic molecules . due to the complexity of polyatomic molecules , research of molecular hhg </S>",
    "<S> has mainly been confined to simple diatomic and triatomic linear molecules . </S>",
    "<S> a list of recent papers in which polyatomic molecules were studied includes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ab initio hhg calculations for polyatomic molecules are too demanding and thus far have not been possible in any detail . </S>",
    "<S> we have recently developed a strong - field - approximation theory of hhg by polyatomic molecules @xcite and illustrated it by the examples of the ozone and the carbon dioxide molecules exposed to a linearly polarized laser field . in the present work </S>",
    "<S> we apply this theory to more complex molecules and more complex laser fields . </S>",
    "<S> our goal is to relate the respective molecular symmetry to the symmetry of the laser field and to explore the influence of these symmetries on the hhg spectra . </S>",
    "<S> we neglect the vibrational dynamics during the hhg process since it has recently been shown that for a broad range of molecules in strong ultrashort laser pulses it does not play an important role @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a special field combination , called the bicircular field , has recently attracted a lot of attention . </S>",
    "<S> a bicircular field consists of two coplanar counterrotating circularly polarized fields with frequencies @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which are integer multiples of the fundamental frequency @xmath11 . in our notation </S>",
    "<S> this field is defined in the @xmath12 plane by @xcite @xmath13/\\sqrt{2},\\nonumber\\\\ e_y(t)&=&\\left[-e_1\\cos(r\\omega t)+e_2\\cos(s\\omega t)\\right]/\\sqrt{2}.\\label{fieldcomp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a possible phase offset of the first component is canceled by an appropriate choice of the initial time , while an offset the phase of the second component is canceled by a rotation of the field around the @xmath14 axis by the angle @xmath15 ( for @xmath16 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> hhg by such field has been shown experimentally to be very efficient as early as in 1995 @xcite and was investigated theoretically in subsequent years @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> crucial for the revival of interest in strong - field processes in bicircular fields was the experimental confirmation that the generated harmonics are circularly polarized @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this paper has triggered a series of papers about hhg by atoms exposed to bicircular fields @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> other atomic processes in strong bicircular fields were also investigated , such as strong - field ionization @xcite , laser - assisted recombination @xcite , nonsequential double ionization @xcite , the possibility of introducing spin into attoscience @xcite , etc . </S>",
    "<S> molecular hhg using a bicircular field was studied in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the electric field vector of the @xmath0@xmath1 bicircular field is invariant with respect to simultaneous translation in time by @xmath17 , where @xmath10 is an integer and @xmath18 is the optical period , and rotation about the @xmath14 axis , which is perpendicular to the polarization plane , by the angle @xmath19 . for the @xmath11@xmath20 field </S>",
    "<S> this dynamical symmetry means that @xmath21 , i.e. for @xmath22 the translation in time is by one third of the optical cycle and the rotation is by the angle @xmath23 . if the laser - free molecular hamiltonian is invariant under rotation by the angle @xmath19 then it can be shown in the same way as in appendix a of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite that the afore - mentioned dynamical symmetry leads to the following selection rule : only harmonics of the order @xmath24 are emitted and they are circularly polarized with the helicity @xmath7 , respectively . if a molecule possesses the rotational symmetry @xmath4 then the hamiltonian of this molecule is invariant with respect to a rotation by the angle @xmath25 about the @xmath14 axis , which is chosen to be the molecular quantization axis @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the molecules nh@xmath8 , cf@xmath8i , so@xmath8 , bh@xmath8 , and bf@xmath8 possess the @xmath9 symmetry so that the hamiltonians of these molecules are invariant with respect to rotation by the angle @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> if these molecules are exposed to the @xmath11@xmath20 bicircular field in the @xmath12 polarization plane , the harmonics @xmath27 , @xmath28 , are absent from their hhg spectra , while the harmonics @xmath29 are circularly polarized with the ellipticity @xmath7 .    </S>",

    "<S> high harmonics emitted by polyatomic molecules that obey the @xmath4 symmetry , exposed to an @xmath0@xmath1 bicircular field with the polarization plane perpendicular to the molecular quantization axis , can only have the order @xmath5 and the corresponding ellipticity @xmath7 . </S>",

    "<S> this asymmetry depends on the molecular orientation and may be used for its determination . as in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for atoms , this asymmetry can be used to generate isolated elliptically polarized attosecond pulses by polyatomic molecules .    </S>",
