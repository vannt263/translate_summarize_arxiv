    "if confirmed , this observation would be a crucial indication of the discovery of a new exotic bound state , namely , a nucleus without a proton .",
    "subsequent theoretical studies  @xcite , however , questioned the claim of ref .",

    "such theoretical works were mostly based on the estimations employing standard potential model approaches , which include the @xmath3-@xmath4 mixing that play a crucial role in charge symmetry breaking effects and determination of the spin - parity quantum numbers of the ground state .",
    "in fact , the seminal theoretical work of ref .",
    "@xcite already reported a long time ago on the non - existence of @xmath0 bound state where model parameters of a variational calculation were tuned by the hypertriton binding energy .    in the present exploratory study",
    ", we investigate the possibility of a bound @xmath0 system employing a pionless effective field theory ( eft ) at leading order ( lo ) following the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , which was used to investigate the @xmath5 system and the hypertriton bound state .",
    "previously , low - energy efts were constructed by two of the present authors  @xcite for investigating the hypernuclei and as possible @xmath6 and @xmath7 bound states , respectively .",
    "these investigations revealed substantial indications , corroborating previous claims , that is likely to form a bound state and the bound state of could be an efimov state .",
    "a low - energy eft is constructed by introducing a hard scale @xmath8 that separates the relevant low - energy degrees of freedom from the irrelevant high - energy degrees of freedom which are to be `` integrated out . ''",
    "the advantage of this approach is that it provides with a model - independent and systematic calculational technique with a small number of coupling constants that embody all the ignorance about the short - distance dynamics . for a review on the details of this subject",
    "we refer the reader to refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein .    throughout this work",
    ", we are dealing with a three - body system which , if bound , is likely to have a binding energy much smaller than the pion mass . bound state in ref .",

    "therefore , we can choose the pion mass as the hard scale , i.e. , @xmath9 , so that the pions are integrated out and are not explicitly introduced in the theory .",
    "we may additionally regard the mass difference between the @xmath1 and @xmath10 hyperons , i.e. , @xmath11 , as of the same order as the hard scale @xmath8 .",
    "then our effective lagrangian can be written explicitly in terms of the neutron and @xmath1 fields along with their interactions described by the contact terms , which will be determined in a phenomenological way .",
    "in addition , we will make use of the cyclic singularities that arise in the solutions for the coupled integral equations in the asymptotic limit  @xcite .",
    "such singularities are renormalized by introducing a suitably large momentum cutoff @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) in the loop integrations at the cost of introducing three - body counter terms at lo . consequently , in order to absorb this cutoff dependence , the corresponding three - body coupling may exhibit a cyclic renormalization group ( rg ) evolution termed as the limit cycle  @xcite .",
    "the cyclic singularities are associated with the occurrence of bound states , known as the efimov states , in the resonant / unitary limit  @xcite . in our analysis , we vary the magnitude of the cutoff within a reasonable range to investigate its sensitivity to the formation of bound states . this is a simple test one can perform for checking the feasibility of the @xmath0 system as a three - body bound system .",

    "for the three - body sector , we generally follow the prescription suggested by bedaque , hammer , and van  kolck  @xcite .",
    "namely , a three - body contact interaction , which would otherwise be naively considered as a subleading contribution , should be promoted to lo .",

    "there are two possible allowed total - spin channels , namely , spin-3/2 and spin-1/2 .",
    "since the integral equation for the spin-3/2 channel does not exhibit a limit cycle , we shall henceforth consider only the spin-1/2 channel as demonstrated by the diagrams in fig .",

    "explicitly , we have    @xmath81    where @xmath82 is the one-@xmath1-exchange interaction kernel , and @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the two possible one - neutron - exchange interaction kernels with @xmath85 being the total center - of - momentum energy of the three - body system .",

    "while the inhomogeneous parts of the integral equations only set the overall low - energy scale of the problem in the asymptotic limit of the off - shell momenta @xmath79 and @xmath92 , i.e. , @xmath93 , the behavior of the solutions are completely determined by the homogeneous parts .",
    "this , however , leads to ambiguities in the solution when the equations are numerically solved in the uv limit ( @xmath94 ) without the three - body contact interaction . as evident in the analysis below ,",
    "we need to introduce a three - body counter term only for one of the three elastic scattering modes in the diagonal basis associated with the asymptotic limit cycle behavior .",
    "nevertheless , when the integral equations of eqs .",

    "( [ eq : a ] ) as @xmath95    before discussing the numerical solutions of the coupled integral equations of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : a])([eq : c ] ) , let us consider the approximation suggested in ref .  @xcite for investigating the asymptotic nature of the solutions excluding the three - body interaction .",
    "namely , since the mass difference between the @xmath1 hyperon and neutron is small , i.e. , @xmath96 , the corrections due to small @xmath97 to the integral equations may be ignored in the asymptotic limit",
    ". then we have    @xmath98    where @xmath99 in the asymptotic limit of the respective amplitudes , the dependence on the on - shell momentum @xmath80 is implicitly understood .",

    "the amplitudes @xmath108 are given by @xmath109 with an arbitrary normalization .",
    "the expression in eq .",
    "( [ eq : an ] ) has no scale dependence .",
    "the scale invariance in the asymptotic limit , @xmath110 , suggests that the @xmath19-wave projected amplitudes @xmath111 must exhibit a power - law behavior as  @xcite @xmath112 then , by the mellin transformation , eq .",

    "( [ eq : an ] ) , which is equivalent to @xmath115 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mellin ] ) .",
    "thus , there can be up to a quadruplet set of solutions , i.e. , @xmath116 , to the algebraic part of eq .",
    "( [ eq : mellin ] ) , all of which may not solve the integral equation .",
    "of these , the physically acceptable solutions correspond only to those amplitudes which converge as @xmath117 and for which the mellin transformation exists  @xcite .",
    "this scale - invariant equation then gives the condition to examine the limit cycle behavior of the spin - doublet @xmath0 system in the asymptotic limit .",
    "it is found that whenever the value of @xmath101 exceeds the critical value @xmath118 , i.e. , when @xmath119  @xcite , the solutions become imaginary and a limit cycle appears in the system .",
    "thus , only the first mode with @xmath120 should correspond to a limit cycle behavior with an imaginary solution , @xmath121 with @xmath122 . in addition , for the purpose of renormalization it may be convenient to project out this mode from the other diagonal modes that do not exhibit the limit cycle . to this end , the expression of the counter term in the limit , where the mass difference between neutron and @xmath1 hyperon is ignored , can be constructed by considering the projection operator for the first mode , i.e. , @xmath123 , where @xmath124 is the @xmath103 matrix appearing in eq .",

    "@xmath126 with the physical @xmath1-@xmath127 mass difference . our analysis will reveal that the characteristic cyclic behavior reminiscent of the asymptotic limit cycle clearly survives at low and intermediate momentum range .",
    "the solutions exhibit the strong cutoff dependence and are very likely sensitive to the short - distance dynamics .",
    "this is similar to what was seen , e.g. , in the case of the triton  @xcite as well as the hypertriton  @xcite channels .",
    "in contrast , the other two modes have well - behaved uv stable solutions that do not need a leading - order three - body renormalization .",
    "these modes do not exhibit the limit cycle and insensitive to the short - distance physics as seen , e.g. , in the case of the spin quartet channel of @xmath128 scattering  @xcite .",

    "finally , there is no experimental or empirical information to fix the strength of the contact interaction @xmath50 .",
    "thus , we investigate the limit cycle behavior tuning the energy of the @xmath0 system to the threshold value , i.e. , to vanishing three - body binding energy @xmath135 .     of the three - body contact interaction as a function of the cutoff @xmath12 , where zero binding energy ( @xmath136 ) of the three - body @xmath0 system is maintained .",

    "[ fig : gvslam ] , we plot the strength of the three - body contact interaction @xmath50 as a function of the cutoff @xmath12 , which gives zero binding energy of the three - body system .",
    "the periodic rg evolution of @xmath50 clearly indicates that the short - range part of the one - baryon - exchange interactions become singular , and thus the contact interaction is needed at lo for the renormalization of the singularities .",
    "in addition , one finds that the interactions without the three - body force become stronger for larger values of the cutoff @xmath12 .",
    "however , in the region of small @xmath137 , the two - body interactions alone can not generate attractive forces strong enough to form a bound state .",

    "the lowest critical value of @xmath12 , where @xmath50 changes its sign in the above scenario , is found to be at around @xmath138 .",
    "consequently , if @xmath139 , an @xmath0 bound state can be generated from two - body dynamics alone without the necessity of introducing three - body terms . on further increasing @xmath12 , the second critical cutoff appears at @xmath140 , which indicates the onset of a second bound state .    based on the _ universality _ of the efimov - like states , the occurrence of periodic critical points",

    "we now turn to the cutoff - dependence of the binding energy of the @xmath0 system without the contact term , i.e. , by setting @xmath147 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : bvslam ] we display the result for the the three - body binding energy @xmath148 without including the contact interaction . clearly , the first three - body bound state appears at @xmath149 , and the second one at @xmath150 .",

    "as seen in the figure , the binding energies of the shallow bound states , as they are formed , progressively increase from zero with increasing @xmath12 , and eventually becoming very large , associated with deeply bound states .",
    "in the present study we investigated the possibility of a bound @xmath0 system in the pionless eft at lo by exploring the structure of the coupled integral equations describing the system . because of the limited information to fix the parameters of eft , we are unable to arrive at a definitive conclusion on the formation of a bound @xmath0 state . however ,",
    "by numerically solving the coupled integral equations including the three - body interaction with the binding energy fixed to a certain three - body threshold value , e.g. , @xmath136 as used in this study , the coupling @xmath50 was found to develop cyclic singularities , which is a characteristic of efimov - like bound states .",
    "in addition , we studied the role of short range two - body mechanisms involving the one-@xmath1 and one - neutron exchange interactions by setting @xmath147 .",
    "our analysis reveals that bound states appear without the requirement of the contact interaction only if the cutoff was chosen unnaturally large , @xmath151 , which indicates the nontrivial role of short - range two - body mechanisms that are beyond the scope of this work .    as mentioned before",

    "we use the empirically known value of the @xmath20 scattering length , i.e. , @xmath152  fm  @xcite .",
    "since there is no data for the @xmath21 scattering lengths , we invoke isospin symmetry to determine their values from the @xmath153 scattering lengths .",

    "in contrast with the case of the scattering lengths , there is no _ a priori _ way to determine the strength of the three - body contact interaction without an essential information on a measured three - body observable .",

    "since we treat the effective @xmath2 interaction as point - like , short range mechanisms such as the two - pion exchange interactions appearing as box diagrams with @xmath2-@xmath166 mixing , or other meson exchanges such as the @xmath167 and @xmath168 are to be implicitly taken into account by the contact interactions .",
    "thus , without a three - body contact interaction , a reasonable value of the cutoff would be commensurate with the energy scale of the two - pion/@xmath167-meson/@xmath168-meson exchanges of the @xmath2 interaction , which leads to @xmath169  mev .",
    "this value is consistent with the values of @xmath12 found in similar context in the literature .",
    "for example , when the triton and are treated as three - nucleon and @xmath7 bound systems , respectively , the cutoff values are obtained as @xmath170  mev for the case of the triton  @xcite , and @xmath171  mev for the case of  @xcite , depending on the adopted value of the @xmath19-wave @xmath172 scattering length with the three - body contact interactions turned off .",
    "this contrasts with our case as we indeed need a very large cutoff to a form bound state without the three - body contact term .",
    "therefore , the short - range two - body attractive mechanisms discussed above are unlikely to generate enough attractions in the one-@xmath1-exchange or one - neutron - exchange interaction channels that could lead to @xmath0 bound states .",
    "this ultimately would make it difficult to form an @xmath0 state in nature . however , further rigorous investigations , both theoretical and experimental , are necessary to pin down to true character of the @xmath0 system .",
