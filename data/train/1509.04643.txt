    "one of the best studied processes in flavour physics is the inclusive radiative @xmath2 decay . on the experimental side numerous experiments",
    "@xcite provide an ever increasing amount of data ; leading to the current hfag average @xcite of @xmath6 where all contributing experimental results were converted as to correspond to a lower photon energy cut of @xmath7 .",
    "a further improvement of this number can be anticipated : the belle ii experiment is expected to be able to measure the branching fraction with an uncertainty of about @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "on the theory side , the fact that the rare radiative decay provides both powerful check for the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics and is sensitive to physics beyond the sm ( bsm ) fuelled a tremendous effort ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) to understand the intricacies of the @xmath9 transition .",
    "the most recent result @xcite is given by @xmath10 it is in very good agreement with experiment , cp .  , and therefore provides non - trivial constraints to any new physics model that can generate additional flavour - changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) .",
    "extra - dimensional models of the randall - sundrum ( rs ) type @xcite are known to have a particularly rich flavour phenomenology and can , despite an inherent protection mechanism @xcite , give rise to sizeable fcncs .",
    "the characteristic five - dimensional metric of rs models can be written as @xmath11 in conformal coordinates .",
    "here @xmath12gev is of order of the planck scale @xmath13 .",
    "the fifth coordinate @xmath14 is restricted to the interval @xmath15 $ ] .",
    "the boundaries @xmath16 and @xmath17 are typically referred to as planck and ir brane respectively .",
    "the a priori arbitrary scale @xmath1 is assumed of the order of a tev in order to alleviate gauge - gravity hierarchy issues @xcite .",
    "one of the main reasons for the popularity of these models is the interplay of ( sm ) flavour and properties of 5d wave functions @xcite . in particular ,",
    "mass and ckm hierarchies can be related to the strength of the planck or ir brane localisation of the corresponding kk zero - mode wave functions @xcite .",
    "this intimate relationship of geometry and flavour makes the study of flavour physics observables all the more intriguing . for most processes like meson mixing @xcite or electroweak pseudo - observables @xcite the rs contribution arises ( to leading order ) from tree - level corrections to dimension - six operators , e.g. , four - quark operators in the case of meson mixing .    in the last few years loop - induced processes , that is processes that to leading order do not receive contributions from tree - level diagrams in rs models , have been studied quite extensively .",
    "observables that have been investigated include @xmath18 @xcite , @xmath19 @xcite , higgs production and decay @xcite as well as @xmath20 and @xmath21 @xcite . the latter process just as @xmath18 receives contributions from kaluza - klein ( kk ) states of the higgs ( in models where these are present ) .",
    "the subtleties involving their determination have only recently been pointed out @xcite .",
    "the decay @xmath2 has been studied previously in the context of rs models in @xcite in the 5d picture and in @xcite using a kaluza - klein mode decomposition .",
    "@xcite maintains its focus on the decay @xmath22 .",
    "both works consider only the dominant effects of 5d penguin diagrams and neglect the so - called wrong - chirality higgs couplings terms @xcite .",
    "this is equivalent to an rs model with a naively brane - localised higgs that does not arise from a well - defined limiting procedure .    in this letter",
    "we want to consider the case of a bulk higgs field .",
    "this scenario is quite general as it requires us to take into account both higgs and kk higgs contributions . in order to keep the advantages of the original setup",
    ", we still impose that the bulk higgs is strongly ir localised . following the construction of @xcite for the bulk higgs",
    "gives a 5d wave function for the higgs vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the form @xmath23 here @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 is a parameter related to the 5d mass of the higgs scalar .",
    "the typical width of the zero - mode profile is determined by @xmath27 ; the limit @xmath28 leads to a maximally localised bulk higgs .",
    "for our subsequent analysis we always tacitly assume that this limit has been taken .",
    "we will focus on two types of rs models : the minimal model with the same gauge and fermion multiplets as the standard model and the custodially protected model @xcite with an extended matter and gauge sector ( see @xcite for details on the specific setup ) .",
    "this setup was also used in our work of lepton flavour violation @xcite and we refer the reader to it and to @xcite for explicit expressions for the 5d action and associated feynman rules . for the study of the @xmath29 transition we can directly transfer the results of @xcite to the quark sector . for simplicity , we only consider the effects of the strong interaction and the higgs boson .",
    "electroweak effects could be included in full analogy to the existing computation of flavour violation in the lepton sector , however , their inclusion will not lead to a fundamentally different phenomenology .",
    "since we focus on qcd effects , we do not investigate the phenomenologically interesting decay @xmath30 ; it receives tree - level contributions from four - fermion operators with both quark and lepton fields , which can not be generated by gluon exchanges .",
    "the general strategy of the calculation then follows @xcite .",
    "we start with a fully 5d theory and integrate out the compact fifth dimension by matching onto an effective lagrangian at the kk scale @xmath1",
    ". we will only consider operators of at most dimension six and the corresponding effective lagrangian is the renowned buchmller - wyler lagrangian @xcite .",
    "this step is presented in section [ sec : initial ] .",
    "we then transition from the symmetric phase to the broken electroweak phase .",
    "the wilson coefficients of the resulting operators are subsequently evolved from the high scale @xmath1 down to the typical scale of the process @xmath9 , @xmath31 .",
    "this is discussed in sec.[sec : running ] .",
    "the phenomenological implications of the resulting corrections to the coefficients in the weak hamiltonian are shown in section [ sec : pheno ] . we conclude in sec.[sec :",
    "conclusion ] .",
    "a starting point for a completely general analysis of flavour - violating processes in bsm models is the buchmller - wyler lagrangian @xcite .",
    "the new heavy degrees of freedom have been removed by matching onto the effective ( dimension - six ) lagrangian .",
    "this will capture the dominant effects of any new physics model and only sm fields and dynamics are needed in any subsequent analysis .",
    "the price for taming a bsm model in this way is encoded in the ( potentially ) up to @xmath32 wilson coefficients each of these has to be determined by integrating out heavy degrees of freedom above the matching scale .",
    "here we are only interested in the dominant contribution to @xmath33 transitions in a specific class of rs models .",
    "that is , we only consider the flavour - changing transitions that are mediated by kk gluons and the ( kk ) higgs .",
    "this greatly limits the number of operators that have to be considered .",
    "it is then convenient to consider the following effective lagrangian at the kk scale @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath35\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we dropped operators that either will not contribute to leading logarithmic ( ll ) accuracy to @xmath9 or are generated by exchange of su@xmath36 , u@xmath37 gauge bosons .",
    "@xmath38 corresponds to a quark doublet of with generation index @xmath39 ; @xmath40 and @xmath41 are down- and up - type singlets . @xmath42 and @xmath43 are gluonic and electromagnetic field strength tensor , respectively ; @xmath44 is a generator of @xmath45 in the fundamental representation .",
    "note that the lagrangian is defined in the unbroken electroweak phase and all quarks are still massless .",
    "hence the indices @xmath46 are not commensurate with e.g.  up , charm or top .",
    "the ellipses indicate a sizeable set of omitted operators that either can not be generated via qcd effects or whose contribution to @xmath29 is suppressed .",
    "in writing we tacitly assumed that we are in a flavour basis where the 5d fermion mass matrix is diagonal .",
    "furthermore , already reflects the fact that we will need the coefficient of the electromagnetic dipole operator , i.e.  instead of working with the field strength tensors of su@xmath47 and u@xmath48 we only included the linear combination that will form the photon after ewsb . using fierz transformations it is possible to rewrite some of the operators in by removing the @xmath49 colour structure .",
    "this procedure is useful for a general analysis of flavour violation as one can use a minimal operator basis @xcite . for our simplified analysis",
    "this is not needed .",
    "the wilson coefficients @xmath50 and @xmath51 will set the initial conditions for the rge evolution from @xmath52 to the electroweak scale @xmath53 where they will induce shifts in the coefficients of the well - known weak hamiltonian",
    ". a subsequent evolution down to the scale @xmath31 can then be performed in the standard way .    before moving on to the results for the matching calculation let us briefly review the parameters of the rs model that are relevant to our analysis . as for any bsm study of flavour the yukawa matrices are of crucial importance .",
    "an rs lagrangian incorporates two 5d dimensionless yukawa matrices , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , corresponding to the couplings of the higgs to up- and down - type su(2)@xmath56 singlets .",
    "we always impose that these matrices are anarchic , that is , the matrix elements are roughly of @xmath57 and have random phases . furthermore ,",
    "as already mentioned above , each 5d lagrangian ( independent of the presence of a custodial protection mechanism ) contains a 5d mass @xmath58 for each 5d fermion field @xmath59 . in practice , it is convenient to work with dimensionless parameters @xmath60 . hence , we have in total nine 5d mass parameters : @xmath61 with @xmath62 . in order to obtain a phenomenologically viable low - energy theory that reproduces not only the sm quark masses but also the ckm matrix the mass parameters",
    "can not be completely unrelated .",
    "e.g.  @xmath63 , the mass parameters for the down - type singlets are usually not too far from @xmath64 .",
    "see @xcite for details on the relation of the various parameters for anarchic rs models .",
    "the simplest way to match the 5d theory in ads@xmath65 onto the effective lagrangian is using 5d feynman rules @xcite .",
    "this method is well established , see e.g.  @xcite for various applications . in particular , it avoids dealing directly with kk sums at the price of a more complicated integral structure in loops diagram . however , for operators that can be generated by tree - level interactions in the 5d theory no such complications occur and the matching calculation is straightforward .",
    "a further simplification for tree - level matching comes from the fact that there is only a very limited number of 5d vertex integrals that can occur .",
    "in particular , for intermediate gluons there is only one independent structure .",
    "the four - fermion wilson coefficients differ only by symmetry factors and 5d mass parameters .",
    "we can then use the more general results of @xcite for the matching onto four - lepton operators .",
    "one only needs adjust the couplings and gauge - group factors accordingly .",
    "we find e.g.  for the wilson coefficient of the operator @xmath66 @xmath67 where the zero - mode subtracted 5d gluon propagator is given by @xcite @xmath68 and the 5d wave functions are @xmath69 where @xmath24 .",
    "up to terms suppressed by the ratio @xmath70 one then obtains @xmath71 with @xcite @xmath72    the wilson coefficients of all other operators are related to @xmath73 .",
    "they only differ by symmetry factors that take into account the exchange of identical quarks and the potentially different external wave functions @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "in particular , one finds @xmath76       at order @xmath77 .",
    "the external boson in the diagrams in first line can be a gluon or a photon .",
    "internal bosons lines represent a 5d gluon propagator .",
    "[ fig : topologies],scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the determination of the dipole coefficients @xmath78 and @xmath79 is much more involved . following the calculation of @xcite the @xmath80 contribution to @xmath78",
    "requires the computation of the diagrams shown in the upper row of figure  [ fig : topologies ] .",
    "the contribution to @xmath79 involves the same diagrams ( with the external photon replaced by a gluon ) and the additional non - abelian diagrams shown in the lower row of figure [ fig : topologies ] . since the determination of the electromagnetic dipole operators for leptons requires all topologies ( see @xcite ) both @xmath78 and @xmath79 can be obtained from known results by rescaling each individual diagram with a simple factors .",
    "this also implies directly that the 5d @xmath81 gauge invariance check for the leptonic calculation @xcite can be carried over to the case of diagrams with ( kk ) gluons .",
    "let us consider an example : the first diagram in the first row of figure  [ fig : topologies ] with both the internal and the external boson gluons .",
    "the contribution to @xmath79 can be obtained from the known result for same diagram topology with an external photon and an internal hypercharge boson @xmath82 .",
    "starting from this result we set all fermion hypercharges @xmath83 to @xmath84 , trade the u(1 ) couplings @xmath85 for @xmath86 and replace the global factor @xmath87 from the photon vertex with @xmath88 .",
    "all other diagrams can be determined analogously .",
    "the way the computation of the dipole operator coefficients in @xcite is set up , we need to include contributions to the dipole structure from one - loop diagrams with an insertion of a four - quark operator , see figure  [ fig : schemediag ] .",
    "these extra terms ensure that the wilson coefficient is scheme independent .",
    "this otherwise occurring scheme dependence is a well - known fact in flavour physics , see e.g.  @xcite . by adding the contribution of the four - quark operators we can work with a scheme independent `` effective dipole coefficient '' analogous to the construction of @xcite .    due to the required chiral structure",
    "only four - quark operators that involve both doublet @xmath89 and singlets @xmath40 can contribute : @xmath90 .",
    "up to a trivial colour factor this additional contribution is then again completely analogous to the one in the lepton case and we refer to @xcite for a detailed calculation .",
    "it is well known that loop diagrams with internal higgs exchanges lead to a contribution to the dimension - six dipole operators that depends on products of three yukawa matrices @xcite .",
    "this contribution can be sizeable and is an important source of flavour violation @xcite .",
    "therefore it is important to consider this _",
    "higgs contribution _ alongside the previously discussed gauge - contribution .    for a bulk higgs",
    "we further need to consider the effect of its kk excitations .",
    "the mass of the first few higgs kk states is roughly proportional to the inverse width of the corresponding zero - mode @xcite .",
    "nonetheless these modes do not necessarily decouple even for a strongly localised zero - mode .",
    "this non - decoupling was first shown in @xcite ; the typical impact of the higgs kk tower is comparable to the effect of the zero - mode alone and therefore non - negligible for the determination of the dipole operator coefficient .    .",
    "the box denotes an insertion of a four - fermion operator . [",
    "fig : schemediag],scaledwidth=20.0% ]    let us first consider the effect of the zero - mode higgs only .",
    "we can partially use the results of @xcite for the leptonic dimension - six dipole operator to construct the corresponding result in the quark sector .",
    "again we only need to replace u(1 ) charges and add su(3 ) colour factors as appropriate . for diagrams where a higgs is emitted from an external leg and not from the loop ( see the diagram in figure [ fig : massdependence ] for an example ) , one further has to distinguish two different contributions : those where the external quark propagator propagates kk modes and so - called off - shell terms that arise if the external propagator is a mass - less zero - mode , but the @xmath91 pole in the propagator is cancelled by powers of @xmath92 in the numerator , see @xcite for a detailed discussion .",
    "the latter terms are basically irrelevant for leptons as they are effectively suppressed by a sm lepton yukawa coupling .",
    "they may however play a role in the quark sector due to the large top yukawa coupling and we include these terms in @xmath93 .",
    "it is convenient to use the definition @xmath94 for the sm covariant derivative with @xmath95 , @xmath96 being photon and gluon field ; @xmath97 is the charge of the positron .",
    "this definition then coincides with the choice usually employed in studies of the @xmath29 transition , see e.g.  @xcite , and makes the expressions in the subsequent sections consistent with the standard literature .    in the minmal rs model we then find @xmath98_{ij } \\ , g^{(0)}_{d_j}(1/t ) \\\\",

    "we absorbed the effect of the kk bosons in global factors called @xmath106 .",
    "these were assumed to be roughly independent of the 5d mass parameters and therefore allowed for compact analytic expressions .",
    "nevertheless there is a nontrivial dependence of the kk contribution on the 5d mass parameters ; in particular for diagrams with a higgs emission from an external line . in the lepton sector",
    "this effect is quite small especially when compared to the sizeable numerical uncertainties ; we therefore neglected it in @xcite . in the quark sector",
    "the wide range of 5d masses leads to more noticeable effects ; since we can only determine these numerically we do not give an explicit expression .",
    "to give an idea of the potential size : the left panel in figure [ fig : massdependence ] shows the additional effect of the mass dependence ( without numerical uncertainties ) for the diagram shown on the right of the same figure .",
    "one can see that the effect is indeed of the order a few percent for leptons , but can potentially be of @xmath57 for quarks .",
    "it is therefore not feasible to use a simple analytic approximation as was done in the lepton sector .",

    "we therefore treat the effect of whole higgs kk modes similarly to how the gauge - contribution is handled . here",
    "we only remark that the total effect of the kk modes is smaller than the effect of the higgs zero - mode but not parametrically so , see also @xcite .",
    "we only considered contributions to the wilson coefficients that proportional to @xmath77 or , in the case of dipole operators , enhanced by 5d yukawa couplings .",
    "obviously , exchange of hypercharge bosons and su(2 ) bosons will also generate four - fermion operators , contribute to both dipoles and give rise to operators of the schematic form @xmath109 .",
    "the latter class of operators will contribute to e.g.  flavour - changing z couplings .",
    "the u(1 ) gauge coupling at a scale of @xmath110 is roughly @xmath111 .",
    "the su(2)@xmath56 coupling is significantly larger with @xmath112 , but still smaller than @xmath113 .",
    "the fact that the weak coupling is only about a factor of three smaller than the strong coupling may warrant including weak effects in the matching calculation . including",
    "the effect of the other gauge bosons is not a principle problem ; their contribution to the four - fermion coefficients as well as the dipole coefficients can directly be obtained from results for leptonic dipoles in the literature , see @xcite .",
    "a further effect that would have be taken into account when considering weak corrections is the modification of of sm parameters and relations that have been utilised in the sm computation .",
    "in particular the relation of @xmath114 and the @xmath115 mass , that is frequently used when rewriting the sm expressions is affected by higher - dimensional operators ( see @xcite for the general case and @xcite for the a discussion within the rs model ) .",
    "it should be noted that kk higgses do not give rise to relevant contributions to the four - fermion operators if the higgs zero - mode is strongly localised towards the ir brane , which we always assume .",
    "an exchange of a sm higgs can give a contribution to the four - fermion operators .",
    "but only in a second matching step at the intermediate scale @xmath116 when the higgs degrees of freedom would be removed . in this case",
    "the flavour - changing higgs coupling arise from dimension - six operators of the form @xmath117 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "however , even then the contribution will be suppressed by an additional sm b - quark yukawa coupling .",
    "we therefore ignore these contributions .",
    "the typical energy release in a decay of the type @xmath2 is of the order of the @xmath51 quark mass and a typical scale choice is thus @xmath118 . from the standard model calculation of @xmath119 in the framework of the weak effective hamiltonian ,",
    "see @xcite for an overview , it is known that the rge evolution from the weak scale @xmath120 down to @xmath31 introduces sizeable operator mixing @xcite .",
    "our matching calculation was performed the scale @xmath121 and qcd corrections are bound to be of importance .",
    "we then have two possible strategies : we can either evolve the terms in the dimension - six lagrangian from the high scale @xmath52 to the electroweak scale within the unbroken sm , then change to the broken phase and complete the evolution down to the scale @xmath31 .",
    "the required anomalous dimensions for the first step can be found e.g.  in @xcite .",
    "alternatively , we can work with the  broken \" operator basis already at the high scale and perform the evolution down to the low scale in one step ( taking into account the top - mass threshold ) .",
    "the first approach is more in the spirit of a matching onto a set of dimension - six operators .",
    "the second option has simpler  logistics \" as we only need consider a single rge .",
    "both strategies are valid and ultimately must be equivalent in a situation where no additional dynamics between @xmath52 and @xmath122 need to be taken into account .",
    "however , for the specific process at hand the second option has the additional advantage that the structure of the required evolution equation has been studied in some detail in @xcite .",
    "while @xcite ultimately focusses on scenarios with e.g.  a flavour - changing @xmath123 , their operator basis contains the full set of normal and colour - flipped four - quark operators .",

    "after the transition to the broken electroweak phase , we used the results of @xcite to include the effect of operator mixing due to rge evolution from the kk scale @xmath1 to @xmath31 to ll accuracy .",

    "we find that the additional contributions to the branching fraction can be sizeable for large yukawas and moderate kk scales @xmath1 .",
    "the strong sensitivity of the rs contribution to the specific form of the yukawa matrices makes it challenging to directly constrain the parameter space of the model . nonetheless , the decay is a useful tool that complements other powerful probes for the kk scale in the quark sector , like higgs production / decay @xcite .",
