    "the goal of this paper is to construct higher categories of @xmath4-algebras and their iterated bimodules , using a completely algebraic or combinatorial approach to these objects , and establish some of their basic properties .",
    "our construction is motivated by the interesting connections of these higher categories to topological quantum field theories , and a notion of `` higher brauer groups '' that can be extracted from them .",
    "we will discuss these potential applications , both of which we intend to explore further in future work , after summarizing the main results of the present paper .      if @xmath9 is a monoidal category ,",
    "then the associative algebra objects is the cartesian product . ] in @xmath9 and their bimodules form a bicategory @xmath10 .",
    "more precisely , this bicategory has    * associative algebras in @xmath9 as objects , * @xmath11-@xmath12-bimodules in @xmath9 as 1-morphisms from @xmath11 to @xmath12 , * bimodule homomorphisms as 2-morphisms ,    with composition of 1-morphisms given by taking tensor products : if @xmath13 is an @xmath11-@xmath12-bimodule and @xmath14 is a @xmath12-@xmath15-bimodule then their composite is @xmath16 with its natural @xmath11-@xmath15-bimodule structure .",
    "moreover , if @xmath9 is a symmetric monoidal category , such as @xmath17 for @xmath18 a commutative ring , then @xmath10 inherits a symmetric monoidal structure .",
    "induces such a symmetric monoidal structure , this seems to have been completely defined only quite recently by shulman in @xcite , following a construction of a braided monoidal structure by garner and gurski in @xcite . considering the difficulty of even defining symmetric monoidal bicategories in full generality , this is perhaps not entirely unsurprising  cf .",
    "@xcite for a discussion of the history of such definitions .",
    "] when @xmath18 is a commutative ring , this symmetric monoidal bicategory @xmath19 organizes a wealth of interesting algebraic information  for example , two @xmath18-algebras are equivalent in @xmath19 precisely when they are morita equivalent , i.e. have equivalent categories of modules .",
    "since all the concepts involved have derived analogues , it is reasonable to expect that there is a derived or higher - categorical version of the bicategory @xmath19 , based on chain complexes of @xmath18-modules up to quasi - isomorphism .",
    "more generally , it should be possible to allow @xmath18 to be a differential graded algebra  or even a ring spectrum , with chain complexes replaced by @xmath18-modules in spectra up to stable weak equivalence .",
    "in this paper we will indeed construct such generalizations of the bicategory of algebras and bimodules .",
    "however , the coherence issues that must be solved to define these seem intractable from the point of view of classical ( enriched ) category theory . to avoid this problem ,",
    "we instead work in the setting of @xmath0-categories .",
    "roughly speaking , an _",
    "@xmath0-category _ ( or _ @xmath20-category _ ) is a structure that has objects and morphisms like a category , but also `` homotopies '' ( or invertible 2-morphisms ) between morphisms , `` homotopies between homotopies '' ( or invertible 3-morphisms ) , and so on .",
    "the morphisms can be composed , but the composition is not strictly associative , only associative up to a coherent choice of ( higher ) homotopies .",
    "using homotopy theory there are a number of ways of making this idea precise in such a way that one can actually work with the resulting structures ; we will make use of the theory of _ quasicategories _ as developed by joyal and lurie  @xcite , which is by far the best - developed variant .",
    "similarly , one can consider _ @xmath8-categories _ for @xmath21 ; these have @xmath22-morphisms for all @xmath22 that are required to be invertible when @xmath23 , and are thus the `` @xmath0-version '' of @xmath24-categories .",
    "we will encounter them in the guise of barwick s _",
    "@xmath24-fold segal spaces _",
    "@xcite , which we will review below in  [ subsec : inftyn ] .    in this higher - categorical setting",
    "there is a natural notion of a _ monoidal _ @xmath0-category , i.e. an @xmath0-category equipped with a tensor product that is associative up to coherent homotopy .",
    "our first main result , which we will prove in  [ sec : algbimod ] , is a construction of an @xmath1-category @xmath25 of algebras , bimodules , and bimodule homomorphisms in any monoidal @xmath0-category @xmath5 that satisfies some mild technical assumptions .    in the @xmath0-categorical",
    "setting it is also natural to ask how this structure extends to _ @xmath4-algebras_. in the context of ordinary categories , an object equipped with two compatible associative multiplications is a commutative algebra .",
    "when we pass to higher categories , however , this is no longer true .",
    "the most familiar example of this phenomenon is iterated algebras in the 2-category of categories  if we consider associative algebras in the appropriate 2-categorical sense , these are monoidal categories ; categories with two compatible monoidal structures are then braided monoidal categories , and ones with three or more monoidal structures are symmetric monoidal categories . in general ,",
    "objects with @xmath26 compatible associative algebra structures in an @xmath24-category are commutative algebras for @xmath27  this is a form of the baez - dolan stabilization hypothesis ; in other words , in an @xmath24-category compatible associative algebra structures give @xmath28 different algebraic structures .",
    "for an @xmath0-category , then , objects equipped with multiple compatible multiplications give an infinite sequence of algebraic structures lying between associative and commutative algebras , namely the @xmath29-algebras for @xmath30 .. ] in particular , we can consider @xmath29-algebras in the @xmath0-category @xmath31 of @xmath0-categories , which gives the notion of _",
    "@xmath29-monoidal @xmath0-categories _ , i.e. @xmath0-categories equipped with @xmath24 compatible tensor products .",
    "the general version of our first main result , which we will prove in  [ subsec : np1foldcat ] , is then a construction of @xmath3-categories of @xmath29-algebras in any nice @xmath29-monoidal @xmath0-category :    let @xmath5 be a nice @xmath29-monoidal @xmath0-category",
    ". then there exists an @xmath3-category @xmath32 whose objects are @xmath29-algebras in @xmath5 , with 1-morphisms given by @xmath33-algebras in bimodules in @xmath5 , 2-morphisms by @xmath34-algebras in bimodules in bimodules in @xmath5 , and so forth .    here",
    "the precise meaning of `` nice '' amounts to the existence of well - behaved relative tensor products over algebras in @xmath5 , which is needed to have well - defined compositions in these higher categories .",
    "for example , we can take @xmath5 to be the ( symmetric monoidal ) @xmath0-category @xmath17 of modules over a commutative ring spectrum @xmath18 or the `` derived @xmath0-category '' @xmath35 of modules over an associative ring @xmath18 , obtained by inverting the quasi - isomorphisms in the category of chain complexes of @xmath18-modules ( more generally , we can consider the analogous localization of the category of dg - modules over a dg - algebra @xmath18 ) .",
    "if @xmath5 is a symmetric monoidal @xmath0-category , we will also show that @xmath32 inherits a symmetric monoidal structure .",
    "more precisely , our second main result ( proved in  [ subsec : algnmon ] ) is as follows :    if @xmath5 is a nice @xmath36-monoidal @xmath0-category , then the @xmath3-category @xmath32 inherits a natural @xmath37-monoidal structure .",
    "finally , our third main result , which we prove in  [ subsec : algnmaps ] , explains how the @xmath3-categories @xmath32 are related for different @xmath24 :    [ thm : maps ] suppose @xmath5 is a nice @xmath4-monoidal @xmath0-category .",
    "then for any @xmath4-algebras @xmath11 and @xmath12 in @xmath5 , the @xmath8-category @xmath38 of maps from @xmath11 to @xmath12 is equivalent to @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the @xmath0-category of @xmath11-@xmath12-bimodules in @xmath5 equipped with a natural @xmath33-monoidal structure . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath41 is the unit of the monoidal structure then @xmath42 .",
    "if @xmath9 is a symmetric monoidal category , we say that an object @xmath43 is _ invertible _ if there exists another object @xmath44 such that @xmath45 is isomorphic to the identity ; by considering the homotopy 1-category this gives a notion of invertible objects in any symmetric monoidal @xmath8-category .    in particular , if @xmath18 is a commutative ring then the invertible objects of @xmath19 are those associative @xmath18-algebras @xmath11 that have an inverse @xmath46 in the sense that @xmath47 is morita equivalent to @xmath18",
    " these are precisely the _ azumaya algebras _ over @xmath18 . by considering these invertible objects and the invertible 1- and 2-morphisms between them",
    "we obtain a symmetric monoidal 2-groupoid @xmath48 with very interesting homotopy groups :    * @xmath49 , i.e. the set of isomorphism classes of objects in @xmath48 , is the classical brauer group of azumaya @xmath18-algebras , * @xmath50 is the picard group of invertible @xmath18-modules , * @xmath51 is the group @xmath52 of multiplicative units in @xmath18 .",
    "moreover , the `` loop space '' @xmath53 is the _",
    "picard groupoid _ of invertible @xmath18-modules and isomorphisms .    using the results of this paper",
    ", we can also consider the invertible objects in @xmath32 for any suitable symmetric monoidal @xmath0-category @xmath5 .",
    "restricting to the invertible @xmath22-morphisms between these for all @xmath22 , we get a symmetric monoidal @xmath0-groupoid @xmath54 , or equivalently an @xmath55-space ; we will call this the _",
    "@xmath24-brauer space _ of @xmath5 .",
    "it is evident from the definition of the invertible objects that this @xmath55-space is _ grouplike _ , i.e. the induced multiplication on @xmath56 makes this monoid a group , and so it corresponds to a connective spectrum .",
    "it follows immediately from theorem  [ thm : maps ] that the loop space @xmath57 is equivalent to @xmath58 .",
    "thus the @xmath24-brauer spaces @xmath54 are a sequence of deloopings , and so we can combine these spaces into a non - connective `` brauer spectrum '' @xmath59 with @xmath60 for @xmath61 .    if @xmath18 is a commutative ring spectrum , the `` @xmath24-brauer groups '' @xmath62 can be thought of as consisting of the @xmath4-analogues of ( derived ) azumaya algebras , considered up to an @xmath4-variant of morita equivalence . in particular ,    * for @xmath63 we recover the brauer groups of commutative ring spectra and the derived brauer groups of commutative rings , as studied by ton  @xcite , szymik  @xcite , baker - richter - szymik  @xcite , antieau - gepner  @xcite , and others ; * for @xmath64 we recover the picard group of invertible @xmath18-modules , as studied by hopkins - mahowald - sadofsky  @xcite , may  @xcite , mathew - stojanoska  @xcite , and others .",
    "the `` negative brauer groups '' ( i.e. the positive homotopy groups of @xmath65 ) are also easy to describe : for @xmath66 we get the homotopy groups of the units of @xmath18 , i.e. @xmath67 , where @xmath68 denotes the components of @xmath69 lying over the units in @xmath70 ; for @xmath71 we thus have @xmath72 .",
    "a fascinating question for future research is whether the spaces @xmath73 for @xmath18 a ( connective ) commutative ring spectrum satisfy tale descent in the same way as the brauer spaces @xmath48 ( as proved by ton  @xcite and antieau - gepner  @xcite ) .    if the tale - local triviality results of the same authors for @xmath48 also extend to @xmath74 , it should be possible to use the resulting descent spectral sequence to compute the higher brauer groups in some simple cases .",
    "in fact , this would imply that the higher brauer groups are closely related to tale cohomology ; generalizing the known results for @xmath63 and @xmath75 one might optimistically conjecture that in general @xmath76 where the first factor occurs since we are considering non - connective @xmath18-modules ( or chain complexes of @xmath18-modules that are not required to be @xmath75 in negative degrees ) .",
    "_ topological quantum field theories _ ( or _ tqfts _ ) were introduced by atiyah  @xcite as a way of formalizing mathematically some particularly simple examples of quantum field theories constructed by witten .",
    "the original definition is quite easy to state :    let @xmath77 be the category with objects closed @xmath78-manifolds and morphisms ( diffeomorphism classes of ) @xmath24-dimensional cobordisms between these ( thus a morphism from @xmath13 to @xmath14 is an @xmath79-manifold with boundary @xmath12 , with an identification of @xmath80 with @xmath81 ) .",
    "the disjoint union of manifolds gives a symmetric monoidal structure on @xmath77 , and an _",
    "@xmath24-dimensional topological quantum field theory _ valued in a symmetric monoidal category @xmath9 is a symmetric monoidal functor @xmath82 .",
    "requiring the manifolds and cobordisms to be equipped with various structures , such as orientations or framings , gives different variants of the category @xmath77 .",
    "we get various flavours of tqfts , such as oriented or framed tqfts , by considering these different versions of @xmath77 . in examples",
    "the category @xmath9 is usually the category @xmath83 of complex vector spaces .",
    "one reason mathematicians became interested in tqfts is that they lead to interesting invariants of manifolds : if @xmath84 is an n - dimensional tqft , then @xmath85 assigns a complex number to any closed @xmath24-manifold @xmath13  we can consider @xmath13 as a cobordism from the empty set to the empty set , and since this is the unit of the monoidal structure on @xmath77 , @xmath86 is a linear map @xmath87 , which is given by multiplication with a complex number .    to compute the number @xmath86",
    "we can cut @xmath13 along suitable submanifolds of codimension 1 and use the functoriality of @xmath85 .",
    "this is enough to compute these invariants in very low dimensions ( @xmath88 ) . in higher dimensions , however , we would like to be able to cut our manifolds in more flexible ways , for example by choosing a triangulation of @xmath13 , to make the invariants more computable .",
    "this led mathematicians to consider the notion of _ extended _ topological quantum field theories ; this was formalized by baez and dolan @xcite in the language of _ @xmath24-categories _ ( building on earlier work by , among others , freed  @xcite and lawrence  @xcite ) .    for the definition of baez and dolan we consider an @xmath24-category @xmath89 whose objects are compact @xmath75-manifolds , with morphisms given by 1-dimensional cobordisms between 0-manifolds , and in general @xmath22-morphisms for @xmath90 given by @xmath22-dimensional cobordisms between manifolds with corners .",
    "( for the @xmath24-morphisms we take diffeomorphism classes of these . ) the disjoint union should equip this with a symmetric monoidal structure , but giving a precise definition of this symmetric monoidal @xmath24-category becomes increasingly intractable as @xmath24 increases .",
    "a complete definition has been given by schommer - pries  @xcite in the case @xmath91 , but for larger @xmath24 it seems that an appropriate notion of symmetric monoidal @xmath24-category has not even been defined .",
    "given such a symmetric monoidal @xmath24-category @xmath89 , an _ @xmath24-dimensional extended tqft _ valued in a symmetric monoidal @xmath24-category @xmath5 is a symmetric monoidal functor @xmath92 . as before ,",
    "considering various structures on the manifolds in @xmath89 gives different flavours of field theories , such as framed , oriented , and unoriented .",
    "baez and dolan also conjectured that there is a simple classification of _ framed _ extended topological quantum field theories :    a framed extended tqft @xmath93 is classified by the object @xmath94 .",
    "moreover , the objects of @xmath5 that correspond to framed tqfts admit a simple algebraic description : they are precisely the _ @xmath24-dualizable objects_. ( we refer to @xcite for a precise definition of @xmath24-dualizable objects . )    at the time , however , the foundations for higher category theory required to realize their ideas did not yet exist .",
    "the necessary foundations have only been developed during the past decade , with the work of barwick , bergner , joyal , lurie , rezk , and many others .",
    "the resulting theory of _",
    "@xmath8-categories _ is often easier to work with than the more restricted notion of @xmath24-category  in particular , it is not hard to give a good definition of symmetric monoidal @xmath8-categories for arbitrary @xmath24 .",
    "we can then consider an @xmath8-category @xmath95 of cobordisms , where we take diffeomorphisms as our @xmath79-morphisms , smooth homotopies as the @xmath96-morphisms , and so on .",
    "this also turns out to be much easier to define than the analogous @xmath24-category ; a sketch of a definition is given by lurie  @xcite , and the full details of the construction have recently been worked out by calaque and scheimbauer  @xcite .",
    "it is then natural to define extended tqfts valued in a symmetric monoidal @xmath8-category as symmetric monoidal functors from @xmath95 . in this more general",
    "setting , lurie was able to prove the cobordism hypothesis ( although so far only a detailed sketch @xcite of the proof has appeared ) .",
    "in fact , lurie also proves classification theorems for other flavours of tqfts , such as oriented or unoriented ones , in terms of the homotopy fixed points for an action of the orthogonal group @xmath97 on the space of @xmath24-dualizable objects in any symmetric monoidal @xmath8-category .",
    "the cobordism hypothesis works for an arbitrary symmetric monoidal @xmath8-category , and so leaves open the question of what the appropriate target is for the interesting field theories that arise in physics and geometry .",
    "motivation from physics ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) suggests that in general a tqft should assign an @xmath98-category enriched in vector spaces , or more generally in chain complexes of vector spaces , to a closed @xmath26-manifold .",
    "the higher category of @xmath4-algebras and iterated bimodules we will construct here can be considered as a special case of this general target : @xmath4-algebras in some @xmath0-category @xmath5 are the same thing as @xmath8-categories enriched in @xmath5 that have one object , one 1-morphism ,  , and one @xmath78-morphism .",
    "in fact , it is possible to extend the definitions we consider here to get definitions of enriched @xmath8-categories and iterated bimodules between them ; we hope to use these to construct an @xmath3-category of enriched @xmath8-categories in a sequel to this paper .",
    "although not completely general , the tqfts valued in the symmetric monoidal @xmath3-category of @xmath4-algebras are still very interesting .",
    "this situation is discussed in @xcite , where the following results are stated without proof :       a.   all @xmath4-algebras in @xmath5 are @xmath24-dualizable in @xmath32 , and so give rise to framed @xmath24-dimensional extended tqfts .",
    "( more precisely , all objects of @xmath32 are dualizable , and all @xmath22-morphisms have adjoints for @xmath99 . ) b.   the framed @xmath24-dimensional extended tqft associated to an @xmath4-algebra @xmath11 is given by the _",
    "factorization homology _ or _ topological chiral homology _ of @xmath11 .",
    "( these invariants were first introduced by lurie  @xcite and also independently by andrade  @xcite , and have since been extensively developed by a number of other authors , in particular francis and collaborators ; see for example @xcite .",
    "an overview can also be found in ginot s lecture notes @xcite . ) c.   an @xmath4-algebra @xmath11 is @xmath79-dualizable if and only if it is dualizable as a module over its @xmath100-factorization homology for all @xmath101 .",
    "( for @xmath63 , this is equivalent to @xmath11 being _ smooth _ and _ proper _  cf .",
    "@xcite . )",
    "scheimbauer  @xcite has constructed factorization homology as an extended tqft valued in a geometric variant of @xmath32 ( defined using locally constant factorization algebras on certain stratifications of @xmath102 ) , which confirms the first two parts of this conjecture .",
    "it follows from theorem  [ thm : maps ] that ( i ) is equivalent to the 1-morphisms in @xmath32 having adjoints for all @xmath103 , and we hope to use this to give algebraic proofs of ( i ) and ( iii ) .",
    "as already mentioned , a geometric construction of @xmath3-categories closely related to @xmath104 has been worked out by scheimbauer  @xcite . however , the natural definition of bimodules in the factorization algebra setting is not quite the same as ours : the bimodules that arise from factorization algebras are _",
    "pointed_. if @xmath105 denotes scheimbauer s @xmath3-category of @xmath4-algebras in @xmath5 , we therefore expect the relation to our work to be as follows :    let @xmath5 be a nice @xmath4-monoidal @xmath0-category .",
    "then @xmath105 is equivalent to @xmath106 .    in order to carry out such a comparison",
    ", one would need to know that the iterated bimodules we consider can equivalently be described as algebras for @xmath0-operads of `` little discs '' on certain stratifications of @xmath107  this would be a generalization of the dunn - lurie additivity theorem for @xmath4-algebras . such a result appears to follow from forthcoming work of ayala and hepworth ( extending @xcite ) ; we hope to use this to compare the algebraic version of @xmath32 we construct here to the factorization - algebra - based version of scheimbauer in a sequel to this paper .",
    "an alternative geometric construction of @xmath104 is also part of unpublished work of ayala , francis , and rozenblyum , related to the construction sketched in the work of morrison and walker on the blob complex  @xcite .    in the case",
    "@xmath63 , an alternative construction of the double @xmath0-categories @xmath25 using symmetric @xmath0-operads can be extracted from @xcite .",
