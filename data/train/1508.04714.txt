    "+ in addition to the data points provided by solar observations , multiple missions have conducted studies of stellar emission in the mg ii lines .",
    "the shape of mg ii h&k varies significantly across stellar types : from pure absorption in altair to single peaked emission in @xmath1 eri @xcite .",
    "the differences between the shape of mg ii h&k are a strong diagnostic of stellar winds and shocks in extended chromospheres like that of @xmath0 ori @xcite .",
    "variability and activity cycles have been detected in the mg ii h&k lines in other stars @xcite .",
    "while stellar chromospheres exist in some form across the cooler half of the main sequence , there is a complicated relationship with coronae : a chromosphere is a prerequisite to form a corona , but stars with a chromosphere do not need to have a corona @xcite .",
    "the chromosphere - corona link is an important one for solar - terrestrial studies .",
    "solar irradiance is a driving factor in determining the ion populations of the earth s upper atmosphere @xcite . while mg ii h&k are unlikely to play a significant role in thermospheric photoionization , mg ii irradiance has been shown to be a superior proxy to euv irradiance over the f10.7 radio index @xcite .",
    "+ the complex profiles observed in the solar mg ii doublet can be attributed to the lines complex formation .",
    "a seminal study was presented in @xcite .",
    "the mg ii doublet are resonance lines for a highly abundant element . as such they are very optically thick at the line cores , which form at relatively low densities under nlte conditions .",
    "the formation depth of the profile varies significantly with wavelength .",
    "the core is estimated to form between 1 - 3 mm above the ( @xmath2 ) photosphere . at @xmath30.5  the line opacity",
    "is reduced such that the formation layer maps near the temperature minimum , 500 km above the photosphere . @xcite and @xcite used a radiative mhd numerical simulation @xcite to forward model the emission of the mg ii lines .",

    "iris intensity units of dn .    given the clustered distribution of magnetic flux , the distribution of plage and network fields are less uniform statistical samples .",
    "the magnetic field strength in plage varies significantly from region to region and plays a role in the scatter of the @xmath8 and @xmath9 distributions .",
    "plage and network are brighter than internetwork and wider at h1 . for nearly all statistics ,",
    "the distributions are more dispersed than internetwork .",
    "the h1 widths are well correlated with viewing angle .",
    "the h2 widths have a wider spread with an extended low - width tail .",

    "network is more dispersed in h3 velocity than internetwork or plage . given",
    "the strong flows often observed in active region coronal spectra , it is surprising that network exhibits a higher percentage of high - velocity profiles than plage .",
    "+ @xcite discussed the center - to - limb variation of the mg ii k profiles based on the predictions of a series of semi - empirical models of the solar atmosphere . in that paper ,",
    "model b represents the mean internetwork while model f represents the bright network .",
    "table 4 compares the spectral intensities of the model and our derived profile statistics . while the semi - empirical models capture the variation of the emission peak ( between internetwork and network and center - to - limb ) , it does not capture the variation in the core .",
    "the semi - empirical model predicts relatively little variation in the core intensity as a function of @xmath10 , while we observe a measurable decline in the core at the limb . as discussed in section 4.1 ,",
    "if the formation height of h3 is highly variable then the limb darkening effect can be explained by the increased sampling of high - lying and dark fibrils at low-@xmath10 . + the semi - empirical models are constructed as a tool to incorporate a broad range of spectral information and convert it into a consistent model of the atmosphere .",
    "these static models provide us information on the structure of an averaged solar atmosphere , while the 3d mhd models provide information on the dynamics based on physics but limited by the computational power . by comparing the iris data with these models ,",
    "we increase our understanding of this complex dataset and identify portions of the model which require adaption .",
    "most of our understanding of the chromosphere is based on ground based observations of ca ii and h@xmath0 . while datasets like that of sst / crisp provide us the highest spatial resolution measurements of the chromosphere , they are limited in spatial fov and the often brief periods of prime atmospheric seeing .",
    "the iris spacecraft has opened up a new window into the chromosphere , with the ability to resolve sub - arcsec structure and the stability and atmosphere - free seeing to produce long - duration datasets .",
    "one of the primary purposes of the analysis of solar spectral lines is to diagnose the physical processes and the thermodynamic conditions of the atmosphere .",
    "prior to establishing diagnostics , it is essential to identify the methodology for measuring the necessary spectral features , and our works fits into this first step .",
    "the mg ii k line differs slightly from mg ii h in formation height due to the difference in oscillator strength .",
    "it is important to extend this analysis to that line for additional diagnostic capabilities , however our method requires adaption .",
    "the mn i line at 2975.5  can blend with the k - line for wide profiles .",
    "a well constrained fit model can likely be constructed with a spectral window that also includes the unblended mn i 2999.1  line .",
    "this is a likely direction for future analysis .",
    "+ @xcite and @xcite have used an advanced numerical simulation of the solar atmosphere to forward model mg ii h&k emission and compare the derived spectral information which the physical properties of the emitting plasma .",
    "many of the statistics we have measured in this dataset are identical to those discussed by those authors .",
    "a direct comparison between the modeled profiles and observed profiles is difficult .",
    "while numerical models have proven powerful in describing specific physical processes ( the formation of shocks by high frequency vertical velocity fluctuations described the @xcite , for example ) , the models are not producing many of the spectral features we identify in the observations .",
    "we know that the observed profiles are significantly broader than those forward modeled by bifrost .",
    "although the forward model incorporates magnetic fields , the limited scale and largely bipolar distribution of magnetic elements are not direct analogues to all solar structures .",
    "as reported in @xcite , the 3d radiation field ( as opposed to a 1d vertical flux ) can have a strong effect on the observed structure of the chromosphere .",
    "ultimately , the distribution of mg ii ions , the relative populations of the ground and doublet states , and the incident radiation field along the line of sight are the determining factors for the shape of the emergent mg ii h profile . both semi - empirical and mhd atmospheres provide us a means of calculating that distribution with strict limits on which physics can be included . + the analysis of optically thick spectral lines present researchers with a double edge sword : the shape of the emergent profile encodes the thermal and hydrodynamic information of a significant vertical swath of the atmosphere , but the physical quantities we ultimately seek to measure are entangled .",
    "one potential diagnostic is a mg ii profile inversion , similar to those used for optical spectropolarimetric data @xcite .",
    "of course inversions codes have largely operated in the regime where lte is a reasonable approximation , which is not true for mg ii .",
    "the next step in this research is the integration of our derived quantities into our physical models ( cartoon or otherwise ) of the how the dynamic chromosphere is structured .",
    "+ in this paper , we have dissected a dataset containing mg ii h spectral profiles over the full solar disk .",
    "we decomposed the dataset into structural regions based on the magnetic field and quantified the differences between the regions based on a number of profile statistics .",
    "the internetwork is dim at h2 and deeply reversed .",
    "the network is brighter at h1 , h2 , and h3 than internetwork .",
    "it has enhanced h1 width compared with internetwork .",
    "plage is brighter and more variable at h2 than network or internetwork .",
    "it has a small h2 width and weak reversal .",
    "single peaked profiles occur all over the disk , but most commonly in plage .",
    "we have created maps of many statistics for the line profiles .",
    "there are coherent but varied structures visible in width , intensity , and velocity statistics .",
    "fibrils are primarily visible in plage in @xmath11 and in network in @xmath9 .",
    "both strong and weak field regions exhibit a great deal of profile variability which is the result of chromospheric dynamics .",
    "we find strong correlations for the doppler shift of the h3 core and the asymmetry in the h2 peaks and also between the widths of h1 and h2 .",
    "we calculated the center - to - limb variation of a number of statistics and compare them with the predictions of a semi - empirical model .",
    "we find that both h3 and h2 exhibit limb darkening such that the core depth is flat as a function of @xmath10 , while the semi - empirical model does not predict a strong limb darkening for h3 .",
    "our measurement of this effect is most robust in internetwork .",
    "this study presents the most comprehensive observational study on solar mg ii spectra to date , but it is clear that there are many facets on the formation and variability of this spectral line that are still not fully understood .",
    "it is essential to keep developing atmospheric models which can accommodate the great deal of dynamical and structural variability we observe in high resolution observations of the chromosphere .",
    "the photospheric velocity field strongly modulates the plasma conditions and radiation field in the lower chromosphere , and the upper chromosphere is highly structured by the magnetic field in the @xmath12 regime .",
    "both of these boundary conditions must be considered in our future modeling efforts ."
