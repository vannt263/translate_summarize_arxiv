    "since the previous erice school on ` string quantum gravity ' a host of impressive developments has taken place on strings in curved spacetime . for the state of the art in 1992 we refer to the 1992 proceedings @xcite where the programme on string quantization in curved spacetimes initiated by us in 1987 @xcite is reviewed .",
    "a consistent quantum theory of gravity is the strongest motivation for string theory and hence to study strings in curved spacetime@xcite . as stressed in the sec . 1 of the 1992 lectures ,",
    "a quantum theory of gravity must be a theory able to describe all physics below the planck scale @xmath6tev .",
    "that means that a sensible theory of quantum gravity is necessarily part of a unified theory of all interactions .",
    "* pure gravity * ( a model containing only gravitons ) can not be a physical and realistic quantum theory .",
    "to give an example , a theoretical prediction for graviton - graviton scattering at energies of the order of @xmath7 must include all particles produced in a real experiment . that is , in practice , all existing particles in nature , since gravity couples to all matter .",
    "string theory is therefore a serious candidate for a quantum description of gravity since it provides a unified model of all interactions overcoming at the same time the nonrenormalizable character of quantum fields theories of gravity .",
    "the present lectures deal mainly with strings in cosmological spacetimes ; substantial results were achieved in this field since 1992 .",
    "the classical behaviour of strings in frw and inflationary spacetimes is now understood in a large extent@xcite .",
    "this understanding followed the finding of various types of exact and numerical string solutions in frw and inflationary spacetimes@xcite -@xcite . for inflationary spacetimes ,",
    "the exact integrability of the string propagation equations plus the string constraints in de sitter spacetime @xcite is indeed an important help .",
    "this allowed to systematically find * exact * string solutions by soliton methods using the linear system associated to the problem ( the so - called dressing method in soliton theory ) and the multistring solutions @xcite -@xcite .    in summary ,",
    "three different types of behaviour are exhibited by the string solutions in cosmological spacetimes : * unstable , dual * to unstable and * stable*. for the unstable strings , the energy and size grow for large scale factors @xmath0 , proportional to @xmath1 . for the dual to unstable strings , the energy and size blow up for @xmath2 as @xmath3 . for stable strings ,",
    "the energy and proper size are bounded .",
    "( in minkowski spacetime , all string solutions are of the stable type ) .",
    "the equation of state for these string behaviours take the form    * \\(i ) * unstable * for @xmath8 * \\(ii ) * dual to unstable * for @xmath9 . *",
    "\\(iii ) * stable * for @xmath10 .    here @xmath11 and @xmath12 stand for the corresponding string energies and @xmath13 for the number of spatial dimensions where the string solutions lives .",
    "for example , @xmath14 for a straight string , @xmath15 for a ring string , etc .",
    "this number @xmath16 is obviously less or equal than the number of spacetime dimensions @xmath17 .",
    "as we see above , the dual to unstable string behavior leads to the same equation of state than radiation ( massless particles or hot matter ) .",
    "the stable string behavior leads to the equation of state of massive particles ( cold matter ) .",
    "the unstable string behavior is a purely ` stringy ' phenomenon .",
    "the fact that in entails a negative pressure is however physically acceptable . for a gas of strings , the unstable string behaviour dominates in inflationary universes when @xmath18 and the dual to unstable string behavior dominates for @xmath19 .",
    "the unstable strings correspond to the critical case of the so called _ coasting universe _ @xcite .",
    "that is , classical strings provide a _",
    "concrete _ realization of such cosmological models .",
    "the ` unstable ' behaviour is called ` string stretching ' in the cosmic string literature @xcite .",
    "it must be stressed that while time evolves , a * given * string solution may exhibit two and even three of the above regimes one after the other ( see sec .",
    "intermediate behaviours are also observed in ring solutions @xcite . that is",
    ", @xmath20    another new feature appeared in curved spacetimes : * multistring solutions*. that is a single world - sheet simultaneously describes many different and independent strings .",
    "this phenomenon has no analogue in flat spacetime .",
    "this is a new feature appearing as a consequence of the interaction of the strings with the spacetime geometry .",
    "the world - sheet time @xmath21 turns out to be an multi - valued function of the target string time @xmath22 ( which can be the cosmic time @xmath23 , the conformal time @xmath24 or for de sitter universes it can be the hyperboloid time @xmath25 ) .",
    "each branch of @xmath21 as a function of @xmath22 corresponds to a different string . in",
    "flat spacetime , multiple string solutions are necessarily described by multiple world - sheets . here",
    ", a single world - sheet describes one string , several strings or even an infinite number of different and independent strings as a consequence of the coupling with the spacetime geometry .",
    "these strings do not interact among themselves ; all the interaction is with the curved spacetime .",
    "one can decide to study separately each of them ( they are all different ) or consider all the infinite strings together .    of course",
    ", from our multistring solution , one _ could _ just choose only one interval in @xmath26 ( or a subset of intervals in @xmath27 ) and describe just one string ( or several ) .",
    "this will be just a * truncation * of the solution .",
    "the really remarkably fact is that all these infinitely many strings come * naturally together * when solving the string equations in de sitter spacetime as we did in refs .",
    "@xcite -@xcite .    here ,",
    "interaction among the strings ( like splitting and merging ) is neglected , the only interaction is with the curved background .",
    "the study of string propagation in curved spacetimes provide essential clues about the physics in this context but is clearly not the end of the story .",
    "the next step beyond the investigation of * test * strings , consist in finding * self - consistently * the geometry from the strings as matter sources for the einstein equations or better the string effective equations ( beta functions ) .",
    "this goal is achieved in ref.@xcite for cosmological spacetimes at the classical level .",
    "namely , we used the energy - momentum tensor for a gas of strings as source for the einstein equations and we solved them self - consistently .    to write the string equation of state we used the behaviour of the string solutions in cosmological spacetimes .",
    "strings continuously evolve from one type of behaviour to another , as is explicitly shown by our solutions @xcite -@xcite . for intermediate values of @xmath28 , the equation of state for gas of free strings is clearly complicated but a formula of the type : @xmath29 where @xmath30 this equation of state is qualitatively correct for all @xmath28 and becomes exact for @xmath19 and @xmath31 . the parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 are positive constants and the @xmath34 varies smoothly with @xmath1 .",
    "the pressure associated to the energy density ( [ rogeni ] ) takes then the form @xmath35    inserting this source into the einstein - friedman equations leads to a self - consistent solution for string dominated universes ( see sec .",
    "iv ) @xcite .",
    "this solution exhibits the realistic matter dominated behaviour @xmath36 for large times and the radiation dominated behaviour @xmath37 for early times .    for the sake of completeness we analyze in sec .",
    "iv the effective string equations @xcite .",
    "these equations have been extensively treated in the literature @xcite and they are not our central aim .    it must be noticed that there is no satisfactory derivation of inflation in the context of the effective string equations .",
    "this does not mean that string theory is not compatible with inflation , but that the effective string action approach _ is not enough _ to describe inflation .",
    "the effective string equations are a low energy field theory approximation to string theory containing only the _ massless _ string modes .",
    "the vacuum energy scales to start inflation are typically of the order of the planck mass where the effective string action approximation breaks down .",
    "one must also consider the _ massive _ string modes ( which are absent from the effective string action ) in order to properly get the cosmological condensate yielding inflation .",
    "de sitter inflation does not emerge as a solution of the the effective string equations .    in conclusion ,",
    "the effective string action ( whatever be the dilaton , its potential and the central charge term ) is not the appropriate framework in which to address the question of string driven inflation .",
    "early cosmology ( at the planck time ) is probably the best place to test string theory . in one hand",
    "the quantum treatment of gravity is unavoidable at such scales and in the other hand , observable cosmological consequences are derivable from the inflationary stage .",
    "the natural gravitational background is an inflationary universe as de sitter spacetime .",
    "such geometries are not string vacua .",
    "this means that conformal and weyl symmetries are broken at the quantum level . in order to quantize consistently strings in such case",
    ", one must enlarge the physical phase space including , in particular , the factor @xmath38 in the world - sheet metric [ see eq.([liou ] ) ] .",
    "this is a very interesting and open problem .",
    "physically , the origin of such difficulties in quantum string cosmology comes from the fact that one is not dealing with an * empty * universe since a cosmological spacetime necessarily contains matter . in the other hand ,",
    "conformal field theory techniques are only adapted to backgrounds for which the beta functions are identically zero , i. e. sourceless geometries .",
    "the outline of these lectures is as follows .",
    "section ii presents an introduction to strings in curved spacetimes including basic notions on classical and quantum strings in minkowski spacetime and introducing the main physical string magnitudes : energy - momentum and invariant string size . section iii deals with the string propagation and the string energy - momentum tensor in cosmological spacetimes .",
    "( in sections iii.a , iii.b and iii.c we treat the straight strings , ring strings and generic strings respectively and derive the corresponding string equations of state ) .",
    "in section iv we treat self - consistent string cosmology including the string equations of state .",
    "( section iv.a deals with general relativity , iv.b with the string thermodynamics ) .",
    "section v discuss the effective ( beta functions ) string equations in the cosmological perspective and the search of inflationary solutions . finally , in sec .",
    "vi , we briefly review the systematic construction of string solutions in de sitter universe _ via _ soliton methods and the new feature of multistring solutions .",
    "let us consider bosonic strings ( open or closed ) propagating in a curved d - dimensional spacetime defined by a metric @xmath39 .",
    "the action can be written as @xmath40 here @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) is the metric in the worldsheet , @xmath43 stands for the string tension . as in flat spacetime , @xmath44 fixes the scale in the theory .",
    "there are no other free parameters like coupling constants in string theory .",
    "we will start considering given gravitational backgrounds @xmath45 .",
    "that is , we start to investigate _ test _ strings propagating on a given spacetime . in section iv , the back reaction problem will be studied .",
    "that is , how the strings may act as source of the geometry .",
    "string propagation in massless backgrounds other than gravitational ( dilaton , antisymmetric tensor ) can be investigated analogously .    the string action ( [ accion ] ) classically enjoys weyl invariance on the world sheet @xmath46 plus the reparametrization invariance @xmath47 here @xmath48 and @xmath49 are arbitrary functions .",

    "notice that these equations in the conformal gauge are still invariant under the conformal reparametrizations : @xmath60 here @xmath61 and @xmath62 are arbitrary functions .",
    "the string boundary conditions in curved spacetimes are identical to those in minkowski spacetime .",
    "that is , @xmath63      in flat spacetime eqs.([conouno ] ) become linear @xmath64 and one can solve them explicitly as well as the quadratic constraint ( [ conodos ] ) [ see below ] : @xmath65 ^ 2 - \\sum_{j=1}^{d-1 } \\left [ \\partial_{\\pm}x^{j}(\\s,\\tau ) \\right]^2 = 0\\ ] ]    the solution of eqs.([dalam ] ) is usually written for closed strings as @xmath66           + \\tilde   \\a^{a}_{n } \\exp[-in(\\s + \\tau ) ] \\ }   \\label{solm}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 and @xmath68 stand for the string center of mass position and momentum and @xmath69 and @xmath70 describe the right and left oscillator modes of the string , respectively .",
    "since the string coordinates are real , @xmath71 this resolution is no more possible in general for curved spacetime where the equations of motion ( [ conouno ] ) are non - linear . in that case ,",
    "right and left movers interact with themselves and with each other .    in minkowski spacetime",
    "we can also write the solution of the string equations of motion ( [ dalam ] ) in the form @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are arbitrary functions . now , making an appropriate conformal transformation ( [ conftr ] ) we can turn any of the string coordinates @xmath75 ( but only one of them ) into a constant times @xmath21 . the most convenient choice is the light - cone gauge where @xmath76 that is , there are no string oscillations along the @xmath77 direction in the light - cone gauge .",

    "eqs.([solm ] ) shows that the string moves as a whole with constant speed while it oscillates around its center of mass .",

    "the string wave function is then the product of a center of mass part times a harmonic oscillator part .",
    "the center of mass can be taken , for example , as a plane wave .",

    "we have then a graviton ( massless spin 2 particle ) and a dilaton ( massless spin 0 particle ) as string modes of excitation . for superstrings the critical dimension turns to be @xmath113 .",
    "we shall consider , as usual , that only four space - time dimensions are uncompactified .",
    "that is , we shall consider the strings as living on the tensor product of a curved four dimensional space - time with lorentzian signature and a compact space which is there to cancel the anomalies .",
    "therefore , from now on strings will propagate in the curved ( physical ) four dimensional space - time .",
    "however , we will find instructive to study the case where this curved space - time has dimensionality @xmath17 , where @xmath17 may be 2 , 3 or arbitrary .      the spacetime string energy - momentum tensor follows ( as usual ) by taking the functional derivative of the action ( [ accion ] ) with respect to the metric @xmath114 at the spacetime point @xmath115 .",

    "each branch of @xmath21 as a function of @xmath23 corresponds to a different string .",
    "this is a entirely new feature for strings in curved spacetime , with no analogue in flat spacetime where the time coordinate can always be chosen proportional to @xmath21 .",
    "in flat spacetime , multiple string solutions are described by multiple world - sheets . here",

    "five is the generic number of strings in our dressed solutions .",
    "the value five can be related to the fact that we are dressing a one - string solution ( @xmath414 ) with _ four _ poles .",

    "for small @xmath289 , @xmath441 has a convoluted shape while for larger @xmath26 ( here @xmath442 ) , it becomes a regular sinusoid .",
    "these behaviours reflect very clearly in the evolution of the spatial coordinates and shape of the string .",
    "the evolution of the five ( and three ) strings simultaneously described by our solution as a function of @xmath23 , for positive @xmath23 is shown in figs .",
    "one string is stable ( the 5th one ) .",

    ", this means that for the strings outside the horizon the sinh - gordon function @xmath377 is the same as the cosmic time @xmath23 up to a function of @xmath206 .",

    "the string inside the horizon ( stable string ) corresponds to the _ maximum _ of the potential , @xmath455 .",
    "@xmath456 is the only value in which the string can stay without being pushed down by the potential to @xmath457 and this also explains why only one stable string appears ( is not possible to put more than one string at the maximum of the potential without falling down ) .",
    "these features are _ generically _ exhibited by our one - soliton multistring solutions , independently of the particular initial state of the string ( fixed by @xmath458 and @xmath426 ) . for particular values of @xmath458 ,",
