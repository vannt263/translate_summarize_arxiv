    "jets are commonly observed in radio galaxies , especially in those with an fr i structure ( fanaroff & riley @xcite ) , where they are detected in more than half of the objects .",

    "hst has made a great impact on these studies , not only by having almost doubled the number of known optical jets ( sparks et al.@xcite ; scarpa & urry @xcite ) , but also because its high spatial resolution , comparable to that of the vla at radio wavelengths , makes a direct comparison possible . before the present study , 14 optical jets were known .",
    "they are present in all kinds of radio source , but show common properties : they originate from bright unresolved optical nuclei ( the one exception is 3c15 ; martel et al .",
    "@xcite ) ; they are smaller and narrower in appearance than their radio counterparts and no counter - jets are observed .",
    "the optically detected jets are longer than expected from their synchrotron cooling times , and there is no indication of strong steepening of the radio - optical spectral index with increasing distance from the nucleus ( sparks et al .",

    "the spectra of the detected optical jets are consistent with radio - to - optical spectral indices @xmath47 with relatively little deviation from power laws ( implying that the doppler shift of the spectrum due to relativistic motion will be a second - order effect ) .",

    "the source that comes closest is b21521 + 28 , for which the expected optical brightness is around 1 @xmath25jy / arcsec@xmath9 , implying that detection might have been possible for a slightly flatter spectral index . these results therefore suggest that it is relatively easy to predict the likelihood of detection of an optical jet once we know the surface brightness of the radio jet",
