    "<S> as an example , the matter radii of unstable neutron - rich nuclei such as ni and even heavier element isotopes are expected to be deduced from future measurements of proton - nucleus elastic differential cross sections that will be performed by using a beam of such nuclei incident on a proton target and detecting scattered protons . </S>",
    "<S> this possibility is supported by our finding based on macroscopic nuclear models , which reasonably reproduce empirical data for masses and radii of stable nuclei and allow for uncertainties in the values of @xmath4 and @xmath0 , that the matter radii calculated for unstable nuclei depend appreciably on @xmath0 , while being almost independent of @xmath4 . however , extraction of the matter radii from experimental data for proton - nucleus elastic differential cross sections and for interaction cross sections is not straightforward in the sense that it requires the approximate scattering theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is thus instructive to examine how the cross sections themselves are related to the parameter @xmath0 in a proper theoretical framework .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we focus on proton - nucleus elastic scattering and , in the optical limit approximation of the glauber multiple scattering model @xcite , obtain its angular distribution from the nucleon distributions in a nucleus calculated in ref .  </S>",

    "<S> we suggest the possibility that comparison of the calculations with experimental data for the peak angle may be useful for determination of @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> we begin with macroscopic nuclear models used in this and a previous work @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite , these models predict that the root - mean - square matter radii depend appreciably on @xmath0 , while being almost independent of @xmath4 . however , there are some limitations in the present macroscopic approach . </S>",

    "<S> second , the nuclear surface is not satisfactory in the present thomas - fermi - type theory , which tends to underestimate the surface diffuseness and does not allow for the tails of the nucleon distributions . </S>",

    "<S> the dependence of the obtained differential cross sections on the eos parameters is not appreciable . </S>",
    "<S> note that the present glauber model is valid for sufficiently large @xmath50 to justify the optical limit approximation and for sufficiently small angles to allow us to ignore the nucleon - nucleon correlations in a nucleus . by comparison with the empirical data </S>",
    "<S> , we may conclude that the glauber model reasonably describes proton - nucleus elastic scattering for high incident energies ( @xmath77 mev ) and for small scattering angles ( @xmath78 deg ) .    </S>",
    "<S> generally @xcite , the peak angles are related to the nuclear radius , while the peak heights are related to the diffuseness of the nuclear surface . our nuclear model , </S>",

    "<S> the angles and heights of the first scattering peak , calculated for 228 sets of @xmath0 and @xmath4 ranging @xmath79 mev and 180 mev @xmath80 mev , are plotted for proton elastic scattering off stable nuclei , @xmath81sn and @xmath71sn , at @xmath72 mev .. ] we first note that the peak angle decreases with @xmath0 . this correlation is larger for larger neutron excess , since the matter radii increase with @xmath82 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> second , we find that the peak height increases with @xmath4 in a way almost independent of neutron excess . </S>",
    "<S> we remark in passing that there is no appreciable correlation between the peak angle and @xmath4 as well as between the peak height and @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this absence of appreciable correlation between the peak angle and @xmath4 is consistent with the fact that within the present glauber model , the fermi - type nucleon distributions derived by ray et al .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , which have larger surface diffuseness than those used in the present calculations while having similar root - mean - square neutron and proton radii , provide the angle of the first scattering peak similar to our results ( see fig .  1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that @xmath4 ( @xmath0 ) induced uncertainties in the peak angle ( height ) are typically @xmath83 deg ( @xmath84 % ) , to which numerical errors due to the monte carlo integration are confined .    </S>",

    "<S> the empirical data for the peak angle and height , also plotted in fig .   </S>",
    "<S> 2 , contain uncertainties in the absolute scattering angle and normalization @xcite , which are here taken to be @xmath86 deg and @xmath87 % , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison between the calculated and experimental results for the peak angles suggests a possible extraction of @xmath0 . since the calculations ignore the pairing and shell effects and the tails of the nucleon distributions , however , the comparison of the absolute values of the peak angles is accompanied by systematic errors . </S>",
    "<S> these errors are expected to be reduced by considering a difference in the peak angle between the @xmath81sn and @xmath71sn cases . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated values of this difference depend on @xmath0 only weakly and are within the uncertainties in the experimental value . </S>",
    "<S> we remark that extraction of @xmath4 from the peak height is difficult , since the present calculations underestimate the surface diffuseness and the values of @xmath67 , which control the peak - to - valley ratios @xcite , have yet to be determined uniquely .    </S>",

    "<S> we turn to unstable nuclei , whose beams incident on proton targets may provide elastic scattering data in future experiments . in order to examine the possibility of extracting @xmath0 from the peak angles for unstable nuclei such as @xmath88ni ( @xmath89 ) </S>",
    "<S> , we repeat the calculations for @xmath85-@xmath69ni and @xmath85-@xmath88ni elastic scattering at @xmath72 mev ; the results for the angles and heights of the first scattering peak are exhibited in fig .  3 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the @xmath0 dependence of the difference in the peak angle between the @xmath69ni and @xmath88ni cases is appreciably large . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 induced change in the angle difference , @xmath90 , amounts to order 0.1 deg . </S>",
    "<S> this is related to the @xmath0 induced change in the matter radius difference , @xmath91 fm @xcite , by the diffraction pattern as @xmath92 . in order to estimate @xmath0 within @xmath93 mev in the present theoretical framework , however , systematic measurements of the peak angles in the small momentum transfer regime for various elements are desired for neutron excesses @xmath47 with accuracy of @xmath940.01 deg .    in such an estimate of @xmath0 , in which we focus on the angle of the first scattering peak , it would be useful to obtain a general relation between the peak angle and the parameters characterizing the adopted nucleon distributions within the glauber model , as obtained by amado et al .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for intermediate momentum transfers and for a fermi distribution . </S>",
    "<S> it is also important to examine the predictability of the peak angle by the present scattering model . </S>",
    "<S> neglect of the spin dependent part of the @xmath62 scattering amplitude and of nucleon correlations , as well as uncertainties in the values of @xmath67 , may affect the prediction of the peak angle and hence the estimate of @xmath0 , although they affect the prediction of the heights of diffraction minima and maxima more remarkably @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we finally consider proton - nucleus total reaction cross sections , which can be calculated from the same glauber model as used for the elastic scattering calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the total reaction cross section can be written as @xmath95 where @xmath96 is given by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ phase ] ) . for neutron - rich stable nuclei such as @xmath73pb and @xmath77 mev </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the total reaction cross section tends to increase with either increasing @xmath0 or decreasing @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> this tendency stems from the fact that the reaction cross section becomes larger for larger diffuseness and radius of the nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> however , we have difficulty in deriving the eos parameters from comparison with the empirical reaction cross sections even if data for unstable nuclei are accumulated . </S>",
    "<S> this is partly because errors in the empirical data @xcite are of order or even larger than the change in the calculated reaction cross sections induced by the uncertainties in @xmath0 and @xmath4 and partly because the surface diffuseness and the tails of the nucleon distributions , which are underestimated and ignored in the present macroscopic nuclear model , affect the prediction of the reaction cross sections .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> by expressing the nucleon distributions in a way dependent on the eos parameters and incorporating such distributions in the glauber model , we calculated differential cross sections for proton - nucleus elastic scattering . at large neutron excess , we found out a large correlation between the peak angle in the small momentum transfer regime and the density symmetry coefficient @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests a possible method to determine @xmath0 from future systematic measurements of proton elastic scattering off unstable nuclei . </S>"
