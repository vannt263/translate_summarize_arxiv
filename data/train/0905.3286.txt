    "we attributed the existence of these inflection points to features of the ldos in the presence of a strong potential gradient near the injection corner of the device . in march 2009 ,",
    "new experiments in a different sample have shown additional features , which require a new interpretation of the earlier data as well as of the new experimental results .",
    "in particular , after modelling the measurement protocol in every detail , we propose a different interpretation of the inflection points shown in ref .",

    "we predict oscillatory shifts of the fermi energy in the two - dimensional electron system due to the presence of a non - zero hall voltage .",
    "the oscillatory shifts are quantitatively calculated in this manuscript and provide a different explanation of the data shown in ref .",
    "we do not rule out the existence of inflection points caused by the ldos in direct - current measurements .",
    "in order to obtain a better signal - to - noise ratio , alternating - current ( ac ) measurements are often preferred to direct - current ( dc ) measurements . while there are different ways to record and process the ac signal , one commonly used protocol is to use a @xmath1-ac wave - form for the current between source and drain of a hall device @xmath2 and to record the hall voltage by integrating the instantaneous hall voltage over one period of the cosine signal . in order to amplify only signals matching the frequency of the current - modulation , the oscillating @xmath1-signal is fed into the integration loop .",

    "the top - gate is kept on a constant potential ( the same potential as one of the ohmic contacts ) , while the voltage of the second ohmic contact is oscillating .",
    "this leads to an oscillating ac current through the device . in the presence of a magnetic field the hall voltage forms across the sample in response to the current .",
    "the hall voltage is also oscillating in phase with the current .",
    "the maximum hall voltage during the oscillation period is given by @xmath5 and yields for @xmath6a at @xmath7  k@xmath8 a peak hall voltage of @xmath9  mv .",
    "the range of variation of the hall voltage is thus @xmath10  mv@xmath11  mv .",

    "the observed inflection points are closer to the values @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , predicted by the ac - model of the top - gate , than to the values @xmath15 and @xmath16 , predicted by the ldos theory .",
    "the overall agreement of the ac averaging model with respect to the width of the hall plateaus and the slope of the hall curve is very good ( see comparison in the appendix ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the gate keeps the two - dimensional fermi - energy fixed , and no assumption of disorder is required to describe the physics of the device and to calculate the hall curves shown in the appendix .",
    "thus we do not rule out the possibility to construct a modified injection model of the qhe , which incorporates the current injection process and the hall field in its foundations .",
