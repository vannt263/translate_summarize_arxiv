    "the aim of this paper is to provide conditions ensuring the existence of @xmath0-periodic solutions to the @xmath0-periodically perturbed system of the form @xmath15 belonging to a given set @xmath16,\\mathbb{r}^n).$ ] here we assume that @xmath17\\to\\mathbb{r}^n{\\rm\\ satisfies\\ carath\\acute{e}odory\\ type\\ conditions,}\\ ] ] i.e. @xmath18 is ( lebesgue ) measurable for each @xmath19 @xmath20 is continuous for almost all ( a.a . ) @xmath21 and , for each @xmath22 there exists @xmath23,\\mathbb{r}_+)$ ] such that @xmath24 for a.a .",

    "any @xmath0-periodic function @xmath29,\\mathbb{r}^n)$ ] is considered as extended from @xmath31 $ ] to @xmath32 by @xmath0-periodicity . moreover , any constant function @xmath29,\\mathbb{r}^n)$ ] is identified with the vector @xmath33 of @xmath34 let @xmath35,\\mathbb{r}^n)\\to c([0,t],\\mathbb{r}^n)$ ] be the integral operator given by @xmath36,\\ \\varepsilon>0,\\ ] ] whose fixed points are @xmath0-periodic solutions to ( [ ps ] ) . in the case",
    "when @xmath37 and @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the brouwer topological degree of @xmath40 in @xmath41 the existence problem of @xmath0-periodic solutions to ( [ ps ] ) has been solved by capietto , mawhin and zanolin in @xcite .",
    "in fact , they proved ( @xcite , corollary 1 ) , that under conditions ( [ mawc1 ] ) and ( [ mawc2 ] ) the following formula holds @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the leray - schauder topological degree of @xmath44 in @xmath14 it follows from ( [ mform ] ) that @xmath45 for any @xmath3 sufficiently small .",
    "therefore under conditions ( [ mawc1 ] ) and ( [ mawc2 ] ) system ( [ ps ] ) has a @xmath0-periodic solution in @xmath6 for any perturbation term @xmath28 and any sufficiently small @xmath46 observe that the assumption ( [ mawc2 ] ) implies that the set @xmath6 contains a constant solution of @xmath47 in @xcite many relevant examples satisfying conditions ( [ mawc1 ] ) and ( [ mawc2 ] ) are provided .",
    "moreover , the authors have focused several results due to i.  berstein and a.  halanay , j.  cronin , a.  lando , e.  muhamadiev and others , which have been generalized or improved .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to provide conditions on the perturbation term @xmath28 in such a way that , for @xmath3 sufficiently small , @xmath48 is defined and different from zero for a wider class of sets @xmath14 indeed , through the paper we will not require ( [ mawc1 ] ) , i.e. we will allow @xmath5 to contain fixed point of @xmath49 under this more general condition , we will establish a formula for @xmath48 that guarantees , under suitable conditions on @xmath28 , that @xmath50 even in the case when @xmath51 precisely , we assume that @xmath52 and for any @xmath53 the linearized system @xmath54 has the characteristic multiplier @xmath55 of multiplicity 1 , i.  e. any @xmath53 is a nondegenerate limit cycle of ( [ np ] ) .",
    "it is clear that , under assumption ( [ c2a ] ) , the topological degree @xmath43 is not necessarily defined .",
    "the approach proposed in this paper to overcome this difficulty consists in introducing the malkin s bifurcation function @xmath56 where @xmath57 is a nontrivial @xmath0-periodic solution of the adjoint system @xmath58 from @xcite ( or @xcite , theorem p.  387 ) we have that if @xmath59 then @xmath60 in this paper we prove in theorem [ thm2 ] that if ( [ maln ] ) is satisfied then , for all @xmath3 sufficiently small , we have @xmath61 where @xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath64 therefore it follows that for any perturbation term @xmath28 satisfying conditions ( [ c2a ] ) , ( [ maln ] ) if @xmath65 then , for any @xmath3 sufficiently small , system ( [ ps ] ) has a @xmath0-periodic solution in @xmath14 observe that if ( [ mawc2 ] ) is not satisfied , but there exist at least one @xmath66 such that @xmath67 then assumption ( [ kmncond ] ) can be fulfilled by a suitable choice of the perturbation term @xmath68 in this sense assumption ( [ kmncond ] ) is weaker than ( [ mawc2 ] ) .    the second term on the right hand side of ( [ kmnformi ] ) is similar to that of the krasnoselskii - zabreyko s formula for computing the index of a degenerate fixed point of @xmath69 by means of a reduction to a subspace ( in our case one - dimensional ) , see ( @xcite , formula 24.13 ) .",
    "however , the related krasnoselskii - zabreyko result ( @xcite , theorem  24.1 ) can be applied only in the case when the operator @xmath69 has a particular form ensuring that @xmath69 has only isolated fixed points .",
    "this is not our case since any @xmath0-periodic cycle of ( [ np ] ) is a non - isolated fixed point of @xmath49    furthermore , observe that the case when @xmath70 is nonempty was already treated in the literature .",
    "for instance , if @xmath71 then any solution of ( [ np ] ) is @xmath0-periodic , @xmath72 and @xmath48 can be evaluated by means of the following formula due to mawhin , see ( @xcite and @xcite ) @xmath73 mawhin proved ( [ mawphd ] ) in the case when @xmath3 is not necessarily small .",
    "the same formula can be also used when @xmath74 but any solution of ( [ np ] ) in @xmath75 is @xmath0-periodic ( see @xcite , formulas 3.1 - 3.3 ) .",
    "this assumption has been considerably weakened by the authors in @xcite for a wide class of sets @xmath14 specifically , in @xcite it was assumed that there exists @xmath76 such that @xmath6 is the set of all continuous functions from @xmath31 $ ] to @xmath77 and any point of @xmath78 is the initial condition of a @xmath0-periodic solution to ( [ np ] ) , namely it was still assumed that @xmath70 is an infinite subset of @xmath5 . for @xmath3 sufficiently small formula ( [ mawphd ] ) was expressed as follows , see also ( @xcite , formula 46 ) , @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the solution of ( [ np ] ) satisfying @xmath81 hence , if @xmath82 then ( [ kmnformi ] ) can be considered as a further development of ( [ mawphd ] ) for the special case when @xmath70 is finite .",
    "in fact , the following formula holds , ( see ( [ gf ] ) in the proof of next theorem [ thm1 ] ) , @xmath83.\\ ] ]    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 is devoted to the proof of formula ( [ kmnformi ] ) and its variants . in section 3 by different choices of the set @xmath6 we obtain several new existence results for @xmath0-periodic solutions to ( [ ps ] ) .",
    "in particular , we generalize or improve some existence results due to loud and malkin proved in @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
