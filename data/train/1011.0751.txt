    "a study of turbulent magnetic fields on the sun through scattering polarization and the hanle effect is one of the major topics of the spws , and there are a number of contributions in this volume which address this topic .",
    "however , as they are devoted to atomic processes , i will try to cover here the key results obtained recently through molecular scattering polarization .",
    "the persistent questions concerning turbulent magnetic fields are ( i ) how strong are they on average , ( ii ) how are they distributed on the sun , and ( iii ) whether they vary with time , e.g. , with the solar cycle .",
    "it appears that the differential hanle effect applied to molecular lines has the greatest potential to answer these questions .",
    "the first clues to puzzling molecular polarization in the second solar spectrum were provided by @xcite .",
    "even though in that work we did not discuss the effect of upper level lifetimes on the sensitivity to the hanle effect , as was pointed out by @xcite and @xcite , it appeared that the majority of lines within the same molecular band have similar lifetimes @xcite , so this argument does not really clarify the question of why molecular polarization appeared nonvariable .",

    "most results so far were obtained assuming an isotropic distribution , which provides a simple analytical tool to infer the field strength @xcite . when this is applied to lines with similar thermodynamical properties but with different magnetic sensitivities , the differential hanle effect provides the most model independent field strength . at the spw3",
    "@xcite argued that the observed difference in scattering amplitudes within partly resolved triplets of c@xmath1 transitions ( such as the p - triplet at 5141  in fig .",
    "[ fig : c2 ] ) in the second solar spectrum are due to the hanle effect .",

    "these issues are not still clear and need further investigation . however",
    ", to summarize , it appears that many studies of the hanle effect in molecular lines deduce a relatively low turbulent magnetic field strengths of 530 g @xcite , which may be an indication for a depth - dependent effect .",
    "it is clear however , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : c2 ] , that the field strength in the lower atmosphere can not exceed a few tens of gauss , in contrast to conclusions by , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "in such a situation the second and the third questions can not be answered without a systematic and homogeneous study .",
    "that is why we have initiated a synoptic program at irsol for measuring during several years ( hopefully through at least one solar cycle ) the scattering polarization in the c@xmath1 triplet and a few atomic lines .",
    "the results for the first two years covering the solar minimum in 20082009 were reported by @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : syn ] illustrates that turbulent fields were evenly distributed over the sun during this solar minimum .",
    "the field strength was on average at least 4.7@xmath20.2 g ( without collisions taken into account ) or 7.41@xmath20.09 g ( with collisions and a nlte analysis ) .",
    "it did not vary during the last two years , but there could be a very small variation of the turbulent field strength ( 3@xmath3-limit ) since the solar maximum in 2000 ( based on data of * ? ? ?",
    "this result is however very sensitive to the available statistics , so we need to continue the synoptic program to clarify whether turbulent magnetic fields are generated by a global dynamo responsible for the solar cycle or a local dynamo which may not vary at all on the cycle time scale .",
    "it is worth to mention that such a program would be a rather minor expense for large solar telescopes such as atst ( see * ? ? ?",
    "sunspots are the primary evidence of solar activity , and they harbour the strongest field and the coldest plasma on the solar surface . such a phenomenon is common among stars possessing convective envelopes , where magnetic fields are believed to be generated @xcite . however , magnetic fields were never measured inside starspots , and their internal structure remained unknown ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . studying",
    "this phenomenon is especially interesting for cool dwarfs , which are known to show strong magnetic activity and whose dynamo is apparently different from that of more massive cool stars , such as the sun .",
    "the process of generation of strong magnetic fields in objects with very deep convection zones or even fully convective is not yet understood .",
    "we have developed a unique approach to probe their atmospheres and magnetospheres with polarimetry and reveal a 3d structure of starspots .",
    "the prospects of molecular spectropolarimetry for exploring magnetic interiors of starspots were foreseen by @xcite , but adequate observational facilities were not available at that time . once the high - resolution spectropolarimeter espadons @xcite became available at the cfht , our team obtained first polarimetric measurements of starspots on m and k dwarfs .",
    "we have detected circular polarization in many lines , including the first detection of polarization in tio , cah , and feh transitions of 0.51% with the noise level of 0.1% @xcite and in chromospheric emission lines @xcite .",
    "here we summarize first results inferred from these data ( in prep . ) for an active red dwarf au  mic , m1ve , which is the brightest x - ray source among such stars .",

    "fig : aumic_atoms ] &  [ fig : aumic_molec ] ) .",
    "these lines cover a wide range of temperature and magnetic sensitivity and also effectively form at different heights and locations in the stellar atmosphere .",
    "this provides a unique opportunity for probing directly the interior of starspots , basically independent on the distance to the star or its size , i.e.  clearly beyond current direct spatial resolution on stellar surfaces . since the observations of au mic were obtained during two consecutive nights , which roughly covers half the stellar rotation period , we can only analyse spots visible during that time .",
    "we applied our new zeeman - doppler imaging ( zdi ) inversion technique @xcite and stokes parameter synthesis @xcite to individual species forming at different heights in the range of 60210 km above the photosphere . due to lack of spatial information in the line profiles (",
    "because of the slow stellar rotation , @xmath5=10 km / s ) , shapes of spots remained uncertain and for simplicity were initially assumed to be circular and homogeneous , which was subsequently refined by inversions until the best fit to the data was achieved .",

    "this is similar to the sun but in contrast to rapidly - rotating active stars where coriolis force brings spots closer to the rotational axis , i.e. poles . even though the spot shapes are unknown , their area and longitudes are well constrained by the data .",
    "we identify four spots , one of positive and three of negative polarity ( fig .",

    "the magnetic field strength ( modulus ) in spots reaches more than 5 kg , which is much stronger than the equipartition level .",

    "the gradient @xmath9@xmath710gkm@xmath8 is an order of the magnitude larger than that in sunspots . to exclude the influence of the density scale height",
    ", we consider the gradient @xmath10 , which is about 2gk@xmath8 in au  mic spots and about 1gk@xmath8 in sunspots , and they are both significantly larger than the adiabatic gradient .",
    "it appears that this difference occurs due to decoupling of the magnetic field from the ambient gas , whose ionization degree is much lower on au  mic than on the sun .",
    "this goes well along with the fact that the spot area on au  mic increases with height , i.e.  the field fans out and is loosely confined by the gas .",
    "we find also evidence for the second magnetic component in the au  mic atmosphere : a mix - polarity field of 3.5@xmath20.5 kg covering about half of the photosphere outside cool spots .",
    "this field is apparently confined to the lower photosphere or perhaps weakens with height .",
    "it appears analogous to a solar network magnetic field .",

    "this result clarifies high magnetic filling factors deduced from measurements of zeeman - broadened profiles , including feh , in active m dwarfs @xcite . with our advanced quantum - mechanical modeling of feh transitions ,",
    "the accuracy and reliability of such measurements has significantly improved @xcite .",
    "less active targets show however polarization signals significantly smaller than 1% , while current observational facilities limit the accuracy per wavelength to 0.1% .",
    "therefore , for such targets it is not possible to detect signals in individual lines , and multi - line techniques such as lsd @xcite are commonly used to increase the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) .",
    "however , limitations of the lsd are now well recognized ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and new techniques emerge to advance our ability to measure and interpret stokes profiles , such as pca @xcite , ndd @xcite , and zcd @xcite .",
    "the latter two are particularly powerful as they take into account nonlinear effects in blending spectral lines and their zeeman components for both atomic and molecular transitions . at the moment",
    "the zcd is the most sensitive technique for detecting very weak magnetic fields , such as about 0.5 g on the k giant arcturus @xcite .",
    "when combined with the zdi , it will open new opportunities to explore magnetic spots in many objects across the hr - diagram .",
    "applications of molecular spectropolarimetry extend even to cool white dwarfs ( wds ) , where this technique is the only hope to clarify the frequency of magnetic objects and learn about their evolution . for instance , a small group of cool , helium - rich wds ( dq type , t@xmath117000k ) show only carbon - based molecular bands , mainly c@xmath1 bands ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which are therefore the only indicators of their magnetic fields .",
    "it is believed that the majority of these stars are not magnetic , since no polarization was reported in c@xmath1 until now . however , a famous representative of this group , g99 - 37 , for more than four decades having been a unique wd with both ch and c@xmath1 molecular bands , is clearly magnetic , as indicated by prominent broad - band polarization in the ch bands discovered by @xcite .",
    "this is due to magnetic dichroism appearing in molecular bands in the presence of a strong magnetic field , which perturbs the internal structure of the molecule and results in net polarization due to the paschen - back effect ( pbe ) .",
