    "rf information and energy transfer , which treats wireless receivers as either conventional information decoding ( i d ) receivers or energy harvesting ( eh ) receivers , has emerged as an attractive paradigm for green communication in the next - generation wireless networks @xcite . in particular , transmit beamforming to improve the quality - of - service of rf information and energy transfer has drawn significant research interest @xcite .",
    "there are two important beamforming problems in optimizing the harvested energy : ( i ) maximization of the total harvested energy ( i.e. , ` sum eh maximization problem ' ) , and ( ii ) maximization of the most disadvantaged eh receiver in the network ( i.e. , ` max - min eh problem ' ) .",
    "both problems are subject to the minimum sinr constraint at the i d receivers and the total transmit power constraint at the base station ( bs ) .",
    "they are indefinite quadratic programs in the beamforming vectors , which are typically recast as nonconvex rank - one matrix constrained semidefinite programs ( sdps ) in the beamforming outer products .",
    "the rank - one matrix constraints are then omitted , allowing for suboptimal sdp relaxation @xcite .    meanwhile , it is realistic for the users located in the vicinity of the bs to conduct both i d and eh functions by a signal splitting ( ss ) based receiver @xcite .",
    "a problem of particular interest is how to jointly design the transmit beamforming vectors and the receive ss ratios in order to maximize the harvested energy .",
    "finding an efficient computational solution for this problem is a major challenge in itself . due to the strong coupling of the beamforming vectors and the ss ratios in the optimization objective , the sum eh maximization problem can not be recast as a matrix rank - one constrained sdp to accommodate the conventional sdp relaxation approach @xcite . for the max - min eh problem",
    ", the beamforming vectors and ss ratios can be decoupled via a bisection search for the worst eh receiver .",
    "nevertheless , the resultant sdp relaxation only provides an upper bound performance for this problem as this approach is less likely to generate a rank - one matrix solution .",
    "randomization in conjunction with linear programming must be further employed to generate the beamforming vectors , which however could be far away from the actual optimal solutions @xcite .",
    "this letter aims to develop an efficient computational method for the two aforementioned joint design eh optimization problems .",
    "our research contributions are summarized as follows .    * we propose a new path - following method for their solutions .",
    "each iteration of the proposed algorithms requires solving a second - order cone program ( socp ) in the beamforming vectors and ss ratios .",
    "we mathematically show that the algorithms progress at every iteration and converge to locally optimal solutions .",
    "in addition , our simulation results with practical parameter values show that the obtained locally optimal solutions are the same as the upper bound given by the exhaustive search over the domain of ss ratios ( for the sum eh maximization problem ) or that by the sdp relaxation - based bisection search ( for the max - min eh problem ) .",
    "this demonstrates the usefulness of our solutions .",
    "* our algorithms are computationally efficient and simple to implement .",
    "in contrast , the exhaustive search and the sdp relaxation - based bisection search can only achieve the upper bounds after solving many sdps in the beamforming outer products of a substantially increased dimension .",
    "such techniques are computationally prohibitive in practical networks .",
    "we consider an energy - constrained small - cell wireless network where a bs with @xmath0 antennas transmits to @xmath1 single - antenna users ( ues ) .",
    "let @xmath2 be the flat fading channel vector between the bs and ue @xmath3 , which includes the effects of large - scale pathloss and small - scale fading .",
    "let @xmath4 ( with @xmath5 ) denote the intended message for ue @xmath6 , which is beamformed by the vector @xmath7 at the bs .",
    "the baseband signal received by ue @xmath6 is expressed as : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the zero - mean circularly symmetric additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) with variance @xmath10 introduced by the receive antenna .",
    "we assume perfect channel state information ( csi ) is available at the bs , where details of the csi acquisition process can be found in @xcite .",
    "the first term in is the intended signal for ue @xmath6 while the second term represents the interference .    given that rf eh is only practical when the bs - ue distance is sufficiently small @xcite , our model divides the bs coverage area into ( i ) the eh zone ( near the bs ) , and ( ii ) the i d zone ( outside the eh zone ) .",
    "if a ue resides inside the eh zone , it can conduct both eh and i d ; otherwise , it only performs i d .",
    "assume there are @xmath11 and @xmath12 ues residing in the eh and i d zones , respectively , where @xmath13 .",
    "let us index the eh - id ues by @xmath14 and the id - only ues by @xmath15 .    at an eh - id ue @xmath16",
    ", the signal splitter divides the received signal @xmath17 into two parts in the proportion of @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is termed as the ss ratio for ue @xmath20 .",
    "the first part @xmath21 forms an input to the i d receiver as : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the additional noise with variance @xmath24 introduced by the i d receiver circuitry . from",
    ", we write the general expression of the sinr at the input of the i d receiver of ue @xmath25 ( i.e. , either an eh - id ue or an id - only ue ) as : @xmath26 where @xmath27_{n\\in { \\cal n}}$ ] and @xmath28 with @xmath29 for @xmath30 and @xmath31 for @xmath32 .    also at the eh - id ue @xmath16",
    ", the second part @xmath33 of the received signal @xmath17 is processed by an eh receiver .",
    "the energy harvested by ue @xmath20 is thus given by : @xmath34 where @xmath35 , and the constant @xmath36 denotes the efficiency of energy conversion at the eh receiver . upon defining @xmath37_{n_1\\in\\mathcal{n}_1}$ ] , the sum eh maximization problem is formulated as :    [ eq : p1 ] @xmath38    constraint caps the total transmit power at a predefined value @xmath39 , and constraint ensures that the received sinr by ue @xmath6 be greater than a predefined threshold @xmath40 .",

    "the multiplicative objective function in ( [ sdp1a ] ) remains nonlinear nonconcave in @xmath50 and @xmath51 , making ( [ sdp1 ] ) still computationally difficult . in the following section , we propose an efficient path - following method to solve directly in the beamforming vectors @xmath52 and the scalar ss ratios @xmath53",
