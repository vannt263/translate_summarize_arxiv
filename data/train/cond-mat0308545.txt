    "the problem of field - induced magnon condensation in gapped quantum antiferromagnets is currently receiving a great deal of attention from experimentalists . particularly important results were obtained in recent neutron scattering and esr measurements on @xmath5 haldane - gap@xcite compounds ni(c@xmath2h@xmath7n@xmath2)@xmath2no@xmath2(clo@xmath8)(nenp),@xcite ni(c@xmath0d@xmath1n@xmath2)@xmath2n@xmath3(pf@xmath4 )  ( ndmap ) @xcite and ni(c@xmath0h@xmath1n@xmath2)@xmath2n@xmath3(clo@xmath8 )  ( ndmaz),@xcite as well as the @xmath9-dimer system tlcucl@xmath3.@xcite the effect of magnetic field is to drive the gap @xmath10 in such systems to zero by virtue of zeeman effect , thus promoting a quantum phase transition to a new magnetized state at some critical value of the applied field @xmath11.@xcite additional magnetic anisotropy effects usually lead to more complex behavior and richer phase diagram .",
    "anisotropy is negligible in many @xmath9-based materials such as tlcucl@xmath3 , where no single - ion terms are possible .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath5 compounds such as nenp , ndmap and ndmaz , terms of type @xmath12 are quite strong and the corresponding zero - field anisotropy splitting of the excitation triplet is comparable in magnitude to the haldane gap itself . under these circumstances ,",
    "the physics is expected to depend strongly on the direction of the applied magnetic field with respect to the anisotropy axes.@xcite    for purely technical reasons , in quasi-1d materials it is much easier to perform inelastic neutron scattering experiments in high magnetic fields applied _ perpendicular _ to the spin chains . on most instruments the scattering plane is horizontal and the wave vector resolution along the vertical axis is deliberately coarsened to provide an intensity gain . to optimize wave vector resolution along the spin chains in the sample , and to allow the momentum transfer @xmath13 in that direction , the chain axis has to be mounted in the horizontal plane .",
    "the typical construction of superconducting magnets is such that the field is along the vertical direction , and is thus applied perpendicular to the spin chains in the sample . in the haldane - gap materials nenp , ndmap and ndmaz the anisotropy easy plane is roughly perpendicular the chains . as a result ,",
    "most of the previous neutron measurements were performed for _ in - plane _ magnetic fields , i.e. , in the axially asymmetric ( aa ) geometry . in the aa case",
    "the transition at @xmath14 is expected to be of ising type,@xcite and even an isolated chain acquires antiferromagnetic long - range order in the ground state at @xmath15 .",
    "the excitations in the magnetized state are a triplet of massive `` breathers '' ( soliton - antisoliton bound states).@xcite recent neutron scattering studies of ndmap in the aa geometry provided a solid confirmation of these theoretical predictions.@xcite    for an isolated haldane spin chain magnetized in the axially symmetric ( as ) geometry ( with a magnetic field applied parallel to the anisotropy axis and the anisotropy being of a purely easy - plane type ) theory predicts a totally different , disordered and quantum - critical ground state whose low - energy physics can be described as the tomonaga - luttinger spin liquid.@xcite the low - energy excitation spectrum contains no sharp modes and is instead a continuum of states , much as for @xmath9 spin chains.@xcite higher modes which would have quasiparticle character in the aa geometry ( two upper members of the zeeman - split triplet ) also develop into continua and exhibit only edge - type singularities in the as case.@xcite moreover , one expects incommensurate correlations at a field - dependent fermi wave vector that characterizes the fermi sea of magnons `` condensed '' at @xmath15.@xcite in a real material this idealized picture may be complicated by several factors .",
    "first of all , there can be additional anisotropy terms , such as in - plane single - ion anisotropy or dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions , which _ explicitly _ break the axial symmetry and favor the aa physics ; a similar effect could be expected if the direction of the applied field deviates slightly from the symmetry axis .",
    "residual three - dimensional inter - chain couplings lead to a _ spontaneous _ breaking of the axial symmetry which is equivalent to the bose - einstein condensation of magnons.@xcite due to the critical nature of the ground state of an isolated chain , all these effects are relevant and will have a significant impact on the spin correlations , no matter how small they may be .",
    "the key to understanding the high - field behavior in real materials is a combined approach involving high resolution neutron scattering experiments and a consistent theoretical treatment . due to geometrical constraints described in the previous paragraph , high - field neutron measurements in the as configuration are technically challenging and require the use of specialized neutron instruments or magnet environments .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is twofold : on one hand , to study experimentally the response of the ndmap system in the wide range of applied fields and at very low temperature , in the setup as close to the as geometry as possible , and to test further the phenomenological field theory of the high - field phase which was recently proposed @xcite and successfully applied to the description of experiments on ndmap in the aa geometry .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , we also give a more detailed account of the theory which was only briefly outlined in ref .",

    "the latter implies that the model should account for both neutron and esr measurements,@xcite work both above and below the critical field , and apply in the case of arbitrary field orientation .        in the early 90s , several phenomenological field - theoretical descriptions of the high - field regime in the anisotropic haldane chain",
    "were proposed.@xcite affleck @xcite proposed a theory based on coarse - graining the @xmath86 nonlinear sigma model ( nlsm).@xcite technically coarse - graining leads to relaxing the unit vector constraint of the nlsm , so that one has a theory of unconstrained real vector bosonic field @xmath87 .",

    "this model captures the basic physics involved , but is known to suffer from several drawbacks . because of the too simplistic way of introducing the anisotropy , the predicted values of the critical field ( @xmath94 for the field @xmath95 directed along one of the symmetry axes @xmath96 ) disagree with the results of perturbative treatment @xcite as well as with the experimental data on the behavior of gaps as functions of the applied field in nenp @xcite and ndmap.@xcite    tsvelik @xcite proposed a different theory which stems from the integrable takhtajan - babujian model of a @xmath5 chain and involves three majorana fields with masses @xmath89 .",

    "however , when the high - field neutron data on ndmap in the @xmath82 geometry became available , @xcite it turned out that tsvelik s theory , apart from overestimating the @xmath98 value considerably , predicts no change of slope for the two upper magnon modes at @xmath100 , in complete disagreement with the experimental data .",
    "one may conclude that though this model correctly describes the behavior of the low - energy degrees of freedom near the critical field , but fails to describe the behavior of high - energy modes above @xmath98 .",
    "mitra and halperin @xcite have modified affleck s bosonic lagrangian in order to reproduce tsvelik s results for the gaps .",
    "it turns out that changing the first term in ( [ lag : affleck ] ) to @xmath101 exactly reproduces the results of ref .   for the field dependencies of the gaps _ below _",
    "above @xmath14 , the predicted field behavior of the gaps is different from that of ref . , and is in a reasonable qualitative agreement with the experimental data on ndmap in the @xmath82 geometry.@xcite however , apart from the fact that the reasons for the postulated modification ( [ lag : mitra ] ) remain unclear , the theory still has one fundamental flaw : it predicts that the staggered moment at @xmath91 is directed along _ the magnetic hard axis @xmath17 _ for @xmath82 and along the intermediate axis @xmath23 for @xmath53 .",
    "this result is not only counter - intuitive but also contradicts to the diffraction experiments on ndmap @xcite which show that the ordered moment , in complete analogy to the classical picture for an ordered antiferromagnet , always lies in the easy plane along the most easy axis perpendicular to the field , i.e. , along the @xmath23 axis for @xmath82 and along the @xmath25 axis in the @xmath53 case .",

    "this model was recently applied with great success to the description of the ins data for ndmap in the @xmath82 geometry,@xcite and to esr experiments in both geometries.@xcite    we first illustrate the general features of the theory on the example of the alternated @xmath9 chain consisting of weakly coupled anisotropic dimers , described by the hamiltonian @xmath103 where @xmath104 . throughout the rest of this section",
    ", it is implied that the magnetic field is measured in energy units , i.e. , @xmath105 unless explicitly stated otherwise . for the derivation of the effective field theory it is convenient to use the dimer coherent states @xcite @xmath106 where the singlet state @xmath107 and three triplet states @xmath108 are given by @xcite @xmath109 and @xmath110 , @xmath111",

    "the spatial derivatives of @xmath111 are omitted in ( [ leff - anis ] ) because they appear only in terms which are of the fourth order in @xmath110 , @xmath111 .",

    "having in mind that the alternated @xmath133 chain and the haldane chain belong to the same universality class , one may now try to apply this model in the form ( [ leff - anis - a]-[u2-a ] ) to the haldane chain system such as ndmap , treating the velocities @xmath134 and interaction constants @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 , and @xmath138 as phenomenological parameters .",

    "it is straightforward to incorporate this effect into our formalism .",

    "the value of the critical field @xmath186 for a field applied along the principal anisotropy axis @xmath187 determines another three relations between parameters , namely @xmath188 .",

    "in fact , the gaps depend only on the relative interaction strengths @xmath190 , @xmath191 , so that the scale of @xmath137 does not influence the expressions for the gaps and can be set deliberately ( we have put @xmath192 ) . thus , the knowledge of the @xmath52 gaps and of critical fields helps to fix five parameters , and one parameter turns out to be irrelevant , so that one is left with only three parameters to fit the @xmath193 curves .    in analyzing the measured field dependencies of the gap energies in ndmap",

    "note that the fitted critical fields @xmath213  t and @xmath214  t are some 15% smaller than observed in our neutron scattering experiments .",
    "incidentally , these critical fields are in excellent agreement with those found in heat capacity@xcite esr measurements.@xcite the parameter values obtained in the present neutron study also agree nicely with those determined in the analysis of esr resonance frequencies . finally , we have verified and would like to stress that the obtained parameter values yield _ correct _ directions of the ordered staggered moment at @xmath15 for both @xmath53 and @xmath82 experimental geometries : namely , the order parameter @xmath215 is directed along the @xmath23 and @xmath25 axes in the @xmath82 and @xmath53 cases , respectively .",

    "this is accompanied by a re - opening of the gap at @xmath15 .",
    "overall , the observed field dependence of the excitation spectrum is qualitatively similar to that previously seen for @xmath216.@xcite the reasons for the luttinger spin liquid regime being unobservable are quite clear : the idealized axially symmetric geometry can not be realized in ndmap .",
    "this , to our opinion , may be mainly attributed to the effects of the 16@xmath203 canting of the principal anisotropy axes relative to the field direction , which define the strongest explicit breaking of the axial symmetry , although in - plane anisotropy and inter - chain interactions play a significant role as well . perhaps in very strong external fields , when the zeeman energy becomes large compared to any anisotropy and 3d effects , certain features of the luttinger spin liquid may become accessible .",
    "in particular , it has been recently argued@xcite that incommensurate correlation should emerge even in the axially asymmetric geometry , above a certain second critical field @xmath217 . whether or not such an experiment is technically feasible for ndmap is currently unclear .    in summary ,",
    "the main impact of the present @xmath53 measurements is to provide crucial quantitative data needed to evaluate the veracity of the various field - theoretical descriptions of magnetized anisotropic haldane spin chains .",
