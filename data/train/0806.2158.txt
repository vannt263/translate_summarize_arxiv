    "the effects of extinction ( column density along the line of sight ) are not as important in determining the observed irac colours of smgs , unlike the case at shorter , optical wavelengths .",
    "the model colour tracks for two different visual extinctions ( @xmath23 and 200 ) shown in figures  [ fig : colourcolourplot]d & [ fig : colourcolourplot2]d track each other closely at @xmath24 , despite the large opacity difference between the two models .",
    "optical depth is greatly reduced at these long wavelengths ( @xmath25 for the irac bands ; see * ? ? ?",

    "the irac bands begin to probe the near - ir to optical bands , and an increasing dependence on extinction is expected .",

    "overall , extinction still plays a minor role compared with starburst age , and we identify starburst age and redshift as the dominant physical parameters that affect the observed irac colours . accounting for smgs with the reddest observed colours ( e.g. , log(@xmath13)@xmath280.3 , log(@xmath14)@xmath280.3 ) requires young ( @xmath29 myr old ) starbursts at high redshifts ( @xmath30 ) or a power - law agn dominating the rest - frame near - ir sed .",

    "the incursion of m82-like objects into the agn boundary has lead @xcite to refine the selection boundary , and @xcite question the completeness and reliability of agn identification using irac colours for a similar reason . using theoretical and empirical starburst sed models",
    ", we demonstrate that young , dusty starbursts exhibit red irac colours , and red irac colour is _ not _ unique to power - law agns .",
    "the popular agn identification methods using red irac colours , such as by @xcite and @xcite , should be used with caution and a clear understanding of this important caveat .",
    "both smgs and agns appear within the broadly defined red irac colour regions by lacy et al . and stern et al . , but smgs and agns are distinguished by clear systematic difference in their mean irac colours .",

    "the ulirg arp  220 sed redshift to @xmath36 offers a far better match to the smgs , lending further support for the dust obscured starburst interpretation .",
    "furthermore , the flatter spectral slope ( bluer irac colours ) suggests that smgs in general do not host a dust - obscured , energetically dominant agn in most cases .",
    "we note that rigorous diagnostics of an agn include the detection of high - ionization , high - excitation emission lines and copious amounts of hard x - ray emission , and an ir power - law spectrum is only indirect evidence for the presence of an agn , and does not directly measure the agn accretion power .",
    "the distinct difference in the observed seds between agns and smgs also offers an important constraint on the possible smg - qso evolutionary scenario . the apparent correlation observed between the black hole mass ( @xmath37 ) and the host spheroid mass ( velocity dispersion @xmath38 ;",

    "the new knowledge obtained from figures  [ fig : colourcolourplot ]  &  [ fig : colourcolourplot2 ] that smgs as a population have red ir colours , similar to agns and distinct from the foreground field population , offers the exciting possibility of identifying or significantly narrowing down the counterpart candidates using the irac data alone .      to evaluate the utility of these new irac colour selection criteria for the smg counterpart candidate selection , we examine the colours of the irac sources in the fields surrounding the nine smgs securely identified through submm interferometric imaging @xcite . the 20  @xmath46 20  irac 3.6  images ( not shown ) centered on the original submillimetre source",

    "these smgs were not used in defining the irac colour selection criteria and they thus represent an independent and successful test of our method .",
    "the remaining irac sources have colours consistent with the background sources , and about 1/2 of them fall within the new smg candidate identification boundaries .",
    "the new colour selection technique does not completely resolve the confusion problem .",
    "however , the situation is now greatly improved , as the candidate counterparts are reduced to a single unique candidate or two potential candidates , making expensive follow - up observations more efficient .",
    "other identification methods such as deep radio or mips 24  imaging do not greatly improve the situation in these test cases since many of these smgs are undetected at other wavelengths .",

    "argued that 8.0  selection offers a better means for identifying smg counterparts than near - ir or optical selection .",
    "their 8.0  selection resulted in a different counterpart from the optical or @xmath48-band selection methods in ten out of 17 cases , casting some doubt on the earlier identifications of smgs .",

    "high - redshift submillimetre - bright galaxies identified by blank field surveys at millimetre and submillimetre wavelengths appear in the region of the irac colour  colour diagrams previously identified as the domain of luminous agns by @xcite and @xcite . rather than interpreting this as a sign that the majority of the smgs are powered by a luminous agn",

    "<S> high - redshift submillimetre - bright galaxies identified by blank field surveys at millimetre and submillimetre wavelengths appear in the region of the irac colour  colour diagrams previously identified as the domain of luminous active galactic nuclei ( agns ) . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis using a set of empirical and theoretical dusty starburst spectral energy distribution ( sed ) models shows that power - law continuum sources associated with hot dust heated by young ( @xmath0 myr old ) , extreme starbursts at @xmath1 also occupy the same general area as agns in the irac colour  colour plots . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed comparison of the irac colours and seds demonstrates that the two populations are distinct from each other , with submillimetre - bright galaxies having a systematically flatter irac spectrum ( @xmath2 mag bluer in the observed [ 4.5][8.0 ] colour ) . </S>",
    "<S> only about 20% of the objects overlap in the colour  colour plots , and this low fraction suggests that submillimetre galaxies powered by a dust - obscured agn are not common . </S>",
    "<S> the red ir colours of the submillimetre galaxies are distinct from those of the ubiquitous foreground irac sources , and we propose a set of ir colour selection criteria for identifying smg counterparts that can be used even in the absence of radio or _ _ </S>",
