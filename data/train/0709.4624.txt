    "since the discovery of neutrino masses it is known that lepton flavour is not conserved . however , from non - observation of lfv processes such as @xmath1 we know that those interactions have to be highly suppressed .",
    "extensions of the standard model that implement lfv should keep such processes automatically small and allow for new - physics particles with moderate masses . in the quark sector , these issues can nicely be accommodated with the minimal flavour violation ( mfv ) hypothesis @xcite .",
    "analogously to the quark sector , minimal lepton flavour violation ( mlfv ) can be formulated as an effective field theory in which the lepton yukawa couplings are the only sources of flavour violation @xcite . in order to additionally explain the smallness of neutrino masses with the help of the see - saw mechanism and estabishing the requirements for leptogenesis ,",
    "the mfv hypothesis in the lepton sector includes also lepton number violation at some high scale . avoiding additional flavour violation ,",
    "the three heavy right - handed majorana neutrinos introduced are degenerate in mass .",
    "since radiative corrections spoil the degeneracy of the majorana masses @xcite , it is appropriate to combine the mlfv hypothesis with a choice of a scale at which the majorana masses are exactly degenerate @xcite .",
    "a natural choice for the degeneracy scale is the gut scale .",
    "then the mass splittings of the majorana neutrinos at the majorana scale required for resonant leptogenesis @xcite are induced radiatively .",
    "this mechanism to obtain the bau is called radiative resonant leptogenesis ( rrl ) @xcite .",
    "considering first the case with cp violation in the neutrino yukawa couplings present at high and low energies the situation is as follows @xcite :    * the baryon asymmetry of the universe can be generated of the right order of magnitude with rrl independent of the majorana scale .",
    "the inclusion of flavour effects @xcite in the boltzmann equations below a certain majorana scale is relevant .",
    "* correlations between the generation of the bau and lfv decays such as @xmath1 or ratios of such processes are very weak .",
    "therefore mlfv is not as predictive as the corresponding framework in the quark sector . *",
    "a flavour specific treatment allows for successful leptogenesis in the special case of no high - energy cp violation which is in accordance with the findings of @xcite .",
    "the bau versus the majorana scale up to @xmath2 gev in the case of exclusively low - energy cp violation present @xcite .",
    "the _ black points _ correspond to the three - flavour estimate , the _ light - blue points _ to the single - flavour solution @xcite .",
    "the two black lines mark where the bau is of the right order of magnitude.,width=298 ]    we study then the implications of a successful leptogenesis in the case of exclusively low - energy cp violation with the pmns matrix being the only source of cp violation ( the @xmath0 matrix in @xmath3 of the casas - ibarra parametrization @xcite is real ) , which can be obtained provided flavour effects are taken into account ( @xmath4 gev ) @xcite .",
    "we find that the right amount of the baryon asymmetry of the universe can be generated in the flavour sensitive regime ( see figure [ fig : baulow ] ) under the following conditions @xcite :    * the light neutrino masses have a normal hierarchy , * there is at least one non - vanishing majorana phase , * @xmath5 , * @xmath6 ev .",
    "if these constraints are fulfilled , we find strong correlations among ratios of charged lfv processes .",
    "for example the ratio of @xmath7 which varies over many orders of magnitude when high - energy cp violation is present , is found then to be clearly below one ( see figure [ fig : r ] ) . + therefore the specific case of exclusively low - energy cp violation turns out to be much more predictive than the general one and offers constraints that are testable in low - energy experiments .     versus @xmath8 for the general analysis @xcite including high - energy cp violation ( left plot ) and with exclusively high - energy cp violation ( right plot ) @xcite where r is clearly below 1 .",
