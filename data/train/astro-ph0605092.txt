    "the linear polarization vectors , perpendicular to the jet axis , indicate that we are tracing a confining toroidal magnetic field .",
    "a toroidal field depends on distance from the star @xmath9 as @xmath10 and we thus find that at the surface of the star , the magnetic field strength is between @xmath11-@xmath12  g. as shown in fig .",

    "considering the shape and strength of the magnetic field in the jet of w43a , we conclude that the magnetic field is the primary collimating agent , making this the first direct detection of magnetic collimation in any astrophysical jet ."
