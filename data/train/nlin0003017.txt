    "in the theory of nonlinear systems , the logistic map @xmath0 with @xmath1 , @xmath2 $ ] , and @xmath3 , is well - known to provide one of the simplest example of what is referred to as a _ chaotic _ system . that is , a system which , for some range of its parameters , possesses at least one bounded orbit @xmath4 such that ( i ) @xmath5 is not asymptotically periodic and ( ii ) the lyapunov exponent , defined in the context of eq.([log ] ) by the usual relation @xmath6 is greater than zero @xcite . for the logistic map at @xmath7 , specifically , @xmath8 is positive and equals @xmath9 for almost all @xmath10",
    ". this value can be easily calculated by noting that the logistic map is conjugate to the tent map or by having recourse to the fact that the dynamical system defined by eq.([log ] ) is ergodic for this particular value of @xmath11 @xcite . in this latter case ,",
    "one is justified to calculate analytically the lyapunov exponent as an ensemble average @xmath12 the function @xmath13   \\label{inv1}\\ ] ] being the invariant density of the map satisfying @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the preimage of an arbitrary subset @xmath16 of the unit interval @xcite .    in this paper , we shall focus on another property of the logistic map at @xmath17 , namely the existence of the following closed - form solution @xmath18 where @xmath19 .",
    "the importance of this formula relies evidently on the fact that @xmath20 can be evaluated directly , for any initial point @xmath21 , without actually computing the intermediate values @xmath22 . in the remaining of this work",
    ", we follow the steps used in the derivation of the above formula to construct similar expressions involving general terms of the form @xmath23 . in doing so",
    ", we shall see that a whole new family of polynomial maps can be defined which , essentially , generalize the logistic map by preserving the density eq.([inv1 ] ) , and whose lyapunov exponents can be calculated easily . other properties of these newly defined dynamical maps are also studied .",
    "in particular , we shall point out some similarities between the maps and the tschebysheff polynomials , and prove , finally , that the family of maps as a whole is closed under the composition of functions .",
    "the explicit solution of the logistic map at the particular value @xmath7 can be derived by substituting in @xmath24 the change of coordinates @xmath25 , valid for @xmath2 $ ] , and by using the trigonometric identity @xmath26 in order to obtain @xmath27 .",
    "this is equivalent to the map @xmath28 , which has the explicit solution @xmath29 hence , the complete solution in terms of the coordinate @xmath30 must correspond to eq.([clo ] ) .    following these steps",
    ", one can imagine to construct a map having the solution @xmath31 by expressing @xmath32 in terms of @xmath33 with the identity @xmath34 in this case , one gets @xmath35 as a possible dynamical map on @xmath36 $ ] having the required solution . more generally , one can use the recurrence formula @xmath37-\\sin [ ( n-2)\\theta ] \\label{rec}\\ ] ] to define a whole set of maps which express @xmath38 in terms of @xmath39 .",
    "this set , the _ sine functions set _ , is defined specifically as @xmath40 where @xmath41 ^ 2 $ ] , and @xmath42 note that the intermediate functions @xmath43 are expressed as such in order to verify eq.([rec ] ) with the variable change @xmath44 .",
    "c @xmath45 +   +   +   +   +   +    table 1 .",
    "first five members of @xmath46 .    using these definitions",
    ", we calculate the first five functions of @xmath46 listed in table 1 . obviously , by construction of @xmath46 , @xmath47 is the logistic equation itself with parameter @xmath7 . from a more general perspective",
    ", it can also be seen that the maps @xmath45 are degree @xmath48 polynomials whose leading coefficient , i.e. , the coefficient of the highest degree term , is equal to @xmath49 in absolute value .",
    "these two results , satisfied by any function @xmath45 , is proven more formally in ref.@xcite .",
    "note that the latter property allows us to extend the similarity with the logistic map by parameterizing the functions of @xmath46 in the following manner @xmath50 with @xmath51 .",
    "we call the set of functions @xmath52 the _ family of _ @xmath45 , which can be characterized numerically by bifurcation diagrams and lyapunov spectrums such as the ones shown in figure  1 .",
    "many of the interesting properties of the logistic map at @xmath7 can be investigated more intuitively by making explicit the fact that eq.([smap ] ) is equivalent to a shift map @xmath53 on the binary expression of @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "indeed , if we express @xmath54 as a binary number @xmath55 then applying eq.([smap ] ) to @xmath54 is equivalent to shifting all the bits of @xmath54 to the left and dropping the integer part . in other words , @xmath56 where @xmath57 for @xmath58 , and @xmath59 .",
    "not surprisingly , the same is true for the maps @xmath45 , since eq.([smap ] ) was the guideline in defining the family @xmath46 .",
    "however , in the case of @xmath45 , the shift map to consider takes effect on @xmath54 written in base @xmath48 .",
    "this follows from the following result which generalizes effectively the solution of eqs.([clo ] ) and ( [ smap ] ) .",
    "_ theorem 1 .",
    "_ let @xmath60 be the orbit of @xmath21 under @xmath61 .",
    "if we write @xmath25 , then we have that @xmath62 where , as usual , @xmath19 .",
    "we omit the proof of this theorem as it follows directly from the next lemma .",
    "_ lemma 1_. consider @xmath45 as defined previously .",
    "we have that @xmath63    _ proof : _ the result is obvious for @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "suppose eq.([sin1 ] ) true for @xmath66 and @xmath67 , that is to say @xmath68(\\sin ^2\\theta ) \\\\",
    "& = & \\sin ^2[(n-1)\\theta ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath69 $ ] . then , for @xmath70@xmath71 ^ 2 \\\\ & = & [ 2\\cos \\theta \\sin ( ( n-1)\\theta ) -\\sin ( ( n-2)\\theta ) ] ^2 \\\\ & = & \\sin ^2(n\\theta ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used the identity ( [ rec]).@xmath72    note that we could have proceeded to a similar generalization of the logistic map using cosine functions instead of sine functions , while preserving its shift property .",
    "one possible way of achieving this is to define the _ cosine functions set _",
    "@xmath73 where @xmath74 ^ 2 $ ] , and @xmath75    contrary to the @xmath43 s , the functions @xmath76 have the interesting property that they are polynomials of degree @xmath48 .",
    "in fact , the set @xmath77 coincides with the set of tschebysheff polynomials on the unit interval @xcite , the latter set satisfying the exact same recurrence formula as eq.([rec1 ] ) .",
    "we thus have that @xmath78 must constitute a set of orthogonal polynomials , i.e. , @xmath79 for all integers @xmath48 and @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the delta - kronecker function .",
    "this fact can be further proved using the property @xmath82 , well - known to be satisfied by the tschebysheff functions .",
    "note that @xmath83 is also a set of orthogonal functions ; its members satisfy indeed the relation @xmath84 . in the remaining of this work",
    ", we shall restrain our study to the set @xmath46 , since the maps @xmath45 are directly related to @xmath85 by the expression @xmath86 hence , as far as their dynamics are concerned , the functions @xmath45 and @xmath87 are totally equivalent .",
    "the analysis of the chaoticity properties of a map @xmath88 is greatly simplified by studying conjugate maps of @xmath88 which are obtained by applying a global change of variables .",
    "recall that two maps @xmath89 and @xmath90 are _ conjugate _ if there exists a homeomorphism , i.e. , a bijective and continuous map @xmath91 such that @xmath92 .",
    "the function @xmath93 is called a _",
    "conjugacy_. in the context of @xmath94 , a possible conjugate function of @xmath45 can be constructed as follows .",
    "let @xmath95 be a piecewise linear function ( a generalized tent map ) defined on subintervals @xmath96 $ ] of @xmath97 $ ] by setting @xmath98 with @xmath99 .",
    "_ theorem 2_. @xmath45 is conjugate to @xmath95 with conjugacy @xmath100 .",
    "_ proof _ : first note that @xmath101 is both continuous and bijective on the interval @xmath97 $ ] .",
    "now , on the first hand we have that @xmath102 .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath103 thus , we have proved that @xmath104 for all integers",
    "@xmath48.@xmath105    figure 2 depicts the graphs of @xmath45 and the corresponding @xmath95 for @xmath106 .",
    "( @xmath107 is only the tent map since , as we mentioned , @xmath47 is the logistic map . ) in each case , note that @xmath45 is a `` smooth '' version of @xmath108 .",
    "_ remark_. the functions @xmath85 are pairwise conjugate to the functions @xmath108 with conjugacy map @xmath109 .",
    "evidently , since the conjugacy is an equivalence relation , this has the consequence that any @xmath87 is conjugate to @xmath45 .",
    "in this section , we evaluate the invariant densities of the maps @xmath45 and their lyapunov exponents based on the conjugates found in the previous section . as one would expect from the similarity of the graphs of @xmath110 and @xmath111 in figure 2 , the functions @xmath95 should exhibit a unique and constant invariant density @xmath112,\\ ] ] just as it is the case for the tent map .",
    "this can be proven using adler and bowen s results on markov transformations @xcite , ( see also @xcite ) . at this point",
    ", the invariant density of the functions @xmath45 can be found using the transformation formula @xmath113 where @xmath114 so as to obtain @xmath115 the unicity of @xmath116 is assured by the fact that @xmath117 is also unique , which means that both functions @xmath45 and @xmath95 must be ergodic @xcite .    now , to evaluate the lyapunov exponent of @xmath45 we may use the fact that @xmath118 for almost all @xmath119 $ ] to infer that @xmath120 almost everywhere in the case of @xmath95 .",
    "accordingly , since lyapunov exponents are invariant under smooth and differentiable coordinate transformations @xcite , we have the following theorem .",
    "( a more extensive proof of this result , which takes care of the pathological points where @xmath121 is not defined , is contained in ref.@xcite . )    _ theorem 3 . _",
    "the lyapunov exponent of @xmath45 is @xmath122 almost everywhere ( with respect to the invariant measure @xmath116 ) .",
    "the above theorem shows that the members of @xmath46 are non - conjugate to each other simply because they possess different lyapunov exponents .",
    "it also shows that @xmath123 , and consequently the set of tschebysheff polynomials , are sets of _ chaotic _ maps .",
    "indeed , @xmath124 for @xmath125 , and by using the shift property of @xmath45 we can choose @xmath126 , with @xmath54 irrational , to build an orbit that is not asymptotically periodic .",
    "another way to convince ourselves that all the polynomials in @xmath46 have chaotic orbits is to use the celebrated result `` period-3 implies chaos '' @xcite , and find an initial point @xmath21 of period 3 for each @xmath45 .",
    "for instance , for a @xmath127 let @xmath126 where @xmath128 again , using the shift map property , we must have @xmath129 we thus extended the chaoticity properties of the logistic map to an infinite family of polynomials .",
    "to complete the study of the properties of @xmath46 , we now deduce that it is an abelian monoid with respect to the composition of functions ( @xmath130 ) .",
    "a monoid , precisely , is a non - empty set @xmath131 together with a binary associative operation , say @xmath132 , such that @xmath133 for @xmath134 .",
    "there must also be an element @xmath135 , called the identity element , for which @xmath136 for all @xmath137 .",
    "moreover , a monoid is called abelian if the binary operation is commutative @xcite . in @xmath46 ,",
    "the identity element is @xmath138 . also ,",
    "the composition of function is clearly associative .",
    "now , to prove that @xmath46 is indeed abelian monoid , we verify that it is closed under composition and that this composition is commutative , a condition that is not verified in the case of composition of general functions .",
    "however , before we do so , we present next a new expression of @xmath45 on the unit interval .",
    "_ lemma 2 .",
    "_ for all @xmath45 and @xmath119 $ ] , @xmath139    _ proof : _ let @xmath119 $ ] .",
    "there exists a @xmath140 $ ] such that @xmath141 , and thus @xmath142 .",
    "now , from lemma 1 we have @xmath143.@xmath72    _ theorem 4 . _ ( monoid property ) let @xmath144 and @xmath145 be any positive integers .",
    "we have that @xmath146.\\ ] ]    _ proof : _ for @xmath144 and @xmath145 given , consider @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "then , for any @xmath119 $ ] , we obtain from lemma  2 @xmath149   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\sin ^2[n_1\\arcsin ( \\sin ( n_2\\arcsin \\sqrt{x } ) ) ]   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\sin ^2(n_1n_2\\arcsin \\sqrt{x } )   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & s[n_1n_2](x).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] obviously , @xmath150(x)=s[n_2n_1](x)$ ] , so the composition is commutative.@xmath72    as a direct consequence of the monoid property , @xmath151-periodic points of a certain polynomial @xmath45 can be looked at as fixed points of the function @xmath152 where @xmath153 .",
    "furthermore , a polynomial @xmath45 of very high degree can be computed easily by decomposing its expression using lower degree polynomial of the family @xmath46 .",
    "explicitly , consider @xmath154 .",
    "we say that @xmath45 is a _ prime element _ of @xmath46 if @xmath48 is a prime number . using this definition",
    ", we have as a result of theorem 4 and the fundamental theorem of arithmetic that any polynomial @xmath45 must possess a unique decomposition in prime elements of @xmath46 .",
    "to conclude , note that our study of the sine functions , written in the form @xmath155 , have been restricted to positive integers @xmath48 . in a similar manner , it could be interesting to investigate functions of the type @xmath156 with @xmath157 real .",
    "one observation about this extra generalization is that , as for @xmath158 , the function @xmath159 does not exhibit chaotic properties for @xmath160 .",
    "the function @xmath161 , for example , is conjugate to @xmath162 , and has all of its orbits attracted to @xmath163 . yet ,",
    "this is not surprising since the lyapunov exponent of this map must be @xmath164 .",
    "this brings us to conjecture that @xmath165 must admit chaotic behavior if and only if @xmath166 , considering that the lyapunov exponents of @xmath159 should be @xmath167 . a complete proof of this result ,",
    "however , can not be given here using the same symbolic dynamic approach used for @xmath45 , for the simple reason that the expression of a point in `` base @xmath48 '' makes sense only if @xmath48 is an integer greater than @xmath168 .",
    "v.p . would like to thank a. mingarelli for helpful discussions .",
    "this work was supported in part by the national sciences and engineering research council of canada ( nserc ) through the es a scolarship program .",
    "this definition of chaos is not necessarily equivalent to the more widely held definition based on topological transitivity and sensitivity to initial conditions ( see , e.g. , refs.@xcite ) .",
    "however , the conditions of chaoticity given in the text , which are used throughout this work , are more easy to verify in practice , and nevertheless capture most of the essense of what is understood as chaos ."
