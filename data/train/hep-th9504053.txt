    "there are in fact two different types of black hole solutions having the same mass .",
    "these are the schwarzschild black holes with vanishing gauge fields and the su(2 ) coloured black holes @xcite . like the regular solutions the coloured black hole solutions are unstable @xcite .",
    "thus for a certain range of masses the system possesses two distinct types of black holes , providing a counterexample to the `` no - hair conjecture '' for black holes , unless the coloured black holes are discarded as a counterexample because of their instability .",
    "here we consider static spherically symmetric regular solutions and black holes of the su(3 ) einstein - yang - mills system ( with vanishing time component of the gauge field ) .",

    "( [ eqa ] ) the metric function @xmath29 can be eliminated from the matter field equations .",
    "note , that the equations are symmetric with respect to an interchange of the functions @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and to the transformations @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , yielding degenerate solutions .    comparing the equations of the so(3 )",

    "thus these so(3 ) solutions have precisely double the mass of their su(2 ) counterparts .",
    "let us first consider the regular solutions of the su(3 ) einstein - yang - mills system . requiring asymptotically flat solutions implies that the metric functions @xmath29 and @xmath40 both approach a constant at infinity , and that the matter functions approach a vacuum configuration of the gauge field .",

    "we now turn to the black hole solutions of the su(3 ) einstein - yang - mills system . imposing again the condition of asymptotic flatness , the black hole solutions satisfy the same boundary conditions at infinity as the regular solutions .",
    "the existence of a regular event horizon at @xmath74 requires @xmath75 and @xmath76 , and the matter functions must satisfy at the horizon @xmath74 @xmath77    so(3 ) black hole solutions have not been found previously @xcite . in fig .",

    "corresponding to each regular so(3 ) solution there exist black hole solutions .",
