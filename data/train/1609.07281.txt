    "detecting the state of a quantum system is an invasive process , which necessarily modifies the system itself . in a continuous measurement description",
    "the information on the system s state is gradually encoded in a classical ( macroscopic ) signal of a detector , which at the same time induces a modification of the state of the system@xcite . in the simplest case of measuring an observable @xmath2 of a two - level system , where the detector distinguishes the two eigenstates of @xmath2 ,",
    "the process is characterized by a measurement time , @xmath3 , after which the detector s signals for the different eigenstates can be resolved from the detector s noise . from the system s point of view",
    "the detector back - action corresponds to a stochastic component of the state evolution , which asymptotically drives the system towards one of the measured eigenstates . in average , this back - action is quantified by the detector - induced decoherence time , @xmath4 , after which the system is in an incoherent mixture of eigenstates of @xmath2 .",
    "the fundamental disturbance associated to measurement in quantum mechanics is quantified by the fact that @xmath5 . when the decoherence rate coincides with the rate of acquisition of information , back - action is minimal , which is referred to as quantum limited detection .",
    "this continuous description of a quantum measurement is in fact appropriate for current readout methods of a variety of qubits and quantum devices @xcite .",
    "the significance of quantum limited detection is apparent in single shot measurements , as opposed to averaged measurement results . in a single shot measurement",
    "a quantum limited detector induces a stochastic evolution of the system without any decoherence , and therefore a pure state remains as such during the measurement@xcite ; decoherence appears only as a result of averaging over the detectors s outcome .",
    "this observation is at the basis of a number of techniques for quantum devices control @xcite , precision measurement @xcite , and quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "the experimental implementation of these techniques besides quantum optics@xcite has been initiated in superconducting qubits where feedback loops @xcite and single trajectories mapping @xcite have been reported .",
    "quantum limited detection is therefore of interest in solid state systems at large , where spin , charge , and topologically protected degrees of freedom are exploited for new quantum devices .",
    "a number of different detection schemes exist in these contexts . for example",
    "charge sensors based on transport through semiconductor devices , like quantum point contacts ( qpcs ) , are used and proposed as sensors for e.g. charge @xcite , spin @xcite , and topologically protected qubits @xcite .",
    "motivated by the evolution of measurement process in solid state systems , we analyze here the effect of interactions on quantum measurement , focusing on the detector s efficiency .",
    "electron - electron interactions are generally important in solid state systems and emerge as an effective description of certain detection schemes of superconducting qubits @xcite .",
    "specifically , we consider a charge qubit sensed by a nearby quantum point contact in the tunneling regime , which directly models charge sensing in experiments .",
    "we consider two effects of the electrostatic coupling of the qpc to the charge state of the qubit : ( i ) a state - dependent tunneling term and ( ii ) a state - dependent coupling to the local density in leads @xcite . in the absence of interactions ,",
    "the qpc is a quantum limited detector for sufficiently low temperature .",
    "both thermal fluctuations and local density couplings drive the detector away from its quantum limit working point @xcite .",
    "we find that repulsive electron - electron interactions generically reduce both the rates of induced decoherence and of acquisition of information with respect to their noninteracting counterpart , although in different amounts .",
    "this difference is due purely to the local density interaction term , which contributes to decoherence but does not participate in the current and hence provides no information on the system s state . for increasing strong interactions",
    ", the renormalization of the rates leads to the need of lower temperatures in order to reach the quantum limit of detection . in this case interactions",
    "provide us with a slower detector .",
