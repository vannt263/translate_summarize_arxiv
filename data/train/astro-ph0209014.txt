    "current planet detection methods give basic information on the planet : a minimum mass if the orbital inclination is not known , an estimate of surface temperature , and , in the case of the one transiting system , a possible sodium detection in the planet s atmosphere .",
    "there remains a lack of constraints on the planet s structure leaving astronomers to explore new observational probes .",
    "cuntz , saar , & musielak ( 2000 ) suggested that there may be an observable interaction between a parent star and a close - in giant planet .",
    "the effect could be tidal , magnetic , or a combination of the two .",
    "such an interaction could manifest itself in the form of chromospheric and coronal heating which are predicted to produce a variation of a few percent ( saar & cuntz 2001 ) .",
    "if the surface of the star is indeed heated by the planet , then a hot - spot would follow the planet around its orbit , appearing hottest at the sub - planetary point if the interaction is with the planet s magnetosphere , or twice per orbit if the interaction is tidal .",
    "there are several indicators of increased chromospheric activity , one of which is the ca ii h & k line reversal . due to the accessibility of these lines with ground - based telescopes",
    ", we chose to monitor the spectral region over several nights for five planetary systems whose orbital periods are between 3.1 and 4.6 days .",
    "high - resolution ( r = 110,000 ) and high signal - to - noise ( s / n per pixel @xmath0 500 in the continuum and 150 in the h & k cores ) spectra were obtained over 3.5 nights at the cfht with the fiber - fed coud spectrograph .",
    "the spectral range spanned 60    centered on 3947  .",
    "differential radial velocities were measured to better than 20 m / s allowing current ephemerides and hence accurate phases ( @xmath20.05 ) to be determined for each spectrum .",
    "the data showed significant nightly modulations in the ca ii h & k reversal structure in the spectra of @xmath3 boo , 51 peg , hd179949 , hd 209458 and @xmath4 and .",
    "for the first four of these stars , the highest enhancement in the k - line emission occurred at the sub - planetary point where @xmath5  0 .",
    "however , for @xmath4 and , the modulation was not correlated to orbital phase and was at a smaller level , though significantly higher than the two standards , @xmath3 ceti and the sun .",
    "table 1 lists the target stars with the rms of the maximum k - line activity measured relative to each star s normalized mean . as a test of stability of the spectra",
    ", the identical analysis was performed on the aluminum line ( 3944 ) which is of comparable depth to the h & k absorption features .",
    "the rms of these are also included in table 1 .",

    "these smaller features are more evident for hd 179949 .",
    "an example of the ca ii k - line for hd 179949 is shown in figure 2 with the residuals .",
    "there appear to be changes in the three individual features of the reversal : the central self - absorption and the blue and red shoulders .",
    "the two spectra taken on different nights but of similar phase ( @xmath50.7 ) appear to have a consistent shape while the spectrum at @xmath8=0.07 has a clear enhancement in the center self - reversal .",
    "preliminary evidence indicates that the emission increases once per orbit in four of the five stars near the sub - planetary point , @xmath8=0 .",
    "this may suggest that the planet - star interaction is of a magnetic nature and any tidal heating that may be occurring is as yet undetected .",
    "if follow - up observations confirm phase - dependent heating of the stellar chromosphere , then this could be the first evidence of an extra - solar planet s magnetosphere ."
