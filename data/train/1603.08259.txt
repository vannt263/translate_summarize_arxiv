    "in the modern condensed matter physics , one of the important areas of research is to understand various phases of quantum matter and their transitions .",
    "a prime example of such an experimental system with a plethora of phases is the superconducting cuprates . for a conventional ( low temperature )",
    "superconductor , its many - body ground state and low energy behaviour can be described by the bcs theory @xcite , which is a weakly coupled theory .",
    "however , for high temperature superconductors , their superconductivity appears to originate from strongly correlated many - electron system confined on two dimensional plane due to the special molecular structure of the cuprates .    over the years",
    "many other systems with strong correlation have been discovered , such as the superconducting iron - based compounds known as pnictides @xcite .",
    "one of the common features of these systems is the existence of a superconducting dome in the phase diagram .",
    "it has become increasingly evident that , a significant part of the normal phase right above the dome in these systems , e.g. the strange metal phase , can be described by an emergent conformal field theory ( cft ) .",
    "the cft is scale free at the quantum critical point where some parameter is tuned to a critical value and the temperature is zero @xcite .",
    "then near the critical point , universal , model independent long range physics exists for models within the same universality class which is governed by the deformed cft with a few symmetry breaking terms .",
    "for example , the strange metal behaviour exists not only in the high temperature superconductors but also in many - spin systems , e.g. heavy fermion metals @xcite , near the quantum critical point .",
    "the quantum critical point could be hidden or screened by the superconducting dome but revealed by universal low energy behaviours at temperature higher than the dome , such as universal dimensionless transport coefficients which are independent of the microscopic interactions @xcite .",
    "since most of these systems are strongly coupled , conventional perturbative qft is not applicable .",
    "different models are proposed to explain the mechanism , for example , some systems are believed to accommodate competing symmetry - breaking order parameters in specific range of the physical parameters spanning the phase diagram .",
    "based on this idea of competing orders , many new concepts have been introduced , such as the spin fluctuation superglue @xcite , the resonating valence bond ( rvb ) gauge approach @xcite and the so(5 ) theory @xcite . in spite of all these new concepts , and their partial success , full understanding of such systems remains elusive . in view of the non - perturbative nature of the problem ,",
    "ads / cft correspondence @xcite , a tool developed in string theory , provides a new approach to attack the problem .",
    "ads / cft correspondence , or called the holographic principle , is an duality between a weakly coupled gravity in anti - di sitter space ( ads ) and a strongly coupled cft living on the boundary of the ads space .",
    "this duality spawns a spate of research on a certain class of condensed matter - like systems near the quantum critical point . over the years",
    ", the study in the quantum critical property and the intriguing universal low energy predictions indicates that the universality may have some deep connection with the universal transport properties observed in the normal phase ( e.g. the strange metal ) of the aforementioned class of real systems @xcite .",
    "ads / cft correspondence states that for every particle state in ads space there exits a dual operator in the corresponding cft on the boundary .",
    "the isometry group of the ads space is identified with the conformal symmetry of the field theory .",
    "this is the symmetry that plays the main role in characterising various quantum phases and their transitions .",
    "one of such phases that has recently been extensively studied at finite charge density is called the `` semi - local quantum liquid '' @xcite . at low energy",
    "this quantum state exhibits different scaling behaviour in time and space .",
    "finite temperature phase transition is realized by considering a charged non - extremal black hole in ads space . in the extremal limit",
    ", the zero temperature quantum phase transition of this system is achieved by varying conformal dimension of the field theory operators .",
    "one way to tune the conformal dimension of the strongly coupled operator is by explicitly changing the mass squared of the dual single particle states in a weakly coupled ads black hole background .",
    "however , this way of changing the conformal dimension is not obviously mapped to tuning an experimental parameter from the boundary theory point of view .",
    "our goal in this paper is to construct a minimum model in bottom - up ads / cft that has a similar phase diagram to a high temperature superconducting cuprate .",
    "we use a charged black hole background which describes a system of finite temperature and chemical potential .",
    "then we introduce a scalar source @xmath0 for the boundary field theory as a tuning parameter which arises from the near boundary behaviour of a dual massive scalar field @xmath1 in this background . then in order to describe the anti - ferromagnetic and superconducting phases , we introduce two massive scalar fields @xmath2 . for simplicity ,",
    "both scalars @xmath3 are neutral with no internal quantum number . by choosing appropriate coupling function between the tuning field @xmath1 and the order parameter fields",
    "@xmath2 in the gravity theory , we can design how the effective masses of @xmath2 depend on @xmath4 at @xmath5 , then engineer various phase diagrams in the @xmath6 plane , including those similar to real high temperature superconducting cuprates .",
    "one can easily generalise this setup to either @xmath7 charged field with superconducting condensation or different kind of anti - ferromagnetic models , without changing the qualitative behaviour of the phase diagram .",
    "study along the similar line has been reported very recently in @xcite , where a different system with an extra @xmath7 gauge field on the gravity background is introduced to represent a chemical potential , as an external tuning parameter for the phase transition in high temperature superconductors .",
    "this is an example of modeling the phase transitions in reality due to varying a tunable doping parameter . in the global ads background , the holographic quantum phase transitions and interacting bulk scalars",

    "but we are interested in systems with finite density , and therefore we achieve zero temperature by taking the extremal limit of the charged brane @xmath34 with nonvanishing @xmath26 , such that @xmath35 .",
    "the basic guiding principle of ads / cft is based on the symmetries on both sides of the correspondence .",
    "scaling symmetry is one of those larger symmetries which plays an important role in understanding the low energy behaviour of the system under consideration in terms of relevant operators of definite scaling dimension .",
    "one such interesting system dual to the charged black hole in anti - de sitter(ads ) space is known as `` semi - local quantum liquid '' @xcite .",
    "following reference @xcite , we review the scaling symmetries for the semi - local quantum liquids .",
    "our solution is parameterized in terms of two independent parameters @xmath21 and @xmath26 , while the appropriate physical parameters we consider are temperature @xmath36 and the chemical potential @xmath37 . therefore , in terms of those thermodynamic variables , the equation of state of the dual field theory of the charged black brane turns out to be @xmath38    the equations of motion respect two types of scaling symmetries @xcite .",

    "in this section , we would like to construct a minimum holographic model in the bottom - up approach that has a similar phase diagram to a high temperature superconducting cuprate ( see , e.g. , figure 1 of @xcite ) .",
    "as we have already discussed above , at low temperature , distinct phases can be obtained by tuning the doping parameter . in order to understand the basic mechanism of quantum phase transition near zero temperature ,",
    "we consider interacting order parameter fields .",
    "according to the standard ads / cft dictionary , the chemical potential @xmath50 , conjugate to the charge density @xmath51 , is dual to a bulk gauge field @xmath52 , such that @xmath50 and @xmath51 are encoded in the non - normalizable and normalizable modes of the asymptotic behavior of @xmath52 respectively .",
    "similarly , in our model in this section , the doping parameter should be dual to a bulk scalar field @xmath1 . in the asymptotic solution of this so - called `` tuning field ''",
    "@xmath1 , the non - normalizable mode is dual to the source @xmath0 on the boundary , interpreted as the doping parameter since it is an intensive quantity , just like the role of the chemical potential as the non - normalizable mode of the asymptotic @xmath52 .",
    "the normalizable mode of @xmath1 , on the other hand , is dual to the expectation value of the conjugate variable to the doping parameter , which we do not specify .",
    "we consider two order parameter fields to be neutral scalar fields @xmath53 in ads bulk .",
    "we also conjecture that the controlling parameter of our system is dual to another neutral field @xmath1 which is coupled to @xmath53 with a certain degree of fine tuning , such that we can reproduce the experimental phase diagram .",
    "our goal is to understand the phase diagram and the scaling behavior near the quantum critical point in such a system . in order for the two order parameters to be controlled by tuning the external parameter",
    ", it requires @xmath54 , @xmath55 interact with the tuning field @xmath1 in some non - linear way .",
    "therefore , we introduce the following minimal lagrangian density @xmath56 where @xmath57 with @xmath58 indicate the coupling constant , @xmath59 and @xmath60 . the interaction terms between @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath1 are given by @xmath61 where the detailed form of the coupling function @xmath62 will be given later .",

    "the asymptotic forms are given by @xmath71 once can also read out the scaling dimension of the sources @xmath72 and operators @xmath73 according to , that @xmath74    in our analysis , we choose the standard quantization on the boundary for the asymptotic @xmath75 , that set the boundary source @xmath76 .",
    "therefore we do not need to consider the correction term in asymptotic @xmath66 due to @xmath77 self - interaction in . the cross interaction @xmath78 will not incur corrections to either asymptotic @xmath66 or @xmath1 due to the same reason .",
    "the @xmath79 interaction induces correction to the asymptotic @xmath1 solution , but we will constrain the mass of @xmath1 to @xmath80 in our analysis , so that the correction contributes at the sub - leading order in the normalizable mode and can be neglected at asymptotic infinity .    in the following , we present two different models , with different sets of @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 parameters and the coupling functions @xmath85 .",
