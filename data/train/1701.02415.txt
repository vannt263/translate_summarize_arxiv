    "the introduction of graph - based codes together with the belief propagation ( bp ) decoding  @xcite , has made a significant change in the field of error correcting codes in terms of low - complexity decoding .",
    "generally , a graph - based code can be represented by a tanner graph in which variable and check nodes respectively correspond to the codeword symbols and the parity check constraints  @xcite .",
    "one of the most prominent classes of graph - based codes for which the bp decoding algorithm gives near - capacity performance is low - density parity - check ( ldpc ) codes invented by gallager  @xcite . as a unifying framework for graph - based codes , richardson and urbanke",
    "@xcite introduced multi - edge type low - density parity - check ( met - ldpc ) codes to control the tanner graph structure of random code ensembles .",
    "a code ensemble is the set of all possible codes with a particular degree distribution of their tanner graph representation .    a numerical technique , called met density evolution ( met - de )  @xcite has been widely used for analysis and design of met - ldpc code ensembles under bp decoding .",
    "met - de determines the asymptotic behavior of the bp decoding for a given met - ldpc code ensemble by iteratively tracking the probability density function ( pdf ) of messages passed along the edges in the corresponding tanner graph . applying met - de to a given met - ldpc code ensemble",
    ", one can predict how codes ( with a large enough code length ) from that ensemble behave on average .",
    "met - de allows finding the optimal degree distribution independent of the choice of code length or tanner graph structure , which is the first step in any design or analysis of met - ldpc codes .",
    "fountain codes  @xcite are a class of graph - based codes , which have been inspired by the idea of _ rateless coding _ , originally proposed for data transmission over erasure channels .",
    "luby transform ( lt ) codes  @xcite are the first class of efficient fountain codes , which are essentially a type of low - density generator matrix ( ldgm ) codes  @xcite with an average input bit degree that grows logarithmically .",
    "this logarithmic growth causes several problems , such as increased complexity of encoder and decoder , and also results in large error floors .",
    "raptor codes  @xcite are an extension of lt codes that overcome these problems .",
    "a raptor code is a simple concatenation of an inner lt code with an outer code , called precode , which is usually a high rate ldpc code .",
    "although the raptor code design has been well investigated for different binary channels  @xcite , there has been little progress on universal design methods for the binary - input additive white gaussian noise ( bi - awgn ) channel , and a complete analysis of the asymptotic performance of raptor codes is still missing .",
    "performance of raptor codes over the bi - awgn channel has been investigated in  @xcite , and shown that the realized rate of a well - designed raptor code can approach the capacity bound .",
    "shirvanimoghaddam  _ et  al . _",
    "@xcite studied the design of raptor codes over bi - awgn channels in the low signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) regime and showed that properly designed raptor codes can achieve rate efficiency larger than 0.95 in that regime .",
    "pakzad  _ et  al . _",
    "@xcite studied different design principles , such as code length and complexity of the decoding , for finite - length raptor codes under bp decoding for bi - awgn channels . however , all these methods only considered the performance of the lt code component of the raptor code for a given precode . a high - rate regular ldpc code  @xcite or a high - rate ldpc code with left - regular and right poisson distributed parity check matrix  @xcite has been widely used for the precode of raptor codes in order to minimize the rate loss due to the precoding .",
    "this motivates us to propose a more general design framework for raptor codes using a multi - edge framework .",
    "the multi - edge framework enables us to perform a comprehensive analysis of the asymptotic performance of the entire raptor code including both the lt code and the ldpc code .",
    "all the design methods proposed in literature on raptor codes over bi - awgn channel have relied on linear programming based on approximate de algorithms namely , the extrinsic information transfer ( exit ) chart analysis  @xcite or gaussian approximation  @xcite .",
    "these approximate de algorithms are based on the assumption of symmetric gaussian distribution for the de messages . however , this assumption may not be accurate  @xcite , particularly at low rates and with punctured variable nodes , which is the case for raptor codes .",
    "therefore , the approximate de algorithms can negatively impact the search for optimal code ensembles .",
    "the decoding process for raptor codes generally consists of a series of decoding attempts , which progressively collects lt coded symbols until the decoder is confident that the transmitted message is correctly decoded .",
    "basically a raptor decoding attempt consists of two decoding processes : the lt decoding process and the ldpc decoding process ( collectively know as raptor decoding process ) .",
    "each of these decoding processes runs a predetermined number of bp decoding iterations in which the soft information is passed back and forth along the edges in the corresponding tanner graph .",
    "the way that the soft information is exchanging between two decoding processes depends on the configuration of the raptor decoder ( i.e. , tandem decoding or joint decoding ) .",
    "the conventional design strategy of raptor codes is mainly based on tandem decoding , where the lt component is decoded first and soft information is then send to the precoder .",
    "venkian  _ et  al . _",
    "@xcite however showed that tandem decoding is sub - optimal compared to joint decoding , where both component codes are decoded in parallel and extrinsic information ( i.e. , the information from previous bp decoding iteration ) is exchanged between the decoders .",
    "unfortunately , only few studies  @xcite have considered joint decoding of raptor codes .",
    "further , there is no design strategy for the joint design of component codes of raptor codes , using joint or tandem decoding .",
    "moreover , the traditional tandem decoding scheme proposed for raptor codes starts the lt decoding process from scratch at every decoding attempt , without using soft information produced in the previous decoding attempt .",
    "we refer to this decoding strategy as _ message - reset decoding_. another possible decoding strategy for the lt decoding process in the tandem decoding scheme is to reuse the soft information produced in the previous decoding attempt .",
    "we refer to this decoding strategy as _",
    "incremental decoding_. to - date only few results  @xcite are available concerning the performance and the decoding complexity trade - off for raptor codes over the bi - awgn channel .",
    "the main contributions of this paper are as follows :    1 .",
    "we study raptor codes using the multi - edge framework , where we represent the raptor code as a met - ldpc code , which is the serial concatenation of an lt code and an ldpc code ( i.e. , precode ) .",
    "this met representation gives us a more unifying framework to analyze and design raptor codes with the help of analytical tools used for met - ldpc code , such as met - de  @xcite .",
    "we consider two decoding schemes for raptor codes under the multi - edge framework , including tandem and joint decoding .",
    "we derive the stability conditions under tandem decoding using the multi - edge framework and re - derive the existing stability conditions from  @xcite .",
    "we then derive an exact expression for the stability of raptor codes under joint decoding using the multi - edge framework .",
    "we analyze raptor codes using both tandem and joint decoding , and show the benefits of joint decoding .",
    "we then propose a joint raptor code design method by including degree distributions of both lt and ldpc code components as variables in the optimization .",
    "this provides a framework for a better selection of the ldpc code component depending on the channel snr for which the code is designed ( designed snr ) and the degree distributions of the lt code component .",
    "we formulate the optimization problem for raptor codes for a given channel snr as a non - liner cost function maximization problem , where the realized rate ( which is computed from met - de ) is the cost function and the degree distributions of lt and ldpc code components give the variables to be optimized",
    ". the realized rate of a raptor code is defined as the ratio of the length of the information vector , and the average number of raptor coded symbols required for the successful decoding at the destination . moreover ,",
    "our optimization method is based on the met - de , which in turn helps to increase the accuracy of the final result in the code optimization . because we are no longer use any approximate de algorithms such as exit charts and gaussian approximation , which are previously used to optimize raptor codes . through met - de , we show that designed and/or evaluated raptor codes using joint decoding always give better rate efficiency results than the one with tandem decoding .",
    "this seems to be significant when the evaluated snr is below the designed snr .",
    "finally , we implement a tandem decoding scheme based on the incremental decoding strategy using the multi - edge framework , propose a modification to reduce complexity and show the advantage of considering the incremental decoding strategy in the design of the raptor codes .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",

    "[ sec : optimzation sta met ] and  [ sec : problem stat for ficed precode ] , our goal in the raptor code optimization is to optimally choose the elements in @xmath122 and @xmath123 so that the corresponding code ensemble yields the largest possible realized rate , which can be determined via met - de .",

    "the aim of the raptor code optimization in multi - edge framework is to optimally choose @xmath122 and @xmath123 so that the corresponding code ensemble yields the largest possible realized rate . under multi - edge framework , there are two essential constraints that needs to be satisfied in order to have a valid raptor code degree distribution , namely the code rate constraint and the socket count equality constraint .",

    "@xcite , we have also observed that there is a little difference in performance whether @xmath122 is almost - regular or poisson . at the same time , selecting an almost regular input bit degree distribution significantly helps to minimize the computational complexity of met - de , which in turn helps for an efficient code optimization .        in the majority of literature concerning raptor code design , which use tandem decoding to formulate the optimization problem",
    ", @xmath77 plays an important role .",
    "however no serious effort has been taken for deriving the optimal choice of @xmath77 and it remains mostly heuristic .",
    "we have investigated the optimal choice of @xmath77 using the multi - edge framework and observed that the choice of @xmath77 depends on the rate and the structure of the ldpc code selected for the precode and the channel snr . here",
    "we explain the reasons behind this .",
    "there are two important requirements that needs to be satisfied when we are selecting a value for @xmath77 .",
    "the first requirement is that the value of @xmath77 needs to be selected based on the target residual error which is expected to be corrected by the ldpc decoder .",
    "the second requirement is that @xmath126 in order to ensure a successful decoding at the ldpc decoder .",
    "the first requirement concludes that the choice of @xmath77 depends on the rate and structure of the ldpc code as the error correcting performance of a code is approximately determined by these two parameters .",
    "we then use lemma  [ degree - one ] in appendix  [ appendix_a ] to explain the second requirement . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : raptor_code_in_met_detail ] , the lt code component in met setting has a set of degree - one variable nodes .",
    "therefore according to lemma  [ degree - one ] , after a sufficient number of bp decoding iterations at the lt decoder , the check - to - variable message from an output check node , @xmath127 , is converging to the same distribution as the channel message received at the output bit nodes , @xmath56 .",
    "thus , the decoded llr of input bit node @xmath52 given in ( [ decoded_llr ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath128 . moreover , condition @xmath129 must hold to ensure a successful decoding at the ldpc decoder .",
    "this alternatively shows that the value of @xmath77 depends on the distribution of the channel message received at the output bit nodes , which is a symmetric gaussian distribution with mean , @xmath130 , and variance , @xmath131 , where @xmath29 is the channel snr .",
    "previous work concerning raptor code design appears to have overlooked the choice of ldpc code rate and have selected an arbitrary ldpc code rate as long as the rate loss is not significant .",
    "mostly raptor code designers have selected higher rates for the ldpc code such as 0.98 or 0.95 due to very small rate loss .",
    "cheng  _ et  al . _",
    "@xcite showed that a raptor code with a rate-0.7 ldpc code perform poorly compared to a raptor code with a rate-0.95 ldpc code , particularly at high snrs .",
    "this mainly due to the severe rate loss in the low - rate precoding .",
    "generally , at a higher snr , an ldpc code only performs error detection rather than error correction .",
    "thus the use of low - rate precoding at high snrs will result in severe rate loss .",
    "in contrast , at a lower snr , a low - rate ldpc code can perform both error detection and error correction , thus can help to increase the realized rate of the lt code component . however ,",
    "in general the rate gain obtain from low rate precoding is insignificant compared to the rate loss in the entire raptor code due to low rate precoding .",
    "thus raptor code designers always encourage to use high - rate ldpc code for precoding .",
    "in this section , we compare the performance of raptor codes designed with the optimization method given in section  [ sec : problem stat for ficed precode ] using the multi - edge framework , with the existing raptor codes in literature . for a fair comparison , we set same precode settings as the reference codes and use tandem decoding scheme as the decoding scheme in the code optimization .",
    "we consider two reference codes from literature , where reference code 1  @xcite was designed with precode rate of 0.98 for very low snrs and reference code 2  @xcite was designed with precode rate of 0.98 at snr 0.5 db .",

    "[ fig : fig5on - the - flyopt ] that incremental decoding ( @xmath143 and @xmath103 ) outperforms message - reset decoding ( @xmath143 ) with the same decoding complexity .",
    "moreover , we can obtain rate efficiency results close to the optimal result ( i.e. , message - reset decoding with @xmath144 , where we have chosen @xmath144 as increasing @xmath142 beyond 1000 does not noticeably improve @xmath145 ) by having incremental decoding of @xmath146 , which offers a significant reduction of the decoding complexity .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that recalculation of the same information is avoided with the incremental decoding .",
    "therefore , we can suggest that incremental decoding closely approximate the optimal decoding strategy for the raptor code design , where accurate and efficient rate calculation is particularly valuable .",
    "in this paper , we proposed a new representation of raptor codes as a multi - edge type low - density parity - check ( met - ldpc ) code .",
    "this met representation enable us to perform a comprehensive analysis of asymptotic performance of the raptor code using met density evolution ( met - de ) .",
    "the advantage of using met - de over conventional gaussian approximation - based approaches , such as mean - llr - exit chart , is that met - de does not incorporate any gaussian approximation , thus enables to find the optimal raptor code for given channel condition .",
    "in addition , unlike finite - length analysis met - de gives the average performance of raptor code ensemble .",
    "we considered two decoding schemes based on the belief propagation decoding , namely tandem decoding and joint decoding in the multi - edge framework , and analyzed the stability conditions using met - de .",
