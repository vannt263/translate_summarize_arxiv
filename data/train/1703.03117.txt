    "@xmath5 binding energies @xmath1 are basic quantities in @xmath5 hypernuclei . in 1950 s the values of @xmath1 were extracted from @xmath5 hypernuclei with mass @xmath8 observed in emulsion . after 1980 s ,",
    "medium and heavy @xmath5 hypernuclei have been produced by counter experiments such as @xmath9 reactions .",
    "recently accurate data of @xmath1 values in ground and excited states of hypernuclei have been obtained by @xmath10-ray observations and @xmath11 reactions . on the other hand ,",
    "theoretical baryon - baryon interaction models have been developed  @xcite , where @xmath3-@xmath12 coupling terms have been included in order to reproduce values of @xmath5 single particle potentials @xmath13 values in nuclear matter more or less realistically .",
    "because hyperon(@xmath14)-nucleon(@xmath15 ) scattering data are extremely limited , there remain remarkable ambiguities in @xmath16 interaction models : values of @xmath13 for various interaction models are substantially different from each other .",
    "the @xmath16 interactions are related intimately to the recent topic in neutron - stars .",
    "the large observed masses of @xmath0  @xcite give a severe condition for the stiffness of equation of state ( eos ) of neutron - star matter .",
    "the stiff eos giving the maximum mass of @xmath0 can be derived from the existence of strong three - nucleon repulsion ( tnr ) in the high - density region .",
    "however , the hyperon ( @xmath14 ) mixing in neutron - star matter brings about the remarkable softening of the eos , which cancels the tnr effect for the maximum mass  @xcite .",
    "this problem is known as the  hyperon puzzle \" .",
    "it is considered that this puzzle can be solved if strong repulsions exist not only in @xmath17 cannels but also in @xmath18 and @xmath19 channels  @xcite .",
    "recently , there have been reported the trials to extract the @xmath20 repulsions from the systematic data of @xmath1  @xcite . in refs.@xcite , the multi - pomeron exchange potential ( mpp )",
    "was added to the two - body baryon - baryon interaction @xmath21 together with the phenomenological three - body attraction ( tba ) .",
    "then , the parameters included in mpp and tba were determined so as to reproduce the angular distribution of @xmath22o+@xmath22o scattering at @xmath23 mev and the nuclear saturation property , where the mpp contributions were decisive to reproduce the experimental angular distribution and brought about the stiff eos enough to give maximum masses over @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath21 gives the potentials in @xmath24 and @xmath16 channels , and mpp is universal in all baryon channels .",
    "the tba parts in @xmath16 channels are determined so as to reproduce hypernuclear data reasonably . on the basis of this ( @xmath21+mpp+tba ) model",
    ", it was shown that the eos was still stiff enough to reproduce neutron stars with @xmath25 in spite of substantial softening by hyperon mixing .",
    "the aim of this work is to investigate the @xmath3 sectors of the @xmath21+mpp+tba model , especially the many - body effects ( mbe ) given by mpp+tba parts , through structure calculations of @xmath5 hypernuclei within the framework of the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics for hypernuclei ( hyperamd ) . when we determine the mpp+tba part so as to reproduce the experimental values of @xmath1 , it is evident that this part is dependent on the interaction model for @xmath21 . in other words , it is indispensable that reliable interaction models should be used for @xmath21 in order to investigate mbe .",

    "the strengths of @xmath20 forces were determined by the fitting procedure to the data of @xmath1 .",
    "their @xmath20 repulsion in the best fitting case seems to be abnormally strong .",
    "the reason seems to be because they start from the two - body @xmath3 interaction with no @xmath3-@xmath12 term , giving an overbinding value of @xmath13 . in our case",
    ", the @xmath3-@xmath12 coupling terms are included in the nijmegen models so that their strengths are determined to reproduce physical observables through channel - coupling effects to @xmath3-@xmath3 diagonal channels . then , there remains a rather small room for mbe around normal - density region , where the mpp and tba contributions are cancelled substantially with each other . in our previous work",
    "@xcite , referred to i , the experimental values of @xmath1 have been reproduced systematically by the hyperamd calculations using a special nijmegen model having only a very small room for mbe . in ref .",
    "@xcite , even in this case it was demonstrated that the small mbe works to improve the fitting of @xmath1 values to experimental data . in this work ,",
    "we show that they appear more clearly in the case of using the updated versions of nijmegen extended - soft core ( esc ) models .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "the various versions of the nijmegen models and mbe ( mpp+tba ) are explained , and the @xmath3 @xmath4-matrix calculations are performed .",
    "different features of interaction models are discussed by showing @xmath13 values in nuclear matter . in sec .",
    "iii , the detailed analysis for @xmath5 hypernuclei with @xmath6 are performed on the basis of hyperamd with use of @xmath4-matrix interactions including mbe .",
    "it is discussed what feature of the two - body interaction allows the existence of strong repulsion suggested by the stiff eos of neutron stars .",
    "section v summarizes this paper .",
    "the meson - theoretical models for @xmath16 interactions have been developed continuously by the nijmegen group . in the earlier stage",
    ", they developed the hard - core models  @xcite ( nhc - d and -f ) and the soft - core model ( nsc89 )  @xcite .",
    "after that , the trial started to take into account the @xmath4-matrix results in the modeling of @xmath16 interactions .",
    "as the first outcome of this approach , the nsc97 models  @xcite were proposed , where the six versions a@xmath26f were designed so as to be of different strengths of the @xmath3 spin - spin parts .",
    "then , the observed splitting energies of spin - doublet states in @xmath5 hypernuclei suggested that the spin - spin strengths of nsc97e and nsc07f were in a reasonable region .",
    "epoch - making development of the nijmegen models was accomplished by the esc models , in which two - meson and meson - pair exchanges are taken into account explicitly . in the one - boson exchange ( obe )",
    "models these effects are implicitly and roughly described by exchanges of ` effective mesons ' .",
    "after some trial versions , there appeared the specific versions esc04a / b / c / d  @xcite , features of which were very different from those of the obe models especially in @xmath27 channels .",
    "however , there remain some serious problems in nsc97 and esc04 models .",
    "the first is that the derived values of @xmath5 spin - orbit splitting energies are too large in comparison with the experimental values .",
    "the second is that the derived @xmath28-nucleus potentials @xmath29 are attractive , whereas the experimental values are indicated to be repulsive .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath30 interactions seem to be unreliable : the @xmath31 values derived from the nsc97 ( esc04a / b ) models are strongly ( weakly ) repulsive . those for esc04c / d are attractive , but their partial - wave contributions seem to be rather problematic .",
    "these problems have been further investigated in esc08a / b / c  @xcite where the treatments for axial - vector and pair terms are improved , and the effects of the quark pauli - forbidden states in the repulsive - core representation are taken into account .",
    "however , in these models the @xmath32 cross sections are too large . at present",
    "the possibility is investigated to replace in @xmath33 part of the two - body attraction by a three - body force contribution .",
    "this trial to improve the @xmath32 part does not affect the @xmath24 and @xmath34 parts . here",
    ", in order to investigate sizes of mbe needed for different interaction models , we pick up esc08a / b / c , esc04a and nsc97e / f among the various the nijmgen models . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we used esc08c in an early stage of parameter fitting : this version denoted as esc08c(2012 )  @xcite , and the recent version as esc08c(2014 )  @xcite .",
    "hereafter , esc08c(2012 ) and esc08c(2014 ) are denoted simply as esc12 and esc14 , respectively .",
    "these two versions of esc08c are used in this work mainly.very recently , there is given the latest version esc08c(2016 ) @xcite , esc16 , though it is not used in this work .",
    "the reason why we pick up esc04a ( nsc97e / f ) among esc04a / b / c / d ( nsc97a / b / c / d / f ) is because esc04b / c / d give more attractive values of @xmath13 than esc04a , and nsc97a / b / c are with unreasonable spin - spin parts , not giving binding of @xmath35h .",
    "one of the ideas to avoid remarkable softening of neutron - star eos by hyperon mixing is to assume that the strong three - body repulsions work universally for @xmath18 , @xmath19 @xmath36 as well as for @xmath17 @xcite . as a model of universal repulsions among three and four baryons , we introduce the multi - pomeron exchange potential ( mpp ) . additionally to mpp , the three - baryon attraction ( tba ) is assumed phenomenologically .",
    "mpp and tba in nucleon channels are determined so as to reproduce the experimental angular distributions of @xmath22o+@xmath22o elastic scattering ( @xmath37=70 mev ) and the nuclear saturation property .",
    "in hyperonic channels , they should be taken consistently with hypernuclear data : for each interaction model @xmath21 , mpp and tba parts are adjusted so as to reproduce experimental data of @xmath1 as well as possible .",
    "the specific form of mpp is given as the @xmath15-body local potential by pomeron exchange @xmath38 @xcite and the effective two - body potential in a baryonic medium is obtained by integrating over the coordinates @xmath39 ; @xmath40 we assume that the dominant mechanism is triple and quartic pomeron exchange .",
    "the values of the two - body pomeron strength @xmath41 and the pomeron mass @xmath42 are taken from the adopted esc model .",
    "a scale mass @xmath43 is taken as a proton mass .",
    "tba is assumed as a density - dependent two - body interaction @xmath44 @xmath45 being a space - exchange operator .",
    "there are given the three sets with different strengths of mpp @xcite .",
    "we consider the set mpa as a guidance in this work , where the parameters are taken as @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "then , the most important is whether or not such a strongly repulsion given by these values of @xmath50 and @xmath51 is allowable in reproducing the mass dependence of @xmath1 values .",
    "we start from the channel - coupled @xmath4-matrix equation for the baryon pair @xmath52 in nuclear matter  @xcite , where @xmath53 and @xmath12 : @xmath54 where @xmath55 denotes a @xmath16 relative state @xmath56 with @xmath57 .",

    "the hyperon mixing in neutron - star matter brings about the remarkable softening of the eos . in order to solve this  hyperon puzzle \" , we consider that the repulsive mbe works also in hyperonic channels . as a specific model for mbe , the multi - pomeron exchange repulsion ( mpp ) is added to the two - body interaction together with the phenomenological three - body attraction ( tba ) .    we adjust mbe so as to reproduce the observed data of @xmath1 .",
    "then , it is evident that the strength of mbe depends on the two - body interaction model . even among various versions of the nijmegen interaction models ( esc08a / b , esc12 , esc14 , esc04a , nsc97e / f )",
    ", there are considerable differences with each other . especially , important is the difference among the @xmath2-state contributions . in the cases of esc14 and esc08a / b",
    ", the @xmath2-state contributions are almost vanishing , where the mass dependence of @xmath1 can be reproduced well by adding mbe with the strong mpp repulsion assuring the stiff eos of hyperon - mixed neutron - star matter . in the cases of esc12 and nsc97e / f , the @xmath2-state contributions are substantially repulsive and helpful to reproduce the mass dependence of @xmath1 : there is no room to introduce the strong mpp repulsion consistently with the experimental data . in the case of esc04a ,",
    "the @xmath2-state contribution is strongly attractive , and it is difficult to reproduce the mass dependence of @xmath1 by adding the present form of mbe .",
    "the @xmath1 values of hypernuclei with @xmath6 are analyzed in the framework of hyperamd with use of the @xmath3 @xmath4-matrix interactions derived from esc14 and esc12 . in both cases , the calculated values of",
    "@xmath1 reproduce the experimental data within a few hundred kev , when mbe is taken into account .",
    "the values of @xmath1 and @xmath86 in @xmath7-states also can be reproduced well by the hyperamd , when the ada is modified so as to make input values of @xmath75 slightly larger for weakly - bound @xmath5 states .",
    "though the results for esc14 and esc12 are quite similar to each other , the strength of mpp repulsion included in mbe for esc12 is far weaker than that for esc14 : the former ( esc14 ) is strong enough to give rise to the stiff eos of hyperon - mixed neutron star - matter , but the latter ( esc12 ) is not .    in the present",
    ", it is difficult to prove the existence of mbe including strong repulsion on the basis of the experimental data of @xmath1 , because the two - body interaction model is not finely determined .",
    "however , we can say at least as follows : the possible existence of the strong hyperonic repulsions suggested by the stiff eos of neutron stars is compatible with @xmath3 interaction models giving almost vanishing contributions of @xmath2-state interactions ."
