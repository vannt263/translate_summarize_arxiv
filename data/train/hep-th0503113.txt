    "this is the sequel to our previous papers @xcite and intends to investigate further properties of our model arising from an interplay between @xmath1 supersymmetry and nonabelian gauge symmetry . in ref @xcite , we have successfully constructed the @xmath1 supersymmetric @xmath0 gauge model in four spacetime dimensions , generalizing the abelian self - interacting model given some time ago in ref @xcite .",
    "the gauging of @xmath0 isometry associated with the special khler geometry , and the discrete @xmath6 symmetry are the primary ingredients of our construction .",
    "the model spontaneously breaks @xmath1 supersymmetry to @xmath2 .",
    "the second supersymmetry realized on the broken phase acts as an approximate fermionic @xmath7 shift symmetry .",
    "this , combined with the notion of prepotential as an input function , tells that the model should be interpreted as a low energy effective action ( leea ) designed to apply microscopic calculation invoking spectral riemann surfaces@xcite , matrix models ( see @xcite for a recent review ) and/or string theory@xcite to various physical processes .",
    "although we will not investigate in this paper , it is interesting to try to find the origin of and the role played by the three parameters of our model @xmath8 and @xmath9 in the developments beginning with the work of @xcite .",
    "connection to various compactification schemes of strings , branes and m theory@xcite is anticipated and some work along this direction has already appeared @xcite .",
    "partial spontaneous breaking of extended supersymmetries appears not possible from the consideration of the algebra among the supercharges .",
    "the basic mechanism enabling the partial breaking is in fact a modification of the local version of the extended supersymmetry algebra by an additional spacetime independent term which forms a matrix with respect to extended indices @xcite : \\ { |q_^j,_i^m ( x ) } = 2(^n ) _",

    "( see ( [ potential4.14 ] ) . )",
    "once these are established , it is easy to see that partial breaking of extended supersymmetries is a reality : after ninety degree rotation , the vacuum annihilates half of the supercharges while the remaining half takes nonvanishing and in fact infinite ( @xmath11 ) matrix elements .    the thrust of the present paper is to explore vacua of the model in which the @xmath0 gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken to various product gauge groups and to compute the mass spectrum on the @xmath2 vacua as a function of input data , which are the prepotential derivatives and @xmath12 and @xmath9 . in the next section , we review the @xmath13 supersymmetric @xmath0 gauge model .",
