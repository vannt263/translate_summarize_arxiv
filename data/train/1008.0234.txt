    "anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) have been distinguished from the other type of pulsars by their peculiarity such as a long spin period of a neutron star ( @xmath6212  s ) and moderately bright x - ray emission with @xmath7  erg  s@xmath2 that is in general much greater than the spin - down luminosity of the neutron star ( @xmath8  erg  s@xmath2 ) .",
    "since there is no evidence of mass accretion , it has been thought that the x - ray emission is replenished with magnetic energy of the neutron star . as a matter of fact , the magnetic field strength , estimated on the basis of the dipole radiation framework , of the axps with known @xmath0 is all in excess of the critical magnetic field @xmath9  g , above which the differential energy of the neighboring landau levels exceeds the rest mass energy of an electron .",
    "the axps , together with soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) , are now classified as so - called `` magnetars '' @xcite . as of june 9 , 2010 , 10 axps and 9 sgrs",
    "have been known .",
    "it is , however , still unclear how such extraordinary nature are endowed to the magnetars , compared with the other conventional pulsars .",
    "one of the difficulties is that only a few magnetars are found associated with host supernova remnants ( snrs ) that provide us with information on their progenitors , independent age estimation , and so on .",
    "obviously we need more magnetar samples with the snr association .",
    "is discovered in the course of identifying galactic tev sources . @xcite",
    "discovered the tev source hess  j1713@xmath10381 with the atmospheric cherenkov telescope h.e.s.s . and indicated its association with the supernova remnant ( snr ) ctb37b . using data ,",
    "identified the point source in the radio shell of ctb37b @xcite .",
    "its location is slightly offset ( @xmath11 ) from the peak of the h.e.s.s .",
    "brightness contour ( see fig .  2 of @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite observed ctb37b with @xcite , and found that its spectrum is represented well by a power law with a photon index of @xmath12 .",
    "the hydrogen column density to ( @xmath114@xmath13  @xmath14 ) is consistent with that of diffuse thermal emission of ctb37b , which strengthens the association of to the snr .",
    "the distance to this snr is estimated to be 10.2@xmath153.5  kpc , and we cite this value in this paper .",
    "these facts lead them to conclude that is probably a new axp , although limited time resolution of the xis ( 8  s : @xcite ) onboard in the full - frame mode and the acis ( 3.24  s : @xcite ) onboard in the imaging mode preclude them to detect pulsation .",
    "@xcite finally discovered using the cc mode observation data that pulsates at the period of 3.82305@xmath150.00002  s on 2009 january 25 , which is well within the range of the axp pulse period .",
    "the pulse shape is sinusoidal with a pulse fraction of 31% .",
    "they also detected an excess emission above the power - law spectrum above @xmath166  kev , which is one of the common features among the axps .    to further strengthen the identification of as an axp , it is important to measure @xmath0",
    ". the known @xmath0 of axps exceeds @xmath17",
    "s  s@xmath2 , which is systematically larger than the other rotation - powered pulsars . furthermore , under the dipole radiation assumption",
    ", we are able to estimate the strength of the magnetic field , which is important to see if is a magnetar . in order to evaluate @xmath0 ,",
    "we have carried out an observation of ctb37b with .",
    "monitoring x - ray flux is also important , since most magnetars show x - ray time variability .",
    "@xcite showed that its flux changed between and observations , although low spatial resolution prevented us to conclude this source showed the time variability since there could be contamination of diffuse nonthermal x - rays , which is quite common in young snrs @xcite . in   2 ,",
    "we describe how the observation and data screening have been carried out . in   3 , we present the results of our timing and spectral analysis .",
    "we have clearly detected pulsation from the source .",
    "compared with the pulse period @xcite , we detected @xmath0 significantly .",
    "we calculate the characteristic age and the magnetic field strength in ",
    "4 and argue that should be regarded as a new magnetar .",
    "the observation of the snr ctb37b was carried out from 2010 march 17 13:16 ( ut ) to march 18 23:06 ( ut ) .",
    "our primary objective is timing analysis to determine the physical parameter of .",
    "hence , we concentrate on data taken with the epic pn whose time resolution is 73.4  ms , which is much better than epic mos ( 2.6 s ; ) . we have carried out the data analysis with sas ver 9.0.0 .",
    "we have first checked the background flare using the cleaned event file pipe - line - processed with the ccf dated on 2010 april 30 in the data package .",
    "we have extracted a light curve in the band 1012  kev , and produced a gti file that excludes time intervals with a 1012 counting rate of @xmath180.35 c  s@xmath2 .",
    "we then have revised the event file by applying this gti file . as a result ,",
    "the effective exposure time became 40.264 ks .",
    "using the new event file thus processed , we have constructed a pn image in the band 110  kev , as shown in fig .",

    "the non - thermal diffuse emission extending to the south from @xcite is also detected .",
    "the small green circle , with a radius of , is the extraction region of the source photons , whereas the other dashed circle , with a radius of is that for the background .",
    "the intensity of is 0.264@xmath150.003 c  s@xmath2 in the 110  kev band after subtracting the background .",

    "we can see deeply absorbed and hard emission .",
    "we have fitted an absorbed power - law model to the data .",
    "the metal composition of @xcite is adopted as the solar abundance for the absorbing material .",
    "the fit is accepted with @xmath21/d.o.f .",
    "of 372.34/341 .",
    "the best - fit photon index , the hydrogen column density , and the observed and intrinsic flux in the 2.0 - 10.0  kev band are @xmath22 , @xmath23  @xmath14 , @xmath24  erg  @xmath14s@xmath2 , and @xmath25  erg  @xmath14s@xmath2 , respectively ( the errors represent single - parameter 90% confidence limit ) .",
    "we can see positive residuals above @xmath165  kev , which is probably the hard tail which is common among the magnetars @xcite .",
    "detailed spectral analysis will be presented in the forthcoming paper .",
    "since there is nearly no source flux below @xmath161  kev , we have carried out timing analysis in the band 110  kev .",
    "after barycentric correction to the event file , we have created a light curve with the minimum time resolution ( 73.4  ms ) , and have first made a power spectrum in the frequency range below 0.5  hz .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",

    "we then have carried out epoch folding analysis near this frequency .",
    "the resultant periodogram is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : timing](b ) .",
    "the rotational period is obtained to be @xmath27  s. no other period except for the harmonics were significant .",
    "compared to the period obtained from the cc mode data @xcite , 3.82305@xmath150.00002  s , the period becomes longer by 0.00230@xmath150.00005  s. the time has elapsed since the observation ( beginning at 2009 jan 25 06:55:08 ) by 416.264676  d , thereby the average period derivative is obtained to be @xmath28 s  s@xmath2 .",
    "figure  [ fig : timing](c ) shows the light curve folded at the best spin period .",
    "the pulse profile is similar to that obtained by @xcite including the pulse fraction .",
    "from the timing analysis of the pn data , we have obtained @xmath29 s  s@xmath2 . together with @xmath30  s",
    ", we can derive the spin - down luminosity ( @xmath31  erg  s@xmath2 ) , characteristic age ( @xmath32  s ) , and the dipole surface magnetic field ( @xmath33  g ) to be @xmath34  ergs  s@xmath2 , @xmath35  yr , and @xmath36  g , respectively .",
    "all these estimated parameters are within the range of the known axps , and we thus conclude that is a new magnetar , together with the large photon index of its spectrum .",
    "the ratio of 210  kev luminosity ( @xmath37 ) to @xmath38 is 0.4 , which is much smaller than the typical magnetars .",
    "psr  j1846@xmath100258 is a radio pulsar with @xmath39 larger than the critical magnetic field which shows the @xmath40 of 0.2 @xcite including its pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) , and should be a key source to connect magnetars and conventional radio pulsars . thus closely resembles psr  j1846@xmath100258 and a new key source between magnetars and radio pulsars .",
    "note that this source is the youngest axp and the second youngest magnetar so far , in the next place of sgr  1806@xmath1020 ( @xmath41 kyr ; @xcite ) .",
    "another important point is that this magnetar is associated with a young snr .",
    "@xcite obtained the ionization age of the thermal plasma associated with ctb37b is @xmath42  yr .",
    "possible association of ctb37b with the historical snr sn  393 has long been discussed @xcite .",
    "the characteristic age we obtained is consistent with these discussions .",
    "@xcite discovered a pulsar wind nebula around the second youngest axp , 1e  1547.0@xmath105408 ( @xmath43 kyr : @xcite ) .",
    "is now a good target to search for a pwn , which will be a future work with better spatial resolution .",
    "this will lead to better understanding of the young magnetars .",
    "some magnetars show x - ray flares and long term variability , and hence we have investigated whether has x - ray time variability .",
