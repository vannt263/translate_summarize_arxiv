    "the ability to carry out no - core configuration interaction calculations of light nuclei , in the no - core shell model ( ncsm )  @xcite , has made a significant contribution to recent progress in the _ ab initio _ description of nuclei .",
    "however , the dimensionality of the nuclear model space becomes computationally prohibitive as the number of active nucleons and orbitals increases .",
    "symmetry can play a significant role in addressing this problem , by assisting in the selection of the physically relevant portions of the model space .",
    "elliott  @xcite explored the @xmath3 symmetry of the harmonic oscillator , which serves as an organizational scheme for quadrupole deformation and rotation in the nuclear shell model .",
    "the @xmath4 algebra of the oscillator is contained in a larger @xmath2 algebra , which is found to have a close connection both to the dominant components of the nuclear hamiltonian and to nuclear collective motion  @xcite .",
    "following the discovery of evidence for @xmath0 and @xmath2 symmetry in the nuclear eigenstates obtained in conventional ncsm calculations for light nuclei  @xcite , the ncsm has been reformulated in terms of an @xmath0-based model space , in the @xmath0 no - core shell model [ @xmath0-ncsm ]  @xcite .",
    "this development provides the foundations for future realization of a symplectic no - core shell model ( sp - ncsm )  @xcite , making full use of @xmath2 symmetry .    in predicting physical properties of the nucleus , only the intrinsic dynamics of the nucleus",
    "is of interest , not the center - of - mass motion . in principle",
    ", the center - of - mass motion may be eliminated from the problem by explicitly changing variables to relative coordinates .",
    "however , the nuclear many - body state must be antisymmetrized , and with increasing nucleon number this process rapidly becomes prohibitive in relative coordinates  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , for a many - body basis constructed from antisymmetrized products of single - particle states , as in the ncsm , antisymmetrization is straightforward , but both center - of - mass ( spurious ) and intrinsic excitations are included in the model space  @xcite . consequently many of the nuclear eigenstates obtained by diagonalizing the hamiltonian will carry center - of - mass excitation .",
    "moreover , exact factorization of the many - body wave function into center - of - mass and intrinsic parts   _ i.e. _ , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 depends on the center - of - mass coordinate , and @xmath7 depends on relative coordinates @xmath8 and intrinsic spin degrees of freedom   is obtained only within certain specific truncations of the model space . in the context of the conventional ncsm , for which the basis is constructed from antisymmetrized products of oscillator wave functions ,",
    "factorization is obtained if truncation is carried out according to the @xmath9 scheme , that is , by the total number of oscillator quanta for the many - body state  @xcite . within the @xmath0-ncsm , factorization",
    "is also retained in model spaces which have furthermore been truncated according to @xmath0 and spin quantum numbers ( see section  [ sec - cmf ] ) .",
    "otherwise , factorization of intrinsic and center - of - mass wave functions is in general incomplete , in which case all eigenstates contain some spurious contribution , presenting challenges for the study of the intrinsic excitations ( _ e.g. _ , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    the usual approach to addressing the problem of spurious states",
    "consists of modifying the nuclear _ hamiltonian _ , working within a model space which supports factorization , by adding a lawson term  @xcite proportional the harmonic oscillator hamiltonian @xmath10 for the center - of - mass coordinate .",
    "after diagonalization , the spurious states remain in the spectrum but are shifted to an excitation energy above the low - lying intrinsic states of interest",
    ". however , the other possibility is to modify the _ model space _ , so as to explicitly remove the entire space of spurious states , before the hamiltonian is diagonalized .",
    "this approach may be made feasible through the use of @xmath0 symmetry  @xcite .",
    "after the spurious states are removed , the remaining center - of - mass free ( cmf ) states form a suitable model space for describing the intrinsic dynamics of the nucleus .",
    "the cmf states are associated with the lowest eigenvalue of the center - of - mass hamiltonian @xmath10 and thus possess a harmonic oscillator @xmath11 wave function in the center - of - mass degrees of freedom .",
    "they also therefore constitute the null space of the center - of - mass harmonic oscillator lowering operator @xmath1 .",
    "the approach developed here for isolating the cmf space is based on solution of the null - space problem for this operator , formulated at the level of subspaces of definite @xmath0 symmetry and intrinsic spin .",
    "a principal motivation is to enable exact separation of center - of - mass dynamics in extensions to the @xmath0-ncsm , in particular the sp - ncsm .",
    "the many - body basis for the @xmath0-ncsm is the starting point for defining the basis for the sp - ncsm  @xcite .",
    "briefly , an @xmath2 irreducible representation ( irrep ) is constructed from an extremal @xmath0 state  @xcite , _ i.e. _ , possessing the fewest oscillator quanta .",
    "other states within the irrep are constructed by acting on this extremal state with an @xmath0-coupled product @xmath12^{(\\lambda\\mu)}$ ] , where @xmath13 is the translationally - invariant @xmath2 raising operator .",
    "each application of @xmath13 contributes two oscillator quanta to the system .",
    "since the action of @xmath13 does not introduce center - of - mass excitation , an @xmath2 irrep is free of center - of - mass excitation as long as it is built from an extremal @xmath0 state which is free of such excitation .",
    "the present results therefore provide the foundation for obtaining the cmf model space for the sp - ncsm .    the construction of the @xmath0-ncsm basis , before removal of spurious contributions ,",
    "is first outlined ( section  [ sec - su3 ] ) .",
    "we then introduce an algorithm for identification of the cmf subspace within the @xmath0-ncsm model space , based on constructing the matrix representation of @xmath1 between @xmath0-coupled subspaces and solving for its null space ( section  [ sec - cmf ] ) . finally , we summarize the dimensions obtained for cmf @xmath0 subspaces in representative light nuclei ( section  [ sec - calc ] ) .",
    "preliminary results were reported in ref .",
    "the many - body basis states for the @xmath0-ncsm have good @xmath14 quantum numbers , where the @xmath0 symmetry label @xmath15 characterizes the spatial degrees of freedom , according to the elliott classification , while the @xmath16 label @xmath17 describes the total intrinsic spin angular momentum .",
    "the creation operator for a nucleon in a given major oscillator shell @xmath18 comprises an @xmath14 tensor @xmath19 , where the labels denote @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "the operators @xmath19 are then used as the fundamental units in building up an @xmath14-coupled nuclear state .",
    "specifically , each @xmath0-ncsm basis state is characterized by a definite distribution of nucleons over the major shells .",
    "first , all nucleons in the each major shell @xmath18 are combined to form a configuration of the type @xmath21^{(\\lambda_{{\\eta}}\\mu_{{\\eta}})s_{{\\eta}}}}}}$ ] , with good @xmath14 coupling  @xcite , separately for the protons and neutrons . then , such configurations for individual major shells are coupled successively to form a total proton state and total neutron state carrying good @xmath14 quantum numbers . finally ,",
    "the proton state and neutron state are coupled , to give the @xmath0-ncsm basis state . since the major shells have definite occupations , the state may be classified , as usual in the oscillator basis for the ncsm  @xcite , by the number @xmath22 of harmonic oscillator excitations , taken relative to the minimal number of oscillator quanta possible for the given number of protons and neutrons .",
    "the resulting @xmath0-ncsm basis state has the form , with all coupling labels shown explicitly , @xmath23 here the symbol @xmath24 represents the labels @xmath25\\alpha(\\lambda\\mu)s$ ] needed to completely specify the coupling of nucleons of type @xmath26 ( _ i.e. _ , protons or neutrons ) within major shell @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "specifically , each major shell has associated with it a @xmath27 algebra [ @xmath28 consisting of bilinears of creation and annihilation operators , for which the irreps are labeled by @xmath29 $ ] , where we consider only antisymmetric irreps , and @xmath30 equals the occupation of the shell . within a @xmath27 irrep",
    ", a multiplicity index @xmath31 is required to distinguish @xmath14 irreps with the same quantum numbers @xmath32 , yielding the labeling scheme @xmath33 }   \\subqn{~~\\supset~~}{\\alpha }    \\subqn{\\grpsu{3}}{(\\lambda\\mu)}\\times\\subqn{\\grpsu{2}}{s}.\\ ] ] the symbols @xmath34 in  ( [ eqn : su3xsu2_basis_states ] ) then indicate the @xmath14 coupling labels [ @xmath35 of successive shells , and @xmath36 denotes the multiplicity index for this coupling .",
    "finally we have total couplings @xmath37 for the protons , @xmath38 for the neutrons , and @xmath39 for the entire basis state , with corresponding multiplicity indices @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "the expression in  ( [ eqn : su3xsu2_basis_states ] ) represents not just a single state but an entire set of states , with various values for the quantum numbers associated with the branching of @xmath14 into angular momentum subalgebras : the orbital ( spatial ) angular momentum @xmath43 , the inner multiplicity @xmath44 for this @xmath43 within the @xmath0 irrep @xmath15 , and the total angular momentum @xmath45 , as well as its @xmath46-projection @xmath47 .",
    "however , these states share the same `` internal '' microscopic structure , given by the same couplings of the particles at the level of @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , they may be thought of as a single _ reduced state _ for certain purposes , in particular , evaluation of reduced matrix elements under the @xmath14 wigner - eckart theorem and , as we shall see , identification of cmf linear combinations .",
    "the analogy is to angular momentum theory , where one may consider the states @xmath48 , for different @xmath47 , to be substates of a single state @xmath49 , more formally , a tensorial set or @xmath16 irrep .",
    "the separation of the many - body space into cmf and spurious parts simplifies in the context of an @xmath14-coupled basis , since the process may be carried out independently within subspaces characterized by definite @xmath14 quantum numbers . to start with , the center - of - mass hamiltonian @xmath10 does not connect states involving different numbers @xmath22 of oscillator excitations , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath50=0 $ ] .",
    "it is due to this property that the usual @xmath9 truncation scheme for the ncsm  @xcite permits an exact factorization of center - of - mass and intrinsic wave functions .",
    "truncation is to many - body states with @xmath51 . for ncsm calculations with parity - conserving interactions , the two parity subspaces , obtained for @xmath22 even or odd , respectively ,",
    "may furthermore be considered separately . ]",
    "this property also implies that the separation of cmf states may be carried out separately within the space of states with each specific number of oscillator quanta , which we denote by @xmath52 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath10 commutes with the @xmath0 generators and may therefore be diagonalized within a subspace with good @xmath0 quantum numbers  @xcite . as an operator acting only on spatial degrees of freedom , @xmath10 also commutes with the total spin operators for protons and neutrons , as well as their combined spin operator .",
    "thus , collecting these properties , the separation of cmf states may be carried out separately within subspaces of given @xmath22 , @xmath15 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath17 , which we denote by @xmath55 $ ] .    in considering how to extract cmf states",
    ", we note that these states are defined by their relation to the center - of - mass harmonic oscillator raising and lowering operators .",
    "the center - of - mass raising operator @xmath56 , which is an @xmath57 operator , furthermore constitutes an @xmath0 @xmath58 tensor , with components @xmath59 .",
    "this operator may be written in terms of single - particle harmonic - oscillator raising operators @xmath60 as  @xcite @xmath61 the corresponding lowering operator @xmath1 similarly has the form @xmath62 the center - of - mass harmonic oscillator hamiltonian is built from these operators as @xmath63 where the dot indicates a spherical tensor scalar product .",
    "the cmf states are then defined by the property that they have no center - of - mass excitations , _",
    "i.e. _ , they have zero eigenvalue for the center - of - mass number operator @xmath64 .",
    "equivalently , however , they are identified by the property that they are annihilated by the center - of - mass lowering operator @xmath1",
    ".    either of these criteria allow the problem of identifying cmf states to be formulated as a null - space problem .",
    "we seek the subspace @xmath65 $ ] of @xmath55 $ ] consisting of states @xmath66 such that @xmath67 or , equivalently , @xmath68 . in practice , this means first representing the operator as a matrix with respect to the @xmath0-ncsm basis and then solving for a complete set of null vectors of this matrix .",
    "the result yields new basis states , for @xmath65 $ ] , as linear combinations of the original basis states , for @xmath55 $ ] .    although we could in principle search for the null space of either @xmath69 or @xmath1 , there is a practical advantage to working with @xmath1 .",
    "while @xmath69 is a two - body operator , @xmath1 is simply a one - body operator .",
    "consequently , evaluation of matrix elements is computationally less involved .",
    "note that @xmath69 acts within the space @xmath52 , _",
    "i.e. _ , conserving the number of oscillator excitations , but @xmath1 connects the space @xmath52 to the next lower space @xmath70 , which is significantly smaller in dimension than @xmath52 . one might therefore expect the null space problem for @xmath1 to be of lower dimensionality than that for @xmath69 , namely , involving a matrix of the same column dimension ( @xmath71 ) but lower row dimension ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "however , this simple relation of dimensions is modified once @xmath0 selection rules are considered ( see below ) , and in practice the difference in dimensionality of the two problems is largely eliminated .",
    "the problem of identifying cmf states is simplified by the realization that it may be formulated entirely at the level of reduced states .",
    "recall that @xmath10 commutes with the @xmath0 generators , which connect states within an irrep .",
    "consequently , an @xmath14-reduced state is cmf if and only if its substates , labeled by @xmath73 ( and @xmath47 ) , are all cmf .",
    "we need thus only find a basis of @xmath14-_reduced _ states , for @xmath65 $ ] , independent of @xmath74 .",
    "we also need only consider the @xmath14-_reduced _ matrix elements of the operator @xmath1 , rather than the matrix elements among individual @xmath74 substates , which are much greater in number .",

    "[ fig - cmf - dim-2h-3h ] .",
    "consequently , we examine the cmf fractions , _ i.e. _ , the ratio @xmath135)/(\\dim w_{{{n_\\text{ex}}}}[(\\lambda\\mu)s_{{p}}s_{{n}}s])$ ] , separately in fig .",
    "[ fig - cmf - ratio - combo ] , for these same nuclei .",
    "as already noted , the cmf fractions decrease with increasing @xmath22 and approach unity , for a given @xmath22 , with increasing mass .",
    "however , within each @xmath22 space , demarcated by vertical dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig - cmf - ratio - combo ] , a further dominant trend may be noticed in the variation of cmf fractions among the @xmath14 subspaces . it is observed that the spurious states are preferentially found in the subspaces with @xmath0 quantum numbers corresponding to the lowest values of the @xmath0 second - order casimir invariant @xmath136 , while the cmf states are preferentially found in the subspaces corresponding to the highest eigenvalues of @xmath136 . in fig .",
    "[ fig - cmf - ratio - combo ] ( as well as in figs .",
    "[ fig - cmf - dim-2h-3h ] and  [ fig - dim - combo ] ) , within each @xmath52 , the @xmath0 irrep labels @xmath15 are ordered from left to right by increasing eigenvalue of @xmath136 ( given by @xmath137 ) , where labels which are degenerate with respect to @xmath136 are then ordered by increasing @xmath138 .",
    "the lowest cmf fractions are ( predominantly ) found at left , and the highest ( predominantly ) at right . while some evidence may be seen for patterns in the distribution with respect to the spin labels , these are not as clear or consistent .",
    "so far , we have considered dimensions at the level of @xmath14-reduced basis states .",
    "we may also deduce from these the full and cmf dimensions in terms of @xmath45-coupled states .",
    "although much of the computational process in an @xmath0-ncsm calculation can be carried out in terms of @xmath14-reduced states , and it is these reduced states which are relevant to the definition of the sp - ncsm model space , the hamiltonian matrix in an @xmath0-ncsm calculation must ultimately be realized in terms of basis states of definite angular momentum @xmath45 .",
    "as outlined in section  [ sec - su3 ] , the @xmath45 states are obtained by first branching each @xmath14-reduced state  ( [ eqn : su3xsu2_basis_states ] ) to states of definite orbital angular momentum @xmath43 .",
    "the @xmath43 values contained within an @xmath0 irrep @xmath15 are given by the @xmath139 branching rule  @xcite .",
    ", states are obtained with @xmath140 , with the exception that @xmath141 if @xmath142 .",
    "] then @xmath43 is coupled with @xmath17 to yield states of total angular momentum @xmath45 according to the usual coupling rules for angular momentum addition .",
    "the dimensions of the resulting @xmath45-spaces   both the full space and its cmf portion   are shown for several light nuclei in fig .",
    "[ fig - dim - cmf - combo](b , c ) , for @xmath118 and @xmath119 , respectively .",
    "although the dimensions of the @xmath45-spaces are calculated here via the @xmath14 coupling scheme , the results obtained are generally applicable to any @xmath45-coupled scheme for the ncsm , in an @xmath9 truncation .",
    "the separation or elimination of spurious center - of - mass excitations is essential to the problem of determining the intrinsic structure of nuclei .",
    "if an @xmath0-coupled harmonic oscillator basis is used for the many - body problem , as in the @xmath0-ncsm , the separation may be carried out at the level of @xmath0 irreps , in particular , within subspaces of fixed number of oscillator quanta and @xmath143 labels .",
    "we have formulated the problem of finding the cmf subspace as a matrix null - space problem , based on the @xmath14-reduced matrix elements of the center - of - mass annihilation operator , which is solved independently for each @xmath14 subspace of the full model space .",
    "it is therefore possible to remove spurious contributions from the @xmath0-ncsm model space _",
    "prior _ to diagonalization of the hamiltonian , rather than through a lawson term . in the context of the @xmath0-ncsm _",
    "per se _ , this raises the possibility of substantial reductions in dimensionality of the problem , principally in the high @xmath22 subspaces of lighter nuclei",
    ".    however , a more essential application lies in providing the foundation for ensuring exact separation of center - of - mass and intrinsic dynamics , or removal of spurious contributions , in the sp - ncsm .",
    "the purpose of the sp - ncsm is to incorporate physically relevant portions of the model space extending to much higher numbers of oscillator quanta , beyond those which can be practically reached if one must retain the complete @xmath130 subspaces of the @xmath0-ncsm .",
    "however , factorization of center - of - mass and intrinsic wave functions is still guaranteed if the @xmath2 basis is constructed starting from @xmath0-ncsm extremal states which are free of spurious excitation .",
    "the present approach may also serve as the starting point for eliminating spurious admixtures in other extensions to the @xmath0-ncsm , such as an adaptation of the importance truncation scheme  @xcite to the @xmath0-ncsm .",
