    "cosmological models using irreversible thermodynamics along with einstein s general relativity ( gr ) have recently gained great interest among cosmologists . with this new perspective , it is possible to analyze different cosmological models which have blockages in equilibrium thermodynamic set - up .",
    "eling , guedens and jacobson @xcite first introduced irreversible thermodynamics in cosmology after he failed to reproduce einstein s field equations from the first law of thermodynamics in @xmath0-gravity and concluded that a non - equilibrium thermodynamic treatment is essential for curvature correction to entropy .",
    "they added an extra entropy term @xmath1 called entropy production term in the entropy balance equation @xmath2 , where they have argued @xmath1 as the bulk viscosity production term which can be determined by imposing energy - momentum conservation . in general , the entropy balance relation in non equilibrium thermodynamics is of the form @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the rate of entropy exchange with the surroundings while @xmath1 ( @xmath5 ) comes from the process occuring inside the system .",
    "in particular , @xmath1 is zero for a reversible process and positive for an irreversible process . in cosmology",
    ", @xmath1 has no clear interpretation as it depends on the internal production process .",
    "this term has been identified as a dissipative effect by exploiting a fluid dynamics description of the local causal horizon kinematics while considering irreversible thermodynamics .",
    "subsequently , a lot of work have been done in order to interpret the entropy production term in various ways . in 2009 ,",
    "g. chirco and s. liberati @xcite , have shown that the dissipative character leading to non - equilibrium spacetime thermodynamics is actually related ( both in gr as well as in @xmath6gravity ) to non - local heat fluxes associated with the purely gravitational / internal degrees of freedom of the theory .",
    "in particular , in the case of gr they showed that the internal entropy production term is identical to the so called tidal heating term of hawking - hartle @xcite .",
    "similarly , for the case of @xmath0-gravity , the dissipative effects can be associated with the generalization of this term plus a scalar contribution whose presence is clearly justified within the scalar - tensor representation of the theory .",
    "two most profound mysterious components of matter present in the universe are dark energy ( de ) and dark matter ( dm ) . according to recent observational data obtained from type ia supernova",
    ", our universe is now experiencing an accelerated expansion .",
    "this late time cosmic acceleration is interpreted by the existence of de which is believed to have a huge negative pressure and therefore it is gravitationally repulsive .",
    "a common and natural candidate for de is the cosmological constant but it is not widely used in the literature due to its limitations and drawbacks .",
    "several alternative dynamical de models have been proposed but the nature of de ( except that it has a huge negative pressure ) is still a mystery . on the other hand ,",
    "the behaviour of galatic rotation curves and the mass discrepancy in the cluster of galaxies are interpreted by the existence of dm which unlike de , is gravitationally attractive in nature . as we know",
    "that de is homogeneously distributed while dm is inhomogenously distributed , occuring in clumps around ordinary matter .",
    "interaction between these two dark components is expected to be weak or even negligible .",
    "still , the effect of interaction between them on universal dynamics can not be ruled out .",
    "in fact , recently it has been argued by wang et al .",
    "@xcite that an appropriate interaction between de and dm plays a significant role in perturbation dynamics and affect the lowest multipole of the cmb sprectum .",
    "harko and lobo @xcite have also investigated the interaction between de and dm in the context of irreversible thermodynamics of open systems with matter creation / annihilation . in this connection",
    ", it should be mentioned that the thermodynamics of irreversible processes was introduced in cosmology by prigogine et al .",
    "@xcite .    in our present work ,",
    "we have investigated non - equilibrium thermodynamics of the universe bounded by event horizon .",
    "we have examined the entropy production term by considering the non - equilibrium process of particle ( de / dm ) creation / annihilation as the internal production process .",
    "here we have considered an isentropic system consisting of two interacting dark fluids .",
    "karami and gaffari @xcite have examined the validity of the generalized second law of thermodynamics ( gslt ) in a non - flat frw universe containing interacting de with cold dm in irreversible thermodynamical context and they have shown that gslt is satisfied for certain range of energy - transfer constants . here",
    "we have employed the theory of particle creation for describing interaction between de and dm and examined the validity of gslt for universe bounded by the event horizon .",
    "suppose a closed thermodynamical system with @xmath7 particles have internal energy @xmath8 .",
    "the conservation of this internal energy gives rise to the first law of thermodynamics as @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the usual thermodynamic pressure and comoving volume and @xmath12 stands for the amount of heat received by the system in time @xmath13 .",
    "equivalently , we have the gibbs equation as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the entropy per particle , @xmath16 is the energy density , @xmath17 is the particle number density and @xmath18 is the heat per unit particle .",
    "it should be noted that the above gibbs equation is true for an open thermodynamical system for which the number of fluid particles is not conserved @xmath19 .",
    "this can be expressed mathematically as @xmath20 here @xmath21 is the particle flow vector , @xmath22 is the particle four - velocity , @xmath23 is the fluid expansion , @xmath24 stands for the rate of change of the particle number in a comoving volume @xmath11 and @xmath25 by notation .",
    "@xmath24 effectively behaves as a bulk viscous pressure which causes the thermodynamics to be non - equilibrium .",
    "@xmath26 indicates creation of particles while annihilation of particles correspond to @xmath27 .    in the present work",
    ", we consider an open thermodynamical system to be flat frw model of the universe with particle creation characterizing the non - equilibrium phenomenon .",
    "suppose that the universe consists of two dark fluids namely dm and de .",
    "the einstein field equations are ( choosing @xmath28 ) @xmath29 and @xmath30 and the energy conservation equations are given by @xmath31 and @xmath32 where @xmath33 are respectively energy density , thermodynamic pressure and dissipative ( bulk ) pressure of dm and @xmath34 are those of de .",
    "the particle number conservation equations are modified as @xmath35 and @xmath36 where @xmath37 are the number density and particle creation rate for dm while @xmath38 are those for de .",
    "we have assumed that @xmath39 and @xmath40 so that dm particles are created while de particles are destroyed , as predicted by the second law of thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "if for simplicity , we assume the thermodynamical system to be isentropic ( i.e. , entropy per particle is conserved ) , then the dissipative pressures and the particle creation rates are related as @xcite @xmath41 and @xmath42 however , if the combined two - fluid is considered as a single fluid with energy density @xmath43 , thermodynamic pressure @xmath44 and dissipative pressure @xmath45 , then combining ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) , we have the usual conservation equation @xmath46 also , combining ( 8) and ( 9 ) we can write @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the total particle number density and @xmath49 is the particle creation rate of the single fluid .",
    "further , if we assume the resulting single fluid to be isentropic , then we have @xmath50 using ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) in ( 14 ) , we obtain @xmath51 the sign of @xmath49 indicates whether there is a creation or an annihilation of particles of the resulting single fluid .",
    "it should be noted that if @xmath52 , then equations ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) imply interacting dark fluids with interaction term @xmath53 and the single fluid corresponds to a closed system as @xmath54 .",
    "due to the observational evidences of the present late - time acceleration , the universe is currently dominated by a dark fluid system ( dm+de ) . the energy conservation relations for the subsystems",
    "are given by equations ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) respectively .",
    "due to the particle creation mechanism , there is an energy transfer between the dark species and as a result , the two subsystems have different temperatures and thermodynamics of irreversible process comes into the picture .",
    "thus , starting from the euler s thermodynamical relation @xmath55 and using the energy conservation equations ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) as well as the modified particle number conservation relations ( 8) and ( 9 ) for the two dark subsystems , the evolution equations for the temperatures of the individual dark fluid elements are given by @xmath56 and @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 here , @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) and @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) are the equations of state parameters for dm and de respectively and @xmath64 are respectively the temperature of the two dark components . as for simplicity , the thermodynamical process is assumed to be adiabatic , so the effective bulk pressures @xmath65 and @xmath66 are respectively related to the corresponding particle creation rates by eqs .",
    "( 10 ) and ( 11 ) . now integrating eqs . ( 16 ) and ( 17 ) , we have the temperatures of the two dark sectors as @xmath67\\ ] ] and @xmath68,\\ ] ] where @xmath69 is the common temperature of the two subsystems in equilibrium configuration and @xmath70 is the value of the scale factor in the equilibrium state . it should be noted that at the very early stages of the evolution of the universe , @xmath71 and with the evolution of the universe , both the subsystems approach the equilibrium configuration ( @xmath72 ) with common temperature @xmath69 . then for @xmath73,the thermodynamical equilibrium is violated due to the continuous flow of de to dm and as a result we have @xmath74 . in the present case , we are considering universe bounded by the event horizon as an isolated thermodynamical system and so in the equilibrium state the temperature @xmath69 may be considered as the ( modified ) hawking temperature @xcite on the event horizon , i.e. , @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the radius of the event horizon for the frw model .",
    "further , for thermodynamical analysis , we denote @xmath77 and @xmath78 as the entropies of the two dark sectors of the present isolated system while @xmath79 stands for the entropy of the bounding event horizon .",
    "then , from the first law ( i.e. , clausius relation ) for individual subsystems , we have @xmath80 and @xmath81 in the above expressions , @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the energies of the two subsystems while @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the amount of heat of the two dark sectors and @xmath86 is the volume of the universe bounded by the two subsystems .",
    "due to the isolated nature of the whole system , the heat flow across the horizon ( @xmath87 ) is balanced by the heat flow through the two dark components , i.e. , @xmath88 however , in view of non - equilibrium thermodynamical prescription one has to take care of the contributions from irreversible fluxes of energy transfer in the expression for the total entropy variation as @xcite @xmath89 where @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the energy transfer constants between de and dm within the universe and between the universe and the horizon respectively .    here",
    "our universe is described by a 4@xmath92dimensional flat frw model bounded by an event horizon . normally in frw spacetime ,",
    "event horizon does not exist .",
    "it is relevant only when the universe is in an accelerating phase .",
    "so in the perspective of the present accelerating phase of the universe , it is reasonable to consider universe bounded by the event horizon as an open thermodynamical system . for event horizon",
    ", the area radius has the expression @xmath93 ( note that the above improper integral exists when the universe is in an accelerating phase ) and variation of @xmath76 with respect to cosmic time @xmath94 gives @xmath95 also , let us consider bekenstein entropy - area relation on the surface area of the event horizon , i.e. , @xmath96 now we shall give two examples of de model and discuss the above process in respective scenarios .",
    "here we shall consider de as a perfect fluid with an equation of state @xmath97 where @xmath62 is a constant such that @xmath98 and dm to be in the form of pressureless dust , i.e. , @xmath99 .",
    "we choose dissipative pressures of dm and de as @xmath100 so that the particle creation rates for dm and de become ( from eq .",
    "( 10 ) ) @xmath101 respectively .",
    "the temperatures of these two dark sectors read as @xmath102 then , one gets ( assuming @xmath103 ) @xmath104 @xmath105 and @xmath106 differentiating ( 33 ) and ( 34 ) , we have @xmath107\\ ] ] and @xmath108\\ ] ] respectively , where the deceleration parameter @xmath109 can be evaluated as @xmath110 also , @xmath111 thus , from eq .",

    "from the figure , we see that if the de is either not close to @xmath116cdm or in phantom domain , then gslt holds for all values of @xmath114 while for de in phantom domain , gslt does not hold for very small values of @xmath114 .",
    "also , for @xmath117 , the total entropy variation shows some peculiar fluctuations .     against @xmath114 for different values of @xmath118 in quintesssence ( @xmath119 ) , phantom ( @xmath120 ) and normal fluid ( @xmath121 ) eras .",
    "]      the holographic dark energy density satisfies the relation @xmath122 @xcite , where @xmath123 is a constant to be determined from observations and @xmath124 is an ir cut - off in units of @xmath125 .",
    "li @xcite has shown that if we choose @xmath124 as the radius of the future event horizon ( @xmath76 ) , only then we can obtain the correct equation of state of de and the present accelerating universe .",
    "moreover , interaction models have been shown to support @xcite the observationally measured phantom equation of state and are also favored by observational data from the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite and the matter distribution at large scales @xcite .",
    "thus , with the choice @xmath126 , we can write @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the de density parameter . as in case",
    "a , here also we choose the dissipative pressures as @xmath129 , @xmath114 being a small positive dimensionless parameter .",
    "consequently , the particle creation rates for dm and de take the forms @xmath130 and @xmath131 respectively .",

    "the present work deals with non - equilibrium thermodynamics in the frame work of particle creation mechanism . at first",
    ", it has been shown that two fluids with different particle creation rates can be considered as a single fluid .",
    "however , if the dissipative pressure for the two fluids are identical in magnitude but different in sign then the resulting single fluid has no particle creation rate and as a result it corresponds to a close system .",
    "then considering the two dark species as dm ( in the form of dust ) and de ( as perfect fluid with a constant equation of state in one subsection and as holographic de in another subsection ) , firstly we have shown that dm has a higher temperature at the initial stages and then it gradually decreases and attains a equilibrium era and finally the de temperature dominates . although the choice of the dissipative pressures ( as in eq . ( 29 ) ) is purely phenomenological but from the mathematical point of view , it is easily solvable for both the choices of de .",
    "also physically we can argue as follows : as @xmath145 , so dissipative pressure is of the order of @xmath146 and it is consistent with the choice of barrow @xcite .",
    "subsequently , in both the cases , analytic expressions for the total entropy variations have been determined .",
    "due to complicated expressions we have graphically examined the validity of gslt . in case of constant equation of state , gslt holds for almost all values of @xmath114 ( except for very small @xmath114 for @xmath147 ) . for hde model ,",
    "we have chosen three _ planck _",
    "data sets for observed values of @xmath123 and @xmath143 and it is observed that gslt holds for all the three _ planck _ data sets for @xmath144 .",
