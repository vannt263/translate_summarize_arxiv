    "we consider the electroweak standard model in the axial gauge , restricting ourselves to leptons for simplicity .",
    "we include dirac masses for the neutrino s , not just because these particles appear to have a mass , but mainly to make it easier to figure out what the feynman rules for the quarks are .",
    "the reason to consider the standard model in this gauge is that it can provide a more severe check on gauge invariance than the more common gauges . in  @xcite an example of a gauge dependent quantity",
    "was found that in the @xmath2-gauge did not depend on the gauge parameter  @xmath3 but in the axial gauge did depend on the gauge vector  @xmath4 .",
    "another advantage of this gauge is that no fadeev - popov ghost particles are needed .",
    "there are , however , unphysical bosonic particles . both kinds of unphysical particles disappear in tree graphs in the unitary gauge , but reappear in loop graphs .",
    "furthermore , the unitary gauge has no gauge parameter , so the only practical check on the gauge invariance of a cross section is its high energy behaviour .",
    "the disadvantage of the axial gauge is that one either has bilinear terms in unphysical bosonic degrees of freedom and @xmath5 or @xmath6 particles or , if one diagonalizes these , rather complicated formulae for interaction vertices ( and in addition quite a lot of different interaction vertices ) .",
    "we choose the option of having diagonalized propagators .",
    "many lecture notes and books contain introductions to the standard model , see for instance , @xcite . here",
    ", we just quickly recall the terms of the lagrangian of the unbroken standard model .",
    "after that we turn to the axial gauge .",
    "the electroweak standard model has @xmath7 as its gauge group . the gauge field that belongs to @xmath8",
    "is called  @xmath9 , with @xmath10 .",
    "the gauge field that belongs to @xmath11 is called  @xmath12 .",
    "the lefthanded fermions are in the @xmath13 representation and the righthanded ones are in @xmath14 .",
    "furthermore there are righthanded neutrino s in the trivial representation of the gauge group .",
    "this means that the lagrangian for the fermions is  _ = |_l(i/-g_2/a^a t^a + 12g_1/b)_l + |_r(i/+g_1/b)_r + |_(i/ ) _ , where @xmath15 stands for the right - handed neutrino field . note that the @xmath16 are @xmath17-matrices that act on the two components of  @xmath18 .",
    "it looks as if the @xmath15  field is not coupled to anything but that will change if we introduce the field  @xmath19 below .",
    "the lagrangian for the gauge fields is furthermore there is a complex scalar field  @xmath19 in the @xmath20 representation .",
    "this has the lagrangian finally , we can couple the field  @xmath19 to the fermions .",
    "the lagrangian is called the yukawa lagrangian .",
    "it is given by  _",
    "= g_|^_l_r^ + g_^|_r^^_l^ + h_|_l^^*_^ -h^_|_^^t_l^. the indices @xmath21  and  @xmath22 enumerate the generations of the standard model and the matrices @xmath23 and @xmath24 contain complex numbers that can , in principle , be chosen freely .",
    "@xmath25 is the two - dimensional levi - civita tensor .",
    "it is not difficult to see that all these terms transform trivially under the gauge group .",
    "the reason that it is possible to construct an @xmath26 invariant from @xmath18 and @xmath19 as well as from @xmath27 and @xmath19 is that the fundamental representation of @xmath26 is pseudo - real .",
    "the reality of representations is , for instance , discussed in  @xcite .",
    "we briefly outline the symmetry breaking using the axial gauge fixing .",
    "the unbroken standard model , as defined by the above lagrangians , is invariant under local gauge transformations .",
    "the fermion fields and the field  @xmath19 transform according to the representation they are in .",
    "the vector fields transform according to the infinitesimal transformations if we parameterize group elements by  @xmath28 and @xmath29 . @xmath30 and @xmath31 are four arbitrary functions of space - time .",
    "the freedom to choose four arbitrary functions of space - time indicates that there is a large redundancy in the field configurations . in the path integral",
    "this redundancy causes problems , because of integrating over many equivalent field configurations , and we need to get rid of it .",
    "the various ways of doing this are the various gauges .",
    "we choose the so - called axial gauge .",
    "this means that we add to the lagrangian the quantity _=",
    "-12n^a^a_a^a_n^ -12(nb)^2 , and in the resulting feynman rules take the limit  @xmath32 .",
    "the various gauges should give the same observable results ( e.g. cross sections ) and these should not depend on parameters in the gauge choice . in our case",
    "they should not depend on the gauge vector  @xmath4 .    in the standard model",
    ", it is assumed that the parameter  @xmath33 that appears in the lagrangian for the scalar field  @xmath19 is negative .",
    "the consequence of this is that the minimum of the energy of this field is no longer located at the point  @xmath34 , but instead at the sphere @xmath35 . to derive feynman rules",
    ", we make the substitution 12 + , with  @xmath36 so that the potential is minimal for  @xmath34 .",
    "the different components of the @xmath19-field get different rles because of the arbitrary choice of the direction of the translation of the @xmath19-field . the second component of this complex field is split into two real components according to _ 2=12(h+i_z ) . after the field translation , the fields @xmath37  and  @xmath38 mix in the bilinear terms .",
    "we have this part of the lagrangian can be diagonalized by making the substitution with @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath41 is by definition given by @xmath42 . at this point",
    ", we introduce the masses @xmath43  and  @xmath44 .",
    "these are given by the field  @xmath45 turns out to have a mass  @xmath43 , while @xmath44 is the mass of the fields  @xmath46 .",
    "the field  @xmath38 has become massless , the mixing term between @xmath37 and @xmath38 has disappeared , and the field @xmath37 has gotten a mass  @xmath47 . at this point",
    "we change the name of the field  @xmath37 into @xmath6 , and the components @xmath46 are taken to be the real and imaginary parts of the complex vector field  @xmath5 according to [ eq : wdef ]    we still have a mixing term between @xmath1  and  @xmath6 .",
    "the bilinear terms in these fields are given by this part of the lagrangian can be diagonalized in momentum space by substituting _",
    "it is inadvisable to make a substitution on  @xmath6 , because of the presence of the gauge vector  @xmath4 .    for the fields",
    "@xmath5  and  @xmath48 ( i.e. , the first component of the complex @xmath19-field ) we have a situation similar to what we had for the fields @xmath6  and  @xmath1 . these fields still mix .",
    "we have in the lagrangian the bilinear terms the reason that , in the mixing terms , we have two conjugated fields or two unconjugated fields is because of the way that we chose to put the fields @xmath46 into the complex field  @xmath5 in equation  ( [ eq : wdef ] ) .",
    "we chose this way , because it gives the normal conventions in the couplings to the fermions .",
    "these terms are diagonalized by applying , in momentum space , the transformation _",
    "1(k)_1(k)+2m_w . for convenience ,",
    "we rename the field @xmath48 into @xmath49 and @xmath50 into @xmath0 .    after the diagonalization process",
    "the quadratic terms in the lagrangian for the field  @xmath6 are , in momentum space , given by from this the propagator _ = can be found .",
    "taking the limit @xmath32 , the term with @xmath51 disappears and we see that the numerator is the same as in the axial gauge for massless particles . in the rest of this paper",
    "this limit is implied . for the @xmath5-particle",
    "the same propagator can be found except that @xmath52 should be changed into  @xmath44 .    from this propagator",
    "we can derive the polarization sum in the axial gauge .",
    "in the theory without interaction we have a particle creation field configuration a_j^*(k)=-id^3x e^-ikx _ 0 s_j^z_(x )",
    ". the complex conjugate of this is the particle annihilation field configuration .",
    "because the vector field  @xmath6 has three physical degrees of freedom , the @xmath53 in the above formula should run from 1  to  3 . for @xmath54",
    "we choose two vectors perpendicular to each other and perpendicular to both @xmath55 and @xmath4 with @xmath56 .",
    "for @xmath57 we pick s_3^=k^. this is correctly normalized as can be checked by verifying that a_3^*(k , t)a_3(k,t ) = 2(2)^3 ^ 3(k - k)(t-t ) .",
    "it is possible to add an arbitrary multiple of @xmath58 in the definition of @xmath59 , but since the contraction of @xmath58 with the propagator is zero , this does not contribute .",
    "the polarization vectors  @xmath60 that occur in the feynman rules are the contraction of @xmath61 with the numerator of the propagator .",
    "j=-(g _ - - + k_k_)s_j^. from this it can be found that the polarization sum is given by _",
    "j=1,2,3_j^_j^ = -g^ + + -k^k^. in practice , only the @xmath62 term plays a role , because it is a feature of the axial gauge that if we have a vector boson ( @xmath38 ,  @xmath5 or  @xmath6 ) as an incoming / outgoing particle , the matrix element should become zero if a polarization vector is replaced by the momentum of the external particle the polarization vector belongs to .",
    "this is a check on gauge invariance .",
    "note that it is an error to contract the polarization sum with the numerator of the propagator . in the axial gauge",
    "one should be careful not to confuse the vectors  @xmath63 with the vectors  @xmath64 .",
    "also the fermions can be diagonalized .",
    "this proceeds in exactly the same way as in more common gauges .",
    "the result is that there are six different fermion masses and that the coupling to the @xmath5  boson can change a fermion of one generation into a fermion of another .",
    "below we list the feynman rules of the standard model in the axial gauge .",
    "a few remarks are in order    1 .   for every feynman rule that involves fermions",
    ", there is another one with all generation labels changed .",
    "this involves the changes @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "furthermore , in subscripts of the neutrino mixing matrix  @xmath69 the exchange @xmath70 should be carried out .",
    "also one of the generations involved can be changed into the third generation ( i.e. , the @xmath71  fermion ) . of feynman rules related in this way ,",
    "only one is shown below 2 .",
    "particles that have an antiparticle , have an arrow on their lines in a feynman graph . in this case ,",
    "momentum flows in the direction of the arrow . if particles do not have an arrow on them , momentum flows towards the vertex .",
    "we use the following abbreviations 4 .",
    "if reversing all arrows on a vertex would yield a different vertex , that vertex is also a vertex of the theory . to find the vertex factor that belongs to it ,",
    "the vertex factor of the original vertex should be complex conjugated , except for one factor of  @xmath72 , and all momenta that belong to particles that do not carry an arrow on their line should get a minus sign . of a pair of vertices that is related in this way ,",
    "only one is shown below .",
    "as an example , consider the vertex with an incoming electron neutrino , an outgoing muon and an incoming @xmath0 , that is shown below .",
    "the `` conjugate vertex factor '' is found by exchanging @xmath73 and  @xmath74 and changing @xmath75 into  @xmath76 .",
    "another example is the vertex with an incoming higgs , an incoming  @xmath0 and an outgoing  @xmath5 ( see below ) . to obtain the vertex that belongs to an incoming higgs , an incoming  @xmath5 and an outgoing  @xmath0 ,",
    "the only change necessary in the vertex factor is @xmath77 .",
    "the algebra necessary to find all the vertex factors was done using the c++ computer algebra library ginac , see  @xcite . because other symbolic calculations will be easier to perform starting from the lagrangian calculated here , the program used can be downloaded at the homepage  @xcite of one of the authors .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 fields are unphysical .",
    "this means that they can not be external lines in a feynman graph .",
    "the pole at @xmath78 that occurs in their propagators is canceled by the poles in the interaction vertices that the @xmath5 and @xmath6 particles have .",
    "the consequence is that these particles can not travel over macroscopic distances . as an example , we show how this cancellation arrises for one particular case . consider the combination = + .",
    "we do not assume anything about the external lines here , so that our conclusions also apply if all lines in the above graphs are internal lines of some bigger graph .",
    "for @xmath79 we find here , we have made the approximation that the neutrino s are massless and consequently the mixing matrix  @xmath69 can be taken diagonal .",
    "this is just for brevity and does not change much in the proof below .",
    "the @xmath80_{1,2}$ ] are used to distinguish matrices in spinor space for the two different spin lines . working out the brackets for the spin lines , we find [ eq : matel ] using the identity 1q^21q^2-m_w^2+i = 1m_w^21q^2-m_w^2+i -1m_w^21q^2",
    ", we see that in equation  [ eq : matel ] no pole remains at @xmath81 .",
    "the general property that we need so that this always works out is that the combination ^w(q ) _",
    "+ ^_w(q ) has no pole at @xmath81 .",
    "this property can be checked to hold . in the same way",
    ", it can also be shown that @xmath1 is not a physical particle .",
    "if a massive vector boson is produced in a process , strictly speaking this can not be an asymptotic state , and one should take the decay of this particle into account .",
    "however , not doing so may be a rather accurate approximation . in this section",
    "we consider what the rle of the @xmath0  field is .",
    "we consider a particular decay mode of the top quark , namely  @xmath82 .",
    "we compare the result that can be obtained from the full tree - level matrix element to the result that we get if we use the @xmath5  boson as an on - shell particle and to the result that we get if we ignore the @xmath0  field .",
    "notice that the @xmath0 contribution is itself independent of the gauge vector  @xmath4 , and might therefore be overlooked .",
    "if we consider the @xmath5  boson as an on - shell particle we find the decay width _ = _ tb+w^+ the full tree - level matrix element is given by = + .5 cm .",
    "we find the following relative errors . in these expressions",
    "we restricted ourselves in both numerator and denominator to the lowest non - trivial order in @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 . what can be learned from this",
    "is that because the @xmath0 field couples to the fermions proportional to their mass we expect it not to be important if either of the fermions the @xmath0 couples to has a mass that can be ignored .",
    "the electroweak standard model can be considered in the axial gauge . in this gauge",
    "there are no fadeev - popov ghost particles .",
    "there are , however , the unphysical bosons @xmath0  and  @xmath1 .",
    "these bosons can not appear as asymptotic states .",
    "the @xmath86-poles in their propagators cancel against the @xmath86-factors in the vertices of the corresponding physical particles .",
    "the coupling of the fermions to the unphysical fields and to the @xmath86 terms in the vertex factors are proportional to the mass of the fermions .",
    "consequently , ignoring these masses can be an important simplification , depending on the amplitude considered .",
