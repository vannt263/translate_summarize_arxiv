    "rectification is central to the operation of electrical circuits .",
    "more than 60 years ago , leon brillouin , then at ibm , raised the question of whether an electric circuit consisting of a resistor and a diode can become a maxwell demon rectifying its own thermal fluctuations .",
    "@xcite using inappropriate generalizations of langevin dynamics for systems with nonlinear diffusion coefficients could indeed lead to such rectification , in obvious violation of the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "@xcite brillouin s paradox was solved by taking into account the diode s contact potentials .",
    "@xcite later , it was shown that a system with diode and resistor at two different temperatures can not exceed carnot efficiency  @xcite in agreement with the second law .",
    "nowadays , thermoelectrics is of increasing importance . in the continuing quest for smaller scale electric circuits the evacuation of heat proves to be a major obstacle .",
    "therefore it is interesting to explore whether some of the energy that is dissipated can be harvested and put to use .",
    "there are many ways to generate directed currents . in recent years",
    "brownian particles in ratchets subject to periodic driving have found much interest in very different fields of science .",
    "@xcite here we are concerned with a more subtle form of driving : the only external agent acting on the system is noise that can be generated by an external thermal equilibrium bath .",
    "external noise can generate directed currents even in periodic potentials with inversion symmetry if the noise power depends on the location of the brownian particle .",
    "@xcite such state dependent diffusion is also at the origin of the difficulties encountered by brillouin .",
    "@xcite    ( color online ) schematic of the double cavity and operation scheme : electrons enter the cavity , gain an energy @xmath0 and then leave the cavity again , experiencing different transmissions of the contacts.,title=\"fig : \" ] ( color online ) schematic of the double cavity and operation scheme : electrons enter the cavity , gain an energy @xmath0 and then leave the cavity again , experiencing different transmissions of the contacts.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in this paper , we investigate the rectification of thermal fluctuations into a directed electric current in a mesoscopic heat engine .",
    "the latter consists of two capacitively coupled chaotic cavities arranged in a three - terminal geometry as shown fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] .",
    "the upper cavity is the rectifier and is connected via two contacts with energy - dependent transmissions to electron reservoirs .",
    "the lower cavity provides the external source of thermal noise .",
    "it is connected via only a single contact to another electron reservoir .",
    "the energy dependence of the contact transmissions is a generic feature of mesoscopic conductors and leads to an intrinsic nonlinearity in the upper cavity .",
    "@xcite the three - terminal setup allows for separated heat and charge currents in contrast to two - terminal setups where these currents are necessarily aligned .",
    "the mechanism giving rise to the current is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] .",
    "electrons enter the cold upper cavity at an energy @xmath1 .",
    "they absorb the energy @xmath0 from the fluctuating potential generated by the hot lower cavity in the upper cavity and afterwards leave the cold cavity again . as the transmissions through the upper cavity s contacts are energy - dependent , the ratio between transport processes involving the left and right lead is different at energies @xmath1 and @xmath2 , thus giving rise to a net electrical current through the cavity .",
    "the rectification is controlled by coulomb coupling which is dominant at low temperatures , whereas at higher temperatures phonon effects become important .",
    "@xcite    thermoelectric properties of both open mesoscopic cavities  @xcite and in the coulomb blockade limit  @xcite have been of interest .",
    "the quantization of energy levels in small dots leads to exceptional thermo - electrical properties .",
    "@xcite both in two- and three - terminal structures the limit in which the ratio of electric to heat current is given by the ratio of the charge to an energy quantum can be reached .",
    "@xcite still , while the efficiency of such nanoengines can in principle be optimal leading to an infinite figure of merit @xmath3@xcite , the current they deliver is small , typically of the order of @xmath4{pa}$ ] .",
    "it is therefore of interest to explore how power output and efficiency scale as dots are opened and turned into cavities with contacts that permit currents that are much larger than the tunneling current of a coulomb - blockaded quantum dot .",
    "the physics of coulomb coupled conductors is of interest in nanophysics for on - chip charge detectors ,  @xcite quantum hall edge states ,  @xcite and the coulomb drag in which one system that carries a current induces a current in a nearby unbiased conductor .",

    "we investigate transport through two capacitively coupled open quantum dots with mutual capacitance @xmath5 , cf .",
    "fig  [ fig : model ] .",
    "each cavity @xmath6 is coupled via quantum point contacts ( qpcs ) to electronic reservoirs @xmath7 .",
    "the latter ones are assumed to be in local equilibrium and described by a fermi distribution @xmath8 + 1\\}^{-1}$ ] with temperature @xmath9 and chemical potential @xmath10 .",
    "interaction effects are captured by capacitive couplings @xmath11 between the cavities and their respective reservoirs that leads to screening of the potential fluctuations .",
    "we consider the system in the semiclassical limit where the number @xmath12 of open transport channels  @xcite in the qpcs is large under conditions at which dephasing destroys phase information but preserves energy .",
    "we can , thus , characterize the chaotic cavities by a distribution function @xmath13 that depends on energy only , and focus on a semi - classical description of the physics without coherence .",
    "@xcite for later convenience , we write the distribution function as @xmath14 here , the first term describes the average value of @xmath15 and is given by the average of the distributions of the reservoirs weighted with the transmission @xmath16 of the respective qpc .",
    "the second term @xmath17 describes fluctuations of @xmath15 around its average .",
    "additionally , each cavity is characterized by its potential @xmath18 which also fluctuates by @xmath19 .",
    "we assume the transmissions to be energy dependent which we model to first order as @xmath20 .",
    "the energy dependent transmission leads to a nonlinear current voltage characteristic . even without external noise such",
    "a nonlinearity requires a self - consistent treatment .",
    "@xcite in our system , fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] , we need a self - consistent treatment not only of the average hartree potential but in addition the fluctuating potentials .",
    "we remark that while the energy - independent part @xmath21 scales linearly with the number of open transport channels @xmath12 , the energy - dependent part @xmath22 is independent of @xmath12 .",
    "the starting point of our theoretical investigation is a kinetic equation for the distribution functions @xmath15 ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) , @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the density of states of cavity @xmath25 .",

    ", the latter can be converted into a nonlinear fokker - planck equation with a diffusion function that depends on the cavity potential .",
    "the nonlinearity of the langevin equation leads to subtleties in the interpretation of the stochastic integral ( known as the it and stratonovich problem ) that gives rise to different fokker - planck equations .",
    "the `` kinetic prescription '' of klimontovich  @xcite provides a steady - state solution of eq .",
    "that is in global thermal equilibrium , thus avoiding the brillouin paradox mentioned in the introduction .",
    "we stress that the nonlinearity is the technical origin of rectification in the cavity .",
    "a linear system would not exhibit this feature . from the klimontovich - fokker - planck equation we obtain @xmath29 and @xmath30 , cf .",
    "appendixes  [ app : kinetic]-[app : currents ] for details .",
    "the charge currents between upper cavity and contact @xmath28 are given by @xmath31",
    "the critical nonlinearity of the cavity is quantified by the amount of symmetry - breaking in the energy - derivatives of the transmissions of the upper cavity , given by the rectification parameter @xmath32 : @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "we will see below that it is the rectification conversion factor between energy and charge for an unbiased cavity .",
    "this parameter appears in many places in terms of interaction corrections .",
    "for example , if we consider the uncoupled upper cavity ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) , the single cavity conductance @xmath38 ( which is the series combination of the left and right leads ) has an interaction correction of @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the total capacitance of the upper cavity and @xmath41 is its electrochemical capacitance .",
    "we note that while @xmath42 scales with the channel number @xmath43 , the correction @xmath44 is of order @xmath45 ( quantum corrections in a coherent cavity  @xcite are of order @xmath46 ) .",

    "inverse effective capacitance as a function of the capacitance between the two cavities @xmath5 for different values of @xmath47 .",
    "note the different scale for the various curves . ]",
    "we now turn to the coupled cavities , cf .",
    "fig .  1 . applying different temperatures @xmath48 and @xmath49 to the reservoirs that couple to cavity 1 and 2 , respectively , while keeping the electrical contacts grounded ( @xmath50 ) , we find to leading order in the nonlinearity a charge current through the cavity given by @xmath51 where we assumed identical capacitances and densities of states for the two cavities . now",
    ", we give a physical interpretation of each term in eq .",
    ", the rectified current .",
    "@xmath52 denotes an effective @xmath53 time of the double cavity .",
    "it is determined by the effective conductance of the double cavity , @xmath54 which is largest if both cavities have equal conductances .",
    "furthermore , it depends on the effective capacitance @xmath55 describing how strong the interaction is between the two cavities",
    ". it should be minimized ( without entering the coulomb blockade regime ) to maximize the rectified current .",
    "it grows as @xmath56 and for large couplings approaches the constant value @xmath57 , cf .",
    "[ fig : ceff ] .",
    "next , as stated , the rectified current   is proportional to @xmath32 , which characterizes the asymmetry of the system : the system is asymmetric if either the left - right conductances and/or their energy derivatives differ .",
    "finally , the current   is linear in the applied temperature difference , so the rectified current is zero in global thermal equilibrium , as must be the case in order to satisfy the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "we note that the sign of the current flips under either exchange of the system lead nonlinearity or under exchange of the cavity temperatures .    as the energy - dependent part of the transmission does not scale with the number of transport channels , the current eq",

    ", we have to make the noise - induced current flow against a finite bias voltage @xmath62 .",
    "the bias induces a counterflow of current given to leading order in the nonlinearity by @xmath63 , thus reducing the total current . at the stopping voltage , @xmath64",
    ", there is no current flowing through the system .",
    "the output power is given by @xmath65 .",
    "it is parabolic as a function of the applied voltage , vanishing at zero bias and the stopping voltage ; it has a maximum at half the stopping voltage given by @xmath66    energy is transferred between the cavities in the form of dissipated power in the upper cavity , @xmath67 , the heat current given up by the lower hot cavity to the upper cold cavity , @xmath68 , and the heat current given up by the upper cold cavity to its heat reservoirs , @xmath69 .",
    "it is straightforward to check that @xmath70 in our model , so energy is conserved in the system .",
    "the efficiency , @xmath71 , of the heat - to - charge - current converter is given by the ratio between the output power , @xmath72 to the inter - cavity heat current , @xmath73 .",
    "to leading order in the energy - dependent transmissions , this heat current is given by @xmath74 because heat will flow from hot to cold even without the nonlinearity .",
    "the correction to this result that is linear in the voltage applied across the upper cavity is suppressed by @xmath75 ( as it must to satisfy an onsager relation , see appendix  [ app : onsager ] ) .",
    "as indicated earlier , the asymmetry parameter @xmath32 controls the process of energy - to - charge conversion , @xmath76 .",
    "the efficiency @xmath77 exhibits the same parabolic bias dependence as the output power since the heat current is independent of the applied bias .",
    "hence , for a given temperature difference , the maximal efficiency occurs at maximum power and is given by @xmath78 for @xmath79 and parameters as above , we estimate @xmath80{fw}$ ] and a maximal efficiency of @xmath81 of the carnot efficiency for a device working at liquid - helium temperatures .",
    "we note that while the maximal power of the system scales inversely with the number of available transport channels , the maximal efficiency even decreases with the number of channels squared .",
    "this is because for a large number of open channels the effect of the energy - dependence of the uppermost channel becomes less important .",
    "this effect can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : power ] where the logarithmic derivative of the qpc conductance is plotted , which controls the stopping voltage and other rectification figures of merit in the case where one contact is energy - independent . for a stronger nonlinearity , such as a truly step - like transmission , a nonperturbative analysis is required which could give rise to much higher efficiencies .",
    "@xcite     conductance of a qpc for both fully quantized steps ( full black ) and semiclassical interpolation ( full red ) .",
    "its logarithmic derivative ( black and red dashed ) controls the heat - to - charge conversion , stopping voltage , power and efficiency of the energy harvester . ]    in order to demonstrate that it is the nonlinearity of the rectifying cavity that is the key ingredient to our heat engine , we now briefly consider an alternative setup where a rectifier is coupled to a resistor @xmath82 at temperature @xmath49 with a capacitor @xmath83 in parallel instead of a second cavity ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : circuit ] for a circuit diagram ) . repeating the same analysis as above",
    ", we find that the heat - induced current , the maximal power as well as the efficiency at maximum power are given by the same expressions as above .",
    "the only difference is that the effective conductance and capacitance take on different values , @xmath84 , @xmath85[c_\\mu c_\\sigma(c+c_\\sigma)+rg_\\sigma(cc_rc_\\sigma+(c+c_r)c_\\sigma^2-cc_rc_\\mu)]/(c^2c_\\mu c_\\sigma)$ ] .",
    "we finally apply our results to the semiclassical regime in the limit @xmath86 for simplicity . for large energies",
    "the conductance of the qpcs is given by @xmath87 with @xmath88 being the energy that marks the transition from tunneling to ballistic transport and @xmath89 describing how open the contact is . for equal conductances of the two qpcs at the fermi energy , @xmath90",

    "we thus see that in order to maximize the power , we need a strong asymmetry in the contacts , @xmath93 while keeping the conductance of each contact the same . for the semiclassical result @xmath94 ,",
    "we find that the power drops upon increasing the energy transport window @xmath95 . we note , however , that for @xmath96 the contribution from the conductance will outweigh the contribution from the nonlinearity and , thus , lead to a maximal power that increases with the transport window .",
    "while the efficiency will drop with the inverse square of the transport window , we remark that a conductance that is exponential in energy will have an efficiency that is independent of the window size .",
