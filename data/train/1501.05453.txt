    "the issue of the relationship between spectral flow and the fredholm index was first raised in @xcite and settled in the most definitive fashion for certain families of selfadjoint unbounded operators with compact resolvent in @xcite . for differential operators on noncompact manifolds",
    "it is typically the case that they possess some essential spectrum .",
    "an extension of the result of @xcite to this situation and its relationship to scattering theory was initiated in @xcite following @xcite .",
    "however the key assumption in @xcite is that they consider spectral flow between selfadjoint operators that differ by a relatively trace class perturbation .",
    "this latter assumption is violated in general for differential operators ( although not for pseudodifferential operators ) .",
    "indeed , there is comparatively little work available in the way of index formulas for operators with essential spectrum except for @xcite , @xcite and previous work by the authors and their collaborators .",
    "this history is referenced in @xcite which also contains results on an index theory for certain non - fredholm operators using the model operator formalism of @xcite .",
    "more generally , the model operators of @xcite provide prototypes for various applications such as those arising in connection with the maslov index , morse theory , floer homology , sturm oscillation theory , etc .",
    "the principle aim in @xcite and @xcite was to extend the results in @xcite ( albeit subject to a relatively trace class perturbation condition ) , in a fashion permitting essential spectra .",
    "this work has motivated the current investigation where we provide evidence that the relationship between the fredholm index and spectral flow is a special case of an operator trace identity that holds without any fredholm assumptions .",
    "the fundamental trace formula of @xcite fits into the general form of the identity we prove here .",
    "the prototype of our formula also appears implicitly in @xcite where it is proved in the context of an @xmath9 index theorem for covering spaces . to simplify the discussion and to explain the formula we now describe only the special case of @xcite that applies to compact manifolds .",
    "we use the notation of @xcite as the setting differs from that considered in this current paper . assume that we have an odd dimensional closed manifold @xmath11 .",
    "the analysis of spectral flow of a path of dirac - type operators on sections of bundles over @xmath11 traditionally proceeds by replacing @xmath11 by @xmath12 or @xmath13 $ ] and considering the dirac operator on this even dimensional manifold .",
    "the argument in @xcite uses an adiabatic limiting process , which leads to the formula for the leading term in the expansion of the ( difference of ) heat kernels . in this paper",
    "we also use an analogous adiabatic limiting process to establish our main result .",
    "let @xmath14 denote a dirac - type operator acting on sections of a bundle of clifford modules @xmath15 over a closed , odd - dimensional manifold @xmath11 as in @xcite .",
    "introduce an auxiliary hermitian vector bundle @xmath16 with hermitian connection @xmath17 , and the operator @xmath18 .",
    "let @xmath19 denote a unitary bundle automorphism , then we can introduce the operator @xmath20 the difference @xmath21g^{-1}$ ] is a bundle endomorphism and we want to present a formula for the spectral flow along a path joining @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "spectral flow is a homotopy invariant and the space of bounded perturbations of @xmath22 is affine .",
    "so in this example we may restrict ourselves to the study of the spectral flow of a smooth family of selfadjoint operators parametrised by @xmath24 .",
    "we introduce a smooth cut - off function @xmath25 , such that @xmath26 we also assume that there exists a positive constant @xmath27 , such that @xmath28 for @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "now we consider the family @xmath31 which in an obvious way provides us with a family of operators on @xmath24 .",
    "we may also consider the corresponding operator @xmath32 on the closed manifold @xmath33 where @xmath34 is given by the formula ( [ e:2 ] ) .",
    "the operator @xmath35 acts on sections of the bundle @xmath36 \\times s\\otimes e/_{\\cong}$ ] , where the identification is given by @xmath37    by rescaling the variable @xmath38 in the part of the schwartz kernel for the heat operators that arises from @xmath39 and taking the ( adiabatic ) limit @xmath40 , @xcite establishes that the following formula holds , @xmath41 where as usual @xmath42 .    as we remarked above the equality index = spectral flow in ( [ e:3 ] )",
    "goes back to the original atiyah - patodi - singer paper @xcite .",
    "they also proved a formula @xmath43 , where @xmath44 denotes the @xmath45-invariant of the operator @xmath34 .",
    "the equality @xmath46 and more was proved by wojciechowski around 1991 and published in one of his iupui preprints @xcite .",
    "the formal paper never appeared but the result eventually resurfaced in the paper by getzler @xcite .",
    "getzler s paper motivated a careful investigation of such spectral flow formulas in @xcite .",
    "note that to our knowledge the first mathematically precise formulation of the adiabatic limit is in @xcite .    using a laplace transform argument of the kind employed in @xcite",
    "we now see that for @xmath47 @xmath48 while , inserting the same function of @xmath49 and integrating on the rhs we obtain : @xmath50 and because it is permissable to interchange the order of integration ( as in @xcite ) we obtain @xmath51 under the assumptions made here we may apply traces to these expressions and then interchange the trace and integral ( as in @xcite ) to obtain for @xmath52 sufficiently large : @xmath53 where @xmath54 .",
    "we refer to this last equation as the _ integral trace formula_.    _ the objective of this paper is to show that this integral trace formula holds when we relax the condition that we are working on a compact manifold @xmath11 . in this paper",
    "we will replace the manifold situation by an abstract approach .",
    "this is possible because we introduce and exploit resolvent techniques that are not available in the heat kernel method .",
    "our abstract approach includes examples on noncompact manifolds and makes no reference to the fredholm property . the resolvent methods and ` adiabatic approximation ' we employ may also have wider application .",
    "_    in the notation above this means that while the individual operators @xmath55 are no longer trace class for any @xmath52 , the particular combinations of operators that appear under the trace in the trace formula remain trace class and the formula will be proved to hold . what this result supports is our contention that the index = spectral flow theorem is a special case of an operator trace identity ( the integral trace formula ) that holds in great generality .",
    "the lhs of the integral trace formula ( [ ftf ] ) was shown in @xcite to have a ( co)-homological interpretation .",
    "in @xcite we studied the algebra generated by a pair @xmath56 satisfying @xmath57<\\infty\\ ] ] for some positive integer @xmath58 .",
    "then we showed that the real number ( called the homological index there ) , @xmath59 $ ] , computes the pairing of a certain element of a homology group of the algebra generated by the operators @xmath56 with an element of the dual cohomology group .",
    "the relationship of this general result for pairs @xmath56 satisfying ( [ tc ] ) to the integral trace formula arises via the mapping that sends unbounded operators @xmath35 to @xmath60 .",
    "we show later that for the operators @xmath35 studied in this paper the corresponding operators @xmath61 satisfy ( [ tc ] ) .",
    "thus the integral trace formula expresses the homological index in terms of an integral formula that in the case of fredholm operators with purely discrete spectrum is computing spectral flow .",
    "this suggests that when we do not impose fredholm or discrete spectrum conditions on the operators in the path then the rhs of the integral trace formula is a generalisation of spectral flow .",
    "most importantly it allows the operators in the path to have essential spectrum .",
    "we note that previous evidence has been gathered that supports this view . in @xcite versions of the integral trace formula",
    "are proved . under very different hypotheses ( which are too restrictive to support the analysis described here ) in @xcite the @xmath62 case",
    "is studied when the operators on both sides of the integral trace formula are fredholm operators . there",
    "it is shown that the homological index satisfies @xmath63 = \\t{tr}[(1+\\mathcal d^\\ast\\mathcal d)^{-1}-(1 + \\mathcal d\\mathcal d^\\ast)^{-1}]\\ ] ] while the scaling limit @xmath64 $ ] is equal to the fredholm index of @xmath35 . from the version of the integral trace formula in @xcite it is established by an indirect argument that the rhs is related to spectral flow . in the non - fredholm case as studied in @xcite , again under hypotheses that are far too restrictive for our purposes , the limit @xmath64 $ ] is shown to compute the so - called witten index while the rhs of the integral trace formula is linked to krein s spectral shift function for the pair of operators given by taking the endpoints of the path .",
    "it is not known at this time how to interpret this spectral shift function as giving a generalisation of spectral flow to the situation where the path does not consist of fredholm operators .",
    "work is in progress on low dimensional examples to investigate this .      for brevity we will write @xmath65",
