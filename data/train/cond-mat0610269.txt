    "the origin of the macroscopic phenomenological `` laws '' of thermodynamic transport is still one of the major challenges to theoretical physics .",
    "in particular the issue of energy ( heat ) transport , in spite of having a long history , is not completely settled @xcite .",
    "given a particular classical , many - body hamiltonian system , neither phenomenological nor fundamental transport theory can predict whether or not this specific hamiltonian system yields an energy transport governed by the fourier law @xmath0 , relating the macroscopic heat flux to the temperature gradient @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "heat flow is universally presumed to obey a simple diffusion equation which can be regarded as the continuum limit of a discrete random walk . in consequence",
    ", transport theory requires that the underlying deterministic dynamics yield a truly random process .",
    "therefore , it is not mere idle curiosity to wonder what class , if any , of many - body systems satisfy the necessary stringent requirements .    in spite of intense investigations in recent years , @xcite the precise conditions that a dynamical system of interacting particles in 1d must satisfy in order to obey the fourier law of heat conduction are still not known . however , the general picture which emerges is that , for systems with no globally conserved quantities ( i.e. , globally ergodic ) , positive lyapunov exponent is a sufficient condition to ensure fourier heat law .",
    "this appears quite natural .",
    "indeed modern ergodic theory tells us that for k - systems , a sequence of measurements with finite precision mimics a truly random sequence and therefore these systems appear precisely those deterministically random systems tacitly required by transport theory .",
    "in fact the thermal conductivity has been studied for a lorentz channel a quasi one dimensional billiard with circular scatterers and it was shown to obey fourier law @xcite . yet we do not have rigorous results and in spite of several efforts , the connection between lyapunov exponents , correlations decay , diffusive and transport properties is still not completely clear .",
    "for example , in a recent paper @xcite a model has been presented which has zero lyapunov exponent and yet it exhibits unbounded gaussian diffusive behavior . since",
    "diffusive behavior is at the root of normal heat transport then the above result@xcite constitutes a strong suggestion that normal heat conduction can take place even without the strong requirement of exponential instability .",
    "moreover , the models in @xcite are noninteracting and thus , the condition of local thermal equilibrium ( lte ) is not satisfied .",
    "noninteracting particle systems are certainly less realistic .",
    "they are good models for gases in the knudsen limit in which the mean free path is larger than the characteristic length of the container and their use in other physical situations is open to criticism @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to investigate up to what extend one can simplify the microscopic dynamics , and yet obtain a normal transport behavior .",
    "an additional interesting problem , almost completely unexplored , is the derivation of fourier law from quantum dynamics .",
    "indeed at the quantum level , investigations have been mainly focused on linear response theory@xcite .",
    "the possibility to derive the fourier law by directly establishing the dependence of @xmath2 on @xmath1 in a nonequilibrium steady state calls directly in question the issue of quantum chaos . in this connection",
    "we recall that a main feature of quantum motion is the lack of exponential dynamical instability@xcite , a property which is at the heart of classical dynamical chaos .",
    "the aim of this paper is to discuss the transport of heat in several classical and quantum microscopic models by direct numerical simulation of energy flow in the system in contact with thermal baths . at the classical level our results in section [ sec : fourier ]",
    "provide convincing evidence that linear mixing systems ( i.e. with zero lyapunov exponent ) obey fourier law . at the quantum level we study in section [ sec : quantum ] an ising chain of @xmath3 coupled spins @xmath4 in a tilted magnetic field .",
    "we provide clear numerical evidence of the validity of fourier law at the onset of quantum chaos . in section",
    "[ sec : rectifier ] we then investigate the possibility to control the energy transport and discuss different microscopic mechanical models in which thermal rectification can be observed .",
    "the possibility to control heat conduction by nonlinearity opens the way to design a thermal rectifier , i.e. a lattice that carries heat preferentially in one direction while it behaves as an insulator in the opposite direction .",
    "a lorentz gas consists of noninteracting point particles that collide elastically with a set of circular scatterers on the plane .",
    "motivated by the ergodicity and mixing properties of the lorentz gas , in @xcite a channel geometry of this model was considered to study the problem of heat conduction . by imposing and external thermal gradient",
    "it was found that in a lorentz channel the fourier law is satisfied . yet",
    "this system is not described by lte . a modification of this model in which particles and scatterers can exchange energy through their collisions appeared in @xcite .",
    "this effective interaction leads to the establishment of lte . as a consequence ,",
    "this model has proven to reproduce realistically macroscopic transport in many different situations @xcite .",
    "in particular , the validity of fourier law was verified , indicating that the interaction among the different particles is not fundamental for the observation of normal transport .    to clarify the role of dynamical instability on the validity of fourier law ,",
    "let us consider a two dimensional billiard model which consists of two parallel lines of length @xmath3 at distance @xmath5 and a series of triangular scatterers ( fig .",
    "1 ) . in this geometry , no particle can move between the two reservoirs without suffering elastic collisions with the triangles .",
    "therefore this model is analogous to the one studied in @xcite with triangles instead of discs and the essential difference is that in the triangular model discussed here the dynamical instability is linear and therefore the lyapunov exponent is zero .",
    "strong numerical evidence has been recently given @xcite that the motion inside a triangular billiard , with all angles irrational with @xmath6 is mixing , without any time scale , ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , an area preserving map , which was derived as an approximation of the boundary map for the irrational triangle , when considered on the cylinder shows a nice gaussian diffusive behavior even though the lyapunov exponent of the map is zero @xcite .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to expect that the motion inside the irrational polygonal area of fig .",
    "1 is diffusive thus leading to normal conductivity .     and",
    "@xmath7 are indicated .",
    "the length of each cell is @xmath8 , the base of the triangles is @xmath9 and the distance between the two parallel lines is @xmath10 .",
    "the geometry is then uniquely specified by assigning the internal angles @xmath11 and @xmath12 , width=307 ]    we consider a channel of total length @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the number and the length of the fundamental cells . for the irrational angles we take @xmath16 and @xmath17 . by increasing @xmath3 ,",
    "the number of particles per cell must be kept constant . however , since the particles do not interact one may consider the motion of a single particle over long times and then rescale the flux .    heat conductivity of this model has been numerically studied in @xcite .",
    "heat baths have been simulated with stochastic kernels of gaussian type , namely , the probability distribution of velocities for particles coming out from the baths is @xmath18 for @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "since the energy changes only at collisions with the heat baths , the heat flux is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the change of energy at the @xmath23-th collision with the heat bath and @xmath24 is the total number of such collisions which occur during time @xmath25 .",
    "we have checked that for sufficiently long integration times ( @xmath26 time unit ) the system reach a stationary value .    in fig.2 , we plot the heat flux @xmath2 as a function of the system size @xmath14 . for the case of irrational angles ,",
    "the best fit gives @xmath27 , with @xmath28 .",
    "the coefficient of thermal conductivity is therefore independent on @xmath14 , which means that the fourier law is obeyed .    as a consistency check",
    "we have also performed an independent check of the above results via a green - kubo type formalism@xcite from which consistent results with those presented above have been obtained .",
    "a completely different behavior is obtained when the angles @xmath11 and @xmath12 are rational multiples of @xmath6 . the case with @xmath29 and @xmath30 , is shown in fig .",
    "[ heatflux ] ( triangles ) , from which a divergent behavior of the coefficient of thermal conductivity @xmath31 is observed , indicating the absence of fourier law .    in conclusion , when all angles are irrational multiples of @xmath6 the model shown in fig .",
    "1 exhibits fourier law of heat conduction together with nice diffusive properties .",
    "however , when all angles are rational multiple of @xmath6 , the model shows abnormal diffusion and the heat conduction does not follow the fourier law .",
    "one may argue that the model considered here is somehow artificial and far from realistic physical models .",
    "indeed , noninteracting particle systems are certainly less realistic as in general , lte is not established .",
    "however the problem under discussion is quite delicate and controversial and our main purpose is to understand which dynamical properties are necessary and sufficient to derive fourier law .     as a function of the system size for the case of irrational angles of fig .",
    "1 ( circles ) and for the rational case ( triangles ) . @xmath14 is the number of fundamental cells .",
    "the particle density was set to @xmath32 particle per cell independently of @xmath14 .",
    "the best - squares fitting gives a slope @xmath33 for the irrational case and @xmath34 for the rational one.,width=321 ]    in this respect we mention two different billiards like models that are genuinely interacting many - particle models and that share some of the properties of the model discussed here .",
    "the first one is the _",
    "1d hard - point particles with alternating masses _ that consists of a one - dimensional chain of elastically colliding free particles with alternate masses @xmath35 and @xmath36 @xcite . for this model",
    "all lyapunov exponents are zero like the irrational triangle channel . in @xcite",
    "the problem of heat conduction in this model was considered .",
    "it was found that in the alternating mass model the heat current follows a power - law behavior @xmath37 with @xmath38 .",
    "in contrast with the irrational triangle channel , the alternating mass model does not obey fourier law .",
    "therefore we have two models which are both mixing and without exponential instability : ( i ) the triangular billiard channel @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , which exhibits fourier law and ( ii ) the alternate mass hard point gas model@xcite in which the coefficient of thermal conductivity diverges with the system size .",
    "the difference between the two models is that in case ( ii ) the total momentum is conserved while in case ( i ) it is not .",
    "we recall that in several recent papers@xcite it has been suggested that total momentum conservation does not allow fourier law and this may explain the lack of fourier law for the one dimensional alternating mass model .    to clarify the role of total momentum conservation , in @xcite a model which is identical to the alternate mass hard - point gas but without total momentum conservation",
    "was considered .",
    "numerical results clearly indicate that this model , contrary to the translationally invariant model , obeys the fourier law .    in perspective",
    ", these results demonstrate that diffusive energy transport and fourier law can take place in marginally stable ( non - chaotic ) interacting many - particle systems . as a consequence exponential instability ( lyapunov chaos ) is not necessary for the establishment of the fourier law .",
    "furthermore , they show that breaking the total momentum conservation is crucial for the validity of fourier law while , somehow surprisingly , a less important role seems to be played by the degree of dynamical chaos .",
    "in section  [ sec : fourier ] we have shown that strong , exponential unstable , classical chaos is not necessary ( actually , strictly speaking , is not even sufficient @xcite ) for normal transport . in this connection ,",
    "a main feature of quantum motion is the lack of exponential dynamical instability@xcite .",
    "thus it is interesting to inquire if , and under what conditions , fourier law emerges from the laws of quantum mechanics .",
    "we consider an ising chain of @xmath3 spins @xmath4 with coupling constant @xmath39 subject to a uniform magnetic field @xmath40 , with open boundaries .",
    "the hamiltonian reads @xmath41 where the operators @xmath42 are the pauli matrices for the @xmath43-th spin , @xmath44 .",
    "we set the coupling constant @xmath45 . in this system ,",
    "the only trivial symmetry is a reflection symmetry , @xmath46 . moreover",
    "the direction of the magnetic field affects the qualitative behavior of the system : if @xmath47 , the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h ] ) corresponds to the ising chain in a transversal magnetic field . in this case",
    "the system is integrable as ( [ eq : h ] ) can be mapped into a model of free fermions through standard wigner - jordan transformations .",
    "when @xmath48 is increased from zero , the system is no longer integrable and when @xmath48 is of the same order of @xmath49 quantum chaos sets in leading to a very complex structure of quantum states as well as to fluctuations in the spectrum that are statistically described by random matrix theory ( rmt ) @xcite .",
    "the system becomes again ( nearly ) integrable when @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , by choosing the direction of the external field we can explore different regimes of quantum dynamics .    the onset of quantum chaos is commonly studied in terms of the nearest neighbor level spacing distribution @xmath51 that gives the probability density to find two adjacent levels at a distance @xmath52 . for an integrable system the distribution @xmath51 has typically a poisson distribution @xmath53 .",
    "in contrast , in the quantum chaos regime ( for hamiltonians obeying time - reversal invariance ) , @xmath51 is given by the gaussian orthogonal ensemble of random matrices ( goe ) .",
    "in this case , @xmath51 is well - approximated by the wigner surmise @xmath54 , exhibiting the so - called `` level repulsion '' .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] we show the results of our numerical simulations of system ( [ eq : h ] ) for three different values of the magnetic field : ( _ i _ ) _ chaotic case _",

    "@xmath51 was obtained by diagonalizing the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h ] ) for a chain of length @xmath58 , averaging over even and odd parity sub - spectra .",
    "the curves correspond to @xmath59 ( dashed line ) and to @xmath60 ( dotted line ) . ]    in order to study energy transport we need to couple both ends of the chain of spins to thermal reservoirs at different temperatures . in @xcite we have devised a simple way to simulate this coupling , namely the state of the spin in contact with the bath is statistically determined by a boltzmann distribution with parameter @xmath61 .",
    "our model for the reservoirs is analogous to the stochastic thermal reservoirs defined by eqs .",
    "[ eq : baths ] and we thus call it a _ quantum stochastic reservoir_. in what follows we use units in which planck and boltzmann constants are set to unity @xmath62",

    "additionally the leftmost and rightmost spins of the chain are coupled to quantum stochastic reservoirs at temperatures @xmath64 and @xmath65 respectively .",
    "the action of the quantum reservoirs is as follows : at times @xmath66 with @xmath43 integer the boundary spins couple to the quantum reservoirs .",

    "it was shown that averages over the ensemble of quantum trajectories or time averages over a quantum trajectory are sufficient to reconstruct a thermal density matrix operator that correctly describes the internal thermal state of the system in and out of equilibrium .",
    "moreover , the time averaged expectation values of the local energy density can be used as a consistent canonical local temperature . in order to compute the energy profile",
