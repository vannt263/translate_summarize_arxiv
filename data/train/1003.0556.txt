    "since the discovery of agn , variability was established as a main property of the population and it was among the first ones to be explored @xcite .",
    "the luminosities of agn have been observed to vary in the whole electromagnetic range and the majority of the objects are exhibiting continuum variations of about 20% on timescales of months to years @xcite . from a physical point of view , variations can set limits on the size of the central emitting region and the differences in the variability properties in the x - ray , optical and radio bands provide important information on the underlying structure .",
    "the mechanism of variability itself is still unknown and a variety of models have been proposed @xcite .",
    "thus , the study of the agn variability is very important and can put constraints on the models describing the agn energy source and the agn structure .    on the other hand , supernovae ( sn )",
    "are very powerful cosmological probes and their systematic discovery outside the local universe has led to major scientific results , like the confirmation that the universe is accelerating @xcite .",
    "such studies require well sampled light curves and large statistical samples which can be achieved by monitoring wide areas of the sky to very faint limiting magnitudes .",
    "this kind of surveys produce huge amounts of data that can be suitable also for other scientific studies .",
    "for example , given that the time sampling is adequate , data gathered during sn searches can be used to detect agn through variability .",
    "one of the main purposes of this work is to explore this possibility and create suitable tools for the efficient selection of agn in such databases .",
    "the two projects that have provided us with their data are : the southern intermediate redshift eso supernova search ( stress , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the essence ( equation of state : supernovae trace cosmic expansion ) survey @xcite .",
    "the stress survey @xcite includes 16 fields with multi - band information .",
    "each of those covers an area of 0.3deg@xmath2 and has been monitored for 2 years with the eso / mpi 2.2 m telescope . for this study",
    "we choose to use the so - called axaf field , which is centered at @xmath3=03:32:23.7 , @xmath4=-27:55:52 ( j2000 ) and overlaps with various surveys , which provide us with further data , such as the combo-17 survey @xcite with measurements in 5 wide and 12 narrow filters , resulting in a low resolution spectrum , the eso imaging survey ( eis , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the goods survey @xcite and the two x - ray surveys , chandra deep field south ( cdfs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the extended - cdfs survey ( ecdfs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for our variability study of the axaf field",
    "we have used 8 epochs obtained in the v band , during the period 1999 - 2001 , thus covering 2 years . for each source , detected in at least 5 epochs , we have measured the average magnitude and its r.m.s .",
    "variation which is then compared with a 3@xmath5 threshold we have obtained averaging the r.m.s in bins of magnitude .",
    "details on the calculation of the variability threshold can be found in @xcite .",
    "this procedure has yielded a catalogue of 132 agn candidates down to v=24  mag .    despite all the active surveys in our area ,",
    "only 31% of our candidates have public spectroscopic information .",
    "for this reason we have performed a spectroscopic follow up using emmi at the eso / ntt ( la silla ) .",
    "we obtained low resolution spectra for 27 sources belonging to the bright part of our sample ( v@xmath621.3mag ) .",
    "we now have 55% of our candidates spectroscopically confirmed .",
    "the remaining objects are typically fainter than what we have been able to observe so far .",
    "based on this dataset a complex picture emerges . out of the 27 sources for which we have obtained spectra , 17 are broad line agns ( blagns ) , 1 is a normal galaxy , and a considerable amount ( 7 ) are narrow emission line galaxies ( nelgs ) .",
    "the remaining two sources are stars .",
    "the spectra of all the sources we have observed with details about their properties are presented by @xcite .    among the normal galaxies and the nelgs , which make up the low luminosity part of our candidates , we may distinguish two groups . a fraction of these sources ( 7/14 ) displays high variability and their colours ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) as well as x - ray to optical ratio ( x / o ) , are consistent with agn ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "the other 7 sources , are less variable , have lower x / o ratios and their colours are dominated by the host galaxy . according to our analysis , these latter sources have properties consistent with low luminosity agn ( llagn ) , contaminated by the light of the host galaxy .",
    "all these sources have extended morphologies and would not have been detected by the color technique , that is limited to point like sources , nor by their x - ray emission since they are not detected in the hard x - ray band ( 2 - 8kev ) despite the 1ms exposure time for the cdfs . for the nelgs with the necessary lines detected to place them in the diagnostic diagram @xcite , we find that they tend to lie in the locus of the composite sources .    out of the 65 known blagns in our field , 47 ( 72% )",
    "are found to display significant variability .",
    "the confirmed blagns of our sample have an average x / o of 0.55 .",
    "this value is consistent with the x / o of 0.31 obtained by @xcite for optically selected samples , while the x - ray selected sources present a ratio of x / o@xmath01.2 .",
    "this is a further indication that by using variability as a selection technique we probe a different part of the agn population , favouring the identification of x - ray weak sources .",
    "this fact , in combination with the known correlation between variability amplitude and luminosity ( in the sense that agn of lower luminosity show larger variability amplitudes ) makes variability an ideal tool in selecting llagns .",
    "still 45% of our candidates remain without optical spectroscopy because of their faintness . in order to better understand the complex llagn population , spectroscopy to fainter flux limits is needed .",
    "the essence survey @xcite has been active for 6 years ( 2002 - 2007 ) and was carried out with the blanco 4 m telescope at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) .",
    "the cadence of the observations was every other night , for 20 nights around new moon , for 3 months per year in the r and i band .",
    "this resulted in very well sampled light curves for all sources in the 12deg@xmath2 field .    in order to test our variability method",
    "we have used only part of the available light curves that cover a 2 year period .",
    "as it was proven by our previous experience in the axaf field , such timespan is a good compromise between selecting agn and discriminating against supernova outbursts .",
    "in such a wide time - baseline with an average of 30 epochs per light curve , the variation caused by the sn is well limited in time and gets diluted , thus the source does not appear as variable .",
    "in fact less than 10 of our variable sources resulted to be known sn discovered by the survey .",
    "the adopted strategy for the essence dataset is not exactly the same as in the axaf field , mainly because we have used the light curves produced directly by the pipeline of the survey for the needs of the project . here",
    "the variability threshold was linked to the noise of the data and not the intrinsic variability of the distribution . in order to minimize spurious detections",
    ", the sources had to show significant variability in both bands in order to be classified as candidates . following this criterion",
    "we have created a list of @xmath04800 variable objects down to a magnitude of 22 in the r band .    since our light curves are composed by a large number of epochs ( an average of 30 epochs in each light curve ) , we may also derive the structure function ( sf ) for each object .",
    "the structure function ( sf ) is a method of quantifying time variability and according to @xcite , it is defined as :    @xmath9^{2}\\}^{1/2}\\ ] ]    where , n(@xmath10 ) is the number of epochs for which @xmath11=@xmath10 and the relative magnitude measurements are summed .",
    "we have defined subsamples of candidates , depending on the shape of their sf . a flat sf",
    "shows that the examined timelag is larger than the characteristic time of variability and should indicate sources that are not variable or the period of their variability is much shorter than the probed period . in the case of agn",
    ", variability is known to increase with time and for the time baseline of the 2 years sampled by our light curves , it should result to an ascending sf .",
    "thus , for our spectroscopic follow - up we have chosen candidates with ascending or generally non - flat sf . in fig.2",
    "we can see examples of light curves and sfs of sources that were subsequently confirmed as agn by our follow - up .    during the same spectroscopic",
    "run with emmi at ntt , we have obtained low resolution spectra for 58 sources that belong to the subsample with the ascending sf and their magnitudes range between 18.5 and 20.5 in the r band .",
    "53 ( 91% ) were confirmed as broad line agn and we have a secure redshift determination .",
    "3 sources show only one broad emission line and a power law continuum , typical of agn and although we can not claim an accurate redshift for these sources , we can still consider them as @xmath12 @xmath13 agn . this brings our success rate to @xmath097% .",
    "the remaining sources show absorption features of which , one is being recognized as normal galaxy . in fig.3",
    "we show the position of the observed sources in the distribution of their variability versus their magnitude .",
    "the average redshift of the observed candidates is @xmath6z@xmath14=1.40 .",
    "details about the variability method and the comparison of our sample with other agn samples existing in the same fields will be presented in boutsia et al . .",
    "we have applied a variability selection method to data collected by sn searches in order to detect agn through variability .",
    "we have been very successful in detecting new agns , which had escaped traditional selection techniques and have confirmed a large number of already known agns in these fields .",
    "this proves that the agn field can benefit from such synergic agn - sn surveys . after a spectroscopic follow - up , a considerable fraction of our variable candidates turned out to be `` variable galaxies '' with narrow emission lines and properties consistent with llagns diluted by the host galaxy . by combining the criterion for variability with a secondary criterion concerning the shape of the sf",
    ", we created highly reliable agn samples , since @xmath097% of our candidates belonging to such a sample was confirmed as blagn . in an era that large survey telescopes are being developed",
    ", such variability studies can give valuable feed - back both for determining the strategy of the observations as well as for the development of software and pipelines that will allow the scientific community to fully exploit the huge datasets that will be produced .",
