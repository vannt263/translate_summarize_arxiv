    "one of the most important discoveries of the past year in hadron physics was the experimental confirmation by lhcb  @xcite of a new type of hadron joining the @xmath3 mesons and @xmath4 baryons  the _ tetraquark _ ( @xmath5 ) resonance @xmath6 .",
    "in fact , this state is just one of an ever - growing menagerie of hadrons now believed to be tetraquarks , all of which have been observed since the 2003 discovery by belle  @xcite of an unusually narrow charmonium - like state , the @xmath7 .",
    "however , until the discovery of charged states ( now called @xmath8 ) , one could not be certain that the @xmath7 was not just an unusual conventional charmonium state or a hybrid @xmath9 ; and until the observation of a phase @xmath10 increase by @xmath11 radians in the complex scattering amplitude in which @xmath8 is produced  @xcite , one could not be certain that the states are true resonances as opposed to , say , kinematical reflections of @xmath12-channel exchanges",
    ". there now seems to be little doubt that the @xmath6 is a tetraquark resonance with @xmath13 quantum numbers and valence quark structure @xmath14 .",
    "in addition , all indications suggest that the charge - zero @xmath7 is a @xmath13 @xmath15 state , where @xmath3 is some linear combination of @xmath16 and @xmath17 .    but waiting for the final confirmation of the tetraquark label did not preclude early speculation on the composition and structure of such states . the initial interpretation  and",
    "still the most prevalent one  is that the tetraquarks are di - meson molecules , bound together by color van der waals - type forces ( see  @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "this interpretation is suggested by the proximity of the mass of several of the states to the corresponding two - meson thresholds .",
    "for example , @xmath18  mev .",
    "however , several other tetraquark candidates lie just above such thresholds  clearly muddling the simple bound - state interpretation  and several others lie nowhere near any two - meson thresholds .",
    "furthermore , the substantial prompt production cross section for the @xmath7 at colliders seems to be incompatible with the state being solely composed of loosely - bound meson pairs  @xcite  even taking into account a substantial modification due to final - state interactions  @xcite .",
    "another well - known interpretation is _ hadro - charmonium _",
    "@xcite , in which an ordinary charmonium state lies at the core of a light - quark cloud , although the cohesiveness of such states , and the extent to which they mix with conventional charmonium states , is unclear .    in this work ,",
    "we employ yet another noteworthy interpretation for the tetraquark states , that of a diquark - antidiquark ( @xmath10-@xmath19 ) bound - state pair .",
    "originally proposed for charmonium - like tetraquarks in ref .",
    "@xcite , the diquark picture has the advantage of possessing a much richer color dynamics ( the diquarks necessarily being color nonsinglets ) , but it also has the potential drawback of producing many more tetraquark states than are currently observed .",
    "however , if one assumes that the dominant interactions are due to spin - spin couplings within each diquark , one can obtain a rather satisfactory accounting of the presently known tetraquark candidates  @xcite .",
    "one may wonder why the component quarks in a @xmath10-@xmath20 bound state do not immediately rearrange themselves into color - singlet @xmath3 pairs , returning one to the molecular picture .",
    "indeed , the strength of the color force between quarks ( or antiquarks ) in su(3)-color representations @xmath21 and @xmath22 coupling to a representation @xmath23 is proportional to the combination of quadratic casimirs given by @xmath24 .",
    "the only attractive channels are the @xmath3 singlet ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) and the @xmath28 antitriplet ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) , with the former being twice as strong as the latter .    rather than treating the tetraquark as a metastable @xmath10-@xmath19 bound state , we proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite a new paradigm , in which the tetraquarks are the quantized modes of a color flux - tube stretched between a rapidly separating @xmath10 ( color-@xmath31 ) and @xmath20 ( color-*3 * ) pair .",
    "this picture naturally explains why many , but not all , of the tetraquarks lie near hadron thresholds ( energies at which the color string is allowed to break ) ; for example , the state @xmath32 lies only slightly higher than the lightest charmed - baryon @xmath33 threshold at 4573  mev , and it decays dominantly to this baryon pair , as is explained by the fragmentation of the flux - tube to a light @xmath34 pair .",
    "the widths of the states below this threshold are not especially large , because they hadronize by wave function overlaps with the mesons formed from quarks in @xmath20 and antiquarks in the @xmath10 , which in turn can achieve a substantial separation ( over 1  fm ) if sufficient initial kinetic energy is imparted to the system , as in a @xmath35-meson decay",
    ". evidence for this large separation is apparent in the decay of the @xmath36 , which greatly favors coupling to @xmath37 rather than @xmath38  @xcite  even though the charmonium states have the same @xmath39 quantum numbers and there is smaller phase space for the heavier ( and spatially much larger ) @xmath40 .",
    "this paper presents the first dynamical study of the @xmath10-@xmath19 tetraquark picture , using the well - known _ constituent counting rules _",
    "@xcite , which determine the fall - off scaling of hard exclusive processes in the high - energy regime .",
    "in essence , the counting rules predict that the cross sections , or equivalently , the form factors for processes at high values of mandelstam @xmath41 at fixed @xmath42 , fall off as a power of @xmath41 directly determined by the total number ( incoming plus outgoing ) of fundamental constituents participating in the hard subprocess . here",
    "we are interested in comparing the effects of @xmath10-@xmath20 state production with that due to meson - meson states on the masses of tetraquark resonances coupled to them , using dispersion relation techniques . in another paper to appear  @xcite , we will directly discuss the phenomenological uses of the cross - section scalings themselves .",
    "the method to be used is the well - known _ cusp effect _ , in which the presence of thresholds for the opening of on - shell states coupled to resonances creates a modification to the self - energy function that tends to drag the bare resonant pole mass toward the threshold .",
    "the basic idea appears to have been known since the early 1960 s , but was first presented in its current form in the mid 1990 s  @xcite , and first applied to the new heavy exotics in 2008  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , recent calculations  @xcite show that these states can not _ just _ be cusps ( although ones in the @xmath43 system might be  @xcite ) ; the presence of real resonances is required . in this paper",
    "we compare the effectiveness of this dragging effect due to the presence of both @xmath10-@xmath19 and two - meson thresholds , and find first , that the potential amount of shifting of resonant poles decreases for heavier - quark systems ( @xmath1 vs.  @xmath44 vs.  @xmath45 ) , and second , that the @xmath10-@xmath20 states become more effective at pole - dragging than two - meson states for the @xmath44 and @xmath46 thresholds associated with the new heavy exotic resonances . since @xmath10 is not a color singlet , using a @xmath10-@xmath20 threshold in a qcd dispersion relation ( where `` on shell '' usually means not only that the particles are not virtual , but also asymptotically free ) must be interpreted with some care ; for the purposes of this calculation , we assert that the substantial @xmath10-@xmath20 separation advocated in @xcite creates states that are in a sense `` almost '' free , and therefore possess an on - shell threshold .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : cusp ] we briefly review the meaning and origin of the cusp effect , and establish the mathematical formalism used for its implementation , with some details relegated to the appendix . in sec .",
    "[ sec : diqthresh ] we address in greater detail the issue of whether diquark pairs truly produce physically meaningful thresholds .",

    "[ sec : concl ] we summarize and indicate future directions .",
    "the cusp effect has a rather straightforward origin in the analyticity of the self - energy functions @xmath47 that appear in the propagator of resonant or bound states and source the creation of their decay products . closely following notation introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite , we start with the propagator denominator @xmath48 where @xmath49 index resonances that can mix ; for simplicity , in this work we assume only unmixed propagating states and henceforth suppress this index .",
    "the sign of @xmath47 is chosen to match that appearing in the majority of quantum field theory texts ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) ; when positive , it is seen to correspond to an attractive interaction .",
    "@xmath50 is analytic everywhere in the complex @xmath41 plane except for cuts ( or poles ) along the positive real @xmath41 axis that result from the opening of on - shell channels , which we label by @xmath51 .",

    ", at @xmath62 and falls off in either direction , remaining always positive for @xmath67 but generally passing through the axis ( and effectively creating a potential barrier ) for some value of @xmath68 .",

    "let us consider the special case @xmath81 described in  @xcite .",
    "this particular choice is unphysical because unitarity and perturbative qcd require real hadronic form factors to fall off at large @xmath41 , but it is an interesting toy model for cases in which the dispersion relation is dominated by the form factor near threshold .",

    "before proceeding , one must address the issue mentioned in the introduction of whether a @xmath10 state , being colored , really possesses a well - defined mass , and therefore whether the @xmath10-@xmath20 state really possesses a well - defined threshold .",
    "strictly speaking , the quoted masses of colored particles like quarks depend upon the choice of renormalization scheme , and therefore do not carry the same status of being observables as do meson masses .",
    "nevertheless , quark masses are extracted using a variety of methods ( quark models , lattice gauge theory , sum rules , _ etc . _ ) , and the numerical values thus obtained are bestowed with some degree of physical significance .",
    "an elegant discussion of such issues appears in the classic text by georgi  @xcite ( sec .",
    "3.2 ) ; he considers a universe in which the strong coupling constant @xmath122 is as small as @xmath123 , but confinement still occurs .",
    "the scale @xmath124 then becomes extremely large ( @xmath125  cm ) , and for all practical purposes , quarks would be just as visible in experiments as electrons , and would possess easily determined quantum numbers such as mass .",
    "georgi then continues the analysis by increasing @xmath124 towards its physical @xmath126 value , and argues that not until @xmath127 ( including the running value of @xmath122 ) do quarks become inseparable from their hadrons , and hence hidden from view .",
    "we take this lesson as our touchstone , that substantial physical separation implies identifiability as particles with well - characterized masses , even in the presence of confinement .",
    "the color dynamics allows diquarks to form as bound states , and kinematics permits them to separate a distance before being forced to hadronize .",
    "the salient question then becomes : how far is far enough , before the diquarks can reasonably be said to appear as identifiable particles possessing a well - defined mass threshold ?",
    "we argue that this event occurs when the @xmath10-@xmath20 state can no longer be mistaken for one in which the diquark wave functions have substantial wave function overlap . of course , the size of diquark wave functions is not at all a known quantity , but we can obtain a reasonable estimate by considering the size of mesons with analogous quark content . that is , instead of @xmath128 and @xmath129 diquarks , we consider @xmath130 mesons . again , meson radii are not directly observable quantities and the precise nature of the fall - off of their wave functions with @xmath131 is unknown , but at least in this case some calculations have been performed .",
    "for example , ref .",
    "@xcite calculates the electromagnetic charge radius of the @xmath132 to be 0.43  fm , rather smaller than charge radii of the unflavored mesons , due to the presence of the heavy @xmath133 quark .",
    "one may expect the diquarks to be slightly larger because the initial color attraction between the quark components is smaller ; however , the true size is dominated by some combination of nonperturbative gluodynamics and the heavy quark mass , so we expect the diquarks to be not much larger .",
    "we take from this result that 1  fm is not an unreasonable estimate for the onset of significant separation between the diquarks , and hence the identification of a well - defined diquark mass and pair - production threshold .",
    "again , an important ingredient in this estimate appears to be the presence of heavy quarks , which might very well be related to the reason why exotics have first become clearly visible in the charm system .",
    "furthermore , as first pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the cusp effect treatment of the previous section holds at full strength [ as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhodef ] ) ] only for thresholds of particles in a relative @xmath41 wave .",
    "only certain @xmath10-@xmath20 states will fall into this category , in precisely the same way that the conventional cusp effect is most prominent for thresholds of mesons produced in a relative @xmath41 wave .",
    "a very interesting question is how the diquark thresholds disappear if their separation is insufficient to prevent a large wave function overlap .",
    "we speculate that these thresholds gradually dissolve into correlations between the couplings to meson pairs to which the exotics preferentially decay , and such correlations would create a smeared `` cusp '' that would gradually disappear for smaller and smaller diquark separations .",
    "the exact separation at which such a structure first appears , and hence the assumption that a viable diquark cusp effect is supportable , is very much open to debate , but we believe 1  fm is a reasonable estimate .",
    "the diquark cusps studied in this paper are of course based upon an idealized picture of this behavior .",
    "in this section we present a brief summary of the constituent counting rules developed over a number of years following the advent of perturbative qcd ( pqcd )  @xcite .",
    "they reflect the underlying conformal features and scale invariance of the qcd coupling .",
    "more recently , they were derived nonperturbatively by polchinski and strassler  @xcite using ads / qcd .",

    "these features supply factors of @xmath140 and @xmath141 to the invariant amplitude @xmath142 , respectively .",

    "these effects include the running of @xmath156 , the renormalization - group scaling of the constituent distribution amplitudes  @xcite , the presence of sudakov logarithms  @xcite , `` pinch '' singularities due to the vanishing of internal gluon propagators  @xcite , and endpoint singularities occurring in configurations where some of the constituents do not share an @xmath157 fraction of the hard scale @xmath41  @xcite .",

    "the intuition one develops for the cusp effect needs to be more nuanced .",
    "in fact , the entire portion of the cusp over which re  @xmath217 is positive and appreciable in magnitude provides a source of attraction for the pole .",
    "for example , even if the bare pole mass sits exactly at @xmath218 , the cusp can drive the pole mass to a value slightly larger than @xmath219 ; such an effect is visible in the results in table  ii of ref .",

    ", one expects that the cusp is most effective in dragging the pole if either the coupling @xmath56 to the opening threshold is large , or the cusp function re  @xmath215 is broad in @xmath41 .",
    "the question of whether the mesonic or diquark threshold cusp is more effective in pole dragging thus comes down to these two criteria .    to exhibit the effectiveness of the cusp numerically , we first superimpose two plots in fig .  [",

    "[ fig : kk ] , [ fig : dd ] , and [ fig : bb ] .",
    "first , the maximum height of the pole - dragging function @xmath230 is much larger in the @xmath1 case than in the @xmath44 or @xmath45 cases , for either diquark or mesonic forms . even taking into account the larger value of @xmath261 for the latter cases ,",
    "the absolute size of the maximal pole dragging is larger for the lighter cases ; to wit , the numbers are about 200  mev , 4.3  mev , and 0.2  mev , respectively . some , but not all , of this decreased effectiveness can be attributed to the decrease of @xmath56 via heavy - quark scaling given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : hqet_scaling ] ) .",
    "indeed , for a fixed value of @xmath294 , the relative size of the pole - dragging effect @xmath230 is found empirically to scale approximately as @xmath295 ; clearly , the magnitude of @xmath261 matters as well . in a related effect , the location of the peak in @xmath230 travels a greater distance from threshold for lighter systems , and it is somewhat larger for the mesonic than the diquark effect , even when the cusp functions themselves have the same peak height .",
    "however , one should not conclude from these facts that the cusp effect is intrinsically less effective for heavy - quark systems ; indeed , a number of the mass splittings between heavy hadrons scale as @xmath296 , so a full analysis would require one to take into account values of @xmath83 that lie naturally closer to @xmath261 .",
    "we have performed the first analysis of the cusp effect due to the opening of diquark - antidiquark thresholds by using constituent counting rules to model their production form factor .",
    "we directly compared our results to those obtained from employing a frequently - used phenomenologically - based meson form factor , and found that the magnitude of the pole - dragging effect is greater in both relative and absolute terms for lighter systems ( @xmath297 vs.@xmath44 or @xmath45 ) .",
    "we also found that the effect due to mesonic cusps is larger than that due to diquark cusps for the @xmath297 threshold , while the diquark cusp effect is stronger for @xmath44 or @xmath45 thresholds .",
    "this calculation is of course an idealization , in that only one threshold is present in each example ; in reality , several thresholds , each with its own strength and contributing with different signs ( due to the different riemann sheets ) are simultaneously present and all contribute to the total effect .",
    "furthermore , this calculation assumes , for maximum clarity of comparison , that the coupling constants for the diquark and mesonic cases give cusp functions of the same height , and that the coupling constants scale with the thresholds according to expectations from heavy - quark effective theory .",
    "any of these approximations can be relaxed in a more detailed analysis .",
    "the central conclusion , however , is that if @xmath10-@xmath20 states exist in the spectrum of qcd , then the opening of their production thresholds produce measurable shifts in the masses of resonances , which must be taken into account in precisely the same way as shifts appearing due to the opening of meson production thresholds .",
