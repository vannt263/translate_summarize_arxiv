    "scalar fields attracted a great deal of attention in cosmology and in relativistic astrophysics in the last twenty years .",
    "it is , indeed , worth mentioning the fundamental role that they play in modeling the early universe and , on the other hand , the relevance of the self - gravitating scalar field model as a test - bed for the cosmic censorship conjecture , that is , whether the singularities which form at the end state of the gravitational collapse are always covered by an event horizon , or not @xcite . in particular , in an important series of papers , christodolou studied massless scalar field sources minimally coupled to gravity . for this very special case",
    "the formation of some naked singularities has been shown , but it has been also shown that such singularities are non generic with respect to the choice of the initial data @xcite .",
    "the massless scalar field is a useful model in studies of gravitational collapse since its evolution equation in absence of gravity - the massless klein - gordon equation on minkowski spacetime - is free of singular solutions .",
    "however , of course , the general case in which the field has non - zero self - interaction potential ( which of course include the massive scalar field as a quadratic potential ) is worth inspecting from the theoretical point of view . further to this , in recent years , interest in models with non vanishing potentials aroused from string theory , since , for instance , dimensional reduction of fundamental theories to four dimensions typically gives rise to self - interacting scalar fields with exponential potentials , coupled to four - dimensional gravity . in this context , the case of potentials which have a negative lower bound plays a special role , since such potentials generate the anti de sitter space as equilibrium solutions @xcite .    as a consequence of their `` fundamental '' origin ,",
    "exponential potentials have been widely considered in the cosmologically - oriented literature ( see @xcite and references therein ) also with the aim of uncovering possible large - scale observable effects @xcite .",
    "a few examples of non trivial potentials ( to be discussed in full details in the sequel ) have been studied in the gravitational collapse scenario as well . in these papers",
    "formation of naked singularities has been found @xcite .",
    "so motivated , in the present paper we study the dynamical behavior of frw ( spatially flat ) scalar field models , imposing only very general conditions on the scalar field potential ; our hypotheses essentially reduce to ask the potential to be bounded from below and divergent when the field diverges . the evolution of collapsing solutions or , equivalently",
    ", time backwards expanding solutions , has been studied previously in the literature mainly making use of dynamical system approaches . from this point of view",
    "foster s work is worth noticing ; indeed , in @xcite existence of past singularities of expanding , spatially flat cosmologies are found in terms of sufficient conditions on the ( nonnegative ) potential @xmath0  in particular , the proof relies on the existence of a coordinate transformation that brings @xmath1 in @xmath20,\\epsilon]$ ] , and satisfies some other regularity conditions together with the transformed potential ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* definition 2 ) ) . in these cases ,",
    "the behavior is proved to be essentially similar to the behavior in the massless case , and so a past singularity exists and it is stable with respect to the choice of the data",
    ".    other worth - mentioning works are those related to the case of non - minimal coupling , such as @xcite , in which flat frw model are studied using conformal transformations that bring the models into the standard form , and @xcite , where singularity formation for non minimal coupling models is analyzed for some specific form of the potential .",
    "as mentioned above , in this paper we consider a class of potentials @xmath3 which is quite more general with respect to those previously considered .",
    "in particular , we weaken assumptions about the behavior of the potential at infinity ( which are necessary in the dynamical systems approach ) thanks to an accurate use of the implicit function theorem .",
    "indeed a suitable estimate of the involved neighborhoods is used to obtain a result of existence , uniqueness , and instability of solution for a particular kind of ordinary differential equation of first order to which the standard theory does not apply straightforwardly ( theorem [ thm : ode ] ) .",
    "another key difference with previously published results is that the potentials may assume negative values .",
    "non negativity of the potential means that the total energy of the scalar field has a positive lower bound ( using this constraint many results for scalar field cosmologies have been actually found @xcite ; see also @xcite ) ; however , in many issues and especially when string theory comes into play , it becomes relevant to inspect spacetimes in which the potential still has a lower bound but this bound is negative ; under certain conditions indeed , potentials of this kind generate solutions with positive total energy @xcite .",
    "since , in particular , a constant negative potential generates an `` equilibrium '' state which is just the anti de sitter solution , within this framework models which are asymptotically anti - de sitter can be inspected @xcite .    within the class @xmath3 of potentials ( to be defined in precise technical terms in the section below ) we prove that - except for a zero measure set of initial data - all the solutions become singular in a finite time . considering such solutions as sources for models of collapsing objects ( with generalized vaidya solutions as the exterior ) we study the nature - blackhole or naked singularity - of such objects .",
    "it turns out that , except possibly for a zero - measure set of initial data , all these `` scalar field stars '' collapse to black holes .",
    "it follows that the existing examples of naked singularities which occur in the literature must be non - generic within the set of possible solutions , and indeed we show in details how this occurs .",
    "homogeneous scalar field models with self - interacting potentials thus respect the weak cosmic censorship hypothesis , at least for a wide class of potentials .",
    "of course , however , the problem of extending this result to the non - homogeneous case remains open .",
    "we are going to consider here homogeneous , spatially flat spacetimes @xmath4\\ ] ] where gravity is coupled to a scalar field @xmath5 , self - interacting with a scalar potential @xmath0 . assigning this function is equivalent to assign the physical properties of the matter source , and thus the choice of the potential can be seen as a choice of the equation of state for the matter model .",
    "therefore , as occurs in models with `` ordinary '' matter ( e.g. , perfect fluids ) , the choice of the `` equation of state '' must be restricted by physical considerations .",
    "stability of energy , in particular , requires the potential to have a lower bound .",
    "we shall thus consider here potentials of class @xmath6 bounded from below ; the lower bound of the potential need not be positive however , so that class of solutions which include ads minima can be considered .",
    "further , we need a set of technical assumptions .",
    "we say that @xmath7 belongs to the set @xmath3 if the following conditions are satisfied :    a1 ) ( structure of the set of critical points ) the critical points of @xmath7 are isolated and they are either minimum points or non - degenerate maximum points    a2 ) ( existence of a suitable bounded `` sub - level '' set ) there exists @xmath8 such that @xmath9 moreover , setting @xmath10}v$ ] , it is @xmath11    a3 ) ( growth condition ) the function defined in terms of @xmath7 and its first derivative @xmath12 as @xmath13 satisfies to @xmath14    we stress that the set @xmath3 defined in terms of the above conditions is sufficiently large to contain all the potentials which have been considered in physical applications so far .",
    "for instance , it contains the standard quartic potential ( @xmath15 ) and , more generally , all the potentials bounded from below whose asymptotic behavior is polynomial ( i.e. @xmath16 for @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) .    once a potential has been chosen , the einstein field equations allow , in principle , to obtain the dynamics of the coupled system composed by the field and the metric .",
    "these equations are given by    @xmath19    the bianchi identity is of course , due to the noether theorem , equivalent to the equation of motion for the field : @xmath20 denoting the energy density of the scalar field by @xmath21 we will actually consider the following system :    @xmath22    of course , it is mandatory to extract the square root in the first equation . since we are considering the collapsing model we choose @xmath23 to be negative and therefore our final system is composed by    @xmath24",
    "let us observe that , using and , the following relation can be seen to hold : @xmath25 that is @xmath26 is monotone .",
    "observe that the two cases - expansion and collapse - are connected by the fact that , in the expanding case , there might be the possibility of reaching a vanishing value of @xmath27 in a finite time @xmath28 .",
    "if this occurs , the model will be ruled from @xmath28 onward by the equations for the collapsing situation .",
    "actually , it will be proved that all such solutions are divergent at some finite time for almost every choice of the initial data , thus yielding a singularity as well .    in what follows , we are going to focus on solutions of the equations   or , better , . actually",
    ", it can be proved @xcite that , if @xmath29 for all @xmath30 and @xmath31 are @xmath32 functions that solve  ( with a non - constant @xmath33 ) then they are solutions of  as well . to prove the converse",
    ", it suffices to derive w.r.t .",
    "time and use to deduce that if ( in some interval @xmath34 $ ] ) , @xmath23 is not identically zero  that is , @xmath35  then solutions of  are also solutions of . finally , the unique case in which @xmath36 and the einstein field equations are satisfied is given by the trivial solution @xmath37 , @xmath38 , with @xmath39 .",
    "the aim of the present section is to study the qualitative behavior of the solutions of  whenever @xmath40 .",
    "the initial data ( on @xmath41 , say ) for the system can be fully characterized in terms of the values of the scalar field @xmath42 and of its first derivative . in what follows we will be mainly interested in constructing models of collapsing object and",
    "therefore we consider only solutions which satisfy the weak energy condition on the initial data surface .",
    "therefore , we assume @xmath43 given a solution @xmath33 , let @xmath44 be the maximal right neighborhood of @xmath41 where the solution is defined , and call @xmath45 .",
    "the main result of this section is that the solution @xmath33 diverges in a finite time for almost every choice of the initial data satisfying , that is @xmath46 is finite for almost all solutions .",
    "this result will in turn allow us ( next section ) to construct models of collapsing objects by matching these solutions with suitable vaidya metrics .",
    "to proceed further , we start by considering only data such that @xmath47 is `` sufficiently large '' , more precisely @xmath48 where , for each choice of the potential @xmath7 in @xmath3 , the constant @xmath49 is the chosen as the same which appears in ( a2 ) .",
    "once the result will be proven for these data , we will extend its validity by removing the restriction .",

    "now , we have proved in lemma [ thm : perla ] the existence of @xmath359 ( which is also equal to @xmath360 ) , and that , actually , @xmath361 vanishes except for a zero  measured set of initial data . on the other hand , using , we get @xmath362 and therefore @xmath363 eventually holds in a left neighborhood of @xmath46 , say @xmath364 , where @xmath23 is decreasing .",
    "it follows that @xmath365t_0,t_s[$ ] , @xmath366 , which is negative by hypotheses .",

    "then @xmath369 is unbounded .",
    "as we have seen , the formation of naked singularities in the above discussed models is _ generically _ forbidden by theorem [ thm : endstate ] .",
    "thus , the theorem does not exclude the existence of initial data which give rise to naked singularities for the given potential , it only assures that such data are non - generic .",
    "actually , there are examples of such solutions containing naked singularities in the literature , and it is our aim here to show how they fit in this scenario .    to discuss this issue , it is convenient to reformulate the dynamics in the following form @xcite . since @xmath370 is strictly decreasing in the collapsing case , we re - write equations , and using @xmath371 instead of @xmath83 as the independent variable . setting @xmath372 we get :    @xmath373    in the above equations , @xmath0 plays of course the same role of `` equation of state '' as before .",
    "however , one can try to prescribe a part of the dynamics and then search if there is a choice of the potential and a set of data which assure that this dynamics is actually an admissible one for the system at hand ( of course , in this way , only the `` on shell '' value of the potential can be reconstructed ) .",
    "in particular , a somewhat natural approach can be that of prescribing the energy ( @xmath374 or equivalently @xmath375 ) .    in @xcite , the case in which the energy density behaves like @xmath376 with @xmath377 positive constant is considered .",
    "it is then shown that for @xmath378 the system forms a naked singularity , and the existence of an interval of values of @xmath377 is interpreted as a _ generic _ violation of cosmic censorship ( that is anyway restored when loop quantum gravity modifications are taken into account , see @xcite ) .",
    "however , due to the equation above , the _ on shell _ functional form of the potential for this example can be calculated to be @xmath379 with @xmath380 .",
    "this potential belongs to the class which has been treated in our previous example [ ex : exp ] , and therefore we know that a generic choice of data must give rise to a blackhole ( for this class the function @xmath381 behaves like a _ strictly positive _",

    ", we get _ exactly _ @xmath385 . therefore , the case discussed in @xcite is precisely the non - generic one .",
    "the constraint on the data which implies non - genericity comes , of course , from the fact that imposing a certain behavior on the function @xmath386 selects a two - dimensional set in the space of the data , characterized by the algebraic constraint @xmath387 .    to complete the analysis",
    ", we observe that , although the evolution of non generic data is not predicted by theorem [ thm : sing - gen ] , we can easily obtain information also in this case . to this aim , observe that , since @xmath141 is finite , equation can be used to prove singularity formation in a finite amount of comoving time with an argument similar to that used in the proof of theorem [ thm : sing - gen ] .",
    "moreover , the metric function @xmath370 behaves asymptotically as @xmath388 : then , if @xmath389 , the function @xmath369 is bounded near the singularity , confirming naked singularity formation ( this choice of @xmath340 corresponds exactly to the choice of @xmath378 in @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ fig : exp - naked ] sketches an example of this kind : the initial data are chosen in the non generical way such that @xmath141 goes like a positive constant as @xmath390 . the singularity forms ( i.e. @xmath26 diverges in a finite time ) , but",
    "choosing @xmath391 not too large , the function @xmath392 on the junction hypersurface @xmath354 remains strictly positive along the evolution up to the singularity .",
    "the above example suggests that hypotheses on the asymptotic behavior of the function @xmath262 can be added , to obtain singularity formation also in the non generic case : indeed , if the potential @xmath0 satisfies the condition @xmath393 i.e. @xmath262 is definitely bounded away from zero , then @xmath141 is finite also in the non generic case , and equation in the proof of theorem [ thm : sing - gen ] can be used to prove the formation of the singularity in a finite amount of time . to analyze the nature of this singularity observe that , if @xmath394 the argument in the proof of theorem [ thm : endstate ] applies , and therefore the collapse ends into a black hole . on the other side ,",
    "if @xmath395 then @xmath396 is eventually positive , and this implies that @xmath397 is bounded , so that the formation of the apparent horizon is forbidden . as a consequence , the collapse ends into a naked singularity .",
    "we have discussed here the qualitative behavior of the solutions of the einstein field equations with homogeneous scalar fields sources in dependence of the choice of the self - interacting potential .",
    "it turns out that whenever a potential satisfies a certain set of general conditions singularity formation occurs for almost every choice of initial data . matching these singular solutions with a vaidya `` radiating star '' exterior we obtained models of gravitational collapse which can be viewed as the scalar - field generalization of the oppenheimer - snyder collapse model , in which a dust homogeneous universe is matched with a schwarzschild solution ( the schwarzschild solution can actually be seen as a special case of vaidya ) .",
    "the oppenheimer - snyder model , as is well known , describes the formation of a covered singularity , i.e. a blackhole ; it is actually the first and simplest model of blackhole formation ever discovered . the same occurs here : indeed we show that homogeneous scalar field collapse generically forms a blackhole . the examples of naked singularities which were found in recent papers @xcite , turn out to correspond to very special cases which , mathematically , are not generic .",
    "therefore , our results here support the weak cosmic censorship conjecture , showing that naked singularities are not generic in homogeneous , self - interacting scalar field collapse .",
    "non - genericity was already well known for _ non self - interacting _",
    "( i.e. @xmath328 ) spherically symmetric scalar fields .",
    "whether the results obtained here can actually be shown to hold also in the much more difficult case of both inhomogeneous and self - interacting scalar fields remains an open problem .",
