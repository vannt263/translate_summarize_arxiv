    "over the past two decades , the pristine setting of atomic bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) has enabled the exploration of numerous physical concepts  @xcite .",
    "one of the principal themes examined involves the interface between nonlinear wave dynamics and such atomic systems , concerning the study of so - called matter - wave solitons  @xcite .",
    "these coherent structures have not only been theoretically predicted but also in many cases experimentally observed .",
    "some relevant examples include bright  @xcite , dark  @xcite and gap  @xcite matter - wave solitons .",
    "higher dimensional analogues of these have also been studied ; these permit a wide variety of interesting structures , such as vortices  @xcite , solitonic vortices and vortex rings  @xcite .    from a bifurcation theoretic perspective , the one - dimensional repulsive version of this problem is interesting but not particularly rich  @xcite in the customary experimental setting of a parabolic trapping potential .",
    "one can systematically trace the bifurcation of nonlinear branches from the corresponding linear ones . as the characteristic eigenvalue parameter ,",
    "the so - called chemical potential , is detuned from the linear limit of the quantum harmonic oscillator , nonlinear states emerge via bifurcation from the trivial branch . however , no subsequent bifurcations occur on these branches even as the chemical potential approaches the other analytically tractable limit of large values , the thomas  fermi ( tf ) limit , where excited states feature the same profile with embedded single or multiple dark solitons",
    ". however , the solutions of the two - dimensional repulsive case are far more intricate and intriguing . in this paper",
    "we revisit the two - dimensional repulsive case with a new numerical tool , the deflated continuation algorithm of farrell et al .",
    "this specific problem is of significant interest for a number of reasons .",
    "it constitutes a prototypical example where numerous secondary bifurcations have been shown to occur @xcite .",
    "these include symmetry - breaking bifurcations and provide the potential for genuinely complex order parameter states bearing vorticity .",
    "these bifurcations are also crucial in modifying the stability characteristics of the states at hand .",
    "hence , as we will see below , this problem provides a very rich testbed for investigating the effectiveness of deflated continuation on an important and intensely studied problem  @xcite . from a mathematical perspective , the analysis of the relevant bifurcations and the resulting vortex - bearing states are still a topic of recent investigation  @xcite .    at the heart of deflated continuation",
    "is a deflation technique for computing previously unknown solutions of differential equations @xcite , and we discuss this first .",
    "suppose we have a nonlinear problem @xmath0 , and one solution @xmath1 has been found via newton iteration from an initial guess @xmath2 .",
    "the central idea of deflation is to construct a new nonlinear problem @xmath3 with the property that newton s method is guaranteed not to converge to @xmath1 .",
    "thus , if newton s method converges from the same initial guess @xmath2 , it will converge to a distinct solution @xmath4 .",
    "the process can then be repeated until newton s method no longer converges to any solution within a fixed amount of work . in this way , many solutions to the same problem can be discovered from a single initial guess . however , there is no guarantee that all of the relevant solutions ( for a given parameter value ) will be obtained in this way , as newton s method may fail to converge on when applied to @xmath5 if initialized far from a solution .",
    "the deflated problem is constructed via the application of a _ deflation operator _ to the residual .",
    "suppose @xmath6 is a nonlinear map between banach spaces , and @xmath1 is an isolated root of @xmath7 , i.e.   @xmath8 is invertible .",
    "in previous work @xcite , @xmath9 was constructed via @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the norm on @xmath12 .",
    "the essential idea is that @xmath13 approaches infinity as @xmath14 faster than @xmath15 approaches 0 , and hence @xmath16 ensuring that newton s method will not converge to @xmath1 when applied to @xmath5 .    in the present case ,",
    "this idea must be modified slightly , as the solutions are no longer isolated : if @xmath1 is a solution , then so is its phase shift @xmath17 for any phase @xmath18 . given knowledge of a solution @xmath1 , we therefore wish to deflate the entire group orbit @xmath19 .",
    "this is achieved by constructing the deflated problem via @xmath20 where @xmath21 represents the amplitude of the complex - valued wavefunction @xmath22 .",
    "as the amplitude is invariant under phase shift , this modified deflation operator eliminates the entire group orbit , ensuring nonconvergence to any solution trivially related to a known solution .",
    "the norm chosen for @xmath12 is the @xmath23 norm , where @xmath24 is the domain on which the pde is posed .",
    "this deflation idea is extended to an algorithm for bifurcation analysis , called deflated continuation , as follows .",
    "suppose a set of solutions @xmath25 is known for the nonlinear problem @xmath26 at a given parameter value @xmath27 , and we wish to compute the solutions at a modified parameter value @xmath28 .",
    "in the first phase of the algorithm , known branches are continued : each solution is used as initial guess for the nonlinear problem at @xmath29 , and the resulting solution deflated . in the second phase , new solutions are sought : each @xmath30 is used again as initial guess for the nonlinear problem at @xmath29 .",
    "in this way , we allow for the discovery of new branches that have bifurcated between @xmath31 and @xmath29 .",
    "if a search is successful , the initial guess @xmath22 is used again .",
    "once the algorithm has exhausted all initial guesses in @xmath25 , it proceeds to compute @xmath32 from @xmath28 , and so on . for a full description of the algorithm ,",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "there are two central advantages of deflated continuation .",
    "first , the algorithm is capable of discovering _ disconnected _ branches , those not continuously connected to known solutions .",
    "second , the algorithm can scale to very fine discretizations of pdes .",
    "the only expensive subroutine required by deflated continuation is the computation of the newton step of the undeflated system ; thus , if a good preconditioner is available for the newton system , the bifurcation diagram of the system can be efficiently computed .",
    "this will be of central importance in future work on the corresponding three - dimensional problem ( see e.g.  ( * ? ? ? * chap .  4 ) ) .",
    "in this problem we have extensive knowledge of the solutions at the linear limit , as described in section [ sec : setup ] .",
    "we augment deflated continuation with this knowledge by using these linear solutions as initial guesses near the bifurcation from the trivial branch .",
    "this augmentation identifies a handful of additional solutions that deflated continuation alone misses , as will be discussed in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we apply deflated continuation to this complex problem in the hope of gaining new insight into its families of solutions .",
    "we will complement the solutions identified via deflation with a stability analysis , aiming at a systematic map of the newly discovered bifurcations and associated stability changes . in section",
    "ii , we will provide a brief overview of the theoretical setup of both the existence and stability problem .",
    "this will explore the analytically tractable linear limit which will subsequently serve as a way of potentially seeding nonlinear solutions away from that limit . in section iii",
    ", we will offer a systematic classification of our numerical results .",
    "based on a detailed comparison with earlier works including  @xcite , we will provide a wealth of novel families and associated bifurcations .",
    "finally , in section iv , we summarize our main findings and discuss the directions of future study arising from this work .",
    "we consider the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation in @xmath33 dimensions ( two spatial and one temporal ) written in dimensionless form ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite for details of the nondimensionalization ) as @xmath34 here @xmath35 stands for the standard laplace operator in 2d and the external potential @xmath36 assumes the standard harmonic form of @xmath37 , with @xmath38 and the normalized trap strength @xmath39 .",
    "the latter represents the ratio of trappings along and transverse to the plane and should thus be @xmath40 ; in what follows we will fix @xmath41 . in the context of becs , the ( complex ) field @xmath42 in eq .",
    "( [ nls_2d_1_comp ] ) represents the macroscopic wave function .",
    "the sign of the nonlinear term is chosen to reflect the self - repulsive nature of the interatomic interactions considered herein .",
    "the construction of stationary solutions is based on the well - known ansatz @xmath43 with chemical potential @xmath31 . by substituting eq .",
    "( [ stat_ansatz ] ) into ( [ nls_2d_1_comp ] ) , we obtain the stationary equation @xmath44 where @xmath45 stands for the nonlinear set of equations utilized in our newton solvers as well as in the deflated continuation method .",
    "the equation is discretized with piecewise linear finite elements for the real and imaginary components using fenics @xcite .",
    "the problem is posed on the domain @xmath46 and homogeneous dirichlet conditions are imposed .",
    "this choice of domain is made to ensure that the influence of truncating the domain is negligible , as the support of the solutions remains far from the boundary .",
    "we use the following diagnostic @xmath47 to summarize the parametric dependence of each steady state branch on @xmath31 .",
    "the above integral represents the number of atoms in the bec , considered as a function of the chemical potential @xmath31 .",
    "when @xmath48 , the nonlinearity of the problem becomes irrelevant and the states bifurcate from the respective linear limit .",
    "we will also use the difference in the number of atoms with respect to a given state @xmath49 in order to highlight the emergence of bifurcations .",
    "this diagnostic , examined in  @xcite , transparently illustrates the origin of different branches .    in the @xmath50 limit",
    ", we can decompose the modes in cartesian form  @xcite as being proportional to : @xmath51 where @xmath52 are the hermite polynomials .",
    "these linear eigenfunctions have corresponding eigenvalues @xmath53 .",
    "on the other hand , the linear eigenfunctions can also be expressed in polar coordinates via @xmath54 with eigenvalues @xmath55 .",
    "the parameters @xmath56 and @xmath57 denote the eigenvalue of the ( @xmath58-component of the ) angular momentum operator and the number of radial zeros of the corresponding eigenfunction respectively .",
    "this radial part of the relevant eigenfunction is given by  @xcite @xmath59 where @xmath60 are the associated laguerre polynomials .",
    "the subscripts in @xmath61 and @xmath62 stand for the cartesian ( c ) and polar ( p ) representations respectively . in most of what follows",
    ", we will use the cartesian notation , but we will occasionally resort to the polar decomposition where convenient .",
    "once the relevant solutions have been identified , we wish to investigate their stability .",
    "we assume the perturbation ansatz around a stationary solution @xmath63 to be of the following form : @xmath64\\big\\rbrace,\\ \\label{lin_ansatz}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is the ( complex ) eigenfrequency , @xmath66 is a ( formal ) small amplitude of the perturbation , and the asterisk stands for complex conjugation . inserting eq .",
    "( [ lin_ansatz ] ) into the nls equation ( [ nls_2d_1_comp ] ) , we obtain at order @xmath67 an eigenvalue problem written in the following matrix form : @xmath68 with eigenfrequencies @xmath69 ( the eigenvalues @xmath70 ) , eigenvectors @xmath71 , and matrix elements given by    @xmath72    the steady state @xmath63 is classified as stable in this hamiltonian system if no eigenfrequency @xmath73 has a non - vanishing imaginary part @xmath74 ; this is because , given the hamiltonian nature , if @xmath65 is an eigenfrequency , so is @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77",
    ". the scenario of stability will be depicted by a solid blue line in the bifurcation diagrams presented below . on the other hand ,",
    "when the solution becomes unstable , two types of instabilities can be identified : i ) _ exponential instabilities _ characterized by a pair of imaginary eigenfrequencies with _",
    "zero _ real part , and ii ) _ oscillatory instabilities _ characterized by a complex eigenfrequency quartet .",
    "these two scenarios are depicted by dashed - dotted red and green lines respectively in the bifurcation diagrams that follow to highlight the nature of the dominant unstable mode ; a transition between these two colors will thus signal a change in the dominant instability type .",
    "we are now ready to describe the different solutions produced by the deflation technique .",
    "the simplest state of the system is its ground state @xmath78 with eigenvalue @xmath79 at the linear limit . as this state is generically stable  @xcite ( i.e. , for all values of @xmath31 from the linear limit to the thomas - fermi regime )",
    ", no bifurcations occur from it .",
    "this solution is well - known and we do not examine it further .      from the point of view of bifurcation analysis",
    ", the first interesting events occur at @xmath80 , with @xmath81 . as is well - known  @xcite , two branches bifurcate from this point ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "one is the dark soliton stripe @xmath82 , fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) .",
    "the other is the single charge ( i.e. , unit vorticity ) vortex of fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) . in cartesian",
    "coordinates this is described as the linear combination @xmath83 ; in polar coordinates it is @xmath84 . among the two ,",
    "the vortex is very robust , incurring no instabilities @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "as the chemical potential increases the stripe progressively approaches a rectilinear dark soliton that is well - known to be subject to a transverse ( modulational ) instability  @xcite .",
    "in fact , there is a whole cascade of such instabilities , arising in the form of pitchfork bifurcations from the stripe @xcite .",
    "the first of these bifurcations gives rise to the emergence of the vortex dipole state , fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) .",
    "this state is well - known and has been studied experimentally  @xcite .",
    "it is dynamically stable except for a narrow interval of oscillatory instability ( associated with a hamiltonian hopf bifurcation ) , as previously noted  @xcite .",
    "the next bifurcation gives rise to a vortex tripole , fig .",
    "[ fig2](d ) . by this stage",
    "the stripe branch is unstable and the vortex tripole inherits this instability .",
    "this is a configuration with three vortices of alternating charge @xmath85 or @xmath86 .",
    "this has also been identified in experiments  @xcite and explored in simulations  @xcite .",
    "this pattern of bifurcations continues to higher excited states for larger values of @xmath31 , yet we do not pursue these bifurcations further , given their earlier analysis , e.g. , in  @xcite .",
    "we now turn to the considerably more complicated case of bifurcations from @xmath87 with @xmath88 .",
    "these bifurcations are also mostly well - known ( although with some important twists to be discussed below ) , and are summarized in figs .",
    "[ fig4]-[fig3 ] .",
    "[ fig4 ] considers @xmath89 and its subsequent bifurcations . just as a single soliton stripe gave rise to a single vortex dipole in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , a double soliton stripe gives rise to a double vortex tripole in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) , a double vortex dipole in fig .",
    "[ fig4](c ) and a double aligned vortex quadrupole in fig .",
    "[ fig4](d ) .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , the double tripole bifurcation ( leading to a state with 6 vortices of alternating charges ) corresponds to a bifurcating stable branch , at least when the latter states first emerge ; for higher @xmath31 they become oscillatorily unstable , acquiring a complex eigenfrequency quartet .",
    "the subsequent bifurcations arise from the already unstable double soliton stripe branch and hence the bifurcating branches are also unstable . for a demonstration of the relevant stability properties ,",
    "see the bottom left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , while the bottom right uses the number of atom difference from the two - soliton branch as a diagnostic to display the occurrences of the different bifurcations ( as the daughter branches depart from zero in this quantity ) .",
    "the bifurcation of the 6 vortex state ( numerically occurring at @xmath90 ; panel  [ fig4](b ) ) precedes that of the 4 vortex one ( numerically occurring around @xmath91 ; panel  [ fig4](c ) ) .",
    "the former bifurcation in the formulation of  @xcite comes from the combination of @xmath92 with @xmath93 , with a @xmath94 phase shift , while the latter emerges from the symmetry - breaking event involving @xmath92 with @xmath95 ( again with a @xmath94 phase shift ) .",
    "it is also intriguing that the theoretical prediction of these bifurcations based on the two mode theory of  @xcite occurs at @xmath96 and @xmath97 , respectively , i.e. , very close to the computationally obtained values , although in reverse order .",
    "[ fig5 ] considers @xmath98 and its subsequent bifurcations .",
    "the first bifurcation from @xmath98 gives rise to a branch which features a dark soliton stripe together with two same charge vortices , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) . nearly concurrent to this bifurcation is the emergence of a branch involving a `` diagonal '' set of 6 vortices ; see fig .",
    "[ fig5](c ) . as discussed in  @xcite , the branch of solutions in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) collides and disappears ( in a saddle - center bifurcation ) with that of fig .",
    "[ fig5](c ) , as @xmath31 is increased .",
    "a subsequent bifurcation gives rise to a branch with a vortex of charge @xmath99 in the middle and four surrounding vortices of charge @xmath100 , fig .",
    "[ fig5](d ) .",
    "explicit algebraic conditions for such states have been obtained via a generating function approach in the large - density thomas  fermi limit @xcite , as have the rectilinear vortex states of fig .",
    "it is also interesting to note , as illustrated in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , the resulting branches out of these bifurcations also feature intervals of oscillatory instabilities .",
    "however , the principal branch @xmath98 out of which these bifurcations arise is unstable , and hence all the bifurcating branches inherit this instability .",
    "this includes the 8 diagonal vortex state  fig .",
    "[ fig5](e ) .",
    "a more complex structure emerges in the context of solutions with radially symmetric density and their bifurcations that are analyzed in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . the first such solution to consider is the ring dark solution state , fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) , which is well - known and has been extensively studied ( for a recent discussion , see  @xcite and the references therein ) . in cartesian notation , this is @xmath101 , while in radial notation this is the @xmath102 state .",
    "a systematic study of the stability of this and related states from the linear limit onwards was conducted in  @xcite , showing that its degeneracy with the vortex quadrupole of fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) leads to an immediate quadrupolar instability through a real eigenvalue pair for this mode .",
    "in contrast , the vortex quadrupole is generically stable , aside from a finite interval of oscillatory instability  @xcite .",
    "the ring dark soliton , progressively becomes more unstable to undulations with higher wavenumbers .",
    "the first to emerge is a hexapolar mode , giving rise ( through a pitchfork bifurcation ) to the vortex hexagons of fig .",
    "[ fig3](c ) ; these may for larger values of @xmath31 also possess oscillatory instabilities ( as denoted in the bottom panel ) .",
    "this pattern continues with an octapolar mode leading to vortex octagons and so on .",
    "another mode bifurcating here from the linear limit is the doubly charged vortex @xmath103 of fig .",
    "[ fig3](d ) .",
    "this state is unstable from the linear limit onwards through a sequence of intervals of oscillatory instabilities originally examined in  @xcite and subsequently retraced in a variety of publications  @xcite .",
    "this state can also be represented via a combination of cartesian eigenstates as @xmath104 . out of this branch",
    "bifurcates branch ( e ) which bears three vortices of the same charge in the periphery and one of opposite charge at the center ( hence has the same total charge of @xmath105 ) .",
    "intriguingly , due to the spherical symmetry of the solution , despite the pitchfork nature of the bifurcation , the branch ( e ) has a pair of eigenvalues of the linearization at the origin , and no genuinely imaginary eigenfrequencies .",
    "it is also interesting to mention here that the bifurcation of ( e ) essentially coincides ( for our parametric resolution of steps of @xmath106 in the chemical potential ) with the stabilization against oscillatory instabilities of the charge @xmath105 branch .",
    "finally , the branch ( f ) emanating from the linear limit and being subject to oscillatory instabilities can be approximated by @xmath107 .",
    "this solution also seems to `` harbor '' 4 vortices , although 2 are more clearly observable close to the condensate center , while the two others are less discernible , merging with the background .",
    "a particularly intriguing feature of the latter branch of solutions is that the systematic classification of  @xcite identified the solutions stemming from the linear limit ( including the ring of fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) , the multipole of fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) , the soliton necklace of fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) , the radially symmetric vortex of fig .",
    "[ fig3](d ) and the vortex necklace of fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) ) .",
    "a remarkable feature of our analysis is that the branch of fig .",
    "[ fig3](f ) appears to have never been previously discussed , to the best of our knowledge .",
    "this branch is subject to oscillatory instabilities , as shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .",
    "the analysis presented heretofore considered bifurcations that have been analyzed in earlier works ; we have successfully validated the method by comparing it to the known bifurcation diagram of this problem and in the process have unraveled novel branches of solutions , such as fig .",

    "[ fig3](f ) .",
    "we next examine the bifurcations emanating from @xmath109 with @xmath110 , plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig6]-[fig6_supp ] .",
    "there are states that we can immediately recognize as emerging out of the cartesian linear limit , the @xmath111 state of fig .",
    "[ fig6](a ) and the @xmath112 state of fig .",
    "[ fig6](b ) .",
    "the @xmath113 state undergoes subsequent bifurcations leading to real eigenvalues and symmetry - breaking destabilizations , e.g. , the six vortex and dark soliton stripe state of fig .",
    "[ fig6](o ) ( see , also ,  fig .  6 of @xcite ) .",
    "this pitchfork bifurcation , due to the admixture of @xmath113 with @xmath114 with a @xmath94 shift ( see the relevant theory of  @xcite ) , leads to the destabilization of the former branch .",

    "this problem has a well - understood linear limit in which the eigenmodes can be identified in closed analytical form , offering guidance for what to expect within the nonlinear regime .",
    "there has been a wide range of publications on this system that have revealed a broad spectrum of nonlinear excitations and their stability characteristics . however , the number of solutions and their complexity increase significantly as the chemical potential increases and analytical calculations become rather tedious . deflated continuation is therefore extremely useful in yielding insight into the problem .",
    "we have identified branches ( from the linear limit ) and configurations bearing complex vortex patterns as genuine ( although often unstable ) solutions of the system .",
    "we have also identified the bifurcations involving such configurations including , to give but one example , the elaborate multi - vortex patterns that arise from the symmetry breaking e.g , for @xmath171 ( figs .",

    "the use of deflated continuation enabled us to identify a wide range of branches that had not been previously numerically constructed or continued .",

    "[ fig7](h ) and ( k ) , and [ fig8](c)-(e ) were obtained only via the problem - specific augmentation described in section [ sec : intro ] , rather than being discovered through deflation from other branches .",
    "this serves as an important caveat : deflated continuation should not be thought of as a universal solvent that blindly reveals all solutions to a particular bifurcation problem , but as a useful tool that becomes even more powerful when combined with physical insight . in particular , a deep understanding of the underlying physics of the system ( in this case knowledge of the linear limit )",
    "remains of paramount value in uncovering the complexity of its landscape of stationary solutions .",
    "it is conceivable that the robustness of deflated continuation could be improved by reducing the continuation step - size or by employing more robustly globalized nonlinear solvers , thus enabling the method to detect more branches .",
    "this issue merits further computational investigation .",
    "nevertheless , the significant success of deflation continuation in the present setting suggests that it is well suited to identifying steady states in multi - dimensional pdes with such energy landscapes , providing insights on the connections between different extrema ( and saddle points ) in them . in the context of becs",
    "there exists a wide array of problems that are very much worth pursuing .",

    "another important extension is to three - dimensional configurations in a single component , including dark solitons , vortex rings , vortex lines , hopfions etc .",
