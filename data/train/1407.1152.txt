    "the bakamjian - thomas ( bt ) relativistic quark models @xcite are a class of models with a fixed number of constituents in which the states are covariant under the poincar group .",
    "the model relies on an appropriate lorentz boost of the eigenfunctions of a hamiltonian describing the hadron spectrum at rest .",
    "we have proposed a formulation of this scheme for the meson ground states @xcite and demonstrated the important feature that , in the heavy quark limit , the current matrix elements , when the current is coupled to the heavy quark , are _ covariant_. we have extended this scheme to p - wave excited states @xcite .    moreover , these matrix elements in the heavy quark limit exhibit isgur - wise ( iw ) scaling @xcite . as demonstrated in @xcite , given a hamiltonian describing the spectrum , the model provides an unambiguous result for the isgur - wise functions , the elastic @xmath9 @xcite and the inelastic to p - wave states @xmath10 , @xmath11 @xcite .    on the other hand , the sum rules ( sr ) in the heavy quark limit of qcd , like bjorken @xcite and uraltsev sr @xcite are analytically satisfied in the model @xcite , as well as sr involving higher derivatives of @xmath9 at zero recoil @xcite .    in @xcite",
    ", we have chosen the godfrey - isgur hamitonian @xcite , that gives a very complete description of the light @xmath12 and heavy @xmath13 meson spectra in order to predict within the bt scheme the corresponding iw functions for the ground state and the excited states .",
    "similar work has been been performed for @xmath13 meson decay constants @xcite and to demonstrate within the bt scheme new heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) sr involving isgur - wise functions and decay constants @xcite .",
    "a detailed and very useful account of the bt scheme for the calculation of isgur - wise functions and heavy meson decay constants and their numerical calculation within the godfrey - isgur hamiltonian has been given in the phd thesis of vincent mornas @xcite .",
    "as a further test , we have computed in @xcite , the vector , scalar and axial charge densities for the ground states @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( @xmath16 doublet ) and for the excited states @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( @xmath19 doublet ) . in this case the active quark is the light quark , and one can show that , unlike the case of the active heavy quark , the current matrix elements are not covariant . for the calculation , we have adopted the natural reference frame for this problem , the heavy meson rest frame . as shown in @xcite , the agreement with lattice data in the unquenched approximation",
    "is really striking , and provides both a test of the bt scheme and of the gi hamiltonian that describes the spectrum .",
    "a main motivation to undertake this work has been the so - called `` @xmath20 versus @xmath21 puzzle '' that , based on rather old data , states the fact that the semileptonic decay rates @xmath6 are much larger than the expectations of the heavy quark limit , while the semileptonic decay rates @xmath22 are roughly consistent with this limit .",
    "a precise discussion of this puzzle has been done in ref .",
    "updated data by babar @xcite and belle @xcite confirm the problem , although there are significant differences between both experiments .",
    "the @xmath20 vs. @xmath21 puzzle is nicely exemplified by the uraltsev sum rule @xcite : [ 1.1e ] _ n ( |_3/2^(n ) ( 1)|^2 - |_1/2^(n ) ( 1)|^2 ) = 1 4    if one neglects completely higher excitations and the ground state ( @xmath23 ) dominates the sum of the _ differences _ of the l.h.s . of ( [ 1.1e ] ) , one expects @xmath24 .",
    "in addition , the phase space factors make much larger the br for @xmath22 relatively to the @xmath6 one .",

    "1/2(1 ) = 0.22 _ 3/2(1 ) = 0.54    on the other hand , calculations in the lattice in the unquenched approximation @xcite point to a similar conclusion [ 1.2bise ] _",

    "1/2(1 ) = 0.52 0.03    let us finally underline that the @xmath20 vs. @xmath21 puzzle does not seem to be present , assuming factorization , in the nonleptonic decays @xmath25 , as shown by the belle results @xcite , phenomenologically analyzed in ref .",

    "since the current matrix elements in the bt model are only covariant in the heavy quark limit if the current is coupled to the heavy quark , the calculation of the @xmath26 corrections must be done in a particular reference frame .",
    "we discuss this problem in section 4 and give arguments to adopt the equal velocity frame ( evf ) , where the moduli of the initial and final three - vector meson velocities are equal .",

    "<S> the bakamjian - thomas relativistic quark model for hadron current matrix elements , while non - covariant at finite mass , is successful in the heavy quark limit : form factors are covariant and satisfy isgur - wise scaling and bjorken - uraltsev sum rules . motivated by the so - called `` @xmath0 vs. @xmath1 puzzle '' in @xmath2 decays to positive parity @xmath3 , we examine the implications of the model at finite mass . in the elastic case @xmath4 , </S>",
    "<S> the hqet constraints for the @xmath5 corrections are analytically fulfilled . a number of satisfying regularities is also found for inelastic transitions . </S>",
    "<S> we compute the form factors using the wave functions given by the godfrey - isgur potential . </S>",
    "<S> we find a strong enhancement in the case @xmath6 for @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> this enhancement is linked to a serious difficulty of the model at finite mass for the inelastic transitions , namely a violation of the hqet constraints at zero recoil formulated by leibovich et al . </S>",
    "<S> these are nevertheless satisfied in the non - relativistic limit for the light quark . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that these hqet rigorous constraints are crucial in the construction of a sensible relativistic quark model of inelastic form factors .    * finite mass corrections for @xmath8 decays in the bakamjian - thomas relativistic quark model * + 1 truecm * h .- r . </S>",
