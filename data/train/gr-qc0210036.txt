    "we describe the differential and contact structures of the manifold of light rays @xmath0 of a general globally hyperbolic @xmath1-dimensional spacetime @xmath2 .",

    "the section ends with a review of the notions of linking and legendrian linking .    in section [ section3 ]",
    "we turn to the @xmath7 case .",
    "we show how to compute the linking number of two skies from the corresponding wavefronts and analyze a few simple examples in order to motivate low s conjecture , which we then state .",
    "much of the material in the first two sections was first discussed by low ( see @xcite , @xcite @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , and can be found in greater detail in @xcite .    in section [ section4 ]",
    "we use the fact that skies @xmath16 are legendrian submanifolds to determine the possible configurations of wavefronts @xmath18 .",
    "this provides a heuristic explanation of why low s conjecture should be true , which we make rigorous in section [ section5 ] for a large class of examples by computing certain coefficients of their kauffman polynomials .",
    "finally we consider the @xmath10 case in section [ section6 ] .",
    "we give an example of skies of causally related points which are unlinked , and conjecture that smooth linking should be replaced with legendrian linking in the correct version of low s conjecture for this dimension .",
    "let @xmath2 be a @xmath1-dimensional globally hyperbolic spacetime with a fixed time orientation , and consider the set @xmath0 of all its null geodesics ( we define a null vector to be a _",
    "vector @xmath20 such that @xmath21 , and hence the constant geodesic is _ not _ a null geodesic ) .",
    "if @xmath12 is a cauchy surface , then every null geodesic intersects @xmath22 exactly once . on the other hand , at any event @xmath23 two future - pointing null vectors are initial conditions for the same null geodesic _",
    "iff _ they are linearly dependent , or , equivalently , _",
    "iff _ their orthogonal projections on @xmath24 are linearly dependent and point in the same direction .",
    "consequently , @xmath0 can be identified with the tangent sphere bundle @xmath25 ( recall that @xmath22 endowed with the metric induced by @xmath13 is a riemannian manifold of dimension @xmath26 ) .",
    "we use this fact to define a differentiable structure on @xmath0 , and notice that , due to smooth dependence of the solutions of the geodesic equation on its initial data , this structure is independent of the choice of cauchy surface .",
    "thus the set of all null geodesics of a globally hyperbolic @xmath1-dimensional spacetime is a differentiable manifold of dimension @xmath27 , which we call its _ manifold of light rays_.",
    "it is possible to show that @xmath0 has a natural contact structure . in order to do so",
    ", we introduce the so - called _ manifold of scaled light rays _ @xmath28 .",
    "this manifold is defined analogously to the manifold of light rays , except that we distinguish between null geodesics with different affine parameterizations ; more precisely , if @xmath29 are two affinely parametrized null geodesics such that @xmath30 are future pointing , we take @xmath31 _ iff _ @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "therefore @xmath28 can be identified with the tangent bundle to a cauchy surface minus the zero section . in particular , @xmath34 . a smooth path in @xmath28",
    "can always be represented by a smooth function @xmath35 such that @xmath36 is , for each value of @xmath37 , an affinely parametrized null geodesic .",

    "thus @xmath36 yields a jacobi field along the geodesic @xmath42 satisfying @xmath43 .",
    "such fields form a vector space @xmath44 of dimension @xmath45 ; thus the natural linear surjective map @xmath46 has kernel of dimension @xmath47 , which is easily seen to be the set @xmath48 of vector fields of the form @xmath49 for @xmath50 ( as these correspond to going to the same affinely parametrized geodesics ) . in other words , @xmath51 if @xmath52 , then @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( the last equality , known as _ lagrange s identity _ , following from the symmetries of the riemann tensor ) .",
    "thus we can use the above expressions to define a 1-covector @xmath55 and a 2-covector @xmath56 on @xmath44 .",
    "if @xmath57 , then @xmath49 and @xmath58 and @xmath59 consequently there exist a 1-covector @xmath60 and a 2-covector @xmath61 on @xmath62 such that @xmath63 , @xmath64 . using local coordinates , it is not hard to show that @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is minus the natural map determined by the riemannian metric @xmath67 induced on @xmath22 by the spacetime metric @xmath13 , and @xmath68 are the canonical symplectic forms on @xmath69 ( the minus sign arises from our spacetime signature convention , which is @xmath70 ) . in other words ,",
    "the manifold of scaled light rays is naturally a symplectic manifold ; the symplectic structure is just the natural symplectic structure of @xmath69 , provided that we identify @xmath71 with @xmath72 using the map @xmath73 ( @xmath74 and @xmath75 being the zero sections of @xmath76 and @xmath69 ) . notice that although we are giving the symplectic forms in terms of a particular cauchy surface @xmath22 , the symplectic structure of @xmath28 is ( by construction ) clearly independent of the choice of @xmath22 .    to obtain the manifold of light rays @xmath0 from the manifold of scaled light rays",
    "@xmath28 we have to identify geodesics which differ by an affine reparameterization .",
    "this corresponds to quotienting @xmath77 by the natural action of @xmath78 along the fibers .",
    "hence @xmath0 has a natural contact structure ; we can think of @xmath0 as the cotangent sphere bundle @xmath79 ( taken with respect to an arbitrary riemannian metric on @xmath22 , for instance @xmath67 ) , in which case a contact 1-form is simply the restriction of @xmath80 to @xmath0 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the _ sky _ of an event @xmath4 is the subset @xmath81    if @xmath23 then @xmath82 is a fiber of the cotangent sphere bundle @xmath83 , and therefore is an embedded submanifold of @xmath0 diffeomorphic to @xmath6 . since we are free to regard @xmath0 as a fiber bundle over _ any _ cauchy surface , and every event in @xmath11 belongs to _ some _ cauchy surface , we see that any sky is an embedded @xmath6 .",
    "furthermore , since the contact form @xmath80 vanishes on the fibers @xmath83 , we see that the sky of any point is a legendrian submanifold of @xmath0 ( i.e. , a maximal dimension submanifold of @xmath0 where the contact form vanishes ) .",
    "notice that in particular this means that the null cone of any event @xmath84 is orthogonal to the tangent vectors of the generating null geodesics ( i.e. , the null cone is a null hypersurface ) .",
    "the _ wavefront _ generated by the event @xmath4 at @xmath22 is simply the intersection of its null cone with @xmath22 ( or , equivalently , @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the natural projection ) . given a wavefront ,",
    "there exist at each point of the wavefront two future - pointing null directions orthogonal to the wavefront , whose orthogonal projections on @xmath76 are negative multiples of each other . thus we can reconstruct @xmath82 from the wavefront @xmath85 provided that we are given the _ coorientation _ of the wavefront , i.e. , a choice between the two possible null directions at each point .",
    "this extra bit of information can be given , for instance , as a unit normal vector field @xmath87 on @xmath85 ( with respect to the riemannian metric @xmath67 , say ) .",
    "notice that @xmath87 is necessarily continuous , and hence it suffices to indicate it at any single point of @xmath85 .",

    "this induces a smooth motion of @xmath95 into @xmath96 , which are therefore equivalent .",
    "we conclude that the link formed by the skies of any two non - causally related events belong to the same equivalence class , which we define as the _ unlink _ in @xmath0 ( notice that although there exists a natural choice for the unlink in @xmath115 or @xmath116 , this is not the case in general for an arbitrary smooth @xmath3-dimensional manifold ) .",
    "@xmath9 are said to be _ linked _ if the equivalence class of @xmath91 is not the unlink .",
    "legendrian link _ is a smooth link @xmath91 such that @xmath9 are legendrian .",
    "recall that a diffeomorphism @xmath117 is said to be a _ contactomorphism _ if it preserves the contact structure , i.e. , if @xmath118 .",
    "in particular , a contactomorphism maps legendrian submanifolds to legendrian submanifolds . a _",

    "@xmath119 is a smooth embedding",
    "whose image is legendrian .",
    "all that was said above about smooth links remains true if we replace `` smooth '' with `` legendrian '' .",
    "thus if @xmath8 are not in the same null geodesic then @xmath91 is a legendrian link , and if @xmath107 and @xmath108 are two pairs of non - causally related events , then @xmath95 and @xmath96 are legendrian equivalent ( and we define the corresponding equivalence class as the _ legendrian _ unlink ) .",
    "notice that if @xmath95 and @xmath96 are legendrian equivalent , they must be ( smooth ) equivalent , but the reverse is not true in general .",
    "we shall present an example of this later on .",
    "let us consider now the case where @xmath7 and @xmath22 is diffeomorphic to a ( connected , open ) subset of @xmath120 . in this case , @xmath0 is diffeomorphic to a subset of the tangent sphere bundle of @xmath120 , which in turn is diffeomorphic to the interior of a solid torus in @xmath121 .",
    "it will prove useful to fix a particular embedding @xmath122 ( which we shall call the _ standard embedding _ ) .",
    "thus , if @xmath123 are the usual polar coordinates in @xmath120 , and @xmath124 is the coordinate in the fibers of @xmath125 corresponding to the angle with the positive @xmath126-direction , we define @xmath127    this particular embedding has the advantage of carrying the unlink in @xmath0 ( as defined above ) to the unlink in @xmath121 .",
    "notice that the skies of events on @xmath22 are mapped to circles of constant @xmath123 , which for convenience we call _",
    "meridians_. from now on we shall identify @xmath0 with @xmath128 . clearly",
    "a smooth motion of a smooth link in @xmath0 yields a smooth motion of this link in @xmath121 , and consequently if two links are equivalent in @xmath0 they must be equivalent in @xmath121",
    ".    recall that in @xmath121 there is a well - known link invariant , namely the _ linking number_. given a link @xmath91 , this is simply the integer given by the _",
    "gauss integral _ ,    @xmath129    ( where @xmath130 are embeddings for @xmath131 ) , or , equivalently , the integer such that @xmath132 $ ] is @xmath133 times an appropriate generator of @xmath134 , depending on the orientation of @xmath135 ( see @xcite ) . in particular",
    "if @xmath91 is the unlink then @xmath136 .",
    "notice also that , as is easily seen from the gauss integral formula , @xmath137 .    as was noted by low ( @xcite ) ,",
    "@xmath133 is simply the winding number of the wavefront generated by @xmath138 at a cauchy surface through @xmath139 around @xmath139 .",
    "indeed , let @xmath8 be two events not in the same null geodesic . recall that we can always assume that @xmath140 , i.e. , that @xmath135 is a meridian . in general , however , @xmath141 .",
    "we can think of the natural projection @xmath142 as quotienting @xmath0 by its meridians , and consequently identify @xmath22 with the quotient space .",
    "thus any smooth surface on @xmath0 intersecting each meridian exactly once can be identified with @xmath22 . in this manner we can think of @xmath139 and @xmath85 as a point and an oriented curve on @xmath143 ( since @xmath82 is an oriented curve , @xmath85 can be given the induced orientation ) .",
    "one can always choose @xmath143 such that @xmath144 is finite .",
    "it is then possible to construct an isotopy of @xmath0 deforming @xmath82 into a curve which approaches ( with any required accuracy ) the wavefront @xmath85 plus a finite number of meridians , one hanging from each intersection of @xmath82 and @xmath22 . indeed , if @xmath124 is the angular coordinate along the meridians such that @xmath145 , one has but to consider isotopies of the form @xmath146 , where @xmath147 \\times [ 0,2 \\pi ] \\to [ 0 , 2 \\pi]$ ] is a nonnegative smooth function vanishing for @xmath148 and @xmath149 and approaching @xmath150 from below as @xmath151 .",
    "since the linking number of any two disjoint meridians is zero , we see that @xmath152 , where @xmath153 is the winding number of the curve @xmath18 around the point @xmath140 ( recall that @xmath22 is diffeomorphic to a subset of @xmath120 ) .",
    "( this result plus the fact that @xmath137 allows us to make the following nontrivial observation : if @xmath154 are not in the same null geodesic and @xmath155 are arbitrary cauchy surfaces through @xmath154 then the winding number of the wavefront generated by @xmath138 at @xmath156 around @xmath139 is equal to the winding number of the wavefront generated by @xmath139 at @xmath157 around @xmath138 ) .",
    "as an example , consider minkowski s @xmath158-dimensional spacetime , i.e. , @xmath121 endowed with the line element @xmath159 , and take hypersurfaces of constant @xmath160 as cauchy surfaces .",
    "then all wavefronts are circles , and all linking numbers are therefore either zero or one . since an event on the cauchy surface",
    "is causally related to the event generating the wavefront _ iff _ it is either inside the wavefront ( in which case the winding number is @xmath47 ) or on it , we see that two events in minkowski @xmath158-dimensional spacetime are causally related _ iff _ their skies either intersect or are linked with linking number @xmath47 .    another example is provided by schwarzschild s @xmath158-dimensional static spacetime , i.e. , the region of @xmath121 given in cylindrical coordinates @xmath161 by @xmath162 endowed with the line element @xmath163 ( we ve taken the schwarzschild radius as our length unit ) . if we again take hypersurfaces of constant @xmath160 as cauchy surfaces , it is possible to show that the wavefronts are as shown in figure [ picture ] , wrapping around the event horizon any number of times .",
    "it is then easily seen that all winding numbers are either zero or positive , and that an event in the cauchy surface not on the wavefront is causally related to the event generating the wavefront _ iff _ the winding number is positive .",
    "consequently , two events in schwarzschild @xmath158-dimensional static spacetime are causally related _ iff _ their skies either intersect or are linked with positive linking number ( but links do occur with any positive linking number ) .",
    "it is not true in general that all links formed by the skies of causally related events have nonvanishing linking number .",
    "a simple counter - example is provided by @xmath121 endowed with the line element @xmath164 , where @xmath165 is an appropriate smooth function ( equal to @xmath47 except on the circles @xmath166 or @xmath167 , where it increases radially towards the center ) .",
    "the wavefront of the event @xmath168 on the cauchy surface @xmath169 is as depicted in figure [ picture ] , each pair of cusps corresponding to scattering by one of the circles where the metric is not flat .",
    "the appearance of the second pair of cusps allows the existence of events @xmath139 that , although clearly causally related to @xmath138 , are such that the winding number of @xmath85 around @xmath139 is zero , and consequently @xmath136 .",
    "however @xmath91 is _ not _ the unlink . to see that",
    ", we notice that the riemannian metric induced on @xmath22 is conformally related to the euclidean metric , and that we can therefore use the usual angle with the @xmath138-axis as a coordinate on @xmath25 .",
    "to decide on the value of this coordinate along the wavefront , we recall that the tangent vector @xmath170 to any null geodesic is orthogonal to the light cone of @xmath138 .",
    "consequently , the element of @xmath25 corresponding to the null geodesic is the normal vector ( on @xmath22 ) to the wavefront , oriented so that it points outwards when the wavefront is in the boundary of the causal future . using these rules",
    "one constructs the link shown in figure [ picture ] , which is the so - called _",
    "whitehead link _ ( and famously _ not _ the unlink ) .",
    "the above examples have led low to formulate the following    [ lowsconj ] let @xmath2 be an orientable time oriented globally hyperbolic @xmath158-dimensional spacetime with a cauchy surface @xmath12 diffeomorphic to a subset of @xmath120 ; then @xmath8 are causally related _ iff _ @xmath9 either intersect or are linked .    some partial results have been achieved ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , but the general case of this conjecture remains unproven .",
    "as we saw in section [ section2 ] , giving a sky @xmath171 is equivalent to giving its cooriented wavefront @xmath18 . a natural question to ask is therefore",
    "what kinds of wavefronts can arise from projecting skies .",
    "more precisely , we make the following    a curve @xmath172 is said to be a _ sky _ if there exists an orientable time oriented globally hyperbolic @xmath158-dimensional spacetime @xmath2 with cauchy surface @xmath12 diffeomorphic to a connected open subset @xmath173 containing @xmath174 such that @xmath174 is ( the image under the diffeomorphism of ) the wavefront @xmath85 generated at @xmath22 by some event @xmath4 .",
    "( notice that we are using the same designation for skies and their projections on @xmath120 )",
    ". the question above would then be more precisely phrased by asking which curves @xmath172 are skies .",
    "notice that the projection @xmath86 depends on the choice of @xmath22 .",
    "alternatively , one can think that @xmath175 is fixed and that changing @xmath22 corresponds to applying a diffeomorphism to @xmath0 .",
    "we will be interested only in _",
    "generic _ skies , i.e. , those which are stable under small perturbations of @xmath22 .    a _ generic wavefront _ is ( the image of ) a piecewise immersion of @xmath176 in @xmath120 whose singularities are a finite even number of cusps , such that all points have multiplicity @xmath47 except for a finite number of points whith multiplicity @xmath177 , where the self - intersection is transverse .",
    "notice that if @xmath172 is a generic wavefront then it is always possible to define a coorientation on @xmath174 , i.e. , a continuous unit normal vector field @xmath178 : this is true locally , since the only singularities are cusps ; the fact that there exist an even number of cusps guarantees that this is also true globally .",
    "equivalently , generic wavefronts can be lifted to legendrian submanifolds of @xmath0 diffeomorphic to @xmath176 .",
    "however , not all such manifolds project down to generic wavefronts , a meridian being a prime example ; we shall call the projection of a legendrian @xmath176 simply a _ wavefront_. from this point on we shall often not distinguish between a cooriented wavefront and the corresponding legendrian @xmath176 .",
    "generic skies are generic wavefronts .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that skies are projections of legendrian submanifolds ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "a further restriction to the class of curves which are allowed to be skies is topological in nature : it has to do with the fact that if @xmath16 is the sky of @xmath4 then moving @xmath22 in @xmath11 ( for instance using the flow of @xmath179 ) to a cauchy surface through @xmath138 can be thought of as applying a legendrian isotopy to @xmath0 which moves @xmath82 to a meridian .",
    "this shows that @xmath82 is in the same homology class of any meridian in @xmath0 . in terms of the wavefront @xmath85",
    ", this means that its coorientation must rotate by @xmath180 as one traverses it in the positive direction .",
    "the _ winding number _ of an oriented generic wavefront @xmath174 is the integer @xmath181 such that the coorientation rotates by @xmath182 as @xmath174 is traversed in the positive direction .",
    "thus skies must have winding number @xmath183 .",
    "the argument above actually shows that there exists a legendrian isotopy carrying each sky to a meridian .",
    "this means that if a wavefront @xmath184 is a sky then all its legendrian invariants must be the same as the legendrian invariants of a meridian .",
    "examples of such invariants are the _ maslov index _ @xmath185 and the _ arnold _ @xmath186 _ invariant _ ( see @xcite ) , whose values for a meridian are both @xmath187 . in figure [ picture2 ]",
    "we show 3 examples of wavefronts which fail to have the correct values of the invariants @xmath188 .",
    "it is a consequence of a theorem by eliashberg ( see @xcite ) that in @xmath189 with the usual contact structure all unknotted legendrian submanifolds diffeomorphic to @xmath176 having the same values of @xmath190 are legendre isotopic ; the same however is not true in our case , a counter - example being presented in the fourth wavefront in figure [ picture2 ] .",
    "this curve has the correct values of the invariants @xmath188 , but we compute its legendrian homfly polynomial ( see @xcite ) to be @xmath191 , as opposed to @xmath192 for a meridian .",
    "it is not sufficient that @xmath172 is legendre isotopic to a sky for it to be a sky .",
    "in fact , if @xmath193 then @xmath174 must bound the plane region given by all points in @xmath22 which are causally related to @xmath84 . in particular ,",
    "in all points of the curve which can be reached by a continuous curve coming from infinity ( which we shall call the _ outer boundary _ ) the coorientation must point in the same direction with respect to the curve .",
    "thus for instance the plane curve in figure [ picture3 ] can not be a sky .",
    "however this curve is legendre isotopic to a circle ( which is a sky ) : it is easy to see that any deformation of a wavefront such that the coorientation of different branches at self - intersection points never coincides ( or equivalently , such that the coorientations of different branches have opposite directions at any self - tangencys ; see @xcite . ] ) induces a legendrian motion of the corresponding legendrian @xmath176 .        the problem of deciding whether a given curve is a sky is therefore nontrivial . instead of dwelling on this problem ,",
    "let us assume that we are given a ( generic ) sky @xmath193 , i.e. , the wavefront generated at @xmath22 by @xmath4 .",
    "consider a timelike curve @xmath194 such that @xmath195 , @xmath196 , and let @xmath197 be the wavefront generated by @xmath194 at @xmath22 .",
    "then @xmath198 is a point and @xmath199 constitutes a legendrian deformation of a point into @xmath200 .",
    "the fact that it is a legendrian deformation implies that the only changes allowed to @xmath199 aside from moving ( eventually crossing itself ) are the creation or the destruction of a pair of cusps ( see @xcite and figure [ picture4 ] ) .",
    "the pair of cusps is called a _ left twist _ or a _ right twist _ according to its position with respect to the coorientation , as shown in figure [ picture4 ] .",
    "the reason for these names is shown in the figure : these segments of wavefront are the projections of left or right twists of the corresponding legendrian knots .",
    "as @xmath199 evolves from @xmath198 to @xmath174 only left twists can be created and only right twists can be destroyed .",
    "huygens s principle implies that right twists can not be created on the portions of @xmath199 which are part of the boundary of the causal set of @xmath194 . because the creation of a right twist is a local issue",
    ", we can always assume that the segment of wavefront where it is created is actually part of such a boundary .",
    "thus the evolution can not create right twists .",
    "the destruction of a left twist can be seen as the time - reversed creation of a right twist ; if it were allowed , it would be possible to construct an evolution creating a right twist .",
    "thus it can not occur .",
    "the outer boundary of a generic sky carries a finite number of double points .",
    "each double point is the projection of two points in the sky , which split the sky into two subsets , one of them projecting onto the outer boundary .",
    "we shall call the subset of a sky arising from a double point in the outer boundary in this way and not projecting onto the outer boundary a _",
    "pendant_.        a generic sky can therefore be thought of as a circle ( the outer boundary ) with a finite number of pendants attached .",
    "the two basic mechanisms for forming pendants are overlaps ( as for instance in schwarzschild s ( 2 + 1)-dimensional spacetime ) and growing cusps . whenever a cusp forms , both sides of it are causally related to @xmath194 ; whenever an overlap forms a region not in the causal future may appear inside the outer boundary ( as is the case in schwarzschild s ( 2 + 1)-dimensional spacetime ) .",
    "obviously one can use the same reasoning to divide a pendant into subpendants ; in that respect a pendant is like a tree .",
    "see figure [ picture5 ] for an example .",
    "in this section we use the kauffman polynomial to prove conjecture [ lowsconj ] for a certain class of skies of causally related points , of which infinitely many yield links with zero linking number .",
    "let @xmath8 be two events not on the same null geodesic which are causally related .",
    "assume that @xmath140 .",
    "heuristically , @xmath82 and @xmath135 must be linked because as @xmath201 evolves from @xmath202 to @xmath203 it must hit @xmath139 at least once , and thus @xmath139 is inside the outer boundary of @xmath174 .",
    "if it is not in a pendant , then @xmath204 ; if it is in a pendant where no left twisting has occurred , then @xmath205 ; if it is in a pendant where left twisting has occurred , and hence possibly @xmath136 , @xmath91 can not be deformed to the unlink because there is no right twisting anywhere in @xmath82 to `` cancel off '' the left twisting .",
    "unfortunately , it is not easy to turn this insight into a proof of low s conjecture .",
    "however it can be used to prove low s conjecture for a large class of examples .",
    "let @xmath206 .",
    "let @xmath207 .",
    "then @xmath208 is said to be a _ pair of skies of type _",
    "@xmath209 if @xmath91 admits a link diagram as shown if figure [ picture6 ] ( when embedded in @xmath121 through the standard diffeomorphism ; each integer refers to the number of double points ) .",
    "it is easy to see how such skies may form , each double point of @xmath82 corresponding to two cusps in @xmath174 .",
    "thus for instance the pair of skies with linking number 0 we considered in section [ section3 ] is a pair of skies of type @xmath210 .",
    "we now prove that such skies are always linked . in order to do this",
    "we must recall the following    the _ bracket polynomial _",
    "@xmath211 of a link diagram @xmath212 is the polynomial in the variables @xmath213 defined by the rules shown in figure [ picture7 ] ( see @xcite ) .",
    "notice that the bracket polynomial does not depend on the orientations of the link , a fact that we will use to our advantage .",
    "the bracket polynomial is _ not _ a link invariant , but can be used to build a link invariant . in order to do",
    "so we must introduce the following    a crossing in a link diagram is said to be _ positive _ or _ negative _ according to whether the branch going rightward goes over or under the branch going leftward ( right and left being defined with respect to the orientations of the branches ; see figure [ picture8 ] ) .",
    "the _ writhe number _ @xmath214 of a link diagram @xmath215 is the sum of the signs of all crossings ( where the sign of a crossing is @xmath216 according to whether it is positive or negative ) .",
    "the _ kauffman polynomial _ of a link @xmath217 is @xmath218 where @xmath215 is any link diagram for @xmath217 .",
    "the kauffman polynomial is a link invariant .",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the kauffman polynomial is related to the jones polynomial in one variable through the variable change @xmath219 .    to prove that skies of the type we are considering are always linked we compute certain invariants obtained from the kauffman polynomial . in order to do",
    "so we shall need the following    [ formula ] let @xmath220 , @xmath221 , @xmath222 be as in figure [ picture9 ] ( @xmath223 being the number of double points in the twisted knot ) .",
    "then @xmath224        we prove this result by induction . for @xmath225 all there is to prove is @xmath226    this is a simple application of the rules defining the bracket polynomial and is done in figure [ picture10 ] .     for @xmath225 . ]    as for the inductive step , our formula yields    @xmath227 \\\\ & & -a^{-1}\\left ( a^4+a^{-4}\\right ) ( -a)^{-3(n-1)}\\left\\langle \\lambda_0\\right\\rangle \\\\ & = & a\\left\\langle \\lambda _ { n-1}\\right\\rangle -a^{-1}\\left ( a^4+a^{-4}\\right)(-a)^{-3(n-1)}\\left\\langle \\lambda _ 0\\right\\rangle\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and hence all that must be proved is    @xmath228    this can be done much as the @xmath225 case ; we do so in figure [ picture11 ] .",
    "the last step in the proof is justified in lemma [ writhe ] .    ]    [ writhe ] let @xmath229 be the link diagram shown in figure [ picture12 ] ( @xmath230 being the number of double points )",
    ". then @xmath231 .",
    "choose any orientation on @xmath229 ( and hence on @xmath232 ) . clearly @xmath233 .",
    "since @xmath229 and @xmath232 are link diagrams for the same link , they must have the same kauffman polynomial , and hence @xmath234    . ]",
    "notice that it is in this lemma that the left twisting comes into the proof .",
    "we will be only interested in the terms of higher and lower order of bracket polynomials .",
    "it is therefore useful to keep in mind the slightly simpler ( if less accurate ) formula given in theorem [ formula ] :    @xmath235    let @xmath236 .",
    "we shall denote by @xmath209 the standard link diagram for the link of such type ( depicted in figure [ picture6 ] ) .",
    "also , we shall also allow @xmath237 to assume the values 0,-1 with the meaning described in figure [ picture9 ] .",
    "let @xmath206 .",
    "then @xmath238 where @xmath239 is the total number of double points and @xmath240 is the total number of subpendants of the knot diagram of @xmath82 .",
    "it should be clear that @xmath241 is a link diagram for the hopf link and @xmath242 is a link diagram for the unlink , and hence @xmath243    consequently formula [ fundamental ] yields @xmath244    and the theorem s conclusion holds in this case .",
    "next , we notice that @xmath245 and that lemma [ writhe ] yields @xmath246    consequently , one can ignore the corresponding term in formula [ fundamental ] , @xmath247 and again the theorem s conclusion holds . in general , one has @xmath248 and consequently @xmath249    from lemma [ writhe ] , on the other hand , one gets @xmath250 and again one can ignore the corresponding term in formula [ fundamental ] , thus getting @xmath251    this proves the theorem for @xmath252 .",
    "for @xmath253 the proof easily follows ( by using the exact same reasoning ) from the observation that @xmath254 and that consequently one can go on ignoring the first term in formula [ fundamental ] .",
    "let @xmath206 , and @xmath208 be of type @xmath255 then @xmath256 where @xmath257    we just have to compute the writhe number of the standard link diagram for the link @xmath91 ( depicted in figure [ picture6 ] ) .",
    "there are two kinds of crossings in this link diagram : those involving only the knot diagram of @xmath82 ( @xmath0 of them , all corresponding to negative crossings ) and those involving the two knot diagrams .",
    "it is a well known fact that the sum of the signs of the latter crossings is equal to twice the linking number of @xmath82 and @xmath135 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , the writhe number is @xmath258 and hence @xmath259    let @xmath206 , and @xmath208 be of type @xmath255 then @xmath82 and @xmath135 are linked .    if @xmath260 then obviously @xmath82 and @xmath135 are linked . if @xmath261 then @xmath262 and consequently @xmath263 is not the unlink .",
    "since both @xmath133 and the exponents of the terms of higher and lower order of @xmath264 are clearly invariants of @xmath263 , one can in fact conclude that    let @xmath206 , and @xmath208 be of type @xmath255 then @xmath239 and @xmath240 are invariants of @xmath263 .",
    "thus not only are all skies of the type we have considered linked , but also pairs of skies with different values of @xmath0 and @xmath265 form non - equivalent links",
    ". see figure [ picture13 ] for some examples with zero linking number .",
    "this method can be successfully employed in some generalizations of the skies we have considered .",
    "for instance , it can handle multiple subpendants and a pendant overlapping itself .",
    "unfortunately , it is hard to see how it can handle _ generic _ skies .",
    "as we said , the bracket polynomial ( and hence the kauffman polynomial when calculated through it ) is especially amenable to the kind of computations we have to do , because it is local and orientation - independent . using the usual definitions of the kauffman ( or other ) polynomial in terms of skein relations",
    "turns out to be less fruitful , as one must continuously worry about related knots and orientations .",
    "see @xcite for such computations using the conway polynomial .",
    "as was noted by low ( @xcite ) , in @xmath266-dimensional spacetimes it is possible to obtain causally related events whose skies are unlinked .",
    "a simple example is obtained by considering @xmath267 endowed with the line element @xmath268 where @xmath269 is a smooth function equal to @xmath47 except on the ball @xmath270 , where it increases radially towards the center .",
    "the wavefront of the event @xmath271 on the cauchy surface @xmath169 is the revolution surface generated by the curve depicted in figure [ picture14 ] .",
    "take an event @xmath139 in the cauchy surface as shown in the figure .",
    "[ unlink ] @xmath91 is the unlink .    move the cauchy surface towards the past ; the projections @xmath272 eventually change into the surfaces of revolution generated by the curves depicted in the lower diagram in figure [ picture14 ] ) . recall that the intersection of , say , @xmath82 , with a @xmath273 fiber is determined by the normal vector to @xmath274 at that point . because the cauchy surface we are considering is to the future of @xmath138 but to the past of @xmath139 , the relevant normal",
    "is the outward - pointing normal for @xmath85 and the inward - pointing normal for @xmath275 .",
    "let @xmath276 be cylindrical coordinates in @xmath277 , and consider the deformation of @xmath82 given by @xmath278 for @xmath279 and @xmath87 the normal vector to @xmath274 at @xmath280 .",
    "it should be clear that one can move @xmath82 away from @xmath135 ( by moving @xmath281 away from @xmath282 along the @xmath283-axis , say ) without @xmath82 ever intersecting @xmath135 , and that once one has moved @xmath82 far enough both can be deformed to skies of points on the cauchy surface ( which by definition are unlinked ) .",
    "notice that in the proof of proposition [ unlink ] @xmath284 is not a legendrian knot for all @xmath285 , and hence we can not conclude that @xmath91 is the legendrian unlink .",
    "legendrian linking provides us with a more restrictive concept of linking which fits nicely with the natural contact structure of the manifold of light rays .",
    "an illustration of this restrictiveness is given by the following theorem by lisa traynor :    [ lisa ] let @xmath2 be minkowski ( 2 + 1)-spacetime and @xmath0 the corresponding ( contact ) manifold of light rays .",
    "let @xmath207 be causally related points not in the same null geodesic .",
    "then @xmath263 and @xmath286 are _ not _ equivalent legendrian links .",
    "see @xcite .",
    "let @xmath2 be minkowski ( 2 + 1)-spacetime and @xmath0 the corresponding ( contact ) manifold of light rays .",
    "let @xmath287 with @xmath138 causally related to @xmath139 and not in the same null geodesic , and not causally related to @xmath283 .",
    "then @xmath263 , @xmath286 and @xmath288 yield the different equivalence classes of legendrian links formed by pairs of skies .",
    "this is an immediate consequence of theorem [ lisa ] and the fact that any two points on @xmath11 not lying on the same null geodesic can be moved into @xmath138 and @xmath139 , @xmath139 and @xmath138 or @xmath138 and @xmath283 in such a way that they never are on the same null geodesic .",
    "note that if @xmath154 are causally related and not on the same null geodesic and ( say ) @xmath289 then @xmath263 and @xmath286 are clearly equivalent smooth links : one can always find coordinates on @xmath11 such that on @xmath290 we have @xmath291 for some @xmath292 ; thus we see that @xmath293 is a smooth isotopy which carries @xmath263 to @xmath286 .",
    "thus there are only two distinct equivalence classes of links formed by pairs of skies in minkowski ( 2 + 1)-spacetime .",
    "this is related to the fact that in the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional case @xmath137 .",
    "it is instructive to see how the above isotopy fails to be a contact isotopy : it is generated by the vector field @xmath294 which does not preserve the contact structure : @xmath295 \\\\ & = \\left ( -\\pi x^2\\sin \\theta -\\pi x^1\\cos \\theta \\right ) d\\theta + d\\left(-\\pi x^2\\cos \\theta + \\pi x^1\\sin \\theta \\right ) \\\\ & = \\pi \\sin \\theta dx^1-\\pi \\cos \\theta dx^2 \\\\ & \\neq \\lambda \\left ( \\cos \\theta dx^1+\\sin \\theta dx^2\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    thus legendrian linking allows us to distinguish between past and future in minkowski ( 2 + 1)-spacetime , whereas smooth linking does not .",
    "this hints that it could be the concept of linking we are looking for to express causal relations in the manifold of light rays for @xmath10 .",
    "let @xmath2 be a globally hyperbolic ( 3 + 1)-spacetime with cauchy surface diffeomorphic to a subset of @xmath277 , and let @xmath0 be its manifold of light rays .",
    "then two spacetime points are causally related in @xmath11 _ iff _ their skies either intersect or are legendrian linked in @xmath0 .",
    "this is a natural extension of low s conjecture for ( 2 + 1)-dimensional spacetimes , and appears to be true for at least some cases .",
    "however , a proof appears to require new methods of contact topology .",
    "we would like to thank prof .",
