    "ebola virus disease ( evd ) is caused by a genus of the family _ filoviridae _ called _ ebolavirus_. the first recorded outbreak took place in sudan in 1976 with the longest most severe outbreak taking place in west africa during 2014 - 2015 @xcite .",
    "studies have estimated disease growth rates and explored the impact of interventions aimed at reducing the final epidemic size @xcite . despite these efforts , research that improves and increases our understanding of evd and the environments where it thrives is still needed @xcite . +",
    "this chapter is organized as follows : section 2 reviews past modeling work ; section three introduces a single patch model , its associated basic reproduction number @xmath0 , and the final size relationship ; section four introduces a two - patch model that accounts for the time spent by residents of patch @xmath1 on patch @xmath2 ; section 5 includes selected simulations that highlight the possible implications of policies that forcefully restrict movement ( _ cordons sanitaires_);and , section 6 collects our thoughts on the relationship between movement , health disparities , and risk .",

    "@xcite estimated the basic reproduction numbers for the 1995 outbreak in the democratic republic of congo and the 2000 outbreak in uganda .",
    "model analysis showed that control measures ( education , contact tracing , quarantine ) if implemented within a reasonable window in time could be effective .",

    "@xcite built on the work in @xcite through the addition of hospitalized and dead ( in funeral homes ) classes within a study that focused on the relative importance of control measures and the timing of their implementation .",
    "lekone and finkenstdt @xcite made use of an stochastic framework in estimating the mean incubation period , mean infectious period , transmission rate and the basic reproduction number , using data from the 1995 outbreak .",
    "their results turned out to be in close agreement with those in @xcite but the estimates had larger confidence intervals .",
    "the 2014 outbreak is the deadliest in the history of the virus and naturally , questions remain @xcite .",
    "chowell et _ al_. in @xcite recently introduced a mathematical model aimed at addressing the impact of early detection ( via sophisticated technologies ) of pre - symptomatic individuals on the transmission dynamics of the ebola virus in west africa .",
    "patterson - lomba et _ al_. in @xcite explored the potential negative effects that restrictive intervention measures may have had in guinea , sierra leone , and liberia .",
    "their analysis made use of the available data on ebola virus disease cases up to september 8 , 2014 .",
    "the focus on @xcite was on the dynamics of the``effective reproduction number '' @xmath3 , a measure of the changing rate of epidemic growth , as the population of susceptible individuals gets depleted .",
    "@xmath3 appeared to be increasing for liberia and guinea , in the initial stages of the outbreak in densely populated cities , that is , during the period of time when strict quarantine measures were imposed in several areas in west africa .",
    "their report concluded , in part , that the imposition of enforced quarantine measures in densely populated communities in west africa , may have accelerated the spread of the disease . in @xcite",
    ", the authors showed that the estimated growth rates of evd cases were growing exponentially at the national level .",
    "they also observed that the growth rates exhibited polynomial growth at the district level over three or more generations of the disease .",
    "it has been suggested that behavioral changes or the successful implementation of control measures , or high levels of clustering , or all of them may nave been responsible for polynomial growth .",
    "a recent review of mathematical models of past and current evd outbreaks can be found in @xcite and references therein .",
    "inspired by these results , we proceed to analyze the effectiveness of forcefully local restrictions in movement on the dynamics of evd .",

    "ebola - stricken countries enforced public health officials decided to use this medieval control strategy , in the evd hot - zone , that is , the region of confluence of guinea , liberia and sierra leone @xcite . in this chapter , a framework that allows , in the simplest possible setting , the possibility of assessing the potential impact of the use of a _ cordon sanitaire _ during an evd outbreak , is introduced and `` tested '' .",
    "the population of interest is subdivided into susceptible ( @xmath4 ) , latent ( @xmath5 ) , infectious ( @xmath6 ) , dead ( @xmath7 ) and recovered ( @xmath8 ) . the total population ( including the dead ) is therefore @xmath9 .",
    "the susceptible population is reduced by the process of infection , which occurs via effective `` contacts '' between an infectious ( @xmath6 ) or a dead body ( @xmath7 ) at the rate of @xmath10 and susceptible .",
    "evd - induced dead bodies have the highest viral load , that is , more infectious than individuals in the infectious stage ( @xmath6 ) ; and , so , it is assumed that @xmath11 .",
    "the latent population increases at the rate @xmath12 . however",
    "since some latent individuals may recover without developing an infection @xcite , it is assumed that exposed individuals develop symptoms at the rate @xmath13 or recover at the rate @xmath14 .",
    "the population of infectious individuals increases at the rate @xmath15 and decreases at the rate @xmath16 .",
    "further , individuals leaving the infectious stage at rate @xmath17 , die at the rate @xmath18 or recover at the rate @xmath19 .",
    "the @xmath8 class includes recovered or the removed individuals from the system ( dead and buried ) . by definition the @xmath8-class increases , the arrival of previously infected , grows at the rate @xmath20 .",

    "the patch - specific basic reproduction number is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 are the _ local _ basic reproduction number when the patches are isolated .",
    "this patch - specific basic reproduction number gives the dynamics of the disease at patch level @xcite , that is , if @xmath42 the disease persists in patch @xmath1 .",

    "the authors in @xcite also considered a multi - patch sir single outbreak model and deduced the final epidemic size .",
    "the sir single outbreak model considered in @xcite is the following : @xmath48 where @xmath49 , and @xmath50 and @xmath51 denotes the population of susceptible , infected and recovered immune individuals in patch @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath52 is the recovery rate in patch @xmath1 and @xmath53 , for @xmath54 .    in this chapter",
    "we will be making use of this modeling framework , but with a slightly different formulation , to test under what conditions the movement of individuals from high risk areas to nearby low risk areas due to the use of _ cordon sanitaire _ , is effective in reducing _ overall _ transmission by considering two - patch single outbreak that captures the dynamics of ebola in a two - patch setting .",
    "it is assumed that the community of interest is composed of two adjacent geographic regions facing highly distinct levels of evd infection .",
    "the levels of risk account for differences in population density , availability of medical services and isolation facilities , and the need to travel to a lower risk area to work .",
    "so , we let @xmath55 denote be the population in patch - one ( high risk ) and @xmath56 be the population in patch - two ( low risk ) . the classes @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath51 represent respectively , the susceptible , exposed , infectious and recovered sub - populations in patch @xmath1 ( @xmath54 ) .",

    "+ we model the new cases of infection per unit of time as follows :    * the density of infected individuals mingling in patch 1 at time t , who are only capable of infecting susceptible individuals currently in patch 1 at time @xmath62 , that is , the _ effective _ infectious proportion in patch 1 is given by @xmath63 where @xmath64 denotes the proportion of time residents from patch 1 spend in patch 1 and @xmath65 the proportion of time that residents from patch 2 spend in patch 1 .",

    "if we further assume that infection by dead bodies occurs only at the local level ( bodies are not moved ) then , by following the same rationale as in model [ ebolaasym ] , we arrive at the following model :    @xmath75    the difference , in the formulation of the infection term , from the one considered in @xcite is the _ effective _ density of infected . here ,",
    "the _ effective _ density of infected in patch 1 , for example , is @xmath76 whereas in @xcite , it is @xmath77 focusing on the changes on @xmath78 and @xmath79 and making use of the next generation approach we arrive at the basic reproductive number for the entire system , namely , @xmath80    we see , for example , that whenever the residents of patch @xmath2 ( @xmath81 ) live in communities where travel is not possible , that is , when @xmath82 or @xmath83 , then the populations decouple and , consequently , we have that @xmath84 where @xmath85 for @xmath86 ; that is , basic reproduction number of patch @xmath1 , @xmath54 , if isolated .      we keep track of the dead to make the mathematics simple .",
    "that is , to assuming that the population within each patch is constant . and",

    "@xmath89    we use the above model to find an `` approximate '' final size relationship .",
    "we make use of the notation @xmath90 for @xmath91 and @xmath92 for @xmath93 .",
    "we see that our analysis results guarantee that if @xmath94 is a positive decreasing function then @xmath95 .    since @xmath96 , then @xmath97 and since @xmath98",

    "if we now consider that @xmath100 then it follows that @xmath101 .",
    "similarly , it can be shown that @xmath102 focusing on the first two equations of system ( [ ebopatchyfin ] ) , we arrive at @xmath103 consequently , since @xmath104 , we have that @xmath105 and therefore @xmath106 using the equation for @xmath107 , we find that @xmath108 similarly , we can deduce the analogous relationships for patch 2 , namely that , @xmath109 from the equation for susceptible populations in patch 1 , we have that @xmath110 and , therefore that , @xmath111 for the second patch , we have that @xmath112 rewriting the expressions of @xmath113 and @xmath114 in terms of @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 , we arrive at the following two - patch `` approximate '' ( since we are counting the dead ) , the final size relation . more precisely , with @xmath119 , we have that @xmath120 @xmath121 or in vectorial notation , we have that where @xmath122 furthermore , we note that @xmath123 also appears in the next generation matrix , used to compute @xmath124 .",
    "further , we also have that , @xmath125 @xmath126 note that the vector in ( [ fsematrix ] ) is given by @xmath127 representing the proportion of people in patches one and two able to transmit ebola including transmission from handling dead bodies .",
    "@xmath128 , @xmath129 , we conclude that the matrix @xmath130 and the next generation matrix have the same eigenvalues , a result also found in @xcite .",
    "the basic model parameters used in the simulations are taken directly from the literature @xcite .",
    "we consider two patches and , for simplicity , it is assumed that they house the same number of individuals , namely , @xmath131 .",
    "however , implicitly , it is assumed that the density is considerably higher in the high risk area .",
    "we assume that an outbreak starts in the high risk patch 1 with @xmath132 .",
    "it propagates into patch 2 , low risk , defined by @xmath133 .",

    "the local basic reproductive numbers for each patch under isolation are @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "we chose to report on three different mobility scenarios : one way movement , symmetric and asymmetric mobility .",
    "for the first case , only residents from patch 1 travel , that is @xmath140 and @xmath141 . given",
    "that patch 1 is facing an epidemic , it is reasonable to assume that people in patch 2 prefer to avoid traveling to patch 1 , and so , it is reasonable to assume that @xmath141 .",
