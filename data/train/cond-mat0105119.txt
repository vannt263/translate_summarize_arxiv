    "in recent years , several interesting quasi one dimensional magnetic systems have been studied experimentally @xcite . among them some compounds containing cuo chains with edge sharing cuo@xmath10 plaquettes are expected to be described by the _ xxz _",
    "model with an important next - nn exchange @xmath1 in comparison with the nn exchange @xmath0 , and the latter can also be negative if the cu - o - cu angle is near 90@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "in addition , there has been a renewed interest in this _ xxz _ model ( which is equivalent to a zig - zag ladder ) recently @xcite . in particular , for the _ xx _ chain ( @xmath12 ) , field theoretical methods predicted a critical ( gapless ) phase with incommensurate correlations for @xmath13 .",
    "this seems confirmed by recent numerical work @xcite .",
    "the effects of magnetic field and magnetization jumps ( metamagnetism ) have also been studied recently @xcite .",
    "metamagnetism is more likely to occur in nature for ferromagnetic @xmath0 , because smaller anisotropies are required @xcite .",
    "interestingly , for ferromagnetic small @xmath0 a very small gap with an astronomically large associated correlation length has been found by field theory calculations and seems consistent with density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) calculations @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram of the model for @xmath14 has been accurately determined by nomura and okamoto using the method of level crossings of the excitation spectra , supported by results of conformal field - theory and renormalization group @xcite .",
    "this method has been also used successfully to determine phase diagrams of electronic models @xcite , and is related in some cases to jumps in topological numbers determined by berry phases @xcite . using the method of level crossings ,",
    "the phase diagram has been extended recently to the region @xmath15 @xcite . however , to assume that @xmath16 implies a different sign of the @xmath17 component of @xmath1 with respect to those of the @xmath18 plane .",
    "this is an unrealistic anisotropy ( this inconvenient is not present for @xmath0 because the sign of its @xmath18 components can be changed rotating every second spin in the chain by @xmath19 around the @xmath17 axis ) .",
    "in addition , the above mentioned systems containing cuo chains with edge - sharing plaquettes and cu - o - cu angle near 90@xmath11 , are expected to lie near the isotropic case @xmath20 @xmath21 .    in this work",
    "we calculate the phase diagram of the system for @xmath22 and @xmath23 using the method of level crossings .",
    "this includes the interpolations between the _ xx _ chain and the isotropic cases with ferro- or antiferromagnetic @xmath0 .",
    "the model is :    @xmath24 ,   \\label{h1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath25 is the @xmath26 component of the spin-1/2 operator at site @xmath27 .",
    "the basic idea of the method of level crossings is that the properties of a critical phase at low energies and large distances are ultimately determined by a scale invariant fixed point @xcite .",
    "then , using conformal field theory one can relate the excitation energy which corresponds to some operator @xmath28 at site @xmath27 ( for example a spin flip @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) , to the dependence of the correlation functions of this operator with distance : @xmath31 here @xmath32 is the length of the system , @xmath33 the spin - wave velocity , @xmath34 the ground state energy , and @xmath35 the critical dimension for the excitation @xmath36 .",
    "for example if @xmath37 , the _ xxz _ model was exactly solved and its properties are well known @xcite .",
    "the long distance dependence of the main correlation functions is    @xmath38    with @xmath39 if @xmath40 . for @xmath41",
    "the minimum excitation corresponds to a spin flip with wave vector @xmath42 the ground state has total spin projection @xmath43 its wave vector differs from that of the ground state in @xmath19 , and its parity under inversion @xmath44 is opposite to that of the ground state @xcite .",
    "the matrix element of @xmath45 between the ground state and the first excited doublet is different from zero .",
    "then , the correlation functions @xmath46 are the dominant ones at large distances .    at @xmath47 ,",
    "the above mentioned doublet crosses with the excited state with @xmath48 , ( with wave vector differing from the ground state in @xmath49 , and @xmath44 and parity under spin reversal @xmath50 opposite to that of the ground state ) .",
    "then , for @xmath51 , @xmath52 are the dominant correlations at large distances . at @xmath47 ,",
    "a gap opens and conformal invariance ceases to be valid , but for a sufficiently small gap so that correlation length is much larger than the size of the system , eqs .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) are still expected to hold .    in summary inside a critical phase or near its boundaries , the quantum numbers of the first excited state determine the dominant correlations at large distances , and therefore the crossings of the excited states determine the boundaries .    for small @xmath8 , the use of renormalization group allows to determine the size dependence of the crossings and to extrapolate them very accurately to the thermodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram we obtain in the plane @xmath53 as a function of @xmath54 with @xmath55 is represented in fig .",
    "the transition between dimer and spin fluid i phases for @xmath56 has been obtained before by nomura and okamoto @xcite .",
    "the spin fluid i phase is the well known ground state of the model for @xmath57 @xmath58 .",
    "the dimer or spin peierls phase has a spin gap and broken translational symmetry ( the unit cell is doubled ) in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the first excited state in finite systems has the same quantum numbers @xmath44 and @xmath50 as the ground state , but its wave vector differs by @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the new results for the spin fluid i*-*dimer transition are displayed in fig .",
    "2 . the transition points ( open squares ) were accurately determined extrapolating the crossing of the first excited state using data for chain lengths @xmath59 @xmath60 and @xmath61 . as explained earlier @xcite the crossing point",
    "has a @xmath62 size dependence .",
    "we have verified this also for negative @xmath2 ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . however , in the region denoted by * ? * in fig .",
    "3 ( constructed with data for @xmath63 ) , the first excited state has opposite @xmath44 and @xmath50 as the ground state .",
    "this is unexpected for the dimer phase .",
    "this might be a finite - size effect related with the high degeneracy at the point @xmath64 , @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "the other possibility is that a novel phase exists there , but this seems unlikely .",
    "after the transition to the dimer phase , if @xmath66 is increased further , the crossing of excitation spectra indicates another transition to a phase in which the first excited state has @xmath67 and wave vector @xmath68 .",
    "we denote this phase as `` spin fluid ii '' ( between quotation marks ) , because , as we discuss below , its nature is not established for all values of @xmath69 . for @xmath70 , from field theory",
    "results one might expect a spin fluid phase for large @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "one also expects that @xmath71 is actually incommensurate and slightly different from @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "however , we are not able to detect this difference using periodic boundary conditions .",
    "while the use of twisted boundary conditions has given interesting results concerning this incommensurability @xcite , to implement them in the level crossing method is time consuming and present technical complications , which we avoid in this work .    as shown in fig .",
    "4 , the level crossing for the dimer - spin fluid ii transition does not follow a @xmath62 dependence , and the extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit is not so accurate as for the dimer - spin fluid i transition .",
    "we have used a quadratic extrapolation in @xmath62 , using the data for @xmath73 @xmath74 @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "field - theoretical results suggest that there is a small gap and therefore no spin fluid phase for @xmath75 , and @xmath76 @xcite . for @xmath77 , @xmath21 , a tiny gap",
    "is predicted with an associated astronomically large length scale @xcite . a direct extrapolation of the gap from our finite - size results has an error larger or of the order of the gap itself and therefore",
    ", it is not able to establish if the gap is open or not .",
    "however , in principle we can check if a given phase is a spin fluid phase by other methods . for example",
    ", the energy per site should vary with system size as : @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the spin velocity ( or the sum of spin velocities if there were several types of low - energy excitations ) .",
    "we have checked that eq .",
    "( [ ene ] ) is not satisfied inside the dimer phase . a fit of the energies for @xmath80 @xmath81 @xmath61 and @xmath82 with eq .",
    "( [ ene ] ) give an error of @xmath79 which is of the order of @xmath79 itself .",
    "instead , inside both `` spin fluid '' phases the fit is good .",
    "the error in @xmath79 is of order of 0.1% inside spin fluid i , and of order of 1% inside spin fluid ii . within spin fluid",
    "i , we also find that several relations derived from conformal field theory hold , and are consistent within them within @xmath83 .",
    "the spin velocity can be calculated as : @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the lowest energy in the @xmath48 sector .",
    "the extrapolation of @xmath86 to the thermodynamic limit using a quadratic polynomial in @xmath87 is only slightly less than @xmath79 obtained fitting eq .",
    "( [ ene ] ) . also from the numerical calculation of the susceptibility @xmath88 and spin stiffness @xmath89 : @xmath90 }   \\label{xi}\\ ] ] @xmath91 where here @xmath92 is the lowest energy for total spin @xmath93 , and @xmath94 is a flux opposite for spin up and down , @xcite we can obtain @xmath95 in two independent ways from the relations @xcite : @xmath96 the correlation exponents obtained from these two equations and eqs .",
    "( [ v ] ) , ( [ xi ] ) , ( [ fi ] ) with @xmath97 @xmath98 also agree within 2% to 10% in the spin fluid phase i. the agreement improves with increasing @xmath2 .    a simple analysis based on eqs . ( [ xi ] ) , ( [ fi ] ) , ( [ k ] )",
    "is not possible in the `` spin fluid ii '' phase .",
    "( [ ene ] ) and ( [ v ] ) suggest that the low energy properties of this phase are given by _ two _ *  * free bosonic theories ( this is of course true if @xmath99 ) : @xmath100 , with @xmath101 slightly larger than @xmath86 ( see fig .",
    "this is in principle reasonable , since if there are two branches of low - energy excitations , eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) should give the smallest velocity .",
    "also one expects that eq .",
    "( [ fi ] ) gives the sum of both spin stiffness : @xmath102 the case of the susceptibility is more delicate . from thermodynamics",
    ", the total susceptibility should be the sum of those of both branches .",
    "however , our numerical study suggests that when one flips only the spin , it goes to the branch of lowest velocity .",
    "the results of field theory in the case @xmath103 @xcite ( and also those of the hubbard ladder for small interchain hopping @xcite ) suggest that the effective low - energy theory splits in two sectors , symmetric @xmath104 and antisymmetric @xmath105 , and in general , at least the latter is gapped . for @xmath12 ,",
    "@xmath106 is massless and @xmath105 has a gap which depends on @xmath107 as a power law @xcite . in the isotropic case @xmath108 ,",
    "both sectors have an exponentially small gap @xcite .",
    "these field theory results are inconsistent with the hypothesis of two branches of massless excitations in the `` spin fluid ii '' phase . to check this hypothesis we investigated the consistency of eqs .",
    "( [ ene ] ) with @xmath100 , ( [ v ] ) , ( [ d ] ) and an expression for the total susceptibility , for some values of @xmath109 and @xmath110 in the above mentioned cases ( @xmath12 , and @xmath9 )",
    ". we do not find reasonable results .",
    "for example , eliminating @xmath111 from these equations , sometimes one negative result arises .",
    "the most plausible explanation is that at least one of the modes is gapped , but the system is not large enough to detect it in the size dependence of the energy ( eq .",
    "( [ ene ] ) is only valid for sufficiently large @xmath32 ) .",
    "in fact , some of our fittings suggest that the magnitude of the slope of @xmath112 vs @xmath62 is decreasing with system size .    to end this section",
    ", we discuss the observed phases for @xmath113 . for @xmath114 the ground state changes from a fully polarized ferromagnet ( @xmath115 ) to @xmath48 at the solid squares of fig .",
    "1 . actually , there is a small region of intermediate @xmath93 between both phases , but it decreases with system size an seems to disappear in the thermodynamic limit . in the phase with @xmath116 the first excited state has wave vector @xmath117 .",
    "this fact , a study of correlation functions @xcite and a trivial analysis of energies in the classical limit @xmath118 , suggests that the phase has long - range af order of the type @xmath119 ( denoted as afii ) .",
    "the same features denoting the presence of the afii phase , are also found for @xmath120 and large @xmath66 .",
    "we expect that for @xmath121 , a spin wave approximation can describe qualitatively the essential physics .",
    "using the method of level crossings , we have calculated the phase diagram of the _ xxz _ model with next - nn exchange ( eq .",
    "( [ h1 ] ) ) for @xmath22 . for the dimer - spin fluid",
    "i transition our results are quite robust and extend previous results @xcite to the case @xmath122 . in this region",
    ", the transition takes place near @xmath123 . for larger values of @xmath66",
    "the method predicts a transition from the dimer phase to a second spin fluid phase .",
    "the transition is at @xmath124 for @xmath125 , in qualitative agreement with @xmath126 obtained in ref .",
    "for these values of @xmath69 , field theoretical results predict the existence of this phase @xcite .    for @xmath127 , a tiny gap with an astronomically large length scale is predicted in ref . @xcite .",
    "such a length is of course much larger than the system sizes we use , and our finite size results are consistent with those of ref .",
    "@xcite .    for @xmath9",
    ", we have tried to interpret the thermodynamic properties of the `` spin fluid ii '' phase as a sum of two independent fluids , but the results are not consistent .",
    "we conclude then that at this point , the extrapolation of the level crossings is not reliable and in agreement with other calculations @xcite , the gap persists for large @xmath1 .    from the parameters estimated for several compounds near the isotropic limit @xmath128 la@xmath129ca@xmath130cu@xmath131o@xmath132 ( @xmath133 ) , li@xmath134cuo@xmath134 ( @xmath135 ) and ca@xmath134y@xmath136cu@xmath137o@xmath138 ( @xmath139 ) @xcite our results indicate that these compounds lie outside the usual spin fluid i phase .",
    "they are in the af2 phase if @xmath140 .",
    "if @xmath141 , la@xmath129ca@xmath130cu@xmath131o@xmath132 is clearly in the dimer phase .",
    "one expects a very small , perhaps unobservable gap for ca@xmath134y@xmath134cu@xmath137o@xmath138 and spin - spin correlations with wave vector near @xmath117 .",
