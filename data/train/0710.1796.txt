    "the @xmath0 disintegration : @xmath1pp@xmath2 , p@xmath3 was studied at fermilab by h. park _ et al .",
    "the data were taken by the hypercp ( e871 ) collaboration .",
    "the authors observed a narrow range of dimuon masses , and supposed that the decay may proceed via a neutral intermediate state p@xmath4 , with a mass m=214.3  mev @xmath5 0.5  mev .",
    "several theoretical works were done assuming the existence of this new particle .",
    "he , tandean , and valencia performed a standard - model interpretation of the data @xcite . later on",
    "the same authors demonstrate that the new particle could be a pseudoscalar or axial - vector , but not scalar nor vector @xcite .",
    "they also suggested that the particle could be a very light pseudoscaler higgs @xcite .",
    "@xcite assume a fundamental spin zero boson , which couple to quarks with flavor changing transition s@xmath6d@xmath7 .",
    "they estimate the scalar and pseudoscalar coupling constants and evaluate several branching ratios .",
    "geng and hsiao @xcite found that the p@xmath2 can not be scalar but pseudoscalar , and determine that the decay width should be as small as @xmath810@xmath9mev .",
    "gorbunav and rubakov @xcite discuss possible sgoldstino interpretation of this possible particle .",
    "the experimental observation was based on three events .",
    "we anticipate that this low counting is due to their observation in a weak disintegration channel . in order to eventually strengthen this result by a direct observation ,",
    "we look at already existing data and try to observe a possible signature of ( a ) small peak(s ) , or ( a ) small shoulder(s ) , ( at a mass not far from the mass of p@xmath2 ) . such mass(es ) can be observed , either in the invariant masses of two muons , m@xmath10 , or in missing masses of different reactions , studied with incident leptons as well as with incident hadrons .",
    "however the signal , if any , is expected to be small .",
    "the spectra are therefore presented in the semi - log scale .",
    "the signals will be superposed to a relatively large tail of one pion missing mass .",
    "therefore the signal , if any , can only be observed in precise data , with large statistics , good resolution and small binning .",
    "moreover , the mass range studied must be small .",
    "such data are scarce and concern reactions studied at rather low incident energies , with good resolution .",
    "when we found a hint for a small effect , we read out and reanalyzed the data .",
    "several such structures were selected and presented below .",
    "the pp@xmath6ppx ( x -meson type ) reaction was studied at saturne ( spes3 beam line ) , at t@xmath11=1520 , 1805 , and 2100  mev @xcite .",
    "the missing mass displays a broad structure , in the mass range 280@xmath12m@xmath12580  mev , unstable for different kinematical conditions and slightly oscillating @xcite , previously called the abc effect ; it was analysed as being due to a superposition of four narrow mesonic states : m=310  mev , 350  mev , 430  mev , and 495  mev @xcite . above the @xmath13 mass ,",
    "narrow mesonic structures were extracted at the following masses : m=550 , 588 , 608 , 647 , 681 , 700 , 715 , and 750  mev @xcite .",
    "since the widths of the missing mass peaks increase for increasing spectrometer angles , we keep only the three lowest angle spectra at t@xmath11=1520  mev , add them , and show the resulting spectra in fig .",
    "the high counting rate allows to extract a clear peak at m@xmath14=216.5  mev .",
    "the reaction pp@xmath6pp@xmath15 was studied close to threshold at celsius ( uppsala ) @xcite .",
    "the missing mass data , after integration over two channels , are shown in fig .",
    "the two @xmath16 phase space starts at m@xmath17240  mev .",
    "the events in the range 170  @xmath12m@xmath18 240  mev , are mostly physical as the background contribution is estimated to less than 10 events / channel .",
    "these data are fitted with a @xmath16 peak and two small structures , having the same shape as the @xmath16 peak , are extracted at m@xmath14=182 and 220  mev .",
    "the pp@xmath6ppx reaction was also studied at j@xmath19lich cosy - tof @xcite .",
    "both protons in the final state were detected in order to study the @xmath13 production .",
    "the data were read and shown in fig .",
    "since they are given in the original work as a function of the missing mass squared with constant binning ( @xmath20m@xmath14=0.002  gev@xmath21 ) , they are plotted versus m@xmath14 as given , up to 210  mev ( empty circles ) , and for larger missing mass they are integrated over two channels ( full circles ) .",
    "the peak corresponding to @xmath16 missing mass is fitted by a gaussian , at m@xmath14=135  mev ( @xmath22=67  mev ) , and the data at larger missing mass are fitted with a polynomial .",
    "two structures can be extracted , the first one at m=197  mev , not valid statistically , and the second at m=224  mev .",
    "they are very narrow , therefore , if fitted by only one structure , which includes both narrow structures , they result in a broad gaussian centered at m=214  mev ( dashed curve in fig  1(c ) )    [ .5 ]    [ .5 ]      the @xmath16 electroproduction at threshold for q@xmath21=0.05  gev@xmath21 was measured at mami @xcite .",
    "the missing mass spectrum , up to m@xmath14=200  mev is given in fig .",
    "3(b ) of @xcite , after background subtraction .",
    "the data are read , integrated over 4 channels and reported in fig .",
    "a peak at m@xmath14=182  mev is clearly observed .",
    "indeed , the resolution in these data is as good as fwhm=2.2  mev , as given in the @xmath16 peak ( removed here to enhance the mass range discussed ) .",
    "the increase of the number of events between 48@xmath12m@xmath23  - m@xmath2456  mev is physical .",
    "the contribution from two pion production , can not be large at a so low mass value as m=180  mev .",
    "the roper resonance was studied at jlab hall a using the p(@xmath25 reaction @xcite .",
    "two missing mass spectra were given at @xmath26=90@xmath2 and @xmath26=-90@xmath2 .",
    "no shoulder is observed in this last spectra .",
    "the values of the spectra at @xmath26=90@xmath2 are read and shifted in order to put the @xmath16 peak at his right mass , namely at m@xmath14=135  mev .",

    "the authors give in fig .  1 of ref",
    ". @xcite an example of missing mass distribution for the reaction p(e , ep)x .",
    "these data are read and reported in fig .",
    "the widths of all @xmath16 and @xmath13 peaks are related to their masses ( proportional to 1/m ) .",
    "these widths define the width of the small peak extracted at m=220  mev .",
    "several other peaks are introduced , following the results of the pp@xmath6ppx reaction studied at spes3 ( saturne , saclay ) @xcite .",
    "after introduction of an arbitrary two - pion phase space , a contribution of the p(e , ep)@xmath27 reaction is observed around m@xmath14=0 .",
    "[ .5 ]    more detailed data from the same experiment @xcite , are reported in several spectra where structures can be extracted in the same missing mass range .",
    "the measurements were performed for two values of the four momentum transfer squared between the initial and the final electron , namely at q@xmath21=2.8  gev@xmath21 and q@xmath21=4  gev@xmath21 .",
    "the measurements were performed for a few values of p@xmath28 and a few values of @xmath29 .",

    "4 shows another selection of spectra corresponding to q@xmath21=2.8  gev@xmath21 . in both figures",
    "empty circles correspond to monte - carlo simulations @xcite and full circles correspond to data . in the missing mass range studied here an excess of counts",
    "can be seen between data and the simulation which were fitted by a polynomial .",
    "the quantitative informations are given in table  i. the discrepancy between data and simulation for m@xmath1860  mev has been attributed to the bethe - heitler process ( ep@xmath6ep@xmath27 reaction ) .",
    "[ .5 ]      we have looked at some existing data , in order to find evidence for the existence of a new boson .",
    "all spectra shown here , display a structure , but at slightly different masses .",
    "however , there is an indication of a possible regrouping around several mass values .",
    "the statistics is too low for giving an evidence if the results privilege one unstable mass or a few better defined masses .",
    "we increase therefore the number of spectra studied , as those shown in figs  3 and 4 .",
    "these spectra are not shown here .",
    "the corresponding quantitative informations are summarized in table  i. they favor a regrouping into several values ; the same conclusion is favored by the existence of more than one peak in the same spectrum , as in fig .",
