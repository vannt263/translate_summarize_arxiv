    "the pairs have a finite lifetime , the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) time , inversely proportional to the distance from the critical temperature @xmath5 .",
    "these superconducting fluctuations strongly affect both the thermodynamic and transport properties and since many years they are widely studied both theoretically and experimentally  @xcite .",
    "+ the first analysis of fluctuation corrections has been performed on electrical conductivity where the pairing leads to three distinct contributions named the aslamazov - larkin ( al ) , the maki - thompson ( mt ) and density of states ( dos ) terms . in the first one ,",
    "the formation of cooper pair leads to a parallel superconducting channel in the normal phase ; the second takes into account the coherent scattering off impurities of the ( interacting ) electrons ; finally , the third one is due to the rearrangement of the states close to the fermi energy since electrons involved in pair transport are no longer available for single particle transport .",
    "both the al and mt terms lead to an enhancement of the conductivity above @xmath1 , on the contrary , the dos correction is of opposite sign .",
    "+ the analysis of superconducting fluctuation corrections to thermal conductivity dates back to the early 1960s , when schmid  @xcite and caroli and maki  @xcite found an expression for the heat current in the framework of the phenomenological time dependent gl theory , ( tdgl ) .",
    "more recently , a complete analysis was performed , in the same framework of the tdgl , by ussishkin@xcite .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite first pointed out the divergence of the thermal conductivity in the vicinity of the critical temperature due to the opening of the fluctuation pseudogap in the density of states ( dos ) energy dependence in the homogeneous case .",
    "niven and smith have shown  @xcite that abrahams s dos correction [ @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 being the so - called ginzburg - levanyuk parameter ] is exactly compensated by the regular maki - thompson ( mt ) one ; hence , all singular first order fluctuation corrections are cancelled out . the only surviving contribution to heat conductivity ,",
    "the aslamazov - larkin ( al ) one , is non - singular in temperature .",
    "therefore , in bulk metals , no singular behaviour of the heat current is expected at the metal - superconductor phase transition .",
    "+ in this paper we are interested in the superconducting fluctuation corrections to the thermal conductivity in a granular superconductors , an ensemble of metallic grains embedded in an insulating amorphous matrix and undergoing a metal - superconductor phase transition due to the existence of pairing interaction inside each grain .",
    "the electrons can diffuse in the system due to tunneling between the grains .",
    "experimentally , this kind of systems have been investigated , for example , in ref . .",
    "each al grain has an average dimension of 120 , while the sample has a linear dimension of the order of mm , that is , much larger than the superconducting coherence length .",
    "the reason for studying thermal transport in granular metals is that , depending on the temperature regime , a radically different behaviour , as compared with the homogeneous case , may emerge .",
    "in fact , in granular material ( a similar situation occurs in layered superconductors ) the al and mt contributions are of higher order in the tunneling amplitude as compared to the dos .",
    "this effect has been observed , for example , in the electrical  @xcite and the optical conductivity  @xcite of layered superconductors and the electrical conductivity  @xcite of granular systems .",
    "indeed , in granular superconductors there is a temperature region in which a singular correction due to superconducting fluctuations for a quasi - zero - dimensional system dominates the behaviour of the thermal conductivity ; such a correction can be either negative or positive , depending on the ratio between the barrier transparency and the critical temperature @xmath1 .",
    "when the temperature approaches @xmath1 , the behaviour observed in homogeneous systems is recovered , and the divergence will be cut off to crossover to the regular behaviour . moreover , a significant difference with the homogeneous systems is present , the constant correction at @xmath9 being either negative or positive depending on the above - mentioned ratio . for some choice of the parameter , a non - monotonic temperature dependent behaviour of the correction",
    "is possible .",
    "+ a phenomenological approach to granular superconductors has been proposed long ago  @xcite , while the microscopic theory has only been formulated very recently  @xcite .",
    "the difference between bulk and granular microscopic theory is mainly based on the renormalization of the superconducting fluctuation propagator due to the presence of tunneling .",
    "this renormalization accounts for the possibility that each electron forming the fluctuating cooper pair tunnels between neighbor grains during the ginzburg - landau time .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ model ] , we describe and formulate the model . section  [ fluct ] contains the main steps and assumptions of the calculation of fluctuation propagator .",

    "dos , mt , and al corrections are evaluated . for each of those corrections , an explicit form for the response function is presented . in the final section ,",
    "we discuss the overall behaviour of the fluctuation corrections to thermal conductivity as a function of temperature . for temperatures sufficiently far from @xmath1 , the system behaves as in the zero - dimensional case . in this region ,",

    "we assume that the tunneling contacts are _ not _ point - like .",
    "if they were ( ) , the tunneling conductance of the grains would be renormalized to @xmath159 by the backscattering : this fact is immediately understood saying that in this situation the average area of a tunneling contact is @xmath160 where @xmath161 is the fermi wavelength and no more than one channel can be available for the transport .",
    "one is consequently forced to take into account higher - order diagrams in tunneling even in the green s function .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath162 , higher - order diagrams will be smaller by a factor @xmath163 and in our approximation they can be safely neglected .",
    "the tunneling renormalization of the cooperon vertex correction is mandatory in the calculation of other thermodynamic or transport quantities , such as the correction to the superconducting critical temperature@xcite or the superconducting fluctuation corrections to the electrical conductivity in the absence of the magnetic field@xcite , in order to avoid spurious divergences . in the case of the heat conductivity ,",
    "such a renormalization gives only a small correction of the order of @xmath164 and can be safely neglected ."
