    "in recent years , the sub - arcsec resolution of the _ hubble space telescope _ has allowed the study of galactic nuclei , unveiling the presence of distinct components such as small - scale stellar discs ( see pizzella et al .",
    "2002 and references therein ) and nuclear clusters ( carollo et al . 1997 ; bker et al . 2002 ; graham & guzman 2003 ) .",
    "to date surface - brightness distributions of nuclear stellar discs ( hereinafter nsd ) have been measured for only a few of s0s ( scorza & van den bosch 1998 ; van den bosch et al .",
    "1998 ; kormendy et al .",
    "1996 ) and early - type spiral galaxies ( pizzella et al .",
    "they have smaller scale lengths ( @xmath21030 pc ) and higher central surface brightnesses ( @xmath21519 mag arcsec@xmath3 in the @xmath4 band ) with respect to those of embedded stellar discs , which have been found in several elliptical and lenticular galaxies (  scorza & bender 1995 , hereinafter sb95 ) .",
    "although only few nsds have been studied in detail , they may be quite a common structure in the central regions of spheroids .",
    "indeed , nuclear discs of gas , dust and stars have been clearly detected in a large number of early - type galaxies (  jaffe et al .",
    "1994 ; lauer et al .",

    "2001 ; tran et al . 2001 ; trujillo et al .",
    "2004 ) , but the photometric parameters of such discs have not yet been derived . furthermore , hst imaging in near - infrared bandpasses provided indirect signatures of the presence of nsds as discy isophotes in the nuclei of early - type galaxies ( ravindranath et al .",
    "2001 ) or photometrically - distinct exponential components in bulges ( balcells et al . 2003 , 2004 ) .",
    "the existence of nsds suggests that the continuity of the disc properties , with a smooth variation of scale parameters from spirals to discy ellipticals along a sequence of decreasing disc - to - bulge ratio ( kormendy & bender 1996 ) , could be extended to nuclear scales ( van den bosch 1998 ) . in this framework nsds",
    "could provide important clues to the assembly scenario of their host galaxies .    in the current picture , the nsds observed in bulges of s0s and spiral galaxies are believed to have formed either from a secular evolution of a nuclear bar (  ngc 4570 , van den bosch et al .",
    "1998 ; scorza & van den bosch 1998 ; van den bosch & emsellem 1998 ) or as the end result of a merging event (  ngc 4698 , bertola et al . 1999 ; pizzella et al .",
    "each of these scenarios is likely to be correct for some but not for all the objects . in both of them",
    "the gas is efficiently directed toward the galaxy centre , where it first dissipates and settles onto an equilibrium plane and then forms into stars .",
    "although the decoupled kinematics strongly suggest a later infall (  ngc 4486a , kormendy et al .",
    "2001 ) or merger (  holley - bockelmann & richstone 2000 ) , the frequently indistinguishable star formation history remains an enigma .",
    "yet , these processes are expected to lead to distinct features in stellar populations of nsds and surrounding spheroids .",
    "the measurement of the kinematics of some early - type galaxies ( elliptical and s0 galaxies ) revealed evidence for kinematically decoupled or peculiar galaxy cores ( see bertola & corsini 1999 for a review ) , strongly indicative of formation by galaxy - galaxy merging (  kormendy 1984 ; see mehlert et al .",
    "1998 ) and references therein ) .",
    "such kinematically - distinct cores have been associated with a central disc component (  rix & white 1992 ; mehlert et al .",
    "however , triaxial galaxies with radius - dependent ellipsoids , can , in projection , mimic kinematically decoupled cores ( see arnold , de zeeuw & hunter 1994 , and references therein ) .",
    "spectroscopic absorption line - strength indices ( faber et al . 1985 ; trager et al . 1998 ) constrain the luminosity - weighted stellar population age , metallicity and alpha - element overabundance by comparison with evolutionary population synthesis models ( worthey 1994 ; maraston 1998 ; tantalo et al 1998 ; vazdekis 1999 ; thomas , maraston & bender 2003 , hereafter tmb ; bruzual & charlot 2003 ) .",
    "absorption line - strength indices have been measured out to one effective radii for elliptical galaxies (  davies et al .",
    "1993 ; gonzlez 1993 ; halliday 1999 ; mehlert et al .",
    "such measurements can distinguish between merging and dissipational formation scenarios by the constraint of metallicity gradients , dating of the latest episode of star formation and the measurement of the timescale over which the bulk of the star formation has taken place .",

    "( 2001 ) presented evidence for a metal - rich core but constant age and -enhancement for both the kinematically - distinct core and parent galaxy .",
    "both studies are consistent with the core and the main galaxy having experienced similar star formation histories .    in this paper",
    ", we use archival hst imaging and ground - based spectroscopy to investigate the photometric parameters and stellar population diagnostics of the nsds hosted by the two virgo galaxies ngc 4458 and ngc 4478 .",
    "ngc 4458 and ngc 4478 are classified as e0 - 1 ( de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "1991 , hereinafter rc3 ) and e2 ( sandage & tammann 1981 ; rc3 ) , respectively .",
    "they are both low - luminosity ellipticals with a @xmath5 ( rc3 ) at a distance of 12.6 mpc ( tully 1988 , @xmath6  mpc@xmath7 ) .",
    "they have a power - law central luminosity profile ( ferrarese et al . 1994 ; faber et al .",

    "1987 ; caon et al .",
    "1990 ; peletier et al .",
    "1990 ) , which have been explained as due to tidal interaction with ngc 4461 and ngc 4486 .",
    "recently , the stellar kinematics along the major and minor axes of ngc 4458 and ngc 4478 have been measured by halliday et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , who found the signature of a kinematically - decoupled core in their inner @xmath9 arcsec .",
    "in particular , ngc 4458 has a clear counter - rotating core along the major axis , while ngc 4478 has a cold component detected along both the major and the minor axis .    in section [ sec : photometry ]",
    "we perform the photometric analysis of the archival hst images of the nuclei of ngc 4458 and ngc 4478 in order to derive the surface brightness profiles and scale parameters of their nsds . in section [ sec : spectroscopy ] we present the absorption line - strength indices as a function of radius of the major and minor axes of both galaxies from the thesis research of halliday ( 1999 ) . in section [ sec : agemetover ] we combine photometric and spectroscopic results to assess age , metallicity and overabundances of stellar populations of the two nsds and surrounding spheroids .",
    "this allowed us to suggest possible formation and evolution scenarios for ngc 4458 and ngc 4478 .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we retrieved wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) images of ngc 4458 and ngc 4478 from the hst archive .",
    "data for the filter f814w were selected as a compromise between obtaining data in identical bandpasses for both galaxies and minimizing the effects of dust on photometric measurements .",

    "all exposures were taken with the telescope guiding in fine lock , which typically gave an rms tracking error of @xmath10 arcsec .",
    "we focused our attention on the planetary camera chip ( pc ) where the nucleus of both galaxies was centred .",
    "this consists of @xmath11 pixels of @xmath12 arcsec@xmath13 each , yielding a field of view of about @xmath14 arcsec@xmath13 .",
    "the images were calibrated using the standard reduction pipeline maintained by the space telescope science institute .",
    "reduction steps include bias subtraction , dark current subtraction , and flat - fielding and are described in detail in holtzman et al .",
    "( 1995a ) .",
    "subsequent reduction was completed using standard tasks in the stsdas package of iraf .",
    "bad pixels were corrected by means of a linear one - dimensional interpolation using the data quality files and the wfixup task .",
    "different images of the same target were aligned and combined using imshift and knowledge of the offset shifts .",
    "cosmic ray events were removed using the task crrej .",
    "the cosmic - ray removal and bad pixel correction were checked by inspection of the residual images between the cleaned and combined image and each of the original frames .",
    "residual cosmic rays and bad pixels in the pc were corrected by manually editing the combined image with imedit . the sky level ( @xmath15 count pixel@xmath7 ) was determined from regions free of sources in the wide field chips and subtracted from the pc frame after appropriate scaling .      to test for the presence of a nsd in ngc 4458 and ngc 4478 , we constructed the unsharp - masked image of the pc frame using an identical procedure to pizzella et al .",
    "we divided each image by itself after convolution by a circular gaussian of width @xmath16 and 6 pixels , corresponding to @xmath17 arcsec and @xmath18 arcsec , respectively ( figure [ fig : unsharp ] ) .",
    "this procedure enhanced any surface - brightness fluctuation and non - circular structure extending over a spatial region comparable to the @xmath19 of the smoothing gaussian .",
    "two values of @xmath19 were adopted to attempt the identification of structures with different scale lengths .",
    "a highly elongated structure is clearly visible in the nucleus of each galaxies .",
    "these structures are not artifacts of the unsharp - masking procedure . in figure",
    "[ fig : unsharp ] we show as a counter - example the unsharp - masked image of ngc 4539 which has been obtained using an identical method to that for ngc 4458 and ngc 4478 ; we clearly do not detect an elongated disc - like structure .",
    "moreover the nuclear structures of ngc 4458 and ngc 4478 are associated with a central increase in ellipticity measured by performing an isophotal analysis using the iraf task ellipse ( figure [ fig : photometry_disk_subtracted ] ) .",
    "we analyzed the isophotal profiles of both galaxies by first masking foreground stars and then fitting ellipses to the isophotes .",
    "we allowed the centres of the ellipses to vary , to test whether the galaxies were disturbed . within the errors of the fits",
    ", we found no evidence of variations in the fitted centre .",
    "the ellipse fitting was repeated with the ellipse centres fixed .",
    "the resulting azimuthally averaged surface brightness , ellipticity , position angle , the fourth ( @xmath20 ) , and sixth ( @xmath21 ) cosine fourier coefficients profiles are presented in figure [ fig : photometry_disk_subtracted ] . in the innermost @xmath22 arcsec we measured positive values of the @xmath20 , and @xmath21 fourier coefficients , which describe the discy deviation of the isophotes from pure ellipses ( jedrzejewski 1987 ) .",
    "these photometric features have been also observed in the hst / f555w image for ngc 4458 ( lauer et al .",
    "1995 ; trujillo et al . 2004 ) and in the hst / f702w image of ngc 4478 ( van den bosch et al .",
    "1994 ; rest et al . 2001 ; trujillo et al . 2004 ) and confirm the presence of a nsd in both galaxies .        after establishing the existence of nsds",
    ", we measured their photometric properties using the method described by sb95 .",
    "this method is based on the assumption that isophotal disciness is the result of the superimposition of a spheroidal component ( which is either a host elliptical galaxy or a bulge component ) and an inclined disc .",
    "the two components are assumed to have both perfectly elliptical isophotes with constant but different ellipticities . when adopting this technique to study the innermost regions of galaxies it is essential to restore the images from the effects of the hst point spread function ( psf ) in order to properly derive the photometric parameters of the nsds , as shown by scorza & van den bosch ( 1998 ) .",
    "such deconvolution was performed through the richardson - lucy method by means of the iraf task lucy .",
    "although susceptible to noise amplification , this algorithm was shown by van den bosch et al .",
    "( 1998 ) to lead to a restored surface - brightness distribution comparable to that obtained using a multi - gaussian representation ( monnet et al . 1992 ; cappellari 2002 ) .",
    "we believe that the results obtained by van den bosch et al .",
    "( 1998 ) are directly applicable to our case : we are dealing with images obtained with similar or longer integration times , galaxies with less steep surface - brightness profiles and nsds with equal or larger scale lengths .",
    "we decided to deconvolve the images with a number of iterations between 3 and 6 .",
    "a larger number of iterations does not affect the result of the decomposition but does amplify the noise .",
    "for each given image and nucleus position on the pc we adopted a model psf calculated using the tiny - tim package ( krist & hook 1999 ) .",
    "no correction for telescope jitter was necessary .",
    "the sb95 method consists of the iterative subtraction of a thin disc model characterized by an exponential surface - brightness profile with central surface brightness @xmath23 and radial scale length @xmath0 , and by an axial ratio @xmath24 .",
    "the disc parameters are adjusted until the departures from perfect ellipses are minimized (  @xmath25 and @xmath26 are close to zero ) . for each disc model",
    "we obtained the disc - free image of the galaxy by subtracting the disc model from the galaxy image .",
    "we performed an isophotal analysis on the disc - free image using the iraf task ellipse .",
    "we defined    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the value of the @xmath20 fourier coefficient measured for the @xmath29th isophote in the disc - free image , and @xmath30 is the number of fitted isophotes .",
    "we assumed @xmath31 as typical error on @xmath32 for all the isophotes in the region of the nsd .",
    "we defined the reduced @xmath33 as @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the number of free parameters , namely @xmath23 , @xmath0 , and @xmath24 .",
    "according to our technique for photometric decomposition the minimum value of @xmath36 corresponds to the best - fitting model of the nsd .",
    "we found @xmath37 for ngc 4458 and @xmath38 for ngc 4478 .",
    "we determined @xmath39 and derived its confidence levels under the assumption that the errors are normally distributed ( press et al .",
    "the resulting contour plots of @xmath40 are shown in figure [ fig : confidence_levels ] and they allowed us to derive the best - fitting values of @xmath23 , @xmath0 and @xmath24 and their @xmath41 errors .",
    "we derived the johnson @xmath42band central surface brightness of the nsds from the hst vegamag system ( holtzman et al .",
    "1995b ) using the stsdas task synphot .",
    "since this correction depends on the galaxy spectral energy distribution , it has been calculated using the spectral template for elliptical galaxies by kinney et al .",
    "the resulting relation is @xmath43 .",
    "we derived the scale length of the nsds assuming a distance of 12.6 mpc for both galaxies .",
    "the inclination of nsds has been calculated as @xmath44 .",
    "the resulting values of central surface brightness in the @xmath4 band , scale length and inclination for both nsds are listed in table [ tab : disk_parameters ] .",
    "the disciness of ngc 4458 and ngc 4478 disappears after the subtraction of the best - fitting model of the nsd as it results from the elliptical shape of their isophotes as shown by the photometric profiles plotted in figure [ fig : photometry_disk_subtracted ] .",
    "we tested that the result of the photometric decomposition is independent of position on the pc chip where the psf is built .",
    "the resulting fraction of total luminosity contributed by the nuclear disc of ngc 4458 and ngc 4478 is plotted as a function of radius in figure [ fig : photometry_disk_subtracted ] .      in applying the decomposition method by sb95 we assumed that the surface - brightness profile of the nsds was exponential . to verify this assumption",
    ", we derived the surface - brightness profile of the nsds using the alternative method of seifert & scorza ( 1996 , hereinafter ss96 ) .",
    "this decomposition method was developed to identify embedded discs in ellipticals and bulges without any _ a priori _ assumptions of the parametric law for their surface - brightness profile .",
    "in the deconvolved image of the galaxy we masked the region of the nsd with a double - cone mask , and fit ellipses to the isophotes in the remaining part of image using the iraf task ellipse to derive the photometric properties of the host galaxy .",
    "a double - cone mask centred on the galaxy major axis is an optimal choice for the highly - inclined nsds of ngc 4458 and ngc 4478 since we expect that the isophotes close to the galaxy minor axis will be only slightly contaminated by light from the nsds .",
    "the very central portion of the galaxy image was not masked to allow meaningful isophotes to be fitted .",
    "these masks correspond to the central @xmath45 pixel ( @xmath46 arcsec@xmath13 ) of ngc 4458 and @xmath47 pixel ( @xmath48 arcsec@xmath13 ) of ngc 4478 .",
    "the opening angle of the mask ( @xmath49 ) was adjusted to minimize the influence of the nsd on the fitted parameters of the surrounding galaxy bulge component , but to ensure that a sufficient number of data points for the model derivation remained .",
    "a model was constructed to have perfectly elliptical isophotes with the same surface brightness , ellipticity and position angle radial profiles which we obtained from the isophotal fit .",
    "we subtracted the galaxy model from the original image to obtain a residual image which shows an elongated structure , namely the nsd , responsible for the higher - order deviations from perfectly elliptical isophotes .",
    "we extracted the surface - brightness radial profile along the major axis of the residual disc which was close to being exponential .",
    "scale lengths are consistent within their errors to those measured using the sb95 method , while the central surface brightnesses are somewhat fainter .",
    "this discrepancy in the surface brightnesses derived for using the sb95 and ss96 methods is due to the actual shape of the double - cone mask where we excluded the central region in order to allow meaningful isophotes to be fitted . in this way",
    "the observed central surface brightness is assigned to the host galaxy and the central surface brightness of the nsd is therefore underestimated .",

    "in contrast , the ( relatively large ) scale length and ( relatively low ) central surface brightness of the disc of ngc 4478 are in between the typical values found for discy ellipticals and nsds .",
    "no correlations are found with global properties (  luminosity , scale - length , disc - to - bulge ratio ) of the host galaxies .     finally , on a speculative line of thought without presumption of rigourness , it is interesting to correlate the order of magnitude rotational velocities estimated above ( 30  for ngc 4458 and 50  for ngc 4478 ) with the estimated magnitudes of the discs .",
    "we find that discs following the tully - fisher relation ( as in haynes et al .",
