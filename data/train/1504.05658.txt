    "thus the total stress energy , which is the sum of the energies of all six components , is equal to @xmath11 , i.e. , the potential energy of a classical 3d harmonic oscillator .",
    "an explanation for this result has been suggested @xcite .",
    "the equipartition breaks down in the glass state .",

    "there are two points which we need from the the eshelby s solution .",
    "1 ) the final strain and stress fields in the inclusion after the deformation , placing the inclusion back into the matrix , and joining are constant . the final strain and stress fields in the inclusion , of course ,",
    "depend on the unconstrained strain initially applied to the inclusion .",

    "the fact that the stress field is the same everywhere in the inclusion serves well for this purpose .",
    "since the inclusion s stress ellipse is known , the stress field at any point @xmath121 in the matrix can be found . since the stress tensor at point @xmath121",
    "is known it can be diagonalized and thus it is possible to associate with point @xmath121 its own stress ellipse with parameters ( @xmath127 , @xmath128 ) and the orientation @xmath129 with respect to @xmath126 .    at this point",
    "it becomes apparent that considerations of correlations for the eshelby s inclusion problem are quite similar to the considerations that were already done for the atomic level stresses .",

    "the comparison of fig.[fig : bocf2500 ] with fig.[fig : bocf22500 ] suggests that at @xmath199 the small system exhibits observable size effects .",
    "note that at @xmath199 the decay length is larger than ( 1/2 ) of @xmath203 in the small system .",
    "thus in the small system the bond - order correlation function does not decay completely on the length of the half of the simulation box .",
    "it also follows from the data obtained on the large system that exponential fit to the data is better than can be any algebraic fit at both temperatures .",
    "thus , in our view , it follows from fig . [",
    "fig : bocf2500],[fig : bocf22500 ] that it is impossible to make a qualitative distinction between the liquid states at @xmath163 and @xmath199 .",
    "the observation of the algebraic decay at @xmath199 reported in ref.@xcite is probably related to the size effects .",
    "it was demonstrated that it is possible to study liquid ( and glass ) structures through considerations of correlations between the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the atomic level stress tensors of different atoms .",
    "it was shown that on decrease of temperature some of the studied correlation functions exhibit pronounced changes in the range of distances that corresponds to the first minimum of the pair density function .",
    "these changes could not be guessed from the behaviour of the pair density function .",
    "thus the suggested method provides additional information and it is of interest to investigate evolution of stress correlations with this method in model supercooled liquids on decrease of temperature .",
    "we also demonstrated that interpretations of the angular dependencies of the stress correlation functions reported in ref.@xcite are essentially incorrect .",
    "in particular , the authors of ref.@xcite associate the angular dependencies observed in the stress correlation functions with the angular dependencies of the eshelby s stress field .",
    "we demonstrated that anisotropic stress fields observed in ref.@xcite originate from the rotational properties of the stress tensors .",
    "we also had shown that information which is really related to the anisotropic eshelby s stress fields is embedded into the isotropic stress correlation functions @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath96 which we studied in this work .    from a purely pragmatic perspective",
    "we have shown that eight 2d - panels of the stress correlation functions presented in ref.@xcite can be reproduced using only 3 correlation functions which depend only on @xmath69 , i.e. , from the function @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath96 @xcite .",
    "this clearly advances understanding of the plots of the stress correlation functions presented in ref.@xcite .",
