    "if we treat ps as a 1d material , it would be more appropriate to write g(e ) = @xmath17 , where e is measured from the band edge .",
    "clearly the jdos in ps is expected to be different from that of bulk c - silicon . for a 1d system having a single direct band gap @xmath14 ,",
    "it is easy to show that the jdos is proportional to @xmath18 . in such a case , a plot of @xmath19 vs e should peak at @xmath14 . on the otherhand , for an indirect band gap material ( assuming that momentum k is not conserved in this pseudo 1d system during optical transition ) ,",

    "free standing samples are lifted off the substrate by increasing the current density to @xmath27 200 ma/@xmath26 .",
    "the samples are then washed in water to get rid of hf , rinsed in n - pentane and finally dried in air on a glass substrate for transmission measurements .",
    "transmission measurements are carried out using a cvi 240 digikrom monochromator with a tungsten lamp as a source , silicon detector and sr 530 lock -in amplifier .for some samples we also use a cary 1756 spectrometer .",
    "we have checked that internal multiple scattering does not dominate the absorption in our samples .",
    "this is done by making two ps samples of two different thickness ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 respectively ) and ensuring that the transmission curves are the same for both samples at low absorption @xmath30 .",
    "the absorption coefficient @xmath31 as a function of wavelength @xmath32 is obtained from the normalised transmittance t(@xmath32 ) using    @xmath33    the reflectivity ( r ) is obtained in the low @xmath12 region using the relation r = ( 1-t)/(1+t ) .",
    "p is the porosity of the layer and t is its thickness .",

    "we see from figure 1 that the points nearly fit a straight line with slope one .",
    "we hence conclude that optical transmission measurements can reliably be used to obtain the porosity of porous silicon in a @xmath24 fashion .",
    "figure 2 shows the normalized transmission data on free standing ps films made from p type ( resistivity 4 ohm - cm ) si substrate and also from p@xmath25 si ( 0.01 ohm - cm ) substrate .",
    "we see from the figure that for the ps grown on p type si , the onset of low absorption occurs at a smaller wavelength than that for ps grown on p@xmath25 si .",
    "this signifies that the p ps has a higher band gap than p@xmath25 ps and is in agreement with the reported results @xmath44 .",
    "figure 3 is a plot of log(@xmath12 ) vs e at 300 k and at 100 k. the absorption at low temperature is reduced with respect to that at room temperature .",

    "an explanation of this phenomena on the basis of our simulated results is given in section iv .",
    "+    we now attempt to understand the optical absorption process in ps with the help of some model calculations and simulations , assuming that ps has a distribution of band gaps .",
    "we model the nanostructures that make up ps to be 1d parallelopipeds of square cross sections of side d and constant length l. since d is typically 20 - 40 @xmath46 , the band gap of the material is enhanced due to quantum size effects .",
    "we assume that the effective band gap ( lowest energy gap ) for a particular parallelopiped is the minimum separation between the conduction band and the valence band states for quantum numbers n@xmath47 = 1 and n@xmath48 = 1 .",
    "we also assume that the absorption takes place in the bulk .    the absorption coefficient @xmath12(e ) for a particular value of incident energy e can be written as    @xmath49    where the integration is done over all the band gaps ( e@xmath50 ) of the system below the incident energy e. in equation 8 , @xmath51 is the joint density of states , f(e@xmath50 ) the oscillator strength for the optical transition and p(e@xmath50 ) the distribution of band gaps e@xmath50 in the material .",

    "i , we have already mentioned that the jdos is a constant independent of energy for @xmath1 @xmath94 e@xmath50 and zero for @xmath1 @xmath27 e@xmath50 .",
    "hence for @xmath1 @xmath27 @xmath92 , a given nanostructure contributes equally at all energies to @xmath12 .",
    "however p(e@xmath50 ) falls off as e@xmath50 increases .",
    "nanostructures having a band gap ( @xmath92 ) above a certain cut off in energy ( in the high energy tail of the distribution ) do not contribute significantly to @xmath89 ( as p(e@xmath50 ) is very small ) .",
    "this gives rise to the saturation of @xmath19 in figures 7(a ) and 7(c).this saturation is more obvious in figures 8(a ) and 8(c ) , because p(e@xmath50 ) falls off very rapidly for a lognormal distribution of sizes .",
    "these results also do not agree with the experimental data .",
    "+    the situation is not remedied even if we include higher excited states ( n@xmath47 = 2 , n@xmath48 = 1 ; etc . ) in the energy range considered in our calculation .",
    "based on the above discussion , we see that for @xmath12 to increase with @xmath1 , it is necessary to increase the contribution to @xmath12 from the nanostructures in the high energy region of @xmath19 .this is possible if the oscillator strength is enhanced for the nanostructures with large @xmath92 ( smaller sizes ) .",
    "+    we now consider the case when f(@xmath92 ) varies as @xmath95 .",
    "figure 7 ( curves ( b ) and ( d ) for case 2 and 4 in table i ) and figure 8 ( curves ( b ) and ( d ) for case 6 and 8 table i ) are plots of @xmath89 vs @xmath1 for @xmath57 = 6 . for the gaussian distribution that we have chosen",
    ", we see that the absorption still saturates although the onset of saturation moves to slightly higher energy .",
    "this is a measure of the contribution of the ( high energy ) tail of @xmath59 for the gaussian case to the total absorption . for the lognormal distibution ,",
    "we see from figure 8 ( curves ( b ) and ( d ) ) that @xmath96 vs @xmath1 now qualitatively looks like the experimental curve . +    from a comparison of figures 7 and 8",
    ", we find that in order to get the absorption co - efficient to increase with incident energy , it is important that the contributions to @xmath12 from the low energy regions of p@xmath97 do not dominate the optical absorption at large @xmath1 .",
    "this is also satisfied if the distribution of band gaps p(e@xmath98 ) is sufficiently broad .",
    "we illustrate this in fig.9 where we plot the calculated value for @xmath12 for a gaussian distribution of band gaps with the mean energy at 2.25 ev and a variance of 0.75 ev .",
    "hence we find that the nature of the band gap distribution @xmath99 plays a crucial role in determining the shape of the absorption spectrum .",
    "+    we conclude that to properly account for the optical absorption in ps we need to assume +    \\(1 ) ps is a pseudo 1d indirect band gap semiconductor .",
    "+    \\(2 ) the oscillator strength is size dependent and is given by a power law @xmath100 .",
    "+    \\(3 ) the distribution @xmath99 also plays an important role .",
    "assuming a lognormal distribution of the nanostructures diameters in porous silicon seems to naturally account for the absorption spectrum .",
    "+    all these considerations are in general agreement with results of luminescence experiments on ps .the low temperature luminescence of ps excited near the peak of the broad luminescence spectrum exhibits steps which have been associated with the characteristic to mode of c - silicon @xmath101 .",
    "more recently@xmath58 well resolved peaks corresponding to the to mode of si have been reported for luminescence of ps suggesting that ps is an indirect band gap semiconductor .",
    "the observed dominant zero phonon component of luminescence constitutes direct evidence for the enhancement of the oscillator strength due to strong quantum confinement at smaller sizes @xmath102 .",
    "+    we now comment on the validity of the procedure for obtaining the band gap of ps from @xmath0 vs @xmath1 .",
    "figure 10 is a simulated plot of @xmath0 vs @xmath1 ( case 8 in table i ) for three different values of @xmath57 and the experimental data on p type sample .",
    "first , we note that the intercept of the linear portion of each of the simulated curves is neither coincident with the peak position ( near 1.3 ev ) of the corresponding band gap distribution ( see figure 5 ) nor close to the mean band gap energy @xmath103 = 2.25 ev . so we see that it is very difficult to relate this intercept with such physical quantities .therefore , it is not obvious how to interpret the intercept with some kind effective band gap . we also note that the intercept depends on the choice of @xmath57 .",
    "we hence believe that the intercept does not have the simple interpretation of a @xmath104 @xmath105 as defined for a homogeneous system .",
    "we would like to point out that for such a heterogeneous system the gap can be interpreted only in an operational sense like e@xmath106 or e@xmath107 - depending on the value of the absorption coefficient ( after correcting for the sample porosity ) .",
    "+    finally we try to understand the temperature dependence of the band gap .",
    "to explain the rigid shift of the absorption curve with temperature ( to lower @xmath12 ) , we argue that @xmath92 of each of the nanostructures follows a relation @xmath92 ( t ) = @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the band gap at zero degree kelvin .",
    "we assume that the change of the band gap with temperature is a consequence , like in bulk semiconductors , of the electron -phonon interaction and take @xmath57 = 0.5 mev / k . in our model , changing temperature is equivalent to changing the value of c in the expression that determines the energy upshift @xmath110 .",
    "figure 11 is a plot of ln@xmath111 vs @xmath1 for three different values of c. we see that the absorption curves are rigidly shifted vertically with respect to each other @xmath44 as also seen in figure 2 .",
    "we argue that this provides a @xmath112 explanation for the observed temperature dependence of @xmath12 .",
    "in this paper we have studied the absorption in free standing thin films of ps .",

    "<S> in this paper , we report on the optical absorption in porous silicon . </S>",
    "<S> we model the absorption process assuming that porous silicon is a pseudo 1d material system having a distribution of band gaps . </S>",
    "<S> we show that in order to explain the absorption we specifically need to invoke - ( a ) k is not conserved in optical transitions , ( b ) the oscillator strength of these transitions depend on the size of the nanostructure in which absorption takes place and ( c ) the distribution of band gaps significantly influences the optical absorption . we also show that it is not possible to extract the band gap of porous silicon from a plot of @xmath0 vs @xmath1 .    0.2 cm 10.5 cm @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4 </S>"
