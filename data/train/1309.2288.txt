    "comet ison ( c/2012 s1 ) was discovered on 2012 september 21 and will reach perihelion on 2013 november 28 at a sungrazing distance of 0.0125 @xmath2 solar radii ( @xmath3 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the lead time of more than one year from discovery until perihelion is unique in sungrazing comet history and allows unprecedented planning of ground- and space - based resources in order to maximize the scientific return . while ison s orbit is well known , the likely result of its perihelion passage is not , prompting this @xmath4 .",
    "understanding the possible outcomes for the comet s response to such a close passage by the sun is important for a variety of reasons .",
    "first , ison is much better placed for earth - based observations post - perihelion than pre - perihelion , so most intensive observational campaigns are planned for after perihelion . if ison is unlikely to survive then all efforts should be made to obtain data prior to perihelion .",
    "second , ison is expected to be observable by the fleet of space - based solar observatories , most of whom have limited real - time flexibility in their observations ; early predictions of ison s behavior will help them optimize their observing sequences .",
    "third , it has recently become possible to use comets as probes of the solar environment @xcite .",
    "these studies require basic assumptions about the physical nature of the comet ; in order to properly interpret these data it is critical to understand whether ison behaves differently than the two previous comets utilized in this manner .",
    "as detailed in the remainder of section  [ sec : intro ] , there are numerous studies of tidal encounters of comets and asteroids with planetary bodies , and a historical track record of sungrazing comets being destroyed by disintegration and/or disruption .",
    "we use these as a guide and conduct numerical simulations of ison s perihelion encounter in section  [ sec : sims ] .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : disc ] we interpret these simulations and make reasonable assumptions about ison s nuclear properties in order to determine the range of likely outcomes and the comet s chances of surviving perihelion .",
    "disruptions of solar system bodies due to tidal forces can be spectacular , with comet shoemaker - levy 9 ( henceforth sl9 ) a prime example .",
    "while @xcite theorized about the disruption of fluid bodies on circular orbits with synchronized spin states , sl9 and other recent discoveries have motivated more sophisticated studies of different types of encounters and more realistic models of internal structure .",
    "oort cloud comets typically have nearly parabolic encounters with the sun , which is a vastly different geometry than that envisioned by roche ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , a large body of work based on decades of observations and numerical simulations has painted a picture of small solar system bodies as `` rubble piles , '' again vastly different than the liquids considered by roche or chandresekhar ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "these gravitationally bound bodies are typically assumed to have zero or possibly very limited tensile strength , and therefore may rely only on their self - gravity to bind them and the shear strength afforded by their building blocks physical sizes to resist re - shaping .",
    "in fact , it was the breakup of comet ikeya - seki in 1965 ( @xcite and references therein ) during its sungrazing passage that prompted @xcite to suggest that it may have been a `` heap of rubble . ''",
    "prior to the discovery of sl9 , work was underway to extend the calculations of roche to a more diverse set of circumstances .",
    "@xcite used smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations to model inviscid planetesimals passing close to earth , finding that the increase of the planetesimal s spin angular momentum during the encounter can induce equatorial mass - shedding .",
    "@xcite extended the analytical work into the regime of viscous - fluid bodies having parabolic encounters with a planet , finding that mass shedding begins at @xmath069% of the classical roche limit in this scenario .",
    "the discovery of sl9 in 1993 launched significant numerical modeling efforts of tidal disruption outcomes .",
    "specifically , @xmath5-body gravitational codes were employed to model gravitationally bound `` rubble pile '' bodies constituent pieces . in seeking a match to the precise morphology",
    "observed in the sl9 fragment chain , @xcite identified many important and challenging degeneracies in the tidal breakup process . while the `` strength '' of the breakup increased with decreasing density and increasing prograde spin rate , the trade off between density and spin rate was very clean ",
    "there is no simple way to break that degeneracy .",
    "@xcite went further and explored the effects of shape during a tidal encounter , finding that elongated bodies can disrupt even more violently , but in a manner that is very dependent on the orientation of their long axis at the time of close approach .",
    "recent work for the sl9 disruption has found that using non - spherical particles for the rubble pile progenitor frustrates disruption somewhat @xcite , suggesting that hard spherical particle models ( as presented here ) may represent an upper limit for disruption parameters .",
    "however , there are numerous examples of cometary breakups that do not fit neatly into any of the previous `` rubble pile '' models , including nearly all of those that suffered disruption far from perihelion or any other known perturbations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these events remind us that while models might predict only a modest re - shaping or very weak tidal forces acting across a body , it might only need to `` light a fuse '' inside a comet leading to a later disruption .",
    "there are substantial uncertainties in modeling a cometary disruption near the sun .",
    "specifically , the extensive modeling of the sl9 event presented in @xcite inferred very low or zero tensile strength to best explain the observations , but @xcite demonstrated that even very small amounts of tensile strength can have a dramatic effect on disruption limits , especially at @xmath0 km sizes . while tensile strength is very hard to measure , it was inferred for 9p / tempel 1 from the deep impact experiment as being considerably weaker than heavily fractured ice , but non - zero @xcite .",
    "however , given the extremely high evaporation rates during perihelion , there are other forces that may exceed any small values of tensile strength .",
    "an example demonstrated by @xcite finds that the forces created during the outgassing of ices on a sungrazing comet may be strong enough that the reaction force on the nucleus delays or prevents tidal splitting .",
    "complications aside , for ison s perihelion distance , the classical roche limit predicts mass loss for densities @xmath61.03  g  @xmath1 , while @xcite predicts mass loss for densities @xmath60.34  g  @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite predicts mass loss for densities @xmath60.13  g  @xmath1 for a non - spinning spherical cohesionless rubble pile with a 40@xmath7 angle of friction , while a similar body with a lower angle of friction ( 20@xmath7 ) would only need a density @xmath60.27  g  @xmath1 .",
    "though `` disruption '' is defined differently in each work , all estimated comet densities have been @xmath61.0 g @xmath1 @xcite , so ison clearly warrants further investigation .",
    "historically , the term `` sungrazing '' was applied exclusively to members of the kreutz family ( @xcite ; discussed below ) .",
    "solar and heliospheric observatory ( soho ) _ began discovering non - kreutz comets in small - perihelion distance ( @xmath8 ) orbits , `` sungrazing '' and `` sunskirting '' began to be used to distinguish the kreutz from the larger-@xmath8 near - sun comets , but without being formally defined .",
    "rather than dividing at some arbitrary distance , we propose to give it a physical basis by using the roche limit , which can be calculated easily if one measures the comet s density or can safely assume a nominal value .",
    "this limit distinguishes between comets that may suffer tidally driven mass loss ( sungrazers ) from those that will not ( sunskirters ) . with this definition , the only ground - observed comets classified as sungrazers that are not kreutz comets are c/1680 v1 and ison @xcite .",
    "observational constraints on the behavior of sungrazing comets near perihelion come entirely from the well known kreutz group .",
    "kreutz comets have @xmath92 @xmath3 and orbital periods of 5001000 yr .",
    "they are dynamically linked to a single progenitor , with the members having been produced by cascading fragmentation over several orbits ( cf .",
    "the group consists of a smattering of naked - eye comets seen over several centuries plus a nearly continuous stream of faint comets observed only with space - based coronagraphs .",
    "the coronagraphically discovered kreutz comets do not survive perihelion ; in fact , they typically peak in brightness at 1015 @xmath3 then rapidly fade @xcite .",
    "four kreutz comets ",
    "c1 , c/1887 b1 , c/1945 x1 , and c/2011 w3 ( lovejoy )  survived until or shortly after perihelion , often appearing as headless tails receding from the sun , while five ",
    "c/1843 d1 , c/1882 r1 , c/1963 r1 , c/1965 s1 ( ikeya - seki ) , and c/1970 k1  clearly survived @xcite .",
    "other than c/1970",
    "k1 , all that clearly survived were observed to split during the perihelion passage , with at least one substantial remnant surviving and exhibiting cometary behavior for an extended time .",
    "thus , the kreutz comets demonstrate the range of outcomes that may befall ison .",
    "the smallest comets , consistently estimated to be @xmath60.2 km in radius ( e.g. , @xcite ) succumb to sublimation driven mass loss prior to perihelion .",
    "intermediate sized comets , 0.21.0 km in radius , are large enough to survive mass loss due to sublimation @xcite , but likely disrupt with no individual fragment sufficiently large to remain a viable comet significantly beyond perihelion .",
    "the largest comets ( radius @xmath101 km ) easily survive mass loss due to sublimation alone and , even if they fragment , remain viable comets that will return on a subsequent perihelion passage .      despite its sungrazing orbit ,",
    "ison is not a member of the kreutz group ; it is a `` dynamically new '' comet entering the solar system for the first time ( as evidenced by its reciprocal original semi - major axis of 7@xmath1110@xmath12",
    "au@xmath13 ) , whereas the kreutz comets have made at least several sungrazing orbits over the last few thousand years .",
    "there are expected to be differences in the outer layers of dynamically new comets as compared to returning comets due to the former s long residence in the oort cloud ( cf .",
    "while we use the kreutz comets as a guide out of necessity , this differing evolutionary history may result in compositional or structural differences that affect ison s survivability .    as discussed in the preceding subsection , the first criterion for ison to survive perihelion is its nuclear size .",
    "hubble space telescope ( hst ) observations set an upper limit on the radius of @xmath02 km @xcite .",
    "we estimate the minimum radius to be @xmath00.4 km using the only published gas measurements @xcite and following the methodology of @xcite ( using m. ahearn s web - based calculator ) .",
    "similar calculations using the estimated production rates of co or co@xmath14 from spitzer space telescope images @xcite and upper limits of co from hst spectroscopy ( m. ahearn , private comm . )",
    "yield minimum radius estimates of 0.10.3 km .",
    "this range of possible nuclear sizes suggests that , based on the behavior of kreutz comets , ison is likely large enough to survive mass loss due to sublimation alone , but not necessarily so large that some fragment(s ) would reasonably be expected to remain viable if the nucleus disrupts .",
    "note that ison s perihelion distance is slightly larger than that of the kreutz family so it will likely suffer less sublimation driven mass loss ; however , for simplicity we assume it has the same survival thresholds . therefore , in order to estimate ison s chances of survival , we need to investigate its susceptibility to tidal disruption .",
    "the history of cometary disruption and fragmentation is strongly suggestive of forces beyond gravity playing a significant role ( e.g. , c/1999 s4 linear , 73p / schwassman - wachmann 3 ) .",
    "however , we aim to build a baseline for the expected behavior of ison during its perihelion passage strictly due to the tidal forces . from this baseline , with historical perspective and the best possible estimates of important unknown variables , we make a prediction about its behavior at , and immediately following , perihelion .",
    "@xcite explored a range of shape and spin combinations and a wide range of close encounter distances and hyperbolic encounter characteristics for close passages of rubble - pile asteroids to the earth . here",
    ", the encounter parameters are known with significant accuracy , and the encounter is nearly parabolic . given that this specific encounter is of great interest , and velocity at infinity @xmath15  km  s@xmath13 ( e.g. , a comet arriving from the oort cloud ) was not explicitly tested in @xcite , we endeavor to explore more deeply the possible outcomes for @xmath16 @xmath3 and @xmath17  km  s@xmath13 , focusing on the effects of internal density , spin , and shape of the body .",
    "our simulations were designed to test a parabolic flyby of a gravitational aggregate , and used the @xmath5-body code pkdgrav @xcite .",
    "the progenitor bodies were constructed of @xmath02000 hard spherical particles that were initially in a close - packed configuration .",
    "the encounters were started at 10 @xmath3 and continued until the re - accumulation of fragments was considered to be complete  typically 10,00020,000 timesteps , each of @xmath050  s. starting the simulations earlier or running them later has no effect on the results @xcite .",
    "as will be described below , bulk densities were explored in the range of 0.0750.8  g  @xmath1 , and two shapes were explored , a sphere and a body with 2:1:1 axis ratios rotating uniformly around its short axis ( the elongated body is near the extreme axis ratios observed for comets and should represent an end - member case of all the possible shapes ) .",
    "the rotation rate selected for the prograde encounters was taken to be 50% of the critical rotation rate ( the rate at which mass begins to be lost due to centrifugal acceleration ) , following the simplistic formulation @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the rotation period corresponding to the critical rotation rate , @xmath20 is the density of the body in g  @xmath1 , and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the long and intermediate axis lengths respectively ( using the same notation as in @xcite ) . while the selection of this rotation rate was somewhat arbitrary , much more rapid rotation would dramatically increase the chances of disruption and such fast rotation rates are rare among comets .",
    "thus for a spherical body ( @xmath23 ) with @xmath24 g  @xmath1 , @xmath25  hr . for the same densities but an elongated body ( @xmath26 ) the rotation periods were a factor of @xmath27 longer .    for the baseline simulations with non - rotating ( which is akin to a very long rotation period in these simulations ) or prograde rotating spherical bodies , 10 simulations for each density were run to account for any geometry inherent in the close - packed configuration of the progenitor rubble pile . for the cases with an elongated body , we tested 30 different encounters because of the substantial changes in outcome depending on the alignment of the body s long axis at perihelion .",
    "disruption is more likely if the spin angular momentum is aligned with the encounter angular momentum @xcite , though as the spin rate decreases this becomes less important .",
    "elongation is less important in the non - spinning case and so only spherical bodies were tested .",
    "no cases of retrograde rotators were tested as they are less likely to disrupt than non - spinning cases @xcite , and the results below show non - spinning as a very unlikely disruption scenario .",
    "the results of these simulations are presented in figure  [ fig : mlr ] , which shows the fraction , @xmath28 , of simulations in which mass loss exceeded 2% , 50% , and 80% of the total mass of the progenitor for each of the tested bulk density values . a conservative estimate of survival is given by @xmath29 , while @xmath30 depicts catastrophic disruptions . for bodies with initially no rotation ,",
    "there is a sharp increase in the degree of the disruption as seen by the increasing @xmath28 for densities @xmath60.15  g  @xmath1 .",
    "the disruptions begin at higher densities for the bodies with prograde rotation , with disruptions beginning at 0.3  g  @xmath1 in the spherical case .",
    "elongated bodies with prograde rotation , the extreme case tested , experience mass loss even earlier , with some bodies at densities up to 0.7  g  @xmath1 disrupting .",
    "the cases with elongation had nearly bi - modal results , with either no mass - loss or dramatic mass loss due to the importance of the long - axis location at perihelion @xcite .",
    "disruption did not occur in any simulations in which the density was @xmath100.7  g  @xmath1 .",
    "the first three columns of table  [ t : parameters ] give the nuclear parameters that affect survival , their considered ranges , and a qualitative description of their effect on survivability .",
    "we specifically tested a range of density , axis ratio , and sense of rotation .",
    "the simulations are scale invariant , and thus can be translated to any pre - encounter nuclear size , so in effect radius has also been sampled ( noting that the largest remnant needs to be @xmath310.1 km at perihelion to survive the remainder of the apparition ) . therefore , the only parameter not specifically tested is rotation period , which has a well understood degeneracy with density @xcite .",
    "rotation periods potentially span a tremendous range that , if fully explored , would have been too cpu - intensive for the current @xmath4 .",
    "the effect of rotation period can , however , be visualized in figure  [ fig : mlr ] by shifting the curves up and to the right for shorter prograde rotation periods ( mass loss due to tidal forces results at larger densities ) or down and to the left for longer prograde , or any retrograde , rotation periods ( mass loss due to tidal forces only occurs at very low densities ) .    the last column in table  [ t : parameters ] gives the likely range of values for each parameter for ison . while radius ( discussed in ",
    "[ sec : introison ] ) and sense of rotation ( retrograde ; provided by t. farnham based on the pole orientation from @xcite ) are partially constrained by published observations , the rest are not .",
    "comet nuclear properties are notoriously difficult to measure , and the properties of dynamically new comets like ison are almost completely unconstrained . therefore , the ranges of the remaining parameters cover the known values of all comets as compiled from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and our own literature search for more recent publications .",
    "ison appears likely to survive the combination of mass loss due to sublimation and tidal disruption for most plausible scenarios .",
    "if it is `` typical ''  radius @xmath01 km , density @xmath00.5  g  @xmath1 , axis ratio @xmath01 , rotation period @xmath024 hr , and a random sense of rotation ( or retrograde as the preliminary results suggest )  it is very likely to survive the encounter . given that comet densities are relatively well constrained to be near @xmath00.5  g  @xmath1 , the rotation period is the parameter whose plausible range poses the largest threat to ison s ability to survive perihelion . for a density of @xmath00.5  g  @xmath1 ,",
    "ison would lose mass for many scenarios in which the rotation period was prograde and faster than @xmath09 hr , with tidally driven mass loss increasing as rotation period decreases .",
    "roughly 30% of measured comet rotation periods are @xmath69 hr , although this is likely overestimated because shorter rotation periods are easier to measure .",
    "furthermore , assuming that sense of rotation is random , half of these fast rotators would be retrograde and therefore unlikely to disrupt .",
    "as of 2013 august , none of the parameters in our simulations have been tightly constrained for ison , although some ( most likely rotation period and/or pole orientation ) may yet be determined prior to perihelion . however , even if these quantities are constrained , @xcite showed that ison s rotation is likely to be highly excited near perihelion so values determined at larger heliocentric distances may not hold through perihelion , and mass loss due to spin - up may occur .",
    "further investigations of this possibility are beyond the scope of this @xmath4",
    ". also beyond the scope are the effects of sublimation driven mass loss during the encounter , although we do not expect it to alter our results substantially .",
    "we hope that observations around and after perihelion may yield enough information to infer many of these parameters and therefore conclusively determine ison s susceptibility ( or lack thereof ) to tidal disruption .",
    "furthermore , the current work should serve as a guide for studies after perihelion to estimate ison s density based on measurable quantities and the results of the perihelion passage .",
