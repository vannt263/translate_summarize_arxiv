    "in this paper , we extend the so called dual estimate of  @xcite to the obstacle problem for quasilinear elliptic equations in the heisenberg group .",
    "the notation we use is the standard one : for  @xmath5 , we consider  @xmath6 endowed with the group law @xmath7 for any  @xmath8 , @xmath9 , where the `` @xmath10 '' is the standard euclidean scalar product .",
    "then , we denote by  @xmath11 the  @xmath12-dimensional heisenberg group , i.e. ,  @xmath6 endowed with this group law .",
    "the coordinates are usually written as  @xmath13 , and , as customary , we introduce the left invariant vector fields  @xmath14 induced by the group law @xmath15 for  @xmath16 , and the horizontal gradient  @xmath17 .",
    "the main issue of the heisenberg group is that  @xmath18 and @xmath19 do not commute , that is @xmath20=4\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\neq 0.\\ ] ] we are interested in studying the obstacle problem in this framework . for this , we consider a smooth function  @xmath21 , which will be our obstacle ( more precisely ,  @xmath3 is supposed to have continuous derivatives of second order in  @xmath18 and  @xmath19 ) .    fixed a bounded open set  @xmath22 with smooth boundary , and  @xmath23 , we consider the space  @xmath24 to be the set of all functions  @xmath25 in  @xmath26 whose distributional horizontal derivatives  @xmath27 and  @xmath28 belong to  @xmath26 , for  @xmath16 .",
    "such space is naturally endowed with the norm @xmath29 we call  @xmath30 the closure of  @xmath31 with respect to this norm",
    ".    we fix a smooth domain  @xmath32 , @xmath33 and we introduce the space @xmath34 loosely speaking ,  @xmath35 is the space of all the functions having prescribed dirichlet boundary datum equal to  @xmath36 along  @xmath37 and that stay below the obstacle  @xmath3 .",
    "now we consider a parameter  @xmath0 and we deal with the variational problem @xmath38 by direct methods , it is seen that such infimum is attained ( see , e.g. , the compactness result in  @xcite or references therein ) and so we consider a minimizer  @xmath1 .    then ,  @xmath1 is a solution of the variational inequality with  @xmath39 , and  @xmath40 , for any  @xmath41 , let  @xmath42 .",
    "notice that @xmath43 hence  @xmath44 .",
    "so , by the minimality of  @xmath1 , we have  @xmath45 for any  @xmath41 .",
    "consequently , @xmath46 that is  . ]",
    "@xmath47 for any  @xmath48 with  @xmath39 , and  @xmath40 .",
    "these kind of variational inequalities has now receiving a considerable attention ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite and references therein ) , even when @xmath49 ( notice that in such a case  @xmath50 does not play any role ) .",
    "we observe that , when  @xmath51 , the operator driving the variational inequality in   is not linear anymore ( in fact , it may be seen as the heisenberg group version of the @xmath52-laplace operator ) : for these kind of operators even the regularity theory is more problematic than expected at a first glance , and many basic fundamental questions are still open ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and  @xcite ) : this is a crucial difference with respect to the euclidean case , so we think it is worth dealing with the problem in such a generality .",
    "now , we introduce the set of  @xmath52 s for which our main result holds .",
    "the definition we give is slightly technical , but , roughly speaking , consists in taking the set of all the @xmath52 s for which a pointwise bound for the operator of a sequence of minimal solutions is stable under uniform limit .",
    "the further difficulty of taking this assumption is due to the lack of a thoroughgoing regularity theory for the quasilinear heisenberg equation ( as remarked in lemma  [ p2p ] at the end of this paper , this technicality may be skipped when  @xmath49 ) .",
    "[ d ] let  @xmath53 .",

    "] in lemma  [ p2p ] at the end of this paper , we always have that @xmath68 in particular , the main result of this paper ( i.e. , the forthcoming theorem  [ 1 ] ) always holds for  @xmath49 without any further restriction .",
    "we think that it is an interesting open problem to decide whether or not other values of  @xmath52 belong to  @xmath69 , in general , or at least when the right hand side of   is close to zero ( e.g. , when the obstacle is almost flat ) .",
    "for instance , the property in definition  [ d ] would be satisfied in presence of a hlder regularity theory for the horizontal gradient for solutions of quasilinear equations in the heisenberg group  namely , if one knew that bounded solutions of  @xmath70 , with  @xmath71 bounded , have hlder continuous horizontal gradient , with interior estimates ( this would be the heisenberg counterpart of classical regularity results for the euclidean case , see , e.g. , theorem  1 in  @xcite ; notice also that it would be a regularity theory for the equation , not for the obstacle problem ) . as far as we know , such a theory has not been developed yet , not even for minimal solutions ( see , however ,  @xcite for the case of homogeneous equations ) .",
    "the result we prove here is :    [ 1 ] if  @xmath54 then @xmath72    the result in theorem  [ 1 ] is quite intuitive : when  @xmath1 does not touch the obstacle , it is free to make the operator vanish .",
    "when it touches and sticks to it , the operator is driven by the one of the obstacle  and on these touching points the obstacle has to bend in a somewhat convex fashion , which justifies the first inequality in   and superscript  `` @xmath73 '' in the right hand side of  .    figure  1 , in which the thick curve represents the touching between  @xmath1 and the obstacle , tries to describe this phenomena .",
    "on the other hand , the set in which  @xmath1 touches the obstacle may be very wild , so the actual proof of theorem  [ 1 ] needs to me more technical than this .",
    "in fact , the first inequality of   is quite obvious since it follows , for instance , by taking  @xmath74 in  , with an arbitrary  @xmath75 ) , so the core of   lies on the second inequality : nevertheless , we think it is useful to write   in this way to emphasize a control from both the sides of the operator applied to the solution .",
    "we remark that the right hand side of   is always finite when  @xmath55 , and when  @xmath76 and  @xmath77 . in this case ,   is an  @xmath78-bound and may be seen as a regularity result for the solution of the obstacle problem .",
    "it is worth noticing that such regularity result holds for  @xmath76 as well , only assuming that  @xmath79 , which is a requirement on the problem when  @xmath55 .    on the other hand ,",
    "if  @xmath76 and  @xmath80 , the right hand side of   may become infinite ( in this case   is true , but meaningless , stating that something is less than or equal to an infinite quantity ) .",
    "[ fig 1 ]    in the euclidean setting , the analogue of   was first obtained in  @xcite for the laplacian case , and it is therefore often referred to with the name of lewy - stampacchia estimate .",
    "it is also called dual estimate , for it is , in a sense , obtained by the duality expressed by the variational inequality  .",
    "other authors refer to it with the name of penalization method , for the role played by  @xmath50 .",
    "after  @xcite , estimates of these type became very popular and underwent many important extensions and strengthenings : see , among the others ,  @xcite .",
    "as far as we know , the estimate we prove is new in the heisenberg group setting , even for  @xmath49 .",
    "hereafter , we deal with the proof of theorem  [ 1 ] . first , in    [ s1 ] , we prove theorem  [ 1 ] when  @xmath55 .",
    "the proof when  @xmath76 is contained in    [ s3 ] and it is based on a limit argument , i.e. , we consider the problem with  @xmath55 , we use theorem  [ 1 ] in such a case , and then we pass  @xmath81 . this procedure is quite delicate though , because , as far as we know , it is not clear whether or not the heisenberg group setting allows a complete hlder regularity theory for first derivatives ( see  @xcite ) . to get around this point , in",

    "we prove   in the simpler case  @xmath55 ( the case  @xmath76 will be dealt with in    [ s3 ] ) .",
