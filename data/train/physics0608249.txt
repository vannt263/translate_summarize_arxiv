    "in the analysis of sparsely populated spectra common approximations , valid only for large numbers , fail for the small number of events encountered .",
    "a bayesian analysis of the probability of a signal in the presence of background is developed , and criteria are proposed for claiming evidence for , or the discovery of a signal . it is independent of the physics case and can be applied to a variety of situations .    to make predictions about possible outcomes of an experiment ,",
    "distributions of quantities under study are calculated . as an approximation , ensembles , sets of monte carlo data which mimic the expected spectrum ,",
    "are randomly generated and analyzed .",
    "the frequency distributions of output parameters of the bayesian analysis are interpreted as probability densities and are used to evaluate the sensitivity of the experiment to the process under study .    as an example , the analysis method is used to estimate the sensitivity of the gerda experiment  @xcite to neutrinoless double beta decay .    the analysis strategy is introduced in section  [ section : analysis ] .",
    "the generation of ensembles and the application of the method onto those is discussed in section  [ section : ensembletests ] .",
    "the application of the analysis method in the gerda experiment is given as an example in section  [ section : sensitivity ] where the sensitivity of the experiment is evaluated .",
    "a common situation in the analysis of data is the following : two types of processes ( referred to as signal and background in the following ) potentially contribute to a measured spectrum .",
    "the basic questions which are to be answered can be phrased as : _ what is the contribution of the signal process to the observed spectrum ?",
    "what is the probability that the spectrum is due to background only ? given a model for the signal and background , what is the ( most probable ) parameter value describing the number of signal events in the spectrum ? in case no signal is observed , what is the limit that can be set on the signal contribution ? _ the analysis method introduced in this paper is based on bayes theorem and developed to answer these questions and is in particular suitable for spectra with a small number of events .",
    "the assumptions for the analysis are    * the spectrum is confined to a certain region of interest . *",
    "the spectral shape of a possible signal is known . *",
    "the spectral shape of the background is known . *",
    "the spectrum is divided into bins and the event numbers in the bins follow poisson distributions .",
    "the analysis consists of two steps .",
    "first , the probability that the observed spectrum is due to background only is calculated . if this probability is less then an _ a priori _ defined value , the discovery ( or evidence ) criterion , the signal process is assumed to contribute to the spectrum and a discovery ( or evidence ) is claimed .",
    "if the process is known to exist , this step is skipped .",
    "based on the outcome , in a second step the signal contribution is either estimated or an upper limit for the signal contribution is calculated .      in the following , @xmath0 denotes the hypothesis that the observed spectrum is due to background only ; the negation , interpreted here as the hypothesis that the signal process contributes to the spectrum , is labeled @xmath1 .",
    "the conditional probabilities for the hypotheses @xmath0 and @xmath1 to be true or not , given the measured spectrum are labeled @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "they obey the following relation : @xmath4    the conditional probabilities for @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be calculated using bayes theorem  @xcite : @xmath5    and @xmath6    where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the conditional probabilities to find the observed spectrum given that the hypothesis @xmath0 is true or not true , respectively and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the prior probabilities for @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the values of @xmath9 and @xmath10 are chosen depending on additional information , @xmath11 , such as existing knowledge from previous experiments and model predictions . in the following , the symbol @xmath11 is dropped but it should be understood that all available information is used in the evaluation of probabilities . the probability @xmath12 is rewritten as @xmath13",
    "the probabilities @xmath7 and @xmath8 can be decomposed in terms of the expected number of signal events , @xmath14 , and the expected number of background events , @xmath15 : @xmath16    where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the conditional probabilities to obtain the measured spectrum .",
    "further , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the prior probabilities for the number of signal and background events , respectively .",
    "they are assumed to be uncorrelated , and are chosen depending on the knowledge from previous experiments , supporting measurements and models .",
    "the _ observed _ number of events in the @xmath21th bin of the spectrum is denoted @xmath22 . assuming the fluctuations in the bins of the spectrum to be uncorrelated the probability to observe the measured spectrum , given @xmath15 ( in case @xmath0 is true ) or the set @xmath14 , @xmath15 ( in case @xmath1 is true ) ,",
    "is simply the product of the probabilities to observe the @xmath23 values , @xmath24 .",
    "the _ expected _ number of events in the @xmath21th bin , @xmath25 , can be expressed in terms of @xmath14 and @xmath15 : @xmath26    where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the normalized shapes of the known signal and background spectra , respectively , and @xmath29 is the width of the @xmath21th bin .",
    "the letter @xmath30 suggests an energy bin , but the binning can be performed in any quantity of interest .",
    "the number of events in each bin can fluctuate around @xmath25 according to a poisson distribution .",
    "this yields @xmath31    in summary , the probability for @xmath0 to be true , given the measured spectrum , is : = 0.pt @xmath32_{s=0 } \\cdot p_{0}(h ) } { \\left [ \\int \\prod   \\frac{\\lambda_i^{n_{i}}}{n_{i } ! } e^{-\\lambda_i } \\cdot p_{0}(b)~db\\right ] _",

    "evidence for a signal or a discovery can be decided based on the resulting value for @xmath2 .",
    "it should be emphasized that the discovery criterion has to be chosen _ before _ the data is analyzed .",
    "a value of @xmath34 is proposed for the _ discovery _ criterion , whereas a value of @xmath35 can be considered to give _ evidence _ for @xmath1 .",
    "the analysis can be easily extended to include uncertainties in the knowledge of relevant quantities .",
    "for example , if the spectrum is plotted as a function of energy , and the energy scale has an uncertainty , then equations  ( [ eqn : pbn],[eqn : psn ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath36 p_0(k ) dk \\\\",
    "p(\\textrm{spectrum}|s,~b ) & = & \\int \\left [ \\prod_{i = 1}^{n } \\frac{\\lambda_{i}(s,~b|k)^{n_{i}}}{n_{i } ! } e^{-\\lambda_{i}(s,~b|k)}\\right ] p_0(k ) dk\\ . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath37 is the expected number of events for a given energy scale factor @xmath38 and @xmath39 is the probability density for @xmath38 ( e.g. , a gaussian distribution centered on @xmath40 ) .      in case",
    "the spectrum fulfills the requirement of evidence or discovery , the number of signal events can be estimated from the data .",
    "the probability that the observed spectrum can be explained by the set of parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 , making again use of bayes theorem , is : @xmath41    in order to estimate the signal contribution the probability @xmath42 is marginalized with respect to @xmath15 : @xmath43    the mode of this distribution , @xmath44 , i.e. , the value of @xmath14 which maximizes @xmath45 , can be used as an estimator for the signal contribution .",
    "the standard uncertainty on @xmath14 can be evaluated from @xmath46 such that the results can be quoted as @xmath47      in case the requirement for an observation of the signal process is not fulfilled an upper limit on the number of signal events is calculated .",
    "for example , a 90% probability lower limit is calculated by integrating equation  ( [ eqn : psspectrum ] ) to 90% probability : @xmath48    @xmath49 is the 90% probability upper limit on the number of signal events .",
    "it should be noted that in this case it is assumed that @xmath1 is true but the signal process is too weak to significantly contribute to the spectrum .",
    "in order to predict the outcome of an experiment distributions of the quantities under study can be calculated .",
    "this is done numerically by generating possible spectra and subsequently analyzing these .",
    "the spectra are typically generated from monte carlo simulations of signal and background events .",
    "for a given ensemble , the number of signal and background events , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are fixed and a random number of events are collected according to poisson distributions with means @xmath52 and @xmath53 . from each ensemble",
    "a spectrum is extracted and the analysis described above is applied .",
    "the analysis chain is shown in figure  [ fig : chain ] .",
    "the output parameters , such as the conditional probability for @xmath0 , @xmath2 , are histogrammed and the frequency distribution is interpreted as the probability density for the parameter under study . as examples , the mean value and the 16%  to  84% probability intervals can be deduced and used to predict the outcome of the experiment .",
    "this approach is referred to as ensemble tests .",
    "systematic uncertainties , such as the influence of energy resolution , miscalibration or signal and background efficiencies , can be estimated by analyzing ensembles which are generated under different assumptions .",
    "in the following , the gerda experiment is introduced and the bayesian analysis method , developed in section  [ section : analysis ] , is applied on monte carlo data in order to predict possible outcomes of the experiment .      the germanium detector array , gerda  @xcite , is a new experiment to search for neutrinoless double beta decay ( 0@xmath54 ) of the germanium isotope @xmath55ge .",

    "a positive claim was given by parts of the heidelberg - moscow collaboration with a @xmath58 range of @xmath59  years and a best value of @xmath60  years  @xcite .",
    "+ a total exposure ( measured in kg@xmath61years of operating the germanium diodes ) of at least 100  kg@xmath61years should be collected during the run - time of the gerda experiment .",
    "the germanium diodes are enriched in the isotope @xmath55ge to a level of about 86% .",
    "one of the most ambitious goals of the experiment is the envisioned background level of @xmath62  counts/(kg@xmath61kev@xmath61y ) .",
    "this is two orders of magnitude below the background index observed in previous experiments  @xcite . for an exposure of 100  kg@xmath61years",
    "the expected number of background events in the 100 kev wide region of interest is approximately 10 . using the present best limit on the half - life less than 20 @xmath63-events",
    "are expected within a much smaller window .",
    "the number of expected @xmath63-events , @xmath50 , is correlated with the half - life of the process via @xmath64    where @xmath65 is the enrichment factor , @xmath66 is the mass of germanium in grams , @xmath67 is avogadro s constant and @xmath68 is the measuring time .",
    "@xmath69 is the atomic mass and @xmath70 is the signal efficiency , estimated from monte carlo data to be 87% .      in gerda , the energy spectrum in the region around 2  mev is expected to be populated by events from various background processes .",
