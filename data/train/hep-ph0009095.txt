    "the pion decay rates of the excited charmed mesons - the @xmath1 mesons - may provide direct information on the strength of the pion coupling to light constituent quarks .",
    "as the charm quark in the @xmath1 mesons does not couple to pions , the decay mechanism is determined by the pion coupling to the light flavor constituent quark .",
    "a first assumption is that this coupling is independent of the interaction between the light quark ( or antiquark ) and the charmed antiquark ( or quark ) .",
    "while this may be considered as a satisfactory approximation for the axial current part of the pion - quark coupling , it leads to large overestimates of the decay widths in the case of the axial charge term , a problem that may be cured by the two - quark mechanism that is associated with the confining interaction between the light and charmed quark in the @xmath10 @xmath11 system .    because of the large velocities of the confined quarks in @xmath1 mesons , and in view of the small mass of the light constituent quarks , the @xmath1 mesons have to be described as relativistic interacting two - particle systems . the simplest way to achieve such",
    "a description is to employ a covariant three dimensional reduction of the bethe - salpeter equation and a corresponding quasipotential representation of the interaction between the constituents .",
    "the hitherto considered quasipotential descriptions for the @xmath1 mesons are based on the gross  @xcite and the blankenbecler - sugar equations  @xcite .",
    "both approaches have been shown to yield reasonable predictions for the @xmath1 meson spectrum with combinations of linear confining and one - gluon exchange interactions between the quark and antiquark  @xcite .    this dynamical model , with static interactions in the @xmath12 system applied in the solution of the gross equation ,",
    "has recently been used to calculate the pseudoscalar meson decay rates of the @xmath1 mesons  @xcite .",
    "a fair description of the decay rates of the @xmath2 mesons was achieved , under the assumption that the pions couple to the light constituent quarks by the standard ( pseudovector ) coupling . on the other hand ,",
    "the ratio of the widths of the @xmath13 and the @xmath14 mesons was found to be @xmath15 2.5 , while the empirical ratio is @xmath16 . in view of the importance of determining the form and strength of the pion - quark coupling , an analogous calculation within the framework of the blankenbecler - sugar equation",
    "is performed here .",
    "there is no obvious reason for preferring one or the other quasipotential framework , besides that of calculational convenience .",
    "the gross equation framework has the virtue of reducing to a dirac equation for the light quark in the infinite mass limit of the heavy ( charm ) quark .",
    "the blankenbecler - sugar equation has an interpretational advantage in its formal similarity to the standard schrdinger equation framework .    to calculate the pion decay rates of the excited @xmath1 mesons , the wavefunctions that have been obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite by solving the blankenbecler - sugar equation in configuration space are employed in order to achieve a description of the states in the @xmath1 meson spectrum .",
    "these wavefunctions correspond to a model which describes the interaction in the @xmath12 system as a scalar linear confining interaction combined with a screened relativistic one - gluon exchange interaction , which yields a spectrum that agrees with the empirically known part of the spectrum .",
    "the model leads to hyperfine splittings that agree well with recent nrqcd lattice calculations in the quenched approximation  @xcite .",
    "the rates for the decays of the form @xmath17 are then obtained by calculating the matrix elements of the pion creation operator between the excited and ground states using such wave functions .",
    "because of the small mass of the light flavor quark , which couples to the pions , the non - local structure of the pseudoscalar coupling of the pion to the quark has to be treated in unapproximated form . the static ( local ) approximation to this vertex function",
    "is shown to imply an overestimate by about a factor 2 .",
    "the present empirical information on the widths of the excited charm mesons remains very incomplete .",
    "absolute values , with large uncertainty ranges , are known for the decay widths of the @xmath14 and @xmath13 mesons , but for the @xmath18 and the @xmath19 only upper limits are available at present  @xcite .",
    "the pion decays of the @xmath2 mesons to @xmath1 mesons are @xmath20wave decays generated by the axial current operator . if the pion is assumed to be emitted by a single quark operator with the conventional value for the pion - quark coupling constant , the calculated widths for the decays @xmath21 fall well below the present empirical upper limits in the case of the charged @xmath2 mesons ( the empirical upper limit on the width of the neutral @xmath2 meson is too large to be constraining ) .",
    "upon addition of the contribution from the two - body axial exchange ( pair ) current that is associated with the linear scalar confining interaction , the calculated widths reach the empirical upper limits in case of the charged @xmath2 mesons , if the value of the axial coupling constant of the light constituent quarks is taken to be @xmath22 .",
    "the single quark mechanisms for pion production lead to a considerable overprediction of the @xmath23-wave pion decay widths of the @xmath4 mesons . this overestimate may be reduced by invoking the two - quark mechanism , which is naturally associated with the scalar confining and vector one - gluon exchange interactions .",
    "consequently , the predicted widths of other @xmath1 meson states that decay by an @xmath23-wave mechanism are also suppressed by large factors .",
    "this effect was first hinted at in ref .  @xcite . in the case of the scalar confining interaction the simplest description of this mechanism",
    "is to view it as an effective increase of the constituent quark mass from @xmath24 to @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the confining string tension .",
    "since the quark mass appears in the denominator of the transition amplitude for @xmath23-wave pion decay , this increase of the constituent quark mass leads to a large reduction of the associated matrix element .",
    "an analogous suppression of @xmath27wave pion decay modes was achieved in ref .",
    "@xcite as a correction to the one - quark operator through coupling to negative energy states .",
    "this two - body mechanism is analogous to that , which is required for a realistic description of the m1 decays of charmonium and heavy light mesons  @xcite .",
    "once this two - quark mechanism is taken into account , the calculated pion decay widths of the @xmath14 and @xmath13 mesons fall somewhat below the empirical values if the axial coupling of the constituent quark is taken to be less than 1 .",
    "if , on the other hand , the matrix element of the pion decay amplitude is evaluated in the non - relativistic approximation , the calculated decay widths exceed the empirical values , in agreement with the result of ref .  @xcite . in the case of the @xmath4 meson",
    ", the @xmath27wave pion decay mode is found to contribute significantly , so that in the end the net ratio of the calculated widths of the @xmath5 and @xmath4 mesons is about 1.2 , which falls within the wide uncertainty range of the current experimental value 1.3 .",
    "the underprediction of the pionic decay widths of the @xmath7 charm mesons is natural , as a substantial fraction of the total width is expected to be due to other decay modes , in particular @xmath6 decay .",
    "the analogy with the corresponding decay modes of the @xmath28 strange meson suggests that the decay modes @xmath29 may be responsible for a significant fraction of the observed decay widths .",
    "the results for the calculated pion decay widths of the excited @xmath1 mesons obtained here are rather similar to those obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , despite the different calculational framework and the different hamiltonian model .",
    "the calculation in ref .",
    "@xcite was restricted to the decays allowed by the lowest order selection rules suggested by heavy quark symmetry  @xcite . in the case of the @xmath4 meson",
    "the excluded @xmath27wave transition was found to be rather important here , a result already hinted at in ref .",
    "the conclusion reached here is that the chiral quark model does indeed provide a fair description of the pion decay widths of the orbitally excited @xmath1 mesons , if they are treated as relativistic interacting two - quark systems .",
    "this paper falls into 5 sections . in section 2",
    "the decay width for @xmath21 is calculated . in section 3 the corresponding decay widths for the orbitally excited @xmath4 and the @xmath5 mesons , including the @xmath23-wave pion decay rate of the @xmath4 meson ,",
    "are calculated . in section 4 the estimated pion decay widths of the hitherto undiscovered charm mesons with @xmath30 and @xmath31",
    "are given .",
    "section 5 contains a summarizing discussion .",
    "the main contribution to the decay widths of the @xmath2 mesons in the ground state band is due to the pion decays @xmath32 .",
    "these transitions are intriguing in that since the mass difference @xmath33 is very close to the pion mass , the available phase space is very small . because of this closeness to the threshold for @xmath34 decay , and the nonzero mass splittings between the different charge states of the @xmath34 and @xmath1 mesons , one of these decays - the decay of the @xmath35 to @xmath36 - is in fact kinematically forbidden .",
    "the orbital wave functions of the constituents of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons differ very little from one another , which implies that the main pionic decay mechanism is @xmath37-wave pion decay . because of the consequent threshold suppression and the small phase space ,",
    "the total widths of the @xmath2 mesons are expected to be very small .",
    "the current empirical upper bound for the total width of the @xmath38 is 0.131 mev and that for the @xmath35 is the former one of these upper bounds is already constraining for theoretical model calculations .",
    "the @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons are confined @xmath10 and @xmath39 systems , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 denote constituent @xmath42 and @xmath43 quarks and @xmath26 and @xmath44 charm and anticharm quarks respectively .",
    "the pions only couple to the light flavor quarks , the simplest model for the coupling being the chiral coupling :    @xmath45    here @xmath3 denotes the axial coupling constant of the light flavor constituent quarks and @xmath46 is the pion decay constant ( 93 mev )",
    ". the value of @xmath3 should be somewhere between unity  @xcite and @xmath47  @xcite .",
    "only the @xmath37-wave part of the coupling  ( [ lagr ] ) contributes to the pionic decays @xmath32 , and hence , in the single quark approximation , the transition operator reduces to    @xmath48    here @xmath49 denotes the mass of the light constituent quark and @xmath50 is the momentum of the emitted pion . the operator @xmath51 is defined as @xmath52 , with @xmath53 and @xmath54 being the initial and final momenta of the light quark .",

    ", @xmath61 is the orbital part of the matrix element @xmath62 , where @xmath63 denotes the state vector of the @xmath12 system .",
    "to arrive at this expression , the following result for the sum over spins and integration over directions of @xmath50 has been used :    @xmath64    here @xmath65 denotes the spin operator of the light constituent quark . the matrix element @xmath61 may be expressed in unapproximated form as    @xmath66    here @xmath67 is the reduced radial wave function for the @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons . the explicit expressions for the energy factors appearing in eq .",

    "@xcite a considerable reduction of these widths was already hinted at .",
    "one reason for the smallness of the values obtained here is the more complete degree of suppression of @xmath27wave pion decay modes achieved here .",

    "( [ s - decp ] ) and  ( [ dec2xxx ] ) suggest that    @xmath81    if the pion momenta @xmath82 are the same , it immediately follows that the @xmath23-wave widths of these two states are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "consequently , as the triplet @xmath4 state does not have any large @xmath23-wave contribution to its pionic width , it follows that the singlet @xmath8 state should be rather narrow as well .",

    "@xcite predicts the traditional `` hydrogen - like '' ordering of the @xmath37-wave states , which is supported by recent nrqcd lattice studies  @xcite .",

    "consequently , the @xmath5 meson has considerably more phase space available than the other @xmath37-shell states .    in this context",
    ", it is instructive to note that the pion decay rates of the @xmath83 and @xmath28 , which are analogous to the @xmath9 and @xmath5 states , have been experimentally determined  @xcite .",

    "it should however be noted that as a consequence of the cancellation between the exchange charge operator contribution and the contribution from the single quark axial charge operator , the @xmath23-wave decay widths are very sensitive to the strength , form and composition of the interaction hamiltonian of the @xmath12 system .",
    "empirical determination of the decay widths of the @xmath9 and @xmath8 mesons should as a consequence be able to provide useful information on the forms of these interactions .",
    "the present calculation of the pion decay widths of the excited charm mesons indicates that the chiral quark model description is compatible with the extant experimental data .",
    "the underprediction of the total decay widths of the @xmath7 charm mesons is to be expected , as the pion decay pattern of the strange meson @xmath7 states as e.g. the @xmath28 , suggests that @xmath6 decay should give a contribution to the decay width of the @xmath5 meson that is about a third as large as that of single pion decay .",
    "this point illustrates the difference between the present relativistic hamiltonian method and the heavy quark effective field theory ( hqet ) method , in which at the present stage the effective coupling strength of pions to light constituent quarks has to be determined by the empirical width of one of the orbitally excited @xmath1 mesons under the assumption that the width is solely due to single pion decay  @xcite .",
    "given that restriction , the present results for the decay widths of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 mesons are overall rather similar to those in ref .",
    "@xcite , although some details as e.g. the ratio between the decay widths to @xmath90 and @xmath91 of the @xmath5 , eq .",
    "( [ ratio ] ) , obtained there is 3.5 and thus somewhat above the empirical value @xmath92 .",
    "the present calculation , which was carried out within the framework of the blankenbecler - sugar reduction of the bethe - salpeter equation , affirms the observation of ref .",
    "@xcite , that a relativistic treatment of the @xmath12 system is required , as a realistic description of the pionic decay widths is not attainable with a non - relativistic description .",
    "the framework of the blankenbecler - sugar equation brings the advantage of formal similarity to the conventional non - relativistic quantum mechanical treatment . in this approach",
    "the exchange currents that are associated with the scalar confining and vector one - gluon exchange interactions play an important role in suppressing the otherwise unrealistically large amplitude for @xmath27wave pion decay of the @xmath4 meson .",
    "this also has the effect of drastically reducing the calculated widths of the singlet @xmath8 and triplet @xmath9 states , which are predicted to be extremely broad in the hqs framework . in that framework ,",
    "the allowed pion decay modes are determined by the total angular momentum of the light constituent quark , which is appropriate if the spins of the light and heavy quarks are decoupled .",
    "this is the case if the heavy quark mass is very large compared to that of the light constituent quark .",
    "however , the empirical @xmath1 meson spectrum shown in fig .  [ spektr ] indicates that the spins of the quarks are strongly coupled , as the @xmath93 splitting is of the order @xmath94 mev . in view of this",
    ", the present treatment is more general since it is not restricted to the case when the heavy quark mass is infinite .",
    "the present work incorporates all decay modes that contribute in that limit  @xcite .",
    "an analogous treatment within the framework of hqs requires an @xmath95 expansion along with the introduction of new parameters , which have to be fitted to experimental data .",
    "the main goal of studying the pion decays of the charm mesons is that of determining the numerical value of the axial coupling @xmath3 of the light constituent quarks .",
    "as long as the absolute values of the widths of the @xmath2 mesons are not known , this goal can not be conclusively attained .",
    "nevertheless both the present study , as well as the earlier investigation in ref .",
    "@xcite , suggests that the standard values of @xmath3 , being somewhat below  1 appear to apply well in the case of the pion decays of the charm mesons .",
