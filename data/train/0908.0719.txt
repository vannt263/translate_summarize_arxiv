    "the classical mechanical picture of a chemical reaction as a scattering problem across a saddle point of the born - oppenheimer potential energy surface in configuration space has proven to be a fruitful way of visualizing and thinking about chemical reactions since the 1930 s , when eyring , polanyi , and wigner developed _ transition state theory _ ( tst ) .",
    "tst provides the framework for computing , using classical mechanics , many of the physically important quantities for describing such chemical reactions .",
    "the fundamental geometrical object in tst is a dividing surface that divides the energy surface into a reactant and a product component .",
    "with such a dividing surface in hand , one can then compute the reaction rate from the directional phase space flux through this surface . in order not to overestimate the rate the dividing surface must not be recrossed by reactive trajectories ,",
    "i.e. the dividing surface should have the `` no re - crossing '' property .",
    "in the 70 s pechukas , pollak and others @xcite showed that for two degrees of freedom such a dividing surface can be constructed from a periodic orbit ( the so called _ periodic orbit dividing surface _ ) .",
    "recently it has been shown that for more than two degrees - of - freedom a dividing surface that is free of recrossings can be built from a _ normally hyperbolic invariant manifold _ ( nhim ) @xcite .",
    "the dividing surface and the nhim can be directly constructed from an algorithm based on a poincar - birkhoff normal form procedure @xcite which also gives an expression for the flux @xcite .",
    "the classical phase space transition state theory , based on poincar - birkhoff normal form theory , naturally leads to a quantum version of transition state theory , based on a quantum normal form .",
    "since the normal form is valid in a neighborhood in energy both above and _ below _ the saddle point , it includes the quantum effect of tunneling in the region near the saddle .",
    "moreover , it does not require a full quantum simulation in a neighborhood of the tst dividing surface ( @xcite ) in order to compute important quantities associated with the reaction .",
    "this is significant since much effort has been devoted to developing a quantum version of transition state theory whose implementation remains feasible for multi - dimensional systems ( see the flux - flux autocorrelation function formalism by miller and coworkers @xcite ) .",
    "however , in @xcite miller stated that `` the conclusion of it all is that there is no uniquely well defined quantum version of tst in the sense that there is in classical mechanics .",
    "this is because tunneling along the reaction coordinate necessarily requires one to solve the ( quantum ) dynamics for some finite region about the ts dividing surface , and if one does this quantum mechanically there is no ` theory ' left , _",
    "i.e. _ , one has a full dimensional quantum dynamics treatment that is _ ipso facto _ exact , a quantum simulation . ''",
    "nevertheless , our approach based on the quantum normal form leads to a quantum version of transition state theory that includes tunneling near the saddle and does not require a full quantum simulation in a neighborhood of the tst dividing surface .",
    "moreover , our computation of the cumulative reaction probability can be viewed as the quantum mechanical flux through a ( classically recrossing free ) dividing surface , which includes tunneling .",
    "the quantum normal form gives a local decoupling of the quantum dynamics to any desired order in @xmath0 which is the key issue here , i.e. locally , we have a decoupling of the scattering states into forward / backward reactive and non - reactive , and for these states we know the transmission probabilities analytically .",
    "therefore we do not have to ` simulate ' the quantum dynamics .",
    "hence , it sidesteps the issues and concerns expressed by miller .    in this paper",
    "we illustrate the utility of the quantum normal form approach to quantum transition state theory by considering the computation and behavior of the bimolecular _ cumulative reaction probability _",

    "the crp is a fundamental quantity that characterizes the reaction rate : the microcanonical and canonical rate constants can be determined from @xmath1 by means of simple relations @xcite .",
    "this paper is outlined as follows . in section [ sec_theory ]",

    "while it is well known that for @xmath150 degrees of freedom , the classical normal form ( cnf ) converges in the neighborhood of saddle - center equilibrium points ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) this is not clear for the qnf ( for the first results in this direction see @xcite ) .",

    "in this paper we used the quantum normal form ( qnf ) approach to quantum transition state theory @xcite for computing the cumulative reaction probability for triatomic collinear reactions .",
    "the qnf leads to a realization of quantum transition state theory which is very much in the spirit of ( classical ) transition state theory .",
    "similar to the classical case where a recrossing free dividing surface can be constructed from a classical normal form such that reaction probabilities can be computed from the flux through the dividing surface , the qnf can be viewed to give quantum reaction probabilities as the quantum mechanical flux through the same ( classically recrossing free ) dividing surface .",
    "so unlike reactive scattering techniques which involve full , global quantum computations , the qnf realization of quantum transition state theory requires only local information in the neighborhood of the saddle equilibrium point which governs the reaction . in this paper we demonstrated , that for heavy atom systems ( comprised of ten or more nucleons ) the qnf this way indeed gives a very efficient method for computing cumulative reaction probabilities .",
    "here we measure ` efficiency ' by the effort for both implementing and computing the qnf .",
    "the latter are both comparable to implementing and computing the classical normal form which lead to the realization of classical transition state theory ( in particular for multidimensional systems ) .",
    "the major difference between the classical and quantum case is that the qnf computation involves the moyal bracket which slightly more complicated ( and thus computationally more expensive ) than the poisson bracket in the classical case .",
    "nevertheless the efforts for implementing and computing the qnf are far lower than for the full reactive scattering computations to which we compared our results .",
    "we saw , however , that for reactions involving light reactions ( such as the hydrogen exchange reaction ) the qnf gave only very poor results .",
    "we attributed the failure of the qnf computation in these cases to the presence of corner cutting tunneling trajectories which are not captured by the qnf . this way",
    "the qnf and reactive scattering methods can be viewed as complementary methods where the latter gives very good results for light atom systems and the former displays its full power especially for heavy atom systems for which reactive scattering approaches become very difficult or even unfeasible due to the growing number of reactive channels that have to be taken into account @xcite .",
    "we note that also other approximation techniques such as the initial value representation ( ivr ) @xcite have been shown to be fruitful for reaction probability analysis of collinear triatomic reactions @xcite .",
    "however , in order to properly account for interference effects the ivr method requires propagation of a huge number of classical trajectories and , therefore , can pose difficulties for application to high - dimensional atomic systems whereas the difficulties in computing the qnf do not grow so rapidly with the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "in fact it would be very interesting to make a detailed comparison between the qnf and the ivr approach .",
    "another benefit of the qnf approach to compute cumulative reaction probabilities lies in the fact that it involves only little ( local ) information of the born - oppenheimer pes ; namely the taylor expansion of the pes about the saddle equilibrium point governing the reaction .",
    "in fact we saw that highly accurate results over quite a broad energy range can already be obtained from the 4@xmath170 or 6@xmath170 taylor expansion which enters the qnf of the same order .",
    "this is especially useful for systems for which the computation of the global pes required in other methods is very difficult .",
