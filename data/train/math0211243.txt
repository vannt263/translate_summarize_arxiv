    "the smallest possible index of a generator in @xmath97 is @xmath32 .",
    "thus , the leaf exponents of all leaves numbered @xmath21 through @xmath98 in @xmath96 must be @xmath21 .",

    "the tree @xmath99 must have an empty left subtree , @xmath98 right carets with exposed left carets beginning at the root , and then the tree @xmath26 .",
    "similarly , @xmath100 is the tree having an empty left subtree , @xmath98 right carets with no left subtrees to the right of the root , and then the tree @xmath27 . figure [ fig : phi2w ] gives an example of he tree pair diagram of @xmath101 , using the word @xmath18 depicted in figure [ fig : exptree ] .",
    "we now show that @xmath92 is a quasi - isometric embedding .",

    "given the simple geometric representation of the shift map @xmath1 , it is natural to define a `` reverse shift map '' , which we denote @xmath107 , in which the original trees become left subtrees of the root caret rather than right subtrees .",

    "geometrically , it is completely natural to consider @xmath107 as well as @xmath1 . however , in the literature , @xmath107 is rarely mentioned , likely because it is algebraically cumbersome , unlike @xmath1 , in the following way .",

    "the maps @xmath92 and @xmath118 are shown to be quasi - isometric embeddings because an element and its image are represented by tree pair diagrams which differ by a finite number of carets .",

    "a _ clone subgroup _ is the image of @xmath0 under @xmath124 , that is , @xmath128 .",
    "the simplest examples of clone subgroups are @xmath89 and @xmath115 .",
    "clone subgroups can be understood in a number of ways .",

    "a node in a binary tree is given an address using the following inductive method .",

    "given a node with label @xmath132 , the left child of the node is labelled @xmath133 and right child of the node labelled @xmath134 .",
    "for example , the right child of the right child of the left child of the right child of the root has address @xmath135 .    given @xmath124 as above , and @xmath136 ,",
    "let @xmath137 . from the definitions of @xmath138 and @xmath124",
    ", we know that the tree @xmath26 will be a subtree of @xmath99 , and @xmath27 will be a subtree of @xmath100 .",
    "we consider the address @xmath139 of the root caret of @xmath26 as a subtree of @xmath99 and use @xmath132 to give an  address \" for the clone subgroup @xmath128 .",
    "namely , we can uniquely refer to @xmath128 as @xmath140 .",
    "for example , the subgroup @xmath141 is the image @xmath142 .    we can also describe clone subgroups by their representation as piecewise linear homeomorphisms of the unit interval .",
    "each dyadic subinterval of the form @xmath143 $ ] is equivalent to the standard unit interval @xmath144 $ ] by an affine map with dyadic coefficients . for a fixed clone subgroup @xmath140 where @xmath132 has length @xmath145",
    ", there is a proper subinterval @xmath146 of @xmath147 $ ] which contains the @xmath148- and @xmath149- coordinates of all the breakpoints of elements of @xmath140 , and such that all elements of @xmath140 are the identity map outside of the interval @xmath150 .",
    "the length of @xmath150 is @xmath151 and the endpoints of @xmath150are @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "the endpoints can be computed easily from the address @xmath132 . furthermore , any element of @xmath0 whose breakpoints all lie in the interval @xmath154 $ ] will be an element of @xmath140 .",
    "for the example subgroup @xmath141 , the dyadic interval containing the all breakpoints of its elements is @xmath155 $ ] .",
    "it is easy to see that any clone subgroup @xmath156 is isomorphic to @xmath0 .",
    "if @xmath38 and @xmath137 , we know by definition that the tree pair @xmath25 is reduced . from the definitions of @xmath1 and @xmath107 , and thus @xmath124 , no additional reduction can occur when the tree pair @xmath157 is formed .",
    "thus each element of @xmath0 produces a unique element of @xmath140 , and it is clear that @xmath129 and @xmath131 must generate @xmath140 .        the clone subgroup @xmath140 is determined by @xmath158 where each @xmath126 is either the map @xmath1 or @xmath107 .",
    "we know from theorems [ thm : phi ] and [ thm : psi ] that @xmath1 and @xmath107 are @xmath159-quasi - isometric embeddings of @xmath0 into @xmath0 .",
    "geometrically , we see that if @xmath93 and @xmath160 , the trees @xmath161 and @xmath162 differ by @xmath32 carets .",
    "thus , we again get that @xmath163 for all @xmath18 in @xmath0 , which shows that @xmath124 is also a quasi - isometric embedding , with constants @xmath164 .",

    "we now show that @xmath0 contains a family of quasi - isometrically embedded subgroups of the form @xmath2 for @xmath165 .",
    "these examples include those of burillo @xcite , who presents a family of subgroups of @xmath0 of the form @xmath166 which are quasi - isometrically embedded .",

    "we present an alternate geometric proof that some concrete geometric realizations of the subgroups @xmath2 are quasi - isometrically embedded , using the shift maps described above .",
    "burillo proves these results by bounding the distortion function using a technique he develops to estimate the length of @xmath18 in the word metric corresponding to the generating set of the presentation @xmath37 as a function of the normal form of @xmath18 .",
    "we present an alternate geometric proof of this theorem and corollary before presenting the proof of theorem [ thm : products ] .",

    "it is easily seen that @xmath183 , and we draw the tree pair diagram @xmath157 representing this element as follows .",
    "the form of the tree @xmath100 is clear , and in determining @xmath99 , we see that the left subtree of the root caret is empty , and the right subtree of the root caret has as string of @xmath184 carets of type @xmath47 , a single caret of type @xmath46 and a single caret of type @xmath52 .",
    "we are really interested in the fact that the right subtree of the right child of the root caret in @xmath95 is empty .",
    "this can be easily determined by applying the following lemma from @xcite to the substring @xmath185 of @xmath186 , since this word determines the right subtree of the root of @xmath99 .        since @xmath190 , we see that the right subtree of the right child of the root caret of @xmath26 is empty , as is the corresponding subtree in @xmath27 .",
    "this fact guarantees that an element in @xmath191 and @xmath192 commute , as is easily seen from the definition of group multiplication of pairs of trees , or simply by noting that subintervals where these elements are different from the identity map are disjoint .",
