    "canonical discussions on possible new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) have been centered around the hierarchy problem and the unifications of couplings .",
    "the current favorites among various approaches to stabilizing the low higgs mass ( @xmath2 gev as found at the lhc@xcite ) are supersymmetry , technicolor , and extra dimensions .",
    "these approaches also incorporate the philosophy of coupling unification in grand unified theories ( gut s ) .    to this list ,",
    "we seek to add another contender , namely models based on the non - commutative geometry ( ncg ) of connes.@xcite in a series of papers starting from 1990,@xcite connes and collaborators have argued that the sm action could be derived from a particular ncg via the construction of what they call the `` spectral '' action , @xcite in essence geometrizing the sm and placing it on a similar footing to gravity .",
    "several of the predictions that result from the approach , according to our current understanding , are quite remarkable :    * the @xmath3 gauge bosons and the higgs doublet are unified into a single `` superconnection , '' one of the consequences being that the @xmath3 gauge coupling @xmath4 and the yukawa couplings are related in a particular way .",
    "@xcite * the @xmath5 gauge couplings satisfy an @xmath6 gut - like relation , even though the particle content of the model is that of the sm . @xcite",
    "* anomaly cancellation requires the presence of both electroweak and qcd sectors , another gut - like feature . @xcite * the smallness of the higgs boson mass can potentially be explained via an extra - dimension - like mechanism involving a ` warp'-factor.@xcite    the approach , of course , is not without its problems :    * the gut - like relations on the gauge couplings can only be imposed at a single scale , so one must interpret the ncg spectral action as that which ` emerges ' from an underlying ncg theory at the ` unification ' scale .",
    "* quantization of the model within the ncg framework ( in the sense of path integrals ) is yet to be fully explored,@xcite so one usually treats the ncg spectral action as an effective qft action at the unification scale , and evolve down to lower energies using the usual renormalization group ( rg ) equations to work out the infrared consequences . * the minimal version of ncg model which describes the sm predicts a higgs mass of @xmath7 , in clear contradiction with experiment.@xcite .",
    "this issue could be remedied by turning one of the off - diagonal entries of the dirac operator , which is responsible for the neutrino majorana mass , into a field . with this singlet field",
    "coupled to the sm higgs field , the model accommodates a @xmath8 higgs boson.@xcite this could also be accomplished by extending the ncg to that which leads to a left - right symmetric pati - salam type action with coupling unification which automatically involves this singlet field.@xcite    in addition , the ncg spectral action approach to particle physics is under continued development by connes and collaborators , and sorting out the various versions can be difficult .    despite these caveats , however , or any other reservation one may have about the entire approach , it is not without its merits , as explained above , and we feel that it may have the potential to develop into a full - fledged paradigm . in particular , from the phenomenological standpoint , the necessity to enlarge the gauge symmetry ( via an enlargement of the underlying ncg ) to accommodate the higg mass can be considered a strength rather than a weakness .",
    "it tells us that the approach is restrictive enough for the models to be confronted by experiment , and point us in new directions to explore .",

    "the most promising cases are models b and c of ref .   with the colored @xmath235 field surviving below @xmath100 .",
    "we note that this may put the @xmath235 particles within reach of the lhc .",
    "but even for those cases @xmath113 can not be made as low as @xmath236 . in all cases , the optimum conditions for minimum @xmath21 and/or minimum @xmath113 requires degeneracies of some of the symmetry breaking scales .",
    "in this paper , we have initiated a purely phenomenological analysis of connes ncg approach to the sm and beyond , in the light of the latest experimental results from the lhc . in particular ,",
    "we have concentrated on the remarkable left - right symmetric structure that is inherent in the ncg of the sm , embodied in the unified left - right symmetric pati - salam models of ref .  , and explored its phenomenological consequences by concentrating on the possible existence of a tev scale @xmath1 boson .",
    "we find that generating a tev scale @xmath1 boson with the small coupling of @xmath237 within ncg motivated models is not trivial and places strong constraints on the particle content and symmetry breaking scales .",
    "we note that we have also conducted a preliminary analysis of the constraints imposed by proton stability@xcite , the @xmath238 neutron - antineutron and hydrogen - antihydrogen oscillations@xcite as well as the constraints coming from the inflationary cosmological models@xcite . in principle , these constraints are not prohibitive of the phenomenological analysis carried out in this paper .",
    "while our analysis could suggest that the ncg motivated unified left - right pati - salam model is not favored phenomenologically by the current lhc data , we note the possibility that the current approach of grafting the ncg spectral action to rg evolution of standard qft at the gut scale may not capture the true nature and predictions of ncg theories .    finally , we address the closely related question of the hierarchy problem .",
    "one of the most interesting aspects of the ncg of the sm and its pati - salam - like completion is the existence of the gut scale which can be found in the close proximity to the planck scale , i.e. the scale of quantum gravity .",
    "given this fact as well as the presence of a hidden fundamental non - commutative structure in this approach , this suggests that the hierarchy problem should get a quantum gravitational , and not an effective field theory treatment .",
    "the more convincing physical meaning of this gut scale also comes after one realizes that connes approach also produces a gravity sector in parallel with the standard model ( and its pati - salam completion ) and thus the gut scale should be viewed as being close to the natural scale of gravity , i.e. planck scale , and indeed the two scales are not that far apart in the non - commutative approach . in particular if one views quantum gravity as having origins in metastring theory @xcite then one finds the fundamental non - commutative structure , and also , the two - scale renormalization group , which sheds new light on such fundamental issues as the hierarchy problem : the two scales that feature in refs .",
    "are both the uv and the ir scales and thus the stability of the higgs mass becomes two - fold , both with respect to the uv and to the ir . in other words , the question is now not only why the higgs mass is not of the planck scale ( or the gut scale ) but also why the higgs mass is not of the hubble ( vacuum energy ) scale .",
    "it is well known that numerologically , the higgs scale ( @xmath239 ) is the geometric mean between these two scales , at the point of a uv / ir invariant energy scale .",
    "the higgs scale also naturally appears as a geometric scale in connes non - commutative geometry approach , in complete analogy with the geometric meaning of the planck and the hubble scales . actually ,",
    "because of the appearance of gravity and the standard model lagrangians in the connes s spectral action , and because of the discrete nature of the higgs dimension , there is a natural higgs - like degree of freedom on the gravity side  a brans - dicki - jordan - like scalar  which can be argued to contribute to the geometric warping of the higgs discrete dimension .",
    "this is similar to the infinite extra dimensional scenarios , however , without infinite extra dimensions .",
    "@xcite    in our view the approach based on ncg ( and its related proposal based on the superconnection approach @xcite ) offers a new and , phenomenologically , almost completely unexplored view on the rationale for the sm and also for its natural completion .",
    "this approach also offers a possibly exciting relation with the fundamental physics of quantum gravity , thus relating the infrared physics of the current exciting experimental searches conducted at the lhc to the hidden ultraviolet physics of quantum theory of space and time .",
