    "since the existence of the radiative lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) decays depends on the flavor changing currents , they appear in the loop level and , therefore , they are rich from the theoretical point of view . in the standard model ( sm ) , even with the neutrino mixing with non zero neutrino masses , their calculated branching ratios ( brs ) are too small to reach the experimental limits .",
    "this motivates one to search new models beyond the sm and to extend the particle spectrum in order to enhance the brs of these decays .",
    "the discoveries of heavy leptons stimulated the experimental work for the lfv decays .",
    "the current limits for the ( brs ) of @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays are @xmath4 @xcite and @xmath5 @xcite , respectively . to search for the lfv decay @xmath3 @xcite",

    "the br of @xmath2 decay has been measured as @xmath7 @xcite , and recently , an upper limit of @xmath8 at @xmath9 cl has been obtained @xcite ( @xcite ) , which is an improvement almost by one order of magnitude with respect to previous one .",
    "besides the experimental work , there is an extensive theoretical analysis done on the radiative lfv decays in the literature @xcite-@xcite .",
    "these decays are studied in the supersymmetric models @xcite , in the framework of the two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) @xcite and in a model independent way @xcite .",
    "recently , they are analyzed in the framework of 2hdm and the supersymmetric model in @xcite .    in the present work",
    ", we study the lfv processes @xmath10 , @xmath1 and @xmath11 in the 2hdm and we respect the idea that the hierarchy of fermion masses is coming from the overlap of the fermion gaussian profiles in the extra dimensions , so called the split fermion scenario @xcite . here , the extension of the higgs sector and the permission of the flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc s ) at tree level , ensure the brs of the radiative decays under consideration to be enhanced , theoretically .",
    "in addition to this , the extension of the space - time , the inclusion of one ( two ) extra spatial dimension , causes certain modifications in the brs .    in the split fermion scenario ,",
    "the fermions are assumed to locate at different points in the extra dimensions with the exponentially small overlaps of their wavefunctions and there are various studies in the literature @xcite-@xcite .",
    "one of the phenomenologically reliable set of explicit positions of left and right handed components of fermions in a single extra dimension have been predicted in @xcite and this is the one we use in our numerical calculations . in @xcite ,",
    "the restrictions on the split fermions in the extra dimensions have been obtained by using the leptonic w decays and the lepton violating processes , and the cp violation in the quark sector has been studied in @xcite .",
    "@xcite is devoted to find stringent bounds on the size of the compactification scale 1/r , the physics of kaon , neutron and b / d mesons and , in @xcite , the rare processes in the split fermion scenario have been studied . the shapes and overlaps of the fermion wave functions in the split fermion model",
    "has been estimated in @xcite and the work in @xcite ( @xcite,@xcite ) is related to the the radiative lfv decays ( electric dipole moments of charged leptons , the lfv @xmath12 decays ) in the split fermion scenario .",
    "recently , the higgs localization in the split fermion models has been studied in @xcite .    in our calculations ,",
    "we consider that the leptons have gaussian profiles in the extra dimension(s ) .",
    "furthermore , we first assume that the new higgs doublet lies in 4d brane , whose coordinate(s ) in one ( two ) extra dimension(s ) is arbitrary , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the width of the gaussian lepton profile in the extra dimension(s ) .",
    "second , we take that the new higgs doublet lies in one ( two ) extra dimension(s ) but restricted into the thin bulk which has width @xmath15 , @xmath16 ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) . we observe that the brs are sensitive to the location of the 4d brane and , in the second case , the width of the thin bulk , especially for the @xmath3 decay .    the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we present the lepton - lepton - new higgs scalar vertices and the brs of the radiative lfv decays in the split fermion scenario with the assumption that the new higgs doublet is restricted to the 4d brane ( thin bulk ) in the one and two extra dimensions , in the framework of the 2hdm .",

    ", one goes beyond the sm and the version of the 2hdm , permitting the existence of the fcncs at tree level , is one of the candidate to obtain relatively large brs , since the extended higgs sector brings additional contributions .",
    "these contributions are controlled by the new yukawa couplings , which are complex in general .",
    "besides , the inclusion of the spatial extra dimensions causes to enhance the brs , since the particle spectrum is further extended after the compactification . in our analysis",
