    "coherent optical spectroscopy has been widely used for the investigation of the energy levels of electronic , vibrational and spin states in condensed matter systems @xcite .",
    "it comprises many elaborated techniques that can be roughly divided in two main categories : the first set uses continuous wave light sources of tunable wavelength with narrow spectral width , i.e. long coherence time , which enable direct acquisition of coherent spectra in the frequency range  @xcite .",
    "the second set is based on recording the dynamics of the system s response to short light pulse excitation  @xcite .",
    "here , fourier transformation of the optical transients into the frequency domain allows obtaining similar information , not only about the energy level structure , but also about the inhomogeneous and homogeneous widths of the involved optical transitions as well as the coherent dynamics of the system under study .",
    "one such technique is the two - dimensional fourier transform spectroscopy ( 2dfts ) which is based on the fourier transformation of transient four - wave - mixing signals .",
    "this technique has rapidly developed during the last decade and has been successfully applied for investigation of atomic , molecular , and condensed matter systems such as organic and inorganic semiconductors  @xcite .",
    "one of the appealing features of 2dfts is the intuitive visualization of the underlying physics , as it allows one to extract not only the energy levels but also provides a clear understanding of the dynamical properties and correlations between optical excitations  @xcite .",
    "particular interest is attracted by systems with more than two states interacting with light .",
    "the most representative examples are @xmath1- ( @xmath2- ) type energy level orders where the single ground ( excited ) state is optically coupled to an excited ( ground ) state doublet  @xcite .",
    "these level schemes make it possible to observe several fascinating phenomena such as quantum beats , coherent population trapping and electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) which may be used for applications in quantum information technology  @xcite .",
    "the main feature of a @xmath2-scheme is a possible long coherence time of the ground states . in semiconductors ,",
    "the @xmath2-scheme can be obtained for optical excitation of localized excess carriers , e.g. , electrons in the conduction band or holes in the valence band , using their spin degree of freedom  @xcite . in the case of resident electrons ,",
    "the charged exciton ( trion @xmath3 ) and the donor - bound exciton ( @xmath4 ) are possible optically excited states . coherent population trapping and eit have been demonstrated for donor - bound excitons in bulk gaas  @xcite , as well as trions in n - type cdte quantum wells ( qws )  @xcite and quantum dots ( qds ) charged with resident carriers  @xcite .",
    "these studies have exploited high resolution spectroscopy with continuous wave lasers .",
    "also spin control of resident carriers using ultrafast laser pulses has been successfully demonstrated  @xcite .",
    "however , most of four - wave - mixing and 2dfts experiments on charged excitations in semiconductors did not exploit the spin degree of freedom in the ground state so far  @xcite .",
    "recently , we demonstrated that the ground state splitting of a trion in transverse magnetic field leads to quantum beats in the photon echoes at the larmor precession frequency  @xcite .",
    "this allowed us to perform a coherent transfer of optical excitation into a spin ensemble and to observe long - lived photon echoes  @xcite . here , we demonstrate that our approach can be used as tool for remarkably high resolution spectroscopy of the ground state levels : in an n - type cdte qw we are able to resolve splittings between the spin sub - levels with sub-@xmath0ev precision and to distinguish between different types of electrons in the ensemble , namely electrons either bound to donors or localized on qw potential fluctuations .",
    "to that end we show that stimulated step - like raman processes in the two - pulse excitation scheme allow us to probe the electron spin ensemble with high selectivity and precision even for systems with broad optical transitions , given by large inhomogeneous broadening due to system variations or short optical coherence times leading to strong homogeneous broadening .",
    "therefore our approach using ultrashort optical pulses mimics eit which typically requires frequency stabilized lasers to resolve splitting of that magnitude .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we consider 2dfts spectra under resonant excitation of localized trions and donor - bound excitons subject to transverse magnetic field , focusing on raman coherence spectra which allow us to evaluate the splitting of the ground state and to determine the relaxation times of the electron spin ensemble .",
    "second , we show experimental results for a cdte qw in which both trions and donor - bound exciton states are present .",
    "we concentrate on optical transitions in zincblende semiconductor nanostructures with resident electrons in the conduction band . in that way a @xmath2-transition scheme with long - lived coherence in the ground state can be established .",
    "we consider semiconductor qws with the heavy and light holes split by the confinement potential along the @xmath5-direction . at cryogenic temperatures",
    "the resident electrons are localized on potential fluctuations .",
    "alternately the electrons can become trapped by donors .",
    "the ground state is a doublet with electron spin @xmath6 .",
    "the lowest energy , almost degenerate states that can be optically excited are a trion or a donor - bound exciton , whose angular momentum @xmath7 is given by the heavy hole . in a transverse magnetic field @xmath8 applied along the @xmath9-direction",
    "the electron states are split by @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the electron g - factor and @xmath12 is the bohr magneton .",
    "optical transitions between all four states are allowed with polarizations directed along ( h ) or perpendicular ( v ) to the direction of magnetic field ( h@xmath13 and v@xmath14 ) . the energy level structure and optical transitions",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schema ] .",
    "we neglect all other states , e.g. neutral excitons and light hole transitons , due to the used spectrally - narrow optical pulses with 1  mev width .",
    "transient four - wave mixing requires three optical pulses with wavevectors @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively , separated in time by @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "the time @xmath20 gives the temporal profile of the resulting four - wave - mixing signal with respect to pulse 3 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : schema](a ) ) . due to the inhomogeneous broadening of the optical transitions the transient four - wave - mixing signal",
    "is considered in the rephasing configuration and the photon echoes are described by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the degree of ( gaussian ) inhomogeneity .",
    "the amplitude of the photon echo @xmath23 depends on the delay times @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 as well as on the polarization configuration of the exciting pulses . here",
    ", we consider the hhh ( vvv ) or hvv ( vhh ) configurations . it can be shown that the resulting photon echo is h ( v ) polarized in both cases . for hhh the possible optical transitions corresponds to two uncoupled two - level systems ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) , while for hvv the transitions lead to two three - level systems ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) which are coupled by sharing the ground states .",
    "photon echoes in other polarization configurations , such as diagonal linear or circular , can be written as superposition of the hhh and hvv signals .",

    "the characters correspond to the polarization of optical transition parallel ( h ) and perpendicular ( v ) to the magnetic field . ]",
    "the first h - polarized pulse addresses the two optical transitions between @xmath28 and @xmath29 at frequency @xmath30 and between @xmath31 and @xmath32 at frequency @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath34 corresponds to the optical resonance frequency at zero magnetic field ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "pulse 1 creates two independent coherent superpositions between the pairs of states @xmath36 and @xmath37 which can be considered as _",
    "optical coherences_. in the density matrix formalism , they correspond to the @xmath38 and @xmath39 density matrix elements , respectively .",
    "the second and the third pulses are both h- or v- polarized .",
    "there are two possible quantum mechanical pathways for the evolution of the system .",
    "( i ) _ hhh co - polarized configuration_. the second pulse addresses the same pairs of optical transitions and , in that way , optical coherences @xmath38 and @xmath39 are transformed into excited state populations @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "the inhomogeneous broadening of optical transitions leads to population gratings in the spectral domain .",
    "in addition , spectral spin fringes for trion and electron states appear due to the energy difference @xmath42 between the optical transitions  @xcite . finally , the third pulse induces the coherences @xmath38 and @xmath39 and results in the emission of photon echo after the rephasing process .",
    "( ii ) _ hvv cross - polarized configuration_. here , the second pulse accomplishes a stimulated step - like raman process where the optical coherences @xmath38 and @xmath39 are transferred into the electron spin coherence @xmath43 .",
    "this mechanism allows one to store the optical information in the long - lived spin ensemble  @xcite .",
    "the third pulse retrieves the information by reverse transformation of the spin coherence into the optical domain .",
    "thereby , the signal becomes sensitive to @xmath42 , which corresponds to the energy transfer taking place during the raman process .",
    "for the case that the splitting of the electron spin sub - levels in the ground state is smaller than the spectral width of the excitation laser pulses ( in our case @xmath44  mev ) and the inhomogeneous broadening ( @xmath45 ) , the echo signals can be well approximated with gaussian pulses with amplitude @xmath46 which depends on @xmath18 and @xmath19 only . in the linear co - polarized polarization configuration @xmath47 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & e^{-\\frac{2t_1}{t_2}}e^{-\\frac{t_2}{t_1^e}}\\sin^2(\\omega_lt_1/2).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath48 is the coherence time of the optically excited @xmath3 or @xmath4 complex . the first term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "is limited by the radiative lifetime of the photoexcited complex ( negative trion or donor - bound exciton ) @xmath49 , while the second term originates from electron spin fringes which are not annihilated by the radiative recombination .",
    "indeed , the excitation happens through strictly h - polarized channels ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : schema ] ) , while the recombination is an incoherent process that can occur through both the h- and the v - channel .",
    "this leads to long - lived spin fringes which decay with the longitudinal spin relaxation time @xmath50 . for @xmath51",

    ", we have two terms in eq . , corresponding to two different contributions .",
    "the fast decay is attributed to the trion lifetime while the long - lived signal is oscillating with @xmath57 and decays with @xmath58 , which corresponds to the electron spin dephasing in the ground state ( transversal spin relaxation time ) . for @xmath51",
    "the signal transforms into @xmath59        let us first consider the rephasing spectra for @xmath51 @xmath60 fourier transformation of eqs .   and gives @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the central frequency of the inhomogeneous ensemble with a halfwidth in frequency corresponding to @xmath63 . here , it is assumed that the inhomogeneous broadening @xmath64 is significantly larger than the homogeneous broadening @xmath65 .",

    "the rephasing spectra for the co- and cross - polarized configurations are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig:2dfs - rephasing](a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",

    "the spectrum can be used to evaluate the lifetimes of the excited states ( @xmath75 ) and the time of population relaxation between the ground states @xmath28 and @xmath31 ( @xmath76 ) .    for the cross - polarized configuration @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",

    "[ fig:2dfs - raman](b ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that in hvv configuration only the imaginary part is present for @xmath81 .",
    "it contains two peaks with different sign ( dispersive shape ) at @xmath82 .",
    "the widths of these peaks are given by @xmath83 .",
    "thus , 2dfts spectra measured in cross - polarized configuration allow us to evaluate the coherence times and the energy splitting between the ground state levels @xmath42 .",
    "the splitting measurement works even if it significantly undercuts the homogeneous spectral width of the optical transitions ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "thus , this method can be used for high resolution spectroscopy of the ground state .",
    "the advantage is the possibility to determine the splitting of the ground states under excitation at a particular photon energy @xmath85 .",
    "an excellent example and demonstration of this powerful technique is the determination of spin splittings for different complexes that exist simultaneously in the very same sample , e.g. @xmath3 and @xmath4 as shown in the next section .",
    "this information can not be obtained using pure spin resonance techniques where optical excitation with @xmath86 is absent .",
    "therefore , in this particular case we perform optically detected magnetic resonance using coherent optical spectroscopy .",
    "eventually the optical coherence initiated by the laser pulse plays an essential role during the excitation and the final emission process at @xmath86 and @xmath87 optical frequency , respectively .",
    "otherwise , the raman coherence can not be restored which is in contrast to conventional time - resolved pump - probe faraday rotation measurements  @xcite .",
    "the investigated sample comprises a 20-nm thick cdte qw sandwiched between cd@xmath89mg@xmath90te barriers .",
    "the qw was grown by molecular beam epitaxy on a ( 100)-gaas substrate , on which a thick ( cd , mg)te buffer was deposited followed by a short period superlattice and a 100  nm cd@xmath89mg@xmath90te barrier .",
    "the structure was not intentionally doped with donors ; however , the unavoidable background of impurities results in localized resident carriers that originate from the barriers as well as from electrons bound to donors in the qw .",
    "the density of these electrons @xmath91 in the qw is low so that the exciton bohr radius @xmath92 , which allows us to consider each resident electron as isolated and non - interacting .",

    "the sample was mounted in a liquid - helium split - coil magneto - cryostat in voigt geometry and was kept at a temperature of @xmath94  k. the direction of the magnetic field was parallel to the quantum well plane ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "for the photon echo experiments we use a sequence of three excitation pulses with variable delays @xmath18 between pulses 1 and 2 and @xmath19 between pulses 2 and 3 .",
    "the duration of the pulses is 2  ps and their spectral width is 0.9  mev .",
    "the optical pulses 2 and 3 are propagating along the same direction , so their wavevectors are equal ( @xmath96 ) . in this case , both the two - pulse ( primiary photon echo ppe ) and the three - pulse photon ( stimulated photon echo spe ) echo are directed along the same direction @xmath97 and are collected in reflection geometry .",
    "transients are measured by taking the cross - correlation of the resulting four - wave - mixing signal @xmath98 with the reference pulse @xmath99 using heterodyne detection .",
    "this provides a high - sensitivity , background - free measurement of the absolute value of the four - wave - mixing electric field amplitude in real time when scanning the reference pulse delay time @xmath20 , which is taken relative to the arrival time of pulse 3 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : schema ] ) .",
    "the heterodyne detection allows us to distinguish between two- and three - pulse echoes by choosing the proper detection delay time @xmath20 .",
    "the ppe signals appear at @xmath100 while the spes are located at @xmath101 .",
    "@xcite at @xmath102 the ppe and spe peak amplitudes decay exponentially with @xmath48 and @xmath103 as function of @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "this allows us to determine the homogeneous linewidth @xmath104 and the decay rate @xmath75 of the particular optical transition , e.g. @xmath93 , @xmath3 or @xmath4 , and is accomplished by the proper choice of the excitation photon energy @xmath105 .",
    "for resonant excitation of the exciton with @xmath106  ev we obtain very short decoherence times limited to a few ps , i.e. @xmath107ev . for the trions and donor - bound excitons the homogeneous linewidths are significantly narrower due to stronger localization of these complexes . here , we obtain @xmath108ev for the @xmath3 and @xmath109ev for the @xmath4 . at lower energies",
    "@xmath110  ev we observe that the linewidth is determined mainly by the radiative decay to the ground state , i.e. @xmath111 .",
    "note that in our experiments we intentionally use spectrally narrow laser pulses ( @xmath112  mev ) in order to suppress many - body interactions between different photoexcited complexes .",
    "for example , using spectrally - broad femtosecond pulses one would simultaneously excite excitons and trions . as a result , exciton - trion interaction would lead to a significant increase of the homogeneous linewidth for the trion transition , which would become comparable to the one measured for the @xmath93  @xcite .    in order to evaluate the energy splitting of the ground electronic states we concentrate on three - pulse photon echo transients setting the reference pulse delay @xmath113 and performing scans as a function of @xmath19 for different excitation photon energies @xmath105 in cross - polarized configuration ( hvv ) .",

    "exemplary curves taken at @xmath116  ev and 1.5985  ev corresponding to excitation of the @xmath4 and @xmath3 optical transitions , respectively , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : experiment](d ) .",
    "when @xmath19 is varied we observe an oscillatory signal that decays on a long time - scale of several ns .",
    "note that the long - lived signal is present only in the spectral region of 1.597 - 1.599  ev where the @xmath3 and the @xmath4 resonances are located , i.e. it is necessary to address resident carriers for storing optical information on such long time scales . using eq .",
    "we evaluate the spectral dependence of the long - lived amplitude , the oscillation frequency @xmath117 and the decay rate @xmath118  @xcite . in accordance with eq .",
    "these parameters allow us to restore the 2dfts raman coherence image @xmath119 which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : experiment](b ) .",
    "the most striking feature is the variation of the oscillation frequency with photon energy @xmath86 , demonstrating a step - like behavior which clearly demonstrates that @xmath42 increases from @xmath120ev to @xmath121ev when the excitation energy is moved from @xmath4 to @xmath3 . from these data ,",
    "we evaluate g - factors of @xmath122 and 1.635 for resident electrons bound to a donor and localized in a potential fluctuation , respectively .",
    "the difference between g - factors can not be explained by their dependence on photon energy since the absolute value of @xmath11 in cdmgte semiconductors decreases with increasing energy gap  @xcite .",
    "the origin of this variation requires further studies of the electronic states involved in these complexes .",
    "in conclusion , we have demonstrated that two - dimensional fourier spectroscopy based on photon echoes can be successfully applied for the evaluation of tiny splittings between ground state energy levels which are optically coupled to a common excited state in , e.g. , a @xmath2-type scheme .",
    "we have shown that the stimulated step - like raman process induced by a sequence of two pulses creates a coherent superposition of the ground state doublet which can be retrieved only by optical means due to selective excitation of the same spin sub - ensemble with the third pulse .",
    "this provides the unique opportunity to distinguish between several electron spin species in a large ensemble of emitters . as a proof of principle",
    "we apply the technique to an n - type cdte quantum well system where the zeeman splitting difference in the sub-@xmath0ev range between donor - bound electrons and electrons localized at potential fluctuations has been resolved while the homogeneous linewidth of the optical transitions is two orders of magnitude larger than this splitting .",
