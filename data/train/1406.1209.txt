    "the connection between long - duration gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) and sne is well established in the local universe .",
    "following the first cases of coincidences @xcite , now for almost every grb at redshift @xmath2 a corresponding sn has been identified @xcite . despite the diverse properties of their associated grbs , all grb / sne observed so far are luminous , broad - lined type ic sne ( no h , no he , * ? ? ?",
    "the very broad lines indicate a high expansion velocity of the ejecta , and point to a high explosion kinetic energy ( @xmath3 ) @xcite .",
    "detailed models of grb / sne yield a typical sn @xmath3  of a few @xmath0erg ( depending on the asphericity of the sn ) , an ejected mass @xmath4@xmath5 , and a @xmath6ni  mass of @xmath7 .",
    "this places grb / sne at the luminous , energetic and massive end of sneic ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",

    "although the two grbs are very different in energy , the former extremely powerful , similar to cosmological ones , the latter a normal grb , the sne are again similar ( * ? ? ?",
    "* delia et al . , in prep . ) .",
    "it has been proposed that long grbs are produced by the collapsar mechanism , where a massive star collapses directly to a black hole ( bh ) .",
    "accretion on the bh releases energy in the form of a relativistic jet which may explode the star and produce a visible sn if @xmath6ni  is synthesised in the dense neutrino wind emanating from the accretion disc @xcite .",
    "sneic associated with x - ray flashes ( xrfs ) have a smaller @xmath3 , more similar to ordinary sneic , and are not as luminous @xcite .",
    "models indicate progenitor stars of @xmath8 , which are expected to collapse to neutron stars ( ns ) .",
    "their @xmath3  ( a few @xmath9 erg ) appears to be consistent with energy injection from a magnetar , a rapidly spinning magnetised ns @xcite .",
    "this mechanism taps the energy in the magnetic field and may also give rise to a relativistic jet ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "observational and theoretical evidence has been mounting that more massive stars can also collapse to ns @xcite .",
    "magnetar jets and their potential as a source of grbs have been investigated in various papers , suggesting that magnetar energy can be used to energise grbs or xrfs @xcite .",
    "it has also been proposed that very rapidly spinning magnetars can explain the much brighter light curves of grb / sne @xcite .",
    "this may conflict with the observation in sn1998bw of strong emission lines of fe , which indicate a high @xmath6ni  yield @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "only sn1998bw could be followed late enough to observe fe lines .",
    "one of the most interesting unsolved questions in grb science is what actually drives the event . in the collapsar model",
    "the jet generated by the bh explodes the star , but is its energy sufficient to impart a high @xmath3   to the sn ?",
    "simulations have so far not tested this , but the energy needed for the jet to emerge from the star and unbind it ( @xmath10erg , * ? ? ? * ) appears to be much smaller than the sn @xmath3 . in the magnetar scenario ,",
    "if the coupling is large energy may be extracted from the ns and added to the sn @xmath3 , which would otherwise derive from the classical neutrino mechanism .",
    "the sub - relativistic outflow may not be highly collimated , as indicated by the distribution of sn material @xcite . in this scenario energy production",
    "would be limited by the ns spin rate .",
    "we analyse the global properties of the grbs and their sne in order to look for indications of a preferred mechanism .",
    "we compare the energies of grbs , xrfs , and their accompanying sne . in section 2.1",
    "we estimate the intrinsic energy of low - redshift grbs ( @xmath11 ) with associated sne by applying a correction for the jet opening angle to the observed @xmath12-ray energies . in section 2.2",
    "we estimate the energy in relativistic ejecta as probed by radio data . in section 2.3",
    "we compare both of these to the sn @xmath3  as derived from modelling . in section 3",
    "we present our results . in section 4",
    "we extend the comparison to all grbs at higher redshift for which a sn was reported and discuss our findings .",
    "isotropic - equivalent energies ( @xmath13 ) of nearby grbs connected with well - studied sne are extremely diverse .",
    "grb980425 had a very low @xmath13 , which was one of the aspects that raised doubts on the reality of the first grb / sn association . on the other hand grb030329 , associated with sn2003dh , was similar to many long grbs .",
    "grb130427a has @xmath13@xmath14erg , comparable to cosmological grbs .",

    "an achromatic break may indicate that the edge of the jet swept past our viewing point .",

    "since it is impossible to disentangle the contribution to the radio emission by the grb from that of the sn , these values must be regarded as upper limits to the sn energy .",
    "no radio observations are available for grb120422a / sn2012bz .",

    "this is also supported by the fact that the bolometric light curve maximum of sn2013cq , which was accurately measured with hst @xcite , is consistent with that of sn1998bw . for sn2013dx ,",

    "for sn2010bh it was estimated by @xcite .",
    "all these @xmath3  assume spherical symmetry .",
    "however , we know from the distribution of elements ( in particular fe and o as observed through their nebular emission lines ) that at least sn1998bw was significantly aspherical , and was observed near the direction of most rapid expansion , which is consistent with the detection of the grb @xcite .",
    "therefore , spherically symmetric @xmath3are likely to be overestimated . using 2d explosion models and 3d radiation transport calculations , @xcite and @xcite found that the real sn @xmath3  may be a factor of 2 - 5 smaller .",
    "this correction , which is not shown in fig .",
    "1 , would cause the six grb / sne to cluster around @xmath3@xmath62erg .",
    "the @xmath3  of the two xrf / sne do not require a correction , because there is no evidence for asymmetry in sn2006aj @xcite .",
    "we can now compare the various energies .    in fig .",

    "@xmath15 values still cover 3 orders of magnitude , and are always significantly smaller than any sn @xmath3   ( the diagonal line is @xmath3  @xmath63 ) .",

    "1b shows @xmath18vs the sn @xmath3 .",
    "again , the sn energy is always much larger .    finally , fig .",
    "1c shows the @xmath18v .",
    "@xmath15 . the grb energies estimated from the jet break and from the radio , which rely on different wavebands and on observations taken at completely different times , are in general agreement , but the sn @xmath3  are much larger than both .",
    "this confirms that @xmath18is a good proxy for @xmath15 , but not for either the sn @xmath3or the total energy of the event .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "well - studied grb / sne have a roughly standard energy , @xmath3@xmath24(1 - 2)@xmath64erg , if account is taken for asphericity .",
    "xrf / sne have a smaller @xmath3by about a factor of 10 .",
    "all sn @xmath3  are much larger than all of the grb / xrf @xmath15 , which seem to be capped at a few @xmath19erg .",
    "this suggests that the grb / sn phenomenon is driven by the sn , not the grb jet .",
    "this evidence challenges a picture in which the relativistic jet explodes the star .",
    "simulations @xcite have shown that the jet can unbind the star , but it is not clear how the jet can transfer the required large @xmath3  to the star once it has escaped without @xmath15 increasing to unreasonably large values .",
    "also , it may be less natural for grb jets to produce sne with always the same total @xmath3  and the same amount of @xmath6ni  to such a degree @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the energetics of grb / sne are strikingly similar to the rotational energy of a millisecond magnetar .",
    "the rotational energy of a rapidly rotating ns is @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the ns mass , @xmath67 its radius and @xmath68 its spin period .",
    "rotational energy can be tapped by rapid spindown on a grb timescale if the magnetic field is in the magnetar range ( @xmath69 g ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this leads us to propose that in grb / sne the exploding star gives birth to a highly magnetized millisecond ns .",
    "deposited magnetar energy can further energize the sn , and @xmath3  @xmath70erg is a limit to the total intrinsic energy of grb / sne .",
    "this limit has not been violated by any grb / sn so far , if they are all aspherical .",
    "magnetar outflows can be focussed into magnetic jets by interaction with the stellar envelope because hoop stress tends to collimate the flow after it comes into pressure equilibrium with the shocked stellar cavity from which the magnetar formed .",
    "the collimated magnetic wind ( which is sometimes called a `` magnetic tower '' and is similar to the collimation of pulsar wind nebulae such as the crab nebula ) can burrow its way out of the star .",
    "a very small fraction of the total energy is seen to emerge in the relativistic jet .",
    "if a large fraction of the magnetar energy can be transferred to the progenitor star , mostly near the jet axis @xcite , it can be added to the sn energy .",
    "the energy deposited also contributes to increasing the isotropic component of the sn @xmath3",
    "the sn can take on an increasingly aspherical shape the higher the energy contribution from the magnetar ( grb / sne are more aspherical than xrf / sne , * ? ? ?",
    "in this scenario , @xmath6ni  may be produced as the expanding magnetar wind shocks the inner star .",
    "if this happens quasi - spherically , before the star expands too much , sufficient material can be shocked to produce the several @xmath71 of @xmath6ni  in an almost spherical distribution required by grb / sn light curves @xcite . the collimated magnetic wind may produce some more @xmath6ni  at high velocities , as also required by the rapid rise of grb / sn light curves .",
    "the late - time deposition of magnetar energy may also contribute to the sn light curve , along with @xmath6ni .",
    "late - time spectra of more grb / sne would be necessary to clarify how much @xmath6ni  is actually produced through the observation of emission lines of fe . presently this information is only available for the nearest event , sn1998bw @xcite .",
    "the range of grb prompt emission energy could be produced by interaction of the jet as it propagates through the stellar envelope .",
    "a range of several orders of magnitude in @xmath15 may be possible , since the jet may be slowed down to variable degrees by the development of instabilities or by interaction with extended outer layers of the star .",
    "small amounts of baryons mixed into the jet can  pollute \" it and reduce its @xmath12-ray luminosity .",
    "an extended envelope may even block the jet altogether @xcite .",
    "magnetars have been proposed to energise x - ray flashes ( xrf ) and their associated sneic @xcite .",
    "xrf / sne have less extreme properties than grb / sne , in particular they have smaller @xmath3   ( a few @xmath9erg ) , luminosities [ m(@xmath6ni)@xmath72 , only marginally larger than in ordinary core - collapse sne ] , and progenitor masses ( @xmath73 , * ? ? ?",
    "they are less aspherical than grb / sne @xcite",
    ". they may be the result of lower - spin magnetars .",
    "the progenitors of grb / sne are thought to be stars of m@xmath74 .",
    "if grb / sne are also powered by magnetars then at least some of these stars also collapse to ns .",
    ", if the remnant is a ns instead masses may have to be revised downwards slightly . ] since grbs and xrfs exhibit a continuum of properties , this picture reconciles their appearance with their origin as a single mechanism .",
    "indeed , @xcite find that jets are always produced when a proto - ns is formed , if the magnetic field is very high .",
    "direct collapse to a bh may not necessarily lead to a luminous sn .",
    "the @xmath6niproduced by the disk wind @xcite could be highly variable and may accrete into the bh , in the spirit of the initial proposal of a  failed sn \" @xcite .",
    "this may be the case of the 2 low - redshift grbs , 060614 and 060505 , which showed no sn down to m(@xmath6ni ) @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "fallback of @xmath6ni  onto the bh is one possibility @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "both of these grbs have @xmath15 well below the magnetar limit .",
