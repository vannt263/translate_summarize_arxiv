    "from eq . ( [ disp ] ) is is apparent that typically the neutrino contribution ( with or without neutrino oscillations ) is a perturbation to the ion - acoustic waves , due to the small value @xmath78 of the fermi constant .",

    "we get @xmath90 it is interesting to note that for a muonic - neutrino beam ( @xmath91 ) the neutrino oscillations term completely dominates the instability .",
    "this is to be expected , since the muon - neutrinos do not couple to the electrons , so that the plasma is affected by the neutrino beams only because of the flavor conversion when some muon - neutrinos gradually become electron - neutrinos in this case .    for the dense plasmas under consideration",

    "in addition , the parameters of figure [ figure ] are still non - relativistic to a good approximation , with a thermal relativistic factor @xmath114 .",
    "finally , the plasma can be also taken as non - degenerate to reasonable accuracy , with a fermi energy @xmath115 . to include degeneracy effects ,",
    "the equation of state of an isothermal degenerate fermi gas would be required , with the net effect @xcite of the replacement of @xmath116 by a generalized ion - acoustic velocity @xmath117 given by @xmath118}{l_{1/2}[-\\exp(\\beta\\mu_0)]}\\right)^{1/2 } \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath119 , @xmath120 is the polylogarithm function @xcite of index @xmath121 with @xmath122 , and @xmath123 is the equilibrium chemical potential . when @xmath124 , the polylogarithm function can be defined as @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the gamma function .",

    "however , obviously other specific cases should be checked with care , both for relativistic and fermi pressure effects .",
    "furthermore , one might wonder about the relevance of quantum diffraction effects , contained in the bohm potential @xcite .",
    "this term induces @xcite a correction of the order @xmath131 to @xmath132 , so that we can estimate a dimensionless quantum diffraction parameter defined by @xmath133 therefore quantum diffraction effects are completely negligible at least for the long , macroscopic wavelengths under consideration .",
    "finally , it should be realized that an essential ingredient of the treatment is the anisotropic part of the neutrino velocities distribution corresponding to the neutrino beam .",
    "the radial flux from the exterior of the neutrinosphere , at long distances from the center , has a small angular spread so that it can be treated as a collimated beam @xcite .",
