    "construction of examples and classification of triply periodic minimal surfaces in @xmath0 constitute a very active field of research in differential geometry .",
    "such surfaces correspond , via universal covering , to minimal embeddings of closed orientable surfaces into a flat torus @xmath1 .",
    "as originally conjectured by meeks , see @xcite , it is known that every closed surface of genus greater than or equal to @xmath2 admits a minimal embedding in a flat torus , see @xcite .",
    "interestingly enough , triply periodic minimal surfaces appear naturally in several applied sciences , including physics , chemistry , and crystallography , see for instance @xcite . g. e. schrder - turk , a. fogden , and s. t. hyde @xcite studied one - parameter families of triply periodic minimal surfaces in @xmath0 .",
    "these families which are called h - family , rpd - family , tp - family , td - family , and tclp - family , contain many classical examples ( schwarz p - surface , schwarz d - surface , schwarz h - surface , and schwarz clp - surface ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to give an abstract proof of the existence of infinitely many new examples of triply periodic minimal embeddings of a closed orientable surface @xmath3 of genus @xmath2 into some flat @xmath2-torus ( theorems a and [ thm : mainbiftheorem ] ) , using perturbation techniques , and in particular bifurcation theory .",
    "the way to a development of a bifurcation theory in this context was paved by some recent numerical results of n. ejiri and t. shoda , see @xcite , who use a finite dimensional approach to compute the nullity and the morse index for the above families of minimal embeddings .",
    "let us describe more precisely the result discussed in this paper . given a one - parameter family @xmath4a_0-\\varepsilon , a_0+\\varepsilon\\right[\\ni a\\mapsto g_a$ ] of ( unit volume ) flat metrics in @xmath1 , and a one - parameter family @xmath5 of @xmath6-minimal embeddings @xmath7 ,",
    "then a _ bifurcating branch of minimal embeddings converging to @xmath8 _ for the family @xmath9 consists of :    * a sequence @xmath10 tending to @xmath11 as @xmath12 ; * a sequence @xmath13 of embeddings , where @xmath14 is @xmath15-minimal for all @xmath16 ,    such that    * @xmath17 in some suitable @xmath18-topology , with @xmath19 ; * @xmath14 is not _",
    "congruent _ to @xmath20 for all @xmath16 .",
    "let us also recall that two embeddings @xmath21 are congruent if one is obtained from the other by a change of parameterization of @xmath3 and by a translation of @xmath1 , i.e. , if there exists a diffeomorphism @xmath22 of @xmath3 and @xmath23 such that @xmath24 .",
    "in the situation above , we say that @xmath11 is a _ bifurcation instant _ for the family @xmath9 .",
    "an important related notion is that of _ local rigidity _ for a family of minimal embeddings , which will be discussed in section  [ sec : locrigidity ] , based on the notion of _ equivariant nondegeneracy _",
    ", see definition  [ thm : defequivnondegeneracy ]",
    ".    we will recall in section  [ sec : applications ] the definitions of the h - family , the rpd - family , the tp - family , the td - family and the tclp - family of triply periodic minimal embeddings .",
    "the precise statement of the main result proved in the present paper is the following :    there is one bifurcation instant for the h - family , and two bifurcation instants for the rpd - family , the tp - family , and the td - family .",
    "estimates of the above bifurcation instants are obtained using the numerical results of @xcite .",
    "the proof of theorem  a is based on some techniques of equivariant bifurcation theory ( see theorem  [ thm : mainbiftheorem ] ) , and it also employs some recent results obtained in @xcite for the computation of morse index and nullity of minimal embeddings in the above families .",
    "a few remarks on our proof are in order .",
    "the first important issue is the question of _ degeneracy _ of the minimal embeddings in the above families , caused by the symmetries of the ambient space @xmath1 .",
    "every minimal embedding admits a three dimensional space of ( non trivial ) jacobi fields , coming from the killing fields of the ambient , which implies that each one of the embeddings is a degenerate critical point of the area functional .",
    "recall that standard variational bifurcation assumptions require nondegeneracy at the endpoints of the path , which fails to hold in this situation .",
    "the central technical part of the paper consists in the construction of an alternative functional framework , suitable to handle such degenerate situation . to this aim , we use an idea originally introduced by kapouleas to prove an implicit function theorem for constant mean curvature embeddings , which consists in considering a `` perturbed '' mean curvature function @xmath25 of an embedding , see section  [ sec : framework ] for details . such a function vanishes identically exactly at minimal embeddings ( proposition  [ thm : kapouleas ] ) , nevertheless maintains its differential surjective at possibly degenerate minimal embeddings , provided that the degeneracy arises exclusively from the ambient symmetries ( proposition  [ eq : fredholmnesst ] ) .",
    "we call _ equivariantly nondegenerate _ a minimal embedding along which every jacobi field arises from a killing field of the ambient space",
    ". a direct application of an equivariant implicit function theorem to the equation @xmath26 gives a local rigidity result for each of the above families of minimal embeddings in neighborhoods of equivariantly nondegenerate embeddings ( theorem  [ thm : ift ] ) . as a corollary of theorem  [ thm : ift ] , we prove the following :    [ thm : localrigidity ] every minimal surface in the tclp - family , as well as any surfaces in the h - family , the tp - family , the td - family , and the rpd - family whose nullity is equal to @xmath2 , belongs to a ( unique up to homotheties ) smooth locally rigid @xmath27-parameter family of pairwise non - homothetic triply periodic minimal surfaces .",
    "[ thm : remmeeks ] it is interesting to observe that w. meeks proved in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 7.1 ) that every triply periodic minimal surface of genus @xmath2 for which the ramified values of the gauss map consist of @xmath28 antipodal pairs in the @xmath29-sphere , belongs to a real @xmath27-dimensional family of triply periodic minimal surfaces of genus @xmath2 .",
    "every surface in the tclp - family , the tp - family , the td - family , and the rpd family belongs to the class of surfaces to which ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 7.1 ) applies .",
    "thus , for each surface @xmath30 with nullity three in these families , the @xmath27-parameter family of triply periodic minimal surfaces that contains @xmath31 given in theorem  b coincides with meeks family . for these examples ,",
    "the new information provided by our results , besides a different approach to the proof , is the local rigidity property of these families around surfaces with nullity equal to @xmath2 , and the lack of local rigidity around surfaces with nullity larger than @xmath2 .",
    "[ thm : remmoregenerally ] the existence of a @xmath27-parameter family of triply periodic minimal surfaces containing a given one is obtained in theorem  [ thm : ift ] , more generally , near each embedded triply periodic minimal surface with genus greater than one and with nullity equal to three .",
    "the classical example of schoen s gyroid does not satisfy the assumptions of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 7.1 ) ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* remark 7.2 ) ) .",
    "however , since it belongs to the associate family of @xmath32 and @xmath33-surfaces ( example [ exa : pdg ] ) , it has nullity equal to @xmath2 , and theorem  [ thm : ift ] applies in this situation .",
    "[ thm : localrigidityc ] schoen s gyroid belongs to a ( unique up to homotheties ) smooth locally rigid @xmath27-parameter family of pairwise non - homothetic triply periodic minimal surfaces .",
    "we remark that the existence of a family of deformations for the triply periodic minimal surfaces considered in theorem  b and theorem  c above can also be deduced from ejiri s results in @xcite .",
    "actually , while we obtain the results via an equivariant implicit function theorem , @xcite uses a different approach , and it gives a more explicit description of the deformation space .    as an undesired drawback in our bifurcation setup ,",
    "we need to observe that the pde : @xmath34 defined in the space of `` unparameterized embeddings '' of @xmath3 into @xmath1 , is _ not _ variational , i.e. , it is not the euler  lagrange equation of some variational problem ( recall that the standard mean curvature function is the gradient of the area functional ) .",
    "this entails that , in order to carry out our project , we have to resort to more general bifurcation theory for fredholm operators ( see appendix  [ sub : bifresult ] ) , which provides results somewhat weaker than variational bifurcation theorems .",
    "more specifically , rather than the classical `` jump of morse index '' assumption , in the non variational case one has to postulate the less general ( and intuitive ) `` odd crossing number '' condition for the eigenvalues of the linearized problem . in particular , we can only infer the existence of bifurcating branches at those instants at which the jump of the morse index is an _",
    "integer , leaving undecided the existence of a bifurcating branch at a certain degeneracy instant ( @xmath35 ) for the h - family , where the jump of morse index is equal to @xmath29 , see section  [ sec : applications ] .    after establishing our general bifurcation result for minimal embeddings into flat @xmath2-tori ( theorem  [ thm : mainbiftheorem ] ) , a proof of theorem  a is obtained readily ( section  [ sec : applications ] ) by applying the results of @xcite , where the nullity and the morse index of the minimal embeddings in the given families are computed .    in section  [ sec :",
    "remarks ] , we will present an analysis of the type of bifurcation occurring at the bifurcation instants determined in theorem  a. we will show that for the @xmath36-family , the degeneracy instant corresponds to a _",
    "transcritical bifurcation _ , which does not produce _ essentially new _ triply periodic minimal surfaces .",
    "this is due to the fact that , around the degenerate instant where bifurcation occurs , the homothety class of the flat metric on the torus does not depend bijectively on the parameter of the family , see remark  [ thm : remgenuinebifurcation ] .",
    "the same situation occurs at one of the two bifurcation instants of the families rpd , tp and td . on the other hand ,",
    "the second bifurcation instant of each of these three families is _ genuine _ , in the sense that the bifurcation branch that issues from these instants consists of triply periodic minimal surfaces that are not homothetic to any other member of the family .    as a final remark",
    ", we would like to observe that a full - fledged bifurcation theory for triply periodic minimal surfaces in @xmath0 will require a further development of the results exposed here . in first place , it would be interesting to extend the existence result to degeneracy instants corresponding to _ even _ jumps of the morse index , which is very likely a matter of applying finer bifurcation results .",
    "the second point would be to study the topology of the bifurcating branches , like connectedness , cardinality , regularity , etc .",
    ", which ultimately depends on the behavior of the eigenvalues of the jacobi operator near zero ( derivative , transversal crossing ) .",
    "an important question to assess is establishing the pitchfork picture of the bifurcation set , and the stability / instability of minimal surfaces in the bifurcating branches .",
    "note that a triply periodic minimal surface that divides @xmath37 into two parts is said to be stable if the second variation of the area is nonnegative for all volume - preserving variations as a compact surface in @xmath37 with the corresponding metric . here , by volume it is meant the volume of each part of @xmath37 divided by the surface .",
    "for instance , the schwarz @xmath32 and @xmath33 surfaces and schoen s gyroid are stable ( ross @xcite )",
    ".    finally , it would be very interesting to study the geometry of the new triply periodic minimal surfaces in the bifurcating branches issuing from the genuine bifurcation instants along the rpd , the tp and the td family .",
