    "studies of electromagnetic interactions with extended particles , such as mesons and baryons , often involve the use of ( off - shell ) form factors to account for internal structure not explicit in models , or to regularize quantities which would otherwise be divergent .",
    "the general structures of the @xmath0nn @xcite and @xmath1nn @xcite three - point vertices allowed based on the symmetries of the strong and electromagnetic interactions have been known for decades .",
    "of particular importance for electromagnetic interactions is gauge invariance as expressed by the ward - takahashi identities @xcite .",
    "there is a vast literature on the subject of form factors in meson production ranging from attempts @xcite to satisfy the half - off - shell ward - takahashi identities while at the same time using as much on - shell information as possible , to explicit model calculations @xcite which test the various prescriptions . as a rule ,",
    "these model calculations demonstrate that there are kinematical regions where the prescriptions can give drastically different results than the exact model calculations .",
    "while the most consistent way to approach this problem is through the use of field - theoretic models , it is not clear which field - theory approach to use in the resonance region .",
    "although chiral perturbation theory can be used near threshold @xcite , it is expected to converge slowly , or not at all , at higher energies .",
    "thus , many recent fits to meson photoproduction data have been less ambitious , and have assumed that a phenomenological approach would be adequate for the extraction of resonance contributions .",
    "these fits have generally used tree - level diagrams which require a high - energy cutoff . while the functional form of these form factors has usually been chosen on the basis of convenience and simplicity",
    ", the resulting amplitudes should obey the constraints imposed by gauge invariance , crossing and unitarity .",
    "most efforts have been directed toward the maintenance of gauge invariance .",
    "crossing and unitarity are often ignored in modifications applied to tree - level diagrams , whereas unitarity is generally built into dynamical models .    in the following ,",
    "we will concentrate on the modification of tree - level diagrams .",
    "the effect of a minimal - substitution prescription , applied to the most general ( pion - nucleon ) vertex , was discussed in detail by ohta@xcite and extended by others@xcite .",
    "this work showed that a particular invariant amplitude ( @xmath2 ) would be unaltered by a wide range of form factors and meson - nucleon vertices satisfying the ward - takahashi@xcite identity .",
    "the possibility of having a form - factor modification of @xmath2 , accompanied by a gauge - invariance restoring contact term was subsequently considered in ref.@xcite .",
    "the recipe of ref.@xcite is simple to apply and has been widely adopted for use in single- and multi - channel fits to meson - photoproduction data @xcite .",
    "we find a flaw in the arguments used to derive this modification of the amplitude @xmath2 .",
    "it is , however , straightforward to find a modification of @xmath2 which _ does _ satisfy the constraints of gauge invariance and crossing symmetry .",
    "we then apply this technique to @xmath3 photoproduction to overcome the shortcomings of refs .",
    "@xcite , namely the violation of crossing symmetry .",
    "we also show how the use of our prescription can alter the conclusions of a phenomenological analysis .",
    "we begin by recalling the basic results given in ref.@xcite . there",
    "the discussion was simplified by taking the simplest ( pseudoscalar ) @xmath4 vertex in the specific process @xmath5 .",
    "the contribution from the born diagrams corresponding to @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8channel exchanges is @xmath9 u_p \\\\   & + & 2\\sqrt{2}ge \\bar u_n { { q\\cdot \\epsilon}\\over{t - \\mu^2 } } \\gamma_5 u_p   \\nonumber \\\\   & - & \\sqrt{2}ge \\bar u_n { \\kappa_n \\over { 2 m } }   \\epsilon \\cdot \\gamma k\\cdot \\gamma { { ( p_2-k)\\cdot \\gamma + m } \\over { u - m^2 } } \\gamma_5 u_p , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 and @xmath11 represent the photon and pion four - momenta , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the respective proton and neutron four - momenta . the quantities @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the nucleon and pion masses , @xmath16 is the photon polarization vector , @xmath17 is the pseudoscalar @xmath18 coupling constant , and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the proton and neutron anomalous magnetic moments . note that in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xmath17 denoted the pseudoscalar @xmath21 coupling constant .",
    "if a strong form factor is inserted at the @xmath4 vertex of each born term , gauge invariance is clearly lost .",
    "the following term violates gauge invariance : @xmath22 u_p \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath23 is a general form factor . from ohtas@xcite relations ,",
    "the term required to restore gauge invariance is @xmath24     + { { 2 q\\cdot \\epsilon } \\over { t-\\mu^2 } } [ f(m^2,m^2 , \\mu^2 ) - f(m^2 , m^2 , t ) ] \\right ] u_p,\\ ] ] with @xmath25 .",
    "this precisely cancels the form factor effect on the terms in eq .  2 .",
    "writing this in terms of invariant amplitudes @xmath26 with the explicitly gauge invariant representation @xmath27 noting that such a representation is only possible for a gauge invariant amplitude , we have @xmath28 thus , one sees that the @xmath2 amplitude is unaltered by form factors , within ohta s prescription for retaining gauge invariance .",
    "the result holds for a more general pion - nucleon vertex and any charge channel .",
    "of course , this result does not prevent the addition of terms which are individually gauge invariant .    since form factors were added to provide a cutoff for the born term contributions ,",
    "this result is somewhat disappointing , as the @xmath2 contribution is not damped .",
    "in addition , explicit one - loop meson calculations @xcite show that the @xmath2 amplitude is modified . in ref.@xcite , a form factor for @xmath2",
    "was inserted and the addition of a contact interaction was proposed to restore gauge invariance .",
    "we give this recipe below , show why it has a problem , and then propose an alternate form .",
    "the result is then generalized using crossing symmetry .",
    "in ref .  @xcite a gauge invariant term , @xmath29 , was added and subtracted from a set of born terms with form factors at the strong vertices .",
    "this resulted in the replacement @xmath30 above , with a remaining gauge - invariance - violating term @xmath31 u_p \\ ; , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which was to be cancelled by a _ contact _ interaction .    by requiring this additional term to be free of poles ,",
    "i.e. , a contact term , we can constrain the functional form of @xmath32 . denoting @xmath33 , with similar abbreviations for @xmath34 and @xmath35 ,",
    "subject to the constraints @xmath36 the general form for @xmath32 used in ref.@xcite was @xmath37 subject to @xmath38 .",
    "this form has been used in many recent analyses of photonic and multi - channel reactions off the nucleon @xcite . however , it is straightforward to demonstrate that this recipe results in a term with pole contributions , and is therefore incorrect because it can not be cancelled by a contact term . taking @xmath39 , and inserting @xmath32 into the relation for @xmath40 ,",
    "one can easily see the problem .",
    "choosing , for example , the point @xmath41 does not fix the value of @xmath42 , which is only constrained by the condition @xmath43 . as a consequence , when @xmath44 it is not necessarily the case that @xmath45 = 1 . as a result , the pole terms are not cancelled , except for zero photon energy , as noted by the authors . to ensure cancellation of the poles ,",
    "the needed constraint is , in this case , @xmath46 which does not , however , imply that @xmath47 = 1 for all @xmath48 and @xmath49 . for example , the following choice @xmath50 satisfies the above constraint .",
    "note that this method can be easily adapted to charged kaon production .",
    "so far , we have only considered constraints provided by gauge invariance and the pole structure of the amplitude . however",
    ", crossing symmetry is also important .",
    "as the @xmath51 channel is closely related to the @xmath52 channel via crossing , let us therefore consider the isospin channel @xmath53 defined by , is discussed below . ]",
    "@xmath54 inserting strong form factors , the matrix element for the electric born terms is @xmath55 after some rearrangement , this may be written as @xmath56 u_1 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & eg \\hat f ( s , u , t ) \\bar{u}_2 { m_2 \\over ( t-\\mu^2 ) } \\left [ { 1 \\over s - m^2 } - { 1 \\over u - m^2 } \\right ] u_1 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\epsilon \\cdot \\delta m \\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 are the gauge invariant operators defined in eq .",

    "the use of different form factor schemes can have a significant effect on phenomenological fits to data .",
    "this is particularly clear in kaon photoproduction where the rapid increase of a point - like born contribution to this quantity is well known .",
    "the point - like born term contribution to the total cross section ( solid ) is compared to the data @xcite in fig .  1 using a @xmath69 coupling of 7.5 @xcite .",
    "an attempt to cure this , by modifying individual multipoles , was described in ref.@xcite . using the minimal substitution prescription of ohta@xcite ( dotted ) , which damps all but the @xmath2 amplitude , one still obtains a born contribution which grows too rapidly . here",

    "finally , we show in fig .  1 the result arising from our modification of the haberzettl form ( dashed ) .",
    "in addition to @xmath64 given above , we also need @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "we take @xmath72 to be of the form of eq .",
    "( [ fhat ] ) with @xmath74^{-1 } \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the kaon mass and we again take @xmath71 = 1 gev .    finally , we consider the fits to @xmath3 photoproduction performed in refs.@xcite . in these studies ,",
    "the born terms were added and compared to possible resonance contributions . the use of a coupling , @xmath75 , within the range of values , @xmath76 , estimated in this work@xcite results in an ( undamped ) born contribution exceeding the data @xcite by a large factor , as is demonstrated by the solid line in fig .  2 ( here , @xmath75 = 1.9 ) .",
    "there is more than one way to interpret this result .",
    "one possibility is that @xmath75 is much smaller than estimated in ref .",
    "a different possibility is that @xmath75 is in the range given above , but the _ effective _ @xmath75 is much smaller than @xmath75 at the nucleon pole . in other words ,",
    "as the proton and eta - prime are extended objects , form factors enter at the three - point vertices , and as these data are far from the nucleon pole , form factor effects can be significant . finally , there are almost certainly other reaction mechanisms such as resonance exchanges , vector meson exchanges , and possibly contact terms .    in the original analysis of the @xmath3 data @xcite ,",
    "the born terms were multiplied by an overall form factor given by eq .",
    "( [ ff ] ) with @xmath71 = 1.1 gev . in this model ,",
    "the dominant contribution to the model was from the _ background _ of the d13(2080 ) resonance , and the born terms played a minor role .",
    "the resulting total cross section from the born terms is shown by the dashed ( nearly zero ) line in fig .  2 .",
    "on the other hand , taking @xmath75 = 3.5 and @xmath71 = 2 gev , it was shown that one could qualitatively reproduce the total cross section with just born terms ( dotted line ) @xcite .",
    "however , the procedure of multiplying the born terms by an overall form factor violates crossing symmetry and the amplitude has the wrong residue structure , and therefore is theoretically unacceptable .",
    "other inconsistencies of this procedure have been discussed in refs .",
    "thus , it is not clear what conclusions , if any , can be drawn from the dashed and dotted curves in fig .  2 .",
    "using ohta s @xcite method , one obtains a crossing symmetric amplitude , but as above the @xmath2 amplitude is not modified . using our modification of the haberzettl form ,",
    "the electric born terms are @xmath77 \\ ; , \\nonumber \\\\ a_2 & = & { 2eg_{\\eta^{\\prime } } \\over ( s - m^2)(u - m^2 ) } \\hat{f}(s , u)\\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath78 = 1 . in this case",
    ", the constraints on @xmath79 are @xmath80 from the condition to remove the poles , and @xmath79 = @xmath81 from crossing symmetry .",
    "note that this form is also valid for @xmath82 and @xmath83 production , and the electric born terms for isoscalar production of pions , defined by @xmath84 can be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ etaamp ] ) using the replacement @xmath85 @xmath65 @xmath17/2 . with this form",
    ", the born terms in @xmath3 production can be sufficiently damped at high energies even for the largest estimated value of @xmath85 .",
    "for example , taking @xmath86 with @xmath64 given by eq .",
    "( [ ff ] ) , and using the upper limit for @xmath75 with a cutoff of 700 mev , the total cross section from the born terms levels off at about 0.2 @xmath15b at a photon energy of 2 gev . furthermore , and this is the essential point , it is _ not possible _ to reproduce the total cross section shape here with only born terms and reasonable values for @xmath71 ( 500 to 2000 mev ) , in contrast to the non - crossing symmetry model of ref.@xcite .",
    "thus , the use of the present , more restrictive , form factor prescription narrows the possible interpretations of experimental data .",
    "it is known in field theory @xcite that off - shell form factors are not unique and are closely related to contact terms . for different representations of the fields ,",
    "the form factors and contact terms differ , but the differences cancel out in the calculation of a physical scattering amplitude . in the case of dispersion relations",
    "@xcite , the nonuniqueness of the off - shell form factors is reflected in the a priori unknown number of needed subtractions @xcite .",
    "for the phenomenological amplitudes presented here , it is also possible to shift form factor effects to contact terms . to illustrate this , recall that @xmath87 = 1 and we may write , for example , for the @xmath88 term in eq .",
    "( [ etaamp ] ) , @xmath89 \\ ; .\\ ] ] the first two terms above are recognized as the undamped born terms , while the last two terms correspond to contact terms since the pole is cancelled as @xmath48 or @xmath42 @xmath65 @xmath90 . as previously noted ,",
    "the @xmath2 amplitude is not modified in ohta s method @xcite , but his method does not forbid the inclusion of an additional gauge invariant contact term . our modification of haberzettl s procedure is equivalent to adding the gauge invariant contact term , @xmath91 to the amplitude of ref .",
    "@xcite ( eq .",
    "( [ as ] ) of this work ) . here , @xmath92 is the gauge invariant operator defined in eq .",
    "( [ invamp ] ) and @xmath2 is given by the second equation of eqs .",
    "( [ as ] ) .    finally , let us note that most authors assume that the form factors are real , and the phenomenological results presented here are also obtained using real form factors . in general",
    ", however , arguments based on unitarity @xcite show that the off - shell form factors must be complex above the one - pion threshold . on the other hand , there is some justification for using real form factors if one adopts a k - matrix approach to the scattering amplitude @xcite .",
    "we have found a flaw in the gauging procedure of ref .",
    "@xcite and have noted that the method used in refs .",
    "@xcite is theoretically unacceptable as it violates crossing symmetry .",
    "we have determined the general constraints @xmath72 must satisfy for the gauge - violating term to be a contact term , which then can be cancelled by a contact term .",
    "this method was generalized to be consistent with crossing symmetry and applied to @xmath3 photoproduction .",
    "this model is theoretically superior to previous works @xcite and has the important phenomenological consequence that the total cross section can not be interpreted as arising solely from the born terms , in contrast to ref .",
