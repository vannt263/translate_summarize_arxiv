    "clusters of galaxies are the biggest virialized structures in the universe , that form at a relatively late time ( @xmath11 ) . in the hierarchical scenario ,",
    "the cosmic structures evolve hierarchically from the primordial density fluctuations , that are amplified and then collapse and merge to form larger systems under the action of gravity .",
    "the cosmic baryons fall into the gravitational potential of the cluster dark matter halo formed in this way , while the collapse and subsequent shocks heat up the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) to the virial temperature ( @xmath12 kev ) . in the adiabatic scenario ,",
    "the gravity is the only responsible of the physical properties of the galaxy clusters , once they are rescaled with respect to their masses and epoch of formation ( @xcite ) .",
    "x - ray properties of galaxy clusters show , however , some deviations form this scenario , breaking up the self - similarity predicted by the adiabatic model ( see recent work in @xcite and reference therein ) . in particular , in the last years , the studies about x - ray scaling relations ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and observations of the entropy profiles ( @xcite ; @xcite ) in groups and clusters of galaxies , and the analysis of simulated sources with an extra non - gravitational energy injection ( @xcite ) have suggested that we have to account for further non - gravitational feedback beyond the gravitational energy .",
    "the gas entropy records the thermodynamic history of the icm as the product of both gravitational and non - gravitational processes , shaping its observed structure accordingly ( @xcite ) .",
    "the measurements of the gas entropy at 0.1 @xmath13 ( hereafter @xmath14 ) showed that the observed value of @xmath15 is higher than the expected one from the adiabatic scenario @xcite , where @xmath15 should scale simply with the mean temperature of the virialized systems .",
    "instead , an excess in the entropy , with respect to the prediction of the adiabatic model , is observed in the inner regions of groups and poor clusters at some fraction of @xmath13 .",
    "this excess sets a minimum value of the entropy , labeled as entropy `` floor '' or `` ramp '' , associated to the ambient gas .",
    "the presence of this minimum level of entropy calls for some energetic mechanism , not referable to the gravity only , that falls into three main classes : preheating , where the gas collapsing into the dark matter potential well is preheated by some sources , before clusters were assembled at an early epoch @xcite ; local heating by , e.g. , agn activity , star formation or supernovae @xcite ; cooling , which seems to be able to remove low - entropy gas in the centre of the clusters , producing a similar effect to non - gravitational heating @xcite .    in the present work",
    ", we aim to confront the model of preheating , feedback and cooling with the observed properties of the gas and of the dark matter in x - ray luminous galaxy clusters , by putting constraints on the sources of non - gravitational heating . to do that",
    ", we have considered the sample of 24 clusters presented in @xcite , hereafter paper i. to quantify the excess of energy stored in the icm with respect to the amount available from the gravitational potential , we compare the gas and dark matter temperature profile and measure the energy feedback as a function of the radial distance .",
    "moreover , the clusters in our sample span a wide range of redshift ( @xmath16 ) and have different state of relaxation .",
    "we can thus investigate the dependence of the extra - gravitational energy feedback on the cosmic time of differently evolved structures .",

    ", we divide our sample in three categories , depending on the strength of the central cooling - core ( see table  [ tabdon ] ) :    * * strong cooling core ( scc ) * clusters are the 6 objects in which the central cooling time is significantly less than the age of the universe at the cluster redshift ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "they show very low central temperature ( @xmath45 kev ) and strong spike of luminosity in the brightness profile , and a very pronounced drop of the temperature near the boundary of the observation , about a factor two compared with the peak of the temperature .",
    "the temperature profile is very regular , suggesting a relaxed dynamical state . * * intermediate cooling core ( icc ) * clusters have a central cooling time with values @xmath46 .",
    "the six objects in our sample show a less prominent spike of brightness than scc clusters and a mild drop of the temperature in the cooling region ( @xmath47 ) . *",
    "the * non - cooling core ( ncc ) * sources ( 12 objects in our sample ) have central cooling time higher than @xmath48 and do not present any evidence of the central drop in the temperature profile . both the temperature profile and surface brightness map are less regular than the ones observed in cc systems , showing hints of substructures and merging activity .",
    "the gas and dm density profiles ( right panel of figure  [ entps3 ] ) have similar slopes over the entire radial range in the scc clusters , whereas less self - similarity is present in the icc and especially in the ncc clusters : the gas density profile is here flatter than the @xmath49 one , supporting the scenario in which the icm has been affected by some form of non - gravitational energy .",
    "we discuss the physical interpretation of these observational results in section  [ snnen0 ] .",
    "the high level of relaxation of the scc sources is also confirmed by the study of the polytrophic index @xmath50 , is calculated as @xmath51 by linear fit in the @xmath52 plane by considering the spectral deprojected density @xmath53 and temperature @xmath54 described in sect .",

    "we obtain good agreement between the entropy measurements in zw3146 and a1914 , the former being an example of a typical cc source where the profile decreases moving inward , whereas the latter shows the most evident case of flattening , with hints of inversion , in the central entropy values .",
    "given the good agreement between @xmath70 and @xmath66 even in the internal regions , we believe that this inversion is not due to our approach , but it is real in a1914 ( similar behaviour is found in a773 ) . we note that , if we use the entropy recovered by using the proper cooling function in eq .

    "we note that the larger deviations between @xmath37 and @xmath54 are observed in ncc clusters within 100 kpc , where we expect higher relative contribution from non - thermal effects due to , e.g. , merging activity . therefore , even though the most prominent substructures identified in the cluster images were masked , implying that we have reduced their effects in the temperature reconstruction under the hydrostatic equilibrium equation , the sampled gas might be still subjected to ongoing merging processes .",
    "the higher value of @xmath73 compared to @xmath70 in the cluster centre is likely due to a very flat density profile that induces a higher temperature value ( once the hydrostatic equilibrium equation is applied ) than the spectral deprojected temperature . indeed",
    ", unresolved mergers could lead to this very flat density profile ( they are clearly visible in a520 and a2163 ) , if the gas at @xmath75 kpc is not wholly relaxed and in hydrostatic equilibrium . for the other ncc sources , that do not show clearly ongoing merging processes",
    ", nevertheless we noted a disturbed morphology , as indicated , for example , from the fact that the centroid of symmetry does not coincide with the peak of brightness .    on larger scales , that involve larger cluster volumes , local deviations from the hydrostatic equilibrium",
    "are washed out even in the most unrelaxed objects , making tenable the hypothesis upon which @xmath66 is obtained .",
    "this is also confirmed from ( i ) the agreement between @xmath73 and @xmath76 ( @xmath77 and @xmath54 ) measured in these sources , ( ii ) the results of hydrodynamical numerical simulations @xcite , and ( iii ) the analysis presented in paper i ( sect .",

    "no significant evolution with @xmath190 of @xmath210 ( probability of null correlation @xmath211 ) and @xmath212 ( @xmath213 ) is measured .",
    "instead , we observe a strong segregation between ssc , icc and ncc sources , with scc clusters that tend to have higher metallicity mass by a factor of @xmath214 within @xmath180 and by an order of magnitude within @xmath215 , which roughly corresponds to the cooling region .",
    "the iron mass excess associated with cool core regions could be entirely produced by the brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) , which is always found at the centre of cool core clusters , via sn- or agn- induced winds @xcite .",
    "moreover , we confirm the existence of a correlation between @xmath216 and @xmath217 . in fig .",
    "[ entps3bw ] , we present the correlation between the @xmath218 as a function of the entropy pedestal @xmath110 ( see sect .  [ snnen00 ] ) : we can see an anti - correlation between the two quantities , as expected in a picture where the cooling is the likely predominant physical process in the cooling region .",
    "enrichment from recent supernovae type ia in the cd galaxies can explain the central metal abundance excess observed in cooling core clusters @xcite .",
    "on the contrary , outside the cooling region , we observe again nearly self - similar relation between @xmath219 and @xmath14 ( see fig .  [ entps3bw ] ) as we have seen in sect .",
    "[ scales1 ] for the @xmath220 relation .    assuming a synthesized iron mass per snia event @xmath221 of 0.74 @xmath222 @xcite and an energy output of @xmath223",
    ", we estimate that @xmath224 snia events in the region inside @xmath180 are required to produce @xmath225 observed in ncc clusters .",
    "this number of sne corresponds to a global energy output of @xmath226 over the entire lifetime of the cluster , that is lower by a factor 2 - 4 than the excess of energy @xmath187 estimated in sect .",
    "[ snnen0 ] ( @xmath227 ) , suggesting the action of other sources of non - gravitational energy to fully account for this observed excess .",
    "the main results emerging from our study of the entropy profiles in hot ( @xmath0 kev ) galaxy clusters at @xmath228 are that these profiles , although similar in the outskirts where they behave as a power - law with slope @xmath2 , are remarkably discrepant in the central regions , with scc objects that show a power - law behaviour down to the innermost spatially resolved regions and ncc clusters having profiles that flatten to a constant value at @xmath229 ( fig .  [ entps1 ] ) .",
    "accordingly , the comparison between gas and dark matter temperature profiles ( fig .",
    "[ entps3 ] ) reveals that scc clusters do not present any significant energy excess at any radius , whereas icc and , more dramatically , ncc objects show @xmath230 larger than few kev in the cooling region and above .",
    "note that the situation near the boundary of the sources is unclear , because the statistical errors are very large , the effect of possible anisotropies in the dm are there more prominent and we are assuming some constraints on the dark matter temperature at @xmath28 .",
    "this excess of energy with respect to the gravitational energy floor associated to the dm temperature profile can be interpreted as an indication of the presence of some form of non - gravitational energy that can constrain the mechanisms affecting the icm thermal history and the observed entropy profiles . indeed , in agreement with @xmath231 over the entire radial range",
    ", we observe that scc clusters have very low entropy pedestal values @xmath119 of few kev @xmath93 , while the higher and more scattered values of @xmath119 measured in icc and , particularly , in ncc systems can be justified by an injection of energy @xmath9 of 1 - 10 kev , that , distributed over scales @xmath232 kpc , explains also their flatter entropy profiles .",
    "the regular behaviour of the entropy profiles outside @xmath113 is also in agreement with the fact that @xmath9 is low at these radii , where we have to consider the limitations of our analysis near @xmath28 as mentioned above .",
    "this scenario is also supported from our results on the @xmath82 relation , where we observe an higher normalization , more significant in the inner regions ( @xmath84 ; see table  [ entps1a ] ) of the scc subsample with respect to icc and ncc sources .",
    "we note hints of larger entropy values at higher redshift when our measurements in cc clusters are compared to the best - fit results obtained in nearby samples , with a more significant deviations observed at @xmath113 than at @xmath79 , suggesting that cores in our cc objects are not yet well defined from the radiative processes .",
    "moreover , the observed mild differences in the slopes of the entropy profile , with @xmath131 that becomes slightly higher by considering ncc , icc , and scc sources , respectively ( @xmath233 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 for the powerlaw model ) can be explained by looking at the temperature and density profiles ( figure [ entps3 ] ) , which are a bit flatter for non - cooling core systems : this trend can be justified with small energy excess ( @xmath234 1 - 2 kev ) at large scale in the ncc objects compared to the ncc and scc ones .",
    "the radial behaviour of @xmath235 is also confirmed by the analysis made in paper i , where we noticed a strong negative evolution in the @xmath236x - ray and @xmath236sz scaling relations ( see sect .",
    "[ snnen0 ] ) .",
    "all our systems are the products of the hierarchical scenario , how is suggested from the similar behaviour of the gas temperature , density , entropy and dark matter profiles in the regions above the cores . on the contrary ,",
    "the cooling region characterizes scc , icc , and ncc systems .",
    "in particular , continuous interplay between cooling and some form of ( pre-)heating can explain the variety of the properties observed , with scc dominated from the cooling phase and , on the other end , ncc still subjected to some effects of heating .",
    "theoretical models must predict the magnitude of the observed @xmath235 , and the impact of the non - gravitational processes associated to this excess in the central regions .",
    "these models fall into three main classes : preheating , where the gas collapsing into the dark matter potential well is preheated by some mechanism , before clusters were assembled at an early epoch @xcite ; local heating by agn activity , star formation or supernovae @xcite ; cooling , which seems to be able to remove low - entropy gas in the centre of the clusters , producing a similar effect to non - gravitational heating @xcite .",
    "hereafter , we review the main characteristics of these models and discuss how they are consistent with our observational constraints .      models of pre - heating , where a constant energy input is injected either prior of the cluster collapse ( @xmath237  kev per particle , e.g. @xcite ) or after the cluster formation ( @xmath238  kev per particle ( e.g. @xcite , could justify , only partially in ncc objects , the observed magnitude of @xmath235 , but not its radial behaviour .",
    "nevertheless , as pointed out by @xcite by studying hydrodynamical simulated clusters , there is no possibility to inject a large quantity of energy per particle ( @xmath239 kev ) , unless a large isentropic core is produced in the entropy profile , core that is not observed in our profiles in agreement with other work @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggest that any raise of the temperature and/or decrease of the density in the gas inside the primordial structures due to preheating can get largely raised by the accretion shock . following the model of @xcite",
    ", @xcite estimated that a mild raise of the entropy of the gas confined to filaments ( @xmath240 , corresponding to a temperature of @xmath241 kev ) can be boosted by the accretion shock to the observed value of @xmath15 ( @xmath242 ) .",
    "they point out that an interplay between shock and smoothing of the primordial gas due to a preheating can justify the observed properties of the gas entropy , given the above upper limits on the energy budget of the preheating and being the slope of the entropy profile close to the value predicted from shock heating .",
    "preheating prior of the cluster collapse should be a energetically favorable mechanism compared to _ in situ _ heating to cast further energy into the gas before it is concentrated in the gravitational potential well of the dm halo , since less energy is required to increase the entropy of the gas by a given amount when its density is lower as in the filaments .",
    "in fact we observe that in the shock dominated collapse scenario , a mild injection of energy through preheating can greatly amplify the final energy @xmath243 of the post - shocked particles , being @xmath244 , with @xmath245 the initial energy .",
    "@xcite show that smoothing the accretion pattern by preheating in the case of simulations without radiative physics amplifies the entropy generation out to the radius where the accretion shock acts .",
    "nevertheless , the effect seems to be substantially reduced when cooling is also taken into account .",
    "however , our estimates of @xmath235 show not a constant profile but instead a declining one outwards .",
    "this behaviour can not be explained by any preheating mechanism , either prior or after cluster collapse , even though entropy is amplified through subsequent shock heating .",
    "results for x - ray bright nearby objects by @xcite support this conclusions , because their scaled entropy profiles show increasing scatter in the inner regions , with a dispersion ( @xmath246 per cent ) definitely higher than the value found in simulations including filamentary preheating ( @xmath5 30 per cent , @xcite ) .      in principle",
    ", heating can amplify the boosting of the entropy out to the radius where accretion shocks are taking place , especially in low mass system , since they are accreted by smaller subhalos where the gas is more smoothed by the extra heating . as pointed out by @xcite , local heating due to star formation activity is not able alone to prevent overcooling and to reproduce the predicted star formation as low as measured @xcite and the observed entropy profile : maybe we have to appeal to further sources of non - gravitational energy , like agn , not taken into account in such hydrodynamical simulations , or different physical mechanisms to distribute the energy inside the icm .",
    "the need of this further source of non - gravitational energy is also confirmed by the analysis made in sect .",
    "[ metallicity ] , where we observe that the number of supernovae we require to reproduce the observed metallicity is not able to account for all the excess of energy @xmath187 .",
    "a gentle , transonic heating process , such as the weak shocks detected in the perseus cluster @xcite , can provide a framework by which one can explain all the observed properties , like the flattening of the entropy profile in the innermost regions ( @xmath247 a few tens of kpc ) even of scc clusters , and the spikes of metallicity measured in the centre of scc sources ( see fig .",
    "[ entps3bw ] ) .",
    "weak shocks are indeed likely not able to prevent metals accumulation in the innermost regions .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the central cooling time of the scc galaxies ( @xmath248 yr ) is consistent with the time scale of the activity of radio sources ( @xmath249 yr ) at the centre of clusters .",
    "energy casted by the radio jet ( @xmath250 erg / s ) can then produce the observed flattening of the entropy profiles on scale of a few tens of kpc .",
    "gasdynamical models of jets flows proceeding from a central supermassive black hole and entering surrounding gas may heat the icm by casting mass and energy outwards till scale @xmath5 hundreds of kpc , possibly lowering the cooling rate @xcite . nevertheless the above picture does not explain the excess of energy @xmath9 in the regions outside the core , where we have probably to require some other form of heating , like e.g. shocks induced from merging activity .",
    "whatever sources of non - gravitational energy we have to appeal , they must fuel energetically the icm in such a way to reproduce the magnitude and the radial behaviour of @xmath235 , casting energy ( in the order of few kev ) and metals preferentially in the innermost regions .",
    "cooling plays a key role to explain the observed excess of energy @xmath235 .",
    "in fact , @xmath235 is higher in the central regions moving from scc to icc and to ncc systems .",
    "cooling can easily account for this trend through radiative losses of the accumulated thermal energy .",
    "in the scc clusters , @xmath173 is roughly equal to @xmath7 suggesting either that a perfect balance between cooling and heating is established , permitting the radiative losses of the only amount of energy in excess with respect to the one associated to the dm , or that heating is episodic and we are observing structures in their undisturbed phase .    in a similar manner ,",
    "@xcite have argued that the entropy responsible for the break of the self similarity is not a global property of the icm , but rather a property set by radiative cooling : they point out that the observed entropy value at the core radii of groups and clusters is near to the entropy at which @xmath251 .",
    "a model to explain the observed features in the entropy profile is that proposed by @xcite .",
    "they show how cooling and supernovae heating act to eliminate high compressible gas with @xmath252 , being @xmath253 the cooling threshold , from the x - ray phase .",
    "much of the condensation and the feedback is prior of the epoch of clusters formation , balancing these processes reciprocally : more the cooling is effective , more the star formation is active with release of energy to the icm and consequent reduction of the cooling itself .",
    "this picture is likely not wholly adequate , leading to a very large isentropic core in the entropy profiles , which are not observed .",
    "we have presented _ chandra _ observations of the entropy profiles and scaling properties of a sample of 24 galaxy clusters spanning the redshift range 0.140.82 and classified accordingly to their central cooling time in strong ( scc ) , intermediate ( icc ) and non - cooling core ( ncc ) systems .",
    "we have performed a spatially resolved spectral analysis and recovered the gas density , temperature @xmath254 and entropy @xmath15 profiles at high spatial resolution and in a non - parametric way .",
    "we have shown that those entropy profiles are remarkably similar outside the central regions with a typical entropy level at @xmath3 of @xmath4 , and have a central entropy plateau covering a wide range of values ( @xmath5 a few@xmath6 ) , with the highest values associated to ncc objects .",
    "the cc clusters show larger values of the entropy than the one measured in nearby luminous systems , with a more significant deviations observed at @xmath113 than at @xmath79 with respect to the best - fit results in pratt et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , suggesting that the core in our cc objects are not yet well defined from the cooling processes .",
    "we have studied the radial behaviour of the temperature of the gas ( @xmath173 ) and of the dark matter ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "we have found that @xmath173 is always higher than @xmath7 : for the scc clusters , the difference of temperature @xmath255 is negligible , while it is large for the non - cooling core clusters ( up to @xmath510 kev per particle ) , with @xmath256 that declines outwards .    we conclude that none of the models of ( pre-)heating and cooling discussed in literature is able to explain alone the observed trends of the entropy profiles and of @xmath235 .",
    "likely , we have to require an interplay of these processes . a scenario with shock dominated collapse and preheating in the primordial filaments",
    "might account for most of the extra - gravitational energy , as confirmed by the slopes of the entropy profiles near the theoretical value of 1.1 expected in the accretion shock picture @xcite .",
    "as described in sect .",
    "[ preheat ] , this should be an energetically favorable mechanism compared to the _ in situ _ heating , amplifying significantly the final energy @xmath243 of the post - shocked particles . on the other side , gentle , sub - sonic heating processes , e.g. supported from agn s jets , can account for many of the observed properties , but not for excess of energy still measured outside the core ( see sect .  [ snnen0 ] ) .",
    "the relaxed environment of scc clusters is required to enhance the central metal abundance and total iron mass in correspondence of low entropy regions ( see sect .",
    "[ metallicity ] ) .",
    "there , the cooling is so efficient to remove on short time scale the excess of energy per particle of the icm , permitting ( i ) @xmath173 to approach the dark matter value @xmath7 and ( ii ) the other physical parameters used in describing the entropy profile , like , e.g. , @xmath110 , @xmath150 , to vary .",
    "overall , the different observed behaviour of the entropy profiles of scc , icc and ncc massive clusters suggest that we are observing the end products of the hierarchical model for structure formation .",
    "they represent different stages of the relative relevance of heating and cooling in regulating the feedback that shapes the icm distribution : galaxy clusters are identified either as ncc objects when heating , probably due to a residual merging activity and feedback from agns triggered from the merger itself , is predominant , or as scc systems when the radiative losses are energetically prominent , being icc objects an intermediate case between the two .",
