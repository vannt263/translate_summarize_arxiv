    "the core of this paper , sections 4 - 9 , is accessible to any mathematician . after technical definitions are given in section 2 , the main definitions and details for the background material mentioned here appear in section 3 ( which is a second introductory section ) .",
    "we think of `` demazure '' ( key ) polynomials as being `` partial schur functions '' : the schur function @xmath4 is the sum of weight monomials for the semistandard tableaux of shape @xmath0 . via the notion of `` right key '' , specification of an @xmath1-permutation @xmath2 determines a certain subset of those tableaux ; the sum of their weight monomials is the demazure polynomial we denote @xmath5 .",
    "these polynomials give a filtration for @xmath6 indexed by the bruhat order : as @xmath2 increases , more of the monomials for @xmath6 are incorporated into @xmath7 .",
    "but in the big view it seems best to take the definition of demazure polynomial to be the result of applying a sequence of divided difference operators corresponding to @xmath2 to a weight monomial specified by @xmath0 : when studying flag varieties , demazure developed @xcite this formula to describe certain characters of a borel subgroup of any semisimple lie group . by 1990",
    "lascoux and schtzenberger @xcite had developed a combinatorial description of these polynomials using the plactic algebra .",
    "a central notion in their work was that of the right key of a given semistandard tableau .",
    "they proved that @xmath7 arises when a tableau is allowed to contribute its monomial if and only if its right key is dominated by the tableau corresponding to @xmath2 .",
    "we quote this result in theorem 3.1 .",
    "the second - listed author of this paper gave a simpler method for finding the right key of a tableau @xcite .",
    "here we use his `` scanning '' method to present two descriptions of these contributing `` demazure tableaux '' which seem to be more direct and more accessible than those available .",
    "our first description of the possible tableau values for a given location depends upon the values of the tableau in the columns `` to the east '' .",
    "our second description depends upon the values of the tableau in the locations `` to the southwest '' .",
    "lascoux has also developed several other related notions ( mostly with schtzenberger , but also more recently ) .",
    "the sums of the monomials of the tableaux whose right keys are exactly a given key were also considered in @xcite ; there they were also described with actions of operators .",
    "following mason @xcite , we refer to these polynomials as `` atoms '' .",
    "schur functions and key polynomials can be expressed as sums of atoms , where the sums run over certain permutations according to bruhat orders .",
    "the notion of the `` left key '' of a tableau was developed in @xcite . in that paper lascoux and schtzenberger considered the tableaux whose left key is one specified key and whose right key is another specified key .",
    "all of these considerations would lead us ( time permitting ) to initially consider eight tableaux description problems : ( right or left key of the tableaux ) @xmath8 ( is bounded by or is equal to a given key ) @xmath8 ( referring to values to the east or to the southwest ) .",
    "in addition to the ( r , b , e ) and ( r , b , sw ) descriptions mentioned above , we also present ( r , eq , e ) , ( l , eq , sw ) ,",
    "and ( l , b , sw ) descriptions .",
    "these five ( eight ) descriptions can now ( could then ) be combined in various ways .",
    "one can combine our ( r , eq , e ) and ( l , eq , sw ) descriptions to describe the tableaux of @xcite mentioned above . to be nonzero ,",
    "these polynomials should be indexed by intervals in bruhat orders .",
    "our ( r , b , sw ) and ( l , b , sw ) descriptions can be combined in a more practical fashion to describe a generalization of demazure polynomials that would be indexed by intervals in bruhat orders .",
    "( demazure introduced demazure polynomials while studying the desingularization of schubert varieties .",
    "kazhdan - lusztig polynomials are indexed by intervals in bruhat orders and are related to the structure of singularities of schubert varieties . )",
    "our descriptions can be used in backtracking procedures to generate the tableaux desired .",
    "procedure 7.1 describes the backtracking procedure for the ( r , eq , e ) description of an atom .    here",
    "are some combinatorial descriptions of right keys and/or demazure polynomials and/or atoms ( that are specific to type a ) : theorem 4.3 of @xcite , theorems 1 , 2 , 5(1)(2)(3 ) , and 6 of @xcite , section 3 of @xcite , appendix a.5 of @xcite , theorems 4.1 , 4.2 , 4.7 and 4.10 of @xcite , theorems 3 and 8 of @xcite , theorem 1.2 and corollary 5.1 of @xcite , chapter 12 of @xcite , theorem 3.3.2 and proposition 3.4.3 of @xcite , and definition 4.3 of @xcite .",
    "demazure characters have been widely studied . why are atoms of interest ? for the study of symmetric polynomials such as the macdonald polynomials ,",
    "there has been a growing realization that it can be useful to broaden one s considerations to include closely related nonsymmetric polynomials .",
    "atoms have arisen as certain specializations of nonsymmetric macdonald polynomials @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "haglund , haiman , and loehr referred to atoms as `` nonsymmetric schur functions '' .",
    "mason s combinatorial description of atoms here helped lead to our @xcite .",
    "lascoux has been studying demazure , schubert , grothendieck , and nonsymmetric macdonald polynomials from the viewpoint of divided difference operators .",
    "when doing experiments in this context , one must express the empirical results in terms of the polynomials in some basis .",
    "here he has found ( personal communication ) atoms to form a particularly useful basis for all polynomials that generalizes the basis of schur functions for symmetric polynomials .",
    "combinatorial descriptions of atoms such as our theorem 6.1 give finer information than do plactic or polynomial recursions .",
    "reiner and shimozono s theorem 25 of @xcite and postnikov and stanley s theorem 14.1 of @xcite related demazure polynomials to flagged schur functions for certain @xmath2 .",
    "postnikov and stanley then remarked that the sets of gelfand patterns for the flagged schur functions that arise in this way form convex polytopes .",
    "in @xcite we use one of the demazure tableaux descriptions of this paper to prove that the set of demazure tableaux for @xmath9 forms a convex polytope if and only if @xmath2 is `` @xmath0 - 312 avoiding '' .",
    "a byproduct is a sharpening of the theorem 25 of @xcite description of the relationship between demazure polynomials and flagged schur functions .",
    "also , this relationship is now stated at the tableau level .",
    "dale peterson and this first - listed author proved @xcite that there are hook length product identities for the @xmath10-partition generating functions of @xmath11-complete posets .",
    "this proof used a product identity found by kumar and peterson for the direct limit of a family of `` adjusted '' kac - moody demazure characters . for @xmath11-complete posets ,",
    "this identity was needed only for the case when the weyl group element @xmath12 was @xmath0-miniscule .",
    "shuji okamura @xcite and kento nakada later gave hillman - grassl - style combinatorial proofs of these hook product identities for most classes of @xmath11-complete posets .",
    "a student is using our theorem 5.1 tableau description to develop a hillman - grassl proof of the analagous hook product identity for the generating function for the `` limiting '' versions of demazure tableaux : this would be the type a analog of the so - called `` peterson - proctor '' combinatorial models for the `` kumar - peterson '' identity . here the hook product runs over the inversions of the permutation @xmath2 .",
    "since the scanning criteria in theorem 5.1 is derived from a jeu de taquin process , in principal this result would relate the hillman - grassl algorithm to the jeu de taquin .",
    "reiner and shimozono used a somewhat indirect description of demazure polynomials to give @xcite an elementary derivation of the lakshmibai - musili - seshadri standard monomial basis for the demazure modules of global sections of line bundles on schubert varieties of the flag manifold @xmath13 .",
    "another student is working on making their development more explicit by using the more direct descriptions of these characters supplied by our theorem 5.1 .",
    "it is hoped that the scanning criteria for these tableaux will nicely index / motivate the selections of rows made when the plcker minors are formed to be used in the relevant standard monomials .",
    "this would update the spanning and linear independence arguments of @xcite .",
    "if both properties can be proven , then ( as usual ) there would be no need to quote the demazure character formula or theorem 3.1 to see that theorem 5.1 describes the demazure character .",
    "anytime the semistandard tableaux of a shape @xmath0 are used to define a combinatorial quantity or structure , one can choose a permutation @xmath14 and attempt to define a corresponding generalized quantity or entity that is `` relative '' to @xmath2 by using the description of demazure tableaux from our theorem 5.1 .",
    "one example of this would be given by summing the charge statistic over the demazure tableaux to obtain a relative version of the kostka polynomial .",
    "in fact , the study of the charge statistic in this vicinity has already begun @xcite @xcite .",
    "can these tableaux descriptions be used to build upon those results in the type a case ?    although the polynomials have provided the motivation , our results are set entirely within the finer context of tableaux .",
    "the notions of right and left keys were reduced to two scanning descriptions in @xcite .",
    "so the core of this paper is concerned with comparing the tableau output of a scanning method to a given key tableau . in section 4",
    "we present the scanning method for finding the right key . in sections 5 - 9",
    "we state and prove our descriptions of sets of tableaux that are constrained by given keys using our `` insider '' language of scanning tableaux . in section 10",
    "we summarize our results for `` outsiders '' in terms of left and right keys and polynomials .",
