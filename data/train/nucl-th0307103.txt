    "in the calculation of the properties of nucleonic matter , the nucleon - nucleon potential has a crucial role .",
    "recent models of two - nucleon potentials which fit the nucleon - nucleon scattering data with high precision , contain terms which break the isospin symmetry ( stoks et al . , 1994 ; machleidt and slaus , 2001 ; li and machleidt , 1998 ) .",
    "isospin symmetry is the invariance under any rotation in the isospin space .",
    "but , due to the mass difference between neutral pion and charged pion ( @xmath1 ) , this symmetry is broken ( stoks et al . , 1994 ; machleidt and slaus , 2001 ; li and machleidt , 1998 ) .",
    "this means that for the new two - nucleon potentials , the neutral pion exchange is distinguished from charged pion exchange .",
    "this distiction implies that the neutron - neutron ( _ nn _ ) , neutron - proton ( _ np _ ) and proton - proton ( _ pp _ ) interactions are different and therefore , these potentials are called isospin symmetry breaking ( * isb * ) potentials ( stoks et al . , 1994 ) .    due to the distinction between the neutral pion and charged pion exchange , for the potentials which describe the long range part of the nucleon - nucleon interaction in terms of the one - pion exchange model ,",
    "the one - pion exchange term is one of the origins of * isb * ( stoks et al . , 1994 ; machleidt and slaus , 2001 ; li and machleidt , 1998 ) . for the * isb * potentials , in the isospin @xmath2 states ,",
    "the distinction between the _ nn _ , _ np _ and _ pp _ potentials is necessary ( stoks et al . , 1994 ) . therefore , in the calculations with these potentials , the difference between the _ nn _ , _ np _ and _ pp _ wave functions should be considered . in our calculations",
    ", we use the _ reid-93 _ potential ( stoks et al . , 1994 ) .",
    "this potential describes the longe range part of the nucleon - nucleon interaction in terms of the one - pion exchange model accounting for the mass difference between the neutral pion @xmath3 and charged pions @xmath4 and @xmath5 . in the _ reid-93 _",
    "potential , for the non - one - pion exchange parts , additional * isb * terms have been included in the @xmath6 state potential ( stoks et al . , 1994 ) .",
    "in this work , we intent to calculate the various properties of asymmetrical nuclear matter and @xmath0-stable matter in two different cases with isospin symmetry ( * is * ) and with isospin symmetry breaking ( * isb * ) . by comparing the results of the * is * and * isb * cases , we study the influence of * isb * of nucleon - nucleon interaction on these properties . for the * isb * case",
    ", we use the _ reid-93 _ potential ( stoks et al . , 1994 ) in which the one - pion exchange potentials for the _ np _ and _ pp _ ( _ nn _ ) interactions as well as the _ np _ and _ pp _ ( _ nn _ )",
    "@xmath6 potentials are different . however , for the * is * case , we replace the one - pion exchange and @xmath6 potentials of _ nn _ and _ pp _ interactions with the corresponding _ np _ interaction ( stoks et al . , 1994 ) .",
    "in our calculations , we employ the formalism used in our previous works ( bordbar and modarres , 1997 , 1998 ; modarres and bordbar , 1998 ; bordbar and riazi , 2001 , 2002 ; bordbar , 2002a , b ) in which we consider the distiction between the partial waves with @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "this method is a variational approach based on the cluster expansion of the energy functional containing the state dependent correlation functions .",
    "the convergence of the results of this approach has been also tested by calculating the three - body cluster term ( bordbar and modarres , 1997 ) .",
    "the asymmetrical nuclear matter properties are important for studying the supernova collapse and heavy - ion reaction ( lattimer and prakash , 2000 ; li et al . , 1997 ) . for asymmetrical nuclear matter",
    ", we define the asymmetry parameter @xmath0 as @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the number densities of neutrons and protons respectively , and @xmath13 is the total number density .",
    "this implies that for symmetrical nuclear matter ( @xmath14 ) @xmath15 and for the pure neutron matter @xmath16 .    in this section",
    ", we present our results for the various properties of asymmetrical nuclear matter and then we investigate the effects of * isb * on these properties .",
    "the total energy of asymmetrical nuclear matter as a function of total number density for various asymmetry parametrs is given in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "it is seen that for both * is * and * isb * cases as the asymmetry parameter increases , the saturation point shifts to the lower densities .",
    "however , for the large values of @xmath0 , the energy curve does not shows any minimum .",
    "the changes of total energy due to the inclusion of * isb * for nucleon - nucleon interaction are shown in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "this figure shows that the differences between our results in the * isb * and * is * cases increase by increasing both density and asymmetry parameter . in table",
    "[ tab1 ] , our results for the differences between the * isb * and * is * energies at @xmath17 are compared with those of mpm ( muther et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "it can be seen that our results are in a good agreement with the results of mpm for the _ nijm - ii _ potential .",
    "the @xmath0-dependence of the total energy of asymmetrical nuclear matter in the * isb * case is shown in figure [ fig3 ] for different values of density .",
    "it can be seen that even in the presence of * isb * , the asymmetrical nuclear matter energy is nearly linear in @xmath18 and therefore , the higher orders effects of the asymmetry are very small .",
    "this confirms the validity of the empirical parabolic law .    in figure [ fig4 ] , we have shown the effects of * isb * on the potential energy of asymmetrical nuclear matter .",
    "it is seen that the potential energy difference between the * is * and * isb * cases increases by increasing asymmetry parameter @xmath0 .",
    "this is due to the fact that by increasing @xmath0 , the energy contribution of _ nn _ interaction increases . therefore , the difference between the case in which we distinguish between the _ nn _ and _ np _ interactions ( * isb * case ) and the case in which we replace the _ nn _",
    "interaction by the corresponding _ np _ interaction ( * is * case ) increases by increasing @xmath0 .",
    "it is also seen that for each value of density and asymmetry parameter , the potential energy shift due to the * isb * is positive .",
    "this behaviour is reflecting the fact that in the partial wave with isospin @xmath2 , the @xmath19 potential is more attractive than the corresponding @xmath20 and @xmath21 potentials ( bordbar , 2003 ) .",
    "the influence of * isb * on the saturation point properties of asymmetrical nuclear matter is shown in table [ tab2 ] .",
    "we see that the * isb * effects on the saturation density , energy and incompressibility of asymmetrical nuclear matter are generally small , but they are considerable for large @xmath0 .",
    "the nuclear matter asymmetry energy is of particular interest in astrophysics , especially for studying the supernova mechanism ( lattimer and prakash , 2000 ) .",
    "the asymmetry energy can be approximated as the difference between binding energies of pure neutron matter ( @xmath16 ) and symmetrical nuclear matter ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the validity of using this approximation ( called parabolic approximation ) in calculating the asymmetry energy was shown in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "our results for the asymmetry energy calculated for both * is * and * isb * cases are presented in figure [ fig5 ] .",
    "it can be seen that the changes of asymmetry energy due to the inclusion of * isb * increase by inceasing density .",
    "the properties of @xmath0-stable matter are of special importance in astrophysics .",
    "the equation of state of @xmath0-stable matter is very important for investigating the neutron stars , particularly in their stability ( akmal et al . , 1998 ; heiselberg and pandharipande , 2000 ) .",
    "the @xmath0-stable matter is a composition of nucleons and leptons which is electrically neutral and in @xmath0-equilibrium .",
    "the @xmath0-equilibrium means that there is a balance between the competing processes of electron capture @xmath22 and @xmath0-decay @xmath23 .",
    "this equilibrium conditions determine the proton fraction ( @xmath24 ) in @xmath0-stable matter .",
    "the proton fraction is important for studing the cooling of a neutron star ( prakash , 1994 ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig6 ] , we have plotted our results for the total energy of @xmath0-stable matter versus density in the * is * and * isb * cases .",
    "it is seen that by considering * isb * for the nucleon - nucleon interaction , the change of @xmath0-stable matter energy is small .",
    "for example , at density @xmath25 , the energy correction due to the * isb * effects is about @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , the effects of * isb * on the total energy of @xmath0-stable matter are negligible .    the calculated energy contribution of leptons and proton fraction in @xmath0-stable matter are shown in figures [ fig7 ] and [ fig8 ] .",
    "it is found that these properties of @xmath0-stable matter are varied by the inclusion of * isb * of nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "this shows that the * isb * of nucleon - nucleon interaction affects the conditions of @xmath0-equilibrium .",
    "the equation of state of @xmath0-stable matter calculated for both * is * and * isb * cases are shown in figure [ fig9 ] .",
    "it can be seen that the influences of * isb * on the equation of state of @xmath0-stable matter are ignorable .",
    "the two - nucleon potential has a crucial role in the nuclear many - body calculations . by comparing the results of two different cases of isospin symmetry ( *",
    "is * ) and isospin symmetry breaking ( * isb * ) for the nucleon - nucleon interaction , we have evaluated the effects of * isb * on the different properties of asymmetrical nuclear matter and @xmath0-stable matter .",
    "it was seen that the changes of total energy , potential energy and asymmetry energy of asymmetrical nuclear matter due to the inclusion of * isb * for the nucleon - nucleon interaction increase by increasing both density and asymmetry parameter .",
    "it was shown that the empirical parabolic law is valid , even by considering * isb * for the nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "it was indicated that our results for the total energy and the equation of state of @xmath0-stable matter in the * is * and * isb * cases are nearly identical . for @xmath0-stable matter",
    ", it was shown that the * isb * affects the energy contribution of leptons and proton fraction .",
