    "a constant concentration gradient of the chemical that fuels the particle s self - propulsion is maintained by connecting the channel to two reservoirs in thermal equilibrium with concentrations @xmath40 .",

    "( 2 ) on which side of the channel is it going to sojourn the most time ?",
    "this might sound paradoxical , but we came to the conclusion that the injected jp is finally attracted toward the left ( cold ) exit , even if , immediately after injection , it may drift to either direction , depending on the @xmath39-dependence of the propulsion parameters @xmath2 and @xmath4 .",
    "for the most common case when the @xmath39-dependence of @xmath4 is much weaker than @xmath43 @xcite , the injected particle points decidedly to the right ( hot ) exit . reconciling these seemingly conflicting mechanisms is of paramount importance to control the chemotaxis of artificial microswimmers as opposed to bacterial chemotaxis @xcite . to avoid misunderstandings",
    "we remark that the adjectives hot and cold refer here to the regions in the reactor where the effective swimmer diffusion due to the selfpropulsion , @xmath47 , is the highest and lowest , respectively . the thermal diffusion , @xmath15 , is assumed to be @xmath39-independent , which means that thermal gradients do not enter our analysis .",
    "accordingly , in the absence of thermal gradients and for low fuel concentrations , additional transport contributions due to hydrodynamic effects in the suspension fluid can be safely neglected .",

    "[ numresults ] we present numerical results for the `` splitting probabilities '' that a jp , injected at the center of the channel , exits it through the right or left end and the corresponding mean first - exit times .",
    "the particle clearly undergoes a transient drift toward the hot end of the channel , whereas its stationary distribution tends to accumulate at the opposite end . in sec .",
