    "the discovery of new types of orthogonal polynomials , called the exceptional @xmath0 polynomials , has been the most interesting development in the area of exactly solvable models in quantum mechanics in the last two years @xcite . unlike the classical orthogonal polynomials , these new polynomials have the remarkable properties that they still form complete sets with respect to some positive - definite measure , although they start with degree @xmath6 polynomials instead of a constant .",
    "four sets of infinite families of such polynomials , namely , the laguerre type l1 ,  l2 , and the jacobi type j1 , j2 @xmath0 polynomials , with @xmath1 , were constructed in @xcite .",
    "these systems were derived by deforming the radial oscillator potential and the darboux - pschl - teller ( dpt ) potential in terms of an eigenpolynomial of degree @xmath6 ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the lowest ( @xmath7 ) examples , the @xmath8-laguerre and @xmath8-jacobi polynomials , are equivalent to those introduced in the pioneering work of gomez - ullate et al .",
    "@xcite within the sturm - liouville theory .",
    "the results in @xcite were reformulated in the framework of quantum mechanics and shape - invariant potentials by quesne et al . @xcite . by construction",
    "these new orthogonal polynomials satisfy a second order differential equation ( the schrdinger equation ) without contradicting bochner s theorem @xcite , since they start at degree @xmath9 instead of the degree zero constant term .",
    "generalization of exceptional orthogonal polynomials to discrete quantum mechanical systems was done in @xcite .    later , equivalent but much simpler looking forms of the laguerre- and jacobi - type @xmath10 polynomials than those originally presented in @xcite were given in @xcite .",
    "these nice forms were derived based on an analysis of the second order differential equations for the @xmath10 polynomials within the framework of the fuchsian differential equations in the entire complex @xmath11-plane .",
    "they allow us to study in - depth some important properties of the @xmath0 polynomials , such as the actions of the forward and backward shift operators on the @xmath10 polynomials , gram - schmidt orthonormalization for the algebraic construction of the @xmath10 polynomials , rodrigues formulas , and the generating functions of these new polynomials .",
    "recently , these exceptional orthogonal polynomials were generated by means of the darboux - crum transformation @xcite .",
    "physical models which may involve these new polynomials were considered in @xcite .",
    "one important aspect related to these new polynomials , which was only briefly mentioned in @xcite but has not been investigated in - depth so far , is the structure of their zeros .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to look into this .",
    "particularly , we investigate the behaviors of the zeros as the parameters of the polynomials change .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in sect .  2 we briefly review the forms of the exceptional polynomials .",
    "sect .  3 and 4 study the behaviors of the extra and the ordinary zeros , respectively , of the exceptional polynomials as one of @xmath6 and @xmath12 increases while the other parameters being kept fixed .",
    "5 presents analytical proofs that explain the movements of the extra zeros of the exceptional polynomials as @xmath12 changes at fixed @xmath6 . in sect .",
    "6 we consider behaviors of the zeros at large @xmath13 and/or @xmath14 .",
    "7 summarizes the paper .",
    "four sets of infinitely many exceptional orthogonal polynomials were derived in @xcite , among them two are deformations of the laguerre polynomials , and the others are deformations of the jacobi polynomials .",
    "a unified nice form of these polynomials was given in @xcite , in which these polynomials are expressed as a bilinear form of the original polynomials , the laguerre or jacobi polynomials and the deforming polynomials , depending on the set of parameters @xmath15 and their shifts @xmath16 and a non - negative integer @xmath6 , which is the degree of the deforming polynomials .",
    "the two sets of exceptional laguerre polynomials ( @xmath1 , @xmath17 ) are : @xmath18   ( g+\\frac12 )   \\xi_{\\ell}(\\eta;{\\boldsymbol}{\\lambda}+{\\boldsymbol}{\\delta})p_n(\\eta;g+\\ell+1)\\\\   \\phantom{(n+g+\\frac12)^{-1}\\bigl(}\\ \\quad   + \\eta\\xi_{\\ell}(\\eta;{\\boldsymbol}{\\lambda})\\partial_{\\eta}p_n(\\eta;g+\\ell+1 ) & : \\text{l2 }   \\end{array}\\right .",

    "the zeros of orthogonal polynomials have always attracted the interest of researchers . in this paper",
    "we shall study the properties of the zeros of these new exceptional polynomials as some of their basic parameters change .    in the case of @xmath10 polynomial @xmath30 ,",
    "it has @xmath12 zeros in the ( ordinary ) domain where the weight function is defined , that is @xmath31 for the l1 and l2 polynomials and @xmath32 for the j1 and j2 polynomials .",
    "the behavior of these zeros , which we shall call the ordinary zeros , are the same as those of other ordinary orthogonal polynomials .",
    "we shall say more about these zeros in sect .",
    "[ ordinary - zeros ] .",
    "besides these @xmath12 zeros , there are extra @xmath6 zeros outside the ordinary domain . for convenience , we shall adopt the following notation for the zeros of the various polynomials involved : @xmath33 we emphasize that @xmath34 for the l1 and l2 laguerre polynomials , and @xmath35 for the j1 , and j2 jacobi polynomials .    figs .",

    "one can deduce certain patterns of the distribution of the zeros as those parameters vary .",
    "we will discuss these behaviors below .",
    "here we discuss the location of the extra @xmath6 zeros of the exceptional orthogonal polynomials , which lie in various different positions for the different types of polynomials . from our numerical analysis",
    ", we can summarize the trend as follows .",
    "the @xmath6 extra zeros of l1 polynomials are on the negative real line @xmath37 .",
    "the l2 @xmath38 polynomials have one real negative zero which lies to the left of the remaining @xmath39 pairs of complex conjugate roots .",
    "the l2 @xmath40 polynomials have @xmath41 pairs of complex conjugate roots .",
    "the situations for the @xmath0 jacobi polynomials are a bit more complicated .",
    "the j1 @xmath38 polynomials have one real negative root which lies to the left of the remaining @xmath39 pairs of complex conjugate roots with negative real parts .",
    "the j1 @xmath40 polynomials have @xmath41 pairs of complex conjugate roots with negative real parts .",
    "the j2 @xmath38 polynomials have one real positive root which lies to the right of the remaining @xmath39 pairs of complex conjugate roots with positive real parts .",
    "the j2 @xmath40 polynomials have @xmath41 pairs of complex conjugate roots with positive real parts .",
    "one notes that the j1 and j2 polynomials are the mirror images of each other , in the sense @xmath42 and @xmath43 , as exemplified by the relation @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "so the behaviors of the zeros of j1 jacobi polynomials can be obtained from those of the j2 type accordingly . as such , for clarity of presentation",
    ", we shall only discuss the behaviors of the zeros of the j2 jacobi polynomials in this paper .      in all cases",
    ", we have @xmath45 this implies that the zeros of @xmath46 coincide with those of @xmath29 , namely , @xmath47 .    at fixed @xmath6 ,",
    "all the @xmath48 move from @xmath49 at @xmath50 , to @xmath51 as @xmath52 .",

    "thus to know how @xmath48 behave as @xmath6 increases at fixed @xmath12 , we only need to study how the zeros @xmath49 and @xmath51 flow as @xmath6 increases .      as @xmath6 changes to @xmath60 , the zeros of @xmath61 and @xmath62 decrease ( move to the left ) , and a new set of zeros appear from the right .",

    "for @xmath132 , all zeros , i.e. , @xmath133 , gather around @xmath134 .",

    "many essential properties have been studied in @xcite .    in this paper , we have considered the distributions of the zeros of these new polynomials as some parameters of the hamiltonians change .",
    "the @xmath10 polynomials @xmath30 has @xmath12 zeros in the ordinary domain where the weight function is defined , that is @xmath31 for the l1 and l2 polynomials and @xmath32 for the j1 and j2 polynomials .",

    ", their distribution as @xmath12 increases at a fixed @xmath6 follows the patterns of the zeros of the ordinary classical orthogonal polynomials : they are governed by the oscillation theorem , and the @xmath77 zeros of @xmath79 interlace with the @xmath12 zeros of @xmath30 . on the other hand , when @xmath6 increases at a fixed @xmath12 , the type l1 and l2 laguerre polynomials will have all their @xmath12 zeros shifted to the right .",
    "for the j1 and the j2 jacobi polynomials , both the positive and negative zeros move toward the origin @xmath80 as @xmath6 increases .    for the @xmath6 extra zeros of @xmath30 ,",
    "each and everyone of them is sandwiched between the corresponding zeros of the deforming polynomials @xmath29 and @xmath28 . as @xmath12 increases at a fixed @xmath6 , the extra zeros move from the zeros of @xmath29 to those of @xmath28 .",
    "the behaviors of the extra zeros as @xmath6 increases at a fixed @xmath12 are more complex . for the l1 the laguerre polynomials , all its extra zeros lie on the negative @xmath11-axis .",
    "so as @xmath6 increases by one , the number of the extra zeros increases from @xmath6 to @xmath60 . for the l2 laguerre and j1 and j2 jacobi polynomials ,",
    "they have @xmath137 pairs of complex zeros for even @xmath6 , and @xmath138 pairs of complex zeros and a real zero outside the ordinary domains where the weight functions are defined . as @xmath6 increases , all the complex zeros move toward the right in the case of the l2 laguerre and j1 jacobi polynomials , and toward the left for the j2 jacobi polynomials , while the extra real zeros bifurcate into new pairs of complex zeros . for large @xmath6 ,",
