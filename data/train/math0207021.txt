    "-5 mm    let @xmath0 be a complex manifold with khler metric , and @xmath1 a vector bundle on @xmath0 .",
    "the hermitian yang - mills ( hym ) equations are nonlinear partial differential equations for a connection on @xmath1 , written in terms of its curvature two - form @xmath2 : @xmath3 the theorems of donaldson @xcite and uhlenbeck - yau @xcite state that irreducible connections solving these equations are in one - to - one correspondence with @xmath4-stable holomorphic vector bundles @xmath1 .    in this talk",
    ", we will state a conjecture which generalizes this statement , motivated by superstring theory , and some results which follow .",
    "in @xcite we gave an introduction for mathematicians to the family of problems which comes out of the study of dirichlet branes in type  string compactification on a calabi - yau threefold ( henceforth , 3 ) , _ i.e. _ a three complex dimensional ricci - flat khler manifold .",
    "these manifolds are of central importance in superstring compactification and their study has led to many results of physical and mathematical importance .",
    "the primary mathematical result about these manifolds , which is the starting point for their discussion in superstring theory , is yau s theorem @xcite , which states that a complex manifold @xmath0 with trivial canonical bundle , or equivalently @xmath5 , and which admits a khler metric , admits a unique ricci - flat khler metric in each khler class .",
    "thus , a family of ricci - flat metrics is parameterized locally by a choice of complex structure , and a choice of khler class .    given a manifold @xmath0",
    ", one can define a nonlinear sigma model with target space @xmath0 , using methods of quantum field theory .",
    "it has been proven to physicists satisfaction that for @xmath0 calabi - yau , this sigma model exists and is a @xmath6 superconformal field theory ( scft ) , which can be used to compactify superstring theory .",
    "the space of such theories is parameterized locally by a choice of complex structure on @xmath0 , and a choice of `` stringy khler structure . ''",
    "a subset of the stringy khler structures are specified by a complexified khler class , i.e. a point in @xmath7 .",
    "however this is only a limit ( usually called `` large volume limit '' ) in the full moduli space @xmath8 of stringy khler structures @xcite ; we define this space below .    the most well - known results in this area concern mirror symmetry , a relation between a pair of 3 s @xmath0 and @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "this relation is simple to state in physics terms : the nonlinear sigma models associated to @xmath0 and @xmath9 are the same , up to an automorphism which acts on the @xmath6 superconformal algebra .",
    "this implies that every physical observable for the @xmath0 model has a mirror observable in the @xmath9 model , which in a suitable sense must be the same .",
    "physics also provides some techniques for computing these observables , and predicts certain examples of mirror pairs .",
    "many interesting and mathematically precise conjectures have been made based on this equivalence , starting with the work of candelas _ et al _ @xcite which gave a formula for the number ( suitably defined ) of rational curves of given degree in @xmath0 a quintic hypersurface @xmath0 in @xmath10 , in terms of data about the periods of the holomorphic three - form on its mirror @xmath9 .",
    "this formula has since been proven by givental @xcite , by a tour de force computation ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the first conjecture which tried to explain mirror symmetry on a deeper level was made by kontsevich @xcite , who proposed that it should be understood as an equivalence between the derived category of coherent sheaves on @xmath0 , and the fukaya category on @xmath9 @xcite , a category whose objects are isotopy classes of lagrangian submanifolds carrying flat connections , and whose morphisms are elements of floer cohomology .",
    "it took a little while for physicists to appreciate this conjecture .",
    "for one thing , the natural physical objects to which it relates , dirichlet branes , were almost completely unknown when it was made .",
    "d - branes quickly moved to center stage with the `` second superstring revolution , '' and an open string version of the candelas _ et al _ conjecture was made @xcite , but the larger physical picture relating to kontsevich s ideas is rather subtle and took longer to uncover .",
    "direct contact was made in @xcite , where it was shown that the derived category of coherent sheaves on @xmath0 , @xmath11 , could be obtained as a category of boundary conditions in the b - type topologically twisted sigma model on @xmath0 .",
    "further developments in this story appear in @xcite .",
    "this makes contact with the mathematics of equivalences between derived categories in various ways , which we will describe .    on realizing how the derived category arises in string theory , one sees new features which were not present in the standard mathematical treatments .",
    "the derived category of coherent sheaves is @xmath12-graded , but it is clear in string theory that the gradings are naturally @xmath13-valued , and furthermore depend on stringy khler data .",
    "this was mentioned in @xcite , and we will describe it in more detail here .    the simplest physical question about dirichlet branes is simply to know which ones exist as physical branes .",
    "more precisely , while the general argument leading to the derived category tells us that every b - type brane corresponds to some object in @xmath11 , not all of these objects are actually physical b - type branes , and we would like to know which ones are",
    ".    in the large volume limit , the physical branes are the coherent sheaves associated to solutions of the hym equations ( with certain allowed singularities ) , and this question was answered by the duy theorems : the physical branes are the @xmath4-stable sheaves .",
    "to summarize , one begins with the hitchin - kobayashi correspondence , according to which yang - mills connections with @xmath14 are in one - to - one correspondence with holomorphic bundles with a hermitian metric .",
    "such a bundle admits an action of the complexified gauge group @xmath15 ( say @xmath16 ) , and one wants to know whether a given orbit of this group contains a solution of ( [ eq : hym ] ) .",
    "one can formally regard the equation ( [ eq : hym ] ) as setting an infinite - dimensional moment map for this action to zero , so the question is directly analogous to that of defining a symplectic quotient . in that context",
    ", a @xmath15-orbit will contain a solution if it is stable in the sense of geometric invariant theory ( git ) .",
    "the duy theorems then state that the appropriate notion of stability is @xmath4-stability , and prove that a stable orbit indeed contains a unique solution .",
    "the proof itself requires hard analysis , but at the end one finds that the intuition from git is correct .",
    "this answer has the interesting feature that @xmath4-stability and thus the set of stable objects depends on the khler class of @xmath0 , and can change on walls of codimension @xmath17 .",
    "on the other hand , it does not depend on the overall scale of the khler class , reflecting the scale invariance of the yang - mills equations .",
    "superstring theory leads to `` generalized hym equations , '' which reduce in the large volume limit to the hym equations , but which explicitly introduce a length scale , the `` string length . ''",
    "the next step in the discussion would seem to be to study these equations .",
    "however , although some results are known in this direction @xcite , a usable general equation incorporating all stringy effects is not known at this writing .",
    "we will comment on this problem in the conclusions .",
    "rather , what we will do is propose the stringy analog of @xmath4-stability , a necessary and sufficient condition for an object in @xmath11 to correspond to a physical boundary condition , called @xmath18-stability .",
    "this condition will depend on stringy khler moduli , and will describe the generalization of wall crossing and other phenomena in @xmath4-stability to string theory .",
    "it turns out that the problem of not having a concrete analog of the hym equations can be bypassed to some extent by basing the discussion on scft .",
    "in particular , one can prove the `` easy '' half of the duy theorems , that a @xmath18-unstable object can not be a physical brane , directly from scft .    despite the direct analogy ,",
    "the discussion differs dramatically from that made in geometric invariant theory , because the derived category is not an abelian category .",
    "even the most basic elements of the standard discussion need to be rethought .",
    "in particular , there is no concept of subobject in the derived category .",
    "we will overcome these problems , but by paying a price .",
    "rather than formulating a condition which can be tested on an object @xmath1 at a point in @xmath8 , we will give a rule which describes the variation of the entire set of stable objects at a point @xmath19 in @xmath8 , call it @xmath20 , to a new set at another point , say @xmath21 .",
    "this rule depends on the path in @xmath8 connecting @xmath19 and @xmath22 , but conjecturally only on its homotopy class .",
    "this leads to an interesting phenomenon when one traverses a homotopically nontrivial loop in moduli space .",
    "physically , the result of this must be to recover the original list of stable objects . however , the specific objects in the derived category which represent these stable objects can change .",
    "in other words , such a loop is naturally associated to an autoequivalence in @xmath11 .",
    "considerations of mirror symmetry had previously led to conjectures relating loops and monodromies to autoequivalences @xcite ; using @xmath18-stability we can in a sense prove these conjectures , as we will explain .",
    "-5 mm    we will not try to explain the stringy aspects of the problem in any detail , but just convey the central ideas .",
    "the most central idea is the relation between the `` physical '' string world - sheet , described by scft , and the related topologically twisted string or tft @xcite .",
    "given an scft , a related tft is obtained by choosing a world - sheet supercharge , an operator @xmath23 in the @xmath24 algebra satisfying @xmath25 , and restricting the hilbert space to its cohomology . in @xmath6 scft",
    "one can make two choices of supercharge , leading to the `` a - type '' and `` b - type '' tft s . in this language ,",
    "a mirror pair of 3 s is a pair @xmath26 such that their twisted sigma models satisfy @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the `` stringy '' geometry of the cy @xmath0 is fully encoded in the scft , while the tft only gives a small subset of this .",
    "the closed string sector generally corresponds to metric properties , and the a and b - type tft s respectively encode the stringy khler structure and the complex structure .",
    "thus , mirror symmetry can be used to give a definition to the stringy khler structure : the stringy khler moduli space @xmath29 is isomorphic to the standard complex structure moduli space @xmath30 .    on general grounds , boundary conditions in an scft",
    "are objects in a category , whose morphisms @xmath31 are the @xmath23-cohomology of the hilbert space of open strings stretching from the boundary condition @xmath1 to the boundary condition @xmath2 . in @xmath6 scft , this category will be graded ( by `` @xmath32 charge '' ) .",
    "the category is not guaranteed to be abelian , but in a sense is generated by a finite set of abelian subcategories ( the branes with specified grading ) .    a priori , each scft ( i.e. with given complex and khler moduli ) leads to a different category of boundary conditions",
    ". a suitable subset of these descend to tft , to provide a category of boundary conditions in tft .",
    "the morphisms are called `` topological open strings . ''    in the particular case of the sigma model on @xmath0 , the simplest b - type boundary conditions are holomorphic submanifolds carrying a holomorphic bundle @xcite . if we consider two objects @xmath1 and @xmath2 whose support is @xmath0 and carrying bundles @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the operator @xmath23 becomes the @xmath33 operator coupled to a difference of the gauge connections .",
    "its cohomology , the morphisms @xmath31 are the dolbeault cohomology , @xmath34 .",
    "the grading agrees with the standard grading .",
    "more generally , the role of holomorphic bundles in the discussion of the hym equations , is played in the string theory generalization by boundary conditions in @xmath35 .",
    "thus we need to know if this is the most general boundary condition in @xmath36 .",
    "in fact , one can find direct evidence that it is not , from various sources .",
    "the main point is the following : the definition of @xmath36 by twisting an scft shows that it is independent of the stringy khler moduli , and so one must obtain the same @xmath35 by twisting any scft obtained by deforming in @xmath29 . on the other hand ,",
    "when one compares the boundary states in examples obtained from various scft s , one finds that they are not the same .",
    "independence of @xmath36 on @xmath29 can only be recovered by postulating some larger class of boundary conditions which contain the ones produced by twisting any specific scft . since the definition of tft is made in homological terms , one can attempt to use any of the standard generalizations known in mathematics .",
    "kontsevich s conjecture suggests that we try to formulate boundary conditions which are objects in the derived category of coherent sheaves on @xmath0 , @xmath11 .",
    "more generally , we would start with any of the various abelian categories @xmath37 of boundary conditions @xmath37 in our scft , and try to use an object in @xmath38 .",
    "in fact this can be done , by more or less repeating the standard mathematical construction .",
    "we still need to justify the claim that this is an appropriate definition of tft .",
    "this involves two non - trivial steps .",
    "the first of these is to argue that direct sums of boundary conditions indexed by an integer @xmath12 naturally appear as boundary conditions .",
    "one then sees by more or less standard tft arguments that the operator @xmath23 can be modified by turning on maps between terms in the complexes , and that the resulting cohomology is chain maps up to homotopy equivalence .",
    "the second non - trivial step is to identify complexes related by quasi - isomorphisms , morphisms which act as the identity on homology .",
    "the justification of the first step , the @xmath12-grading on complexes , is tied to the grading and the structure of the @xmath24 superconformal algebra @xcite .",
    "in particular , an a or b - type boundary condition in scft naturally carries a grading .",
    "however , it turns out that this is not @xmath12-valued but @xmath13-valued .",
    "this can be used to make complexes , whose terms have grades differing by integers .    in fact , it turns out that @xmath38 is independent of stringy khler moduli only as an ungraded category ; the gradings depend on the point in @xmath8 , and undergo `` flow of gradings . ''",
    "we will describe the consequences of this in the next section .    to a certain extent",
    ", one can also justify the second step , quotienting by quasi - isomorphisms , by physical arguments @xcite .",
    "the basic intuition is that each brane @xmath1 in string theory comes with an `` antibrane '' @xmath39 , an object whose definition makes clear that a physical configuration containing a @xmath1 and a @xmath39 can `` annihilate '' to a configuration with these two objects removed .",
    "this can be formalized in the statement that branes are classified by k theory @xcite , the additive group completion of the semigroup under direct sum , with deformation equivalent objects identified .",
    "one would prefer to use a finer equivalence relation which allows determining the holomorphic maps between objects ( the topological open strings ) .",
    "this requirement can be met by identifying complexes up to quasi - isomorphism ; for example we identify the complex @xmath40 with cohomology in one degree , with this cohomology .",
    "physically , the intuition behind this is that the brane @xmath41 and the antibrane @xmath42 can `` form a bound state , '' which is the same physical object as the cohomology , so this identification is well motivated . by iterating this construction",
    ", one can justify fairly general identifications @xcite . since the derived category is the universal construction of this type ( i.e. makes the minimal identifications meeting the requirements we just stated )",
    ", it is clear that one can use it in this context ; we return to this point in the conclusions .",
    "thus , the boundary conditions in a given scft are a subset of the objects in @xmath38 for any @xmath37 obtained from an scft related to it by motion in @xmath8 , and we seek a condition which specifies these . since the problem reduces to the hym equations in the large volume limit ,",
    "we are led to look for a condition generalizing @xmath4-stability , which we will describe in the next section .",
    "there is one primary input which can be proven from scft and which we can rely on in formulating this condition .",
    "namely , we know that our boundary conditions lead to a unitary @xmath6 scft , and are governed by the representation theory of this superconformal algebra .",
    "this leads to the general result @xcite that the grading @xmath43 of a morphism in a scft must satisfy @xmath44 in our examples . on the other hand , flow of gradings",
    "would generally lead to violations of this bound .",
    "this potential contradiction will lead to the stability condition .",
    "-5 mm    we now try to state the resulting formalism in a mathematically precise way .",
    "we suppose that we start with a 3 , @xmath0 , with mirror @xmath9 .",
    "recall that @xmath45 , the moduli space of complex structures on @xmath9 .",
    "the choice of @xmath0 determines a `` large complex structure limit point '' @xmath46 .",
    "there is furthermore a `` topological mirror map , '' an isomorphism @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the topological k theory group .",
    "a point @xmath19 in @xmath30 determines a holomorphic three - form @xmath49 on @xmath9 , and thus the periods @xmath50 composing @xmath51 , we obtain a character on @xmath48 for each @xmath19 , which we will also call @xmath52 .",
    "this is usually called the `` central charge '' in the physics literature .",
    "the periods @xmath18 are analytic with singularities on a discriminant locus @xmath53 of codimension @xmath17 on which @xmath9 degenerates .",
    "we define @xmath54 to be the `` stringy teichmller space , '' a cover of @xmath55 , on which @xmath18 is single valued .",
    "a deck transformation on @xmath54 corresponds to a linear monodromy on @xmath18 which preserves the intersection form , i.e. an element of @xmath56 .",
    "let @xmath20 be the set of stable objects at a point @xmath19 in @xmath54 , a subset of the objects in @xmath11 .",
    "suppose we know @xmath20 at one point @xmath19 ; we will give a rule which , upon following a path @xmath57 in @xmath8 from @xmath19 to @xmath58 , determines @xmath59 .",
    "we assume that at no point @xmath60 on the path does @xmath61 for an @xmath62 .",
    "indeed , there are physical arguments @xcite that this can only happen on the discriminant locus ( and furthermore must happen there ) .",
    "the basic ingredient in the rule is the assignment of @xmath13-valued gradings to all morphisms between stable objects .",
    "we denote the grading of a morphism @xmath63 as @xmath64 .    given the grading of @xmath65 between stable objects at a point @xmath19 , the grading at @xmath58 obtained by following the path @xmath57 is @xmath66 where @xmath67 resp . for @xmath2 .",
    "we keep track of the branch of the logarithm , so this defines an @xmath13-valued shift of the grading @xmath68 .",
    "we refer to this as `` flow of gradings . ''",
    "given the gradings at an initial point @xmath19 , this determines the gradings at the endpoint of any path .",
    "note that flow preserves the usual additivity of gradings .",
    "also , morphisms from an object to itself do not undergo flow .",
    "this implies that serre duality is still sensible , and ( for our 3 s ) we still have @xmath69 .",
    "we will assume that the gradings satisfy the condition that if @xmath70 , @xmath71 .",
    "this is true in string theory and will be true with the `` initial conditions '' we describe below .",
    "one can equivalently describe the gradings of morphisms by defining a grading on stable objects , an @xmath13-valued function @xmath72 which satisfies the constraints @xmath73 ) = \\grade_p(e)+1 $ ] and @xmath74 , and varies continuously on @xmath54 .",
    "one can then adopt the usual rule that a morphism in @xmath75,f[n])$ ] has grading @xmath76 , but now with @xmath77 .",
    "this tells us that when an object becomes stable , we only need to specify the grading of one morphism involving it , to determine the gradings of all morphisms involving it .",
    "we next consider the distinguished triangles of @xmath11 . with conventional gradings ,",
    "these take the form @xmath78^w_{[1]}&\\\\ a\\ar[rr]^u&&b\\ar[ul]^v } \\ ] ] and involve two morphisms of degree zero , and one of degree one , denoted @xmath79 $ ] .",
    "after flow of gradings , the gradings of morphisms will typically not be zero or one , but will always satisfy the relation @xmath80 we now distinguish `` stable '' and `` unstable '' triangles at each @xmath81 , according to their gradings . in a stable triangle ,",
    "all three morphisms satisfy the constraints @xmath82 if any of these constraints is violated , the triangle is unstable .    as one moves along a path in @xmath54",
    ", the gradings will vary , and the stability of triangles will change , on walls of real codimension @xmath17 in @xmath54 .",
    "given the assumptions we discussed , one can see that when the stability of a triangle changes , two morphisms will have grading zero , and one will have grading one .",
    "this can be seen by plotting the central charges of the three objects involved in the complex plane .",
    "if we consider the triangle with these vertices , the condition that the distinguished triangle be stable is that this triangle be embedded with positive orientation .",
    "a variation of stability is associated to colinear central charges , and a degeneration of this embedding .",
    "the fundamental rule is that when a stable triangle degenerates , the object with largest mass @xmath83 becomes unstable .",
    "physically , one says that it `` decays into the other two . ''",
    "this is the string theory generalization of `` wall - crossing '' of @xmath4-stability under variation of khler class . as we discussed above",
    ", this rule follows directly from cft , independent of any relation to hym or other geometric theories .",
    "if we grant the claim that the hym equations emerge as the large volume limit of this formalism , we can say that we have in fact a new derivation of this phenomenon .",
    "consistency requires us to implement this rule in the opposite direction as well : if an unstable triangle with two stable vertices becomes stable , the third object becomes stable , with grading the same as that of the other two .",
    "this determines the grading of all other morphisms it participates in .",
    "for example , when the triangle ( [ eq : triangle ] ) becomes stable , the object @xmath84 becomes stable , with @xmath85 ; this determines the gradings of all morphisms .",
    "applying this rule in practice requires keeping track of an infinite set of stable objects and triangles .",
    "some of the issues involved in making sense of this are discussed in @xcite .",
    "we conjecture that they lead to a unique @xmath20 for every @xmath86 , independent of choices of order of application of the rules or other ambiguities , because string theory defines a unique set of b - type branes at each point .",
    "although we do not have a mathematical proof of consistency , we have some understanding of it , and can point out two nontrivial ingredients involved in this claim .",
    "one is the question of whether @xmath59 depends on the choice of path taken from @xmath19 to @xmath58 . in general , one expects such dependence , but only on the homotopy class of path in @xmath87 , which will disappear on @xmath54 . on the other hand , one can construct simple examples which point to a potential problem with this claim .",
    "namely , one can find two intersecting walls , along one of which one has @xmath37 decaying to @xmath88 , and the other with @xmath84 decaying to @xmath89 .",
    "after crossing the second wall , one is not supposed to consider the @xmath90 triangle ( since @xmath84 is not stable ) , leading to the possibility that following a second path in the same homotopy class would lead to the contradiction that @xmath37 remains stable .",
    "this contradiction does not happen , by an argument given in @xcite which invokes the `` octahedral axiom '' of triangulated categories to show that a third triangle @xmath91 will still predict a decay .",
    "this argument also suggests that there are no ambiguities due to rule ordering .",
    "the second ingredient is the physical claim that `` the spectrum has a mass gap , '' in other words that the set @xmath92 at fixed @xmath19 has a positive lower bound .",
    "this assumption prevents infinite chains of brane decay or creation and is physically widely believed to hold in these problems .",
    "-5 mm    we first discuss consequences of the physical argument that @xmath38 should be the same for the various abelian categories @xmath37 obtained by explicit scft constructions . first , as one @xmath8 can contain different large volume limits @xmath0 , @xmath93 , etc .",
    ", one infers that @xmath94 for all of these limits . in the known physical examples ,",
    "the various limits are obtained by taking different moment maps in symplectic quotients ( the linear sigma model construction @xcite ) , and thus are all birationally equivalent ; the simplest picture is that this equivalence holds for any birationally equivalent @xmath0 and @xmath93 . indeed ,",
    "this is generally believed to be true ( for arbitrary smooth projective varieties ) and to some extent has been proven @xcite .",
    "one can also define and work with boundary conditions at various other `` exactly solvable '' points in @xmath8 such as orbifold points @xcite and gepner models @xcite .",
    "these lead to different abelian categories , some of whose objects can naturally be identified with holomorphic bundles , and some of which can not .",
    "physical results on resolution of orbifolds then lead to the general predictions @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is a discrete subgroup , @xmath97 is a crepant resolution , @xmath98 are @xmath99-equivariant sheaves on @xmath0 , and @xmath100 is the path algebra ( with relations ) of the mckay quiver for the group @xmath99 @xcite .",
    "indeed this is the subject of the generalized mckay correspondence @xcite , and these facts are shown in @xcite .",
    "we next turn to discussing @xmath18-stable objects .",
    "to get started , one needs to know @xmath20 and the gradings at some point @xmath19 .",
    "the simplest choice is a large volume limit , in which the stable objects are coherent sheaves .",
    "the gradings which come out of string theory are not quite the standard gradings of sheaf cohomology , but are as follows : a morphism @xmath101 between sheafs with support having complex codimension @xmath102 and @xmath103 , has grading @xmath104 . the central charges @xmath105 are in this limit given by @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the chern character , @xmath65 is an embedding and @xmath108 is the k - theoretic gysin map @xcite ( one can also evaluate this by using a locally free resolution and additivity ) .    dropping the exponentially small terms ( world - sheet instanton corrections ) , one can easily show that @xmath18-stability reduces to a stability condition for the modified hym equation considered in @xcite , and in the limit @xmath109 to @xmath4-stability @xcite .",
    "thus @xmath18-stability does describe b - type branes in string theory without instanton corrections .",
    "another limit which is available in certain problems ( for example , orbifolds @xmath110 is one in which all central charges @xmath18 are real .",
    "one can see that in this case , @xmath18-stability reduces to @xmath111-stability in an abelian category @xcite , and again this can be directly justified from string theory @xcite .",
    "this simpler description is valid near the limit as long as the central charges for stable objects live in a wedge @xmath9 and its negation @xmath112 in the complex plane .",
    "we now give some nontrivial examples in the context of sheaves on a projective 3  @xmath0 , say for definiteness the quintic hypersurface in @xmath113 .",
    "we follow a path in @xmath8 parameterized by @xmath114 , decreasing from large @xmath115 . in general when",
    "@xmath116 the exponential corrections in ( [ eq : lvpi ] ) are important , but their effect can be understood qualitatively in the examples we consider .",
    "the following is a distinguished triangle in @xmath11 ; the numerical superscripts are the gradings of morphisms at large volume : @xmath117 \\ldots\\ ] ] all three objects are stable at large volume .",
    "using @xmath118 , one finds that @xmath119 increases as @xmath115 decreases .",
    "when this crosses @xmath17 , i.e. @xmath120 is negative real , @xmath121 goes unstable .",
    "if one continues towards the stringy regime , eventually @xmath122 and @xmath123 become colinear again . at this point ,",
    "the non - sheaf @xmath124 defined at large volume by @xmath125 becomes stable . in @xcite , a gepner model boundary state",
    "was constructed , which has all the right properties to be this object , confirming the idea that non - coherent sheaves can appear as stable objects .",
    "another example uses the sequence @xmath126 \\ldots\\ ] ] where @xmath127 is the structure sheaf of a point @xmath128 .",
    "now the ideal sheaf @xmath129 is unstable at large volume , while the other two objects are stable .",
    "decreasing @xmath115 can now decrease the @xmath130 , and eventually the brane @xmath129 will become stable .",
    "this will happen on a line coming into the `` conifold point '' @xcite , a point near which ( choose a local coordinate @xmath131 on @xmath8 ) , @xmath132 continuing around this point further decreases the grade of this map to @xmath133 , and one finds that the point ( or d0 ) @xmath127 becomes unstable",
    ".    one can then continue back to large volume .",
    "physical consistency requires that a closed loop @xmath134 must induce an autoequivalence @xmath135 , such that @xmath136 thus we conjecture that @xmath18-stability leads to such an autoequivalence .",
    "furthermore , this particular autoequivalence acts on the k theory class as the mirror picard - lefschetz transformation , @xmath137 \\mapr [ x ' ] = [ x ] + \\vev{x,\\co } [ \\co ] .\\ ] ] these facts and the result we just derived that @xmath127 has as monodromy image @xmath129 , are enough to prove @xcite that this autoequivalence is one conjectured in @xcite , on grounds of mirror symmetry : @xmath138 becomes @xmath139 defined by the triangle @xmath140 thus , granting that @xmath18-stability leads to an autoequivalence , we have derived the particular autoequivalence associated to this loop .",
    "another equivalence of derived categories which has been obtained from @xmath18-stability @xcite , is one shown by bridgeland to describe a flop @xcite .",
    "it is obtained by going around a point at which the volume of the flopped curve @xmath141 vanishes , @xmath142 this produces the variations of grading @xmath143 by virtue of @xmath144 all points @xmath145 ( and only these points ) become unstable under this variation . on the other hand , if @xmath141 is a @xmath146 curve , one can show that @xmath147 , and the sequence @xmath148 defines `` flopped points , '' which are not sheaves in @xmath11 , but can be shown to be precisely the points on the flopped curve @xmath149 in the flopped cy @xmath93 .",
    "again , this transformation on the points extends to a unique equivalence of derived categories .",
    "-5 mm      although the statement of this conjecture relies on string theory , one can also regard it as _ defining _ a natural class of objects which are important in mirror symmetry , the stringy generalization of stable holomorphic bundles ( or solutions of the hermitian yang - mills equation ) , so we think it could be of interest to mathematicians . indeed , by assuming the conjecture and simple physical consistency conditions",
    ", one can derive various earlier mathematical conjectures related to mirror symmetry , as we discussed in section 4 .",
    "we believe that @xmath18-stability as we formulated it in section 3 is mathematically precise . in any case",
    "the first open question is to make it precise , prove its consistency , and see to what extent it uniquely determines the stable objects .",
    "some results in this direction have been announced by bridgeland @xcite .",
    "one application , explored in @xcite , is to explore `` stringy geometry '' of calabi - yau manifolds by using d - branes as probes @xcite .",
    "the primary problem of this type would appear to be the following : at any @xmath81 , find all `` d0-branes '' ( or point objects ) .",
    "a d0-brane is a family of stable objects @xmath150 with moduli space a 3  @xmath151 , such that @xmath152 . in the second example",
    "above , one sees that one can have more than one d0 ( @xmath129 and @xmath127 ) .",
    "it might be that in other examples , there is no d0",
    ".    a primary application of this conjecture in string theory would be to determine whether @xmath18-stable objects with specified @xmath153 theory class exist in various regions of @xmath8 . in the large volume limit ,",
    "the role of @xmath4-stability in this problem was discussed in @xcite . for such concrete purposes",
    ", it would be better to have a criterion which can be applied at a single point in @xmath8 and does not require considering the infinite set of stable objects .",
    "there are examples ( e.g. the gepner point for the quintic ) in which it can be shown that @xmath18-stability does not reduce to stability in a single abelian category , but it could be that the stable objects in any small region could be described as stable objects ( in a more conventional sense ) in any of a finite set of abelian categories .",
    "the statement of @xmath18-stability is admittedly rather complicated , but this to a large extent only reflects the complexity of its string theory origins",
    ". it would be interesting to know to what extent it depends on details of mirror symmetry ( such as @xmath0 a 3 , and @xmath18 given by the periods of the mirror @xmath9 ) , and to what extent it can be generalized .",
    "the basic definitions make sense for any complex @xmath0 and any character @xmath18 on @xmath48 , but we suspect that consistency , and especially the relation between homotopically nontrivial loops and autoequivalences , requires further conditions .    eventually , one would hope to prove the analog of the duy theorems . because general scft s on 3  are not rigorously defined ,",
    "this is not yet a mathematically well - posed problem .",
    "there are particular cases such as gepner models which can be rigorously defined using vertex operator algebra techniques @xcite .    even proving it to the satisfaction of string theorists seems difficult at present , but might be a reasonable goal .",
    "such problems are much studied by string theorists , under the general rubric of `` tachyon condensation . ''",
    "@xcite the analogy to hym at least gives us a guideline for how to proceed in this case .",
    "one would need to start with a working definition of boundary cft , including a large enough space of boundary states , and in which @xmath6 supersymmetry is manifest .",
    "one might also start with string field theory as developed in @xcite .",
    "one could then attempt a direct analog of the yang - mills gradient flow method used in @xcite to construct solutions .",
    "namely , one would start with an boundary condition formed as a complex of physical boundary conditions . in general this will not be conformal , but will flow to a conformal boundary condition under renormalization group flow .",
    "if we start with a large enough class of boundary conditions , presumably all boundary conditions could be obtained this way .",
    "it seems to us that the first and perhaps the major element in this project would be to identify and precisely define the group which plays the role of the complexified gauge group @xmath15 in the hym theory .",
    "one then needs to address the question of how equivalence classes of quasi - isomorphic complexes are actually realized in scft .",
    "it is not _ a priori _ obvious or necessary for the conjecture to hold that all such complexes are identified , but only that each stable class contains a single physical boundary state , which could come about in various ways .",
    "finally , one also has the mirror , special lagrangian description of dirichlet branes .",
    "this was also a primary input into formulating the conjecture ( particularly @xcite ) but this ingredient was to some extent subsumed by the scft considerations .",
    "nevertheless it is clearly important to make more connections to this side as well .",
    "we believe that the study of dirichlet branes on calabi - yau manifolds is proving to be a worthy continuation of the mirror symmetry story , and will continue to inspire interaction between mathematicians and physicists for some time to come .",
    "i particularly thank my collaborators paul aspinwall , emanuel diaconescu , bartomeu fiol and christian rmelsberger .",
    "i am also grateful to maxim kontsevich , greg moore , alexander polishchuk , paul seidel , and richard thomas for invaluable discussions ."
