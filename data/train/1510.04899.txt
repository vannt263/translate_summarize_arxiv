    "in this paper we consider a special type of the nonlinear pde that arises in mathematical finance by applying optimization to some financial problems . to make it clear we start with the example given by @xcite who considered an optimal consumption problem , first formulated in @xcite",
    ".      in @xcite lipton considers a portfolio of domestic and foreign bonds .",
    "the relative value of the domestic bond @xmath0 is constant , i.e. @xmath1 , while that of the foreign bond @xmath2 is random and follows the geometric brownian motion with constant real - world drift @xmath3 and volatility @xmath4 , and @xmath5 is the time .",
    "suppose @xmath6 is a predictable self - financing trading strategy with the corresponding linear wealth @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is the fraction of this wealth invested in foreign bonds .",
    "self - finance of the strategy means that given @xmath9 one has @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the brownian motion .",
    "the optimal consumption problem consists in finding the strategy @xmath12 which provides the expected wealth @xmath13 at maturity @xmath14 such that @xmath15 , while minimizing the variance of @xmath16 , i.e. @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the expectation conditional to the initial moment @xmath19 . by using the lagrange multiplier @xmath20 and the function @xmath21 $ ] ,",
    "the previous statement is equivalent to the solution of the hamilton - jacobi - bellman ( hjb ) problem @xmath22    as at @xmath19 function @xmath23 does nt depend on @xmath24 , so does the solution @xmath25 , and thus reduces to @xmath26,\\ ] ] where @xmath27 . assuming @xmath28 ( see @xcite for further discussion ) , has an explicit solution @xmath29 that can be substituted back to to give rise to the following problem for @xmath30 : @xmath31 this is a nonlinear equation of our interest .",
    "based on the initial condition @xmath32 it can be solved analytically by representing @xmath30 as a quadratic form of @xmath33 with the coefficients being a function of @xmath34 .",
    "further details can be found in @xcite .      in @xcite carr",
    "considers the call option price @xmath35 , with @xmath36 being the underlying spot price , to be the result of a maximization of some function , @xmath37 , with respect to some variable , @xmath38 , holding the parameters @xmath36 and @xmath5 constant .",
    "he shows that if the call value @xmath35 is a convex function of @xmath36 , then @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the legendre - fenchel transform of the call value @xmath41 , namely : @xmath42 $ ] .",
    "he also shows that if the call value @xmath35 is a convex differentiable function of @xmath36 , the argument @xmath38 of the function @xmath43 is also the argument @xmath38 of the legendre - fenchel transform @xmath40 of @xmath41 , and is also the delta of the call , i.e. @xmath44 .",
    "this result motivates his dual approach to option pricing .",
    "that means that in the standard ( primal ) approach to option pricing , the spot price process @xmath36 is an input to the approach , while the stochastic process followed by the delta of the option is an output of the approach .",
    "in contrast , the carr s dual approach begins by specifying a stochastic process for the delta @xmath38 of a call , rather than for the spot price @xmath36 of the underlying asset .    further on",
    ", carr considers a forward contract on the same underlying and assumes that the value @xmath45 of the forward contract solves the stochastic differential equation : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a local volatility function . in other words",
    ", @xmath45 follows an arithmetic brownian motion",
    ". then the call value function @xmath48 $ ] solves the following parabolic pde : [ cpde ] a^2 ( x , t ) c_11(x , t ) + c_2(x , t ) = 0 , x , t [ 0,t ) .",
    "subject to the terminal condition : [ ctc ] c(x , t ) = x^+ , x . here",
    "@xmath49 is the expectation under the risk - neutral measure , sub - index @xmath50 in @xmath51 in carr s notation means the first derivative on the first argument of @xmath52 , and subindex @xmath53 denotes same with respect to the second argument .",
    "accordingly , @xmath54 is the second derivative on the first argument .    alternatively to the primal approach",
    ", in the dual approach carr introduces @xmath55 to be now a function of @xmath56 , so the option price in these variables @xmath57 is c^*(p , t ) p x(p , t ) - c(x(p , t),t ) , p ( 0,1 ) , t [ 0,t ) [ lt ] accordingly , under some mild assumptions the first derivative of @xmath58 on the first argument is [ ltd ] c^*_1(p , t ) = x(p , t ) + p x_1(p , t ) - c_1(x(p , t),t ) x_1(p , t ) = x(p , t ) , since @xmath59 , and [ ltd1a ] c^*_11(p , t ) = x_1(p , t ) = , p , t [ 0,t ) , by the inverse function theorem . since @xmath60 implies @xmath61 , @xmath62 is convex in @xmath38 .",
    "also based on the properties of the legendre transform @xmath63 , and thus [ ilt ] c(x , t ) = x c^*(p(x , t),t ) - c^*(p(x , t),t ) , x , t [ 0,t ) .    using it s lemma , carr also derives an important relationship between @xmath64 - the function relating the volatility of the delta process @xmath65 to the level of the call delta @xmath66 and to time @xmath67 : [ ddg ] v^2(p , t ) c^*_11(p , t ) = c_11(x(p , t),t ) a^2(x(p , t),t ) , p ( 0,1 ) , t [ 0,t ) . and finally a dual pde : [ cpded ] v^2(p , t ) c^*_11(p , t ) - c^*_2(p , t )",
    "= 0 , p ( 0,1 ) , t [ 0,t ) , subject to the terminal condition [ tcc2 ] _ t t c^*(p , t ) = x 1(x > 0 ) - x^+ = 0 .",
    "while the standard pde in is commonly referred to as a backward equation , the dual pde in is a forward equation .    despite this",
    "was not discovered in @xcite , we will show how to translate to the nonlinear pde .",
    "the above consideration implicitly assumes that the local volatility function @xmath64 of the delta process is known somehow for all necessary values of @xmath38 and @xmath5 .",
    "and then the forward pde with the terminal condition solves the problem . from a practical point of view this assumption , however , could be unrealistic in a sense that the market does nt provide @xmath64 explicitly . at the first glance one of the possible approaches to overcome",
    "this could be first to solve the backward problem , and then use the condition to restore @xmath64 from the precomputed values of the option gammas @xmath68 given a map @xmath69 . however , this is not fully correct . indeed , suppose that we solved the backward problem , e.g. , using a finite difference method , and now have @xmath68 at every point on the two - dimensional grid in @xmath70 .",
    "hence , at @xmath19 we have the values of @xmath71 on this grid .",
    "assume that we now want to solve the forward problem , and use these values of @xmath38 as our @xmath38 grid .",
    "further on , let us make one step in time forward with a time step @xmath72 . obviously , @xmath73 . therefore ,",
    "if we still use the @xmath38-grid constructed by using the values @xmath74 with the @xmath55-grid fixed at @xmath19 , the inverse map @xmath75 does nt coincide with @xmath76 . as a consequence ,",
    "the values of @xmath77 and @xmath68 defined at the @xmath55 grid has to be re - interpolated at time @xmath72 onto the @xmath78 grid .",
    "even worse , for doing that we need to know @xmath78 which correspond to the @xmath38 grid defined at @xmath19 .",
    "so either we need also to store in memory all values of @xmath79 during the backward recursion , or use the connection @xmath80 . in the later case",
    "the forward linear equation becomes nonlinear , because based on we need to use the map @xmath81 where @xmath55 , in turn , is a function of @xmath62 .",
    "below when presenting the numerical results we will discuss the peculiarities of the map @xmath81 in more detail .",
    "also it is worth mentioning that this approach , in general , has some pitfalls .",
    "first , once the backward problem is solved , most likely we do nt need the solution of the dual problem .",
    "a possible exclusion is related to valuation of the long - dated options .",
    "second , storing all values of gammas ( and perhaps deltas ) on the grid in @xmath55 and @xmath5 could be memory consuming .",
    "therefore , we present an alternative view to this problem .    in doing that below we relax the above assumption that the local volatility function @xmath64 of @xmath82 is known .",
    "instead we assume that the only local volatility @xmath83 of the forward process @xmath45 is known .",
    "we express it in the new variables @xmath84 , and to eliminate any confusion introduce new notation for thus expressed function @xmath85 , namely @xmath86 .",
    "note , that in order to build a map @xmath87 we still need to know the option values @xmath88 and deltas @xmath89 at @xmath19 which depend on the option expiration @xmath14 .    as per this assumption",
    "@xmath64 is now not an independent input of the model .",
    "rather , it is determined by where @xmath90 , in turn , connects to @xmath91 by .",
    "collecting all these expressions together and rearranging terms we arrive at the following equation .",
    "@xmath92    this is a nonlinear equation with the terminal condition given by . to the best of our knowledge",
    "this type of equations has not been considered in the theory of the nonlinear pdes as well as in mathematical finance with the exception of the lipton case considered earlier in this section .    despite a lack of the initial condition ,",
    "this is still a forward equation in a sense that the calendar time @xmath5 runs from 0 to @xmath14 .",
    "however , because of the terminal condition , this problem is not the standard cauchy boundary problem . in physics",
    "this type of problems is well - known and usually is solved using either invariant imbedding , @xcite , or the shooting method , @xcite .",
    "therefore , the main contributions of this paper are i ) recognition that the carr s dual approach gives rise to a certain type of non - linear pdes , that in the simplest form of the local volatility function linear in the underlying process have a predecessors , see @xcite , but in general are more complex ; and ii ) an algorithm of how to efficiently solve these equations using a finite - difference method .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we make analysis of the derived nonlinear pde and also provide an example ( a black - scholes setting ) when it can be solved analytically . in section  [ nm1 ] we propose a new numerical method to solve the full nonlinear equation which is unconditionally stable and of the second order of approximation in space and time . in section  [ ne1 ]",
    "we present some numerical experiments and discuss their results .",
    "the final section concludes and provides suggestions for the future research .",
    "a direct analysis shows that despite an unusual form is well behaved .",
    "indeed , the legendre transform s gamma @xmath91 is nonnegative , therefore the legendre transform s theta should also be nonnegative .",
    "as @xmath93 this means that when @xmath5 runs forward the values of @xmath58 decrease in the absolute value and in the limit @xmath94 reach their correct terminal value @xmath95 . on the other hand , as @xmath68 has a bell - shaped profile , @xmath91 as per has an inverse bell - shaped profile .",
    "in other words , for deep itm and otm options @xmath91 tends to infinity , while close to atm it is positive and close to zero .",
    "that means that @xmath96 is zero at @xmath97 and @xmath98 and is positive at the intermediate values of @xmath38 .",
    "so the evolution of @xmath58 should be that as presented in fig .",
    "[ figforw ] .",
    "it turns out that also admits a dual representation . to show this ,",
    "we start with , take into account and also the equation [ ltd2 ] c^*_2(p , t ) = p x_2(p , t ) - c_1(x(p , t),t ) x_2(p , t ) - c_2(x(p , t),t ) = - c_2(x(p , t),t ) , derived in @xcite ( since @xmath59 ) . also use the definition of delta to be @xmath99 and make a change of time from forward @xmath5 to backward @xmath100 .",
    "thus transformed now reads @xmath101      consider a particular case when the local volatility function is @xmath102 . in other words",
    "this corresponds to the displaced lognormal model @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the option strike . substituting this definition of @xmath83 into we arrive at the following nonlinear equation @xmath105 one",
    "can easily see that this is exactly despite with subject to different boundary and initial conditions .",
    "we remind that in @xcite was solved by assuming that ( in this section notation ) @xmath58 is a quadratic function of @xmath38 .",
    "however , in our case this ansatz does nt obey the boundary and terminal conditions for @xmath58 .",
    "nevertheless , admits a semi - explicit closed form solution .    to obtain this solution , we re - write the definition of @xmath58 in in the form @xmath106 . as we assumed that @xmath102 , @xmath45 obeys the following stochastic sde ( geometric brownian motion ) @xmath107 by the feynman - kac theorem @xmath88 solves @xmath108 subject to the following conditions @xmath109    the explicit solution of can be obtained as a sum of two branches .",
    "at @xmath110 the solution is @xmath111 .",
    "indeed , this expression solves as well as obeys the terminal condition and the boundary condition at infinity .    at @xmath112 gives the price of the up - and - out call with the upper barrier at @xmath104 and the strike @xmath113 written on the negative process @xmath45",
    "( so @xmath114 ) .",
    "therefore , it reads , see @xcite @xmath115 .",

    "also at @xmath125 we have @xmath126 .",
    "thus , these two branches of @xmath88 solve , provide the correct boundary values , and obey the terminal condition .",
    "what remains to prove is that this solution is continuous at @xmath127 .",
    "indeed , the first branch at @xmath110 in the limit @xmath128 provides @xmath129 .",
    "the second branch at @xmath130 in the limit @xmath128 also provides @xmath131 .",
    "the latter is not obvious because @xmath132 , and it seems that the first term in the square brackets in multiplied by @xmath133 does nt converge to 0 at @xmath134 .",
    "however , one has to have in mind , that is obtained by using the method of images . and",
    "it could be shown that at @xmath128 the second line in vanishes regardless of the value in the square brackets , because the multiplier @xmath133 vanishes .",
    "thus , we managed to solve in closed form .",
    "now by @xmath135 where @xmath136 \\\\ & - y \\left [ n(d_1(z , t , k ) ) - n(d_2(z , t , k ) ) - \\dfrac{\\phi(z , t , k)}{\\sigma \\sqrt{t } }   - 2\\dfrac{k}{y } 1_{y \\ne 0}\\right ] , \\\\",

    "observe that @xmath138    from this expression @xmath139 thus @xmath140\\ ] ] where @xmath141 means the inverse function .",
    "having an explicit representation for @xmath142 this map @xmath137 can be computed numerically .",
    "aside of this example the obvious question is : how to solve with allowance for all its peculiarities and non - linearity . for doing that below we propose an iterative numerical scheme which assumes that the initial value @xmath143 is somehow known .",
    "as our intention is to solve numerically , and , moreover , iteratively , we introduce index @xmath144 which counts the current iteration number .",
    "index @xmath144 starts from 1 and runs up to a certain number at which the scheme converges in some norm . also for simplicity of notation in this section",
    "we omit superscript @xmath145 in the definition of the legendre transformed option price @xmath58 , and use @xmath146 instead of @xmath52 .",
    "thus , below we denote it as @xmath147 .",
    "we start by re - writing in the form @xmath148 where @xmath149 ^ 2,\\ ] ] if @xmath150 is a function of @xmath38 and @xmath5 only , would be a linear heat equation .",
    "however , in our case @xmath150 itself is a function of @xmath58 , and even worse - a function of its derivative @xmath151 .",
    "nevertheless , the discrete solution of the could be represented in the operator form @xmath152 where @xmath153 is a finite difference approximation of the second derivative @xmath154 on the grid .",
    "for instance , on a uniform grid in @xmath38 with step @xmath155 @xmath156\\ ] ] which approximates @xmath151 with @xmath157 . by using taylor series expansion of it",
    "could be validated that this scheme approximates with @xmath157 and is exact in @xmath158 .",
    "note that again , using the taylor series expansion one can verify that the following scheme @xmath159 also provides same order of approximation of in @xmath155 . combining them together",
    "we finally propose to use a scheme @xmath160 \\triangle \\right\\ } c(p , t)\\ ] ]    now we setup an iterative algorithm to solve this discrete nonlinear equation .    1 .   at the first iteration we re - write in the form @xmath161 in the expression",

    "the could be solved by either computing the discrete matrix exponential given the grid in @xmath38 ( which could be done with complexity @xmath166 , @xmath167 be the number of the grid points ) , or by using any sort of pde approximation of the exponent .",
    "for instance , pde approximation @xmath168 leads to the well - known crank - nicholson scheme which could be solved with the linear complexity in @xmath167 .",
    "2 .   to proceed",
    "we represent in the form @xmath169 \\triangle \\right\\ } c^{(k-1)}(p , t+\\delta t)\\ ] ] so the next approximation @xmath170 to @xmath171 can be found by again either computing the matrix exponential , or by using some pde approximation . having this machinery in hands we can proceed in the same manner until the entire procedure converges , i.e. the condition @xmath172 is reached after @xmath144 iterations with @xmath173 being the method tolerance .    to apply this algorithm",
    "we construct an appropriate discrete nonuniform grid @xmath174 in the delta space . for the sake of concreteness let be solved at the space domain @xmath175 : \\ p_0 =   0 $ ] , @xmath176 using a nonuniform grid with @xmath177 nodes ( @xmath178 ) and space steps @xmath179 .",

    "see appendix .",
    "in the first test we solve the problem assuming that the local volatility function @xmath64 is known . for doing that we first solve the backward problem using the following parameters of the model @xmath183 yrs .",
    "our grid contained @xmath184 nodes in @xmath55 and 100 steps in time .",
    "we used the local volatility function @xmath83 given in table  [ locvol1 ]    .local volatility function @xmath83 of @xmath45 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the non - uniform grid in @xmath55 was constructed similar to @xcite .",
    "we solved the backward equation to obtain the option prices and deltas on the grid at @xmath19 , and then used such obtained deltas @xmath79 as a @xmath38 grid .",
    "this simultaneously provided us with the map @xmath185    using thus obtained values of @xmath186 we computed the legendre transform @xmath58 at @xmath19 using the definition in .",
    "we then solved forward in time . as was mentioned in the previous sections ,",
    "this equation is nonlinear , because in we computed the map @xmath81 using the relation @xmath187 .",
    "therefore , we solved it using an iterative scheme similar to . having that map at every iteration we re - interpolated the values of @xmath188 found and stored during the backward run to the corresponding grid in @xmath38 .    in fig .",
    "[ figback ] the computed results are presented in four graphs .",
    "the top left graph shows the initial function @xmath143 computed using the solution of the backward equation , and the final solution @xmath189 computed using .",
    "the top right plot in fig .  [ figback ] demonstrates the map @xmath190 computed using the solution of the backward equation at @xmath19 .",
    "the bottom right graph represents our local volatility function @xmath83 given in table .  . and",
    "the bottom left graph shows @xmath64 computed in this experiment .",
    "it is seen that the legendre transform converges to its terminal value @xmath95 .",
    "two important points , however , should be taken into account .",
    "first , the solution is very sensitive to the accuracy of gammas .",
    "suppose that the backward equation is solved using a standard , second order accurate in space , scheme .",
    "then the accuracy of gamma is @xmath191 which is not sufficient ( and could be error - prone ) for computing @xmath192 .",
    "therefore , in this situation it would be reasonable to use a higher order scheme in @xmath55 or @xmath38 , for instance a hoc finite difference scheme of the forth order , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "second , when @xmath94 our map @xmath81 degenerates . indeed ,",
    "if we fix @xmath55 , at @xmath19 the map @xmath81 is regular , i.e. for every @xmath55 it provides a unique value of @xmath38 . at @xmath125 for the call option for any @xmath55 the value of @xmath38 could be either 0 or 1 . therefore , multiple values of @xmath55 are connected to the same value of @xmath38 . obviously , the inverse statement is also true .",
    "suppose that at @xmath19 we fix the grid in @xmath38 , and then for every @xmath38 a unique value of @xmath193 could be found .",
    "however , at @xmath125 all these values of @xmath38 will connect to the value @xmath127 , because @xmath187 and @xmath194 .",
    "this degeneracy of the map produces additional problems with computing the accurate values of @xmath64 .",
    "[ map ] shows computed plot of @xmath81 obtained in this experiment .",
    "it is seen that at @xmath19 this plot replicates the top right graph in fig .",
    "[ figback ] , and at @xmath125 it vanishes .    in the second test",
    "we solve the problem .",
    "again we first solve the backward problem and find the initial values of @xmath143 as was described in above . and then using the scheme propagate the solution forward in calendar time @xmath5 up to the maturity @xmath14 .    in fig .",
    "[ figforw ] thus computed results are presented in two graphs similar to the left top and bottom ones in fig ,  [ figback ] .",
    "observe , that the option value at @xmath125 is equal to payoff , hence the option gamma @xmath195 is the dirac s delta function .",
    "accordingly , the local delta volatility @xmath196 is also the delta function if the local forward volatility @xmath83 is finite .",
    "that brings some technical difficulties to the numerical solution .",
    "the computed value of @xmath64 is depicted in the right plot in fig .",
    "[ figforw ] . at every",
    "@xmath5 this function demonstrates the correct behavior by vanishing at @xmath97 and @xmath98 , and showing a positive bell - shaped profile at the intermediate values . at @xmath94",
    "it tends to the delta function .",
    "the accuracy of the solution , accordingly , significantly drops down .",
    "certainly , for our scheme the number of iterations to converge depends on the chosen level of tolerance @xmath173 .",
    "our experiments show that this number significantly depends on the smoothness of @xmath64 at every time step .",
    "as gammas are computed by numerical differentiation , producing a smooth local volatility function similar in the shape to the dirac s delta function is not simple .",
    "as we already mentioned , even if the second order scheme in @xmath38 is used to find @xmath58 , gammas are computed with the approximation @xmath191 .",
    "therefore , at every iteration after the solution was computed a polynomial smoothing was applied .",
    "in particular , we fitted the solution with the polynomial of the 4th order , and then computed the second derivative of this polynomial .",
    "this provides a significant speedup in convergence .",
    "if gammas were computed by numerical differentiation , at the first time step the number of iterations @xmath144 was the highest , while when @xmath5 increases @xmath144 rapidly decreases .",
    "for instance , in the above test at @xmath197 the first step in time requires 280 iterations , while starting from the time step 6 it decreases to 5 iterations per one time step .",
    "however , still at some values of the model parameters the entire scheme could diverge .",
    "nevertheless , when using the polynomial fit the typical number of iterations was 2 - 3 at every time step even with @xmath198 , and the scheme rapidly converged .",
    "we need to underline that despite the dual problem was formulated in subject to the given terminal condition , here we solved this problem assuming that the initial condition at @xmath19 is known from the solution of the backward pde .",
    "we then demonstrated that this solution converges to the correct terminal value of @xmath58 within the error of our numerical procedure .",
    "that is definitely because we used the correct initial value .",
    "if , however , the initial condition is not known , one can use either the shooting method , or the invariant imbedding method referenced in the above .",
    "this , certainly , will significantly increase the computational time .",
    "this paper deals with a certain type of nonlinear pde which naturally appears in mathematical finance when solving some problems formulated as optimization . as the known examples of these problems we considered an optimal consumption problem presented in @xcite and then in detail in @xcite and a dual approach to option pricing invented by @xcite .",
    "we showed that carr s dual equation can be translated into the nonlinear pde , and that the nonlinear pde of @xcite is a particular case of the former when the volatility function is linear in the underlying variable .",
    "further on , we described some properties of the general nonlinear pde , provided its analytical solution in the black - scholes case , and proposed a new numerical method to solve it which is unconditionally stable and of the second order in both time and space .",
    "stability of the method and approximation are proved by the corresponding theorem formulated and proved in the paper .",
    "we also presented some results of our numerical experiments .",
    "all these results are new .    as far as the practical applications of this approach is concerned , as mentioned in @xcite , for some valuation problems",
    ", it may in fact be easier to specify the problem in the dual domain .",
    "this could be important , e.g. , for doing delta hedge for equity options , or in the fx market where the quotes are expressed in terms of implied volatility as a function of the black scholes delta . also for american options working in the delta space would make it much easier to setup the exercise boundary .",
    "therefore , it does make sense to extend the dual technology , and , perhaps , also including jumps into consideration . from this prospective",
    ", these extensions would require new numerical methods for nonlinear pdes most likely similar to those considered in this paper .",
