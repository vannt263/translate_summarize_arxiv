    "a pitch class set is a set of pitches where octaves are equivalent , and enharmonically equivalent pitches are identified .  in music theory , the z - relation links two different set classes with the same interval vector .",
    "@xmath2-tone equal temperament is represented by pitch classes @xmath3 .  for a given",
    "set @xmath4 the _ interval vector _ measures the number of ways the interval @xmath5 can be spanned between members of @xmath6.@xmath7the _ interval function _ of two sets @xmath6 and @xmath8 , introduced by david lewin in @xcite , is the number of times any @xmath9 in @xmath6 has its @xmath5-transpose in @xmath8 , namely:@xmath10where @xmath11  is the indicator function defined by @xmath12 if @xmath13 and @xmath14 otherwise .",
    "if the sets @xmath6 and @xmath8 are equal , the interval function is the interval vector .",
    "the _ interval content _ is the set of first digits of the interval vector , ( @xmath15))$ ] , except that the last one is divided by 2 if @xmath1 is even .",
    "for example , the interval vector of the set \\{0 , 1 , 3 , 4 , 7 , 9 } is ( 6 , 2 , 2 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 4 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 2 , 2 ) , and its interval content is ( 2,2,4,3,2,2 ) .",
    "two sets @xmath6 and @xmath8 of @xmath0 are said to be @xmath16-related if they have the same interval content:@xmath17 in other words , @xmath6 and @xmath8 share the same interval function , or the same interval vector . since transposing or inverting",
    "do not change the interval content , we get a lot of trivially @xmath16-related sets .  to avoid trivial cases , we consider set classes up to transposition and inversion , that is under the action of the dihedral group .",
    "the first well - known example was given by lino patterson in 1944 :    @xmath18    if we draw the two sets of points on a circle representing @xmath19 , we will see that the distances between the points are the same but the points are in different arrangements .",
    "the two sets share the same interval content @xmath20 ( meaning from left to right that there are 2 pairs with distance 1 , 1 pair with distance 2 , 2 pairs with distance 3 , and 1 pair with distance 4 ) . in dealing with finite abelian groups @xmath0",
    ", it will be convenient to use polynomial notation .",
    "the polynomial representing the set @xmath6 of @xmath0  is the polynomial whose exponents are the elements of @xmath6:@xmath21the _ reflection _ of @xmath6 is the polynomial whose exponents are the inversion @xmath22 of @xmath6 mod @xmath1@xmath23@xmath24 denotes the inversion @xmath25 . by definition ,",
    "the _ patterson function _ of the set @xmath6 is the autocorrelation function given by the convolution product@xmath26modulo @xmath27 .",
    "the patterson function is an equivalent of the interval function , since we have the following result .",
    "the coefficients of the patterson function are equal to the components of the interval function.@xmath28    two sets @xmath6 and @xmath8  of @xmath0  are said to be _ homometric _ if they have the same patterson function .",
    "the musical concept of z - related sets coincides with the crystallographic notion of homometric sets .",
    "_ example .",
    "_  for @xmath29 and @xmath30 it is easy to verify the previous result . @xmath31",
    "in @xmath0 , the set @xmath6 is trivially homometric under the action of the dihedral group , that is under all inversions @xmath32 and transpositions @xmath33 , where inversions are defined by @xmath34 , and transpositions are defined by @xmath35    moreover , let @xmath6 and @xmath8 be subsets of @xmath0 , then @xmath6 and @xmath8 are said to be _ trivially homometric _ if they belong to the same orbit under the action of the dihedral .",
    "if @xmath6 and @xmath8 are homometric but not trivially homometric , then they are _",
    "strictly homometric_.",
    "thus the z - relation is equivalent to strict homometry .    in 1944 , patterson @xcite established the following two results :    \\(1 ) if two subsets of a regular @xmath1-gon are homometric then their complements are .",
    "@xmath36(2 ) every @xmath1-point subset of a regular @xmath37-gon is homometric to its complement .    in terms of music theory ,",
    "the @xmath1-note set @xmath6 of the @xmath37-tone equal temperament is in z - relation with its complement @xmath38 .",
    "for example , for @xmath39 , the 4-note set @xmath40 of @xmath19 and its complement @xmath41 are in z - relation since    @xmath42    if we consider now the multiplication by an integer @xmath43 modulo @xmath1 , it is easy to show that the z - relation is stable by multiplication .  more precisely , let @xmath6  be a set in @xmath44 @xmath43 an integer such that @xmath45 and @xmath46 then the interval content @xmath47 is in general different from @xmath48 , where @xmath49 denotes the multiplication by @xmath43 modulo @xmath50 @xmath51 .",
    "we have@xmath52    _ example_. in the usual temperament ( @xmath29 ) , since the two complementary sets @xmath53 and @xmath54 are in z - relation with interval content @xmath55 we get a new homometric pairs by mutliplying each set by 5 .",
    "thus , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are z - related with a new interval content equal to @xmath58    _ remark_. unfortunately , not all z - related pairs are coming from complement nor multiplication , @xmath59 or @xmath60 .",
    "for example , for @xmath61 , the sets @xmath62 and @xmath63 are z - related but @xmath8 is neither the complementary set of @xmath6 , nor a multiple set of @xmath6 ( @xmath64  for @xmath65 ) .    by adding the transposed set to the initial set",
    ", we get some new theorems :    let a and b be two z - related sets in @xmath0 , and @xmath66 the transposition in @xmath67 ( @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath37 ) , then we have@xmath70    or more generally ,    let a and b be two z - related sets in @xmath0 , and @xmath71 the transpositions in @xmath72 , then we have@xmath73    the same can be done with the multiplication .",
    "let @xmath74 and @xmath43 be an integer such that @xmath75 and @xmath76 , @xmath49 be the multiplication and @xmath71 the transpositions in @xmath77 then we have@xmath78    _ example_. starting from the homometric pair @xmath79 the multiple relation of @xmath80 and @xmath81 leads to the new pair :    @xmath82    in 2008 , orourke , taslakian and toussaint @xcite gave a new procedure for generating homometric pairs called the _ pumping lemma , _ based on adding points around isospectral vertices ( see their paper for details ) .",
    "we propose another new procedure starting with not one , but two homometric pairs . in the general case ,",
    "this procedure is lengthy and will be published elsewhere .",
    "we consider here an example .",
    "choose two suitable pairs .",
    "for example @xmath83 and @xmath84place the first of each pair on a circle of 10 points ( fig . 1 , left ) , and add the second of each pair on the circle as shown on fig",
    ". 1 ( center ) .  on each of the two points connected by a diameter",
    ", we can add @xmath9 points , leading to the new relation ( fig .",
    "1 right)@xmath85remark that the number of added points is always even , even if they are several diameters .",
    "the aim of the pumping lemma or of this procedure is to find a way of establishing general relations , such as this one , established empirically.for @xmath86 , we have@xmath87rosenblatt gave a complete classification of z - related pairs of length 4 :    if @xmath88 with @xmath89 then @xmath6 and @xmath8 are of the following two types :    \\(i ) in @xmath90 , @xmath91    @xmath92    \\(ii ) in @xmath93 ,    @xmath94    but the question of finding the classification of all z - related pairs for @xmath95 is still open ( see @xcite ) .",
    "enumeration of z - related sets was studied by patterson , and later by others , including brger @xcite and chieh @xcite .",
    "patterson @xcite  was the first to demonstrate the existence of @xmath96-uples of homometric sets . for @xmath97 homometric sets",
    "are well known .",
    "some progress has been made for complementary  homometric pairs with @xmath1 even . but",
    "from @xmath98 non - complementary homometric pairs appear .",
    "in @xcite david lewin rediscovered , and brought to the attention of the music - theoretic community , the existence of the z - triples for @xmath99 , and jon wild @xcite has previously entabulated all homometric tuplets for @xmath100 , with tuplets of 15-note sets with as many as 16 members in @xmath101 .",
    "but enumeration is still an open problem .",
    "our computation led to the following table .  for each @xmath9-note sets ,",
    "the table gives the number of ( distinct ) interval vectors in @xmath0 for which non - trivial homometric tuples exist ( sets are considered up to inversion and transpositions ) .",
    "for example , for @xmath99 , there are 31 non - trivial homometric tuples of @xmath102 notes .",
    "( in fact , 28 homometric pairs +  3homometric triplets ) .",
    "@xmath103    italics indicate the existence of tuples ( @xmath104 ) . for @xmath29",
    ", there are 19 homometric pairs ( 1 + 3 + 15 ) .",
    "@xmath105    the first triple appears for @xmath99 and length 6:@xmath106and the first quadruple is obtained for @xmath61 and length 9 ( in fact , there are 54 quadruples ) .",
    "there are three quintuples for @xmath107 , @xmath108 , one sextuple for @xmath107 , @xmath109 and one octuple for @xmath107 _ _ , _ _ @xmath110 : a very impressive property of the quarter - tone universe.@xmath111",
    "since our interest is to give a fast algorithm of finding all homometric sets , one way is to understand how they are organized and to answer the question : is there a non - trivial group action representing the z - relation ( such that the orbits are the equivalence classes of the z - relation ) ?",
    "if you look at a subgroup of the linear group , you certainly do not find a solution , as shown by mandereau _",
    "et al . _",
    "but if you look at a subgroup of the permutation group @xmath112 , you will find a nice non - trivial solution .",
    "considering the set @xmath113 of all transpositions and inversions for a given @xmath1 of all homometric sets of length @xmath9 , the automorphism group of @xmath113 is clearly a solution of the problem . in other words ,",
    "the group is a subgroup of @xmath112whose action on the power set of @xmath0 stabilizes @xmath113 . to compute this automorphism group ,",
    "the idea is to use a well - known object in combinatorial block design known as the _ levi graph _ @xmath114 .",
    "denoting the homometric sets @xmath115 , the vertex set of the levi graph is @xmath116 the @xmath1 first elements of @xmath117 have one color and the @xmath113  elements have a second color .",
    "the edge set is defined by : @xmath118as is well known , the automorphism group of the levi graph is the same as the automorphism group of @xmath119 thus , the problem is to compute the automorphism group of a vertex - colored graph , which is done by a c program .",
    "the information is provided in the form of a set of generators , the size of the group and the orbits of the group .  after this computation ,",
    "the difficulty is to give a nice representation of the orbits of the group .",
    "let s have a look at some examples .    _",
    "example 1_. the simplest example is to compute the automorphism group of the homometric sets for @xmath120 .  as we know",
    ", there is only one z - related pair , but 16 transpositions and inversions .",
    "the pair    @xmath121    leads to a set @xmath113 of 16 elements .",
    "the automorphism group is generated by four generators @xmath122 @xmath123 @xmath124 @xmath125 .",
    "the group has only one orbit , and is represented on fig  2 .",
    "the inner circle ( dihedral class of the homometric set \\{0,1,2,5 } ) is linked by permutation @xmath126 to the outer circle ( dihedral class of the homometric set \\{0,1,3,4 } ) .",
    "-related pairs , height=264 ]    _ example 2_. for @xmath29 , the automorphism group of the 48homometric sets generated by the pair @xmath127 , @xmath128 of length 4 , has six generators .",
    "@xmath129    its representation is a rather complicated graph .",
    "the automorphism group of the 108  homometric sets of length 5 has three generators : @xmath130tom johnson @xcite  demonstrated that the homometric sets of length 5 can be graphed with less than six transformations , as one can see in the concentric circles of fig .",
