    "dynamo simulations aim to capture the magnetic field generation process in planetary and stellar interiors and have been very successful in qualitatively reproducing many of the observed properties  @xcite .",

    "many attempts have been made earlier to derive a scaling theory for the mean magnetic field , for example , on force balance considerations  @xcite . however , none of the suggested scaling laws was generally accepted .",
    "progress was made in this regard due to the increase in computational power in the last decade .",
    "@xcite analyzed the results of parameter studies of dynamo simulations under the boussinesq approximation in a rotating spherical shell and found that mean velocity and mean magnetic field scale as a function of the available convective power generated via buoyancy forces . the power - based scaling laws ( hereafter referred to as pbs )",
    "do not explicitly depend on rotation rate in case of magnetic field scaling . in the parameter range of the simulations ,",
    "a secondary influence of diffusivities in the form of magnetic prandtl number ( ratio of viscosity and magnetic diffusivity ) was found .",

    "@xcite maintain that including a dependence on the magnetic prandtl number is mandatory for an adequate fit , at least in the parameter range of current numerical simulations .",
    "@xcite recently provided interesting theoretical arguments supporting the power based scaling laws .    the agreement between the prediction of scaling laws derived from boussinesq numerical simulations and observed magnetic fields in low - mass stars is rather puzzling .",
    "unlike the dynamo mechanism in solar type stars , where the strong differential rotation and magnetic field generation by shear at the tachocline are thought to be a key ingredient  @xcite , rapidly rotating low - mass stars ( @xmath0 ) and giant planets possibly harbor dynamos similar to the geodynamo , where helical convection columns aligned with the rotation axis are instrumental .",
    "however , the hydrogen rich interiors of low - mass stars are vastly different from the liquid metal interiors of the earth - like objects .",
    "the density and transport properties in the liquid core of the latter vary by some tens of percent ( e.g.  @xmath1 20% density change across earth s liquid core ; see  @xcite ) and can be considered constant . on the other hand ,",
    "the interiors of gas planets and stars have significant density stratification and transport properties ( such as electrical conductivity and thermal diffusivity ) may vary by orders of magnitude  @xcite .",
    "the power based scaling laws discussed above were derived from a large number of boussinesq dynamo simulations .",
    "although density stratified models with radially - varying transport properties have been commonly employed in the stellar dynamo community ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , a systematic scaling study of important diagnostic quantities has never been carried out .",
    "one of the reasons is the substantial increase in computational requirements associated with anelastic density - stratified dynamo simulations which makes parameter studies rather expensive  @xcite . for nonmagnetic rotating convection",
    ", @xcite found in systematic model studies that the velocity of convection and of zonal flow scales in the same way for boussinesq and anelastic cases .",

    "the magnetic energy is the product of power and magnetic dissipation time and is therefore also independent of the rotation rate .",
    "if magnetic field is only a function of power , dimensional arguments dictate that it must depend on the cubic root of the power .",

    "in this study we analyze a large number of numerical simulations of dynamo in rapidly rotating spherical shells to infer empirical scaling laws for mean velocity and mean magnetic field .",
    "our database contains anelastic compressible dynamos with different shell thicknesses , different density stratifications with density contrast upto @xmath141 , and radially varying transport properties ( viscosity , thermal diffusivity , magnetic diffusivity ) .",
    "these models capture , in a simplified way , conditions that are relevant for rapidly rotating gas planets and low - mass stars .",
    "our study shows that it is possible to relate flow velocity and magnetic field strength to the available power , by a single scaling law in each case , for a wide range of different conditions .",
    "in particular the same scaling law covers incompressible cases and cases with strong density stratification .",
    "our finding sanctifies the application of the same magnetic field scaling by @xcite to such diverse objects as the earth s core and low - mass stars .",
    "our best - fitting power exponent of 0.45 for the rossby number , as a measure of the characteristic velocity , is very close to the value of 4/9 obtained by the scaling theory of @xcite which assumes a mac balance .",
    "our data are better collapsed when the rossby number is calculated only with the convective flow ( excluding the zonal and meridional flow component ) and the optimal exponent of 0.42 is intermediate between davidson s prediction and the value of 2/5 inferred from a cia balance @xcite . because our simulations may not have exactly reached an asymptotic regime , the precise value of the exponent and its theoretical justification remain somewhat uncertain .",
    "our data for the lorentz number which measures magnetic field strength are fully compatible with a cubic root dependence on the non - dimensional power ( after correcting for that part of the energy flux that does not contribute to magnetic field generation ) .",
    "this makes the scaling independent of the rotation rate , which is a central point in the scaling theory of @xcite . while both dipolar and multipolar dynamos follow basically the same scaling law , we find that in the dipolar case the field strength is larger by @xmath142 . in @xcite",
    "we attributed this difference to a slightly weaker flow velocity in dipolar dynamos , but in our present study we do not find a significant difference in the rossby number between dipolar and multipolar cases .",
    "however , we note that the ohmic dissipation time is systematically shorter for multipolar dynamos ( open symbols in fig .  [ tmag ] ) than it is for dipolar dynamos ( filled symbols ) , i.e. , the generated magnetic energy is more rapidly dissipated in the multipolar case , leading to a lower mean field strength .",
    "the reason for the longer dissipation time of dipolar dynamos could be that more magnetic energy is stored in large spatial scales where it is less vulnerable to dissipative destruction .",
    "although we find that boussinesq and anelastic dynamos are described by the same scaling laws , it must be noted that qualitative differences exist between the two . as compared to the boussinesq models ,",
    "flow velocity in anelastic models is faster and has smaller length scales in the outer parts of the fluid shell as compared to the deeper interior  @xcite .",
    "this difference affects the nature of the resulting dynamo .",
    "for instance , @xcite find that dipolar dynamos give away to multipolar ones as the density stratification is increased ( keeping other parameters the same ) .",
    "they argue that separation of the flow length scales makes the flow structure in highly stratified cases similar to convection in thin shell geometries which prefer non - dipolar dynamos  @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite show that models with variable electrical conductivity can push the dynamo generation to the deep interior and dipolar dynamos can be easily obtained for even highly stratified cases .",
    "the mismatch between the control parameters of numerical simulations and the astrophysical objects is mainly caused by the expected extremely low values of the various transport coefficients in the latter .",
    "the scaling laws we present here are expressed in terms of non - dimensional buoyancy power per unit mass , @xmath108 , which does not involve any diffusive parameters ( barring the small @xmath143 dependence ) .",

    "although the influence of @xmath114 in the scaling laws is secondary , its value in natural dynamos is several orders of magnitude lower than it is in the simulations .",
    "ignoring or including @xmath114 in the scaling laws makes a difference of nearly an order of magnitude in the prediction for planets or stars .",
    "@xcite argued that the @xmath114-dependence , although needed for fitting the model data at @xmath146 , would disappear in the astrophysically relevant range @xmath147 and @xcite found good agreement between prediction and observation in case of the earth s dynamo only when the dependence on the magnetic prandtl number is ignored .",
    "however , the assumption that the @xmath114-dependence vanishes at small values has not yet been confirmed by theory or by numerical simulations , which are not available for @xmath114 much smaller than one .",
    "another issue is the independence of magnetic field scaling from rotation rate that is implied by our scaling law . for low - mass stars a saturated ( rotation - rate independent ) magnetic surface flux",
    "is observed for very rapid rotators with low rossby number , but for larger values of the rossby number it decreases roughly proportionally with decreasing rotation rate  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite argues that the rotational dependence at large rossby number may enter through its influence on the ohmic dissipation factor @xmath128 , challenging the often made assumption that @xmath148 in all kinds of natural dynamos .",
    "one problem with applying our scaling laws to stars and planets is that they predict average values inside the dynamo , whereas observations usually relate to the strength of the magnetic field or part of the field at the surface of the object .",
    "the assumption that the two values can be related by a fixed factor is probably too simplistic .",
    "it is conceivable that a dependence of this factor on the rotation rate could contribute to the observed dependence of the surface magnetic flux on the rossby number in m - stars with moderate to low rotation rates .",
    "our work extends earlier studies  @xcite .",
    "it shows that previously found scaling laws for velocity and magnetic field strength in rotating dynamos also apply when strong radial variations in density or transport properties are present , as expected in the conducting cores of gas planets , brown dwarfs and low - mass stars .",
    "this strongly supports the notion that the power - based scaling laws are rather universal . for the magnetic field",
    "scaling there is a decent agreement with observation for several solar system planets and certain classes of stars  @xcite .",
    "however , the velocity scaling has not yet been tested against observation ( except for earth s core ) .",
    "this together with the open questions on the role of the magnetic prandtl number , the cause for weaker surface magnetic fields at less rapidly rotating stars , and the relation between internal and surface magnetic fields keep this research area vibrant and provide an exciting avenue for future explorations .",
