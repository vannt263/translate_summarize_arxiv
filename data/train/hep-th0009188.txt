    "recently , there has been a lot of progress in understanding @xmath0 chern - simons theory on @xmath1 and its related invariants , the knot invariants @xcite , from a topological string theory point of view @xcite . in a striking conjecture ,",
    "ooguri and vafa @xcite have proposed a formulation of knot invariants on @xmath1 from considerations of topological string theory amplitudes on the resolved conifold , based on earlier work by gopakumar and vafa@xcite that is similar in spirit to the celebrated ads / cft correspondence .",
    "this conjecture , which was tested for the simplest knot , called the unknot ( a circle in @xmath1 ) in @xcite and for the trefoil knot ( toral knot of type ( 2,3 )  ) by labastida and marino @xcite , provides an extremely interesting `` physical '' interpretation for the coefficients in the polynomial invariants .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to critically examine this conjecture for a wide class of knots using a simpler method of directly computing invariants for any knot or link carrying arbitrary representations of @xmath0 presented in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in @xcite , the structure of the knot invariants was deduced from topological string amplitudes in the presence of d-2 branes ending on d-4 branes , and the result was expressed in terms of certain integers representing the number of d-2 branes .",
    "this constitutes a physical interpretation of the integer coefficients appearing in two - variable homfly polynomials for knots . in @xcite ,",
    "this prediction was tested on the chern - simons field theory side for toral knots ( with explicit results for the right handed trefoil knot ) using the formulation of the toral knot operators introduced in @xcite .",
    "in particular , the authors in @xcite developed a group theory argument in relating the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of operators on the topological string theory side to invariants of knots carrying arbitrary @xmath0 representation in chern - simons theory .",
    "their explicit calculations for the right handed trefoil knot agreed with ooguri - vafa conjecture on the polynomials appearing in the vev of such operators@xcite .",
    "the computation becomes very tedious for knots with higher number of crossings within the toral knot operator formalism .",
    "we will use a simpler method @xcite for directly obtaining the invariants for any knot and link ( includes torus knots ) carrying arbitrary @xmath0 representations . then , incorporating the group theoretic results presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , we will compute the new polynomial invariants for a wide class of knots confirming ooguri - vafa conjecture .",
    "we can evaluate multi - component link invariants within chern - simons field theoretic framework but their relations to the observables on the topological closed string theory needs to be determined to check the conjecture .",
    "the organisation of the paper is as follows . in the first part of section 2 , we briefly recapitulate the salient features of the conjecture in @xcite .",
    "next , we review the procedure of @xcite in computing new polynomial invariants from invariants of knots carrying arbitrary @xmath0 representation . in section 3 ,",
    "we briefly present the method of directly calculating knot invariants for arbitrary representations of @xmath0 @xcite . in section 4",
    ", we present our results on knot and link invariants for arbitrary representations , upto 9 crossings . in section 5 , we conclude with discussions and comments on some open problems .",
    "in this section , we begin by briefly recapitulating the essential details of the argument of @xcite which proposes an equivalence between @xmath0 chern - simons gauge theory on @xmath1 and closed a - twisted topological string theory on the @xmath2 resolved conifold geometry . for a large @xmath3 gauge theory , in thooft s double line notation , denoting by @xmath4 the genus of the ( triangulated ) reimann surface formed by the double lines , and by @xmath5 the number of faces in the triangulation of this surface the free energy can be written as the summation @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the thooft coupling related to the perturbative gauge coupling constant @xmath8 by @xmath9 . for the case of chern - simons theory on @xmath1 , the coefficients @xmath10 were shown to be equal to the partition function of the a - twisted open topological string theory with @xmath4 handles and @xmath5 boundaries with the target space as the cotangent space of @xmath1 @xcite . in the context of d - branes , this implies that the chern - simons theory is equivalent to the open topological string theory obtained by wrapping @xmath3 d - branes on the base @xmath1 of the cotangent space . on the other hand , we can consider the cotangent space @xmath11 to be the deformed conifold that can , via a conifold transition , be resolved into the total space of the line bundle @xmath12 over @xmath2 . in @xcite , it was conjectured that the closed topological string theory on this resolved conifold geometry is dual to the @xmath0 chern - simons theory on @xmath1 with the khler parameter @xmath13 of the blown up @xmath2 being related by @xmath14 to the coupling constant @xmath15 of the chern - simons theory .",
    "elegant computations were done in @xcite , ( following earlier work done by these authors in @xcite ) in order to check this conjecture at the level of the free energy ( the vacuum amplitude @xmath16 of the gauge theory being related to the free energy as @xmath17 ) , and their results strongly supported the said conjecture .    in @xcite , this conjecture was further extended to the level of observables of the chern - simons theory , which are the gauge invariant and metric independent wilson loop operators @xmath18 associated with a knot @xmath19 , ( which is an embedding of a circle @xmath20 on a three manifold ) , and carrying an irreducible representation @xmath21 of the gauge group , in our case the gauge group being @xmath0 .",
    "these operators are defined in the usual way as trace of the holonomy @xmath22 : @xmath23\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath24 being the trace over the representation @xmath21 and p denotes path ordering .",
    "the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the wilson loop operator @xmath25 gives the knot invariant @xmath26 $ ] for knot @xmath19 embedded in @xmath1 : @xmath27~=~\\langle w_r(c ) \\rangle ~=~ { \\int [ { \\cal d}a_{\\mu } ] w_r(c ) \\exp ( is ) \\over \\int [ { \\cal d}a_{\\mu } ] \\exp ( is ) } ~. \\label { 2five}\\ ] ] here @xmath28 denotes the chern - simons field theory action : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a one form valued in the lie algebra of @xmath0 gauge group and @xmath15 is the coupling constant which takes integer values .",
    "besides the wilson loop associated with a single curve @xmath19 ( knot ) , we could consider product of wilson loops for a link @xmath31 made up of component knots @xmath32 carrying representation @xmath33 as observables .",
    "the invariant for such a multi - component link is given by @xmath34~=~ \\langle w_{r_1 , r_2 , \\ldots , r_s } ( l ) \\rangle ~=~ { \\int [ { \\cal d}a_{\\mu } ] \\prod_i w_{r_i}(c_i ) \\exp ( is)~\\over \\int [ { \\cal d}a_{\\mu } ] \\exp ( is ) } . \\label { 2six}\\ ] ] for @xmath35 s chosen to be defining representation of @xmath0 , the invariant gives two - variable homfly polynomial @xcite ( upto unknot normalisation ) which reduces to the celebrated jones polynomials for @xmath36 gauge group .",
    "we will present the essential ingredients for directly evaluating these knot and link invariants in the next section .",
    "the observables in the topological string theory on a deformed confiold , are constructed using the following basic idea @xcite : define a lagrangian submanifold ( a 3-cycle on which the symplectic form vanishes ) corresponding to a given knot @xmath19 in @xmath1 such that @xmath19 represents the intersection of the 3-cycle with @xmath1 .",
    "wrapping @xmath37 d - branes on the 3-cycle now gives a chern - simons theory on the 3-cycle in addition to the @xmath0 chern - simons theory on @xmath1 , and quantizing the action for the complex scalar field on @xmath19 gives rise to the effective operator @xmath38 \\label { oper}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the holonomies transforming under @xmath0 and @xmath41 groups respectively and the trace is over the defining representation .",
    "clearly , these operators involve traces of powers of holonomy besides the wilson loops and products of wilson loops which has not been considered within chern - simons field theoretic framework .",
    "we will see later in this section that the vev of these new operators can be related to chern - simons invariants for knots carrying arbitrary @xmath0 representation .",
    "the form of the vev of @xmath42 was conjectured by invoking duality of this theory with closed topological string theory on the resolved conifold .",
    "this was done using a method analogous to the schwinger computation of the free energy of a particle in a background field .",
    "it is known @xcite that in type iia compactification on calabi - yau , the topological string amplitudes at genus @xmath4 compute corrections to the low energy theory of the form @xmath43 ( with @xmath44 and @xmath45 being the self dual field strengths of the curvature and the graviphoton respectively ) .",
    "these can be computed via a one - loop calculation where the relevant d - brane states , that are d-2 branes wrapped on cycles bound to d-0 branes , are integrated out .",
    "the lagrangian submanifold on which d - branes are wrapped in the chern - simons calculation is identified on the resolved conifold geometry , and the schwinger computation is done with @xmath37 d-4 branes wrapping the lagrangian 3-cycle and extending along an @xmath46 in non - compact space time , on which the d-2 branes might end .",
    "the @xmath47 gauge field on the non - compact @xmath46 gives rise to a magnetic two form field on the d-4 brane , and each d - brane state that enters in the ( two dimensional ) schwinger calculation is characterised by its magnetic charge @xmath21 ( with @xmath21 transforming in some representation of the @xmath48 gauge theory on the d-4 brane ) , bulk d-2 brane charge @xmath49 and spin @xmath50 . denoting the number of such states by @xmath51 , the closed topological string amplitude is @xcite @xmath52 where is the variable @xmath13 defined in @xcite and equal to @xmath53 of @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath54 $ ] ; @xmath55 .    in order to obtain the above conjectured form ( [ lmeq ] ) from chern - simons theory , we need to device methods of computing vevs of trace of powers of holonomy .",
    "an elegant group theoretic approach @xcite proves useful in arriving at the form ( [ lmeq ] ) and also obtaining the new polynomial invariant @xmath56 in terms of invariants of knots carrying arbitrary @xmath0 representation in chern - simons theory .",
    "we will see in section 4 that these @xmath56 for a wide class of knots indeed obey eqn .",
    "( [ lmaeq ] ) .",
    "the basic idea involved in the group theoretic method is to use the frobenius formula ( see , for eg .",

    "( [ lmeq ] ) in terms of the class functions , the following equality can be obtained @xcite : @xmath71 where @xmath72 means `` @xmath73 divides @xmath74 '' and @xmath75 .",
