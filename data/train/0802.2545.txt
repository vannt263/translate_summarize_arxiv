    "their h@xmath0rotation curve ( rc ) extends to @xmath25 , which barely reaches the maximum velocity .",
    "ten years later , deep vla observations ( 13.5 hours in c / d configuration ) allowed one to derive the rotation curve twice as far , out to @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "a remarkable result of those observations was that , contrary to most spirals , the rotation curve is not flat in the outer parts but appears to be declining ( @xmath27 kms@xmath28or 25% of @xmath29 between the maximum velocity and the last point of the rc ) , even after a careful modeling ( tilted  ring model ) of the warp ( @xmath30@xmath18@xmath31 ) in the outer disk . while the rc is declining in the outer parts , it is less steep than a pure keplerian decline and a dark halo is still needed to properly model the mass distribution",
    ".    it would be interesting to be able to check the uniqueness of this rc with independent observations using another tracer than .",
    "as we have seen , previous h@xmath0observations @xcite only extend to @xmath25 or 80% of the optical radius @xmath32 .",
    "however , deep h@xmath0imaging with a 68    ( fwhm ) filter @xcite showed that the diffuse ionized gas ( dig , also referred to as warm ionized medium , wim ) component in ngc 7793 easily extended out to @xmath32 .",
    "thus , one of the main motivations of the observations presented in this paper was the hope to extend the h@xmath0kinematics , at least out to that point , in order to confirm ( or not ) the decline of the rc .",
    "the other motivation was to try to detect that dig component out to very low levels , if possible at radii larger than @xmath32 .",
    "large dig components have been seen in nearby starburst and active galaxies @xcite and can sometimes have sizes comparable to the component ( see e.g. ngc 1068 ) , but not much is known on the extent of the dig component of quiet late  type systems .",
    "comprehensive studies of the large scale structure of dig components have been done on edge  on systems @xcite , on selected small regions of m31 @xcite , and on large samples @xcite .",
    "massive stars clearly provide the largest source of lyman continuum ( lyc ) photons in spiral galaxies ; an issue concerns whether the bulk of these photons are deposited over localized regions , such as the strmgren spheres which define regions , or whether a significant fraction can escape from the regions of recent star formation where they were created and thus ionize the interstellar medium over much larger scales @xcite .",
    "the large scale radial distribution of the dig across galactic disks can provide stringent constraints on the source of its ionization .",
    "for example , if the number of lyc photons produced in star  forming regions were the only factor responsible for producing the dig , then the ionized gas distribution should follow very closely , both on small and large scales , the distribution of discrete regions .",
    "this addresses the possible internal sources of ionization .    however ,",
    "if ionized gas is detected past the truncation edge @xcite , one possible explanation for that truncation could be that , at large radii , the thin disks get fully ionized by the metagalactic uv background , as discussed by @xcite .",
    "this is another incentive to try to push the detection of the diffuse h@xmath0as far out as possible .",
    "if h@xmath0could be detected that far , it could even be used to put a limit on that uv background .",
    "section ii will present the new fabry - perot h@xmath0observations and discuss data reduction while section iii will derive the kinematical parameters and the rotation curves .",
    "this will be followed in section iv by a study of the mass distribution and section v will discuss the extent of the dig . finally , the principal results will be discussed in section vi and a summary and the main conclusions will be given in section vii .",
    "the fabry - perot ( fp ) observations were obtained on the marseille 36 cm ( from 2005 october 27 to 2005 november 2 ) and on the eso 3.6 m ( 2005 november 3 ) telescopes at la silla , chile , using the photon counting camera ` fantomm `  @xcite .",
    "the same focal reducer , interference filter , fabry - perot etalon and camera were used on both telescopes .",
    "the interference filter , with a peak transmission @xmath33 80% , was centered at @xmath34  and had a fwhm of 30.4 .",
    "the interference order of the fabry - perot interferometer was p = 765 at h@xmath0for a free spectral range ( fsr ) of 8.6  or @xmath35390 kms@xmath28 .",
    "the mean _ finesse _ of the etalon was @xmath36 ( resolution @xmath37 ) .",
    "the finesse is a dimensionless value expressing the spectral resolution of the etalon ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "the fsr was scanned in 60 channels by steps of 0.14 . the photon counting camera ` fantomm`is based on a hamamatsu photocathode coupled with a dalsa commercial ccd .",
    "the photocathode has a quantum efficiency of @xmath3523% at h@xmath0and the ccd has 1024x1024 12.5@xmath39 m square pixels .",
    "the ccd was operated in its low spatial resolution where pixels are binned 2x2 at 40 frames per second .    a photon counting camera , such as ` fantomm ` , is an essential tool for this kind of work .",
    "its ability to rapidly scan the fp interferometer allows the photometric variations to be averaged out . for comparison , in ccd observations ,",
    "each fp channel must be observed for at least 5 continuous minutes to avoid the read - out noise of the ccd from masking the weak galaxy s signal .",
    "this means that photometric conditions must not significantly change for @xmath355 hours with ccd observations . in photon",
    "counting , channels are observed for 5 to 15 seconds and a complete cycle is obtained every 5 to 15 minutes .",
    "many cycles are made during an observation and since the data are analyzed on  line , snr estimations can be made throughout the observations and the observer can decide when to stop the integration .",
    "the wavelength calibration is done using a ne lamp at 6598.95 .",
    "since the calibration lamp is strong compared to galaxies fluxes , calibrations are done in analogic mode ( non photon counting ) . typically , calibration channels are integrated 1 second each , such that a whole calibration only takes 1 minute .",
    "the galaxy was observed for a total of 100 minutes on the 3.60 m ( 1.67 minutes / channel ) and for 1200 minutes ( 20 minutes / channel ) over 4 nights on the 36 cm telescope .",
    "raw observational data consist of many data files that contain photons positions for every cycle / channel duo . with a cycling of 10 seconds integration time per channel ,",
    "one file was created every 10 seconds .",
    "the different steps of the data reduction are :    * integration of raw data files into an interferogram data cube ( 3d data cube sliced for every fabry - perot channel ) ; * phase correction of interferograms to create wavelength - sorted data cubes ( 3d data cube sliced for every wavelength interval ) ; * hanning spectral smoothing ; * sky emission removal ; * spatial binning / smoothing ( e.g. adaptive binning ) ; * radial velocity map extraction from emission line positions ; * addition of astrometry information ; * kinematical information extraction .",
    "all the reduction was performed with idl routines inspired of the adhocw reduction package ( http://www.oamp.fr/adhoc/adhoc/adhocw.htm ) .",
    "details on the data reduction can be found in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite and the routines are available at http://www.astro.umontreal.ca/@xmath35odaigle/reduction .",
    "especially , the way the profiles are found , the way the sky emission is subtracted , which is a crucial step when trying to detect very weak emission , the way the data is smoothed using an adaptive smoothing technique are all described in details in @xcite .    mimage . * middle left * : h@xmath0monochromatic image . *",

    "* bottom * : pv diagram . ]    a first attempt at detecting the dig in the outer disk of ngc 7793 was done in october 1993 , during 13 observing nights , for a cumulative total exposure time of 64 hours .",
    "the same instrumentation was used ( 36 cm telescope , focal reducer , interference filter and interferometer ) , but the detector was different .",
    "this first data set was obtained with our old ipcs , a thompson camera based on a silicium nocticon tv tube technology @xcite .",
    "however , the camera used to obtain the data set presented in this paper used a new gaas tube technology @xcite and has a detective quantum efficiency @xmath3525% , at least four times larger than the old thompson ipcs . thus , this second run was less time consuming ( 20 hours instead of 64 ) for reaching a higher snr .",
    "moreover , the shortening of the individual elementary exposure time together with the diminution of the total observing time and better reduction software @xcite allowed a better removal of the night sky lines which is critical at such a low signal level .",
    "in order to derive the rotation curves , one must find the set of orientation parameters ( rotation center ( @xmath40 ) , systemic velocity @xmath41 , inclination @xmath16 , position angle of the major axis @xmath18 ) that best represents the observed velocity fields , shown in fig .",
    "[ obs3m60 ] and fig .",
    "[ obs36 cm ] , at all radii .",
    "the data in an opening angle of 40  about the minor axis are excluded from the analysis to minimize errors due to deprojection effects .",
    "a cosine weighting function ( using the angle @xmath42 from the major axis ) is used for the rest of the data , which gives maximum weighting on the major axis . the task _ rotcur _ in the reduction package _ gipsy _",
    "@xcite is used to find those parameters .",
    "since they are correlated , the dynamical center and the systemic velocity are looked for first , by keeping @xmath16 and @xmath18  fixed ( using the photometric values given in table  [ opt_par ] ) .",
    "we find that ( @xmath40 ) corresponds to the optical center and that @xmath41 = 238 @xmath43 kms@xmath28for the 3.60 m and 230 @xmath44 kms@xmath28for the 36 cm data .",
    "this can be compared to the @xcite global profile midpoint velocity of 230 @xmath45 kms@xmath28and intensity - weighted mean velocity of 235 @xmath44 kms@xmath28or to their systemic velocity derived in the same way from the velocity field of 227 @xmath43 kms@xmath28 .",
    "the agreement is very good considering that a slight zero point shift can be expected since the calibration is done at the ne wavelength and not at the observed wavelength .",
    "the next step is to obtain a least  squares solution for @xmath16 , @xmath18and @xmath46 in concentric annuli in the plane of the galaxy , by keeping ( @xmath40 ) and @xmath41 fixed .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ kp ] . for both data sets ,",
    "an inclination @xmath16 = 47@xmath47  for the 3.6 m and @xmath48  for the 36 cm is adopted .",
    "for the @xmath18  we found 277  @xmath43  for the 3.60 m and 286  @xmath44  for the 36 cm .",
    "this is consistent with the data @xcite which show that the @xmath18  is smaller in the inner parts than in the outer parts . in order to see",
    "if the solution found is a good representation of the whole galaxy , separate solutions are also obtained for the approaching and the receding sides . the 3 solutions ( both sides , approaching , receding ) and the adopted rotation curves are given in fig .",
    "[ vrot3m60 ] for the 3.60 m and in fig .",
    "[ vrot36 cm ] for the 36 cm data .",
    "the adopted errors are the biggest difference between the kinematical solution for both sides and the separate solutions for either the approaching or the receding sides or the intrinsic error from the tilted - ring model , if larger .",
    "the values of the rcs are tabulated in table  [ rc3m60 ] and table  [ rc36 cm ] , respectively .",
    "for the 3.60 m data of fig .",
    "[ vrot3m60 ] , only the velocity points up to 132  will be used because further out there are not enough points on the receding side and the errors become too large .",
    "similarly , for the 36 cm data in fig .",
    "[ vrot36 cm ] , even if the h@xmath0emission is detected out to @xmath358.5  ( @xmath49 ) , only the data up to 7  will be used because there is no emission after that radius on the receding side .",
    ".h@xmath0rc from the 3.60 m data.[rc3m60 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ vrotfinal ] , the h@xmath0rc is very similar to the rc ( errors on the 3.60 m data were not plotted to facilitate the comparison ; see fig .  [ vrot3m60 ] ) so that the mass models are expected to be very similar .",
    "however , since the velocities are slightly lower in the very inner parts and slightly higher in the intermediate parts , one could expect slight differences .    in order to compare our results with those obtained using the rc @xcite , the same approach for the study of the mass distribution will be used .",
    "the dark halo is represented by an isothermal sphere which can be described by two free parameters : the one - dimensional velocity dispersion @xmath50 and the core radius @xmath51 .",
    "the central density is then given by @xmath52 .",
    "the other free parameter is the mass  to  light ratio ( @xmath53)@xmath54 of the stellar disk .",
    "details on the method used can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the parameters of the models and the main results are given in table  [ res_massmod ] and illustrated in fig .",
    "[ plt_massmod ] .",
    "as expected , the slightly higher h@xmath0velocity @xmath351 kpc gives a higher ( /l@xmath55)@xmath56for the stellar disk , thus reducing the dark component and the slightly lower h@xmath0velocities @xmath355 kpc also gives a lower density dark component .",
    "those two factors , combined with the fact that the rc extends slightly further out , explain the fact that the @xmath57 goes down from 0.97 to 0.75 at the last point .",
    "nevertheless , within the uncertainties , one can say that the h@xmath0data confirms the results obtained with the data with @xmath58 at the last velocity point for a total mass for ngc 7793 of @xmath59 .",
    "again , one can see that even if the rc is declining over the second half of the radius range , a dark halo is still needed to reproduce the observed kinematics .",

    "the first mention that ngc 7793 had an extended ionized component was by @xcite from quite shallow photographic data .",
    "a deeper and more detailed study was done more recently by @xcite .",
    "they showed that the observed h@xmath0luminosity of the dig component of ngc 7793 was large , accounting for @xmath35 40% of the total h@xmath0emission , similar to what is seen in m31 @xcite or the smc @xcite .",
    "@xcite argue that the integrated minimum lyman continuum ( lyc ) power required to sustain the dig is enormous and can only easily be met by the ionizing output from massive star formation ; the mechanical energy from supernovae and stellar winds falls short of that required by at least a factor of 2 .",
    "their results support the hypothesis that the dig is photoionized by lyc photons leaking out of discrete regions .",
    "a comparison between our deep fabry - perot h@xmath0map and the deep h@xmath0continuum subtracted image from ferguson et al . shows a very good general agreement .",
    "nevertheless , we reach fainter diffuse h@xmath0emission in the outskirts of the galaxy located between regions . in addition , spurs are visible on our image that were not detected by @xcite . fig .",
    "[ plt_haprof ] shows the h@xmath0radial profile of ngc 7793 , derived using the _ gipsy _ task _ ellint _ @xcite .",
    "since our data were not photometrically calibrated , our profile was adjusted in order to be in rough agreement with the profile of @xcite in the outer parts .",
    "this should be looked at as just an order of magnitude representation since the @xcite data were obtained in imagery with a 68  filter which included not only h@xmath0but also the [ ] lines .",
    "while they corrected for the [ ] contamination using [ ] /h@xmath0= 0.22 , @xcite found a ratio close to unity in the outer parts of the other sculptor group galaxy ngc 253 .",
    "so , even if the intensity scale could be off by a factor of a few , this is sufficient to show that our long fabry - perot observations ( 20 hours total or 20 minutes per channel ) on a 36 cm telescope nearly reach the limit of the disk ( @xmath74 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to be able to reach so large radii is interesting since it was estimated that if the truncation edge @xcite of the disks is due to ionization of the hydrogen by the cosmic background radiation , the expected flux @xcite should be an h@xmath0emission measure @xmath75(h@xmath0 ) @xmath76 pc @xmath77 , which is the level reached by our deep observations",
    "contrary to what was found by @xcite ( hereafter referred to as bfq1997 ) for ngc 253 , the h@xmath0disk of ngc 7793 does not extend past the emission even if it gets close to it .",
    "indeed , bfq1997 have detected ionized gas out to 1.4 @xmath32 , while the extends only out to 1.2 @xmath32 .",
    "we should nevertheless notice that these authors did not give an h@xmath0map of ngc 253 but only presented some discrete h@xmath0emission located at a single position . using fabry - perot techniques as well , they computed a radial velocity for this emission region and since they used a fixed etalon , instead of a scanning one as we did , they do not have full spatial coverage of the galaxy .",
    "moreover , they have only observed one side of the galaxy .",
    "further observations of ngc 253 are needed to verify if the outer region detected by bfq1997 is isolated or if it is a fragment of a more extended region .",
    "in addition , it is necessary to search for a counterpart of this region on the other side of the galaxy to strengthen their conclusions .",
    "the outer regions of galaxies are expected to deliver important clues on the way galaxies are assembled .",
    "it is into these regions that material was accreted during violent interactions in the past and where new material continues to fall today .",
    "cosmological simulations of disk galaxy formation predict a wealth of baryonic structures and substructures up to ultra - faint surface brightness levels , possibly due for instance to tidal debris from accretion and disruption of an expected rich population of luminous satellites @xcite .",
    "the faintest features visible in m31 reach effective v - band surface brightnesses greater than @xmath78 mag  arcsec@xmath79 .",
    "the currently most powerful technique to probe the very low surface brightness regions is resolved star counts , but it is only applicable to our nearest large neighbors , such as m31 and m33 .",
    "both galaxies appear to show evidence for metal - poor , pressure - supported stellar halos but only m31 shows evidence for recent accretion @xcite .",
    "the combination of diffuse light surface photometry with resolved star counts allowed @xcite to reach an effective v - band surface brightness of @xmath80 mag  arcsec@xmath79 for m31 .",
    "globular cluster and planetary nebula populations also offer additional clues to the formation and evolution at large radii .",
    "the presence of the neutral gas component , detected through its emission , at radii several times larger than the optical disk ( measured from its surface brightness at @xmath81 mag  arcsec@xmath79 ) has now been well known for more than 30 years .",
    "many of the extended rotation curves are rising or flat at their outermost points , while others are slightly decreasing .",
    "nevertheless , none of them show a keplerian decline , meaning that the edge of the mass distribution has not yet been found @xcite .",
    "the only suggestion that such an edge could have been reached is for the dwarf galaxy ddo 154 @xcite .",
    "deep observations have shown that disks are abruptly truncated at column densities near @xmath82 atoms cm@xmath79 , where the rotation curves still do not have a keplerian behavior ( e.g. van gorkom 1993 ) .",
    "if the metagalactic uv background is sufficiently strong , beyond a certain galactic radius the cold gas may become ionized @xcite    the total h@xmath0emission from star forming galaxies is divided roughly in half , between discrete regions and the dig .",
    "pioneering work by @xcite established that only the massive ob stars are able to ionize the dig . on the other hand ,",
    "all the observers agree on the fact that the dig fraction seems to be independent of galaxy parameters such as star formation rate and hubble type .",
    "this looks a bit controversial .",
    "more recently , @xcite and @xcite suspected that ob stars can not exclusively explain the ionization state of the dig .",
    "@xcite suggested that part of the dig may consist of extremely evolved filamentary regions that may be difficult to detect .    on the other hand ,",
    "if ionizing radiation escapes from regions to ionize the dig , it does escape from the galaxies and affects the ionization state of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) and the galactic medium of external galaxies which may be partially at the origin of this uv radiation .",
    "indeed , a key question is the origin of the ultra - violet photons responsible for ionizing the hydrogen in the intergalactic medium ( the ly@xmath0 forest ) .",
    "the most likely sources of ionizing photons are young hot stars in galaxies and qsos @xcite but their exact origin remains one of the unsolved questions of modern cosmology .",
    "observations of high - redshift quasars imply that the reionization of cosmic hydrogen was completed by z@xmath356 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and reference therein ) .",
    "lack of observational evidence and theoretical uncertainties makes it difficult to estimate the contribution made by both sources and leads to inconsistent results . to complicate the scheme ,",
    "the relative contribution of qsos and star forming galaxies depends on the lookback time ( * ? ? ? * and reference therein ) .",
    "recently , based on the first data release of the singg survey of hi - selected galaxies @xcite , @xcite have undertaken a quantification of the ionization in neutral galaxies and the diffuse and warm ionized medium ( ngc 7793 is unfortunately not included in the first singg data release of 109 galaxies ) .",
    "they concluded that the mean fraction of diffuse ionized gas in their sample is @xmath350.59 , slightly higher but consistent with the value @xmath350.40 found in previous samples ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and also consistent with the value @xmath350.50 found by @xcite for ngc 7793 .",
    "the difference between @xcite and previous studies may be due to selection effects favoring large , optically bright and nearby galaxies with high star formation rates .",
    "ngc 7793 is closer than any ( except one ) of the first singg data release .",
    "we have computed , for ngc 7793 , its h@xmath0effective ( half light ) radius @xmath84 kpc ( @xmath85 arcsec ) . refering to equation ( 1 ) from @xcite , and using the h@xmath0total luminosity of @xmath86 erg.s@xmath28 computed by @xcite",
    ", we found that the logarithm of effective surface brightness log(@xmath87 ) = 38.65 log(erg  s@xmath28  kpc@xmath79 .",
    "following @xcite , this brings ngc 7793 to be classified as a normal galaxy with respect to its star formation rate .",
    "several mechanisms for the ionization of the neutral hydrogen and for heating the electron population belonging to the dig may be found in the literature .",
    "bfq1997 review them in the specific context of ngg 253 .",
    "the main source of ionization and heating may be ( see references in bfq1997 ) : the metagalactic ionizing background ; compact halo sources ; compact disk sources ( white dwarf populations or horizontal - branch stars , young enough to produce significant uv emission ) ; ram pressure heating ( ngc 253 and ngc 7793 lie both in the sculptor group having little intracluster medium ) ; turbulence - driven mhd - wave heating ; mixing layers driven by bulk flows ; galactic fountain material driven by the inner starburst through shocks ; dilute photoionization ; gas phase depletion ( induced by the formation of grains ) ; low energy cosmic - ray electrons and young stellar disk .",
    "bfq1997 ruled out most of these mechanisms , except the ionization by the hot young stars of the disk .",
    "even if those young stars are in the disk and most of them further in , the warp of the disk ( which is the case for both ngc 253 and ngc 7793 ) makes it possible to expose it to their radiation .",
    "in particular , they ruled out the ionization by the cosmic uv background which is suspected to be @xmath355 times below the ionizing flux necessary to explain the emission seen in ngc 253 .",
    "as the h@xmath0disk does not reach the outskirts of the disk of ngc 7793 , it is very unlikely that the source of ionization of the dig is the metagalactic uv background .",
    "indeed , if the metagalactic uv background was at the origin of the ionization it should have principally affected the outer regions , which is not the case .",
    "an alternative could be that the h@xmath0detection level is not yet low enough to be able to detect the ionization by the cosmic uv background radiation , thus , this should mean that the expected flux should have an h@xmath0emission measure @xmath75(h@xmath0 ) lower than what was measured for ngc 7793 , namely @xmath88 pc @xmath77 .",
    "the existence of falling rcs was first claimed in the context of the effect of cluster environments on the member galaxies .",
    "following the work of @xcite , the increase of intergalactic gas and of gravitational interactions expected toward the centers of clusters should not only affect the morphological types of the systems but also their kinematics and mass distribution .",
    "@xcite , from long - slit emission - line observations , presented evidence for a correlation in the sense that the inner - cluster spirals tend to have falling rcs , while those of the outer cluster and the vast majority of field spirals seem to have flat or even rising rcs .",
    "however , @xcite , using full 3-d fabry - perot data did not confirm these correlations and moreover found that many galaxies for which @xcite claimed a falling rc , had in fact a flat or even rising rc after a careful analysis of the fabry - perot 2d velocity fields @xcite .",
    "declining rcs have been seen before in other systems @xcite . however , those galaxies are most of the time earlier type systems ( s0 - sbc ) with highly - concentrated stellar light distribution and the maximum rotation velocity is reached at small radii ( few hundreds kpc and @xmath89 ) .",
    "this is certainly not the case for ngc 7793 which has a very small bulge and a relatively diffuse ( exponential ) light distribution and where @xmath29 is reached at @xmath90 .",
    "keplerian declines have also been observed in a few edge - on systems ( e.g. ngc 891 : @xcite , ngc 3079 : @xcite & ngc 4244 : @xcite ) , but the interpretation in the case of those galaxies is much more difficult .",
    "finally , a truncation of the halo at @xmath91 kpc was advocated to explain the decline of the last two points of the rcs of ngc 5204 @xcite and ngc 253 @xcite , but here the decrease of @xmath29 and the last velocity point is only @xmath92% of @xmath29 and @xmath92% of @xmath93 , while , for ngc 7793 , the decrease is @xmath94% of @xmath29 and over about half the radius range .",
    "so , for late - type nearly bulgeless galaxies , the decreasing rc of ngc 7793 is rather unique . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ vrotfinal ] , the decline of the rc seen with the data is confirmed by the h@xmath036 cm data and the kinematical analysis of the 3 sets of data ( & h@xmath0 ) give very similar results . since a bulge component can not be invoked to explain the falling gradient of the rc , ngc 7793 really seems to have a genuine declining rc .",
    "the new data also confirm that the decline is slower than keplerian and that a dark component is still necessary to explain the observed kinematics .",
    "deep h@xmath0observations of ngc 7793 have been presented .",
    "the main results are :    * a total of 20 hours of observations was obtained on the marseille 36 cm telescope which allowed to reach sensitivities of the order of @xmath75(h@xmath0 ) @xmath76 pc @xmath77 ; * this allowed the detection of diffuse h@xmath0emission out to the edge of the disk ; * a warp of the disk plane , already seen in the data is also seen in the disk ; * a rc is derived out to 2.2  from the 3.6 m data and out to 7  from the 36 cm data ; * the two h@xmath0rcs superposed exactly with the rc ; * the h@xmath0results confirm the findings that ngc 7793 has a truly declining rotation curve ; * a model of the mass distribution gives a total mass for ngc 7793 of @xmath69 = @xmath95 @xmath7for @xmath57 = 0.75 - 1.0 at the last velocity point .",
    "this was our first experiment of doing such long integrations using a 36 cm telescope coupled with our ` fantomm `  scanning fabry - perot system .",
    "this yielded very interesting results for ngc 7793 by detecting diffuse h@xmath0emission all the way to the edge of the disk and confirming its peculiar kinematics . in the near future",
    ", we intend to carry out the same kind of observations for all the sculptor group galaxies , hoping to reach even fainter levels",
    ". this should be possible with an even more sensitive camera soon available @xcite , based on an emccd , which should allow us to increase the detective quantum efficiency by a factor @xmath35 3 - 4 .",
    "we would like to thank the staff of the eso la silla observatory for their support .",
    "we acknowledge support from the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada and the fonds qubcois de la recherche sur la nature et les technologies .",

    "government grant nag w-2166 .",

    "the plates were processed into the present compressed digital form with the permission of these institutions .",
