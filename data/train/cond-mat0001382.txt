    "during the last years the combination of laser cooling @xcite and evaporative cooling methods @xcite has lead to the achievement of one of the most pursued goals since the early days of quantum physics , i.e. the so  called bose ",
    "einstein condensation ( bec ) .",
    "such condensation is a direct consequence of the bose ",
    "einstein statistics , and consists in the fact that the ground state of the system becomes macroscopically populated .",
    "although bec has been obtained using the combination of laser and collisional techniques , there are several experimental groups @xcite which currently investigate the possibility of obtaining bec using all  optical means only .",
    "in such a case the number of atoms in the trap would not decrease during the cooling process , and a non  destructive detection of bec could be performed by simply measuring the fluorescence photons .",
    "in addition , laser induced condensation would be easier to control externally , and could lead to richer effects than collisional processes , as those employed in evaporative and sympathetic cooling .",
    "finally , the methods employed to achieve laser induced condensation can be used to design the techniques of pumping the atoms into the condensate using spontaneous emission @xcite .    the most sophisticated laser cooling techniques ( as velocity selective coherent population trapping @xcite or raman cooling @xcite ) are capable to cool atomic samples below the photon ",
    "recoil energy , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the laser wavevector , and @xmath2 is the atomic mass .",
    "such methods should in principle lead to bec .",
    "however , in using laser cooling to obtain the bec , the reabsorption of spontaneously emitted photons turns to be a very important problem .",
    "this is because the sub - recoil laser cooling techniques are based on dark  state mechanisms @xcite , and the dark  states are unfortunately not dark respect to the spontaneously emitted photons .",
    "therefore , multiple reabsorptions can increase the system energy by several recoil energies per atom @xcite .",
    "it is easy to understand that assuming that the reabsorption cross section for trapped atoms is the same as in free space , i.e. @xmath3 , the significance of reabsorptions increases with the dimensionality @xcite , in such a way that the reabsorptions should not cause any problem in one dimension . for the case of three ",
    "dimensional traps several remedies have also been proposed @xcite . in the following we are going to assume that our system is one  dimensional .",
    "this assumption in the first place has been done for simplicity reasons , but at the same time it allows us to avoid the reabsorbtions problem . as we discuss in the conclusion section ,",
    "however , our approach can be used in three ",
    "dimensional asymmetric traps , for which heating due to reabsorbtions can also be negligible .    when laser  cooling methods are employed , the thermalization of the system occurs with the interaction with the laser field and the vacuum modes of the electromagnetic field , and therefore atom  atom collisions are in principle not necessary . in the following",
    "we shall consider an ideal gas ( see the discussion in sec .   [",
    "sec : model ] ) .",
    "in fact , the proper notion of temperature must then be revised . on the other hand ,",
    "the dynamics of the system becomes more complex , because we have to deal with an open system which interacts with the laser .",
    "@xcite , the quantum dynamics of a laser  cooled ideal gas has been studied using second quantization formalism in order to take into account the quantum  statistical character of the bosons , and also employing quantum stochastical methods @xcite to take into account the coupling with the reservoir provided by the vacuum modes of the electromagnetic field . the equations which describe the dynamics of the system",
    "have been obtained , and so has the stationary solution , which corresponds for the case of a bosonic system with the well  known bose ",
    "einstein distribution ( bed ) , and under proper conditions the bec appears .    in order to characterize this laser  induced bec , the two  time correlations of the condensate amplitude turn to be very important quantities , because they describe the diffusion of the phase of the condensate .",
    "these correlations are very difficult to calculate both analytically and numerically , and until now no calculation of such correlations has been published , as far as we know .",
    "the main aim of the present paper is to present a method to calculate such correlations using quasi ",
    "probability representations , and in particular @xmath4representation @xcite .",
    "we shall also present a numerical calculation based on the so  called wave  function monte carlo method @xcite , whose results are in good agreement with the predicted analytical ones .    at this point",
    "it is worth noticing that the model considered in this paper is not very realistic since it is one dimensional , and even in the relevant single dimension it assumes the , so called , lamb - dicke limit , when the size of the trap @xmath5 is smaller than the wavelength of the laser field , @xmath6 . at the same time the model neglects not only elastic collisions , but also all non - elastic losses : two and three  body non - elastic collisions , as well as photoassociation losses .",
    "realization of such situation requires modification of atomic scattering length ( as discussed in section ii and conclusions)and other precautions , which are possible ( as discussed in section ii and in more detail in conclusions ) , but not easy to achieve experimentally . in the worst case ,",
    "however , the model is realistic for small samples of @xmath7 atoms . cooling of such small sample of atoms to a ground state of the trap is of fundamental interest itself , and might be even useful for applications for quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "we stress , however , that the main achievement of this paper concerns _ methodological aspects_. even though the model is somewhat unrealistic , it is a paradigm model describing quantum dynamics of the bosonic gas approaching the equilibrium .",
    "as we mentioned , time correlations are very difficult to calculate analytically and numerically in any model of that sort , regardless how realistic it is .",
    "we develop here the methods to calculate such correlations , and these methods are of quite importance themselves , since they are quite universal and can be carried over to more realistic models , such as those discussed by us in a series of refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we briefly review the calculations already presented in ref .",

    "[ sec : conclusions ] stressing once more methodological achievements of this paper , and discussing experimental feasibility of our model .",
    "in this section we briefly review the formalism already developed in ref .",
    "we consider a system composed of n two  level identical bosons in an harmonic trap centered at @xmath8 , which are coherently driven by a standing wave laser field , and also interact with the vacuum modes of the electromagnetic field . in the following we use , for simplicity ,",
    "units with @xmath9 , and velocity of light @xmath10 . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we consider four basic approximations : ( i ) the laser is quasi ",
    "resonant with a particular transition between two electronic states @xmath11 ( ground state ) and @xmath12 ( excited state ) , and therefore we consider atoms as two ",
    "level atoms ; ( ii ) rotating  wave approximation ( rwa ) can be used , since the frequency of the considered electronic transition ( @xmath13 ) and the laser frequency @xmath14 are considered much larger than any other frequency scale of the system ; ( iii ) we treat the atom  field interactions in the dipole approximation since the resonant wavelength @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the typical atomic size ; ( iv ) we neglect the atom  atom collisions , i.e. we work in the ideal  gas approximation . in principle",
    ", the latter approximation implies that we should deal with a small number of particles ( @xmath17 ) , because we are going to consider that the trap is in the so  called lamb  dicke limit ( ldl ) , where the , so called , lamb  dicke parameter @xmath18 , with @xmath5 being the size of the trap ground state .",
    "however , the @xmath19wave scattering length @xmath20 ( which governs the atom  atom interactions at low energies ) can be externally modified , for instance , using a magnetic field @xcite , or a laser field@xcite , and in principle @xmath20 can be made very close to zero @xcite , allowing the strict validity of the ideal gas approximation .",
    "we limit our discussion to the one  dimensional case .",
    "the relevant electronic states are then determined by the laser polarization perpendicular to the laser wave vector , which in turn can be aligned in the @xmath21direction , @xmath22 .",
    "we assume that the atoms can only move in the @xmath21direction , and are localized in transverse direction , so that practically one can assume that they are located at @xmath23 .",
    "the atoms are assumed to occupy the energy eigenstates of the harmonic trap potential .",
    "we denote this energy levels by @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) for the atoms in the ground ( excited ) electronic state , occupying the level @xmath26(@xmath2)@xmath27 of the harmonic trap .",
    "we introduce also the operators @xmath28 , @xmath29 ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) that annihilate or create atoms in the @xmath26th ( @xmath2th ) energy level of the ground  state ( excited  state ) potential .",

    "( [ me1 ] ) takes the form : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the natural line - width of the considered transition .",
    "if we locate the trap at the node of the laser standing wave , the excitation provided by the laser then become weak , provided that @xmath43 is moderate .",
    "we expect then that at a given instant no more than one atom will be excited .",
    "the system is then characterized by two distinct time scales : the fast one , determined by @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 ; and the slow one , characterized by @xmath49 , which describes the jumps between the various ground  state levels .",
    "in such a case one can use standard adiabatic elimination techniques @xcite to remove excited state populations . physically",

    ", we applied a stochastic wave function method , which replaces the deterministic evolution of the density matrix ( following eq.([me2 ] ) ) by a stochastic evolution of an ensemble of state vectors @xcite .    a naive application of this algorithm to simulate ( [ me2 ] ) would lead to a stochastic jump process in which the operators @xmath96 and @xmath97 act as jump operators .",
    "this process would represent the density matrix as an ensemble of simultaneous eigenvectors of all occupation number operators @xmath98 , causing large fluctuations of the phase which we are interested in .",

    "the function @xmath106 was estimated by averaging over 1500 trajectories .",
    "figure ( [ plots ] ) shows the results of the numerical simulation , compared to the analytic formula ( [ g1_4 ] ) , for different values of @xmath64 .",

    "as expected , the agreement is much better for low temperatures than for high temperatures , where the numerical simulation indicates a faster decay of @xmath106 than that predicted by the low - temperature approximation ( [ g1_4 ] ) .",
    "in this paper we have studied quantum dynamics of a bose gas in a trap undergoing sideband laser cooling in the lamb - dicke limit .",
    "the master equation describing the dynamics of the system can be regarded as a paradigm equation for collective cooling dynamics .",
    "one of the difficult problems associated with such dynamics consists in calculating time dependent correlation functions , such as for instance those that describe temporal phase fluctuations of the bose condensate . in this paper",
    "we have presented a solution to this problem .",
    "our main results should be regarded from the methodological point of view :    * we have formulated an analytic method to describe temporal correlations based on an expansion of the master equation valid at low temperatures , when a large number @xmath110 of particles are in the condensate .",

    "the expansion can be , and already has been applied for other models of the bose gas dynamics , that describe more realistic physical situations ( see refs .",
    "* we have formulated a numerical method to calculate the time correlations which modifies the jump processes involved in the master equation in such a way that the corresponding quantum monte carlo simulations are much more stable and require averaging over much less number of quantum trajectories to achieve good accuracy .",
    "the method proposed is general , and can be applied not only for the present model , but also for more realistic related models . *",
    "analytic and numerical results agree very well even at the border of the validity of the analytic theory ( @xmath112 ) . *",
    "collective laser cooling leads at low temperature to phase diffusion in a mexican hat potential .",
    "this result is also general , and holds for other more realistic models of the collective laser cooling .",
    "the above listed methodological results provide the main value of the present paper .",
    "it is , nevertheless , interesting to speculate whether the consider model is purely academic , or whether it can be realized experimentally .",
    "we shall argue now that it can be realized for small number ( @xmath113 ) of particles .",
    "let us discuss step by step the most relevant approximations used in this paper .",
    "* _ 1 dimension .",
    "_ this approximation was done mainly for technical reasons .",
    "the model can be easily generalized to describe condensation in a three  dimensional trap . in that case ,",
    "additional precautions should be taken into account to avoid the reabsorbtion problem .",
    "in particular , if the width of the excited states is smaller than @xmath114 , we were thus working not only in the ldl limit , but also in the _ festina lente _ regime @xcite . extending the dynamics to three dimensions in an asymmetric trap will in this regime not introduce any kind of dangerous reabsorbtion problems .",
    "in fact , the dynamics will consist of 3 independent dynamics corresponding to the cooling in the @xmath115 , @xmath116 , and @xmath21 direction . * _ absence of elastic collisions_. as we have mentioned , this requires that the atomic density should be sufficiently small , or alternatively that the scattering length should be modified to very low values .",
    "the first possibility is not interesting , because we require also that the ldl conditions are fulfilled , which means that @xmath5 should be of the order of at most @xmath117 m .",
    "the condition to be fulfilled is @xmath118 , with the effective condensate volume @xmath119 . for the parameter considered this gives gives @xmath120 , where @xmath121 is the modification factor of the scattering length . *",
    "_ absence of two body inelastic collisions _ this problem has a simple remedy .",
    "the cooling and condensation should take place in a dipole trap , and occur in the _ electronic ground state _ of the atoms .",
    "two body inelastic processes are then completely suppressed . *",
    "_ absence of three body inelastic processes _ three body losses can be typically neglected provided the density is less than @xmath122/@xmath123 . for @xmath124 m that requires @xmath125 .",
    "if the three body losses are modified in a corresponding way as elastic collisions ( which seems to be the case for @xmath126rb @xcite ) , then the corresponding condition is much less restrictive @xmath127 . *",
    "_ absence of photoassociation losses _ this can be reduced by using red detuned laser tuned in between the molecular resonances @xcite .",
    "even is such a case , photoassociation losses become relevant when the density reaches the limit @xmath122/@xmath123 , i.e. in our case for @xmath125 .",
    "it seems likely , that this estimate can be improved significantly when the laser is tuned below the minimum of the molecular transition . while it can hardly be though of for the direct transition",
    ", we should stress that laser transition considered in this paper can be equally well regarded as a raman transition .",
    "in such case , tuning of the stimulated two - photon transition below the minimum of the molecular resonance is possible .    summarizing , we see that even in the worst case ( no modifications of the scattering length , no special precautions regarding photoassociation losses ) our model should be valid for @xmath128 particles .",
    "additional precautions can allow to extent the validity of the model to significantly larger values of @xmath93 .",

    "in this appendix we present in detail the calculations which allow us to transform eq .",
    "( [ p0dot ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ p0dot2 ] ) .",
    "first , we show that our problem can be reduced to a two  level system formed by the level @xmath134 and @xmath135 of the trap .",
    "then , we adiabatically eliminate the level @xmath135 .",

    "let us analyze in detail the last line in the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ p1dot ] ) , which comes from the contributions of @xmath141 in eq .",
    "( [ pdot ] ) , i.e. the contributions given by the transitions @xmath142 . for a temperature sufficiently below @xmath87 , and sufficiently large n , the atoms in the non  condensed states of the trap form a so  called maxwell  demon ( md ) ensemble @xcite , i.e. an ensemble which exchanges particles with a reservoir provided by the condensate without exchanging the energy .",
    "therefore , the excited states can be considered as : ( i ) independent of the population of the ground state ; ( ii ) decorrelated among each other . due to these properties : @xmath143 where the subindex @xmath144 means that the averages are calculated in the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "it is well known that these averages have the simple form : @xmath145 therefore , the last line in the rhs side of eq .",
    "( [ p1dot ] ) becomes : @xmath146=0.\\ ] ] therefore the contribution of @xmath141 for @xmath147 cancels out .",
    "in general , the contribution of @xmath141 for @xmath148 is not exactly zero , but it is always a constant , following the md arguments .",
    "therefore our system reduces to a two  level system , in which only the levels @xmath134 and @xmath135 must be considered .",
    "having reduced the system into just two levels , @xmath134 and @xmath135 , we shall adiabatically eliminate the level @xmath135 .",
    "this can be achieved because , as observed from eqs .",
    "( [ p1dot ] ) and ( [ p0dot ] ) , @xmath136 decays on a time scale of the order @xmath149 , whereas @xmath72 decays in a time scale of the order @xmath150 .",

    "( [ p1dot ] ) it is clear that the contributions of the order @xmath150 in @xmath147 lead to terms of the order @xmath149 in the stationary value of @xmath136 .",
    "therefore we are interested in @xmath147 up to order @xmath150 , and therefore in @xmath152 up to order @xmath150 .",
    "this means that we need to calculate @xmath153 just up to the order @xmath154 : @xmath155 p_1^{2 }   \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{\\gamma_-}{2 } \\left [ 8 q   n|x_0|^2 \\right ] p_1 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for times @xmath156^{-1}$ ] , the stationary values : @xmath157 is obtained",
    ". therefore eq .  ( [ p1dot ] ) reduces to the form ( up to order @xmath150 ) : @xmath158 p_1 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{\\gamma_-}{2 } \\left [ 2 q   n|x_0|^2 \\right ] p_0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and for @xmath159^{-1}$ ] , @xmath160 p_0.\\ ] ] substituting this value in eq .",
