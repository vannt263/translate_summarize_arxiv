    "in the past two decades the development of fundamental physics has been greatly promoted by the recognition of the holographic principle which emerges in the study of black holes .",
    "this bold principle was originally put forward by t hooft @xcite and susskind @xcite , and first realized concretely by maldacena @xcite in the context of string theory . in this implementation a conjectured equivalence was established between the four - dimensional @xmath0 supersymmetric yang - mills gauge theory and the superstring theory on @xmath1 . although the origin of the connection is still mysterious , this well - known ads / cft correspondence has been applied in many aspects as an efficient tool to perform analytical calculations in strongly coupled systems @xcite .",
    "a canonical application of this correspondence is the analysis of shear viscosity in the strongly coupled sym theory @xcite , in which the hydrodynamics arises as a classical description for the behavior of any interacting quantum field theory at long - wavelength and low - frequency .",
    "then in the framework ads / cft correspondence a connection between gravity in asymptotically ads and relativistic hydrodynamics in one less dimension was revealed @xcite , and this is known as the gravity / fluid correspondence , and the relativistic gravitational field equations were reduced into the incompressible navier - stokes equation in a appropriate scaling limit @xcite .",
    "actually , the gravity / fluid correspondence can be realized independent of ads / cft correspondence , and it s origin could be dated back to the late 1970 s , long before the holographic principle was proposed .",
    "here we refer to the membrane paradigm @xcite , in which the local dynamical quantities of black holes was first studied `` holographically '' , and shown to be governed by the navier - stokes equations . despite the technical differences , the viscosity / entropy ratio from membrane paradigm at horizon and ads / cft at spatial infinity was surprisingly the same , which indicates a correlation between these two approaches @xcite . under such background the gravity / fluid correspondence at arbitrary cutoff",
    "was constructed @xcite . in it s original version this was achieved by considering linearized einstein equations while making hydrodynamic expansion and imposing appropriate boundary conditions . to be specific ,",
    "the scalar and tensor modes of the fluctuations are fixed by the ingoing - wave boundary conditions on the horizon and dirichlet boundary conditions at the cutoff , and the only dynamical modes are the vector fluctuations governed by the linearized navier - stokes equations . shortly afterwards in @xcite",
    "the analysis was improved to the nonlinear case , more importantly the hydrodynamic expansions and the boundary conditions are shown to be mathematically equivalent to the near horizon expansions and petrov - like boundary conditions respectively @xcite .    in the recent years this reformulated gravity / fluid correspondence was greatly generalized @xcite , especially in @xcite we studied a type of constrained perturbations around a class of black holes with curved horizons , and in the near horizon region ( later this was generalized to finite cutoff @xcite ) , we find that such kind of petrov - type - fluctuations could be mapped to a forced compressible viscous fluid in flat space of one less dimension . in these works we went beyond the framework of the bulk / boundary correspondence , and the relaxation of bulk / boundary restriction may possibly be a motivator and reminder of deeper understanding about the holographic principle , also we expect that this further generalization of the gravity / fluid correspondence could unearth more potentiality of gravity as a powerful tool in the study of fluid dynamics .",
    "but we are far from being optimistic , since we have not yet achieved a complete construction , one of the major obstacles is the unusual body force of the fluid system pertaining to the surface stress . to make sense of the external force we need to apply our analysis to other type of solutions of the einstein s equation",
    "so , in this paper we take that first step and study a fluid correspondence of a well - known four - dimensional accelerating black hole solution , i.e. the c - metric black hole .",
    "it turns out that in this case the form of the external force can be better understood , and more intriguingly , the flat space version of the fluid system behaves like a pure vortex .",
    "the whole construction relies on the c - metric solution of the vacuum einstein equation .",
    "the line element reads @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "this solution can be viewed as a one - parameter generalization of the schwarzschild metric and can interpreted as two black holes accelerating apart with a constant proper acceleration @xcite .",
    "the two black holes are separated by an accelerating horizon , so that on each causal patch of the spacetime there is only one black hole with event horizon located at @xmath5 , and the acceleration horizon is located at @xmath6 .",
    "the two positive parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively correspond to the mass and the proper acceleration of the black holes .",
    "to construct the hydrodynamic equations in isotropic coordinates , it is desirable to introduce a conformal isotropic coordinate system in the angular part of the line element . the new coordinates @xmath9 replace the old ones @xmath10 via the relations @xmath11 where @xmath12 plays the role of a radial coordinate on the @xmath13 `` plane '' and it is a univariate function in @xmath14 ranging from 0 to @xmath15 . though seemingly weird , the construction of this new coordinate system is straightforward , and we put the details in the appendix .    using the above transformation , the line element could be rewritten under the coordinates @xmath16 in the form @xmath17 in which @xmath18 ^ 2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is an implicit function of @xmath20 . for calculation purposes ,",
    "it is desirable to rewrite the expression @xmath21 in terms if the implicit function @xmath22 , @xmath23 because of the simple relation @xmath24 which can be verified directly .",
    "this simple relation will be very facilitating in the following calculations .",
    "we start by foliating the c - metric background by three - dimensional timelike hypersurfaces defined by @xmath25 .",
    "the bulk line element could be expressed as @xmath26 where @xmath27 , and @xmath28 with @xmath29 taken to be constant is the induced metric on each hypersurface .",
    "this foliation will enable us to consider the `` initial value formulation '' of the vacuum einstein s equation , taking @xmath29 to be the evolution parameter is actually a spacelike coordinate . ] .",
    "the appropriate initial data could be chosen as a hypersurface @xmath30 located at @xmath31 , together with it s first and second fundamental forms .",
    "the first fundamental form is the projection tensor @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the unit normal covector .",
    "this first fundamental form is closely related to the induced metric , in our coordinate , @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "the second fundamental form is the extrinsic curvature of the hypersurface @xmath36 also in our choice of the coordinate system we have @xmath37 .",
    "after foliating the background manifold , tensors of type @xmath38 could be decomposed into the following form @xmath39 so the equivalent form of the vacuum einstein s equation is @xmath40 the first two lines in are the constraint equations of the initial data @xmath41 on the initial hypersurface , and the third line is the evolution equation . according to the gauss - codazzi equations the constraint equations could be cast in the following form    [ ce1 ] @xmath42    where @xmath43 is the ricci scalar of @xmath30 , @xmath44 is the covariant derivative compatible with @xmath28 .",
    "the equations are often referred to as the hamiltonion and momentum constraints , respectively .",
    "equivalently we could choose @xmath45 as the initial data , here @xmath46 is the the brown - york stress energy tensor .",
    "then the constraint equations can be reformulated as    [ ce2 ] @xmath47    next we turn to the evolution equations @xmath48 . rather than list their concrete forms expressed in terms of @xmath45 ,",
    "let us directly come to the following conclusion , i.e. _ if we perturb the initial data which generates the background spacetime , and demand that it evolves no singularity in the bulk , then the geometry of the perturbed spacetime should be of petrov type i_. so there are additional constraints of the initial data @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the bulk weyl tensor , and @xmath51 are a set of newman - penrose basis vector fields located at the initial hypersurface , here @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "inserting into , we get @xmath54 and expressing these projections of the bulk weyl tensor by @xmath45 , the additional constraint equations will finally become @xmath55 where @xmath56 , @xmath57 represent the riemann and ricci tensors of @xmath30 . up till now",
    "we have derived all the constraint equations in our initial value formulation , and in the following sections we will see that , on highly accelerated hypersurface these equations give rise to the navier - stokes equation .",
    "for the background initial data , @xmath58 can be read directly from the line element of initial hypersurface @xmath30 , so we can obtain the the background brown - york tensor @xmath59 , and the only nonzero components are @xmath60 here we have used the notations @xmath61 , @xmath62 for short , and in the rest of this paper the notations @xmath63 will be similar to @xmath64 with @xmath65 replaced by @xmath66 , which represents the radial position of the black hole event horizon . before imposing perturbation to the background metric , we first consider the non - relativistic limit which will be essential when constructing the non - relativistic hydrodynamics .",
    "this could be achieved mathematically by rescaling the @xmath67 coordinate , @xmath68 , then the back ground metric becomes @xmath69 the reciprocal of the rescaling parameter @xmath70 can viewed as the speed of light and @xmath71 corresponds to the non - relativistic limit . by explicit calculations we find that the brown - york tensor @xmath72 and the constraint equations are kept invariant under this rescaling , whilst some coefficients in the additional constraint is changed :",
    "@xmath73    now we take into account the hydrodynamic limit .",
    "as is proven in@xcite , there is a mathematical equivalence between the near horizon limit and the hydrodynamic limit .",
    "so let us take a particular initial hypersurface which is close to the black hole horizon at @xmath74 .",
    "this can be realized by introducing a small parameter @xmath75 via @xmath76 .",
    "we would like to link the two small parameters @xmath75 and @xmath70 via @xmath77 , where the constant @xmath78 is employed to balance the dimensionality .",
    "this identification makes the non - relativistic limit and the hydrodynamic limit occur simultaneously by taking @xmath71 . in this double limit , @xmath79 , @xmath80 and therefore @xmath72",
    "could be expanded as @xmath81 @xmath82    now let us discuss the perturbation theory in the initial value formulation .",
    "the most general equations for the fluctuations around the background initial data can be very complicated , so we restrict ourselves to the following non - relativistic hydrodynamic @xmath70-expansion .",
    "@xmath83    where @xmath84 represent the fluctuation modes .",
    "in the above double expansion we will derive the constraint equations for the fluctuations , but before that we need to list some necessary materials in the derivation , i.e. the expansions of the christoffel symbol , the riemann tensor @xmath85 and of the ricci tensor @xmath86 , subjecting to the perturbed metric @xmath28 :    @xmath87    here the superscript @xmath88 denotes the geometric quantity pertaining to the background metric .",
    "the nonzero components of the background christoffel symbol are @xmath89 where the @xmath70 dependences arise from the near - horizon expansion .",
    "since the only necessary expression is @xmath90 , so we will not list the nonzero components for @xmath56 and @xmath57 seperatly , rather , by explicit calculations we find @xmath91 thanks to the above relations , we could finally turn ourselves to the constraint equations for the fluctuations .    *",
    "( a ) perturbed hamiltonian constraint *    the middle term in the hamiltonian constraint can be further decomposed according to the spacial slicing , i.e. @xmath92 according to and , we can get @xmath93 where @xmath94 , so , at the first nontrivial order of the perturbed hamiltonion constraint , we have @xmath95 before moving on to the other constraint equations , we need to point out that the derivative operator @xmath44 associated with metric @xmath28 will receive perturbative corrections , so if our discussion is restricted to the intrinsically curved hypersurface @xmath30 , then the covariant form of the momentum and additional constraint will not be strictly expanded as a power series in @xmath70 , but as what will be seen , the first nontrivial order of these pseudo expansions still give rise to the continuity equation and cauchy momentum equation .    *",
    "( b ) pseudo expansions for momentum and additional constraint *    inserting into we get @xmath96    t : & @xmath97 , + i : & @xmath98 [ mccd ]    so at the first nontrivial order of the momentum constraints , we get    [ momcp1 ] @xmath99    due to and we have @xmath100 so , the first nontrivial order of the additional constraint will be @xmath101 , and we have @xmath102    note that at the first nonvanishing order of the pseudo expansion , the trace of the additional constraint is precisely the same as the hamiltonion constraint , i.e. @xmath103    * ( b@xmath104 ) strictly expanded constraint equations *    alternatively we could express and by ordinary derivative , doing so the momentum and additional constraint will be strictly expanded , then at their first nontrivial order , we get    [ momcp2 ] @xmath105    and for the additional constraint , we have @xmath106 where we have used the following short - hand notation @xmath107 interestingly , from and we find that @xmath108 then compare with we will come to the following relation @xmath109 from eqs . , and we could also establish the continuity and cauchy momentum equation , but at the cost of the strict expansion , these equations are not expressed in a covariant form , so we would rather interpret that the final fluid lives in newtonian spacetime , further the equation implies that there is a vortex in the fluid system .",
    "in this section we will study the hydrodynamic equations constructed from the constraints of the fluctuations derived in the last section . for equation and , we need to introduce the following notations : @xmath110 and @xmath111 we will see that it is suitable to interpret @xmath112 as the density , pressure and velocity field of the dual fluid in curved spacetime , while @xmath113 as the dynamic and kinematic viscosity .    with the above notations ,",
    "we can rewrite eq . in the form",
    "@xmath114 which should be considered as the continuity equation for fluid with a stationary density distribution",
    ". then inserting into with the constant @xmath78 chosen as @xmath115 , we get @xmath116 where @xmath117 @xmath118 } + \\frac{1}{\\tilde{\\mu}}\\big ( 3 \\alpha r_h^2 e^{2\\phi } x^j v_j - \\frac{1}{3 } q'_h e^\\phi\\big)x_i    \\\\ & + \\big ( 2 r_h e^\\phi + \\frac{2 f(z)}{\\tilde{\\nu } r_h } + \\frac{3}{\\tilde{\\mu } } \\alpha r_h^2 e^{2\\phi } x^j x_j\\big ) \\tilde{v_i } \\big ] . \\end{split}\\ ] ]    eq . looks much like the cauchy momentum equation , so we will interpret it as the equation that describes the fluid on the curved hypersurface @xmath30 , and so @xmath119 is interpreted as the deviatoric stress for the fluid , and @xmath120 represents a body force .",
    "obviously the acceleration of the black hole is responsible for the appearance of this body force , which vanishes when @xmath121 . in this sense",
    "the body force @xmath122 should be thought of as a pure inertial force .",
    "we turn our attention now to the strictly expanded constraint equations with @xmath123 , because the case @xmath124 corresponds to fluctuations around schwarzschild black hole solution which is somewhat well understood . since @xmath123 , eq .",
    "yields @xmath125 which turns out to be a critical new condition for this case .",
    "first of all , the condition implies that eq .",
    "can be rearranged into @xmath126 to analyze the `` spatial '' components of the perturbed momentum constraint , we need to insert and into .",
    "the computation is rather complicated , but at the first nontrivial order the equation can be simplified into the following form @xmath127 + \\frac{\\alpha r_h e^\\phi}{2\\sqrt{a_h } } \\big(t^{(1 ) } - \\frac{q'_h}{r_h}\\big ) x_i = 0 , \\label{nseq2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] still we have chosen @xmath128 .",
    "next we are going to interpret eqs . and",
    "as the continuity and the cauchy momentum equations in flat newtonion spacetime , so in what follows , all the indices will be raised and lowered by @xmath129 and its inverse @xmath130 . as the last step we would like to introduce the following `` holographic dictionary '' @xmath131 @xmath132 where @xmath133 ( all without tilde ) represent respectively the density , dynamic viscosity , kinematic viscosity , velocity field and the pressure of the fluid living on flat spacetime . under this dictionary ,",
    "eq . becomes the continuity equation @xmath134 and eq .",
    "becomes the standard cauchy momentum equation @xmath135 for the viscous fluid , with the symmetric traceless tensor @xmath136 representing the deviatoric stress , and @xmath137 } -v_i + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v^2 x_i\\big ) \\nonumber\\\\ & + \\frac{\\alpha\\rho}{r_h\\sqrt{a_h}}\\big [ \\frac{1}{2}\\big(p + \\frac{q^\\prime_h}{r_h \\sqrt{a_h}}\\big)x_i - \\big(10 + 6f(z ) w^2 + 9\\frac{\\alpha\\rho}{r_h\\sqrt{a_h } } w^2\\big)v_i\\big ] \\label{flatforce}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] representing a body force . in the last force term",
    ", we have used the short - hand notations @xmath138 and @xmath139        it is clear that the second line in eq . is a pure inertial force because of the overall factor @xmath8 .",
    "as for the first line in eq .",
    ", we could recognize the first term as a kind of coriolis force and the second term as a linear resistance force , so only the last term on the first line remains a mystery .",
    "nevertheless one can recognize that this last force term is proportional to the kinetic energy density of the fluid component , which also sounds good .",
    "anyway we should not forget the role of , which is now rewritten in terms of the holographic dictionary as @xmath140 i.e. the velocity field of the fluid is always perpendicular to its spacial displacement .",
    "this is nothing but a vortex condition . in other words ,",
    "the fluid we constructed on the flat newtonian spacetime is precisely a holographic vortex .    to make an intuitive impression of the vortex fluid",
    ", we present a plot for the density distribution and the velocity field for the particular choice of parameters @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "these plots are given in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "these plots fully justify the conclusion that the fluid indeed behave as a vortex . that the velocity field does not vanish in the far zone",
    "can be interpreted by the presence of the coriolis - like force term in the fluid equation  it just reflects the fact that the coordinate frame that we have chosen is not an asymptotically inertial frame . however , even if we change the coordinate frame into an asymptotically inertial one , the vortex behavior should not be altered , because the vortex flow of the inner ring is different from that of the outer part , so the circular flows of both parts can not be simultaneously removed by a mere change of coordinates .",
    "unlike the ordinary static black holes with maximally symmetric horizons , the c - metric black hole represents two black holes under constant proper acceleration .",
    "the acceleration of the black hole squeezes the horizon surface , leaving less symmetries than the non - accelerating black holes .",
    "our construction reveals that gravity / fluid correspondence can be realized in terms of petrov i boundary condition even for black holes with less symmetries than the usual static black holes with maximally symmetric horizons .",
    "to be more concrete , we have realized two fluid systems from the vacuum c - metric black hole solution , one lives on the curved near horizon hypersurface @xmath30 , the other lives on a flat newtonian spacetime .",
    "both fluid systems possess non - constant but stationary density distributions and kinematic viscosities , and so they are compressible viscous fluids subject to extra body forces .",
    "compared with previous studies on gravity / fluid correspondences , the present work differs in two major aspects .",
    "the first difference occurs in the curved space fluid equations . to our knowledge",
    ", all previous studies on cases with curved near horizon hypersurfaces had led to incompressible navier - stokes equations , even if the hypersurface is anisotropic @xcite or rotating @xcite . however , in the case with c - metric background , the curved space fluid equation is , which , together with , constitute a system of _ compressible _ viscous fluid with stationary density distribution .",
    "the second difference lies in that the extra body forces arising from the c - metric black hole case can have more appropriate physical interpretations . for the first ( curved space ) fluid system , the extra force is purely an inertial force due to the acceleration of the background geometry . for the second ( flat space )",
    "fluid system , the extra force are consisted of an inertial force term , a coriolis - like term , a linear resistance term and a term proportional to the kinetic energy density of the fluid .",
    "it is remarkable that the combination of all these complicated force terms give rise to a pure vortex behavior for the fluid system in this case .    before ending ,",
    "let us stress that the gravity ( with curved horizon)/flat space fluid correspondence realized in @xcite and the present work seems to rely on the conformal flatness of the horizon surface of the background geometry .",
    "however , going through the details of the construction , it is evident that such correspondence only requires the existence of a map from the near horizon hypersurface to the flat space , be it conformal or not .",
    "therefore , it is tempting to consider other cases with more complicated , less symmetric black hole backgrounds .",
    "doing so one might be able to get more general fluid systems with less constraints on the density distributions and/or kinematic viscosities . for this purpose , the black ring geometry in 5 dimensions may be a good choice as background geometry .",
    "we leave the study of such backgrounds to later works .",
    "this work is supported by the national natural science foundation of china under the grant no .",
    "we rewrite the c - metric line element as @xmath143 where @xmath144 if we consider @xmath14 as function of the new coordinate @xmath145 , then @xmath146 becomes @xmath147.\\ ] ] it is clear that if we take @xmath148 then @xmath146 will become @xmath149 which is a weyl rescaling of the line element of a flat euclidean plane in radial coordinate .",
    "now it remains to solve as a separable ordinary differential equation .",
    "it turns out that the function @xmath150 can not be written out explicitly .",
    "rather , its inverse function , @xmath151 , can be written in explicit form , @xmath152^{\\frac{1}{1 - ( 2 \\alpha m ) ^2}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with this result in hand , we can calculate the weyl factor in , and , in the end , @xmath146 is turned into @xmath153 finally , taking the coordinate change @xmath154 the c - metric becomes @xmath155 where @xmath156 ^ 2 ,        \\\\ & e^{\\phi(x^i ) } = \\frac{\\big[1 + 2 \\alpha m \\cos\\big(\\theta(x^i)\\big)\\big ]   \\sin^2 \\big(\\theta(x^i)\\big)}{w^2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]"
