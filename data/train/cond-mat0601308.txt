    "perovskite manganites with the general composition ( @xmath4,@xmath5)mno@xmath2 ( @xmath4 : rare earth , @xmath5 : alkali elements ) are attractive to scientists not only because of their potential applications but also due to their very rich and intriguing physics .",
    "while most of the pristine compounds @xmath4mno@xmath2 are ( insulating ) antiferromagnets due to antiferromagnetic ( af ) superexchange ( se ) interactions between mn@xmath6 ions , the introduction of divalent alkali cations such as sr@xmath7 , ca@xmath7 , or ba@xmath7 into the composition converts an adapted number of mn@xmath6 to mn@xmath8 that in turn gives rise to the @xmath9 ferromagnetic ( fm ) double - exchange ( de ) @xcite interaction .",
    "the presence of de couplings can turn an insulating antiferromagnetic manganite into a ferromagnet with metallic conductivity .",
    "it has been widely accepted that , along with lattice distortions @xcite and phase segregation phenomena , @xcite the de mechanism plays a very important role in governing the properties of manganites .",
    "perovskite manganites have been intensively studied in the last decade since the discovery of the colossal magneto - resistance ( cmr ) phenomenon .",
    "@xcite chemical substitution has been widely used as a conventional method to uncover the underlying physics and to search for compositions with novel properties .",
    "results for both @xmath4- and mn - site substitution have been quite well documented in the literatures . for manganites with a mn@xmath6/mn@xmath8 ratio of 7/3 , substitution of different elements at the rare - earth site has shown that magnetic and transport properties of many manganites depend rather systematically on the average ionic size , @xmath10 , and the ionic size mismatch defined as @xmath11 ( where @xmath12 is the fraction and @xmath13 the ionic radius of the @xmath14th species occupying the @xmath4-site ) , @xcite i.e. on the degree of gdfeo@xmath2-type lattice distortion and lattice disorder . however , despite many attempts at modifying the magnetic lattice of mn ions by direct substitution at the mn - sites , the complexity caused by too many factors that govern the properties of the materials , no universal features have been revealed to date . in this paper , we report that the reduction of the ferromagnetic ordering transition temperature @xmath3 of la@xmath0sr@xmath1mn@xmath15__m__@xmath16o@xmath2 ( @xmath17 , ti ) scales with the relative substitution concentrations and is consistent with a prediction from molecular - field theory ( mft ) of the dilution of a magnetic lattice .",
    "the substitutions with al and ti are _ selective _ in nature because al@xmath6 only substitutes for mn@xmath6 and ti@xmath8 only for mn@xmath8 .",
    "another advantage of these substitutions is that because al@xmath6 and ti@xmath8 ions do not carry a magnetic moment , they are also expected not to participate in the magnetic interaction .",
    "in this paper , la@xmath0sr@xmath1mn@xmath15__m__@xmath16o@xmath2 is denoted as lsma@xmath18 for _ _ m__@xmath19 = al and lsmt@xmath18 for _ _",

    "the products are then sintered at 1370 @xmath22c for 48 h in ambient atmosphere .",
    "the final samples are obtained after a very slow cooling process from the sintering to room temperature with an annealing step at 700 @xmath22c for few hours .",
    "room - temperature x - ray diffraction patterns ( measured by a siemens - d5000 with cu-@xmath23 radiation ) show that all of the samples are crystallized in perovskite rhombohedral structures with almost no sign of secondary phases or remnants of the starting materials .",

    "the essential characteristics are carefully measured and reexamined .",
    "temperature dependent magnetization measurements , @xmath29 , in both zero - field - cooled ( zfc ) and field - cooled ( fc ) protocols , are carried out for all the samples .",
    "the fc @xmath29 curves presented in fig .",

    "a transition is observed for all the samples , even with lsmt@xmath1 where mn@xmath8 ions are supposed to be completely absent .",
    "however , as is implied by the zfc and fc @xmath29 curves in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] , the lstmt@xmath1 sample is not a true ferromagnet , nor a pure spin glass as has been suggested in ref . 12 for this composition .",
    "this last conclusion is also corroborated by the fact that our frequency - dependent ac - susceptibility measurements @xmath31 ( not shown ) do not indicate a dynamic phase transition .",

    "2 ) indicate that the samples are substantially saturated in an applied field of just above 1 t. at higher fields , the lsma@xmath41 and lsma@xmath42 samples exhibit flat @xmath38 dependencies as expected for conventional ferromagnets at high fields and low temperatures .",
    "closer inspection on the @xmath38 curves for @xmath43 shows , however , that they are quite linear in the high - field regime up to 4.5 t with a small slope which increases with @xmath30 . the small slope would come from the suppression of thermal fluctuations of the magnetization by the magnetic field .",
    "however , the evolution of the slope of the @xmath38 curves with @xmath30 in the high field regime may signal a magnetic contribution from certain mn ions that do not take part in the ferromagnetic phase . in addition , for the whole series , the measured magnetization in magnetic fields up to 4.5 t does not reach the theoretical magnetization value and even deviates further with increasing @xmath30 .",
    "based on these features , it is presumable that segregation into fm and non - fm phases occurs in these samples .",
    "the experimental values of the saturation magnetization @xmath36 of the fm phase presented in fig . [ figure2 ] ( and also fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] for ti substitution ) are determined by extrapolating the linear part of the @xmath38 curves in the high field regime to @xmath44 .",
    "the difference between experimental and theoretical @xmath36 is then attributed to the non - fm contributions , @xmath45 .",
    "very similar results are also obtained for the lsmt@xmath18 series , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] .",
    "previous observations of the decrease of @xmath36 in al and ti substitutions in manganites have been published and interpreted by several other authors .",
    "@xcite the decrease of @xmath36 was attributed to the dilution and the weakening of fm exchange couplings as in general .",
    "@xcite suggest even a change of the spin state or the orbital ordering of the mn ions .",
    "the deviation between the experimental @xmath36 and its theoretical values has not been adequately considered . in a study on la@xmath0ca@xmath1mn@xmath15al@xmath46o@xmath2 by neutron diffraction , the effective magnetic moment per mn",
    "ion was found far smaller than the saturation moment and that was explained by assumptions of magnetic inhomogeneity and structural disorder.@xcite our interpretation for the @xmath36 deviation in terms of magnetic phase segregation is somehow closer to that proposed for la@xmath0ca@xmath1mn@xmath47o@xmath2 ( @xmath48= ti , ga ) compounds by cao _",
    "et al . _ , @xcite where the authors suggest that ti@xmath8 and ga@xmath6 ions generate around them non - ferromagnetic ( paramagnetic or possibly antiferromagnetic ) regions .    as pointed out above ,",
    "there is a growing deviation of the fm saturation magnetization from the calculated value with increasing substitution concentration .",
    "this observation indicates that the substitution not only reduces the total number of mn ions but also raises the number of non - fm mn ions at the expense of the fm phase .",
    "since the mn@xmath6/mn@xmath8 ionic concentration ratio is driven away from the optimal value of 7/3 by the substitution , a certain amount of the mn ions may become _ redundant _ with respect to the de couplings .",
    "i.e. , the selective substitution on one mn ionic species produces the redundancy on the other mn species .",
    "those redundant ions contribute to the non - fm phase . with small values of @xmath30 ,",
    "the redundant ions are thus mostly mn@xmath8 for @xmath17 while they are mn@xmath6 for the ti substitution .",
    "based on this assumption the concentration of non - fm mn ions can approximately be derived from @xmath45 . for examples , with @xmath49 , the estimated redundant concentration of mn@xmath8 is 0.187 for @xmath50 and the corresponding concentration of mn@xmath6 is 0.064 for @xmath51 . with sufficiently high substitution concentrations , contributions to the the non - fm phase may also arise from the mn ions of both species that are isolated by the non - magnetic ones .",

    "the parent compound , @xmath55 , has @xmath56 k , in good agreement with previously reported data.@xcite @xmath3 decreases monotonically as @xmath30 increases in both cases .",
    "explanations for the decrease of @xmath3 with al and ti substitution in manganites have been suggested by several authors .",
    "@xcite one explanation is simply that the decrease of @xmath3 is due to the suppression of long - range fm order of the localized @xmath57 spins by local breakdown of the exchange couplings where the substitution occurs .",
    "@xcite hu _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite assumed that the substituted ti@xmath8 ions tends to demolish the de @xmath58 bonds and lowers the hole carrier concentration , thus suppressing the de interaction and lowering @xmath3 .",
    "_ @xcite suggested that the presence of ti in lsmt@xmath18 favors se interaction and suppresses the de mechanism .",
    "significantly , kim _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite recently found that the ti substitution in lsmt@xmath18 increases the @xmath59 bond length and reduces the bond angle . based on structural data , the authors calculated the variation of @xmath60-electron bandwidth @xmath61 , finding a decrease of @xmath61 with @xmath30 , and related it to the decrease of @xmath3 .",
    "it is worth noting that the ionic size of mn@xmath8 ( @xmath62  ) is smaller than that of ti@xmath8 ( @xmath63  ) while mn@xmath6 ( @xmath64  ) is larger than al@xmath6 ( @xmath65 ).@xcite as a result , the effects of al and ti substitution on the structure , and hence @xmath61 , may not be the same and even opposite in the two cases .",
    "however , in reality , @xmath3 has been found always to decrease with the substitution .",
    "a detailed study on the structure of lsma@xmath18 may help justify the cause .    as is seen in fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] , the effect of substitution with ti on the reduction of @xmath3 ( defined by @xmath66(@xmath30)@xmath67(0 ) ) is as much as more than twice of that of al substitution .",
    "however , as mentioned above , because the substitution is selective , in order to compare their effects , instead of using @xmath30 as the common variable , the data should be presented as functions of relative substitution concentrations , defined as @xmath68 when @xmath69 and @xmath70 when @xmath71 .",
    "physically , @xmath72 is the average concentration of @xmath48 per mn site of the selectively - substituted mn ionic species ( mn@xmath6 for @xmath69 , or mn@xmath8 for @xmath73 ) , or the probability that site is occupied by an @xmath48 ion .",
    "strikingly , as displayed in figure [ figure5 ] , the @xmath74 data for @xmath75 and ti collapse onto one curve which follows very well the linear line predicted by the molecular - field theory ( see below ) .",
    "it is also surprising that the linear behavior of @xmath74 of lsmt@xmath18 sustains in a very wide range of @xmath72 and has the tendency to reduce to zero at @xmath76 .    for further understanding and analyzes of the results , we use a mean - field approximation to derive the relation between @xmath3 and @xmath72 . according to the heisenberg model",
    ", the potential energy of exchange interactions of any particular magnetic ion @xmath14 with the other ions @xmath77 is given by @xmath78 where @xmath79 , @xmath80 are the spins of the @xmath14th and @xmath77th ions respectively ; and @xmath81 the exchange integral . @xmath82 can be rewritten as @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the magnetic moment and the number of magnetic ions per unit volume , respectively and @xmath86 , @xmath87 are the magnetic moment of the @xmath14th and @xmath77th ions .",
    "for simplicity , @xmath87 is replaced with the average magnetic moment per site @xmath88 .",
    "assuming that the @xmath14th ion interacts only with its nearest - neighbor ions , but with @xmath89 different exchange coupling constants @xmath90 each involves @xmath91 ions , then instead of summing over the ions @xmath77 , the summation is made over the interactions .",
    "we can then recast eq .",

[ eqn4 ] is perhaps not relevant to our manganite systems at first because of the mixed - valence of the mn ions and the coexistence of different kinds of interaction including se af interactions @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and the de fm interaction @xmath58 with corresponding exchange constants denoted as @xmath112 , @xmath113 , and @xmath114 , and nearest - neighbor interacting ions number @xmath115 , @xmath116 , and @xmath117 , respectively . according to eq .",
    "[ eqn3 ] , a linear behavior is expected to be observed for @xmath118 only if ( i ) the exchange coupling constants are unchanged and ( ii ) the dilution either affects @xmath91 in a proportional manner such that @xmath119 or does not affect it at all . supposing that @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 do not change with substitution , within the linearity regime of @xmath74 , it is presumable that the al ( or ti ) substitution leaves @xmath123 ( or @xmath124 ) intact but possibly changes both @xmath125 and @xmath124 ( or @xmath123 ) proportionally to @xmath126 .",
    "the most remarkable feature of the @xmath74 variation in fig .",
    "[ figure5 ] is that @xmath3 has a tendency to go to zero when @xmath76 .",
    "this would simply mean that the @xmath127 product of de couplings is totally dominant over those of the se ones .",
    "considering the fact that at low dilution concentrations , since the mn@xmath6 and mn@xmath8 concentrations are not too different , @xmath125 , @xmath124 , and @xmath123 are possibly comparable , thus it is reasonable to suppose that the se couplings @xmath121 , @xmath122 both are negligibly small in these systems .",
    "this could be one reason behind the fact that @xmath55 is a unique manganite in the sense that it has the highest @xmath3 amongst the perovskite manganites .",
    "in a situation when the se coupling constants are significant , because either @xmath124 or @xmath123 does not change by selective substitution , according to eq . [ eqn3 ] , @xmath74 may still have a linear dependence but should have a tendency to intercept @xmath72-axis at a certain value @xmath128 .",
    "apart from changes of the @xmath104 values , the substitution of al or ti for mn could cause some additional effects .",
    "because they are nonmagnetic , the magnetic coupling will be broken at any site they occupy , leading to a weakening of long - range fm ordering established by the dominant de interactions and a deterioration of the metallic conductivity .",
    "the selectivity of the substitution also drives the mn@xmath6/mn@xmath8 ratio away from the optimal 7/3 value contributing to developing the non - fm phase .",
    "the differences in ionic sizes between mn and al and ti could modify the crystal structure , especially the angle and length of the @xmath59 couplings.@xcite all these factors contribute to the degradation of the ferromagnetism and metallicity of the manganite system .",
    "nevertheless , the linear behavior of @xmath74 observed in fig .",
    "[ figure5 ] implies that , within the substitution ranges , those effects are dominated by the effect of dilution . in addition , there is a significant difference between the two substitutions .",
    "while the amount of al substitution reduces the number of hopping electrons by an equivalent amount , ti substitution does not affect it at all .",
    "the shortage of hopping electrons would possibly explain the large number of mn@xmath8 redundancy in the lsma@xmath18 compounds .",
    "we believe that this difference has a link to the reason why the linear behavior of @xmath74 of lsma@xmath18 occurs in a much narrower range of dilution ( @xmath129 ) than that of lsmt@xmath18 where @xmath74 is found linear up to @xmath130 .",
    "it is worth noting that @xmath74 would not follow the linear behavior up to @xmath131 as predicted by the mft because there should exist a percolation threshold @xmath132 , above which clustering occurs and the ferromagnetic network collapses into only short - range ordering and superparamagnetism .    in the case when both al and ti are substituted for mn with according @xmath133 and @xmath134 , supposing that the ferromagnetic double exchange is totally dominant in the system , the dilution concentration of the whole system is determined as @xmath135 . to check the validity of the mft analysis in this case",
    ", the @xmath74 values of the @xmath105 ( @xmath106 ) and @xmath107 ( @xmath108 ) compounds are also added to figure [ figure5 ] .",
    "the data fit fairly well the mft prediction .",
    "however , when the superexchange interactions are taken into account , the physical scenario for this case will be more complicated and may need further detailed investigations .",
    "we have reexamined the magnetic and transport properties of the la@xmath0sr@xmath1mn@xmath47o@xmath2 system , where mn is selectively substituted by @xmath75 or ti ; either mn@xmath6 or mn@xmath8 is selectively substituted for , but @xmath48 is randomly distributed in the mn network .",
    "the analyzes of the @xmath38 measurements and saturation magnetization revealed that the substitution appears to not only merely dilute the magnetic lattice of mn ions , but also induce a redundancy of mn ions .",
    "we have introduced the _ selective dilution concentration _ @xmath72 and discovered that in certain ranges of @xmath72 , depending on particular @xmath48 , @xmath3 scales very well with @xmath72 in linearity , being in good agreement with the mft approximation .",
    "the tendency of @xmath3 to reduce to zero at @xmath76 suggests a dominant role of the de mechanism in this system ; the se interaction is effectively negligible .",
    "remarkably , the linear behavior of @xmath74 is observed in a very wide range of @xmath72 in lsmt@xmath18 making this system an excellent candidate for studies on the effects of dilution where @xmath3 could be almost independently tuned without side effects .",
    "it is also proposed that the reduction in the number of hopping @xmath60 electrons is one cause for the difference in the effects of dilution between the lsmt@xmath18 and lsma@xmath18 compounds .",
    "the mft analyzes are found to some extend also valid for the case when al and ti are both substituted for mn .",
