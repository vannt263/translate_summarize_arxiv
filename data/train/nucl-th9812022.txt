    "the reaction @xmath1 near threshold was studied relatively long ago @xcite .",
    "the authors of those papers claimed to have found an abnormal behavior of the production amplitude for this reaction near threshold that is not yet understood theoretically @xcite .",
    "this conclusion was based on a comparison of the measured cross section with that for the production of a stable particle .",
    "specifically , they found that the production cross section is proportional to @xmath2 instead of @xmath3 , as expected .",
    "( @xmath3 denotes the momentum of the outgoing neutron in the center of momentum system . )",
    "this behavior was interpreted as possible evidence for a resonance in the @xmath4 system not far above threshold @xcite . at the same time",
    "there are no direct indications of the existence of such a resonance in the @xmath5channel .",
    "recently a behavior similar to that of the cross section under discussion was also found in the reaction @xmath6 @xcite .    the transition amplitude @xmath7 , while interesting in its own right , is also of great importance in other reactions .",
    "theoretical analyses of the reactions @xmath8 @xcite , @xmath9 @xcite and @xmath10 @xcite , as well as @xmath0 production in proton  nucleus collisions @xcite all rely on the @xmath7 transition amplitude , in which the pion enters as an exchanged particle , as the basic mechanism for the reactions studied .",
    "it is thus of great theoretical interest to obtain direct , reliable experimental information on this reaction .",
    "@xcite information the experiments cited above were all performed in an unusual kinematical situation : instead of measuring the momentum distribution of the final state for a fixed beam energy , the excitation function for a fixed neutron momentum versus initial energy was measured .    in this work",
    "we analyze the general expression for the production cross section of unstable particles in near  threshold binary reactions . both situations  the standard one , wherein the energy is fixed and the final state momentum is varied  and that of the above experiments , wherein one of the final momenta is fixed while varying the energy , are compared .",
    "we shall demonstrate that the dependence of the count rates on the outgoing center of mass momentum depends on how the analysis is done .",
    "we conclude that the behavior of the @xmath11 amplitude is quite normal .",
    "that means that the earlier interpretation of the experimental data @xcite is incorrect .",
    "to explain the results of the cited papers , we need a smooth behavior of the averaged matrix element that must be a decreasing function of energy in the near  threshold region .",
    "we begin by discussing the production of a resonance using a monochromatic beam .",
    "we then consider the integration of the so - obtained cross section over the beam energy , which is the procedure that was carried out experimentally in refs .",
    "we close with a discussion of the formulae used in the cited papers to analyze the experimental data .",
    "let us consider the case of a monochromatic beam of energy @xmath12 . in this case",
    "the differential cross section @xmath13 for production of a stable particle is @xmath14 where @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) and @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) denote the reduced mass and the momentum of the initial state ( final state ) respectively .",
    "this integral is proportional to @xmath19 after the integration is performed .",
    "if we consider the cross section for the production of an omega meson or any other resonance with finite width @xmath20 , expression ( [ stabl ] ) must be convoluted with the spectral density @xmath21 . for simplicity",
    "we use a breit - wigner form for the spectral density , namely @xmath22 here @xmath23 is the average mass of the unstable particle . in this case",
    "the resonance production cross section is given by the expression : @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the maximum momentum of the outgoing neutron for the reaction @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath26 is determined by the masses of the lightest decay products of the unstable particle .    note that , because of the experimental setup",
    ", the authors of the papers [ 13 ] have not measured the total differential cross section for the production of an unstable particle as given by eq .",
    "( 3 ) , but only a fraction of it , as the momentum of the outgoing neutron was constrained to lie in a small band around a given @xmath3 . in other words",
    ", they have measured the following part of differential cross section : @xmath27 let us estimate the remaining integral for the case when the scattering amplitude @xmath28 is approximately constant in the interval @xmath29 , as one would expect close to the production threshold . in this case",
    "we get @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 . here",
    "the limits are @xmath33  .",
    "as will become clear below , the behavior of the integral depends on the parameter @xmath34    let us consider the case of small @xmath3 and @xmath29 such that the condition @xmath35 is satisfied . in this limit",
    "the denominator under the integral is practically constant , so that we have @xmath36 where @xmath37 .",
    "the dependence of this integral on energy looks like a bw - resonance with strength proportional to @xmath38 .",
    "this was the dependence found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "[ sec : integr ] in the experiments @xcite an additional integration over the beam energy ( still keeping @xmath3 fixed ) was performed in order to remove the width - dependence from eq .",
    "( [ wide ] ) .",
    "indeed , since the spectral density is normalized , integrating over the beam energy gives @xmath39 the above derivation shows specifically that @xmath40 where @xmath41 .",
    "the right hand side of this equation is displayed in figure [ fig ] , based on the data of ref .",
    "@xcite for the points with @xmath42 . as for the point at @xmath43",
    ", we used the data from ref .",
    "@xcite , averaged over an interval of @xmath44 .",
    "note that the errors of @xmath45 displayed in the plot contain the uncertainty in @xmath3 as well .",
    "figure 1 gives evidence for a matrix element @xmath46 that is practically constant , at least for the points @xmath47 .",
    "the data above @xmath48 give evidence for a matrix element that decreases smoothly with @xmath3 , as would be expected in the usual effective range approximation .",
    "we conclude therefore that the existing experimental data @xcite for the reaction @xmath49 give no indication of a growth of the matrix element for increasing @xmath3 in a wide interval of momenta @xmath3 above threshold .",
    "note that the over  all dependence of the matrix element on @xmath3 is contrary to the conclusions of refs .",
    "[ 1 - 3 ] .",
    "[ sec : chi ]    we now investigate the second limiting case ,    @xmath50    to estimate the integral ( [ integr ] ) in this situation we must further distinguish separately two possibilities :    \\i ) the energy parameter @xmath51 is within the limits @xmath52 and @xmath53 of the integral ( [ integr ] ) . in this case @xmath54",
    "\\ii ) the energy parameter @xmath51 is not within the interval @xmath55 $ ] .",
    "the integral @xmath56 is then strongly suppressed .    in short ,",
    "if condition ( [ more ] ) is satisfied we get the usual energy behavior for the differential cross section , namely a linear @xmath3dependence .    the condition @xmath57 determines the critical value of @xmath3",
    "thus , by measuring the count rates versus @xmath3 one may observe a transition from a @xmath38 behavior of the cross section at low @xmath3 to a linear dependence at high @xmath3 , even for a constant matrix element . in the case of the omega",
    "this takes place at @xmath58 , if @xmath59 mev , as specified in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the production of @xmath60 and @xmath61 was studied as well .",
    "the authors report that here a behavior very different from what they found for @xmath0 production . using the above discussion",
    "one can now easily understand this : for both mesons condition ( [ more ] ) was satisfied , since @xmath62 mev for the @xmath60 and @xmath63 mev for the @xmath61 .",
    "[ sec : incor ]    to complete our criticism of the analyses of refs .",
    "@xcite , we compare our formulae to those given therein .",
    "let us start by briefly repeating the arguments for a linear dependence of the @xmath0 production cross section on @xmath3 given in @xcite . instead of eq .",
    "( 1 ) for the production of a stable particle , ref .",
    "@xcite starts directly from the expression for the double  differential cross section , @xmath64 in order to get the total production rates for producing final particles with a given @xmath3 , expression ( [ pru ] ) was integrated over the initial energy under the constraint @xmath65 . by employing energy conservation , i.e. using the condition @xmath66 ( [ pru ] )",
    "can be formally integrated .",
    "since the spectral density is normalized , this integration yields @xmath67 this procedure to obtain eq .",
    "( [ binniecs ] ) from eq .",
    "( [ pru ] ) looks formally correct , but it is not .",
    "the reason for this is that in order to derive eq .",
    "( [ pru ] ) the energy conserving @xmath68function in eq .",
    "( 1 ) was evaluated .",
    "therefore @xmath3 in eq . ( [ pru ] )",
    "implicitly depends on @xmath12 and @xmath69 and thus must be treated as a dependent variable in any argument based on eq .",
    "( [ pru ] ) .",
    "therefore the use of the relation ( [ encon ] ) in this context is simply incorrect .",
    "instead , the condition of allowing @xmath3 to vary only in a small interval translates into a condition on the ranges of integration of @xmath69 , given a fixed energy @xmath12 , namely @xmath70 with @xmath71 .",
    "this formula actually agrees with our eq .",
    "( 5 ) if we rewrite it in terms of an integration over @xmath72 .",
    "therefore we conclude that in the theoretical analysis of refs .",
    "@xcite the limits of integration were not properly treated , thereby leading to an inappropriate conclusion for the momentum dependence of the cross section .",
    "it is this point that was overlooked in the earlier works . if we impose the limit @xmath73 on eq .",
    "( [ invo2 ] ) and integrate over the energy we again find @xmath74    to clarify the situation we would like to add that the final result agrees with what one expects when taking the decay of the unstable particle into account explicitly . let us , for simplicity , assume a two particle decay , as illustrated in figure [ diagram ] . in this case the phase space is the 3 body phase space and we get @xmath75 where @xmath76 denotes the dressed @xmath0 propagator , @xmath77 is the decay amplitude , @xmath78 is the reduced mass of the decay particles and @xmath79 their relative momentum .",
    "therefore eq .",
    "( [ 3part ] ) agrees with ( [ invo ] ) when we identify @xmath80where we used unitarity for the second identity .",
    "( [ specdef ] ) agrees with the standard definition of a spectral function .",
    "to summarize , we demonstrated that the interpretation of the experimental results for the reaction @xmath1 given in refs .",
    "@xcite is incorrect .",
    "a proper treatment of the independent variables leads to an expression for the momentum dependence of the integrated cross section that is consistent with a constant matrix element near the production threshold .",
    "the procedure of refs .",
    "@xcite was also used in ref .",
    "@xcite and thus our criticism applies to the conclusion of this paper as well .",
    "however , we want to emphasize that we regard the method of integrating over the beam energy while keeping the final momentum fixed as useful way to examine the production of narrow resonances close to their production threshold .",
    "this technique allows for a more direct access to the production amplitude and , simultaneously , to an increase in the counting rate .",
    "we demonstrated that as the momentum @xmath3 grows , the formula for the cross section reduces to the standard one for the production of a stable particle , as expected .",
    "the relevant parameter is @xmath81 .",
    "the knowledge of the transition amplitude @xmath7 is an important input for several approaches investigating @xmath0 production in hadron ",
    "hadron collisions @xcite",
