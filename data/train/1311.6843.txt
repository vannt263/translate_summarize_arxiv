    "in the series of articles @xcite , we numerically investigated the electric potential problem with high contrast local conductivities ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) for continuum percolation models ( cpms ) in order to reveal the electrical properties of a real material consisting of conductive nano - particles in an insulator .",
    "we solved generalized laplace equations with mixed boundary conditions using the finite difference method . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we investigated two - dimensional case and numerically showed that the equipotential curves exhibit the fractal structure around the threshold @xmath3 and gave an approximated curve representing a relation between the homogenized conductivity and the volume fraction @xmath4 over @xmath8 $ ] , which we call _ conductivity curve_. the fractal structure in ref .",
    "@xcite shows the electrical properties of the system , i.e. , there appear quasi - equipotential clusters there , in which the potential distribution is constant or nearly constant . on the other hands , due to the ultra high conductivity of an insulator",
    ", we have a non - vanishing homogenized conductivity even for a smaller volume - fraction @xmath4 than the threshold @xmath3 .",
    "it is also important to determine the dependence of the homogenized conductivity on volume fraction @xmath4 for every @xmath9 $ ] .    in this article",
    ", we go on to investigate the electric potential distribution on a two - dimensional continuum percolation model ( cpm ) @xcite with a high contrast local conductivity to improve the results in ref .",
    "@xcite from more mathematical viewpoints .",
    "we consider the simplest boolean model of cpm , in which disks of unit radius are centered at the points of the poisson point process with density @xmath10 @xcite . in order to consider the duality between the occupancy state ( os ) and the vacancy state ( vs )",
    ", we handle both types in this article ; the os - type is set so that occupied regions have the local conductivity @xmath11 and the vacant regions have infinitesimal one @xmath12 , whereas in the vs - type , the occupied regions have @xmath12 and the vacant regions have @xmath13 .",
    "vs - type is sometimes called the swiss cheese model in physics literature if @xmath14 .    using the duality of two dimensional case , the purposes of this article are to find the geometric properties of the potential distribution , especially the fractal structure of the equipotential curves around the threshold , and to extend the domain @xmath5 $ ] of conductivity curve for the homogenized conductivity to @xmath7 $ ] , which leads us a novel parameterization of the conductivity curve even of three dimensional case .",
    "the homogenized conductivity in cpm has been rigorously studied well and has a long history as recently kontogiannis @xcite gave a nicer review of these studies and an extension .",
    "the studies from more practical viewpoints based on the numerical results are in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite . in this article ,",
    "based on these rigorous results and numerical computations , we give an improvement of the previous arguments in ref .",
    "thus the conventions and notations in this article completely differ from the previous ones @xcite since they were written in the framework of physics . in general , the homogenization is assumed a periodicity of its associated system . instead of the periodicity",
    ", we use the ergodicity of cpm to homogenize the conductivity following refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite because the boolean model has the ergodic properties @xcite .    due to the duality of os- and vs - types ,",
    "it is well - known that our second order partial differential equations ( pdes ) have the quasiconformal properties of the pdes as the quasi - harmonic system @xcite . using the quasiconformal property and the keller - dykhne reciprocity law @xcite of the conductivity ,",
    "the equipotential curves are represented mathematically .",
    "we showed that in theorem [ mapqs ] for the infinitesimal limit of @xmath12 , the os - type potential distribution in cpm forms a quasiconformal map from the domain to @xmath7\\times[0,1]$ ] with random slits .",
    "it implies that at @xmath6 , the quasi - harmonic potential problem in cpm is quasiconformally equivalent to a random slit problem .",
    "since one of our purposes is to reveal the fractal structure of the equipotential curves @xcite , we give theorem [ thm : eqicurve ] and using it , show an observation in remark [ rmk : obs ] that the equipotential curves at @xmath15 are conformally mapped to the family of the lines with infinite length under some assumptions . further the conformal map gives a relation to a riemann sphere @xmath16 .",
    "the other purpose is to find the properties of the conductivity under the threshold . in order to use the duality",
    ", we give our numerical computations of the conductivity of vs - type using the monte - carlo method and finite difference method as we did for os - type in ref .",
    "@xcite . then based upon these results ,",
    "we give novel approximation formulae of the conductivity curves .",
    "in other words , using the duality , we give approximation formulae of the conductivity curves in remark [ rmk : r_cond2 ] and figure 8 ( a ) .",
    "figure 8 ( a ) shows that the approximation formulae represent well the computational results of the homogenized conductivities .",
    "it leads us another approximation formula of the conductivity curve of three - dimensional case as in remark [ rmk : r_cond3 ] and figure 8 ( b ) . in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , we have numerically studied the homogenized conductivity on the cpm with os - type local conductivity mainly in three dimensional case by solving the generalized laplace equation with a certain dirichlet - neumann boundary conditions .",
    "the proposed formula also approximates well the conductivity curve of the random spheres in remark [ rmk : r_cond3 ] as in figure 8 ( b ) .",
    "it means that in terms of the novel formula , we can parameterize the conductivity properties discussed in refs .  @xcite and @xcite .",
    "contents in this article are as follows .",

    "2.2 gives our pdes or the generalized laplace equations on the cpms .",
    "sec .  3 also shows the well - established results homogenization of the conductivity associated with our pdes . in sec .  4 ,",
    "after we review the quasiconformal properties of the pdes as the quasi - harmonic system , we show that in the infinitesimal limit of @xmath0 , the potential distribution is quasiconformally equivalent to a configuration of a random slit model in theorem [ mapqs ] , which is the first our main result .",
