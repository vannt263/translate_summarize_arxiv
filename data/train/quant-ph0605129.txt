    "wigner s 1932 initiative @xcite is a reformulation of the operator based quantum theory of schrdinger in the language of c - number distribution functions in a phase space .",
    "his prescription , however , turns out to have a feature extra to what one finds in schrdinger s theory .",
    "there is nothing in the founding principles of the operator based theory to prescribe a rule for ordering of the factors of non - commuting operators in a product .",
    "in contrast , wigner s formalism , upon reduction from phase space to the configuration space , acquires weyl s ordering @xcite .",
    "how and at what stage , in going from schrdinger s state functions in configuration space to those of wigner in phase space and again coming back to the configuration space , weyl s ordering creeps in ?",
    "this feature is not unique to wigner s functions .",
    "other distributions exist in the literature , e.g. , kirkwood @xcite , husimi @xcite , margenau and hill @xcite , etc .",
    "each of them carries its own ordering rule , with no precedence in the configuration space formalism .",
    "can one conjecture that the phase space formulations of quantum mechanics are more complete than their configuration space counterpart , because of their built - in ordering rules ?",
    "if so , there should be a way to arrive at phase space formulations without reference to the conventional operator based theory . here",
    "we argue that in the classical dynamics and classical statistical dynamics ( liouville s equation ) the generalized coordinates and momenta , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively , play symmetric and more importantly , independent roles . in the operator based quantum theory one or",
    "the other looses its identity at the expense of the other and the formalism reduces , to one in either @xmath2 or @xmath4 space",
    ". one could avoid this by carrying the @xmath2 and @xmath3 formalisms concomitantly and at once arrive at state functions in @xmath5spaces .",
    "the so - obtained state functions are the @xmath5representation of the mixed states of quantum statistical mechanics .",
    "the operator based theory emerges as a special case of this general one , but this time with a definite ordering rule for non - commutative operators .",
    "the rule depends on the nature of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 variables , adopted initially .",
    "let @xmath6be the collection of the generalized coordinates describing the state of motion of a dynamical system .",
    "it is customary to assign a lagrangian , @xmath7 , to the system , define the conjugate momenta , @xmath8 , and construct the @xmath9 .",
    "one may do the other way around .",
    "begin with a given@xmath10and find@xmath11as a solution of the following differential equation , @xmath12 one may , however , carry out the same procedure with @xmath2 replaced by @xmath3 and arrive at a @xmath13 satisfying the differential equation @xmath14 the use of@xmath15to study the evolution of a dynamical system is not a common practice .",
    "but it is a possibility and has precedence @xcite .",
    "there is no barring to employ the two alternatives simultaneously .",
    "we follow sobouti and nasiri @xcite , ( hereafter , paper i ) and define the `` extended lagrangian ''",
    "@xmath16 the first two terms on the right hand side constitute a total time derivative and are introduced for later convenience .",
    "one may now write down the euler - lagrange equations for @xmath2 and @xmath3 , @xmath17 equation ( [ eq4 ] ) is the conventional equation of motion in @xmath2 space . with preassigned initial values @xmath18 and",
    "@xmath19 at @xmath20 it can be solved for the orbits @xmath21 in @xmath2 space . similarly , with given initial values @xmath22and @xmath23 , eq ( [ eq5 ] ) can be solved for the orbits @xmath24 in the @xmath3 space .",
    "the condition for @xmath2 and @xmath3 orbits to represent the same state of motion of the system are @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "such a state of motion will be referred to as a `` pure state '' .",
    "otherwise it will be called a `` mixed state '' of motion .",
    "the nomenclature is from the statistical quantum mechanics and it will be seen later that they imply the same notions as therein . on a pure state @xmath3 and @xmath2 are initially canonically conjugate pairs and it is shown in paper i that once they are canonically conjugate at one time they remain so for all times . on the other hand",
    "there are no restrictions on the initial values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 on mixed states .",
    "therefore , @xmath21 and @xmath24 remain unrelated and evolve independently .",
    "the existence of the extended lagrangian @xmath27 , however , permits the following `` extended momenta '' to be defined , @xmath28 these in turn allow an `` extended hamiltonian '' to be defined through the following legendre transformation , @xmath29 to eliminate @xmath30 and @xmath31 from @xmath32 one substitutes a ) for @xmath33 from eq ( [ eq3 ] ) , b ) for @xmath34 and @xmath35 from eqs ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) and c ) for @xmath36 and @xmath37 from eqs ( [ eq6 ] ) and ( [ eq7 ] ) .",
    "one arrives at @xmath38,\\label{eq9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the derivatives are to be evaluated at @xmath0 . we leave it to the reader to familiarize him / herself with @xmath39 by writing down four hamilton s equations for @xmath40 and @xmath41  . here , the condition for pure state motions is @xmath42 , and once they are initially zero they remain so for all times .",
    "then by eqs ( [ eq6 ] ) and ( [ eq7 ] ) @xmath2 and @xmath3 turn into canonically conjugate pairs for all times ( paper i ) .",
    "to summarize , for any dynamical system we introduce an extended phase space , @xmath43 , extended momenta , lagrangians , and hamiltonians .",
    "all concepts and procedures of the conventional dynamics are extendible to this extended dynamics",
    ". of particular relevance to this paper , that will be referred to shortly , are : 1 ) canonical transformations from one set of variables @xmath43 to another , and 2 ) poisson s brackets extended as @xmath44",
    "now that we have the extended hamiltonian of eq ( [ eq9 ] ) we may construct a quantum mechanics in @xmath46 space .",
    "we do this on the following premises :    1 .",
    "let @xmath47 be the function space of all integrable complex functions @xmath48 .",

    "2 .   by the virtue of eq ( [ eq11 ] ) ,",
    "@xmath39 is now an operator on @xmath53 .",

    "let the rule to evaluate the expectation values of an observable @xmath56 , a real c - number operator on @xmath53 , be @xmath57 we will return to this averaging rule shortly , and revise it .",
    "the logic behind it , however , is to be noted , the averages of observables should be real . in what follows",
    "we demonstrate that , 1 ) the formalism so designed is a theory of quantum ensembles in phase space .",
    "its pure state case is the conventional quantum mechanics , however , with a definite ordering rule accompanying it .",
    "2 ) it can be transformed to other phase space formalisms , including to that of wigner , by suitable unitary or similarity transformations on @xmath53 .",
    "the latter in turn originates from suitable canonical transformations from one extended phase space coordinates to another .      to begin with",
    ", @xmath58 is of the form @xmath59 the exponential factor is a consequence of the total time derivative , @xmath60 in eq ( [ eq3 ] ) .",

    "thus , one obtains the superposition of the separable solutions @xmath63 where @xmath64 to each @xmath65 there corresponds a @xmath66 that are fourier transforms of each other , @xmath67 where n is the number of degrees of freedom of the system .",
    "let @xmath68 be an observable represented by a real polynomial or series in @xmath2 .",
    "its matrix representation , @xmath69 , in either @xmath58- , @xmath70- , or @xmath71-basis is hermitian .",
    "thus @xmath72 where we have used the fact that @xmath70 and @xmath71 bases are the fourier transforms of each other .",
    "the coefficient @xmath73 is suppressed for brevity .",

    "this gives the freedom of choosing @xmath78 and of simplifying eq ( [ eq13 ] ) to read @xmath79tr@xmath80 .",
    "choosing @xmath81 , imposes the further restriction tr@xmath82 . requiring the averages of all positive definite functions of @xmath2 to be positive still restricts @xmath76 to be a positive definite matrix",
    ". had one chosen a differentiable function @xmath83 instead of @xmath68 , one still would have arrived at the same requirements for @xmath76 . to summarize , @xmath58 of eq ( [ eq18 ] ) is a physically acceptable solution if @xmath84 with this provision the averaging rule of eq ( [ eq13 ] ) for @xmath85 reduces to @xmath86 for a product @xmath87 , by the prescription of eq ( [ eq13 ] ) and with the restrictions of eq ( [ eq24 ] ) on @xmath76 , one has    @xmath88,\\label{eq26}\\ ] ]    where @xmath69 and @xmath89 are the matrix representations of @xmath68 and @xmath83 as in eq ( [ eq22 ] ) .",

    "it has emerged from the formalism itself , unlike the ad hoc ordering rules of the conventional quantum mechanics .",
    "it was stated earlier that the proposed dynamics is essentially that of the ensembles . here",
    "we elaborate on this , and show that 1)the classical limit of the theory is liouville s equation that governs the dynamics of classical ensembles .",
    "2 ) its pure state case is schrdinger s operator based theory .",
    "3 ) in its full generality the theory gives von neumann s density matrix and the evolution equation associated with it .      in eq ( [ eq12 ] ) expanding the hamiltonian operators about @xmath0 , and retaining only the first terms in the expansion , gives @xmath91 this is the liouville equation for the distribution function of classical ensembles .",

    "the two trajectories may represent the same state of motion if they satisfy the conditions of initial canonical conjugacy narrated below eqs ( 4 ) .",
    "otherwise , they remain independent and evolve independently .",
    "it is this classical notion of independence that we have carried through to the quantum formalism .",
    "let us also note that the reduction of the phase space evolution equation to the classical liouville s equation is a common feature of all such formalisms .",

    "the ordering rule of eq ( [ eq33 ] ) is , however , the added feature of the theory .",
    "all machinery of the canonical transformations from one extended coordinate system to another and their associated unitary or similarity transformations in the function space are available for a forage of deliberations . except for a passing remark on the prospects of fuller uses of this approach at the end of this section , here we confine ourselves to one one - parameter family of transformations of which wigner s state function emerges as a special case .",

    "<S> conventional approach to quantum mechanics in phase space , @xmath0 , is to take the operator based quantum mechanics of schrdinger , or and equivalent , and assign a @xmath1-number function in phase space to it . </S>",
    "<S> we propose to begin with a higher level of abstraction , in which the independence and the symmetric role of @xmath2 and @xmath3 is maintained throughout , and at once arrive at phase space state functions . upon reduction to the @xmath2- or @xmath3-space the proposed formalism gives the conventional quantum mechanics , however , with a definite rule for ordering of factors of non commuting observables . </S>",
    "<S> further conceptual and practical merits of the formalism are demonstrated throughout the text . </S>"
