    "( snr ) is an important index for wireless communication systems . in wireless communication systems , it is the most significant to achieve high capacity @xcite . in general , it is necessary and sufficient for achieving high capacity to increase snr under the condition that the width of the frequency band is constant @xcite .",
    "similary , the performance of wireless communication is evaluated in bit error rate ( ber ) .",
    "however , these two are not independent , and it is known that ber decreases as snr increases .    as a wireless communication system ,",
    "we focus on a code division multiple access ( cdma ) system @xcite , in particular , an asynchronous cdma system .",
    "it is one of the multiple access systems with which many people can communicate each other at the same time @xcite . in cdma systems , spreading sequences are utilized as codes to multiplex . each user is assigned a different code and uses it to modulate and demodulate his signal .    in cdma systems ,",
    "many methods have been proposed to increase snr .",
    "the one of such methods is based on the blind multiuser detection @xcite . on the other hand , improving the receiver @xcite with the application of digital implementation of ica @xcite and maximum likelihood ( ml ) estimation @xcite are also efficient .",
    "however , in particularly , ml estimation method needs a large amount of calculations . on the contrary , to increase snr",
    ", the representative approach is to improve spreading sequences .",
    "the current spreading sequence of 3 g cdma systems is the gold code @xcite .",
    "it is known that the gold code is optimal in all the binary spreading sequences as well as the kasami sequence @xcite . to explore a better sequence , in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the use of chaotic spreading sequences has been proposed .",
    "these chaotic spreading sequences are multivalued sequences , not binary ones , and are obtained from chaotic maps .",
    "examples of such spreading sequences have been given in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "however , the spreading sequences whose snr is maximum in all the spreading sequences are not yet obtained . in @xcite , the approach to obtain the capacity of spreading sequences has been proposed .",
    "however , the sequence achieving maximal capacity has not been suggested .    to achieve the maximal capacity",
    ", we have to derive the practical spreading sequences whose interference noise is minimal . in general , crosscorrelation is treated as a basic component of interference noise , and autocorrelation is related to synchronization at the receiver side and the fading noise .",
    "thus , it is desirable that the first peak of crosscorrelation and the second peak in autocorrelation should be kept low .",
    "however , sarwate @xcite has shown that there is an avoidable limitation trade - off as a relation between lowering crosscorrelation s peak and autocorrelation s second peak . from this result , it is impossible that both of the peaks of crosscorrelation and autocorrelation are zero .",
    "welch @xcite shows that the maximum value of crosscorrelation has a universal lower bound . from this result , it is impossible that the maximum value of crosscorrelation is zero in some situations . therefore , it is not straightforward to derive practical spreading sequences whose snr is high .    in @xcite , sarwate has shown two kinds of characterized sequences on his limitation .",
    "one kind is a set of sequences whose periodic crosscorrelation is always zero .",
    "we call them sarwate sequences .",
    "the other kind is a set of sequences whose periodic autocorrelation is always zero except for only one point , that is , frank - zadoff - chu ( fzc ) sequences @xcite @xcite . in @xcite , the extended set of the fzc sequences ,",
    "the fzc sequence families are proposed .",
    "they have three parameters and their snr , autocorrelation and crosscorrelation has been investigated .    in this paper",

    "this class belongs to the extended fzc sequence families and includes the sarwate sequences .",
    "the sequence in the weyl sequence class has a desired property that the order of crosscorrelation is low .",
    "we evaluate the upper bound of crosscorrelation and construct the optimization problem : minimize the upper bound of crosscorrelation . from the problem ,",
    "we derive optimal spreading sequences in the weyl sequence class .",
    "we show snr of them in a special case and compare them with other sequences in bit error rate .",
    "in this section , we define the weyl sequence class and show their properties . let @xmath0 be the length of spreading sequences .",
    "we define the weyl sequence @xmath1 as the following formula @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are real parameters . from the above definition",
    ", we can assume that the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 satisfy @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the sequences whose @xmath3 is an irrational number are used in a quasi - monte carlo method @xcite .",
    "we apply this sequence to a spreading sequence .",

    "the value of @xmath11 has no effects to signal to noise ratio ( snr ) since @xmath12 is united to the phase term of the signal .",
    "thus , we set @xmath13 .",
