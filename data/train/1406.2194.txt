    "5(a ) the low-@xmath6 specific heat data .",
    "a large and sharp peak is observed at 4.1 k , which is related to the nel transition of dy@xmath10 spins .",
    "it can be seen that the magnetic contributions to the specific heat are important only at very low temperatures and are likely to be negligible above @xmath62 12 k , where the specific heat data show a minimum .",

    "it is known that in the temperature range 0.02 @xmath63 0.1 ( @xmath64 is the debye temperature ) , the phonon specific heat follows a low - frequency expansion of the debye function , @xmath65 , where @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 are temperature - independent coefficients.@xcite it is found that this formula fits well to the experimental data at @xmath32 15 k , as shown in fig .",

    "note that the y@xmath10 ions are nonmagnetic and there is only af order of fe@xmath10 ions .",
    "yfeo@xmath3 actually shows a simple and pure phonon heat transport phenomenon at low temperatures : ( i ) the @xmath75 curve exhibits a very large peak at about 20 k , with the peak value of 520 w / km , indicating a very high quality of the single crystal ; ( ii ) the temperature dependence of @xmath0 is roughly @xmath59 at subkelvin temperatures , which is close to the @xmath76 boundary scattering limit of phonons.@xcite the dyfeo@xmath3 data are rather comparable to those of yfeo@xmath3 , except for two notable differences . at first , the @xmath0 of dyfeo@xmath3 is smaller at high temperatures , although a phonon peak of 330 w / km is also exceptionally larger for transition - metal oxides .",
    "more remarkably , there is a clear concave structure in the @xmath75 curve in the temperature regime of 0.33 k. a similar result has been found in another orthoferrite gdfeo@xmath3.@xcite it is clear that at @xmath77 , the magnon excitations from the dy@xmath10 spin system can have a significant scattering on phonons , which results in a downward deviation from the @xmath59 behavior .",
    "however , with lowering temperature further , the @xmath0 recovers to the @xmath59 dependence at @xmath34 300 mk .",
    "this means that the magnon scattering effect is gradually smeared out .",
    "apparently , the magnon spectra has a finite energy gap ( for example , originated from the spin anisotropy ) , which prevents the low - energy magnons from being thermally excited at very low temperatures .",
    "it is possible to estimate the mean free path of phonons at low temperatures and to judge whether the phonons are free from microscopic scattering at subkelvin temperatures .",
    "the phononic thermal conductivity can be expressed by the kinetic formula @xmath78,@xcite where @xmath79 is the phonon specific heat at low temperatures , @xmath80 is the average velocity and @xmath60 is the mean free path of phonons .",
    "using the @xmath66 value obtained from the above specific - heat data , the phonon velocity can be calculated and then the mean free path is obtained from the @xmath0.@xcite the inset to fig .",
    "5(b ) shows the ratio between @xmath60 and the averaged sample width @xmath81 = 0.335 mm,@xcite where @xmath82 is the area of cross section .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath83 increases with lowering temperature and becomes larger than one at lowest temperatures , which indicates that all the microscopic phonon scatterings ( including magnon scattering ) are negligible and the boundary scattering limit is established.@xcite        the field dependence of thermal conductivity after zfc is measured down to 92 mk and the results are presented in fig .",
    "6 . with decreasing temperature , @xmath0 exhibits complicated field dependence : ( i ) with @xmath84 2 k",
    ", @xmath8 is reversible and shows a sharp decrease at @xmath45 ; ( ii ) with 0.7 k @xmath85 2 k , @xmath8 shows an analogous irreversible behaviors to those of @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "there are two maximums in the field - up process and only the high - field one is kept when decreasing field , resulting in a larger @xmath0 in the field - down process at low fields ; ( iii ) when temperature is further decreased down to below 500 mk , @xmath8 exhibits a different irreversible behavior ; that is , there is only one dip in the sweeping - field run with a higher location in the field - up process .",
    "one notable feature is that the @xmath0 in the field - up process becomes larger than that in the field - down process , which is opposite to the case above 500 mk .",
    "it has been known from many previous studies on the antiferromagnetic materials that the thermal conductivity could exhibit drastic changes at the magnetic phase transitions or the spin re - orientations.@xcite the mechanisms are mostly due to the sudden changes in the population of the magnetic excitations , which can effectively scatter phonons.@xcite in some rare case , the magnons well populated at the spin - flop transition can also contribute to the heat transport by acting as heat carriers.@xcite in present work , the anomalies of the @xmath8 curves can be apparently attributed to the transitions of magnetic structures of dyfeo@xmath3 , which is also a common phenomenon to gdfeo@xmath3,@xcite .",
    "however , the hysteresis of @xmath8 are rather different between these two materials .      considering the above experimental results , one can find a common feature for the zfc @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath8 data ,",
    "that is , an irreversible behavior is observed only in the first field - up process , and it disappears in the following sweeping - field process .",
    "one possible reason for the observed irreversibility is the multi - domain effect in the multiferroic materials.@xcite since the crystal is cooled in zero field without me poling , at zero and low fields , the macroscopic polarization might be zero due to the compensation among different electric domains . with increasing field , the sample gradually changes into a fewer - domain state and the finite magnitude of @xmath2 appears , which could be accompanied with some change in the @xmath30 curve .",
    "however , from our results at @xmath86 2 k , the @xmath31 and @xmath30 curves are reversible in the subsequent sweeping - field process except for the first one .",
    "this is obviously different from the case of the @xmath31/@xmath30 loop in usual ferroelectric / ferromagnetic materials , in which the loop always exists due to the presence of domains . on the other hand ,",
    "if the domain effect is the major reason for the observed irreversibility , the phonon scattering by the domain walls should be effective in the whole low-@xmath6 range . in the case of gdfeo@xmath3,@xcite when the crystal is cooled in zero field , the field - up @xmath2 is larger than that in the field - down run , which indicates that there are less ferroelectric domains with increasing field .",
    "the larger @xmath8 in the field - up process can be attributed to the weak phonon scattering by the domain walls.@xcite similar to the case of gdfeo@xmath3 , the @xmath8 at @xmath32 500 mk behaves consistently with the @xmath30 and @xmath31 curves in dyfeo@xmath3 ; that is , the me domain walls are likely playing a role in scattering phonons . however , upon further cooling ( @xmath87 300 mk ) the @xmath0 in the field - up process becomes larger than that in the field - down process , which can not be explained by the domain wall scattering on phonons . in a word , although the multi - domain effect could have influence on the magnitudes of @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath8 , when the crystal is cooled without me poling , it seems to be not the dominant factor for the observed irreversible behaviors .",
    "the second possible reason for the step - like increase of @xmath2 and the consistent low - field irreversibility shown by @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath8 is the presence of an unknown zero - field magnetic structure below @xmath50 after zfc , which is metastable in the field and disappears when the field is swept down . actually , it is a rather common feature of multiferroic materials that a metastable spin configuration is formed in zfc process while another spin structure is stabilized after me cooling .",
    "a recent example is the field - induced metastable phase in hexaferrites , observed by a neutron scattering.@xcite this scenario can easily explain the @xmath31 and @xmath30 behaviors . due to the strong out - of - plane anisotropy of dy@xmath10 spins ,",
    "the applied field along the @xmath18 axis could not change their spin arrangements directly , as the magnetization in fig .",
    "1(c ) indicated .",
    "most likely , only the change of fe@xmath10 spin structure is involved .",
    "therefore , the zero - field structure of fe@xmath10 at @xmath28 should be different from the known fe@xmath21 at @xmath88 and is hereafter named as fe@xmath89 .",
    "it is also notable that the repeatable irreversibility begins to appear with @xmath28 and becomes unrepeatable with @xmath57 2 k , the transition from fe@xmath21 to fe@xmath89 is therefore a gradual process between @xmath23 and 2 k. another notable feature is that the transition from fe@xmath21 to fe@xmath16 at @xmath90 could cause a sharp increase of @xmath1 . due to the presence of irreversibility",
    ", this feature gradually vanishes at @xmath91 ; instead , two successive magnetic transitions are present , and the higher - field one is from fe@xmath21 to fe@xmath16 , which is the same as the case at high temperatures .    based on the above discussions and experimental data of @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath8 , a low temperature @xmath9 phase diagram with @xmath4 and in the case of zfc is constructed , as shown in fig . 7 .",
    "we propose that besides the known fe@xmath92 and fe@xmath21 , the phase diagram involves another magnetic phase , fe@xmath89 .",
    "the most important feature is that the fe@xmath10 spins undergo successive transitions : fe@xmath93 fe@xmath94 fe@xmath16 with increasing field and at 500 mk @xmath95 , and only the transition from fe@xmath96 fe@xmath21 is present when the field is decreased , which is consistent with the fc results .",
    "it is known that there are four fe@xmath10 spin configurations that could produce linear me response , i.e. , @xmath15 ( fe@xmath16 ) , @xmath20 ( fe@xmath21 ) , @xmath97 , and @xmath98.@xcite since the crystal is cooled without me poling , it is in principal difficult to judge from the electric polarization whether there is spontaneous @xmath2 or not in zero field , and accordingly to judge the definite magnetic structure of fe@xmath89 .",
    "this is because that the sample after zfc could be in a multi - domain phase with spontaneous polarization , even though the measured @xmath2 is zero .",
    "however , since the low-@xmath6 @xmath31 loops actually behave rather differently from the usual @xmath31 hysteresis curves , some kind of magnetic - structure transition other than the multi - domain effect may play a more important role",
    ". nevertheless , we have to leave the definition of the fe@xmath89 magnetic structure as an open question , and further investigations like neutron scattering studies on single crystals are called for .",

    "the transition from fe@xmath21 to fe@xmath89 is actually a gradual change , as a continuous change of color indicates . above 500 mk",
    ", fe@xmath89 is a metastable state ; that is , it exits when sweeping - up field to the boundary indicated by the dashed line but does not appear when sweeping - down field .",

    "1(c ) ) , are also shown.,width=283 ]    this phase diagram could explain the behavior of @xmath8 down to the lowest temperature .",
    "( i ) with @xmath88 , when the field is applied , the fe@xmath10 spin structure changes from fe@xmath21 to fe@xmath16 .",
    "accordingly , a sharp decrease of @xmath0 is observed , due to the phonon scattering by the magnetic excitations.@xcite ( ii ) with @xmath57 2 k , the applied field could induce successive transitions from fe@xmath89 to fe@xmath21 and then to fe@xmath16 in the field - up process , and @xmath8 shows two local maximums due to the weakened scattering of phonons across each transition .",
    "the transition from fe@xmath21 to fe@xmath89 is absent when the field is decreased , resulting in a larger @xmath0 below @xmath43 .",
    "( iii ) with further cooling , @xmath43 becomes larger and there is only a first - order transition from fe@xmath89 to fe@xmath16 directly with @xmath34 500 mk , which results in a different field dependence of @xmath0 .",
    "it should be noted that below 500 mk the fe@xmath89 state is always present in the sweeping - field process .",
    "this indicates that the fe@xmath89 state , which is metastable in sweeping magnetic field above 500 mk , becomes stable at @xmath34 500 mk .",
    "in passing , it should be pointed out that , besides the magnon excitations , the paramagnetic spins could also have influence on the phonon thermal conductivity.@xcite due to the paramagnetic scattering effect , @xmath8 usually shows a dip - like behavior . from figs .",
    "6(e - j ) , the dip around 1 t may be ascribed to the paramagnetic scattering on phonons .",
    "the complicated field dependencies at low fields between 0.97 k and 300 mk could be regarded as a superposition of magnon scattering at @xmath99 on the recovery of @xmath0 due to the paramagnetic scattering , as indicated by the shoulder - like feature around 2 t for both field - up and field - down processes .",
    "our detailed results of magnetization , electric polarization , and thermal conductivity point to a complex magnetic phase diagram of dyfeo@xmath3 involving successive field - induced magnetic phase transitions of fe@xmath10 spins .",
    "first , the unknown ground state at ultra - low temperatures ( fe@xmath89 ) is likely to have no linear me effect .",
    "apparently , this ground state is determined by the interaction between dy@xmath10 and fe@xmath10 spins .",
    "in particular , when the dy@xmath10 sublattice orders antiferromagnetically at @xmath23 , the fe@xmath10 spins have to change their orientation .",
    "second , with 500 mk @xmath5 2 k , a low - field irreversibility of the magnetic transitions is observed when the sample is cooled in zero field , which indicates that fe@xmath89 structure is metastable with sweeping magnetic field .",
    "a similar irreversible behavior is probably the one found in another orthoferrite tbfeo@xmath3 , probed by the capacitance measurement,@xcite in which an unknown low - field phase also disappeared with sweeping - down field .",
    "it seems that only at very low temperatures ( @xmath100 500 mk ) , the interaction between dy@xmath10 and fe@xmath10 spins is strong enough to stabilize the fe@xmath89 structure .",
    "the further studies of these materials and probably other members of orthoferrite @xmath11feo@xmath3 could help to explore their complicated low-@xmath6 magnetic structures and related interesting me effect .",
