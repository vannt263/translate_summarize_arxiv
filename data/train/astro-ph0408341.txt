    "we note that , despite the lee - weinberg bound @xcite , dark matter can consist of particles lighter than 1 gev @xcite .    in this article",
    "we show that annihilations of simps can generate significant amounts of heat inside planets .",
    "obviously , the heat production due to annihilations inside the planet has to be smaller than the total internal heat production .",

    "this means that @xmath4 needs to be larger than about @xmath5 @xmath6 for simps to generate a significant amount of heat inside large planets such as uranus .",
    "we can crudely estimate an upper bound on the heat production , @xmath7 , by assuming that the entire dark matter flux is transferred into heat . assuming a relic dark matter density of 0.3 gev/@xmath8 and a typical velocity of 270 km / s of a dark matter particle w.r.t .",

    ", we have to take into account that , because of the mass mismatch with nuclei , simps need many collisions to lose enough energy to become captured inside a planet . for low mass simps",
    "this means that a significant part of the incident flux of simps will end up being reflected back into space .",
    "also , if the annihilation cross section is low enough , most simps will eventually evaporate rather than annihilate .",
    "the evaporation rate depends not only on the mass of the simps but also on the elastic cross section .",
    "particles escaping from the gravity of a planet typically escape from one scattering length below the surface .",
    "particles with lower elastic cross sections will thus escape from deeper below the surface , where it is hotter .",
    "this means that these particles will have higher escape rates .",
    "we will use a detailed model of uranus s interior to take these effects into account for simps lighter than 1 gev interacting with spin independent interactions with nuclei .",
    "upper limits on the s - wave annihilation cross section will be derived as a function of the mass and the elastic cross section on protons .",

    "we fit these results to an approximate expression obtained by treating this problem in the continuum limit , where it becomes a diffusion problem .",
    "we find that the capture rate , denoted as @xmath19 , is : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the halo number density of simps , @xmath22 is the escape velocity from the planet and @xmath23 is the probability that a simp moving into the planet with speed @xmath24 is captured : @xmath25}^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\sqrt{\\frac{m_{\\text{simp}}}{m_{\\text{eff}}}}.\\ ] ] here @xmath26 is an effective nucleon mass , defined as : @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes the mass of a nucleus of type @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the relative probability that a simp will scatter off a nucleus of this type .",

    "next we will evaluate the probability that a simp at some distance below the surface will remain below the surface after @xmath107 scatterings . as long as @xmath112",
    ", we can treat this problem as a random walk in a half infinite space with absorbing boundary conditions .",

    "[ rvcp ] predicts a captured flux that is about a factor of 2 too low .",
    "the likely source of this difference is the improper use of the method of images to impose absorbing boundary conditions . changing the prefactor of @xmath144 to @xmath145 gives an almost perfect fit to the captured fraction of the flux in the mass range 2 gev-10 gev . for earth , @xmath146 gev , about ten times as high as for uranus .",
