    "relaxation ( dissipation and decoherence ) is a characteristic feature of open quantum systems . in practice",

    "recent work in optimal control of spin dynamics in the presence of relaxation has shown that these losses can be significantly reduced by exploiting the structure of relaxation @xcite .",
    "this has resulted in significant improvement in sensitivity of many well established experiments in high resolution nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) spectroscopy . in particular , by use of optimal control methods , analytical bounds have been achieved on the maximum polarization or coherence that can be transferred between coupled spins in the presence of very general decoherence mechanisms . in this paper , we look at the more general problem of transfer of coherence or polarization between distant spins on an ising spin chain in the presence of relaxation .",
    "this problem is ubiquitous in multi - dimensional nmr spectroscopy , where polarization is transferred between distant spins on a chain of coupled spins .",
    "spin ( or pseudo spin ) chains also appear in many proposed quantum information processing architectures @xcite .",
    "the system that we study in this paper is a linear chain of @xmath0 weakly interacting spins @xmath1 placed in a static external magnetic field in the @xmath2 direction ( nmr experimental setup ) , with ising type couplings of equal strength between nearest neighbors , see fig .",
    "[ fig : chain ] .",
    "the free evolution hamiltonian of the system has the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the larmor frequency of spin @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the strength of the coupling between the spins . in a suitably chosen ( multiple ) rotating frame , which rotates with each spin at its resonance ( larmor ) frequency ,",
    "the free evolution hamiltonian simplifies to @xmath7    motivated by nmr spectroscopy of large molecules in solution , we assume that the relaxation rates of the longitudinal operators with components only in the @xmath2 direction , like @xmath8 , @xmath9 is negligible compared with relaxation rates for transverse operators like @xmath10 , @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the transverse relaxation is modeled by the lindbladian with the general form @xcite @xmath12 + \\sum_{i , j}\\pi b_{ij } [ 2i_{iz}i_{jz}[2i_{iz}i_{jz } , \\rho]]\\;.\\ ] ] in liquid state nmr spectroscopy , the two terms of the lindblad operator model the relaxation mechanism caused by chemical shift anisotropy and dipole - dipole interaction respectively @xcite . here",
    "we neglect any interference effects between these two relaxation mechanisms @xcite .",
    "relaxation rates @xmath13 depend on various physical parameters , such as the gyromagnetic ratios of the spins , the internuclear distance , the correlation time of molecular tumbling etc .",
    "we define the net transverse relaxation rate for spin @xmath5 as @xcite @xmath14 . without loss of generality in the subsequent analysis , we assume that @xmath15 are equal and we denote this common transverse relaxation rate by @xmath16 .",

    "consider now the problem of optimizing the polarization transfer @xmath21 along the linear spin chain shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chain ] , in the presence of the relaxation mechanisms mentioned above .",
    "this problem can be stated as follows : find the optimal transverse rf magnetic field in the control hamiltonian @xmath20 such that starting from @xmath22 and evolving under eq .",

    ", the initial state of the system @xmath26 evolves through the following stages @xmath27 in the first stage of the transfer , @xmath28 , spin @xmath29 is decoupled from the chain using standard decoupling methods @xcite and the initial polarization @xmath26 on spin @xmath30 is rotated by rf field ( an appropriate @xmath31 pulse ) to coherence @xmath32 , which then evolves under coupling hamiltonian @xmath33 to @xmath34 .",
    "when the expectation value @xmath35 is maximized , another @xmath31 pulse is used to rotate @xmath34 to @xmath33 .",

    "[ fig : zzlevels ] shows the population inversion corresponding to this transfer . by a suitable @xmath31 rotation of spin 2 , the density operator @xmath33 is transformed to @xmath37 , which then evolves to @xmath38 .",
    "when the expectation value @xmath39 is maximized , another @xmath31 pulse is used to rotate @xmath38 to the spin order @xmath40 .",
    "this is the concatenated inept ( cinept ) pulse sequence . the final stage transfer , @xmath41 , is similar to that in the first stage and is accomplished by the inept pulse sequence . the efficiency of these transfers is limited by the decay of transverse operators , due to the phenomenon of relaxation .",

    "( [ eq : convinept ] ) can be significantly improved by controlling precisely the way in which magnetization is transferred from longitudinal operators to transverse operators . in other words , instead of using @xmath31 ( hard ) pulses to rotate longitudinal to transverse operators ( and the inverse ) , we can exploit the fact that longitudinal operators are long lived by making these rotations gradually , saving this way magnetization .",
    "this transfer strategy is called relaxation optimized pulse element ( rope ) .    in this article",
    "we derive relaxation optimized pulse sequences for the intermediate transfer ( the cinept stage ) , @xmath45 this relaxation optimized transfer of spin order can then be used as a building block for the polarization transfer ( [ transfer ] ) through the scheme @xmath46",
    "in this section , we formulate the problem of transfer in eq .",
    "( [ transfer2 ] ) as a problem of optimal control and derive an upper bound on the transfer efficiency . to simplify notation , we introduce the following symbols for the expectation values of operators that play a part in the transfer .",

    "is transferred to @xmath63 by application of a @xmath64 pulse on spin 2 .",

    "this is maximized for @xmath68 . at @xmath69",
    "a second @xmath64 pulse is applied on spin 2 , rotating the maximum value from @xmath66 to @xmath70 .",
    "this value is the efficiency @xmath71 of the conventional method @xmath72    a better efficiency can be achieved if we store magnetization in the decoherence free longitudinal operators @xmath73 while the system is evolving .",
    "this is done by rotating @xmath73 to @xmath74 gradually , instead of using @xmath31 hard pulses .",
    "this is the physical concept behind the relaxation optimized transfer strategy . for the specific transfer examined in this article",
    ", we first find an upper bound for the maximum efficiency and in the next section we calculate numerically the magnetic field @xmath75 that approaches this bound .    in order to derive the upper bound , we use an augmented system instead of the original one ( [ eq : path ] ) .",
    "the augmentation is done in two steps .",
    "first , we suppose that we can rotate @xmath62 to @xmath63 and @xmath66 to @xmath70 independently using two different controls , say @xmath76 and @xmath77 , instead of the common control @xmath75 .",
    "next , we provide @xmath65 with a relaxation free partner @xmath78 and with a control @xmath79 which can rotate @xmath65 to @xmath78 .",
    "the augmented system is @xmath80 = \\left[\\begin{array}{cccccc } 0 & 0 & 0 & -\\omega_1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -\\omega_2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -\\omega_3 \\\\ \\omega_1 & 0 & 0 & -\\xi & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\omega_2 & 0 & 1 & -\\xi & -1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\omega_3 & 0 & 1 & -\\xi \\end{array}\\right ] \\left[\\begin{array}{cccccc } z_1\\\\z_2\\\\z_3\\\\x_1\\\\y_2\\\\x_3\\end{array}\\right]\\;.\\ ] ] observe that system ( [ eq : augmented ] ) reduces to system ( [ eq : path ] ) for @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
