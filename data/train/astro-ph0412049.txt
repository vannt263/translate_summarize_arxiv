    "this can be traced directly to the results shown in figure  [ fig : mserr ] .",
    "the slightly greater overestimation in stellar masses at the high mass end for the @xmath26-band estimates is sufficient to account for this difference .",
    "a steeper trend is seen in the @xmath35-inferred stellar mass - to - light ratio than in the @xmath26-band one .",
    "this is because for the less luminous groups , the @xmath35 measurements include groups with no galaxies that are detected in the near infra - red , and these groups preferentially have their stellar masses underestimated , thus dragging down the median @xmath35-inferred stellar mass - to - light ratios .",
    "very similar trends are apparent in the real 2pigg data , with a small offset to lower mass - to - light ratios relative to the mock . for the largest 2piggs , the stellar mass - to - light ratio is @xmath66 .",

    "this value was derived from dynamical data coupled to a maximum stellar mass model , so it represents an upper limit on the stellar mass - to - light ratio .",
    "alternatively , if the kennicutt imf were changed to one producing more stellar mass at a given luminosity ( for instance the ` diet ' salpeter imf of bell & de jong 2001 ) , then the stellar mass - to - light ratio found here could be increased substantially to agree with that assumed by lms03 .",

    "this trend of increasing stellar mass fraction with decreasing group size is apparent in both the model and the mock catalogue .",

    "it should be noted that this work only considers stars that are associated with galaxies , ignoring any population of intergalactic stars . in large galaxy clusters , a few tens of per cent of the total cluster stellar mass may reside in intergalactic stars ( zibetti & white 2004 ; lin & mohr 2004 ) .",
    "however , only a small fraction of all stars reside in such large clusters , as will be shown .",
    "to determine the fraction of stars in groups of a given luminosity , a trivariate swml method has been used . by choosing group luminosity to describe the group size , rather than mass ,",
    "it is possible to use groups containing only a single galaxy .",
    "these contribute a significant fraction of the galaxies , and hence stellar mass , and are thus crucial in forming a full picture of where all of the stars reside .",
    "the trivariate swml method extends the method used in the previous sections by adding an extra variable , namely the luminosity of the group in which any particular galaxy exists . following the nomenclature of loveday ( 2000 ) ,",
    "the space density of galaxies , @xmath83 , with luminosity @xmath84 , stellar mass @xmath85 and residing in a group with total @xmath4 luminosity @xmath86 , can be used to write the probability of galaxy i taking particular values as @xmath87 the lower integration limit for the group total @xmath4 luminosity takes account of the fraction of group luminosity that lies in galaxies beneath the flux limit of the 2dfgrs , assuming that group galaxies follow the schechter function determined by norberg ( 2002 ) for the entire population ( as was done by eke 2004b when defining group luminosity ) .",
    "the galaxy luminosity and stellar mass variables are either @xmath4-band luminosity and @xmath35-band stellar mass or @xmath26-band luminosity and stellar mass . as shown by the integration limits , all stellar masses are accessible at any given galaxy luminosity  this was also assumed for the bivariate case earlier .",

    "the trivariate function can be projected to recover the galaxy luminosity function or the stellar mass function , for example .",
    "however , by projecting along the individual galaxy luminosity and stellar mass directions , the distribution of stars among groups of different luminosity can be retrieved .",
    "[ fig : trivmod ] shows both the differential and cumulative distributions of stellar mass among different sized groups .",
    "while the distributions recovered from the mock catalogue are quite similar to that present in the model , there is a trend in the mock of placing a higher fraction of the stars in larger groups as the upper redshift of the sample is increased .",
    "this is particularly apparent for the @xmath35-band results , because the mock @xmath26-band sample is also restricted by the relatively high 2mass flux limit . for the @xmath98 samples",
    ", a lack of large local clusters in the mock catalogue means that the results significantly underestimate the fraction of all stars in groups with @xmath99 . as the upper redshift limit is increased , the volume encloses a fairer sample of the mock universe .",

    "furthermore , the mock galaxy catalogues that have been employed , allow a careful quantification of the systematic errors associated with estimating stellar masses .",

    "removing the systematic errors inherent in this determination reduces the cluster value to @xmath114 .",
    "the opposite trend is found for the stellar mass fraction , with larger groups having smaller values .",
    "taking into account the systematic error in the recovery gives a typical stellar mass fraction of @xmath115 for the richest clusters .",
    "finally , a trivariate stepwise maximum likelihood method is employed to partition , into groups of different size , the stellar mass that resides in galaxies in the local universe .",

    "<S> the three main conclusions are : + ( 1 ) a slowly rising stellar mass - to-@xmath2 band light ratio is found with the clusters having the largest value of @xmath9 , + ( 2 ) in contrast , the fraction of mass in stars decreases with increasing group size , reaching @xmath10 for the rich clusters , and + ( 3 ) in answer to the question posed in the title , most stellar mass is contained in local group - sized objects ( @xmath11 ) with only @xmath12 per cent in clusters with @xmath13 .    </S>",
