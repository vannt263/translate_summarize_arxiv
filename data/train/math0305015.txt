    "-5 mm    the simulation of not only the physiological functioning of the blood circulatory system , but also of specific pathological circumstances is of utmost importance since cardiovascular diseases represent the leading cause of death in developed countries , with a tremendous medical , social and economic impact .    in the cardiovascular system , altered flow conditions , such as flow separation , flow reversal , low and oscillatory shear stress areas , are recognised as important factors in the development of arterial diseases . a detailed understanding of the local haemodynamics , the effect of vascular wall modification on flow patterns and its long - term adaptation to surgical procedures can have useful clinical applications .",
    "some of these phenomena are not well understood , making it difficult to foresee short and long term evolution of the disease and the planning of the therapeutic approach . in this context",
    ", the mathematical models and numerical simulations can play a crucial role .",
    "blood flow interacts both mechanically and chemically with the vessel walls .",
    "the mechanical coupling requires algorithms that correctly describe the energy transfer between the fluid ( typically modelled by the navier - stokes equations ) and the structure of the vessel wall . on the other hand ,",
    "the flow equations can be coupled with appropriate models that describe the wall absorption of bio - chemicals ( e.g.  oxygen , lipids , drugs , etc . ) and of their transport , diffusion and kinetics .",
    "numerical simulations of this type may help to understand the modifications in bio - chemical exchanges due to an alteration of the flow field caused , for instance , by a stenosis ( i.e.a localised narrowing of a vessel lumen , normally due to fat accumulation ) .",
    "the simulation of large and medium - size arteries is now sufficiently advanced so to envisage the applications of computer models to medical research and , in a medium range , to everyday medical practise .",
    "for instance , simulating the flow in a coronary by - pass may help understanding the extent at which its geometry influences the flow and in turn the post - surgery evolution .",
    "also the study of the effects of a vascular prosthesis as well as the study of artificial valve implants are areas which could benefit from a sufficiently accurate simulation of blood flow field .",
    "in this paper we review the principal mathematical steps behind the derivation of the coupled fluid - structure equations which model the blood flow motion in large and medium - sized arteries .",
    "then we mention the way geometrical multiscale models , that combine mathematical models set up in different spatial dimensions , can be conveniently used to simulate the whole circulatory system .",
    "-5 mm    [ s : ale ]    in this section we will treat the situation arising when the flow in a vessel interacts mechanically with the wall structure .",
    "this aspect is particularly relevant for blood flow in large arteries , where the vessel wall radius may vary up to 10because of the forces exerted by the flowing blood stream .",
    "we will first illustrate a framework for the navier - stokes equations in a moving domain which is particularly convenient for the analysis and for the set up of numerical solution methods .",
    "-5 mm    navier - stokes equations are usually derived according to the _ eulerian _ approach where the independent spatial variables are the coordinates of a fixed eulerian system .",
    "when considering the flow inside a portion of a compliant artery , we have to compute the flow solution in a _ computational domain _ @xmath0 varying with time .",
    "is moving .",
    "the location along the @xmath1 axis of @xmath2 and @xmath3 are fixed.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    the boundary of @xmath0 may in general be subdivided into two parts .",
    "the first part coincides with the physical fluid boundary , i.e.  the vessel wall @xmath4 ( see fig .  [",
    "f : computdomain ] ) , which is moving under the effect of the flow field .",
    "the other part of @xmath5 corresponds to artificial boundaries which delimit the region of interest from the remaining part of the cardiovascular system .",
    "the `` artificial '' boundaries are the inlet and outlet ( or , using the medical terminology , the proximal and distal ) sections , here indicated by @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the location of these boundaries is fixed a priori .",
    "more precisely , @xmath2 and @xmath3 may change with time because of the displacement of @xmath4 , however they remain planar and their position along the vessel axis is kept fixed . in this case",
    "the eulerian approach becomes impractical .",
    "a possible alternative would be to use the _ lagrangian approach _",
    ", where we identify the computational domain on a reference configuration @xmath6 , e.g. that at the initial time @xmath7 , and the corresponding domain in the current configuration will be provided by the lagrangian mapping @xmath8 which describes the motion of a material particle and whose time derivative is the fluid velocity .",
    "since the fluid velocity at the wall is equal to the wall velocity , the lagrangian mapping effectively maps @xmath9 to the correct wall position @xmath4 at each time @xmath10 .",
    "however , the artificial boundaries in the reference configuration , say @xmath11 and @xmath12 , will now be transported along the fluid trajectories .",
    "this is unacceptable , particularly for a relatively large time interval as @xmath0 rapidly becomes highly distorted .",
    "a more convenient situation is the one when , even if the wall is moving , one keeps the inlet and outlet boundaries at the same spatial location along the vessel axis . with that purpose , we introduce the _ arbitrary lagrangian eulerian _",
    "( ale ) mapping @xmath13 , which provides the spatial coordinates @xmath14 in terms of the so - called _ ale coordinates _",
    "@xmath15 , with the basic requirement that @xmath16 retrieves , at each time @xmath17 , the desired computational domain , @xmath18 .    the ale mapping should be continuous and bijective in @xmath19 .",
    "once given , we may define the _ domain _ velocity field as @xmath20 where the composition operator applies only to the spatial coordinates .",
    "the ale time derivative of a function @xmath21 , which we denote by @xmath22 , is defined as    @xmath23    this definition is readily extended to vector valued functions .",
    "the ale derivative is related to the eulerian ( partial ) time derivative by the relation    @xmath24    where the gradient is made with respect to the @xmath25-coordinates .",
    "the navier - stokes equations may be formulated in order to put into evidence the ale time derivative , obtaining @xmath26 \\div{\\vel}=0 , \\end{array}\\quad \\text{in } \\ctdomain , \\ , t>0,\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the cauchy stress tensor , which for newtonian fluid is given by @xmath28 , being @xmath29 the blood kinematic viscosity .",
    "when considering small vessels , accounting for non - newtonian behaviour of blood becomes crucial .",
    "in that case the functional dependence of @xmath27 on @xmath30 becomes more complex , see for instance @xcite .",
    "-5 mm    the vascular wall has a very complex nature and devising an accurate model for its mechanical behaviour is rather difficult .",
    "its structure is indeed formed by many layers with different mechanical characteristics @xcite , which are usually in a pre - stressed state . moreover , experimental results obtained by specimens are only partially significant .",
    "indeed , the vascular wall is a living tissue with the presence of muscular cells which contribute to its mechanical behaviour .",
    "it may then be expected that the dead tissue used in the laboratory will have different mechanical characteristics than the living one . moreover , the arterial mechanics depend also on the type of the surrounding tissues , an aspect almost impossible to reproduce in a laboratory .",
    "as we have already pointed out , the displacements can not be considered small ( at least in large arteries where the radius may vary up to a few percent during the systolic phase ) .",
    "consequently , an appropriate model for the structure displacement @xmath31 reads @xmath32 where @xmath33 indicates the current configuration and @xmath34 is the cauchy stress tensor .",
    "the latter may depend on the structure velocity because of viscoelasticity .",
    "a full lagrange formulation for the structure on a fixed reference configuration @xmath35 may be obtained by the usual lagrange and piola transformation ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . a general framework to derive constitutive equations for arterial walls",
    "is reported in @xcite .",
    "it is the role of mathematical modelling to find reasonable simplifying assumptions by which major physical characteristics remain present , yet the problem becomes computationally actractive . in particular , a simpler model may be obtained by considering only displacements in the radial direction and a cylindrical geometry for the vessel .",
    "furthermore if we neglect the geometrical non - linearities ( which correspond to assume small displacements ) , as well as the variations along the radial directions ( small thickness assumption ) we obtain the following `` generalised string model '' @xcite for the evolution of the radial displacement @xmath36 , @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are parameters linked to the vessel geometry and mechanical characteristics , @xmath40 is a viscoelastic parameter and @xmath41 is a forcing term which depends on the action of the fluid , as we will see in ( [ eq : interaction ] ) .",

    "the @xmath1 coordinate is aligned along the vessel axes and a plane @xmath46 defines an _",
    "axial section_.      -5 mm    we now study the properties of the coupled fluid - structure problem , using for the structure the generalised string model ( [ e : generstring ] )",
    ". we will take @xmath47 always to be the outwardly vector normal to the fluid domain boundary .",
    "furthermore we define @xmath48 as the metric function so that the elemental surface measure @xmath49 on @xmath50 is related to the corresponding measure @xmath51 on @xmath42 by @xmath52 .",
    "we will then address the following problem : _ for all @xmath17 , find @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 such that _",

    "the system is complemented by appropriate boundary and initial conditions .",
    "we may then recognise the sources of the coupling between the fluid and the structure models , which are twofold . in view of a possible iterative solution strategy",
    ", the fluid solution provides the value of @xmath41 , which is function of the fluid stresses at the wall . on the other hand ,",
    "the movement of the vessel wall modifies the geometry on which the fluid equations must be solved , besides providing dirichlet boundary conditions for the fluid velocity in correspondence to the vessel wall .",
    "* remark 2.1 .",
    "* we may note that the non - linear convective term in the navier - stokes equations is crucial to obtain the well - posedness of the coupled problem , because it generates a boundary term which compensates that coming from the treatment of the acceleration term .",
    "these two contributions are indeed only present in the case of a moving boundary .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "-5 mm    in this section we describe an algorithm that at each time - level allows the decoupling of the sub - problem related to the fluid from that related to the vessel wall . as usual ,",

    "the numerical solution of the fluid - structure interaction problem ( [ eq : interaction ] ) will be carried out by constructing a proper finite element approximation of each sub - problem .",
    "in particular , for the fluid we need to devise a finite element formulation suitable for moving domains ( or , more precisely , moving grids ) . in this respect",
    ", the ale formulation will provide an appropriate framework .",
    "to better illustrate the situation we refer to fig .",
    "[ fig : twodaxi ] where we have drawn a 2d fluid structure interaction problem ( only the upper portion of the vessel is reported ) .",
    "for the sake of simplicity we have considered only a two - dimensional fluid structure problem , yet the algorithm here presented may be readily extended to more complex situations and three dimensional problems .",

    "the position at time @xmath10 of the discretized vessel wall boundary , corresponding to the discrete displacement field @xmath70 , is indicated by @xmath71 .",
    "consequently , the fluid domain will be represented at every time by a polygon , which we indicate by @xmath72 .",

    "having at disposal the discrete displacement field @xmath77 at @xmath78 and thus the position of the domain boundary @xmath79 , the set up of a map @xmath80 such that @xmath81 is an acceptable finite element mesh for the fluid domain is not a simple task .",
    "however , if we can assume that @xmath72 is convex for all @xmath10 and that the displacements are relatively small , the following technique , known as _ harmonic extension _ , may well serve the purpose .",
    "if @xmath82 indicates the p1 finite element vector space associated to @xmath74 and @xmath83 is the function describing the fluid domain boundary , we build the map by seeking @xmath84 such that @xmath85 and then setting @xmath86 .",
