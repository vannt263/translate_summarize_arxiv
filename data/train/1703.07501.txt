    "<S> an intriguing feature of the magnetic skyrmion in a frustrated magnetic system is its helicity - orbital coupling . </S>",
    "<S> when the magnetic dipole - dipole interaction ( ddi ) is neglected , a skyrmion can show a current - induced rotational motion together with a helicity rotation since the energy is independent of the helicity . here </S>",
    "<S> , we explore the skyrmion dynamics in a frustrated magnetic system based on the @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 classical heisenberg model explicitly by including the ddi . </S>",
    "<S> the skyrmion energy acquires a helicity dependence due to the ddi , resulting in a current - induced translational motion with a fixed helicity . </S>",
    "<S> the lowest energy states are the degenerate bloch - type states with two distinguishable helicities , which could be used as information carriers in the binary memory . </S>",
    "<S> the skyrmion helicity can be identified by applying a small driving current as the direction of the translational motion is dependent of the helicity . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that by increasing the intensity of the driving current , the helicity locking - unlocking transition occurs , where the translational skyrmion motion with a fixed helicity changes to a rotational skyrmion motion together with a helicity rotation . </S>",
    "<S> this new aspect of the helicity - orbital coupling allows us to realize the flip of the helicity between two stable bloch - type states by applying a strong current pulse , which could act as a switching process in the binary memory . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we demonstrate that two skyrmions or two antiskyrmions can spontaneously form a bound state . </S>",
    "<S> we also show the separation of the bound state forced by a driving current . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we show a pair annihilation of a skyrmion and an antiskyrmion accompanied with the emission of a propagating spin wave . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate the distinctive nature of skyrmions in frustrated magnetic materials , and also reveal unexpected properties of skyrmions which may lead to viable applications of topological spintronics .            </S>",
    "<S> he exotic and versatile magnetic skyrmion is a high - profile topological object in magnetic materials , which promises novel applications in spintronic devices  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic skyrmion was first experimentally identified in chiral magnetic materials in 2009  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> after that , it has been experimentally observed , created , and modified in different systems , including magnetic materials  @xcite , semiconductors  @xcite , multiferroic materials  @xcite , and ferroelectric materials  @xcite . due to the properties of the topologically protected stability as well as the efficient mobility driven by external forces </S>",
    "<S> , the magnetic skyrmion is anticipated to be employed as the information carrier in future data storage devices  @xcite , logic computing devices  @xcite , microwave devices  @xcite , spin - wave devices  @xcite , and transistor - like devices  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> very recently , it is shown that the magnetic skyrmion in the frustrated magnetic system has remarkable physical properties that renovate our understanding of the chiral magnetic object  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> skyrmions in frustrated magnetic materials are stabilized by the quartic differential term , which is a reminiscence of the original mechanism of the dynamical stabilization proposed by skyrme  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a prominent property is that a skyrmion and an antiskyrmion have the same energy irrespective to the helicity . for instances , the high - topological - number magnetic skyrmion  @xcite and the antiskyrmion  @xcite with the topological number of @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> are stable / metastable in the anisotropic frustrated magnet  @xcite , where the magnetic skyrmion shows coupled dynamics of the helicity and the center of mass  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . it is found that the translational motion of a magnetic skyrmion is coupled with its helicity in the frustrated magnet , resulting in the rotational skyrmion motion  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these novel properties due to the helicity - orbital coupling are lacking in the conventional ferromagnetic system , where the magnetic skyrmion is stabilized by the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction ( dmi ) and the helicity is locked .    in this paper , we explore skyrmions and antiskyrmions in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) frustrated ferromagnetic system with competing exchange interactions based on the @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 classical heisenberg model on a simple square lattice  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we explicitly include the dipole - dipole interaction ( ddi ) , which is neglected in the previous literature  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we first study the relaxed spin structure and the energy of a skyrmion with different initial values of the topological number and the helicity . </S>",
    "<S> the energies of a skyrmion with different helicity are degenerate in the absence of the ddi , but the degeneracy is resolved by the ddi . a skyrmion has two degenerate lowest energy states , which are the bloch - type states with the helicities @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> namely , a bloch - type skyrmion has an internal degree of freedom taking a binary value of @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> these two bloch - type skyrmions are clearly distinguishable since they move straight in opposite directions under a weak driving current . on the other hand , when a strong driving current is applied , the helicity is no longer locked , and the skyrmion performs a rotational motion together with a helicity rotation as if the ddi were absent .    </S>",
    "<S> we point out that it is possible to design a binary memory with the use of the binary helicity state of the bloch - type skyrmion : ( i ) apply a weak current pulse to a skyrmion at rest , and observe the direction of the motion ( toward right or left ) to which a skyrmion begins to move ; it determines the binary value of the skyrmion helicity : ( ii ) apply a strong current pulse ; it switches the binary value of the skyrmion helicity .    </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we demonstrate a spontaneous formation of the two - skyrmion bound state ( the bi - skyrmion ) as well as the two - antiskyrmion bound state ( the bi - antiskyrmion ) due to the attraction between two skyrmions and two antiskyrmions , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , it is possible to split a bi - skyrmion as well as a bi - antiskyrmion by applying a driving current . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is that the direction of the skyrmion motion depends on its helicity . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we demonstrate a pair annihilation of a skyrmion and an antiskyrmion , which emits a propagating spin wave upon the annihilation event . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that there are more promising properties and degrees of freedom of skyrmions and antiskyrmions in the frustrated magnetic system , which have great potential to be used in future topological and spintronic applications . </S>"
