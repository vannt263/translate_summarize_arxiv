    "tunneling has been one of the most characteristic features of quantum mechanics since the pioneering works by hund  @xcite on tunneling in atoms and molecules , by nordheim  @xcite and oppenheimer  @xcite on tunneling into the continuous , and by gamow  @xcite , by gurney and condon  @xcite , and by born  @xcite with its application to @xmath0 particle decay .",
    "it should be noticed that the outgoing wavefunction method of gamow leads to eigenfunctions with complex eigenvalues , which may be expressed as @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is proportional to the decay constant of the state .",
    "hence , gamow method is equivalent to the introduction of a non - hermitian effective hamiltonian to describe the system . although non - hermitian hamiltonians are commonly used in scattering theory  @xcite , standard textbook - like tunneling between sites @xmath3 and @xmath4 is always symmetric owing to the hermitian character of the hamiltonian and to the fact that the density of states for the initial and for the final states are the same .",
    "several aspects of the tunneling theory are reviewed , for instance , in the book by razavy  @xcite .",
    "various signs of asymmetric tunneling rates were observed in the last @xmath5 years , however , in systems as diversified as high-@xmath6 superconductors  @xcite , non - superconducting cuprates  @xcite , bose - einstein condensates trapped in optical potentials  @xcite , molecular electronics  @xcite , and , more recently , quantum dots interacting with leads  @xcite , for instance . despite the diversity of the physical mechanisms responsible for asymmetric tunneling in any of these systems , the unifying trace is that tunneling between initial and final sites involves a coupling to an external system , characterizing an open system .",
    "hence , it is fair to say that asymmetric tunneling must be a feature present in several real systems .",
    "since the hermiticity of the hamiltonian plays a part in guaranteeing the symmetry of the tunneling , could a non - hermitian hamiltonian be capable of describing asymmetric tunneling in a simple way ?    in a recent letter  @xcite , we presented a non - hermitian quantum model to describe the tunneling , through a @xmath7-chiral mirror , of the light fields of a system of two resonant cavities in an attempt to understand the @xmath8 asymmetry observed earlier in the transmission of circularly polarized photons through an array of asymmetric split rings  @xcite .",
    "the model consisted simply in a pair of quantum oscillators coupled by a non - reciprocal interaction , and it was recently generalized to include number non - conservation and nonlinear interactions  @xcite .",
    "based on this simple model , hermitian and non - hermitian dynamics of mode entanglement between the light fields in the cavities were analyzed  @xcite .",
    "we remark that the model incorporated phenomenologically the non - trivial interactions between photons and the chiral mirror without a detailed treatment of the mirror .",
    "in fact , there was no degrees of freedom corresponding to the mirror in the hamiltonian , and the effect of the mirror on the dynamics was introduced phenomenologically in the model in the non - reciprocal character of the interaction between the cavities .",
    "these works hint at the suggestion that non - hermitian quantum models are useful to describe certain classes of open systems in a simplified way .",
    "interest in non - hermitian quantum mechanics was renewed after bender and boettcher  @xcite presented a class of non - hermitian hamiltonians which were symmetrical under spacetime inversion ( @xmath9-symmetry ) , and which exhibited real spectra .",
    "could @xmath9 symmetry alone be responsible  @xcite for both the reality of the spectra and the unitarity of the theory ?",
    "mostafazadeh  @xcite showed that @xmath9 symmetry was neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for a hamiltonian to exhibit a real spectrum , and that exact @xmath9 symmetry was equivalent to hermiticity with respect to a suitably defined inner product .",
    "recent reviews  @xcite and the references therein provide a detailed exposition of the current status of the non - hermitian version of quantum mechanics .    coupled systems were introduced in an analysis of optical @xmath9-symmetric structures with a balanced gain - loss profile  @xcite , and the first experimental realizations of such systems appeared shortly after that  @xcite . in all these systems ,",
    "non - hermiticity was caused by the reciprocal , balanced interaction between a lossy and an active element .",
    "it should be noticed , however , that these pioneer experiments were classical emulations of the quantum @xmath9-symmetric theory owing to the equivalence between the electromagnetic wave equation and the schrdinger equation for certain regimes .    in this paper , we analyze kinematical and dynamical aspects of a non - hermitian model describing tunneling between two sites coupled by a non - reciprocal interaction . the kinematical part consists in discussing the representation of the system in a biorthogonal family of energy eigenvectors , owing to the non - hermiticity of the hamiltonian , and correcting for the lack of strict unitarity of the theory .",
    "the dynamical part consists in computing the time evolution of the state vector describing the system in order to determine transition probabilities .",
    "we emphasize that a novel aspect of this model is that the source of non - hermiticity is the presence of a non - reciprocal coupling between two otherwise ordinary quantum systems .",
    "an advantage of this treatment is that it allows the description of some aspects of the behavior of an open system using a formalism reminiscent of that applied to closed systems , that is , wavefunctions .",
    "while a closed system may be treated by the wavefunction or by the density operator formalisms , open systems are described by a density operator obeying a master equation . however , since the number of elements of the density matrix is the square of the number of coefficients of a wavefunction , solving the master equation for the density operator may be a difficult task .    therefore , we propose to describe the dynamics of an open system in a way that may be simpler than the usual master equation method at the cost of using a non - hermitian hamiltonian .",
    "hence , the approach is a phenomenological one , in which we begin with a non - hermitian hamiltonian and work out its consequences instead of attaining it from first principles in a more rigorous , yet more complex , open systems formalisms such as the feshbach projection method  @xcite , the adiabatic elimination  @xcite .",
    "in this section , we describe a non - hermitian model for the tunneling of an excitation between two sites , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and coupled by the non - reciprocal interaction @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a standard two - state ladder ( raising , @xmath12 ; lowering , @xmath13 ) operator for site @xmath14 , @xmath15 is a real coupling constant , and @xmath16 is a parameter measuring the non - reciprocality of the interaction and the non - hermiticity of the hamiltonian .",
    "since each site may be in an occupied or in an unoccupied state , it is natural to represent them by fermionic two - state operators .",
    "if @xmath17 , the hamiltonian will be a non - hermitian operator owing to the non - reciprocal character of the interaction between the two sites as illustrated in figure  [ fig : figure1 ] .    .",
    "]    the interaction @xmath18 is represented as @xmath19 relative to the basis formed by the vectors @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",
    "the basis vectors are simultaneous eigenvectors of occupation number operators @xmath24 and @xmath25 for sites @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively , where @xmath26    since we are interested in single - excitation tunneling between the two sites , we will restrict ourselves to the single - excitation subspace spanned by the vectors @xmath21 and @xmath22 in order to determine the excitation exchange dynamics . in this case",
    ", the interaction is represented by @xmath27 formally , this operator is a two - state non - hermitian hamiltonian given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 and the traceless @xmath30 are both hermitian operators .",
    "this hamiltonian is similar , although not identical , to the one studied by sergi and zloshchastiev in the context of the open system dynamics of a single two - state system  @xcite . in their case , however , @xmath31 , which leads to dissipation , loss of quantum coherence and probability non - conservation .",
    "two - state hamiltonians having the generic form @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are both hermitian operators were presented and discussed earlier in the context of the quantum brachistochrone problem  @xcite , or in the context of the closely related no - signaling condition violation polemic  @xcite .",
    "besides , it must be pointed out that the no - signaling condition violation polemic refers exclusively to the status of @xmath9-symmetric quantum theory as a fundamental description of nature .",
    "it is undisputable that non - hermitian models are useful even if they are only effective , phenomenological theories , as used successfully in several recent cases  @xcite .",
    "the non - reciprocal character of the interaction leads to a non - symmetrical , non - hermitian matrix representing the hamiltonian .",
    "a non - hermitian matrix has two sets of eigenvectors associated with its eigenvalues  @xcite .",
    "the right eigenvectors are determined by @xmath35 while the left eigenvectors are determined by @xmath36 for this simple @xmath37 matrix , it is very easy to see that the two eigenvalues of @xmath18 are @xmath38 , with @xmath39 , and that the right eigenvectors are @xmath40 while the left eigenvectors are @xmath41 with @xmath42 .",
    "these eigenvectors were normalized so that the completeness relation reads @xmath43 and the pair of the sets of right and of left eigenvectors forms a biorthogonal system , with @xmath44    for completeness , we would like to present some aspects regarding the usage of biorthogonal bases to represent quantum systems , since they seldom appear in quantum mechanics .",
    "we will begin with the representation of a state with respect to the energy biorthogonal bases . using the completeness relation , equation  , a state @xmath45",
    "may be represented by @xmath46 where the expansion coefficients are given by @xmath47 .",
    "similarly , @xmath48 is represented by @xmath49 with @xmath50 . hence , there are two sets of expansion coefficients , one for kets , another for bras",
    ". as we will see next , these coefficients are not simply the complex conjugates of each other , as they would be if the hamiltonian were a hermitian operator .    regarding time evolution",
    ", we assume that schrdinger equation @xmath51 is still valid .",
    "hence , using eqs .  , , and  , we find that @xmath52 although the coefficients @xmath53 are similar to the familiar expansion coefficients obtained with a hermitian hamiltonian , the evolution is still non - unitary owing to the non - hermiticity of the hamiltonian operator . in order to grasp this point , we turn our attention to the schrdinger equation for @xmath54 , @xmath55 since @xmath56 , the expansion coefficients @xmath57 for @xmath54 will not have a form as simple as that of the coefficients @xmath53 for @xmath58 . in fact , we find that @xmath59 which may be solved , after a slightly tedious algebra , to give @xmath60    at this point , it should be clear that neither @xmath61 nor @xmath62 can represent the normalization of a state .",
    "in fact , even the quantity @xmath63 is not the right choice , since it does not preserve the norm of the state as the system evolves .",
    "suppose that the initial state is properly normalized , i.e. , that @xmath64 . then , equations  , and   show that , in this case , the normalization factor is given by @xmath65\\sin(\\omega t ) \\biggr\\ } + \\\\      c_\\mathrm{l}^- ( 0 ) { \\mathrm{e}}^{{\\mathrm{i}}\\omega t}\\biggl\\{c_\\mathrm{r}^- ( 0)\\cos(\\omega t ) + \\frac{{\\mathrm{i}}}{2\\beta}\\biggl [ c_\\mathrm{r}^+ ( 0)\\bigl(1-\\beta^2 \\bigr ) - c_\\mathrm{r}^- ( 0)\\bigl(1+\\beta^2\\bigr ) \\biggr]\\sin(\\omega t ) \\biggr\\}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] which is not a constant , in general .",
    "however , we can fix this unitarity problem by assuming that the proper normalized vectors are given by @xmath66 that is , the unnormalized vector multiplied by the inverse of the normalization factor , which is consistent with the prescription presented earlier by scholtz , geyer , and hahne  @xcite .",
    "an alternative method to define a unitary quantum system using a non - hermitian hamiltonian was presented by mostafazadeh  @xcite , consisting in redefining the inner product of the theory with a metric operator , which , in our case , would be given by @xmath67 we believe that the simple method outlined above is sufficient for our purposes .",
    "having discussed these points , we finally turn our attention to probability amplitudes , transition probabilities , and normalization .",
    "since the vector @xmath58 is not properly normalized as time passes , we define an unnormalized probability amplitude for the system initially in the state @xmath68 to be found in the state @xmath69 at time @xmath70 as the usual @xmath71 where @xmath72 are the expansion coefficients of @xmath73 , and @xmath58 is the time evolved form of the initial state @xmath68 .",
    "however , using our prescription for normalizing a state , equations   and  , the normalized probability amplitude is given by @xmath74 in this formalism , normalized transition probabilities would be given by @xmath75    in order to show that tunneling is indeed asymmetrical in this system , we focus on two different initial conditions : one in which the initial excitation is localized in site @xmath3 , the other in which the initial excitation is in site @xmath4 . in the former case , the initial state is given by @xmath76 while it is @xmath77 in the latter case .",
    "expansion coefficients are easy to calculate : @xmath78 and one may verify that the initial states are properly normalized .",
    "it is also very easy to verify that the two initial states are orthogonal since @xmath79 with all these coefficients , it is possible to calculate the normalization factors . for @xmath80",
    ", we have @xmath81 while the normalization factor for @xmath82 is slightly different , being given by @xmath83    in each case , there are two unnormalized probability amplitudes that are interesting to calculate , the amplitudes for an excitation to be or not to be exchanged between sites . when the excitation is initially at site @xmath3 , the former amplitude is @xmath84 and the latter amplitude is given by @xmath85 however , when the excitation is initially at site @xmath4 , the amplitudes are given by @xmath86     as a function of the parameters @xmath87 , and @xmath42 . ]",
    "determination of all these amplitudes allows us to calculate the normalized transition probabilities .",
    "the probability for an excitation initially at site @xmath3 to be found at site @xmath4 at time @xmath70 is @xmath88 as shown in figure  [ fig : figure2 ] as a function of the two adimensional parameters @xmath89 , and @xmath90 .",
    "for ease of reference , the time intervals in which @xmath91 will be called the high @xmath92 transition probability phase , and the time intervals in which @xmath93 will be the low @xmath92 transition probability phase . in the reciprocal case ( @xmath94 ) , the system spends equal amounts of time in the low and in the high @xmath92 transition probability phases .",
    "as @xmath95 departs from unity , the non - reciprocality of the interaction manifests itself . in the @xmath96 region ,",
    "the system passes more than @xmath97 of the time in the low @xmath92 transition probability phase , while for @xmath98 , the opposite happens . in all cases ,",
    "transition probability is a periodic function with period @xmath99 . for the inverse process",
    ", the transition probability is given by @xmath100 and an analysis similar to the above holds . from this analysis",
    ", we may hint that , in the long run , the occupation of the two sites should be distinct , as we will show briefly .",
    "figure  [ fig : figure3 ] shows the transition probability ratio @xmath101 also as a function of the adimensional parameters @xmath102 , and @xmath95 . as expected , the maxima of the transition probability ratio depart from unity as @xmath95 becomes different from unity , signalling the asymmetry in the tunneling rates in this non - hermitian model .     as a function of the parameters @xmath87 , and @xmath42 . ]    besides , the probability for an excitation initially at site @xmath3 still be found at site @xmath3 at time @xmath70 is @xmath103 which means that @xmath104 similarly , @xmath105 confirming that there is no loss in this model , after normalizing the states .",
    "however , dissipation may be added phenomenologically to the model using well - known techniques such as introducing a complex diagonal term in the hamiltonian matrix .",
    "besides , it must be noticed that bypassing the normalization step leads , in general , to a non - unitary dynamics , that is , @xmath106 which shows that the unnormalized description allows for excitation exchange with the environment .    in this regard",
    ", we would like to point out that the density operator for this system is given , in the unnormalized description , by @xmath107 inspection of the equations  [ eq : c_l(t ) ] and  [ eq : c_r(t ) ] for the wavefunction coefficients @xmath108 and @xmath109 is sufficient to show that there is no damping in the quantum coherence in the dynamics of this system , even in the unnormalized case .",
    "this stands in opposition with the master equation approach to open quantum systems , in which normalization is preserved but coherence is rapidly lost as the system interacts with the environment  @xcite . in spite of this , long - lived coherence is observed even in very noisy environments , during photosynthesis  @xcite , for instance .",
    "since preservation of quantum coherence would be an important achievement in quantum information theory , it represents an advantage to know that an open system may slow down decoherence if its effective non - hermitian hamiltonian is similar to the one described here .    directing our attention to the occupation number @xmath110 for site @xmath3",
    ", we find that @xmath111 when the excitation is initially at site @xmath3 , for instance . in this same case ,",
    "the occupation number @xmath112 for site @xmath4 is given by @xmath113 figure  [ fig : figure4 ] shows the occupation numbers for the two sites plotted against the parameter @xmath87 for a typical @xmath114 case when the excitation was initially at site @xmath3 .",
    "a distinct feature of the graph is that the occupation number for site @xmath3 is , on average , lower than the occupation number for site @xmath4 .",
    "clearly , in a @xmath115 scenario , the opposite would happen .    , and @xmath116 as functions of the adimensional parameter @xmath87 for @xmath117 ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "excitation was initially at site @xmath3 . ]    finally , having the transition probabilities , a semiclassical rate equation for this system is given simply by @xmath119 since the excitation is not lost from the system .",
    "figure  [ fig : figure5 ] shows the semiclassical occupation numbers @xmath120 for site @xmath3 , and @xmath121 for site @xmath4 plotted against the parameter @xmath87 for a typical @xmath114 case when the excitation was initially at site @xmath3 . after a short transient period , the semiclassical occupation numbers are clearly separated , fluctuating around their new equilibrium values . as expected in this @xmath114 case",
    ", the occupation of site @xmath4 is greater than the occupation of site @xmath3 .",
    "the opposite would happen in a @xmath122 case .    , and @xmath121 as functions of the adimensional parameter @xmath87 for @xmath117 ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "excitation was initially at site @xmath3 . ]    in conclusion , we have shown that a non - hermitian quantum model describes the excitation exchange dynamics typical of asymmetric tunneling .",
    "an effectively unitary description of this system was attained by proper normalization of the state vectors .",
    "a feature common to all non - hermitian systems is that the normalization depends on the hamiltonian , having to be chosen dynamically .",
    "however , even in the unnormalized case , quantum coherence is not exponentially destroyed .",
    "this treatment suggests a way of dealing phenomenologically with irreversible interacting quantum systems using a formalism that mimics that of a closed system , and which may be , therefore , simpler than the usual open system formalism .",
