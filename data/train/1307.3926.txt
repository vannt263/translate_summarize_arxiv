    "[ r.xi ]    as suggested after theorem [ th.analyt ] , it should be possible to extend the above proof to basically any boundary conditions @xmath49 ( with the only constraint that one can prove a scaling limit result for @xmath225 as in @xcite ) .",
    "for example , if @xmath49 is made of a finite combination of @xmath50 arcs , this is handled in @xcite . in this latter case",
    ", one would rely on the following extension of  :    @xmath280    the additional difficulty when @xmath49 is a general boundary condition lies in the fk - representation of the associated ising model .",
    "indeed , general boundary conditions induce negative information in the bulk ( since the fk configuration is now conditioned to disconnect @xmath76 and @xmath77 arcs ) .",
    "but one can see from the above proof that negative information in fact makes lemma [ l.area ] even more likely .",
    "indeed it makes the event @xmath250 of having a dual crossing in the annulus @xmath244 more likely .",
    "we note that @xmath281 can not behave like @xmath282 as @xmath283 because , by the lee - yang theorem , @xmath284 , as a function of complex @xmath81 , has infinitely many zeros , all purely real .",
    "thus , @xmath281 must diverge to @xmath285 at an infinite sequence of real @xmath81 values ( i.e. , at the zeros ) tending to @xmath286 .",
    "we start by establishing proposition [ pr.nc ] .",
    "let us assume that the boundary condition @xmath49 is @xmath76 along @xmath24 ( the case of free b.c .",
    "is treated in the same manner ) . the ising model with an external field @xmath287",
    "can be thought of as a simple change of measure with respect to the ising model without external field . in particular",
    ", one has for any field @xmath288 : @xmath289 or , written in terms of the radon - nikodym derivative , one has @xmath290 } \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath291 and @xmath292 denote respectively the laws of @xmath60 and @xmath293 .",
    "now it is not hard to check , using the fact that @xmath294 has exponential moments ( proposition  [ pr.expmom ] ) , that @xmath295 converges weakly for the topology of @xmath62 to the measure @xmath296 which is absolutely continuous w.r.t @xmath297 and whose radon - nikodym derivative is given by @xmath298 we refer to the appendix a of @xcite for details on the topological setup used here ( @xmath59 ) .      [ l.coupling ] for any @xmath301",
    ", there exists @xmath302 sufficiently large so that , uniformly in @xmath303 , one can find a coupling of @xmath75 with @xmath304 satisfying @xmath305 where @xmath306 is defined by @xmath307      let @xmath309 be such that @xmath310 ( its value will be fixed later , also depending on the value of @xmath53 ) .",
    "we wish to find some @xmath311 such that one can couple the fields @xmath312 and @xmath304 in such a way that with probability at least @xmath313 they are identical once restricted to the sub - domain @xmath314 . by the definition of @xmath315 , this will clearly imply our result with @xmath316 .",
    "the coupling will be constructed similarly as in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we will also use the fk representation with a ghost vertex used in @xcite ( see also for example @xcite ) .",
    "we refer to @xcite for more details on this representation .",
    "since the proof below will follow very closely the proof of the lower bound given in section 3 in @xcite , we will not give the full details here .",
    "following the notation of @xcite , let @xmath317 and @xmath318 be respectively the fk representations of the ising model with external field @xmath53 on @xmath319 and on @xmath320 with @xmath76 boundary conditions .",
    "these configurations are fk percolation configurations on the graph @xmath321 and the notation @xmath322 distinguishes between the nearest neighbor edges in @xmath13 ( @xmath323 ) and the edges of the type @xmath324 , with @xmath325 ( @xmath326 ) . furthermore , it is easy to check that @xmath327 stochastically dominates @xmath328",
    ". let us divide the annulus @xmath329 into disjoint annuli of ratio 4 : namely @xmath330 and so on .",
    "as such one has about @xmath331 annuli . as in @xcite , we will explore `` inward '' both configurations by preserving the monotonicity @xmath332 and by trying to find a matching circuit @xmath333 in each annulus with positive probability .",
    "as in @xcite , the main ingredient for the coupling is the rsw theorem from @xcite .",
    "the difference in our present setting is that one also has to deal with the influence of the _ ghost _ vertex @xmath334 . in particular , finding a matching circuit @xmath333 is not enough if one wants to claim that the conditional law `` inside '' @xmath333 are the same : one also has to make sure that the circuit @xmath333 is connected in both configurations to the ghost vertex @xmath334 .",
    "we proceed as follows .",
    "assume we did not succeed in coupling the two configurations in the first @xmath335 annuli @xmath336 and consider the @xmath337 annulus @xmath338 . at this point ,",
    "the configurations have been explored everywhere except inside the outer boundary of @xmath339 , and @xmath327 dominates @xmath340 . inside the annulus @xmath339 ,",
    "we will distinguish 3 sub - annuli : @xmath341 , @xmath342 and @xmath343 . from the rsw theorem of @xcite",
    ", there are open circuits in @xmath328 ( and thus @xmath344 with positive probability @xmath30 in each of @xmath345 .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath328 dominates a critical fk configuration with zero magnetic field and with wired boundary conditions along @xmath346 ( see section 3 in @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , due to the positive information inside @xmath347 ( thanks to the open circuits in each @xmath348 and @xmath349 ) , it is easy to extend the techniques used to prove lemma 3.1 . in @xcite ( i.e. an appropriate second moment argument ) to show that with positive probability @xmath30 , there are at least @xmath350 points inside @xmath347 which are connected in @xmath328 to the `` outermost '' open circuit @xmath333 for the configuration @xmath328 in the annulus @xmath349 . since @xmath351 , the exact same proof as for lemma 3.2 of @xcite shows that if one chooses @xmath352 large enough ( depending on @xmath353 ) , then conditioned on the above event of having at least @xmath350 points connected to @xmath333 , with conditional probability at least 1/2 , the cluster including @xmath333 will be connected to the ghost vertex @xmath334 for the configuration @xmath328 ( and thus for @xmath327 as well ) .",
    "once @xmath340 and @xmath327 have a matching circuit @xmath333 connected to @xmath334 , one can sample the rest of the configurations so that they match `` inside '' the circuit @xmath333 .",
    "( as in @xcite , the exploration process is driven by @xmath328 . )",
    "to conclude , we choose @xmath352 so that it satsifies the two constraints discussed above ( i.e. , @xmath354 and the constraint relative to @xmath53 ) .",
    "this gives a us a certain positive probability @xmath30 to couple both configurations in any annulus @xmath355 , @xmath356 .",
    "the proof is then completed by choosing @xmath357 so that @xmath358 .    by proposition [ pr.nc ] , for any @xmath299 , one has that @xmath75 converges in law to @xmath359 in @xmath360 .",
    "it is easy to check that this convergence in law also holds in the space @xmath361 .",
    "since this latter space is polish , for any @xmath301 , there exists @xmath362 such that , for any @xmath363 , one can couple @xmath75 with @xmath359 so that @xmath364    by using this fact together with lemma [ l.coupling ] and the fact that @xmath361 is polish , one easily obtains that @xmath365 converges in law in @xmath308 as @xmath64 to a limiting field @xmath366 .",
    "now that our limiting random field is defined , to conclude about the convergence in law of @xmath304 to this limiting field , we proceed in the same manner : for any @xmath367 , one can find @xmath368 sufficiently small so that for any @xmath369 , there exists a joint coupling @xmath370 such that all fields are @xmath190-close to each other ( for @xmath315 ) with probability at least @xmath371 .",
    "this proves the convergence in law of @xmath304 to @xmath366 .",
