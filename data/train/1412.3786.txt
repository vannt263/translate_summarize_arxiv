    "understanding the processes that heat the sun s corona and accelerate the solar wind is a long standing goal in the space - physics community .",
    "a number of mechanisms have been proposed to account for these phenomena , including low - frequency alfvn - wave turbulence @xcite , cyclotron heating @xcite , stochastic heating @xcite , velocity filtration @xcite , reconnection @xcite , and nanoflares @xcite .",
    "remote observations have been employed to constrain the likelihood of these mechanisms operating near the sun @xcite . however , _ in situ _ measurements are necessary to distinguish between these competing ideas .",
    "the upcoming solar probe plus ( spp ) mission will make such measurements at heliocentric distances  @xmath6 as small as  @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the solar radius . in order to extract scientific results from spp measurements",
    ", we must consider the interpretation of measurements made in the spacecraft reference frame .",
    "spacecraft measurements are made in the time domain , but are often translated into information about the spatial structure of waves and turbulence using taylor s hypothesis @xcite , which treats fluctuations as static in the reference frame that moves with the mean velocity  @xmath9 of the solar wind ( which we take to be measured in an inertial reference frame centered on the sun ) .",
    "for example , if @xmath10 denotes the magnetic field measured by the spacecraft and @xmath11 denotes the ( assumed - to - be ) static magnetic field as a function of position  @xmath12 in the solar - wind frame , then @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the spacecraft location at  @xmath15 . here",
    ", we have neglected the velocity of the spacecraft , which , near earth , is @xmath16 .",
    "taylor s hypothesis is a good approximation when @xmath17 is much larger than the fluctuating plasma velocity and wave phase speeds , since waves and turbulent structures are then advected past the spacecraft on a timescale that is much shorter than the time required for the waves or structures to evolve appreciably in the solar - wind frame .",
    "when taylor s hypothesis holds and  @xmath9 is constant , the ( angular ) frequency power spectrum @xmath18 of a quantity such as @xmath10 is related to the wavenumber spectrum @xmath19 of @xmath11 through the equation  @xcite @xmath20 where the @xmath21 integration is over all of @xmath21-space .",
    "thus , a wavenumber  @xmath22 in the solar - wind frame corresponds to an angular frequency  @xmath23 in the spacecraft frame .",
    "a critical issue for spp is that @xmath17 is comparable to the alfvn speed  @xmath24 near spp s perihelion , and thus taylor s hypothesis does not in general apply .",
    "however , in this paper , we show that a modified version of taylor s hypothesis can be recovered near spp s perihelion under a set of conditions that are expected to hold for the energetically dominant component of the turbulent fluctuations in the near - sun solar wind .",
    "in situ measurements indicate that the ( total ) fractional density fluctuations  @xmath25 in the solar wind at @xmath26 are much smaller than  @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are , respectively , the fluctuating and background magnetic fields , and @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the fluctuating and background mass densities , respectively  @xcite",
    ". observations of radio signals transmitted by the _ helios _ spacecraft indicate that the inequality @xmath32 also holds near spp s perihelion ( see , e.g. , the appendix of * ? ? ?",
    "the condition @xmath32 implies that the dominant fluctuations are non - compressive , consistent with the fact that compressive waves are damped much more rapidly than non - compressive waves in the collisionless solar wind  @xcite and with hollweg s  ( @xcite ) finding that fast magnetosonic waves launched outward through the chromosphere are reflected almost completely at the transition region .    in this paper , we restrict our analysis to the dominant , non - compressive component of the fluctuations and derive a version of taylor s hypothesis that will apply only to such non - compressive fluctuations .",
    "we assume that @xmath33 we also restrict our analysis to fluctuations at length scales greater than the proton gyroradius . at such scales ,",
    "the only non - compressive mode is the alfvn wave , for which @xmath28 and the fluctuating velocity  @xmath34 are perpendicular to  @xmath29 .",
    "we thus take the fluctuations to satisfy the conditions @xmath35    we assume that @xmath29 and the background solar - wind velocity  @xmath9 are , at least to a good approximation , in the radial direction  @xmath36 .",
    "( it is trivial to generalize our results to the case in which @xmath29 points in the @xmath37 direction . )",
    "we also take @xmath31 to vary with position perpendicular to  @xmath36 much more slowly than does  @xmath28 . given these assumptions and equations  ( [ eq : drho ] ) and  ( [ eq : tnc ] ) ,",
    "the fluctuations are described by the heinemann - olbert  ( @xcite ) equations  ( for additional discussion see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath38 @xmath39 and @xmath40 @xmath41 where @xmath42 are the heinemann - olbert variables , @xmath43 is the alfvn velocity , @xmath44 is the total pressure , @xmath45 @xmath46 is the value of  @xmath31 at the alfvn critical point  @xmath47 ( at which  @xmath48 ) , @xmath49 are the elsasser variables , and @xmath50 .",
    "physically , @xmath51 and @xmath4 ( @xmath52 and @xmath5 ) represent noncompressive , transverse fluctuations that propagate away from ( toward ) the sun in the plasma frame .",
    "the pressure terms in equations  ( [ eqn : hog ] ) and ( [ eqn : hof ] ) enforce the incompressibility condition by canceling out the compressive components of the nonlinear terms @xmath53 and @xmath54 . to simplify the notation",
    ", we define @xmath55 where the subscript `` nc '' stands for `` non - compressive component .",
    "''    measurements from the _ helios _ spacecraft show that on average the ratio @xmath56 exceeds  1 at @xmath57 and that this ratio increases as @xmath6 decreases  @xcite .",
    "theoretical models  @xcite , shell - model simulations  @xcite , and direct numerical simulations  @xcite also suggest that @xmath2 at @xmath58 .",
    "we thus assume that @xmath59 equation  ( [ eq : zmzp ] ) implies that @xmath60 .",
    "moreover , the ratio @xmath61 is much smaller than @xmath62 near  @xmath47 , because of the prefactor  @xmath63 in the definition of  @xmath52 in equation  ( [ eq : fg ] ) .",
    "the quantity  @xmath64 is @xmath65 .",
    "it thus follows from equation  ( [ eq : zmzp ] ) that @xmath66 ( d v_{\\rm a}/d r)\\,\\bm{f}|$ ] , because @xmath67 is not much smaller than  @xmath68 .",
    "given equation  ( [ eq : zmzp ] ) , we may thus approximate equation  ( [ eqn : hog ] ) as @xmath69    we now change from a reference frame centered on the sun with position  @xmath70 and time  @xmath71 to the spacecraft reference frame with position @xmath72 and time @xmath73 .",
    "the temporal and spatial derivatives in the two frames are related by the equations @xmath74 and @xmath75 , where @xmath76 .",
    "we can thus rewrite equation  ( [ eqn : hog2 ] ) as @xmath77 where @xmath78 is given by the right - hand side of equation  ( [ eq : nlnc ] ) , with  @xmath79 replaced by @xmath80 .",
    "our goal now is to determine when the nonlinear term on the right - hand side of equation  ( [ eqn : hogsc ] ) can be neglected .",
    "we note that the @xmath81 term `` picks up '' the spatial derivatives of  @xmath51 in the directions perpendicular to  @xmath29 , because of equation  ( [ eq : tnc ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath82 term picks up the spatial derivatives of  @xmath51 along the direction of  @xmath29 .",
    "thus , even though @xmath83 , it is not necessarily the case that @xmath84 , because the perpendicular gradient of  @xmath51 could greatly exceed the parallel gradient . on the other hand ,",
    "the spacecraft velocity  @xmath85 has a nonzero component @xmath86 perpendicular to  @xmath29 .",
    "the term @xmath87 thus greatly exceeds @xmath88 in magnitude when @xmath89 near perihelion , @xmath90 and equation  ( [ eq : vsczm ] ) likely holds @xcite .",
    "when equation  ( [ eq : vsczm ] ) is satisfied , equation  ( [ eqn : hogsc ] ) becomes ( to leading order in the small quantity @xmath91 ) @xmath92 where @xmath93 the left - hand side of equation  ( [ eqn : hog3 ] ) is the convective time derivative of @xmath51 at a point that moves with velocity  @xmath94 .",
    "the vanishing of this time derivative to leading order in @xmath91 and @xmath62 expresses mathematically the statement that @xmath51 fluctuations are approximately frozen in a frame that moves with velocity  @xmath94 .",
    "we now restrict our consideration to time intervals @xmath95 that are sufficiently short that ( 1 ) @xmath85 is approximately constant and ( 2 ) @xmath96 and @xmath9 are approximately constant at the spacecraft location and throughout the radial interval through which the @xmath51 fluctuations propagate during time  @xmath95 . with these conditions ,",
    "@xmath94 can be treated as constant , and the solution for @xmath51 in equation  ( [ eqn : hog3 ] ) is @xmath97 just as equation  ( [ eq : taylor1 ] ) leads to equation  ( [ eq : pfp3d ] ) , equation  ( [ eqn : thho ] ) implies that @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the ( angular ) frequency spectrum of @xmath51 in the spacecraft frame , and @xmath100 is the wavenumber spectrum of  @xmath101 . in order for the inward - propagating fluctuations ( i.e. , @xmath52 ) to obey an analogous relation ,",
    "@xmath102 would need to be latexmath:[$\\gg     to understand why a version of taylor s hypothesis applies to outward - propagating @xmath51 fluctuations even when @xmath104 , it is helpful to view the spacecraft in the `` @xmath105 reference frame , '' which moves away from the sun at velocity @xmath106 , which , as discussed above , we treat as as effectively constant . in the @xmath105 reference frame , @xmath51 changes only because of the nonlinear shearing represented by the @xmath107 term on the right - hand side of equation  ( [ eqn : hog2 ] ) .",
    "a fixed location in an inertial reference frame centered on the sun moves at velocity  @xmath108 in the @xmath105 frame , as represented by the open triangle in figure  [ fig : spp ] .",
    "at such a location , our modified version of taylor s hypothesis ( in this case with @xmath109 ) need not apply , because the timescale on which a @xmath51 structure evolves due to nonlinear shearing could be comparable to the time needed to traverse that structure in the radial direction at speed  @xmath110 . this",
    "is directly related to the point made above that even though @xmath83 , it is not necessarily the case that @xmath84 , because @xmath106 is along  @xmath29 , whereas @xmath111 is perpendicular to  @xmath29 . on the other hand , in the @xmath105 frame , the spp spacecraft will move at velocity @xmath112 , as illustrated by the filled triangle in figure  [ fig : spp ] .",
    "if equation  ( [ eq : vsczm ] ) is satisfied , then spp will traverse a @xmath51 structure in a time that is much shorter than the time required for that structure to change in the @xmath105 frame , and the @xmath51 structures can be approximated as frozen .",
    "rest frame , '' which moves away from the sun at velocity  @xmath113 .",
    "the open triangle represents a point that is at rest in an inertial frame centered on the sun .",
    "the rectangles represent turbulent structures associated with non - compressive @xmath105 ( or @xmath114 ) fluctuations .",
    "[ fig : spp ] , width=207 ]    equations  ( [ eqn : thho ] ) and ( [ eq : pfp3d2 ] ) are analogous to the usual forms of taylor s hypothesis given in equations  ( [ eq : taylor1 ] ) and ( [ eq : pfp3d ] ) , but with some differences . at @xmath115 ,",
    "structures are approximately frozen in the plasma frame and are swept by the spacecraft at a velocity  @xmath116 .",
    "closer to the sun , when equations  ( [ eq : zmzp ] ) and ( [ eq : vsczm ] ) are satisfied , @xmath51 structures are approximately frozen and are swept by the spacecraft at velocity  @xmath117 , but @xmath52 structures need not be frozen . at @xmath115 , the frequencies in the spacecraft frame are much larger than the frequencies of fluctuations measured in the plasma frame .",
    "in contrast , this frequency disparity need not arise near the alfvn critical point .",
    "if the frequency associated with some fluctuation in the spacecraft frame arises primarily from the @xmath118 term in equation  ( [ eqn : hogsc ] ) , then this frequency is only a factor of @xmath119 larger than the frequency that would arise in the plasma frame .",
    "the direct output of equations  ( [ eqn : thho ] ) and ( [ eq : pfp3d2 ] ) is the spatial structure of the  @xmath51 field .",
    "however , because we restrict our analysis to time intervals  @xmath95 that are sufficiently small that @xmath17 and @xmath24 remain fairly constant at the spacecraft location and throughout a radial interval extending from spp a distance  @xmath120 toward the sun , the factor of proportionality between  @xmath4and  @xmath51 , @xmath121 can be treated as approximately constant . as a consequence , the frequency and wavenumber spectra of  @xmath51 in equation  ( [ eq : pfp3d2 ] ) can be converted into frequency and wavenumber spectra of  @xmath4 via equation  ( [ eq : fg ] ) . near the alfvn critical point @xmath122 ,",
    "the radial variations in @xmath123 are particularly small , allowing for a translation between @xmath51 spectra and @xmath4 spectra with very little error .",
    "this can be seen by writing @xmath124 , where @xmath125 near @xmath47 . from equation  ( [ eqn : eta ] ) , @xmath126 .",
    "taylor - expanding equation  ( [ eqn : h ] ) about @xmath127 , we obtain @xmath128 .",
    "\\label{eqn : hx}\\ ] ] because @xmath123 varies quadratically with the quantity @xmath129 , and because of the factor of @xmath130 , @xmath123 varies very slowly with radius near  @xmath122 .    to illustrate how the technique we describe could be applied ,",
    "we suppose that near its perihelion of  @xmath131 spp traverses a fast - solar - wind stream emanating from a low - latitude coronal hole , in which @xmath17 and @xmath24 are approximately steady for a period of @xmath132 , during which time @xmath133 and @xmath134 . if equations  ( [ eq : zmzp ] ) and ( [ eq : vsczm ] ) are satisfied , then equations  ( [ eqn : thho ] ) and ( [ eq : pfp3d2 ] ) apply , and spp measurements during this interval sample approximately frozen  @xmath51 structures along a line segment that extends from @xmath135 to @xmath136 , while spanning a distance @xmath137 perpendicular to the radial direction . over the radial range @xmath138 ,",
    "the quantity @xmath139 varies by 6.1% in the data - based model of @xcite , consistent with our assumption that @xmath139 is reasonably constant throughout this radial interval .",
    "given the density profile in this model , in which @xmath140 , equations  ( [ eqn : eta ] ) and ( [ eqn : h ] ) imply that @xmath123 varies from a value of 0.491 at @xmath141 to a value of 0.499 at @xmath142 . to within 2% ,",
    "@xmath143 throughout the interval @xmath138 , and thus the frequency and wavenumber spectra of  @xmath4 are to a high degree of accuracy equal to a constant ( 1/4 ) times the frequency and wavenumber spectra of  @xmath51 .",
    "as this example shows , the modified version of taylor s hypothesis that we describe will enable spp to probe the dominant component of solar - wind turbulence inside of spp s perihelion .    in claiming that the energetically dominant fluctuations near the sun approximately satisfy equation  ( [ eqn : hog3 ] ) , we have relied upon the assumptions that : ( 1 ) @xmath144 ( which in practice implies that @xmath145 since @xmath146 ) ; ( 2 ) @xmath28 and @xmath34 are approximately perpendicular to @xmath29 ; ( 3 ) @xmath2 ; ( 4 ) @xmath1 ; ( 5 ) @xmath31 varies much more slowly with position perpendicular to  @xmath36 than does  @xmath28 ; and ( 6 ) @xmath29 is nearly radial .",
    "spp measurements will provide tests of conditions ( 1 ) through  ( 5 ) . to check assumption",
    "( 6 ) using spp measurements would require averaging @xmath147 over timescales much longer than the timescale of the energetically dominant magnetic fluctuations , which is likely  @xmath148  h  @xcite .",
    "however , such long time averages will become progressively more difficult as spp approaches perihelion , since spp will rapidly traverse the near - perihelion region at @xmath149 . on the other hand ,",
    "the assumption that  @xmath29 is nearly radial at @xmath150 is likely accurate if coronal mass ejections are excluded , because the closed - loop magnetic structures of the sun are primarily confined to smaller  @xmath6 and the parker spiral field begins to bend appreciably into the azimuthal direction only at larger  @xmath6 .",
    "we emphasize that the above conditions are sufficient but not necessary , since , e.g. , taylor s hypothesis can apply when @xmath151 provided @xmath152 .",
    "we also note that we have not restricted our analysis to fluctuations that are either quasi-2d or quasi - slab - symmetric , whether with respect to the background magnetic field  @xmath29 or the local magnetic field  @xmath153 .",
    "observations at  1  au  @xcite and numerical simulations of solar - wind turbulence near the sun  @xcite suggest that if the overall fractional cross helicity is high , then @xmath2 throughout much of the inertial range .",
    "if this is the case near the sun , then @xmath154 scale by scale throughout much of the inertial range , and spp magnetometer measurements on their own ( without velocity measurements ) will be sufficient to approximate the frequency spectra of @xmath51 and  @xmath4 .",
    "our study differs from previous studies of taylor s hypothesis for spp .",
    "@xcite accounted for @xmath3 and concluded that the characteristic turbulence speed must be @xmath155 for taylor s hypothesis to apply to 2d turbulence .",
    "in contrast , we have shown that a form of taylor s hypothesis applies to @xmath51 or @xmath4 fluctuations even when the characteristic turbulence speed is comparable to @xmath3 , provided @xmath156 and @xmath157 . @xcite and @xcite found that taylor s hypothesis holds near the perihelion of spp for sufficiently oblique alfvn and kinetic alfvn waves if the fluctuations are treated as linear waves . in the present study , we do not restrict the analysis to linear or highly oblique waves .",
    "transverse , non - compressive fluctuations likely comprise the bulk of the fluctuation energy in the near - sun solar wind .",
    "when @xmath158 , @xmath9 and @xmath29 are nearly radial , and @xmath31 varies much more slowly with position perpendicular to  @xmath36 than does  @xmath28 , these transverse , non - compressive fluctuations are described by the heinemann - olbert equations .",
    "we use these equations to show that outward - propagating fluctuations can be treated as frozen within a reference frame that will be advected past spp at velocity  @xmath117 , provided that @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "observations and simulations suggest that these latter two inequalities and the inequality @xmath158 will be satisfied near spp s perihelion . as a consequence , it will likely be possible to use a modified version of taylor s hypothesis to characterize the spatial structure of the outward - propagating , transverse , non - compressive fluctuations that will be encountered by spp near its perihelion , even when  @xmath104 and @xmath159 .",
