    "antikaon ( @xmath2 meson ) condensation in dense baryonic matter formed in heavy ion collisions as well as in neutron stars was first proposed by kaplan and nelson @xcite .",
    "there was lots of interest in the study of antikaon condensation in neutron stars @xcite after their work .",
    "a first - order phase transition from hadronic matter to antikaon condensed matter was investigated in several cases using relativistic field theoretical models @xcite .",
    "the phase transition was either studied using maxwell construction or governed by gibbs rules for phase equilibrium along with global baryon number and charge conservation @xcite . in those cases the focus was on the equation of state ( eos ) and neutron star structure as well as critical temperature of antikaon condensation .",
    "a first - order phase transition may proceed through the nucleation of droplets of the new phase .",
    "the formation of droplets of exotic matter such as antikaon condensed matter and quark matter , could be possible in neutron stars when the protoneutron star cools down to a temperature of @xmath3 10 mev and is deleptonised @xcite",
    ". this nucleation process could be due to quantum and thermal nucleation mechanisms @xcite .",
    "the thermal nucleation of antikaon condensed matter was already studied using the homogeneous nucleation theory of langer @xcite .",
    "recently it has been shown in the context of nucleation of quark matter in hot and neutrino - free neutron stars that the thermal nucleation is more efficient than the quantum nucleation process at higher temperatures @xcite .",
    "the homogeneous nucleation theory of langer @xcite is applicable close to a first - order phase transition .",
    "the hadronic matter becomes metastable near the phase transition point when there is a sudden change in state variables . in this case",
    "thermal and quantum fluctuations play important roles in the metastable phase",
    ". small ranged and localised fluctuations in state variables of the metastable hadronic matter might lead to the nucleation of droplets of stable antikaon condensed matter .",
    "those droplets of the stable phase having radii larger than a critical radius will survive and grow .",
    "a droplet may grow beyond the critical size if the latent heat is transported from the surface of the droplet into the metastable phase .",
    "it was argued that the heat transportation could be achieved through the thermal dissipation and viscous damping @xcite .",
    "the influence of thermal conductivity and shear viscosity on the thermal nucleation time was studied in a first - order phase transition from hadronic to quark matter @xcite .",
    "however there is no such calculation for the thermal nucleation of antikaon condensed matter .",
    "we are motivated to study the effect of shear viscosity on the thermal nucleation rate of droplets of antikaon condensed matter in this work .",
    "shear viscosity of pure neutron and neutron star matter has been calculated by several groups @xcite .",
    "recently we have investigated the shear viscosity in antikaon condensed matter @xcite .",
    "though we considered a first - order antikaon condensation , we did not take into account the nucleation process .",
    "we performed the calculation of shear viscosity in neutron star matter using the eos derived from relativistic field theoretical models .",
    "now the question is how this shear viscosity of nucleonic phase may impact the nucleation of antikaon condensed phase .",
    "the earlier calculation of the nucleation of quark matter adopted a parametrised form of the shear viscosity @xcite . in this calculation",
    "we adopt the same eos for the computation of thermal nucleation time of the antikaon condensed phase and shear viscosity of nuclear matter .",
    "we organise the paper in the following way .",
    "we describe models for homogeneous nucleation , shear viscosity and eos in sec .",
    "results of this calculation are discussed in sec .",
    "iv gives the summary and conclusions .",
    "we consider a first - order phase transition from the charge neutral and beta - equilibrated nuclear matter to @xmath2 condensed matter in a hot neutron star after the emission of trapped neutrinos .",
    "droplets of antikaon condensed phase are formed in the metastable nuclear matter due to thermal fluctuations .",
    "droplets of antikaon condensed matter above a critical size are of interest because those critical droplets will drive the phase transition .",
    "we adopt the homogeneous nucleation formalism of langer to calculate the thermal nucleation rate @xcite . in this formalism , the thermal nucleation per unit time per unit volume is given by @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the change in the free energy to produce a critical droplet in the metastable nuclear matter .",
    "the change in free energy of the system due to the formation of a droplet is given by @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the radius of the droplet , @xmath8 is surface tension of the interface separating two phases and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the pressure in nuclear and antikaon condensed phases respectively .",
    "we obtain the critical radius of the droplet from the maximum of @xmath11 i.e. @xmath12 and it is @xmath13 the eos enters into this calculation through the difference in pressures of two phases .",
    "the prefactor in eq .",
    "( 1 ) is factorised in the following way @xcite @xmath14 the statistical prefactor ( @xmath15 ) gives the available phase space around the saddle point at @xmath16 during the passage of the droplet through it .",
    "the expression for the statistical prefactor is @xmath17 here @xmath18 is the correlation length for kaons .",
    "this correlation length is considered to be the width of the interface between nuclear and antikaon condensed matter .",
    "next we focus on the dynamical prefactor @xmath19 .",
    "this prefactor is responsible for the initial exponential growth rate of a critical droplet .",
    "it is given by @xcite @xmath20~.\\ ] ] here @xmath21 is the enthalpy difference of two phases whereas @xmath22 is thermal conductivity and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the shear and bulk viscosities of nuclear matter .",
    "it was shown that the latent heat would be taken away from the surface of the droplet due thermal dissipation and viscous damping @xcite .    finally the thermal nucleation time ( @xmath25 ) in the interior of neutron stars is calculated as @xmath26 where the volume @xmath27 .",
    "we assume that pressure and temperature are constant within this volume in the core .",
    "it is evident from eq .",
    "( 7 ) that the thermal nucleation time is inversely proportional to transport coefficients . in connection with the quark matter nucleation",
    ", it was noted that the contribution of thermal conductivity is not appreciable .",
    "further , we know that shear viscosity increases @xcite and bulk viscosity decreases @xcite as temperature decreases .",
    "after the emission of neutrinos a hot neutron star cools down , and the thermal nucleation drives the phase transition when the temperature is @xmath28 mev . in this temperature regime , shear viscosity might be an important factor .",
    "now we focus on the calculation of shear viscosity in neutron star matter .",
    "it was noted that the main contributions to the total shear viscosity in neutron star matter came from electrons , the lightest charged particles , and neutrons , the most abundant particles @xcite .",
    "recently the proton shear viscosity , though small , was considered in our calculation @xcite .",
    "we calculate shear viscosities for different particle species using coupled boltzmann transport equations @xcite .",
    "the effects of the exchange of transverse plasmons in the collisions of charged particles are included in this case @xcite .",
    "the knowledge of nucleon - nucleon scattering cross sections derived in the dirac - brueckner approach @xcite is used for the calculation of neutron and proton shear viscosities @xcite .",
    "contributions of neutrons , protons , electrons and muons to the total shear viscosity @xmath29 are given by @xcite @xmath30 here @xmath31 is the relaxation time of i - th species as calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite . effective",
    "mass and fermi momentum of i - th particle species are denoted by @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively . for electrons and muons ,",
    "effective masses are taken as their chemical potentials due to relativistic effects .",
    "we adopt a relativistic field theoretical model which is described in the following paragraphs , for the calculation effective masses and fermi momenta of neutrons and protons .    besides the computation of shear viscosities , the knowledge of the eos is essential for the thermal nucleation rate .",
    "we note that the eos enters into the calculation of thermal nucleation rate as given by eqs .",
    "( 1)-(3 ) .",
    "we adopt relativistic field theoretical models to describe the @xmath34 equilibrated matter in nuclear and antikaon condensed phases .",
    "those two phases are composed of neutrons , protons , electrons , muons and of @xmath2 mesons only in the antikaon condensed phase .",
    "both phases are governed by baryon number conservation and charge neutrality conditions @xcite . the baryon - baryon interaction mediated by the exchange of @xmath8 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 mesons",
    "is described by the lagrangian density @xcite @xmath37 the scalar self - interaction term @xcite is @xmath38 the effective nucleon mass is given by @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the vacuum baryon mass . the lagrangian density for ( anti)kaons in the minimal coupling is given by @xcite @xmath41 where the covariant derivative is @xmath42 and the effective mass of ( anti)kaons is @xmath43 .",
    "the in - medium energy of @xmath44 mesons is given by @xmath45 we consider the s - wave ( @xmath46 ) condensation .",
    "the condensation sets in when the chemical potential of @xmath2 mesons ( @xmath47 ) is equal to the electron chemical potential i.e. @xmath48 .",
    "the critical droplet of antikaon condensed matter is in total phase equilibrium with the metastable nuclear matter .",
    "the mixed phase is governed by gibbs phase rule along with global baryon number conservation and charge neutrality @xcite .",
    "two phases are in chemical equilibrium and the mechanical equilibrium is constrained by eq .",
    "we do not consider the variation of the meson fields in the droplet with position .",
    "this is known as the bulk approximation @xcite .",
    "we solve equations of motion self - consistently in the mean field approximation @xcite and find effective masses and fermi momenta of baryons .",
    "further we obtain the pressure in nuclear matter ( @xmath9 ) and in antikaon condensed matter ( @xmath10 ) as given by ref.@xcite .",
    "we adopt the glendenning and moszkowski parameter set known as gm1 @xcite for nucleon - meson coupling constants which are obtained by reproducing the saturation properties of nuclear matter such as binding energy @xmath49 mev , baryon density @xmath50 @xmath51 , asymmetry energy coefficient @xmath52 mev , incompressibility @xmath53 mev and effective nucleon mass @xmath54 .",
    "next we determine kaon - meson vector coupling constants using the quark model and isospin counting rule @xcite . and the scalar kaon - meson coupling constant is obtained from the real part of @xmath2 optical potential depth at normal nuclear matter density .",
    "heavy ion collision experiments and @xmath2 atomic data indicated an attractive potential for antikaons and a repulsive potential for kaons @xcite .",
    "however the strength of antikaon optical potential depth is a debatable issue .",
    "it was found from the analysis of @xmath2 atomic data that the real part of the antikaon optical potential could be as large as @xmath55 mev at normal nuclear matter density @xcite .",
    "but theoretical models including chirally motivated coupled channel models as well as double pole structure of @xmath56 could not find such a strongly attractive antikaon optical potential depth @xcite . in this calculation",
    "we take an antikaon optical potential depth of @xmath57 mev at normal nuclear matter density and obtain the kaon - scalar meson coupling constant @xmath58 .    here",
    "we study the thermal nucleation of antikaon condensed phase after the emission of trapped neutrinos followed by the evolution of a hot neutron star to the cold star .",
    "the stellar matter is heated during the diffusion of trapped neutrinos leading to the deleptonisation and maximum entropy per baryon @xmath59 .",
    "it would take about a few @xmath60 s for the maximally heated star to cool down to a temperature @xmath61 mev .",
    "the threshold for the appearance of antikaon condensate would be reduced after the deleptonisation .",
    "we demonstrate this evolution of a neutrino - free neutron star with a few snap - shots corresponding to entropy per baryon @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "we adopt the finite temperature calculation of ref.@xcite in this case .",
    "we show the temperature as a function of baryon density in nuclear matter for fixed @xmath64 and @xmath63 in fig .",
    "the temperature increases with baryon density .",
    "this shows that the temperature varies from a higher value in the core to a smaller value at the surface of a neutron star .",
    "the equations of state of neutrino free nuclear matter at fixed @xmath65 and @xmath63 are exhibited in fig .",
    "it is evident from fig .",
    "2 that the temperature of a few tens of mev does not modify the eos appreciably upto energy densities @xmath3 1000 mev @xmath51 relevant at the center of a neutron star , with respect to the zero temperature eos corresponding to the @xmath66 , case because the temperature is much less than the baryon chemical potential .",
    "therefore , we consider the zero temperature eos for the rest of our calculation .    the total shear viscosity in nuclear matter is shown as a function of normalised baryon density for different temperatures in fig .",
    "the shear viscosity decreases as temperature increases .",
    "further , the shear viscosity increases with increasing baryon density .",
    "it was earlier noted that the temperature dependence of shear viscosities corresponding to different particle species was a complicated one and manifested through relaxation times @xcite .",
    "this temperature dependence deviates from the characteristic temperature dependence , @xmath67 , of a fermi liquid @xcite .",
    "figure 3 shows the total shear viscosity for three temperatures @xmath68 1 , 10 , and 30 mev .",
    "we are interested in the temperature range from a few mev to a few tens of mev in this calculation .",
    "next our focus is on the prefactor ( @xmath69 ) of eq .",
    "( 4 ) which not only involves transport properties of nuclear matter such as thermal conductivity and shear and bulk viscosities but also depends on the correlation length of kaons and surface tension .",
    "the radius of the droplet is to be greater than the correlation length for kaons @xmath18 .",
    "otherwise many approximations in this calculation would collapse @xcite .",
    "the correlation length is also taken as the thickness of the interface between nuclear and kaon phases @xcite estimated to be @xmath3 5 fm @xcite . here",
    "we consider antikaon droplets with radii greater than 5 fm .",
    "the other important parameter in the prefactor is the surface tension .",
    "the surface tension between nuclear and kaon phases was already calculated by christiansen and collaborators @xcite .",
    "they found that the surface tension varied from a value of 30 mev @xmath1 at the start of the mixed phase to a value of 10 mev @xmath1 at the end of the mixed phase .",
    "it is evident from the fit of ref.@xcite that the surface tension is sensitive to the eos .",
    "it is to be noted that we have a different parameter set and stiffer eos than those of ref.@xcite .",
    "we perform this calculation for a set of values of surface tension @xmath70 10 , 15 and 20 mev @xmath1 .",
    "further , we approximate the difference in enthalpy densities ( @xmath71 ) in eq .",
    "( 6 ) as the difference of energy densities because the pressure difference is negligible compared with the difference in energy densities @xcite .",
    "the prefactor ( @xmath69 ) is shown as a function of temperature in fig .",
    "the prefactor is calculated at a baryon density @xmath72 and surface tension @xmath73 mev @xmath1 .",
    "the density chosen here is just above the critical density for the transition .",
    "we calculate the prefactor for two values of correlation length @xmath742 and 5 fm .",
    "solid lines correspond to the calculation of prefactor including the shear viscosity term and neglecting the thermal conductivity and bulk viscosity terms in eq .",
    "on the other hand , dashed lines imply the prefactor including only the thermal conductivity term .",
    "the thermal conductivity is calculated according to ref.@xcite .",
    "the prefactor involving the shear viscosity term is a few orders of magnitude higher than that of the thermal conductivity for both values of kaon correlation length .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that the contributions of thermal conductivity and bulk viscosity in the prefactor were neglected in an earlier calculation of quark matter nucleation @xcite .",
    "we observe that the prefactor for @xmath745 fm is substantially reduced from that of @xmath742 fm in both cases . in the following paragraphs",
    "we discuss the results of our calculation performed with the prefactor involving only the shear viscosity term .",
    "the prefactor of eq .",
    "( 4 ) was approximated by @xmath0 according to the dimensional analysis in some calculations @xcite .",
    "this approximation might differ considerably from the actual calculation of the prefactor .",
    "5 shows the prefactor of eq .",
    "( 4 ) including only the contribution of shear viscosity along with the prefactor approximated by @xmath0 as a function of temperature .",
    "it is evident from figure 5 that the approximated prefactor is several orders of magnitude smaller than the prefactor calculated according to eq .",
    "( 4 ) at lower temperatures .",
    "however , this difference between two calculations is reduced appreciably at higher temperatures .",
    "it remains to be seen how two calculations of the prefactor influence the thermal nucleation time .",
    "now we discuss the nucleation time of a critical droplet of antikaon condensed matter calculated with the prefactor of eq .",
    "( 4 ) involving only the shear viscosity contribution .",
    "the critical radius of the droplet is obtained from the relation in eq . ( 3 ) .",
    "the droplet which overcomes the maximum height of the energy barrier of eq .",
    "( 1 ) occurring at the critical radius , grows exponentially .",
    "such a droplet triggers the onset of antikaon condensation in the interior of a neutron star . for surface tension @xmath70 10 mev @xmath1",
    ", we obtain an antikaon droplet with critical radius 6.32 fm at baryon density 2.3@xmath75 .",
    "this density is just above the critical density for transition from nuclear matter to the droplet of antikaon condensed matter where the volume fraction of the antikaon condensed phase is approaching zero .",
    "we perform the calculation of thermal nucleation of the critical droplet within a volume with @xmath76 m in the core of a neutron star as mentioned in eq .",
    "it is assumed that density , pressure and temperature are constant within this volume . the thermal nucleation time is plotted with temperature in fig .",
    "results shown here are calculated with the kaon correlation length @xmath77 5 fm . for the above - mentioned case , the nucleation time of the critical droplet drops as temperature increases . for the case of @xmath70 10 mev @xmath1 ,",
    "the nucleation time is 1 s at a temperature of @xmath7810 mev .",
    "we also estimate thermal nucleation times of critical antikaon droplets for two other values of surface tension @xmath79 15 and 20 mev @xmath1 .",
    "it is noted that the size of the critical droplet increases with increasing surface tension .",
    "radii of the critical droplets are 9.48 and 12.6 fm corresponding to @xmath79 15 and 20 mev @xmath1 , respectively , at a density 2.3@xmath75 .",
    "we find a similar trend of the nucleation time with temperature in these cases .",
    "however , the temperature corresponding to a particular nucleation time for example , 1 s , increases as the surface tension increases .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that the condensate might melt if the temperature is higher than the critical temperature @xcite .",
    "we compare thermal nucleation times corresponding to different values of the surface tension with the cooling time of a protoneutron star @xmath80 a few @xmath60 s. thermal nucleation of the antikaon condensed phase may be possible when the thermal nucleation time is less than the cooling time .",
    "it is evident from fig . 6",
    "that the thermal nucleation time is strongly dependent on the surface tension .",
    "thermal nucleation of an antikaon droplet is a possibility for surface tension @xmath81 20 mev @xmath1 because in this case the thermal nucleation time is less than the cooling time at a temperature which might be below the critical temperature of antikaon condensation @xcite .",
    "we repeat the calculation of the thermal nucleation time with the correlation length @xmath742 fm and find that the thermal nucleation time is slightly higher than that of @xmath745 fm over the whole temperature regime considered here .",
    "we compare the results of thermal nucleation time taking into account the effect of shear viscosity in the prefactor with that of the prefactor approximated by @xmath0 .",
    "these results are shown in fig . 7 for surface tension @xmath70 10 mev @xmath1 and at a density @xmath82 2.30@xmath75 .",
    "the results of the @xmath0 approximation are a few orders of magnitude higher than those of our calculation .",
    "for example , the thermal nucleation time is 1 s at @xmath78 10 mev in our case , whereas it is @xmath83 s at the same temperature for the @xmath0 approximated case .",
    "these results demonstrate the importance of including the shear viscosity in the prefactor of eq .",
    "( 4 ) in the calculation of thermal nucleation time .",
    "we have investigated the first - order phase transition from nuclear matter to antikaon condensed matter through the thermal nucleation of a critical droplet of anikaon condensed matter .",
    "our main focus in this calculation is the role of shear viscosity in the prefactor and its consequences on the thermal nucleation rate .",
    "we adopt the same eos derived in the relativistic mean field model for the calculation of shear viscosity and thermal nucleation rate . in this connection , we have constructed critical droplets of antikaon condensed matter above the critical density for different values of surface tension .",
    "droplet radii increase with increasing surface tension .",
    "we obtain thermal nucleation time as a function of temperature for a set of values of surface tension and find that the thermal nucleation time is strongly dependent on the surface tension .",
    "our results show that thermal nucleation of a critical antikaon droplet could be possible during the cooling stage of a hot neutron star after neutrinos are emitted for a lower value of surface tension @xmath81 20 mev @xmath1 .",
    "further , a comparison of our results with that of the @xmath0 approximation shows that the @xmath0 approximation overestimates our results of thermal nucleation time .",
    "this comparison highlights the importance of shear viscosity in our calculation .",
    "we have considered the thermal nucleation in a nonrotating neutron star and neglected the bulk viscosity in the prefactor .",
    "however neutron stars rotate very fast at birth .",
    "they emit gravitational waves and become r - mode unstable @xcite .",
    "the bulk viscosity plays an important role in damping the r - mode instability",
    ". the bulk viscosity might dominate over the shear viscosity above 10 mev @xcite",
    ". it would be interesting to investigate the effect of bulk viscosity on the thermal nucleation time in a rotating neutron star along with that of shear viscosity .",

    "<S> we investigate a first - order phase transition from hadronic matter to antikaon condensed matter during the cooling stage of protoneutron stars . </S>",
    "<S> the phase transition proceeds through the thermal nucleation of antikaon condensed matter . in this connection we study the effect of shear viscosity on the thermal nucleation rate of droplets of antikaon condensed matter . </S>",
    "<S> here we adopt the same equation of state for the calculation of shear viscosity and thermal nucleation time . </S>",
    "<S> we compute the shear viscosity of neutron star matter composed of neutrons , protons , electrons and muons using the relativistic mean field model . </S>",
    "<S> the prefactor in the nucleation rate which includes the shear viscosity , is enhanced by several orders of magnitude compared with the @xmath0 approximation of earlier calculations . </S>",
    "<S> consequently the thermal nucleation time in the @xmath0 approximation overestimates our result . </S>",
    "<S> further the thermal nucleation of an antikaon droplet might be possible in our case for surface tension smaller than 20 mev @xmath1 . </S>"
