    "we will consider a combined gravity and matter system in ads@xmath0 , where we will not specify the microscopic matter content in detail .",
    "we assume that the matter sector can effectively produce a source of pressureless dust .",
    "hence we will consider einstein s equation with negative cosmological constant @xmath1 : r_ab - r g_ab- g_ab= 8 g t_ab , [ einsteineqns ] where @xmath2 is the 2 + 1 dimensional newton constant , @xmath3 is the ads@xmath0 radius and we take t_ab = u_a u_b , [ dustsource ] with @xmath4 a unit timelike vector and @xmath5 a dimensionless number parametrizing the energy density .",
    "we will now solve ( [ einsteineqns ] ) for a homogeneous ball of rotating dust , where we take the energy density @xmath5 to be nonzero and constant inside the ball and zero outside .",
    "inside the ball , the metric will be that of gdel space , while outside we expect a metric of generalized btz type characterized by a mass @xmath6 and angular momentum @xmath7 .",
    "this leads to the following ansatz for our matching problem . on the inside",
    ", we have the gdel space metric ds_-^2=l^2.[godelcoords ] where @xmath8 runs between 0 and @xmath9 , the radius where the dust region ends .",
    "the angular coordinate @xmath10 is identified with period @xmath11 .",
    "the einstein equations ( [ einsteineqns]),([dustsource ] ) determine @xmath12 in terms of the density of the dust as = 11-[enden ] .",
    "the physical values are @xmath13 , for positive energy , and @xmath14 , for a minkowski signature of the resulting metric .",
    "note that for @xmath15 , @xmath16 , the metric describes global ads@xmath0 .",
    "when @xmath17 exceeds the critical value @xmath18 , ctcs appear since @xmath19 becomes a timelike vector in the region @xmath20 .    outside of the dust ball , we take take a metric ansatz which is a vacuum solution to ( [ einsteineqns ] ) and which generalizes the btz metric : ds_+^2 & = & l^2 , f(u ) & = & u^2 - m u + j^2 4 .",
    "[ genbtz ] the angle @xmath21 is identified with period @xmath22 and the real parameters @xmath23 are the adm mass and angular momentum ( in convenient units ) respectively .",
    "the function @xmath24 is related to the determinant of the induced metric @xmath25 on a surface of constant @xmath4 by @xmath26 .",
    "let us review the properties of this class of metrics in the various regions of @xmath27 parameter space .    in the region @xmath28 , which we will call region i ,",
    "the metrics ( [ genbtz ] ) describe btz black holes @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath24 has two positive real zeroes , which correspond to the inner and outer horizons . unlike their 3 + 1 dimensional cousins , btz black holes have no curvature singularities . instead , in the region @xmath29",

    "the function @xmath24 has two negative real zeroes , between which the signature of the metric becomes euclidean .",
    "one can verify that at the largest zero @xmath33 , the metric has a conical singularity arising from a pointlike source .",

    "finally , for @xmath37 , denoted by region iii , the metric describes an overspinning object .",
    "the function @xmath24 has no real zeroes and the metric is free of curvature singularities .",
    "the range of @xmath4 is the real line and the space contains a ` naked ' ctc region for negative values of @xmath4 .",
    "let us now briefly discuss part of the ads / cft dictionary .",
    "the virasoro quantum numbers of the spaces ( [ genbtz ] ) can be extracted following the standard procedure of computing the renormalized boundary stress tensor and extracting its fourier coefficients @xcite .",
    "one finds that these spaces correspond to states with conformal weights l_0 & = & c 24 ( m+ j + 1 ) , +    @xcite c = 3 l 2 g. [ bh ] unitarity implies that conformal weights in the cft are positive , leading to the bound @xmath38 . in terms of @xmath6 and @xmath7 ,",
    "this is equivalent to m+1 |j|.[unitbound ] states violating this bound are forbidden by unitarity and , according to the ads / cft conjecture , can not be part of the spectrum in a consistent quantum gravity theory on @xmath39 .",
    "we will now match the inside metric for @xmath40 to the outside metric for @xmath41 for arbitrary values of the parameters @xmath42 and @xmath17 . since both metrics have a single @xmath43 identification on the coordinates @xmath44 respectively , the coordinates @xmath45 and @xmath46 have to be related as follows t & = & c_1 t , [ time ] + & = & c_2 t + [ ang ] , with @xmath47 two constants .",
    "the israel matching conditions @xcite require that the metric and the extrinsic curvature are continuous across the edge of the dust ball : .",
    "if @xmath48 is large compared to @xmath2 but small compared to @xmath3 , both curvature corrections ( suppressed by @xmath49 ) and deviations from our solution ( suppressed by @xmath50 ) remain small . ]",
    "h^-_ij & = & h^+_ij,[cont ] + k^-_ij & = & k^+_ij.[matchingcond ] here @xmath51 ( @xmath25 ) is the induced metric on the @xmath52 @xmath53 boundary surface and @xmath54 are the corresponding extrinsic curvatures .",
    "the conditions ( [ cont]),([matchingcond ] ) give 6 equations for the five undetermined parameters @xmath55 in terms of the two physical parameters @xmath56 of the ball of dust .",
    "after some algebra one can check that there are 2 solutions : j & = & [ j ] , + m & = & -[m ] , + u_0 & = & [ u0 ] , + c_1 & = & ( 1-)[c1 ] , + c_2&=&1 .",
    "[ c2 ] the two solutions have opposite angular momentum and are related by a change of sign for the angular coordinates @xmath57 .",
    "we will fix this freedom in what follows by taking @xmath7 to be positive , choosing the positive sign in these equations .",
    "let us now discuss the physical properties of the matched solution ( [ j])-([c2 ] ) .",
    "first we examine how the @xmath58 parameter space is mapped into the @xmath27 plane . as mentioned before @xmath59 take values in @xmath60 .",
    "their relation to @xmath27 is clearly not onto and also not injective , as the jacobian of the map vanishes at @xmath61 .",
    "it turns out that there are two branches in the @xmath27 plane , depending on whether the dust density @xmath5 is greater or smaller than @xmath62 .",
    "more precisely the two branches are    * branch a @xmath63 : + j-1m-1 + 2-j&j , + j-1mj & j. * branch b @xmath64 : -1 + 2-jmj .    these branches are shown in figure [ jmfig ] and we will now discuss them in more detail .    within branch",
    "a , for values of @xmath65 ( i.e. in the region a@xmath66 in figure [ jmfig ] ) , the outside metric is of type ii ( conical defect ) .",
    "note that there are two limits where the outside becomes the ads@xmath0 vacuum .",
    "one is simply setting @xmath67 .",
    "there is only an outside space in this case , as @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "this outside space covers all of global ads@xmath0 .",
    "the second limit is taking the energy density of the dust to be zero , @xmath70 .",
    "now both the inside and outside metric become a patch of global ads@xmath0 , albeit in different coordinate systems .",
    "the gluing conditions ( [ ang ] ) , ( [ u0 ] ) simply reduce to the appropriate coordinate transformation relating the two coordinate systems . for values of @xmath42 and @xmath17 lying in the region",
    "a@xmath71 in figure [ jmfig ] , the outside metric is of type iii ( overspinning object ) . within branch",
    "b , the outside metric is always also of type iii . on the line @xmath72 where branch a meets branch",
    "b , @xmath6 becomes equal to @xmath7 and the outside metric is formally of type i , describing an extremal btz black hole .",
    "the edge of the dust ball @xmath73 coincides precisely with the black hole horizon . since on",
    "this line @xmath74 becomes zero ( [ c1 ] ) , the redshift between the ads time and the gdel time becomes infinite and the glueing singular .",
    "already in @xcite it was observed that glueings to a dust region can not give rise to outside metrics of type i.    now we address the issue of closed timelike curves in our matched solutions .",
    "remember that a priori we have two regions in which closed timelike curves can appear in the solution .",
    "the inside part of the metric ( gdel space ) has ctcs when @xmath75 , the outside metric when @xmath76 . but observe that by ( [ u0 ] ) these two conditions are equivalent , hence either no closed timelike curves appear at all , or they appear both in the inside and outside parts of the metric . in parameter space these closed timelike curves can only appear in part of branch b , wich is denoted as region b@xmath71 in figure [ jmfig ] .",
    "hence on branch b , ctcs can be made to appear by smoothly varying the parameters @xmath77 , while the solutions remain seemingly well behaved in all other respects .",
    "now let us discuss the unitarity bound ( [ unitbound ] ) , which gives an extra constraint on which outside metrics are physically acceptable . on branch",
    "a , all the outside metrics satisfy the unitarity bound , while branch b is divided into a region where the bound is satisfied and one where it is violated .",
    "in fact , the bound for the absence of ctcs @xmath78 precisely coincides with the unitarity bound @xmath79 .",
    "this can be seen directly as by ( [ j ] ) , ( [ m ] ) m+1-|j|=.hence the condition of unitarity is equivalent to that of the absence of closed timelike curves .",
    "in this letter , we have discussed an example where the appearance of ctcs in a gdel region within ads@xmath0 was shown to precisely coincide with the violation of a unitarity bound in the dual cft . based on our result and other examples in the literature @xcite",
    ", it would be natural to propose an ads version of the chronology protection conjecture , stating that regions with ctcs in ads spaces can not be formed as a result of any unitary process .",
    "the ads / cft correspondence could in principle be used to address whether this proposal is true in general .",
    "if so , it would be very interesting to gain insight into the deeper dynamical mechanism that prevents the formation of regions with ctcs , see e.g. @xcite for some proposals in the context of string theory .",

    "<S> we give a simple nonsupersymmetric example in which chronology protection follows from unitarity and the ads / cft correspondence . </S>",

    "<S> when the radius of the dust ball exceeds a certain critical value , the spacetime will contain closed timelike curves . </S>",
    "<S> our main observation is that precisely when this critical radius is exceeded , a unitarity bound in the dual cft is violated , leading to a holographic argument for chronology protection .    </S>",
    "<S> kurt gdel was the first to emphasize that einstein s equation , in the presence of seemingly innocuous matter sources , can lead to causality violating geometries containing closed timelike curves ( ctcs ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since then , classical solutions with ctcs have popped up ubiquitously , including supersymmetic versions of gdel space in supergravity theories , both in 3 + 1 dimensions as well as in their higher - dimensional parent theories @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such spacetimes lead to a variety of pathologies , both within classical general relativity as well as for interacting quantum fields propagating on them ( see @xcite for a review and further references ) . </S>",
    "<S> this led hawking to propose the chronology protection conjecture , stating that regions containing ctcs can not be formed in any physical process @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is expected @xcite that a fully consistent treatment of such a dynamical argument behind chronology protection requires the issue to be addressed in a quantum theory where both matter and gravity itself are quantized .    the ads / cft correspondence @xcite proposes that combined quantum gravity and matter systems on anti - de - sitter ( ads ) spaces have a holographic dual description in terms of a unitary conformal field theory ( cft ) in one lower dimension . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore ideally suited to study the issue of chronology protection in asymptotically ads spaces . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , several examples are known @xcite where the appearance of ctcs in a bps sector of the bulk theory is quantum mechanically forbidden as it would correspond to the violation of a unitarity bound in the dual cft . in this letter , we show that a similar conclusion holds for 2 + 1 dimensional gdel space and give a simple argument that creating a patch of gdel space large enough to contain ctcs would require violating unitarity in the dual cft . </S>",
    "<S> an important novel feature of our example is that it does nt rely on supersymmetry but only on the general properties of gravity theories on ads@xmath0 that were established in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , our argument only relies on the fact that , in a unitary cft , all states have nonnegative conformal weights .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now outline our argument . </S>",
    "<S> gdel s original 3 + 1 dimensional solution is the product of a nontrivial 2 + 1 dimensional space and a line , and we will here consider only the 2 + 1 dimensional part , henceforth referred to as gdel space . </S>",
    "<S> gdel space is a solution of 2 + 1 dimensional anti - de - sitter gravity with a source of homogeneous rotating dust . </S>",
    "<S> the dust needs to rotate in ads@xmath0 in order to be stationary , since otherwise it would collapse to form either a conical defect or a btz black hole depending on its total mass @xcite . we will consider a 2 dimensional ball ( i.e. a disc ) of such rotating dust placed in global ads@xmath0 and give a detailed analysis of the resulting geometry . </S>",
    "<S> the metric inside the ball is that of gdel space , and the one outside a generalized btz metric @xcite describing an object with mass and angular momentum which we determine by solving a matching problem ( a similar 3 + 1 dimensional problem was considered in @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the ads / cft dictionary then tells us the quantum numbers of the dust ball in the dual cft . </S>",
    "<S> when we vary the radius of the dust ball while keeping the energy density of the dust constant , ctcs appear when the radius exceeds a critical value . </S>",
    "<S> the main question we want to address is what this critical radius corresponds to in the dual cft . </S>",
    "<S> we will see that it corresponds precisely to the unitarity bound stating that conformal weights in the cft have to be nonnegative , implying that the formation of a dust ball containing ctcs is forbidden by unitarity . </S>"
