    "in recent years , there has been much interest in the gravitational collapse of matter to a black hole . although both analytical @xcite and intensive numerical studies ( see e.g.  @xcite ) have given some understanding of how the event horizon and the singularity form , little is known about the asymptotic form of the black hole as @xmath0 .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that standard numerical methods become unreliable after the solutions have formed singularities .",
    "since all matter on a microscopic level is formed out of dirac particles , it seems especially interesting to study the asymptotic collapse of a `` cloud '' of spin-@xmath1-particles . as a first step towards this goal , in this paper we study dirac particles in a reissner - nordstrm background field .",
    "we remark that considerable work has been done in the study of quantum mechanical wave equations in the presence of black holes .",
    "the papers which are most related are @xcite , where a massless dirac particle is considered in a schwarzschild metric background , and asymptotic completeness is shown for the scattering states near the event horizon and at infinity .",
    "however , the most physically interesting case of a massive dirac particle near a charged black hole has not yet been considered . as we will see here ,",
    "both the rest mass of the dirac particle and the charge of the black hole lead to interesting physical effects and require new analytical tools .",
    "in polar coordinates @xmath2 , the reissner - nordstrm metric has the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the charge of the black hole and @xmath5 its ( adm ) mass .",
    "furthermore , we have an external electromagnetic potential @xmath6 of the form @xmath7 with the coulomb potential @xmath8 if @xmath9 , the metric has two horizons ; this is the so - called _ non - extreme case_. if @xmath10 , the metric has only one horizon at @xmath11 ; this _ extreme case _ describes a black hole at zero temperature ; cf .   @xcite . for @xmath12",
    ", the metric does not describe a black hole , and thus this case will not be considered .",
    "we describe the dirac particles with `` classical '' wave functions ( i.e.  without second quantization ) .",
    "both the gravitational and electric fields are coupled to the dirac particles .",
    "_ we do not assume any spatial symmetry on the wave functions .",
    "_ near a collapsing black hole , it seems reasonable that that some of the dirac particles could get into static or time - periodic states .",
    "our main result is to show that this is not possible .    in the following",
    "we will restrict to time - periodic solutions , noting that static solutions are a special case .",
    "for classical point particles , the time - periodic solutions describe closed orbits of particles rotating around the black hole .",
    "our goal is to investigate how this classical picture changes by the introduction of relativistic wave mechanics and spin .",
    "since the phase of the dirac wave function @xmath13 is of no physical significance , we say that @xmath13 is _ periodic with period @xmath14 _ if @xmath15 for some real @xmath16 .",
    "our main result in the non - extreme case is the following theorem :    [ thm1 ] in a non - extreme reissner - nordstrm black - hole background , there are no normalizable , periodic solutions of the dirac equation .    in the extreme case , we prove a slightly weaker statement :    [ thm2 ] in an extreme reissner - nordstrm background , every normalizable , time - periodic solution of the dirac equation vanishes identically for @xmath17 .",
    "this surprising result shows that the classical picture breaks down completely ; for dirac particles , there are no periodic solutions .",
    "this means that dirac particles which are attracted by a reissner - nordstrm black hole either `` fall into '' the singularity or escape to infinity , but they can not stay on a periodic orbit around the black hole .",
    "the result can also be applied to the dirac particles of the matter in the gravitational collapse ; it then indicates that all the matter must eventually disappear in the black hole .    basically , our result is a consequence of the heisenberg uncertainty principle and of the particular form of the dirac current . as a preparatory step ,",
    "we analyze the behavior of the dirac wave functions near the event horizon and we derive conditions which relate the wave function outside and inside the horizon .",
    "it is essential for our methods and results that the particles have spin .",
    "this shows that the spin is an important effect to be taken into account in the study of gravitational collapse .    in the remainder of this section , we give some basic formulas needed to describe dirac particles in curved space - time ( for a more detailed introduction to the classical dirac theory in curved space - time see @xcite ) .",
    "in this paper , the dirac equation is always of the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the rest mass of the particle , @xmath20 the electromagnetic potential , and @xmath21 the electromagnetic coupling constant ( see @xcite , @xcite for a derivation of this equation ) .",
    "the dirac matrices @xmath22 are real linear combinations of the usual @xmath23-matrices .",
    "we work in the dirac representation @xmath24 where @xmath25 denote the pauli matrices .",
    "the dirac matrices are related to the lorentzian metric via the anti - commutation relations @xmath26 the term @xmath27 in ( [ eq:0 ] ) is the divergence with respect to the levi - civita connection ; it can be easily computed via the standard formula @xmath28 for the normalization of the wave functions , one takes a space - like hypersurface @xmath29 with normal vector field @xmath30 and considers the scalar product @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the adjoint spinor , and where @xmath33 is the invariant measure on @xmath29 induced by the lorentzian metric . on solutions of the dirac equation",
    ", we impose the normalization condition @xmath34 current conservation @xmath35 implies that this normalization condition remains unchanged if the hypersurface @xmath29 is continuously deformed .",
    "we begin by analyzing the dirac operator in a schwarzschild background metric .",
    "our aim is to analyze the behavior of the spinors near the event horizon . to do this",
    ", we must consider the dirac equation in different coordinate systems",
    ".      in polar coordinates @xmath36 , the schwarzschild metric is @xmath37 where @xmath5 is the ( adm ) mass .",
    "the metric has an event horizon at @xmath38 . in order to derive the dirac operator",
    ", we first choose dirac matrices @xmath22 satisfying the anti - commutation relations ( [ eq:2a ] ) .",
    "the dirac operator is then obtained by calculating the divergence ( [ eq:01 ] ) and substituting into ( [ eq:0])-matrices which satisfy ( [ eq:2a ] ) .",
    "but the dirac operators corresponding to different choices of the dirac matrices are equivalent in the sense that they can be obtained from each other by a suitable local transformation of the spinors ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "for this reason , we can simply choose the @xmath39 in the way which is most convenient to us . ] .",
    "outside the horizon , we can satisfy the anti - commutation relations ( [ eq:2a ] ) by choosing the dirac matrices in the form @xmath40 with @xmath41 where @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 are the `` @xmath23-matrices in polar coordinates '' @xmath46 the divergence of the dirac matrices is computed to be @xmath47 substituting into ( [ eq:0 ] ) , we obtain for the dirac operator , @xmath48 , in the region @xmath49",
    "@xmath50 for the normalization , we integrate over the hypersurface @xmath51 ; i.e. @xmath52 where @xmath53 denotes the ball of radius @xmath54 around the origin .",
    "this normalization integral is problematic near the event horizon , as will be discussed in detail later . inside the horizon",
    ", we must take into account that the radial direction @xmath55 is time - like , whereas @xmath56 is a space coordinate .",
    "so in this region , to obtain the dirac matrices , we reverse the roles of the matrices @xmath42 and @xmath43 , @xmath57 the divergence of the dirac matrices now has the form @xmath58 thus the dirac operator , @xmath59 , in the region @xmath60 is given by @xmath61 according to ( [ eq : f ] ) , the naive extension of the normalization integral ( [ eq:2 ] ) to the interior of the horizon is @xmath62 this will also be discussed in detail later .",
    "notice that as a particular freedom in the choice of the dirac matrices , the signs in ( [ eq : d ] ) and ( [ eq : e ] ) are arbitrary .",
    "as remarked above , this arbitrariness can be compensated by a suitable local transformation of the spinors . however",
    ", this transformation of the spinors may change the sign of the scalar product ( [ eq : f ] ) .",
    "this is a subtle point which needs some explanation .",
    "assume that we consider the space - like hypersurface outside the horizon @xmath63 its normal vector field @xmath30 is only determined up to a sign .",
    "depending on whether we choose for @xmath30 the future or past directed normals , the corresponding scalar product ( [ eq : f ] ) will ( for a fixed choice of the dirac matrices @xmath39 ) be either positive or negative ( semi-)definite .",
    "however , the overall sign of the scalar product is of no physical relevance ; e.g. , we could just redefine ( [ eq : f ] ) by inserting a minus sign . in order to fix the sign convention",
    ", we will in the following always assume that the scalar product ( [ eq : f ] ) is positive for the future - directed normal vector field ( this convention is consistent with our choices ( [ eq : d ] ) and ( [ eq:2 ] ) ) .",
    "the situation becomes more interesting if we also look at the region inside the horizon .",
    "for this , we consider the `` cylindric '' space - like hypersurface @xmath64 for some fixed @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "a short computation shows that , for our choice of the dirac matrices ( [ eq : e ] ) , the scalar product ( [ eq : f ] ) corresponding to @xmath67 is positive if we choose for @xmath30 the inner normal ( pointing towards the singularity at @xmath68 ) . according to our sign convention",
    ", this means that the inward radial direction points to the future .",
    "thus the particles `` fall into '' the singularity as time progresses , and we have a _ black hole_. on the other hand , we could have chosen the dirac matrices such that the scalar product corresponding to @xmath67 is positive for the outer normal ( e.g.  by changing the sign of @xmath69 in ( [ eq : e ] ) ) . in this case , increasing @xmath55 would correspond to going forward in time , and we would have a _ white hole_. notice that this argument is consistent with time reversals .",
    "namely , the replacement @xmath70 forces us to change the sign of the scalar product ( [ eq : f ] ) ( in order that ( [ eq : f ] ) is still positive for @xmath71 and future - directed normals ) . as a consequence , the scalar product corresponding to @xmath67 changes sign",
    "this means that black holes become white holes and vice versa .",
    "we conclude that the dirac operators @xmath48 and @xmath59 distinguish between a black and a white hole .",
    "this is a peculiar effect of the dirac operator .",
    "it is quite different from e.g.  the wave operator describing scalar fields ( the klein - gordon operator ) , which does not determine the direction of time inside the horizon .",
    "our description of the spinors in polar coordinates is not quite satisfactory .",
    "first of all , the normalization integral inside the horizon , ( [ eq:4 ] ) , is not definite .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the @xmath56-variable is space - like inside the horizon . from the mathematical point of view",
    ", this is no problem ; it seems tempting to just integrate across the horizon by adding ( [ eq:2 ] ) and ( [ eq:4 ] ) . on the other hand , it is a conceptual difficulty that the integrand in ( [ eq:4 ] ) is not positive and therefore does not have the interpretation as a probability density .",
    "furthermore , the dirac equations corresponding to @xmath48 and @xmath59 separately describe the wave functions outside and inside the horizon .",
    "but it is not clear how to match the wave functions on the horizon . for a better understanding of these issues , it is useful to remove the singularity of the metric on the horizon by transforming to kruskal coordinates .      according to @xcite , we introduce kruskal coordinates @xmath72 and @xmath73 by @xmath74 \\displaystyle \\sqrt{1-\\frac{r}{2\\rho } } \\:e^{\\frac{r}{4\\rho } } \\:\\sinh \\left ( \\frac{t}{4\\rho}\\right ) & { \\mbox{for $ r<2\\rho$ } } \\end{array } \\right .",

    "\\end{array } \\right . \\label{eq:11d}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the regions @xmath49 outside and @xmath60 inside the horizon are mapped into @xmath75 and @xmath76 respectively ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the horizon @xmath38 corresponds to the origin @xmath77 , and the lines @xmath78 are reached in the limit @xmath79 .",
    "finally , the singularity at @xmath68 corresponds to the hyperbola @xmath80 , @xmath81 .    in kruskal coordinates @xmath82 , the schwarzschild metric takes the form @xmath83 this metric is regular except at the singularity @xmath80 ; it can be extended to the entire region @xmath84 .",
    "since the metric is regular at the origin , we can smoothly extend the dirac operator across the horizon . to do this",
    ", we simply view @xmath73 and @xmath72 as the time and space variables , respectively .",
    "we choose for the dirac matrices @xmath85 a straightforward computation yields for the dirac operator @xmath86 the normalization integrals ( [ eq:2 ] ) and ( [ eq:4 ] ) on the surface @xmath87 correspond in kruskal coordinates to the integral ( [ eq : f ] ) with @xmath88 we choose the normal @xmath30 as in figure [ fig1 ] . using the current conservation ( [ 15a ] ) , one can continuously deform the hypersurface @xmath29 without changing the value of the normalization integral . in particular , we can avoid integrating across the horizon by choosing the hypersurface @xmath89 in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "this is a major advantage of kruskal coordinates ; it gives a physically reasonable positive normalization integral even inside the event horizon .",
    "however , this method must be done with care when the considered solution of the dirac equation has singularities near the origin .",
    "unfortunately , our time - periodic solutions of the dirac equation will , after transforming to kruskal coordinates , in general be highly singular at the origin .",
    "therefore the deformation of the hypersurface as in figure  [ fig1 ] would be problematic , and we will not use this method . in order to avoid any difficulties of the normalization integral near the horizon ,",
    "_ we shall only consider the normalization integral outside and away from the event horizon_.      we now consider how the dirac operator ( [ eq:1 ] ) , ( [ eq:3 ] ) in polar coordinates transforms into the dirac operator ( [ eq:5 ] ) in kruskal coordinates .",
    "this transformation consists of transforming both the space - time coordinates and the spinors . for clarity , we perform these transformations in two separate steps . under the transformation of the space - time coordinates ,",
    "the partial derivatives transform as @xmath90          \\displaystyle -\\frac{1}{4 \\rho \\:s^2 } \\left ( v \\:\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial           v } \\:+\\ : u \\:\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u } \\right ) & { \\mbox{for           $ r<2\\rho \\;\\;\\ ; .$ } } \\end{array } \\right.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] substituting into ( [ eq:1 ] ) and ( [ eq:3 ] ) gives for the dirac operators @xmath48 and @xmath59 in kruskal coordinates @xmath91 these dirac operators do not coincide with ( [ eq:5 ] ) , and we must therefore perform a further transformation ; namely a transformation of the spinors . under general coordinate transformations ,",
    "the wave functions transform according to @xmath92 in the case considered here , @xmath93 is the time - dependent @xmath94 matrix @xmath95 under this transformation , the dirac operators @xmath96 transform as @xmath97 this gives the dirac operator ( [ eq:5 ] ) in kruskal coordinates , @xmath98 and this can be verified as follows : under the transformation ( [ eq:29 ] ) , the dirac matrices behave like @xmath99 using the form of the dirac matrices in ( [ eq:12a ] ) , ( [ eq:12b ] ) and the explicit formula ( [ eq:10 ] ) , a short calculation shows that the dirac matrices of the operators @xmath100 coincide with the dirac matrices @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 in ( [ eq:5 ] ) . according to ( [ eq:0 ] )",
    ", the dirac operator in the gravitational field is formed from the dirac matrices and their covariant derivatives ; it is thus completely determined by the dirac matrices .",
    "therefore , the operators @xmath103 must coincide with @xmath104 .",
    "( one can also verify explicitly that the zero order terms of the operators @xmath103 and @xmath104 are equal .",
    "this is a longer computation , however . )",
    "we conclude that the dirac operators @xmath48 and @xmath59 can be identified with the dirac operator @xmath104 in the region @xmath105 .",
    "we remark that it is not possible to map the interior of the horizon into the region @xmath106 and still match the dirac operator @xmath59 with @xmath104 , because this would contradict the fact discussed in the previous section that the dirac operator distinguishes between black and white holes .",
    "finally , we note that the transformation ( [ eq:28]),([eq:29 ] ) of the spinors can be viewed as a local @xmath107 gauge transformation ; see @xcite .",
    "we now come to the question of how the wave functions inside and outside the horizon are related to each other . for this",
    ", we analyze the behavior of solutions of the dirac equation at the origin in kruskal coordinates . after transforming back to polar coordinates",
    ", this will give matching conditions for the wave functions on the event horizon .",
    "the physical situation which we have in mind is a dirac particle attracted by a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "it suffices to do the matching for static solutions , ( and not time - periodic solutions ) , since in section  [ sec4 ] , we reduce the problem to static solutions .",
    "let @xmath13 be a static wave function , i.e.  in polar coordinates @xmath108 we assume that @xmath109 is a smooth function both inside and outside the horizon ; i.e.  in the regions @xmath110 and @xmath111 ; this will be justified later by a separation of variables technique .",
    "furthermore , we assume that @xmath13 is a solution of the dirac equations @xmath112 and @xmath113 , respectively .",
    "according to the transformation rules ( [ eq:28]),([eq:10 ] ) , the wave function @xmath13 in kruskal coordinates takes the form @xmath114 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are given implicitly in terms of @xmath72 and @xmath73 by @xmath115          \\displaystyle \\frac{u}{v } & { \\mbox{for $ r < 2 \\rho \\;\\;\\ ; .$ } } \\end{array } \\right.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with this procedure , @xmath13 is only defined in @xmath116 , the upper right half of the kruskal domain ; it solves the dirac equation @xmath117 in the open set @xmath116 . if @xmath13 is to be a physically reasonable solution of the dirac equation , it must be possible to extend it to the entire region @xmath118 between the two hyperbolas .",
    "if this extended wave function was not zero in the region @xmath119 , our system would be connected to a white hole or to another universe ( through a worm hole ) , and the dirac particle would have a certain probability to be in these extensions of space - time . since we are only interested in black holes , this is not the situation we want to consider .",
    "therefore we demand that the extension of @xmath13 must vanish identically in the half plane @xmath119 .",
    "we conclude that in kruskal coordinates , we must analyze a solution @xmath13 of the dirac equation ( [ eq:30u ] ) of the form @xmath120 this wave function may be singular on the lines @xmath121 ; in this case , @xmath13 must solve the dirac equation in a generalized weak sense .    for the calculation of the weak derivatives of @xmath13 , we rewrite the wave function in the form @xmath122 where @xmath123 and @xmath124 are the components of @xmath13 outside resp .  inside the horizon (",
    "@xmath125 denotes the heaviside function @xmath126 for @xmath127 and @xmath128 otherwise ) .",
    "since @xmath13 satisfies the dirac equation in @xmath129 , we need only consider the singular contributions on the lines @xmath121 .",
    "a formal calculation gives @xmath130 if @xmath131 and @xmath132 were smooth up to the boundary of @xmath133 resp .",
    "@xmath134 , this equation would be well - defined in the distributional sense . in general",
    ", however , @xmath131 and @xmath132 might be singular in the limit @xmath135 . in order to treat this general case",
    ", we multiply ( [ eq : u1]),([eq : u2 ] ) with test functions @xmath136 which , as @xmath135 , decay so fast that the integral over the resulting expression is well - defined . since the matrices @xmath137 and @xmath138 are linearly independent , we get the two conditions @xmath139 in ( [ eq : u3 ] ) , we compensate the possible divergence of @xmath13 for @xmath140 by choosing @xmath141 in the region @xmath116 to be of the form @xmath142 ) is of the form @xmath143 , and the integral makes sense . since @xmath144 is arbitrary ,",
    "we conclude that the integrand on the line @xmath145 must vanish , which implies that @xmath146 in ( [ eq : u4 ] ) , we can proceed similarly ; namely , if @xmath13 is singular on the line @xmath147 , we compensate the divergence of the integrand in ( [ eq : u4 ] ) by choosing @xmath141 to have an appropriately fast decay near the line @xmath147 .",
    "one must keep in mind , however , that @xmath141 can not be chosen independently in @xmath133 and @xmath134 , because the smoothness of @xmath141 on the line @xmath147 may impose restrictions on @xmath141 .",
    "for example , if @xmath131 and @xmath132 have poles near @xmath147 , @xmath148 then we must choose @xmath141 in the form @xmath149 thus the asymptotic behavior of @xmath141 near @xmath147 in @xmath133 and @xmath134 must be the same . in the integral ( [ eq : u4 ] ) , this means that the leading order singularities of @xmath131 and @xmath132 may cancel each other for any choice of @xmath141 .",
    "therefore , the condition for the leading order singularity takes the form @xmath150 if the singularity of @xmath13 on the line @xmath147 is worse than polynomial or of different form , there may be no obstructions for the choice of @xmath141 in @xmath133 and @xmath134 . in this case , ( [ eq : u6 ] ) will still be a necessary condition . it will no longer be the strongest possible condition , but this is irrelevant for our purposes . for simplicity , we will use ( [ eq : u6 ] ) in the general case .",
    "next we evaluate the conditions ( [ eq : u5 ] ) and ( [ eq : u6 ] ) for our wave function @xmath151 in ( [ eq:18c ] ) . using ( [ eq:10 ] ) ,",
    "we have in @xmath116 @xmath152 the explicit formulas ( [ eq:11c ] ) and ( [ eq:11d ] ) enable us to write the time - exponential in terms of @xmath72 and @xmath73 as @xmath153 using the relation ( [ eq:11e ] ) between @xmath55 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 , the condition ( [ eq : u5 ] ) in polar coordinates takes the form @xmath154 similarly , condition ( [ eq : u6 ] ) can be written in polar coordinates as @xmath155 in order to simplify this formula , we consider the decomposition of @xmath13 in the form @xmath156 according to condition ( [ eq : mc1 ] ) , the first summand in the bracket in ( [ eq : u7 ] ) vanishes on the horizon @xmath157 .",
    "since the matrix @xmath42 is invertible , we conclude that @xmath13 and @xmath158 are of the same order on the horizon .",
    "thus we can take out the matrices @xmath159 in ( [ eq : u8 ] ) and finally obtain the equivalent condition @xmath160 as @xmath161 .",
    "the relations ( [ eq : mc1 ] ) and ( [ eq : mc2 ] ) are our _ matching conditions_.    we briefly explain what these matching conditions mean , without being mathematically precise .",
    "first of all , we point out that the matrix @xmath162 in the first matching condition ( [ eq : mc1 ] ) is not invertible .",
    "therefore , ( [ eq : mc1 ] ) does not imply that @xmath163 goes to zero in the limit @xmath161 ; in general , this limit need not even exist .",
    "although the matching conditions have a quite special form , they can be understood intuitively if one considers the dirac current in polar coordinates .",
    "we first look at the total normalization integral ( [ eq:2])+([eq:4 ] ) : @xmath164 the condition ( [ eq : mc1 ] ) ensures that the integral of the first summand is small near the horizon . using the matching condition ( [ eq : mc2 ] ) , one sees that the integrals in the second and last summands behave similarly near the horizon . because of the opposite sign of the second and third summands , this tends to make the normalization integral finite even if @xmath13 is singular on the horizon ( if the current had a pole , for example , one could define the normalization integral as a principal value ) .",
    "thus our matching conditions `` regularize '' the normalization integral across the horizon .",
    "it is also interesting to look at the current in radial direction .",
    "for this , we consider the normalization integral through the hypersurface @xmath67 , ( [ eq : h2 ] ) .",
    "for the outer normal @xmath30 , this gives inside the horizon @xmath165 for @xmath111 , on the other hand , we get the expression @xmath166 according to ( [ eq : mc1 ] ) , the first integral in ( [ eq:20b ] ) is small near the horizon @xmath157 . the matching condition ( [ eq : mc2 ] )",
    "gives that the second summand in ( [ eq:20b ] ) behaves similar to ( [ eq:20a ] ) near the horizon .",
    "thus our matching conditions tend to make the normalization integral through @xmath67 a continuous function in @xmath167 on the horizon @xmath168 . since the integrand of the normalization integral has the interpretation as the `` probability density '' or `` probability current",
    ", '' this means physically that a particle which disappears in the event horizon must reappear in the interior of the horizon .",
    "this is in accordance with our physical assumption that there are no other universes or white holes where the particle could disappear into or emerge from .",
    "we next study dirac particles in the external reissner - nordstrm background fields ( [ eq:30 ] ) , ( [ eq : cp ] ) . since the external fields are spherically symmetric and time - independent , we can separate out the angular and time dependence of the wave functions via spherical harmonics and plane waves , respectively .",
    "this is done in a manner similar to the central force problem in minkowski space ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "we start with a compilation of some formulas involving the angular momentum operator @xmath169 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "its square is @xmath170 with @xmath171 .",
    "the spherical harmonics @xmath172 , @xmath173 , @xmath174 are simultaneous eigenfunctions of @xmath175 and @xmath176 , namely @xmath177 they are orthonormal , @xmath178 and form a basis of @xmath179 .",
    "the operators @xmath180 serve as `` ladder operators '' , in the sense that @xmath181 in preparation for the four - component dirac spinors , we consider two - component pauli spinors .",
