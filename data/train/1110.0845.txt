    "ghost imaging is a transverse active - imaging technique that exploits the correlation between two light beams to image a target without spatially - resolving measurements of the light beam that has undergone target interaction .",
    "the two beams are the signal , which interacts with the target and then is measured by a single - pixel bucket detector , and the reference , which is directly measured by a high spatial - resolution detector . an intensity cross - correlation between the signal beam that encounters the target and",
    "the reference beam that impinges on the high spatial - resolution detector imparts target information  the ghost image  to the cross correlation between the photocurrents obtained from the two detectors , information that is unavailable from either photocurrent alone .",
    "most ghost - imaging experiments and related theory deal with the transmissive case , in which the bucket detector is placed behind the target , and we image the target s intensity - transmission profile . in the first ghost imaging experiment , the signal and reference beams were the quantum - mechanically entangled outputs from a spontaneous parametric downconverter ( spdc ) @xcite , which afforded them a phase - sensitive cross correlation stronger than permitted by classical physics @xcite .",
    "the system was run at low flux , in which the spdc s post - selected output state , within the photodetectors response time , could be taken to be a biphoton ; the ghost image was then formed by counting coincidences between the bucket and high spatial - resolution detections instead of a photocurrent cross correlation .",
    "subsequently , ghost imaging was done with a high - flux pseudothermal source , i.e. , a classical - state source realized by sending a laser beam through a rotating ground - glass diffuser and a 50 - 50 beam splitter to create identical , spatially - incoherent signal and reference beams with a phase - insensitive cross correlation .",
    "the ghost image was then obtained by continuous - time cross correlation of the bucket and high spatial - resolution photocurrents @xcite .",
    "later , the theories of spdc and pseudothermal ghost imaging were united in a gaussian - state treatment that showed , in both cases , that ghost - image formation by photocurrent correlation arises from classical coherence propagation , but the nonclassical spdc source offers much higher image contrast and a modest spatial - resolution advantage in near - field operation @xcite .",
    "recently , a computational ghost - imaging method was introduced , in which the need for a reference beam is removed @xcite .",
    "conventional ghost imaging relies on the intensity cross - correlation between the signal beam on the target and the reference beam on the high spatial - resolution detector . in spdc and pseudothermal ghost imaging ,",
    "these beam patterns are random .",
    "if , however , a spatial light modulator is used to impart a sequence of known spatial patterns to a laser beam prior to propagation to the target , then diffraction theory can be used to calculate noiseless versions of the associated reference - beam intensity patterns .",
    "these computed reference - beam results can be employed , for cross - correlation ghost - image formation , as if they came from photodetection of a physical reference beam .",
    "more importantly , computational ghost imaging opens the door for more advanced computational image reconstruction techniques , notably compressive sensing @xcite .",
    "all of the preceding discussion has been framed for ghost imaging of transmissive targets .",
    "recent experiments have shown the feasibility of an alternate ghost - imaging configuration , in which the bucket detector views the target in reflection , rather than in transmission @xcite . in this reflective setup , the source and detector can , in principle , be moved arbitrarily far away from the target , suggesting that ghost imaging could be a viable remote - sensing technique .",

    ", there has been theoretical study of the impact of turbulence on ghost imaging in transmission @xcite , but there has only been an initial turbulence - free theory development for ghost imaging in reflection @xcite , and that work was limited to pseudothermal sources .    in this paper we will extend the analysis from @xcite to include spdc ghost imaging in reflection and , for both spdc and pseudothermal operation , the presence of atmospheric turbulence in the propagation paths .",

    "each of these noise terms has an important physical interpretation , as we explain below .",
    "the first noise term , @xmath165 , captures the fluctuations associated with decorrelation of transverse locations in the image arising from the source s time evolution .",

    "the @xmath171 term is due to the optical - path interactions that degrade the measurement , i.e. , the turbulent atmosphere , and the scattering off the rough target .",
    "the noise contribution from target scattering can be mitigated by aperture averaging , which , as noted above , is quantified by @xmath155 .",
    "the effect of the turbulence is somewhat more complicated , as it contributes a scaling factor @xmath172 to all field - variation terms on path @xmath173 .",
    "in addition , the logamplitude fluctuations also cause a deviation that results in the squared - mean term in the denominator of eq .",
    "no longer being canceled .",
    "these effects are particularly devastating because @xmath171 is the only noise term whose strength is independent of the detector integration time .",
    "this is because we have assumed time - independent target behavior and @xmath33 less than the @xmath34ms turbulence coherence time .",
    "consequently , regardless of the source brightness and integration time , @xmath171 sets an ultimate upper limit on the snr .",
    "the noise term @xmath174 results from the statistics of photodetection at both the reference and bucket detectors , and as such is inversely proportional to the photon fluxes impinging on their active regions .",
    "thus , @xmath174 is inversely proportional to the size of each pixel , @xmath72 , and the solid - angle subtense factor @xmath107 .",
    "detection noise is mitigated by temporal averaging , but exacerbated by having a fast detector , so the pseudothermal @xmath174 is scaled by @xmath175 , while for the spdc imager it is scaled only by @xmath168 . the spdc case is also scaled by by @xmath176 , a result of that source s stronger - than classical correlation .    the @xmath177 term contains noise contributed by mixing between source plus path noise on the reference arm with detection noise on the signal arm , and vice versa . for both imagers",
    "this term has a temporal scaling of @xmath168 , and for the spdc imager the quantum correlation imparts an additional factor of @xmath178 .    to get a better understanding of the snr behavior for pseudothermal and spdc ghost imagers , we will consider three limiting cases .",
    "the first is the long integration - time limit in which @xmath171 dominates the noise denominators for both the pseudothermal and spdc ghost imagers , leading to the _",

    "then , in the high - brightness ( @xmath180 ) case , for which detection noise can be neglected , performance is dominated by source fluctuations , @xmath165 , yielding @xmath181 for pseudothermal ( @xmath18 ) and spdc ( @xmath20 ) imagers , respectively . with all parameters other than source coherence - time being equal",
    ", the spdc high - brightness snr exceeds that of the pseudothermal source by a factor @xmath167 , where @xmath16 is the pseudothermal source s coherence time .",
    "this is because the much faster fluctuations in the spdc output fields lead to faster decorrelation , and hence higher snr .",
    "that said , however , the reader is reminded that cw spdc operation is ordinarily in the low - brightness regime , hence we turn our attention now to that special case .    in the low - brightness , @xmath182 , regime , snr behavior",
    "is dominated by the beat between the detection noises , @xmath174 .",
    "here we find that @xmath183 for the pseudothermal and spdc cases .",
    "the spdc snr is linear in source brightness , whereas the pseudothermal snr is quadratic in that parameter .",
    "this behavior is to be expected , because the spdc low - brightness output approaches the biphoton state , which is known to have lower detection noise than classical - state light .",
    "furthermore , @xmath16 for the pseudothermal source will greatly exceed @xmath16 for the spdc , and , as noted in the preceding paragraph , @xmath167 holds for the pseudothermal source .",
    "it follows that the low - brightness spdc snr is much higher than that of the pseudothermal imager .",
    "the reader is cautioned to remember , however , that pseudothermal ghost imaging is typically performed in the high - brightness regime .",
    "it is also instructive to compare our snr results  which apply to reflective ghost imaging through atmospheric turbulence  to the transmissive ghost imaging , no - turbulence results from @xcite .",
    "the principal differences between the snr behaviors in these two cases is as follows .",
    "our snr expressions have the average intensity reflection coefficient @xmath184 appearing in lieu of the magnitude - squared of the field reflection coefficient @xmath185 that is seen in the transmissive case . moreover , the transmissive - case snr from @xcite has neither target - induced speckle nor turbulence contributions , so it has neither @xmath171 term nor any turbulence - induced noise - magnification factors .",
    "the reflective case s @xmath165 term has a factor of @xmath186 and its @xmath177 term has a factor of @xmath187 , but both @xmath188 contributions are absent from the transmissive case .",
    "these additional reflective - case contributions are direct results of the rough - surface scattering . in both transmissive and reflective operation",
    "there is averaging of the source randomness at the target , but in the reflective case the fields scatter incoherently off the target , and their fourier components are averaged at the bucket detector .",
    "this second averaging depends on the ratio of the source size to the bucket size , i.e. , @xmath189 .",
    "as @xmath189 increases , the bucket detector captures more light , this term becomes less significant , and we approach the transmissive behavior for these terms . finally , the reflective - snr terms associated with the bucket detector measurement in @xmath174 and @xmath177 are scaled by @xmath190 , relative to the corresponding terms in the transmissive case .",
    "this scale factor is the inverse of the solid angle subtended at the target by the bucket detector .",
    "its presence in the reflective case is a consequence of the quasi - lambertian scattering from the rough surface    it follows from the snr differences highlighted above that the low - brightness snr asymptotes for transmissive and reflective operation only differ by the latter s including the solid - angle subtense factor @xmath107 .",
    "their high - brightness snr asymptotes are also similar , with the only difference being the reflective case s factor of @xmath186 .",
    "the most profound difference , however , is due to the @xmath171 term that is only present for reflective operation .",
    "this term implies that the snr of reflective ghost imaging has a maximum value , snr@xmath191 , whereas no such saturation occurs in transmissive ghost imaging , i.e. , its snr can grow without bound as @xmath192 increases .",
    "furthermore , in reflective imaging , this limiting effect can be quite severe : even with no turbulence , for @xmath193 we find @xmath194 , and for @xmath195 we have @xmath196 .",
    "so , for realistic standoff sensing , the snr will be limited to single - digit values if no further measures are taken to suppress the fluctuations arising from target - induced speckle and atmospheric turbulence .",
    "we have developed the performance of reflective ghost imaging from classical and nonclassical sources in a quantum gaussian - state framework .",
    "next we consider a computational ghost imager , a variant of the pseudothermal case in which the `` chaotic '' signal field is created by deterministically modulating the wavefront of a laser with a spatial light modulator ( slm ) , and no reference - arm light beam is required . instead ,",
    "knowledge of the slm phase pattern is used to calculate the signal - beam intensity at the target for use in lieu of a reference - beam measurement @xcite .",
    "if an independent pseudorandom phase process is applied to each slm pixel , then far - field propagation can be argued to yield gaussian field statistics per the central limit theorem .",
    "thus it is appropriate for us to model the computational ghost imager s far - field statistics with a gaussian - schell model , taking the source s coherence length to be approximately the width of an slm pixel , and source s intensity diameter to be the diameter of the slm .",
    "the laser that illuminates the slm will be taken to emit coherent - state light , hence the slm s output beam is in classical state and semiclassical theory will give quantitatively identical results for its far - field photodetection statistics as the full quantum treatment @xcite . also , because the reference field at the target is computed , rather than measured , it is most naturally modeled as a complex - valued gaussian random process . consequently , and without loss of generality , we choose to use semiclassical theory for our analysis of computational ghost imaging because it lets us deal with only classical random processes , rather than a combination of quantum field operators and classical random processes .",
    "we thus use @xmath197 to represent the complex envelope of the target - plane signal field , and @xmath198 to represent the computed complex - envelope of the field that would have been present on the ccd camera .",
    "these two complex - valued , zero - mean , gaussian random processes are completely characterized by their nonzero autocorrelation and cross - correlation functions , which we take to be as given in eqs .",
    " for their field - operator pseudothermal counterparts .",
    "that these correlation functions are consistent with classical random - process theory follows from the pseudothermal source s producing classical - state light .",
    "the principal distinction between computational and pseudothermal ghost imaging  which is also its main advantage  is that there is neither detection noise nor turbulence on its computed reference - arm intensity , which is found via @xmath199 with @xmath200 .",

    "to do so we introduce the dimensionless quantity @xmath218 , which is the photon flux per source spatial mode and detector temporal mode . because all three systems are taken to have detectors with identical characteristics , identical values for @xmath219 will yield identical photon fluxes .",

    "we have derived the key performance characteristics of reflective ghost imaging in the context of realistic standoff sensing applications .",
    "this was done within a gaussian - state framework that allowed for analysis of classical pseudothermal sources and the nonclassical output of an spdc .",
    "our results for the spatial resolution , image contrast , and snr were analogous to those calculated for transmissive ghost imaging in the absence of turbulence @xcite , with a few significant differences that result from the roughness of the target surface , turbulence on the optical paths , and the standoff nature of the measurement",
    ". first we shall discuss the impact of rough - surface scattering in the absence of turbulence , then we shall discuss the additional effects incurred when turbulence is present .",
    "rough - surfaced targets scatter their impinging illumination in a random manner , casting random speckle patterns in their far fields that , on average , correspond to a quasi - lambertian distribution .",
    "consequently , the ghost - imager s bucket detector will , on average , collect only a fraction , @xmath107 , of the target - scattered light .",
    "this angular subtense factor  which is absent in transmissive ghost imaging  appears in the average photocurrent cross - correlation functions in eqs .   and , and the noise terms associated with the bucket detector , i.e. , @xmath174 and @xmath177 .",
    "the surface roughness has another major effect on the snr : its time - independent speckle pattern implies the existence of a finite saturation - snr value in the limit of long integration time .",
    "the target - speckle contribution that leads to a saturation snr appears in @xmath171 , and is a function of @xmath189 , the ratio of the source size to the bucket detector size .",
    "here we may incur a trade - off between spatial resolution and snr . specifically , by enlarging the bucket detector we can increase the averaging of the target speckle , and thus the saturation snr , without affecting the imager s spatial resolution .",
    "ultimately , however , there will be a practical limit beyond which the receiving aperture size can no longer be increased .",
    "beyond that point @xmath189 , and thus the saturation snr , can only be increased by decreasing the source size @xmath13 . however , as seen in eq .",
    ", spatial resolution is inversely proportional to @xmath13 , so increasing the saturation snr in this manner will degrade spatial resolution .",
    "the effects of turbulence on the image contrast and spatial resolution of reflective ghost imaging are similar those previously found for transmissive ghost imaging @xcite . in particular :",
    "turbulence does not change the image contrast ; turbulence in the target - to - bucket path has no effect on spatial resolution ; and turbulence on the signal and reference paths degrades spatial resolution in the same manner , i.e. , degradation occurs when they become smaller than the source size . in both spdc and pseudothermal ghost",
    "imaging it is therefore advantageous to propagate the reference field through a controlled ( turbulence - free ) environment .",
    "turbulence also degrades ghost - image snr in two ways : first , its logamplitude fluctuations magnify several existing noise terms ; and second , these fluctuations also contribute to the time - independent noise term @xmath171 , decreasing the saturation snr from its speckle - only value .    in computational ghost imaging , the reference field",
    "is computed , removing the turbulence on that path , and thus improving both the spatial resolution and the snr .",
    "the computational case also has significantly reduced noise for low - brightness illumination , as there is no longer detection noise on the reference arm , making its low - brightness snr behavior superior to that of both pseudothermal and spdc ghost imaging . more generally , figs .",
    "[ fig : snr_l ] and [ fig : snr_h ] show that the computational ghost imager has a higher snr than the pseudothermal system in both low - brightness and high - brightness operation , and than the spdc system in its low - brightness ( biphoton ) regime .",
    "however , in high - brightness operation , the spdc ghost imager s significantly shorter coherence time enables it to reach its saturation snr much quicker than either the computational or the pseudothermal ghost imagers .",
    "although a cw spdc will not be able to reach that high - brightness regime , pulsed systems are capable of doing so @xcite .    insofar as standoff sensing is concerned , the essential conclusion to be drawn from the preceding summary of our work is simple : the computational approach is the ghost - imaging configuration that shows the most promise for this application .",
    "it has the best spatial resolution , the highest saturation - snr , and general snr performance second only to high - brightness spdc operation .",
    "in addition , the computational approach obviates the need for a physical reference path , which makes it naturally amenable to obtaining 3d ghost images .",
    "in particular , pseudothermal and spdc ghost imaging require that reference - arm measurements be made on an intensity pattern corresponding to the one that is projected onto the target .",
    "as shown theoretically in @xcite and experimentally in @xcite , computational ghost imaging allows reference intensity patterns to be computed at a variety of target ranges so that ghost images can be formed for these target ranges from the same bucket - detector data .",
