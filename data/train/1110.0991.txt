    "multiple - quantum ( mq ) coherences in a system of dipolar coupled spins can be detected by mq nmr methods  @xcite . in the simplest cases ( one - dimensional spin chains and rings , a system of spin - carrying atoms ( molecules ) in nanopores ) ,",
    "analytical and numerical methods were developed  @xcite in order to calculate the intensities of mq nmr coherences . usually spin - lattice relaxation is not taken into account at investigations of mq nmr dynamics because the characteristic times of spin - lattice relaxation are longer than the characteristic time of mq nmr dynamics  @xcite . at the same time , mq nmr methods have been also used to measure decoherence for highly correlated spin states  @xcite and to study the scaling of the decoherence rate with the number of correlated spins  @xcite .",
    "mq nmr investigations showed both experimentally  @xcite and with computer simulations for a system of equivalent spins  @xcite that the relaxation time decreases with the increase in the mq coherence order and in the number of spins .",
    "it was also shown  @xcite that mq nmr allows us to find a relationship between the intensity of the mq coherence of the second order and a measure of the quantum entanglement which is the main resource of quantum computers  @xcite .",
    "however , that relationship was found without taking into account effects of spin - lattice relaxation  @xcite .",

    "we develop a phenomenological theory of spin - lattice relaxation for a system consisting of two dipolar coupled spins in the mq nmr experiment at low temperatures .",
    "we calculate the intensities of mq coherences of the zeroth and plus / minus second orders and discuss the effect of spin - lattice relaxation on mq nmr dynamics .",
    "we show that the developed approach is also applicable for linear spin chains when the approximation of nearest neighbor interactions is used .",
    "we discuss a connection of quantum entanglement with the intensity of mq nmr coherence of the second order at different spin - lattice relaxation times .",
    "we consider a system consisting of two dipolar coupled spins ( @xmath0 ) in the conditions of the mq nmr experiment  @xcite .",

    "such equation can be solved with the linearization of the right hand side after it is expressed as an expansion in powers of @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the equilibrium density matrix in the rrf .",
