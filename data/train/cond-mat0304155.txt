    "the problem of superconductivity in the presence of spin splitting is currently heavily investigated .",
    "in fact , this question was already addressed experimentally and theoretically a while ago for the simplest case of a very thin superconducting film in a parallel magnetic field . for such geometry the quasiparticle energy states in a superconductor",
    "are splitted due to the interaction of the field with spin magnetic moments of the quasiparticles , while the orbital effects are negligible .",
    "this splitting has been earlier demonstrated by extensive studies of tunnel junctions formed by thin superconducting films ( see , e.g. , [ 1 - 3 ] and references therein ) .",
    "a more sophisticated case is the proximity effected hybrid systems consisting of a superconductor ( s ) and a ferromagnet ( f ) . in a ferromagnet ,",
    "the difference in the energy between spin - up and spin - down bands is an internal property , and that is the physical reason why a singlet cooper pair , injected from a superconductor into a ferromagnet , acquires a finite momentum .",
    "the resulting proximity induced superconducting state of the f layer is qualitatively different from the zero - momentum state : it is spatially inhomogeneous and the order parameter contains nodes where the phase changes by @xmath1 ( see recent review [ 4 ] and references therein ) . particularly , transport properties of the s / f structures have turned out to be quite unusual .",
    "experiments that have been performed on sfs weak links [ 5 - 7 ] and sifs  tunnel junctions [ 8 ]  directly prove the so - called @xmath1-phase superconductivity .",
    "planar tunneling spectroscopy also reveals a @xmath1-phase shift in the order parameter , when superconducting correlations coexist with the ferromagnetic order [ 9 ] .",
    "an inverse phenomenon , the modification of the bcs density of states in mesoscopic s layer under the influence of a ferromagnet is observed in tunnel spectroscopy experiment [ 10 ] as well . for s / f - i - f / s tunnel structures with very thin f layers ,",
    "it was also predicted [ 11,12 ] that one can , if there is a parallel orientation of the f layers magnetization , turn the junction into the @xmath1-phase state with the critical current inversion , or , if there is an antiparallel orientation of the f layers internal fields , save the 0-phase junction state but enhance the tunnel current .",
    "experimentally , however , the enhancement of the dc josephson current has not been detected until now .",
    "one of the main problems here is the requirement to fix one layer magnetization of the sample , while preserving a possibility to reorient the magnetization of another layer by a weak magnetic field .    in this report",
    "we draw attention to another experimental set - up where , as we show below , there is the critical current enhancement , as well as other new effects of the superconductivity in the presence of spin splitting , while the experimental set - up admits of simple variations of an applied field direction .",
    "namely , we consider the dc josephson effect for tunnel structure where there is spin splitting for two reasons - due to an external magnetic field and due to an internal exchange field of the f layer .",
    "the ground state and critical current dependence on the applied field is analyzed for a system of proximity coupled bulk superconductor with thin ferromagnetic and thin normal nonmagnetic metals separated by an insulating barrier ( s / f - i - n / s tunnel junction ) .",
    "based on a microscopic theory of the superconducting proximity effect for s / f and s / n bilayers we demonstrate that the s / f - i - n / s contact with strong enough magnetism of the f layer is in a ground state with @xmath2 superconducting phase difference on the electrodes . in such a contact low external magnetic field reverses the critical current sign ( the @xmath1-state of the junction ) if the fields ( external and internal ) have parallel orientation . for the antiparallel fields alignment the critical current behavior is much more complicated : a monotonic increase of the external field causes an enhancement of the critical current , which is then changed by a reverse of current sign .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we outline the model of the junction . in sec .",
    "iii the outcomes of the theory of proximity coupled s / f and s / n bilayers have been generalized to include external magnetic field effects .",
    "the main results of the paper are presented in sec.iv . in sec .",
    "v we evaluate the approximations that have been made in the theory and briefly discuss a possible realization of the s / f - i - n / s systems to explore the predicted effects .",
    "the system we are interested in is the s / f - i - n / s tunnel structure in a parallel magnetic field shown in fig.1 .",
    "we assume that the first ( left ) electrode of the junction is formed by a proximity coupled s / f bilayer while the second ( right ) is formed by a proximity coupled s / n bilayer .",
    "the transparency of the insulating layer is small enough to neglect the effect of a tunnel current on the superconducting state of the electrodes . the s / f and s",
    "/ n interfaces may have arbitrary finite transparency , but it is large compared to the transparency of the junction barrier .",
    "the f layer will be treated as a single domain ferromagnet .",
    "we also expect the f layer magnetization to be aligned parallel to the interface , so that it does not create a spontaneous magnetic flux penetrating into the s layer . the general relation between  the curie temperature of the f metal and the superconducting transition temperature of the s metal is considered .",
    "transverse dimensions of the junction are supposed to be much less then the josephson penetration depth , so that ( a ) all quantities depend only on a single coordinate @xmath3 normal to the interface surface of the materials , and ( b ) a flux quantum can not be trapped by the junction .",
    "we assume that the applied field penetrates and mostly concentrates into the  weak ",
    "f - i - n part of the junction .",
    "we will also neglect the effect of the magnetic field on electron orbits as compared with the effect of the field on electron spins .",
    "this assumption is well satisfied for films thinner than their superconducting coherence lengths @xmath4 . here",
    "@xmath5  is the thickness of the f and n layers , respectively ; @xmath6 and @xmath7 are superconducting coherence lengths for f and n metals ; @xmath8is a diffusion coefficient in the f , n metal ; @xmath9 is the exchange energy . for films of such thicknesses",
    "one can also be sure that there is a fairly uniform penetration of a parallel field .",
    "( the evaluation of these approximations will be made below , in sec .",
    "we consider the ",
    "limit for all metals , i. e. , we assume that @xmath10  and @xmath11 , and that the condition @xmath12  is fulfilled [ 13 ] , where @xmath13 is the electron mean free path for the s , f , and n layers , respectively ; @xmath14 is the superconducting coherence length in the s metal ; and @xmath15 is the momentum relaxation time .",
    "( we have taken the system of units with @xmath16 ) .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case when the spin - orbit scattering is absent and spin  up  and spin  down  electron subbands do not mix with each other . in equations below , we will use the effective coherence length @xmath17 for the f layer , thus providing the regular crossover to both limits @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( see refs .",
    "14 , 15 for details ) ; the relation on film thickness is read as @xmath20 or @xmath21 , depending on the relation between @xmath22 and @xmath9 .",
    "as a first step , we should generalize results of the theory for a proximity coupled s / f ( s / n ) bilayer of a massive , @xmath23 , superconductor and a thin ferromagnetic ( nonmagnetic ) metal taking into account the influence of the applied magnetic field @xmath24 . the most direct way to do",
    "it is to use the results for a s / f proximity coupled bilayer ( refs .",
    "[ 12,14,15 ] ) .",
    "as is well known , the properties of  dirty  metals can be described by the usadel equations [ 16 ] . following [ 17 ] , we introduce the modified usadel functions @xmath25 , used to take into account the normalized confinement on the normal @xmath26 and anomalous @xmath27 green s functions . due to small thickness of the normal ( magnetic and nonmagnetic ) metal , the proximity effect problem can be reduced to a boundary problem for the s layer and a relation for determining modified usadel function @xmath25  of a nonsuperconducting layer ( see refs . [ 14,15,17,18 ] for details ) .",
    "the boundary conditions at the sf ( sn ) interface are modelled by two parameters : @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the @xmath28 plays the role of an effective pairbreaking parameter near the sf ( sn ) interface and its value is mainly determined by electron densities of s and f ( n ) metals .",
    "a large value of @xmath28 corresponds to high density of quasiparticles in the f ( n ) metal compared to that in the s near the sf ( sn ) boundary . in this case",
    "the diffusion of quasiparticles into the superconductor leads to a strong suppression of the order parameter in the s region .",
    "the scale at which superconductivity reaches the bulk value is @xmath14 from the sf ( sn ) interface . in the opposite case , @xmath30 , the influence of the f ( n ) layer on the superconductivity of the s metal is weak , and even vanishes if @xmath31 . the parameter @xmath32",
    "@xmath33 @xmath34 , where  @xmath34 is the sf ( sn ) boundary resistance , describes the electrical quality of the sf ( sn ) interface .",

    "the case @xmath36 corresponds to low transparency of the sf ( sn ) barrier .",
    "there is also one more parameter , @xmath9 , that is the value of the exchange spin splitting in the f layer . in the general case ,",
    "the problem needs self - consistent numerical calculations of the usadel equations .",
    "however , at some simplifying assumptions , the model admits of analytic solutions that hold all new physics we are interested in .    for f ( n ) films thinner than their superconducting coherence lengths , @xmath37 , the critical current of the s / f - i - n / s tunnel contact can be represented through the s layer green s functions ( see eq .",

    "an extension to different sn and sf boundary parameters is straightforward , and will be made towards the end of the sec .",

( 4 ) we obtain in the limit of large field values : @xmath85 i. e. , a crossover of the s / f - i - n / s junction from the 0-phase state to the @xmath86-phase state takes place .",
    "the most interesting results have been obtained for the geometry with the opposite field orientation : @xmath51 .",
    "simple substitution into eq .",
    "( 4 ) gives for @xmath87 that @xmath88 , while if @xmath89 we directly obtain that @xmath90 @xmath91 .",
    "comparing , we also find that @xmath92 and @xmath93 . as it follows from eq .",
    "( 4 ) , for large enough values of the external field , the critical current again inverses its sign and the crossover of the s / f - i - n / s junction from the 0-phase state to the @xmath1-phase state takes place .",
    "however , while increasing the field in the interval @xmath94 , a nonmonotonic current versus field dependence is observed .",
    "the main features of this dependence are shown on fig .",
    "2 , where the josephson current amplitude of the s / f - i - n / s junction versus the applied magnetic field is given for the case of a strong proximity effect , @xmath95 and @xmath96 , and different exchange field intensity . ( here and below , dashed curves are used for the results of the numerical calculations for the parallel fields orientation and full curves are used for the results in the opposite geometry )",
    ". it can be seen , that the dc current greatly depends on relative orientation of the fields .    to reveal the underlying physics behind the critical current behavior on field ,",
    "let us consider a ground state and a phase shift across the contact at zero external field . as follows from eq .",
    "( 2 ) , the modified usadel function @xmath97 can be written in the form ( the case @xmath98 ) @xmath99 taking into account that the typical value @xmath100 @xmath101 , one can see that in the limit @xmath102 the unified correlation function of the s / f bilayer acquires an additional @xmath2 phase shift in comparison with the similar function for the s / n bilayer .",
    "when the external field is applied , @xmath103 and @xmath38 , @xmath104 , we may evaluate the critical current as @xmath105 @xmath106\\}}{\\omega ^{2}(\\omega ^{2}+h^{2})^{1/2}}\\ ] ] i.e. , for @xmath107  ,  the value of the supercurrent may be low enough - the exchange field blocks a contact .",
    "so , the s / f - i - n / s contact with strong enough magnetism of the f layer can have a ground state with the superconducting phase difference on the electrodes about @xmath0 .",
    "note , that this mechanism of the @xmath0 junction  realization should not be confused with the @xmath0-phase state induced by current fluctuations in the junction plane , the situation that has been treated earlier in ref .",
    "[ 19 ] for sfs structures with a thick f layer .",
    "we postpone a more detailed description of the @xmath0 state of s / f - i - f / s and s / f - i - n / s hybrid  systems to a forthcoming publication [ 20 ] , but here discuss the effects of the external magnetic field .",
    "as one can see from expression ( 5 ) , if the contact is in magnetic field , the additional phase shift of the  usadel function @xmath56 has been induced .",
    "depending on the relative orientation , the applied field can prompt the total phase shift across the contact to a @xmath1-state of the junction or to a @xmath108-phase state .",
    "for the latter case one can expect an essential enhancement of the critical current amplitude .",
    "such type of behavior we can see on figs . 2 - 7 .",
    "as seen on fig .",
    "2 , a low external magnetic field reverses the critical current sign if the fields ( external and internal ) have parallel orientation . for antiparallel fields alignment the critical current behavior is much more complicated .",
    "in some interval of the applied field the enhancement of the dc josephson current takes place in comparison with the case of @xmath82 , while the 0-phase state of the junction is held . by increasing the magnetic field",
    "one can turn the current though a few extremum and then adopt the junction to the @xmath1-phase state superconductivity with the opposite current direction .",
    "the results above are obtained for the case of a vanishing interface resistance , @xmath69 .",
    "after simple but cumbersome algebra , one can also obtain expressions for @xmath38 , and @xmath109 .",
    "we will not extract here the formulae but illustrate our calculations on fig .",

    "3 .      using the expression ( 1 ) , after simple transformations one can obtain for the dc josephson current in the case of vanishing interface resistance , @xmath96 , and a weak proximity effect , @xmath30 : @xmath111 @xmath112\\omega ^{-2}\\}^{-1/2}\\text { \\ , } \\ ] ] where @xmath113  . in proceeding these relations , we have taken into account that @xmath114 is small , @xmath115 .",

    "if @xmath117 , one can also obtain that @xmath118 the dependence of the josephson current amplitude of s / f - i - n / s junction on the applied magnetic field for a weak proximity effect , @xmath119 , and different exchange field values of the f layer is shown on fig .",
    "4 . as in the case of strong proximity effect ,",
    "the current greatly depends on the relative orientation of the fields . for parallel geometry , a ground state with a phase shift across the contact about @xmath0",
    "is found at low field , while with the field increasing the ground state is changed to the @xmath1 phase superconductivity .",
    "for the antiparallel orientation the current behavior is essentially nonmonotonic and the increasing of the field turns the current through a few extrema until the junction crossovers into the @xmath86-phase state with opposite current direction . shown on fig .",
    "5 . are representative dc current dependences versus the applied magnetic field for the junction with @xmath119 , @xmath120 , and different interface transparency .",
    "as is expected , the critical current amplitude decreases with increasing the interface resistance .    as one can see on figs . 2 - 5",
    ", for antiparallel geometry the @xmath1 phase superconductivity takes place when the external field value is about the internal one , @xmath121 .",
    "this result , far from being surprising , is related to the quasiparticle spin splitting in the effective magnetic fields in bilayers .",
    "namely , the s / f - i - n / s structure in antiparallel magnetic field @xmath122 has the same spin splitting as  s / n - i - f / s one in zero magnetic field . in other words , for @xmath123  we should have the critical current versus field dependence as those we have for @xmath50 .",
    "that is what we see on figs . 2 - 5 .",
    "to illustrate the main features of  the josephson effect for the s / f - i - n / s tunnel structure caused by an applied magnetic field , we took , for simplicity , the same interface parameters for both sf and sn interfaces .",
    "as the nonsuperconducting metals , - ferromagnetic and nonmagnetic ones , - should be different , this approximation may be unrealizable experimentally .",
    "a further step consists in extending the theory to a real system , where the boundary conditions for s / f and s / n bilayers can be different .",
    "generalization of the results to sf and sn interfaces with different transmission probabilities for quasiparticles is obvious .",
    "we present the results for two main cases : ( a ) the structure with a strong proximity effect for the sn boundary and a weak proximity effect for the sf boundary , and vice versa : ( b ) a strong proximity effect for the sf boundary and a weak proximity effect for the sn boundary .",

    "we have analyzed  a superconducting tunnel structure where there is spin splitting for two reasons : spin splitting caused by an external magnetic field and by an internal exchange field .",
    "the advantage of such structure is the possibility to get a convenient governing and adjustable parameter - an external magnetic field .",
    "we demonstrate that in the contacts under consideration the critical current can reverse its sign ( the @xmath1-state of the junction ) for the parallel field orientation . for the antiparallel field alignment",
    "the critical current behavior is much more complicated : for @xmath147 a monotonic increase of the  external field causes an enhancement of the critical current ; further field s increase @xmath148  , reverses the current direction .",
    "we reveal the physics behind such critical current  versus external field behavior .",
    "namely , we show that in the case of a strong enough magnetism of the f layer a superconducting phase difference on the junction electrodes is about @xmath0 .",

    ", these results provide new effects of the superconductivity in the presence of a spin splitting in hybrid superconductor - ferromagnet - normal metal structures and may lead to further understanding of the proximity effects in ferromagnetic materials .",
    "the feature important for practical applications is that the superconducting properties of s / f - i - n / s junctions can be simply varied by changing the external magnetic field direction .",
    "some simplifying assumptions have been made , such as the model admitted of analytical solutions .",
    "we consider the dirty limit .",
    "however , when the thickness of the f and n layers is much less then its coherence length , @xmath37 , the results are , in most cases , applicable for clean f and n metals , too . indeed ,",
    "if scattering centers are on average separated by a distance smaller than the coherence length , then the dirty limit may be applied .",
    "the physical presence of interfaces with atomic roughness ensures that there are such scattering processes for very thin layers .",
    "let us estimate the orbital effects .",
    "the magnetic field h induces screening currents and leads to some suppression of the condensate function . for ferromagnetic and nonmagnetic layers in the dirty limit the depairing rate due to the meissner current",
    "is determined by the energy @xmath149 , where @xmath150 is the condensate momentum ( here @xmath151 is the magnitude of the vector potential into the f ( n ) layer and @xmath152 is the flux quantum ) .",
    "so , the orbital effects can be neglected if @xmath153 where @xmath154 @xmath155 is the upper critical field of f ( n ) layer .",
    "we see , that the nanoscale nonsuperconducting layers thickness , @xmath4 , ensures that there is a fairly uniform penetration of an applied field and that orbital depairing effects are minimized . however , for nanoscale hybrid structures a strong electric field arising near metal - metal boundaries may be a source of spin - flip processes [ 21 ] . decreasing the average ( ferro)magnetic field experienced by the cooper pair , the spin - flip scattering is much more destructive than the orbital effect [ 22,23 ] .",
    "it was also assumed that the applied field is concentrated into the ",
    "f - i - n part of the junction . in a real situation",
    ", an external magnetic field can partly penetrate into the s layers and cause some suppression of the order parameter @xmath43 .",
    "this issue was already addressed a while ago and well understood ( see , e.g. , de gennes [ 24 ] , chap.vii ) . while , in the general case , it is necessary to take into account self - consistently corrections to the pair potential of the s layer , this fact , however , does not qualitatively influence the results of the paper , if the magnetic flux that penetrates into the contact is much less that a flux quantum .",

    "several recent works ( see , e. g. , [ 5 - 7,25 ] ) have found that dilute ferromagnetic @xmath156 alloys ( with x 0.6 ) are most adopted as materials for the f layers , since their weak ferromagnetism is less devastating to superconductivity .",
    "magnetic hysteresis measurements show for @xmath157 films with x @xmath158 0.4@xmath1590.5 the coercive field of 100 oe ( see , e.g. , [ 25 ] and references therein ) .",
    "one can also pin the magnetization of the @xmath160 layer by adjacent @xmath161 layer via exchange bias , and in such a way enlarge the interval of an applied magnetic field , where the magnetization remains fixed . on the other hand , various niobium oxides , one of them nbo , possess the properties of a normal nonmagnetic metal .",
    "such an n layer is usually formed during the fabrication process ( see , e. g. , [ 26 ] and references therein ) .",
    "so , conventional , e. g. , magnetron sputtering technique can be used to grow the tunnel superconductor - ferromagnet - insulator - nonmagnetic metal - superconductor structures .",

    "<S> the dc josephson current behavior is essentially nonmonotonic : by increasing an external magnetic field the current passes though a maximum , while the 0-phase state is held , and then the junction gets into the @xmath1-phase state with an opposite current direction . we demonstrate that the hybrid s / f - i - n / s metal structures possess new effects of the superconductivity in the presence of spin splitting , while an experimental set - up seems to be feasible and it may lead to further understanding of superconducting proximity effects in ferromagnetic materials .    </S>",
