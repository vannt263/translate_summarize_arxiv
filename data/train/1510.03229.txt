    "recent years have witnessed great experimental progress in the study and control of individual quantum systems @xcite .",
    "a common feature of many experiments is the use of quantum state tomography ( qst ) methods as a key tool for validating the results @xcite .",
    "the aim of qst is to statistically reconstruct an unknown state from the outcomes of repeated measurements performed on identical copies of the state . among the proposed estimation methods we mention , e.g. variations of maximum likelihood @xcite , linear inversion @xcite , bayesian inference @xcite , estimation with incomplete measurements @xcite , and continuous variables tomography @xcite .",
    "however , for composite systems such as trapped ions , full state tomography becomes challenging due to the exponential increase in dimension @xcite .",
    "therefore , there has been a significant interest in developing tomography methods that are efficient for certain _ lower dimensional families of physically relevant states_. for instance , the estimation of low rank states has been considered in the context of compressed sensing ( cs ) @xcite , model selection @xcite , and spectral thresholding @xcite .",
    "the estimation of the permutationally invariant part of the density matrix as an approximation to the true state is also relevant in certain physical models @xcite .",
    "similarly , the estimation of matrix product states @xcite is particularly relevant for many - body systems , but also for estimating dynamical parameters of open systems @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we build on the fruitful cs idea that the sparsity of low rank states can be exploited in order to identify and estimate the state with a _ reduced number of ` measurements ' _ , in contrast to standard , informationally complete qst .",
    "recall that a rank-@xmath0 joint state of @xmath2 qubits can be characterised by @xmath3 parameters , where @xmath4 is the dimension of the associated hilbert space . in the original cs proposal",
    "it is shown that such a state can be recovered from the expectation values of @xmath5 randomly chosen pauli observables .",
    "more recent work concentrates on error bounds @xcite and confidence intervals @xcite of cs estimators .",
    "however , from a statistical and experimental viewpoint the estimation based on pauli expectations does not make the most efficient use of the measurement data available in ion trap experiments .",
    "indeed , the pauli expectations can be seen as ` coarse grained ' statistics of the ` raw data ' which consists of counts for individual outcomes of a measurement in an orthonormal basis .",
    "this coarse graining leads to loss of information and a significant increase in estimation error , as shown in section [ sec.coarse ] .",
    "in contrast , here we consider the statistical problem of estimating low rank states in the set - up of multiple ions tomography ( mit ) , where the input is the counts dataset provided by the experiment .",
    "the goal is to investigate the possibility of using a _ reduced number of measurement settings _ ( pauli bases ) , without a significant loss of statistical accuracy , in comparison to standard , full settings mit . for this",
    ", we consider the behaviour of the mean square error ( mse ) with respect to the frobenius distance between the true state and the estimator @xmath6 , in the limit of large number of measurement samples . according to asymptotic theory @xcite , in this regime the mse of efficient estimators ( e.g. maximum likelihood ) @xmath7 takes the following expression @xmath8 above",
    ", @xmath9 is the classical fisher information associated with the chosen measurement design @xmath10 and a local parametrisation of rank-@xmath0 states , and @xmath11 is the positive weight matrix associated with the quadratic approximation of the frobenius distance in the local parameters . in the following section we review the mit set - up , and formulate the ` reduced settings hypothesis ' in statistical terms .",
    "after this , we present the results of extensive numerical simulations testing this hypothesis , which are summarised in figure [ fig : settings ] .",
    "we find that the asymptotic mse given by ( [ eq.mse.asymptotic ] ) is very robust with respect to a reduction the number of settings , with a choice of random settings making up the measurement design @xmath10 .",
    "for instance , 4 ions states of rank 3 can be estimated by using 20 settings ( out of a total of 81 ) with a negligible increase in estimation error . also , to test the validity of the asymptotic theory for low rank states , we compared the theoretical prediction ( [ eq.mse.asymptotic ] ) with the actual mse of the maximum likelihood estimator and found a very good agreement for @xmath12 repetitions per setting , a typical value used in experiments @xcite .",
    "ions states with ranks @xmath13 , and total sample size @xmath14 . for each rank we chose 10 random states , and for each number of settings @xmath15 ( horizontal axis ) we chose 10 random sets of settings @xmath10 .",
    "the mse for each such combination is represented with a circle , and the lines are the average values . ]    to explain the observed robustness , we outline an argument based on a concentration inequality @xcite for the fisher information matrix of an experiment with randomly chosen pauli settings . transforming the argument into a mathematical proof requires control over certain spectral properties of the fisher information matrix , and remains an open problem .",
    "however , by relaxing the pauli measurement setup , and allowing for measurements with respect to _ random bases _ , we can prove that states of rank @xmath0 can be estimated by using @xmath16 settings , with only a small increase in the mse , relative to the setup in which a large number of settings is probed , cf .",
    "theorem [ th.concentration ] . for pauli measurements we present numerical evidence on the lowest eigenvalue of the fisher information matrix , supporting the conjecture",
    "that the mse of low rank states concentrates for a small number of measurement settings .    from a cs viewpoint , our question",
    "is closely related to the work @xcite inspired by the phaselift problem @xcite which considers the case where the incomplete ` measurements ' are expectations of rank - one projections sampled randomly from a gaussian distribution , or a projective t - design . in @xcite the analysis is extended to the physically relevant case of random orthonormal basis measurements , and it is shown that rank-@xmath0 states become identifiable with a large probability for only @xmath17 ` sufficiently random ' measurements .",
    "these results are in broad agreement with our findings , calling for a better understanding of the connections between the cs estimators and statistical approaches considered here .",
    "in this paper we consider the multiple ions tomographic ( mit ) setup as in the ion - trap experiments @xcite . in mit",
    "the goal is to statistically reconstruct the joint state of @xmath2 ions ( modelled as two - level systems ) , from counts data generated by performing a large number of measurements on identically prepared systems .",
    "the unknown state @xmath18 is a @xmath19 density matrix ( complex , positive trace - one matrix ) where @xmath20 is the dimension of the hilbert space of @xmath2 ions .",
    "the experimenter can measure an arbitrary pauli observable @xmath21 or @xmath22 of each ion , simultaneously on all @xmath2 ions .",
    "thus , each measurement setting is labelled by a sequence @xmath23 out of @xmath24 possible choices .",
    "the measurement produces an outcome @xmath25 , whose probability is @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the one dimensional projection @xmath28 , and , @xmath29 is an eigenvector of the pauli matrix @xmath30 , with a corresponding @xmath31 eigenvalue .",
    "the measurement procedure and statistical model can be summarised as follows . for each setting @xmath32 the experimenter performs @xmath33 repeated measurements and collects the counts of different outcomes @xmath34 , so that the total number of quantum samples used is @xmath35 .",
    "the resulting dataset is a @xmath36 table whose columns are independent and contain all the counts in a given setting .",
    "the overall measurement is informationally complete , and the state can be estimated by using a number of methods proposed in the literature @xcite .",
    "now , there are several reasons to consider a set - up in which a _ smaller _ number of measurement settings are used for estimating the state ; switching measurement settings may be more costly than repeating a measurement in the same setting , and smaller datasets may be easier to handle computationally .",
    "however , by removing even a single setting , the state becomes unidentifiable .",
    "this is because the corresponding tensor of pauli operators is linearly independent from all the one dimensional projections of the remaining settings , and therefore its expectation value can not be estimated .",
    "this can be remedied if some prior information about the state is available .",
    "the relevant example here is from compressed sensing @xcite which shows that low rank states are uniquely determined by the pauli expectations associated with a reduced number of settings .",
    "however , the existing compressed sensing literature does not address the statistical problem of estimating the state directly from the _ raw _ measurement data ( i.e. the counts @xmath37 ) , as it typically employs _ coarse grained _ statistics such as pauli expectations .",
    "our goal is to investigate the statistical efficiency of estimating low rank states with reduced measurement settings .",
    "we will consider an asymptotic scenario in which the number @xmath33 of measurement repetitions per setting is large and the mean square error can be characterised in terms of the classical fisher information , as discussed above . as we show below this regime",
    "is already attained for @xmath12 , which is of the order of repetitions cycles used in experiments @xcite .",
    "as stated above , we assume that the prepared state @xmath18 belongs to the space of rank @xmath0 states @xmath38 , for a fixed rank @xmath39 .",
    "since the asymptotic mean square error depends only on the local properties of the statistical model , it suffices to consider a parametrisation @xmath40 of a neighbourhood of @xmath18 in @xmath41 , which can be chosen as follows . in its own eigenbasis @xmath18",
    "is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues @xmath42 , and any sufficiently close state is uniquely determined by its matrix elements in the first @xmath0 rows ( or columns ) .",
    "intuitively this can be understood by noting that any rank - r state @xmath43 in the neighbourhood of @xmath18 can be obtained by perturbing the eigenvalues and performing a small rotation of the eigenbasis ; in the first order of approximations these transformation leave the @xmath44 lower - right corner unchanged so @xmath45 we therefore choose the ( local ) parametrisation @xmath46 with @xmath47 where , in order to enforce a trace - one normalisation , we constrain the first diagonal matrix element to be @xmath48 . in this parametrisation",
    "we denote @xmath49 , with @xmath50 .",
    "the frobenius distance is locally quadratic in @xmath51 so that @xmath52 where @xmath53 $ ] is a constant weight matrix whose expression can be found in the appendix , below equation ( [ eq.g ] ) .",
    "after fixing the parametrisation , we now define the statistical model of multiple ions tomography with incomplete settings .",
    "let @xmath54 be a set of @xmath15 randomly chosen settings , and consider the modified scenario in which ions prepared in the unknown state @xmath18 are repeatedly measured @xmath55 times for each setting in @xmath10 , so that the overall number of quantum samples is always @xmath56 .",
    "the classical fisher information associated with a single chosen setting @xmath32 is defined as @xmath57    for a set @xmath10 of @xmath15 settings the fisher information matrix associated with a single measurement sample from each setting @xmath58 is given by the sum of the individual fisher matrices @xmath59 , and for later purposes we will denote the average @xmath60 the individual matricies can be computed by using definition ( [ eqn : fisher ] ) together with equation ( [ eq : prob ] ) and the parametrisation ( [ eq.parametrisation ] ) .",
    "since the outcomes from @xmath33 repeated measurements in a setting @xmath32 are i.i.d , when the number of repetitions @xmath33 is sufficiently large , efficient estimators of @xmath51 ( and hence of @xmath18 ) from these outcomes have an asymptotically gaussian distribution @xcite @xmath61    where the covariance matrix @xmath62 is the fisher information associated with a single measurement sample of the set @xmath10 . from this behaviour and the local expansion of the frobenius distance , we see that for ( reasonably ) large @xmath33 , the mean square error of an efficient estimator ( e.g. maximum likelihood ) scales as @xmath63    the trace expression is a measure of the sensitivity of the chosen set of settings @xmath10 at @xmath18 . since the settings are chosen randomly we need to study the fluctuations of @xmath64 . in the next section we present extensive simulation results which essentially show that one can significantly reduce the number of settings without affecting the mse .",
    "in figure [ fig : settings ] we plot the values of the asymptotic mse @xmath65 for various ranks , choices of 4 ions states , and choices of measurement designs @xmath10 ( sets of settings ) . for each rank",
    "@xmath66 we generated @xmath67 states by using the cholesky decomposition @xmath68 , cf .",
    "@xcite . for each state",
    ", the mse values are calculated over a range of measurements with reduced settings , starting from the ` full ' measurement with @xmath24 settings , as follows . for a given number of reduced measurements @xmath15",
    ", we generated 10 independent sets @xmath10 of randomly chosen settings .",
    "for each pair @xmath69 we evaluated the fisher information @xmath70 and the weight matrix @xmath11 in the parametrisation described above . in these simulations ,",
    "the total number of copies of the state is kept constant as a resource .",
    "therefore , a smaller number of measurement settings @xmath15 leads to a larger number of repetitions @xmath71 per setting .",
    "the simulations show that asymptotic risk for low rank states demonstrates only a gradual increase even over a significant reduction in the number of settings measured .",
    "for example , for states of rank 3 , one can reduce the number of settings from 81 to 20 with a negligible increase in the mse .",
    "moreover , for a given @xmath15 , the fluctuations of the mse over choices of states and settings are rather small , showing the robustness of the procedure .    ) , for a @xmath72 ion pure state .",
    "the circles plot the re for the @xmath73 random sets @xmath10 chosen for each @xmath15 number of settings , and the line plots the average relative error . the total sample size is @xmath74 . ]    in the previous section we argued that the theoretical value ( [ eq.mse.fisher ] ) is close to the actual error of an efficient estimator , when the number of samples is reasonably large . to verify this",
    "we have computed the _ maximum likelihood _ ( ml ) estimator and studied its performance in this reduced measurement settings mit setup .",
    "the ml estimator implemented is a modified form of the iterative @xmath75 method in @xcite - for the estimates generated at each iteration of the algorithm , only the @xmath0 largest eigenvalues are retained .",
    "this modification ensures that the ml estimator has knowledge about the rank of the density matrix .",
    "the results of the comparison with the fisher prediction ( [ eq.mse.fisher ] ) are shown in figure [ fig : ml ] , and show a very good agreement between the two . for a given random set @xmath10 of @xmath15 settings ,",
    "the mse of the mle @xmath76 is estimated by averaging the square error over @xmath77 ml estimates .",
    "the relative error @xmath78 is then plotted for each choice of @xmath10 as a single circle . on average ,",
    "the relative error is of order of @xmath79 . in conclusion ,",
    "the simulations indicate that low rank states can be estimated with a significantly smaller number of measurement settings than the total of @xmath24 currently used in experiments , with a negligible loss of statistical accuracy .",
    "why is the mse robust with respect to the reduction of the number of measured settings ? in this section",
    "we provide an intuitive explanation based on a concentration bound for the asymptotic mse , i.e. the random function @xmath80 .",
    "analysing the observed mse concentration for mit with pauli measurements is difficult due to the special , discrete set of bases which contribute to the average .",
    "much like the problem of proving the the rip property in compressed sensing @xcite , it is easier to analyse a more random set - up , namely one where the measurement bases making up the design @xmath10 are drawn randomly from the _ uniform measure _ over orthonormal bases ( onb ) .",
    "we therefore begin by considering this general setup of random measurements and return to the pauli measurements later in the section .",
    "physically , this random setup could be implemented by first rotating the state @xmath18 by a random unitary @xmath81 , after which each atom is measured in the @xmath22 eigenbasis .",
    "we therefore let @xmath82 be the altered design with randomly , uniformly distributed measurement bases",
    ". since the settings in @xmath10 are independent , the fisher information matrices @xmath83 are independent , and for @xmath15 large enough the average information per setting approaches the mean information over all random settings @xmath84.\\ ] ]    since we are interested in the behaviour of the mse for the randomly chosen designs @xmath10 , we look at the relative error @xmath85 and would like to determine the number of settings @xmath15 required for the mse to be concentrated close the optimal value of @xmath86 .    to investigate this mse concentration for states of rank @xmath0 in this setup , we focus our attention on states with equal eigenvalues , i.e. @xmath87 , with respect to its eigenbasis ; due to the unitary symmetry of the random settings design , the eigenbasis can be chosen to be the standard basis .",
    "the reason for choosing this particular spectrum is that such states represent the ` least sparse ' state of rank @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , rank - r states which have some eigenvalues close to zero can be approximated by states of lower ranks , and we expect that they require even smaller number of measurement settings .",
    "the following theorem shows that in order to keep the relative error ( [ eq.re ] ) close to 1 it suffices to take a number of random settings @xmath15 which scales as @xmath88 with respect to rank and hilbert space dimension .",
    "taking into account that one setting provides @xmath89 probabilities , the total number of expectations is of the order @xmath90 which roughly agrees with the number of pauli expectations required in compressed sensing .",
    "we will come back to this comparison in the following section .",
    "[ th.concentration ] let @xmath91 be a design with randomly , uniformly distributed measurement bases .",
    "let @xmath92 be the associated fisher information , and let @xmath93 be the mean fisher information over all possible bases , both calculated at @xmath94 ( as defined above ) . for a sufficiently small @xmath95 , the following inequality holds @xmath96 \\leq { \\rm tr } \\left [ i_\\mathcal{s}^{-1 } g\\right ]   \\leq ( 1+\\epsilon ) { \\rm tr } \\left [ \\overline{i}^{-1 } g \\right ]   \\nonumber\\ ] ] with probability @xmath97 , provided that the number of measurements performed is @xmath98 , with @xmath99 the dimension of the space of rank - r states .",
    "the proof of this theorem is detailed in the appendix , and uses a matrix chernoff bound @xcite , to bound the deviation of @xmath100 from the mean @xmath101 .",
    "this is then recast in terms of a bound on the mse as in the theorem above .",
    "the two bounds show that with probability @xmath97 , the relative error @xmath102 is in the interval @xmath103 $ ] , so using design @xmath10 induces at most an @xmath104 increase of mse .",
    "similar results can be derived along the lines of the proof , for states with arbitrary spectrum .",
    "figure [ fig : concentration ] illustrates this concentration in two ways ; by plotting the relative error @xmath105 and by plotting the eigenvalues of @xmath100 , for various values of @xmath15 .",
    "the concentration in the spectrum of the eigenvalues demonstrates the rate at which @xmath106 approximates the mean fisher information @xmath93 .",
    "we see that for pure states all eigenvalues concentrate around 1 , this is because @xmath101 is an identity matrix for pure states . while for ranks 2 and 3",
    ", this matrix is no longer identity and has eigenvalues that are either 1 or @xmath107 .",
    "we see in the plots for these ranks that the lower band in the eigenvalues spectrum approaches the minimum eigenvalue of @xmath107 , while the remaining eigenvalues concentrate around 1 .",
    "the explicit form of the @xmath101 matrix is detailed in the appendix .",
    "the above theorem guarantees that for a @xmath72 ions pure state , the mse is within 5% of the optimal , with a probability of failure @xmath108 , provided that we measure @xmath109 settings .",
    "however , the bottom - right plot in figure [ fig : concentration ] shows that the mse concentrates much earlier , well within @xmath110 settings .",
    "this indicates that studying the concentration of @xmath100 to bound the mse provides a highly pessimistic estimate for @xmath15 .",
    "note however , that although the value @xmath109 is much larger than the full set of measurements for a 4 ions state in the mit setup , the theorem demonstrates a significant reduction in the number of settings needed when we consider larger states of @xmath111 ions .     for @xmath15 random settings . for a given rank @xmath0 , we chose a random 4 ion state @xmath94 with @xmath0 equal eigenvalues .",
    "we observe a concentration of the eigenvalues as @xmath106 approximates the mean information @xmath93 ( see thm.[th.concentration ] ) .",
    "the bottom right plot graphs the relative error @xmath105 for the different ranks . ]",
    "we now return to the more physical set - up in which the settings are chosen from the set @xmath112 of pauli measurements .",
    "figure [ fig : re ] plots the error @xmath113 of the mses for the reduced settings , relative to the mse of the average information for full @xmath24 settings @xmath114 .",
    "the numerical simulations show that even for @xmath115 settings , the average mse is only 5% higher than the mse of the full settings experiment , while when the variance is taken into account , most mses are less that 10% higher .",
    "we note that in the simulations , the different settings making up the measurement design @xmath10 are chosen without replacement , while an application of the concentration bound in the theorem would use a slightly altered setup in which the different settings are chosen independently and with equal probabilities ( drawing with replacement ) . for a discussion on the relation between the two set - ups",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "the key step in establishing a concentration bound as in theorem [ th.concentration ] is to control the ratio @xmath116 between the largest maximum eigenvalue of @xmath117 over all measurements and the minimum eigenvalue of @xmath118 . in the case of the uniformly distributed settings ,",
    "@xmath119 can be computed explicitly by using analytic expressions for moments of random unitaries @xcite , which gives @xmath120 for @xmath121 , and @xmath122 for pure states , while @xmath123 can be upper bounded by using the inequality between the quantum and classical fisher informations @xcite , as @xmath124 for @xmath121 and @xmath125 for @xmath126 .",
    "together these give a @xmath127 which determines the number of measurement settings @xmath15 in theorem [ th.concentration ] .",
    "for the pauli settings , for a randomly chosen @xmath72 ion pure state .",
    "the thick line plots the mean relative error over 100 different choices of @xmath15 settings , with the light grey circles plotting the relative errors for different choices of the settings . ]    for the pauli measurements set - up , the same upper bound holds for the maximum eigenvalue , but at the moment we do not have a similar lower bound for @xmath128 , where @xmath119 is the average fisher information over _",
    "pauli settings_. however , there is strong numerical evidence that the smallest eigenvalue of @xmath128 remains well bounded away from zero .",
    "figure [ fig : mineigenvalues ] plots the minimum eigenvalues for 100 states of 4 to 8 ions , over three different ranks .",
    "we notice that the minimum eigenvalue for each rank is well concentrated away from zero and for ranks @xmath121 clearly demonstrates an increase with the dimension of the space .",
    "while the full dependence of @xmath129 on @xmath0 and @xmath89 is unclear , we conjecture that for any fixed rank , @xmath129 is larger than a fixed constant for all states of rank @xmath0 , of arbitrarily many ions .",
    "if this was true , it would imply that a state of _ fixed _",
    "rank @xmath0 can be estimated efficiently with @xmath130 settings .",
    "for now , as a step in the direction of proving the conjectured concentration as in theorem [ th.concentration ] for reduced settings , we will prove a weaker result based on a rough lower bound for @xmath129 . from theorem 2 in @xcite we have that for full @xmath24 settings , the mse of an optimal estimator @xmath7 is upper bounded as @xmath131    with @xmath132 being an absolute constant .",
    "asymptotically , the mse is lower bounded by @xmath133 which implies @xmath134 this gives us a rough lower bound on the minimum eigenvalue .",
    "plugging this value into the concentration bound of theorem [ th.concentration ] gives us that the minimum number of settings @xmath15 scales as @xmath135 , which despite being far from optimal , demonstrates a better scaling than the @xmath24 of the ` full settings ' setup .     for the pauli settings .",
    "for a given rank and ion number , we chose randomly 100 different states @xmath94 with @xmath0 equal eigenvalues . ]",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , a similar reduction in the number of ` measurements ' has been found in compressed sensing ( cs ) estimators @xcite , which use @xmath5 expectations of pauli operators to recover the unknown state .",
    "cs techniques provide computationally efficient estimators whose estimation errors scale optimally with the number of parameters and with the errors in the estimation of the pauli expectations .",
    "however , from the statistical viewpoint the pauli expectations are not the most efficient starting point in estimation , as they are ` coarse grained ' statistics of the ` raw ' , or ` fine grained ' measurement data given by the counts @xmath37 .    a single measurement in the ` coarse grained ' model is defined by a pauli observable @xmath136 with @xmath137 , where @xmath138 is the identity matrix . to compute its expectation",
    "one needs to measure @xmath139 to obtain a binary outcome @xmath140 and average over the results .",
    "the outcomes probabilities are @xmath141 where @xmath142 are the two spectral projections of @xmath139 , and the fisher information of this model can be computed in much the same way as that of the pauli bases measurements . in figure",
    "[ fig : cs ] the asymptotic mse @xmath143 is plotted for different sets of randomly chosen pauli observables @xmath144 . on comparison with figure [ fig : settings ]",
    "we see that minimum number of measurements that need to measured in the pauli bases model is much smaller .",
    "additionally , the risk for a full set of measurements is an order of magnitude larger in the ` coarse grained ' model .",
    "this increase in the asymptotic risk has also been pointed out in @xcite .     for the ` coarse grained ' model for multiple ranks , with @xmath72 ions and @xmath145 total measured paulis @xmath146 .",
    "the total number of copies of the states is 8100 .",
    "the experiment is repeated over 10 different states , and 10 random choices of pauli measurements for each state . ]",
    "the discrepancy can be explained by noting that the measurement of @xmath139 is a coarse graining of a finer , onb measurement of a setting such that @xmath147 whenever @xmath148 .",
    "indeed , using the spectral decomposition of @xmath149 , we can compute its expectation as @xmath150 by replacing the probabilities @xmath151 in the above formula by the empirical frequencies @xmath152 we obtain the estimate of the pauli expectations .",
    "however , by constructing this statistic we loose a large amount of information contained in the frequencies , which explains the increase in the mse .",
    "in this paper we investigated the statistical performance of reduced settings measurements in ion tomography .",
    "we did not focus on a particular estimation method but rather on how the accuracy of efficient estimators ( which achieve the asymptotic scaling ( [ eq.mse.asymptotic ] ) of the mse ) depends on the state and the measurement design .",
    "we found that for low rank states , the experimenter can measure a small proportion of randomly selected settings without a significant increase in the mse .",
    "furthermore we presented a possible line of argument for a mathematical proof based on concentration inequality for the fisher information . in the case of measurements with respect to random bases",
    "we showed that certain states of rank @xmath0 can be estimated with @xmath1 settings with an @xmath104 increase in mse compared with designs with a large number of settings .",
    "it remains an open question whether the same scaling of the size of the measurement design holds for the pauli measurements , but we presented strong numerical evidence that the fisher information may satisfy the required spectral properties .    in a future work",
    "we plan to apply these ideas and construct estimators in a more realistic setup where the rank is not a priori known .",

    ", we need to upper bound the largest eigenvalue of @xmath162 over all measurements .",
    "we also need to lower bound the smallest eigenvalue of the expected fisher information @xmath163 .",
    "we will first derive these bounds and then derive the result by applying the chernoff bound .              with the other blocks being zero .",
    "we note that both the fisher , and the weight matrix are of dimension @xmath170 .",
    "+ _ * bound on the largest eigenvalue*_we use the inequality @xmath171 between the classical and quantum fisher informations to bound the largest eigenvalue of @xmath172 over all measurements by the largest eigenvalue of @xmath173 .",
    "the derivation of the quantum fisher matrix presented here follows @xcite .",
    "we calculate the quantum fisher information in the local parametrisation described above , and evaluate it at the diagonal state @xmath94 .",
    "we begin by considering a state @xmath174 locally around some arbitrary rank-@xmath0 state @xmath175 , and write the spectral decomposition as : @xmath176 the quantum fisher information matrix is defined as : @xmath177 = \\frac{1}{2 }   \\tr \\biggl [ \\rho_{\\theta } \\left ( l^a_\\theta l^b_\\theta + l^b_\\theta l^a_\\theta \\right ) \\biggl]\\ ] ] where the symmetric logarithmic derivatives are defined through the equation : @xmath178    we determine the elements of this matrix in the onb formed by the eigenbasis set @xmath179 @xmath180 as pointed out in @xcite , @xmath181 ( and @xmath182 ) is in principle supported on the full space , but its entries for @xmath183 are arbitrary .",
    "however , the fisher information does not use values for which @xmath184 .",
    "this can be seen by expanding ( [ eqn : qfi ] ) in the following way @xmath185 \\nonumber\\\\   & = \\frac{1}{2 } \\sum_i^r \\sum_j^d p_i \\left ( l^a_{\\theta;i , j } l^b_{\\theta;j , i } + l^b_{\\theta;i , j } l^a_{\\theta;j , i } \\right ) \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the index @xmath186 , ( [ eqn : sld ] ) can be inverted inside the expansion of the fisher information as @xmath187 the quantum fisher matrix therefore becomes @xmath188\\ ] ] where we used the fact that @xmath189 is self - adjoint .",
    "since @xmath174 is parameterised by its matrix elements in the eigenbasis @xmath190 of the state @xmath175 , we can use this to write the partial derivatives out explicitly . using the notation that @xmath191 represents the row and column indices for the parameter @xmath192 ,",

    "the integral in the above equation has been evaluated in @xcite , and we do not reproduce the calculation here . however , we point out that the integral in @xcite has been evaluated for a slightly different parametrisation of the state .",
