    "recently , monolayers of group - vib transition metal dichalcogenides @xmath0 ( @xmath1 = mo , w ; @xmath2 = s , se ) have attracted significant interest due to their extraordinary electronic and optical properties .",
    "these two - dimensional semiconductors possess a direct bandgap@xcite in the visible frequency range and exhibit excellent mobility at room temperature,@xcite making them promising candidates for electronic and optoelectronic applications.@xcite    @xmath0 monolayers can be regarded as the semiconductor analog of graphene , with both the conduction and valence band edges located at the two corners of the first brillouin zone ( bz ) , i.e. @xmath8 and @xmath9 points [ fig.[fig:1](c ) ] .",
    "thus , electrons and holes acquire an extra valley degree of freedom , which may be used for information encoding and processing.@xcite following earlier theoretical studies,@xcite it was predicted that inversion symmetry breaking in monolayer @xmath0 gives rise to valley dependent optical transition selection rule , where interband transitions in @xmath8 and @xmath9 valleys couple preferentially to left- and right - circularly polarized light.@xcite this prediction has led to the first experimental observations of dynamical pumping of valley polarization by circularly polarized light in monolayers of mos@xmath10,@xcite followed by the demonstration of electric control of valley circular dichroism in bilayer mos@xmath10@xcite and valley coherence in monolayer wse@xmath10.@xcite moreover , because of the giant spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) in the material,@xcite the absence of inversion symmetry also allows a strong coupling between the spin and the valley degrees of freedom .",
    "@xcite these results suggest that monolayer @xmath0 could possibly be the host for integrated spintronics and valleytronics .    in ref .",
    "where the valley - spin coupled physics is first predicted in monolayer @xmath0 , an effective two - band @xmath11 model is given based on symmetry considerations , which suggests that the band edge electrons and holes can be described as massive dirac fermions .",
    "this @xmath11 model has also been applied to study the transport , optical , and magnetic properties of @xmath0 monolayers@xcite and bilayers.@xcite however , the @xmath11 model is only valid close to the band edge . to obtain a more accurate description of the band structure ,",
    "several tight - binding ( tb ) and @xmath11 models have been recently introduced at the expense of including more orbitals into the hamiltonian.@xcite    in this paper , we develop a minimal symmetry - based three - band tb model using only the @xmath1-@xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 orbitals .",
    "we show that , by including only the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) hoppings , this tb model is sufficient to capture the band - edge properties in the @xmath6 valleys , including the energy dispersions as well as the berry curvatures . by including up to the third - nearest - neighbor ( tnn ) @xmath1-@xmath1 hoppings , our model can well reproduce the energy bands in the entire bz .",
    "all parameters in our model are determined accurately by fitting the first - principles ( fp ) energy bands and results for @xmath2 = te are also shown for systematical purpose although @xmath1te@xmath10 monolayers are not realized experimentally now .",
    "soc effects are studied under the approximation of on - site spin - orbit interaction , which results in a large valence - band spin splitting at the @xmath8 point . besides , for the small but finite conduction - band spin splitting at @xmath8 recently noted,@xcite we reveal here a sign difference between mo@xmath7 and w@xmath7 , and",

    "<S> we present a three - band tight - binding ( tb ) model for describing the low - energy physics in monolayers of group - vib transition metal dichalcogenides @xmath0 ( @xmath1=mo , w ; @xmath2=s , se , te ) . as the conduction and valence band edges </S>",
    "<S> are predominantly contributed by the @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 orbitals of @xmath1 atoms , the tb model is constructed using these three orbitals based on the symmetries of the monolayers . </S>",
    "<S> parameters of the tb model are fitted from the first - principles energy bands for all @xmath0 monolayers . </S>",
    "<S> the tb model involving only the nearest - neighbor @xmath1-@xmath1 hoppings is sufficient to capture the band - edge properties in the @xmath6 valleys , including the energy dispersions as well as the berry curvatures . </S>",
    "<S> the tb model involving up to the third - nearest - neighbor @xmath1-@xmath1 hoppings can well reproduce the energy bands in the entire brillouin zone . </S>",
    "<S> spin - orbit coupling in valence bands is well accounted for by including the on - site spin - orbit interactions of @xmath1 atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the conduction band also exhibits a small valley - dependent spin splitting which has an overall sign difference between mo@xmath7 and w@xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the origins of these corrections to the three - band model . </S>",
    "<S> the three - band tb model developed here is efficient to account for low - energy physics in @xmath0 monolayers , and its simplicity can be particularly useful in the study of many - body physics and physics of edge states .    </S>",
