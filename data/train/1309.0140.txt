    "the easiest to understand and to manipulate , and the most natural states of the quantum harmonic oscillator are the number states @xmath0 .",
    "number states are eigenstates of the hamiltonian and , of course , are also eigenstates of the number operator @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the well known creation and annihilation operators , respectively .",
    "however , for any @xmath4 , no matter how big , the mean field is zero ; i.e. , @xmath5 , and we know that a classical field changes sinusoidally in time in each point of space ; thus , these states can not be associated with classical fields [ 1 , 2 ] .    in the first years of the sixties of the past century , glauber [ 3 ] and sudarshan [ 4 ] introduced the coherent states , and it has been shown that these states are the most classical ones . coherent states are denoted as @xmath6 , and one way to define them is as eigenstates of the annihilation operator ; that is , @xmath7 .",
    "an equivalent definition is obtained applying the glauber displacement operator @xmath8 to the vacuum : @xmath9 ; we see then coherent states as vacuum displaced states .",
    "coherent states also have the very important property that they minimize the uncertainty relation for the two orthogonal field quadratures with equal uncertainties in each quadrature [ 1 , 2 ] .",
    "since then , other states have been introduced . in particular , squeezed states [ 5 ]",
    "have attracted a great deal of attention over the years because their properties allow to reduce the uncertainties either of the position or momentum , while still keeping the uncertainty principle to its minimum .",
    "because of this , they belong to a special class of states named minimum uncertainty states . once produced , for instance as electromagnetic fields in cavities , they may be monitored via two level atoms in order to check , or measure , that such states have been indeed generated [ 6 , 7 ] .",
    "based on the above properties , we can think on the eigenstates of the position as limit cases of the squeezed states . as",
    "the squeezed states are minimum uncertainty states , we can reduced to zero the uncertainty in the position , while the uncertainty in the momentum goes to infinity , so that we keep the uncertainty principle to its minimum .",
    "of course , there is also the option to reduce to zero the uncertainty in the momentum , while the position gets completely undefined , obtaining that way the possibility to define momentum eigenstates . in sections 1 and 2",
    ", we analyze the possibility of define the position eigenstates as the limit of extreme squeezing of the squeezed states . in what follows",
    ", we will use a unit system such that @xmath10 .",
    "there are two equivalent forms to define the squeezed states . in the first one , introduced by yuen [ 8 ] ,",
    "squeezed states are obtained from the vacuum as @xmath11 where @xmath12\\ ] ] is the so - called squeeze operator . in this view , squeezed states are created displacing the vacuum , and after , squeezing it .",
    "note that when the squeeze parameter @xmath13 is zero , the squeezed states reduce to the coherent states . in this work",
    ", we will consider only real squeeze parameters , as that is enough for our intentions .    in the way followed by caves [ 9 ] ,",
    "the vacuum is squeezed and the resulting state is then displaced ; that means , that in this approach @xmath14 both definitons of the squeezed states agree when the squeeze factor is the same , @xmath15 , and when the modified amplitude @xmath16 of the caves approach is given by @xmath17 being @xmath18 and @xmath19    to analyze the uncertainties in the position and in the momentum of the squeezed states , we introduce , following loudon and knight [ 5 ] , the quadrature operators @xmath20 and @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the position operator and @xmath23 the momentum operator . note that the quadrature operators are essentially the position and momentum operators ; this definition just provides us with two operators that have the same dimensions .    in order to show that really the squeezed states are",
    "minimum uncertainty states , we need to calculate the expected values in the squeezed state ( 1 ) of the quadrature operators ( 7 ) and ( 8) , and its squares . using ( 7 ) and ( 1 ) , we get @xmath24 the action of the squeeze operator on the creation and annihilation operators is obtained using the hadamard s lemma [ 10 , 11 ] , @xmath25 such that @xmath26 therefore , as @xmath7 and @xmath27 , it is easy to see that @xmath28 and that @xmath29 so , we obtain for the uncertainty in the quadrature operator @xmath30 , @xmath31 proceeding in exactly the same way for the quadrature operator @xmath32 , we obtain @xmath33 as we already said , we can then think in the position eigenstates and in the momentum eigenstates as limit cases of squeezed states .",
    "indeed , when the squeeze parameter @xmath13 goes to infinity , the uncertainty in the position goes to zero , and the momentum is completely undetermined .",
    "of course , when the squeeze parameter goes to minus infinity , we have the inverse situation , and we can think in define that way the momentum eigenstates . in the two following sections , we use the yen and the caves definitions of the squeezed states to test this hypothesis .",
    "from equation ( 14 ) above , we can see that in the limit @xmath34 the uncertainty for position vanishes and so a position eigenstate should be obtained ( from now on , we consider @xmath35 real ) , @xmath36 we have written a sub index @xmath37 in the position eigenstate in order to emphasis that fact .",
    "following the yuen definition @xmath38 , so @xmath39 we now write the squeeze operator as [ 12 ] @xmath40 where , as we already said , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "so , @xmath43 now , we develop the first operator ( from right to left ) in power series , we use the definition of the coherent states , @xmath44 , to obtain @xmath45 as @xmath34 , @xmath46 , which means that the only term that survives from the sum is @xmath47 , and then @xmath48 that would give an approximation for how to obtain a position eigenstate from the vacuum .",
    "however , note that the above expression does not depend on @xmath49 and therefore can not be correct .",
    "we now squeeze the vacuum and after we displace it . thus , in this case , @xmath50 we use again expression @xmath51 for the squeeze operator [ 12 ] , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are defined in ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) , and we write the displacement operator as @xmath54 [ 12 ] , to obtain @xmath55 as @xmath56 and @xmath57 , we cast the previous formula as @xmath58 inserting two times the identity operator , written as @xmath59 , we get @xmath60 , and using the hadamard s lemma [ 10 ] , it is easy to prove that @xmath61 for any well behaved function @xmath62 ; thus @xmath63\\exp \\left[-\\frac{\\nu } { 2\\mu } \\left(\\hat{a}^{\\dagger } -\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2\\right]|0\\rangle .\\ ] ] after some algebra , @xmath64\\exp \\left[-\\frac{\\nu } { 2\\mu } \\hat{a}^{\\dagger^{2}}+\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(1+\\frac{\\nu } { \\mu } \\right)\\hat{a}^{\\dagger } \\right]|0\\rangle .\\ ] ] we take now the limit when @xmath34 , or @xmath65 , so @xmath66 we get an expression that gives us the position eigenstates as an operator applied to the vacuum .",
    "unlike the yuen case , expression ( 21 ) , now we have an @xmath49 dependence and it looks like a better candidate to be the position eigenstate .",
    "in fact , in the next section , we will show that this really is an eigenstate of the position .",
    "we will try now an alternative approach to the eigenstates of the position .",
    "we can write a position eigenstate , simply by multiplying it by a proper unit operator @xmath67 therefore the position eigenstate @xmath68 may be written as [ 13 ] @xmath69 with @xmath70 ; such that @xmath68 may be re - written as @xmath71 that may be added via using the generating function for hermite polynomials [ 14 ] @xmath72 to give @xmath73 the above expression allows us to write the position eigenstate as an operator applied to the vacuum .",
    "note that this expression is the same as the one obtained using the caves definition for the squeezed states , formula ( 28 ) .",
    "we prove now that indeed ( 32 ) is an eigenvector of the postion operator ; for that , we write the position operator as @xmath74 , thus @xmath75 inserting the identity operator in the above expression as @xmath76 , we get @xmath77 as @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath56 , we obtain @xmath80 as we wanted to show",
    ".    we can write ( 32 ) in terms of coherent states .",
    "we have @xmath81 thus @xmath82    with the expressions obtained , it is easy to show that the squeezed states have the form of a gaussian wave packet . to confirm this , we use the above expression to state that @xmath83 we write @xmath84 as @xmath85 , where we have just inserted the identity operator @xmath86 , and we use that @xmath87 , for any well behaved function @xmath88 , to obtain @xmath89}{\\pi ^{1/4}}\\langle \\alpha |e^{-\\frac{\\hat{a}^{\\dagger^{2 } } } { 2}}e^{\\frac{r}{2}\\hat{a}^2-r\\hat{a}^{\\dagger } \\hat{a}}|\\sqrt{2}x\\rangle .\\ ] ] as the coherent states @xmath6 are eigenfunctions of the annihilation operator @xmath3 , it is very easy to show that @xmath90 , so @xmath91}{\\pi ^{1/4}}\\langle \\alpha |e^{\\frac{r}{2}\\hat{a}^2-r\\hat{a}^{\\dagger}\\hat{a}}|\\sqrt{2}x\\rangle .\\ ] ] in the appendix , we disentangle the operator @xmath92 as @xmath93 , and we get @xmath91}{\\pi ^{1/4}}\\langle \\alpha |e^{-r\\hat{a}^{\\dagger } \\hat{a}}e^{\\frac{1-e^{2r}}{4}\\hat{a}^2}|\\sqrt{2}x\\rangle .\\ ] ] it is very easy to see that @xmath94 , and that @xmath95 , thus @xmath96   \\right\\rbrace   \\left\\langle \\alpha|\\sqrt{2}e^{-r}x\\right\\rangle .\\ ] ] finally , as @xmath97 , we have @xmath98\\right\\},\\ ] ] as we wanted to show .",
    "we can now find the wave function of a coherent state as a function of the position [ 15 ] .",
    "we use equation ( 32 ) , that express the eigenstates of the position as an operator acting on the vacuum , and get that @xmath100{\\pi } } e^{-\\frac{\\beta^{*^{2 } } } { 2}+\\sqrt{2 } \\beta ^ * x } \\left\\langle \\beta|0\\right\\rangle   = \\frac{e^{-\\frac{x^2}{2 } } } { \\pi^{1/4 }   } e^{-\\frac{\\beta^{*^{2 } } } { 2}-\\frac{\\left| \\beta \\right| ^2}{2}+\\sqrt{2 } \\beta ^ * x}\\ ] ] as @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",

    "we have found an operator that applied to the vacuum gives us the eigenstates of the position .",
    "we did that by two ways ; first , using the caves definition of the squeezed states , we took the limit of extreme squeezing in the position side , to get the position eigenstate .",
    "second , we used the expansion of an arbitrary wave function in the base of the harmonic oscillator ; i.e. , we wrote an arbitrary wave function in terms of hermite polynomials .",
    "the expressions obtained allows us to show certain properties of the squeezed states , and also allow us to write in a very easy way the husimi _",
    "q_-function of the position eigenstates . the same procedure can be followed to find the eigenstates of the momentum , but taken the limit when the squeeze parameters goes to @xmath109 .",
    "+ we can also conclude that from the point of view of this work , the caves approach to the squeeze states is more adequate , since it gives the correct eigenstates of the position ; while the yuen definition , formula ( 1 ) , gives an expression that is incorrect .",
    "so , we must first squeeze the vacuum , and after , we displace it .",
    "in this appendix , we show how to disentangle the operator @xmath110 .",
    "we define @xmath111 and we suppose that ( 48 ) can be rewritten as @xmath112\\exp \\left[g(r)\\hat{a}^2\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath113 and @xmath114 are two unknown well behaved functions ; as @xmath115 , being @xmath116 the identity operator , these functions most satisfy the conditions @xmath117 . at first sight , one can think that in the proposal ( 45 ) should be a term of the form @xmath118 $ ] ; however , this is not the case because @xmath119=2\\hat{a}^2 $ ] .",
    "we differentiate with respect to @xmath13 , to find @xmath120\\exp \\left[g\\hat{a}^2\\right]+\\frac{dg}{dr}\\exp \\left[f\\hat{a}^{\\dagger } \\hat{a}\\right]\\hat{a}^2\\exp \\left[g\\hat{a}^2\\right],\\ ] ] where for simplicity in the notation , we have dropped all @xmath13-dependency ; we write the identity operator as @xmath121\\exp \\left[f\\hat{a}^{\\dagger } \\hat{a}\\right]$ ] in the second term , to obtain @xmath120\\exp \\left[g\\hat{a}^2\\right]+\\frac{dg}{dr}\\exp \\left[f\\hat{a}^{\\dagger } \\hat{a}\\right]\\hat{a}^2\\exp \\left[-f\\hat{a}^{\\dagger } \\hat{a}\\right]\\exp \\left[f\\hat{a}^{\\dagger } \\hat{a}\\right]\\exp \\left[g\\hat{a}^2\\right].\\ ] ] using the hadamard s lemma [ 10 , 11 ] , it is very easy to prove that @xmath122\\hat{a}^2\\exp \\left[-f\\hat{a}^{\\dagger } \\hat{a}\\right]=e^{-2f}\\hat{a}^2,\\ ] ] so @xmath123 equating this equation to the one obtained differentiating the original formula for @xmath124 , equation ( 44 ) , we get the following system of first order ordinary differential equations @xmath125 the solution of the first equation , that satisfies the initial condition @xmath126 , is the function @xmath127 . substituting this solution in the second equation and solving it with the initial condition @xmath128 , we obtain @xmath129 .",
