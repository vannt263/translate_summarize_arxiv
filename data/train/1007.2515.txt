    "in solar physics , the na  d@xmath0 absorption profile has long been a difficult line to study , and indeed model .",
    "line profile fluctuations often result from a combination of doppler wavelength shifts , p - mode oscillations and other small - scale dynamical phenomena @xcite .",
    "furthermore , temperature , microturbulence and magnetic field strength can affect the associated na  d@xmath0 line depths @xcite .",
    "the formation height of the na  d@xmath0 core has often been the most difficult to interpret .",
    "@xcite used slitless spectrograms to estimate a core formation height of 13001700  km .",
    "this is above the formation height of the ca  k core ( @xmath21200  km ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and overlaps with that of the h@xmath4 core ( @xmath21500  km ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , observations indicate that na  d@xmath0 core images have little in common with their ca  k or h@xmath4 counterparts . @xcite",
    "have utilized theoretical na  d@xmath0 response functions to suggest that the formation height varies depending on the local temperature and/or velocity .",
    "the authors estimate a na  d@xmath0 core formation height of @xmath51000  km , based upon the non - local thermodynamic equilibrium radiative transfer code of @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the work of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , who suggest na  d@xmath0 line - core emission originates from the upper photospheric layer ( @xmath5800  km ) .",
    "recent na  d@xmath0 observations and simulations have revealed that na  d@xmath0 core brightenings sample magnetic field concentrations in the quiet solar network @xcite . through a comparison of simultaneous _ mdi _ magnetograms with",
    "ground - based na  d@xmath6 observations , @xcite were able to suggest that sodium bright points are coincident in position , size and shape with corresponding magnetic patches .",
    "however , the relatively poor spatial resolution of _ mdi _ ( @xmath21.2@xmath7 ) limited the study to network bright points in excess of @xmath23@xmath7 photospheric diameter .",
    "thus , it is imperative to study these types of bright features with an imaging system capable of high spatial resolution . in this paper",

    "the data presented here are part of an observing sequence obtained during 13:46  14:47  ut on 2009 may 28 , with the dunn solar telescope at sacramento peak , new mexico . the rapid oscillations in the solar atmosphere ( rosa ; *",
    "* ) six - camera system was employed in conjunction with the interferometric bidimensional spectrometer ( ibis ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to image a @xmath12  @xmath13  @xmath14 region positioned at solar disk center .",
    "ibis sampled the na  d@xmath0 absorption line at 5895.94   , incorporating nine wavelength steps with ten exposures per step to assist image reconstruction . more details of our instrumentation setup are given in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "a spatial sampling of @xmath15 per pixel was used for the rosa cameras , to match the telescope s diffraction - limited resolution in the blue continuum to that of the ccd .",
    "this results in images obtained at longer wavelengths being slightly oversampled .",
    "however , this was deemed desirable to keep the dimensions of the field of view the same for all rosa cameras .",
    "ibis employed a spatial sampling of @xmath16 per pixel , which allowed rosa s near square field - of - view to be contained within the circular aperture provided by ibis .    during the observations ,",
    "high - order adaptive optics @xcite were used to correct wavefront deformations in real - time .",
    "the acquired images were further improved through speckle reconstruction algorithms @xcite , utilizing @xmath17 and @xmath18 restorations for rosa and ibis images , respectively .",
    "post - reconstruction cadences for rosa and ibis are displayed in the fourth column of table  [ table1 ] .",
    "a full image - reconstructed ibis scan through the na  d@xmath0 absorption line resulted in a cadence of 39.703  s , and includes a blueshift correction required due to the use of classical etalon mountings @xcite . to insure accurate coalignment in all bandpasses ,",
    "broadband time series were fourier co - registered and de - stretched using a @xmath19 grid , equating to a @xmath20 separation between spatial samples @xcite .",
    "narrowband images , including those from ibis , were corrected by applying destretching vectors established from simultaneous broadband reference images @xcite .",
    "line - of - sight magnetograms were generated as a difference image , normalized to their sum , of left- and right - hand circularly polarized light , obtained 125  m into the blue wing of the magnetically - sensitive fe   absorption line at 6302.5   . utilizing high - resolution _ mdi _ magnetograms of a small active region , obtained in conjunction with rosa using an identical optical setup , and following the previous work of @xcite , these normalized difference images were subsequently scaled to provide calibrated line - of - sight magnetograms . due to the rosa cameras remaining within their linear regime , and _",
    "mdi _ observations residing below their saturation threshold , only linear corrections were required to produce calibrated line - of - sight magnetograms @xcite .",
    "no active regions were present on disk during our observations , and the rosa / ibis field - of - view contained no large - scale magnetic activity . however , a small collection of magnetic bright points ( mbps ) were visible at heliocentric co - ordinates ( @xmath21,@xmath22 ) , providing an opportunity to examine these kilogauss structures without the line - of - sight effects associated with near - limb observations .",
    "figure  [ f1 ] shows snapshots of all the rosa / ibis sub - images obtained at 14:06:21  ut , and reveals a collection of intensity enhancements , visible in the core of the na  d@xmath0 line ( lower - middle panel of fig .  [ f1 ] ) .",
    "ca  k observations were acquired through a 1   wide filter , with resulting emission originating from the upper photosphere to the lower chromosphere ( see e.g. lower - right panel of fig .",
    "the na  d@xmath0 core image is an intensity map , created by establishing the line - profile minimum per pixel . by displaying doppler - compensated line - center intensities , rather than rest - wavelength line - center intensities , brightness variations throughout the image",
    "are more indicative of the source function than of the velocities present in the line - forming region @xcite .",
    "examination of g - band ( upper - left panel of fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ) and na  d@xmath0 core images reveal , crucially , that not all na  d@xmath0 core brightenings can be directly linked to underlying mbps .",
    "thus , there may be two possible interpretations which promote efficient na  d@xmath0 core brightening .",
    "the first implies independent heating processes , whereby magnetic and non - magnetic brightenings are produced via unrelated mechanisms .",
    "contrarily , another interpretation revolves around the same heating mechanism , but that the process is somehow more effective in highly magnetic areas , such as those found in mbp locations .",
    "therefore , it is important to investigate small - scale mbps , and establish which process allows enhancement of the na  d@xmath0 line above these @xmath23 g - band structures .",
    "information contained within the na  d@xmath0 core velocity maps , generated through doppler - shifts of the profile minimum , begins to unlock this mystery .",
    "an inspection of figure  [ f1 ] reveals a preference for na  d@xmath0 and g - band mbp structures to exist in downflow regions ( up to 7  kms@xmath1 ) .",
    "furthermore , ca  k core and h@xmath4 core intensity enhancements are often observed to co - exist in locations of strong downflows ( @xmath243  kms@xmath1 ) and longitudinal magnetic fields .",
    "figure  [ f2 ] shows a slice through a typical high red shift feature , displaying its g - band intensity , na  d@xmath0 core intensity , magnetic field strength , and na  d@xmath0 line - core velocity as a function of distance across the underlying mbp .    in the top - right panel of figure  [ f3 ] , we present an averaged na  d@xmath0 line profile ( solid line ) from the central region of a mbp , labelled ` a ' in figure  [ f1 ] , where high redshifts are observed . a dashed line represents a na  d@xmath0 profile , which has been spatially , and temporally , averaged over the entire field - of - view and time series ( in excess of @xmath25 individual profiles ) .",
    "it is evident that the mbp profile has been significantly doppler shifted when compared to the average na  d@xmath0 profile .",
    "the difference between these two profiles is displayed in the bottom - right panel of figure  [ f3 ] , and reveals a blue bump at @xmath2@xmath264  kms@xmath1 , alongside a red shifted dip at @xmath28  kms@xmath1 .",
    "these asymmetries are indicative of shock formation below the chromospheric canopy , and are in remarkable agreement with the simulations of @xcite .",
    "@xcite investigated velocity flows associated with the na  d@xmath0 line in strong magnetic field regions surrounding active regions and sunspots .",
    "these authors detected an abundance of downflows in these locations , with velocities nearing 2  kms@xmath1 .",
    "as shown in the lower - right panel of figure  [ f2 ] , the na  d@xmath0 core velocities presented here are considerably higher , reaching @xmath27  kms@xmath1 at the center of the mbp .",
    "even artificially binning our data to mimic the resolution of @xcite would not reduce the peak na  d@xmath0 doppler velocities to below @xmath27  kms@xmath1 .",
    "however , the spectral resolution of ibis ( 23  m fwhm ) is considerably better than the resolution obtained by the multichannel subtractive double pass system ( 144  m fwhm ) employed by @xcite , and allows a higher degree of precision when determining line - core velocities .",
    "quantitatively , the doppler velocity error , @xmath28 , can be defined as @xmath29 @xcite , where @xmath30 is the line - core wavelength and @xmath31 is the speed of light .",
    "this produces an associated ibis velocity error of @xmath320.5  kms@xmath1 , compared to an error of @xmath323.7  kms@xmath1 in the results of @xcite .",
    "in addition , na  d@xmath0 downdraft velocities approaching 7  kms@xmath1 are consistent with the magneto - hydrodynamic simulations of @xcite .",
    "thus , for the first time , the combined high spatial and spectral resolutions of speckle - reconstructed na  d@xmath0 ibis data sets allow fine - scale doppler velocities to be evaluated with an unprecedented degree of precision .    from the lower panels of figure  [ f2 ] , we see that mbp structures found in na  d@xmath0 core imaging demonstrate an increased width over simultaneous g - band observations .",
    "this is consistent with the `` aureoles '' , or halos , found by @xcite , who interpret these additional brightenings as an artifact of strong radiative scattering .",
    "it must be noted that the decrease in normalized intensity to values below 1.0 , at the edges of the g - band mbp , is due to intensity sampling of the dark inter - granular lane , where the mbp resides .",
    "examination of figure  [ f2 ] suggests that the fastest downdrafts are co - spatial with the center of the mbp , and that the velocities drop to approximately zero at the edge of the structure .",
    "furthermore , the strongest longitudinal magnetic field strength is also co - spatial with the center of the mbp , and correlates well in size with the width of the g - band structure .",
    "following analysis of all mbps observed with red shifts exceeding 3  kms@xmath1 and underlying magnetic field concentrations , prevailing symmetry is found in intensity , velocity and magnetic - field strength , as a function of radial distance from the center of the mbp .",
    "this indicates the preference for an ordered structure , whereby maximum values are attributed to the center of the mbp , and steeply decaying measurements are found at increasing distances from the center .",
    "investigating the intensity excess of mbps , which correspond to all mbps containing strong ( @xmath243  kms@xmath1 ) downflows and g - band inter - granular brightenings , reveals a correlation with the underlying magnetic field concentrations .",
    "figure  [ f4 ] reveals how the intensity excess of g - band , ca  k and na  d@xmath0 observations varies as a function of the magnetic flux density , @xmath33 , defined as the total magnetic field strength divided by the number of occupied pixels .",
    "the excess intensity , @xmath34 , is determined as an averaged pixel intensity for the entire mbp , following a subtraction of intensities equal to the modal value observed in quiet areas ( central panels of figure  [ f2 ] ) . for g - band images , mbps are isolated from granules and inter - granular lanes using the automated routines of @xcite .",
    "these isolated pixels also provide the structures used to determine the magnetic flux density from the line - of - sight magnetograms . na  d@xmath0",
    "core mbp observations consist of a bright central structure , surrounded by a dimmer halo , resulting from radiative scattering @xcite .",
    "the central mbp is isolated from the halo by utilizing simultaneous na  d@xmath0 core velocity maps .",
    "the lower - right panel of figure  [ f2 ] reveals how the downdraft velocities drop to approximately zero at the edge of the bright central mbp .",
    "therefore , pixels where the downdraft velocity is non - zero are used to isolate the central mbp regions , thus minimizing contributions to the excess intensity caused by radiative scattering , which is only weakly dependent on the magnetic field strength .    in the case of g - band observations ( upper panel of fig .  [ f4 ] ) , a linear dependence observed in the log  log plot is in agreement with @xcite , who detect identical trends for g - band brightenings in active region moats . through analyses of network",
    "bright points ( @xmath243@xmath7 in diameter ) and large - scale active region structures ( @xmath2415@xmath7 in diameter ) , @xcite and @xcite were able to demonstrate a similar trend for these features when observed in the na  d@xmath6 and ca  k lines , respectively . indeed , for the magnetic flux densities presented here ( above @xmath2150  g in the case of sodium ) , the calcium , g - band and sodium excesses ( fig .",
    "[ f4 ] ) are best fitted by a power law of the type @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the power - law exponent . here , we determine @xmath37 for ca  k observations , and @xmath38 in the case of na  d@xmath0 data .",
    "these values of power - law exponent are in agreement with the previous na  d@xmath6 study of @xcite , and remain consistent with exponents found in ca  k investigations @xcite .",
    "while these consistencies with previously published work may seem initially superfluous , the spatial scale over which these results agree is extraordinary .",
    "@xcite investigated large - scale magnetic structures contained within an active region , often with spatial sizes approaching @xmath39 in diameter .",
    "the mbps investigated here consist of structures as small as @xmath20.2@xmath7 in diameter , more than two orders of magnitude smaller than those studied previously . at magnetic flux densities below @xmath2150  g",
    ", there is an appreciable `` turn - off '' from the power - law fit applied to the na  d@xmath0 observations .",
    "the lower panel of figure  [ f4 ] reveals how the na  d@xmath0 intensity remains elevated , even as the magnetic flux density begins to diminish . through analysis of ca",
    "k observations , @xcite suggest large deviations in line - core intensity , at relatively small magnetic flux densities , may be a result of a large inclination of the magnetic flux tubes , or small - scale energetic phenomena .",
    "inclination effects on the data presented here are not believed to be significant for two reasons .",
    "firstly , the inclination angle of mbps , with respect to the vertical , is typically less than @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "secondly , due to the observations being acquired at disk center , line - of - sight effects are minimized .",
    "this allows photospheric structures to remain co - spatial when observed in chromospheric passbands , and since no feature migration is found between g - band and ca  k atmospheric heights , further solidifies the presence of minimal inclination angles .",
    "additionally , the intensities of mbps corresponding to g - band , ca  k and na  d@xmath0 observations show no temporal variations that may be suggestive of microflare @xcite and/or ellerman bomb @xcite activity . through examination of photospheric g - band mbps , we observe the physical area of such structures to reduce as the magnetic field becomes weaker , corroborating the observational results of @xcite .",
    "contrarily , we find mbps , which correspond to magnetic flux densities below the turn - off at @xmath2150  g , show similar two - dimensional areas when viewed in the na  d@xmath0 line core . an average na  d@xmath0 core area of 0.11@xmath320.01  mm@xmath41 ( 47@xmath324  pixels ) is found for these structures , suggesting their excess intensity plateau below @xmath2150  g may be related to the physical expansion of magnetic flux tubes .",
    "@xcite utilize models based upon infrared spectral lines to infer how small magnetic flux tubes expand more rapidly as a function of atmospheric height , when compared to larger magnetic structures .",
    "thus , in order to maintain relatively constant physical sizes present in na  d@xmath0 observations , it is necessary for the physically smaller ( and weaker ) magnetic field concentrations in the photosphere to expand at a greater rate . to quantify this result , we find mbps at the lowest magnetic flux densities ( @xmath250  g )",
    "show a @xmath376% increase in area between g - band and na  d@xmath0 observations , compared to a @xmath344% increase for mbps near the @xmath2150  g turn - off .",
    "a discontinuity in the correlation between the magnetic field and na  d@xmath0 intensity , for magnetic flux densities below @xmath2150  g , suggests that these mbp intensities are independent of the underlying magnetic field strength .",
    "combining na  d@xmath0 observations with 3d non - lte simulations , @xcite conclude that the na  d@xmath0 line is not chromospheric in nature , and instead samples the atmospheric layer below the magnetic canopy , where magneto - acoustic shocks are believed to dominate .",
    "our findings may therefore indicate a two - component heating process ; one which is primarily acoustic and dominates the heating of low magnetic field strength areas , while the other process is predominantly magnetic in nature . within the presented data ,",
    "mbps with velocities exceeding 3  kms@xmath1 represent the dominant population .",
    "however , as mbps can exist with velocities below this threshold , their excess intensity behaviour , as a function of magnetic flux density , may differ as a result .",
    "we note that two - component heating models have previously been proposed to interpret observed chromospheric flux densities in the most inactive solar - type stars @xcite .",
    "joint observations , acquired with the rapid oscillations in the solar atmosphere ( rosa ) and interferometric bidimensional spectrometer ( ibis ) imaging systems , have enabled unprecedented views of solar magnetic bright points ( mbps ) .",
    "these data , obtained simultaneously with high spatial , temporal and spectral resolutions , have revealed how mbps manifesting in the na  d@xmath0 core are found to preferentially exist in regions containing downflows , in addition to co - spatial underlying magnetic field concentrations .",
    "downdrafts found within na  d@xmath0 bright points exhibit speeds of up to 7  kms@xmath1 , with preferred structural symmetry in intensity , magnetic field and velocity profiles about the center of the mbp .",
    "excess intensities associated with g - band and ca  k observations of mbps demonstrating downdrafts exceeding 3  kms@xmath1 reveal a power - law trend when plotted as a function of magnetic flux density .",
    "however , na  d@xmath0 observations of the same magnetic features indicate an intensity plateau at weak magnetic field strengths below @xmath2150  g. we interpret this phenomena as the physical expansion of magnetic flux tubes , with weak field strengths ( @xmath250  g ) expanding by @xmath376% , compared to @xmath344% expansion for structures at higher magnetic field strengths ( @xmath2150  g ) .",
