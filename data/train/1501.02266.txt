    "graphene as the basis of a new generation of electronics@xcite has been the center of much attention in the last years , and devices based on nanostructured graphene have been put forward .",
    "the most generic form of nanostructured graphene is graphene nanoribbons ( gnr),@xcite and other structures , such as graphene anti - dot lattices@xcite , can be viewed as networks of them .",
    "gnrs are potential candidates for molecular wires with tailored conductance properties . for graphene - based nanostructures",
    "the edges and their passivation , as well as defects inside the structure , can play crucial roles for the transport properties.@xcite however , characterization of edge passivation or structural / chemical defects is challenging especially after device fabrication .",
    "raman spectroscopy@xcite can give information about defects on large areas of the sample , while tip - enhanced raman spectroscopy ( ters)@xcite have been used in combination with stm on gnrs .",
    "however , raman studies involve averages over larger areas ( > 10 nm ) , and does not yield information about the impact of vibrations on transport . in",
    "that aspect inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy ( iets ) serves as a way of performing non - destructive characterization yielding vibrational / phonon fingerprints of a range of defects . in order to interpret iets experiments , theoretical modeling of the inelastic signals in the electronic current due to electron - phonon ( e - ph ) scattering is needed .",
    "gnrs have been fabricated using different strategies including lithographic techniques,@xcite chemical synthesis,@xcite epitaxial growth@xcite , and longitudinal unzipping of carbon nanotubes.@xcite furthermore , several groups have succeeded in atomically precise bottom - up fabrication of armchair gnrs ( agnr)@xcite , chiral gnrs,@xcite and agnr hetero - junctions@xcite grown on metal surfaces .",
    "experimentally , the vibrational properties have been investigated by raman spectroscopy and the electronic structure has been mapped out by stm , angle - resolved ( two - photon ) photo - emission and high - resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy.@xcite signatures of phonon excitation were observed by stm in the differential conductance spectroscopy performed at the zigzag termini state of agnrs adsorbed on au(111 ) , and these signatures were shown to be sensitive to modifications in the local atomic geometry.@xcite agnrs have also been lifted up from the weakly bonding au(111 ) surface with the tip of a stm enabling measurements of the voltage - dependent conductance in suspended configurations.@xcite    from the theoretical side density - functional theory ( dft ) has been used to investigate the stability of structural and chemical reconstructions of gnr edges,@xcite together with the transport and band - gap engineering.@xcite the vibrational properties and phonon band structure have been calculated with empirical potentials@xcite and dft.@xcite in addition , there have been theoretical predictions@xcite of the raman spectrum , in good agreement with experiments.@xcite for a finite agnr the role of zigzag termini states have been studied theoretically , comparing dft to the many - body hubbard model.@xcite    inspired by the recent lifting experiments by koch , @xcite we here investigate theoretically the signals of e - ph scattering in the conductance of long gnrs between metal electrodes .",
    "our aim is two - fold .",
    "first , we want to address the role phonon scattering in the transport characteristics of pristine gnrs .",
    "second , we wish to compute detailed iets for different gnrs under varying charge carrier concentrations and explore how different types of realistic defects may modify the iets and thus possibly be directly probed in transport measurements .",
    "we focus on the two most generic edge types , namely armchair ( agnr ) and zigzag ( zgnr ) , and pay attention to the effects of spin polarization in the latter case . in actual experiments the substrate or an applied gate potential control the fermi level @xmath0 in the ribbons . to address this variability we scan @xmath0 using a numerically effective scheme enabling fast calculations of the iets.@xcite we find that the agnr generally display two robust iets signals around @xmath1 and @xmath2 mv corresponding to the d- and g - modes of raman spectroscopy and that a dehydrogenated dimer at the edge should further leave a clear defect signal at around @xmath3 mv . for the zgnr we find that the spin polarization breaks the mirror symmetry around the middle of the ribbon resulting in iets signals from a range of modes around the d- and g - mode energies",
    ". for both agnr and zngr defects which break the planar symmetry of ribbons allows for contributions to the iets from out - of - plane phonon modes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first we discuss our atomistic model setup for the density functional and electron transport calculations , and outline the approach for the iets simulations . in sec .",
    "iii we present our results for pristine agnr and zgnr and relate their transport properties and iets to the band structures . in sec .",
    "iv we turn to the defected systems by considering realistic possibilities of defects in the edge passivation , backbone bonding motifs , and presence of adatoms . finally , a summary and our conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "we calculate the electronic and vibrational structure from dft using the academic codes siesta / transiesta.@xcite we employ the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) for the exchange - correlation functional,@xcite a single - zeta polarized ( szp ) basis set for the carbon and hydrogen atoms , and use a cut - off energy of 400 - 500 ry for the real - space grid . these choices , balancing accuracy and computational cost ,",
    "provide a good description to investigate trends and general behavior of the substantial number of systems considered in this work .",
    "the vibrational degrees of freedom , calculated by diagonalization of the dynamical matrix , and the e - ph couplings are extracted from finite differences as implemented in the inelastica code.@xcite the armchair and zigzag gnrs considered here are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : cleangnr ] .",
    "we adopt the usual two - probe setup with the device region ( @xmath4 ) coupled to left ( @xmath5 ) and right ( @xmath6 ) electrodes with all electronic matrix elements expressed in a local basis set .",
    "the primitive unit cell of the agnr ( zgnr ) consists of 18 ( 10 ) atoms and in our calculations this unit cell is repeated 10 ( 18 ) times in the transport direction to form the scattering regions illustrated in fig .  [",
    "fig : cleangnr](a , e ) .",
    "the electrode couplings @xmath7 are included on the two first / last unit cells before folding onto @xmath4 . in our treatment a subset of atoms in @xmath4 is allowed to vibrate .",
    "we fix this dynamical region , restricted by the condition that the e - ph couplings are fully included inside @xmath4 , to the 4 and 6 central unit - cells for the agnr and zgnr , respectively .",
    "the corresponding e - ph couplings used to calculate the inelastic electron transport are thus expressed in the center 6 unit - cells for the agnr and 8 unit - cells for the zgnr .",
    "the convergence of our results with the size of the dynamical region is addressed below .",
    "we generally consider nanoribbons that are suspended between two metallic leads . in the case of the lifting experiments,@xcite",
    "these would correspond to the metal sample surface and the stm tip .",
    "we wish here to focus on the action inside the gnrs and put aside the possible complications due to the detailed electronic structure of the metals , and the metal - gnr interface in particular . to this end",
    "we introduce a simple model of the metal electrodes without substantial electronic features : we use semi - infinite gnrs with highly broadened states ( effectively smearing out energy gaps ) . in practice",
    "this is done by adding a finite numerical imaginary part @xmath8 to the energy argument in the electrode recursion calculation.@xcite this scheme ensures that the phonon effects originate from the gnrs themselves and not from details of the metal - gnr interface , which is generally unknown in the stm experiments .",
    "the electronic band structures for the infinite ribbons , along with the transmission and density of states ( dos ) are shown for @xmath9  ev in fig .",
    "[ fig : cleangnr](b , c , d ) and fig .  [",
    "fig : cleangnr](f , g , h ) for agnr and zgnr , respectively .",
    "we note that the broadened transmission spectrum [ fig .",
    "[ fig : cleangnr](d ) ] is quite consistent with the experimentally reported differential conductance curves for agnr.@xcite the electronic states involved in the transport are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : channels ] in terms of the transmission eigenchannels@xcite in the valence and conduction bands of the agnr and zgnr .",
    "their spatial symmetry play a significant role for the selection rules involved in the inelastic scattering as discussed later .    in principle , the electronic structure should be evaluated at finite bias .",
    "however , without a detailed model of the connection to the metal electrodes ( where an important part of the voltage drop will take place ) and for sufficiently long systems ( in which the electric field will be small ) , it is reasonable to use the zero - voltage electronic structure and to simply assume a symmetric voltage drop over the two identical , idealized device - electrode interfaces . more specifically , in the following we consider that the chemical potentials of the electrodes move according to the applied bias voltage @xmath10 and possibly an applied gate voltage @xmath11 ( mimicking actual doping or electrostatic gating that modify the charge carrier concentration in an experimental setup ) according to @xmath12 .      for a device strongly coupled to the electrodes , a coupling between the electron current @xmath13 and a phonon mode @xmath14 ideally shows up at zero temperature as a step discontinuity in the differential conductance when",
    "the inelastic phonon emission process becomes energetically allowed , that is , when the chemical potential difference exceeds the quantum of vibrational energy , @xmath15 .",
    "thus , around the emission threshold the electronic states involved in the scattering process are those at @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the iets signal , conventionally expressed as the ratio between the second and first derivatives of the current with respect to the voltage , @xmath18 is calculated by considering the e - ph coupling as the perturbation on the current , evaluated using the nonequilibrium green s functions ( negf ) . in the so - called lowest order expansion ( loe )",
    "the inelastic part of the differential conductance can be written as,@xcite @xmath19 where summation over the vibration index @xmath14 is assumed .",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath21 are the `` universal '' ( system - independent ) functions that depend on the applied bias @xmath10 , phonon energy @xmath22 and the temperature @xmath23 . assuming the electronic and phononic distribution functions are given by the fermi - dirac and bose - einstein distributions , respectively , their analytical expressions can be written as : @xmath24,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the conductance quantum",

    "the purely electronic quantities are thus being evaluated at the chemical potentials of the left / right electrodes corresponding to the excitation threshold for each vibration .",
    "we compute @xmath34 with the finite - difference scheme of inelastica taking the vacuum energy as a common reference ( in absence of real metal leads to pin the fermi energy).@xcite    in the localized atomic basis set of siesta all the above quantities are matrices defined in the electronic space corresponding to region @xmath4 .",
    "the second derivatives of the universal functions in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sym])-([eq : asym ] ) are sharply peaked around the phonon threshold .",
    "for this reason the coefficients @xmath38 and @xmath30 can be considered voltage - independent with their values computed exactly at the threshold . due to the computational efficiency of the loe scheme described above",
    "we are able to evaluate the iets on a fine grid of gate voltages @xmath11 spanning a large range of relevant values between valence and conduction bands of the gnrs .",
    "now we first turn to the iets results of the two pristine ( clean ) ribbons , and in the following section to the impact of selected defects in the iets . as our main system",
    "we focus on the agnr systems directly relevant for the lifting experiments.@xcite the results for the zgnr are provided mainly as comparison and to look into the role of chirality and in particular effects rooted in spin polarization , and thus we now discuss these separately .      as representative of the agnr class we have investigated a pristine agnr with a width of @xmath39 dimers ( 7-agnr ) corresponding to a c - c edge distance of 7.5  ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cleangnr ] ) .",
    "it presents a direct semi - conducting band gap @xmath40 due to the lateral confinement and can be classified as a `` large - gap ribbons '' since @xmath41 is an integer in the relation @xmath42.@xcite we obtain @xmath43  ev at the present level of approximation ( dft - gga and szp basis set ) , as seen from the electronic band structure shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cleangnr](b ) .",
    "this value is smaller than those estimated experimentally ( @xmath44 2.3 - 2.6  ev for a flat agnr on au(111 ) @xcite and @xmath45 ev for an agnr suspended between surface and stm - tip@xcite ) due to the underestimation of electron - electron interaction@xcite which plays an more important role in quasi one - dimensional gnrs compared to pristine graphene .",
    "dielectric screening from the substrate also influences significantly the actual gap size : a band gap of @xmath46  ev for a 7-agnr was found to be lowered to @xmath47  ev on a hexagonal boron - nitride ( hbn ) substrate using gw calculations,@xcite similar to the lowering calculated for a 7-agnr on au(111).@xcite in general we expect that underestimation of band gaps would mainly amount to a simple scaling the fermi level position within the gap .",
    "we first discuss the effect of the finite size of the dynamical region in our treatment .",
    "figure [ fig : convclean](a ) shows how the iets signals for the agnr ( at fixed gate voltage @xmath48 v ) vary as a function of the size of the dynamical region , ranging from 1 to 6 unit cells . for easy comparison ,",
    "the data are normalized by the number of vibrating unit cells .",
    "as the signal amplitudes in this representation are roughly constant we conclude that the absolute iets simply scale linearly with the active e - ph coupling region .",
    "consequently , the magnitudes in iets may thus provide insight into the active scattering region in actual experiments .",
    "further , as we find that both iets amplitude and shape is well converged with 4 vibrating unit cells , we fix the dynamical region to this size in the following analysis .    the computed iets signals for the agnr as a function of varying gate voltage are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ietsclean](a ) as a density plot . specific iets spectra at selected gate voltages are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ietsclean](c ) for both the intrinsic part ( temperature broadening at @xmath49  k ) as well as that one would observe employing the experimental lock - in technique ( additional broadening due to a modulation voltage of @xmath50  mv ) .",
    "we find that for the agnr there are generally two well - defined iets signals appearing around @xmath1 and @xmath2 mev , corresponding to the d- ( ring breathing ) and g- ( e@xmath51 phonon ) modes , respectively , also observed in raman spectroscopy.@xcite .",
    "the d - signal also has a shoulder with a local maximum at @xmath52 mev with contributions from several modes .",
    "these three distinct features are indicated with vertical lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : ietsclean](a , c ) . shifting @xmath0 inside the gap region with a relatively small gate voltage @xmath53",
    "v does not affect the iets appreciably .",
    "however , when @xmath0 comes close to the conduction band of the agnr the signal increases by a factor of five and a small peak - dip feature appear similar to the one reported for gated benzene - dithiol molecular contacts.@xcite upon further gating into the conduction band the iets signals undergo a sign reversal ( from peaks to dips ) as the transmission increases beyond approximately @xmath54 for the involved channels.@xcite similar effects are also found by gating into the valence band of the agnr .",
    "we can easily identify the most important vibrational mode vectors @xmath55 for the iets from the two amplitudes @xmath56 and @xmath57 given in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : gamma])-([eq : kappa ] ) .",
    "these modes can further be analyzed in terms of the phonons in the infinite agnr .",
    "to do so we introduce the measure @xmath58 representing the overlap between modes in the finite dynamical cell and the phonon band modes weighted by the size of the iets signal , @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the phonon band mode indexed by @xmath61 , and @xmath62 is the modes in a finite @xmath63 primitive cell long dynamical region index by @xmath14 .",

    "the corresponding @xmath68-point phonon modes inside the primitive cell for the infinite ribbon are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : agnrphononband](b - e ) .",
    "we next turn to our results for the pristine zgnr shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cleangnr](e ) .",
    "it has a width of @xmath69 zigzag `` chains '' ( 4-zgnr ) corresponding to a c - c edge distance of 7.26   . the breaking of sublattice symmetry for the zgnr and lack of pseudo - phase result in different selection rules for the matrix elements and difference in for example raman signals.@xcite the zgnr generally presents spin - polarized edge states exhibiting a small band gap at the dft level,@xcite in our case @xmath70 ev ( we note that this gap disappears in simpler tight - binding descriptions@xcite or spin - degenerate dft calculations ) .",
    "the spin - polarized edge states play the major role for the conduction , see the spin - down eigenchannels visualized in fig .",
    "[ fig : channels](e - h ) .",
    "since the edge states break the mirror symmetry with respect to the middle of the ribbon , there are fewer symmetry - forbidden inelastic transitions between the scattering states for the zgnr .",
    "thus , we expect a wider range of modes to contribute to the iets signal as compared to the agnr case .",
    "indeed this is in agreement with the findings shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : convclean](b ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : ietsclean](b , d ) . the greater number of modes contributing to the iets for the zgnr results in broader signals with similar magnitudes as compared to the iets for agnr . as for the agnr case",
    "the iets signal is well converged with a dynamical region consisting of 6 vibrating unit cells [ fig .",
    "[ fig : convclean](b ) ] .    for zgnrs",
    "the ring breathing is forbidden by symmetry , thus the iets is generally characterized by transverse and longitudinal modes . to explore the impact of spin - polarization on the zgnr - iets we compare in fig .",
    "[ fig : nospin ] the results from both spin - degenerate and spin - polarized calculations . without gate voltage ( @xmath71 v ) the iets display opposite signs due to the spin - induced gap .",
    "only a single peak contributes to the spin - degenerate iets while several peaks contribute to the spin - polarized iets .",
    "even if the zgnr is tuned by @xmath72v to become metallic and the two treatments then show the same overall sign in iets , the spin - polarized iets persists to show a much richer structure .",
    "this difference suggests that iets could be a way to indirectly observe spin - polarized edge states .",
    "projecting the modes contributing to the iets onto the phonon band modes further underlines how several bands with different symmetries contribute to the spin - polarized iets , while only a couple of bands contributes to the spin - degenerate iets , see fig .",
    "[ fig : bandzgnr ] .",
    "again we use eq .",
    "( [ eq.weightf ] ) for this characterization , where the overlap for @xmath48 v corresponds to the red color and the overlap for @xmath72 v corresponds to the difference between the blue and red color in fig .",
    "[ fig : bandzgnr ] , respectively .",
    "it is clear that spin - polarization permits more modes to contribute to the iets .",
    "in contrast to the spin - degenerate case , where the symmetric electronic states ( with respect to the middle of the ribbon ) only can couple to the symmetric vibration modes , the symmetry lowering of the electronic states by spin - polarization opens up also for scattering also via odd modes .",
    "in this section we address the modification and new signals in iets that arise due to various defects in the gnr .",
    "regardless of the fabrication method , defects will inevitable occur .",
    "for example , if the agnrs are synthesized from a precursor molecule , involving heating and dehydrogenation , as reported by cai @xcite and blankenburg , @xcite there is a chance that the reaction is incomplete and some of the c - c bonds between the precursor molecules do not form .",
    "also there is a chance that a part of the final agnr will have dehydrogenated edges or are passivated by two hydrogen atoms .",

    "[ fig : xyzagnr ] we show the structures of pristine agnr along with 8 different defect configurations which we have considered .",
    "these include four defects in the edge passivation as follows : a single edge side with an extra hydrogen atom [ ` 1h - edge ` , fig .",
    "[ fig : xyzagnr](b ) ] , two edge sides with each an extra hydrogen atom [ ` 2h - edge ` , fig .",

    "[ fig : xyzagnr](e ) ] .",

    "for all these systems the entire dynamical region was relaxed , i.e. , the parts of the agnrs shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xyzagnr ] .",
    "defects may influence the iets signal in two ways .",
    "first , a defect can have a direct impact by changing the vibrational degrees of freedom . in order for the change in the vibrational spectrum to give a signal in the iets",
    ", the new vibrations must couple to the current , and preferably have frequencies which do not coincide with ones already giving iets signals for the pristine ribbons .",
    "second , a defect can substantially change the electronic structure and thereby have an impact on the e - ph couplings associated with the active modes or even the transmission eigenchannels of the pristine ribbons , e.g. , changing a peak in the iets to a dip ( and vice versa ) or enhancing asymmetric contributions via eq .",
    "( [ eq : asym ] ) .",
    "the electronic properties of the pristine agnr is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : transagnr](a ) .",
    "the carbon dos projected to the device region ( red curve ) reveals a gap as expected from the band structure [ fig .  [",
    "fig : cleangnr](b ) ] , which is significantly broadened from the coupling to the metallic electrodes .",
    "the two valence and two conduction bands in the considered energy range naturally explain that the total transmission ( black curve ) is bound below a value of 2 .",
    "further , the ratio @xmath75 ( green dashed line ) , measuring the minimum number of contributing channels where @xmath74 is the transmission of the most transmitting eigenchannel , shows that both channels play a role for the transport , at least away from the edges of the direct band gap .",
    "measurements of shot noise may provide insights into this effective number of conductance eigenchannels.@xcite we can now discuss how the different defects modify the electronic properties . from fig .",
    "[ fig : transagnr](b)-(i ) we notice that not all defects change the elastic transmission , and furthermore , a change in elastic transmission needs not be unique for a specific defect .",

    "figure [ fig : ietsdefectagnr ] shows the computed iets as a function of gate voltage for the 8 different defects . as for the clean structure , the two peaks at @xmath1 and @xmath2 mev corresponding to the d- and g- raman modes are dominant for a range of gate values for all the structures .",
    "another feature , which is present in all the systems , is the appearance of several signals close to the band onsets . in the following subsections",
    "we discuss in more detail the transport characteristics with the different types of defects in agnrs .",
    "considering defects in the edge passivation [ fig .",
    "[ fig : xyzagnr](b - e ) ] the gap in the transmission is essentially unchanged [ fig .",
    "[ fig : transagnr](b - e ) ] , except for the ` 1h - edge ` structure where a zero - energy resonance appears in the dos and transmission [ fig .",
    "[ fig : transagnr](b ) ] .",

    "[ fig : transdefectzgnr](k ) ] the edge states start to extend into the middle of the ribbon , partially restoring mirror symmetry , and thus resulting in part of the pristine zgnr signals to disappear",

    "[ fig : ietsdefectzgnr](k ) . as for the agnr substituting a hydrogen with a fluorine atom has a very limited effect on the electronic properties and the iets signal .    substituting a hydrogen with an oh group , according to fig .",
    "[ fig : transdefectzgnr](f ) and ( o ) , have only a small effect on the spin down electrons , while it shrinks and add additional structure to the gap for the spin up electrons . for the spin up electrons",
    "there is a small peak inside the gap which gives rise to a large asymmetric iets signal around @xmath89v in fig .",
    "[ fig : transdefectzgnr](o ) lower curve , compared to the pristine case .",
    "the most contributing mode to the asymmetric iets signal is shown in fig .  [ fig : zigmodes](b ) .",
    "however , there is no clear signature of the oh group itself . in the same manner",
    "the substitution with a @xmath84 group removes the gap in the electronic properties without leaving any direct fingerprint of the @xmath84 group in the iets signal .      as for the agnr we consider the effect of adatoms . for the cu adatom the transport gap shrinks for the spin up electrons while there is an in - gap peak for the spin down electrons , cf .",
    "[ fig : transdefectzgnr](m ) .",
    "thus , for some gate values the iets signals reflect that the spin down electrons will back scatter while the spin up electrons will be forward scattered , and the observed signal is then the sum of these contributions . for a gate value of @xmath89 v , the iets signal is dominated by spin down electrons . due to the finite width of the in - gap peak , in the spin down transmission , the low frequency phonons ( @xmath90  mev ) give rise to back scattering while the high frequency phonons ( @xmath91  mev ) result in forward scattering .",
    "thus , the low and high energy signals have different signs as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : ietsdefectzgnr](l ) .",
    "interestingly , the low energy signal primarily consists of symmetric contributions from out - of - plane modes [ fig .",

    "[ fig : transdefectzgnr](e , n ) , reveals a spin dependent n - type doping effect , where @xmath0 is shifted the most for spin down .",
    "however , no in - gap peak is seen as for cu and the iets show no clear signature of the li atom .      the formation of a ` r57 ` reconstruction results in peaks in the dos in the device region , just above @xmath0 for spin up [ fig .",
    "[ fig : transdefectzgnr](h ) ] and just below @xmath0 for spin down [ fig .",
    "[ fig : transdefectzgnr](q ) ] .",
    "the ` r57 ` breaks the symmetry both in the vibrational and electronic structure allowing for iets signals from a wider range of vibrations , resulting in broader peaks , as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : ietsdefectzgnr](h ) and fig .  [ fig : ietsdefectzgnr](n ) .",
    "one of the contributing modes is localized at the border between the pentagon - ring and middle of the ribbon at @xmath92 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : zigmodes](d ) ] .",
    "this localized mode yield a relatively small signal compared to the other signals , however , contrary to the other modes the localized mode is not expected to be broadened if the coupling to phonons away from the dynamical region is taken into account .",
    "the breaking of symmetry in the electronic structure also give rise to difference signals for the two bias polarities .      substituting a carbon with a silicon atom leads to an out - of - plane buckling ,",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : structdefectzgnr](i ) . however , both silicon and carbon have an @xmath93 electronic structure , and the electron transmission is basically similar to the pristine .",
    "on the other hand , the buckling give rise to low energy peaks in the iets signal originating from the e - ph coupling to the out - of - plane modes [ fig .",
    "[ fig : zigmodes](e ) ] .",
    "gating close to the band edge of the conduction band gives rise to different sign of the signals at low and high vibrational energies , as seen from the top curve in fig .",

    "in summary , we have investigated iets signals in symmetrically contacted armchair and zigzag graphene nanoribbons , considering both pristine as well as a selection of defected configurations under varying charge carrier conditions . for the clean agnr",
    "inelastic tunneling gives rise to two distinct peaks in the iets spectrum at @xmath1 mv and @xmath2 mv corresponding to the d - and g - modes of raman spectroscopy , respectively . by connecting the iets signals to the phonon band structure ,",
    "we have clarified how only a single band contributes to the `` g - mode '' while three bands contribute to the broader `` d - mode '' . concerning defects in agnrs",
    "we have shown how some leave iets unchanged while others give clear signals .",
    "for instance , adding an extra hydrogen atom to a single edge side gives a clear signal for some gate values .",
    "this signal can be removed by adding another hydrogen atom to the neighboring edge side because the sub - lattice symmetry is restored .",
    "further , exchanging a single hydrogen atom with a fluorine atom in the passivation does not result in any change in both the elastic and inelastic tunneling .",
    "however removing 8 hydrogen atoms leaving part of the edge on each side without passivation , gives a clear robust signal throughout the investigated gate values .",
    "the signal , due to the vibration of the carbon dimers at the edge , has an energy around @xmath3 mev making it easy to detect since it is outside the vibrational spectrum of the pristine ribbon .",
    "breaking of one or two c - c bonds turns out to interchange the relative intensity of the `` g''- and `` d''-peaks . breaking 4 c - c bonds gives rise to signals caused by the defect tilted out of plane .",
    "lifting the symmetry of the @xmath80-electrons by adding a cu - adatom allows the out - of - plane modes to contribute .    for the zgnr",
    "we find relatively broader iets signals especially in the absense of a large gate voltage ( @xmath94 v ) .",
    "importantly , this is a consequence of the breaking of the axial mirror symmetry in the ribbon due to the presence of spin - polarized edges .",
    "thus , by comparing to spin - degenerate calculations , we suggest that iets can give an indirect proof of spin - polarization in zigzag ribbons . on the other hand ,",
    "the broader iets features may make it difficult to identify the different defect signals reported in this paper .",
    "the presence of a ` r57`-reconstruction also broadens the iets by breaking both the electronic and vibrational symmetry .",
    "substituting a carbon atom with a silicon atom makes the ribbon buckle , breaking the planar symmetry , allowing the out - of - plane modes to contribute to the iets .",
    "this suggests that iets in principle could be used to gain information of the curvature of gnrs and other graphene - based structures .    finally , as an outlook",
    "we note that here we presented calculations on long , symmetrically contacted systems where there is a significant overlap with both metallic electrodes",
