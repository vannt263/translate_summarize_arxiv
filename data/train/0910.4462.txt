    "0.6 cm    .all considered mechanisms for step a , which are defined by the two parameters * mgenxi * and * ixiccstate*. here the symbol gg - mechanism stands for the gluon - gluon fusion mechanism and etc .. [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ xi ]    in fact , in the program we divide the production of a double heavy baryon @xmath0 or @xmath1 or @xmath2 into two steps : step - a is up - to the production of a relevant double heavy diquark and step - b is followed for the fragmentation of the double heavy diquark into the desired baryon",
    ". therefore , in step - a , there are three possible mechanisms : the gluon - gluon fusion mechanism ( @xmath7 ) , gluon - charm collision mechanism ( @xmath8 ) and charm - charm collision mechanism ( @xmath9 ) , so in the program we need to fix one of them to produce the diquarks @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 accordingly in term .",
    "all the three mechanisms and the calculation techniques for them are described in refs.@xcite . in step - b , it is for the fragmentation of the double heavy diquark into the desired baryon . in the step",
    "we assume the intermediate diquark is to ` decay ' into the baryon plus soft parton(s ) exclusively , e.g. , either @xmath13_{\\bar{3}}\\to \\xi_{qq'}+\\bar{q}$ ] or @xmath14_{\\bar{6}}\\to \\xi_{qq'}+\\bar{q}+g$ ] ( here @xmath15 denote @xmath16-quark , @xmath17 an light anti - quark , @xmath18 a gluon ) .",
    "for convenience , in the program we name the mechanisms and intermediate diquarks in terms of the parameters as those in tab.[xi ] , where * mgenxi * stands for the double - heavy diquarks , @xmath10 or @xmath11 or @xmath12 , and * ixiccstate * stands for the mechanisms .",
    "note that in the previous version of genxicc ( we call it genxicc1.0 ) , we did not program how the diquark forms the relevant baryon , but alternatively we simply assumed that the relevant baryon is formed with 100% efficiency .",
    "according to qcd confinement , the produced diquarks @xmath19 , i.e. @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , must be fragmented into relevant baryons by grabbing a light quark @xmath20 ( even suitable number of gluons @xmath18 ) with definite probability .",
    "since the fragmentation for the heavy diquarks is absent from the available version of pythia , thus in the upgraded version of genxicc we program the fragmentation precisely and make its interphase still to suit pythia properly . for consistency , in the upgraded version for the fragmentation we adopt the assumptions and method similar to those taken by pythia @xcite in the case for the fragmentation of a color - octet component @xmath21 into a colorless charmonium .",
    "namely here the double heavy quark to grab a light quark ( with gluons if necessary ) from the ` environment ' to form a colorless double heavy baryon with a relative possibility for various flavors of the light quark as @xmath22 .",
    "hence in the program we introduce three new parameters * ratiou * ( default=1 ) , * ratiod*(default=1 ) , * ratios*(default=0.3 ) so as to dictate the probability for a double heavy diquark to grab a light quark ( antiquark ) in forming the relevant baryon finally .",
    "these parameters may be changed by setting the values of the parameters in the parameter.f , when the relative possibilities for various flavors are assumed precisely .",
    "one more parameter * nbound * is naturally introduced to dictate which type of baryon : @xmath23 or @xmath24 ( * nbound*=1 ) , @xmath25 or @xmath26 ( * nbound*=2 ) , @xmath27 or @xmath28 ( * nbound*=3 ) is to be generated from the relevant produced diquark .",
    "( * nbound*=4 ) is to derive the diquark results that can be generated by previous version ( genxicc1.0 ) .",
    "the relative possibilities for the baryons @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath24 are decided by the value of * ratiou * , * ratiod * and * ratios*. more precisely , if the diquark @xmath4_{\\bar{3}}$ ] is produced , then it will fragment into @xmath30 with @xmath31 probability , @xmath29 with @xmath31 probability and @xmath24 with @xmath32 probability accordingly , when default values of * ratiou * , * ratiod * and * ratios * are taken .",
    "below we shall only take the hadronic production of @xmath0 as an example to show how the generator genxicc works , because the production for the baryon @xmath1 or @xmath2 is similar .    at the end of the step - a , the final particles momenta are set by using the * phase@xmath33gen * routine , that is based on rambo ( random momentum booster ) program @xcite , and the irrelevant phase space is integrated by vegas @xcite .",
    "for the step - b , we adopt the ` decay ' method ( as that to deal with the intermediate color octet @xmath34 states to produce @xmath35 in pythia @xcite ) .",
    "according to the method , we start with assuming the diquark mass to be slightly bigger than that of the baryon ( @xmath36 ) , so the diquark may ` decay ' into a relevant baryon by emitting very soft partons ( anti - quark and/or gluons ) , and the soft partons take away very tiny momentum from the diquark . to keep gauge invariance of the hard process in step - a , we must set @xmath10-diquark mass to be @xmath37 exactly @xcite , thus in the present case , we set the diquark mass to be @xmath38 i.e. slightly bigger value , e.g. @xmath39 ( @xmath40 is mass of the light quark ) , and let the mass of the produced baryon be less than but very close to @xmath41 approximately . in the program , we introduce the parameters * slqmass * to stand for the soft - light - quark mass @xmath40(q = u , d , s ) : * qmassu * for @xmath42-quark , * qmassd * for @xmath43-quark and * qmasss * for @xmath44-quark respectively . since the step - b in the case for the diquark @xmath4_{\\bar{3}}$ ] being produced is of a ( @xmath45)-body process ( @xmath4_{\\bar{3}}\\to \\xi_{cc}+\\bar{q}$ ] ) and we have averaged the polarization of the produced diquark @xmath4_{\\bar{3}}$ ] in step - a , so we reasonably treat the fragmentation as that , for the double heavy baryon and the light anti - quark , the absolute values of the momenta is fixed by momentum conservation and the masses of the three relevant particles , whereas the direction of the momenta is isotropic in the diquark rest frame .",
    "it can be found that such a light anti - quark indeed affects very slightly in the momentum distribution of the generated double heavy baryon .",
    "we should note here that even though such a soft light quark gives slightly correction to the distribution in momentum , it must be involved so as to make the color flow of the process right for each event in full .",
    "if the color flow of the process were not correct , then the program would not be able to implement in pythia to generate full events .",
    "as for the step - b in the case for the diquark @xmath5_{6}$ ] being produced , that is of a ( @xmath46)-body process ( @xmath5_{6}\\to \\xi_{cc}+\\bar{q}+g$ ] , one more gluon is needed ) indeed due to the color - flow request as pointed out in the next section , we still treat it as a ( @xmath45)-body process for momentum distribution of the fragmentation by letting @xmath17 and @xmath18 always move together . ``",
    "letting @xmath17 and @xmath18 always move together '' is a very strong constraint but here @xmath17 and @xmath18 are very ` light ' and carry the momenta very tiny , so it does not affect the distribution of the baryon , what we are interested in , substantially .    to record all the useful data ,",
    "we improve the data manipulation method .",
    "all the recorded data are still put in the directory _ data _ , while in this directory , we introduce 12 subdirectories ; _ xiccu _ , _ xiccd _ , _ xiccs _ , _ xibcu _ , _ xibcd _ , _ xibcs _ , _ xibbu _ , _ xibbd _ , _ xibbs _ , _ ccdiq _ , _ bcdiq _ and _ bbdiq_. these subdirectories record the needed data respective to the settings determined by the user in * parameter.f * , e.g. _ xiccu _ , _ xiccd _ and _ xiccs _ record data for @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 respectively ; _ ccdiq _ , _ bcdiq _ and _ bbdiq _ record data for @xmath10-diquark , @xmath11-diquark , @xmath12-diquark respectively .",
    "we should note that the subdirectories _ ccdiq _ , _ bcdiq _ and _ bbdiq _ record the data just as those generated by genxicc1.0 .",
    "ignoring the color flow of the fragmentation at all , still one can obtain incomplete information of the event for the baryon production , such as the observables : total cross section , transverse momentum @xmath50 and rapidity @xmath51 differential distributions of the baryon etc .",
    "thus , even genxicc1.0 , the previous version , can do all these jobs well . the present ( upgraded ) version deals with the color flow not only for the double heavy diquark production but also for the fragmentation carefully , so by complementing the upgraded version of the generator into pythia properly , it can generate full events and record all information of the outgoing partons , besides that of the baryon itself .",
    "the color flow for @xmath0 and @xmath2 production is much more involved than that of @xmath1 production , so at the present , firstly we focus the color flow for @xmath0 production precisely . moreover to meet the needs in most cases , we only include the most important gluon - gluon fusion mechanism for the @xmath1 and @xmath2 production",
    ". the interesting readers can obtain the color flow for the @xmath1 and @xmath2 production by following the same method , but we note that for @xmath1 production since the heavy quarks inside it are different flavored so its production via the diquark @xmath11 with the quantum number as @xmath52_{\\bar{3}}$ ] or @xmath53_{\\bar{3}}$ ] or @xmath52_6 $ ] or @xmath53_6 $ ] ( four possibilities ) instead of @xmath54_{\\bar{3}}$ ] or @xmath55_6 $ ] ( @xmath56 , two possibilities ) for @xmath57 production .",
    "to show the color flow of @xmath0 production , the mechanisms for @xmath4_{\\bar{3}}$ ] production and the followed fragmentation can be more precisely written as @xmath58_{\\bar{3}}+\\bar{c}\\bar{c } \\to \\big(\\xi^+_{cc } + \\bar{d}\\big ) + \\bar{c}\\bar{c } \\;\\;{\\it or}\\;\\ ; \\big(\\xi^{++}_{cc } + \\bar{u}\\big ) + \\bar{c}\\bar{c } \\;\\;{\\it or}\\;\\ ; \\big(\\omega^{+}_{cc } + \\bar{s}\\big ) + \\bar{c}\\bar{c}\\\\ & & gc\\to ( cc)[^3s_1]_{\\bar{3}}+\\bar{c } \\to \\big(\\xi^{+}_{cc}+\\bar{d}\\big ) + \\bar{c } \\;\\;{\\it or}\\;\\ ; \\big(\\xi^{++}_{cc } + \\bar{u } ) + \\bar{c}\\;\\;{\\it or}\\;\\ ; \\big(\\omega^{+}_{cc } + \\bar{s } ) + \\bar{c } \\\\ & & cc\\to ( cc)[^3s_1]_{\\bar{3}}+g \\to \\big(\\xi^{+}_{cc}+\\bar{d}\\big ) + g \\;\\;{\\it or}\\;\\ ; \\big(\\xi^{++}_{cc } + \\bar{u}\\big ) + g\\;\\;{\\it or}\\;\\ ; \\big(\\omega^{+}_{cc } + \\bar{s}\\big ) + g\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] according to the discussion in ref.@xcite , for the @xmath10-diquark in @xmath59 state with the color @xmath60 , one of the two heavy @xmath61 quarks emits a soft gluon and then this gluon splits into a light @xmath62 pair , and the @xmath10-pair can combine the light quark @xmath20 to form the baryon @xmath0 ( in @xmath63 fock state ) . to fit the needs of pythia running , here we program the second step properly , i.e. to deal with the color flow of the fragmentation process carefully .    _ { \\bar{3}}$ ] .",

    "in the above two subsection , based on the color - flow decomposition method of ref.@xcite we have designed a strict way to deal with the color flows for the baryon production .",
    "in fact since a baryon contains three valance quarks in different colors so as to form a colorless object , thus under the color - flow decomposition method , there must be three color flow lines being ended at a baryon .",
    "namely it is different from the case of meson , where the color flow lines of the quark and anti - quark inside a meson are continued . to simplify the present situation , reminding the fact that @xmath107 in general qcd su(3 ) color space : 1 ) firstly",
    ", we can combine any two of the flow lines ended with two quarks into one anti - flow line ended with one anti - quark with a color @xmath108 ( the direction of the line is turned back completely ) that is different from the two quarks ( the third kind of color in respect those kinds of the two quarks ) ; 2 ) secondly , such anti - flow line obtained by the combination may be continued ( connected ) to the third color - flow line in the baryon ; 3 ) finally , as a consequence , the color - flow lines ended at a baryon become ` joined without ends ' at all , which is the requirement of the color - singlet bound state .    with the method for",
    "the color - flow lines ended at baryon , practically , the present version of pythia ( version 6.4 ) can generate full events with two or less independent color - flow lines in most cases well even a baryon being involved .",
    "when there are three or more independent color - flow lines in process , pythia will stop at the step of running the ` final parton showers ' or parton cascade radiations etc , and will present an error message to show that the color flow rearrangement is wrong during the parton s evolution process . for the present problem to generate the full events for the baryon production",
    ", it is found that in genxicc all the mentioned production mechanisms : gluon - gluon fusion , gluon - charm collision and charm - charm collision , have exactly three independent color flows as shown by the last subsections when the color flow lines ended at the produced baryon are not treated as the above ( to combine two of the three lines into one anti - color flow line ) .",
    "so with genxicc1.0 being directly complemented , pythia can not work well with these mechanisms at the step of ` final parton showers ' or parton cascade radiations etc . to overcome the difficulty and to achieve full useful information for each event of the baryon production , the best approach perhaps is that pythia itself is improved to deal with three or more color - flow lines processes etc , e.g. to add the useful intermediate diquark states with color @xmath109 or color @xmath99 , such as @xmath4_{\\bar{3}}$ ] , @xmath5_{6}$ ] etc , into the particle tabular of pythia , and properly to treat the color - flow lines ended at the baryon in fragmenting them into baryons accordingly .",
    "we suspect that it can be realized as done in a similar way as that in pythia @xcite to treat color - octet mechanisms for the @xmath110 production without difficulty .",
    "since genxicc1.0 , the previous version of the generator , without precisely strict color - flow lines being defined , can not run well for the available versions of pythia , and furthermore , now there is no the improved pythia as mentioned above , thus in genxicc2.0 the upgraded version of the generator , we have to suggest another way so as to complete the full - event generation under a controlled approximate level ( not to deviate from true too much ) with the color flow lines ended at a baryon .",
    "namely , we properly vary the color flows of the process as depicted in the last subsections , so as to make pythia running well for final parton shower process . aiming at the purpose , we precisely restrict the state constructed by either @xmath111 or @xmath112 is equal to the desired colorless baryon , then i ) to keep color conservation , all the outgoing particles colors are arranged properly such that they form a color state as that of the incoming particles ; ii ) the details in color of the constitute partons are ignored .",
    "pythia is cheated to believe that the state constructed by either @xmath111 or @xmath112 is colorless baryon , so we force it ` steady ' without any evolution , thus any programs , which are called from pythia , may run smoothly . in this way and only to introduce necessary soft enough light quark(s ) anti - quark(s ) and gluon(s ) , the momentum distribution and the other factors for the production will not be affected much .",
    "moreover , we further simplify the program for the production in color as follows : 1 ) ignoring the details about the color flow when the diquark fragments into a colorless baryon , the initial color - flow lines are reduced to be less than or equal to two . more explicitly , for instance the three color - flow lines in eqs.([ga],[gb],[gc ] ) for the gluon - gluon fusion mechanism ( @xmath4_{\\bar{3}}$ ] ) lead to two independent color - flow lines : @xmath113\\to[502,503]\\to[501,502 ] \\to[501,0]\\to { \\bf colorless\\ ; bound\\ ; state}$ ] and @xmath114\\to [ 504,0]\\to { \\bf colorless\\ ; bound\\ ; state}\\to [ 0,504]$ ] ; 2 ) a working assumption in program is made by setting the outgoing light anti - quark s color to be the same as that of the outgoing @xmath115 or @xmath116 ( see fig.[case3s1 ] ) in the case of gluon - gluon fusion or gluon - charm collision mechanism respectively ; 3 ) in the production , to ` introduce ' a soft anti - quarks and a soft gluon for the diquark @xmath5_{6}$ ] is only to keep the color conservation , so we may formally combine these two soft objects as an effective soft ` parton ' . therefore ,",
    "as for the color freedom - degree only , for the @xmath5_{6}$ ] we force the outgoing soft gluon and soft anti - quark to be combined into an effective one color - sixtet object ( parton ) formally , so the color flow for both @xmath4_{\\bar{3}}$ ] and @xmath5_{6}$ ] is treated in the same manner in the program .",
    "namely in color , the effective soft ` parton ' is @xmath17 for @xmath4_{\\bar{3}}$ ] and is @xmath117 for @xmath5_{6}$ ] accordingly .",
    "moreover , in genxicc2.0 , we provide an interface of these soft objects to pythia and users , who are interested in this part , can conveniently use these code to do the event evolution .",
    "we should note here that this simplification in treating the color flows can not be applied to the charm - charm collision mechanism , i.e. , we can not simultaneously simplify the three independent color - flow lines into two and also keep the process in color conservation .",
    "however , the contribution from this mechanism is small in comparison with the other two mechanisms at higher energy colliders as tevatron and lhc@xcite fortunately , so in the generator we safely ignore the charm - charm collision mechanism at all .",
    "to generate full events for the production of the double heavy baryons with genxicc complemented into pythia , as pointed out above , obviously the best way is to improve pithia with proper treatment the color - flow lines ended at the baryon .",
    "whereas due to the fact that the improved version of pythia is not available now , thus we ` have to suggest ' another way with certain approximation , i.e. when writing down the program , the upgraded version has additionally made certain simplification with ` cheat ' so as to generate the full events by applying genxicc2.0 , the upgraded generator , being complemented in pythia , quite efficiently .",
    "however we should point out here that due to approximation and simplification with ` cheat ' explained in the above subsection , the obtained information about the tiny jets , corresponding to the soft anti - quark and soft gluon(s ) produced in fragmentation of double heavy diquark , may not be very reliable , although the information about hard jets and the baryon as well in the full events is reliable .    *",
