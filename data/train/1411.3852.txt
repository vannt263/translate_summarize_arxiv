    "in the present paper , we have studied the bounce universe in the framework of scalar gauss - bonnet gravity .",
    "the existence of the gauss - bonnet invariant as a higher derivative quantum correction is strongly supported by string theories .",
    "particularly , when the scale factor has the hyperbolic form or exponential form leading to cosmology with a bounce , we have explicitly reconstructed the potential form and gauss - bonnet coupling function of a dynamical scalar field .",
    "in addition , we have explored the bounce behaviours in both the string and einstein frames in detail by performing the conformal transformation and derived the relation of the bounce cosmology between these conformal frames . through the conformal transformation",
    ", it has been seen that the difference of potential form of the scalar field between the two frames is the exponential function of the scalar field , whereas the coupling function of the scalar field to the gauss - bonnet invariant are the same in the two frames .    as a consequence",
    ", we have found the following three points .",
    "( i ) in the case that the point of the cosmological bounce in the string frame is transformed into that in the einstein frame , it does not retain its character .",
    "when the conformal transformation from the string frame to the einstein frame is made , the bounce point in the string frame changes its qualitative natures and ceases to be bounce point in the einstein frame .",
    "however , new bounce point(s ) appears in the einstein frame .",
    "( ii ) if the second derivative of the scale factor takes an extreme value in the string frame , the second derivative of the scale factor in the einstein frame has an extreme value at the point corresponding to the one of the cosmological bounce in the string frame .",
    "especially , there are cosmological models in which at this point , the universe expands with its minimal acceleration , namely , the second derivative of the scale factor becomes its minimum value .",
    "however , in principle , the parameters of the theory may be chosen so that the second derivative of the scale factor at this point can take its maximum value .",
    "( iii ) third , in the einstein frame , at the point of the cosmological bounce @xmath254 , the gap interaction function @xmath22 is missed unlike in the string frame .    in inflation paradigm , the spatially flat , homogeneous , and isotropic universe , which are suggested by quite precise cosmological observations , can be realized successfully .",
    "the primordial density perturbations with its spectrum consistent with the observations can also be generated during inflation .",
    "it is significant to discuss other possible scenarios for the early universe to explain the observations so that physics in the early universe can further be proved . as an attempt for this issue",
    ", the idea of the bounce universe has been examined .",
    "for instance , also in the matter bounce scenario and the ekpyrotic cosmology , the primordial density perturbations with its almost scale - invariant spectrum can be generated .",
    "another additional merit of these scenarios is that they are motivated by fundamental theories including superstring / m - theories , which are hopeful candidates to describe the quantum aspects of gravity .",
    "finally , we remark that according to the investigations in @xmath0 gravity , when the cosmological bounce happens in the einstein frame , the cosmic acceleration ( inflation ) may occur in the corresponding string frame via the conformal transformation  @xcite .",
    "thus , if there exists a kind of duality between the bounce phenomenon in the einstein frame and inflation in the string frame , and vice versa , by comparing the theoretical results on the spectral index of the curvature perturbations and the tensor - to - scalar ratio in the einstein frame with their observational values and using such a duality , we can judge whether the corresponding bounce cosmology is realistic or not ( see also ref .",

    "<S> we explore cosmology with a bounce in gauss - bonnet gravity where the gauss - bonnet invariant couples to a dynamical scalar field . in particular , the potential and and gauss - bonnet coupling function of the scalar field are reconstructed so that the cosmological bounce can be realized in the case that the scale factor has hyperbolic and exponential forms . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we examine the relation between the bounce in the string ( jordan ) and einstein frames by using the conformal transformation between these conformal frames . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that in general , the property of the bounce point in the string frame changes after the frame is moved to the einstein frame . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it is found that at the point in the einstein frame corresponding to the point of the cosmological bounce in the string frame , the second derivative of the scale factor has an extreme value . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , it is demonstrated that at the time of the cosmological bounce in the einstein frame , there is the gauss - bonnet coupling function of the scalar field , although it does not exist in the string frame .    </S>",
