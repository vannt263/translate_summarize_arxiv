    "note that because the @xmath54 symmetry is local , for nonzero chemical potential @xmath17 one should introduce a source term @xmath55 in lagrangian density ( [ lagrangian ] ) in order to make the system neutral with respect to hypercharge @xmath2 .",
    "this is necessary since otherwise in such a system thermodynamic equilibrium could not be established .",

    "@xcite , we use the first approach .    as was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , in accordance with the sample of spontaneous breakdown of the global symmetry , @xmath61 , there are two gapless ng bosons in this model .",
    "the other excitations are massive ( the higgs mechanism ) .",
    "because electric superconductivity is realized in the model , it is naturally to expect that vortices may exist there .",
    "as will be shown in this paper , this is indeed the case .",
    "vortices are topologically nontrivial configurations with fields approaching their vacuum values at spatial infinity @xcite .",
    "mathematically , vortices are topologically stable whenever the first homotopy group @xmath62 of the vacuum manifold @xmath63 is nontrivial ( here @xmath64 is an internal symmetry group of the action in a model and its subgroup @xmath65 is a symmetry group of the vacuum . ) we emphasize that this criterion of the topological stability is sufficient but not necessary .",
    "in particular , as will be shown below , magnetic vortices , the most interesting vortex solutions in the present model , are topologically stable due to another criterion .    according to eq .",
    "( [ vacuum ] ) , two complex fields @xmath66 and @xmath67 have nonzero vacuum expectation values in the ground state of the gauged @xmath1-model at finite density . therefore a priori there can be different types of topologically stable vortex solutions : both the field @xmath66 and the field @xmath67 can wind around the spatial circle at infinity .",
    "i.e. , in the cylindrical coordinates @xmath68 , as @xmath69 , the asymptotics of these fields take the form @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are integer .",
    "let us turn to the analysis of a topological stability of solutions with these asymptotics .    in this model ,",
    "the internal group @xmath64 is @xmath0 and the symmetry group @xmath65 of vacuum ( [ vacuum ] ) is trivial .",
    "therefore the first homotopy group of the vacuum manifold in the model is @xmath73 = @xmath74 = @xmath75 = @xmath76 , where @xmath76 is the group of integer numbers ( here we use the fact that since the @xmath32 manifold is simply connected , @xmath77 ) .",
    "this seems to suggest that there exist only topologically stable vortex solutions connected with the hypercharge @xmath54 .",
    "however , as will be shown below , the situation in this model is more sophisticated and there exist also other topologically stable vortices .",
    "the point is that while the scalar field @xmath15 is assigned to the fundamental representation of the @xmath32 group , the gauge field @xmath78 is assigned to the adjoint one .",
    "because of that , @xmath32 gauge transformations for @xmath78 reduce to @xmath79 ones .",
    "it is important that , unlike @xmath32 , the manifold of @xmath79 is not simply connected and @xmath80 with @xmath81 .",
    "as will become clear in a moment , this point is quite important in the analysis of the topological stability of the solutions .",
    "we begin by considering the conventional case when @xmath82 in asymptotics ( [ gasympt ] ) : @xmath83 this configuration can be obtained from the vacuum configuration ( [ vacuum ] ) by using the @xmath54 gauge transformation @xmath84 .",
    "it is clear that in this case the solutions with different @xmath72 are assigned to different topological classes described by the homotopy group @xmath85 .",
    "therefore , if such vortex solutions exist , they are topologically stable . due to the evident reasons , we will call them hypermagnetic vortices .",
    "they possess hypermagnetic fluxes with a ( hypermagnetic ) winding number @xmath86 .",
    "let us now turn to a more interesting case of asymptotics ( [ gasympt ] ) with @xmath87 : @xmath88 it is a rather unusual situation : the phase @xmath89 is now related to a vector field and not to a scalar one .",
    "it is clear that configuration ( [ masympt ] ) can be obtained from vacuum configuration ( [ vacuum ] ) by using the gauge transformation @xmath90 where electric charge @xmath53 is equal to -1 for the field @xmath66 and zero for the scalar field @xmath67 .    because for the vector fields the @xmath32 transformations are reduced to the @xmath79 ones , it is important to distinguish two cases : with @xmath71 being even and @xmath71 being odd . in the first case , with @xmath91 , as the angle @xmath92 running from 0 to @xmath93 ,",
    "the gauge transformation ( [ mtransf ] ) defines closed loops both on the manifold of @xmath32 and that of @xmath94 .",
    "then , because @xmath95 = @xmath76 , we conclude that these solutions are topologically equivalent to the hypermagnetic vortex solutions with the winding number @xmath96 considered above .",
    "the case with odd @xmath97 is more sophisticated . in this case , as @xmath92 changing from 0 to @xmath93 , the gauge transformation ( [ mtransf ] ) does _ not _ define closed loops neither on the @xmath32 manifold nor on the @xmath54 one .",
    "therefore in this case one can not use the homotopic group @xmath98 for studying the topological stability of these solutions .",
    "let us show that for this purpose one can use the homotopic group @xmath99 instead .",
    "the reasons are the following .",
    "because the hypercharge of the gauge field @xmath78 is zero , the action of the gauge transformation ( [ mtransf ] ) on it is given by the operator @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is a @xmath32 generator in the adjoint representation .",
    "as the angle @xmath92 changing from 0 to @xmath93 , this transformation _ does _ define a closed loop on the @xmath79 manifold , which coincides with the vacuum manifold of @xmath78 . )",
    "includes two linearly independent isovectors , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 , and there is no subgroup in @xmath79 under which two linearly independent isovectors are invariant . ]",
    "therefore , one can indeed use the homotopic group @xmath104 for the description of the topological stability of these solutions .",
    "now , because odd values of @xmath71 correspond to the element + 1 of @xmath104 , we conclude that this loop can not be unwinded and , therefore , these vortex solutions are topologically stable . due to the form of gauge transformation ( [ mtransf ] ) ,",
    "we will call them magnetic vortices .",
    "they possess magnetic fluxes with a ( magnetic ) winding number @xmath105 : the minus sign here corresponds to a negative electric charge of @xmath106 bosons .",
    "a detailed study of the topological structure of the set of these solutions is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "here we will only argue that the solutions with different values of @xmath107 are topologically inequivalent .",
    "the argument is based on gauge transformation ( [ mtransf ] ) .",
    "it implies that although for odd @xmath108 the path defined by this transformation on the @xmath54 manifold is not closed , it contains @xmath107 windings .",
    "therefore the solutions with different @xmath107 should be assigned to different topological classes , i.e. , they can not be transformed from one into another by using a continuous deformation .",
    "the last case is that with the `` hybrid '' asymptotics @xmath109 with both @xmath71 and @xmath72 being nonzero . in this case",
    "the gauge transformation ( [ mtransf ] ) is replaced by @xmath110 using the same arguments as above , we conclude the following . for even @xmath111 , these solutions are topologically equivalent to the hypermagnetic vortices with fluxes corresponding to the winding number @xmath112 . as to odd @xmath113 , they yield new topological classes of solutions .",
    "these solutions carry both magnetic and hypermagnetic fluxes with winding numbers @xmath114 , with @xmath115 taking odd integers @xmath116 and @xmath86 .",
    "it will be shown in sec . [",
    "five ] that the hybrid vortices can be considered as composites of the magnetic and hypermagnetic ones .    as to the topological structure of the solutions for hybrid vortices with odd @xmath117 , a comparison of eq .",
    "( [ hbtransf ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ mtransf ] ) suggests the following generalization of the conclusion that was made above for the case of the magnetic vortices : the hybrid vortices with different @xmath118 are topologically inequivalent .",
    "this concludes the analysis of the topological stability of vortex solutions .",
    "as will be shown below , these three types of vortex solutions exist in the present model indeed .",
    "in this section , we will analyze the solutions for the magnetic vortices having asymptotics ( [ masympt ] ) with @xmath71 being odd . to be concrete",

    "vortex solutions are static @xmath120-independent configurations .",
    "we will consider the following ansatz for them in the cylindrical coordinates @xmath68 ( the reasons for choosing this ansatz will be discussed in more detail below ) : @xmath121 where @xmath122 and @xmath123 are angular components of the electromagnetic field @xmath124 and the @xmath76-boson field @xmath125 ( all other components of the fields are equal to zero ) . is decomposed as @xmath126 , where @xmath127 . ]    using equations of motion ( [ eqs-1 - 1])-([eqs-1 - 3 ] ) , one can check that ansatz ( [ ansatz1 ] ) is consistent with them and they reduce to the following system of five coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations : @xmath128 @xmath129 @xmath130 @xmath131 @xmath132 note that although the phase in the exponent @xmath133 in @xmath66 in eq .",
    "( [ ansatz1 ] ) is of the electromagnetic @xmath52 origin , this ansatz contains in addition also @xmath123 field .",
    "this is because the @xmath49 condensate mixes the gauge fields @xmath134 and @xmath135 ( see eqs .",
    "( [ ode-1 - 3 ] ) and ( [ ode-1 - 4 ] ) ) .",
    "it is instructive to compare ansatz ( [ ansatz1 ] ) and equations of motion ( [ ode-1 - 1])-([ode-1 - 5 ] ) with those in the abelian higgs model .",
    "obviously , @xmath66 plays the role of the higgs field .",
    "the fields @xmath122 and @xmath123 are analogous to the abelian gauge field .",
    "the fields @xmath136 and @xmath137 do not have analogs in the abelian higgs model .",
    "of course , they are present in ansatz ( [ ansatz1 ] ) in order to ensure the correct vacuum asymptotics at infinity .",
    "thus , the fields @xmath136 and @xmath137 have a somewhat different status in the vortex ansatz comparing to the fields @xmath66 , @xmath122 , and @xmath123 .",
    "we will discuss this point in more detail below , when we consider the ultraviolet boundary conditions for these fields .",
    "the infrared boundary conditions at @xmath69 follow from the requirement of finiteness of the energy per unit length of a vortex , which implies that fields tend to their vacuum values : @xmath138    as to the ultraviolet boundary conditions at @xmath139 , because @xmath139 is a regular singular point of the system of differential equations ( [ ode-1 - 1])-([ode-1 - 5 ] ) , these boundary conditions follow from the equations themselves if one utilizes the condition of regularity of the solution at this point : @xmath140 @xmath141 the ultraviolet boundary conditions ( [ bc - ir1 - 1 ] ) for the fields @xmath49 and @xmath122 , @xmath123 are like those for a higgs field and a gauge field , respectively , in the abelian higgs model : they guarantee that these fields are single valued at @xmath142 . unlike them , the fields @xmath136 and @xmath137 have neumann boundary conditions which imply that there is no influx of momentum for these fields at the boundary @xmath143 .",

    ", the fluxes of hybrid vortices are equal to @xmath210 } { gg^{\\prime}\\sqrt{g^2+g^{\\prime 2 } } } \\ , , \\label{flux - hybrid - em}\\ ] ] @xmath211    these expressions can be rewritten in the following transparent way : @xmath212 @xmath213 where @xmath214 and @xmath215 are the fluxes of the magnetic and hypermagnetic vortices given by eqs.([flux1 ] ) and ( [ flux2-em ] ) , ( [ flux2-z ] ) , respectively ( recall that @xmath216 ) .",
    "this suggests that the hybrid vortices can be considered as composites of the magnetic and hypermagnetic ones .",
    "note that the sum of the energies per unit length for the magnetic vortex and the hypermagnetic one is equal to @xmath217 . on the other hand , because the energies for the hybrid vortices with @xmath218 and @xmath219 are equal to 1.49 and 2.3 , respectively , they satisfy the inequality @xmath220 .",
    "this inequality implies that while the hybrid vortex with equal phases is stable , the hybrid vortex with opposite phases is not .",
    "the set of vortex solutions we obtained in the gauged @xmath0 @xmath1-model with the chemical potential for hypercharge is quite rich . in particular , there are different types of vortices connected either with photon field or hypercharge gauge field , or with both of them .",
    "the richness of this set is provided by the structure of the ground state ( [ vacuum ] ) , which includes vector condensates .",
    "this ground state describes an anisotropic medium with electric superconductivity .",
    "it is quite noticeable that the sample of symmetry breaking in this model is the same as in the gluonic phase in neutral two - flavor qcd @xcite , while the present model is much simpler .",
    "the point is that because of a nonzero baryon density in the gluonic phase , its dynamics in the hard - dense - loop approximation is mostly provided by quark loops . and since most of the initial symmetries ( including rotational @xmath221 ) in this phase are spontaneously broken , the calculation of its effective action is quite involved .",
    "this makes the study of vortex solutions in the gluonic phase to be quite a difficult problem . on the other hand",
    ", vortices could be very important for understanding the dynamics of quark matter in compact stars .",
    "the existence of such solutions in a related but much simpler model is encouraging .",
    "it is instructive to compare the present vortex solutions with those in such complex condensed matter systems as the @xmath222 phase in @xmath223 @xcite and high @xmath224 superconductors @xcite . unlike the conventional abrikosov - nielsen - olesen vortices @xcite ,",
    "the initial symmetries are not completely restored in the core of vortices in those systems . in @xmath223 ,",
    "vortices with an a - phase core or with asymmetric core are realized . in high @xmath224 superconductors",
    ", there is an antiferromagnetic condensate in the vortex core .",
    "a similar situation takes place for the magnetic and hypermagnetic vortices in the present model . in the core of a magnetic vortex , while the order parameter @xmath66 is zero , the order parameter @xmath67 is not ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . therefore , in its core",
    "only the @xmath52 symmetry is restored . in the core of a hypermagnetic vortex , we found that while @xmath225 , the order parameter @xmath66 is not zero ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . therefore",
    ", only the @xmath94 symmetry is restored in the core in this case . on the other hand ,",
    "the whole abelian @xmath226 gauge symmetry is restored in the core of a hybrid vortex ( see figs . 3 and 4 ) .",
    "recently , there has been a considerable interest in systems with coexisting order parameters ( such as high @xmath224 superconductors ) in condensed matter @xcite .",
    "generating vector condensates is a very natural way of creating such systems ( for example , in the present model , electric superconductivity coexists with spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking ) .",
    "this possibility deserves further study .",
    "one of us ( v.a.m . ) acknowledges an inspiring question of d. t. son concerning a possibility of the existence of vortex solutions in the linear @xmath1 model with the chemical potential for hypercharge .",
