    "the studies of dielectric polarization in fluids @xcite are based on the following relation between the polarization @xmath0 and the electric field strength @xmath1 inside the dielectric : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the field dependent dielectric permittivity .",

    "the linear dielectric permittivity @xmath5 of an isotropic fluid is given by the ratio of the polarization to the internal field strength : @xmath6 in strong electric fields the polarization response acquires in addition nonlinear contributions , so that the electric permittivity turns into a nonlinear function of the maxwell field : @xmath7 for simple molecular liquids",
    "the coefficients of the power series decrease rapidly @xcite .",
    "thus in general dielectric experiments can be well described in terms of the linear dielectric permittivity . for liquids consisting of small molecules this series can be limited to the second term .",

    "<S> the nonlinear dielectric effect for dipolar fluids is studied within the framework of the mean spherical approximation ( msa ) of hard core dipolar yukawa fluids . based on earlier results for the electric field dependence of the polarization </S>",
    "<S> our analytical results show so - called normal saturation effects which are in good agreement with corresponding nvt ensemble monte carlo simulation data . the linear and the nonlinear dielectric permittivities obtained from mc simulations are determined from the fluctuations of the total dipole moment of the system in the absence of an applied electric field . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the msa based theoretical results with the corresponding langevin and debye - weiss behaviors . </S>"
