    "detecting forming planets in protoplanetary disks is crucial for constraining the theory of planet formation , as it directly addresses two key questions : when and where do planets form .",
    "however , it is difficult to directly detect signals from forming planets in protoplanetary disks , and methods for indirect detection are necessitated .    in protoplanetary disks",
    ", planets can excite spiral density waves through gravitational disk - planet interactions @xcite .",
    "density waves have much larger physical scale and can be much more prominent in observations than planets themselves .",
    "once detected , they can be the smoking gun of the embedded unseen planets .",
    "recently , high angular resolution direct imaging observations at near - infrared ( nir ) wavelengths have found spiral - arm - like features in protoplanetary disks around young herbig aebe stars sao  206462 @xcite and mwc  758 @xcite .",
    "these observations obtained polarized intensity ( pi=@xmath10 , the linear polarization component in the scattered light ) images as a way to suppress the central starlight @xcite .",
    "these disks are relatively face - on , and show a pair of grand - design spiral arms often extending over @xmath11 in the azimuthal direction .",
    "these arms are located at several tens to a couple of hundred au from the center , and they are nearly in @xmath2 rotational symmetry . at this moment resolved mm observations of these objects suffer from insufficient spatial resolution , and could not pinpoint the mm counterparts of these arms @xcite .",
    "also , the parent disks are recognized as transitional disks @xcite , with a giant cavity at the center .",
    "the origin of the observed spiral arms is unclear , though they have been widely speculated to be density waves excited by embedded unseen planets . in linear theory of density waves , the pitch angle , defined as the angle between the azimuthal direction and the tangent of the waves ,",
    "is set by the aspect ratio @xmath12 of the disk , thereby the disk temperature @xcite .",
    "fitting the shape of observed arms to linear theory and assuming that the planets are interior to arms has sometimes led to unphysically high disk temperature @xcite .",
    "recently , in a pioneering study @xcite calculated the surface density structures of waves using 2d locally isothermal hydro simulations .",
    "the resulting disk structures were puffed up in the vertical dimension assuming a gaussian profile , and synthesized nir images were produced using 3d radiative transfer simulations .",
    "it was concluded that the amplitude of the waves induced by a 1@xmath13 planet at 25  au in a typical disk is too small to be visible with current nir facilities .    in this paper following @xcite",
    ", we revisit the observational appearance of planet - induced density waves in nir imaging observations .",
    "the primary question we address is whether planets can drive density waves that resemble the directly imaged spiral arms . to do this",
    ", we carry out 3d global hydrodynamics simulations using the athena++ code to calculate the density structures of disks .",
    "both locally isothermal ( iso ) and adiabatic ( adi ) equations of states are explored , and we highlight both the inner and outer density waves .",
    "the resulting 3d hydro models are fed into 3d monte carlo radiative transfer ( mcrt ) simulations to produce synthetic model images at @xmath14 ( @xmath15  band ) using the @xcite code .",
    "the hydro and mcrt simulations are introduced in section  [ sec : setup ] ; the modeling results are presented in section  [ sec : results ] , followed by a short summary in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the detailed discussion of the hydro simulations using the athena++ code and the density wave structure will be presented in zhu et al .",
    "( in prep ) . here",
    "we provide a short summary of the models .",
    "athena++ is the newly developed grid based code using a higher - order godunov scheme for mhd and the constrained transport ( ct ) to conserve the divergence - free property for magnetic fields ( stone in prep . ) .",
    "compared with its predecessor athena @xcite , athena++ is highly optimized for efficiency and uses flexible grid structures , allowing global numerical simulations spanning a large range of scales .",
    "we have carried out global 3-d simulations in spherical coordinates @xmath16 ( radial ) , @xmath17 ( polar ) , and @xmath18 ( azimuthal ) with both isothermal and adiabatic equation of states . in the adiabatic",
    "runs the adiabatic index @xmath19 is chosen to be 1.4 .",
    "the initial disk temperature @xmath20 is constant on cylinders @xmath21 therefore the initial disk scale height @xmath22 ( @xmath23 is the sound speed and @xmath24 is the angular frequency in the disk ) , and @xmath25 at 50  au . the disk density and azimuthal velocity are set to maintain hydrostatic equilibrium ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the initial disk surface density @xmath26 decreases as @xmath27 in all our simulations .",
    "the grids are uniformly spaced in log @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 with 256@xmath28128@xmath28688 grid cells in the domain of [ 15 , 150 ( au)]@xmath28[@xmath29 - 0.6 , @xmath29 + 0.6 ] @xmath28[0 , 2@xmath30 .",
    "constant @xmath31 viscosity with @xmath32 has been applied . at inner and outer boundaries ,",
    "all quantities are fixed at the initial states .",
    "we have run the simulations for 20 planetary orbits .",
    "the planet is on a fixed circular orbit , and there is no accretion from the disk onto the planet .",
    "the time scale is chosen so that density waves have established throughout the whole disk ( longer than the sound crossing time ) while a big and deep gap has not been opened ( and consequently no vortex generated at the gap edge ) .",
    "the gap opening process depends on the level of turbulent stress in the disk , which is poorly constrained . in total",
    ", we carry out 6 models , and their properties are summarized in table  [ tab : models ] .",
    "density distributions obtained in our hydro simulations were post - processed via the 3d mcrt calculations using the code developed by @xcite , which has been used to model protoplanetary disks in the past ( e.g. @xcite ) . in mcrt simulations , photons from the central star",
    "are absorbed / reemitted or scattered by the dust in the surrounding disk . the temperature in each grid cell",
    "is calculated based on the radiative equilibrium algorithm described in @xcite .",
    "the anisotropic scattering phase function is approximated using the henyey - greenstein function @xcite .",
    "polarization is calculated assuming a rayleigh - like phase function for the linear polarization @xcite .",
    "full resolution synthesized pi images at @xmath15  band ( @xmath14 ) are produced for all models with a pixel size of 0.7  au / pixel ] , or [ ergs  s@xmath33  @xmath34  hz@xmath33  arcsec@xmath35 . ] .",
    "these images are then convolved by a gaussian point spread function ( psf ) with a full width half maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath36 and assuming a distance of 140  pc , to achieve an angular resolution comparable with nir direct imaging observations using subaru , vlt , and gemini ( the fwhm of a theoretical airy disk is @xmath37 for a primary mirror with a diameter @xmath38  m at @xmath39 ) .",
    "the mcrt simulation setup is similar to @xcite .",
    "we construct a 3d disk structure in spherical coordinates with the same grid structure as in the hydro models ( @xmath40 is west in all images ) .",
    "the central source is a typical herbig ae / be star with a temperature of @xmath41  k and a radius of @xmath42 .",
    "all simulations are run with 3 billion photon packages .",
    "the dust grains in the disk are assumed to be interstellar medium ( ism ) grains @xcite made of silicate , graphite , and amorphous carbon .",
    "their size distribution is a smooth power law in the range of 0.002 - 0.25  @xmath43 followed by an exponential cut off beyond 0.25  @xmath43 .",
    "these grains are small enough so that they are dynamically well coupled to the gas , and thus have a volume density linearly proportional to the gas density .",
    "the optical properties of the grains can be found in figure 2 in @xcite .",
    "the total mass of the ism grains is assumed to be @xmath44 , a 100:1 gas - to - dust - mass - ratio , a @xmath45 dust mass fraction in the small ism grains , and the rest 90% in the large grains that have already settled to the disk midplane and do not affect nir scattering . ] .",
    "in this section we present the modeling results .",
    "the artificial central cavity in the hydro models produces a bright rim structure at its edge in scattered light images , which contaminates disk structure within @xmath46  au from the center in convolved images .",
    "therefore , we focus only on the outer arms in the @xmath47  au models and the inner arms in the @xmath48  au models , which are all located at @xmath49  au .      the surface density perturbation @xmath50 ( where @xmath26 is the initial surface density ) of the hydro models are shown in the left column in figures  [ fig:1mj ] and [ fig:6mj ] .",
    "when @xmath51 , a planet excites one inner and one outer waves originated from the planet ( the primary arms from now on ) and another two shifted by roughly @xmath11 in the azimuthal direction ( the secondary arms from now on ) , while their strengths depend on @xmath52 , @xmath12 , and eos .",
    "the primary waves are always stronger than the secondary waves , which are practically not recognizable in 1iso50 and 1adi50 runs but visible in all other cases . in @xmath6 models , @xmath53 never exceeds @xmath26 by @xmath54 , consistent with @xcite , while in the @xmath0 models the surface density enhancement of the primary waves can be more than @xmath55 ( table  [ tab : models ] ) . @xmath56",
    "enhancement in iso models is close to twice that in the corresponding adi models .",
    "we note that since in 3d the disk is not hydrostatic in the vicinity of the shock , its vertical structure can not be fully described by puffing up the surface density distribution from 2d simulations assuming hydrostatic ( gaussian ) vertical density profile , as performed in @xcite .",
    "full resolution and convolved @xmath15  band images for all models are shown in figure  [ fig:1mj ] and [ fig:6mj ] .",
    "the outer arms in the @xmath6 models are practically not traceable in both full resolution images and convolved images , echoing @xcite ( they are recognizable in the @xmath57-scaled convolved images as the dynamical range of the background is largely suppressed ) .",
    "the peak surface brightness enhancement along the waves is @xmath58 ( table  [ tab : models ] ) , producing only marginal fluctuations on radial and azimuthal image profiles ( figure  [ fig : image_profiles ] ) .",
    "the @xmath0 models produce much more prominent arms ( figure  [ fig:6mj ] and [ fig : image_profiles ] )",
    ". the primary arm in 6adi50 can be up to @xmath592 times brighter than the background , and it is radially extended , with a radial width @xmath60 at @xmath61 .",
    "note that the contrast of arms in our convolved images are expected to be higher than in observations due to ( 1 ) model images are convolved by a gaussian psf , which has a similar kernel but less extended wings than a realistic psf , and ( 2 ) no observational noises and instrument effects are included , which will further weaken the contrast of features .",
    "the 2 outer arms have a rough @xmath2 symmetry , and are tightly wound , with pitch angles no bigger than @xmath62 ( table  [ tab : models ] ) , which is roughly half the values in observed systems ( listed in table  [ tab : models ] as well for comparison ) .",
    "they may not be distinguishable from a ring structure in observations with low s / n .",
    "an interesting finding is that arms in adi models are more prominent than in iso models .",
    "the arm surface brightness enhancement in 1iso50 is only half of that in 1adi50 , despite having a surface density enhancement 2 times larger .",
    "@xmath0 models show similar effects .",
    "this is caused by a combination of shock heating and hydraulic effects in waves .",
    "as predicted by @xcite and shown in simulations @xcite , density waves shock at a couple of scale heights away from the planet s orbit when @xmath63 .",
    "shock heating heats material along the waves in adi cases , resulting in a higher scale height than in iso cases and puffing up the waves in the vertical direction ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "the hydraulic effects seen in 3d simulations of wave shocks by @xcite also makes adi waves more puffed up . also interestingly , in the @xmath65 models while both arms are visible in 6iso50 with roughly equal strengths ( also note the brightening behind the planet , @xcite ) , in 6adi50 the primary arm is much more prominent .",
    "this may indicate a difference in the excitation and dynamics between the two arms , as the shock heating and hydraulic effects are more effective in the primary arm .",
    "lastly , we perform experiments in which we collapse our 3d hydro disks to 2d , then puff them up back to 3d assuming gaussian profiles in the vertical structure , similar to what was done in @xcite .",
    "results show that a full 3d hydro treatment does not affect the detectability in the outer arms excited by a @xmath6 planet , however in @xmath65 models it does produce noticeable differences in images , particularly for the inner arms .",
    "a more detailed discussion can be found in zhu et al .",
    "( in prep ) .      in our simulations the inner arms are open and prominent . in convolved images ,",
    "the arms are up to @xmath66 brighter than the background region at the same radius in 1iso125 , and @xmath67 brighter in 6iso125 ( table  [ tab : models ] ) .",
    "interestingly , although the secondary arm are much weaker than the primary in surface density contrast , the two are roughly equally bright in scattered light images . in the azimuthal direction ,",
    "the primary and secondary arms extends over @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively .",
    "the 2 arms are roughly @xmath11 rotationally symmetric ( in both location and contrast ) .",
    "the pitch angle is about @xmath70 for the primary arm and @xmath71 for the secondary .",
    "the typical fwhm of the arms in the radial direction is @xmath72 .",
    "in general , the morphology of the inner arms is quite similar to the observed ones in sao  206462 @xcite and mwc  758 @xcite , in terms of ( 1 ) the rough @xmath2 symmetry , ( 2 ) pitch angle , and ( 3 ) azimuthal extension .",
    "we note that the shape ( i.e. pitch angle ) of these inner arms can not be described by the linear theory in @xcite , as the waves are highly nonlinear .",
    "a comparison between mwc758 and a rescaled 6iso125 model with the actual source distance and angular resolution is shown in figure  [ fig : comparison ] .",
    "in addition , for observed arms while it is difficult to measure the surface brightness enhancement ( difficulty in defining a true `` background '' ) and radial width ( noises in the data ) in an equally clean way as we do to our theoretical models here , observed arms are mostly in the bulk part @xmath73 brighter than the background and around @xmath74 in width in the radial direction , broadly consistent with the 6iso125 model . in general , the morphology of the inner arms in the 6iso125 run is tantalizingly similar to the observed ones .",
    "our main conclusions are :    1",
    ".   the inner spiral arms excited by a massive planet ( @xmath75 ) can be visible in scattered light images under current nir direct imaging capability , and they have a morphology resembling the observed spirals , such as in the sao  206462 @xcite and mwc  758 @xcite systems ( figure  [ fig : comparison ] ) .",
    "they exhibit ( 1 ) roughly @xmath2 symmetry , ( 2 ) pitch angles in between @xmath76 , ( 3 ) an azimuthal extent of @xmath4 , and ( 4 ) @xmath5 surface brightness enhancement relative to the background , all broadly consistent with observations .",
    "note that the shape of these arms can not be fully described by the weakly non - linear theory @xcite .",
    "2 .   the outer spiral arm excited by a @xmath77 planet can also be visible .",
    "however they can not explain the observed spiral arms , as they are too tightly wound given typical disk scale height ( pitch angle @xmath78 , 2.5 times or more smaller than observations ) , which has been noted in the case of mwc  758 by @xcite .",
    "in addition , the contrast of the isothermal waves is lower than observed spiral arms , while the more prominent adi waves are too extended in the radial direction , with a radial width a factor of 2 or more larger than observations .",
    "planet induced density waves have a higher surface density enhancement in isothermal disks than in adiabatic disks .",
    "however , in scattered light images the arms in adiabatic disks are more prominent , thanks to a more extended structure in the vertical direction due to shock heating and possibly hydraulic effects . also , 3d effects in isothermal waves can be important ( zhu et al . in perp . )",
    "one key factor in the appearance of planet - induced density waves may be that the gap can not be fully opened by the planet given the duration of our simulations , so that the bulk part of waves are not located in a deep gap region . in our models , the planet is located roughly at a distance 1.5 - 3 times the main part of the inner arms . if observed arms are driven by a companion on a circular orbit outside the arms , then a @xmath79 companion ( possibly a brown dwarf ) is needed at around 100 au in sao  206462 ( at a distance of 140  pc , @xcite ) , and 160  au in mwc  758 ( at a distance of 280  pc , @xcite )",
    ". they can be excellent targets for direct imaging observations .. however , the waves may also be excited by a recent flyby , or a companion on a very eccentric orbit .",
    "lastly , it has been speculated that the cavities in transitional disks are opened by multiple giant planets .",
    "observed global - scale @xmath2 arms so far are all found outside the central cavities in transitional disks .",
    "the hypothetical outer companion suggested in our work can not be associated with the putative cavity - opening planets ; the latter would reside inside the cavity and their density waves are unlikely to be detectable .",
