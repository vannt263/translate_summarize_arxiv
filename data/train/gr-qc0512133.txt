    "analytic formulas for the complete metric can be obtained . as an example we discuss the transformation of a family of counter - rotating disks @xcite which contains the bardeen - wagoner disk @xcite ( see @xcite for the exact solution ) as a limiting case . following @xcite the resulting disk",
    "can be interpreted either as a disk with a purely azimuthal pressure and currents or in a certain range of the physical parameters as two streams of freely moving charged particles , i.e.   which move on electro - geodesics ( solution to the geodesic equation in the presence of a lorentz force ) .",

    "we thus get a static solution with mass @xmath300 and charge @xmath135 which are subject to the relation @xmath301 .",
    "we assume that the asymptotic behavior of the original solution , which is read off on the axis , is of the form @xmath302 , @xmath303 and @xmath304 plus terms of lower order in @xmath305 where @xmath306 is the arnowitt - deser - misner mass , @xmath307 the angular momentum , @xmath135 the electric charge and @xmath308 the magnetic moment .",
    "the same will hold for the harrison transformed potentials .",
    "we find @xmath309 and @xmath310 it is interesting to note that the quantities @xmath311 and @xmath312 are invariants of the transformation . they are related to the casimir operator of the @xmath1-group .",
    "if the original solution was uncharged , the extreme relation @xmath313 is only possible in the limit @xmath314 .",
    "a further invariant is the combination @xmath315 which is of importance in relation to the gyromagnetic ratio @xmath316 relation ( [ group12 ] ) implies that @xmath317 is equal to 2 if @xmath318 and @xmath319 .",
    "thus all solutions which can be generated via a harrison transformation from solutions with vanishing electromagnetic fields as the kerr - newman family from kerr have a gyromagnetic ratio of 2 .",
    "due to the invariance of @xmath315 under harrison transformations , a gyromagnetic ratio of 2 is not changed under the transformation .",
    "in this section we will use the harrison transformation ( [ group10 ] ) on the dust disk @xcite to generate a disk solution to the einstein - maxwell equation .",
    "we discuss the metric , several interesting limiting cases and the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "since the metric function @xmath320 is invariant under harrison transformations , we refer the reader to @xcite for a discussion .",
    "the metric function @xmath275 in ( [ f ] ) is proportional to @xmath321 , which implies that the transformed solution vanishes exactly where the original solution has zeros .",
    "since the set of zeros of @xmath321 just defines the ergoregions , the transformed solution has the same ergoregions ( if any ) as the original solution .    for small @xmath271 ,",
    "the functions @xmath321 and @xmath184 are essentially unchanged since they are quadratic in @xmath271 .",
    "the electromagnetic potential @xmath223 is in this limit with ( [ phi ] ) of the form @xmath322 for larger @xmath271 , @xmath323 becomes smaller near the origin . since its asymptotic values are not changed , the growth rate towards infinity increases which is reflected by the mass formula ( [ group12 ] ) . in the singular limit @xmath324 ,",
    "the function @xmath275 is zero for all finite values of @xmath325 , but one at infinity .",
    "the behavior for @xmath276 is similar with the exception that @xmath276 is odd and zero at infinity .",
    "the function @xmath48 also becomes singular in the limit @xmath324 which is reflected by the diverging factor @xmath326 and the constant @xmath55 ( [ z0 ] ) which just implies that one can no longer choose @xmath48 to be zero on the axis . in the metric function @xmath327 , the factors @xmath328 just cancel and the function is only marginally changed with increasing @xmath271 .",
    "the typical behavior of @xmath329 for values of @xmath271 with @xmath272 can be seen in fig .",
    "[ aprime ] .",
    "the metric function is an even function in @xmath4 which vanishes on the axis and at infinity .",
    "it is analytic except on the disk where the normal derivatives have a jump .",
    "the electromagnetic potential tends to @xmath85 in the limit @xmath324 for finite @xmath23 , but is zero at infinity .",
    "the imaginary part is directly proportional to @xmath276 as can be seen from ( [ b ] ) and ( [ phi ] ) .",
    "we show a typical situation for values of @xmath271 with @xmath272 in fig .",
    "[ rphi ] for the real part and in fig .",
    "[ iphi ] for the imaginary part .",

    "the imaginary part of @xmath223 is an odd function in @xmath4 and has a jump at the disk .",
    "it vanishes at infinity",
    ".    since @xmath275 has the same zeros as @xmath321 , the transformed solution has a diverging central redshift if the untransformed has , i.e.  the ultrarelativistic limits coincide . in the case @xmath186 , one has a charged disk of finite extension with diverging central redshift . for @xmath188 ,",
    "the solution in the exterior of the disk can be interpreted as an extreme kerr - newman metric which is obtained as a harrison - transformed extreme kerr metric .    in the newtonian limit @xmath330 , one has @xmath331 and @xmath332 in lowest order .",
    "this implies with ( [ f ] ) to ( [ phi ] ) for @xmath333 @xmath334 the transformed solution thus has the same newtonian and post - newtonian behavior as the original metric and in addition an electromagnetic field .",
    "the magnetic field is of order @xmath185 as @xmath276 .    since the mass is of order @xmath160 in the newtonian limit , it is possible to have an extreme limit here with @xmath335 as in the reissner - nordstrm solution . if we put @xmath336 with @xmath337 , we get in the limit @xmath338 for ( [ f ] ) and ( [ phi ] ) @xmath339 a static solution similar to the extreme reissner - nordstrm solution , but with a jump in the normal derivatives of the metric functions at the disk and non - vanishing @xmath275 at the origin . since @xmath340 in the whole spacetime , the solution is regular in the exterior of the disk .",
    "thus one gets a non - singular limit in the exterior of the disk for @xmath341 in this case .    in the static limit one has @xmath342 ,",
    "since both are proportional to @xmath184 , @xmath343 the harrison - transformed static solution is thus again static with vanishing magnetic field but non - zero electric field .",
    "it remains to be checked whether and in which range of the parameters the energy - momentum tensor ( [ tensor ] ) is physically acceptable .",
    "the above discussion of the metric indicates the extreme behavior of the metric functions for @xmath271 close to one .",
    "it is plausible that the matter in the disk which is in the present example the source of such an extreme metric will in general not be physically acceptable .",
    "there can be maximal @xmath271 smaller than 1 for given @xmath160 and @xmath0 which limits the physical range of the parameters .",
    "the matter in the disk will be interpreted by following ledvinka et al .",
    "@xcite .    to discuss the energy - momentum tensor and the currents in the disk , it is helpful to use the algebraic relations ( [ 2.9 ] ) to ( [ x0 ] ) between the metric functions which exist at the disk , and which imply similar relations between the transformed potentials . with ( [ 12b ] ) and ( [ 21b ] ) , we get for @xmath133 @xmath344 and thus with ( [ a ] ) for the metric function @xmath283 @xmath345 where @xmath285 is given by ( [ z0 ] ) . with this function",
    "we can determine the angular velocity @xmath346 with respect to infinity of the locally non - rotating observers , for whom the metric is diagonal , @xmath347 this quantity is a measure for the dragging of the inertial frames with respect to infinity due to the rotating matter in the disk .",
    "the dependence of @xmath346 on @xmath348 and @xmath161 has been discussed in @xcite . as a function of @xmath271 it is monotonically decreasing as can be seen in fig . [ ol ] .",
    "the reason for this behavior is that the function @xmath275 tends to zero in the limit @xmath324 for finite @xmath3 , @xmath4 whereas @xmath329 changes shape but remains finite .",
    "thus the overall behavior of @xmath346 is dominated by @xmath275 .",
    "the deformation of the function @xmath329 via @xmath271 has however the consequence that @xmath346 has its maximum for large @xmath271 no longer at the center at the disk but near the rim .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor at the harrison - transformed disk can be calculated via ( [ 16.7 ] ) .",
    "expressing the right - hand sides with the help of ( [ f ] ) and ( [ b ] ) via the original functions , we get @xmath349 where @xmath350 .    similarly a discontinuous electromagnetic tensor @xmath50 leads to a current density @xmath351 via @xmath352 contributions to @xmath307 arise only via the normal derivatives at the disk .",
    "we define the current density @xmath353 in the disk as @xmath354 by the relation @xmath355 .",
    "the electromagnetic energy - momentum tensor does not produce a @xmath0-type contribution to the einstein - maxwell equations since @xmath50 is bounded at the disk . with ( [ gegen6 ] )",
    "we get using equatorial symmetry ( the derivatives are taken at @xmath356 ) @xmath357 this implies @xmath358    the continuity equation ( the bianchi identity ) at the disk @xmath359 leads to the condition @xmath360 we remark that one can substitute one of the equations ( [ 16.7 ] ) by ( [ vac20 ] ) in the same way as one replaces one of the field equations by the covariant conservation of the energy momentum tensor in the case of three - dimensional perfect fluids .",
    "this makes it possible to eliminate @xmath361 from ( [ 16.7 ] ) and to treat the energy - momentum tensor at the disk purely on the level of the ernst equation .",
    "it is straight forward to check the consistency of this approach with the help of ( [ k ] ) .",
    "thus one can solve boundary value problems of dust disks without using @xmath278 .",
    "we will interpret the matter in the disk as in @xcite in two ways .",
    "one possible approach is to introduce observers for whom the tensor @xmath354 is diagonal ( @xmath152-isotropic observers or fios ) , i.e.  we write @xmath354 in the form @xmath362 where @xmath363 and @xmath203 are the unit timelike respectively spacelike vectors @xmath364 and @xmath365 with @xmath366 .",
    "we get @xmath367 and @xmath368 we show @xmath369 for several values of @xmath271 in fig .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath369 decreases monotonically with @xmath271 . for large @xmath271",
    "the maximum of the angular velocity is near or at the rim of the disk in this example .",
    "if the energy conditions are satisfied which is the case here , the fios can interpret the matter in the disk as a fluid with a purely azimuthal pressure . alternatively they can interpret it as being made up of two streams of counter - rotating pressureless matter , @xmath370 with @xmath371 .",
    "the velocity @xmath372 is here below 1 ( the speed of light ) .",
    "the matter streams will however not move on electro - geodesics unless @xmath373 , i.e.  if there are no currents in the frame of the fios .",
    "however it can be seen in fig.[j3 ] that there are in general currents in the frame of the fios .",
    "thus an interpretation of the matter by the fios as freely moving charged particles is not possible .",
    "a different approach is to interpret the matter in the disk as two streams of particles moving on electro - geodesics in the asymptotically non - rotating frame . to this end",
    "we make the ansatz @xmath374 with @xmath375 .",
    "the angular velocity follows from the electro - geodesic equation for each component , @xmath376 such an interpretation is possible if the angular velocities are real .",
    "moreover the velocities @xmath377 in the disk should be smaller than 1 to avoid superluminal velocities , and the energy densities have to be positive , which means we are not interested in tachyonic or otherwise exotic matter .",
    "relation ( [ fio2 ] ) leads to @xmath378 @xmath379 and @xmath380 if we enter ( [ fio3 ] ) with this , we obtain @xmath381 with @xmath382 the densities then follow from ( [ fio2 ] ) where the continuity equation ( [ vac20 ] ) guarantees that this system can be solved .",
    "numerically one finds that the angular velocities are real , but in a wide range of the parameters there are negative energy densities and tachyonic behavior .",
    "already in the uncharged case there are infinite velocities in strongly relativistic settings with negligible counter - rotation which are due to extrema of the metric function @xmath383 in the disk . in this case",
    "the quantity @xmath384 in ( [ fio8 ] ) is zero which leads to a diverging @xmath385 .",
    "increasing @xmath271 only enhances this effect .",
    "the result is that an interpretation as non - tachyonic counter - rotating matter on electro - geodesics with positive energy densities is only possible if @xmath271 , @xmath348 and @xmath161 are not too large . in other words",
    "large values of @xmath271 are in this setting only possible in post - newtonian or nearly static situations .",
    "we show plots of the angular velocities @xmath386 in fig .",
    "[ omp ] for @xmath387 and @xmath388 where values of @xmath271 up to @xmath389 are possible .",
    "the corresponding densities are given in fig .",
    "[ smpm ] ,    and the charge densities in fig .",
    "[ sepm ] .",
    "the densities vanish always at the rim of the disk , the charge densities are identically zero for @xmath274 . for larger values of @xmath271 ,",
    "the angular velocity @xmath385 becomes bigger and bigger at the rim of the disk and finally diverges .",
    "the density @xmath390 is in this case negative in the vicinity of the rim of the disk .",
    "in this article we discussed harrison transformations of solutions to the stationary axisymmetric einstein equations in vacuum to generate solutions to the corresponding einstein - maxwell equations .",
    "the case of hyperelliptic solutions to the ernst equation was studied in detail .",
    "this led to a class of solutions to the einstein - maxwell system which contains the following degrees of freedom : a real - valued function @xmath96 , a set of complex branch points @xmath62 and a parameter @xmath271 related to the total charge of the spacetime .",
    "since the complete metric is given explicitly , one could in principle try to solve physically interesting boundary value problems as dust disks with a magnetic field within this class .    as a first step in this direction we have considered a harrison transformation of a family of counter - rotating dust disk solutions where the matter rotates in the frame of the fios on geodesics .",
    "the matter in the disk could be interpreted as moving on electro - geodesics in a certain range of the physical parameters , but in general not in the frame of the fios .",
    "as expected one can not hope that a harrison transformation preserves certain features of the matter as electro - geodesic motion in the fio frame .",
    "if one wants to generate solutions with such properties or disks made up of charged pressureless particles without additional currents , one will have to solve the corresponding boundary value problem .",
    "whether this will be possible within the class of harrison transformed hyperelliptic solutions of the ernst equation is an open question . for more general cases one will have to use korotkin",
    "s theta functional solutions to the einstein - maxwell equations on three - sheeted surfaces , where however the powerful calculus of hyperelliptic surfaces can no longer be used .",
