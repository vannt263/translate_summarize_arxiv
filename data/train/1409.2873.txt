    "tight correlations between bh masses and several properties of their host galaxies ( such as the stellar bulge mass , luminosity , and velocity dispersion ) have been observed , suggesting a common formation scenario ( co - evolution ) for galaxies and bhs at their center , but the physical drivers of this co - evolution may be different in different kind of galaxies ( for a recent thorough review see kormendy & ho 2013 ) .",
    "the mean bh - stellar bulge mass ratio , @xmath10 , estimated from observations of a sample of @xmath11 quasar is about 10 times higher than the local value ( wang et al .",
    "although these results could be biased by large uncertainties and observational selection effects ( lauer et al .",
    "2007 ; volonteri & stark 2011 ) , a possible explanation to this discrepancy could be that bhs form before or faster than their host galaxy stellar bulges at these early epochs ( lamastra et al .",
    "2010 ) .    given the large energy released by bh accretion , qsos activity is expected to play a critical role in shaping the star formation history ( sfh ) of the host galaxy , ultimately self - regulating bh growth . indeed ,",

    "these studies have demonstrated that in order to investigate the formation and growth of black holes and their host galaxies , one must embed their evolution in a cosmological setting ( volonteri & bellovary 2013 ) .    to interpret the observed / inferred properties of high - z quasars mentioned above , all the aspects of bh - galaxy co - evolution must be explained and modelled simultaneously in an adequate , self - consistent cosmologically evolving context . as an attempt to progress in this direction ,",
    "we have developed a semi - analytical model for the formation and evolution of high redshift quasars , gamete / qsodust ( valiante et al . 2011 ) , which is able to follow the hierarchical assembly and merger history of both the host galaxy and its central bh . the formation and evolution of the chemical properties of the host galaxy , namely the mass of gas , stars , metals and dust are consistently followed in the model .    as a pilot study",
    "we have used this model to investigate possible evolutionary scenarios of one of the best studied quasars , sdss j1148 + 5251 ( hereafter j1148 ) , observed at redshift @xmath16 . in valiante",
    "et al . ( 2011 ) we pointed out that the the observed properties of j1148 , such as the bh mass , the mass of gas and dust in the ism , are reproduced only if distinct evolutionary paths are followed .",
    "in particular , if stars form according to a larson initial mass function ( imf ) , with a characteristic mass @xmath17 ( see eq  [ eq : imf ] ) , that we call _ standard imf _ , at the end of its evolution , j1148 settles on the local @xmath18 relation and the stellar mass at @xmath19 exceeds the upper limit set by the observed dynamical mass by a factor of 3 - 10 ( model b3 ) . alternatively , a larson imf but with a larger characteristic mass of ( @xmath20 ) , that we call _ top - heavy imf _ , can be assumed ( model b1 ) . note that these results have been recently confirmed by calura et al .",
    "( 2013 ) .",
    "although a top - heavy imf ( model b1 ) enables to reproduce the observed dust mass and the deviation of j1148 from the local mbh - mstar relation , the predicted star formation rate at @xmath21 is @xmath22 m@xmath23yr , more than one order of magnitude smaller than the observed value ( @xmath24 m@xmath23yr ) .",
    "this rate is too small to power the observed far infra - red ( fir ) luminosity ( schneider et al .",

    "we extend our analysis to a larger sample of quasars observed between redshift @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",

    "the major improvement in the chemical network is in the equations describing the evolution of the dust . in the previous work ( valiante et al .",

    "dust evolution is described as :    @xmath228    and @xmath229 where @xmath230 and @xmath231 are the dust - to - gas ratios in the two phases .",

    "the considerations discussed in section [ sec : sample ] and , in particular , the observed tight correlation between the observed @xmath121 and @xmath236 suggest that rapid and highly efficient grain growth takes place in the dense molecular gas of high - redshift qsos .",
    "we therefore maximize the dust accretion process assuming that all the gas - phase metals , @xmath237 , that collapse in mc ( during the clouds condensation stage ) and survive the sf process ( are not reincorporated into stars ) can be accreted onto dust grains .",
    "hence , in each galaxy of the merger tree the grain growth rate is computed as : @xmath238[\\dot{m}_{cond}(t ) - sfr(t ) ] \\nonumber \\\\       & & \\rm = [ z_{diff}(t)-d_{diff}(t)](\\alpha_{mc}-1)sfr(t)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath239 is the mass fraction of gas - phase metals in the diffuse phase .",

    "<S> we investigate the evolutionary properties of a sample of quasars at @xmath0 using the semi - analytical hierarchical model gamete / qsodust . we find that the observed properties of these quasars are well reproduced by a common formation scenario in which stars form according to a standard imf , via quiescent star formation and efficient merger - driven bursts , while the central bh grows via gas accretion and bh - bh mergers . </S>",
    "<S> eventually , a strong agn driven wind starts to clear up the ism of dust and gas , damping the star formation and un - obscuring the line of sight toward the qso . in this scenario , </S>",
    "<S> all the qsos hosts have final stellar masses in the range @xmath1 m@xmath2 , a factor 3 - 30 larger than the upper limits allowed by the observations . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss alternative scenarios to alleviate this apparent tension : the most likely explanation resides in the large uncertainties that still affect dynamical mass measurements in these high - z galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , during the transition between the starburst - dominated and the active qso phase , we predict that @xmath3 of the progenitor galaxies can be classified as sub millimeter galaxies , although their number rapidly decreases with redshift .    </S>",
