    "the response of a conducting system to an alternating electric field is one of the central topics of research in solid - state electrodynamics . besides the linear response , where the induced electric current oscillates at the frequency of the electric field and its amplitude linearly scales with the field amplitude , ac electric field can give rise to a direct motion of charge carriers .",
    "such an electric rectification ( or electronic ratchet effect ) naturally occurs in macroscopically inhomogeneous structures such as diodes or field - effect transistors,@xcite asymmetric lattices,@xcite or systems with asymmetric patterning.@xcite the ratchet transport of carriers arises also in macroscopically homogenous structures ( homogenous in all three dimensions for bulk materials or homogenous in the plane for two - dimensional systems ) provided the structures lack the center of space inversion.@xcite the ratchet effects are used for the study of spatial symmetry of semiconductor structures,@xcite details of the electron energy spectrum,@xcite and also underlie the operation of fast detectors of microwave and terahertz radiation.@xcite    the efficiency of the generation of a dc current by an ac electric field can be considerably enhanced in an external magnetic field if the frequency of the ac field is close to the carrier cyclotron frequency . previously , such an enhancement of the electric response at the cyclotron resonance conditions was demonstrated for the spin currents in hgte quantum wells ( qws)@xcite and hgte - based three - dimensional topological insulators@xcite and for the electric currents of photon drag induced by teraherzt radiation.@xcite the orbital ratchet transport of electrons in macroscopically homogenous qws in the presence of a normal magnetic field has not been analyzed so far .    here , we develop a quasi - classical microscopic theory of the orbital ratchet effect in qws subjected to a static magnetic field and show that the arising current drastically increases at the cyclotron resonance .",
    "we consider the ratchet current caused by the qw structure inversion asymmetry which may originate from an asymmetry in the confinement potential or doping profile , or induced by a gate voltage .",
    "two geometries , at which the ratchet current emerges and which can be experimentally realized , are analyzed : ( i ) the static magnetic field is normal to the qw plane and the ac electric field has both the in - plane and out - of - plane components and ( ii ) the magnetic field is tilted with respected to the qw normal and the ac electric field is polarized in the qw plane . for the latter geometry",
    "we find that the dc electric current has an additional resonant contribution .",
    "this resonance occurs when the frequency of the ac field matches the double cyclotron frequency , in the spectral range where the free - carrier absorption has no peculiarity .",
    "we also calculate the spatial distribution of the electrostatic potential induced by the ratchet current in infinite and finite - size samples and show that the distribution depends on the magnetic field strength , the sample geometry , and the boundary conditions used .",

    "[ geometry_f ] , the qw asymmetry is modeled by placing the @xmath12-layer of impurities ( black dots ) , which cause electron scattering and control the electron mobility , closer to the bottom interface . as a result , the oscillating electron motion in the qw plane driven by @xmath8 together with the mobility modulation at the same frequency induced by @xmath9 leads to the generation of a direct electric current @xmath2 . at the cyclotron resonance conditions , the amplitude of the oscillating electron motion in the qw plane increases and so does the efficiency of the dc current generation",
