    "the fibers mounted on the atom chip are then connected to the outside of the vacuum chamber via an ultra - high vacuum ( uhv ) compatible feed - through @xcite .",
    "the whole setup can be baked to @xmath10 c and achieves uhv below @xmath15 mbar .      to excite the atoms to fluorescence the tapered lensed fiber delivers the light to a focal spot in the guide potential minimum",
    "our tapered fibers feature a focal length of @xmath16 with a focal diameter of @xmath17  . for the f=2@xmath18f=3 transition in @xmath19 saturation intensity",
    "is reached in the focus at a power of @xmath20  pw .",
    "the focus of the tapered fiber defines the interaction region as shown in figure [ fig : setupdetector](a ) and is located @xmath21   ( half a fiber diameter ) above the chip surface .",
    "the excitation light is generated by an external cavity diode laser ( ecdl ) frequency stabilized to the f=2@xmath18f=3 transition with a precision better than 1  mhz , smaller than the natural line width of the transition .",
    "the probe laser is frequency stabilized to a reference laser by means of a frequency offset ( beating ) lock .",

    "the pd signal is fed into custom built proportional - integral - differential lock electronics ( pid ) stabilizing the beam power with an uncertainty below 10  pw to the set value by controlling the output level of an acousto - optical modulator ( aom ) used as a fast light switch .",
    "the polarization of the excitation light can be rotated employing mechanical fiber paddles .    using a mechanical fiber",
    "splice the stabilized excitation light is coupled into the single - mode tapered lensed fiber guiding the light into the vacuum chamber to the detection region .",
    "the light scattered by the atoms is collected by a multi - mode fiber that guides the light to a single photon counting module ( spcm ) . to protect the spcm and to filter non - resonant background",
    "light a narrow interference filter is included in the beam path ( 3  nm fwhm ) .",
    "the multi - mode fiber has a limited field of view , given by its numerical aperture of na@xmath22 and the core diameter of @xmath23  . only light hitting the core at angles up to maximally @xmath24 will be collected .",
    "consequently only emission from atoms within the dark blue cone marked in figure [ fig : setupdetector](a ) is collected with the full na .",
    "hence the region of maximum collection efficiency for the atomic signal is given by the intersection of the excitation mode field ( red ) and the full na cone .",
    "this defines the detection region , which is depicted yellow in figure [ fig : setupdetector](a ) .",
    "the height of the detection region is automatically aligned to the excitation region since the outer diameters of the fibers match . by aligning the mm fiber such that the collection cone defined by the numerical aperture overlaps with the excitation region we reach both a highly selective excitation of the atoms and a matched collection region .",
    "the angle between the tapered ( excitation ) and the multi - mode ( detection ) fiber has been chosen to be @xmath25 .",
    "this leads to an excellent geometrical suppression of stray light . of each nano watt of excitation light",

    "the position of the magnetic guide above the chip surface is aligned with the focus of the tapered lensed fiber at the detection region by adjusting the current through the chip wire and the strength of the external magnetic field @xcite .",
    "when the atoms are released from the initial z trap into the magnetic guide they thermally expand towards the detector . in the focus of the lensed fiber",
    "the atoms are excited by a laser operating near one of the the rubidium d2 transitions ( for example tuned to the @xmath33 to @xmath34 transition ) and the fluorescence photons are collected by the multi - mode fiber and detected by a single photon counting module ( spcm ) , their arrival times are recorded with 1  ns resolution .",

    "is essentially eliminated with a suppression of better than @xmath26 .",
    "1  nw excitation light contributes only @xmath45  cps to the background .",
    "this excellent suppression of stray light is achieved by the fact that the a tapered lensed fiber delivers excitation light efficiently to a very small detection region and the multi - mode fiber , mounted at an angle of 90 degree , selectively collects the fluorescent photons from this small volume ( fig .",

    "other background sources are stray light from the outside and the glow of the hot dispensers .",
    "an interference filter efficiently suppresses this remaining background to below 10 cps .",

    "[ fig : setupgeneral]b )    the excellent stray light suppression and overall small background level allows high fidelity detection of a single atom and accurate measurements of photon and atom statistics .",
    "an important parameter of the detector is the total number of photons that can be scattered by the guided atoms before they are lost for the detection process .",
    "we discuss this here for detecting @xmath19 atoms in f=2 using the f=2@xmath18f=3 transition .",

    "exciting on the later an atom scatters slightly more than one photon before being optically pumped into the other hyperfine ground state , where it remains dark .",
    "we find that that in our detector each atom scatters @xmath46 photons when excited on the f=2@xmath18f=3 transition .",
    "combining this number with the overall photon detection efficiency given above , we estimate that our detector sees in average @xmath47 photon from each atom passing by .",
    "this number was confirmed from independent global atom number measurements using absorption imaging .",
    "the maximum signal per atom is generated not for resonant illumination , as might be expected , but for a blue detuning of 3  mhz of the exciting light field as shown in figure [ fig : varandmean](e ) .",
    "looking more into the details , the atoms accumulate a time dependent detuning @xmath48 during interaction with the probe field due to photon recoil induced doppler shift .",
    "an initial blue detuning allows pushing the atoms trough resonance to maximize the total number of scattered photons during interaction @xcite .",
    "when an atom arrives at the detector , it absorbs and then re - emits photons .",
    "a few of these photons are counted by the spcm .",
    "this photon scattering strongly disturbs the atom . besides the photon recoil it will pump the atom into an un - trapped state and eventually into a different hyper fine ground state which is not excited by the probing light .",
    "consequently after a time @xmath49 the atom will either leave the detection region and / or stop scattering photons . during detection",
    "each atom emits a photon burst , and on average @xmath38 photons are detected per atom .",
    "these photon bursts lead to a super - poissonian statistics for the detected photons ( fig .",
    "[ fig : varandmean](b ) ) .",
    "as we will show below we can relate the variance and the mean of the photon counts directly to the average number of photons detected per atom ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "a coherent light source of constant mean photon number creates a poisson distributed photon stream with variance equal to the mean , @xmath50 and hence @xmath51 the superpoissonian photon statistics for the atom detection events can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : varandmean](b ) by the jump of / @xmath1 1 as soon as atoms reach the detector .",
    "the statistical atom number fluctuations lead to increase in the photon noise .",
    "the atom number follows its own statistical distribution @xmath52 around a mean value and mandel s formula @xcite can be used to describe the photon count distribution in the presence of atoms .",
    "the probability @xmath53 to measure @xmath54 counts is then expressed by folding the conditional probability @xmath55 to measure @xmath54 counts in the presence of @xmath56 atoms with the atom number probability distribution @xmath57 . @xmath58",
    "the ratio / can then be calculated to @xmath59 hence the ratio of the variance of the photon counts to its mean value deviates from the poissonian value 1 by the number of photon counts per atom @xmath38 times the ratio of variance to mean of the atom number .",
    "if in addition a poissonian background @xmath60 with @xmath61 is taken into account equation [ eq : varmean1 ] is modified and the photon statistics can be expressed as @xmath62    it is worth noting that this relation is independent of the actual atom number . for a poissonian atom number distribution , i.e.  @xmath63 , the signal strength @xmath38 can be measured as the slope of the relation variance versus mean ( see figure [ fig : varandmean](c ) ) .",
