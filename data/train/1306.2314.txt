    "the @xmath8cdm paradigm , in many respects , has proven to been an immensely successful cosmological model .",
    "@xmath8cdm is based on a cosmological constant plus `` cold '' dark matter , i.e. dark matter particles whose streaming velocities are negligible for most astrophysical considerations . on large scales ,",
    "the _ planck _",
    "mission has just delivered another ringing endorsement of this model with its first - year cosmology results @xcite . on scales below a few ( comoving ) mpc , however , the matter power spectrum is still difficult to probe , and it has been repeatedly suggested that dark matter is perhaps `` warm '' , with a free - streaming length that affects the properties of low - mass ( dwarf ) galaxies .",
    "warm dark matter ( wdm ) could alleviate the apparent difficulties of @xmath8cdm models in reproducing some observations related to the matter power spectrum on scales of a few mpc and below .",
    "the most notable possible tensions under @xmath8cdm are : the excess of the number of galactic satellites , the cuspiness and high ( phase space ) density of galactic cores , the luminosities of the milky way s satellites and the properties of galaxies filling voids ( e.g.  @xcite ) .    the main effect of the larger velocities of wdm particles , and the resulting significant free - streaming length , would be to suppress structures on mpc scales and below .",
    "the last few years have seen a re - intensified discussion of this possibility , particularly in light of improvements in numerical models and observations of the mass and internal structure of local group satellites @xcite . it has been suggested that a free - streaming length corresponding to that of a thermal relic wdm particle with a mass of 1 - 2 kev ( and in some cases as low as 0.5 kev ) provides better agreement between the most recent data and numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "the difficulties associated with the cold dark matter paradigm , however , arise on scales where the matter spectrum is highly non - linear at @xmath11 , and where very uncertain baryonic physics is known to play an important role @xcite .",
    "the lyman-@xmath0  absorption produced by intergalactic neutral hydrogen in the spectra of distant quasars ( qsos)the so called `` lyman-@xmath0  forest''provides a powerful alternative tool for constraining dark matter properties , particularly the free - streaming of dark matter particles on the scales in question . the lyman-@xmath0  forest probes the matter power spectrum in the mildly non - linear regime over a large range of redshifts ( @xmath12 in ground - based data ) down to the small scales of interest ( @xmath13 mpc ) @xcite . on large scales",
    "the sdss - iii boss collaboration has recently measured the baryonic acoustic oscillations ( baos ) scale in the 3d correlation function of the lyman-@xmath0  forest in @xmath14 50,000 qsos at @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "these findings further emphasize the value of the lyman-@xmath0  forest as a tracer of cosmological large - scale structure .",
    "constraints on the matter power spectrum from lyman-@xmath0  forest data on small scales are only limited by the thermal cut - off in the flux power spectrum introduced by pressure and thermal motions of baryons in the photo - ionized intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "the igm has a characteristic temperature of @xmath16 . while not trivial , modeling the relevant physics with numerical simulations is reasonably straightforward",
    "; the power spectrum at the relevant redshifts ( @xmath17 ) and scales is only mildly non - linear and stellar feedback effects are much less important than at lower redshifts @xcite .",
    "the basic property of wdm , which impacts on both large scale structure formation and the internal structure of dark matter haloes and the galaxies they are hosting , is the significant `` thermal '' velocities of the wdm particles ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting `` free - streaming '' eliminates density fluctuations on scales below a characteristic comoving wavenumber : @xmath18 and leads to a very distinctive cut - off in the matter power spectrum at a corresponding scale .",
    "for example , the wavenumber at which the linear wdm suppression reaches 50% in terms of matter power , @xmath19 , w.r.t .",
    "the @xmath8cdm case can be approximated as : @xmath20 where this equation uses the numerical results of ref .",
    "@xcite . for standard thermal relics ,",
    "the shape of the cut - off is therefore well characterized in the linear regime and there is an unambiguous relation between the mass of the thermal relic wdm particle and a well - defined free - streaming length ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "note that we will also quote a free - streaming mass , which is the mass at the mean density enclosed in a half - wavelength mode corresponding to @xmath21 .    for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "the analysis here is presented in terms of the mass of a thermal relic dark matter particle , for which there is a one - to - one correspondence between the free - streaming length and the particle mass .",
    "we should point out , however , that in recent years sterile neutrinos and other non - thermal particles have become popular wdm candidates .",
    "some of these models are actually more similar to mixed dark matter models with cold and warm dark matter components .",
    "the shape of the free - streaming `` cut - off '' can then be quite different from that of a thermal relic , and may instead correspond to a downward step in the power spectrum rather than a cut - off ( see @xcite ) .",
    "there is also no universal relation between free - streaming length and mass of the wdm particles in these models , and the normalization and functional form of this relation varies greatly between different non - thermal wdm candidates .",
    "unfortunately , this has led to considerable confusion in the literature when wdm models , characterized by their model - dependent wdm particle masses , are compared between each other and/or thermal relic models and in particular with lyman-@xmath0  forest data .",
    "for example ref .",
    "@xcite quote a sterile neutrino mass of 2kev for their thermal relic wdm model which corresponds , however , to a thermal relic mass of 1.4 kev . for convenience and ease of comparison with the literature , in this work we therefore consider only matter power spectra with cut - off shapes expected for thermal relic wdm particles and quote the unambiguous thermal relic masses ( and corresponding cut - off scale ) to characterize our wdm models .",
    "the lyman-@xmath0 forest , due to its spectral nature , probes the matter power spectrum in velocity space . with increasing redshift the ratio of a given ( comoving ) free - streaming length in velocity space to the thermal cut - off length scale at a given temperature increases as @xmath22 .",
    "there is furthermore strong observational evidence that the temperature of the igm decreases toward higher redshift over the range @xmath23 @xcite , and therefore a corresponding decrease in the thermal cut - off length scale . despite observational difficulties , pushing to high",
    "redshift allows the models to probe smaller free - streaming lengths and thus to improve the limits on wdm masses .",
    "the high - redshift regime has also the advantage of probing structures that are more linear and the wdm cut - off is more prominent at high redshift compared to low redshift @xcite .",
    "lyman-@xmath0  forest data to constrain wdm were first used in ref .",
    "@xcite where a limit of 750 ev was obtained by using n - body simulations only . in previous work ,",
    "@xcite , we used instead two samples of high - resolution qso lyman-@xmath0  forest spectra at @xmath24 to set a lower limit of 550 ev for the mass of a thermal wdm candidate . following this , ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite , using higher - redshift qso spectra from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and applying a different analysis method , significantly improved this limit by a factor @xmath25 . as already noted , however , care has to be taken in the correct modeling of the free - streaming properties of `` non - thermal '' candidate wdm particles of a given model - dependent mass , such as the popular sterile neutrino . in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors have focused on constraints on a range of such models . because of a non - zero mixing angle between active and sterile flavour states , x - ray flux observations can also constrain the abundance and decay rate of such wdm particles ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the joint constraints from lyman-@xmath0  forest data and those from the x - ray fluxes of astrophysical objects now put considerable tension on the parameter space allowed for a sterile neutrino particle with the phase - space distribution proposed by dodelson & widrow @xcite , although other , possibly more phsyical scenarios should be explored @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we presented the most stringent lyman-@xmath0  forest limits up to that date on the free - streaming of dark matter , m@xmath26 4 kev ( 2@xmath27 ) .",
    "that analysis was based on an ( at the time ) unrivaled sample of high - quality , high resolution qso absorption spectra extending to @xmath28 .",
    "the limit is in obvious conflict with many of the recent suggestions for alleviating the difficulties encountered by numerical models in reproducing the observed properties of local group satellite galaxies within the cold dark matter paradigm .",
    "these models often assume dark matter to be made up by thermal relic wdm with masses in the range 0.5 - 2 kev ( e.g.  @xcite ) .    since our study in @xcite , the size of our high - quality , high - redshift qso absorption spectra sample , the quality and size ( in particular the dynamic range and resolution ) of our numerical simulations and our knowledge of the thermal and ionization state of the igm at the relevant redshifts",
    "have all significantly improved .",
    "motivated by these improvements , and in light of the lively debate of dark matter possibly being warm with masses in the range 0.5 - 2 kev , we present here a new and much more extensive study of the high - redshift lyman-@xmath0  forest constraints on the free - streaming properties of dark matter .",
    "the new study is based on an improved data set , further refined modeling of the flux power spectrum and a large suite of new numerical hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "we also perform a comprehensive investigation of the the systematic uncertainties related to this measurement .",
    "finally , it is worth highlighting that wdm would have profound implications in many astrophysical and cosmological contexts . in this respect ,",
    "igm constraints are highly complementary to other probes based , for example , on the properties of dark matter haloes @xcite , the number of satellites and their luminosities @xcite , strong lensing , the velocity function in the local environment @xcite , phase - space density constraints @xcite , the formation of the first stars @xcite , the high - redshift quasar luminosity function @xcite , decays of wdm particles in the high redshift universe @xcite , reionization @xcite , gamma ray - bursts @xcite , galaxy formation aspects @xcite using n - body / hydrodynamical simulations @xcite or analytical / semi - analytical methods @xcite .    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ data ]",
    "we present our new data set .",
    "the simulations are described in section [ sims ] .",
    "the mock quasar sample , which will be important for estimating error amplitude and covariance , is introduced in section [ mock ] .",
    "section [ fluxpower ] discusses the effect of the most important physical parameters on the flux power spectrum , while most of the remaining nuisance parameters and the impact they have in terms of flux power are discussed in an appendix .",
    "our main results are reported in section [ method ] , together with a description of the monte carlo sampling of the likelihood space .",
    "we summarize our findings and conclude in section [ conclu ] .",
    "our analysis is based on high - resolution spectra of 25 quasars with emission redshifts @xmath29 . compared to our previous analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite the number of qso spectra , at these redshifts , has improved by nearly a factor two .",
    "spectra for fourteen of the objects were taken with the keck high resolution echelle spectrometer ( hires ) @xcite , and the remaining eleven were taken with the magellan inamori kyocera echelle ( mike ) spectrograph on the magellan clay telescope @xcite . most of the data have been presented elsewhere @xcite . here",
    "we briefly review the relevant features of the spectra , and describe how the flux power spectra were calculated .",
    "the majority of spectra were reduced using a custom set of idl routines based on optimal sky subtraction @xcite and optimal extraction @xcite techniques , while a small subset of the hires spectra ( pss  0248@xmath301802 and br  1202@xmath310725 ) were reduced using the makee software package . the hires and mike spectra have spectral resolutions of 6.7 and 13.6  kms@xmath32 ( fwhm ) , and the spectra were extracted using 2.1 and 5.0  kms@xmath32 spectral bins , respectively .",
    "the one - dimensional relative flux - calibrated spectra were then continuum normalized using spline fits based on power - law extrapolations of the continuum redward of the lyman-@xmath0  emission line .",
    "median continuum signal - to - noise ratios within the lyman-@xmath0  forest of each object are typically in the range of @xmath33 per pixel .",
    "the continuum estimates are necessarily crude due to the high levels of absorption in the lyman-@xmath0  forest at these redshifts .",
    "we estimate that typical uncertainties in the continuum are of the oder @xmath1410 - 20% , a point we return to in the power spectrum analysis",
    ".    to compute the flux power spectra , we first divided the lyman-@xmath0  forest in each quasar spectrum into two regions of equal redshift length .",
    "we then computed the power spectrum of the fractional transmission , @xmath34 , in each region separately , where @xmath35 here , @xmath36 is the mean transmitted flux calculated at the mean redshift of each region .",
    "we used fixed relations for the mean flux given by @xmath37}$ ] , where @xmath38 the fit to @xmath39 at @xmath40 is from @xcite , while the evolution at @xmath41 is based on a fit to the mean flux measured from the data presented here .",
    "the latter is similar to the trend in @xmath42 presented by @xcite .",
    "we note that our analysis is not sensitive to our choice of using a fixed relation for @xmath36 . in tests where we instead divided each region by the mean flux in that region alone we obtained very similar power spectrum estimates on average . when calculating the flux power spectrum we do not attempt to mask metal lines ( see discussion below ) .",
    "we do , however , mask regions of strong telluric absorption ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47   ) .",
    "the longest - wavelength mask effectively means that we probe up to a maximum redshift of 5.684 .",
    "the power spectra for individual regions were averaged over ten logarithmic wavenumber bins in the range @xmath48 $ ] with 0.2 dex spacing .",
    "the power spectra from all regions were then further averaged according to instrument and the mean redshift in each region .",
    "we used median redshifts @xmath49 for a nominal total of eight combined power spectra and 80 data points . in order to be conservative",
    ", however , we decided to use a subset of this sample and do not consider the highest redshfit bin for the mike data set ( which has very large error bars ) or the flux power measurements at @xmath50 , which might be affected by continuum fitting uncertainties .",
    "the final data set used in the present analysis thus consists of 49 data points .",
    "preliminary estimates of the error in the power spectra were calculated using a bootstrap approach .",
    "it is known , however , that bootstrapping typical underestimates the true errors ( e.g. @xcite ) . to be conservative , we therefore decided to add an additional 30% uncertainty to our estimates of the errors of the observed flux power spectrum for our standard analysis .",
    "we will also quote the tighter limits that would be obtained without this increase of the error estimate . as a further check",
    ", we used the set of mock qso spectra described in section [ mock ] to determine what the expected covariance in the power spectra should be ( within the limits of our finite simulation box ) at each redshift for a sample of similar size and quality to the one used here .",
    "these estimate were used to correct a few error estimates in the real data that appeared to be too small . with these corrections ,",
    "the final flux power spectra used here have error bars that are larger than @xmath51 .",
    "we model the flux power spectrum based on a set of hydrodynamical simulations performed with a modification of the publicly available code .",
    "this code implements a simplified star formation criterion @xcite that turns all gas particles that have an overdensity above 1000 and a temperature below @xmath52 k into star particles .",
    "this has been first used and extensively tested in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the reference model , hereafter referred to as @xmath53 , is a box of length 20 @xmath54 comoving mpc with @xmath55 gas and cold dm particles ( with a gravitational softening length of 1.3 @xmath54 kpc ) in a flat @xmath8cdm universe with cosmological parameters @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , in agreement both with wmap-9yr and planck data @xcite .",
    "we further explore three different wdm models with masses @xmath60 kev ; these models correspond to 50% suppression of power in the linear ( redshift independent ) matter power spectrum at scales @xmath61/mpc , respectively .",
    "the initial condition power spectra are generated with camb@xcite and the suppression and velocity for the wdm particles are implemented using the approach outlined in ref .",
    "in order to assess convergence and evaluate resolution corrections ( which are model dependent ) , we also perform four additional @xmath62 models , one each for the reference and wdm cases , and a single @xmath63 model for the 2 kev simulation only .",
    "we also have performed three @xmath64 simulations for @xmath8cdm , wdm 1 kev and wdm 2 kev in order to check the flux power spectrum convergence at the largest scales of our smaller boxes .",
    "we explore the impact of different thermal histories on the lyman-@xmath0  forest by modifying the ultra violet ( uv ) background photo - heating rate in the simulations ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "a power - law temperature - density relation , @xmath65 , arises in the low density igm ( @xmath66 ) as a natural consequence of the interplay between photo - heating and adiabatic cooling @xcite .",
    "we consider a range of values for the temperature at mean density , @xmath67 , and the power - law index of the temperature - density relation , @xmath68 , based on the observational measurements presented recently by ref .",
    "these consist of a set of 3 different indices for the temperature - density relation , @xmath69 , that are kept approximately constant over the redshift range @xmath70 $ ] and 3 different temperatures at mean density , @xmath71k , which evolve with redshift , yielding a total of 9 different thermal histories .",
    "the reference thermal history assumes @xmath72 .",
    "these 9 thermal histories have been performed for all the 3 wdm models and for the reference @xmath8cdm case , resulting in a total of 36 simulations .",

    "lastly , we note that the physical properties of the lyman-@xmath0  forest obtained from the treepm / sph code gadget - ii are in very good agreement at the percent level with those inferred from the moving - mesh code arepo @xcite and with the eulerian code enzo @xcite .",

    "the procedure used to create the mock spectra can be summarized as follows : @xmath87 we consider the total redshift path in each redshift bin and combine the short simulated spectra ( @xmath88 mpc@xmath89 in length ) to match the total length of an observed qso spectrum ( approximately 40 spectra are used ) ; @xmath90 we allow for an optical depth evolution along the los ( which is absent since our simulated spectra are from snapshots at fixed redshifts ) following the scaling expected from the fluctuating gunn - peterson approximation , @xmath91 ( see e.g. @xcite ) ; @xmath92 for each short simulated spectrum we consider a @xmath93 20% error on the quasar continuum placement ( the continuum is drawn randomly from a gaussian distribution around the value 1 with a @xmath94 ) ; @xmath95 we smooth the flux with a gaussian at a given fwhm corresponding to the spectrograph resolution and rebin the spectra with the observed pixel - size ; @xmath96 we add gaussian - distributed noise on top of the flux , matching the signal - to - noise of the observational data .",
    "we demonstrate in the appendix that the ( instrumental ) effects of noise and finite resolution , which are scale and redshift dependent , are below 20% ( 6% ) at the smallest scales for mike ( hires ) .",

    "there are only 5 data points that appear to have error bars that are smaller than those obtained from the mock sample : 4 data points from the mike sample ( @xmath97(s / km)@xmath98 at @xmath99 , @xmath97(s / km)@xmath100 at @xmath101 , @xmath97(s / km)@xmath102 at @xmath103 ) and one data point from the hires sample ( @xmath104 at @xmath99 ) . as the observed sample is still small and",
    "it is thus expected that the bootstrap errors estimated from the data could be unrealistically small , for these data points we increase the error bars to match those obtained from a mock sample of 30 qsos in the same redshift bin .",
    "these mock data points , with the extra 30% error added , otherwise agree well with those of the observational data , giving us confidence that this is reasonable .",
    "finally , we note that the hydrodynamical simulations used to construct our mock lyman-@xmath0  forest spectra do not incorporate chemical elements other than hydrogen and helium .",
    "we have therefore estimated how unidentified , lower redshift metal lines in the lyman-@xmath0  forest may bias our result , and in particular how these narrow absorption lines may alter the flux power spectrum at small scales .",
    "furthermore , the simulations also assume a spatially uniform uv background .",
    "we therefore also estimate the impact of spatial fluctuations in the uv background on the lyman-@xmath0  forest at @xmath99@xmath105 . we follow a modified version of the approach described in ref .",

    "the suppression of the flux power is larger than that seen in the matter power spectrum .",
    "this is due to the fact that the 1d matter power spectrum is an integral of the 3d power spectrum and therefore very sensitive to the small scale cut - off .",

    "the key difference in this work is that we compute the spatially varying photo - ionisation rate along our simulated sight - lines .",

    "we therefore ignore the significant contribution to the uv background from the more numerous , fainter star - forming galaxies at these redshifts , which effectively smooth out the large - scale fluctuations produced by the rarer quasars .",
    "the spatially fluctuating photo - ionisation rates are then obtained by integrating the specific intensity with respect to frequency , weighted by the photo - ionisation cross - section .    in figure [ fig_hh ]",
    "we show the effect that uv fluctuations and metal contamination have on the flux power spectrum . in the wavenumber range considered here ,",
    "the uv background fluctuations have an effect at around the 10% level at the largest scales , dropping to 5% at smallest scales considered in this work . the effect is larger at high redshift ( z=5,5.4 ) than in the two other redshift bins .",

    "we demonstrate the effect that a different mean flux level has on the flux power spectrum .",
    "we choose two different mean flux levels with @xmath84 20% higher and lower than the reference value ( which corresponds to the observed mean flux ) . a higher ( lower ) value for @xmath39 will result in more ( less ) power relative to the reference value .",
