    "multiuser multiple - input multiple - output ( mu - mimo ) antenna system has been recognized as an effective means to increase capacity in the downlink @xcite . however , mu - mimo may not be as effective if edge - of - cell users are concerned due to the severe inter - cell interference that is hard to suppress . in recent years",
    ", it has emerged that letting base stations ( bs ) cooperate can greatly improve the link quality of the edge - of - cell users by turning unwanted interference into useful signal energy , e.g. , @xcite ( and the references therein ) .",
    "ideally , by sharing all the required information via high - speed backhaul links , all bss in a downlink cellular network can become a super bs with distributed sets of antennas .",
    "this architecture will then allow the use of well - known optimal or suboptimal transmission strategies such as capacity - achieving dirty - paper coding ( dpc ) techniques @xcite and zero - forcing beamforming ( zfbf ) @xcite , respectively .",
    "although dpc is capacity - achieving , it is very complex and massive interest has been to employ zfbf with a simple scheduler to approach near - capacity performance @xcite . for example , several testbeds for implementing bs cooperation have adopted zfbf techniques , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "regularized zfbf ( rzfbf ) is a generalization of zfbf by introducing the regularization parameter @xcite .",
    "it has been revealed that several beamformers can have a rzfbf structure by selecting the regularization parameter properly @xcite . even though information - theoretic studies have provided overwhelming support to rzfbf @xcite ,",
    "the real question is how could rzfbf be implemented in a very large - scale cellular network ?    a straightforward way to implement rzfbf would be to require that there is a central processing unit which possesses all the necessary channel state information ( csi ) and performs the entire optimization .",
    "however , as a network expands with more bss cooperating , it becomes inviable to perform joint processing over all bss because of the limiting backhaul capacity and the excessive computational complexity .",
    "it is therefore of greater interest to consider an architecture where bss only communicate with neighboring bss and the overall computation cost is decomposed into many smaller computational tasks , amortized by groups of smaller number of cooperating bss .",
    "motivated by this , in this paper , we propose two message passing algorithms to realize rzfbf in a distributed manner .",
    "the proposed approaches are particularly well suited to cooperation of large clusters of simple and loosely connected bss .",
    "most importantly , in our designs , each bs is only required to know the data symbols of users within its reception range rather the entire cellular network , greatly reducing the backhaul requirements .",
    "the use of distributed methods in beamforming computations has been studied recently in @xcite .",
    "our approach is similar to @xcite in that both aim at achieving rzfbf and use belief propagation ( bp ) .",
    "nonetheless , the two approaches differ considerably .",
    "our main contributions are summarized as follows :    * first , we generalize the earlier results in @xcite to incorporate",
    "_ multiple antennas _ at both bss and user equipments ( ues ) and our results can be applied to a wide range of scenarios with _ complex - valued systems_. further , we adopt the approximate message passing ( amp ) method in @xcite to significantly reduce the number of exchange messages .",
    "the proposed amp - rzfbf exhibits the advantage that every communication of bs with its neighbors only takes place in a broadcast fashion as opposed to the unicast manner in @xcite .",
    "the used amp method has recently received considerable interest in the field of compressed sensing @xcite .",
    "our form of the message passing algorithm is closely related to the amp methods in @xcite which are a special case of the generalized amp @xcite . * in amp - rzfbf , bss must compute several matrix inversions for every channel realization and then exchange these auxiliary parameters among themselves , requiring very high computational capability and rapid information exchange between the bss . to tackle this ,",
    "we approximate some of the auxiliary parameters by exploiting the spatial channel covariance information ( ccoi ) . the ccoi - aided amp - rzfbf results in significantly simpler implementations in terms of computation and communication .",
    "with the ccoi - aided amp - rzfbf , the bss compute and exchange the auxiliary parameters at the time scale merely at which the ccoi changes but not the instantaneous csi .",
    "simulation results show that ccoi - aided amp - rzfbf achieves promising results , which are different from earlier results based on the ccoi , e.g. , @xcite , where a performance degeneration is usually expected . * implementing rzfbf in a distributed manner can be achieved by an optimization technique called the alternating direction method of multipliers ( admm ) approach in @xcite .",
    "applications of admm to the concerned beamforming problem can be found in @xcite ( or ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 8.3 ) ) .",
    "however , it is known that admm can be very slow to converge .",
    "simulation results will demonstrate that our proposed message passing algorithms exhibit a much faster convergence rate when compared to admm .    _",

    "we have defined @xmath39 as the vector of the transmitted signal and @xmath40 as the overall downlink channel matrix . although ( [ eq : defsystem ] ) appears to look like an @xmath41 mimo system , this is fundamentally different from a point - to - point mimo channel . to see the differences , we emphasize the following two features .",
    "first , note that @xmath42 may have many zero block matrices because one ue is only able to receive signals from local bss .",
    "the characteristic can be easily described via a graphical model as shown in figure [ fig : mimonetwork ] .",
    "for ease of expression , let @xmath43 comprise the set of user indices such that @xmath27 has some inference on these ues ; i.e. , @xmath44 for @xmath45 .",
    "similarly , let @xmath46 be a set of bs indices such that these bss have some inference on @xmath25 ; i.e. , @xmath47 for @xmath48 . the local coupling is an important feature that communication should only be required between a subset of bss rather than among all bss .",
    "secondly , since both bs and ue are equipped with multiple antennas , the spatial correlation of the mimo channel for each link between a bs and a ue should be considered . in this paper",
    ", we employ the kronecker model to characterize the spatial correlation of the mimo channel for each link so that the correlation at a bs and a ue is modeled separately @xcite .",
    "specifically , the channel from @xmath27 to @xmath25 , @xmath49 , can be written as @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are deterministic nonnegative definite matrices , which characterize the spatial correlation of the received signals across the antenna elements of @xmath25 and that of the transmitted signals across the antenna elements of @xmath27 respectively , and @xmath53 \\in\\mathbb{c}^{m_k \\times n_l}$ ] consists of the random components of the channel in which the elements @xmath54 are i.i.d .",
    "complex gaussian random variables with zero mean and unit variance . to get a proper definition on the channel gain of each link pair ,",
    "we consider the power of the channel @xmath55 if we assume that @xmath56 and @xmath57 are normalized such that @xmath58 and @xmath59 , then @xmath60 can be used as an indicator for the link gain between @xmath27 and @xmath25 . or @xmath57 . ]    in the broadcast system ( [ eq : defsystem ] ) , linear precoding , referred to as rzfbf , is used to project the data symbols onto a subspace using the @xmath61 transmit antennas .",
    "let @xmath62^t$ ] be the vector of data symbols , where @xmath63 corresponds to the data symbols intended for @xmath25 . in rzfbf ,",
    "the signal vector transmitted by the bss , denoted by @xmath64 , is given by @xcite @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the normalization parameter to ensure that the transmit power constraint is met , i.e. , @xmath67 for @xmath68 .",
    "note that rzfbf can be regarded as a generalization of other beamformers by adjusting the regularization parameter @xmath69 .",
    "for instance , if @xmath70 , it reduces to zfbf whereas if @xmath71 , it will give the matched - filter beamforming .",
    "several other beamformers can also have a rzfbf structure by designing the regularization parameter appropriately @xcite .",
    "however , to obtain ( [ eq : wprecoder ] ) , all the bss must cooperate to jointly process the data symbols from all the users in the network , requiring _ global _ csi .",
    "if @xmath61 and @xmath72 are very large ( which they should in order to benefit from the gains of mu - mimo and bs cooperation ) , the centralized approach will become prohibitively complex .",
    "therefore , in the next section , we propose message passing algorithms that can realize rzfbf in a distributed manner .",
    "now , we are concerning with the problem of distributing the computation of ( [ eq : wprecoder ] ) among the bss . toward this end",
    ", we first use the _ virtual _ model concept of @xcite , which recasts the rzfbf optimization problem into an estimation problem which is described as follows .    consider the virtual model @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the gaussian random vector with zero mean and the covariance matrix @xmath75 . recall that @xmath76 is the data symbol vector for all the users and @xmath64 is the signal transmitted by the bss .",
    "the virtual model implies that the transmitted signal @xmath64 goes through the channel @xmath42 and is then observed by @xmath77 at the ue sides .",
    "what is important here is that the virtual model allows us to process the beamforming problem through a probabilistic inference approach .",
    "specifically , we adopt a bayesian approach .    the bayes optimal way of estimating @xmath64 that minimizes the mean square error is given by @xcite @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the posterior probability of @xmath64 given observation of @xmath76 .",
    "following bayes theorem , we have @xmath80 where the conditional distribution of @xmath76 given @xmath64 under ( [ eq : auxchannel ] ) is given by @xmath81 if we assume that @xmath64 is taken from the standard complex gaussian random vector and its density is given by @xmath82 , then the posterior distribution @xmath79 admits an explicit expression as @xmath83 henceforth , we shall use @xmath84 to denote a _ universal _",
    "normalization factor whose value may vary from one appearance to another . plugging ( [ eq : postpro ] ) into ( [ eq : estx ] ) and applying the gaussian integral ( lemma [ lemma 1 ] in appendix b ) , one can get that the solution of ( [ eq : estx ] ) is exactly identical to the form of ( [ eq : wprecoder ] ) without the power normalization parameter .",
    "next , we shall use an approach called bp ( belief - propagation ) for computing ( [ eq : estx ] ) .",
    "we begin by applying the standard bp algorithm @xcite to perform ( [ eq : estx ] ) . as a matter of fact ,",
    "bp can be regarded as a graphical method to estimate the marginal distributions of the distribution @xmath79 with respect to the variables @xmath33 . to this end",
    ", we reformulate the problem as a bipartite graph called the factor graph . the corresponding factor graph is depicted in figure [ fig : mimonetwork ] where a circle represents a variable node associated with the transmit beamforming vector ; i.e. , @xmath33 for @xmath27 , whereas a square indicates a factor node associated with the sub - constraint function ; i.e. , @xmath85 for @xmath25 .",
    "there is an edge between a variable node @xmath34 and a function node @xmath36 if and only if @xmath86 .",
    "to estimate the marginal distributions , bp performs a set of message passing equations that go from factor nodes to variable nodes ( i.e. , @xmath87 ) and from variable nodes to factor nodes ( i.e. , @xmath88 ) as is illustrated in figure [ fig : mimonetwork ] .",
    "the message @xmath89 from the factor node @xmath36 to the variable node @xmath34 is the marginal probability of the variable @xmath33 when only the sub - constraint @xmath36 is present . on the other hand ,",
    "the message @xmath90 from the variable node @xmath34 to the factor node @xmath36 is the marginal probability of the variables @xmath33 in the absence of the sub - constraint @xmath36 .",
    "specifically , in order to estimate these marginal distributions @xmath91 with bp algorithm , @xmath92 messages for the probability distributions of the variables @xmath33 are constructed in the following way @xcite :    [ eq : standard_bp ] @xmath93    where @xmath94 represents the iteration index and @xmath95 and @xmath96 are the normalization factors ensuring that @xmath97 . at the termination of the message passing algorithm ,",
    "say at iteration @xmath98 , the final estimate of @xmath33 is given by @xmath99 where @xmath100 .",
    "the rzfbf solution can thus be realized in a distributed manner via the message passing procedures .",
    "however , the messages are _ density functions _ which are usually too complex to be exchanged and will cost a huge burden in the backhaul in our application of bs cooperation .    to overcome this , the message can be approximated by gaussian and parameterized by the mean and covariance . instead of passing the density functions , we thus have the mean and covariance as the messages : @xmath101 where @xmath102 denotes the average or expectation of a function @xmath103 over the random vector @xmath33 with distribution @xmath104 .",
    "mathematically , that is @xmath105 the gaussian approximation method was introduced in @xcite when the message is scalar and the concerned matrix is sparse . in our case , we follow the techniques in @xcite by considering that the block matrix @xmath106 scales as @xmath107 . as a consequence , we can approximate @xmath108 by @xmath109 where @xmath110 notice that @xmath111 and @xmath112 in ( [ eq : edef])([eq : fdef ] ) are functions of @xmath113 which is also altered due to the approximation @xmath114 . to make the connection , from ( [ eq : appqkl ] ) and ( [ eq : qlk ] ) , we have @xmath115",
    "henceforth , we will replace @xmath116 and @xmath117 in ( [ eq : edef])([eq : fdef ] ) by @xmath118 and @xmath119 which are , respectively , the mean and covariance over the probability distribution @xmath120 .",
    "also , in the sequel , we will no longer use the probability distribution @xmath121 .",
    "however , for notational convenience , we will abuse our notation slightly and still use @xmath116 and @xmath122 to denote those mean and covariance over the probability distribution @xmath120 .",
    "recall that @xmath33 is taken from the standard complex gaussian random vector . by applying the gaussian integral ( lemma [ lemma 1 ] in appendix b ) , @xmath123 and @xmath124 with the distribution @xmath125 in ( [ eq : tqlk ] ) can be computed analytically .",
    "these lead to the following closed form of the bp update :    [ eq : bpupdate ] @xmath126    where @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "the number of messages is still @xmath129 .",
    "however , the message update here is only on the mean and covariance rather than the functional update in ( [ eq : standard_bp ] ) . at the termination of the bp , the final estimation of @xmath130",
    "is given by @xmath131 where @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "we refer to this algorithm as bp - rzfbf although a variant of bp is adopted here .",

    "bp - rzfbf is a generalization of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( 27)(28 ) ) in which @xmath106 s are scalars ( real numbers ) .",
    "clearly , this generalization can be applied to a wide range of scenarios with complex - valued systems .",
    "additionally , it performs block matrix computations resulting in a natural partition of bss .      in bp - rzfbf , each bs has to send separate messages with respect to @xmath36 ; i.e. , @xmath116 and @xmath135 .",
    "we can reduce the messaging overhead to @xmath136 . to do so",
    ", we note that the messages @xmath116 and @xmath137 are functions of @xmath138 and @xmath139 which are nearly independent of @xmath36 .",
    "however , one must keep all the correction terms that are linear in @xmath140 .",
    "this methodology was first introduced in compressed sensing applications in @xcite and is referred to as amp . using amp in the bf - rzfbf problem ,",
    "we have developed the amp - rzfbf algorithm in algorithm [ ago : agoamp ] .",
    "for readability , we give the detailed derivation in appendix a.    [ ago : agoamp ]    now , we turn our attention to realizing amp - rzfbf for the cooperative system . in general",
    ", each iteration requires a broadcast and gathering operation .",
    "we assume that each bs has local data information and csi ; e.g. , only @xmath141 for @xmath142 are known at @xmath27 .",
    "the first two steps of amp - rzfbf consist of performing @xmath143 and @xmath144 updates at @xmath27 . notice that for @xmath27 , @xmath143 and @xmath144 updates are only for indices @xmath142 which correspond to the user indices within its reception range . in order to update @xmath143 and @xmath144 , @xmath27",
    "must gather @xmath145 and @xmath146 from the set of its neighboring bss @xmath147 . after getting @xmath143 and @xmath144 ,",
    "@xmath27 is able to compute @xmath148 and then update @xmath149 subsequently .",
    "once @xmath149 are computed , @xmath27 will broadcast @xmath150 and @xmath151 to its neighboring bss .",
    "the algorithm continues to repeat the procedures above until it reaches a predefined number of iterations .    in amp - rzfbf ,",
    "the computation of @xmath152 and @xmath153 involves several matrix inversions for every channel realization . these demand high computational cost and rapid information exchange between the bss . to remedy this",
    ", we propose to infer these parameters based on ccoi which varies much slower than csi .",
    "starting from the initial condition , we approximate @xmath154 by its average with respect to different realization of the measurement matrix @xmath106 : @xmath155 where the equality follows from lemma [ lemma 2 ] in appendix b. the approximation is benefited by the self - averaging property in statistical physics ; that is , a quantity per degree of freedom has small deviations from its mean .",
    "in fact , using techniques from random matrix theory , e.g. , @xcite , one can show that as @xmath156 , @xmath157 almost surely .",

    "results showed that the proposed algorithms converge very fast to the exact rzfbf . comparing to bp - rzfbf , both amp - rzfbf and ccoi - aided amp - rzfbf perform well with only very slight degradation in the convergence rate , but greatly reducing the burden for information exchange between the bss .",
    "to derive amp - rzfbf , we use a heuristic approximation which keeps all the terms that are linear in the matrix @xmath140 while neglecting the higher - order terms .",
    "the similar methodology was used in @xcite in the case of compressed sensing although some modifications are required to reflect the concerned case .",
    "we start by noticing that @xmath204 is the sum of @xmath23 terms each of order @xmath205 because @xmath206 scales as @xmath107 .",
    "therefore , it is natural to approximate @xmath138 by @xmath207 which only depends on the index @xmath34 and not on @xmath36 . similarly , it is natural to anticipate a similar approximation for @xmath139 .",
    "however , we must be careful to keep all correction terms of order @xmath208 . to that end",
    ", we instead set @xmath209 recall from ( [ eq : bpupdate ] ) that @xmath210 .",
    "then we get @xmath211 we will approximate the above two terms by dropping their negligible components . before proceeding",
    ", we deal with the approximation of @xmath212 .",
    "let us define @xmath213 .",
    "then we have @xmath214 where the approximation follows from the fact that @xmath215 is of order @xmath205 and can be safely neglected .",
    "similarly , we note that @xmath216 is nearly independent of @xmath36 .",
    "this leads to @xmath217 then we get @xmath218    now , we return to the approximation of @xmath116 .",
    "first , we deal with the second terms of ( [ eq : xx1 ] ) and get @xmath219 \\\\   & \\approx { { \\bf x}}_l^{(t ) } -   \\left({{\\boldsymbol \\sigma}}_{l}^{(t ) } + { { \\bf i}}_{n_l } \\right)^{-1 } { { \\bf h}}_{k , l}^h \\left ( { { \\boldsymbol \\omega}}_k^{(t ) } + \\beta { { \\bf i}}_{m_k } \\right)^{-1 } { { \\boldsymbol \\nu}}_k^{(t)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the first approximation is directly from ( [ eq : xx1 ] ) by substituting the definition of @xmath220 and we have defined @xmath221 . substituting the above approximation of @xmath116 in @xmath144 , we get @xmath222 where the second equality follows from ( [ eq : omega_fin ] ) .",
    "now , it remains to complete the calculation of @xmath223 .",
    "we start from the definition @xmath224^{-1 } \\left({\\overline{\\bf e}}_{l}^{(t ) } \\right)^{-1 } { \\overline{\\bf f}}_{l}^{(t ) }      = \\left [ \\left({\\overline{\\bf e}}_{l}^{(t ) } \\right)^{-1 } + { { \\bf i}}_{n_l } \\right]^{-1 } { { \\boldsymbol \\mu}}_l^{(t)},\\ ] ] where we have defined @xmath225 following the similar approximations as above , we get @xmath226^{-1 } \\nonumber \\\\     & \\times      \\left [ \\sum_{k } { { \\bf h}}_{k , l}^h \\left ( { { \\boldsymbol \\omega}}_k^{(t ) } - { { \\bf h}}_{k , l } { { \\bf v}}_{l \\rightarrow k}^{(t-1 ) } { { \\bf h}}_{k , l}^h + \\beta { { \\bf i}}_{m_k } \\right)^{-1 }      \\left ( { { \\boldsymbol \\nu}}_k^{(t ) } + { { \\bf h}}_{k , l } { { \\bf x}}_{l \\rightarrow k}^{(t-1 ) } \\right ) \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\approx &   ~{{\\bf x}}_{l}^{(t-1 ) }     + \\left({{\\boldsymbol \\sigma}}_{l}^{(t)}\\right)^{-1 }     \\left [ \\sum_{k } { { \\bf h}}_{k , l}^h \\left ( { { \\boldsymbol \\omega}}_k^{(t ) } + \\beta { { \\bf i}}_{m_k } \\right)^{-1 } { { \\boldsymbol \\nu}}_k^{(t ) }   \\right ] \\label{eq : mu_final_app}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and then @xmath227    putting the above relations ( [ eq : sigma_final_ap ] ) , ( [ eq : omega_fin ] ) , ( [ eq : nu_final_ap ] ) , ( [ eq : mu_final_app ] ) and ( [ eq : x_final_app ] ) together , we get amp - rzfbf .",
    "for convenience , we provide some mathematical tools needed in this paper .      [ lemma 2 ] a random matrix @xmath230",
    "is said to have a matrix variate complex gaussian distribution with mean @xmath231 and covariance matrix @xmath232 , if it can be written by @xmath233 , where @xmath234 and @xmath235 are both positive definite and the elements of @xmath236 are i.i.d .",
