    "a basic assumption underlying many evolutionary and economic game theoretical models is that individuals are the same except for possible differences in the strategy that they select .",
    "in fact , a population of individuals involved in ecological or social interaction is considered to be heterogeneous .",
    "for example , different individuals may have different fighting abilities or endowments @xcite , occupy different positions in contact networks specifying the peers with whom the game is played @xcite , or have different preferences over the objective outcome of the game .",
    "the last situation is succinctly represented by the battle of the sexes game in which a wife and husband prefer to go to watch opera and football , respectively , whereas their stronger priority is on going out together @xcite ( the battle of the sexes game here is different from the one that models conflicts between males and females concerning parental investment as described in @xcite ) . in behavioral game experiments ,",
    "the heterogeneity of subjects is rather a norm than exceptions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for example , some humans are cooperative in the public goods game and others are not ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and some punish non - cooperators more than others do @xcite",
    ".    evolution of strategies in such a heterogeneous population is the focus of the present paper .",
    "this question has been examined along several lines .    first , in theory of preference , it is assumed that individuals maximize their own idiosyncratic utilities that vary between individuals .",
    "the utility generally deviates from the fitness on which evolutionary pressure operates ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , experimental evidence shows that individuals tend to imitate behavior of similar others in the context of diffusion of innovations @xcite and health behavior @xcite .",
    "also in the context of economic behavior described as games , individuals may preferentially imitate similar others because similar individuals are expected to be interested in maximizing similar objective functions .",
    "this type of behavior is not considered in previous preference models in which individuals can instantaneously maximize their own payoffs , and selection occurs on the basis of the fitness function common to the entire population .",
    "the model proposed in this study deals with evolutionary dynamics in which individuals in a heterogeneous population mimic successful and similar others .",
    "the similarity here refers to that in the idiosyncratic preference .",
    "second , evolution in heterogeneous populations has been investigated with the use of the evolutionary bimatrix game @xcite .",
    "a payoff bimatrix describes the payoff imparted to the two players in generally asymmetric roles . in its evolutionary dynamics",
    ", a population is divided into two subpopulations , pairs of individuals selected from the different subpopulations play the game , and selection occurs within each subpopulation .",
    "the population then has bipartite structure induced by the fixed role of individuals .",
    "however , the most generic population structure for investigating interplay of evolution via social learning and idiosyncratic preferences would be a well - mixed population without fixed roles of individuals .",
    "third , evolutionary game dynamics on heterogeneous social networks @xcite is related to evolution in heterogeneous populations . in most of the studies on this topic ,",
    "the payoff to an individual per generation is defined as the obtained payoff summed over all the neighboring individuals .",
    "then , cooperation in social dilemma games is enhanced on heterogeneous networks @xcite . in this framework , hubs ( i.e. , those with many neighbors ) and non - hubs are likely to gain different payoffs mainly because of their positions in the contact network . in particular ,",
    "if the payoff of a single game is assumed to be nonnegative , hubs tend to earn more than non - hubs simply because hubs have more neighbors than non - hubs by definition @xcite .",
    "however , as long as the contact network is fixed , a non - hub player will not gain a large payoff by imitating the strategy of a successful hub neighbor .",
    "the number of neighbors serves as the resource of a player .",
    "then , it may be more natural to assume that players imitate successful others with a similar number of neighbors .    motivated by these examples ,",
    "i examine evolutionary dynamics in which a player would imitate successful others having similar preferences or inhabiting similar environments .",
    "i divide the players into two subpopulations depending on the subjective perception of the result of the game ; one may like a certain outcome of the game , and another may not like the same outcome .",
    "imitation is assumed to occur within each subpopulation .",
    "however , the interaction occurs as a well - mixed population .",
    "i also assume that all the individuals have the same ability , i.e. , no player is more likely to `` win '' the game than others .",
    "consider a population comprising two subpopulations of players such that the payoff matrix depends on the subpopulation .",
    "the payoff is equivalent to the fitness in the present model .",
    "i call the game the subjective payoff game .",
    "each player , independent of the subpopulation , selects either of the two strategies denoted by @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the case with a general number of strategies can be analogously formulated . the subjective payoff game and its replicator dynamics described in the following are a special case of the multipopulation game proposed before @xcite ( for slightly different variants , see @xcite ) .    the population is infinite , well - mixed , and consists of a fraction @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) of type @xmath4 players and a fraction @xmath5 of type @xmath6 players .",
    "the subjective payoff matrices that an @xmath4 player and a @xmath6 player perceive as row player are defined by @xmath7 respectively .",
    "it should be noted that the payoff that an @xmath4 player , for example , perceives depends on the opponent s strategy ( i.e. , @xmath0 or @xmath1 ) but not on the opponent s type ( i.e. , @xmath4 or @xmath6 ) .",
    "the use of the two payoff matrices represents different idiosyncrasies in preferences in the two subpopulations .",
    "alternatively , the payoff matrix differs by subpopulations because @xmath4 and @xmath6 players have different tendencies to transform the result of the one - shot game ( i.e. , one of the four consequences composed of a pair of @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) into the fitness .",
    "for example , @xmath4 and @xmath6 players may benefit the most from mutual @xmath0 and mutual @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the fractions of @xmath4 and @xmath6 players that select strategy @xmath0 are denoted by @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "the fractions of @xmath4 and @xmath6 players that select strategy @xmath1 are equal to @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "the payoffs to an @xmath4 player with strategies @xmath0 and @xmath1 are given by @xmath12+b_x\\left[p(1-x)+(1-p)(1-y)\\right ] \\label{eq : pi_xa}\\ ] ] and @xmath13+d_x\\left[p(1-x)+(1-p)(1-y)\\right ] , \\label{eq : pi_xb}\\ ] ] respectively .",
    "the payoff to a @xmath6 player is defined with @xmath4 replaced by @xmath6 in eqs .   and .",
    "i assume that in the evolutionary dynamics , the players can only copy the strategies of peers in the same subpopulation .",
    "this assumption reflects the premise that the payoff in the present model is subjective such that the only comparison that makes sense is that between the players in the same subpopulation .",
    "the replicator dynamics of the subjective payoff game is then defined by @xmath14\\notag\\\\ = & x(1-x)\\left\\{(a_x - c_x)\\left[px+(1-p)y\\right ] +    ( b_x - d_x)\\left[p(1-x)+(1-p)(1-y)\\right]\\right\\ } \\label{eq : dx / dt m=2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath15 +    ( b_y - d_y)\\left[p(1-x)+(1-p)(1-y)\\right]\\right\\ } , \\label{eq : dy / dt m=2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 and @xmath17 represent the time derivatives .",
    "if @xmath18 is an internal equilibrium ( i.e. , @xmath19 ) of the replicator dynamics given by eqs .   and , @xmath20 +    ( b_x - d_x)\\left[p(1-x)+(1-p)(1-y)\\right]=(a_y - c_y)\\left[px+(1-p)y\\right ] +    ( b_y - d_y)\\left[p(1-x)+(1-p)(1-y)\\right]=0 $ ] must be satisfied .",
    "however , this is impossible unless a degenerate condition @xmath21 is satisfied .",
    "therefore , for a generic pair of payoff matrices , the replicator dynamics does not have an internal equilibrium .",
    "three remarks are in order .",
    "first , the absence of internal equilibrium implies that the present dynamics does not allow limit cycles @xcite .",
    "second , the present result contrasts with that for a two - subpopulation dynamics in which the perceived payoff matrix depends on the opponent s subpopulation as well as on the focal player s subpopulation . in the latter case , an internal equilibrium or limit cycle can exist @xcite .",
    "third , the present conclusion is different from that for the bimatrix game . in the bimatrix game , each player in subpopulation @xmath4 exclusively interacts with each player in subpopulation @xmath6 .",
    "then , an internal equilibrium can exist , whereas , when it exists , it is either a saddle or a neutrally stable point surrounded by periodic orbits @xcite .",
    "the replicator dynamics without population structure , which is referred to as the ordinary replicator dynamics in the following , is invariant under some transformations of the payoff matrix .",
    "the dynamics given by eqs .   and is also invariant under some payoff transformations .",
    "first , trajectories of the ordinary replicator equation are invariant under the addition of a common constant to all the entries of the payoff matrix .",
    "similarly , replacing the payoff matrices given by eq .   by @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are arbitrary constants , does not alter the dynamics .",
    "second , trajectories of the ordinary replicator equation are invariant under multiplication of all the entries of the payoff matrix by a common positive constant .",
    "it only changes the time scale . in the present model , replacing eq .   by @xmath25 where @xmath26 , does not alter the dynamics .",
    "it should be noted that the multiplicative factor for the two payoff matrices has to be the same for the dynamics to be conserved .",
    "third , in the ordinary replicator equation , adding a common constant to any column of the payoff matrix does not alter a trajectory . in the present model , replacing eq .   by @xmath27",
    "does not alter the trajectory for arbitrary @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 .",
    "this invariance is a generalization of the first invariance .",
    "it is also equivalent to the invariance relationship found for a more general model @xcite .",
    "let us calculate the conditions for the combination of pure strategies in each subpopulation to be evolutionarily stable strategies ( esss ) .",
    "some definitions of ess for multipopulation games exist @xcite , and it seems that consensus on the definition of the ess in the case of multiple subpopulations has not been reached @xcite .",
    "here i adhere to the definition given in @xcite ( also see @xcite ) , which was proposed for general two - subpopulation games in which intra - subpopulation and inter - subpopulation interactions yield a different payoff to a focal player .",
    "i start with stating the definition of the ess by obeying @xcite .",
    "consider a general two - subpopulation matrix game such that there are @xmath32 and @xmath33 pure strategies in subpopulations @xmath4 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "a mixed strategy in @xmath4 and @xmath6 is parametrized as @xmath34 and @xmath35 , where @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) and @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) are the probabilities that the mixed strategy in @xmath4 and @xmath6 takes the @xmath40th strategy , respectively , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 denotes the transposition .",
    "consider a population of resident players taking strategies @xmath43 and @xmath44 in subpopulations @xmath4 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "i assume that the payoff to a player adopting mixed strategy @xmath45 in subpopulation @xmath4 embedded in this resident population is given by @xmath46 similarly , assume that the payoff to mixed strategy @xmath47 in subpopulation @xmath6 embedded in the same resident population is given by @xmath48 strategy @xmath49 is ess if for any @xmath50 , @xmath51 when the equality holds in eq .",
    ", it is also required that an additional condition given by @xmath52 is satisfied .",
    "in the case of the subjective payoff game , i obtain @xmath53 , @xmath54 @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58",

    "the replicator dynamics of the subjective payoff game is different from that of the bimatrix game ( section  [ sub : not bimatrix ] ) .",
    "in addition , the subjective payoff game can not be mapped to a model with strategy - dependent interaction rates , which does not have multiple subpopulations within each of which imitation occurs @xcite .",
    "the subjective payoff game is also different from those in which interaction is confined in single subpopulations , such as group selection models @xcite , island model @xcite , and evolutionary set theory @xcite .",
    "the present model is distinct from previous models of evolution of preference ( e.g. , @xcite ) and the so - called subjective game @xcite .",
    "both in these and present models , the preference , or the subjective payoff , is assumed to be consistent within each individual @xcite . in these previous models , the utility that a player maximizes and the fitness on which the selection pressure operates are different .",
    "a player in such a model is rational enough to be able to personally maximize the player s idiosyncratic utility . in the present model , as in standard evolutionary models , a player is subjected to bounded rationality and tends to imitate successful others ( i.e. , social learning ) .",
    "the difference from standard evolutionary models is that , in the present model , each player limits the set of possible parents from whom the strategy is copied to those with the same idiosyncratic payoff . in this way",
    ", the player can pursue both maximization of fitness via social learning and consistency with the player s idiosyncratic preference .",
    "the subjective payoff game does not allow internal equilibria regardless of the stability .",
    "this result has implications in games in which internal equilibria play an important role in structureless populations . in the snowdrift game , a mixture of the two strategies is stable under ordinary replicator dynamics .",
    "in contrast , in the subjective payoff game , a slight difference in the payoff matrices perceived by the two subpopulations leads to polarization such that the two subpopulations tend to select the opposite strategies .    the rock  scissors  paper game comprises three strategies that cyclically dominate one another .",
    "it is straightforward to show that there is no internal equilibrium in the subjective payoff game with a general number of strategies .",
    "therefore , the subjective payoff variant of the rock ",
    "scissors  paper game lacks the internal equilibrium of any kind and limit cycles .",
    "such a game behaves very differently from the same game played in the structureless population @xcite , bimatrix population @xcite , and two subpopulations with different social learning rates @xcite ; these models allow a unique internal equilibrium .",
    "it may be interesting to examine the rock ",
    "scissors  paper game under the current framework .",
    "i assumed that players imitate others in the same subpopulation .",
    "in fact , there may be competition of update rules between such players and those that imitate from the entire population .",
    "nevertheless , at least near pure stable equilibria , the population is considered to be resistant against invasion by mutants that imitate from the entire population . to explain why ,",
    "let us suppose that @xmath4 and @xmath6 players select @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the equilibrium .",
    "a mutant that imitates from the entire population and attempts to invade subpopulation @xmath4 would sometimes select @xmath1 because @xmath6 players select @xmath1 . because @xmath0 , not @xmath1 , is the best response in this population ,",
    "such a mutant is considered not able to invade the subpopulation of resident players .",
    "therefore , the imitation rule considered in the present study is considered to have evolutionary stability , at least in this case .",
    "in this section , i show that the equilibria given by eqs .   and are esss of the subjective payoff snowdrift game . to this end",
    ", i use a matrix criterion for the ess @xcite accommodated to the case of the two - strategy game .",
