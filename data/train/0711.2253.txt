    "the cp - conserving minimal supersymmetric standard model  ( mssm ) contains three neutral higgs bosons  @xcite , the lighter and heavier cp - even scalars @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively , and the cp - odd pseudoscalar @xmath2 .",
    "while the mssm higgs sector is cp - conserving at born level even in the presence of cp - phases , loop effects mediated dominantly by third generation squarks can generate significant cp - violating scalar - pseudoscalar transitions , leading to mixing of the neutral higgs states into the mass eigenstates @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , with no definite cp parities  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that mixing of states with equal conserved quantum numbers is strongly enhanced when these states are nearly degenerate , i.e. , when their mass difference is of the order of their widths  @xcite .",
    "this degeneracy occurs naturally in the higgs decoupling limit of the mssm , where the lightest higgs boson has standard model - like couplings and decouples from the significantly heavier higgs bosons  @xcite . in the decoupling limit ,",
    "a resonance enhanced mixing of the states @xmath1 and @xmath2 can occur , which may result in nearly maximal cp - violating effects  @xcite .",

    "detailed investigations of the fundamental properties of the higgs bosons , both phenomenological and experimental , will be crucial for the understanding of the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking .    in previous studies of the cp - conserving  @xcite and cp - violating higgs sector  @xcite",
    ", it was shown that the cp - properties and couplings of the heavy neutral higgs bosons can be ideally tested in @xmath6 collisions .",
    "such a muon collider is a superb machine for measuring the neutral higgs masses , widths , and couplings with high precision , since the higgs bosons are resonantly produced in the @xmath7-channel  @xcite .",
    "the well controllable beam energy allows the study of the center - of - mass energy dependence of observables around the higgs resonances .",
    "in particular , the beam polarization plays an essential role for analyzing the cp nature of the higgs sector itself .",
    "not only backgrounds can be reduced , but the cp - even and cp - odd contributions of the interfering higgs resonances to the observables can be ideally studied , if the beam polarizations are properly adjusted  @xcite .",
    "besides the initial beam polarization , the final fermion polarizations are essential to probe the higgs interference .",
