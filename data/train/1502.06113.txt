    "the concept of local isotropy is important for both fundamental and applied problems in turbulence  @xcite . on the one hand ,",
    "obviously no real flow can be exactly isotropic at all scales , due to the external forcings and boundary conditions that typically break such symmetry .",
    "on the other hand , theoretical ideas and experimental observations support the concept of return to local isotropy , where by local it is meant far enough from the boundaries and also for small enough scales .",
    "the rationale is that any anisotropic effects introduced by the external forcing , the mean flow and/or walls , is overwhelmed by the turbulent fluctuations at sufficiently large reynolds numbers and in fluid locations where neither the forcing nor the boundaries play a major role ( if any ) .",
    "therefore , all flows in nature have some degree of anisotropy , but also all flows in nature should return to some quasi - isotropic statistical state . moreover , the return to isotropy should be faster than the decay rate of turbulence . even though there are many confirmations of this general phenomenology ( see e.g.@xcite for a review ) there are still some crucial open questions",
    ".    concerning scalar and temperature gradient fluctuations , the available data and discussions are even more diverse and complicated than for the turbulent velocity . already , the behavior of the passive scalar statistics is non - trivial and still a major field of research@xcite .",
    "the complex aspects of the scalar characteristics apparently arise from the mixing process rather than from the turbulent velocity field@xcite and the scalar field is mainly decoupled from the velocity field itself .",
    "the proper way to assess the relative importance of isotropic _ vs _ anisotropic fluctuations in turbulent flows , including active or passive scalar advection , is given through the direct measurements of the moments of the increments of the fields for different distances , i.e. the so - called structure functions@xcite .",
    "indeed , the behavior of the higher order moments of small - scale fluctuations in turbulent flows has been the subject of both numerical and experimental studies for decade@xcite .",
    "it is crucial to realize that not all possible structure functions are sensitive to anisotropy in the same way .",
    "for instance , it is well known that odd moments of scalar fields are always vanishing for perfectly isotropic statistics , while for velocity increments only those built in terms of the transverse components must vanish@xcite . therefore , when a stable statistical signal is measured for an odd increment of a scalar field or a transverse velocity component in a turbulent flow , it is a direct signature of the presence of some kind of anisotropy . on the other hand ,",
    "the even moments are less sensitive , being always different from zero already in a fully isotropic ensemble . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", there exists a very clear and systematic way to disentangle isotropic and anisotropic fluctuations , and to disentangle different kinds of anisotropic fluctuations among themselves .",
    "this is based on the idea to decompose any observable in a suitable set of eigenfunctions of the group of rotation@xcite . as a matter of fact ,",
    "it is very difficult to apply this decomposition on experimental data , because of the need to control the whole field on a spherical volume .",
    "this is why systematic studies of the anisotropic properties of turbulent flows are rare .",
    "in addition , in order to better understand the whole probability density function ( pdf ) of anisotropic fluctuations , it is mandatory to also measure high order moments , a task that can only be accomplished with large statistical samples .",
    "this is why the combined assessment of importance of anisotropic and rare non - gaussian fluctuations ( intermittency ) in turbulent flows and scalar fields advected by turbulent flows is still considered a state - of - the - art theoretical and experimental problem@xcite .",
    "the situation is even more complex when the scalar field is coupled back to the advecting velocity , becoming an active component in the dynamics@xcite , as for the case of the turbulent rayleigh - benard convection , where the temperature preferentially couples with the velocity fluctuations in the vertical direction only , introducing a strong large scale anisotropy due to the buoyancy effects .",
    "the reacting flows in general and combustion applications in particular are among the turbulent flows , where large and small scales of different scalar fields are present and coupled back to the advecting flow field .",
    "many researchers have studied the characteristics of passive and active scalars embedded in turbulent reacting flows to detect possible universal / non - universal behaviors@xcite .",
    "however , studies on the effects of the combustion heat release on the small scales of turbulence are limited and need to be further explored . for instance , tong , warhaft and coworkers showed that the pdf of the scalar derivative in the direction of the mean gradient is strongly skewed .",
    "they observed that the skewness of the scalar derivative in the direction of the mean scalar gradient is nonzero , which implies the existence of the ramp - cliff - like structure in the scalar signal@xcite .",
    "they also showed that the ramp - cliff structure in the mixture fraction field has a strong influence on the reaction zones .",
    "tong , barlow and coworkers@xcite properly asserted that the understanding of turbulent mixing is largely based on the kolmogorov turbulence theory .",
    "they discussed that there are certain deviations from the universal distribution of the scalar at the subgrid - scale ( sgs ) level .",
    "they argued that in both reacting and non - reacting flows , depending on the sgs scalar variance and mean value , the sgs scalar is expected to show either a nearly gaussian or a non - gaussian behavior .",
    "they categorized the scalar structure at the sgs level to be a ramp - cliff structure@xcite .",
    "their finding regarding the sgs scalar properties has many phenomenological parallels with the results of the present study concerning the small - scale characteristics .    in the present work",
    ", we analyze the case of an active scalar field in a reacting turbulent wall - jet , which represents a complex canonical flow .",
    "the scalar reacts and affects the flow and its influence depends on the position , due to the spatial evolution of the jet and boundary layer in the streamwise direction and the chemical reaction that occurs between the species .",
    "we investigate the heat release effects on the turbulent flow , with an emphasis on the anisotropic and/or intermittent aspects .",
    "indeed , the heat - release effects on the anisotropic fluctuations of the wall - jet flow and its impacts on the scalar fields are not yet well understood .",
    "we study this by looking at both the large and small - scale statistics at different downstream locations and wall distances .",
    "is the local maximum streamwise velocity , @xmath0 is the coflow velocity , @xmath1 is the distance from the wall at the position of maximum streamwise velocity and @xmath2 is the half - height of the wall - jet in the outer region.,width=453 ]    the turbulent wall - jet consists of a boundary layer and a jet flow@xcite , both of which are among the most important and fundamental canonical turbulent flows , see figure  [ fig : schemi ] .",
    "inclusion of the chemical reaction allows us to compare the statistics of the active and reactive scalar fields .",
    "this is achieved by integrating , simultaneous to the reacting field , also the evolution of another scalar , fully passive , without any feedback on the flow . in a previous study@xcite , we have examined and addressed the heat - release effects on the mixing scales of the flow , which play a role on the large - scale features of the velocity and scalar fields . in the present study , the dns databases of two different reacting turbulent wall - jets are considered . in one case@xcite ,",
    "the chemical reaction is isothermal while in the other@xcite , it is exothermic with a substantial amount of heat release . since",
    ", no heat release is involved in the isothermal case , the reactive scalar is `` passive - reactive '' , while for the exothermic case , the reactive scalar is tagged as the `` active - reactive '' scalar .",
    "moreover , we also evolve a passive non - reacting scalar in the same flow configuration .",
    "thus , three different types of scalars are present , namely , passive , passive - reactive and active - reactive scalars and the present investigation addresses the differences in their behaviors .",
    "the study of the small - scale characteristics of the turbulent flow and the scalar field has interesting outcomes and implications for turbulence modeling applications@xcite .",
    "it is known that the chemical reaction leads to a strong non - gaussian behavior at large scales leading to different characteristics of the reactive scalar from that of the passive scalar .",
    "chemical reaction enhances the intermittency level at different locations , e.g. near the wall and at the half - height of the jet , where the reaction rate is maximum . as discussed in pouransari _",
    "et al._@xcite , the pdfs of fuel species show long exponential tails . here",
    ", we further investigate whether the non - gaussian behavior caused by the chemical reaction is persistent down to the very small scales .",
    "it is observed that , the persistency of anisotropy and the related intense intermittency of both passive and active scalars are greater than that of the velocity field in which it is embedded .",
    "we measure the departure from local isotropy at small scales and the degree of intermittency of the various scalars . in order to gain a firm foundation for the understanding of scalar intermittency and anisotropies ,",

    "the horizontal range is chosen such that outside this range , the scatter is very large and the probabilities are lower than @xmath113 indicating extremely rare events .",
    "this makes the conclusions of the present investigation confined to this particular range .",
    "moreover , the pdf tails for the spatial derivatives are known to depend on the resolution of the computation . in the present simulations ,",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : kolm_tayl](a ) , the resolution for the wall - normal distances below @xmath114 compares well with the kolmogorov scale and is better for the exothermic case . for the wall - normal distances smaller than @xmath115",

    "it is interesting to compare the pdf of the velocity field to that of the passive scalar field . at the extreme tails of the pdfs ,",
    "a large difference between the velocity gradients and scalar gradients are observed .",
    "this is clear if we compare the absolute value of the pdfs tail for large excursions from the mean .",
    "these observations are better quantified by examining the difference in the higher order moments at these particular positions . in table",
    "ii , it is observed that the flatness factors are substantially higher for the passive scalar compared to the velocity components at the near - wall position , while the differences are small at @xmath2 .",
    "this is indeed consistent with the formation of much sharper gradients observed in the scalar field , which is accentuated in the high - shear region near the wall .",
    "the pdf of different species for the exothermic case is qualitatively similar to the isothermal case .",
    "this is due to the fact that the chemical reaction is the dominating effect regarding the difference between fuel and passive scalars .",
    "the occurrence of a double peak close to the wall for the fuel pdf and other characteristics are almost the same@xcite , which shows that the modes of the reacting scalars are similar in the two cases with and without heat release .",
    "thus , for comparison of passive and reactive scalars , we may focus on pdf shapes of only one simulation case , but at several wall - normal positions . a comparison between the pdfs of the passive and reactive scalars for different wall - normal positions ,",
    "see figure  [ fig : pdfy](a ) , shows that the pdfs of the two species are very different at large scales and the chemical reaction plays an important role in the shape of the pdfs .",
    "it can already be understood that the reaction effects on the species are much larger than the heat release effects .    in figure",
    "[ fig : pdfy](a ) , the peaks of the fuel pdfs are clearly shifted towards the lower concentrations and are sharper compared to those of the passive scalar .",
    "it is observed that the pdfs for the two species hardly collapse at any particular wall - normal position .",
    "similar to the argument in relation to figure  [ fig : pdfu ] , the horizontal range in figure  [ fig : pdfy ] is chosen such that outside this range , the scatter is very high and events are extremely rare .",
    "the pdfs of the scalar gradients , the passive and reactive scalars , are barely distinguishable throughout the entire wall - normal levels and a very good collapse for all curves is obtained using the @xmath116-values for normalizations , see figure  [ fig : pdfy](b ) .",
    "thus , the turbulent mixing is overwhelming at the small scales and the reaction does not play the key role at this level and universality of the small - scales is recovered .",
    "this is confirmed further with the good collapse achieved for the derivatives , see figure  [ fig : pdfy](b ) .",
    "this is an important observation made in the present study , the fact that the pdfs of the gradients recover a fairly similar shape for the passive and reactive scalars , is a clear indication of recovery of universality going from large to small scales and is certainly true for the bulk of the gradient fluctuations .",
    "however , a small deviation between the different cases can still be observed in the left tail of the pdfs in figure  [ fig : pdfy ] ( b ) .",
    "this indicates a residual anisotropy ( notice that for purely isotropic statistics the pdf should be symmetric ) and is connected to the fact that the anisotropy might well be non - universal , depending on flow - specific features .",

    "it is important to note that the reaction zone structure and the pdf of the reactive scalars also depend on the damkhler number and conclusions can not be drawn without considering its influence . thus , to distinguish between the heat release and the damkhler number effects , a comparison between two dns cases with different damkhler numbers is performed .",
    "figure  [ fig : pdf_da ] shows the pdfs of both the passive and reactive scalars for these two cases .",
    "the damkhler numbers are equal to @xmath124 and @xmath125 for cases  ii and  iii , see table 1 .",
    "four different wall - normal positions in terms of the local half - height of the jet @xmath2 are considered . as expected ,",
    "the turbulent flame becomes thinner with increasing damkhler number@xcite , however , we can expect a similar dynamical behavior for the flame at the same wall - normal distance in terms of @xmath2 .",
    "the two cases have similar characteristics at almost the entire wall - normal direction , except in the near - wall region at @xmath126 .",
    "this is where the damkhler number effects are dominant and the pdf of case  ii with a higher damkhler number is more skewed toward the negative side and the peak of pdf for high damkhler number case obtains a higher value .",
    "this can also be associated with the isothermal wall cooling effects in the near - wall region .",

    "the ramp - cliff contribution to the reactive scalar statistics in the reaction zone is much larger than the rest of the mixture fraction field .",
    "thus , to better reflect the differences between the reactive scalars in the isothermal and exothermic cases , the conditional pdfs on the mixture fraction are given in figure  [ fig : pdf_cond ] .",
    "three different wall - normal positions in terms of the local half - height of the jet are chosen for the two cases .",

    "around ten percent of the stoichiometric mixture fraction value @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is the equivalence ratio and @xmath129 as is used in the reaction equation .",
    "it is observed that if a narrower range is chosen for the conditioning , then the pdf tails become more damped and the corresponding peaks become sharper .",
    "it is notable that the pdfs of the reactive scalar derivatives , as seen in figure  [ fig : pdf_cond](b ) are more skewed toward the negative side in the conditional plots than the corresponding unconditional pdfs in figure  [ fig : pdfy ] ( b ) . in particular ,",
    "this is observed in the reaction zone and in the center of the flame at @xmath130 , which is similar to what is found in the anisotropic ramp - cliff like structures .",
    "for the two cases . the circle marks indicate values at the wall and the cross signs show the corresponding values at the position of the maximum mean streamwise velocity for each case .",

    "before moving to the discussion on the higher order moments of the velocity and scalar fields at large- and small - scales , let us have a closer look at a more standard indicator of the anisotropic properties of the large - scale velocity components through anisotropy of the second - order reynolds stress tensor @xmath131 defined as @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the turbulent kinetic energy and @xmath134 is the kronecker delta .",
    "the second @xmath135 and third @xmath136 invariants of @xmath131 are defined as @xmath137 the lumley flatness factor@xcite defined as f@xmath138 is used to study the turbulence characteristics .",
    "its value varies between zero and one with small values indicating a flow with characteristics of quasi two - dimensional turbulence and values close to unity denote the structure of the isotropic three - component turbulence .",
    "figure  [ fig : lumley_anisot](a ) shows the value of f for the two cases . as expected , f is small inside the boundary layer for both cases and gradually increases and approaches unity away from the wall .",
    "the maximum value f@xmath139 for the isothermal case  i is higher than that for the exothermic case  ii where f@xmath140 .",
    "this indicates that in both cases a quasi two - dimensional characteristic is observed close to the wall for @xmath141 .",
    "away from the wall , around @xmath142 , the heat release due to the chemical reaction tends to increase the flow anisotropy .",
    "hence gives a smaller peak for the exothermic case  ii .",
    "further away from the wall , a weak local minimum forms at about @xmath130 for the two cases . the local minimum is smaller for the exothermic case  ii , indicating that the high amount of the combustion heat release , present in the center of the jet flame , has increased the quasi two - dimensional character of the flow .    to further characterize the turbulence behavior of the flow field ,",
    "the anisotropy invariant maps@xcite are presented by cross - plotting the second @xmath135 and third @xmath136 invariants .",
    "the limits in the anisotropy map correspond to the quasi two - dimensional turbulence state when @xmath143 and axisymmetric turbulence state when @xmath144 .",
    "these limits define the anisotropy invariant map triangle within which , all the physically realizable turbulence states lie .",
    "the edges of this triangle are shown with solid lines in figure  [ fig : lumley_anisot ] ( b ) . in the anisotropy invariant map",
    ", the lower corner of the triangle corresponds to isotropic turbulence with zero anisotropy and axisymmetric turbulence corresponds to the left and right edges of the triangle . at the left edge , one component of velocity fluctuations is smaller than the other two , while at the right edge , one component of velocity fluctuations dominates the other two .",
    "the upper edge of the triangle corresponds to the quasi two - dimensional turbulence .",
    "figure  [ fig : lumley_anisot](b ) shows the anisotropy invariant map for cases  i and  ii at the downstream position @xmath77 .",
    "starting from the wall , the trajectories of the two cases lie somewhere on the upper edge , shown with circle marks in figure  [ fig : lumley_anisot](b ) and turbulence has a quasi two - dimensional characteristic , as is the case close to any solid boundary .",
    "however , the degree of anisotropy ( invariant ii ) is larger for the case  ii with heat release , i.e. signifying a state closer to the one - component limit .",
    "the trajectories move along the upper edge before they reach the maximum of the invariant @xmath136 , very close to the wall at @xmath145 and then return to lower values of the invariants .",
    "the position of the maximum for both cases is the same , but again the anisotropy magnitude is larger for the exothermic case .",
    "further away from the wall , trajectories move toward the lower corner of the triangle and reach there individually at about the same wall - normal level of the position of the maximum streamwise velocity or the local zero shear around @xmath142 , shown with crosses in figure  [ fig : lumley_anisot](b ) .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the lower corner of the anisotropy invariant map represents an isotropic energy distribution of the turbulence , and indeed the flow exhibits the most isotropic characteristics at the zero shear location . moving even further away from the wall , in the region @xmath146 , both trajectories remain close to the lower corner of the map , initially with positive values of the invariant @xmath136 and then gradually move away form the lower corner towards the left edge .",
    "the trajectories reach the left edge of the map at about @xmath147 , not shown in the figure . away from this position ,",
    "it is well outside the jet boundary and all the turbulence intensities tend to vanish .",
    "in order to better quantify the degree of anisotropy of the flow , it is useful to identify a set of observables , which highlight either large- or small - scale field properties , which would exactly vanish for purely isotropic turbulence . for the passive , passive - reactive and passive - active scalars , it suffices to take any odd moment of either the single point scalar or its derivatives .    in order to deal with dimensionless quantities ,",
    "a normalization with a suitable power of the @xmath116-value is used , defining the so - called generalized skewness of order @xmath148 : @xmath149 where with @xmath150 we denote the fluctuation of any scalar field around its favre - averaged mean value . for isotropic statistics , we would have @xmath151 for any @xmath148 ( see e.g. monim & yaglom@xcite ) .",
    "in the following , we will limit ourselves to address the first non - trivial case , @xmath152 , which is typically called the skewness of a field and we will drop the dependency on the index @xmath153 . concerning a vector field , the skewness defined in terms of any of its components would be zero in an isotropic field , i.e. @xmath154 where @xmath155 are the streamwise , wall - normal and spanwise components , respectively .",
    "the situation is different if one considers the gradients . for vector fields ,",
    "only the odd moments of the transverse gradients must vanish in an isotropic ensemble , while the longitudinal ones can be ( and indeed are ) different from zero also in a purely rotational invariant case .",
    "for instance , if we focus on the wall - normal derivatives , we must expect that the skewness of @xmath156 and @xmath157 are genuine measurements of the degree of anisotropy , while @xmath158 is not , being affected by both isotropic and anisotropic fluctuations .    concerning a way to characterize the intense non - gaussian properties of the field , independently of its isotropic or anisotropic content , it is useful to introduce the generalized flatness factor of order @xmath148 : @xmath159 which is a proxy of the degree of departure from a purely gaussian shape .",
    "for instance for the simplest case @xmath152 , we have @xmath160 for a gaussian variable .    ;",
    "( a ) skewness and ( b ) flatness .",

    "<S> two exothermic cases with different damkhler number are examined and the comparison revealed that the damkhler number effects are most dominant in the near - wall region , where the wall cooling effects are influential . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , with the aid of pdfs conditioned on the mixture fraction , the significance of the reactive scalar characteristics in the reaction zone is illustrated . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the combined effects of strong intermittency and strong persistency of anisotropy at the small scales in the entire domain can affect mixing and ultimately the combustion characteristics of the reacting flow . </S>"
