    "already many decades ago , it has been suggested that , because of the extreme densities reached in the cores of neutron stars , neutrons and protons may transform to quark matter in the cores of such objects @xcite .",
    "quark matter could thus exist as a permanent component of matter in the ultra - dense centers of neutron stars ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "if the dense interior of a neutron star is indeed converted to quark matter , it must be three - flavor quark matter since it has lower energy than two - flavor quark matter .",
    "and just as for the hyperon content of neutron stars , strangeness is not conserved on macroscopic time scales , which allows neutron stars to convert confined hadronic matter to three - flavor quark matter until equilibrium brings this process to a halt .",
    "as first realized by glendenning @xcite , the presence of quark matter enables the hadronic regions of the mixed phase to arrange to be more isospin symmetric than in the pure phase by transferring charge to the quark phase in equilibrium with it .",
    "the symmetry energy will be lowered thereby at only a small cost in rearranging the quark fermi surfaces .",
    "the electrons play only a minor role when neutrality can be achieved among the baryon - charge carrying particles .",
    "the stellar implication of this charge rearrangement is that the mixed phase region of the star will have positively charged regions of nuclear matter and negatively charged regions of quark matter .    because of the competition between the coulomb and the surface energies associated with the positively charged regions of nuclear matter and negatively charged regions of quark matter , the mixed phase may develop geometrical structures ( see fig.[fig : qh_structures ] ) , similarly as it is expected of the subnuclear liquid - gas phase transition @xcite .",
    "this competition establishes the shapes , sizes , and spacings of the rare phase in the background of the other in order to minimize the lattice energy @xcite .",
    "the change in energy accompanied by developing such geometrical        structures is likely to be very small in comparison with the volume energy @xcite and , thus , may not much affect the global properties of a neutron star",
    ". however , the geometrical structure of the mixed phase may be very important for irregularities ( glitches ) in the timing structure of pulsar spin - down as well as for the thermal and transport properties of neutron stars @xcite .    to calculate the neutrino - pair bremsstrahlung rates and thermal properties , we follow the method described in @xcite and @xcite , which is commonly used for the calculation of the neutrino emissivity and thermal conductivity in the crusts of neutron stars .",
    "these authors considered contributions from electron - phonon scattering and bragg diffraction ( the static - lattice contribution ) .",
    "furthermore , multi - phonon processes and electron band structure effects are incorporated to obtain more realistic scattering rates and a better connection between the solid and the liquid gas phase . instead of adopting the analytic fits provided in @xcite and @xcite , here we re -",
    "calculate the scattering rates from phonon sums using the method of @xcite .",
    "there are two main reasons for this .",
    "the first being that , for the crust , the total ion charge is balanced by the total electron charge .",
    "this will be different for the mixed quark - hadron phase in the core of a neutron star , since electric charge neutrality is established between the electric charges of the rare phase , the dominant phase , and the leptons which are present in both the rare and the dominant phase .",
    "the simple relation @xmath4 between electron density and ion density , used to derive the crustal fit formula in @xcite , can therefore not be used to study the quark - hadron coulomb lattice structure in the core of a neutron star .",
    "the second reason concerns the electric charge numbers themselves . for mixed phase blobs",
    ", they can easily exceed @xmath5 , as will be shown in ",
    "[ sec : mixedph ] .",
    "charge numbers that high are obviously not reached in the crustal regimes of neutron stars @xcite , where there is usually no need to consider atomic nuclei with charges much larger than @xmath6 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec2 ]",
    ", we briefly discuss the modeling of the mixed quark - hadron phase in the cores of neutron stars and the equations of state of confined hadronic and quark matter used in this work . in section",
    "[ sec : calc ] , we summarize the formalism for calculating the neutrino - pair bremsstrahlung emissivity and the thermal conductivity of rare phase blobs immersed in hadronic matter . the results are presented in section  [ sec : result ] .",
    "to compute the particle compositions of the cores of standard neutron stars , that is , neutron stars without deconfined quark degrees of freedom , we choose a relativistic lagrangian of the following type @xcite , @xmath7\\psi_b+\\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_\\mu\\sigma\\partial^\\mu    \\sigma - m_\\sigma^2\\sigma^2 ) \\nonumber\\\\    & -&\\frac{1}{3}b_\\sigma m_n(g_\\sigma\\sigma)^3-\\frac{1}{4}c_\\sigma(g_\\sigma\\sigma)^4-    \\frac{1}{4}\\omega_{\\mu\\nu } \\ , \\omega^{\\mu\\nu } \\nonumber\\\\    & + & \\frac{1}{2}m_\\omega^2\\ , \\omega_\\mu\\ , \\omega^\\mu+\\frac{1}{2 } m_\\rho^2 \\ ,     \\vec{\\rho}_\\mu\\cdot    \\vec{\\rho\\,}^\\mu \\label{eq : lag}\\\\    & -&\\frac{1}{4}\\vec{\\rho\\,}_{\\mu\\nu } \\",

    "the values of @xmath24 for @xmath25 through @xmath26 are shown in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "therefore , since @xmath27 in a lattice of nuclei immersed in an electron gas , @xmath28 is guaranteed to have a handful of terms . however , as we have seen in section  [ sec : mixedph ] , the electron density will drop drastically with increasing baryon number density in the mixed phase region if @xmath29 so that @xmath30 drops correspondingly ( see fig .",
