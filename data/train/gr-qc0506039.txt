    "in @xcite , one of us argued that several of the puzzles inherent in our current understanding of quantum and quantum - gravitational physics would appear to find a natural resolution if one were to postulate that quantum gravity is a quantum theory of a conventional type with a total hilbert space @xmath18 which arises as a tensor product @xmath19 of a matter and a gravity hilbert space , and with a total time - evolution which is unitary , but that , while , as would usually be assumed in a standard quantum theory , one still assumes that there is an ever - pure time - evolving `` underlying '' state , modelled by a density operator of form @xmath20 @xmath21 , at each `` instant of time '' , one adds the new assumption that the _ physically relevant _ density operator is not this underlying density operator , but rather its partial trace , @xmath22 , over @xmath23 . with these assumptions , an initial underlying state of a closed quantum gravitational system with a low degree of matter - gravity entanglement",
    "would be expected to become more and more entangled as time increases ",
    "equivalently @xmath22 will be subject to an ever - increasing amount of decoherence .",
    "in fact the von - neumann entropy of @xmath22 would be expected to increase monotonically , thus ( when the theory is applied to a model for the universe as a whole ) offering an explanation for the second law of thermodynamics and ( when the theory is applied to a model closed system consisting of a black hole sitting in an otherwise empty universe ) offering a resolution to the information loss puzzle .",
    "( it offers both of these things in that , by defining the physical entropy of @xmath24 to be the von - neumann entropy of @xmath22 , one reconciles an underlying unitary time - evolution on @xmath18 with an entropy which varies / increases in time . )    a second paper , @xcite , by the same one of us investigated the implications of the theory proposed in @xcite for the decoherence of ordinary matter in the non - relativistic , weak - gravitational - field regime .",
    "in particular , @xcite addressed the question of the appropriate description of the state , at some instant of time , of the center - of - mass degrees of freedom of a system of @xmath1 bodies , which , for simplicity , were taken to be identical . in ordinary quantum mechanics , such a state",
    "would be described by a many - body schrdinger wave function @xmath25 in the usual matter hilbert space @xmath26 , consisting of the ( appropriately symmetrized , according to whether the bodies are treated as fermions or bosons or neither ) @xmath1-fold tensor product of @xmath27 .",
    "@xcite argues that such a @xmath28 needs to be replaced by a total ( entangled ) matter - gravity state vector @xmath29 in a total matter - gravity hilbert space which is the tensor product of @xmath26 ( defined as above ) with a suitable hilbert space @xmath23 for the modes of the quantized linearized gravitational field .",
    "specifically , thinking of this tensor - product hilbert space as the set of ( appropriately symmetrized ) square - integrable functions from @xmath30 to @xmath23 , @xmath29 is taken , in @xcite , to be the function @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a certain ( non - radiative ) quantum coherent state ( introduced in @xcite ) of the linearised gravitational field describing the newtonian gravitational field due to the simultaneous presence of a body centred on each of the locations @xmath33 .",
    "( we remark that , in @xcite , for the purposes of calculating these coherent states , the bodies are modelled as classical mass - distributions . ) in the non - relativistic , weak - gravitational - field regime , the projector @xmath34 onto this @xmath29 , is thus taken to be , to a very good approximation , the correct description of the `` underlying '' state of quantum gravity describing our many - body system in the sense described in the previous paragraph . the physically relevant density operator is therefore given , in this approximation , by the partial trace @xmath22 of this @xmath24 over @xmath23 which , in position space is clearly given by @xmath35 @xmath36 where the _ multiplicative factor _ @xmath37 is defined by @xmath38 ( in @xcite , @xmath39 was written @xmath40 where @xmath41 was called the _",
    "decoherence exponent_. ) moreover , it was shown in @xcite that , in the case the bodies are taken to be balls with constant mass density and ( we work in planck units where @xmath42 ) total mass @xmath2 and radius @xmath3 ( i.e. in the case the classical mass distributions representing the bodies are taken to be such balls ) and in the case all the positions @xmath43 of their centres of mass are much further away from one another than @xmath3 ( we shall call this the _ well - spaced _ regime ) where this condition does nt hold to be so small in comparison to size of the region where @xmath44 is significantly big that no significant correction would be needed to results calculated on the assumption that the multiplicative factor is well - approximated by the @xmath45 in all of @xmath46 . ] , the multiplicative factor is well approximated by @xmath47 where @xmath45 is given by the explicit formula @xmath48 where it is to be understood that , in the cases @xmath49 , the terms in the denominator @xmath50 are to be replaced by @xmath51 .    to summarize , taking into account gravitational effects and then tracing over the gravitational field , as the general theory of @xcite prescribes that we should do , has , in the non - relativistic weak - gravitational - field regime , and on the assumption that the bodies are uniform mass balls , an overall effect which is equivalent to multiplying the usual quantum mechanical ( pure ) position - space density matrix @xmath52 by a multiplicative factor , @xmath39 , which",
    ", in the well - spaced regime , is well - approximated by @xmath45 given by the formula ( [ eqn:1.1 ] ) and it is the product of this pure density matrix with the multiplicative factor which is to be regarded as the physically relevant density operator .",
    "we remark that the formula ( [ eqn:1.1 ] ) can also be written @xmath53 where the first product is taken over all @xmath54 from @xmath55 to @xmath1 and the second product is taken over all @xmath56 and @xmath57 from 1 to n , which satisfy @xmath58 .",
    "we also remark that , in the case of a wave function for a single ball state , this prescription amounts to multiplying the density operator @xmath59 by the multiplicative factor @xmath60    the problems we wish to address in the present paper are that , in the derivation , @xcite , of ( [ eqn:1.1 ] ) , the bodies are assumed to be constant mass - density balls whereas in applications , the bodies one is interested in will actually typically be `` grainy '' , and also not necessarily spherical .",
    "in fact , in one application ( cf .",
    "the discussion of the schrdinger - cat - like states in @xcite ) of the above formulae , the balls are interpreted as macroscopic balls of ordinary matter and real ordinary matter is of course grainy in that it is made out of atoms etc . and",
    "we may also be interested in lumps of ordinary matter with shapes other than balls . in another application , the above formulae ( or rather their obvious generalization to states of many bodies where the masses and radii are not all equal )",
    "are interpreted as telling us how the standard non - relativistic quantum mechanics of closed systems of large numbers of atomic nuclei and electrons etc .",
    "gets modified according to the theory developed in @xcite and @xcite . in this latter application ,",
    "the balls are taken to be models of nuclei and electrons etc . and",
    "again , of course , real nuclei and electrons are not actually uniform density balls , but will have their own grainy substructure and also need not be spherical .",
    "however one might hope that if constant - density balls were replaced by grainy , and possibly non - spherical , ( classical ) `` lumps '' , then the formula @xmath61 for the multiplicative factor might nevertheless remain approximately correct provided we replace @xmath3 in @xmath61 by a suitable effective radius @xmath11 .",
    "one might further hope that , in the case of a grainy ball , @xmath11 would turn out to be of the same order of magnitude as @xmath3 and in the case of a grainy lump of some other shape , to be of the same order of magnitude as some measure of the lump s typical linear size .",
    "( we shall refer below to the lump s _ diameter _ without attempting to give a precise general definition to this notion . )",
    "if these hopes were fulfilled , then one might say that the formula @xmath61 for @xmath45 is _ robust _ under ( classical ) changes in graininess and in shape .",
    "we remark that we are continuing to assume here that our grainy , non - spherical , situations can , as far as their gravitational effects are concerned , still be modelled within the formalism of @xcite , as classical ( albeit now no longer uniform and no longer spherical ) mass distributions and we admit that , in principle , we should of course presumably work within an extension of the formalism of @xcite which allows for truly _ quantum _ ( and also relativistic ) descriptions of graininess ( and non - sphericity ) .",
    "( especially , such a quantum relativistic description may well be important in the second of our applications , to the grainy substructure of the proton etc . ) while we shall not attempt to explore such quantum notions of graininess and non - sphericity in this paper , if robustness holds in the above sense under classical changes in graininess and in shape , it might also seem reasonable to guess that our formulae will remain robust even if graininess and changes in shape were taken into account in such a correct quantum way .    in any case",
    ", the purpose of the present paper is to investigate whether and/or under what circumstances , these hopes are fulfilled in the case of one specific class of classical grainy models .",
    "namely , models in which every one of the balls of mass @xmath2 and radius @xmath3 in formula @xmath61 is replaced by a collection of @xmath7 little balls , each of mass @xmath8 and radius @xmath9 fixed at definite positions inside a lump - shaped region ( i.e. some smooth closed bounded region of @xmath62 ) of diameter approximately equal to @xmath63 so that its centre of mass is located where the center ( i.e. one of the positions @xmath64 ) of the ball it replaces was located .",
    "we shall assume that the configurations of the balls within each of the lumps are euclidean - congruent to one - another .",
    "however we shall not restrict the relative orientations of the different lumps ; they are allowed to be arbitrarily rotated with respect to one another .",
    "we remark that obviously we have @xmath65 . here",
    "we have in mind choices of values for the various parameters such that @xmath66 where , by `` any inter - lump spacing '' we mean any of the distances between pairs of distinct elements of the set @xmath67 and ( assuming from now on that a definite system has been adopted for enumerating the little balls  as @xmath68 etc .  within the @xmath56th lump etc . ) by `` any inter - small - ball spacing '' we mean any of the distances between pairs of distinct elements of the set @xmath69 for some / any @xmath56 . then ( in all but an unimportantly small volume of @xmath46  cf .",
    "footnote above ) formula @xmath61 will clearly get replaced by @xmath70 where now it is to be understood that in the cases where @xmath49 _ and _ @xmath71 , the terms in the denominator @xmath72 are to be replaced by @xmath73 .    in line with @xmath74 , if we make the replacements : @xmath75 ( and similarly with primed and unprimed quantities interchanged ) in @xmath76 , then we clearly expect to get a good approximation tends to @xmath55 as the scale tends to infinity . ] to @xmath77 . making these replacements",
    ", we immediately get @xmath78 where the final product involves all the positions @xmath79 of little balls inside any single lump  by our assumption of euclidean congruence , it does nt matter which one  and ranges over all values of @xmath80 and @xmath81 from @xmath55 to @xmath7 _ except that _ it is to be understood that , in this final product , in the cases @xmath71 the denominator is to be replaced by @xmath73 .",
    "clearly another way of saying exactly the same thing as this is that @xmath82 is approximately equal to @xmath45 , as given by the formula @xmath61 _ except that _ the proviso that , in the cases @xmath49 , the terms in the denominator @xmath50 are to be replaced by @xmath51 should be _ replaced by _ the proviso that , in the cases @xmath49 , the terms in the denominator @xmath50 are to be replaced by @xmath83 where @xmath11 is defined by @xmath84 where the products each go from @xmath55 to @xmath7 and it is to be understood that , in cases where @xmath71 , the terms @xmath85 are to be replaced by @xmath9 .",
    "equivalently , we may write @xmath86 ( where the product is now over all @xmath80 and @xmath81 from @xmath55 to @xmath7 satisfying @xmath87 ) . thus the first part of our hope ( i.e. that replacing our uniform density balls by our grainy lumps can be well - approximated by replacing @xmath3 by a suitable @xmath11 ) is fulfilled .",
    "we now turn to discussing the second part of our hope , namely whether , and/or under what circumstances , @xmath11 will turn out to be of the same `` order of magnitude '' as the diameter of our lump .",
    "we have not been able to answer this question in general but , instead , content ourselves with analysing one particularly simple special case of our model .",
    "namely , where each lump is a cube consisting of @xmath12 small balls of radius @xmath9 with centres at the vertices of a cubic lattice of spacing @xmath14 and side @xmath16 .",
    "to spell out precisely what we mean and at the same time set up a useful notation , we assume the ball - centres of any one of these cubes to be coordinatizable so that they lie at the positions @xmath88 where @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 are integers which each range between @xmath55 and @xmath92 .",
    "clearly the total number of balls , @xmath7 , in the cube will be @xmath93 and we note that there will be a ball at the centre ( with coordinates @xmath94 ) .",
    "in line with @xmath74 , we assume @xmath95 ( of course , we require @xmath96 for the balls to fit into the lattice at all ! )    for such a lump , @xmath97 can clearly be rewritten in the form @xmath98 ( here we continue to assume some system has been adopted for numbering our balls from @xmath55 to @xmath99 ) and we notice that , for many values of the pair @xmath100 , the prefactor , @xmath101 will itself be of order 1 .",
    "this will be the case if , as is relevant to a ball or lump of `` ordinary matter '' , we take @xmath102 to be of the order of the ratio of the radius of the proton to the bohr radius ( i.e. around @xmath103 ) even for @xmath104 ( @xmath105 ) and in fact , if @xmath106 is @xmath107 ( @xmath108 ) or more ( and it will be much more if we are taking our cube to be a model for a macroscopic lump of ordinary matter as considered in @xcite ) then this prefactor will in fact be a number close in value to 1 . on the assumption that this prefactor is of order 1 ( or very close to 1 )",
    "our question then reduces to the question whether the quantity @xmath109 , this amounts to a question about the quantity is shorthand for @xmath110 . ]",
    "@xmath111 where the product is over all pairs of distinct points of the cubic lattice of points with integer coordinates @xmath112 where @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 range between @xmath55 and @xmath92 ( from now on we shall often simply call such a finite cubic lattice of points a `` cube '' ) and , again , we assume that some system for numbering these points from @xmath55 to @xmath12 has been adopted .",
    "we formulate this question in a precise way by asking whether one can find numbers , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , of order 1 such that @xmath115 it is easy to see that one can satisfy the upper bound by choosing @xmath116 . to see this , notice that each term in the product in @xmath117 is obviously less than or equal to @xmath118 since this is the length of the body - diagonal of the cubic lattice and moreover there are @xmath119 terms in the product .",
    "we thus have that @xmath120 which , since @xmath121 , is clearly less than @xmath122 .",
    "however , as far as we can see , to show that there exists a ( non - zero ) positive @xmath113 such that @xmath123 is a lower bound is not completely trivial because @xmath124 is the @xmath125 power ( i.e. @xmath126 power ) of a product of numbers which range in magnitude from 1 to numbers of order @xmath106 ( the largest of the numbers will of course be @xmath122 ) . nor , to our knowledge",
    ", does it easily follow from any existing standard mathematical result power of the product of all the distances between pairs of distinct points of the set .",
    "( one can show , for example , that the transfinite diameter of a disk is equal to its radius . )",
    "if we allow ourselves to generalize this concept of transfinite diameter to closed bounded regions of _ three_-dimensional euclidean space , then our @xmath124 may be seen to resemble one of the terms in the supremum which would define the transfinite diameter of a cube of side @xmath127 ( except that the @xmath128 power is taken , instead of the @xmath129 power ) . however , our interest is in @xmath124 itself and no supremum is to be taken .",
    "] however , we have succeeded in finding the ( albeit probably not best - possible ) number @xmath130 for which we can prove that it does hold :    @xmath131    ( actually , one can show @xcite , by similar methods to those in the proof of the lower bound below , that if we omit @xmath104 the upper bound of @xmath122 can be reduced to @xmath132 . )",
    "we present our proof of the ( lower bound in ) the proposition in a separate section below . putting this proposition together with @xmath133",
    ", we thus have the following theorem .    for a lump consisting of @xmath99 small balls of mass @xmath8 and radius @xmath9 , centred at the vertices of a cubical region ( as specified above ) of side @xmath16 of a cubic lattice of spacing @xmath14 , @xmath134 ( here",
    ", we recall that @xmath14 is of course assumed to be greater than @xmath15 and @xmath11 , when inserted in place of @xmath3 in @xmath61 , is expected to give a good approximation to the multiplicative factor @xmath135 of @xmath76 if @xmath136 . )",
    "we remark that it is easy to calculate @xmath124 numerically for small values of @xmath106 ( say for @xmath137 ) and the numerical evidence suggests that , for such small values of @xmath106 , @xmath124 is well - approximated by a formula of form @xmath138 , i.e. @xmath139 where @xmath140 and @xmath141 . if it could be proven that there exist exact values for @xmath142 and @xmath143 such that this approximate formula holds for all @xmath106 with an error term which tends to zero as @xmath106 tends to infinity , then this would of course be a stronger result than our proposition above and would , in particular , tell us that our value for @xmath113 , @xmath144 , can be improved to @xmath145 .",
    "however , we have been unable to prove this .",
    "we have already proven the upper bound above , so it remains to prove the lower bound . for this proof ,",
    "we find it useful to write @xmath124 as the product @xmath146 where @xmath147 where the product is over all @xmath81 from @xmath55 to @xmath7 except that the factor with @xmath148 is omitted .",
    "we shall also assume that the numbering of the vertices from @xmath149 to @xmath7 is such that the centre vertex ( with coordinates , as introduced above , @xmath150 ) is numbered @xmath149 .",
    "@xmath151    in terms of our coordinatization of our cube , we need to show that the product    @xmath152 over all distances from an arbitrary lattice point @xmath153 to all the other lattice points in our cube is greater than or equal to the product @xmath154 , to all the other lattice points in our cube .",
    "( to explain the notation here , @xmath155 if @xmath153 are the coordinates of the point numbered @xmath81 .",
    "the inequality of the lemma will then follow by taking the @xmath128 power of each side of the above inequality . )",
    "we will prove this by exhibiting , for each @xmath153 , a one - one onto mapping @xmath156 from ( coordinatized ) lattice points of our cube to themselves with the properties @xmath157 and @xmath158 in fact , given such a mapping we will immediately have @xmath159 where , in the penultimate equality , we have defined @xmath160 to be @xmath161 .    it therefore remains to exhibit a mapping , @xmath156 , with the above properties . to do this",
    ", we define @xmath162 where we use a non - conventional notion of _ addition modulo @xmath163 _ in which @xmath164 is deemed to be @xmath163 rather than @xmath165",
    ". one may understand this definition geometrically as a rigid translation of all the points of our cube where , however , if the would - be destination of a point is outside of our cube , the point instead gets mapped to the counterpart - position in our cubic lattice to the position it would arrive at in a neighbouring cube , were our cube to be surrounded by similar neighbours in a cubic lattice arrangement .",
    "clearly this is a bijection and satisfies ( [ eqn:2.1 ] ) . to show it satisfies ( [ eqn:2.2 ] ) we calculate , using the obvious properties of our notion of `` mod '' : @xmath166 ^ 2 \\nonumber\\\\ \\lo+ \\left [ ( ( \\ell+1-j_2 + i_2 ) ( \\hbox{mod }   \\",

    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    before proceeding with the proofs of the two bounds in our proposition , it will be useful to define , for a given cube ( i.e. cubic lattice of points ) of side @xmath127 , certain special sets of lattice points .",
    "first , we define the `` @xmath167th centre shell '' ( @xmath168 ) to be the set of lattice points on the surface of the cube of side @xmath169 centred on the centre of our given cube ( so that a cube of side @xmath92 would have a total of @xmath106 centre shells ) .",

    "this is given by @xmath173 we first use the lemma to estimate @xmath174 we can rewrite @xmath175 by a relabelling of the lattice points @xmath176 is the coordinate - triple of the @xmath177 lattice point in the @xmath167th centre shell .",
    "each lattice point in the @xmath167th centre shell is at least a distance @xmath167 away from the centre lattice point so we have @xmath178 where @xmath179 from ( [ eqn : suff ] ) , it can be seen that to prove ( [ eqn : cor ] ) it will be sufficient to prove @xmath180 this can be proved by induction on @xmath106 . for all @xmath181 , let @xmath182 be the proposition that ( [ eqn : prop ] ) is true .",
