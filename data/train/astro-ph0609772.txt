    "the implied masses of @xcite are systematically lower for a given bolometric luminosity and effective temperature compared to the models of @xcite .",

    "as the template for cross - correlation we tried using both an observed spectrum ( usually a high - quality keck spectrum ) and a model stellar atmosphere ( * ? ? ?",
    "* tlusty ) of the appropriate effective temperature and gravity .",
    "the model atmosphere is not rotationally broadened to match individual stars in our sample , but in the vast majority of cases the model line widths appear well - matched to the spectra . in most cases ,",
    "the analysis using atmospheric model templates produced smaller velocity uncertainties than either the results from gaussian fitting or cross - correlation with observed spectral templates .",
    "the smaller uncertainties result from the higher signal - to - noise of the model templates and the fact that this method uses the power of many additional spectral features in the templates and data to constrain radial velocities .",
    "varying the gravity and effective temperature of the template produced little or no change in the correlation results .",
    "therefore , we adopt the velocities obtained by cross - correlation with the model atmospheres . table  [ electr.tab ] contains the star name , heliocentric julian date , relative radial velocities , and 1@xmath54 error estimates for each epoch of observation in columns 1    4 respectively .",
    "the uncertainties are calculated within xcsao using the equation ,    @xmath89    where @xmath90 is the fwhm of the correlation peak and @xmath91 is the ratio of the correlation peak height to the amplitude of antisymmetric noise @xcite .",
    "we found that the resultant relative radial velocities and their uncertainties showed good agreement between the two analysis methods .",
    "figures  [ 59comp ] through [ 556comp ] show comparisons of velocities and their uncertainties for an o8v , o9iii , b0v , and b1i star respectively .",
    "these figures demonstrate that there is a strong correlation between velocities obtained with the fitting versus the cross - correlation techniques . frequently , the error bars are smaller for the cross - correlation analysis , especially for evolved stars which have more spectral features that are utilized by cross - correlation methods but not by our gaussian fitting code",
    ". deviations from the 1:1 correspondence are generally consistent with the shown error , indicating that the statistical uncertainties are well - estimated . in most cases",
    ", there is also a zero - point offset of @xmath92  in the sense that the profile - fitted velocities are smaller ( i.e. , more negative ) than the results from cross - correlation .",
    "the magnitude of this offset is similar for both main - sequence and evolved stars .",
    "such a modest offset is not unexpected given that the line centers of the model atmospheres should not necessarily agree with the rest wavelengths of the five h and he lines used by our profile fitting code .    from the initial sample of  possible cyg ob2 stars , we discarded  stars from the sample that had fewer than 3 observations , poor quality spectra or emission lines that interfered with the cross - correlation analysis .",
    "the stars showing emission were discarded because the phenomenon might be time - variable and produce apparent radial velocity variations that mimic the effects of orbital motion .",
    "furthermore , we eliminated a small number ( @xmath93 out of 1139 ) individual spectra with low signal - to - noise ( mostly lick data from a run plagued by clouds ) . the remaining sample used for velocity analysis",
    "consists of  stars .",
    "for the remaining  objects , table  [ veltable.tab ] lists the identification for each star based on  notation ( column 1 ) , the spectral type ( column 2 ) , the number of observations for each star ( column 3 ) , @xmath94 , the weighted average heliocentric velocity ( column 4 ) , @xmath95 , the average of the largest and smallest observed heliocentric velocities ( column 5 ) , @xmath96 , a measure of the velocity semi - amplitude ( column 6 ) , @xmath97 , the velocity dispersion ( column 7 ) , and @xmath98 , the mean velocity uncertainty ( column 8) . @xmath94 and @xmath99 are both measures of the systemic velocity for the star , although both are susceptible in different ways to sampling effects and measurement errors .",
    "@xmath94 would provide a robust measure of the true systemic velocity if the observations uniformly sample all orbital phases in a binary system with zero eccentricity . however , our sparse sampling coupled with the likelihood that some orbits are eccentric renders this measure less than ideal .",
    "@xmath99 provides an alternative measure of the systemic velocity , which is less susceptible to under sampling but may be more prone to measurement uncertainty .",
    "we use both @xmath94 and @xmath99 as indicators of the systemic velocities , and we find that they yield comparable results . @xmath100 and @xmath97 are both measures of the observed velocity variations for a given stellar system .",

    "@xmath97 is another measurement that reflects the level of velocity variations in a system .",
    "we use @xmath98 to describe a characteristic uncertainty averaged over all observations .",
    "there is an additional source of random and/or systematic uncertainty which may contribute to the overall error budget of each measurement .",
    "stellar photospheric line profile variations may be present among some of the most massive stars , especially the evolved stars in our sample ( 31 of  stars or about @xmath626% are post - main - sequence stars ) .",
    "line profile variations attributed to atmospheric pulsations are observed in @xmath10177% of evolved o stars and in some be stars @xcite but rarely among dwarf stars @xcite .",
    "these phenomena could mimic the effects of bona fide orbital velocity variability .",
