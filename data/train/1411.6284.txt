    "the mean field theory provides in principle a fair approximation of time evolved quantum states by many - body schrdinger dynamics in the mean field scaling ; namely when the number of particles is large and the pair interaction potential is proportionally weak . during the last decade",
    ", a strong activity around the mean - field problem has occurred within the community of mathematical physics .",
    "this in particular have led to a rigorous justification of the mean field approximation for singular potentials including coulomb interaction as well as the derivation of the gross - pitaevskii equation from many - body quantum dynamics ( see for instance @xcite and also @xcite for older results ) .",
    "more recently , emphasis has been placed on the speed of convergence of the mean - field approximation .",
    "this seems to be motivated by providing useful quantitative bounds and understanding higher order corrections ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the aim of our article , is to give at the level of a simple model more insight on the aforementioned problem .",
    "actually , the rate of convergence is essentially understood in the case of coherent or factorized type states with a particular structure .",
    "so , we can ask the following natural questions :    * what should we expect if we start from another prepared state which is more correlated ?",
    "* is the specific coherent structure of the known examples important ? * can we determine the optimal rate of convergence in some examples ?",
    "* does the rate of convergence improves under the effect of the quantum dynamics ?    we will show that the rate of convergence at a given time depends essentially on the rate of convergence of all reduced density matrices of the prepared state at time @xmath2 .",
    "in fact , we are able to give a general condition on the prepared state that guaranties a given speed of convergence at any time .",
    "the assumption we require at time zero , which is rather easy to check in initial states , is true at any time if it holds at @xmath2 .",
    "this allows in particular to consider the question of improvement of the convergence over time while the question of optimality will be addressed through numerical analysis .",
    "consider for instance the many - body schrdinger hamiltonian of an @xmath0-boson system [ schrod ] _",
    "n=_i=1^n-_x_i+ _ 1i < jn v(x_i - x_j ) , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 is a real bounded potential satisfying @xmath5 .",

    "a function @xmath8 is symmetric if @xmath9 for any permutation @xmath10 on the symmetric group @xmath11 .",
    "suppose that the system is in a prepared quantum state @xmath12 at initial time @xmath2 ( that is @xmath12 is a non - negative trace class operator with @xmath13=1 $ ] ) .",
    "so , under the action of the schrdinger dynamics the system at time @xmath14 evolves into the state @xmath15 the mean field approximation at the dynamical level is usually understood as the following picture : if the system is in an uncorrelated state @xmath16 , with @xmath17 , at initial time @xmath2 then it will evolve into a state close in some sense to an uncorrelated one @xmath18 when @xmath0 is large and @xmath19 is the solution of the nonlinear hartree equation @xmath20{l }      i\\partial_t \\varphi_t=-\\delta \\varphi_t+(v*\\left|\\varphi_t\\right|^{2})\\varphi_t\\,,\\\\      \\varphi_{t=0}=\\varphi\\ ,",

    "+ in some sense , the mean field approximation says essentially that the measurements [ correl ] , np , for any observable @xmath21 on @xmath26 converge , when @xmath0 goes to infinity while @xmath24 is kept fixed , to some classical or one particle quantities to be determined .",
    "hence , the main quantities to be analyzed are the reduced density matrices of the time evolved states @xmath27 .",
    "recall that for each @xmath28 , the @xmath24-reduced density matrix of @xmath27 is the unique non - negative trace class operator @xmath29 on @xmath30 satisfying [ eq.1 ] = , for any bounded operator @xmath21 on @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , the point is to determine for each @xmath28 the limit and the rate of convergence of these quantities when the number of particles @xmath0 goes to infinity .",
    "it turns out that the limit at @xmath2 may not exist and actually there is a difference between requiring convergence in for all bounded operators @xmath21 on @xmath26 , or convergence for compact operators only , since the weak and weak-@xmath31 topologies differ on the space of trace - class operators .",
    "however , one can characterize all the limit points of @xmath32 with respect to the weak-@xmath31 topology in the space of trace - class operators ( which is the dual space of compact operators ) and also describe their structure .",
    "indeed , at time @xmath2 , we can show that there exists always a subsequence @xmath33 such that for each @xmath34 , @xmath35 , the reduced density matrices @xmath36 converge to non - negative trace - class operators @xmath37 in the weak-@xmath31 topology .",
    "moreover , there exists a borel probability measure @xmath38 on @xmath39 such that @xmath40 in this way we have characterized all the possible limit points via subsequences of the reduced density matrices @xmath32 and identified their structure .",
    "more details are given in subsection [ sub.wigner ] while here we summarize the main result in the proposition below .",
    "we will use often the notation @xmath41 , @xmath42 , to refer to the schatten classes with @xmath43 denoting their norms .",
    "[ definetti ]",
    "let @xmath44 be a sequence of density matrices with @xmath45 for each @xmath46 .",

    "* our result holds true in a more general framework .",
    "we can replace @xmath39 by any separable hilbert space @xmath70 , @xmath71 by any self - adjoint operator @xmath72 , and @xmath4 by any two - particle bounded interaction ( see subsection [ sec.classical-quantum ] ) .",
    "so from now on we will consider this setting , which has the advantage of covering several situations : e.g. either finite or infinite dimensional systems , as well as semi or non relativistic ones . *",
    "the assumption implies that we can apply proposition [ definetti ] and hence obtain the existence of the initial measure @xmath49 at @xmath2 . *",
    "the condition @xmath61 in the main assumption of theorem [ main - th ] can be replaced by @xmath73 at the cost of slightly changing the conclusion , by replacing @xmath74 in by @xmath75 .",
    "* we can apply theorem [ main - th ] backward in time .",
    "so , if the estimates hold true at a given time @xmath14 , then should also hold at time @xmath2 .",
    "this answers the question of improvement of the rate of convergence under the action of the quantum evolution .",
    "indeed , if we suppose that inequalities hold with a faster rate of convergence @xmath76 , @xmath77 , then the `` initial '' estimate should also hold with @xmath76 instead of @xmath78 by backward evolution . *",
    "the proof of theorem [ main - th ] allows to start with a rate of convergence @xmath78 faster than @xmath1 at time @xmath2 .",
    "however , we ca nt recover a better convergence at time @xmath79 .",
    "this is why we have restricted @xmath78 to be of order @xmath0 or less .",
    "however , this feature do not seem to be an artefact of the proof : numerical simulations on product states indicate a @xmath1 order of convergence even when at time @xmath2 the reduced density matrices coincide with their limit .",
    "the mathematical analysis of the mean field limit is quite rich and indeed there are several approaches and techniques applicable to this problem .",
    "for example coherent states analysis @xcite , bbgky hierarchy method @xcite , egorov type theorem @xcite , wigner measures approach @xcite or deviation estimates @xcite .",
    "hence the combination of these different techniques may lead to interesting results .",
    "the proof of our main theorem [ main - th ] relies on two ingredients : an egorov type theorem proved in @xcite and a wigner measures characterization of the limit points of reduced density matrices studied in @xcite .",
    "so the first step is to use second quantization formalism and wick observables , then the result in @xcite provides the asymptotics of time - evolved wick observables as [ int - expa ] e^it _ n b^wick e^-it _ n _ |l^2_s(^dn)=b(t)^wick _ |l^2_s(^dn)+r(n ) , where @xmath80 in some specific sense and where @xmath81 is an infinite sum of wick operators with time - dependent kernels or symbols ( see subsections [ sub.wick ] and [ sub.expansion ] ) .",
    "the mean field expansion gives actually the convergence of the correlation functions ( [ eq.1 ] ) .",
    "so that , if we use the idea of wigner measures extended to this framework in @xcite , we can obtain the rate of convergence for the quantities ( [ eq.1 ] ) .",
    "once this is proved , one can get the announced trace norm estimates for the difference between reduced density matrices .",
    "the article is organized as follows .",
    "the second quantization formalism and wick symbolic calculs is recalled in subsection [ sub.wick ] .",
    "the mean field expansion is explained in subsection [ sub.expansion ] while the the quantum and classical dynamics are introduced in subsection [ sec.classical-quantum ] . in section [ sec : rdm ] , we analyse the relationship between reduced density matrices ( rdm ) and wigner measures and provide the proof of proposition [ definetti ] . our main result is proved in section [ sec.rate ] with some preliminary lemmas .",
    "examples and numerical simulations are discussed in the last section [ sec.ens ] .",
    "the mean field theory is concerned with quantum dynamical systems which preserve the number of particles and can be worked out in the setting of multi - particles schrdinger operators .",
    "nevertheless , it is advantageous to use the more general setting of second quantization , as the reader will notice throughout the following sections .",
    "actually , the hamiltonian can be reformulated as @xmath82 with @xmath83 and @xmath84 a hamiltonian on the symmetric fock space over @xmath85 given by @xmath86 where @xmath87 are the usual creation - annihilation operator - valued distributions , i.e. : @xmath88=\\delta(x - y)\\,,\\;\\ ; [ a^*(x),a^*(y)]=0=[a(x),a(y)]\\,.\\ ] ] our investigation of the mean field approximation for the quantum dynamics is made through the analysis of the hamiltonian .",
    "the strategy relies on a specific schwinger - dyson expansion of the time dependent correlation functions elaborated in @xcite combined to some tools ( wigner measures ) from semiclassical analysis extended to infinite dimensional setting in @xcite .",
    "the schwinger - dyson expansion , called here mean field expansion , is explained in subsection [ sub.expansion ] and leads naturally to the consideration of several multiple commutators which we need to normal order using wick s theorem .",
    "so , for reader convenience we recall some basic results on normal ordering and wick operators written in more systematic and in some sense more efficient way : it makes possible the use of a symbolic calculus , for an algebra of wick operators , similar to the pseudo - differential calculus in finite dimension ( for other presentations of second quantization see @xcite ) .      from now on we will wok in a general setting .",

    "actually , a non - commutative de finetti theorem @xcite due to strmer ( motivated by classification of @xmath237-algebras and type factors ) provides in some sense the structure of these limiting states .",
    "this is more apparent in the work of hudson and moody @xcite where the authors focus on normal states which are also used in our setting .",

    "more recently , the authors lewin , nam and rougerie in @xcite gave an alternative proof of the non - commutative de finetti theorem ( see also @xcite for application of this type of result ) .",

    "actually , the borel probability measures @xmath49 appearing in proposition [ definetti ] is what we call wigner measures of the sequence of density matrices @xmath53 .",
    "this concept is more general and one can deal with arbitrary families of normal states ( or even trace class operators ) on the fock space .",
    "the main advantage is that we can identify these measures @xmath49 by means of simpler quantities involving the weyl operators ( see theorem [ th.wig-measure ] ) according to the formula : @xmath238= \\int_{\\z } e^{i\\sqrt{2 } { \\rm re}\\langle\\xi , z\\rangle } \\ , d\\mu_0(z)\\ , , \\quad\\forall\\xi\\in\\z\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath239 refers to the weyl operator on the fock space @xmath240 with @xmath83 .",
