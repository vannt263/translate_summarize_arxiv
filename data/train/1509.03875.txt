    "gas electron multiplier ( gem ) detectors @xcite are playing an increasing role in the instrumentation of high and medium energy particle physics experiments . a major breakthrough related to the fabrication of gem foil over recent years",
    ", the single mask technique @xcite , has opened the field for large - area and cost effective tracking detectors using gem technology with proven performances such as a spatial resolution better than 70 @xmath2 m , a rate capability higher than 2.5 mhz / @xmath3 and high tolerance to radiation in strong background environment etc .",
    "a one - meter - long , trapezoidal triple - gem prototype , the eic - ft - gem chamber , was assembled at the university of virginia ( uva ) , as part of the tracking and particle identification detector r@xmath0d erd6 program administered at the brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl ) for the future electron ion collider ( eic ) @xcite .",
    "the prototype is a light - weight chamber characterised by its low - mass ( @xmath4 0.4% @xmath5 radiaton length ) material and narrow support frames to minimize the multiple scattering in order to reduce the conversion of background photons to electrons and to minimize dead - to - sensitive area ratio .",
    "it has a distinctive 2d stereo angle readout board with u - v strip configuration for the measurement of 2d coordinates in a cylindrical coordinate system .",
    "we tested the chamber in the high energy hadron beam of the fermilab test beam facility ( ftbf ) in october 2013 , as part of the erd6 sector test beam campaign .",
    "the performance of the chamber in test beam is presented in this paper . in section [ sec : prototype ] , we briefly describe the design of the prototype with an emphasis on the innovative fine pitch u - v strip 2d readout board . in section [ sec : ftbf ] , we describe the ftbf experimental setup with the large - area gem and provide a brief introduction to the readout electronics and the data acquisition system . in section [ sec : characterisation ] , we evaluate the basic performances of the chamber and discuss various technical issues inherent to its large size and novel readout strips . finally , section [ sec : resolution ] is dedicated to the detailed study of the spatial resolution of the chamber and the performances of u - v strip readout board .",
    "the eic - ft - gem chamber has a trapezoidal shape , designed as a sector module in the disk layer configuration of a forward tracker for future collider experiment such as the eic .",
    "it has a new type of 2d readout consisting of two layers of long narrow strips in a stereo - angle ( or u - v strip ) configuration for position measurement of the incoming particles in the cylindrical coordinate system ( r , @xmath1 ) .",
    "the detector has a standard triple - gem design as the compass gem detectors @xcite , which was also adopted for gem trackers used in other experiments @xcite .",
    "it consists of a 3 mm ionization gap between the drift cathode and the top foil of a stack of three gem foils which provides three stages of gas avalanche amplification from the charges of the primary ionization .",
    "the foils in the stack are separated by 2 mm transfer regions .",
    "the induced charge from the drift of the electrons generated at the bottom of the last gem foil are collected on the u - v strip flexible readout board , located 2 mm below the gem stack .",
    "the active area of the gem foil is 100 cm long ( length of the trapezoid ) with the widths of the two parallel sides ( at the inner radius and outer radius sides in a disk layer configuration ) equal to 23 cm and 44 cm respectively .",
    "the 5 @xmath2 m thick cu electrode on the top side of the foil is segmented into 32 high voltage ( hv ) sectors , each approximately 100 @xmath3 in area , separated from adjacent sectors by 100 @xmath2 m wide strips along the radial direction .",
    "the connections of the hv sectors to the power supply are done through 2 @xmath616 electrodes located at the inner and outer radius sides of the foils .",
    "this design , by avoiding hv traces along the radial sides of the gem , allows narrow gem support frames to minimizes the dead - to - sensitive area ratio in a disk layer configuration . a picture of the gem foil , fabricated at the cern printed circuit board ( pcb ) workshop ,",

    "the board is fabricated with the same technique used for the compass 2d readout board @xcite .",
    "the 140 @xmath2 m wide u - strips of the top layer , run parallel to one of the two radial sides of the detector and the 490 @xmath2 m wide v - strips of the bottom layer parallel to the other side .",
    "the different strip widths of top and bottom layers is to ensure an almost equal sharing of charge coming from the same event .",
    "the pitch is equal to 550 @xmath2 m for both top and bottom layers and the angle between u and v strips is equal to 12 . with this design , only the two parallel sides of the chmber connect to the front end ( fe ) electronics .",
    "it is important , specially in the disk layer configuration , to avoid having fe cards along the radial sides or at the back of the chamber in order to reduce the exposure of the electronics to high radiation as well as to minimize the material thickness in the sensitive area .",
    "[ fig : eic_readout ] shows a sketch of the u - v strip readout board . per design ,",
    "half of the strips on each layer have a fixed length of approximately 1005 mm which is equal to the length of the radial side ( see dashed lines on cartoon at the top right of fig . [ fig : eic_readout ] ) and the length of the other half set of strips decreases progressively as one moves towards the opposite side ( straight lines on top right of fig .
