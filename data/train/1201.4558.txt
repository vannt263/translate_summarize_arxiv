    "the understanding that a single partition function can describe different phases of matter , is rather recent and indeed as late as 1930 s , there was not a consensus among physicists that a partition function can give a sharp phase transition .",
    "the works of kramers , wannier , onsager @xcite and others gradually established beyond doubt that in the thermodynamic limit , singular behavior and phase transition can arise from a single partition function based on a single model hamiltonian .",
    "for example the ising hamiltonian can describe both the ordered phase of a ferromagnet and the disordered phase of a paramagnet . near the point of second order phase transition , even the details of the model hamiltonian do not matter and only some general properties like symmetries are important .",
    "+ decades of works on statistical mechanics models , inspired by the above general understanding , has revealed even further fruitful relations between different models . besides the well - known duality relations between the low and high temperature phases of the ising model",
    ", one can also mention the so - called vertex models , which reduce to other models in different limits .",
    "+ one can ask if there are certain statistical mechanical models which are complete , in the sense that their partition function reduce to the partition function of any other model in a suitable limit ?",
    "if this turns out to be the case , then we can imagine a very large space of coupling constants and one single hamiltonian , i.e. the ising model with inhomogeneous couplings , so that when we move through this space , we meet new phases and new models which at present are thought to be completely unrelated .",
    "this will then be another forward in the unification program mentioned above .",
    "+ it seems that the answer to the above question may be positive .",
    "recent results @xcite brought about by merging of ideas from statistical mechanics and quantum information theory , give positive clues in favor of the above idea .",
    "these investigations @xcite have been made possible by establishing a link between statistical mechanics and quantum information on the one - hand and the new paradigm of measurement - based quantum computation ( mqc ) and the universality of cluster states for mqc on the other @xcite .",
    "+ in a series of recent works , it has been shown that the ising model on two dimensional square lattices with complex inhomogeneous nearest - neighbor interactions , is complete in the sense that the partition function of all other discrete models with general @xmath1-body interactions on arbitrary lattices can be realized as special cases of the partition function of ising model on a square lattice which is polynomially or exponentially larger than the original lattice .",
    "the starting point of these developments was the observation in @xcite that the partition function of any given discrete model can be written as a scalar product ,    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is a product state encoding all the coupling constants @xmath4 and @xmath5 is an entangled _ graph _ state , defined on the vertices and edges of a graph , and encoding the geometry of the lattice .",
    "the core concept of completeness is the fact that the @xmath6 cluster state is universal .",
    "more concretely we know that the graph state @xmath7 corresponding to a graph @xmath8 can be obtained from an appropriate cluster state @xmath9 corresponding to a rectangular lattice ( denoted by @xmath10 ) , through a set of adaptive single - qubit measurements @xmath11 . the measurements being single - qubit can be formally written as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a product state encoding the qubits the bases and the results which have been measured .",
    "thus the totality of measurements @xmath11 transforms the cluster state as follows @xmath14 which shows that after disregarding the states of the measured qubits @xmath13 , what is left is an appropriate graph state @xmath15 ) , leads to the completeness result mentioned above .",
    "that is one writes @xmath16 and notes that @xmath17 now encodes a set of generally inhomogeneous pattern of interactions on the cluster state .",
    "therefore one has @xmath18    in this way it has been shown that the 2d ising model with complex inhomogeneous couplings is complete @xcite .",
    "+ like any completeness result , an interesting question is whether there are other complete models .",
    "the situation is reminiscent of results on np completeness of certain problems in computer science @xcite . in this direction",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that the four dimensional @xmath19 lattice gauge theory , with real couplings , is complete for producing any spin model in any dimension .",
    "this result was extended in @xcite to show that the four dimensional @xmath20 lattice gauge theory with real couplings can produce , to arbitrary precision , a large number of continuous models ( those whose hamiltonian allow a finite fourier series ) .",
    "certainly there may be many other complete models which can be converted to each other .",
    "exploration of the set of complete models certainly will add to our insight and to our power in connecting different models with each other .",
    "+ in this paper we show that the discrete form of @xmath0 field theory , on a two dimensional rectangular lattice is also complete in the sense that the partition function of any continuous model on any graph with any type of interaction can be obtained , to arbitrary precision , from a @xmath0 model with in - homogeneous complex couplings on an enlarged 2d lattice .",
    "+ the structure of this paper is as follows : first we gather the necessary ingredients for our analysis in section ( [ 1 ] ) , i.e. elementary facts about continuous variable ( cv ) states , operators and measurements .",
    "we then reconsider in a new language three types of continuous variable stabilizer states , namely the cv kitaev states , the cv extended kitaev states and the ordinary graph states and the relations between them . in section (",
    "[ 3 ] ) we introduce the quantum formalism for scalar field models on arbitrary graphs and investigate properties of these models , properties which are made transparent by using the quantum formalism and are otherwise not easy to unravel . then in section ( [ 5 ] ) , we show that the free field theory on two dimensional rectangular lattice is complete for free theories in the sense that from its partition function , every other free field theory on any graph can be obtained as a special case .",
    "finally we show that the @xmath0 field theory on 2d rectangular lattice is complete , in the sense that its partition function reduces to the partition function of any interacting model on any graph .",
    "as in the ising case , the price that one pays is that the coupling constants of the complete model should be inhomgenuous and complex .",
    "in this section we collect the preliminary materials necessary for generalization of the quantum formalism to the continuous variable ( cv ) case @xcite .",
    "first we review the definition of heisenberg - weyl group , and the way a unitary operator can be performed on cv state ( a qumode ) by measurements of an appropriate graph state .",
    "we end this section with a note on decomposition of cv unitary operators .",
    "the definition of cv stabilizer states starts with generalization of the pauli group to the continuous setting @xcite . for one qumode , ( a term which replaces qubit in the continuous setting ) the resulting group",
    "is called heisenberg - weyl group @xmath21 , whose algebra of generators is spanned by the coordinate and momentum operators satisfying @xmath22=ii$ ] .",
    "thus modulo @xmath20 phases , the group @xmath21 is the group of unitary operators of the form @xmath23 . since the two unitary operators @xmath24 have the simple relation @xmath25 multiplication of any two elements of @xmath21 can be recast in the form @xmath26 modulo a phase .",
    "the heisenbergy - weyl group can be represented on the hilbert space of one particle , spanned by the basis states @xmath27 ( eigenstates of @xmath28 or @xmath29 ( eigenstates of @xmath30 ) . on these states ,",
    "the operators @xmath31 and @xmath32 act as follows : @xmath33 * remark : * hereafter we denote the states @xmath27 simply as @xmath34 and use @xmath29 for eigenstates of @xmath30 as above .",
    "+ the cv hadamard operator is a unitary non - hermitian operator defined as @xmath35 from which we obtain @xmath36 moreover from ( [ had1 ] ) we find @xmath37 which leads to @xmath38",
    ". therefore the square hadamard operator acts as the parity operator .",
    "this means that @xmath39 the @xmath40 mode heisenberg - weyl group is the tensor product of @xmath41 copies of @xmath21 , i.e. @xmath42 and all the above properties are naturally and straightforwardly extended to @xmath41 modes .",
    "of particular interest is the continuous variable @xmath43 operator which is defined as @xmath44 , with the operator expression @xmath45 and satisfying the relation @xmath46 we will also need a more general operator @xmath43 , namely @xmath47 which has the following relation @xmath48      in this subsection , we review how a cv unitary operator can be induced on a mode by measuring a suitable graph state .",
    "here we restrict ourselves to operators diagonal in the coordinate basis , since this is the only type of operators which we encounter in our analysis .",
    "we also use the basic result of mqc that certain states are complete , in the sense that by a suitable sequence of adaptive single - site measurements on them , any other state can be reached .",
    "+ consider a very simple two - mode graph state as shown in figure ( [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the first mode is in an arbitrary state @xmath49 , the second mode is in the state @xmath50 , the two modes have been joined by a cz operator ( shown by a line in figure([fig1 ] ) ) and so the two mode state is @xmath51 where the indices 1 and 2 refer to the modes from left to right in figure ( [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "now we project the first mode on the zero momentum state @xmath52 @xcite",
    ". the state of the second mode will be @xmath53    thus projection of the first mode onto a zero momentum state is equivalent to the action of the hadamard operator on the state @xmath54 and putting it on the second mode .",
    "this is shown in figure ( [ fig1 ] ) , where projection is depicted by a downward arrow and the result is depicted by an upward arrow .",
    "+ suppose now that we project mode 1 onto the state @xmath55 . if we note that @xmath56 and note that @xmath57 commutes with @xmath58 , we find that projecting the first mode on the state @xmath59 is equivalent to the action of the operator @xmath60 on the state @xmath54 and putting it on the second mode .",
    "this is shown in figure ( [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we can write this symbolically as @xmath61 where in the left hand side we show the projections and in the right hand side we show the resulting action on the state . in order to enact the operator @xmath62 , i.e. remove @xmath63 from @xmath60 , we need to enact the operator @xmath63 three times . thus using the symbols in equation ( [ eqp0 ] )",
    ", we have @xmath64 which is shown in figure ( [ fig2 ] ) . + we are now in a position to state a basic theorem @xcite in this section .",
    "+ * thereom : * let @xmath65 be a polynomial of @xmath66 with real coefficients and @xmath54 be an arbitrary state of an appropriate chain of a cluster state . then by projecting the modes of this cluster state on the following three types of states , @xmath67 we can enact any operator of the form @xmath68 on the state @xmath54 , to any desired precision .",
    "the state will appear on the un - projected modes of the chain .",
    "+ * proof : * first we note that enacting the operator @xmath63 comes for free by projecting on the zero momentum state @xmath69 .",
    "second we use the operator identity @xmath70+o(t^2)}.\\ ] ] from projection on the states @xmath71 we find that the operators @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 can be obtained . in view of the existence of the hadamard operator ,",
    "the algebra of anti - hermitian operators in the exponential is generated by the set @xmath75 .",

    "let @xmath84 be a graph , where @xmath82 and @xmath85 respectively denote the set of vertices and edges .",
    "the graph is supposed to admit an orientation . in other words",
    ", @xmath8 is the triangulation of an orientable manifold .",
    "this means that all the simplexes of @xmath8 inherit the orientation of the original manifold in a consistent way .",
    "the number of vertices and edges are respectively given by @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "+ in this section we define three closely related continuous variable states pertaining to a given graph @xmath8 , which we call the kitaev state @xmath88 @xcite , the extended kitaev state @xmath89 and the graph state @xmath5 @xcite",
    ". we will then determine the mutual relationships of these states , which will play an important role in our proof of completeness .",
    "these are the generalizations of known states in the qubit case , where they have been possibly named differently in other works .",
    "for example in the qubit case , extended kitaev states have been called pseudo graph states @xcite , however in view of their explicit construction and stabilizers , we think that the name kitaev or extended kitaev states are more appropriate for them .",
    "+ the crucial difference between the continuous and qubit case is the fact that the operators @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 are not equal to their inverses",
    ". therefore a consistent and unambiguous description of these states on a graph , requires that the graphs be decorated with weights and/or orientations .",
    "we emphasize the difference between orientation , which is a @xmath19 variable and weight which is a real variable .",
    "we will meet the necessity of each as we go along in our definitions .",
    "consider an oriented graph @xmath94 , where @xmath95 means that arbitrary orientations have been assigned to the edges .",
    "any collection of arbitrary orientations on the edges is called a decoration of the graph .",
    "we assume that modes live only on the edges @xmath85 and there are no modes on the vertices @xmath82 of this graph . the cv kitaev state is then defined @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the edge which goes from the vertex @xmath98 to the vertex @xmath99 .",
    "+ it is easily verified that this state is stabilized by the following set of operators : for each vertex @xmath100 , we have @xmath101 where @xmath102 denotes the set of edges incident on the vertex @xmath103 and the @xmath104 and @xmath105 signs are used for edges going into and out of a vertex respectively .",
    "the reason that @xmath106 stabilizes the state ( [ eqg ] ) is that it simply shifts the variable @xmath107 which will be neutralized under the integration .",
    "also for each face of the graph , we have @xmath108 where @xmath109 denotes the set of edges in the boundary of @xmath110 and the @xmath105 and @xmath104 signs are used respectively when the orientation of a link is equal or opposite to us when we traverse a face in the counter - clockwise sense .",
    "note that traversing all the plaquettes in this sense is meaningful for an orientable traingulation . here also the effect of @xmath111 on the state inside the integral is to multiply it by a unit factor since the phases acquired by all the edges add up to zero for a closed loop .",
    "+ as an example , we have for the graph @xmath112 in figure ( [ fig4 ] ) , @xmath113 where the subscripts @xmath114 to @xmath115 , determine the position of modes in the state .",
    "the stabilizers of this state are then given by ( [ eqa],[eqb ] ) as follows :    @xmath116    and @xmath117    finally we note that all kitaev states on a given graph , corresponding to different decorations are related to each other by local unitary actions .",
    "in fact if we switch the arbitrary orientation on a link @xmath97 , it means that the term @xmath118 in ( [ eqg ] ) changes to @xmath119 where the remaining parts of the state will remain intact . in view of ( [ h ] ) , this switching is achieved by a local action of the square hadamard operator @xmath120 on the edge @xmath115 .",
    "we can thus write @xmath121 therefore all the kitaev states with different decorations belong to the same class of states modulo local actions of square hadamard operations .",
    "+ in view of the shift invariance @xmath122 , the kitaev state has a hidden multiplicative factor which is in fact infinite .",
    "this symmetry can be removed by fixing a gauge ( in the discrete case this is a finite factor which causes no problem ) .",
    "therefore we will define the gauge - fixed kitaev state , denoted by @xmath123 as follows : @xmath124 this gauge - fixed kitaev state has still the same set of stabilizers . the same reasoning for the kitaev state @xmath88 also works here .",
    "let @xmath94 be defined as in previous subsection .",
    "now in addition to the modes on the edges , there are also modes on vertices , as in figure ( [ fig5 ] ) . on such a graph , there are thus two different sets of vertices , which we denote by @xmath82 ( the ones on the nodes ) and @xmath125 ( the ones on the edges ) . then the state @xmath89 is given by @xmath126 where @xmath97 is the edge which goes from vertex @xmath98 to @xmath99 .",
    "as an example for the graph in figure ( [ fig5 ] ) , we have @xmath127 the stabilizers of this extended kitaev state are completely different from the simple kitaev state .",
    "in fact they are : for each vertex @xmath128 , @xmath129 where the convention for the @xmath130 signs is the same as in kitaev state and for each edge @xmath131 which goes from @xmath132 to @xmath133 ,    @xmath134    where again we have suppressed the continuous arguments of these stabilizers for ease of notation . for the example given in figure ( [ fig5 ] ) ,",
    "some of the stabilizers are : @xmath135      finally we come to the definition of continuous variable weighted graph states . here as in the qubit case we start with an initial product state of the form @xmath136 .",
    "however there is an important difference in that on each edge , instead of the simple @xmath92 operator , we can act by the @xmath137 operator where the real parameter @xmath4 may depend on the edge .",
    "therefore we obtain what we call a weighted graph state . denoting the collection of all weights by @xmath4",
    ", we have @xmath138 where @xmath136 . the explicit form of the state will then be given by @xmath139 where @xmath140 is the number of vertices and @xmath141 denotes the edge connecting the vertices @xmath98 and @xmath99 carrying weight @xmath142 . note that in contrast to a decorated edge which is denoted by @xmath97 ( going from @xmath98 to @xmath99 ) , a weighted edge is denoted by the symmetric symbol @xmath143 . according to ( [ eqcz ] )",
    ", the stabilizers of this state will be of the form @xmath144 where in the left hand side we have suppressed the dependence on the weights for simplicity . + we emphasize that definition of the kitaev states and extended kitaev states require the underlying graph to be decorated , while a graph state needs only a weighted graph for its unambiguous definition .",
    "we are now left with an important question of whether there is a simple relation between the above three kinds of states or not .",
    "the answer turns out to be positive and is explained in the next subsection .",
    "consider the extended kitaev state corresponding to a decorated graph @xmath94 .",
    "the explicit form of the state is shown in ( [ eqeg ] ) . from ( [ eqeg ] ) it is clear that if we project all the vertices in @xmath82 on the zero - momentum basis , we will arrive at the kitaev state for the same graph .",
    "more explicitly we have @xmath145 where @xmath136 , and we have explicitly indicated the decoration @xmath95 .",
    "+ it is instructive to understand this in an alternative way , that is by showing that measurement in the momentum basis actually transforms the stabilizer set of the extended kitaev state , i.e. @xmath146 to the stabilizer set of the kitaev state , @xmath147 . from the stabilizer formalism we know that measurement of a state @xmath148 in the basis of an operator @xmath149 , removes all the operators which do not commute with @xmath149 from the set @xmath150 and leaves us with a smaller subset .",
    "this subset is generated by all the original generators or their products thereof which commute with @xmath149 .",
    "having this in mind , it is straightforward to see that measurement in the momentum ( the @xmath31 basis ) leaves all the vertex stabilizers @xmath151 intact ( except of course removing the vertex @xmath152 from it ) , hence changing it to @xmath106 as in ( [ eqa ] ) .",
    "however since @xmath152 does not commute with @xmath153 , measurements of all the vertices remove all the generators @xmath154 .",
    "the only combinations which survive this elimination will be their product around any faces .",
    "these are nothing but the operators @xmath155 for all faces , which are just the right stabilizers of @xmath156 .",
    "+ let us now study the relation between the extended kitaev states and graph states .",
    "it turns out that there is a simple relation between the two only if the weights of the edges incident on each vertex add up to zero , that is , if @xmath157 since @xmath158 , this means also that @xmath159 .",
    "in such a case we can convert an extended kitaev state to a weighted graph state on the same graph by suitable measurements on the edges . to this end",
    "we proceed as follows : let us project each edge @xmath97 of the extended kitaev state on the state @xmath160 defined in ( [ eqquad ] ) . + let @xmath161 , then we have @xmath162 if we choose the parameters @xmath163 of quadratures so that @xmath164 , we find @xmath165 which is a weighted graph state with weights @xmath166 assigned to each edge @xmath167 + note that from the kitaev state for the rectangular lattice @xmath168 , the kitaev state for any other graph @xmath88 can be obtained simply by measurement of the edge modes in the momentum or coordinate bases .",
    "in fact projecting an edge mode on the zero - momentum state @xmath169 removes that link from the graph while projecting it on the zero coordinate state @xmath170 merges the two endpoints of that edge .",
    "these are shown in figure ( [ fig6 ] ) and are proved as follows :    let @xmath171 where @xmath172 denotes all the edges which involve neither the vertex @xmath173 nor @xmath174 .",
    "projecting this state on the state @xmath175 on the edge @xmath176 , leaves us with @xmath177 which is nothing but the same kitaev state with the edge @xmath178 totally removed . on the other hand projecting @xmath179 on the state @xmath180 on the edge @xmath178 ,",
    "leaves us with @xmath181    which means that the two endpoints of the edge @xmath178 have been merged together . with these two simple rules of deleting and merging one",
    "can obtain the kitaev state of any graph starting from the one on the rectangular lattice .",
    "figure ( [ fig7 ] ) shows an important example in which measurements of some of the edges in the momentum basis ( and hence removing them ) , transforms @xmath168 to the kitaev state on the hexagonal lattice @xmath182 .",
    "measurement of the same edges in the coordinate basis ( and hence merging the two endpoints ) produces a uniform lattice whose faces are triangles , hence a triangular lattice .",
    "this is in accord with the fact that the hexagonal and triangular lattice are dual to each other , a subject which will be explored further in the sequel .",
    "+ finally we use the well - known universality of cluster states proved in the context of measurement - based quantum computation @xcite to state that both the kitaev state @xmath88 and the extended kitaev state @xmath89 can be obtained by gaussian measurements from a sufficiently large cluster state @xmath9 .",
    "the fact that the measurements need only be gaussian is due to the fact that all these kinds of states are stabilized by subgroups of @xmath183 and hence they can be converted to each other by unitary operators belonging to the clifford group .",
    "using the well - known fact from mqc , that clifford operators can be implemented by gaussian measurements , we arrive at the proof of the above statement .",
    "in this section we show how the partition function of a classical model defined by a hamiltonian on a continuous variables on an arbitrary graph , can be expressed in the quantum formalism .",
    "first consider the case where there is no local term or on - site interaction , that is the hamiltonian is of the form @xmath184 where @xmath185 is an arbitrary function .",
    "we allow for the function @xmath186 to depend on the edge @xmath97 in order to cover also the inhomogeneous cases .",
    "the partition function of this model is , @xmath187 where @xmath140 is number of vertices and we have absorbed the parameter @xmath188 in the hamiltonian .",
    "we will do this in all expressions of partition functions which follow . + * remark : * we have defined the partition function in the form ( [ zk ] ) , in order to be able to deal with unitary operators in the measurement based quantum computation . dealing with non - unitary operators",
    "does not pose any problem in the ising model @xcite , since states like @xmath189 are normalizable states . in the continuous case",
    "the analogue of the above state may be non - normalizable , rendering the projection to such states problematic .",
    "instead we resort to partition functions of the type ( [ eqih ] ) with the understanding that the final results , like dualities , and completeness can be analytically continued to the whole complex plane .",
    "+ due to the shift invariance of the hamiltonian @xmath190 , the above partition function is infinite , so we have to modify the partition function by fixing a gauge , which we will do later on . for the present we deal with the above partition function as it is . defining the product state @xmath191 is defined on the edge @xmath97 , one can then write the partition function ( [ zk ] ) in the quantum formalism as @xmath192 where @xmath193 is the kitaev state on the graph @xmath8 ( [ eqg ] ) . in this way , as in the qubit case , the pattern of interactions is encoded in the entangled kitaev state and the strength of interactions ( including the temperature ) are encoded into the product state @xmath3 . to fix the shift invariance",
    "we define a gauge - fixed partition function as @xmath194 note that other forms of gauge fixing terms are possible , but we will deal with this simple one .",
    "also note that the shift invariance is also present in discrete models , however in those cases the multiplicative factor is finite and not divergent , hence gauge fixing is not necessary . using the gauge - fixed kitaev state ,",
    "we can write this in the quantum formalism as @xmath195    let us now consider an edge @xmath115 and insert the operator @xmath196 inside the inner product ( [ zk0 ] ) . in view of ( [ eq21 ] ) and ( [ zk0 ] ) we will have @xmath197 where by @xmath198 , we mean the statistical thermal average .",
    "similarly by acting the momentum operator on the state @xmath3 , we find , @xmath199 where by @xmath200 we mean derivative with respect to the argument .",
    "we will later see an important application of these equations when they are combined with the topological properties of the kitaev states .",
    "+ consider now the case where there are on - site interactions , then the hamiltonian will be @xmath201 and the above formalism will be extended as follows : @xmath202 where @xmath203 in which @xmath204 . +",
    "let us now try to understand some of the properties of a continuous variable statistical model through the quantum formalism .",
    "certainly the results that we will find , like duality , can also be derived by other means , without resorting to the quantum formalism , however this scheme make these properties and their derivation much more transparent .",
    "consider a graph @xmath84 and a hamiltonian @xmath205 defined on it without local potentials , @xmath206 .",

    "note that the other kind of loop operator , @xmath215 defined as @xmath216 where @xmath217 is a loop in the graph , does nt lead to a non - trivial relation since in view of ( [ eqqe ] ) , insertion of this operator into the inner product leads to the quantity @xmath218 which identically vanishes .",

    "we have @xmath225 where    @xmath226    where @xmath227    this gives the following duality relation @xmath228 where @xmath229 is the fourier transform of @xmath230 , as given in ( [ eqdual ] ) .",
    "an example of interest is when @xmath231 which leads to the following duality relation @xmath232",
    "in this section we use the quantum formalism to show that the discrete form of two dimensional @xmath0 field theory is complete . before proceeding",
    "we should make precise the meaning of the above statement . by the two dimensional discrete @xmath0 theory , we mean the following hamiltonian on a two dimensional square lattice with periodic boundary conditions @xmath233 where @xmath234 and the real parameters @xmath235 , @xmath236 and @xmath237 denote respectively the inhomogeneous external field , the quadratic ( mass term ) and quartic coupling strengths .",
    "the linear terms @xmath238 are also necessary for completeness .",
    "denote the partition function of this model by @xmath239 where @xmath240 is a 2d square lattice of size @xmath140 , and @xmath241 , @xmath242 and @xmath243 denote the totality of all the inhomogeneous coupling strengths . by completeness",
    "we mean that the partition function of any other model @xmath244 on any graph @xmath84 is equal to the partition function for the hamiltonian @xmath245 on the 2d square lattice , for some specifically chosen sets @xmath241 , @xmath242 and @xmath243 .",
    "+ note that the interaction terms in the hamiltonian @xmath63 are not necessarily of nearest neighbor type .",
    "in fact as we will show in the proof , @xmath63 can even contain @xmath246 body interactions , as long as @xmath1 is bounded above by a finite constant independent of @xmath86 .",
    "+ consider a general hamiltonian of the form ( [ eqgener ] ) .",
    "the partition function of this model can be written in the quantum formalism as @xmath247 where @xmath248 and @xmath249 note that @xmath250 lives on the edge vertex @xmath251 and @xmath252 lives on the vertex @xmath98 . rewriting the above states in the form @xmath253 where @xmath254 is the zero momentum eignestate",
    ", we find an equivalent form for the partition function , namely @xmath255 where @xmath256 is the product of all zero - momentum states on the edge vertices and ordinary vertices of the graph @xmath8 .",
    "we now note that according to ( [ eqquad ] ) , we can approximate the unitary operators @xmath257 and @xmath258 to any degree of precision by a product of the operators @xmath63 ( the hadamard ) , @xmath259 , @xmath260 and @xmath261 . as explained in ( [ sec0 ] ) , implementation of these operators on a state",
    "is effected by suitable possibly non - gaussian measurements ( i.e. projections of vertex modes on the states @xmath262 ) of an appropriate enlargement of that state , i.e. one simply adds necessary nodes , glues them by @xmath92 operators and measures the additional nodes as exemplified in figure ( [ fig2 ] ) to affect a desired unitary gate on the original qumode of the lattice .",
    "let us denote this intermediate graph by @xmath263 , its associated state by @xmath264 , and the collection of all necessary measurements on it by @xmath265 , then we will have @xmath266 the configuration of the graph @xmath263 may be complicated , but the important point is that @xmath264 is nothing but a stabilizer state and hence in principle it can be obtained from a cluster state by gaussian measurements @xmath267 .",
    "therefore we have latexmath:[\\[\\label{79 }    the projections have been performed on the vertices of the cluster state .",
    "the cluster state @xmath9 can be a weighted cluster state where the weights of all edges are @xmath269 and for each vertex the weights of all edges add up to @xmath270 .",
    "such a cluster state can be obtained from an extended kitaev state on the rectangular lattice by projecting all the edge - vertices on the states @xmath271 according to whether the weights of the edges are @xmath272 or @xmath273 .",
    "this is the only place where projections are made on the edge vertices , and in fixed directions ( i.e. eigenstates of @xmath274 ) .",
    "we write this symbolically in the form @xmath275 ) and ( [ 80 ] ) we finally arrive at @xmath276 where @xmath277 encapsulates all the measurements @xmath278 which are performed on the edges of the extended kitaev state , and @xmath265 represents all the projections @xmath279 for @xmath280 on the vertices . putting all this together we finally arrive at the result that @xmath281 it is important to note that since the edge vertices are measured in the @xmath282 bases and the resulting edge is projected on the eigenstates @xmath283 , the interactions between neighboring vertices in the complete model is restricted to be of the type @xmath284 . in this way all the couplings in the original model have been transferred to the mass and potential terms on the vertices . + as a byproduct this argument shows that when the original model has only quadratic couplings ( i.e. it is free field ) , then there is no linear or quartic coupling in the model on the rectangular lattice which reduces to this model by gaussian measurements .",
    "this means that the free field theory on the 2d rectangular lattice is complete and can produce any other field theory on any lattice .",
    "+ it is a simple matter to show that the @xmath0 theory can also reproduce models with @xmath246 body interactions .",
    "we know from @xcite , that the 4d @xmath20 lattice gauge theory is complete .",
    "therefore it is enough to show that @xmath0 theory can reduce to @xmath285 @xmath20 lattice gauge theory .",
    "the hamiltonian of the latter model is given by    @xmath286    where @xmath287 denotes a plaquette , @xmath288 denotes the coupling constant on @xmath287 , and @xmath289 s are the continuous variables around @xmath287 . the indices @xmath290 and @xmath291 denotes the edges of @xmath287 when traversed in clockwise direction .",
    "the point is that the partition function of such a model can again be written as a scalar product @xmath292 , with @xmath3 a product state over all plaquettes , @xmath293 and @xmath294 a new stabilizer state , @xmath295 if we now note that @xmath296 can be written as @xmath297 and the latter operator can indeed be expanded to any desired accuracy in terms of @xmath73 and @xmath74 , the assertion will be proved along the same line as indicated above .",
    "+ _ efficiency : _ it is shown in @xcite that simulating the partition function of any ising or potts type model on an arbitrary graph can be done on the ising model on a square lattice with only a polynomial overhead in the number of spins . for more general models",
    "however , an exponential overhead may be needed .",
    "a similar statement is true also in our case , namely for simulating the partition function of a model with nearest neighbor interactions on a graph with @xmath140 vertices , we need a @xmath0 model on a cluster state with @xmath298 vertices where @xmath298 is a polynomial of @xmath140 .",
    "this result is a combination of the universality result of cluster states which by only a polynomial overhead can produce any other quantum state and the fact that any quantum unitary @xmath299 can be decomposed to a product of polynomial number of unitaries of the form @xmath300 , with @xmath301 to any degree of precision .",
    "this result is also true when each site interacts with a finite number @xmath1 of its neighbors , where @xmath1 is independent of @xmath140 . for more general models , an exponential overhead in the number of sites ,",
    "will be necessary like the case of ising model .",
    "the concept of completeness of certain statistical models is very fascinating .",
    "the idea that in principle a single complete model , like the 2d ising model in its rich phase structure , various phases of all the other models , regardless of their lattice structure , type of order statistical variables and order parameter , and the interactions , is an idea which needs much exploration in the future .",
    "one of the basic questions is that what other types of models are complete . in this paper",
    "we have shown that the @xmath0 field theory is a complete model .",
    "like the case of ising model @xcite or the @xmath20 lattice gauge theory @xcite , our proof is an existence proof at present .",
    "the next step in such a program will be to show how other specific models can be obtained from these complete models and what insight about them can be obtained . like",
    "the existence proof itself , this step relies also heavily on techniques from quantum information theory , notably the measurement - based quantum computation .",
    "in particular it will be very desirable to formulate an algorithmic approach for deriving any specific model ( its graph structure and coupling strengths ) from a complete model . in this way",
    "apparently unrelated models will be linked to each other and the insight gained from this approach will have far reaching consequences in statistical mechanics , exactly solvable models and critical phenomena . + * acknowledgements : * the authors would like to thank a. rezakhani , l. memarzadeh for valuable discussions .",
