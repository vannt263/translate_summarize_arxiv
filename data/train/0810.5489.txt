    "string theory and the subsequent idea of branes have been , in recent years , the almost standard theory describing the physics of quantum space - time , especially near the big bang or even before it @xcite .",
    "the discovery of the relation between anti - de sitter space physics and conformal field theories on the boundary of that space , the so - called ads / cft correspondence @xcite implied further interest in the structure of the string - membrane theory .    the @xmath0-brane extended solutions are considered fundamental in the understanding of the non - perturbative string theory regime . they interpolate @xmath3 and @xmath4-dimensional minkowski space - time @xcite .",
    "this connection was important for the conjecture presented by maldacena in 1997 @xcite , which opened the way for the gravitation - field theory dualities . in this context , a better understanding of the perturbative dynamics of the @xmath0-brane solutions are relevant for the structural aspects of the ads / cft correspondence and its latter extensions .",
    "such extensions can provide new hints about yang - mills theory with special interest in what concerns the difficult question of a quark gluon plasma , see for instance @xcite . besides , in the framework of ads / cft correspondence it is possible to study the glueball mass spectrum analyzing the dynamics of a scalar field in the near horizon limit of the black @xmath0-brane solutions @xcite .",
    "the poles of the retarded function of the simplest glueball state , generated by the operator @xmath5 , are the quasinormal modes of the dual ads black hole in the corresponding near horizon limit .",
    "a fundamental feature of the @xmath0-brane backgrounds is the possible existence of event horizons . in this sense",
    ", they may be viewed as generalizations of the usual four - dimensional black holes .",
    "perturbations of black hole solutions are well known @xcite and several numerical methods exist , being under full control to handle the information gathered from such perturbations @xcite .",
    "we intend here to first define a perturbation of a @xmath0-brane solution using standard separation of variables and subsequently treat , analytically and numerically , the wave equation for the scalar perturbation .",
    "the employed methods are largely independent , aiming to a cross - check of the results",
    ". we also consider gauge - invariant gravitational perturbations .",
    "the results turn out to be exactly the same as scalar case .",
    "one very recent work complement our analysis presented here @xcite .",
    "but although the presented work and @xcite are complementary and relevant in terms of the ads / cft correspondence , they treat different geometries and focus on different issues . the results presented in this paper address directly the role of the brane structure ( in the sense presented in @xcite ) on the gravitation - field theory duality , specifically searching for possible instabilities .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "ii provides reviews @xmath0-brane background considered in this work . in sec .",
    "iii , the perturbative dynamics is formulated and developed , followed by sec .",

    "solutions of ten dimensional supergravity describing the so - called @xmath0-branes are well known .",

    "the curvature singularity is located at @xmath50 and the metric does not have an extension if @xmath36 .",
    "we have a curvature singularity , but its structure depends on the value of @xmath0 . if @xmath51 the singularity is time - like , and the proper definition of a cauchy problem is delicate . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath52 , the singularity ( @xmath50 ) is null @xcite , and therefore much milder . in spite of the absence of a event horizon , the manifold is globally hyperbolic , and the wave problem is well - posed . for the extreme case and @xmath38 , there an analytic continuation of the metric beyond @xmath50 and we have again a black hole solution as pointed out in @xcite .",
    "we initially consider a massless scalar field in the background of our 10-dimensional solution .",
    "we will show in the following that this scenario is more general .",
    "this perturbation is described by the klein - gordon equation @xmath53 where the first term refers to the subspace @xmath54 and the second to the bulk coordinates @xmath55 .",
    "we denote the angular coordinates in @xmath56 and @xmath57 respectively by by @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "such equation can be separated by the ansatz @xmath60 , where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the well known spherical harmonics in @xmath63 and @xmath64 dimensions respectively @xcite , resulting in the differential equations @xmath65r_{l}=0,\\\\\\ ] ] @xmath66 where @xmath67 $ ] .",
    "moreover , @xmath68 is a constant arising from the brane \\{@xmath69 , @xmath58 } and bulk \\{@xmath70 , @xmath19 , @xmath71 } variables separation .",
    "moreover , @xmath72 is a differential operator given by @xmath73    the solution of equation ( [ eq_brana ] ) is @xmath74 , with @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 being constants , @xmath78 and @xmath79 the bessel functions .",
    "finiteness at origin implies @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "therefore , @xmath68 has a continuous spectrum of allowed values , and we notice in ( [ eq_bulk ] ) that the its square acts as a mass for the klein - gordon field .",
    "performing the same analysis for a time independent scalar field in the near horizon limit of the metric ( [ metrica ] ) , the @xmath82 parameter can be interpreted as the glueball mass .",
    "a `` time independent approach '' can be explored expanding the function @xmath83 with a laplace - like transform @xcite . within this approach",

    "we can also consider the problem of the linear perturbations using the gauge - invariant formalism proposed by ishibashi _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "in this formalism we expand the gravitational perturbations in terms of tensor harmonics @xmath92 , and perturbations of einstein equations are expressed as a group of equations for gauge invariant quantities .",
    "such quantities are grouped in three types : tensor , vector and scalar . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "we only consider in the following the tensor sector of gravitational perturbations .",
    "the spacetime is considered as describing an @xmath93-dimensional manifold @xmath94 , which is locally written as the warped product @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the metric of an @xmath97-dimensional maximally symmetric space of constant spatial curvature , and @xmath98 the metric of an arbitrary @xmath99-dimensional space time .    following reference @xcite the following equation for the gauge - invariant quantity @xmath100",
    "can be obtained : @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the dalembert operator written on the metric @xmath98 . introducing in the above equation the master variable @xmath103 we found the same result that we have already obtained from the scalar klein - gordon equation .    at this point",
    "it is appropriate to make the following important observation : the spectrum of quasinormal frequencies for the scalar field perturbations contains extra modes with respect to the tensor perturbations , because the modes for the last case only appears for multipole numbers equal or greater than 2 .",
    "thus , for the black @xmath0-brane , we need only to consider a test scalar field perturbation . extracting the @xmath104 terms for the obtained spectrum of scalar quasinormal frequencies ,",
    "we obtain the spectrum for the tensor gravitational perturbations .",
    "the effective potentials derived above determine the perturbative dynamics . of particular importance for this dynamics are the quasi normal modes .",
    "they are defined as solutions of the wave equations which satisfy the in - going and out - going boundary conditions .",
    "these modes are particularly relevant in the intermediate time behavior of the perturbation .    with arbitrary @xmath105",
    ", two different and independent numerical tools will be used in this work to calculate the quasinormal frequencies : a `` frequency domain '' approach based on a sixth order wkb technique@xcite , and a `` time domain '' method based on a numerical characteristic integration scheme @xcite .",
    "both algorithms are well established .",
    "the wkb expressions are usually accurate and straitforward . but",
    "the approach is not generally applicable .",
    "for instance , in fig .",
    "[ potencial_beta_diff_zero ] the effective potencial is presented for a few values of @xmath68 with @xmath106 .",
    "we observe that the maximum of the effective potential decreases as @xmath68 increases for a given @xmath0 . for a sufficiently large value of @xmath68",
    "the potential becomes negative .",
    "this behavior appears explicitly for @xmath51 with @xmath107 .",
    "therefore , we can not obtain the quasinormal frequencies for all values of @xmath0 and @xmath68 using the wkb formula .",
    "the instability for effective potentials that exhibit a negative gap is not excluded @xcite .",
    "direct time integration can be used for such scenarios .",
    "_ we have found no instabillities after an extensive exploration with @xmath108 . _    within the `` time - domain '' approach , we have observed the usual picture in the perturbative dynamics .",
    "after the initial transient regime , the quasinormal mode phase follows as well as a late - time tail .",
    "the tail phase is strongly dependent on the value of the parameter @xmath68 . for @xmath109",
    ", we have a non - oscillatory power - law decay .",
    "but if @xmath110 , the tail is oscillatory , with a power - law envelope .",
    "typical profiles are shown in fig .",
    "[ profiles ] .",
    "+    given the potential , we use the sixth order wkb technique @xcite to obtain the quasinormal frequencies @xmath111 . from the numerical data @xmath112 , it is possible to estimate the fundamental quasinormal frequency with reasonable accuracy .",
    "some results from both methods are given in tables [ frequencies1 ] , [ frequencies2 ] and [ high_overtone ] for @xmath109 .",
    "the concordance between them is good .",
    "however , notice that for @xmath51 and @xmath113 , our result should be taken with reservation .",
