    "the latter potential is strongly suppressed in the isotopically neutral region ( number of protons = number of neutrons ) @xcite .    in the following sections i will calculate the ` gravitational current ' , @xmath74 , for a static as well as for a rotating star .",
    "the geometry in a spherically symmetric , static spacetime can be globally represented by the schwarzschild coordinate system @xmath75 .",
    "msw transitions in a schwarzschild metric have already been discussed in ref .",

    "it is common to write @xmath79 and @xmath80 , where the schwarzschild radius @xmath81 and @xmath82 is the central gravitating mass .",
    "the energy - like component of the four - momentum is the energy and a conserved quantity : @xmath83 .",
    "the energy measured by a locally inertial observer is @xmath84 ; i.e. , the energy of the neutrino suffers a gravitational redshift by @xmath85 @xcite .",
    "thus the resonance conditions are merely altered by setting @xmath48 equal to @xmath86 , and @xmath78 .    for a particular transition one can define a helicity mixing angle , @xmath87 , which diagonalises the corresponding submatrix in the hamiltonian ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for instance , for the transition @xmath65 , the mixing angle is defined by :    @xmath88    the adiabaticity parameter corresponding to a particular transition , @xmath89 , quantifies the magnitude of the off - diagonal elements compared to the diagonal ones of @xmath56 in the basis of the instantaneous eigenstates . at the resonance point",
    "it must be greater than 1 for adiabatic propagation .",
    "@xmath89 is modified by relativistic effects , and for the case @xmath65 , can be written as :    @xmath90    where the logarithmic derivative is evaluated at the resonance position .",
    "thus the adiabaticity of the evolving neutrino is affected by the spatial dependence of the metric , which appears for example in the determination of the local energy .",

    "rotation of the collapsing star will cause a dragging of the inertial frames and will result in off - diagonal terms in the metric @xmath15 .",
    "these off - diagonal terms can now flip the spin of the neutrinos by transferring the angular momentum of the star to the neutrino spin . using perturbation theory",
    "one can write down a metric to first order in the angular velocity of rotation @xmath93 of the central mass ( e.g. , see @xcite ) : @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the local precession frequency and can be written as @xmath96 @xcite , where @xmath97 is identified with the angular momentum of the central gravitating mass . here",
    "it is assumed that the angular momentum vector of the star , @xmath98 , is aligned with the polar axis .",
    "the metric of eq .",
    "( [ 20 ] ) is valid as long as the rotation is slow , i.e. , for @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the radius of the central mass .    in this metric purely radial motion",
    "is only possible along the axis of rotation as expected from symmetry considerations . from these same considerations",
    "it is also evident that motion in a plane is only possible in the equatorial plane .",
    "however , here i will confine myself to nearly radial trajectories and work in the weak - field limit so that the curvature of the neutrino path can be neglected .",
    "thus one finds from eqs .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) and ( [ 20 ] ) :    @xmath101    for relativistic neutrinos moving radially outwards ( i.e. @xmath102 ) .",
    "it can be noted that for propagation in the equatorial plane the ` gravitational current ' is still zero .",
    "but at any other polar angle there will now be an additional term in the hamiltonian which will shift the resonance position and modify the adiabaticity conditions . in eqs .",
    "( [ 17 ] ) and ( [ 18 ] ) one can then simply replace @xmath103 by @xmath104 .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xmath105 changes sign at the equator and could thus lead to an asymmetry in the neutrino emission .",
    "it is evident from eq .",
    "( [ 21 ] ) that the ` gravitational current ' moves the resonance point closer to the center of the sn in the upper hemisphere and farther away in the lower hemisphere .",
    "the magnitude of this effect will be discussed in the following section .",
    "simple angular momentum arguments suggest high angular velocities for neutron stars , which have also been verified by observations . during collapse to a neutron star",
    "the angular velocity of a typical star will increase from about @xmath106 to @xmath107 .",
    "1 shows the absolute magnitudes of the various components in the hamiltonian given by eq .",
    "( [ 9 ] ) for a neutrino propagating in a typical sn environment .",
    "i consider here the case when the proto - neutron star is rotating , as @xmath108 otherwise .",
    "the neutrino is assumed to move radially along the polar axis .",
    "the matter potential was calculated using the progenitor model for a 15 @xmath109 , low metallicity star as calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite on the basis of the models of ref .",
    "it can be seen that in the region between 0.02 @xmath110 and 0.3 @xmath110 the matter potential is strongly suppressed due to the high abundance of isotopic elements such as oxygen , carbon and helium .        where @xmath112 is the magnitude of the magnetic field at the surface of the iron core at a radius @xmath113 .",
    "the value of the neutrino magnetic moment was taken to be @xmath114 and @xmath112 was set to @xmath3 g. the ` gravitational current ' was calculated assuming that the iron core has collapsed to form a proto - neutron star of mass @xmath115 and a radius of @xmath116 km .",
    "its angular velocity was taken to be @xmath117 .",
    "it is seen that the ` gravitational current ' comes relatively close to the matter potential in the isotopically neutral region of the sn envelope .",
    "also shown in fig .",
    "1 is the absolute difference of the diagonal elements of the hamiltonian for the transition @xmath65 , i.e. the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) .",
    "resonance occurs whenever the difference in the diagonal elements goes through zero .",
    "it is evident that in order for the ` gravitational current ' to affect the neutrino spin - flip , the resonant transition has to take place in the isotopically neutral region . for a choice of @xmath118 ev@xmath119 and @xmath120 ( large mixing angle )",
    "the resonance occurs at about @xmath121 .    for magnetic fields as high as indicated in fig .",
    "1 the off - diagonal term , @xmath122 , dominates the potential by several orders of magnitude such that in the isotopically neutral region spin - flavor precession of almost maximum depth occurs .",
    "strong precession occurs whenever @xmath122 is much greater than @xmath123 and the precession amplitude is given by @xcite : @xmath124 in that case the gravitational current has a negligible effect on the conversion probability .",
    "however for weaker - and possibly more realistic - magnetic fields ( @xmath125 g ) @xmath122 becomes comparable to @xmath123 , suppressing the spin - flavor precession .",
    "however @xmath122 is still greater than @xmath123 at the resonance layer , where resonant conversion occurs as long as the adiabaticity condition is satisfied .",
    "it is readily seen that for our example the ` gravitational current ' is still by about one order of magnitude smaller than the matter potential and will thus not significantly affect the resonance position or the adiabaticity in the envelope of the sn ( even for @xmath125 g ) .",
    "however if the mass of the proto - neutron star or its rotation rate is increased , or the matter potential in the envelope is suppressed by about one order of magnitude ( i.e. , by reducing the abundance of high z metals ) , the presence of the gravitational current will start to shift the resonance position and affect the transition probability noticably .",
    "the conditions for which the gravitational contribution becomes important are neither contrived nor unrealistic .",
    "these calculations are only intended to yield crude orders of magnitude estimates for the different terms in the evolution equation and more exact numbers would require a more careful modelling of the collapsing star .",
    "for instance , i have neglected the infall velocity of the matter during the collapse and only considered radial neutrino trajectories in the weak - field limit .",
    "however these simple estimates presented here show that the terms arising from the space - time curvature can potentially become significant for spin - flip transitions in the sn envelope even though they are probably not important in most realistic cases .",
    "the extent to which they affect the neutrino transition depends on the detailed composition of the sn , as well as the mass and rotation rate of the proto - neutron star ."
