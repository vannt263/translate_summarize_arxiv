    "3c  382  with a @xmath172  kev appears to have a significantly hotter corona than either of these sources , and , potentially , a more tenuous corona than ic  4329a .",
    "however , @xcite also report a high temperature corona ( @xmath173@xmath174  kev ) in joint _ xmm - newton_-_nustar _  fits of the seyfert  1 ark  120 .",
    "thus , at this early stage , we can not draw a conclusion about the importance of the hot corona observed in 3c  382 , but @xmath175 bright agns have been targeted by _ nustar _  with the goal of determining the coronal parameters @xcite .",
    "this sample will allow interesting comparisons of coronal temperatures and optical depths among agns of different classes .",
    "recent observational innovations utilizing fe  k@xmath6  reverberation and microlensing have allowed the first constraints to be placed on the size of the x - ray corona in radio - quiet agns ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these techniques all point to a small , centrally concentrated corona , situated within @xmath175  @xmath100 from the black hole @xcite .",
    "such compact coronae provide the necessary illumination of the inner disk to produce a relativistic fe  k@xmath6  line @xcite .",
    "although the 3c  382  spectra analyzed here do not show strong evidence for a relativistic line , we can combine the comptonization modeling and the simultaneous _ swift _  data during observation 1 to obtain a simple view of the x - ray corona of 3c  382 .",
    "figure  [ fig : sed ] shows the optical / uv / x - ray sed of 3c  382  predicted by the best fitting ` compps ` models of observation 1 .",
    "the different lines show how the predicted sed vary for different coronal geometries .",
    "all of these models assume the same seed photon spectrum ( a ` diskbb ` with maximum @xmath176  ev ) and give the same @xmath19 to the x - ray data .",
    "the data points in the figure are the de - reddened fluxes of 3c  382  obtained from the simultaneous _ swift _  observation ( see sect .",
    "[ sect : obs ] ) .",
    "a least - squares fit to the _",
    "swift_-uvot data results in @xmath177 ( dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] ) , consistent with the @xmath178 slope expected for a shakura - sunyaev accretion disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "interestingly , the amplitude of the _",
    "swift_-uvot data is @xmath179 larger than the ` compps ` models .",
    "the uv emission predicted by the comptonization models is from the zeroth - scattering order , which , in a low @xmath10 corona such as seen in 3c  382 , is nearly equal to the total uv emission necessary to produce the observed x - rays .",
    "thus , the sed models indicate that the x - ray corona may intercept only @xmath5% of the accretion disk uv flux , broadly consistent with models of patchy corona in seyfert galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "evidence for a comptonizing corona in 3c  382 , when combined with the fact that the high - energy variability properties of blrgs are consistent with those from non - jetted seyfert 1s @xcite , shows that contamination from jets in the x - ray band of blrgs has likely been minimal .",
    "thus , there must be another explanation for the extremely weak reflection features of 3c  382 .",
    "interestingly , the source does present a significant ( ew @xmath180  ev ) fe  k@xmath6  line , but it does not originate from the inner accretion disk , nor does it arise from the broad line region ( the fe  k@xmath6  fwhm@xmath181  km  s@xmath14 , compared to @xmath182  km  s@xmath14 for the h@xmath6 line ; @xcite ) . however , the line width is only slightly larger than the energy resolution ( @xmath183  ev fwhm ; @xcite ) , so it is possible that the observed fe  k@xmath6  line width and strength is caused by the blending of multiple line components .",
    "regardless of the number of components to the line , there does not seem to be a significant reflection continuum in the observed spectrum .",
    "this fact points to an origin in material with a large fe abundance or from compton thin clouds that may originate in a dusty outflow from the nucleus ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ".    if the x - ray source in 3c  382  is a comptonizing corona similar to seyfert galaxies , then the lack of reflection from the inner disk is still puzzling .",
    "the inner accretion disk must be either blocked from view , absent , or emits such a weak reflection continuum that it can not be identified in our data .",
    "@xcite present evidence for a highly ionized inner accretion disk in 3c  382  that , when combined with a distant reflector that fits the narrow component of the fe  k@xmath6  line , also accounts for the soft excess . unfortunately , our data quality is not high enough to directly test this model , although we find a slightly broader neutral fe  k@xmath6  line than @xcite in both observations .",
    "another possibility for the extremely weak disk reflection is a transition to an optically thin , radiatively inefficient accretion flow inside @xmath184@xmath185  @xmath100 as a result of a ` jet cycle ' where the inner disk is ` emptied ' during a jet outburst ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , there was no radio monitoring of 3c  382  during the _ nustar _",
    "observations , so this model can not be tested for this source .",
    "finally , if the x - ray emitting corona is outflowing away from the accretion disk @xcite then it would naturally explain the hard power - law slope and the apparently very weak disk reflection ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the models of @xcite indicate that an outflow speed of @xmath186 would yield @xmath187 and @xmath188 .",
    "given that the black hole environment of 3c  382  is producing a relativistic jet , this process , combined with ionized reflection from close to the black hole , may be a promising model to explain the weak reflection features seen in blrgs .",
    "interestingly , ic 4329a also has weak reflection features and a hard continuum similar to 3c  382  @xcite , but does not produce a large scale radio - jet .",
    "@xcite estimate an outflow speed of @xmath189 for that source .",
    "these results may be hinting at a deeper connection between the corona and the base of a jet ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "further discrimination of the models will require high resolution and broadband x - ray data ( with , e.g. , _ astro - h _ ) combined with contemporaneous radio imaging .",
