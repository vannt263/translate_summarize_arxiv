    "stochastic vacuum model  @xcite ( for reviews see  @xcite ) puts in practice the idea that it is the stochasticity of nonperturbative background yang ",
    "mills fields that provides confinement .",
    "this idea is implemented by assuming the ensemble of fields to be predominantly gaussian , with the two - point correlation function containing the part essential for confinement . despite the numerical support by various lattice simulations  @xcite",
    ", this model , appealing by its simplicity , requires also theoretical support in the form of analytic studies of the said two - point function .",
    "such calculations have been performed in various abelian models , where confinement is provided by the monopole condensation  @xcite , in the instanton - vacuum model  @xcite , and recently also in ads / qcd  @xcite . in qcd itself , the first progress has been reached in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the correlation length of the two - point function has been related to the gluon condensate .",
    "furthermore , ref .",
    "@xcite explored the possibility for nonperturbative - nonconfining and confining background fields to have different correlation lengths .",
    "such a possibility is specific for qcd , and unlikely to exist in abelian models with confinement .",
    "this phenomenon has first been noticed in the lattice qcd simulations  @xcite , gaining its further analytic support within the theory of so - called gluelumps  @xcite .",
    "gluelumps can be thought as bound states of gluons in the field of a hypothetical infinitely heavy adjoint source  @xcite . in yang ",
    "mills theory , they define the correlation lengths of the field - strengths two - point function in the same way as , in full qcd , physically existing heavy - light mesons define the correlation length of a nonlocal quark condensate @xmath0 @xcite ( here @xmath1 is a phase factor along the straight - line path , which is provided by the heavy - quark propagator ) .",
    "unlike the fundamental case , the adjoint case allows for two different types of heavy - light objects  those with a single gluon , called one - gluon gluelumps , and those with two gluons , called two - gluon gluelumps ( cf .",
    "[ fig12 ] below ) .",
    "the first case is similar to the above - mentioned nonlocal quark condensate , whereas the second case is conceptually different , as it corresponds to two gluons connected together with the heavy source by three fundamental strings .",
    "specifically , it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the green functions of one- and two - gluon gluelumps define respectively the correlation lengths of nonperturbative - nonconfining and confining stochastic yang  mills fields .",
    "furthermore , these green functions have been explored in ref .",
    "@xcite by using respectively one- and two - body relativistic hamiltonians with linear potentials .    in the next section ,",
    "we accomplish the full calculation of quantum - mechanical path integrals representing those green functions , which has been started in ref .",
    "this analysis will in particular allow us to find the above - mentioned two vacuum correlation lengths , and compare them with those obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite within the hamiltonian approach .",
    "such a calculation turns out to be possible by virtue of an effective parametrization of minimal areas swept out by the strings in the gluelumps .",
    "this parametrization , suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , has been successfully used there to account for confinement of virtual gluons in the polarization operator . in section  iii , we summarize the main results of the paper . in appendix",
    "a , we calculate the green function of a one - gluon gluelump for paths deviating from the straight - line one , and show that the corresponding correlation function of nonperturbative - nonconfining background fields decreases with the deformation of the path .",
    "stochastic vacuum model suggests the following parametrization for the two - point correlation function of gluonic field strengths  @xcite : @xmath2 [ 09 ] + 12d_1(x - x ) . here , @xmath3 $ ] is a phase factor along some path interconnecting the points @xmath4 and @xmath5 . for the rest of the present section , this path",
    "is chosen along the straight line . furthermore , @xmath6 s are the su(@xmath7 ) generators in the fundamental representation , the average @xmath8 is taken with respect to the yang ",
    "mills action @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the yang ",
    "mills field - strength tensor , @xmath11 .",
    "the functions @xmath12 and @xmath13 parametrize respectively the nonperturbative - nonconfining and confining self - interactions of stochastic background fields . in this section ,",
    "we calculate @xmath12 and @xmath13 analytically , using their relation to the infra - red green functions of one- and two - gluon gluelumps  @xcite : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the quadratic casimir operator of the fundamental representation .",
    "equations  ( [ d ] ) hold at large distances , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the string tension in the fundamental representation  @xcite . in this infra - red regime , perturbative contributions are negligible , and the wilson - loop averages appearing in the green functions @xmath18 and @xmath19 exhibit the minimal - area law ( cf .",
    "below ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the leading infra - red asymptotes of these green functions have been obtained in terms of the lowest eigenvalues of respectively one- and two - body hamiltonians with the linear potential .",
    "below , the full infra - red green functions @xmath18 and @xmath19 will be found by means of a direct calculation of the corresponding path integrals with the minimal - area anstze .",
    "we start with the green function of a one - gluon gluelump , @xmath20 where the minimal surface of area @xmath21 is swept out by the adjoint string of tension @xmath22 , which connects the gluon to the adjointly charged source . while the effects of non - staticity of the source are considered in appendix  a , here we assume the source to be static , i.e. evolving entirely along the @xmath23-axis .",
    "this means that only the @xmath23-coordinate of the point @xmath5 in eq .",
    "( [ gg ] ) is nonvanishing , i.e. @xmath24 in what follows , we continue with the notations @xmath18 and @xmath19 , expressing these functions in terms of @xmath25 .",
    "we calculate the path integral in eq .",
    "( [ gg ] ) by approximating @xmath21 through the cauchy ",
    "schwarz inequality  @xcite : @xmath26 it reduces the path integral to that of a harmonic oscillator with a variable frequency . indeed , using the formula @xmath27 with @xmath28 , and changing the proper - time variable as @xmath29 , we have @xmath30 where @xmath31 denotes the integration over trajectories , which start and end up at @xmath32 .",
    "the kinetic term @xmath33 means , of course , that the auxiliary parameter @xmath34 can be viewed as an effective gluon mass .",
    "furthermore , the approximate equality `` @xmath35 '' in eq .",
    "( [ gx ] ) is understood in the sense of approaching the upper limit for @xmath21 in eq .",
    "( [ cs ] ) .",
    "we see then that the resulting path integral over @xmath36 is that of a free particle , @xmath37 whereas the integral over @xmath38 is that of a harmonic oscillator .",
    "it reads [ 78 ] ( -_0^l d^2-_0^l d^2)= ^3/2 , where @xmath39 is the frequency of the oscillator .",
    "changing further the integration variable from @xmath40 to @xmath41 , we can perform the @xmath34-integration : @xmath42 [ gg5 ] = _ 0^^-l/ ,   where   ll^2 . in the infra - red limit @xmath43 of interest , this integral can be evaluated analytically as follows : [ s9 ] _ 0 ^ 1 ^ -l/+2 ^ 3/2_1^^--+2 ^ 3/2_0^^--= + 4 ^ -l . here , the replacement of the lower limit of integration in the second integral by @xmath44 was legitimate , since the saddle - point value @xmath45 , in the limit @xmath43 at issue , is larger than @xmath46 ( and therefore the contribution of the integration region @xmath47 to the whole integral is exponentially small ) .",
    "thus , the leading result in the large-@xmath48 limit reads @xmath49 by means of eq .",
    "( [ d ] ) , it yields the following function @xmath12 : @xmath50 this expression can be compared with the one from ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath51 where the value @xmath52 was obtained from the schrdinger equation with the linear potential . to this end",
    ", we evaluate the adjoint string tension via the so - called casimir - scaling hypothesis  @xcite .",
    "this hypothesis , supported both by lattice simulations  @xcite and analytic studies  @xcite , suggests proportionality of the string tension , in a given representation of su(@xmath7 ) , to the quadratic casimir operator of that representation . for the adjoint representation of su(3 ) , it yields @xmath53 , where the value of the string tension in the fundamental representation is @xmath54 . accordingly , the obtained [ m1 ] mass   of   the   1 g   gluelump= 1.6gev , turns out to be very close to the quoted value of @xmath55 .",
    "note that , in principle , a gluon is confined up to arbitrarily large distances only at @xmath56 , whereas at @xmath57 it can be screened by other gluons . in the large-@xmath7 limit , @xmath58 , and the exponents in eqs .",
    "( [ d1 ] ) and ( [ td1 ] ) coincide numerically extremely well , since in that case @xmath59 .",
    "we proceed now to the green function of the two - gluon gluelump : @xmath60 @xmath61 trying out the cauchy ",
    "schwarz inequality , eq .",
    "( [ cs ] ) , for each of the three distances separately would involve integrations over three auxiliary parameters . in order to reduce this number to just one ,",
    "it is more useful to apply the cauchy  schwarz inequality in the form @xmath62 at @xmath63 , it yields @xmath64 now , so long as the common square root for the three distances is assembled , we can again apply the cauchy ",
    "schwarz inequality in the form of eq .",

    "( [ s ] ) were absent , the path integral would be that of two ( mutually interacting but otherwise free ) particles , which was calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", however , we have to deal with two ( also mutually interacting ) harmonic oscillators . nevertheless , such a path integral @xmath71 can still be calculated .",
    "this turns out to be possible upon the diagonalization of the action by virtue of the known fact that two positively definite quadratic forms ( that are , the kinetic and the potential energies ) can be diagonalized simultaneously . passing to the new integration trajectories",
    "@xmath72 and @xmath73 according to the formulae @xmath74 we obtain the diagonalization conditions @xmath75 the solution to these equations is straightforward : @xmath76 where we have chosen for concreteness the `` @xmath77 '' sign in front of the last square root . then the kinetic- and the potential - energy terms read @xmath78 @xmath79.\\ ] ] the jacobian stemming from the change of integration trajectories in eq .",
    "( [ ch ] ) is , of course , also @xmath34- and @xmath80-dependent , namely @xmath81 thus , we have reduced the path integral @xmath71 to the product of two well - known path integrals for non - interacting harmonic oscillators .",

    "the corresponding [ m2 ] mass   of   the   2 g   gluelump= 62.6gev , agrees remarkably well with its value of 2.56  gev found in ref .",
    "@xcite within the hamiltonian approach .",
    "in this paper , we have analytically confirmed the statement that nonperturbative - nonconfining and confining self - interactions of stochastic background yang  mills fields can have different correlation lengths .",
    "namely , we have obtained these lengths from the green functions of one- and two - gluon gluelumps , by means of an analytic treatment of the quantum - mechanical path integrals for one and two gluons ( inter)connected by strings with the static adjoint source .",
    "the resulting inverse correlation lengths are given by eqs .",
    "( [ m1 ] ) and ( [ m2 ] ) .",
    "they turn out to be in a remarkably good agreement with those found in ref .",
    "@xcite by means of a different , hamiltonian , approach .",
    "we have also demonstrated that , in accordance with the lattice results  @xcite , the two - point correlation function of nonperturbative - nonconfining background fields decreases with the deformation of the path interconnecting these two points . on the technical side , for the calculation of the green function of a two - gluon gluelump",
    ", a novel method has been developed of an analytic evaluation of the path integral with the common minimal surface formed by two gluons together with the adjointly charged source .    in the forthcoming studies , we plan to incorporate dynamical quarks in this theoretical framework .",
    "their appearance can lead to the breaking of not only fundamental strings , but also of the adjoint ones  through the creation of @xmath91-@xmath92-@xmath93 hybrids .",
    "an effective reduction , due to the string - breaking , of string world sheets in the spatial directions can lead to their enhancement in the temporal direction , that is , to the increase of the vacuum correlation lengths . in this way , vacuum correlation lengths in full qcd can exceed those obtained here in pure yang ",

    "( [ s9 ] ) ] @xmath111 . to figure out the extent to which the function @xmath112 affects the saddle point",

    "( [ a7 ] ) exceeds the third term by at least one order of magnitude .",
    "therefore , the third term can be disregarded compared to the second one , for the reason of smallness of @xmath113 .",
    "accordingly , approximating @xmath112 by some constant @xmath114 , we obtain the saddle - point value @xmath115 , which is much larger than 1 in the limit @xmath116 of interest . and indeed , for @xmath117 , one can see a very weak variation of the function @xmath112 , which is illustrated by fig .",

    "such an increase yields an even stronger suppression of contributions produced by curved paths .    in general , the present approach yields , for a given path , a decrease of the vacuum correlation length and the amplitude of the correlation function by the same amount as compared to these quantities for the straight - line path .",
    "with the deformation of the path , the suppression factor increases .",
    "this statement can be illustrated by considering the path @xmath123 , which is deformed stronger than @xmath104 .",

    "the difference is that the limiting value of the function @xmath112 at @xmath117 appears in this case larger , namely @xmath125 , instead of @xmath126 .",

    "( [ kl ] ) becomes @xmath121{1+f}\\simeq1.56 $ ] , instead of @xmath122 .",
    "such an increase of the factor @xmath121{1+f}$ ] is quite fast , in spite of its slow , fourth - root , functional dependence .",
