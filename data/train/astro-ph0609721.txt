    "more references on papers devoted to the migration of bodies from different regions of the solar system to the near - earth space can be found in our previous publications on this problem ( ipatov 1995 , 1999 , 2000 , 2001 , 2002 ; ipatov & hahn 1999 , ipatov & mather 2003 , 2004a - b , 2006a ) .",
    "as migration of tnos to jupiter s orbit was considered by several authors , ipatov ( 2002 ) , and ipatov & mather ( 2003 , 2004a - b , 2006a ) paid particular attention to the orbital evolution of jupiter - crossing objects ( jcos ) , considering a larger number of jcos than before .    in the present paper , we summarize our studies of migration of cometary objects into neo orbits , paying particular attention to the probabilities of collisions of cometary objects with the terrestrial planets . these studies are based on our previous runs and on some new runs .",
    "earlier we did not consider the evolution of orbits of halley - type comets and long - period comets and did not study the probabilities of collisions of different comets with the giant planets .",
    "though some used runs are the same as earlier , the discussion on migration of small bodies based on these runs is different .",
    "ipatov & mather ( 2003 , 2004a - b , 2006a ) integrated the orbital evolution of about 30,000 objects with initial orbits close to that of jupiter - family comets ( jfcs ) .",
    "we considered the gravitational influence of planets , but omitted the influence of mercury ( except for comet 2p ) and pluto . in about a half of runs",
    "we used the method by bulirsh - stoer ( 1966 ) ( bulsto code ) , and in other runs we used a symplectic method ( rmvs3 code ) .",
    "the integration package of levison & duncan ( 1994 ) was used .    in the first series of runs ( denoted as @xmath5 ) we calculated the orbital evolution of 3100 jcos moving in initial orbits close to those of 20 real comets ( with numbers 7 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 14 , 16 , 17 , 19 , 22 , 26 , 30 , 44 , 47 , 51 , 57 , 61 , 65 , 71 , 73 , and 75 ) with period 5@xmath3@xmath6@xmath39 yr , and in the second series of runs ( denoted as @xmath7 ) we considered 13,500 jcos moving in initial orbits close to those of 10 real comets ( with numbers 77 , 81 , 82 , 88 , 90 , 94 , 96 , 97 , 110 , and 113 ) with period 5@xmath3@xmath6@xmath315 yr . in other series of runs , initial orbits were close to those of a single comet ( 2p / encke , 9p / tempel 1 , 10p / tempel 2 , 22p / kopff , 28p / neujmin 1 , 39p / oterma , or 44p / reinmuth 2 ) . in order to compare the orbital evolution of comets and asteroids",
    ", we also studied the orbital evolution of 1300 asteroids initially moving in the 3:1 and 5:2 resonances with jupiter .",
    "in our recent runs we also considered objects started from orbits of test long - period comets ( @xmath8=0.995 , @xmath9=@xmath10@xmath0(1-@xmath8)=0.9 au or @xmath9=0.1 au , initial inclination @xmath11 varied from 0 to 180@xmath12 in each run , bodies started at perihelion ; these runs are denoted as @xmath13 runs ) and test halley - type comets ( @xmath10=20 au , @xmath11 varied from 0 to 180@xmath12 in each run , bodies started at perihelion ; in some runs @xmath8=0.975 and @xmath9=0.5 au , in other runs @xmath8=0.9 and @xmath9=2 au ; these runs are denoted as @xmath14 runs ) .",
    "usually we investigated the orbital evolution during the dynamical lifetimes of objects ( at least until all the objects reached perihelion distance @xmath15@xmath166 au or collided with the sun ) .",
    "ipatov et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and ipatov & mather ( 2006a ) studied migration of dust particles started from several comets , asteroids , and trans - neptunian objects .    in our runs , planets were considered as material points , so literal collisions did not occur .",
    "however , using the algorithm suggested by ipatov ( 2000 ) with the correction that takes into account a different velocity at different parts of the orbit ( ipatov & mather 2003 ) , and based on all orbital elements sampled with a 500 yr step , we calculated the mean probability @xmath17 of collisions of migrating objects with a planet .",
    "we define @xmath17 as @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the probability for all @xmath20 objects of a collision of an object with a planet during an object s dynamical lifetime .",
    "note that our algorithm differed from the pik s scheme , and included calculations of a synodic period and the region where the distance between the ` first ' orbit and the projection of the ` second ' orbit onto the plane of the ` first ' orbit is less than the sphere of action ( i.e. , the tisserand sphere ) .    for bulsto runs ,",
    "the integration step error was less than @xmath21 , where @xmath21 varied between @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( most of the runs were made for @xmath21 equal to @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) , and for a rmvs3 runs an integration step @xmath25 varied from 0.1 to 30 days ( most runs were made for @xmath25=10 days ) . in a single run with @xmath20 ( usually @xmath20=250 ) objects , @xmath21 or @xmath25 was constant .",
    "results obtained with the use of different methods of integration and different integration step were similar , exclusive for probabilities of collisions with the sun in such runs when this probability was large ( for comet 2p , comet 96p from @xmath7 series , and the 3:1 resonance with jupiter ) .",
    "probabilities of collisions of bodies with planets were close for different integrators even in the latter case because soon after close encounters with the sun , bodies were ejected into hyperbolic orbits or moved in highly inclined orbits .",
    "h. levison showed that it is difficult to detect solar collisions in any numerical integrator , so he removed objects with perihelion distance @xmath15@xmath3@xmath26 .",
    "our runs were made for direct modeling of collisions with the sun , but we studied what happens if we consider @xmath26 equal to @xmath27 radii @xmath28 of the sun .",
    "we obtained that the mean probabilities of collisions of bodies with planets , lifetimes of objects that spent millions of years in earth - crossing orbits , and other obtained results were practically the same if we consider that objects disappear when @xmath15 becomes less than the radius @xmath28 of the sun or even several such radii ( i.e. , we checked @xmath15@xmath3@xmath27@xmath0@xmath28 , where @xmath27 equals 1 , 2 , or another value ) .",
    "the only noticeable difference was for comet 96p from @xmath7 series and a smaller one was for comet 2p , but results of such runs were not included in our statistics . eccentricity and inclination of comet 96p / machholz 1 are large , so usually even for these @xmath7 runs the collision probabilities of objects with the terrestrial planets were not differed by more than 15% at @xmath27=0 and @xmath27=1 . among more than a hundred considered runs , there were three runs , for each of which at @xmath27=0 a body in an orbit close to that of comet 96p was responsible for 70 - 75% of collision probabilities with the earth , and for @xmath27=1 a lifetime of such body was much less than for @xmath27=0 .",
    "nevertheless , for all ( @xmath29@xmath30 ) objects from @xmath7 series , at @xmath27=0 the probabilities of collisions with the terrestrial planets were close to those at @xmath27=1 , even if we consider the above runs .",
    "the difference for times spent in earth - crossing orbits is greater than that for the probabilities and is about 20% .",
    "for all runs at 2p series , the difference in time spent in orbits with @xmath4@xmath34.7 au for @xmath27=0 and for @xmath27=1 was less than 4% . in 2p series of runs ( and also for the 3:1 resonance with jupiter ) , at @xmath27=0 we sometimes got orbits with @xmath31@xmath16@xmath32 , but practically there were no such orbits at @xmath27@xmath331 ( ipatov & mather 2004a - b ) . among objects with initial orbits close to that of comet 96p , we found one object which also got @xmath31@xmath16@xmath32 for 3 myr .",
    "inclinations of other such objects did not exceed 90@xmath12 .    in most ` cometary ' runs ( exclusive for 2p runs ) ,",
    "the fraction @xmath34 of comets collided with the sun was less than 0.02 ; @xmath34 exceeded 5% for some @xmath14 runs , and most of comets in 2p",
    "runs collided with the sun .",
    "some migrating jcos got earth - crossing orbits .",
    "usually they spent in such orbits only a few thousands of years , but a few considered objects moved in earth - crossing orbits with aphelion distances @xmath4@xmath34.2 au for millions of years .",
    "the total times which 30,000 considered objects started from jfc orbits spent in earth - crossing orbits with @xmath2@xmath32 au were due to a few tens of objects , but mainly only to a few of them . with bulsto at @xmath24@xmath35@xmath21@xmath35@xmath23 , six and nine objects , respectively from 10p and 2p series , moved into apollo orbits with @xmath2@xmath32 au ( @xmath36 orbits ) for at least 0.5 myr each , and five of them remained in such orbits for more than 5 myr each . among the jfcs considered with bulsto ,",
    "only one and two jfcs reached inner - earth orbits ( ieo , @xmath4@xmath30.983 au ) and aten orbits , respectively .",
    "only two objects in series @xmath7 got @xmath36 orbits during more than 1 myr . for the @xmath5 series of runs , while moving in jco orbits , objects had orbital periods @xmath6@xmath320 yr ( jupiter - family comets ) and 20@xmath3@xmath6@xmath3200 yr ( halley - type comets ) for 32% and 38% of the mean value @xmath37 ( @xmath37=0.12 myr ) of the total time spent by one object in jupiter - crossing orbits , respectively .",
    "four considered former jfcs even got ieo or aten orbits for myrs .",
    "note that ipatov ( 1995 ) obtained migration of jcos into ieo orbits using the method of spheres to consider the gravitational influence of planets . in our bulsto runs , one former jco , which had an initial orbit close to that of 10p , moved in aten orbits for 3.45 myr , and the probability of its collision with the earth from such orbits was 0.344 .",
    "it also moved for about 10 myr in ieo orbits before its collision with venus , and during this time the probability of its collision with venus was @xmath38=0.655 .",
    "the above probabilities are greater than the total probabilities for @xmath30 other jcos .",
    "another object ( from 2p bulsto run ) moved in highly eccentric aten orbits for 83 myr , and its lifetime before collision with the sun was 352 myr .",
    "its probability of collisions with earth , venus , and mars during its lifetime was 0.172 , 0.224 , and 0.065 , respectively .",
    "with rmvs3 at @xmath25@xmath3510 days for 2p run , the probability of collisions with earth for one object was greater by a factor of 30 than for 250 other objects . for series",
    "@xmath5 with rmvs3 , the probability of a collision with the earth for one object with an initial orbit close to that of comet 44p was 88% of the total probability for 1200 objects from this series , and the total probability for 1198 objects was only 4% . for series",
    "44p with @xmath20=1500 there were no objects with @xmath2@xmath32 au and @xmath15@xmath31 au , though the 44p object in @xmath5 run spent 11.7 myr in such orbits . for series",
    "@xmath7 with rmvs3 , we obtained one object with an initial orbit close to that of comet 113p / spitaler with relatively large values of probabilities of collisions with earth and venus .",
    "this object is responsible for 10% of the total collision probability with earth for all @xmath7 objects , but most of the time spent by all these objects in orbits with @xmath2@xmath32 au and @xmath15@xmath31 au are due to this object .",
    "though about a half of 30,000 considered objects belong to series @xmath7 , most of objects that spent a long time in earth - crossing orbits with @xmath4@xmath34.2 au belong to other series of runs .    after 40 myr",
    "one considered object with an initial orbit close to that of comet 88p / howell ( from @xmath7 rmvs3 runs ) got @xmath4@xmath33.5 au , and it moved in orbits with @xmath2=2.60 - 2.61 au , 1.7@xmath3@xmath15@xmath32.2 au , 3.1@xmath3@xmath4@xmath33.5 au , eccentricity @xmath39=0.2 - 0.3 , and inclination @xmath31=5 - 10@xmath12 for 650 myr . another object ( with an initial orbit close to that of comet 94p / russel 4 ) moved in orbits with @xmath2=1.95 - 2.1 au , @xmath15@xmath161.4 au , @xmath4@xmath32.6 au , @xmath39=0.2 - 0.3 , and @xmath31=9 - 33@xmath12 for 8 myr",
    "( and it had @xmath4@xmath33 au for 100 myr ) .",
    "so jfcs can very rarely get typical asteroid orbits and move in them for myrs . in our opinion , it can be possible that comet 133p ( elst - pizarro ) moving in a typical asteroidal orbit ( hsieh & jewitt 2006 ) was earlier a jfc and it circulated its orbit also due to non - gravitational forces .",
    "jfcs got typical asteroidal orbits less often than neo orbits .",
    "levison et al . ( 2006 ) argued that our obtained orbits with @xmath2@xmath401 au were due to the fact that collisions of objects with terrestrial planets were not taken into account in our runs and such orbits were caused by too close encounters of objects with planets which really result in collisions .",
    "based on the orbital elements obtained in our runs , we can conclude that probabilities of collisions of migrating bodies with planets before bodies got orbits with @xmath2@xmath32 au were very small and the reason of the transformations of orbits was not caused by such close encounters of objects with the terrestrial planets that really resulted in collisions with the planets .",
    "some real probabilities of collisions of bodies moving in orbits with @xmath2@xmath32 au with planets were only after bodies had already got such orbits and moved in them for tens or hundreds of myr .",
    "other scientists did not obtain the migration of jcos into orbits with @xmath2@xmath401 au because they considered other initial data . in series @xmath7 with 13,500 objects ,",
    "we also did not obtain orbits with @xmath2@xmath401 au and obtained only two orbits with @xmath2@xmath32 au ( the latter orbits were also obtained by levison et al .",
    "2006 ) . for other series of runs",
    ", we paid more attention to those initial data for which migrating objects could spend a long time inside jupiter s orbit .",
    "based on the results of migration of jfcs with initial orbits close to the orbit of comet p/1996 r2 obtained by ipatov & hahn ( 1999 ) ( for these runs with about a hundred objects , there were no objects which spent a long time in earth - crossing orbits ) , ipatov ( 1999 , 2001 ) found that 10 - 20% or more of all 1-km earth - crossers could have come from the edgeworth - kuiper belt into jupiter - crossing orbits .",
    "using our results of the orbital evolution of 30,000 jcos and the results of migration of tnos obtained by duncan et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and considering the total of 5@xmath0@xmath41 1-km tnos with 30@xmath3@xmath2@xmath350 au , ipatov & mather ( 2003 , 2004a - b ) estimated the number of 1-km former tnos in neo orbits . results of their runs testify in favor of at least one of these conclusions : 1 ) the portion of 1-km former tnos among neos can exceed several tens of percents , 2 ) the number of tnos migrating inside the solar system could be smaller by a factor of several than it was earlier considered , 3 ) most of 1-km former tnos that had got neo orbits disintegrated into mini - comets and dust during a smaller part of their dynamical lifetimes if these lifetimes are not small",
    ". all these three factors could take place .",
    "we consider that the role of disintegration may be more valuable and most of former comets that could move inside jupiter s orbit for millions of years really were disintegrated . as the number of tnos ,",
    "their rate of migration inside the solar system , and lifetimes of former comets before their disruption are not well known , the estimates of the fraction of former tnos among neos are very approximate .",
    "disintegrated comets could produce a lot of mini - comets and dust .",
    "therefore there could be a lot of cometary dust among zodiacal particles , some of them were produced by high eccentricity comets ( such as comet 2p / encke ) .",
    "the same conclusion about cometary dust was made by ipatov et al .",
    "( 2006a - b ) based on analysis of spectra of the zodiacal light .",
    "dynamical lifetimes of dust particles are typically smaller than those for bodies and they are smaller for smaller particles .",
    "so old extinct comets are not surrounded by dust .",
    "frank et al .",
    "( 1986a - b ) concluded that there is a large influx of small comets into the earth s upper atmosphere .",
    "it is known ( merline et al . 2002 , noll 2006 , pravec et al .",
    "2006 ) that about 15% of neos and 2 - 3% of main - belt asteroids are binaries .",
    "we can suppose that the fraction of neo binaries is greater for those neos which are extinct comets than for asteroidal neos .",
    "comets more often split into smaller parts than asteroids , and probably there are former comets even among binary main - belt asterods . besides , if initial ( before collisional destruction ) small bodies were formed by compression of dust condensations , then the fraction of binary objects is greater for greater distances of the place of origin of bodies from the sun ( ipatov 2004 ) .",
    "comets are estimated to be active for @xmath42@xmath2910@xmath43 - 10@xmath44 yr .",
    "@xmath42 is smaller for closer encounters with the sun ( weissman et al . , 2002 ) , so for comet 2p it is smaller than for other jfcs .",
    "if considered as material points , some former comets can move for tens or even hundreds of myr in neo orbits , so the number of extinct comets can exceed the number of active comets by several orders of magnitude .",
    "the mean time spent by encke - type objects in earth - crossing orbits was @xmath330.4 myr .",
    "this time corresponds to @xmath3340 - 400 extinct comets of this type if we consider that encke - type active comet is not an exceptional event in the history of the solar system .",
    "note that the diameter of comet 2p is about 5 - 10 km , so the number of 1-km earth - crossing extinct encke - type comets can be greater by a factor of 25 - 100 than the above estimate for encke - size comets and can exceed 1000 for such estimates .",
    "the rate of a cometary object decoupling from the jupiter vicinity and transferring to a neo - like orbit can be increased by a factor of several due to nongravitational effects ( harris & bailey 1998 , asher et al .",
    "2001 , fernandez & gallardo 2002 ) .",
    "the role of the yarkovsky and yorp effects on dynamics of asteroids was summarized by bottke et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .",
    "dynamical models of the neo population considered by bottke et al .",
    "( 2002 ) allowed 6 % of dead comets . from measured albedos , fernandez et al .",
    "( 2001 ) concluded that the fraction of extinct comets among neos and unusual asteroids is significant ( 9% ) .",
    "rickman et al . ( 2001 ) and jewitt & fernandez ( 2001 ) considered that dark spectral classes that might include the ex - comets are severely under - represented and comets played an important and perhaps even dominant role among all km - size earth impactors .",
    "binzel & lupishko ( 2006 ) studied albedos and spectra of neos and concluded that 15@xmath455 % of the entire neo population may be comprised by extinct or dormant comets .",
    "harris & bailey ( 1998 ) concluded that the number of cometary asteroids becomes comparable to the number of bodies injected from the main asteroid belt if one considers non - gravitational effects .",
    "typical comets have larger rotation periods than typical neos ( binzel et al .",
    "1992 , lupishko & lupishko 2001 ) , but , while losing considerable portions of their masses , extinct comets can decrease these periods .",
    "our runs showed that if one observes former comets in neo orbits , then most of them could have already moved in such orbits for millions ( or at least hundreds of thousands ) of years .",
    "some former comets that have moved in typical neo orbits for millions of years , and might have had multiple close encounters with the sun , could have lost their mantles , which caused their low albedo , and so change their albedo ( for most observed neos , the albedo is greater than that for comets ( fernandez et al .",
    "2001 ) ) and would look like typical asteroids . for better estimates of the portion of extinct comets among neos we will need orbit integrations for many more tnos and jcos , and wider analysis of observations and craters .",
    "the probability of a collision of one celestial body with a planet can be greater than the total probability for thousands of objects with almost the same initial orbit .",
    "a few jcos ( mentioned in section 3 ) with the highest probabilities with planets were not included in the statistics presented below . for series @xmath5 , the probability @xmath46 of a collision of an object with the earth ( during a dynamical lifetime of the object ) was about 4.5@xmath0@xmath47 and 4.8@xmath0@xmath47 for bulsto and rmvs3 runs , respectively ( but for rmvs3 it is by an order of magnitude greater if we consider one more object with the highest probability ) . for series @xmath7 ,",

    "the ratio of probabilities of collisions of bodies with different giant planets , for a pair of planets can vary by more than an order of magnitude from run to run .    as only a small fraction of comets collided with planets during dynamical lifetimes of comets ,",
    "the orbital evolution of comets for the considered model of material points was close to that for the model when comets collided with a planet are removed from integrations .",
    "using @xmath46=@xmath60 ( this value is smaller than the mean value of @xmath46 obtained in our runs for jfcs ) and assuming that the total mass of planetesimals that ever crossed jupiter s orbit is about 100@xmath61 ( ipatov 1987 , 1993 ) , where @xmath61 is the mass of the earth , we obtain that the total mass of water delivered from the feeding zone of the giant planets to the earth could be about the mass of water in earth s oceans .",
    "we considered that the fraction @xmath62 of water in planetesimals equaled 0.5 . for present comets @xmath62@xmath30.5 ( jewitt 2004 ) , but it is considered that @xmath62 could exceed 0.5 for planetesimals . the fraction of the mass of the planet delivered by jfcs and htcs can be greater for mars and venus than that for the earth .",
    "this larger mass fraction would result in relatively large ancient oceans on mars and venus .",
    "the conclusion that planetesimals from the zone of the giant planets could deliver all the water to the terrestrial oceans was also made by ipatov ( 2001 ) and marov & ipatov ( 2001 ) on the basis of runs by ipatov & hahn ( 1999 ) .",
    "the above estimate of water delivery by cometary bodies to the earth is greater than those by morbidelli et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and levison et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , but is in accordance with the results by chyba ( 1989 ) and rickman et al .",
    ". the larger value of @xmath46 we have calculated compared to those argued by morbidelli et al .",
    "( 2000 ) ( @xmath46@xmath29(1 - 3)@xmath0@xmath47 ) and levison et al .",
    "( 2001 ) ( @xmath46=4@xmath0@xmath63 ) is caused by the fact that in our runs we considered different initial orbits and a larger number of jcos .",
    "levison et al . (",
    "2001 ) did not take into account the influence of the terrestrial planets , so probably that is why his values of @xmath46 are even smaller than those by morbidelli et al .",
    "the latter authors used results of integrations of objects initially located beyond jupiter s orbit . for 39p runs ( @xmath10=7.25 au and @xmath8=0.25 ) , we obtained @xmath46 equal to 1.2@xmath0@xmath47 and 2.5@xmath0@xmath47 for bulsto and rmvs3 runs , respectively .",
    "these values are in accordance with the values of @xmath46 obtained by morbidelli et al .",
    "morbidelli et al .",
    "( 2000 ) considered reasonable that about 50 - 100@xmath61 of planetesimals primordially existed in the jupiter - saturn region and about 20 - 30@xmath61 of planetesimals in the uranus - neptune region . we think that they considerably underestimated the mass of planetesimals in the uranus - neptune region .",
    "lunine ( 2004 , 2006 ) concluded that possible sources of water for earth are diverse , and include mars - sized hydrated bodies in the asteroid belt , smaller `` asteroidal '' bodies , water adsorbed into dry silicate grains in the nebula , and comets .",
    "lunine et al .",
    "( 2003 ) considered most of the earth s water as a product of collisions between the growing earth and planet - sized `` embryos '' from the asteroid belt .",
    "drake & campins ( 2006 ) noted that the key argument against an asteroidal source of earth s water is that the o s isotopic composition of earth s primitive upper mantle matches that of anhydrous ordinary chondrites , not hydrous carbonaceous chondrites .",
    "kuchner et al . (",
    "2004 ) investigated the possibility that the earth s ocean water originated as ice grains formed in a cold nebula , delivered to the earth by drag forces from co - orbital nebular gas .",
    "dust particles could also deliver water to the earth from the feeding zone of the giant planets .",
    "ipatov & mather ( 2006a , b ) obtained that the probability of collisions of 10 - 100 @xmath53 m particles originated beyond jupiter s orbit is about ( 1 - 3)@xmath0@xmath48 .",
    "therefore the water in the terrestrial oceans ( 2@xmath0@xmath48@xmath64 ) can be delivered by particles ( for the model without sublimation ) which had contained @xmath29@xmath64 of water when they had been located beyond jupiter .",
    "so dust particles could also play some role in the delivery of water to the terrestrial planets during planet formation .",
    "there is the deuterium / hydrogen paradox of earth s oceans ( d / h ratio is different for oceans and comets ) , but pavlov et al .",
    "( 1999 ) suggested that solar wind - implanted hydrogen on interplanetary dust particles provided the necessary low - d / h component of earth s water inventory , and delsemme ( 1999 ) considered that most of the seawater was brought by the comets that originated in jupiter s zone , where steam from the inner solar system condensed onto icy interstellar grains before they accreted into larger bodies .",
    "it is likely ( drake & campins 2006 ) that the d / h and ar / o ratios measured in cometary comas and tails are not truly representative of cometary interiors .",
    "small bodies which collided with planets could deliver volatiles and organic / prebiotic compounds needed for life origin .",
    "marov & ipatov ( 2005 ) concluded that dust particles could be most efficient in the delivery of organic or even biogenic matter to the earth , because they experience substantially weaker heating when passing through the atmosphere ( an excess heat is radiated effectively due to high total surface - to - mass ratio for dust particles ) .",
    "they assumed that life forms drastically different from the terrestrial analogs are unlikely to be found elsewhere in the solar system ( if any ) , e.g. , either extinct or extant life on mars .",
    "some jupiter - family comets can reach typical neo orbits and remain there for millions of years . from the dynamical point of view ( if comets did nt disintegrate ) there could be ( not must be ) many ( up to tens of percent ) extinct comets among the neos , but , probably , many extinct comets disintegrated into mini - comets and dust during a smaller part of their dynamical lifetimes if these lifetimes were large .",
    "disintegration of comets can provide a considerable fraction of cometary dust among the zodiacal dust particles .",
    "the probability of a collision of one object moving for a long time in earth - crossing orbits , with the earth could be greater than the sum of probabilities for thousands of other objects , even having similar initial orbits . even without a contribution of such a few bodies ,",
    "the probability of a collision of a former jfc ( during its dynamical lifetime ) with the earth was greater than 4@xmath010@xmath1 .",
    "this probability is enough for delivery of all the water to earth s oceans during formation of the giant planets .",
    "the ratios of probabilities of collisions of jfcs and htcs with venus and mars to the mass of a planet usually were not smaller than that for earth .",
