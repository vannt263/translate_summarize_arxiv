    "the energy spectra of molecules consisting of two atoms are as a rule well understood in terms of equidistant vibrational excitations characterized by wavelengths in the millimetric infrared range , on top of which one observes rotational bands of energies growing as @xmath0 , with @xmath1 non - negative integer , which disintegrate by emitting nanometric microwave radiations ( so called rovibron model @xcite ) . for a fixed vibrational mode ,",
    "the microwave radiation is entirely attributed to the proportionality of the molecular hamiltonian to the squared angular momentum operator , @xmath2 , @xmath3 where @xmath4 stands for the reduced mass of the two molecules , and @xmath5 denotes the equilibrium bound length .",
    "the description of the rotational modes amounts to the diagonalizing of @xmath6 in the basis of the functions , @xmath7 of the polar , @xmath8 , and azimuthal , @xmath9 , angles , @xmath10 interpreting @xmath11 as the moment of inertia , @xmath12 , about the center of mass , the equation  ( [ gl2 ] ) is cast in the standard form of the linear rigid rotor , termed to here as rigid rotator , according to , @xmath13 with @xmath14 being the rotational constant .",
    "the solutions to the latter equation are the well known three - dimensional spherical harmonics , @xmath15 , i.e. @xmath16 , defined as , @xmath17 here , @xmath18 are the associated legendre functions @xcite , known to become the legendre polynomials , @xmath19 , for @xmath20 .",
    "it is of common use to cast the rotational spectrum in ( [ gl3 ] ) in terms of frequencies , @xmath21 , as @xmath22    and define spectral lines separated by the constant gap of @xmath23 .",
    "the above considerations refer to the idealized case of a pure rotator , the reality being that the equidistant line spacings are altered by centrifugal distortions and other secondary effects , left aside in what follows .",
    "the rotational spectra are remarkable through the fact that the energy , @xmath24 , equivalently , the frequency , @xmath21 , in ( [ freq ] ) , depends on @xmath1 alone meaning that the multiplicity of states in a level is @xmath25-fold .",
    "also the shapes of the disintegration ( `` radiation '' ) patterns , more precisely , the angular probability density distributions , given by the spherical polar plots of the squared @xmath15 functions , are energy degenerate . the plot in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] illustrates the degeneracy of the probability density distributions responsible for the disintegration of the states @xmath26 to the ground state .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "in conclusion , pure rotational frequency patterns do not necessarily imply equality of the hamiltonian to that of the canonical rigid rotator .    for discrete values of the potential parameter @xmath27",
    ", such patterns occur because the isospectral potentials in ( [ ip_5 ] ) are related through a similarity transformation of the type given in ( [ iip_2b])-([ip_2c ] ) with the place of @xmath28 being taken by the @xmath29 factor in the wave function in ( [ wafu_sd ] ) .",
    "we discussed this issue after eq .",
    "( [ edm ] ) . stated differently , the schrdinger hamiltonian with the trigonometric scarf potential for such parameter values is identical to the similarity transformed squared angular momentum operator , @xmath30 , as explained in ( [ ffunction ] ) .",
    "same happens when the magnetic quantum number @xmath31 takes its maximal value . in all these cases",
    "the reason behind the rotational patterns of the perturbed motion is still the @xmath32 symmetry of the hamiltonian , though in a representation distinct from the canonical one .",
    "however , for continuous @xmath27 values the above considerations are no longer valid and the reason behind the rotational spectrum is not obvious . in order to get",
    "an insight into the symmetry properties of the perturbed hamiltonian for this case one has to follow the standard procedure and find the complete set of operators with which it is commuting . in calculating the commutators of these operators , a clue on a possible lie algebra",
    "might be obtained @xcite .    in all cases ,",
    "the wave functions of the rigid rotator , perturbed by the trigonometric scarf potential in ( [ scfi ] ) , despite of the rotational multiplicity of the states in the levels , are in first place always of unspecified parities . in consequence ,",
    "a sort of exotics is produced in so far as the states in the rotational bands acquire non - vanishing electric dipole moments .",
    "the symmetry behind the emerging exotic rotational spectrum for continuous @xmath27 values is not very clear so far .",
    "we conclude on the possibility for existence of exotic rotational bands containing parityless states in two - body systems of a possibly new class , be them di - atomic- , di - molecular , quarkish , etc . and whose states carry non - vanishing electric dipole expectation values .",
