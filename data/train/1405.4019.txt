    "a _ geometric graph _ ( gg ) is a graph whose vertices are points in general position in the plane , and whose edges are segments connecting pairs of vertices .",

    "one of the oldest turn - type questions for geometric graphs , mentioned already by erds  @xcite in 1946 , is : what is the maximal number of edges in a geometric graph on @xmath0 vertices that does not contain @xmath1 _ pairwise disjoint",
    "this question , along with the `` dual '' question concerning geometric graphs that do not contain @xmath1 _ pairwise crossing _",
    "edges , became central research topics in geometric combinatorics , with dozens of papers obtaining upper and lower bounds and resolving special cases ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",

    "_ an @xmath13-free graph_.    for general ggs , the questions of determining the maximal possible number of edges in an @xmath12-free graph and in an @xmath13-free graph are still widely open . for @xmath12-free",

    "it is conjectured that the correct answer is of order @xmath17 ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "much more is known in the convex case .",
    "for @xmath13-free cggs , capoyleas and pach  @xcite showed in 1992 that the maximal possible number of edges is @xmath18 , for any @xmath19 .",
    "it was also shown that any @xmath13-free cgg that is maximal with respect to inclusion ( i.e. , addition of any edge gives rise to @xmath1 pairwise crossing edges ) contains exactly @xmath18 edges  @xcite , and the exact number of extremal examples was shown to be equal to the determinant of a certain matrix of catalan numbers  @xcite .",
    "strong upper bounds were obtained also for related questions , such as determining the maximal possible number of edges in a cggs that does not contain a @xmath6-grid ( i.e. , two families of @xmath6 edges each such that each edge in the first family crosses each edge in the other family ) , see  @xcite .    for @xmath12-free cggs ,",

    "we present a family of maximal @xmath12-free graphs @xmath39 that avoid @xmath40 consecutive vertices , thus proving theorem  [ thm : main](1 ) . in section  [ sec : extension ]",
    "we modify the construction to produce @xmath12-free graphs @xmath41 that avoid @xmath42 consecutive vertices , and use this construction to complete the proof of theorem  [ thm : main ] .",
    "we start with a few definitions and notations , which are a bit unusual but will be very convenient for the proofs in the sequel .",
    "let @xmath0 be a positive integer , @xmath43 .",
    "in order to deal with a convex geometric graph @xmath44 of order @xmath0 with a free arc @xmath28 , we consider a regular polygon @xmath23 of order @xmath45 , whose vertices lie on a circle with center @xmath46 and are numbered cyclically from @xmath47 to @xmath0 , as shown in figure  [ fig:2new ]",
    ". we shall always insist that the free arc @xmath28 * is * symmetric with respect to the horizontal axis through @xmath46 and lie on the right .",
    "thus , if @xmath48 is even , then we let @xmath49 be the set of odd - labelled vertices of @xmath23 , and if @xmath48 is odd , we let @xmath49 be the set of even - labelled vertices of @xmath23 .",
    "the segment connecting the endpoints of @xmath28 will always be vertical .",

    "forbidden_. we also call the vertices of @xmath28 _ avoided _ or _ forbidden _ vertices , and the vertices of @xmath51 _ allowed _ vertices .",
    "we define the _ order _ of an edge @xmath53 \\in e(g)$ ] to be @xmath54)= \\frac{1}{2 } \\min(|i - j| , 2n - |i - j|)$ ] .",
    "note that each edge @xmath55 divides the boundary of @xmath23 into two open arcs .",
    "if @xmath56 , then these two arcs contain @xmath57 and @xmath58 vertices of @xmath26 , respectively .",

    "@xmath62 , we say that the edge @xmath50 emanates from the positive - labelled vertex .    for each vertex @xmath63 of @xmath23",
    ", we consider the set of edges on @xmath49 that are perpendicular to the radius @xmath64 .",
    "the edges of this set are parallel",

    "if @xmath0 is even , then their number is @xmath66 for @xmath67 and @xmath68 for @xmath69 .",
    "we say that these are the edges _ in direction @xmath63 .",

    "see the right part of figure  [ fig:2new ] for an illustration of the directions in a cgg on @xmath72 vertices .",
    "a pair of parallel edges on @xmath49 is called _ consecutive _ if each vertex of one edge is adjacent on the boundary of @xmath49 to a vertex of the other edge . throughout the paper ,",
    "we make use of sequences of consecutive parallel edges ( i.e. , sequences of the form @xmath73 , where @xmath74 are consecutive for each @xmath75 ) . of course , all edges in such a sequence belong to the same direction . for each such sequence @xmath76 belonging to the direction @xmath60 , the endpoints of the extremal edges of @xmath76 determine two disjoint open arcs on the boundary of @xmath23 that contain all the remaining vertices of @xmath26 .",

    "( this implies : @xmath82 , and therefore restricts the parity of @xmath81 : we have @xmath83 if and only if @xmath60 is * not * a label of a vertex of @xmath26 . )",
    "for example , in the left part of figure  [ fig:2new ] , the set of edges depicted in bold is @xmath84 , and the two corresponding arcs on the boundary of @xmath23 are @xmath85 ( containing the vertex @xmath86 ) and @xmath87 ( containing the vertices @xmath88 ) .",
    "we note that , by its definition , the set @xmath80 depends also on @xmath0 and @xmath6 . in order to keep the notation concise",
    ", we prefer to leave this dependence implicit , as the values of @xmath11 can always be understood from the context .",
    "it is clear that all the edges in each direction are pairwise disjoint .",
    "hence , if a set of edges does not contain @xmath1 pairwise disjoint edges , then it contains at most @xmath6 edges in each direction . as the number of distinct directions is @xmath0 ,",
    "we get the following observation ( that was already used by kupitz  @xcite ) :    [ obs1 ] let @xmath26 be an @xmath12-free cgg of order @xmath0 .",
    ". moreover , if @xmath90 , then @xmath91 contains exactly @xmath6 edges in each direction .",
    "this implies the upper bound of theorem  [ thm : main](1 ) .",
    "assume now that , in addition , @xmath26 avoids a set @xmath28 of @xmath42 consecutive vertices , for @xmath93 .",
    "in this case , the maximal possible number of edges is reduced , since , in some of the directions , only fewer than @xmath6 edges have at least one endpoint in @xmath51 . for @xmath94",

    "thus , effectively , the allowed arc is extended by @xmath107 vertices on its bottom side , and hence , the number of allowed edges in this direction is @xmath110 .",
    "hence , @xmath111 .",
    "when @xmath107 reaches @xmath103 , the effective length of the allowed arc becomes @xmath112 , and thus , the loss becomes zero . by symmetry ,",
    "the situation for direction @xmath113 is the same as for direction @xmath107 .",
    "therefore , the sum of the losses is @xmath114 where the equality holds by claim  [ claim : triv ] .",
    "the argument above is exemplified in the left drawing of figure  [ fig:3new ] in the special case @xmath115 .",
    "in direction @xmath104 there are only 2 allowed edges , which corresponds to @xmath116 .",
    "the same holds for @xmath117 , and this corresponds to @xmath118 . for @xmath119 , there are already 3 allowed edges , which indeed corresponds to @xmath120 .",
    "finally , we consider the case where @xmath26 avoids a set @xmath28 of @xmath121 consecutive vertices . in this case",
    ", each edge of @xmath26 uses at least one of the vertices of @xmath51 , and since @xmath122 , this implies that @xmath26 is @xmath12-free .",
    "hence , the only restriction on @xmath26 is the avoidance of @xmath28 , which leads to the upper bound @xmath123 on the number of edges ( as there are @xmath124 edges with both endpoints in @xmath28 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the upper bound is clearly attained by the graph @xmath26 that contains all @xmath123 edges with at least one endpoint in @xmath51 , since this graph is @xmath12-free and avoids @xmath28 .",
