    "this suggested interpretation regarding the distribution of angular momentum is frequently used in the physics motivation for experiments as well as the 12 gev upgrade at jefferson lab ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    in this note",
    ", we will investigate whether such an interpretation is justified .",
    "for this purpose , we consider the 2-dimensional fourier transform of @xmath6 .",

    "@xcite originally suggested taking a 3-dimensional fourier transform , most experimental papers that quote the idea that @xmath6 can be used to understand the distribution of angular momentum in the transverse plane consider a 2-dimensional fourier transform .",
    "if the 3-dimensional fourier transform yields information about the distribution in 3-dimensional space then by integrating over the @xmath7 coordinate one reduces the distribution to the transverse plane .",
    "hence , if one can demonstrate that the interpretation of the 2-dimensional fourier transform as the distribution of angular momentum in the transverse plane is flawed , then the interpretation of the 3-dimensional fourier transform must automatically be flawed as well .    using a scalar diquark model",
    ", we will calculate the distribution of quark orbital angular momentum ( oam ) using two complementary approaches : in the first approach , we take the 2-dimensional fourier transform of @xmath6 calculated in this model . from",
    "that we subtract the spin - distribution in the transverse plane evaluated from the same light - cone wave functions that were used to calculate the gpds . in the second approach",
    "we calculate the distribution of quark oam as a function of the impact parameter also directly from the same light - cone wave functions used in the first approach .",
    "we selected the scalar diquark model for this study not because we think it is a good approximation for qcd , but to make a point of principle for which that fact that it is straightforward to maintain lorentz invariance in this model is very important .",
    "furthermore , since it is not a gauge theory , no issues arise as to whether one should include the vector potential in the definition of oam or in which gauge the calculation should be done , i.e. there is no difference between ji s oam ( [ eq : jirelation ] ) and that of jaffe and manohar @xcite .",

    "these observations represent the main result of this work .",
    "we have demonstrated within the context of a scalar yukawa diquark model that although @xmath6 yields , in the limit @xmath42 , the @xmath29 component of the quark angular momentum for a target polarized in the @xmath36 direction , the 2-dimensional fourier transform of its @xmath43-dependence does not yield the distribution of angular momentum in impact parameter space .",
    "this result is best understood by recalling that lorentz / rotational invariance is heavily used when a relation between the angular momentum operator , which is not only leading twist , and twist-2 gpds .",

    "the momentum density in the @xmath29 direction was correlated with the distribution in the transverse direction for a transversely polarized target ( see also ref .",
    "while @xmath44 comprises only half the angular momentum tensor @xmath45 , the two terms in the latter turn out to yield identical contributions - provided the target is invariant under rotations about the @xmath46 axis .",
    "therefore , as long as one considers a target with rotational symmetry about the @xmath46 axis , one can identify the angular momentum in the @xmath46 direction with the expectation value of @xmath47 , which in turn can be identified with off forward matrix elements of the twist two operator @xmath48 ( [ eq : jirelation ] ) .",
    "finally , as long as considering the however , as rotational invariance has been heavily used in this process , the resulting relation ( [ eq : jirelation ] ) should hold for any component of the quark angular momentum for a nucleon polarized in the corresponding direction .",
    "hence one can relate the quark angular momentum in the @xmath29 direction , although it is not _ a priory _ twist-2 , to matrix elements of twist-2 operators .",
    "our explicit calculation has shown that the fourier transform of @xmath6 does not yield the distribution of angular momentum in the transverse plane for a longitudinally polarized target . however , from the discussion above it should also be clear that it can not be interpreted as the distribution of transverse angular momentum in a transversely polarized target : the fourier transform of @xmath6 yields the distribution of @xmath49 . using rotational symmetry arguments , that are applicable only after integration over the position , that can be related to the matrix element of @xmath50 and hence also of @xmath51 . however , this is not possible for the local ( unintegrated ) densities .",
