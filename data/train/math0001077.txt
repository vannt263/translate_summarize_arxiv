    "a smooth compact complex surface with trivial canonical bundle is a k3 surface , a 2-dimensional complex torus , or a primary kodaira surface .",
    "normal crossing degenerations of such surfaces have attracted much attention .",
    "for example , kulikov analyzed projective degenerations of k3 surfaces @xcite .",
    "his results were generalized by persson and pinkham to degenerations of surfaces with trivial canonical bundle whose central fiber has algebraic components @xcite .",
    "conversely , friedman characterized the singular k3 surfaces from kulikov s list that deform to smooth k3 surfaces by his notion of @xmath0-semistability @xcite .    for non - khler degenerations",
    "no general results seem to be known .",
    "we chose primary kodaira surfaces as our object of study because they lack some complications that the more interesting classes of tori and k3 surfaces have . on the other hand ,",
    "kodaira surfaces have a lot in common with tori and , via the kummer construction , with k3 surfaces .",
    "the phenomena one sees in degenerations of kodaira surfaces should therefore also be observable in the other classes of surfaces with trivial canonical bundle .    by a result of borcea",
    "the moduli space @xmath1 of smooth kodaira surfaces is isomorphic to a countable union of copies of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the parameters correspond to the @xmath3-invariant of the elliptic base and a refined @xmath3-invariant of the fiber . as @xmath4",
    "can not be completed to a closed riemann surface by adding finitely many points , it is clear that by studying degenerations we can at most hope for a partial completion of @xmath1 .",
    "the explicit form of the moduli space also suggests the existence of families leading to a degeneration of the base or the fiber to a nodal elliptic curve .",
    "we will see that this is indeed the case .",
    "this leads to a partial completion @xmath5 of each component of @xmath1 .",
    "however , as elliptic curves can degenerate to any @xmath6-cycle of rational curves , this is not the full story .",
    "rather we obtain a whole hierarchy of such completions , that are linked by non - hausdorff phenomena at the boundary .",
    "moreover , we will see that at the most interesting point @xmath7 the picture becomes complicated .",
    "we were not able to fully clarify what happens there .",
    "if one restricts to normal crossing surfaces one should certainly blow up this point . on the other hand , we will also make the presumably not so surprising observation that , as in the case of abelian varieties @xcite , it does not suffice to restrict to normal crossing varieties .",
    "we did however find families of generalized kodaira surfaces mapping properly to @xmath8 , whose singularities are at most products of normal crossing singularities .",
    "the bulk of the paper is concerned with a classification of irreducible , @xmath0-semistable , locally normal crossing surfaces @xmath9 with @xmath10 .",
    "three different types occur .",
    "our main result is a description of the resulting completion @xmath11 , derived by deformation theory .",
    "the three different types correspond to three different parts in the boundary @xmath12 .",
    "each part is a countable union of copies of @xmath4 or @xmath13 . locally along the boundary divisor",
    "the completion @xmath11 looks like the blowing - up of @xmath14 , with two points on the exceptional divisor removed .",
    "some examples for degenerations of kodaira surfaces have previously been given by friedman and shepherd - barron in @xcite .",
    "this article is divided into six sections .",
    "the first section contains general facts about smooth kodaira surfaces . in the second section",
    "we describe their potential degenerations and show that three types are possible .",
    "sections 35 contain an analysis of each type . in the final section",
    "we assemble our results in terms of moduli spaces , complemented by some examples of smoothable surfaces with singularities that are products of normal crossings .",
    "we thank the referee for suggestions concerning theorem  3.10 and the interpretation of the completed moduli space after proposition  [ boundary components ] .",
    "this paper is dedicated to hans grauert on the occasion of his 70th birthday .",
    "the second author wants to take this opportunity to express his gratitude for the support and mathematical stimulus he received from him as one of his last students .",
    "it was a great pleasure to learn from him .",
    "in this section we collect some facts on primary kodaira surfaces .",

    "is called a _ primary kodaira surface_. for simplicity , we refer to such surfaces as kodaira surfaces .",
    "kodaira surfaces have three invariants .",
    "the first invariant is the degree @xmath27 .",
    "it determines the underlying topological space .",
    "the universal coefficient theorem gives @xmath28 hence the degree @xmath0 is also the order of the torsion subgroup of the nron - severi group @xmath29 .",
    "the second invariant is the @xmath3-invariant of @xmath30 .",
    "it depends only on @xmath9 : since @xmath31 is odd , @xmath9 is nonalgebraic .",
    "moreover , since @xmath17 has connected fibers it is the algebraic reduction and so the fibration structure does not depend on choices .",

    "one can check that this @xmath45 agrees with the invariant @xmath45 above .",
    "it follows that the isomorphism classes of kodaira surfaces correspond bijectively to the triples @xmath46 .",
