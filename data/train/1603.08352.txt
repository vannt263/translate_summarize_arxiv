    "this paper is devoted to the memory of george stell who was one of the leaders in the statistical - mechanical theory of the liquid state for the last fifty years .",
    "the study of the effects of an adsorbent on phase behaviour of an ionic fluid is far from being solved in spite of its great practical importance . to our knowledge",
    ", there is no theory capable of correctly describing the phase behaviour of confined ionic liquids even within the simplest models .",
    "by contrast , the phase transitions and criticality in bulk coulomb - dominated systems have been intensively studied for the past decades .",
    "the issue was among the major research interests of george stell @xcite . for reviews of experimental and theoretical situation",
    "see @xcite and the references cited therein . a simple description of systems dominated by coulomb interactions is provided by the restricted primitive model ( rpm ) that consists of an equal number of equisized positively and negatively charged hard spheres immersed into structureless dielectric continuum .",
    "the rpm undergoes a vapour - liquid - like phase transition at low temperatures and low densities @xcite .",
    "the existing theoretical approaches consider fluids in disordered confinements as a partly - quenched system in which some of the degrees of freedom are quenched while the others are annealed @xcite . in this case ,",
    "statistical - mechanical averages used for calculations of thermodynamic properties become double ensemble averages : the first average is taken over all degrees of freedom of annealed particles keeping the quenched particles fixed , and the other average is performed over all realizations of a matrix .",
    "the application of the replica method made it possible to relate the matrix averaged quantities to the thermodynamic quantities of a corresponding fully equilibrated model , called the replicated model @xcite .",
    "the major part of theoretical studies of partly - quenched systems containing charges was mainly focused on structural and thermodynamic properties within the framework of the replica ornstein - zernike ( roz ) theory ( see review  @xcite and the references cited therein ) . the studies of the phase behaviour of partly - quenched models using the roz were concerned with the systems characterized by short - range interactions @xcite . however , unlike bulk fluids , no analytical result has been obtained from the roz integral equation approach even for a hard - sphere fluid confined in a hard - sphere matrix , being the model of particular importance for the development of perturbation theories .",
    "recently , a pure analytical approach has been developed to describe the thermodynamics of liquids confined in disordered porous materials composed of rigid particles @xcite .",
    "this approach is based on the scaled - particle theory ( spt ) @xcite and is capable of rather correctly reproducing thermodynamic properties of confined fluids .",
    "although the spt is limited to hard - core interaction between molecules , it can be used for the description of a reference system within the perturbation theory to study different complex systems with attractive , repulsive , and associative interactions @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to study the vapour - liquid phase behaviour of the rpm confined in a random porous matrix formed by uncharged particles .",
    "we start with a more general model when the interaction potentials between the two matrix particles and between the ion and the matrix particle include a short - range attraction / repulsion in addition to a hard - core repulsion .",
    "furthermore , the ions and the matrix particles differ in size . following the formalism originally proposed by madden and gland for a one - component system in a disordered porous matrix @xcite",
    ", we consider our matrix - fluid system as a partly - quenched model .",
    "combining the collective variable ( cv ) method @xcite with the spt , we develop a theoretical approach which allows us to formulate the perturbation theory and to treat the model of an uncharged hard - sphere fluid in an uncharged hard - sphere matrix as a reference system . it should be noted that the cv method is a useful tool for the study of phase transitions in systems with coulomb interactions @xcite . using the replica trick",
    ", we derive an expression for the grand partition function ( gpf ) of a wholly equilibrated ( @xmath0)-component system in the form of a functional integral . in the limit @xmath1",
    ", we obtain explicit expressions for the helmholtz free energy and the corresponding chemical potential of an ionic fluid in the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) . for the particular case of neglecting matrix - matrix and matrix - fluid interactions outside the hard core , we calculate vapour - liquid coexistence curves of the rpm confined in hard - sphere matrices of different porosity .",
    "it should be noted that for the unconfined ( bulk ) state , the rpa , just as the standard debye - hckel theory and the mean - spherical approximation @xcite , predicts the critical point parameters widely deviating from the simulation data @xcite . in order to correct the situation we derive an explicit equation for the vapour - liquid spinodal using the method proposed in @xcite for the bulk rpm .",
    "the method produces vapour - liquid critical parameters of the rpm in particular , the critical temperature , which are in good agreement with simulation results . the resulting equation for the spinodal includes isothermal compressibility of the reference system and its first and second derivatives .",
    "in this approximation , the trends of the critical parameters ( maximum points of the spinodals ) with the matrix characteristics are the same as those obtained in the rpa .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in section  2",
    "we present a theoretical formalism . in section  3",
    "we calculate the vapour - liquid phase diagrams of the rpm confined in a disordered hard - sphere matrix in two approximations , i.e. , in the rpa and in the approximation which takes into account the effects of the higher - order correlations .",
    "the discussion of the effects of matrix properties on the phase diagrams is also presented here .",
    "we draw conclusions in section 4 .",
    "our matrix / ionic - fluid system contains two subsystems : the first one ( i.e. , matrix ) is composed of particles quenched or frozen in place , while the second subsystem is an annealed ( or allowed to equilibrate ) binary ionic fluid which is in equilibrium with the matrix",

    "the chemical potential for a hard - sphere fluid in a hard - sphere matrix was obtained .",

    "as one can observe , both the critical temperature @xmath169 and the critical densities @xmath170 are lowering with the decrease of the matrix porosity .",
    "simultaneously , the region of vapour - liquid coexistence is getting narrower .",
    "this common behaviour is observed for many other types of fluids .",
    "since our model does not contain any attractive interactions between the fluid and matrix particles , only two most essential effects can play the role : the effect of excluded volume occupied by the matrix particles and the weakening of attraction between the fluid particles due to the presence of matrix particles . in comparison with the bulk fluid ( @xmath171 )",
    ", the first effect leads to an increase of the fluid local density that is why the total density can be smaller than in the bulk case .",

    "consists in the fact that the porosity @xmath157 takes into account the size of adsorbate particles , while the porosity @xmath172 is an adsorbate - independent characteristic .",
    "both of these porosities are important .",
    "the geometrical porosity defines a  bare  pore volume of the matrix and it can be considered as a more general characteristic . on the other hand , it does not take into account that some pores are inaccessible for the given fluid molecules due to their sizes : a distance between the opposite pore walls can be less than the diameter of fluid particles .",
    "by contrast , the probe - particle porosity @xmath157 defines a  real  pore volume , which is accessible for the fluid under study .    , but at the fixed porosities @xmath173  ( a ) and @xmath174  ( b ) .",

    "[ fig : fig2 ] we present vapour - liquid phase diagrams for the rpm fluid in matrices formed by particles of different sizes , but at constant porosities @xmath155 ( panel  a ) and @xmath157 ( panel  b ) .",
    "as one can see , there are opposite dependencies of critical parameters on the ratio of fluid and matrix particles @xmath164 . to understand this behaviour",
    "it should be noted that the probe - particle porosity is always less than or equal to the geometrical porosity ( @xmath177 ) .",
    "moreover , both porosities become equivalent in the limit @xmath178 , when a bulk - like fluid at the effective density @xmath179 is obtained  @xcite .",
    "the bulk - like fluid can be reached due to a negligibly small effect of a pore surface in this limit : a specific pore surface area vanishes with respect to the specific free volume .",
    "hence , the fraction of inaccessible pores in the system tends to zero as well .",
    "therefore , if the porosity @xmath172 is fixed and the ratio @xmath164 decreases ( figure  [ fig : fig2]a ) , then the porosity @xmath157 increases . as it is shown in the previous figure , an increase of the porosity @xmath157 leads to an increase of @xmath175 and @xmath176 . in the case",
    "when the porosity @xmath157 is constant , but @xmath164 decreases ( figure  [ fig : fig2]b ) , one observes that the critical temperature and density decrease as well .",
    "this seeming contradiction can be explained by the fact that the specific free volume which makes a greater contribution to the thermodynamics of the system than the specific pore surface area effect , decreases in this case .",

    ", the rpa strongly overestimates the critical temperature by giving @xmath185 @xcite . the critical density obtained in the above - mentioned approximation",
    "is still underestimated ( @xmath186 ) when compared with the simulation results ( @xmath187 ) @xcite , but it is much better than in the case of the rpa giving @xmath188 @xcite .",
    "such an improvement achieved when the effects of higher - order correlations are taken into account has motivated us to extend this approach to the case of the rpm fluid confined in a hard - sphere matrix .    .",
    "the results are obtained by using equation ( [ spinodal]).,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    using ( [ spinodal ] ) and ( [ g_k ] ) in a combination with equations  ( [ a_1])-([a_6 ] ) we have calculated spinodals for the vapour - liquid phase transition of the rpm fluid in matrices of different porosities @xmath157 , but at the constant value of @xmath168  ( figure  [ fig : fig4 ] ) . from the obtained results one can observe the same qualitative dependence of the critical temperature and density on the matrix porosity , i.e. both parameters decrease with a decrease of @xmath157 .",
    "however , it is seen that in comparison with the rpa results ( figure  [ fig : fig1 ] ) the critical parameters obtained in the approximation given by ( [ spinodal ] ) are more sensible to the variation of matrix porosity .    , but at the fixed porosities @xmath173 ( a ) and @xmath174 ( b ) .",

    "therefore , it should be acknowledged that this sensibility to the matrix porosity is directly related to taking into account the higher - order terms .",

    "this is one more distinction between the rpa and the results obtained in the higher - order approximation . as usual ,",
    "@xmath169 and @xmath170 for smaller matrix particles ( @xmath168 ) are lower than for larger ones ( @xmath181 ) . besides that",

    "one can notice interesting dependencies for the both cases , where a linear behaviour is obtained . the same type of behaviour is found for the critical parameters obtained in the rpa .",
    "we have studied the effects of disordered porous media on the vapour - liquid phase behaviour of a model ionic fluid consisting of an electroneutral equimolar mixture of equisized charged hard spheres immersed in a structureless dielectric continuum ( the so - called rpm model ) .",
    "to this end , based on an extended madden - gland model , we have developed a theoretical approach which combines the method of cvs with the spt theory reformulated recently for a hard - sphere fluid confined in a disordered hard - sphere matrix .",
    "while the cv theory appears to be successful in studying the phase behaviour of the systems with coulomb interactions , the spt provides an accurate analytical description of the thermodynamic properties of the reference system , i.e. , the system including a hard - sphere repulsion .",
    "we have formulated a theory for the system in which , in addition to a hard - core repulsion , pair ( repulsive / attractive ) interactions between the matrix particles and between the ions and the matrix particles are taken into account .    in this contribution , we have obtained an analytical expression for the chemical potential of a model ionic fluid in a disordered matrix formed by uncharged hard spheres in the rpa .",
    "based on this expression , we have calculated the vapor - liquid binodals and have analyzed the effects of the matrix characteristics ( geometrical and probe - particle porosities and a size ratio of matrix and fluid particles ) on the coexistence envelope . also , using the method proposed previously for the bulk rpm , we have derived an explicit equation for the vapour - liquid spinodal which takes into account the effects of the third- and fourth - order correlations .",
    "since this method allows us to obtain a good quantitative agreement with simulation data for the critical parameters of an unconfined rpm , we suppose that it has produced reasonable quantitative results for the system under consideration .",
    "both approximations have yielded the same dependence of the vapour - liquid phase diagram on the matrix characteristics , i.e. , with a decrease of porosity the critical point shifts toward lower fluid densities and lower temperatures and the region of coexistence is getting narrower .",
    "it has also been observed that for the fixed matrix porosity , both the critical temperature and the critical density increase with an increase of the size of matrix particles and tend to the critical values found for the bulk rpm .    in conclusion , the vapour - liquid behaviour of the rpm confined in random hard - sphere matrices characterized by different porosities and by different hard - sphere diameters has been studied for the first time .",
    "the rpm is the simplest model of ionic fluids which does not take into account the charge , size and shape asymmetry of ions being usually typical of real ionic systems .",
    "thus , the theory should be developed to be capable of describing phase diagrams of more complex models .",
    "the work in this direction is in progress .",
    "quantities @xmath148 and @xmath149 given by ( [ s_n ] ) can be presented in terms of the derivatives with respect to @xmath192 ( @xmath154 ) as follows : @xmath193 .",
