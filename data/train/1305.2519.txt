    "what is the value of a physical property prior to a measurement or between two measurements ? in the context of standard quantum mechanics the question does not make sense : trying to answer the question implies disturbing the system thereby changing the nature of the experiment .",
    "appealing to counterfactual arguments to understand the situation rarely helps , as one is usually led to apparent paradoxes and odd behavior , such as answering the `` which path ? ''",
    "question in the well - known wheeler delayed choice experiment @xcite .",
    "the three box thought - experiment proposed by aharonov and vaidman @xcite leads to that type of situation .",
    "the setup involves three separate boxes @xmath0 @xmath1 and @xmath2 and one particle .",
    "given suitable initial and final wavefunctions ( consisting of a cleverly chosen superposition of the particle being in one of the boxes ) , one wants to know in which box the particle can be found at some intermediate time . the quantum formalism seems to indicate that if a measurement could be made to detect the particle in , say box @xmath3 , while allowing the system to reach the final state , then the particle would be found in box @xmath3 with certainty .",
    "but if box @xmath1 was opened instead , then the particle would also be found there with certainty , although it is of course impossible to find with certainty a single particle in two different boxes .",
    "a closely related setup involves a particle and one of its property , e.g. , the spin : the particle appears to have taken with certainty one of two given paths ( on the ground that if the particle presence along the other path could be measured  while allowing the system to reach the final state  the probability of finding it there would be zero ) while the spin appears to have taken the other path with certainty .",
    "this setup , which has recently received increased interest @xcite , was given @xcite the suggestive name of `` cheshire cat '' since the grin ( the property ) appears to be separated from the cat ( the particle ) .",
    "these apparent paradoxes are based on counterfactual inferences  opening a box disturbs the system which does not reach the final state  so that , irrespective of whether trying to answer the `` which path ? '' or `` which box ? ''",
    "question is or not legitimate , the effects can not be observed .",
    "however counterfactual reasoning can to some extent be bypassed by employing a scheme known as weak measurement ( wm ) @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the usual projective measurements , a wm consists of a weak unitary interaction coupling the system with a meter .",
    "the system , largely unperturbed , reaches the final state .",
    "the meter wavefunction correlated with that final state indicates the _ weak value _ of the weakly measured system observable .",
    "wm  thus appear as a tool to open non - invasively the boxes and assert what is happening inside . indeed wms have been employed experimentally in dozens of works , essentially with optical setups , confirming the theoretical predictions ( though the interpretation of wm remains a controversial topic ) .",
    "in particular an optical version of the three - box experiment was realized @xcite in a modified mach - zehnder style interferometer .    in this work ,",
    "we propose a theoretical implementation of the three - box setup and of a `` cheshire cat grin '' scheme employing spin- 1 particles .",
    "we will have more specifically in mind spin-1  atoms , that have been extensively manipulated in atomic interferometry experiments @xcite , including the use of stern - gerlach type of devices that are the essential tool in the setups presented below .",
    "one motivation is that while an optical three - box experiment can be explained in classical terms ( based on classical interference effects ) , this is of course not the case of experiments performed with massive particles .",
    "moreover , the theoretical account employing spin-1 atoms involves the explicit wavepacket dynamical evolution , contrary to the original idealized three - box thought - experiment . employing a well - defined physical system dispels in our view many ambiguities that have given rise to controversies ( eg refs .",
    "@xcite ) discussed in relation with the ideal three - box paradox .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the original three - box paradoxes , either based on counterfactual arguments or on wms are recalled in sec .",
    "the implementation of the thought - experiment with spin-1 particles is described in sec .",
    "[ 3bspin ] .",
    "a cheshire cat grin type of scheme , based on the setup described in sec .",
    "[ 3bspin ] , is developed in sec .",
    "[ catsec ] , with the `` grin '' taken to be the spin projection on a chosen axis . the results and their significance along with some remarks in view of a possible experimental implementation with atoms of the proposed schemes",
    "is given in sec .",
    "the three - box paradox @xcite is usually presented in the context of time - symmetric quantum mechanics ( tsqm ) @xcite as illustrating a complete description of a quantum system at any time given a fixed initial ( known as ",
    "pre - selected \" ) state and a fixed final ( termed as  post - selected \" ) state .",
    "assume we have a quantum system that can be in one of the three boxes @xmath4 or @xmath2 .",
    "the mutually orthogonal states @xmath5 @xmath6 and @xmath7 label the particle being in one of the respective boxes .",
    "let the system be initially @xmath8 prepared in the state@xmath9 and post - selected at @xmath10 to the final state@xmath11 what would happen if one of the boxes is opened at some intermediate time between @xmath12 and @xmath13 ?",
    "assume box @xmath3 is opened ; if the particle is found there , this means the initial state has been projected to state @xmath14 through @xmath15 where @xmath16 if the particle is not found there , then the state after box @xmath3 is opened is @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the complement of @xmath19 .",
    "however the transition amplitude @xmath20 to the final post - selected state vanishes , so the probability of not finding the particle in box @xmath0 proportional to @xmath21 is zero : the conclusion is therefore that the particle _ must _ have been with certainty in box @xmath22    a contradiction arises by repeating the same argument assuming now that box @xmath1 is opened .",
    "if the particle is not found in box @xmath1 , then the state after box @xmath1 has been opened is @xmath23 with @xmath24 .",
    "but @xmath25 so on its way from @xmath26 to @xmath27 the particle _ must _ have been with certainty in box @xmath1 ! of course , a single particle can not be with certainty in two different boxes at the same time , hence the paradox .",
    "the paradox is apparently dissolved by remarking that quantum mechanics does not allow this type of counterfactual reasoning .",
    "it does not make sense , according to the standard interpretation , to demand a `` complete '' description of the behavior of the system between @xmath28 and @xmath29 without actually making a measurement at box @xmath3 and/or box @xmath1 that will disturb the system .  in particular , opening the two boxes",
    "jointly will yield a single particle either in box @xmath3 or box @xmath1 ( or none ) , and the quantum formalism consistently predicts @xmath30 nevertheless actually performing these measurements changes the nature of the experiment : the particle never reaches the final state @xmath27 , either because it is detected in the box or because post - selection is not succesful if it is undetected , leaving the original question relative to the behavior of the system at an intermediate time unanswered .",
    "wm represents a tool that provides a certain type of answer to the question .",
    "briefly put , the main idea consists in two steps : first a system in a preselected state weakly interacts unitarily with an apparatus , resulting in an entangled system - apparatus state ; the interaction couples a system observable @xmath31 with a dynamical variable of the apparatus .",
    "then a standard projective measurement of a different system observable is made ; one retains only the outcomes leaving the system in the chosen post - selected state .",
    "the corresponding projection leaves the apparatus wavefunction in a certain final state .  under certain conditions , basically amounting to a very weak interaction and widely overlapping meter states @xcite ,",
    "the final state is simply shifted relative to the initial state , the shift being proportional to the weak value @xmath32 of the system observable that was weakly coupled to the meter .",
    "the weak value is given by@xmath33    in the present context , we see that wm allow to obtain information on some system observable @xmath31 at some intermediate time while the system evolves from @xmath28 to @xmath34indeed , the weak coupling barely affects the system while the meter wavefunction picks up a phase shift that can in principle be experimentally detected .",
    "wm thus appears as a way to bypass counterfactual reasoning and access to what is happening in a system between the initial and final states .",
    "the analysis of the three - box paradox with wm @xcite involves replacing the measurements ( box openings ) and their associated projectors @xmath35 with weak measurements and the respective weak values @xmath36",
    "@xmath37  from the state definitions ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 3 ] ) it is straightforward to apply eq .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) .",
    "this gives @xmath38 meaning that an apparatus weakly interacting with box @xmath3 will move , but that a single meter that would weakly open boxes @xmath1 and @xmath2 jointly ( see below for a definite example in the context of spin-1  particles ) will not display any shift . if wms were to be interpreted along the same line as projective measurements , the conclusion would be that on its way to @xmath27 the particle went through box @xmath3 .",
    "however we also have @xmath39 leading to the conclusion that on its way to @xmath29 the particle went through box @xmath40 but now , unlike the case with projective measurements discussed above , no counterfactual arguments are involved : if two apparati openweakly boxes @xmath3 and @xmath1 respectively , we will have jointly @xmath41 _ and _ @xmath42 . in one sense",
    "the paradox is back again , though whether with wm  there is a real paradox involved or whether wm allows to observe the superpositions typical of quantum phenomena is largely a matter of interpretation ( see sec .",
    "[ disc ] below ) .",
    "the three - box paradox , as initially proposed in @xcite , was realized experimentally with photons @xcite .  as remarked by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , the effects giving rise to the paradox have a classical optical explanation in terms of the classical interference of light . on the other hand spin-1 particles would allow to realize experimentally the three - box paradox with matter waves . here",
    "we will simply describe the spin-1  version of the three - box paradox without consideration of any experimental realization ( a possible experimental realization is outlined in sec . [ disc ] ) .",

    "we assume that paths b and c are recombined first and then recombined with path a ( as shown in the figure 1 ) .",
    "these recombinations are assumed to take place without affecting the spin state nor the phase difference .",

    "we have therefore realized a setup for the manifestation of a `` cheshire cat '' with spin-1systems since the grin ( @xmath124 ) appears to be `` disembodied '' from the cat ( the particle ) .",

    "[ 3bspin ] is really constitutive of a paradox , or perhaps more strikingly , whether there is anything like `` disembodiment '' of a property in the cheshire cat setup presented above hinges on the status of weak measurements .",
    "indeed , wm has remained controversial since their inception ; the terms of the controversy ultimately depend on the options taken on the meaning of the theoretical entities of the quantum formalism .",
    "while the discussion of these options with regard to the status of weak measurements is out of the scope of the present paper @xcite , we will nevertheless make a few remarks relative to the setups discussed above .",
    "the crucial difference between wms and projective measurements is that the latter suppresses the entangled linear superposition of system - apparatus states ( as if a collapse to a single term in the pointer basis had taken place ) while the former retains the full wave aspect of the quantum system .",
    "for example in dynamical systems , where the system wavefunction is characterized by a `` sum over paths '' as prescribed by feynman s propagator , an array of apparati weakly interacting with the system should allow in principle to detect the wavefunction simultaneously propagating along the available paths @xcite provided the paths are sufficiently isolated from one another .",
    "the `` strength '' of weak measurements is to capture this wave phenomenon  too often thought of as being a computational artifact  with apparati weakly coupled to the system . here",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig j=1 setup ] ) the apparati placed at @xmath152 @xmath96 and @xmath153 monitor the wave properties along the different paths .    the aspect of weak values as measuring the transition amplitudes  generically written @xmath154 in the notation of sec .",
    "[ swm ]  is well illustrated in the cheshire cat grin scheme .",

    "this is the case , according to eqs .",
    "( [ 73])-([74 ] ) , of the transition generated by the measurement of @xmath124 along path @xmath3 and of the transition generated by the position projection along the path @xmath72 .",
    "associating a vanishing weak value with a forbidden transition toward a final state is therefore perfectly cogent within standard quantum mechanics  provided it is kept in mind that the wavepackets take all the available paths simultaneously .",
    "finally , a possible  tentative manner to implement experimentally the schemes developed above for spin-1  particles would be to employ atoms in setups based on well - established atomic interferometry experiments @xcite .",
    "for example based on the setup of ref .",
    "@xcite ( a so called `` _ _ stern - gerlach atom interferometer _ _ '' ) , hydrogen atoms can be prepared in the initial state @xmath155 ( where @xmath156 denotes the total angular momentum of the hyperfine hamiltonian ) and passed in a region containing a magnetic field .",
    "this yields a coherent superposition of atoms in different states @xmath55 that is finally projected to a desired final state by using a polarizer and a time of flight detection scheme .",
    "the weak measurement of the projectors @xmath157 @xmath71 etc .",
    "could be realized by a selective laser excitation of a given @xmath158 manifold .",
    "if the excitation pulse is an @xmath159 photon coherent state , the measurement is weak provided @xmath159 is large ( the detection of the overlap between the original state @xmath160 and the @xmath161 photon state after absorption of a photon gives almost no information on the path ) and the transition to an excited state does not change the kinetic energy of the atomic wavepacket .",
    "we note that a closely related problem ( a three box quantum game in which individual boxes can be addressed , though the resulting wavefunctions can not be recombined ) has been very recently realized experimentally with a three - level system using the @xmath162n nuclear spin ( @xmath163 ) of the nitrogen vacancy center in diamond , the preparation and readout being performed by manipulating the nv@xmath164 electronic spin ( @xmath165 )  with @xmath166 and @xmath167 selective microwave pulses @xcite .    as for the cheshire cat property @xmath168 , it could be possible to observe experimentally this property indirectly by inducing at @xmath144 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) a weak rotation of @xmath169 along the axis @xmath170 by a small angle @xmath171 . if the rotation is sufficiently weak so that @xmath172 holds ( while still being detectable in the statistics of the post - selection ) , then a rotation along path @xmath3 will not affect the state prior to post - selection , since @xmath173 , the last term vanishing by eq .",

    "hence the rotation at @xmath144 will have no effect and will not modify the post - selection statistics , a statement that is equivalent to having a vanishing weak value @xmath174 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the same weak rotation along @xmath127 generated by @xmath124 is performed at @xmath132 , @xmath139 or @xmath136 then the post - selection statistics determined experimentally will be affected , and will be so in exactly the same way .",
    "thus everything happens as if @xmath124 had travelled along the route @xmath175 , but not along path @xmath22    summarizing , we have given a proposal implementing the three - box paradox and a cheshire cat grin scheme for massive spin-1 systems . besides giving a concrete rendering of paradigmatic examples of weak measurements , employing a definite physical system sheds light on the peculiar quantum properties unraveled by weak measurements while avoiding the ambiguities of the original ideal three - box setup that have given rise to several controversies . in principle the proposed schemes could be implemented in atomic interferometry experiments .",
