    "among the results obtained with inelastic neutron scattering is the detailed information on the magnetic susceptibility in yba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 and lanthanum cuprates which reveals a considerable difference in their magnetic properties . a sharp magnetic collective mode ",

    "instead for low temperatures a broad feature was detected at @xmath11  mev and for this and lower frequencies the susceptibility was found to be peaked at incommensurate momenta @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xcite . recently the low - frequency incommensurate magnetic response was also observed in yba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 @xcite .",

    "the peak is connected with the excitation branch of localized cu spins and the peak frequency is close to the frequency of these excitations at * q*. the absence of the resonance peak in lanthanum cuprates is related to an increased damping of spin excitations which is possibly connected with a large hole damping in these crystals . for low frequencies and temperatures the susceptibility is peaked at incommensurate wave vectors @xmath12 and @xmath17 . the incommensurability is connected with a dip in the magnon damping at * q*. in agreement with experiment the incommensurability parameter @xmath18 is approximately proportional to @xmath19 for @xmath20 and saturates for larger concentrations .",

    "[ fig_ii ] , the resonance peak has a low - frequency shoulder which is more pronounced for low concentrations and temperatures .",
    "the shoulder stems from the frequency dependence of the magnon damping @xmath118 which in its turn is a consequence of the hole fermi surface nesting existing in the @xmath0-@xmath1 model for moderate doping @xcite .",

    "the upper parabola with branches pointed up reflects the dispersion of spin excitations , while the lower parabola with branches pointed down stems from the momentum dependence of the spin excitation damping . in the considered mechanism the magnetic incommensurability",
