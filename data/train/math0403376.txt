    "let us explain how one can `` see '' characteristics of arbitrary period by using @xmath71-periodic orbits of special hamiltonians .",

    "it is straightforward to see that @xmath143 the @xmath71-periodic orbits of @xmath115 that are located on the level @xmath44 correspond to characteristics on @xmath3 having period @xmath144 under the parameterization given by @xmath145 .",
    "the general principle that can be extracted out of this computation is that _ one `` sees '' more and more characteristics as the variation of @xmath146 is bigger and bigger_.    we define a hamiltonian to be _ admissible _ if it satisfies @xmath147 on @xmath8 and it is of the form @xmath148 for @xmath44 big enough .",
    "it is clear that the a priori @xmath149 bounds require no additional argument than the one in @xcite .",

    "we call such a hamiltonian _ linear at infinity_. moreover , we assume that the slope at infinity of @xmath146 is not the area of a closed characteristic on @xmath3 and that all @xmath71-periodic orbits of @xmath95 are nondegenerate .",
    "one method to obtain such hamiltonians is to slightly perturb functions @xmath153 , where @xmath154 is equal to zero in a neighbourhood of @xmath155 , strictly convex on @xmath156 and linear at infinity with slope different from the area of any closed characteristic , by a perturbation localized around the periodic orbits .",
    "we point out that there are admissible hamiltonians having arbitrarily large values of the slope at infinity .",
    "the _ admissible almost complex structures _ are defined to be those which satisfy the following conditions for _ large enough values of @xmath44 _ : @xmath157 where @xmath158 is an almost complex structure compatible with the restriction of @xmath4 to the contact distribution @xmath159 on @xmath3 .",
    "these are precisely the almost complex structures which are invariant under homotheties @xmath160 , @xmath161 for large enough values of @xmath44 .",
    "the crucial fact is that the function @xmath162 is plurisubharmonic with respect to this class of almost complex structures .",
    "this means that @xmath163 for any nonzero @xmath164 , @xmath165 , @xmath166 big enough , and indeed we have @xmath167 .",
    "plurisubharmonicity implies that for any @xmath43-holomorphic curve @xmath168 , @xmath169 big enough one has @xmath170 .",
    "in particular the maximum of @xmath171 is achieved on the boundary @xmath172 ( see for example @xcite , theorem 3.1 ) .",
    "a similar argument applies to solutions of the floer equation ( [ fl eq ] ) , as well as to solutions of the parameterized floer equation ( [ par fl eq ] ) for _ increasing homotopies _ satisfying @xmath173  @xcite .",
    "this implies that solutions are contained in an a priori determined compact set .",
    "all compactness results in floer s theory therefore carry over to this situation and so does the construction outlined for closed manifolds .",
    "we introduce a partial order on regular pairs @xmath174 as @xmath175 the continuation morphisms ( [ cont morph ] ) form a direct system with respect to this order and we define the floer homology groups as @xmath176 an important refinement of the definition consists in using a truncation by the values of the action .",
    "the latter is decreasing along floer trajectories and one builds a @xmath71-parameter family of subcomplexes of @xmath177 , defined as @xmath178-\\infty,\\ , a[}(h , \\ ,",

    "we therefore put @xmath180    let us now make a few remarks on the properties of the above invariants .    1 .",
    "there is a natural cofinal family of hamiltonians whose values of the action on the @xmath71-periodic orbits is positive or arbitrarily close to @xmath181 ( see the construction of @xmath182 in figure [ hamplateau et rho ] ( 1 ) described in section  [ la preuve de kunneth ] ) .",
    "this implies that @xmath183 if @xmath184 and @xmath185 does not depend on @xmath186 if the latter is strictly negative .",
    "in particular we have @xmath187 2 .",
    "the infimum @xmath188 of the areas of closed characteristics on the boundary is always strictly positive and therefore @xmath189 where @xmath190 , @xmath191 , @xmath192 .",
    "this follows from the fact that , in the limit , the hamiltonians become @xmath114-small on @xmath193 and the floer complex reduces to a morse complex that computes the relative cohomology , as @xmath194 points inward along @xmath3 .",
    "3 .   there are obvious truncation morphisms @xmath195 which induce morphisms @xmath196 , @xmath197 , @xmath198 .",
    "if @xmath199 , @xmath200 and @xmath201 we obtain a natural morphism @xmath202 or , written differently , @xmath203 we also note at this point that we have @xmath204 and that the two limits above can be interchanged by general properties of bi - directed systems .    *",

    "the `` undesired guest '' in the first case or the `` killer '' in the second case necessarily corresponds to a closed characteristic on @xmath3 .",
    "the version of floer homology that we defined above has various invariance properties @xcite .",
    "the main one that we shall use is the following .",

    "before beginning the proof , let us note that the natural class of manifolds for which one can _ define _ floer homology groups for a product is that of manifolds with restricted contact type boundary .",

    "we refer to  @xcite for a discussion of the weaker notion of asymptotic linearity and a proof of the fact that @xmath238 does not even belong to this extended admissible class .",
