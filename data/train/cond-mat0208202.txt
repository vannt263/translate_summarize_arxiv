    "[ p5ab_fec]a ) yields near - quantitative agreement with the experiment , indicating that the difference in ionic conditions accounts for most of the discrepancy .",

    "for instance , the total binding free energy and the size of the hairpin can be read off by comparing to the fec for a non - binding control sequence . within our theoretical model",
    ", such control curves are obtained through a convolution of the wlc model ( [ wlc ] ) for the linker with the freely - jointed chain model for the single - stranded rna .",
    "the resulting curves could also be used as a reference for the experimental data , although ideally the control curve should be measured , using e.g. an oligonucleotide with a homogeneous sequence ( note that it suffices to record the control for a single sequence length , since it can be straightforwardly rescaled to an arbitrary length ) .",

    "since stretching the control sequence requires only work against entropic and elastic forces , while stretching of the p5ab hairpin requires additional work to break the basepairs , the area between the two fec s equals the total binding free energy of p5ab . as fig .",
    "[ p5ab_fec](b ) shows , not only the region of the p5ab fec where the basepairs are opened ( the `` hump '' region ) contributes to this area , but there is also a significant contribution from the initial part of the fec .",
    "the initial part of the p5ab fec corresponds to stretching the exterior single - stranded chain of the molecule , which is shorter than the full molecule and hence has higher entropic / elastic forces at the same extension .",
    "however , this additional entropic / elastic energy is `` stored '' in the molecule and is fully released when the hairpin is ( adiabatically ) unzipped , i.e. in the `` hump '' region . note",
    "that as long as the experiment is performed in quasi - equilibrium , the area under the fec is independent of the spring constant , and therefore the same in the fixed - force and the fixed - distance ensemble .",

    "instead , we determine the _ amplitude _ of the equilibrium fluctuations in the end - to - end extension , @xmath47 , as a function of the mean force or extension . experimentally , this amplitude would be determined as a time - average , @xmath48 , where @xmath49 denotes the recorded time trace of the end - to - end extension and @xmath50 its average .",

    "mechanical single - molecule experiments offer a very controlled way to probe the folding process . in the quasi - equilibrium limit that we consider , the mechanical folding pathway is independent of ( i ) the direction , i.e. unfolding and refolding pathway are identical , and ( ii ) specific experimental parameters such as the spring constant @xmath0 .",

    "this prediction is consistent with the experimental observation of smooth fec s for long ssdna molecules @xcite .",
    "three physical effects are responsible for the smoothness : ( i ) the ` floppiness ' of the external single - strand and the linkers , ( ii ) thermal fluctuations in the secondary structure , i.e. the contribution of suboptimal structures , and most importantly , ( iii ) the fact that changes in the extension of individual structural subunits can compensate each other , since only the total end - to - end distance is measured @xcite . as a result",
    ", quasi - equilibrium fec s can not be used to study the folding pathway ( or the secondary structure ) of larger rna molecules .",
    "the smoothing mechanisms ( ii ) and ( iii ) can be strongly suppressed by performing the experiments at large pulling speeds which do not leave sufficient time for the molecule to sample the entire ensemble of different secondary structures with similar number of exterior unpaired bases , @xmath7 , and free energy of folding .",
    "hence , nonequilibrium fec s of larger rna molecules should be very rugged and display signatures of individual structural elements opening ; see also the discussion in @xcite .",

    "[ melting](b ) , a rough order for thermal opening of the structural elements can be discerned : p4 , p5 , p5a , p6a , p7 , alt p3 , p1 , p2.1 , p9 , p8 , p9.1a , p9.2 , p9.1 , p6b , p5b , p2 , p5c .",
    "no structural element in this thermal ( un)folding pathway is more than four list positions away from its place in the mechanical ( un)folding pathway discussed above .",
    "this suggests that the thermal and mechanical unfolding pathways , although different in detail , can still be used as reasonable priors for each other .",
    "single - molecule experiments are particularly useful when the molecule under study can take on several conformations , e.g. folding intermediates , because in these cases bulk measurements usually yield only average properties , while single - molecule measurements can characterize each of the different conformations . here , we predicted experimental signatures of such folding intermediates in the quasi - equilibrium fluctuations of the end - to - end distance .",
    "we found that a local minimum in the fluctuations curve indicates a locally stable intermediate state in the average mechanical unfolding pathway ( which is well - defined and identical to the ( re)folding pathway ) .",
    "the number of local minima in the fluctuations curve can therefore serve as a lower estimate of the number of locally stable intermediate states in this pathway .",
    "furthermore , these signatures could be used to reconstruct the ( un)folding pathway of an rna molecule with a known secondary structure by cutting the sequence at appropriate positions and individually probing different substructures of the molecule .",
    "we also showed that the stiffness of the force - measuring device plays a crucial role in determining the resolution of the quasi - equilibrium fluctuations curve .",
    "if the device is too soft , some local minima can be lost , while a too rigid device has a low fluctuation amplitude and therefore a low signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the optimal choice for the stiffness ( see ` results ' ) leads to the best estimate for the number of locally stable intermediate states along the pathway and increases the degree to which the pathway could be reconstructed with the `` cutting approach '' .",
    "the dependence on the stiffness has a simple intuitive explanation within the statistical mechanics problem of a particle with an attached spring in a one - dimensional energy landscape ( see fig .",
    "[ stickslip ] ) : a stiff force - measuring device corresponds to a rigid spring , which tends to localize the particle in valleys of the landscape ( i.e. , locally stable intermediates ) and forces it to make small jumps as it is pulled along the landscape . on the other hand , a soft spring allows the particle to spread out and make long jumps , effectively hiding the intermediates in the equilibrium curve .",
    "we hope that this view , which also explains the smoothness of quasi - equilibrium fec s for large rna s @xcite , will be useful for the design and interpretation of future experiments .",
    "of course , experiments typically record not only the average fluctuations , but the detailed time - traces of the end - to - end distance @xcite .",
    "these traces probe the kinetics of structural rearrangements in rna , and could provide even more detailed resolution of intermediate states ( if the kinetics is slow enough to be resolvable in the experiment ) .",
    "however , we expect that it is still helpful to make the choice for the stiffness of the force - measuring device as discussed above , in order to limit the number of states that contribute to each of the timetraces .",
    "although single - molecule experiments on rna have already produced remarkable results , there are many desirable future developments . for instance",
    ", it appears that the current approaches are not well - suited to measure the secondary structure of an unknown molecule ( e.g. , in the cutting approach one would not know where to cut and it would be too laborious to try all positions ) . is there a direct way to mechanically measure the secondary structure ? also , could one detect signatures of pseudoknots or even tertiary interactions ?",
    "we hope that theoretical models of the type presented here can be useful for the planning and design of new experimental approaches in the future",

    "<S> * ) . </S>",
    "<S> recently , single - molecule experiments using optical tweezers were also performed to study the unfolding of small rna molecules under an applied force @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> rna molecules , besides functioning as messengers of sequence information in the process of protein synthesis , also have many biological functions that intricately depend on a precisely folded rna structure , e.g. , as ribosomal rna or as self - splicing introns @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the formation of rna structure ( ` rna folding ' ) is therefore an important biophysical process , which however is currently not understood in sufficient detail @xcite . pulling experiments @xcite , possibly in combination with single - molecule fluorescence methods </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , promise to reveal important aspects of rna structure , its folding pathways and kinetics , and eventually its biological function .    </S>",
    "<S> the experiment of @xcite has shown that pulling on simple structural units of rna , e.g. , a single hairpin , yields characteristic features in the force - extension curve ( fec ) , which can be used to deduce the unfolding free energy and the size of the structural element . moreover </S>",
    "<S> , the observation of end - to - end distance time - traces at constant force revealed that the unfolding and refolding of these simple structures proceeds directly without intermediates , and the opening / closing rates could be extracted from the time - traces . from the theoretical side , </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to ask how far , in principle , the pulling approach could be pushed to study larger rna molecules and how the resolution of such approaches depends on parameters of the experimental setup . here , we expand our previous model for rna pulling experiments @xcite , and address these questions . </S>",
    "<S> the model incorporates the experimentally known free energy rules for rna secondary structure @xcite and a polymer model for the elastic properties of single - stranded rna ( ssrna ) , but neglects pseudoknots and tertiary interactions , the energetics of which are currently poorly characterized .    </S>",
    "<S> our model yields predictions for force - extension measurements , including fluctuations , and the mechanical ( un)folding pathway for any given rna sequence . </S>",
    "<S> below , we begin with the p5ab hairpin used by @xcite and demonstrate that our model yields a fec which is in semi - quantitative agreement with the experimental curve . </S>",
    "<S> this agreement gives us confidence that our model is sufficiently realistic to permit its use to explore general questions regarding sequence - dependent signatures in mechanical single - molecule experiments on rna .    </S>",
    "<S> we first address the question of intermediates in the unfolding pathway and show that , according to our model , a small modification in the sequence of the p5ab hairpin can change its two - state folding behavior and introduce a locally dominant intermediate . </S>",
    "<S> however , whether this intermediate state can be observed through quasi - equilibrium fluctuation measurements critically depends on the experimental conditions : if the force - measuring device is a `` soft spring '' , the hairpin unfolds without any visible intermediates . only when the force is measured with a stiff spring , an intermediate state can be observed .    </S>",
    "<S> we then consider a larger rna molecule , the group  i intron of _ tetrahymena thermophila _ with a sequence of about 400 bases and a known secondary structure containing many individual elements @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> previous theoretical work predicted that equilibrium fec s of large rna s are smooth and display no secondary structure dependent features , due to a compensation effect between individual structural elements @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here , we find that even in the absence of structure - based features in the fec , measurements of the equilibrium fluctuations of the entire molecule can still be useful to obtain information on the ( un)folding pathway . also , for this longer molecule a good choice of the stiffness of the force - measuring device is important for the determination of the pathway .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we compare the mechanical unfolding process studied here with the more conventional thermal unfolding . again using the group i intron as an example </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the individual structural elements display significantly sharper opening transitions for force - induced than for thermal denaturation within our model . indeed , in uv absorption experiments @xcite , thermal melting of the intron shows only one broad signature associated with the opening of the secondary structure . </S>"
