    "assume now , there is no edge flipped by @xmath596 .",
    "since @xmath67 is a  contractible finite cw complex ( the topology is generated by fixing homeomorphisms between edges of @xmath67 and a  standard unit interval ) it follows from @xcite that @xmath596 must have  a fixed point .",

    "let @xmath240 be any vertex of @xmath67 adjacent to @xmath107 , and let @xmath609 .",
