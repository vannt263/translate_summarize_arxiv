    "in antiproton - proton annihilation described by quark - line diagrams , within the context of the constituent quark model , the common wisdom is that planar diagrams @xmath1 and non - planar @xmath2 diagrams do not contribute equally in a given reaction , say @xmath7 or @xmath8 . as depicted in fig .",
    "[ diagrams ] , both the @xmath2 and @xmath1 diagram can lead to the same final non - strange two - body configuration despite the different flavor - flux topology .",
    "since the initial @xmath9 pair contains no strangeness , the annihilation @xmath10 can proceed _ directly _ only via the @xmath1 diagram . indirectly , taking into account final - state interactions , the two - pion final state can couple to the @xmath11 state _ via _ the @xmath2 topology .",
    "some authors @xcite favor the @xmath2 topology due to the following observation : for @xmath1 one gets the same branching ratio ( assuming su(3 ) symmetry is unbroken ) for @xmath8 and @xmath12 . the experimentally observed ratio @xmath13 is small and favors the @xmath2 topology which produces only @xmath14 but not @xmath15 ( where the authors ignore final - state interactions ) .",
    "it is therefore concluded that among the two graphs @xmath2 is the dominant one .",
    "however , in the review of nucleon - antinucleon annihilation by dover _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , it is noted that this argument ignores a strong mechanism of su(3 ) breaking , namely the suppression of @xmath16 pairs @xcite .",
    "it seems thus incorrect to attribute the suppression of strange modes @xmath11 , @xmath15  _ etc . _ to the dominance of the @xmath2 over the @xmath1 topology .",
    "moreover , the authors of the review @xcite reverse the argument and reason in terms of selection rules to establish instead the preponderance of @xmath1 over @xmath2 diagrams in @xmath9 annihilation into two mesons .",
    "pro_-@xmath1 argument follows from a supposedly restrictive set of selection rules for the @xmath2 diagrams , which does not allow for the experimentally observed annihilation of a @xmath9 pair into two pions ( and similar restrictions also hold for the annihilation into two different mesons ) with certain total angular momentum @xmath17 . in more detail , if we concentrate on @xmath18 final states , the @xmath2 annihilation diagram with the specific rules of ref .",
    "@xcite permits only @xmath19-waves ( @xmath20 ) when the @xmath21 pair annihilates into a vacuum @xmath22 state , whereas @xmath21 annihilation into a @xmath23 state with gluon quantum numbers restricts @xmath24 to @xmath19- and @xmath25-waves .",
    "no final state with @xmath26 or higher is allowed in either case .",
    "the planar @xmath1 diagram , on the other hand , does not exhibit this restriction on the orbital angular momentum @xmath24 .",
    "one argument speaks against these restrictions  the specific rules applied by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite stem from the absence of momentum transfer from the annihilated @xmath21 vertex to any of the remaining quarks or antiquarks in fig .",
    "[ diagrams ] , which we claim is not realistic .",
    "if , on the other hand , momentum transfer is allowed in the non - planar @xmath2 diagram @xcite , the selection rules are modified and result into @xmath2 transition operators    @xmath27\\times \\nonumber \\\\   & & \\times \\ ; \\exp \\{a\\mathbf{r'}^2+b\\mathbf{r}^2+d \\mathbf{r}^2\\cos^2\\theta \\ } . \\label{tot1 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for @xmath28 annihilation into a @xmath22 state .",
    "the @xmath23 transition operator is split into a _ longitudinal _",
    "component @xmath29\\times \\nonumber \\\\   & & \\times \\ ; \\exp \\{a\\mathbf{r'}^2+b\\mathbf{r}^2+d \\mathbf{r}^2\\cos^2\\theta \\ }   \\label{tot2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and a _ transversal _ component @xmath30\\times \\nonumber \\\\   & & \\times \\ , \\exp \\{a\\mathbf{r'}^2+b\\mathbf{r}^2+d \\mathbf{r}^2\\cos^2\\theta \\}. \\label{tot3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the relative meson and antiproton - proton coordinates in the c.m . system , respectively . the c.m .",
    "angle @xmath33 is between the relative meson vector @xmath34 and antiproton - proton vector @xmath35 , @xmath36 are the usual pauli matrices and @xmath37 is an overall normalization .",
    "the coefficients @xmath38 with @xmath39 and @xmath40 and @xmath41 depend on size parameters @xmath42 ( proton ) , @xmath43 ( pion ) and the boost factor @xmath44 .",
    "they are detailed in ref .",
    "note that for @xmath45 the coefficients correspond to those in refs .",
    "@xcite . as was already discussed in ref",
    ".  @xcite and its relativistic extension in ref .",
    "@xcite , sandwiching the transition operators between the two - pion and the @xmath46 wave functions , and taking into account the parity properties of the particles , shows that @xmath47 and @xmath48 act in @xmath24 even waves whereas @xmath49 contributes only to @xmath24 odd waves .",
    "hence , one obtains @xmath50 annihilation for @xmath51 , that is in @xmath52 , ... waves , provided both the @xmath22 and @xmath23 mechanisms are taken into account .",
    "a similar analysis of the @xmath1 diagrams yields exactly the same selections rules .",
    "the conclusion is that selection rules do not discriminate between the two topologies , @xmath2 and @xmath1 , which both describe the annihilation .",
    "so , within a constituent quark model in a non - perturbative regime , it is a more consistent approach to consider all annihilation amplitudes equally as they represent different aspects of qcd .",
    "we mention another approach that sheds some light on the question of dominance of either @xmath2 or @xmath1 topology , namely the treatment of @xmath9 annihilation in the large-@xmath3 limit of qcd .",
    "this has already been done previously  @xcite and in the following we summarize some salient results that underpin our conclusion in section  [ sec1 ] .",
    "again , one wants to test , if not quantitatively then at least qualitatively , whether a particular annihilation process is dominant in any reaction @xmath54 .    in his seminal paper @xcite",
    ", t hooft suggested that one can generalize qcd from three colors and an su(3 ) gauge group to @xmath3 colors and an su@xmath55 gauge group .",
    "it was shown that qcd simplifies in the limit of large @xmath3 and @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) fixed and that there exists a systematic expansion in powers of @xmath58 .",
    "one crucial property of this limit is that at @xmath59 the meson and glue states are free , stable and non - interacting .",
    "other important consequences are that mesons become _ pure _ @xmath28 states , since the sea quarks and antiquarks vanish for large @xmath3 .",
    "moreover , zweig s rule is exact in this limit .",
    "these results are restricted to color - singlet glue states ( glue balls ) and mesons , where a clear distinction between planar and non - planar diagrams is possible .",
    "this follows from the euler index for each feynman diagram which determines the @xmath58-counting .",
    "the extension to baryons was carried out by witten , who treated the nucleon - nucleon interaction in large-@xmath3 qcd @xcite .",
    "the main result that emerged from his qualitative analysis is the @xmath3-order of elastic baryon - baryon and baryon - meson scattering amplitudes .",
    "the former is of order @xmath3 and the latter of order @xmath60 . since it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that all energy contributions to the baryon mass @xmath61 are of order @xmath3 , the ( non - relativistic ) kinetic energy @xmath62 is of equal order @xmath3 as the baryon - baryon interaction energy .",
    "hence , the scattering cross section for baryon - baryon scattering does not vanish in the large @xmath3 limit . on the other hand , the baryon - meson scattering amplitude , being of order @xmath60 according to ref .",
    "@xcite , is negligible compared with the baryon mass and to leading order in @xmath58 the baryon propagates unperturbed by mesons .",
    "the meson mass is of order @xmath60 ; it follows that its kinetic energy is of the same order as the baryon - meson interaction energy , which is therefore large enough to influence the motion of the meson . for the dynamics of baryon - meson systems",
    ", this means the meson is scattered off the baryon but the baryon itself remains  free \" for @xmath63 .",
    "the aim of this section is to verify whether the above results can be applied to antinucleon - nucleon annihilation into two mesons . to begin with",
    ", it should be pointed out that for baryons the topological denominations _",
    "planar _ and _ non - planar _ are a misnomer in the large @xmath3 context , as there exists no euler index according to which the diagrams could be ordered .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ diagrams ] that it is awkward to generalize @xmath46 annihilation into two mesons for @xmath3 quarks and @xmath3 antiquarks , for the simple reason that mesons remain @xmath28 states for large @xmath3 . nevertheless , assume a naive picture in which one first chooses out of the @xmath3 quarks and @xmath3 antiquarks _ one _ quark and _ one _ antiquark which do not end up in the same meson .",
    "this gives a factor of @xmath64 and the color content of each of the two final mesons is fixed .",
    "next , a quark is rearranged with an antiquark and the two - meson final state is then formed with the first quark and antiquark choice as in fig .  [ diagrams ] .",
    "there is no additional color factor @xmath3 arising from this as the color - neutrality of the mesons demands a unique choice in the rearrangement .",
    "a gluon exchange between the rearranged quark and antiquark does not alter the @xmath3 counting at this stage ( remember the colors in the two mesons were previously fixed ) , however it introduces an @xmath58 factor from the gluon couplings , where each vertex carries a factor @xmath65 .",
    "one can now proceed to annihilate _ all _ the remaining @xmath28 pairs . in principle , the @xmath28 pairs need not form a color singlet since a gluon from the annihilation vertex can be exchanged with any other still remaining ( anti)quark .",
    "therefore , each annihilation comes along with a factor @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the number of quarks that have been annihilated , but each also involves a factor @xmath58 from the gluon vertices . in our case",
    ", we start with @xmath68 as two of the quarks ( and antiquarks ) are not annihilated and therefore end up in the final two mesons .",
    "an equivalent derivation is to think of the @xmath66 quarks and @xmath66 antiquarks annihilated into vacuum states , each of which can be treated as a @xmath28 state . since any permutation of pairing a quark with an antiquark is possible , this gives a factor @xmath69 using this result and the factor @xmath64 derived in the previous paragraph , one obtains an @xmath3-order for @xmath9 annihilation into @xmath70 mesons : @xmath71 .",
    "it follows from this that for @xmath68 , the @xmath2 diagram generalization to @xmath3 colors is of order @xmath72 where for large @xmath3 one approximates @xmath73 . in the second step of eq .",
    "( [ order ] ) , stirling s approximation @xmath74 has been employed .",
    "repeating this procedure for the @xmath3 generalization of the @xmath1 diagram , one finds it is suppressed by a factor @xmath75 with respect to the above discussed @xmath2 case .",
    "the origin of this lies in the lack of quark - antiquark rearrangement , which contributes a non - vanishing @xmath3-factor without cancelling effect from the gluon vertices .",
    "instead , here a @xmath28 pair has to be created from a gluon .",
    "one eventually arrives at an expression for the @xmath58-order very similar to eq .",
    "( [ order ] ) except that the first factor is @xmath3 rather than @xmath64 , the denominator in eq .",
    "( [ order ] ) becomes @xmath76 since there is an additional factor due to the gluon coupling to the created @xmath28 pair , and for the same reason the last factor is @xmath77 instead of @xmath78 given the effect of the dominating pairwise @xmath28 annihilations in both types of diagrams , it can be concluded that either way the annihilation into two mesons is exponentially damped , which can also be deduced from the quark model calculations in ref .",
    "we shall return to this shortly .",
    "we allow ourselves a short digression at this point  in the cross - channel reaction @xmath79 one also encounters a variety of processes contributing in the large @xmath3 limit to the scattering amplitude .",
    "an example of such scattering is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , where a nucleon - quark is annihilated with an antiquark of the initial meson .",
    "a @xmath28 pair is produced in the final state and since color is transferred between the annihilation and the creation vertex , one gets a factor @xmath3 from choosing a quark in the nucleon as well as a factor @xmath58 from the gluon couplings . the initial meson - quark is still contained in the final meson and acts as a spectator .",
    "the scattering is therefore of order @xmath60 .",
    "if instead of annihilation of a @xmath28 pair we resort to quark - rearrangement , that is a quark of the nucleon ends up in the final meson while the quark of the initial meson replaces this missing quark in the nucleon , we find the scattering amplitude to be of the same order @xmath60 , as discussed in ref .",
    "this , in turn , differs from the @xmath4 annihilation , where rearrangement was shown to yield an additional factor @xmath3 in the previous section .",
    "coming back to @xmath46 annihilation in the large @xmath3 limit , we recapitulate the results derived by pirner  @xcite . in this approach , overlap integrals of meson and @xmath46 wave functions generalized to @xmath3 quarks and @xmath3 antiquarks are worked out .",
    "including appropriately normalized color wave functions introduces a @xmath3 dependence from the color matrix elements .",
    "furthermore , in order to obtain the annihilation cross section , one needs to calculate the @xmath3 dependent phase - space integral .",
    "with all these ingredients the cross section for @xmath46 annihilation into @xmath66 mesons and quark - antiquark rearrangement behaves in the large @xmath3 limit as @xmath80 n_c \\ }   ( \\eta n_c)^{2k } \\label{expdamp1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath81 is the mass , @xmath82 the size , and @xmath83 the kinetic energy of the mesons ( this holds only for same types of mesons like @xmath84 _ etc_. ) .",
    "the non - perturbative annihilation or creation probability is @xmath85 .",
    "the cross section for @xmath46 annihilation into @xmath86 mesons , where @xmath87 is the number of created quarks , is for large @xmath3 @xmath88 n_c \\ }   ( \\eta n_c)^{2k } \\eta^{2l}\\!. \\label{expdamp2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] obviously , eqs .",
    "( [ expdamp1 ] ) and ( [ expdamp2 ] ) just differ by a factor @xmath89 . as @xmath90 ,",
    "the pure annihilation diagram without rearrangement is slightly more damped depending on the number @xmath87 of created quarks .",
    "this is in accordance with the remarks made above about the combinatorial factors in large @xmath3 generalizations of @xmath2 and @xmath1 diagrams . in the  real world \" , where @xmath91 , one can at the most annihilate @xmath92 quarks ( thus violating zweig s rule ) and create @xmath87 mesons .",
    "the more mesons are produced in the final state , the more the rearrangement diagrams should dominate however slight this difference is .",
    "the conclusions that can be drawn from the preceding two sections are coherent . whether using a quark model calculation or a qualitative analysis of the annihilation in the large @xmath3 limit of qcd , there is no evidence for dominance of either diagram , be it of the annihilation ( @xmath1 ) or rearrangement ( @xmath2 ) type .",
    "it should be mentioned that similar findings were reported in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , where it was noted that the @xmath2 diagrams suffice ( although both annihilation mechanisms @xmath22 and @xmath23 are needed ) to reproduce the lear data on @xmath93 differential cross sections and analyzing powers @xcite .",
    "this contradicts the statements of dover _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , who based their reasoning on su(3 ) symmetry breaking and selection rules .",
    "moreover , the present discussion can be generalized to annihilation of any two baryons or hyperons into two or more mesons .",
