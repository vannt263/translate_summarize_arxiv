    "due to the remarkable progress in the understanding of many features of mesoscopic physics the role of electron - electron interactions has been actively studied in such systems .",
    "two frequently studied problems are the interaction induced delocalization of two particles in disordered systems ( we shall use the abbrevation tip as it is common in the literature for two interacting particles)@xcite and the persistent current ( pc ) first predicted by bttiker et al .",
    "@xcite and observed in metallic rings by levy et al .",
    "@xcite and chandrasekhar et al .",
    "commonly used numerical approaches to these problems are the green s function ( gf ) method@xcite , the diagonalization method@xcite , the decimation method@xcite and density - matrix renormalization - group ( dmrg ) method@xcite .",
    "the many - body systems including impurities are frequently modeled by the anderson - hubbard tight - binding hamiltonian @xcite given by interacting electrons ( with on - site interaction ) , and random potentials ( with random site energy ) of the impurities on a lattice . in the tip problem the gf of the full hamiltonian is obtained from dyson s equation considering the interaction hamiltonian as a perturbation .",
    "the two - particle localization length is then defined via a particular trace of the gf . in the pc problem",
    "the interplay between the interactions and impurities has generated much interest and several theoretical methods are developed ( see e.g.  ref.@xcite and references therein ) . to find the persistent current one needs to calculate the flux dependence of the ground state energy which can be obtained from the lowest pole of the gf as a possible approach .",
    "it is therefore desirable to construct the gf of the system which includes both impurities and the electron - electron interaction in order to treat the tip and pc problems in a common framework .    in this paper",
    "we develop a formalism to determine the gf of n - particle systems in which both the potential of the impurities and the interaction between the particles are given by contact potentials , i.e.  by dirac delta functions .",
    "unlike in the case of the anderson tight - binding hamiltonian , in our calculation the positions of the electrons are not restricted to lattice sites but can be continuous coordinates . in our general formalism both the impurities and the interactions are treated as perturbations where the interaction or impurity strengths are the small parameters , and the gf is obtained from dyson s equation .",
    "the resulting series for the gf can be expressed in terms of the gfs of the noninteracting many particle systems without impurities .",
    "if both the impurities and the interaction are given by contact potentials , the series can be given in a closed form , namely as the ratio of two determinants including only the gf of the unperturbed system .",
    "a similar ( i.e.  ratio of two determinants ) form of the gf was found by grosche@xcite for a system containing only _",
    "one _ electron interacting with impurities .",
    "we have used this form of the gf in ref .",
    "@xcite to investigate the diffraction of the electron by the impurities , and in ref .",
    "@xcite to study the crossover behavior of the localization problem in a waveguide with periodically placed identical point - like impurities . in this paper",
    "an extension of grosche s approach to treat many - body interacting systems including impurities is presented . in our formalism",
    "we consider both the spinless bosons and the spin - full fermions .",
    "the many - body wave functions are the symmetrized products of the one - particle eigenstates of the system . in our calculations",
    "the bosonic / fermionic feature of the many - body system is fully incorporated .",
    "the energy eigenvalues of many - body systems are given by the poles of the gf .",
    "it implies that the energy levels are the zeros of the determinant in the denominator of the gf .",
    "we claim that the energy levels determined through this spectral determinant are much more accurate than those found by the traditional diagonalization methods .",
    "therefore , here we propose the method of spectral determinants ( sd ) as a new approach to this problem . as it is seen below",
    "the indices of the matrix elements of the determinants are continuous variables . to evaluate the necessary sd in this case",
    ", one can use any complete orthogonal set as a basis . in our examples below this will be demonstrated using one - particle eigenstates .    as an application and to test our method , we consider the one - dimensional n - body problem in which the bosonic particles interact via a dirac delta potential .",
    "it is well known that the exact result for the energy eigenvalues can be obtained from the bethe ansatz @xcite , so it is possible to compare our results with the exact ones .",
    "it is analytically proved that for the case of two interacting bosons the energy eigenvalues obtained from our method are _ identical _ to those found from the bethe ansatz solutions . moreover , in the case of three and four particles our numerical results agree very well with the bethe ansatz solutions .",
    "our results are compared with those obtained from direct diagonalization of the hamiltonian , and it is demonstrated that in general our results are more than ten times more accurate .",
    "for higher energies it is shown that the direct diagonalization method is very inaccurate , which seriously limitates its applicability in numerical calculations .    to see how much more effective our method is",
    ", we shall consider two nontrivial examples as a further application .",
    "we present our results for the system of two interacting bosons and one impurity , and for three interacting spin - full fermions and one impurity . in these cases",
    "no bethe ansatz type of solution is known .",
    "increasing the number of one - particle wave functions the energy eigenvalues converge . this way",
    "all the energy levels are calculated to four significant figures , and are taken as the exact energy levels .",
    "the errors of the energy eigenvalues found from our sd method and from the direct diagonalization of the hamiltonian are compared using the same number of one - particle wave functions . in general",
    ", our method gives again an order of magnitude more accurate results than the diagonalization of the hamiltonian .",
    "the accurate energy levels are necessary for calculating e.g.  the persistent current which is the derivative of the ground state energy with respect to the applied magnetic flux enclosed by the system . as a demonstration we present our calculation of the persistent current for the interacting three - particle fermion system .",
    "since in the above mentioned tip and pc problems the anderson - hubbard tight - binding hamiltonian@xcite can be regarded as a discretized version of the continuous model with dirac delta potentials for both the interaction among the particles and with the impurities , we expect that our sd method might be applied successfully in numerical simulations .",
    "the work along this line is in progress .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ int+impuri ]",
    "we give our most general form of the gf for interacting n - particles systems including a finite number of impurities . in section [ spin - fermion ]",
    "the gf is given for spin - full case .",
    "in all these sections our results for the gf are given as the ratio of two determinants expressed in terms of the gf of the noninteracting n - particle system . in section [ test ] our method is tested for interacting bosons for which the exact bethe ansatz solutions are known .",

    "we show that from our method the exact bethe ansatz solution can be obtained analytically for two interacting bosons .",
    "in this section we consider the most general case , namely the system of @xmath0 interacting spinless bosons plus @xmath3 impurities with different strengths of potentials . to highlight the method to be applied",
    "it is useful to discuss the simple system of two noninteracting bosons with one impurity .",
