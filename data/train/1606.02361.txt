    "the initial spate of results from lhc run 1 at @xmath108 tev and run 2 with @xmath11 tev have been delivered and have caused a paradigm shift in expected phenomenology of supersymmetric ( susy ) models . in pre - lhc years , a rather light spectrum of sparticle masses was generally expected on the basis of naturalness : that weak - scale susy should not lie too far beyond the weak scale as typified by the @xmath12 ( and ultimately @xmath13 ) masses , where @xmath14 gev .",
    "these expectations were backed up by calculations of upper bounds on sparticle masses using the barbieri ",
    "giudice measure @xcite _",
    "bg_i  , where @xmath15 is the @xmath16-boson mass and the @xmath17 label fundamental parameters of the theory , usually taken to be the unified soft susy breaking terms and the superpotential @xmath0 parameter .",
    "the upper bounds turned out to be typically in the range of a few hundred gev : for instance , in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was found that @xmath18 gev for @xmath19 .",
    "naive hopes for a rapid discovery of susy at lhc were dashed by the reality of data wherein lately the atlas and cms collaborations have produced bounds on the gluino mass of @xmath20  tev in simplified models assuming @xmath21 decays @xcite .",
    "the effect of direct sparticle mass limits was compounded by the rather high value of the higgs - boson mass @xmath22  gev @xcite which was discovered .",
    "such a high higgs mass required top squarks in the @xmath23100  tev range for small stop mixing and in the few tev range for large stop mixing . while heavy stops were allowed by the @xmath24 measure in the focus - point region @xcite ,",
    "they were seemingly dis - allowed by large logarithmic contributions to @xmath25 as quantified by the high - scale large - log measure @xmath26 @xcite which seemed to require _ three _ third generation squarks with mass @xmath27  gev @xcite .",
    "thus , the lhc data cast a pall on overall expectations for susy and indeed led to doubts as to whether weak scale susy did actually provide nature s solution to the gauge hierarchy problem .",
    "in addition , lack of new physics at lhc cast doubt on the motivation for new accelerators such as the international linear @xmath28 collider ( ilc ) which would operate at @xmath291  tev@xcite : would there be any prospect for detection of new particles , or would the role of such a machine be mainly to tabulate assorted precision measurements as a higgs factory ?",
    "prospects for ilc detection of any susy particles @xcite seemed dim , much less embarking on a program of precision susy particle measurements to determine underlying high scale lagrangian parameters @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach was to scrutinize the validity of the theoretical naturalness calculations .",
    "the most conservative approach to naturalness arises from the weak scale link between the measured value of @xmath15 and the fundamental susy lagrangian parameters @xcite .",
    "minimization of the scalar potential in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) leads to the well - known relation @xcite & = & -^2[eq : mzs1 ] + & & -m_h_u^2-_u^u-^2 [ eq : mzs ] where @xmath30 and @xmath31 denote the 1-loop corrections ( expressions can be found in the appendix of ref .",
    "@xcite ) to the scalar potential , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the higgs soft masses at the weak scale , and @xmath34 is the ratio of the higgs vevs .",
    "the second line obtains for moderate to large values of @xmath35 ( as required by the higgs mass calculation@xcite ) .",
    "susy models requiring large cancellations between the various terms on the right - hand - side of eq .   to reproduce the measured value of @xmath36",
    "are regarded as unnatural , or fine - tuned .",
    "in contrast , susy models which generate terms on the rhs of eq .   which are all less than or comparable to @xmath37 are regarded as natural .",
    "thus , the _ electroweak _ naturalness measure @xmath38 is defined as @xcite    radiative corrections , over 40 terms contribute . neglecting radiative corrections , and taking moderate - to - large @xmath39 , then @xmath40",
    "so the main criterion for naturalness is that _ at the weak scale _",
    "@xmath41 and    @xmath42 @xcite . the value of @xmath33 ( where @xmath43 with @xmath44 being the mass of the cp - odd higgs boson ) can lie in the tev range since its contribution to the rhs of eq .",
    "is suppressed by @xmath45 .",
    "the largest radiative corrections typically come from the top squark sector .",
    "requiring highly mixed tev - scale top squarks minimizes @xmath46 whilst lifting the higgs mass @xmath25 to @xmath47  gev @xcite .",
    "this framework is called the radiatively - driven natural susy ( rns ) @xcite scenario .    using @xmath48 or better than 3% fine - tuning , high fine - tuning sets in and",
    "is displayed visually in fig .  2 of ref .",
    "] then instead of earlier upper bounds , it is found that    @xmath494  tev ,    @xmath50 tev and    @xmath51 gev .",
    "thus , gluinos and squarks may easily lie beyond the current reach of lhc at little cost to naturalness while only the higgsino - like lighter charginos and neutralinos are required to lie near the weak scale .",
    "the lightest higgsino @xmath52 comprises a portion of the dark matter and would escape detection at lhc .",
    "owing to their compressed spectrum with mass gaps @xmath5320  gev , the heavier higgsinos are difficult to see at lhc owing to the rather small visible energy released from their three body decays @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( where the @xmath56 stands for sm fermions ) . at the ilc , on the other hand , direct searches for higgsino - like neutralinos and charginos are more promising since the ilc background is much simpler .",
    "we will briefly review ilc direct searches for neutralinos and charginos in sec .",
    "[ sec : ilc ] .",
    "the apparent conflict between @xmath57 and @xmath24 was resolved when it was pointed out that @xmath24 was typically applied to low energy effective susy theories wherein the soft terms were introduced as independent parameters to parametrize the unknown dynamics of hidden sector susy breaking . if instead the soft terms are all calculable _ e.g. _ as multiples of the gravitino mass @xmath58 as in gravity - mediation , then positive and negative high scale contributions to @xmath36 cancel and the measure reduces to @xmath59 @xcite . likewise ,",
    "if one combines all dependent contributions in the large log measure @xmath60 then cancellations between @xmath61 and @xmath62 are possible so that @xmath63 : in this case the large negative correction @xmath62 is used to drive the large gut - scale soft term @xmath32 to a natural value at the weak scale .    a grand overview plot of the natural susy parameter space is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : plane ] where we show contours of @xmath64 , 125 and 127 gev ( red , green and blue contours ) in the @xmath65 vs. @xmath66 plane for @xmath67 gev , @xmath68 tev , @xmath69 and @xmath70 tev .",
    "we also show contours of electroweak naturalness @xmath71 , 100 and 400 ( black , orange and brown contours ) . while it is possible to be highly natural for small @xmath66 and small @xmath65 ( as expected in pre - lhc days ) , this region generates a rather light higgs mass of typically @xmath72120  gev .",
    "however , it is also possible to be highly natural if one moves to multi - tev values of @xmath66 and @xmath65 just above the gray excluded region ( where ccb = charge or color breaking minima occur ) .",
    "in fact , in this large @xmath66 and @xmath65 region , we also see that the higgs mass moves up to allowed values @xmath73  gev .",
    "the intersection of these regions  highly natural with @xmath74  gev  requires multi - tev values of @xmath66 and @xmath65 .",
    "in fact , in a recent paper @xcite , it was suggested that in models with @xmath75 , the string landscape statistically favors as large as possible values of soft terms which are at the same time consistent with the anthropic requirement of @xmath76  gev . in this region , the ew symmetry is barely broken leading to @xmath77 .",
    "then very large , multi - tev values of @xmath66 and @xmath65 are to be expected .",
    "since @xmath66 sets the squark and slepton mass scale , we expect if we live in this region then the matter scalars will likely be out of lhc reach .",
    "top squarks are also likely to be beyond both lhc and ilc reach so it will be difficult to ascertain whether the trilinear terms @xmath65 are indeed large .",
    "however , such a large @xmath65 modifies the gaugino masses via two loop terms in the renormalization group evolution . if the ilc measures gaugino masses at the percent level , it is possible to indirectly see the large @xmath65 which is required for natural susy . in this paper",
    ", we advocate precision measurements of the lightest chargino and neutralino masses as a means to test the requirement of multi - tev trilinear soft breaking terms .",
    "while gluino masses may range up to 4  tev for @xmath48 @xcite , the @xmath78 reach of lhc14 for gluino pair production with @xmath79  fb@xmath80 extends only to about 2  tev while the 95% cl exclusion for @xmath81  fb@xmath80 extends to about 2.8  tev .",
    "other signal channels such as same sign diboson production@xcite from @xmath82 or @xmath83 @xcite should extend the lhc reach for natural susy spectrum@xcite",
    ".    meanwhile , construction of the ilc would be highly propitious for natural susy .",
    "if natural susy is correct , then ilc would likely be a _",
    "higgsino factory _ where the reactions @xmath84 and @xmath85 would occur at high rates provided @xmath86 and the semi - compressed decays would be easily visible in the clean environment of @xmath28 collisions .",
    "a detailed phenomenological study of ilc measurements for rns has been presented in ref .",
    "more detailed studies are in progress using realistic detector simulations and more thorough background generation @xcite .",
    "briefly , the reaction @xmath84 followed by one @xmath87 and the other @xmath88 will allow for the @xmath89 mass gap extraction via measurement of the dijet invariant mass .",
    "in addition , measurement of the kinematic lower and upper endpoints of the dijet energy @xmath90 distribution will allow for precision determination of @xmath91 and @xmath92@xcite . typically these endpoint measurements are expected to yield ew - ino masses at the percent level at ilc .",
    "in addition , using the variable beam polarization and the variable beam energy  for instance to do threshold scans  may allow sub - percent precision on these mass values@xcite .",
    "likewise , the reaction @xmath93 followed by @xmath94 will allow the @xmath95 mass gap to be extracted from the @xmath96 upper bound .",
    "the endpoints of the @xmath97 distribution should allow extraction of @xmath98 and @xmath92 to percent or better precision .",
    "while the values of @xmath91 , @xmath98 and @xmath92 are all expected to be @xmath99 , the mass gaps will depend on the bino and wino contamination of the mainly - higgsino eigenstates .",
    "thus , it is expected that the weak scale bino @xmath1 and wino @xmath2 masses can be extracted from precision measurements .",
    "these virtual mass extractions will only be aided if measurements of @xmath100 can be gained by studying deviations in the light higgs @xmath13 decay modes @xcite or if the heavy higgs bosons @xmath101 or @xmath3 are accessible to lhc ( or later @xmath102 tev ilc ) searches .",
