    "until recently , the measurement of these properties had to rely on either narrow - band images ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "relevant emission - lines in the near - ir include [ feii]@xmath91.257@xmath10 m and 1.644@xmath10 m , hi lines such as pa@xmath3 and br@xmath5 and molecular hydrogen lines such as h@xmath111.957@xmath10 m and h@xmath112.121@xmath10 m , which can be used to map the gas kinematics and excitation @xcite .",
    "studies based on the above lines @xcite have revealed a correlation between the [ feii ] and the radio emission , indicating that shock excitation by the radio jets is a likely mechanism for production of the [ feii ] emission in these objects , although other works have favoured photoionization by the nuclear source @xcite .",

    "the total ifu field of 3@xmath179@xmath203@xmath170 thus corresponds to a region of dimensions 360pc@xmath20275pc at the galaxy .",
    "we fitted gaussian profiles to the [ feii]@xmath34 , h@xmath35 , pa@xmath3 and br@xmath5 emission lines in order to obtain the integrated fluxes , radial velocities ( from the peak wavelengths of the lines ) and velocity dispersions ( from the widths of the lines ) .",
    "a @xmath36 m continuum image was obtained from the interpolation of the continuum under the h@xmath35 emission line .    in fig.[flux ] we present the 2d maps of the near - ir continuum flux and emission line intensities in arbitrary units , with mean uncertainties of 5 , 12 , 15 and 17% for h@xmath35 , br@xmath5 , pa@xmath3 and [ feii]@xmath34 , respectively . in the same figure we also present the h@xmath8/br@xmath5 , br@xmath5/pa@xmath3 and [ feii]/pa@xmath3 line ratios .",

    "the uncertainty may be smaller , due to the smaller effect of reddening in the near - ir relative to the optical , but 0@xmath172 corresponds to only one pixel of our data , thus we may consider such small difference as a coincidence when comparing our images with the radio images .",
    "the h@xmath8 intensity could be measured over most of the ifu field , while there was not enough signal to measure the br@xmath5 and pa@xmath3 in a few lines close to the top and bottom edges (  1@xmath175 from the nucleus ) .",
    "the [ feii ] emission - line could only be measured over the inner 1@xmath179 along the minor axis of the ifu field , and thus the corresponding map covers a smaller region than those in the other emission lines .",

    "the overlaid contours of the radio continuum image on the br@xmath5 and [ feii ] emission - line maps show a detailed correspondence between the radio and emission - line structures : the strongest line - emission is observed to the nw , and approximately coincides with the strongest emission in radio ; the emission - line distribution to the se bends to the ne , as also observed in the radio map .",
    "the peak of line emission is nevertheless a bit displaced from the radio emission peak : the line emission peaks at 0@xmath176nw while the radio emission peaks at 0@xmath178nw from the nucleus .",
    "a comparison between the emission - line maps of the hi with that of [ feii ] shows that the latter has the strongest emission displaced to the nw relative to the hi emission , tracing the structure of the radio hot spot which bends to the w.    in the case of the h@xmath8 emission map , although the above bipolar structure is also observed , there is additional emission at the lowest intensity levels extended beyond the bipolar structure .",
    "in order to investigate the main excitation mechanisms of h@xmath8 and [ feii ] , we have constructed the line - ratio maps [ feii]/pa@xmath3 and h@xmath8/br@xmath5 shown in fig.[flux ] .",
    "the uncertainties on these ratios range from 0.2 at the nucleus to 0.7 at the top and bottom borders of the ifu field for the first ratio and from 0.1 to 0.9 for the second .",

    "this behaviour is the same as the one observed in the @xmath24 map of fig.[painel - mapa - de - cor - e428 ] , suggesting that the line emission is subject to the same extinction as the continuum , with the ne more reddened than the sw side , consistent with the ne being the near side of the galaxy . in order to evidence this ,",

    "similarly , in the [ feii ] @xmath63map the highest values avoid also the locations of the radio emission knots .",
    "a comparison between the @xmath63maps of the different lines show that the h@xmath8 velocity dispersion values are lower than those of [ feii ] and hi lines , indicating that the gas emitting the two latter lines is more perturbed than the molecular gas .",
    "the relatively high spectral resolution of the data has allowed us to slice our data cube into a sequence of velocity bins along each emission line profile , providing a better sampling of the gas kinematics , not restricted to the peak wavelength of the emission - line , but including also the wings .",

    "we have overlaid the contours of the radio image on the central panels the br@xmath5 and [ feii ] emission line slices in fig .",
    "[ slices ] .",
    "the velocity distributions are somewhat different for the different emission lines . for hi , as the slices trace gas from negative ( blueshift ) to positive ( redshift ) residual velocities , the peak in the flux distribution moves from nw to se , approximately following the path traced by the radio emission .",
    "the blueshifts observed in hi , reach @xmath1300kms@xmath6 , approximately at the location of the radio hot spot , between 0@xmath176 and 0@xmath178nw of the nucleus .",
    "some blueshifts are also observed to the se following the radio structure which bends upwards ( see fig . [ slices ] ) .",
    "redshifts are mostly observed at the nucleus , where they reach @xmath1200kms@xmath6 and to the se where they reach smaller values of @xmath1100kms@xmath6 at 12@xmath19se .",
    "the redshifted emission to the se also traces the radio structure .",
    "thus , to the se , we observe both blueshifts and redshifts following the radio structure .    for h@xmath8 ,",
    "the behaviour is similar to that observed for hi , only that there is additional emission beyond the radio structure .",
    "the highest blueshifts , of up to @xmath1400kms@xmath6 are observed in the [ feii ] emitting gas , which shows a more bipolar structure in the velocity slices than the other emission lines . throughout this structure ,",
    "we observe mostly blueshifts , even at the nucleus and to se .    in summary",
    ", we could say that the [ feii ] velocity field shows predominantly a bipolar structure , which is also observed in the h@xmath8 and hi for the highest velocity gas . for velocities between -100 and 100 kms@xmath6 , the structure in",
    "hi is best described as linear , with both blueshifts and redshifts observed to either side of the nucleus . in the case of h@xmath8 , in this low velocity range , the emission at low intensity levels is spread over most of the ifu field .",
    "although all the velocity fields show evidence of a rotation pattern , the blueshifted side shows a more abrupt gradient going from the systemic velocity at the center to @xmath64100kms@xmath6 at only 0@xmath176 ( 55pc ) from it towards the nw , while to the se equivalent redshift is barely reached at the border of the ifu field ( 210pc from the nucleus ) . in the top panel of fig.[radial ]",
    "we present one - dimensional cuts of the radial velocity field along the radio jet for the h@xmath8 , br@xmath5 and [ feii ] emission lines , in which we can clearly see this behaviour .    by comparing the line intensity maps ( fig.[flux ] ) with the velocity fields ( fig.[vel ] ) ,",
    "we verify that the peak blueshifts approximately coincide with the peak intensities , suggesting that the flux enhancement is produced by the compression provided by the nw radio jet ( @xcite ) , which should be at least partially oriented toward us in order to account for the observed blueshift .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the correspondence between the line fluxes and velocities ( but along one axis ) can be done using one - dimensional cuts shown in fig.[radial ] , by comparing the top and middle panels . in this comparison",
    "it can be observed that the [ feii ] line flux presents a peak at the location of the strongest blueshift , between 0@xmath176 and 0@xmath178 nw of the nucleus , another smaller peak at the nucleus and another one at 12 se of the nucleus , at a location coincident with a  residual blueshift \"  a decrease in the velocity observed in the redshifted side in the top panel of fig.[radial ] .",
    "the fluxes of the h@xmath8 and br@xmath5 emission lines also show peaks at @xmath10@xmath174nw , thus somewhat closer to the nucleus than the locations of strongest blueshifts and between 1 and 2@xmath19 se of the nucleus , approximately at the locations of the residual blueshift described above , also observed in the h@xmath8 and br@xmath5 emission lines .",
    "similar displacements between the radio and optical emission have been observed by @xcite in their comparison between hst [ oiii]@xmath95007 and [ niis]+h@xmath18 emission - line images and the radio images of eso428-g14 : they found that the emission - line fluxes are enhanced , in the form of knots and filaments in structures shaped as cocoons surrounding the radio jets .",
    "this close association between emission line distributions and radio structures is nevertheless not always observed leading some authors to conclude that there is no connection between the kinematics of the nlr and radio jets @xcite .",

    "middle : emission line fluxes in arbitrary units .",
    "bottom : velocity dispersion values . ]    in the case of eso428-g14 the good correspondence between the radio and emission line structures , also observed in the velocity slices of fig .",
    "[ slices ] indicates that the radio jet has an influence on all the emitting gas , although the somewhat distinct kinematics observed in the different emission lines suggest varying contribution of the radio jet to the line emission .",
    "the [ feii ] line kinematics is dominated by two outflowing structures towards the end of the radio jets ; the hi kinematics has contribution from all emitting regions along the radio jet ; and the h@xmath8 line presents the less bipolarity , more closely resembling a rotation pattern .",
    "we interpret these differences as due to a larger disk rotation component contribution to kinematics of the h@xmath8 line , an increasing contribution of the radio jet perturbations to the kinematics of the hi line emission , and a even larger contribution from the radio jet to the kinematics of the [ feii ] line .",
    "the influence of the radio jet on the emitting gas can also be observed in the velocity dispersion ( @xmath63 ) maps ( fig.[vel ] ) and in the one - dimensional cuts along the radio axis shown in the lower panel of fig.[radial ] .",
    "increase in the @xmath63 values are observed from 0@xmath174se to 0@xmath176nw along the radio axis and between 0@xmath178 and 1@xmath178 to se of the nucleus . at least to the nw , the largest @xmath63 values",
    "are thus observed between the nucleus and the radio hot spot , and do not coincide with the emission line flux and velocity peaks , but is shifted towards the nucleus . to the se , the highest @xmath63 values seem to approximately coincide with the peaks in the line intensity and velocity ( the residual blueshifts relative to the redshifts of the gas to se ) .",
    "we interpret this result as due to the interaction of the radio jet with ambient gas which produces a broadening of the emission lines due the momentum transfered to the gas by the jet .",
    "the different behaviour of the @xmath63 values to the nw and to the se can be understood as due to a shock between the radio jet and a dense ism to the nw which blocks the radio jet and stirs the gas not only at the shock front but also behind the shock , which is observed as a larger velocity dispersion .",
    "the presence of a shock front is evidenced by the the abrupt termination of the radio jet at the hot spot and the enhanced line emission at this location .",
    "the interaction of the radio jet with the ism is milder to the se , where the radio jet stirs the gas but is not blocked penetrating farther into the ism .",
    "it can also be noted that the overall velocity dispersion values are lowest for h@xmath8 ( 30 to 85kms@xmath6 ) , and highest for the [ feii ] ( 50 to 180kms@xmath6 ) , indicating that the [ feii ] traces the most disturbed gas , while h@xmath8 traces the less disturbed gas .",
    "this result is also consistent with those obtained from the velocity fields discussed above , supporting a different origin for the gas emitting the different lines .",
    "distinct kinematics for hi , h@xmath8 and [ feii ] has been observed also in previous near - ir studies of other agns ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) , where the broadest [ feii ] emission has been attributed to gas cloud interactions with the radio jet .",
    "the h@xmath8 lines can be excited in two different ways : fluorescent excitation through absorption of soft - uv photons ( 9121108  ) in the lyman and werner bands @xcite and collisional excitation , namely inelastic collisions between molecules in a warm ( @xmath65 k ) gas .",
    "the heating necessary to allow collisional excitation may be provided by : shocks @xcite , x - rays @xcite or dense photodissociation regions by uv photons .",
    "the method commonly used to differentiate collisional excitation from fluorescence is based on the flux ratios of h@xmath8 lines in the _ k _ band . based on measurements of such ratios for a large sample of galaxies ,",
    "@xcite concluded that fluorescence is not important for agns supporting previous studies by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite , using _ hst _ , imaged a sample of 10 seyfert galaxies in h@xmath8 and detected extended emission in six of them . for three galaxies they found h@xmath8 emission in the extended narrow line region , coincident with [ oiii ] and h@xmath66[nii ] line emission .",
    "for these galaxies they discarded uv excitation as the dominant excitation process on the basis of the h@xmath18 to h@xmath8 ratio , and argued that slow shocks are the most likely process to explain these line ratios .",
    "they compiled spectroscopic observations of molecular hydrogen from @xcite , @xcite and @xcite and looked for correlations with radio 6-cm and hard x - ray flux .",
    "they found no correlation with x - rays , suggesting this is not the dominant h@xmath8 excitation mechanism , and found a weak correlation with radio 6-cm , suggesting that no single mechanism is likely to be responsible for the molecular hydrogen excitation in seyfert galaxies .    in a paper aimed at explaining the strong h@xmath8 emission of ngc6240",
    ", @xcite argued that shock speeds higher than the h@xmath8 @xmath63 values of eso428-g14 ( 50@xmath6780kms@xmath6 ) dissociates the h@xmath8 molecule .",
    "we thus conclude that faster shocks , although present , as indicated by the larger [ feii ] @xmath63 values , destroy the h@xmath8 molecule , and this is why we do not see broader h@xmath8 emission . @xcite propose that most of the h@xmath8 line emission originates in molecular gas with is heated by transient x - ray irradiation .",
    "hard x - rays from the agn have been also proposed by @xcite and @xcite as the dominant excitation mechanism of h@xmath8 emission in cygnusa .",
    "our h@xmath8 flux distribution and kinematics suggest some association with the radio morphology , in particular at the radio hot spot , but there is also additional emission spread throughout the ifu field .",
    "the emission line ratio h@xmath68/br@xmath5 is @xmath10.8 along the radio jet increasing outwards , in the direction perpendicular to the radio jet , to @xmath15 . in starbursts , where the main heating agent is uv radiation , h@xmath68/br@xmath69 , while for agns",
    "this ratio is larger ( 0.6 @xmath70 h@xmath71/br@xmath72 2 ) because of the additional h@xmath8 excited by shocks or by x - rays from the agn @xcite .",
    "the value @xmath10.8 observed for eso428-g14 along the radio jet is thus typical of agns .",
    "the higher h@xmath68/br@xmath5 line ratio values observed outside the jet could be due to some x - rays from the agn still reaching these regions while the uv - photons needed to excite the hi are in much less number producing only very faint br@xmath5 emission .",
    "from the discussion above we conclude that the collisional excitation necessary to produce the h@xmath8 emission may be provided by the interaction of the radio jet with the circumnuclear interstellar medium ( hereafter ism ) or by heating produced by the x - rays emitted by the agn .",
    "the enhanced h@xmath8 @xmath63 values in the hot spot region reveal that the jet is depositing kinetic energy on the gas .",
    "this energy can be estimated as follows .",
    "the instrumental broadening is 21 kms@xmath6 . subtracting this in quadrature",
    ", we obtain a minimum @xmath63 for h@xmath8 of 34 kms@xmath6 ( away from the radio jet ) , and a maximum value at the hot spot region of 77 kms@xmath6 .",
    "( uncertainties in these values are @xmath2210 kms@xmath6 . )",
    "velocities of the order of the latter provide enough kinetic energy to excite the h@xmath8 molecule .",
    "assuming that the h@xmath8 emitting regions with smallest @xmath63 ( blue region in the top right panel of fig .",
    "[ vel ] ) are solely excited by x - rays and that the x - ray contribution is the same as in the jet region , we can estimate the increase in kinetic energy provided by the radio jet as @xmath73 . under the above assumptions",
    ", one could conclude that @xmath7483% ( 5/6 ) of the h@xmath8 excitation is due to shocks at the hot spot regions ( red regions in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ vel ] ) . in the yellow regions",
    "se of the nucleus , and the regions surrounding the radio jet region , the kinetic energy ratio is 2.7 , thus the jet excitation still dominates ( @xmath2273% ) there .",
    "but these are only upper limits because the x - ray flux in the jet region may be larger . in a",
    " photoionization scenario \" by a  clumpy \" torus atmosphere ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the ionization state of the gas would be larger along the collimation axis of the torus and would drop with increasing distance from this axis .",
    "this could explain why the h@xmath8 emission is distributed over a wider area , in gas which is irradiated by an attenuated continuum .",
    "a number of papers have presented reviews and detailed studies of the physical conditions of the [ feii ] emitting gas in starburst and agn galaxies , such as @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . in these studies",
    "it is argued that the [ feii]/br@xmath5 ratio is controlled by the ratio between the volumes of partially to fully ionized gas regions , as [ feii ] emission is excited in partially ionized gas .",
    "such zones in agn are created by power law photoionization ( including x - rays emitted by the agn ) or shock heating .",
    "these two processes are discriminated by the electron temperature of the [ feii ] region : @xmath75 for photoionization and @xmath76 for shocks . a contribution from shocks produced by radio jets",
    "is supported by results such as those of @xcite which have found a correlation between the [ feii ] and 6-cm radio emission in radio galaxies .",
    "nevertheless @xcite have argued that the dominant excitation mechanism of [ feii ] is photoionization with shock excitation accounting for only @xmath1 20% of the [ feii ] emission in agn .",
    "the nature of the excitation mechanism can be investigated using emission line ratios .",
    "@xcite show that [ feii]/pa@xmath3 is smaller than 0.6 for starburst galaxies and higher than 2 for supernova remnants , for which shocks are the main excitation mechanism .",
    "the seyfert galaxies have values in between 0.6 and 2 suggesting that this ratio can be used as a measure of the relative contribution of photoionization and shocks . for eso428-g14 1@xmath380.27@xmath70[feii]/pa@xmath772@xmath380.73 in the region co - spatial with the radio jet , indicating a range of relative contribution of photoionization and shock excitation for the [ feii ] line , with regions where this ratio is @xmath12 been dominated by shocks . in the region corresponding to the radio hot spot this ratio ranges from 1.5 to 2 supporting a large contribution from shocks .    in order to estimate an upper limit on the contribution of the radio jet in the excitation of the [ feii ]",
    ", we use the same reasoning as in the case of h@xmath8 emission above , assuming that the lowest @xmath63 observed for this line ( dark blue regions in the bottom right panel of fig.[vel ] ) is produced by x - ray excitation .",
    "we obtain a ratio between maximum and minimum kinetic energies of @xmath78 , thus 90% of [ feii ] emitted in the hot spot region ( red region in bottom right panel of fig.[vel ] ) is excited by the radio jet under the above assumptions . in other regions of the jet ( yellow - green regions ) where @xmath79 , the percentage of gas emission due to radio jet excitation falls to 80% .",
    "but these are also upper limits because as pointed above for h@xmath8 , the x - ray emission may be stronger along the radio jet , providing a larger contribution for the [ feii ] emission excitation than in the regions with the lowest @xmath63 values .",
    "on the other hand , the stronger association of the [ feii ] flux and kinematics with the radio structure supports a larger contribution of the radio jet to the [ feii ] excitation relative to that of h@xmath8 .",
    "we have analyzed near - ir _ j _ and _ k _ band 2d spectra of the inner @xmath1300pc of the seyfert galaxy eso428-g14 obtained with the gemini gnirs ifu .",
    "the fine angular sampling of this instrument and the high spectral resolution of the observations provided a spatial sampling of 14pc@xmath0 at the galaxy and a velocity resolution of @xmath120kms@xmath6 . these characteristics and 2d coverage",
    "has allowed us to obtain gas flux distributions and ratios as well as to map the gas kinematics in the four strong emission lines [ feii]@xmath2 m , pa@xmath3 , h@xmath80 m and br@xmath5 .",
    "such 2d mapping at the spatial and spectral resolution of our observations and in the near - ir is unique in the literature so far .",
    "we have used the spectroscopic data in conjunction with a [ feii]@xmath2 m narrow - band image and @xmath24 color map obtained with osiris at the ctio blanco telescope .",
    "the [ feii ] narrow - band image shows a bi - polar structure which correlates well with the structure observed in a previous published radio map , as well as with that observed in a narrow - band [ oiii ] hst image .",
    "this bi - polar structure is oriented approximately along the photometric major axis of the galaxy at pa@xmath1129@xmath7 . under the assumption that redder color is due to dust screening , we conclude from the @xmath24 color map that ne is the near side of the galaxy .",
    "the ifu observations show that not only the [ feii ] flux distribution , but also pa@xmath3 and br@xmath5 correlate with the radio emission , all showing elongated morphologies along the radio axis .",
    "the h@xmath8 emission has an additional component more spread over the disk of the host galaxy .",
    "the gas kinematics shows a pattern which , at first sight , seems to be due to rotation in a disk , but which is clearly disturbed by non - circular motions .",
    "the analysis of the gas kinematics is complicated by the fact that the galaxy major axis is approximately aligned with the radio axis .",
    "the radio emission morphology suggests that a radio jet is the cause of outflows observed in velocity  slices \" obtained along the gas emission line profiles : blueshifts of @xmath22 300400kms@xmath6 are observed in emission associated with a radio hot spot at @xmath2208 nw of the nucleus , while mostly redshifts and some blueshifts observed to the opposite side of the nucleus are associated to fainter radio emission observed up to 2@xmath19 se . from this velocity pattern , as well as from the emission - line ratios we conclude that the radio jet leaves the nucleus at a small angle relative to the plane of the galaxy , with the nw side slightly directed toward us and the counter - jet directed away from us , being partially hidden by the disk of the galaxy .",
    "some redshift observed to the nw and some blueshift observed to the se shows that the line emission is observed to both sides of the plane of the galaxy , confirming that the angle between the radio jet and the plane of the galaxy is small and emission associated with the jets occurs on both sides of the galaxy plane .",
    "the reddening distribution obtained from the br@xmath5/pa@xmath3 emission - line ratio coincides with that obtained from the continuum , confirming that the line emission comes from circumnuclear gas located essentially in the galactic plane .",
    "the velocity dispersion maps show the highest values between the nucleus and the regions of strongest radio emission ( the radio hot spots ) .",
    "we interpret this result as due to kinetic energy deposited by ratio jet in the circumnuclear ism , producing a compression in the gas and emission enhancement just beyond this compressed region .",
    "while the [ feii ] emission is dominated by the highest velocities at the two hot spots in opposite sides of the nucleus , the hi emission has an important contribution also from lower velocities , observed all along the radio emission structure .",
    "the h@xmath8 emission has significant emission contribution at low velocities spread throughout the observed region , apparently coming from the disk of the host galaxy .    from the observed kinematics ,",
    "we conclude that the radio jet has a fundamental role in shaping the emission line region as it interacts with the galaxy ism surrounding the galaxy nucleus .",
    "we have used the 2d velocity dispersion maps to estimate the kinetic energy deposited in the circumnuclear ism by the radio jet relative to regions away from the jet . assuming that the h@xmath8 and [ feii ] excitation in the latter regions is dominated by x - rays , and that the x - rays excitation is the same in the jet region",
    ", we obtain contributions by shocks of up to 80 - 90% for the [ feii ] and up to 70 - 80% for h@xmath8 in the jet region .",
    "these are however , upper limits due to the fact that the x - rays contribution along the jet axis may be larger than away from it . the stronger association of the [ feii ] emission and kinematics with the radio structure supports a larger contribution of the radio jet to the excitation of [ feii ] than to that of h@xmath8 .",
