    "the @xmath0 chamaeleontis star cluster is a recently - discovered group of @xmath2 10 myr - old pms stars at a distance of only 97 pc ( mamajek , lawson & feigelson 1999a ) .",
    "the cluster was discovered following a _ rosat _ hri pointing at a compact group of 4 _ rosat _ all - sky survey ( rass ) sources .",
    "the 4 rass sources were recovered along with 8 additional sources .",
    "spectroscopy of the optical counterparts of these sources ( denoted as recx stars by mamajek et al .",
    "1999a ) showed 10 of these stars had the optical characteristics of late - type weak - lined t tauri ( wtt ) stars , as evidenced by optical activity ( h@xmath3 emission with equivalent widths _ ew _",
    "= @xmath4  ) and enhanced @xmath56708 li i absorption ( _ ew _",
    "= @xmath6  ) .",
    "the optical counterparts of the other two x - ray sources were the bright b8 star @xmath0 cha and the a7 + a8 binary rs cha .",
    "the pms nature of the recx stars was confirmed via _",
    "hipparcos _ and tycho astrometry .",
    "_ hipparcos _ parallaxes and proper motions for @xmath0 cha and rs cha gave a weighted parallax for the two stars of @xmath7 mas ( distance @xmath8 pc ) and proper motions ( @xmath9 cos @xmath10 , @xmath11 = @xmath12 , + 28 masyr@xmath13 ) .",
    "half of the late - type recx stars ( recx 1 , 9 , 10 , 11 and 12 ) and the x - ray - quiet a5 star hd 75505 can be related to @xmath0 cha and rs cha via common parallax and/or proper motions ( mamajek et al . 1999a , mamajek , lawson & feigelson 2000 , lawson et al .",
    "preliminary placement of the recx stars on the hr diagram suggested a common age of @xmath2 10 myr ( mamajek et al .",
    "1999a ) .",
    "published work to date on the @xmath0 cha cluster includes announcement of its discovery and analysis of spectroscopy of the recx stars ( mamajek et al . 1999a ) , a search for microwave radio emission from the recx stars ( mamajek , lawson & feigelson 1999b ) , consideration of the kinematic origin of the cluster and detailed analysis of the _ rosat _ x - ray light curves ( mamajek et al . 2000 ; also see mamajek & feigelson , these proceedings ) , and long - term photometric study of the late - type stars for rotation period analysis and accurate hr diagram placement ( lawson et al .",
    "in addition , lawson & feigelson ( 2001 ) compared the cluster hr diagram to several contemporary sets of pms evolutionary tracks , concluding that most models failed to achieve coevality across the observed range of stellar spectral types .    in this paper , some of the more recent work and forthcoming detailed studies of the cluster s stellar population are highlighted .",
    "multi - epoch @xmath14-band photometric monitoring during 1999 and 2000 of the 10 late - type recx stars showed that all were variable in one or both years , with the light variations ascribed to rotational modulation by cool starspots ( lawson et al .",
    "rotation periods ranging from @xmath15 d were observed in the recx stars , with the observed periods being generally consistent from 1999 to 2000 .",
    "some stars showed significant changes in the light curve amplitude between the two observing seasons , as would be expected from the evolution of the obscuring spots over the course of a year .",
    "calibrated _ vri _ photometry allowed us to better place the recx stars on the hr diagram and to infer intrinsic properties such as radius and temperature .",
    "surprisingly , comparison between the rotational and x - ray properties of these objects indicated the ` saturation ' level observed across many samples of pms stars , log ( @xmath16/@xmath17 ) @xmath18 , persists across all rotation periods in the recx stars .",
    "this unexpected finding strongly hints that the dynamo mechanism may be inadequate in explaining x - ray emission in young stars !",
    "hr diagram placement of the recx stars ( lawson at al .",
    "2001a ) showed a several myr scatter in apparent age that was ascribed significantly to unresolved binaries .",
    "in particular , two stars ( recx 9 and 12 ) appeared elevated by a factor of 2 in luminosity above other recx stars of similar spectral type , and there was nearly a factor of 2 scatter in the luminosities of the mid - k stars ( recx 1 , 7 and 11 ) . the location of recx 9 and 12 was interpreted as representing the locus of near - equal - mass binaries in the sample .",
    "recently , koehler ( these proceedings ) observed the recx stars using the adonis adaptive optics system on the eso 3.6-m telescope and found recx 1 and 9 to be binaries with @xmath19 arcsec separation ( 20 au projected distance ) .",
    "the @xmath20-band brightness ratios were @xmath21 1:1 ( recx 1 ) and 2:1 ( recx 9 ) .",
    "lawson et al . ( 2001a ) found recx 12 to be multi - periodic with 1.3 and 8.6 d periods present in the light curve during both 1999 and 2000 .",
    "since a several myr - old close binary can be tidally - locked , then one of these periods might also be the orbital period .",
    "if this interpretation is correct , then the inferred separation of the recx 12 binary is @xmath22 au .",
    "when the known and probable binaries are accounted - for , cluster members appear highly coeval to @xmath23 myr depending on the adopted pms evolutionary tracks .",
    "lawson & feigelson ( 2001 ) compared the cluster hr diagram to several contemporary grids of pms evolutionary tracks , and found factors of @xmath24 disagreement in the inferred age and mass of individual cluster members .",
    "an important test for the pms models is the rs cha binary .",
    "current models gave correct masses for the binary components ( compared to dynamical masses ) , but the inferred age of the binary system differed by a factor of 2 .",
    "the models of seiss , dufour & forestini ( 2000 ) give more self - consistent ages across the cluster hr diagram and color - mag diagram than the other models examined .    with known members ranging from spectral type b8 to m4 , and straddling a factor @xmath25 in temperature , @xmath26 in mass and @xmath27 in luminosity ,",
    "the @xmath0 cha cluster is thus a critical and difficult test for any pms evolutionary model .",
    "compared to most field stars of similar color ( or temperature ) , the @xmath0 cha stars are elevated in magnitude ( or luminosity ) in the color - mag ( or hr ) diagram due to a combination of youth , proximity , and low interstellar reddening towards the cluster [ westin ( 1985 ) found @xmath28(@xmath29 ) = 0.004 for @xmath0 cha ] . also , the late - type recx stars form a predicatable sequence in the colour - mag ( or hr ) diagram due to their coevality ( lawson et al . 2001a ) and the cluster is compact ( @xmath30 pc extent ) indicating there will be a minimal ( @xmath30% ) geometric contribution to the photometry .",
    "these favourable properties can be used to photometrically - select new candidate cluster members . follow - up spectroscopic study can then be conducted for signs of stellar youth , most importantly the presence of enhanced lithium .",
    "thus new members of the @xmath0 cha cluster can be found irrespective of their x - ray properties and without prior knowledge of their distances or proper motions .",
    "( x - ray and parallax / proper motions have been used to find members of other nearby associations such as the tw hya association ; see e.g. webb et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "a limited - area search near the central regions of the cluster has been made by lawson et al .",
    "( 2001b ) , who found several candidate members with a similar locus in the color - mag diagram as the known members , of which two were subsequently identified as optically - active , lithium - rich low - mass objects .",
    "the most significant of these is echa j0843.37905 (= _ iras _ f084507854 ; moshir et al .",
    "1989 ) , a @xmath31 ctt star with an optical spectrum dominated by strong balmer and ca ii emission . at a distance of 97",
    "pc , the star is probably the second - closest known ctt star to earth after tw hya ( if the ctt population of the mbm12 cloud is @xmath32 pc distant as suggested by luhman , these proceedings ) and another rare example of an ` old ' ctt star . compared to tw hya , echa j0843.37905 is of slightly later spectral type ( m2 , compared to k7 ) and may have slightly lower h@xmath3 activity ( @xmath33 = 110  , compared to 140  ) although it has currently unknown h@xmath3 variability .",
    "like other ctt stars echa j0843.37905 has a strong infrared excess , with a @xmath34[12 ] excess of @xmath35 mag , and shows high optical ( @xmath36 mag ) photometric variability .",
    "the other new cluster member is the m4 wtt star echa j0841.57853 , which is currently the lowest mass ( @xmath21 0.2 @xmath37 ) and optically faintest primary ( @xmath38 ) known in the cluster .",
    "neither of these stars were detected by _",
    "hri ( mamajek et al . 1999a , 2000 ) , indicating we are beginning to detect a population of x - ray - faint low - mass cluster members with log @xmath39 ergs@xmath13 ; the flux of the weakest _ rosat _ hri source , recx 9 .",
    "we are also studying a number of other low - mass cluster candidates .",
    "lyo et al .",
    "( 2001 ) will present @xmath40-band photometry of the @xmath0 cha stars obtained during the 1999 southern winter with the spirex telescope sited at the south pole .",
    "two of the @xmath0 cha stars show strong @xmath40-band excesses ; the ctt star echa j0843.37905 discussed above , and recx 11 .",
    "the latter star was identified by mamajek et al .",
    "( 2000 ) as a transition class ii / iii young stellar object between the ctt and wtt phases .",
    "recx 11 has only moderate optical activity ( h@xmath41  ) but is listed in the _ iras _ faint source catalogue (= _ iras _",
    "f08477848 ) .",
    "other recx stars show weaker @xmath40-band excesses .",
    "the @xmath0 cha cluster is a nearby ( @xmath42 pc ) , compact ( extent @xmath30 pc ) , unreddened , coeval intermediate - aged ( @xmath1 myr - old ) grouping of pms stars .",
    "this unusual combination of characteristics makes it an ideal laboratory for the study of all pms evolutionary issues , e.g. study of rotational evolution , disk dissipation and planet formation , magnetic activity evolution , the nature of pms brown dwarfs expected to accompany the stellar population , the dynamical evolution of young clusters , etc .",
    "the cluster has already proven to be a demanding calibrator for pms evolutionary models .",
    "wal thanks the conference organisers for their invitation to contribute to this meeting .",
    "he thanks eric feigelson and eric mamajek for their valuable collaboration , and lisa crause and a - ran lyo for their on - going significant contributions to the study of the @xmath0 cha cluster .",
