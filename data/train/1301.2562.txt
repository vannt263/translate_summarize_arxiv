    "when studying aspects related to localization of fields in membranes , we necessarily need to understand the solutions of differential equations with eingenvalues .",
    "this eventually leads to the study a schrdinger like equation openning the possibility for interpretation and comparison between methods and aspects of physics of extra dimensions and those of condensed matter physics . in some sense",
    ", it is another way to link these two areas , despite the celebrated ads / cdm duality .",
    "of course , there is no duality linking two theories with different regimens of coupling constant , but the basic mathematics of particles subject to potential barriers is just the same as those we attack in our training through the several famous quantum mechanical books .",
    "the question is how far can we go in this comparison .",
    "besides the most basic example , the process of localization of fields ( the zero modes or bound states ) , there is the study of resonances where the massive spectrum of particles interact with the membranes through the potential they generate @xcite .",
    "this kind of model provides a possible solution to the hierarchy problem and show how gravity is trapped to a membrane and also has important phenomenological implications to the standard model and cosmology @xcite .",
    "another very interesting step in that direction is the model regarding a universe with extra dimensions in such a way that the membranes itself generate a kind of chain or 1d - crystal @xcite .",
    "in such situation we can think about membranes in every direction in the bulk , with intersections .",
    "these are configurations already discussed in the context of string theory phenomenology , where we can generate families of particles of the standard model plus some corrections @xcite . moreover , in string theory and supergravity the antisymmetric tensor fields arise naturally @xcite and play an important role in dualization @xcite . in particular",
    ", they appear in the @xmath8 sector of each of the type ii string theories .",
    "these tensor fields couple naturally to higher - dimensional extended objects , the so - called @xmath9branes , and are important to make them stable .",
    "besides this , they are related to the linking number of higher dimensional knots @xcite and to the mechanism of topological mass generation @xcite .",
    "the rank of these antisymmetric tensors is defined by the dimension of the manifold @xcite . beyond that",
    ", these kind of fields also play an important role in the solution of the moduli stabilization problem of string theory @xcite . because of these aspects , it is important to study higher rank tensor fields in membrane backgrounds . in this direction",
    "antisymmetric tensor fields have already been considered in models of extra dimension .    in general",
    "the @xmath0forms of highest rank do not have physical relevance because when the rank increases the number of gauge freedom also increases .",
    "however , that can be used to cancel the dynamics of the field in the brane @xcite , leading to the study of the mass spectrum of the two and three - form , for example , in refs . @xcite and @xcite in a context of five dimensions with codimension one .",
    "the coupling between the two and three - forms with the dilaton was studied , in different contexts , in @xcite . in these scenarios ,",
    "some facts about localization of fields are known : the scalar field ( @xmath10form ) is localizable , but the vector gauge fields ( @xmath11form ) , the kalb - ramond field(@xmath12form ) and the three - form field are not .",
    "that happens because in four dimensions the vector field is conformal and all information coming from warp factors drops out , necessarily rendering a non - normalizable four dimensional effective action . beyond that",
    ", kehagias and tamvakis @xcite showed that the coupling between the dilaton and the vector gauge field produces localization of the vector field , and alencar _ et.al .",
    ", _ considered these coupling with a three - form field where a condition for localization was found @xcite .",
    "more recently , the problem has been generalized to @xmath2-forms @xcite .",
    "the above mentioned facts have influence on the phenomenology of the four dimensional world we live @xcite .",
    "the point we would like to address here is that , in the case of membranes distributed along extra dimensions which are slices of ads spaces , we can find bloch like solutions to the equations of motion .",
    "therefore , one can argue that these models can present a similar behavior of quasi - particles like phonons , magnons , or electrons in the presence of a periodic potential .",
    "the goal here is to extend previous works in this subject to study the behavior of bosonic form fields in the crystal manyfold universe .",
    "we go right to the point of analysis of the fields subject to the background described in @xcite . with that in mind , the organization of the paper is as follows . in the first section we shortly review the background of the crystal manyfold universe . in the second section we make a preliminary discussion of the general schrdinger like equations we must treat . in the third , fourth , fiftieth and sixtieth sections we discuss the behavior of the scalar field , the gauge vector field , the kalb - ramond field and general @xmath2-forms , respectively .",
    "we discuss for each case the bloch like behavior of the wave functions and give numerical results for mass bands . in the last section we present conclusions , more discussions and perspectives for future works .",
    "in this section we give a short review of the background metric obtained in the crystal manyfold .",
    "we only consider the simplest case with one extra dimension . following ref .",
    "@xcite , the conformal metric is defined as @xmath13 with @xmath14 where in the above equation @xmath15 ( @xmath16 is the ads radius ) .",
    "the function @xmath17 satisfy the equations @xmath18 and are given by ( @xmath19 is the spacing between the branes ) @xmath20 in order to analyze the dilaton with a conformal metric , we will use the same procedure as in ref .",
    "@xcite where the metric with dilaton is @xmath21 and after solving einstein s equation we get the relations @xcite .",
    "@xmath22 we introduce the parameter @xmath23 such that @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the case with dilaton and @xmath26 otherwise . to obtain the conformal metric",
    ", we use the transformation @xmath27 in .",
    "we obtain @xmath28 , where @xmath29 .",
    "here we focus on the prototype schrdinger - like equation that will appear through all this work .",
    "we consider the solution with some details since it will be important for all cases considered . as mentioned before we can relate the potentials with the ones obtained previously in @xcite . in all the cases",
    "the equation of motion has the following general form @xmath30\\psi(y)=m^{2}q(y)\\psi(y),\\ ] ] where @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 for all fields except gravity , in which @xmath34 .",
    "we can transform this into a schrdinger - like equation through the transformations @xmath35 with @xmath36 as stressed before , when we have an analytical expression for @xmath37 the potential is given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 . with this",
    "we arrive to a schrdinger like equation @xmath40\\bar{\\psi}(z)=m^{2}\\bar{\\psi}(z),\\ ] ] where the potential @xmath41 is given by @xmath42^{2}.\\ ] ] now , considering @xmath43 .",
    "we get @xmath44    the potential has been expressed in terms of @xmath45 due to the form of the conformal factor .",
    "it is interesting to note that the form of the potential coefficients simplifies the solution .",
    "taking @xmath46 given before we get the final schrdinger - like equation @xmath47\\psi=0.\\ ] ] this equation is very similar to the schrdinger equation for a particle propagating in a one - dimensional periodic potential ( 1d - crystal ) . in order to solve it we have to consider two adjacent elementary cells in the region @xmath48 .",
    "focusing on the region @xmath49 we need to find the appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "first of all we must have @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "where we use the definition @xmath52 . to obtain the correct boundary condition for the derivative we simply integrate the above equation from @xmath53 to @xmath54 to obtain @xmath55",
    "the equation for the first elementary cell is @xmath56 and the above equations can be expressed in terms of a bessel equation . for this",
    "we just perform the transformations @xmath57 to get @xmath58 where @xmath59 and the same equation is valid for the variables @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "it is important to mention that the quantity @xmath62 is related to the kind of field we consider as we will show later .",
    "therefore the solution of the above equation is given by @xmath63    now using the transfer matrix technique we can relate the constants @xmath64 with @xmath65 . in order to impose boundary conditions for the wave function and for its first",
    "derivative we define @xmath66 and @xmath67 with the following properties @xmath68 where the prime means a derivative with respect to the argument . after a bit of algebra",
    "we obtain @xmath69 with this the boundary conditions can be accounted by imposing    @xmath70    inverting the matrix in the rhs @xmath71 we obtain @xmath72 similarly , we can solve for the next cell ( @xmath73 ) to find @xmath74 and therefore we have four constants @xmath75and @xmath76 to be determined . in order to get this we impose the following conditions @xmath77 the first of the above conditions can be written as @xmath78 where we have used @xmath79 , resulting in @xmath80 and identically for the second condition @xmath81 from the third condition we get @xmath82 and using the last two relations we find @xmath83 the last two conditions are identical to the contour conditions used in @xmath84 and @xmath85 , therefore from them we obtain @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the same matrix as @xmath88 with @xmath89 .",
    "using now the eqs .",
    "( [ b]),([hatb ] ) and ( [ hata ] ) we get @xmath90 and finally we arrive to @xmath91 the above equation gives us a dispersion relation for the mass , where one can find , for example , the mass gap of the system considered . in order to obtain numerical results we have to discuss the magnitude of the parameters involved .",
    "we have that @xmath92 where we can compare units of mass and length . for this purpose",
    "we use @xmath93 . in the case where @xmath94 , the corrections for the newtonian potential for particles localized to a @xmath95-brane at the intersections of branes with negative tension is approximately given by @xcite    @xmath96    where @xmath97 and @xmath23 are constants of order unity . with",
    "that we can have gravity in the observational bounds , i.e. , @xmath98 .",
    "for this case @xmath99 ( @xmath100 is the number of branes in the crystal and @xmath16 is the ads radius ) . the fundamental scale should satisfy @xmath101 . if @xmath102 we find @xmath103 branes and @xmath104 ( @xmath105 ) . that is the result we put in our numerical analysis . in the next sections we present the results for each case of bosonic fields in detail .",
    "in this section we consider the scalar field case . before analyzing the massive modes we must look for the localization of the zero mode .",
    "the action for the scalar field without the dilaton coupling is given by @xmath106 and the zero mode is obtained by considering @xmath107 , which is equivalent to set @xmath108 .",
    "considering the metric in the form of eq .",
    "( [ metricaconforme ] ) we get for the effective action @xmath109 and according to the solution @xmath110 we have a well defined four dimensional action .",
    "it is clear that the scalar field is localized without the necessity of the dilaton coupling .",
    "this coupling will not change the localizability of the field , but it must be considered because of the gauge field localization . therefore , due to consistency it will be include in the analysis .    to find the massive modes we should solve the equation of motion . here",

    "this expression is the same obtained for the localization in the case of one brane . to consider the massive modes we must consider the metric defined by eq .",

    "from these the solutions are given by @xmath162",
    "the important information one can get from the calculations in previous sections is the allowed values of mass for each field . that can be obtained by solving numerically the equation ( [ massband ] ) for the cases with and without dilaton . for the case without dilaton , we solve eq .",
    "( [ massband ] ) for the scalar field using @xmath163 , for the gauge field @xmath164 , and the kalb - ramond feld @xmath165 .",
    "the allowed masses for the scalar field are shown in fig .",
    "[ v=2 ] where the lowest mass modes are plotted . as one can see , the lowest mode or the gap of mass has its maximum value at @xmath166 , and for small values of @xmath167 there are only four allowed mass values .",
    "the interesting feature about the dispersion relation equation is that due to the property of the bessel function @xmath168 and @xmath169 , the gauge field and the kalb - ramond field have the same mass dispersion as shown in fig .",
    "the main characteristic of these fields is that around @xmath166 no mass is allowed .",
    "in fact for @xmath170 the existence of mass particles is restricted to values of @xmath171 .    when considering the dilaton , depending on",
    "the coupling the order of the bessel functions in the dispersion relation can be non - integer . for @xmath172 figure [ dilaton ] shows the mass dispersion for the @xmath166 , @xmath173 , and @xmath115 forms in panels @xmath97 , @xmath23 , and @xmath174 respectively . for the scalar field fig .",
    "[ dilaton]@xmath97 shows a different behavior from the fig .",
    "[ v=2 ] the main effect is now the existence of more mass modes around @xmath166 .",
    "a similar effect happens for the gauge field , whereas in fig .",
    "[ v=2 ] there was no allowed mass for @xmath166 , one can see two possible values of mass in fig .",
    "[ dilaton]@xmath23 .",
    "the dilaton coupling breaks the degeneracy of the mass modes for the gauge and kalb - ramond fields .",
    "now , the two spectra are very different ( see fig . [",
    "dilaton]@xmath174 ) .",
    "the main effect of the coupling is to change the order of the bessel functions . the behavior of the lowest mass modes against the bessel function order is shown in fig .",
    "[ nu ] .    in the figure",
    "[ nu]@xmath97 it is possible to distinguish two regimes : for @xmath175 the mass values increases , while for @xmath176 the masses have a parabolic behavior . for @xmath177 fig .",
    "[ nu]@xmath23 shows that below @xmath178 no masses are allowed .",
    "these results leads to the fact that controlling the dilaton coupling one can generate or suppress mass modes .",
    "a similar effect can be obtained by playing around with the dimension @xmath1 and the form of the field @xmath2 .",
    "for example , in order to get @xmath179 one can have a dilaton coupling @xmath180 and the condition @xmath181 , i.e. , only an even dimension is allowed to give an integer @xmath2 form : for @xmath182 we must have q=2 .",
    "when considering @xmath183 the condition is @xmath184 , in this case only an odd dimension can give an integer @xmath2 .",
    "in this case for @xmath185 we can have @xmath186 .",
    "another interesting aspect of the mass dispersion relation is the lowest mass behavior against the spacing between the branes as shown in figure [ length ] .",
    "in there , for several values of @xmath187 the mass mode decreases as @xmath188 . for large separations the",
    "are not interfering with each other and the system behaves like a single brane and no gap appears for any any @xmath2-form or dilaton coupling .",
    "in this paper we studied aspects of bosonic fields subject to a gravitational background generated by a brane crystal system , where the simple case of branes distributed only along one extra spatial dimension was considered .",
    "the behavior of the scalar field , the gauge vector field , the kalb - ramond field and general @xmath2-forms was analyzed .",
    "the dispersion relation for the mass was presented for each field mentioned above . without the dilaton we noted that the gauge and the kalb - ramond fields have the same mass spectrum when @xmath153 .",
    "however for a lower dimension , for example @xmath189 , the scalar field and the gauge field will have the same spectrum .",
    "this is an interesting result , since different fields can have the same allowed values of mass for bosonic particles .",
    "even with the introduction of the dilaton coupling , different forms with different couplings can have the same allowed values of mass .",
    "therefore , the main conclusion is the fact different bosonic fields can produce particles with the same mass .",
    "another important aspect , is the analogy with the problem of an electron traveling through a periodic potential . in that case",
    ", one can calculate the allowed values of the electron s energy where the fields used here make the role of constraints in the potential of the 1d - crystal . that opens the possibility to relate physical effects in condensed matter physics to the physics of extra dimensions .",
    "a natural extension of this work is to study fermions subject to the same background . besides",
    ", it is very important to avoid physical space - time singularities due to the delta function like branes . in this case",
    ", we could propose smooth configurations mimicking the crystal .",
    "such configurations can be obtained as approximated multi - kink solutions of a specific scalar field configuration .",
    "these are discussions left for future researche .",
