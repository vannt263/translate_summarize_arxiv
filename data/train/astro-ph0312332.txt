    "neutron and quark stars are natural laboratories to investigate the interplay of strong , electro - weak and gravitational interaction . many theoretically determined properties of these astrophysical objects were tested by the observed properties of pulsars , and detailed calculations exist for these stars@xcite .",
    "however , if new perspectives appear in the description and understanding of the gravitational interaction or in the unification of the above interactions , then revisiting of the models becomes necessary .",
    "such a reinvestigation was triggered by the refreshed attention on compactified extra dimensions@xcite .",
    "extra dimensions inside neutron stars were investigated earlier@xcite , but the kaluza - klein ( k - k ) excitation modes were not considered in the equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "these modes are important constituents of the recent gravitation theories . introducing the k - k modes into the eos of fermion stars at their central core , new features and properties emerged  @xcite .    here",
    "we display a few of our ideas about these extra dimensions , their possible connection to particle physics and their appearance in the core of hybrid stars .",
    "we summarize our numerical results and discuss the observability of extra dimensions in these objects .",
    "the introduction of the 5^th^ dimension into the real world has a long history .",
    "we do not have any direct information about the extra dimensions , so we have an alternative .",
    "either @xmath0 does not exist , or , it is microscopically small and compact .",
    "obviously in the present paper we take the second horn of the alternative , for details see refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "quantization puts a serious constraint on five - dimensional motion .",
    "if there is an independence on @xmath0 , then the particle is freely moving in @xmath0 .",
    "however , being that direction compactified leads to an uncertainty in the position with the size of @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the compactification radius .",
    "thus a bohr - type quantum condition appears formally : @xmath3 because of the extra motion into the fifth dimension , an extra mass term appears in 4d descriptions . considering compactified radius @xmath4 cm this extra `` mass '' is @xmath5 mev ; similar values appear in ref .",
    "@xcite . a quite recent approach of hadron spectra by arkhipov  @xcite is also worthwhile to consult with .",
    "an interesting consequence of the existence of 5^th^ dimension is that in the `` 4 dimensional '' observations an apparent violation of the equivalence principle must appear as one can show it by writing the geodesic equation in 5 dimensions and then projecting it into 4 dimensions . without going into details ,",
    "the @xmath6 sign of @xmath7 causes the appearance of a `` pseudo - charge '' @xmath8 in the 4 dimensional formalism , @xmath9 which acts in a vector - scalar interaction .",
    "we can directly see that @xmath8 is _ not _ the electric charge .",
    "indeed @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the gravitational constant and @xmath12 is the rest mass  @xcite .",
    "this is either some familiar quantum number ( e.g. strangeness , @xmath13 ) , or some other not yet observed charge .",
    "we are interested in final states of stellar evolution . therefore we can restrict ourselves to static configurations .",
    "also , fluid - like behavior seems appropriate _ in the microscopical dimensions_. therefore we are looking for _ static _ configurations .",
    "also , some fluid - like behaviour is expected in the sense that stresses in the _ macroscopical _ directions freely equilibrate .",
    "then in 3 spatial directions _ isotropy _ is expected and thence _",
    "spherical symmetry_. finally , in the lack of any information so far , we may assume symmetry in the extra dimension .",
    "then in proper gr language we are looking for solutions with 5 killing vectors @xmath14 @xmath15 with the commutation relations @xmath16=0 , \\ \\ \\ \\ [ k_5,k_b]=0 , \\ \\ \\ \\   [ k_{\\alpha},k_{\\beta}]={\\epsilon}_{\\alpha \\beta \\gamma } k_{\\gamma}\\ ] ] so that the subgroup @xmath17 acts with 2 dimensional transitivity",
    ". hence the metric has the unique form @xmath18 where the quantities @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 depend only on @xmath22 . as for the energy - momentum tensor",
    "we get @xmath23    total spatial equipartition of particle momenta is not expected ( so @xmath24 ) ; indeed we shall see that it does not happen generally .",

    "the material equations , @xmath29 and the einstein equations in eqs .",
    "( [ einst1])-([einst4 ] ) are all independent equations , all further equations are consequences .",
    "( indeed there are some thermodynamical constraints between @xmath30 and @xmath31 . ) considering the appropriate bianchi identity , one obtains @xmath32 this equation clearly demonstrates the influence of the extra dimensional behavior on the normal pressure , @xmath33 .    the einstein equations eqs .",
    "( [ einst1])-([einst4 ] ) contain two extra variables compared to the more familiar 4 dimensional case , namely @xmath31 and @xmath21 .",
    "however , @xmath34 is a known function of the particle number density and specified by the actual interaction in the matter .",
    "thus @xmath35 is the only new degree of freedom determined by the extra equation .",
    "for specially chosen pressure @xmath31 there is a unique solution of the einstein equations in eqs .",

    "( [ einst1])-([einst3 ] ) can be solved separately with @xmath37 and then the last eq .",
    "( [ einst4 ] ) gives @xmath31 .",
    "although these solutions do not differ formally from the 4 dimensional neutron star solution ( except for @xmath31 ) , but the extra dimension will have its influence on @xmath38 and @xmath39  @xcite .",
    "let us start with a single massive fermion ( `` neutron '' , @xmath40 ) .",
    "since the minimal nonzero fifth momentum component is @xmath41 , then the extra direction of the phase space is not populated until the fermi - momentum @xmath42 . however , at the threshold both @xmath43 states appear .",
    "they mimic another ( `` excited '' ) particle with mass @xmath44 ( with a nonelectric `` charge '' @xmath45 as well ) .",
    "the equations obtain a form as if this second particle also appeared in complete thermodynamical equilibrium with the neutron : @xmath46 .",
    "this phenomena is repeated in any case , when @xmath47 exceeds a threshold @xmath48 .",
    "= 6.0 cm    fig .",
    "1 . compares two calculations .",
    "the solid line is 4 dimensional calculation with neutrons and @xmath49 hyperons , the lightest neutral strange baryon .",
    "( ambartsumyan and saakyan calculated such hybrid compact stars as far back as in 1960  @xcite . )",
    "the dashed and dotted lines come from 5-dimensional calculations with only neutrons , but moving in the extra dimension , too .",
    "the higher excitations are started from the triangles and they are named as @xmath50 , @xmath51 , ... , at compactified radius @xmath52 fm . in this case the 5 dimensional neutron star is almost indistinguishable from a neutron star with @xmath49 core .",
    "however , choosing another compactification radius ( e.g. @xmath53 fm ) one obtains reasonable differences , which can be seen on fig .",
    "1 . the @xmath54 , @xmath55 , ...",
    ", indicate the appearance of the excited modes in the latter case ( @xmath56 was left outside of the figure ) .",
    "in the most generic case it is true that the derivative @xmath57 . the interior solution of eqs .  ( [ einst1])-([einst4 ] ) can be obtained only numerically . in principle",
    "there is no problem to evaluate these equations , but the structure of them must be understood .",
    "first , there are constraints among the material quantities , which are rather straightforward for ideal quantum fluids . in case of interacting matter",
    "one can recall the self - consistent description of the interacting fermions in the 4 dimensional analogy  @xcite .",
    "second , the particle number density in the center , @xmath58 , is a free initial condition , as it was in the 4 dimensional case . instead of density , we may use energy density , @xmath59 , as well .",
    "third , the metric tensor is determined by the variables @xmath60 . on the other hand @xmath21 and @xmath19",
    "never appear in eqs.([einst1])-([einst4 ] ) ( reflecting the fact that @xmath61 and @xmath0 constant dilatations are always possible without harming the commutator relations for the killing motions ) , so these equations are of first order on @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath20 .",
    "however , the equations can be rearranged resulting in the following symbolic structure : @xmath64 the eqs .",
    "( [ form1])-([form2 ] ) are algebraic equations for @xmath62 and @xmath63 , but eq .  ( [ form3 ] ) is a differential equation of second order and it should be reorganized formally into 2 equations of first order .",
    "fourth , initial conditions are needed for @xmath21 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath65 . for the first two they are free additive constants and for @xmath20 and @xmath65 we can proceed as in 4 dimensions",
    "anyway , it is clear that even if we choose such initial conditions that , then it does not remain zero out of the center .",
    "the integration must go until the fluid - vacuum interface at @xmath66 , where an exterior vacuum solution continues the interior one .",
    "the details of matching conditions can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . applying them on the present problem",
    "we get the continuity of certain derivatives of the metric tensor , and those for the energy - momentum tensor result in the single equation , @xmath67 observe that no constraint is obtained either for @xmath68 or @xmath31 .",
    "although @xmath31 might be anything at @xmath66 from the matching conditions , it will be zero for all general ( not very exotic ) systems .",
    "namely , @xmath69 is expected at some _ low _ particle number density @xmath70 on the surface , which is generally much below @xmath71 .",
    "so motions in the @xmath72 dimension cease already somewhere in the interior of the star",
    ".    henceforth vacuum solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ einst1])-([einst4 ] ) are valid until infinity , and @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 give initial conditions for the external solution .",
    "interestingly enough , the external solutions can be obtained in analytical ( albeit partly implicit ) forms .",
    "the external solution of the einstein equations can be obtained in analytic form . equaling the matter contribution with zero on the left hand sides and using the new variables @xmath77 and @xmath78 as @xmath79 the 4 einstein equations results in 3 differential equations , @xmath80 ( where @xmath81 ) , and one more equation becomes an identity .",
    "( [ lambda])-([psi ] ) can be integrated as @xmath82 with two constants @xmath83 . for variable @xmath84 eq.([lambda ] ) yields the following : @xmath85\\ ] ] this last equation can be solved in an implicit form .",
    "there are three solutions according to the sign of the determinant . here",
    "we give the one for positive determinant : @xmath86   = \\ln \\left [ \\left({{y - y_+}\\over { y_0 - y_+ } } \\right)^u                     \\left({{y - y_-}\\over { y_0 - y_- } } \\right)^v              \\right]\\ ] ] where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are constants of integration .",
    "furthermore , @xmath89 and then @xmath90 of course , this solution goes to flat space - time as @xmath91 .",
    "the @xmath92 special solution belongs to @xmath93 .",
    "however , as we claimed earlier , @xmath94 .",
    "we do not know compact stars close to sun , so the observations are rather hazy for details .",
    "however some data exist for masses and radii . in the previous chapters we showed that the calculations are as straightforward in 5 dimensions as in 4 . while some problems must be relegated to the next , last chapter , in principle one could compare observations with 4- and 5-dimensional calculations , and try to decide if space is 3 dimensional or 4 .",
    "the difference comes from two reasons .",
    "\\1 ) at some fermi momentum the phase space opens up in the 5^th^ direction .",
    "henceforth @xmath95 increases slower , which will be reflected by the m(r ) relation .",
    "however note that 5^th^ dimensional effects can mimic particle excitations .",
    "\\2 ) quite new effects can , in principle , be observed around compact stars . of course , they may be moderate and the present observational techniques are probably insufficient",
    ". however , consider 2 situations :    you can perform light deflection experiments .",
    "trajectories differ in 4 and 5 dimensions .",
    "you may perform `` free fall '' experiments in vacuum but not very far from the star .",
    "then 1 ) particles moving also into the extra direction would fall `` anomalously '' , but this is a simple eotvos - type experiment and can be done in lab too .",
    "however 2 ) @xmath96 , so also a `` scalar force '' appears for particles moving in the extra dimension , although we are outside of the exotic interior of the star .",
    "this means that accelerator experiments not too far from compact stars would show up surprising results _ if _ 5^th^ dimension exists .",
    "so not only the dense source would be different .",
    "gravity is a phenomenon of space - time and 5-dimensional space - time differs from the 4-dimensional one .    before truly realistic 5-dimensional calculations",
    "some problems must be fully clarified .",
    "they are listed in the last chapter .",
    "while we can calculate 5-dimensional compact stars in this moment , the results still depend on parameters to be fixed in the future , we , somewhat arbitrarily , classify problems into 3 groups : factual , technical and fundamental .",
    "\\1 ) factual problems : +   in the present approach this radius was a free parameter . for demonstration",
    "we chose the radius @xmath97 cm , when the strange @xmath49 baryon could behave as the first excitation of a neutron .",
    "such an extradimensional object can mimics a compact star with neutrons in the mantle and @xmath49 s in the core . with smaller",
    "@xmath2 the `` exotic '' component appears at larger densities  we may run into the unstable region of the hybrid star and the extra dimension remains undetectable .",
    "however , with larger @xmath2 the mass gap becomes smaller and the `` transition '' happens at `` familiar '' neutron star densities . in this way",
    ", reliable observations could lead to an upper bound on @xmath2 . _ the quantum number connected with motion in @xmath0 : _ we saw that a neutron , starting to move in the 5^th^ direction , appears in macroscopic 4-dimensional description as if a neutral baryon , but with a higher mass .",
    "particle tables mention such particles in abundance .",
    "but we also mentioned that 5 dimensional gr gives that the 4 dimensional projection of the geodesics of such particles would exhibit a really weak apparent violation of the equivalence principle , via a vector - scalar force . in first approximation",
    "this would mimic a coulomb-_like _ force , but cca .",
    "@xmath98 times weaker .",
    "now , there was one serious attempt to see the violation of the equivalence principle ( in the eotvos experiment  @xcite ) ; there it seemed that the strength was in this range .",
    "the tentative idea was that the violation might be connected with hypercharge @xmath99 , and there was also a discussion  @xcite whether the mass difference of @xmath100 and anti-@xmath100 came from the interaction of earth s particles with the kaon in lab .",
    "now , in some sense the `` first excitation '' of @xmath28 in @xmath84 is @xmath49 .",
    "it would be a nice minimal theory if fifth dimension would explain the cp - violation of weak interaction as well , but of course we can not expect this .    _ the way of compactification : _",
    "here we chose the simplest compactification : @xmath101 .",
    "this is a cylindrical compactification",
    ". however more complicated cases are also possible , albeit not arbitrary ones .",
    "a branch of gr lists all the cases ; now we mention only the 2-dimensional example that from a plane by cut and sew you can produce of course a compact cylinder , but the mantle of a cone as well .    _ the number of the extra dimensions : _ the present example was the simplest nontrivial case .",
    "however maybe particle physicists would prefer 6 extra dimensions appearing with the same length scale in some group structure .",
    "the `` extra forces '' appearing from fifth dimension are gravitational , the extra quantum number appearing here can not be the source of qcd forces  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite we discussed _ two _ extra dimensions with different scales .",
    "\\2 ) technical problems : +  we mentioned that we need to fix 3 initial conditions in the center : one for the central density of matter ( @xmath102 or @xmath103 ) , and two for the metric , either for @xmath104 and @xmath105 , or , equivalently , for @xmath104 and @xmath106 .",
    "but we can not properly impose these conditions in @xmath107 , and these conditions are somehow not independent .",
    "however the technical problem is well known already in 4 dimensions  @xcite .",
    "first , the proper way is to approximate the innermost core of radius @xmath108 with a homogeneous sphere of density @xmath109 , where the exact value of @xmath108 is irrelevant if small enough .",
    "then @xmath110 at @xmath111 , and @xmath112 there",
    ".    _ interactions : _",
    "@xmath113 interaction can be taken into account the same way as in ref.@xcite .",
    "neutrons moving into the extra dimension may interact differently because of an extra momentum dependence .",
    "such momentum dependence appears e.g. in walecka - type  @xcite construction .",
    "\\3 ) theory : + a consequent 5-dimensional treatment would require unified theory of quantum mechanics and general relativity .",
    "this unified theory is not available now , and we know evidences that present qm is incompatible with present gr .",
    "the well - known demonstrative examples are generally between qft and gr ( e.g. the notion of quantum field theory vacua is only lorentz - invariant and hence come ambiguities about the existence of cosmological hawking radiations  @xcite ) . but also , it is a fundamental problem that the lhs . of einstein equation is @xmath114-number , while the rhs",
    ". should be a quantum object .    in the present case qm and",
    "gr have to be used in a compatible way for the proper `` bohr - type '' quantization of @xmath7 .",
    "our chosen way was intuitive .",
    "sure , it is correct for @xmath115",
    ". then one can always introduce such a coordinate system where @xmath37 and then the circumference is the usual @xmath116 .",
    "but in the general case one might use @xmath116 in the condition as well as @xmath117 .",
    "all suggestions up to now ( as .",
    "e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) are restricted to the simpler case .",
    "this paper has displayed the introduction of 5^th^ dimension into astrophysical description in the framework of gr .",
    "the new degrees of freedom may solve old problems , but open new questions , as well .",
    "we think that this attempt is worthwhile .",
