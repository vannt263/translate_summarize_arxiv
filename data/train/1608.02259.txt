    "one of the most remarkable characteristics of the bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) is its response to rotate with superfluid nature @xcite .",
    "the superfluid nature of this system is investigated using the moment of inertia . for a macroscopic system ,",
    "the moment of inertia is given by the rigid value unless it exhibits superfluidity .",
    "a deviation of the moment of inertia from the rigid value represents an important manifestion of superfluidity . in this respect ,",
    "stringari @xcite drew a parallel between the rotating bec and the superfluid systems , and he pointed out that the rotational properties of a bec provides a natural way to analyze the deviations from a rigid motion due to condensation .",
    "several studies showed that the evidence of the superfluidity in a rotating bec is the reduction of the moment of inertia below the classical rigid - body value @xcite .",
    "mainly , the moment of inertia is calculated in terms of the effective _ in situ _ radii and the normalized temperature . the approach of brosens et al .",
    "@xcite of the moment of inertia is based on the _ in situ _ radial radius @xmath2 .",
    "their analysis focused on the difference of the moment of inertia of a totally classical boltzmann gas in a trap and @xmath3 for a bose gas ( cf .",
    "therefore , they missed the true superfluid effects that may only be analyzed by calculating the moment of inertia from quantum mechanical response to rotations .",
    "in contrast , stringari s work @xcite is based on linear response theory .",
    "he obtained the different contributions from the condensate and the thermal cloud to the response coefficient both for an ideal and an interacting bose gas .",
    "schneider et al .",
    "@xcite presented a calculation of the fully quantum mechanical moment of inertia for a microscopic cloud ( in the presence of vortices ) of non - interacting atoms in a cylindrically symmetrical trap . however , an ideal bec of ( non - interacting bosons ) is not a true superfluid , because the landau criterion for superfluidity is not obeyed @xcite .",
    "superfluidity , the formation of the vortex lattice , is a direct effect of inter - particle interactions , that would not occur in the ideal bec case .    in this work , having clarified that the moment of inertia can be derived in terms of the effective _ in situ _ radii , we discuss how quantitative results can be obtained in the presence of interatomic interactions .",
    "the temperature - dependent for the _ in situ radii _ is calculated within the mean field hartree - fock approximation @xcite .",
    "this approach can be summarized as follow : a conventional method of statistical quantum mechanics is used to calculate the temperature dependency _ in situ _ radii .",
    "the parametrized formula for the _ in situ _ radii are used in calculating the moment of inertia .",
    "the obtained results showed that the above mentioned quantities have a special temperature behavior @xcite .",
    "the paper is planned as follows : section two includes the basic formalism for calculating the effective in _ situ _ radii .",
    "interaction and temperature dependency of the moment of inertia are given in section three .",
    "conclusion is given in the last section .",
    "the ideal bose - einstein condensation phenomenon is most conveniently described in the grand - canonical ensemble . for an ideal bose gas ,",
    "the average number of particles , @xmath4 , in a single particle state @xmath5 with energy @xmath6 is given by the familiar bose - einstein distribution , @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the effective fugacity , and @xmath10 is the chemical potential , determined by the conservation of total number of particles @xmath11 the degeneracy factors are avoided by accounting for degenerate states individually . once @xmath12 has been determined , all thermodynamically relevant quantities can be calculated from partial derivatives of the grand potential @xmath13 , the logarithm of the grand canonical partition function , such as the _ in situ radii _ , the condensate fraction , etc .",
    "the effective _ in situ _ radius of trapped ideal boson gas was obtained by considering the statistical quantum mechanics arguments @xcite . for a trapped boson in spherically symmetric harmonic potential , @xmath14 , the effective _ in situ _ radius of a single particle state @xmath5",
    "is given by its expectation value in this stat , i.e .",
    "@xmath15 with @xmath16 is the eigenvalue of the potential @xmath17 .",
    "the effective _ in situ _ radius of @xmath18 atoms is found by gathering eqs.([eq61 - 1 ] ) and ( [ eq61 ] ) @xmath19 and can be expressed in terms of the thermodynamic potential @xmath13 , @xmath20 the relation @xmath21 is used here .",
    "thus the effective _ in situ _ radius is given by @xmath22    for a cylindrically symmetric trap with @xmath23 , the temperature dependence of the three effective _ in situ _ is the same as in a spherically symmetric trap discussed above .",
    "assuming an axial trap frequency @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath25 where @xmath26 is the trap deformation parameter .",
    "generalization to highly anisotropic trap ( which is mainly used for rotating condensate ) is straightforward . assuming that the trap deformation parameters for highly anisotropic trap are given by @xmath27 the three effective _ in situ _ radii are given by @xcite , @xmath28    however , once the thermodynamic potential @xmath13 has been determined , the effective _ in situ _ radius can be calculated .",
    "our approach is expected to provide correctly the interaction dependence of @xmath13 potential , apart from the critical behavior near the bec transition temperature where the mean - field approach is known to fail .",
    "generally , the simplest way to include the interaction effect is to use the hartree - fock approximation . within this approximation ,",
    "the thermal component is treated as a gas of non - interacting atoms moving in a self - consistently determined mean - field potential given by @xmath29 ,      \\label{eq3 - 1}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the interaction strength and @xmath31 , \\label{eq2}\\ ] ] with @xmath32 are the effective trapping frequencies .",
    "the densities of the thermal and condensate component are given as a solution of the two coupled equations : the thermal atoms satisfies schrdinger equation @xmath33    \\psi_i(x , y , z ) = \\epsilon_i \\psi_i(x , y , z )   \\label{eq7}\\ ] ] while the condensate part satisfies the time independent gross - pitaevskii equation @xmath34    \\phi(x , y , z ) = \\mu \\phi(x , y , z ) , \\label{eq8}\\ ] ] equations ( [ eq7 ] ) and ( [ eq8 ] ) along with the constraint that the total number of atoms @xmath18 is fixed , @xmath35 form a closed set of equations which should be solved self - consistently .",
    "two further simplifications can be made as a consequence of the relative diluteness of the thermal component compared to the condensate @xcite : + ( i ) at very low temperature the effect of thermal atoms on the condensate can be neglected .",
    "therefore , setting @xmath36 in eq.([eq8 ] ) and applying the thomas - fermi ( tf ) approximation gives the usual tf profile for the condensate    @xmath37    for all @xmath38 and @xmath39 = 0 elsewhere .",

    "the result in eq.([eq11 ] ) can be expressed in terms of the condensate number of atoms through the relation between @xmath10 and @xmath44 ,    @xmath45    @xmath46 representing the geometric mean @xmath47 .",

    "+ ( ii ) further , within the same approximation , the mean - field energy , @xmath53 due to the thermal component itself can be neglected , so that the effective potential experienced by the thermal atoms is then given by @xmath54 where the mean - field chemical potential @xmath55 is given by eq.([eq13 ] ) and @xmath56 limit is indicated .",
    "eq.([eq14 ] ) shows that the condensate density is drastically altered from the ideal case , reflecting that the shape of the confining potential has a three - dimensional ` mexican - hat ' shape @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xmath55 is the relevant energy scale parametrizing the effects of interactions , up to the point in the trap where @xmath57 .",
    "now , it is straightforward to calculate the thermodynamic potential @xmath13 for the interacting bose gas @xcite .",
    "however , for large number of particles in the system , eq.([eq4 - 1 ] ) provides a complicated sum over @xmath58 .",
    "it is hard to evaluate this sum analytically in a closed form .",
    "another possible way to do this analysis , is to use the semiclassical approximation in which the sum in eq.([eq4 - 1 ] ) is converted into a phase space integral @xcite , @xmath59 } { dp_xdp_ydp_z dxdydz }    \\nonumber\\\\ & = & q_0   + \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{th}^3 }    \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{{\\textsc z}^j } { j^{5/2 } } \\int   e^{- j\\beta   v_{eff}(x , y , z ) } { dxdydz }       \\label{eq5 - 3 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is the thermodynamic potential accounted for the atoms in the ground state and @xmath61 is the thermal de broglie wavelength .",

    "for relatively high temperature , ( compared with @xmath62 ) the majority of thermal atoms lie outside the condensate in the region where therefore , it is reasonable to approximate the full effective potential as the bare trapping potential and consider only the region outside the condensate .",
    "this does not mean that the effect of interactions may be neglected as the chemical potential has a value that differs substantially from the ideal value .",
