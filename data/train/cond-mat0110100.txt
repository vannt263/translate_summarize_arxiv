    "the richness of phase behavior of systems with purely repulsive interactions depends crucially on the number of components . for a one - component system like colloidal hard spheres",
    ", there occurs a freezing transition from a single fluid phase to a dense crystal . adding a second component , such as non - adsorbing globular polymer coils@xcite , or rod - like particles@xcite generates an effective depletion - induced attraction between colloidal spheres , leading to the possibility of demixing .",
    "this transition is an analog of the vapor - liquid transition in simple fluids : the phase that is concentrated in one of the components corresponds to a liquid , while the dilute phase corresponds to a vapor , and one frequently refers to such phases as colloidal liquid and colloidal vapor , although the `` vapor '' is concentrated in the added component .",
    "generic theoretical models for such systems are those introduced by asakura and oosawa ( ao ) and independently by vrij@xcite , bolhuis and frenkel ( bf)@xcite , and widom and rowlinson ( wr)@xcite . the ao model comprises hard colloidal spheres mixed with polymer spheres that are ideal amongst themselves but can not penetrate the colloids .",
    "the bf model adds stiff vanishingly thin needles to a hard sphere system . because of their vanishing thickness",
    ", the needles do not interact with one another .",
    "clearly , both models are similar in spirit , as a non - interacting component is added to hard spheres . in the wr model this is different ; two species of spheres interact symmetrically , such that hard core repulsion occurs only between particles of unlike species .",
    "hence a pure system of either component is an ideal gas .",
    "all of these model binary mixtures exhibit liquid - vapor phase separation , well - established by computer simulations and theories @xcite .",
    "the wr model@xcite has been studied with a range of approaches , including mean - field theory ( mft)@xcite , percus - yevick ( py ) integral equation theory@xcite , scaled - particle theory ( spt ) @xcite , as well as computer simulations@xcite .",

    "a reservoir description has proven to be useful .",
    "the reservoir density of either polymers or needles rules the strength of effective attraction and hence plays a role similar to ( inverse ) temperature in simple substances .",
    "although the wr model features an intrinsic symmetry which seems to preclude such a description , an effective model can also be formulated@xcite . in the present work we consider the phase behavior of a mixture of spheres , polymers and needles , a natural combination of the above binary cases .",

    "the colloid - needle demixing curve lies well above this region , and is only weakly affected by @xmath119 . in the absence of needles ( @xmath115 ) and for large enough polymer density , colloids and polymers demix , indicated by a miscibility gap along the @xmath115 axis ( see fig .  [",
    "figwr1]a for @xmath117 ) .",
    "increasing needle density @xmath120 causes the gap to shrink and eventually to disappear in a critical point .",

    "increasing polymer density ( @xmath127 in fig.[figwr2]b ) shifts the @xmath79 critical point to lower @xmath103 , distorting the formerly rounded shape of the binodal . for @xmath121 ,",
    "polymers and needles demix , as @xmath106 is above the critical value for the widom - rowlinson type demixing of these species .",
    "the presence of colloids ( @xmath128 ) disturbs the @xmath77-transition ; the miscibility gap narrows , eventually disappearing in a critical point , with subsequent miscibility . at @xmath129 ( fig .",
    "[ figwr2]c ) the @xmath79 and @xmath77 critical points merge into a single one , and a needle - rich phase ( @xmath4 ) becomes isolated .",
    "this coexists with a phase that consists ( primarily ) of colloids and polymers at varying composition . for growing @xmath106",
    ", the `` double '' critical point broadens into a line and results in a thin neck joining both transitions .    with increasing @xmath106",
    "the coexistence region broadens further ( see fig .",
    "[ figwr2]d for @xmath130 ) .",
    "colloids and polymers also demix . for @xmath115 ,",
    "the system is above the critical point for the pure ao model , and hence coexistence between colloid - rich and polymer - rich phases occurs .",
    "again , the presence of the third component , in this case @xmath4 , causes the density gap to shrink and eventually disappear with a critical point .",
    "as all binary subsystems are by now demixed , it is evident that the system will ultimately display coexistence between three phases , each one enriched by one of the components , and represented by a triangle in system representation .",
    "each corner of the triangle corresponds to one of the three coexisting phases .",
    "the gibbs phase rule dictates that one degree of freedom remains , which is @xmath93 or , equivalently , @xmath106 ( note that for hard - body systems , temperature is trivially related to pressure ) .",
    "it is striking , however , how this triangle develops .",
    "one might expect this to occur by the joining of existing binary coexistence regions .",
    "this is not the case .",
    "the ternary region instead grows solely out of the @xmath4-rich  poor coexistence , whereby @xmath78-coexistence is only a spectator , separated by mixed states .",
    "the initial three - phase triangle is extremely elongated ( being a line as a boundary case ) .",
    "one corner corresponds to a needle - rich phase ; both others differ only slightly in densities , one phase favoring colloids , the other polymers . moving away from this @xmath78-edge of",
    "the triangle ( by reducing @xmath104 ) leads to binary coexistence between @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "this phase separation is reminiscent of the behavior of the pure ao model .",
    "however this reentrant coexistence is triggered by the presence of the needles , and it is separated ( by mixed states ) from the pure ao transition ( and its region of stability in the presence of needles ) . in fig .",
    "[ figwr2]e we show results for @xmath131 , where the critical points of both @xmath78 transitions have already merged , and again a neck is reminiscent of the formerly distinct transitions . for still larger",
    "@xmath106 , the three - phase triangle grows further ( see fig .",
    "[ figwr2]f for @xmath132 ) .",
    "ultimately , at sufficient concentration the colloids must freeze , but we disregard the solid phase in the present work .",
    "we finally note that the whole scenario is covered over a relatively small density interval @xmath133 , and that the packing fractions of colloids and polymers are only moderate",
    ". however , needle densities can be quite high .",
    "in conclusion , we have considered a simple hard - body model for a mixture of spherical colloidal particles , globular polymer coils and needle - shaped objects , which may represent either colloidal needles , stretched polymers or polyelectrolytes .",
    "we have extended a recent dft approach to this model and applied it to bulk fluid phases .",
    "the resulting phase behavior is very rich , ensuing from competition of demixing in the binary subsystems .",
    "the present work has interesting implications for the techniques of integrating out degrees of freedom ( see e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "note that by integrating out , e.g. , the needles , effective interactions between pairs of colloids , pairs of polymers , as well as colloids and polymers arise .",
    "hence one arives at a binary mixture with ( soft ) depletion interactions . to what extent the ultimate mapping onto a one - component ( colloid ) system , by further integrating out the polymers , can be achieved",
