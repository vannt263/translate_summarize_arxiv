    "the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) problem @xcite , the self - consistent determination of gap functions and their eigenstates , appears in broad areas of physics , e.g. , fermionic superfluids or superconductors in condensed matter and ultracold atom physics , organic semiconductors such as polyacetylene @xcite , and the mean - field study of nambu - jona lasinio or gross - neveu models @xcite as an effective description of quantum chromodynamics @xcite .",
