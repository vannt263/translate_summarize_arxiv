    "the violation of cp symmetry has been with us for more than three decades since it was first observed in the neutral kaon system [ 1 ] . within the context of the standard model ( sm ) [ 2 ] the cp violation",
    "is accommodated by virtue of a complex phase that exists in the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix for the charged weak current [ 3 ] . the origin of the complex phase has been remained in the standard model unexplained . a number of speculations have been proposed for possible explanations .",
    "one of the possibilities is that cp symmetry is violated in the higgs sector , if there are at least two higgs doublets [ 4 ] .",
    "it is known that supersymmetric standard models require at least two higgs doublets in their higgs sectors .",
    "the two higgs doublets give separately masses to the up - type quarks and the down - type quarks [ 5 ] .",
    "if the supersymmetry ( susy ) is exact in the model , where the sm particles and their superparticles have equal masses , cp violation would be absent in its higgs sector , since certain restrictions from the susy are imposed on the higgs sector .",
    "the supersymmetric model can not however have an exact susy since the nature is not supersymmetric at electroweak level . if the susy is broken somehow in the model for phenomenological analyses , for example by introduction of the soft susy breaking terms , cp violation may arise in the higgs sector of the supersymmetric standard model .    in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , many authors have investigated the possibilities of cp violation either explicitly or spontaneously .",
    "it is found that the tree - level higgs potential of the mssm is unable to break the cp symmetry in either way .",
    "further investigations at 1-loop level of the mssm show that the scenario of spontaneous cp violation is experimentally ruled out by the higgs boson serch at the cern @xmath4 lep , because it leads to a very light neutral higgs boson [ 6 ] .",
    "however , at the 1-loop level , the scenario of explicit cp violation in the mssm is found to be viable through the radiatively corrected higgs potential [ 7 ] .",
    "subsequently , a number of investigations have been devoted to the effects of explicit cp violation in the mssm at 1-loop level to the charged higgs boson [ 8 ] as well as to the neutral ones [ 9 ] by considering radiative corrections .",
    "it has been expected that at higher level the effect of explicit cp violation in the mssm may lead to significant modifications to the tree level higgs couplings to fermions and to gauge bosons .",
    "meanwhile , the cp symmetry may also be broken if the higgs sector is extended by introducing at least one higgs singlet .",
    "then , the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) is the right candidate for cp violation , which is basically different from the mssm in that it has one extra higgs singlet . for the spontaneous cp violation",
    ", it is well known that the tree - level higgs potential of the nmssm can not provide the ground [ 10 ] .",
    "the situation is not improved at the 1-loop level by considering radiative corrections , if the top scalar quarks are degenerated in their masses [ 11 ] . in the nmssm higgs sector ,",
    "spontaneous cp violation may only be realized by virtue of radiative corrections when the mass splitting effects between the top scalar - quarks are taken into account [ 12 ] .    at the tree - level , unlike the mssm , the scenario of explicit cp violation is acceptable by the nmssm . by assuming the degeneracy of the top scalar - quark masses in the higgs sector of the nmssm , it is found that large explicit cp violation may be realized as the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the neutral higgs singlet approaches to the electroweak scale [ 13 ] .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the effects of the explicit cp violation on the charged higgs boson in the nmssm .",
    "we calculate radiative corrections to the masses of both the charged higgs boson and the neutral ones in the nmssm due to the quarks and scalar - quarks of the third generation .",
    "the 1-loop effective potential which includes the effects of the mass splittings in the scalar - quarks is employed . assuming the nondegeneracy of the scalar - quark masses of the third generation in the 1-loop effective potential",
    ", a cp violating phase occurs from soft susy breaking terms , which penetrates into the radiatively corrected masses of the charged higgs boson as well as of the neutral ones .",
    "phenomenological implications and constraints by those cp violating higgs masses are investigated over a wide region of the parameter space of the nmssm , using the production processes of the neutral higgs boson in @xmath4 collisions .",
    "in particular , the results at lep2 with @xmath5=200 gev are used .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we consider radiative corrections to the higgs boson mass by using the 1-loop effective potential in explicit cp violation scenario . in the third section ,",
    "we obtain phenomenological constraints on the charged higgs boson mass , the vev of the neutral higgs singlet , by considering the neutral higgs production at lep2 . in the last section ,",
    "conclusions are discussed .",

    "@xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 are the soft susy breaking masses . @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the trilinear soft susy breaking parameters with mass dimension . the role of the soft - terms in the higgs potential is to break susy .",
    "the @xmath25 terms come from the part of chiral auxiliary superfield while the @xmath26 terms come from the part of gauge auxiliary superfield .    in order to consider the explicit cp violation in the higgs sector , @xmath16 , @xmath34 , @xmath17 , and @xmath35",
    "are assumed to be complex numbers . among them , @xmath36 and @xmath37 can be adjusted to be real and positive by redefining the overall phases of the superfields @xmath18 and @xmath12 .",
    "then , we are left essentially with one phase : it may be chosen to be the one in @xmath38 = @xmath39 , which allows for explicit cp violation in the tree level higgs potential of the nmssm .",
    "we assume that the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of three neutral higgs fields @xmath7 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 are nonvanishing values , both real and positive , so that there is no spontaneous cp violation in the higgs sector .    the conditions that the higgs potential becomes minimum at @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 yield three constraints , which can eliminate the soft susy breaking masses @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 from the potential @xmath46 .",
    "note that although the phase @xmath47 is present in the potential , it disappears from the vacuum after applying the three minimum conditions for the vevs .",

    "the three orthogonal combinations among @xmath53 and @xmath57 yield one neutral goldstone boson and a pair of charged goldstone bosons ; they will eventually be absorbed into the longitudinal component of @xmath58 and @xmath59 gauge bosons , respectively .",
    "we take the constraints @xmath60 and @xmath61 for the electroweak gauge bosons with @xmath62 = 175 gev .",
    "it has already been observed that the above tree level higgs potential is significantly affected by radiative corrections due to the quarks and scalar - quarks of the third generation .",

    "we employ here the method of the effective potential .",

    "next , we assume that @xmath87 and @xmath88 , on the ground that the leading radiative corrections come from the contribution of the top quark and top scalar - quark , although those of the bottom quark and bottom scalar quark for large @xmath2 is not negligible .",
    "accordingly , we may set the phase of @xmath89 to be equal to that of @xmath90 .",

    "notice that at the 1-loop level the phase @xmath47 of the explicit cp violation would be absent as long as the scalar - quarks of the third generation are degenerate in their masses .",

    "the full higgs potential of the nmssm up to the 1-loop level may be decomposed into the neutral and the charged parts , according to which higgs fields are involved .",

    "are all non - zero .",
    "this implies that the scalar - pseudoscalar mixings at tree level may not occur between two higgs doublets @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",

    "every element of the mass matrix which describes the scalar - pseudoscalar mixings among the neutral higgs boson masses are nonzero and proportional to @xmath121 at the 1-loop level .",

    "if @xmath34 be of the order of 1 tev , @xmath136 would depend weakly on @xmath47 , and if @xmath34 be as small as o(0.1 tev ) , it would strongly depend on @xmath47 .",
    "moreover , unlike the neutral higgs sector , the charged higgs boson mass at the tree level depends on all the six parameters : @xmath2 , @xmath16 , @xmath34 , @xmath17 , @xmath49 , and @xmath47 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath136 on @xmath16 is not clearly visible in above expressions .",

    "the remaining parameters are set as @xmath167 gev , @xmath157 , @xmath158 , @xmath168 , @xmath159 gev , and @xmath169 gev .",
    "those parameter values are consistent with the phenomenological constraints of lep2 at @xmath163 gev .",
    "the two solid curves correspond to the tree - level masses of the charged higgs boson , and the two dashed curves to the radiatively corrected ones . in both case , the upper one for @xmath170 gev and the lower one to @xmath171 gev .",
    "we find that the tree - level mass of the charged higgs boson is roughly stable against the variation of the cp violation phase while the 1-loop level one decreases slightly as as @xmath47 goes from zero to @xmath134 . from the figure",
    ", it is clearly shown that the radiative corrections to the charged higgs boson mass are negative for @xmath172 , and that the amount of radiative corrections decrease as the cp violation phase goes from zero to @xmath134 .",
    "another point to note is that for the whole range of @xmath47 from 0 to @xmath134 , the mass of the charged higgs boson for @xmath171 gev is found to be larger than that for @xmath170 gev .",
    "this behavior does not change if the 1-loop contributions are included .",
    "note that similar patterns are exhibited in the mssm .    in the lower part of the same figure , there are a dotted curve and a dash - dotted one .",
    "they are the plots of the radiatively corrected masses of the lightest neutral scalar higgs boson , @xmath156 , as function of the cp violation phase , for the same set of parameter values .",
    "the dotted curve corresponds to @xmath156 for @xmath34=200 gev and the dot - dashed curve for @xmath34=400 gev . unlike the charged higgs mass , one can find that there occurs a crossover between the two curves as @xmath47 moves from zero to @xmath134 : the mass for @xmath34=200 gev decreases as @xmath47 increases , whereas the one for @xmath34=400 gev increases as @xmath47 increases .",
    "we repeat the same calcuations as fig .",
    "2(a ) by changing the value of @xmath2 from 2 to 10 .",
    "the result is plotted in fig .",
    "2(b ) . in both figures ,",
    "the values of the other parameters are same , and the figure captions are also the same . in fig .",
    "2(b ) , one can see that the behavior of the mass of the charged higgs boson for @xmath173 is quite similar to the one for @xmath157 , except that the mass of the charged higgs boson for @xmath174 = 10 is always larger by about 270 gev than the one for @xmath157 , regardless of the value of @xmath47 . from figs .",
    "2(a ) and 2(b ) , we may infer that independently of the value of @xmath2 , the radiative corrections to the charged higgs boson mass contribute more negatively as the cp violation phase increases",
    ".    however , the behavior of @xmath156 for @xmath173 is different from the one for @xmath157 . as we noted earlier",
    ", there is a crossover for @xmath175 between @xmath156 for @xmath170 gev and the one for @xmath171 gev as @xmath47 moves from zero to @xmath134 . for @xmath176",
    ", there occurs no crossover at all between the curves for @xmath170 and 400 gev .",
    "figure 2(b ) shows that @xmath156 remains roughly constant as @xmath47 varies , for @xmath176 .",
    "we perform the calculations repeatedly by changing the values of the relevant parameters to examine if peculiar behaviors might be found . for wide ranges of parameter values",
    ", no such peculiarity is found .",
    "the detailed numerical results are similiar to the behaviors shown in figs .",
    "2 . in the presence of explicit cp violation ,",
    "the radiative corrections to the mass of the charged higgs boson is negative for @xmath172 , whereas those to the mass of the lightest neutral higgs boson may be either negative or positive contributions , depending on the particular set of parameter values .",
    "we turn to the higgs production in @xmath177 collisions .",
    "we feel that it is worthwhile to investigate whether the lep2 data at @xmath163 gev can put a phenomenological constraint on the values of the nmssm parameters . in fig .",
    "3 , we plot the lower bounds on @xmath49 as function of @xmath2 for two different values of @xmath47 .",
    "the solid curve corresponds to @xmath131 ( no cp violation ) and the dashed one to @xmath161 ( maximal cp violation ) .",
    "all the other parameters are allowed to vary freely only if they satisfy the condition that @xmath162 should be less than 0.1 pb , by using a random number generating function .",
    "the lower region of each curve is where the cross section for the higgs production in @xmath177 collisions at @xmath163 gev , @xmath162 , is larger than 0.1 pb , and thus should be excluded .",
    "we can say that @xmath49 may by no means be smaller than 16 gev for any set of values for other relevant parameters of the nmssm , if the lep2 data at @xmath163 gev is taken into account with a discovery limit of 0.1 pb .",
    "thus , 16 gev is a kind of universal lower bound on @xmath49 in the nmssm with explicit cp violation .",
    "figure 3 also tells us that the lower bound on @xmath49 increases up to as much as 37 gev as @xmath2 decreases to 10 down from 40 . for @xmath178 , note that",
    "the lower bound on @xmath49 for @xmath131 is larger than that for @xmath161 .",
    "we extend the preceding analysis to other relevant parameters of the nmssm to see whether the lep2 data at @xmath163 gev can also put similar constraints on them .",
    "the procedure begins by generating random numbers for the parameter values , for a fixed value of the cp violating phase . for a partucluar set of parameter values",
    ", we calculate the masses of the neutral scalar higgs bosons and check if the center of mass energy of the @xmath177 collider , @xmath5 , is sufficient to produce the neutral higgs boson via the aforementioned two processes .",
    "if the center of mass energy of the collider is larger than @xmath179 = @xmath180 , then the higgs - strahlung process is viable for the higgs production .",
    "if @xmath5 is still larger than @xmath181 , the higgs - pair production process is also allowed .    in this way we select the kinematically accpetable sets of the parameter values from @xmath182 points in the parameter space .",
    "the selected sets of the parameter values form a subspace within the whole parameter space of the nmssm , which one may conveniently call as the kinematically accpetable parameter space of the nmssm .",
    "the points in the kinematically acceptable space are further classified according to whether the cross section for the higgs production they yield is smaller than 0.1 pb or not .",
    "if @xmath162 is smaller than 0.1 pb , we finally choose the points .",
    "otherwise , we discard them .",
    "the result is roughly an estimate of the fraction of the kinematically acceptable parameter space which can produce the neutral higgs bosons without contradicting the lep2 data at @xmath163 gev .",
    "we may call this subspace of the kinematically acceptable space as the lep2-allowed parameter space of the nmssm .    in order to see the effect of the cp phase @xmath47 on the result , we repeat the procedure for different values of @xmath47 , each time by generating @xmath182 sets of the parameter values . the results are listed in table 1 .",
    "we see that about 44% of the kinematically allowed parameter space should be excluded .",
    "thus , the size of the lep2-allowed parameter space is approximately one half of the kinematically acceptable parameter space .",
    "although the ratio of the excluded part in the case of the maximal cp violation ( @xmath161 ) is larger than those of other values of @xmath47 , the excluded fraction over the parameter space does not significantly depend on the cp phase @xmath47 .",
    "in other words , one may say that in the explicit cp violation scenario the data from lep2 at @xmath163 gev can investigate about 44% for the kinematically acceptable nmssm parameter space .    with the knowledge on the allowed values of the parameters at hand",
    ", we proceed to estimate the mass of the charged higgs boson in more detail .",
    "we generate randomly the values of the relevant parameters to select points in the lep2-allowed space . in this way ,",
    "@xmath182 points are selected .",
    "for each point in the lep2-allowed space , we calculate the mass of the charged higgs boson , and plot it in the ( @xmath183 , @xmath49)-plane .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "4(a ) for @xmath131 ( no cp violation ) , and in fig .",
    "4(b ) for @xmath161 ( maximal cp violation ) . each figure contains the solid , dashed , dotted , and dot - dashed curves ; they correspond to four different values of @xmath175 , 5 , 10 , and 40 .",
    "those curves are actually the boundaries of the plotted points in the ( @xmath183 , @xmath49)-plane . since there are no points plotted in the lower regions of those curves , the curves are clearly the lower bounds on the mass of the charged higgs boson in the nmssm .",
    "there are no curves for smaller values of @xmath49 .",
    "this is because the smaller @xmath49 is excluded , as can be seen in fig .",
    "3 , by the condition of @xmath166 pb , which is the assumed discovery limit for lep2 at @xmath163 gev .    in fig .",
    "4(a ) , we find that minimum values of the lower bound on the charged higgs mass for @xmath184 , 10 , and 5 are about 100 , 95 , and 85 gev , respectively",
    ". if @xmath2 is as small as 2 , the minimum of the lower bound on the charged higgs mass might be almost zero .",
    "this implies that the nmssm may even have a nearly massless charged higgs boson , without contradicting the lep2 data , if the relevant parameters have certain values .",
    "the minimum value of the lower bound on @xmath183 seems to increase sharply as @xmath2 increases .",
    "in addition , the minimum value for @xmath2 rises rapidly as @xmath49 increases . for @xmath185 gev , the charged higgs boson might not have a mass smaller than about 110 gev , regardless of the value of @xmath2 .",
    "the lower bounds for @xmath186 , 10 and 40 are smaller than that for @xmath157 in the range of @xmath185 gev .",
    "the above result is slightly different from , but essentially compatible with , the result of previous analyses [ 20 ] . in case of no cp violation ,",
    "the previous analyses have estimated the lower bound on the charged higgs boson mass is about 70 gev .",
    "this number has been obtained under the assumption that the values of the relevant parameters are such that the mass difference between top scalar quarks are maximal .",
    "we do not assume to impose such constraints on the parameter values .",
    "the parameter values are randomly generated within the lep2-allowed space .",
    "thus , the top scalar quarks may have either maximally different masses or degenerate masses . in this sense",
    ", we may say that our result is more general .    in fig .",
    "4(b ) , we repeat our analysis by substituting the value of @xmath131 by @xmath0 , to investigate the effect of maximal cp violation .",
    "note that , as we assume that at the tree level the cp phase is equal to that at the 1-loop level , the cp violation arise maximally both at the tree level and at the 1-loop level .",
    "the behavior of the curves are basically the same as the case of @xmath131 .",
    "we find that minimum values of the lower bound on the charged higgs mass for @xmath187 is about 110 gev , and nearly stable if @xmath49 is larger than about 100 gev .",
    "the minimum values for @xmath161 are larger than those for @xmath131 , by about 25 , 15 , and 5 gev for @xmath186 , 10 , and 40 , respectively .",
    "these increases may be regarded as the effect of the cp violation .",
    "if @xmath2 is 2 , and if @xmath49 is about 75 gev , there is a narrow possibility that the charged higgs might be massless , without contradicting the lep2 data , even if cp violation is maximal .",
    "then , the minimum value of the lower bound on @xmath183 seems to increase abruptly as @xmath2 increases from 2 upward . for @xmath185 gev",
    ", the charged higgs boson might not have a mass smaller than about 110 gev , regardless of the value of @xmath2 .",
    "in the next - to minimal supersymmetric standard model , we consider the explicit cp violation scenario in its higgs sector and the subsequent phenomenology . we calculate the masses of both the charged higgs boson and the neutral ones at 1-loop level , by taking into account the radiative corrections due to the quarks and scalar - quarks of the third generation within the explicit cp violation scenario . the effective potential at the 1-loop level , as well as the one at the tree level ,",
    "is shown to have the cp violation phase .",
    "it would be absent if the top scalar - quarks are degenerate in mass .    in the whole parameter space of the nmssm",
    "we establish a subspace with two constraints .",
    "the first constraint is that for the values of the relevant parameters in the subspace it is kinematically possible to produce neutral higgs bosons , and the second one is that the cross section for their productions does not exceed 0.1 pb . in this way",
    ", we establish the lep2-allowed parameter space of the nmssm , as we assume the discovery limit of lep2 at @xmath163 gev .",
    "the lower bound on @xmath49 , the vev of the neutral higgs singlet , is found to be about 16 gev .",
    "it is shown to increase to 40 gev as @xmath2 approaches 2 .",
    "we find that the lep2 data do not exclude the possibility of a massless neutral higgs boson .",
    "for the charged higgs boson , we find that the radiative corrections to its mass are negative . for @xmath157",
    ", we find that for certain values of @xmath49 the lower bound on the radiatively corrected mass of the charged higgs boson is as low as zero , whether cp is violated maximally or not at all .",
    "the minimum of the lower bound on the charged higgs boson mass increases as @xmath2 increases .    for larger values of @xmath2 , the minimum value of the lower bound on the charged higgs boson mass for maximal cp violation is found to be larger than the one for no cp violation .",
    "if @xmath49 takes a value between 300 gev and 1000 gev , the lower bound on the mass of the charged higgs boson in the nmssm is about 110 gev , for @xmath188 , whether cp is violated maximally or not at all .",
