    "these qualities can be understood only in terms of quantum mechanical arguments .",
    "consider , for instance , the quantum expression of the atomic kinetic energy for a system of @xmath7 indistinguishable particles with mass @xmath8 : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the planck constant , @xmath11 the ground - state wave function of the system , and @xmath12 denotes expected value .",

    ", in this review we will concentrate on quantum crystals formed by atoms and small molecules .    a quantitative indicator of the degree of quantumness of a system is given by the de boer parameter , @xmath17 ( sevryuk _ et al .",
    "_ , 2010 ) .",
    "this is defined as the ratio of the corresponding de broglie wavelength , @xmath18 , and a typical interatomic distance , @xmath19 , namely : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is an energy scale characterising the interactions between particles .",

    "values were calculated using reported lennard - jones potential parameters for `` rare - gas '' and `` molecular '' solids . in the rest of cases ,",
    "we used reported experimental cohesive energies as @xmath21 s and equilibrium lattice parameters as @xmath19 s . ] the crystals in which quantum nuclear effects ( qne ) are expected to be large , somehow arbitrarily defined here as @xmath22 ( which in the limiting case coincides with graphite ) , are indicated with red dots . as it is observed , most rare gases and light - weight molecular solids , among which we highlight helium , hydrogen , and methane , are quantum crystals .",
    "an important number of quantum specimens also are found in the remnant of solid - state categories like , for instance , metal hydride ( ionic ) , carbon - based ( covalent ) , and alkali metal ( metallic ) compounds .",
    "quantum paraelectrics , although not included in fig .",
    "[ fig : deboer ] , also conform to an intriguing class of quantum crystals .",
    "quantum paraelectrics are materials in which the onset of ferroelectricity , that is , the appearance of a spontaneous and externally switchable electrical polarisation , is suppressed by quantum nuclear fluctuations ( mller and burkard , 1979 ; rytz , hchli , and bilz , 1980 ; conduit and simons , 2010 )",
    ". examples of quantum paraelectrics include srtio@xmath23 and ktao@xmath23 , which normally are classified as complex oxide perovskites ( ohtomo and hwang , 2004 ; cazorla and stengel , 2012 ) .",
    "quantum paraelectrics do not follow the conventional definition of a quantum crystal since they contain heavy atomic species that interact through strong covalent and ionic forces .",
    "actually , the size of qne in these materials should be rather small ( i. e. , @xmath24 ) . at low temperatures , however , quantum paraelectrics are on the verge of a phase transition involving crystal structures with very similar energies and thus the impact of qne in these and other related materials is large ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : matscience ] ) .",
    "the study of quantum solids is very important to understand nature .",
    "hydrogen and helium , for instance , are the most abundant elements in the universe ; they represent the @xmath25  %   of the mass of giant planets in our solar system such as jupiter and saturn ( fortney , 2004 ; baraffe , chabrier , and barman , 2010 ) .",
    "an exhaustive knowledge of their condensed matter phases at extreme thermodynamic conditions is then crucial for understanding the chemical composition and past and future evolution of planetary bodies .",
    "quantum solids are also sought after for technological applications .",
    "rare - gases alloys , for instance , are intensively employed as pressure - transmitting media in high - load compression experiments and synthesis processes , due to their intriguing elastic properties ( errandonea _ et al .",
    "_ , 2006 ; dewaele _ et al .",
    "_ , 2008 ; cazorla , errandonea , and sola 2009 ) .    other examples of scientific fields in which quantum crystals are important include nuclear energy , gas storage , quantum computing , and nanoelectronics",
    "for instance , lithium hydride ( lih ) and deuteride ( lid ) are thoroughly used in the nuclear industry either as shielding agents or fuel in energy reactors ( welch , 1974 ; veleckis , 1977 ) .",
    "metal hydrides are also promising for hydrogen storage applications ( grochala and edwards , 2004 ; shevlin and guo , 2009 ) since they can supply large amounts of gas upon thermodynamic destabilisation .",
    "likewise , carbon - based nanostructures ( e. g. , graphene , nanotubes , and fullerenes ) exhibit large gas uptake capacities ( cazorla , shevlin , and guo , 2011 ; gadipelli , 2015 ; cazorla , 2015 ) as a consequence of their large surface - to - volume ratio , light atomic weight , and great thermodynamic stability . diamonds with negatively charged nitrogen - vacancy centers , another type of carbonaceous nanomaterial , are playing a crucial role on the development of scalable quantum computing components ( fuchs _ et al .",
    "_ , 2011 ; nemoto _ et al .",

    "this class of crystals also can be employed as tunable _ quantum simulators _ that , in analogy to ultracold atom gases trapped in optical lattices ( lewestein _ et al .",
    "_ , 2007 ) , can be used to answer fundamental questions in the fields of condensed matter , biology , and high energy physics ( georgescu _ et al . _ , 2014 ; wang _ et al . _ ,",
    "2015 ) . finally",
    ", quantum paraelectrics find numerous applications in nanoelectronics as varistors , supercapacitor electrodes , and substrates on which to grow epitaxial films of other perovskite compounds ( lawless , 1974 ; schlom _ et al .",
    "_ , 2007 ; cazorla and stengel , 2012 )",
    ".     adopts a value larger than @xmath26 are indicated with red dots . ]    besides of their fundamental and applied interests , quantum crystals are also very important in the framework of development and testing of new theories .",
    "the interactions between particles in quantum crystals typically are of dispersion , hydrogen bond , and multipole - multipole types , which are long - ranged and weak .",
    "the cohesion between atoms in solid helium , for instance , is so weak that to a first approximation this crystal can be described by a system of hard spheres ( kalos , levesque , and verlet , 1974 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the description of long - ranged and very weak interactions poses a serious challenge to some families of first - principles methods ( also known as _ ab initio _ because do not rely on any predetermined knowledge of the atomic forces ) as the analytical expression of the corresponding electronic exchange and correlation energies are intricate and difficult to approximate for computational purposes ( klime and michaelides , 2012 ; cazorla , 2015 ) .",
    "this circumstance converts quantum solids into an ideal playground in which to perform benchmark calculations for assessing the performance of standard and advanced electronic band - structure first - principles methods like , for instance , density functional theory ( dft ) and electronic quantum monte carlo ( eqmc ) [ driver _ et al .",

    "[ subsec : firstprinciples ] ) .",
    "likewise , quantum nuclear effects ( qne ) must be fully accounted for in any study dealing with quantum solids since they may affect noticeably the most fundamental properties of crystals like , for instance , atomic structure , vibrational phonon excitations , magnetic spin order , and electronic energy band gap .",
    "this fact leads to the situation in which approaches describing qne only at a qualitative or approximate level ( e. g. , the debye model and quasi - harmonic approximation ) normally are inadequate for investigating genuine quantum crystals ( see , for instance , morales _",
    "et al . _ , 2013 ; monserrat _ et al . _ , 2014 ; cazorla and boronat , 2015 ) ; instead , full quantum approaches based on the solution to the schrdinger equation or path - integral formulation of quantum mechanics due to feynman ( 1948 ) must be employed ( the fundamentals of these and others quantum simulation techniques will be reviewed in sec .",
    "[ sec : simulation ] ) .      the experimental study of quantum solids was initiated with the solidification of @xmath0he at the kamerlingh onnes laboratories in leiden , by w. h. keesom on june 1926 ( keesom , 1942 ; domb and dugdale , 1957 ) .",
    "it was not until the late 1960 s and early 1970 s , however , that with the establishment of neutron inelastic scattering techniques solid helium started being investigated thoroughly ( klein and venables , 1974 ) .",
    "the aim of those early neutron inelastic scattering experiments ( lipschultz _ et al .",
    "_ , 1967 ; minkiewicz _ et al .",
    "_ , 1968 ) was to understand the phonon dynamics in such a highly anharmonic solid .",
    "actually , harmonic calculations render a mechanically unstable solid ( that is , with imaginary lattice phonon frequencies ) at low densities ( wette and nijboer , 1965 ) , hence it was very appealing to rationalise the real dynamics of the crystal .",
    "an interest on understanding how hydrostatic pressure could modify the physical properties of quantum solids started to develop also at that time ( eckert _ et al .",
    "_ , 1977 ; stassis _ et al .",
    "_ , 1978 ) .",
    "likewise , the initial theoretical efforts were concentrated in finding a theory that could describe correctly the dynamical stability observed in highly anharmonic crystals .",
    "this was accomplished with the development of the self - consistent phonon ( scp ) theory ( koehler , 1966 ; glyde , 1994 ) . in the scp approach",
    ", one essentially assumes an harmonic solid with force constants that best represent the real anharmonic crystal , which are determined on the basis of a variational principle .",
    "we note that in recent years variants of the scp approach have been successfully applied to the study of highly anharmonic metallic , molecular , and superconductor materials , in the context of electronic first - principles calculations ( errea , rousseau , and bergara , 2011 ; errea , calandra , and mauri , 2013 ; errea , calandra , and mauri , 2014 ; monserrat _ et al .",
    "_ , 2014 ; engel , monserrat , and needs , 2015 ; errea , _ et al .",
    "_ , 2015 ) .    in quantum crystals , due to the large excursions of the atoms around the equilibrium positions ,",
    "a good treatment of the short - range correlations is necessary .",
    "the need for considering such microscopic effects , which are beyond the extent of harmonic and quasi - harmonic approaches , led to the development of the variational theory of quantum solids ( nosanow , 1966 ; koehler , 1967 ) .",
    "nosanow proposed a general wave function model for a quantum solid of the form : @xmath27 where @xmath28 are the position vectors defining the equilibrium crystal lattice , @xmath29 the position vectors of the particles , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 and @xmath32 gaussian and two - body correlation factors , respectively .",
    "the second factor in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nosanow ] ) localises each particle around a particular equilibrium lattice site while the first accounts for the interparticle correlations introduced by the atomic interactions .    after mcmillan s and other authors works on liquid @xmath0he ( mcmillan , 1965 ;",
    "schiff and verlet , 1967 ) , the two - body correlation factors in @xmath11 are frequently expressed as @xmath33}$ ] .",
    "this function corresponds to the asymptotic solution of the schrdinger equation in the @xmath34 limit of a two - body problem in which the interparticle interaction is of the lennard - jones type .",
    "with such a relatively simple analytical model of @xmath11 and by employing monte carlo multidimensional integration techniques ( metropolis _ et al .",
    "_ , 1953 ; wood and parker , 1957 ) , it was then possible to perform variational calculations of the ground state of solid helium ( hansen and levesque , 1968 ) and other quantum solids ( hansen , 1968 ; bruce , 1972 ) .",
    "these advancements set the foundations of the variational monte carlo ( vmc ) method as applied to the study of quantum solids ( see sec .",
    "[ subsub : approxzerot ] ) .    despite that variational approaches may be very insightful from a physical point of view , they rarely provide the exact quantitative answer in realistic problems . in order to obtain the precise solution to a quantum many - body problem one , for instance , may deal explicitly with the corresponding schrdinger equation . to this end , more sophisticated techniques than vmc , albeit related , were developed during the 1970s , among which we highlight the green s function monte carlo ( gfmc ) method due to kalos and co - workers ( kalos , 1962 ; kalos , levesque , and verlet , 1974 ; ceperley _ et al . _ , 1976 ; whitlock and kalos , 1979 ; whitlock _ et al .",
    "_ , 1979 ; schmidt and kalos , 1984 ) .",
    "the basic idea behind gfmc is to employ monte carlo sampling techniques to solve the time - independent schrdinger equation of a many - body system , when that is expressed as an integral equation containing a green s function .",
    "although the exact form of the green s function normally is not known , this can be reproduced with stochastic sampling techniques involving probability distribution functions that are generated with the help of trotter s product formula ( trotter , 1959 ) [ see sec .",
    "[ subsub : dmc ] ] .    an intimately related method to gfmc is diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) , in which the imaginary time - dependent schrdinger equation , rather than the time - independent , is integrated by using a analytical short - time approximation to the green s function ( ceperley and alder , 1980 ; reynolds _ et al .",
    "_ , 1982 ; guardiola , 1986 ; hammond _ et al . _ , 1994 ) .",
    "both gfmc and dmc are _ exact _ ground - state methods , in the sense that provide results for the energy that in principle are affected only by statistical errors .",
    "these two methods belong to the family known as `` projection techniques '' , in which a projector operator is iteratively applied in order to cast out the ground state of the targeted quantum many - body system [ in this latter category we also find , for instance , the reptation monte carlo method due to baroni and moroni ( 1999 ) ] . nonetheless , the dmc method is more efficient in dealing with arbitrary boundary conditions and potential energy functions ( anderson , 2002 ) , hence the use of gfmc is very infrequent nowadays . in sec .",
    "[ subsub : dmc ] , we will review the fundamentals of the dmc method as applied to the study of quantum bosonic crystals .",
    "quantum nuclear effects are also crucial to understand quantum solids at finite temperature ( i. e. , @xmath35 ) .",
    "the threshold temperature below which qne are important can be considered to be equal to the debye temperature @xmath36 ( born and huang , 1954 ) .",
    "@xmath36 is defined as @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the largest vibrational frequency in the crystal ( that is , at @xmath39 all phonon modes in the solid are excited ) .",
    "this threshold temperature can be obtained directly from neutron inelastic scattering or specific heat measurements , and in the particular case of rare - gases @xmath36 ranges from @xmath40 to @xmath41  k. it is important to note that @xmath36 can increase dramatically under the application of external pressure , hence making unavoidable the consideration of qne in the study of highly compressed quantum crystals . in molecular hydrogen , for instance , the debye temperature at normal pressure conditions amounts to @xmath42  k whereas at @xmath43  gpa turns out to be @xmath44  k ( diatschenko _ et al .",
    "_ , 1985 ) .",
    "the theoretical method of choice for simulation of quantum solids at @xmath45 is path - integral monte carlo ( pimc ) .",
    "the pimc method is based on feynman s formulation of non - relativistic quantum mechanics , which can be thought of as a generalisation of the action principle of classical mechanics ( feynman , 1948 ; feynman and hibbs , 1965 ) . in feynman s path",
    "integral theory , however , a functional integral over an infinity of possible trajectories ( that is , a path integral ) replaces the notion of probability amplitude . from a computational perspective ,",
    "feynman s formalism allows one to map out the atomic quantum system of interest onto a classical model of interacting polymers that evolve in imaginary time .",
    "this idea , which is known as the `` classical isomorphism '' ( feynman , 1972 ; barker , 1979 ; chandler and wolynes , 1981 ; ceperley , 1995 ) , makes it possible to sample the corresponding space of possible configurations with stochastic techniques , laying the foundations of the pimc method .",
    "pimc relies exclusively on the knowledge of the many - body hamiltonian and , in contrast to other simulation techniques like for instance gfmc and dmc , does not comprise the use of projector operators ( this method will be explained in detail in sec .",
    "[ subsub : pimc ] ) .",
    "interestingly , the pimc approach can be generalised to zero - temperature calculations by exploiting the formal similarities between imaginary time propagators and thermal density matrices ( sarsa _ et al .",
    "_ , 2000 ) .",
    "this methodological extension is named path - integral ground state ( pigs ) and will be reviewed in sec .",
    "[ subsub : pigs ] .",
    "the isomorphism between classical and quantum systems also allows to employ molecular dynamics simulation techniques for sampling of path integrals ( chakravarty , 1997 ; tuckerman and hughes , 1998 ) . in this last framework ,",
    "generally known as path - integral molecular dynamics ( pimd ) , the atoms are treated as distinguisable particles .",
    "consequently , genuine quantum statistical effects , that in liquids and disordered systems at low temperatures may give rise to intriguing quantum phenomena like bose - einstein condensation and superfluidity , are neglected .",
    "nonetheless , in situations in which atomic quantum exchanges are not relevant ( i. e. , high temperatures ) pimd becomes a very powerful method that can be used , for instance , to compute quantum time - correlation functions and transition state rates very efficiently ( gillan , 1990 ; habershon _ et al .",
    "_ , 2013 ; herrero and ramrez , 2014 ) .",
    "recently , an alternative to path - integral quantum simulation approaches has been proposed that relies on the combined action of `` quantum thermal baths '' ( qtb ) and molecular dynamics ( wang , 2007 ; buyukdagli _ et al .",
    "_ , 2008 ; dammak _ et al .",
    "_ , 2009 ; hernndez - rojas , calvo , and gonzlez - noya , 2015 ) . in the qtb formalism , the dynamics of the system is governed by a langevin - type equation including dissipative and gaussian random forces that mimics the power spectral density given by the quantum fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( callen and welton , 1951 ) .",
    "although quantum statistical effects are also neglected in qtb approaches , these methods are becoming increasingly more popular in the last years due to their reduced computational expense as compared to path - integral based techniques .",
    "meanwhile , hybrid pimd and qtb schemes have been developed recently that exhibit improved convergence and scalability as compared to pimd ( ceriotti , bussi , and parrinello , 2009 ; ceriotti , manolopoulos , and parrinello , 2011 ; ceriotti and manolopoulos , 2012 ; brieuc , dammak , and hayoun , 2016 ) . in sec .",
    "[ subsec : finitet ] , we shall provide a brief introduction to these emergent quantum simulation techniques .",
    "let us take a deeper look into the main differences between classical and quantum solids in the zero - temperature limit ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : qvsc ] ) . atoms in a classical solid remain practically immobile on the positions of the periodic arrangement that minimises their potential energy ( i. e. , @xmath46 ) , whereas in a quantum solid particles remain loosely localised around those sites ( i. e. , @xmath47 ) . as a consequence ,",
    "large lindemann ratios ( i. e. , @xmath48 , where @xmath49 represents the atomic mean squared displacement and @xmath50 the lattice parameter ) of the order of @xmath51 are observed in the latter case .",
    "also , the radial pair distribution function , @xmath31 ( i. e. , the average number density at a distance @xmath52 from an atom divided by the overall particle density ) , presents different features in the two types of crystals . in the zero - temperature limit",
    ", the @xmath31 of a classical solid exhibits a series of sharp peaks signaling the radial distances between crystal lattice sites .",
    "by contrast , in a quantum solid @xmath31 is continuous and displays a pattern of peaks - and - valleys that oscillates around unity at large distances ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : qvsc]a ) .",
    "likewise , the structure factor in a quantum solid , which is related to the fourier transform of @xmath31 , presents some broadening and depletion of the main scattering amplitudes as compared to that in a classical solid ( whitlock _ et al .",
    "_ , 1979 ; draeger and ceperley , 2000 ) .    a further difference between quantum and classical crystals is provided by the momentum distribution , @xmath53 . in classical solids",
    ", @xmath53 is always ( that is , independently of the interactions between the atoms ) equal to the maxwell - boltzmann distribution : @xmath54}~ ,   \\label{eq : maxboltz}\\ ] ] where by the equipartition theorem @xmath55 . in quantum solids",
    ", however , the momenta and positions of the atoms are not independent and consequently @xmath53 may depart significantly from @xmath56 . in solid @xmath0he , for instance , @xmath53 is non - gaussian as it has a larger occupation of low momentum states as compared to a maxwell - boltzmann distribution ( diallo _ et al .",
    "_ , 2004 ; rota and boronat , 2011 ) .",
    "the atomic momentum distribution of condensed matter systems can be measured by inelastic neutron scattering performed at high momentum transfer ( glyde , 1994 ; diallo _ et al .",
    "_ , 2007 ) . in this case",
    ", the compton profile of the longitudinal momentum distribution , @xmath57 , is the quantity that is directly measured , that in the impulse approximation is related to @xmath53 through the expression ( withers and glyde , 2007 ) : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a scaling variable .",
    "compton profile experiments can provide a wealth of information about the nature of quantum solids ( glyde , 1994 ) .",
    "for instance , recent neutron scattering measurements have found that the atomic kinetic energy in solid helium at @xmath60 amounts to @xmath61  k ( the number within parentheses represents the accompanying uncertainty ) [ diallo _ et al . _ , 2007 ] , which is in very good agreement with quantum monte carlo estimations ( ceperley _ et al .",

    "( c )  compton profile of the longitudinal momentum distribution , @xmath57 . ]",
    "kinetic isotopic effects , which attribute different kinetic energies to the isotopes of a same chemical element [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : kinetice ] ) ] , are indicators of the existence of qne .",
    "the magnitude of these effects can be inferred from inspection of functions @xmath31 and @xmath53 ( mao and hemley , 1994 ; boninsegni _ et al .",
    "_ , 1994 ; cazorla and boronat , 2005 ) .",
    "for instance , narrowing  ( widening ) of the peaks in @xmath31 may be caused by the presence of heavier  ( lighter ) species .",
    "kinetic isotopic effects can also manifest in the thermal expansion of quantum solids ( pamuk _ et al .",
    "_ , 2012 ; herrero and ramrez , 2011a ) and corresponding @xmath62 boundaries delimiting the thermodynamic stability regions of different phases ( lorenzana , silvera , and goettel , 1990 ; goncharov , hemley , and mao , 2011 ) .    in quantum mechanics , atoms of a same species are indistinguishable , that is , they can exchange positions while leaving the configuration of the system ( namely , the square of the wave function ) invariant .",
    "these atomic exchanges can occur as pairwise interchanges , three - particle , four - particle , and so on cyclic permutations .",
    "when the particles involved in such permutations are bosons and their number grows to infinity , the system becomes superfluid and the atoms on it can flow coherently without any resistance ( feynman , 1972 ; ceperley , 1995 ) . in quantum solids , as opposed to classical crystals , atoms can swap their positions and further delocalise in configurational space ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : qvsc]b for a schematic representation ) .",
    "an illustrative example of this class of qne is given by solid @xmath63he .",
    "@xmath63he atoms , which are fermions , have a non - zero magnetic moment and at low pressure the stable phase is a cubic bcc crystal . at temperatures below @xmath64",
    "mk , this system adopts an exotic magnetic order that consists of two planes of up spins followed by two planes of down spins ( roger , hetherington , and delrieu , 1983 ) . in terms of classical interaction arguments ,",
    "that is , if only nearest - neighbor pair exchanges were important , the magnetic order in this crystal should be antiferromagnetic .",
    "however , quantum exchanges between more than two @xmath63he atoms are very frequent and as a result a strong competition between ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism appears in the crystal that leads to the observed magnetic order ( ceperley , 1995 ) .",
    "it has been theoretically shown that in _ commensurate _",
    "@xmath0he crystals ( i. e. , crystals with exactly two atoms per hcp unit cell , without any point or line defects such as vacancies , dislocations , or grain boundaries ) typical cyclic permutations occurring at few tenths of k only involve a small number of atoms .",
    "consequently , the superfluid density in perfect quantum solids is null ( ceperley and bernu , 2004 ; bernu and ceperley , 2005 ; boninsegni , prokofev , and svistunov , 2006b ) .",
    "this conclusion appears to be consistent with the results of most recent and conclusive torsional oscillator experiments performed by kim and chan ( 2012 , 2014 ) .",
    "meanwhile , in the presence of crystalline defects or atomic disorder quantum monte carlo calculations agree in predicting that the length of ring quantum exchanges increases noticeably , and thus the possibility of realising superfluidity starts to depart from zero ( boninsegni , prokofev , and svistunov , 2006b ; boninsegni _ et al .",
    "_ , 2007 ; rota and boronat , 2012 ) .",
    "we must note , however , that convincing experimental evidence of superfluid - like manifestations in quantum crystals are yet elusive ( chan _ et al .",

    "we will discuss these topics in more detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : defects ] .",
    "although a lot is already known on the physics of quantum crystals , there are still few puzzling and controversial aspects that urge for an improved understanding .",
    "one of these aspects is related to the interactions between different types of crystalline defects , their formation energy , and transport properties . in a seminal work , day and beamish ( 2007 ) reported the experimental dependence of the shear modulus , @xmath65 , in solid @xmath0he as a function of temperature .",
    "they found that @xmath65 increased with decreasing @xmath66 below a certain temperature of @xmath67  k. the observed increase in stiffness was rationalised in terms of line defects mobility : below a particular temperature threshold the dislocations present in the crystal could be pinned by @xmath63he impurities , in spite of the incredibly small concentration of the latter ( i. e. , just @xmath68 parts per billion of @xmath0he atoms ) .",

    "an arbitrary antisymmetric wave function , @xmath287 , can always be expressed as a linear combination of two positive functions like : @xmath288 as both @xmath289 and @xmath290 are positively defined , each one can be interpreted as a probability density and be propagated individually .",
    "a convenient definition of @xmath291 at @xmath292 is : @xmath293 since at large imaginary time the corresponding projected states are : @xmath294 where @xmath295 and @xmath296 are the ground - state fermion and boson wave functions of the hamiltonian , respectively .",
    "@xmath287 consistently renders the ground - state energy of the fermionic system , namely : @xmath297 however , since the @xmath298 energy difference is always positive , the bosonic parts in @xmath291 grow exponentially with imaginary time ( see eq .",

    "the most widely used @xmath285 model is the slater - jastrow wave function , that is expressed as : @xmath300 where @xmath301 and @xmath302 represent the space and spin coordinates of electron @xmath111 , @xmath303 is the jastrow factor , @xmath304 are coefficients , and @xmath305 slater determinants of single - particle orbitals of the form : @xmath306 the orbitals @xmath307 often are obtained from dft or hartree - fock calculations , and are assumed to be products of factors that depend either on the space or spin coordinates .",
    "it is common practice in eqmc calculations to replace @xmath308 with products of separate up- and down - spin determinants , since this improves computational efficiency ( foulkes _ et al .",
    "_ , 2001 ) .    the jastrow factor in eq",
    "( [ eq : sjwf ] ) normally contains one and two - body terms , namely : @xmath309 where functions @xmath310 describe the electron - electron correlations and @xmath311 the electron - nuclear correlations .",
    "the two - electron terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : jastrowfacele ] ) reduce the value of the wave function whenever two electrons approach each to the other , hence reducing the repulsive electron - electron interaction energy .",
    "however , the introduction of @xmath310 terms also has the unwanted effect of pushing electrons away from regions of high - charge density into regions of low - charge density , thus depleting the electronic density in the atomic bonds . by introducing the one - body functions @xmath311 in the jastrow factor this problem",
    "is overcome .",
    "another approach that can be employed to improve the description of electron - electron correlations is to consider backflow correlations within the slater determinants .",
    "backflow correlations were originally derived from a current conservation argument due to feynman and cohen ( 1956 ) to provide a picture of excitations in liquid @xmath0he ; they represent the characteristic flow pattern in a quantum fluid where particles in front of a moving one go on filling the space left behind it .",
    "the introduction of backflow correlations may relax in a practical way the constraints associated to the fixed - node approximation . for instance , it has been demonstrated that the use of backflow wave functions in homogeneous electron systems reduces significantly the corresponding vmc and dmc energies ( kwon , ceperley , and martin , 1993 ; kwon , ceperley , and martin , 1998 ; lpez - ros _ et al .",

    "a pending challenge in dft methods , however , is posed by the difficulties encountered in the reproduction of many - body and coulomb screening effects .",
    "this type of shortcomings stems from the pairwise additivity that is assumed in the construction of most dft functionals .",
    "essentially , the interaction energy between two atoms completely neglects the effects introduced by the medium that separates them ( misquitta _ et al . _ , 2010 ; tkatchenko , alf , and kim , 2012 ; gobre and tkatchenko , 2013 ) . in this context",
    ", the adiabatic connection fluctuation - dissipation theorem has been exploited to calculate correlation dft energies that incorporate many - body terms beyond pairwise .",
    "this is the case of the random phase approximation to dft ( dobson , white , and rubio , 2006 ) and dft+mbd methods ( ruiz _ et al .",
    "_ , 2012 ; tkatchenko _ et al .",
    "_ , 2012 ; ambrosetti _ et al .",
    "_ , 2014 ) , which at the moment are receiving the highest attention . in the latest dft+mbd versions , for instance",
    ", the schrdinger equation of a set of fluctuating and interacting quantum harmonic oscillators is solved directly within the dipole approximation , and the resulting many - body energy is coupled to an approximate semilocal dft functional ( tkatchenko _ et al .",
    "_ , 2012 ; ambrosetti _ et al .",
    "_ , 2014 ) .",
    "many - body dft - based methods , however , are still in their infancy and the associated computational expenses are elevated , hence their applicability yet is limited .",
    "electronic qmc methods , on the other hand , are inherently exact as they account for any type of electronic correlation , exchange , or many - body screening effect ( although they are affected by the `` sign problem '' explained in previous sections ) .",
    "a further advantage of using eqmc methods is that it is possible to treat the zero - point motion of the nuclei beyond the born - oppenheimer approximation , that is , considering non - adiabatic effects ( ceperley and alder , 1987 ; tubman _ et al .",
    "_ , 2014 ; yang _ et al . _ , 2015 ) .",
    "this can be done by using wave functions that explicitly depend on both the electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom in projector mc schemes ( e. g. , dmc and gfmc ) .",
    "another interesting feature of eqmc , in contraposition to dft methods , is that in the case of light atoms the use of pseudopotentials can be avoided ; this aspect is specially desirable for the study of quatum solids like h@xmath1 and @xmath0he , since core electrons then can be simulated without any constraints ( morales , pierleoni , and ceperely , 2009 ; morales _ et al .",
    "_ , 2013 ) .    on the down side , eqmc methods present some technical difficulties that are absent in dft calculations",
    "for instance , the periodic ewald sum that is used to estimate the electron - electron interactions introduces a finite - size error in the exchange - correlation energy , since it depends on the size and shape of the simulation cell ( foulkes _ et al .",
    "_ , 2001 ) . consequently , the use of either increasingly large simulation cells or effective correction schemes ( fraser _ et al . _ , 1996 ; hood _ et al . _ , 1997 ; chiesa _ et al .",
    "_ , 2006 ) is necessary to guarantee proper convergence . for a detailed description of finite - size errors treatment in eqmc methods we refer the interested reader to the recent and specialised articles by drummond__et al . _ _ ( 2008 ) , ma , zhang , and krakauer ( 2011 ) , and holzmann _ et al . _",
    "another intricacy is found in the calculation of the atomic forces .",
    "calculating forces using a stochastic algorithm turns out to be very difficult because straightforward derivation of the total energy with respect to the atomic positions , as it follows from the hellmann - feynman principle , leads to estimators with very large variances .",
    "correlated sampling techniques have been proposed to make the statistical errors in the relative energy of different geometries much smaller than the errors in the separate energies ( filippi and umrigar , 2000 ) .",
    "finite difference methods , however , become already impractical when considering systems containing a few tens of atoms .",
    "alternative approaches based on `` zero - variance '' hellmann - feynman estimators ( assaraf and caffarel , 2000 ; chiesa , ceperley , and zhang , 2005 ; per , russo , and snook , 2008 ; clay iii _",
    "et al . _ , 2016 ) and sampling of `` pure '' probability distributions ( badinski _ et al . _ , 2010 ) have been introduced more recently ; nevertheless , the central problem of calculating accurate forces in extended systems efficiently yet remains .",
    "the great accuracy of eqmc methods neither comes free of cost .",
    "although the scaling with respect to the number of electrons is the same than in dft methods , namely @xmath312 in standard cases , the pre - factors in eqmc are considerably larger ( e. g. , roughly @xmath313 and @xmath314 times larger in vmc and dmc , respectively ; foulkes _ et al .",
    "_ , 2001 ; towler , 2006 ) .",
    "also , the convergence of the total energy is achieved more slowly than in dft due to the usual mc propagation and sampling procedures . in spite of this , thanks to the escalating increase in computing efficiency and recent algorithmic advances , the use of eqmc methods is transitioning from that of benchmark calculations in few - atoms systems to that of production runs in hundreds - of - atoms systems ( kim _ et al . _ , 2012 ; esler _ et al .",
    "_ , 2012 ; wagner , 2014 ) .",
    "actually , efficient qmc - based methods have been already developed that allow to simulate both the electrons and nuclei in crystals quantum mechanically ( grossman and mitas , 2005 ; wagner and grossman , 2010 ) . among those , we highlight the coupled electron - ion monte carlo method due to pierleoni , ceperley , and collaborators ( pierleoni , ceperley , and holzmann , 2004 ; pierleoni and ceperley , 2005 ; pierleoni and ceperley , 2006 ) , for its special relevance to the field of quantum solids ( see , for instance , sec .  [",
    "subsec : h2extreme ] ) . in view of this progress",
    ", we foresee that in the next years the use of eqmc techniques will become more popular within the community of computational condensed matter scientists .      using first - principles methods to describe the interactions between atoms in quantum crystals normally requires intensive computational resources .",
    "fortunately , the interactions between particles sometimes are so _ simple _ that they can be approximated with analytical functions known as classical interatomic potentials or force fields . in those particular cases",
    "one can concentrate in solving the quantum mechanical equations for the nuclear degrees of freedom only , hence accelerating the calculations dramatically .",
    "classical interaction models are constructed by following physical knowledge and intuition ; they normally contain a set of parameters that are adjusted to reproduce experimental or _",
    "ab initio _ data .",
    "the force matching method due to ercolessi and adams ( 1994 ) , for instance , is a well - established force field fitting technique that is widely employed in computational physics and materials science ( masia , gurdia , and nicolini , 2014 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the ways in which classical interatomic potentials are constructed are neither straightforward nor uniquely defined , and the thermodynamic intervals over which they remain reliable are not known _ a priori_.    in situations where the use of first - principles methods is prohibitive and the available classical potentials are not versatile enough to reproduce the physical phenomena of interest , machine learning techniques can be very useful .",
    "machine learning ( ml ) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that exploits the systematic identification of correlation in data sets , to make predictions and analysis ( behler , 2010 ; rupp , 2015 ) .",
    "effective potentials resulting from ml are not built on physically motivated functional forms but obtained from purely mathematical fitting techniques that reproduce a set of reference data as closely as possible .",
    "some of these fitting procedures strongly rely on the concept of artificial neural networks , which can `` learn '' the topology of a potential - energy surface from a set of reference points .",
    "ml techniques are common tools in mathematics and computer science , and are starting to be applied with confidence in chemistry ( raghunathan _ et al .",
    "_ , 2015 ) and physics ( manzhos , yamashita , and carrington , 2009 ; li , kermode , and de vita , 2015 ) .",
    "the interactions between atoms in quantum solids have been traditionally modeled with two - body potentials .",
    "the most popular of all them is the lennard - jones ( lj ) potential , which is expressed as : @xmath315~ , \\label{eq : lj}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 and @xmath251 are free parameters , and @xmath52 is the distance between two particles . the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lj ] ) represents repulsive short - ranged electrostatic and pauli - like interactions acting between electrons ; the second term represents the attractive long - ranged van der waals interactions resulting from instantaneous electronic dipoles . in spite of its simplicity",
    ", the lj potential has been used in the study of condensed matter systems with great success ; it was the first interaction model to be systematically employed in variational monte carlo simulations of quantum solids ( hansen and levesque , 1968 ; hansen , 1968 ; bruce , 1972 ) .",
    "the lj potential is convenient also for simulating atomic systems composed of several chemical species for which the corresponding @xmath251 s and @xmath21 s are already known ; the resulting crossed interactions then can be approximated to a good extent with the lj parameters given by the lorentz - berthelot rules : @xmath316 and @xmath317 .",
    "when two atoms are brought together , however , the value of the repulsive lj term in general increases too rapidly . in quantum solids particles can be close to each other due to their zero point motion , hence an accurate description of the atomic interactions at short distances is necessary even at low densities ( ceperley and partridge , 1986 ; boronat and casulleras , 1994 ) . in this context , the pairwise interaction model originally proposed by ahlrichs , penco and scoles ( 1977 ) is more appropriate since it reproduces _ ab initio",
    "_ results for the repulsive interactions between closed shell atoms ( hepburn , scoles , and penco , 1975 ) .",
    "the form of this potential is : @xmath318 where @xmath319 , @xmath50 , @xmath320 , and @xmath321 are free parameters , and @xmath32 is an exponential damping function that is introduced to avoid the divergence of the @xmath322 terms at small distances .",
    "aziz and collaborators worked extensively in this model to deliver an accurate description of the atomic interactions in many rare - gas systems ( aziz _ et al .",
    "_ , 1979 ; aziz , meath , and allnatt , 1983 ; aziz , mccourt , and wong , 1989 ) , hence the notation employed .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : aziz ] ) also yields an improved description of the long - range dispersion forces as compared to the lj model , since it contains several types of multi - pole interactions .    in some situations ,",
    "a well balanced description of solids can not be attained with pairwise potentials only .",
    "this is the case , for instance , of crystals at extreme thermodynamic conditions ( loubeyre , 1987 ; cazorla and boronat , 2008a ; cazorla and errandonea , 2014 ; cazorla and boronat , 2015b ) . a possible solution to overcome this modeling difficulty is to go beyond pairwise additivity , that is , to consider higher order terms in the approximation to the atomic interactions .",
    "several three - body interatomic potentials have been proposed in the literature ( axilrod and teller , 1943 ; cencek , patkowski , and szalewicz , 2009 ) , and the most popular in the context of quantum solids is ( bruch and mcgee , 1973 ) : @xmath323 where @xmath324 , @xmath325 , @xmath326 are free parameters , @xmath327 the distance between particles in a trimer , and @xmath328 the corresponding interior angles .",
    "@xmath329 is an interatomic potential that renders triple dipole and exchange interactions ; inclusion of this type of forces appears to be necessary for obtaining a realistic description of the energy and elastic properties of very dense quantum solids ( grimsditch , loubeyre , and polian , 1986 ; pechenik , kelson , and makov , 2008 ; cazorla and boronat , 2015b ) .",
    "when calculations are performed in a series of similar systems or a number of configurations involving a same system , the results contain redundant information .",
    "one example is to run a molecular dynamics simulation in which the total internal energy and atomic forces are calculated at each time step ; after a sufficiently long time , points which are close in configurational space and have similar energies are visited during the sampling of the potential - energy surface .",
    "such a redundancy can be exploited to perform computationally intensive calculations ( that is , of first - principles type ) only in few selected configurations and to use machine learning ( ml ) to interpolate between those , obtaining so approximate solutions for the remaining of configurations ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ml ] ) .",
    "the success of this approach depends on a balance between incurred errors due to interpolation and invested computational effort .",
    "ml modeling tools can provide both the energy and atomic forces directly from the atomic positions , hence they can be regarded as a particular class of atomistic potentials .",
    "ml potentials , however , rely on very flexible analytic functions rather than on physically motivated functionals .",
    "promising analytic approaches that have been recently proposed to construct ml potentials include permutation invariant polynomials ( brown _ et al . _ , 2003 ) , the modified shepard method using taylor expansions ( bowman , czak , and fu , 2011 ) , gaussian processes ( bartk _ et al .",

    "_ , 2007 ) , and artificial neural networks ( lorenz , gro , and scheffler , 2004 ) .",
    "artificial neural networks , for instance , have been demonstrated to be `` universal approximators '' ( behler , 2015 ) since they allow to approximate unknown multidimensional functions to within arbitrary accuracy given a set of known function values .    to the best of our knowledge ,",

    "in view of the importance of qne on the elastic properties of quantum crystals at low pressures ( see previous section ) , such a good agreement could be explained in terms of ( i )  a systematic error cancellation involving the disregard of qne , on one hand , and an inaccurate description of the system provided by standard dft functionals , on the other , or ( ii )  a steady diminishing of the importance of qne on elasticity as pressure is increased .    to the best of our knowledge , there are not fully _ ab initio _ studies ( i. e. , works in which both the electronic and ionic degrees of freedom are described with quantum mechanical methods ) on the elastic properties of highly compressed quantum crystals .",
    "the reason for this is likely to be the large computational expense involved in the calculation of partition function derivatives or the stress - tensor with sufficient accuracy ( schffel and mser , 2001 ; pe@xmath92a - ardila , vitiello , and de koning , 2011 ) . on the other hand , the semi - empirical two - body potentials that at low pressures describe the interactions between atoms in quantum crystals correctly , become unreliable at high pressures ( see sec .",

    "in addition to this , pairwise interaction models are in general not well suited for the study of elasticity in very dense crystals since they inevitably lead to zero values of the cauchy relations ( wallace , 1972 ; pechenik , kelson , and makov , 2008 ) , which is in contrast to the observations ( zha , mao , and hemley , 2004 ) .",
    "an estimation of the importance of qne in the elasticity of quantum crystals using such unrealistic interatomic potentials , therefore , could be misleading .",

    "interestingly , cazorla and boronat ( 2015b ) have found that the role of qne on helium elastic constants becomes secondary at very large densities .",
    "for instance , the inclusion of qne makes the value of the shear modulus , @xmath404 , to decrease by less than @xmath363  % at a pressure of @xmath416  gpa ( to be compared with @xmath407  % found near equilibrium conditions ) .",
    "this conclusion appears to be consistent with the results of a recent pimc study performed by landinez - borda , cai , and de koning ( 2014 ) , in which the ideal shear strength on the basal plane of solid helium ( that is , the maximum stress that the crystal can resist without yielding irreversibly ) has been found to behave quite similarly to that in classical hcp solids .",
    "consequently , it can be expected that by treating qne with approximate methods ( e. g. , the debye model or quasi - harmonic approximations ) one can obtain a reasonably good description of elasticity in quantum solids at high pressures .",
    "it will be very interesting to test whether this is also valid in quantum molecular crystals , the elastic properties of which remain largely unexplored at high densities .",
    "a crystal is characterised by a periodic arrangement of atoms or molecules defined by an unit cell . the regular pattern in a solid , however , normally is interrupted by crystalline defects , which can be classified into point , line , and planar types .",
    "point defects occur only at or around one lattice site , and typical examples include vacancies , impurities , and interstitials ( kittel , 2005 ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : crystal - defects ] ) .",
    "line defects entail entire rows of atoms that are misaligned with respect to the others ; common examples of line defects are dislocations , which in turn are classified into `` edge '' and `` screw '' ( bulatov and cai , 2006 ; hull and bacon , 2011 ) .",
    "an edge dislocation , for instance , is created by introducing an extra half - plane of atoms in mid - way through the crystal ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : crystal - defects ] ) .",
    "planar defects can occur in single crystals or in the boundaries between single crystals , and include grain and twin boundaries , steps , and stacking faults ( kittel , 2005 ) .",
    "the study of crystalline defects is very important since these can affect considerably the mechanical , electrical , structural , and adsorption properties of materials .",
    "dislocations , for example , are key to understand the microscopic origins of plasticity , that is , the regime in which mechanical deformations in a crystal become non - reversible ( kosevich , 2005 ) .    in @xmath417 ,",
    "andreev and lifshitz proposed that a state of matter in which crystalline order and bose - einstein condensation coexisted could occur in a quantum crystal , the so - called supersolid .",
    "for this supersolid to exist , the presence of crystal vacancies was a necessary condition . at that time",
    "some experimentalists got attracted by the possibility of realising such an exotic state of matter , and several mass flow and torsional oscillator experiments were carried out in solid @xmath0he at ultra - low temperatures . in all those experiments , however , no evidence for a supersolid state was found .",
    "several decades later , a renewed interest in supersolids blossomed after the torsional oscillator experiments performed by kim and chan ( 2004a , 2004b ) . in their experiments , kim and",
    "chan observed a shift in the period of the torsional oscillator in solid helium as the temperature was lowered below @xmath51  k. this sign was interpreted as the mass decoupling between the normal and superfluid fractions in the crystal .",
    "meanwhile , few years later day and beamish ( 2007 ) measured the shear modulus in solid helium and found a striking resemblance with the temperature dependence of the oscillation period reported by kim and chan : the shear modulus increased as the temperature was lowered below @xmath51  k. day and beamish attributed that increase in stiffness to the temperature dependence of the mobility of dislocations in the solid , which could be pinned by static @xmath63he impurities . day and",
    "beamish s findings motivated a series of subsequent theoretical and experimental studies which have demonstrated that a change in the moment of inertia of the experimental torsional cell can be correlated to a change in the structure of the solid inside of it ( reppy , 2010 ; maris , 2012 ; shin _ et al .",

    "in 2012 , kim and chan completely redesigned their torsional oscillator setup making it stiffer , and the original mass - decoupling signal disappeared to within the experimental errors ( see also , kim and chan , 2014 ) .",

    "both experiments and theory agree in that the vacancy formation enthalpy , @xmath418 , in solid @xmath0he at ultra - low temperatures amounts to @xmath419  k ( fraass , granfors , and simmons , 1989 ; galli and reatto , 2004 ; lutsyshyn _ et al . _ , 2010 ) .",
    "the general understanding then is that vacancies can not be activated thermally in this crystal at temperatures as low as @xmath420  k. in fact , the classical equilibrium concentration of vacancies in a crystal is given by the expression @xmath421 , where @xmath422 is the gibbs free energy difference between the perfect and incommensurate ( that is , defective ) system .",
    "@xmath422 is equal to @xmath423 , where @xmath424 is the entropy change induced by the presence of vacancies . in turn",
    ", @xmath424 can be estimated as the sum of a vibrational and a configurational contribution .",
    "the vibrational contribution corresponds to the variation of the lattice phonon frequencies as a result of the local relaxation occurring around the vacancy ; in the limit of very small @xmath425 , this contribution can be safely neglected .",
    "the configurational entropy stems from the equivalency between lattice sites when creating a vacancy ; this contribution is @xmath426 and can not be disregarded in the @xmath427 limit . by neglecting vibrational contributions to @xmath422 and substituting the value of @xmath428 in @xmath429 , one has that the classical equilibrium concentration of vacancies in a crystal is : @xmath430 in the case of solid @xmath0he at @xmath69  k , for instance , it follows that @xmath431",
    "when considering @xmath432  k. in fact , such a classical equilibrium concentration of vacancies is so extremely small that in principle it is physically irrelevant .",
    "interestingly , rossi _",
    "( 2008 ) and pessoa , de koning , and vitiello ( 2009a , 2009b ) have recently estimated , by using a reversible - work approach that exploits a quantum - classical isomorphism , that the zero - point vacancy concentration in solid @xmath0he is @xmath433 . actually , this result is many orders of magnitude larger than the classical result obtained with eq .",
    "( [ eq : xvclass ] ) , and it follows from assuming that the crystal is correctly described with a shadow wave function ( vitiello , runge , and kalos , 1988 ; macfarland _ et al .",
    "_ , 1994 ) .",
    "an hypothetical equilibrium vacancy concentration of @xmath434 , although probably still is not experimentally detectable , would start being relevant to understand the physical behavior of defective solid @xmath0he . nevertheless , since rossi and vitiello s estimations ultimately rely on a variational model the large @xmath435 difference can not be rigorously ascribed to the quantum nature of the crystal .",
    "even when assuming that the equilibrium concentration of vacancies in solid helium is practically null , it can not be discarded that in the process of growing a crystal from the liquid phase a small concentration of point defects is created .",
    "a possible question to answer next then is : do vacancies in a quantum crystal clusterise or keep dispersed ? if vacancies clusterised , then they would segregate from the perfect system and become irrelevant . on the contrary ,",
    "if vacancies remained separated , they could affect the general properties of the quantum crystal quite noticeably ( rota _ et al .",
    "_ , 2012 ) .",
    "unfortunately , there is not a general consensus between theorists about how vacancies interact and distribute in solid @xmath0he .",
    "( 2008 ) have estimated from thermodynamic arguments that the binding energy of a divacancy is @xmath436  k ; we note that this result is about two times larger than the energy found by clark and ceperley ( 2008 ) using the pimc method and a semi - empirical pairwise potential .",
    "it has been argued then that if vacancies existed they would separate into a vacancy - rich region and segregate from the perfect crystal . however , as we have noted earlier , at finite temperatures is crucial to consider also the entropic contributions to the gibbs free energy , which can not be obtained directly from the simulations .",
    "actually , as we show next , it turns out to be much more favorable for the configurational entropy of the crystal to have two independent vacancies rather than a bound divacancy state . by completely ignoring vibrational effects ,",
    "the resulting entropy gain can be estimated as : @xmath437 where the constraint @xmath438 is employed . by considering the temperature and concentration of vacancies employed in pimc simulations (",
    "clark and ceperley , 2008 ) , namely @xmath439  k and @xmath440 , one obtains that @xmath441  k , which actually is of the same order of magnitude than the estimated @xmath442 .",
    "we note that the same conclusion also holds when considering smaller @xmath66 s and @xmath425 s .",
    "therefore , an attractive interaction between vacancies does not necessarily implies the existence of vacancy clusters or vacancy segregation .    an alternative analysis to discern whether @xmath0he vacancies coalescence or not , consists in monitoring their spatial correlations in quantum monte carlo simulations .",
    "for instance , if a multiple - vacancy bound state was to exist then an exponential decay in the corresponding vacancy - vacancy pair - correlation function should appear at separations beyond a specific interaction distance . following this approach , lutsyshyn , cazorla , and boronat ( 2010 ) and lutsyshyn , rota , and boronat ( 2011 )",
    "have not found any evidence for the existence of a multiple - vacancy bound state at zero temperature . in particular , at the freezing point and also at higher densities the tail in the vacancy - vacancy pair - correlation function always exhibits an asymptotic plateau .",
    "pessoa , de koning , and vitiello ( 2009b ) have arrived at a similar conclusion by means of vmc calculations performed with a shadow wave function model .",

    "for instance , the elastic properties of the incommensurate crystal in the limit of zero temperature have been analysed by cazorla , lutsyshyn , and boronat ( 2013 ) ; it has been shown that when considering large vacancy concentrations ( @xmath443  % ) the shear modulus of the solid undergoes a small reduction of just few percent with respect to the perfect crystal case .    based on pigs simulations and fundamental arguments , galli and reatto",

    "recently , rota and boronat ( 2012 ) have corroborated the occurrence of vacancy - induced bec in solid helium at low temperatures by means of pimc simulations .",

    "if in the case of point defects it can be said that theory has led the way to their ( partial ) understanding , in the case of dislocations is the other way around . at present , most of what we know about dislocations in quantum solids comes from recent experiments performed by the groups of beamish , in the university of alberta , and balibar , in the ecole normale suprieure de paris ( see , for instance , haziot _ et al .",

    "the only difference between kdp and dkdp is that quantum tunneling occurs coherently in the former system whereas incoherently in the latter , an effect that has been linked by the authors to the observed @xmath584 dependence on the isotope .",
    "recently , wikfeldt and michaelides ( 2014 ) have employed _ ab initio _ pimd simulations based on dft to investigate the importance of qne on the atomic ordering and structure of h2sq ( i. e. , c@xmath2h@xmath1o@xmath2 ) .",
    "we note that in this case the authors have explicitly considered long - range van der waals interactions by using a dispersion - corrected dft functional ( see sec .",
    "[ subsec : firstprinciples ] ) .",
    "it has been found that concerted proton jumps along h - bond chains are facilitated dramatically by quantum tunneling of several protons occurring at the same time . according to wikfeldt and michaelides results , qne",
    "are crucial in this order - disorder phase transition ( that is , ferroelectric to paraelectric ) .",
    "the same phenomenology has been observed also in the analogous deuterated crystal but in a smaller magnitude , leading to an ubbelohde effect that is in good agreement with the experiments ( i. e. , elongation of the oxygen - oxygen distances by @xmath592   ) .",
    "subsequently , wikfeldt ( 2014 ) has introduced a simple model for a coupled one - dimensional h - bond chain that has been parametrised to dft calculations performed in h2sq .",
    "such an effective model allows for an efficient exploration of qne in larger systems over longer simulation times .",
    "the pimc results obtained with wikfeldt s h2sq model in fact appear to be consistent with the conclusions presented in a previous full _ ab initio _ work ( wikfeldt and michaelides , 2014 ) .",
    "further systematic studies are necessary to determine exactly how important qne are for the understanding of proton dynamics and proton order in h - bond ferroelectrics .",
    "the computational evidence gathered to date appears to indicate that quantum nuclear effects certainly are crucial .",
    "reassuringly , in a recent _ ab initio _ pimc study li , walker , and michaelides ( 2011 ) have shown that the quantum nature of the h - bond manifests appreciably in most hydrogen - bonded materials .",
    "lithium ( li ) is the lightest metallic element ; at ambient conditions it is most stable in a cubic bcc crystal .",
    "li represents the prototype of a simple metal with a fermi surface that is nearly spherical . as pressure",
    "is increased , however , this material undergoes a series of symmetry - breaking structural transformations that provoke an increase in complexity on its electronic band - structure ( guillaume _ et al .",
    "_ , 2011 ) .",
    "the presence of qne in solid li under pressure is notable .",
    "experimentally , large isotopic effects have been observed in the equation of state and elastic properties of the bulk crystal at low temperatures ( @xmath593  k ) and pressures up to @xmath594  gpa ( gromnitskaya , stalgorova , and s. m. stishov , 1999 ) .",
    "for instance , differences of about @xmath595  % have been reported for the transversal and longitudinal sound - wave velocities in solid @xmath596li and @xmath597li at low and high pressures . on the theoretical side , filippi and ceperley ( 1998 )",
    "have analysed the influence of quantum nuclear effects on the kinetic energy of the crystal with pimc simulations based on a pairwise interaction potential .",
    "it has been found that the excess kinetic energy in li decreases from about @xmath598  % of the classical value at @xmath535  k to @xmath599  % at @xmath538  k , hence qne are important all the way up to melting .",
    "the role of qne in the structural and electronic properties of small li clusters has been estimated also as very influential by rousseau and marx ( 1998 ) .",
    "one of the effects of applying pressure in a crystal is to increase the kinetic energy of the atoms .",
    "it has been argued theoretically that if the increment in zero - point motion due to compression is higher than that attained in the potential energy , eventually the crystal could melt at low temperatures .",
    "this possibility has attracted a lot of attention in hydrogen since according to some theoretical arguments and effective models a metallic liquid with exotic properties could be stabilised in the regime of mbar pressures ( babaev , sudb , and ashcroft , 2004 ) . in solid lithium",
    "it has been experimentally observed ( lazicki , fei , and hemley , 2010 ) and calculated with first - principles methods ( hernndez _ et al .",
    "_ , 2010 ) that at a pressure of @xmath375  gpa the corresponding melting line develops a negative slope ( in analogy to what occurs in sodium at @xmath600  gpa ) .",
    "this finding appears to open an alternative for the possible realisation of a ground - state metallic liquid at high pressures ( although possibly in the mbar regime , or even at much higher pressures ) .",
    "the role of qne on the sudden drop observed in the melting line of li , however , remains controversial .",
    "( 2011 ) have measured a melting temperature of @xmath601  k at a pressure of @xmath579  gpa , which represents by far the lowest melting temperature observed for any material at such pressures .",
    "the authors of this work have suggested that qne play an important role in shaping the phase diagram of li .",
    "this suggestion seems to be consistent with the fact that classical first - principles simulations ( hernndez _ et al .",
    "_ , 2010 ) provide melting temperatures which are about @xmath314  k higher than the experimental points obtained by guillaume _",
    "a more recent experiment by schaeffer _ et al . _ ( 2012 ) , however , has revealed a totally different scenario in which excellent agreement with the classical _ ab initio _ results by hernndez _",
    "( 2010 ) is obtained .",
    "then , what is the real extent of qne on the melting properties of li ?",
    "very recently , feng _ et al .",
    "_ have performed a systematic first - principles pimd study aimed at answering this question .",
    "these authors have found that the net effect of considering qne on the melting temperature of li is minimal ( e. g. , a small shift of @xmath602  k towards lower temperatures at @xmath603  gpa ) .",
    "interestingly , qne influence noticeably the free energy of the solid and liquid phases by separate , however there is a strong qne compensation effect between the two phases at melting ( feng _ et al . _ , 2015 ) .",
    "light - weight materials based on lithium are important from a technological point of view , and thus so are qne .",
    "two interesting examples are lithium hydride ( lih ) and lithium imide ( li@xmath1nh ) .",
    "lih is used in the nuclear industry either as a shielding agent or fuel in energy reactors ( welch , 1974 ; veleckis , 1977 ) .",
    "lih is an ionic crystal that stabilises in the rocksalt structure at ambient conditions ; li is the cation ( positively charged ion ) and h the anion ( negatively charged ion ) .",
    "the presence of large qne in lih has been reported both in experiments and quantum simulations ( boronat _ et al .",
    "_ , 2004 ) . at room temperature the experimental lindemann ratio of the hydrogen ion amounts to @xmath496 ( vidal and vidal - valat , 1986 ) , which lies in between those measured for solid h@xmath1 and ne ( i. e. , @xmath604 and @xmath605 , respectively ) , thus indicating very strong quantum character",
    "large quantum isotopic effects have been reported in lithium hydride for numerous quantities including the kinetic energy , lindemann ratio , and lattice parameter .",
    "for example , cazorla and boronat ( 2005 ) have estimated by means of vmc calculations based on classical interatomic potentials that the kinetic energy of the hydrogen anion at zero temperature changes from @xmath606 in lih to @xmath607  mev in lid . meanwhile ,",
    "the corresponding lindemann ratio is reduced by about @xmath528  % in lid as compared to that in lih .",
    "more recently , dammak _ et al . _",
    "( 2012 ) have found by using a quantum thermostat approach in combination with first - principles methods , that the lattice parameter difference between lih and lid amounts to @xmath465 and @xmath608     at @xmath609 and @xmath535  k , respectively , in fairly good agreement with the experiments ( namely , @xmath608 and @xmath610   ) .",
    "qne can also affect considerably the electronic properties of a quantum solid , in particular the electronic energy band gap , @xmath611 , due to the presence of electron - phonon couplings . by using a first - principles approach that consistently takes into account anharmonic and zero - point motion effects , monserrat , drummond and needs ( 2013 )",
    "have calculated the quantum - mechanical expectation value of @xmath611 in lih and lid over the temperature interval @xmath612  k. they have found that the isotopic effect in @xmath611 roughly amounts to @xmath613  % , with lid exhibiting always the largest energy band gap .",
    "interestingly , qne at zero temperature account for a @xmath611 variation of @xmath594  % as compared to the value calculated with classical methods , which is @xmath614  ev .",
    "lithium imide ( li@xmath1nh ) is a very promising hydrogen storage material due to its low molecular weight and central role played on the decomposition reaction ( shevlin and guo , 2009 ) : @xmath615 where in the first stage a total of @xmath616  wt% h@xmath1 is released and of @xmath617  wt% h@xmath1 in the second .",
    "a lot of research , both of computational and experimental nature , has been devoted to understand the atomic structure and phase transitions occurring in li@xmath1nh . due to the light mass of the atoms and relatively weak interactions between particles , qne",
    "are likely to affect the fundamental properties of this material .",
    "zhang , dyer , and alavi ( 2005 ) have solved the schrdinger equation of a proton in the potential energy surface of li@xmath1nh calculated with dft methods , to analyse the influence of qne on its dynamics .",
    "it has been found that the quantum character of h atoms is very strong , leading to partial delocalisation of the proton around certain n centers through quantum tunneling .",
    "the origin of this effect has been traced back to the relatively flat potential energy landscape of the system .",
    "the results of a more recent computational study by ludue@xmath92a and sebastiani ( 2010 ) based on _ ab initio _ pimd simulations , appear to support the validity of these results .",
    "the proton momentum distribution in li@xmath1nh has been experimentally measured with inelastic neutron scattering techniques , and calculated with quantum thermostatted _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics ( ceriotti _ et al .",
    "_ , 2010b ) .",
    "the reported experimental and computational @xmath53 results are in good agreement , providing a large average kinetic energy of @xmath618  k for li atoms , of @xmath619  k for n , and of @xmath620  k for h.    the presence of proton quantum tunneling and large zero - point motion in li@xmath1nh has several implications .",
    "first , the conventional treatment of quantum nuclear effects through the quasi - harmonic approximation should not be adequate in this system . and second",
    ", the real energy barrier for hydrogen diffusion , a key parameter for understanding and designing new h - storage materials , must be lower than predicted with classical simulation methods .",
    "in fact , zhang , dyer , and alavi ( 2005 ) have estimated that at room temperature the h diffusion coefficient in li@xmath1nh is about @xmath363 orders of magnitude higher than the one expected from classical theory . in the light of these results , full quantum treatment of hydrogen atoms in crystals",
    "similar to li@xmath1nh ( e. g. , libh@xmath2 ) may allow for an improved rational engineering of h - storage materials .",

    "more recently , monserrat , drummond , and needs ( 2013 ) have estimated with a fully anharmonic first - principles approach that the zero - point motion renormalisation of the electronic energy band gap in diamond amounts to @xmath622  mev .",

    "batio@xmath23 ) quasi - harmonic approaches turn out to be inadequate for describing their thermodynamic stability and the energy differences between energetically competitive phases ; one instead has to consider methods that fully take into account anharmonicity .",
    "meanwhile , the interatomic interactions in quantum solids normally are not described correctly by standard first - principles ( lda and gga dft functionals ) or semi - empirical approaches .",
    "combination of these two factors makes the simulation of quantum solids very challenging .",

    "it is also likely that qne are more influential than previously assumed in systems that are relevant to the pharmaceutical industry ( molecular crystal polymorph ) and catalysis ( diffusion and adsorption of small molecules on carbon - based and metallic surfaces ) .",
    "we hope that our review will motivate new investigations in the context of materials science that will take into consideration the quantum nature of atoms in particular systems and processes .    in spite of all the insight gathered in quantum solids ,",
    "there are still a few remaining aspects that need to be better understood .",
    "these are essentially related to comprehension of ( i )  the behavior of different types of crystalline defects and the interactions between them , and ( ii )  the energy , structural , and dynamical properties of quantum crystals under extreme @xmath62 conditions .",

    "quantum simulations could contribute significantly to this endeavor .",
    "nevertheless , due to the large size of the simulation cells involved ( @xmath634 atoms ) and inherent structural complexity of line defects , this progress is slow at the moment ( see , for instance , boninsegni _ et al . _ , 2007 and landinez - borda , cai , and de koning , 2016 ) .",
    "meanwhile , the crystal structures appearing in the phase diagram of most molecular solids at high pressures either are vaguely characterised or unknown .",
    "the outcomes of systematic structural searches based on first - principles methods in fact have been very useful to better identify them .",
    "nevertheless , the influence of qne on the thermodynamic stability of different high-@xmath70 polymorph generally are disregarded in computational studies ( see , for instance , the case of n@xmath1 and ch@xmath2 ) , or considered straightforwardly within the quasi - harmonic approximation .",
    "it is worth stressing once again that a consequence of applying pressure in a crystal is to extend the temperature range over which qne are relevant ; therefore , the presence of quantum nuclear effects like zero - point motion , quantum atomic exchanges and quantum tunneling , the majority of which are not reproduced correctly by harmonic - based approaches , are key aspects for understanding the properties of molecular solids under extreme thermodynamic conditions .",
    "such a comprehension is crucial to advance our knowledge in planetary sciences .",
    "common to these challenges is the underlying problem about how to describe the interactions between atoms in quantum crystals correctly . as we have explained before",
    ", these interactions require to go beyond standard first - principles approaches which , in addition to the unavoidable task of treating qne , sometimes makes the simulation of quantum solids prohibitive in terms of computational expense . to this regard , the outcomes of systematic benchmark studies involving non - standard dft and eqmc methods are crucial for rigorously establishing acceptable balances between numerical accuracy and computational load .",
    "further progress in current electronic - band structure algorithms , on one hand , and improvement on the availability of quantum computer packages that allow to simulate qne , on the other , would facilitate enormously this task .",
    "as a final reflection , we would like to mention that in not a few situations qne are `` put under the rug '' by arguing that they should play a minor role or somehow cancel out .",
    "this is normally supported by a reasoning of the type `` good agreement with the experiments '' obtained in classical studies .",
    "nevertheless , several authors have demonstrated that the causes behind such a good agreement sometimes can be traced back to an inaccurate representation of the atomic forces , which can disguise the real magnitude of qne [ see , for instance , the case of the predicted atomisation transition in solid h@xmath1 under pressure , chen _ et al . _",
    "( 2014 ) ] .",
    "therefore , tests on the influence of qne in light - weight and highly anharmonic crystals should not be avoided but instead performed systematically . as expressed by miller ( 2005 ) ,",
    "`` if one performs only classical simulations , one will never know whether quantum effects are important .",

    "<S> quantum crystals abound in the whole range of solid - state species . below a certain threshold temperature the physical behavior of rare gases ( @xmath0he and ne ) , molecular solids ( h@xmath1 and ch@xmath2 ) , and some ionic ( lih ) , covalent ( graphite ) , and metallic ( li ) crystals can be only explained in terms of quantum nuclear effects ( qne ) . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed comprehension of the nature of quantum solids is critical for achieving progress in a number of fundamental and applied scientific fields like , for instance , planetary sciences , hydrogen storage , nuclear energy , quantum computing , and nanoelectronics . </S>",
    "<S> this review describes the current physical understanding of quantum crystals formed by atoms and small molecules , as well as the wide palette of simulation techniques that are used to investigate them . </S>",
    "<S> relevant aspects in these materials such as phase transformations , structural properties , elasticity , crystalline defects and the effects of reduced dimensionality , are discussed thoroughly . </S>",
    "<S> an introduction to quantum monte carlo techniques , which in the present context are the simulation methods of choice , and other quantum simulation approaches ( e. g. , path - integral molecular dynamics and quantum thermal baths ) is provided . </S>",
    "<S> the overarching objective of this article is twofold . </S>",
    "<S> first , to clarify in which crystals and physical situations the disregard of qne may incur in important bias and erroneous interpretations . and second , to promote the study and appreciation of qne , a topic that traditionally has been treated in the context of condensed matter physics , within the broad and interdisciplinary areas of materials science . </S>"
