    "we are carrying out a study of the properties of the interstellar medium ( ism ) in galaxies to understand the effects of the interplay between the global conditions of a galaxy and its star formation activity .",
    "the global properties of a galaxy most likely set the preconditions for star formation and also trigger the star formation . by `` global '' we are refering to the conditions in the spiral arms , interarm medium , nuclei , or individual regions in the few hundred parsec range . interacting galaxies",
    "are excellent laboratories for this investigation because the interaction can speed up processes ( e.g. increase mass flow rates ) or enhance physical conditions ( e.g. increase densities ) in the interstellar medium .",
    "since every galaxy is unique in some sense it is important to carry out case studies of individual interacting galaxies .",
    "here we have chosen the galaxy m51 to investigate its ism and its star formation activity .",
    "the galaxy m51 ( ngc  5194 ) , also called the whirlpool galaxy , is a grand - design spiral of hubble type sbc .",
    "it has an inclination angle of @xmath10 ( tully 1974 b ) and thus it is seen almost face on .",
    "the total spatial extent of m51 , as seen in the visible , is about @xmath11 .",
    "m51 is interacting with its companion ngc  5195 which is @xmath12 to the north . due to its proximity",
    "( 9.6  mpc , sandage & tammann 1975 ) and its face on appearance , m51 is one of the best studied interacting galaxies . despite this fact some aspects of this galaxy remain a puzzle .",
    "the star formation rate of m51 is not spectacular .",
    "it is quite normal for an isolated sbc - sc galaxy ( kennicutt 1998 ) .",
    "however , m51 might have been a sb galaxy prior to the interaction with ngc  5195 and evolved to a sbc - sc late - type galaxy ( tully 1974 c ; kennicutt 1998 ) .",
    "the galaxy interaction is also believed to be responsible for the current density wave in m51 enhancing the inner spiral arm structure and triggering star formation in the spiral arms .",
    "the density wave pattern , however , terminates at corotation and the spiral arms beyond corotation are attributed to material clumping induced directly by the galaxy interaction ( tully 1974 c ) .",
    "it is clear from the arrangement of the ionized gas ( tully 1974 a , b , c ; van der hulst et al .",
    "1988 ; tilanus & allen 1991 ) , molecular gas ( garc ' ia - burillo , gulin , & cernicharo 1993 ; lo et al .  1987 ; rand & kulkarni 1990 ; vogel , kulkarni , & scoville 1988 ) , atomic gas ( tilanus & allen 1989 , 1991 ; rots et al .",
    "1990 ) , and dust in the spiral arms that star formation in the arms is due to a density wave . however , the crowding of h  ii regions in the north - east and the south - west of m51 , as seen for example in the h@xmath13 map of van der hulst et al .",
    "( 1988 ) , may not be caused by the density wave but directly linked to the galaxy interaction . in this case",
    "the galaxy interaction has strong and direct control over the location and the strength of the star formation in m51 .    to investigate the star formation activity , we observed m51 in the 158  @xmath1 m [ c  ii ] fine - structure line .",
    "the [ c  ii ] line emission from galaxies arises predominantly in the warm , dense , photodissociated surfaces of molecular clouds exposed to starlight from nearby ob stars ( e.g. stacey et al .",
    "these regions , commonly called photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) are heated predominantly by photoelectric ejection of energetic electrons from grains , and cooled by far - infrared ( fir ) fine structure line radiation from o@xmath14 , and c@xmath15 .",
    "typically , the strongest cooling line is the [ c  ii ] line , but the [ o  i ] 63  @xmath1 m line is often roughly the same strength in starburst nuclei .",
    "the [ c  ii ] line emission from moderate velocity shocks is much weaker than that from pdrs ( hollenbach and mckee 1989 ) .",
    "the observation of the [ c  ii ] @xmath16@xmath17@xmath18 fine structure line at 157.7409  @xmath1 m was carried out with the mpe / ucb far - infrared imaging fabry - perot interferometer , fifi ( poglitsch et al .",
    "1991 ; stacey et al .  1992 ) , on board the kuiper airborne observatory in june 1994 and april 1995 .",
    "the field of view of the @xmath19 array was @xmath20 ( @xmath21 per pixel ) and the beam size was @xmath2 ( @xmath22  sr ; fwhm ) .",
    "we placed the array at 7 positions in m51 .",
    "four positions were placed @xmath23 apart in a square to cover the whole galaxy . to fully sample the central region ,",
    "two positions were shifted diagonally in north - east and south - west directions by 1.5 pixels with respect to the center and one position was placed at the center . the center position ( ( 0,0 )",
    "position ) is at ra = @xmath24 , dec = @xmath25 ( 1950 ) .",
    "the total observed field of view was @xmath26 .",
    "the position accuracy is estimated to be about @xmath27 .    except for the position at the center all scans were carried out in `` stare '' mode ( fixed plate separation of the resolution determining fabry - perot interferometer ) .",
    "the spectral resolution in this mode was 120  km  s@xmath28 ( fwhm ) .",
    "to take the dispersion of the velocity shifts in m51 into account ( more than 100  km  s@xmath28 ) we readjusted the plate separation of the fabry - perot interferometers for each individual array position .",
    "however , the spectral range of some of the edge pixel which cover outer parts of m51 do not cover the entire expected velocity range of the [ c  ii ] line .",
    "those pixels were not used for the data analyses .",
    "for the center position we scanned the fabry - perot interferometer over 300  km  s@xmath28 .",
    "the spectral resolution at this position was 114  km  s@xmath28 ( fwhm ) .",
    "we used the h@xmath29s line at 158.0148  @xmath1 m to calibrate the transmission wavelength of the fabry - perot interferometers .",
    "internal blackbodies were used to flatfield the detector array .",
    "we observed the planets jupiter ( june 1994 ) and mars ( april 1995 ) for absolute calibration of our data .",
    "for the brightness temperatures of jupiter at 158  @xmath1 m we used @xmath30  k ( hildebrand et al .  1985 ) .",
    "we determined the brightness temperature of mars to be 207  k at 158  @xmath1 m from the published values of wright ( 1976 ) and wright & odenwald ( 1980 ) .",
    "the mean diameter of jupiter at the time of the observation was about @xmath31 and the mean diameter of mars was about @xmath27 .",
    "the accuracy of the absolute calibration is about 30% .",
    "the final map of the integrated [ c  ii ] line intensity ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) was made using a maximum entropy image restoration program .",
    "this program was written especially for the fifi data and follows the algorithm as outlined in skilling & bryan ( 1984 ) .",
    "it takes the data from all positions observed with fifi and reconstructs an image on a finer grid using the maximum entropy method and constrains the data points by a chi - square fit .",
    "the result is a deconvolved image which is then convolved with a @xmath2 ( fwhm ) gaussian beam .",
    "an additional large error term was added to pixels which do not cover the full velocity range within their beam .",
    "this resulted in a smoothing effect due to a strong influence from neighboring pixels which do cover the full veloctiy range .",
    "the contour lines in the final map are smoother then in the raw map and all features can be traced back to the observed data ( no artificial features were introduced by the program ) . on the other hand",
    "all obvious features in the observed data appear in the final map .",
    "the contour map of the integrated [ c  ii ] line intensity superimposed on an optical image of m51 ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) shows that the [ c  ii ] emission is distributed over the whole galaxy , covering a total solid angle of @xmath32  sr and peaking at the nucleus .",
    "the integrated [ c  ii ] intensity at this peak is @xmath33 } = ( 1.31 \\pm 0.15 ) \\times 10^{-4}$ ] erg  s@xmath28@xmath34sr@xmath28 .",
    "this is in very good agreement with an earlier measurement of the integrated [ c  ii ] intensity by stacey et al .",
    "( 1991 ) who found @xmath33 } = ( 1.4 \\pm 0.3 ) \\times 10^{-4}$ ] erg  s@xmath28@xmath34sr@xmath28 ( stacey 2001 ; see also crawford et al.1985 ) .",
    "a comparison of the fifi [ c  ii ] results with our iso [ c  ii ] data of m51 will be presented in a separate paper ( nikola et al .",
    "preliminary reduction of our [ c  ii ] iso measurement of m51 shows a lower intensity compared to the fifi intensity , but roughly consistent with the ratio of the beam sizes .",
    "there is also a peak in the north - east ( ne peak ) of m51 ( at ra = @xmath35 , dec = @xmath36 ( 1950 ) ) coinciding with an enhancement in the optical emission in the spiral arm .",
    "the integrated [ c  ii ] intensity at the ne peak is @xmath33 } = 9.2 \\times 10^{-5}$ ] erg  s@xmath28@xmath34sr@xmath28 or about 70% of the nuclear value .",
    "a third peak in the [ c  ii ] emission in the south - west ( sw peak ) of m51 ( at ra = @xmath37 , dec = @xmath38 ( 1950 ) ) coincides with a position of a spiral arm where enhanced optical emission can be seen . here",
    "the integrated [ c  ii ] intensity is @xmath33 } = 5.6 \\times 10^{-5}$ ] erg  s@xmath28@xmath34sr@xmath28 .",
    "the ne and sw peaks are roughly symmetrically aligned with respect to the nucleus , and fall on local brightness peaks in the optical spiral arms .",
    "other than this , there is only a weak indication for spiral structure in the [ c  ii ] map .",
    "there is an extension in the [ c  ii ] emission that follows the northern spiral arm past the ne [ c  ii ] peak , but the ne and sw peaks appear to be quite localized , essentially point sources to our @xmath2 beam .",
    "a comparison of the distribution of the [ c  ii ] emission with the distribution of the fir emission shows very good agreement .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the contour map of the integrated [ c  ii ] line intensity superimposed on a contour map of the 170  @xmath1 m fir continuum ( smith 1982 ) at a spatial resolution ( @xmath39 ) similar to that of the [ c  ii ] map .",
    "the location of the main peak and the ne peak in both distributions match each other very well .",
    "there is no peak towards the sw , but there is a ridge from the nuclear region that touches our sw [ c  ii ] peak .",
    "it is likely that these are the same structures , but not coincident due to modest signal - to - noise ratios in both maps .",
    "the integrated [ c  ii ] luminosity of m51 is @xmath40 } = 3 \\times 10^{8 } l_{\\odot}$ ] or 1% of the fir luminosity as measured by the iras satellite ( @xmath41 , rice et al .",
    "1988 , scaled to 9.6  mpc ) .",
    "this is at the high end of the @xmath40}$]/@xmath42 ratio observed in galactic nuclei(crawford et al .",
    "1985 ; stacey et al .",
    "1991 ) , but consistent with the reported ratios for late type galaxies ( ngc  6946 , madden et al .  1993 ; ngc  4038/4039 , nikola et al .",
    "we use the smith ( 1982 ) map to calculate the @xmath40}$]/@xmath42 ratio within our beam . to do this , we correct the smith ( 1982 ) luminosity estimates ( that include only the 80  @xmath1 m and 200  @xmath1 m contiunuum ) to include the shorter wavelength fir continuum as observed by iras .",
    "this correction amounts to a factor of 1.5 increase in the smith ( 1982 ) @xmath43 map .",
    "the ratios range form 0.6% at the nucleus to 1.1% and 1.4% respectively at the ne and sw peaks ( table[tab : c+fir ] ) .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the [ c  ii]/@xmath44co(1@xmath60 ) line intensity ratio is an indicator of ob star formation activity in dusty galaxies ( stacey et al .  1991 ) .",
    "a ratio of 4400 is typically found in starburst nuclei , while a value near 1200 is more typical of quiesent spiral galaxies . in the north - east of m51 , near the ne peak",
    ", we obtain the highest [ c  ii ] to co integrated intensity ratios in m51 ( 5000 ; for `` case-1 '' ) similar to starburst nuclei . from their data lord & young ( 1990 )",
    "also derived the highest star formation efficiency in the north - east region close to the ne peak .",
    "the moderate integrated intensity ratio at the nucleus ( @xmath45}/i_{\\rm co } \\approx 2000 $ ] ) indicates moderate star formation activity .",
    "although the peak of the [ c  ii ] emission is located at the center of m51 there is also a large amount of co in this region resulting in the moderate intensity ratio .",
    "in addition the nucleus of m51 is most likely an agn ( ford et al .",
    "1985 ; makishima et al .  1990 ; kohno et al.1996 ; grillmair et al .",
    "1997 ) and not a starburst region .",
    "the integrated intensity ratio in the south - west of m51 ( @xmath45}/i_{\\rm co } \\approx 3300 $ ] ) is smaller than at the ne peak .",
    "although we can not give a firm value for the fraction of [ c  ii ] emission from pdrs in m51 at the ne peak at least 50% or more of the integrated [ c  ii ] intensity originates most likely from pdrs . this result and",
    "the high [ c  ii]/co(1@xmath60 ) intensity ratio suggest that the most active star forming region in m51 lies in the north - east region , probably near the ne peak .",
    "the maximum of the [ c  ii ] to co integrated intensity ratio , however , is next to the ne peak between the spiral arms .",
    "this is likely the result of interpolation in the co map .",
    "no co data were obtained by lord & young ( 1990 ) at the exact location of the ne peak .",
    "the low [ c  ii]/co(1@xmath60 ) intensity ratios at the nucleus and the sw peak may be the effect of beam dilution .",
    "if the ism in these regions consists of only a few but highly active star forming knots within an extended , less active region the [ c  ii]/co(1@xmath60 ) intensity ratio averaged over the fifi beam would be low .",
    "such a morphology of the ism is suggested e.g.  for ngc  4038/39 ( nikola et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the finding of enhanced star formation activity in the north - east and probably also in the south - west is also supported by the distribution of the h@xmath13 emission ( van der hulst et al .",
    "1988 ) , the fuv emission ( bersier et al .  1994 ) , and the @xmath44co(2@xmath61 ) emission ( garc ' ia - burillo , gulin , & cernicharo 1993 ) , the fir continuum ( smith 1982 ) , and the thermal radio continuum at @xmath46  cm ( klein , wielebinski , & beck 1984 ) .",
    "all the distributions show emission which either peaks in the north - east and south - west or only peaks in the north - east but is elongated in north - east south - west direction .",
    "however , this distribution is most pronounced in the [ c  ii ] emission with a main focus towards the north - east region",
    ".    additional support for the enhanced star formation activity and the special location of the activity comes from analysis of the kinematics and dynamics of m51 .",
    "tully ( 1974 c ) concluded in his analysis that the density - wave pattern in m51 is confined between the inner lindblad resonance and corotation and that the spiral arms outside corotation can be accounted for by material clumping induced by the galaxy interaction .",
    "corotation occurs at a radius of about 5.8  kpc ( tully 1974 c ; converted to a distance of m51 of 9.6  mpc ) .",
    "both the ne peak and the sw peak lie at about the same distance from the center of m51 as corotation .",
    "thus they are located at the transition zone of the density - wave pattern and the spiral arms which are attributed to material clumping .",
    "especially the sw peak coincides with a position of extreme clumping ( tully 1974 c ; position `` n '' in figure  10 therein ) .",
    "this is also the position where the orbits of all the test particles which were originally at or beyond 6.7  kpc pass through ( toomre & toomre 1972 ) .",
    "material clumping can also be seen at the position of the ne peak .",
    "the encounter model of toomre & toomre ( 1972 ) shows crowding of test particles along the outer spiral arm which starts at the ne peak where the density - wave arm terminates and follows on to north and west to the southern tidal tail .",
    "this spiral arm can be attributed to material clumping ( tully 1974 c ) .",
    "the relatively weak [ c  ii ] emission that we observe in the north - west region might originate from this clumped material .",
    "the coincidence of the location of the ne and sw peak with the region where most or all trajectories of the test particles pass through and where the density wave arms terminate might indicate that the enhanced [ c  ii ] emission is caused by an enhanced mass flow crossing the spiral arms .",
    "this could result in a high rate of cloud - cloud collisions which then trigger star formation .",
    "the position of the ne and sw peak at these special locations where the tidal tials emerge from the disk in the simulations of toomre & toomre ( 1972 ) also indicates that the star formation there is triggered by the galaxy interaction .",
    "the trajectories of test particles crossing the spiral arms shown by toomre & toomre ( 1972 ) are almost concentrated in a single spot in the south - west in contrast to the north - east where the crossing area is more spread out .",
    "this would result in a beam dilution effect at the sw peak , resulting in a smaller [ c  ii]/co(1@xmath60 ) intensity ratio .",
    "except for the ne and sw peak and the main peak in the center of m51 the [ c  ii ] emission is distributed very uniformly over the whole galaxy .",
    "there is no clear signature of the spiral structure visible in the [ c  ii ] emission .",
    "this could be due to a smoothing effect given our beam size or the presence of an underlying [ c  ii ] emission in m51 or both .",
    "however , [ c  ii ] observations with fifi of ngc  6946 ( madden et al.1993 ) , which is at about the same distance as m51 but a little bit less extended , shows some spiral structure .",
    "also the [ c  ii ] map of m83 taken with fifi ( geis et al .  in preparation ) , which has a similar extension as m51 reveals very clumpy [ c  ii ] emission following the spiral arms .",
    "this difference in the ngc  6949 and m83 maps and the m51 map supports the presence of an underlying extended [ c  ii ] emission in m51 .",
    "we have shown in the previous sections that the cnm and the eldwim can in principle contribute a large fraction to the [ c  ii ] emission .",
    "the eldwim is most likely the main contributer to an underlying [ c  ii ] emission in most of m51 .",
    "but in the north - west region of m51 the cnm is most likely the main source of the [ c  ii ] emission .",
    "how much the eldwim contributes to the [ c  ii ] emission in m51 remains unclear .",
    "even with the use of the [ n  ii ] 122@xmath1 m line it was not possible to present a firm statement about the real contribution of the [ c  ii ] emission from ionized gas .",
    "mapping of m51 in the [ c  ii ] and both [ n  ii ] lines with high spatial resolution might help to disentangle the contributions from the various ionized gas phases and to distinguish between an on - arm , inter - arm , and underlying [ c  ii ] emission .",
    "high spatial resolution would also be required to find out if the pdrs lie on a separate spiral arm ( maybe between the ionized arm and the molecular arm or coinciding with the molecular arm ) and to distiguish between [ c  ii ] emission from a possible pdr arm and emission from neutral gas in the h  i arm .",
    "the pdrs at the ne and sw peak might be located in molecular superclouds of masses @xmath47 within the giant molecular association with masses of @xmath48 observed by vogel , kulkarni , & scoville ( 1988 ) and rand & kulkarni ( 1990 ) in these regions .",
    "this is supported by the low fuv intensity of @xmath49 which we estimated from the pdr models .",
    "such low fuv intensities are normally expected in pdrs in giant molecular clouds ( @xmath50 ) ( stacey et al.1991 , 1993 ) and might therefore also be the case in pdrs in molecular superclouds .    in the nucleus",
    "the high density pdr solution is supported by the detection of the hcn molecule in the center of m51 and in the inner spiral arms ( nguyen et al .",
    "1992 ; kuno et al .  1995 ; kohno et al .",
    "this finding suggests that the density of the molecular gas in these clouds is @xmath51  @xmath8 .",
    "no observations of this density tracer are available in the outer parts of m51 and therefore no statement can be made about which pdr solution is more likely .",
    "we obtained a map of m51 in the [ c  ii ] fine structure line at 158  @xmath1 m with a spatial resolution of @xmath2 ( fwhm ) .",
    "the [ c  ii ] emission arises from the whole visible extent of m51 .",
    "the main peak of the [ c  ii ] emission is located at the center of m51 and has an integrated intensity of @xmath45 } = 1.31 \\times 10^{-4}$ ] erg  s@xmath28@xmath34sr@xmath28 .",
    "in addition we found a [ c  ii ] peak in the north - east and in the south - west of m51 .",
    "the ne peak is stronger than the sw peak and has an integrated [ c  ii ] intensity of 70% of the integrated intensity of the main peak .",
    "the ne peak and the sw peak lie roughly on a straight line going through the center of m51 and they have the same distance to the center as corotation of the density wave pattern .",
    "both peaks are located at the position where the density wave pattern terminates and where the spiral structure is attributed to material clumping due to the interaction of m51 with ngc  5195 .",
    "the [ c  ii ] emission in the ne peak originates mainly from pdrs .",
    "we also find that the strongest star formation activity occurs in the north - east of m51 close to the ne peak .",
    "we suspect that this enhanced star formation activity is triggered by cloud - cloud collisions due to a high mass flow crossing the spiral arms .",
    "there might also be high star formation activity in the south - west triggered by the same effect but which is hidden to our observation due to beam dilution .    from the pdr model",
    "we derive two possible solutions for the individual positions we investigated in m51 .",
    "the estimated fuv intensity is similar for both solutions with an intensity of a few 100 times the local galactic interstellar radiation field . for the density",
    "we obtain very different solutions with @xmath52  @xmath8 for the low density solution and @xmath53  @xmath8 for the high density solution . at the center of m51",
    "the high density solution is supported by the detection of hcn in this region .",
    "the pdrs in the ne and sw peak are most likely associated with the molecular superclouds and giant molecular associations found in these regions .",
    "this is supported by the relatively low fuv intensity derived from the pdr model .",
    "the total mass of the [ c  ii ] emitting photodissociated regions in m51 is @xmath54 .",
    "this is only a small fraction ( 2% ) of the total molecular mass .",
    "if all [ c  ii ] arises in pdrs that fraction can be as high as 34% . in the nucleus the fraction of the [ c  ii ] emitting photodissociated gas ranges between 3% and 19% and at the ne and sw peak the mass of the [ c  ii ] emitting gas can be as high as 72% .",
    "a large fraction of the overall [ c  ii ] emission in m51 can originate in an underlying extended medium .",
    "it remains unclear how much the eldwim contributes to this emission , but it could be the main source .",
