    "mirror symmetry is a prediction from string theory identifying invariants associated to the complex geometry of a family of calabi - yau manifolds with invariants associated to the khler geometry of a possibly different calabi - yau manifold that is called the mirror . in our setting , we take as definition of a calabi - yau manifold a complex manifold equipped with a nowhere vanishing holomorphic volume form .",
    "the original focus in mathematics was on the dualities of hodge diamonds which gave a straightforward though non - trivial check , and on the enumerative predictions for the number of curves of a given genus and degree that went beyond the computations which could be performed using rigourous methods . while it is not reasonable to expect the existence of a mirror partner to every calabi - yau manifold , there are large classes of examples ( e.g. toric complete intersections @xcite ) for which various original forms of the conjecture have been verified .    in @xcite ,",
    "kontsevich introduced a homological version of the conjecture : the invariants to be related would be the derived category of coherent sheaves on the complex side and the fukaya category of lagrangian submanifolds on the symplectic side .",
    "strominger , yau , and zaslow @xcite later introduced a geometric version of the conjecture : mirror pairs should arise as dual torus fibrations over the same base ; these are often called syz fibrations .",
    "the degenerating family can then be understood as arising from rescaling the fibres .",
    "it is easier to state precise versions of the syz conjecture ( which still hold in a large class of examples ) if one analyses the two sides of mirror symmetry separately , i.e. fixing a khler form on a calabi - yau manifold @xmath0 whose symplectic topology will be related to the complex geometry of a calabi - yau variety @xmath1 over the ring of power series @xmath2 $ ] or the analogous rings appearing naturally in symplectic topology in which real exponents are allowed ; weakening one side to a formal family is related to a convergence problem in floer theory .    in this context",
    ", the starting point of a reformulation of the syz conjecture is the existence of a lagrangian fibration @xmath3 with singularities ( there is still no good approach to the class of allowable singularities ) .",
    "the space @xmath1 should then be constructed from the fukaya category @xmath4 as a moduli space of objects supported on fibres of this map @xcite . while the moduli space of such objects can be described locally over the base as the dual torus fibration , the fact that we consider them as objects of the fukaya category introduces non - trivial identifications of the local charts given by the sum of a classical term with _ instanton corrections _ that arise from the moduli space of holomorphic discs bounded by such fibres .",
    "these corrections are expected to be expressible in terms of the geometry of the base via _ wall - crossing formulae _ @xcite .    in this",
    "setting , the homological mirror conjecture asserts the existence of a derived equivalence @xmath5 where both categories are linear over the appropriate version of power series rings .",
    "much effort has gone in verifying this conjecture in certain examples @xcite , and extracting some of the classical statements of mirror symmetry from it @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , all the current proofs of mirror symmetry rely on _ ad hoc _ methods to construct the mirror functor , neglecting the construction of the mirror as a moduli space of objects of the fukaya category . to address this issue , fukaya has introduced family floer cohomology @xcite as a strategy for directly assigning a sheaf on @xmath1 to a lagrangian @xmath6 in @xmath0 ; as noted in @xcite , the main difficulty arises from the caustics of @xmath6 , i.e. the singularities of its projection to the base . in section [ sec",
    ": from - lagr - grad ] , we use the invariance properties of floer cohomology under continuation maps to bypass the difficulties arising from caustics ( as in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 6 ) ) , and prove convergence in the rigid analytic sense .",
    "since the problem is sufficiently complicated in the absence of singular fibres , we shall henceforth only consider symplectic manifolds that admit smooth lagrangian torus fibrations .",
    "this class includes , for example , a codimension @xmath7 subspace of the @xmath8-dimensional space of linear symplectic structures on @xmath9 , corresponding to those structures that can be represented as the quotient of @xmath10 by a lattice which intersects some lagrangian plane in a rank @xmath11 subgroup .",
    "it also includes the following twisted example due to thurston @xcite :    equip @xmath12 with coordinates @xmath13 , and symplectic structure",
    "@xmath14 this form is invariant under the transformation @xmath15 as well as under translation by integral vectors of the form @xmath16 .",
    "the thurston manifold is the quotient of @xmath12 by the group generated by these transformations .",
    "thurston considered the symplectic fibration obtained by forgetting the @xmath17 coordinates , which gives a description of this space as a twisted ( flat ) torus bundle over the torus . in joint work with auroux , katzarkov , and orlov @xcite",
    "we noticed the existence of two ( inequivalent ) lagrangian fibrations over this space :    \\(1 ) the fibration obtained by forgetting the @xmath18 and @xmath19 coordinates is a principal bundle on which the @xmath20-torus acts .",
    "since the total space is not trivial , this fibration admits no continuous section , and hence , in particular , no lagrangian section .",
    "\\(2 ) the fibration obtained by forgetting the @xmath21 and @xmath19 coordinates admits a lagrangian section @xmath22 .",
    "the above two examples show that one can have lagrangian fibrations with completely different behaviour on the same symplectic manifold .",
    "the first fibration is mirror to a gerbe on an abelian variety , while the second is mirror to a kodaira surface . to see this ,",
    "write the first fibration as the quotient of @xmath23^{2 } \\times \\left ( { { \\mathbb r}}/{{\\mathbb z}}\\right)^{2 }    $ ] by the equivalence relation @xmath24 note that the gluing maps act trivially on the homology of the fibre , so the action on the space of local systems is trivial .",
    "since the fibres bound no holomorphic disc , the mirror is the moduli space of such local systems ; it agrees with the mirror of the symplectic manifold obtained via the trivial identifications .",
    "this symplectic manifold is simply the product of two tori of area @xmath25 , hence the mirror is a product of two ( families of ) elliptic curves as is well - understood by now @xcite .    at this stage , it is clear that additional data are needed to implement mirror symmetry from this point of view . at the most basic level ,",
    "the lagrangian fibres are null - homologous , which implies that floer cohomology has vanishing euler characteristic whenever one of the two inputs is a fibre . under mirror symmetry the fibres map to skyscraper sheaves of point , and there are therefore many coherent sheaves ( e.g. vector bundles of non - vanishing rank ) whose mirrors would be expected to have floer cohomology groups with a fibre whose euler characteristic does not vanish .    the additional data arise naturally on both sides : by obstruction theory , the failure of this torus fibration to be trivial is detected by a second cohomology group of the base as one can easily construct a lagrangian section in the complement of a point .",
    "this obstruction class is constructed in section [ sec : lagr - torus - fibr ] using a ech cover , and a simple exponentiation procedure in section [ sec : rigid - analyt - gerb ] then yields an @xmath26-valued second cohomology class on the mirror space ; i.e. a gerbe .",
    "the correct statement of mirror symmetry involves sheaves twisted by this gerbe .    for completeness , we elaborate on the description of the mirror of the second fibration : a convenient starting point is the vector bundle @xmath27 over the torus in the @xmath28 coordinates whose fibre is the plane spanned by @xmath29 .",
    "the key observation is that the thurston manifold is obtained by taking the quotient of the fibre over @xmath28 by the lattice spanned by @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the corresponding family of lattices in @xmath32 has non - trivial monodromy ( given by an elementary transvection ) around a loop in the @xmath33 direction . constructing the mirror ( complex ) manifold by dualising the fibres ,",
    "we conclude that the underlying smooth manifold is also a torus fibration over the torus with total betti number @xmath34 , hence a primary kodaira surface @xcite . with a bit more care",
    ", one can avoid appealing to the classification of surfaces and identify the ( complex ) mirror as the degenerating family of quotients of @xmath35 by the groups of automorphisms @xmath36 parametrised by a variable @xmath37 . to obtain a precise statement of homological mirror symmetry in this setting ,",
    "one then interprets the above as giving a rigid analytic primary kodaira surface @xcite .",
    "one interesting outcome of this observation is that the two homological mirror symmetry statements imply the existence of a derived equivalence between twisted coherent sheaves on the mirror abelian variety and coherent sheaves on the mirror primary kodaira surface .",
    "such a result can be proved independently of mirror symmetry by exhibiting a fourier - mukai kernel @xcite .",
    "let @xmath38 be a compact symplectic manifold , equipped with a fibration @xmath3 over a smooth manifold @xmath39 with lagrangian fibres ; the triple @xmath40 is called a _ lagrangian fibration _ ; write @xmath41 for the fibre at a point @xmath42 , and assume that @xmath43    the vanishing of the second homotopy group of @xmath39 implies that @xmath44 vanishes , and hence that @xmath41 bounds no holomorphic disc , which implies that there are no instanton corrections , i.e. that the mirror should be the space of rank-@xmath45 unitary local systems on the fibres .",
    "there seem to be no known examples where this condition fails ( though this can be arranged if @xmath0 is not assumed to be compact , or if singular fibres are allowed ) .",
    "the symplectic topology of such fibrations is reviewed in section [ sec : lagr - torus - fibr ] , but for now , recall that the tangent space of @xmath39 at a point @xmath42 is naturally isomorphic to @xmath46 .",
    "s liouville theorem implies that the corresponding lattice in @xmath47 arises from an integral affine structure on @xmath39 .",
    "in particular , @xmath39 can be obtained by gluing polytopes in @xmath48 by transformations whose differentials lie in @xmath49 .    to this integral affine structure ,",
    "one associates a rigid analytic space ( in the sense of tate ) , which we denote @xmath1 ( this is the same construction used in @xcite ) : fix a field @xmath50 , and consider the novikov field @xmath51 this is a non - archimedian field with valuation @xmath52 @xmath53 denote by @xmath54 the units of @xmath55 , i.e. those elements with @xmath56-valuation .    as a set ,",
    "the space @xmath1 is the union @xmath57 .",
    "this description makes explicit the fact that @xmath1 parametrises lagrangian fibres together with the datum of a _ rank-@xmath45 @xmath55-local system _ with monodromy in @xmath54 .",
    "the analytic structure on @xmath1 arises from the natural identifications of the first cohomology groups of nearby fibres ; the explicit construction appears in section [ sec : constr - mirr - space ] .    given a lagrangian @xmath58 , satisfying the technical conditions required to make floer cohomology well - defined , one obtains floer cohomology groups @xmath59 for each @xmath60 , and @xmath61 .",
    "these groups are locally the fibres of coherent sheaves on @xmath1 , as can be seen by adapting an argument of fukaya @xcite who studied the case of self - floer cohomology . in order to encode the full data of the global floer theory of @xmath0 on the @xmath1-side , an _ analytic gerbe _",
    "@xmath62 on @xmath1 is introduced in section [ sec : rigid - analyt - gerb ] .",
    "[ thm : main ] there is an @xmath63-twisted coherent sheaf on @xmath1 whose dual fibre at the point of @xmath1 corresponding to a pair @xmath64 is @xmath65 .",
    "one can interpret this theorem as an attempt to make rigourous the strategy introduced in fukaya s announcement @xcite , which assigns to a lagrangian a complex analytic sheaf _",
    "assuming convergence_. in the special case of lagrangian surfaces constructed by hyperkhler rotation , analytic continuation may provide an alternative approach for bypassing the problem arising from caustics , as noted in @xcite .",
    "as part of an ongoing project to study mirror symmetry from the point of view of family floer cohomology @xcite , junwu tu has an independent argument to prove a similar result .      while the above result points in the right direction , it is unfortunately not adequate for serious applications .",
    "the last section of this paper outlines the construction of an object @xmath66 in a category of @xmath63-_twisted sheaves of perfect complexes _ that is a differential graded enhancement of the derived category of @xmath63-twisted coherent sheaves on @xmath1 .",
    "the twisted sheaf in theorem [ thm : main ] is obtained from @xmath66 by passing to cohomology .",
    "the following conjecture makes clear why @xmath66 , rather than its cohomology sheaves , is the right object to study :    if @xmath67 and @xmath68 are lagrangians in @xmath0 with corresponding twisted sheaves of perfect complexes @xmath69 and @xmath70 , there is an isomorphism @xmath71    there are two essential difficulties that arise in applying these techniques to the syz fibrations @xmath72 that are expected to exist , for example , on calabi - yau hypersurfaces in toric varieties :    \\(1 ) in general , some smooth fibres may bound non - constant holomorphic discs . assuming such fibres are _ unobstructed _ , which essentially means that the counts of holomorphic discs with boundary on a single fibre algebraically vanish , tu constructed the candidate ( open subset ) of the mirror in @xcite .",
    "the basic idea , following fukaya @xcite and kontsevich and soibelman @xcite , is that we should obtain the mirror space by gluing affinoids as in the uncorrected case , but the gluing maps take into account moduli spaces of holomorphic discs .",
    "one can interpret part of the program of gross and siebert @xcite as providing such a construction for fibrations arising from toric degenerations , though it is not yet known how to prove that their construction agrees with the one intrinsic to symplectic topology .",
    "given the appropriate technical tools ( i.e. a theory of virtual fundamental chains on moduli spaces of holomorphic discs , as in @xcite ) , the extension of our results to this setting should be straightforward .",
    "\\(2 ) the construction of the mirror space from an syz perspective also requires understanding the floer theory of singular fibres . whenever the fibre is _ immersed _ , this floer theory is well - understood @xcite . in the simplest situation ,",
    "such a fibre is an immersed lagrangian @xmath73-sphere with a single double point in a @xmath74-manifold , and the nearby lagrangian ( torus ) fibres are obtained by lagrangian surgery @xcite . using the relation between moduli spaces of holomorphic discs before and after surgery @xcite ,",
    "fukaya @xcite has announced the construction of the mirror space in this setting . in particular , for a symplectic structure on a @xmath75-surface admitting a lagrangian torus fibration , fukaya s method provides a construction of the mirror space using family floer cohomology .",
    "unfortunately , in higher dimensions , syz fibrations are expected to have singular fibres which can not be described as lagrangian immersions , putting them beyond the reach of current techniques .",
    "it is my pleasure to thank my collaborators , on past and ongoing projects , for teaching me much of what i know about mirror symmetry and symplectic topology .",
    "comments from ivan smith and nick sheridan were useful in clarifying the exposition and removing confusing conventions .",
    "in addition , i am grateful to kenji fukaya for explaining to me tate s acyclicity theorem and its relevance to mirror symmetry , and to paul seidel for having instilled in me the lesson that constructions involving the fukaya category should first be explained at the cohomological level .",
