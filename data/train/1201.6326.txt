    "this noticeable fact relies on the conservation of the vorticity @xmath5 along the flow of the velocity field , and has been first proved rigorously in the pioneering works by w. wolibner @xcite and v. yudovich @xcite .",

    "this stems from the fact that system is a coupling between transport equations .",
    "hence preserving the initial regularity requires the velocity field to be at least locally lipschitz with respect to the space variable . by arguing as in @xcite , chap .",

    "( see e.g. @xcite ) , there is a formal similarity between the two - dimensional boussinesq system and general axisymmetric solutions to the three - dimensional euler system  the so - called axisymmetric solutions _ with swirl_. in the second part of this paper ,",
    "we adapt the method of the first part so as to establish new lower bounds for the lifespan to those solutions in the case where the swirl is small .",
    "in particular , we find out that the solution tends to be global if the swirl goes to zero . in the appendix",
