    "quantum fields in the vacuum state accompany spatially entangled energy density fluctuations via the noncommutativity of energy density operators .",
    "however , the eigenvalue of the total hamiltonian can be set to zero by discarding the zero - point energy , primarily because this energy exhibits the fundamental property known as passivity @xcite and is of little use ; any intended local operation for extracting the zero - point energy out of a field actually injects energy and excites the vacuum .",
    "the zero - point energy , however , can be glimpsed through a spatial region with negative energy density @xcite , along with the casimir effect @xcite and the unruh effect @xcite .",
    "in such a spatial region , the quantum field can afford to attain a lower energy density than the zero value of the vacuum state because it saves the zero - point energy in the vacuum state .",
    "of course , we have another region with sufficient positive energy to ensure that the total energy is greater than zero .",
    "recently , quantum information theory has revealed some exotic aspects of the entangled energy density fluctuation of many - body systems in the ground state , and it has been proven that quantum energy teleportation ( qet )  is possible @xcite .",
    "qet is , from the operational viewpoint of distant protocol users , energy transportation via local operations and classical communication ( locc ) .",
    "in contrast to the standard protocols of quantum teleportation @xcite , qet protocols involve energy transportation .",
    "qet is related to the quantum theory of maxwell s demon at low temperatures @xcite and the local cooling problem of many - body quantum systems @xcite .",
    "furthermore , qet provides insight into the black hole entropy problem @xcite .",
    "qet can be implemented in various research fields including spin chains @xcite , harmonic chains @xcite , and cold trapped ions @xcite .",
    "although qet has not yet been experimentally verified , a realistic experiment was recently proposed @xcite ; the experiment uses 1 + 1-dimensional chiral massless boson fields of quantum hall edge currents @xcite , and the teleported energy may be expected to take values near @xmath0ev with present technology .        despite such experimental proposals for various physical systems @xcite ,",
    "a strong distance limitation has hampered experimental verification ; in qet over a distance @xmath1 , the transferred energy @xmath2 of 1 + 1 dimensional massless scalar fields is bounded by @xmath3 as long as vacuum - state qet protocols are adopted . here , the natural unit @xmath4 is adopted .",
    "qet thus sends only a small amount of energy over a long distance @xmath1 .",
    "this vacuum - state qet distance bound appears for two reasons : from an informational viewpoint , the spatial correlations of the zero - point fluctuation , including quantum entanglement , decay as the distance becomes large , and hence the amount of information for distant control of a quantum fluctuation becomes small and only weak strategies for extracting energy out of the distant zero - point fluctuation are available . from a physical viewpoint ,",
    "the localized negative energy induced by a qet protocol can not be separated from the positive energy injected by the measurement device ; otherwise , the negative energy excitation would exist without any positive energy excitations . to make the total energy of the field nonnegative",
    ", the negative energy excitation requires a sufficient amount of positive energy at a close distance .",
    "however , there is an interesting possibility that avoids this bound by using an exotic quantum state for qet , as we argue in this paper .",
    "we propose here a new version of the qet protocols that use a squeezed vacuum state in place of the vacuum state between two protocol users ( fig .  1 ) . in our proposal , the spatial correlation of the quantum fluctuations with zero energy is maintained even if the distance between the sender and receiver of qet is very large .",
    "the negative energy induced by the extraction of positive energy via qet is sustained not by the positive energy injected by the measurement but instead by the excitation energy in the squeezed region of the state .",
    "thus , the bound in eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) is overcome and long - distance energy teleportation can be achieved .",
    "the protocol may be implemented by adopting a spatial expansion method , which is one strategy for realizing a long - distance correlation , thus facilitating experimental verification of qet and potentially contributing to quantum device applications .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "a brief review of vacuum - state qet is provided , and in section 3 , the distance bound in eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) is derived . in section 4 , using a squeezed state , we outline the new protocol that realizes qet without the limit of distance .",

    "although the average value of the energy density in bob s region remains zero after alice s measurement , bob s local field in the post - measurement state carries positive or negative energy , depending on alice s measurement result .",

    "note that the field in bob s region is in a local vacuum state with zero energy , although a wave packet with @xmath46 exists far from bob . assuming that bob receives the information of @xmath39 from alice at time @xmath47 , bob then performs an instantaneous unitary operation dependent on @xmath39 given by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a @xmath39-dependent real parameter fixed so as to maximize the amount of teleported energy @xcite , and @xmath50 with the real function @xmath51 localized in @xmath18 $ ] .",

    "the essence of qet without the limit of distance is as follows .",
    "the distance dependence of @xmath2 for vacuum - state qet comes from @xmath55 as defined in eq .",

    "if we supply two local quantum fluctuations of @xmath150 that are far away from each other and with the same entanglement and correlations as those of the local zero - point fluctuations of two close regions , the qet remains effective , independent of the distance , because @xmath55 is the same .",
    "however , to sustain the negative - energy excitation generated by bob , additional positive energy of the field must be placed near the negative - energy excitation . in this new protocol ,",
    "the negative energy is sustained by the positive energy of the squeezed region . as depicted in fig .  2",

    "2 is so small that the amount of teleported energy attains a large value of @xmath153 .",
    "the lower diagram in fig .  2 shows the sudden expansion of the small subspace between @xmath162 and @xmath163 , which generates local excitation of @xmath150 due to severe stretching of the field modes .",
    "note that the stretched mode function can be described by @xmath164 in a similar way to expanding universe models including cosmological inflation @xcite .",
