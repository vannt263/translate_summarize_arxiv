    "measurements of the lifetime of excited electrons in cu @xcite using time - resolved two - photon photoemission ( tr-2ppe ) spectroscopy @xcite in connection with very short laser pulses reveal a couple of amazing results .",
    "most stunning is the fact that the data show lifetimes of states along the ( 100 ) and ( 111 ) direction ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively ) with energies between 1 and 4 ev above the fermi energy @xmath2 . as can be seen from the band structure shown in fig .",
    "[ cubands ] , cu has no bloch states at these energies in these two directions .",
    "but also the data for the lifetime of electrons in the remaining direction ( 110 )  the @xmath3 direction  are puzzling .",
    "_ ab initio _ calculations of the lifetime of hot electrons along the ( 110 ) direction using the @xmath4 approximation @xcite reveal a good agreement with the experimental data for electron energies between 2 and 3 ev . for energies lower than 2",
    "ev the results of the @xmath4 calculation deviate markedly from the experimental data .",
    "this is particularly remarkable because typically many - body calculations within the @xmath4 approximation agree very well with experimental data .",
    "this holds for both , the real part of the resulting quasiparticle energies @xcite as well as its imaginary part , @xcite respectively .",
    "the imaginary part of the quasiparticle energy of a band state is inverse proportional to the lifetime of this state .",
    "@xcite therefore the discrepancy of the theoretical and experimental results must be due to physics which is not covered by the @xmath4 approximation .",
    "the last point about the experimental data we would like to mention is the fact that the lifetimes in the three directions are very similar @xcite although the band structure gives no hint for this experimental finding .",
    "the discussion in the preceding paragraph shows that tr-2ppe experiments detect states which are obviously no band states ( which are single - particle states ) .",
    "consequently there has been some speculation in the literature about the origin of these states , most of which violate well established fundamental physical laws .",
    "the only explanation which is consistent in this respect and does involve only single - particle states is that electrons which originally had a momentum in the , e.g. , ( 110 ) direction are scattered from a ( 110 ) low - energy electron diffraction ( leed ) state into a , say , ( 100 ) leed state .",
    "this would explain why experiments measure the lifetime in this direction .",
    "however , the cross section for this process should be small .",
    "moreover , this mechanism would not explain the difference between the results of calculated lifetimes within the @xmath4 approximation and the experimental ones . in order to escape these difficulties cao _ et al .",
    "_ speculated @xcite that `` the strongly localized 3_d _ holes generated by photoexcitation of 3 _ d _ electrons can trap excited electrons through attractive coulomb interaction '' .",
    "we picked up this suggestion and outlined the physical mechanism of excitons in metals on a very short time scale , so - called transient excitons .",
    "@xcite in this article we present a model of how to actually calculate these states .",
    "now it is common wisdom that excitons exist in semiconductors and rare gases but not in metals .",
    "@xcite however , in these cases one is thinking of stationary conditions under which the valence electrons of the system have enough time to built up a polarization cloud . for large times",
    "the initial coulomb interaction between the hole and the electron transforms into a thomas - fermi - like potential in metals @xcite and a coulomb potential which is screened by the macroscopic dielectric constant in semiconductors @xcite . but this polarization needs a final time to be built up and it is during this time that transient excitons can exist .",
    "@xcite consequently transient excitons can not be detected with traditional photoabsorption spectroscopy .",
    "it needs modern tr-2ppe spectroscopy combined with the ultra - short laser pulses which are available nowadays .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ theory ] we present a model that allows us to calculate  and therefore proof the existence of  transient excitonic states . in the two following sections we apply this model to the jellium model and to real copper .",

    "in this section we present a model for the calculation of transient excitonic states .",
    "a complete treatment of the subject implies the solution of the bethe - salpeter equation ( bse ) @xcite using the time - dependent particle - hole potential @xmath5 as interaction .",

    "the excitonic energy levels were determined from the eigenvalues of a time - dependent potential at a fixed time .",
    "they therefore shift with time . however , in order to study the effects of this shifting in more detail one needs to solve the bethe - salpeter equation @xcite which describes the dynamics of the correlated electron - hole pairs .",

    "in addition to these single - particle states there are also a wealth of excitonic states .",
    "assuming that the lifetime of excitonic states is longer than the electronic lifetime of band states ( see sec .  [ lifetime ] )",
    "this explains the experimental finding that the lifetime of electrons in these two directions are very similar",
    ". it also explains why @xmath4 calculations  which only address electron - electron scattering of excited band states with valence states  reveal shorter lifetimes as compared with experiment .",
    "for both directions the eigenvalues were calculated using the total potential @xmath85 at @xmath105 fs . in the @xmath0 direction",

    "having shown the possibility of transient excitons in metals we want to close with some comments about the lifetime of electrons in these states . the dominating process which determines the lifetime of excited electrons in band states is electron - electron scattering . due to collisions with electrons of the valence band",

    "we conclude that the lifetime of these states is longer than in band states .",

    "in this article we presented a model which allowed us to calculate transient excitonic states in metals . the model was applied to jellium and to real cu .",
    "the results obtained within the jellium model describe how a ( nearly ) free electron system screens a localized positive charge .",
    "an analysis of the time - dependent total potential shows that the complete screening of the external charge takes 10 to 20 fs .",
    "this is the time needed until the polarizability is fully built up and in equilibrium . at this time",
    "the potential is nearly identical to the thomas - fermi potential .",
    "this near identity is caused by the fact that the screening process is completely determined by the plasmon excitations of the system .",
    "the contributions from single - particle transitions  which are always present in the response function for finite wave vectors  are negligible .",
    "the potential possesses bound states for the first 0.2 fs .",
    "the situation in cu is different since the imaginary part of the density - response function ( which is proportional to the loss function ) has no distinct plasmon peak .",
    "instead the density - response function of cu shows plasmon - like excitations originating from the _ d _ electrons .",
    "this double peak sits on top of a broad structure caused by single - particle transitions .",
    "the screening of a localized charge distribution is therefore faster .",
    "nevertheless , the total potential possesses bound states for small times . in our model calculation for the determination of excitonic energies these eigenvalues are plotted with respect to the lowest unoccupied band .",
    "we find that the excitonic energies are in the energetic region of states detected in the measurements of the lifetime of hot electrons in crystalline cu using tr-2ppe spectroscopy .",
    "it is important to stress that only experiments with very short laser pulses allow the detection of these states .",
    "our calculations explain thus the puzzling experimental fact of states which are no band states .",
    "we interpret them as transient excitons . with the coarse estimate of the lifetime of these states we are also able to explain the difference between the experimentally determined lifetime of hot electrons in the ( 110 ) direction with respect to the results of @xmath4 calculations",
    "; we think that the states probed in this direction are not band states but excitonic states .",
    "our model does not yet include the possibility to determine the exact lifetime of electrons in transient excitonic states .",
    "the model is only applicable up to the moment at which the electron is trapped in a bound state and an exciton is formed .",
