    "generally the simplification of cold plasma is unrealistic since matter within the light cylinder is strongly magnetized in corotation with the ns and highly relativistic .",
    "particles moving along the field lines have a lorentz factor @xmath227 , giving an effective plasma frequency @xmath228 where the right - hand side is summed and averaged over the positron and electron distribution functions @xcite .",
    "the relativistic case gives a much lower cutoff frequency , well below @xmath229 mhz @xcite .",
    "thus , despite the low frequencies involved the interplay between gr and plasma effects in pulsars may potentially be within observable ranges @xcite .",

    "the lack of persistent radio emission above @xmath232 mhz @xcite and the transient , highly - variable radio emission observed from a subset of these objects @xcite suggests that the density of plasma in the magnetospheres of magnetars is lower than in normal radio pulsars @xcite .",
