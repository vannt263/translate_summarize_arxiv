    "mickelsson algebras are natural objects used for the study of harish - chandra modules of real reductive lie groups .",
    "they appeared in @xcite first .",
    "their detailed study was later undertaken by zhelobenko @xcite who employed the theory of extremal projectors for reductive lie algebras due to asherova , smirnov and tolstoy @xcite .",
    "the mickelsson algebras were further studied by ogievetsky and the first named author of this article @xcite . in particular , these works dealt with the _ extremal cocycle _ on the weyl group of any reductive lie algebra , introduced in @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "a mickelsson algebra was defined by a finite - dimensional complex lie algebra @xmath10 and its reductive subalgebra @xmath11 . following",
    "@xcite we define mickelsson algebras in a more general setting .",
    "let us take any associative algebra @xmath12 over the complex field @xmath13 , containing the universal enveloping algebra @xmath14 as a subalgebra .",
    "suppose there is a vector subspace @xmath15 , invariant and locally finite under the adjoint action of @xmath11 , such that the multiplication map @xmath16 is bijective .",

    "take the right ideal @xmath20 of the algebra @xmath12 and consider the normalizer @xmath21 of this ideal .",
    "our mickelsson algebra @xmath22 is the quotient of the algebra @xmath23 by its two - sided ideal @xmath24 . in the case",
    "when @xmath25 , our @xmath22 becomes the mickelsson algebra considered in @xcite .",
    "consider the ring of fractions @xmath26 of the algebra @xmath12 relative to the set of denominators .",
    "take the right ideal @xmath27 of the algebra @xmath26 and its normalizer @xmath28 . then define the algebra @xmath29 as the quotient of @xmath30 by @xmath31 . unlike @xmath32 , the algebra @xmath29 admits a rather nice description . let @xmath33 be the nilpotent subalgebra of @xmath17 opposite to @xmath19 .",
    "let @xmath34 and @xmath35 be the corresponding left ideals of @xmath12 and @xmath36 . consider the quotient vector space @xmath37 .",
    "taking the elements of @xmath29 modulo @xmath38 defines a map @xmath39 .",
    "this map is bijective .",
    "the multiplication in @xmath29 can be described in terms of the vector space @xmath40 , by using the extremal projector for @xmath17 ; see subsection  1.2 .",
    "furthermore , according to @xcite the extremal cocycle corresponding to the weyl group of @xmath17 determines an action of the braid group of @xmath17 by automorphisms of the algebra @xmath40 .",
    "we call them the zhelobenko automorphisms of @xmath40 .",
    "this braid group action is closely related to the _ dynamical weyl group action _ of etingof , tarasov and varchenko @xcite .",
    "the adjoint action of the lie algebra @xmath17 on @xmath26 determines an action of the cartan subalgebra @xmath41 on @xmath40 .",

    "it shows that @xmath50 consists of all elements which have weight zero relative to @xmath43 , are invariant under the zhelobenko automorphisms of @xmath54 , and are also invariant under certain other automorphisms arising when the group @xmath44 is not connected ; see subsection 1.5 . here",
    "@xmath55 is regarded as a subspace of @xmath37 .",
    "the zhelobenko automorphisms do not preserve this subspace in general . thus using the ring of fractions",
    "@xmath26 is necessary for this description  of  @xmath56 .",
    "the present work is a continuation of @xcite and also of a series of our publications @xcite .",
    "the latter series has established correspondences between the zhelobenko automorphisms of certain algebras of the form @xmath42 discussed above , and the canonical interwining operators of tensor products of representations of yangians .",
    "these are the yangian @xmath0 of the general linear lie algebra @xmath1 , and its twisted analogues @xmath2 and @xmath3 corresponding to the symplectic and orthogonal subalgebras @xmath57 and @xmath8 of @xmath1 . for an introduction to these yangians see the recent book @xcite . the yangian @xmath0 is a hopf algebra while the twisted yangians @xmath2 and @xmath3 are one - sided coideal subalgebras of @xmath4 .",
    "these yangians admit homomorphisms to the rings of the form @xmath58 discussed above .",
    "moreover , together with the subalgebra @xmath59 , the image of each of these homomorphisms generates the corresponding ring of invariants @xmath60 .",
    "these homomorphisms first arose in the works of olshanski @xcite and are also discussed in our subsection 4.3 .",
    "another connection between the works @xcite and the theory of mickelsson algebras was used by molev to construct weight bases of irreducible finite - dimensional modules of the lie algebras @xmath57 and @xmath61 ; see for instance @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we combine the results of @xcite to give realizations of irreducible representations of the twisted yangians . in particular ,",
    "every irreducible finite - dimensional module of the twisted yangian @xmath2 will be realized , up to changing the action of the centre of this algebra , as the image of an intertwining operator between representations of @xmath2 in tensor products of exterior powers of @xmath62 . for the yangian @xmath4 ,",
    "such realizations have been provided by the works of akasaka and kashiwara @xcite and of cherednik @xcite .",
    "our work gives new proofs of these results for @xmath4 .",
    "for the twisted yangian @xmath5 , the images of our intertwining operators realize , up to changing the action of the centre of @xmath5 , all those irreducible finite - dimensional modules , where the action of the subalgebra @xmath63 integrates to an action of the complex special orthogonal lie group @xmath64 . now let @xmath65 be an arbitrary pair as described above .",
    "let @xmath66 be the zero weight component of the algebra @xmath12 relative to the adjoint action of @xmath43 .",
    "we denote by @xmath67 the subalgebra in @xmath42 generated by the image of @xmath68 under the projection @xmath69",
    ". then @xmath70 by definition .",
    "for any weight @xmath71 let @xmath72 be an irreducible @xmath73-module whereon the subalgebra @xmath74 acts via the mapping @xmath75 , extended to a homomorphism @xmath76 .",
    "then our proposition  [ proposition3.9 ] . gives sufficient conditions for irreducibility of the restriction of @xmath72 to the subalgebra @xmath77 .",
    "one of the conditions is that the weight @xmath78 is nonsingular . here",
    "@xmath79 denotes the half - sum of positive roots , and nonsingularity means that the value of @xmath78 on any positive coroot vector of @xmath18 is not a negative integer .",
    "our results on irreducibility of representations of the yangians @xmath4 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are based on proposition  [ proposition3.9 ] . by using the homomorphism @xmath80 determined by the projection @xmath53 , any irreducible",
    "@xmath81-module becomes an irreducible module over the algebra @xmath60 . by using the homomorphisms from the yangians to the algebras of the form @xmath58",
    ", we then obtain irreducible representations of these yangians .",
    "proposition  [ proposition3.9 ] is the main result of section 1 . in that section",
    "we also collect several other results on the algebra @xmath42 corresponding to an arbitrary pair @xmath47 .",
    "below we describe the contents of all other sections of our article in more detail .      in this article",
    ", we employ the theory of _ reductive dual pairs _ due to howe @xcite .",
    "namely , we use the pairs @xmath82 of complex reductive algebraic groups from the following list : @xmath83 it is the lie algebra @xmath84 of the group @xmath85 dual to @xmath44 that will determine our yangian @xmath86 .",
    "we will employ both the symmetric and skew - symmetric versions of the howe duality .",
    "let @xmath87 be the tensor product @xmath88 of vector spaces .",
    "the group @xmath89 acts on @xmath87 naturally , via its defining action on @xmath62 . in the symmetric case ,",
    "this action of @xmath85 is extended from @xmath87 to the weyl algebra of @xmath87 .",
    "the subalgebra of @xmath85-invariant elements in the weyl algebra then becomes a homomorphic image of the universal enveloping algebra @xmath14 where @xmath17 is the lie algebra of @xmath90 respectively . in the skew - symmetric case ,",
    "the action of @xmath85 on @xmath87 is extended from @xmath87 to the clifford algebra of @xmath87 .",
    "then the subalgebra of @xmath85-invariant elements in the clifford algebra becomes a homomorphic image of @xmath14 where @xmath17 is the lie algebra of @xmath91 respectively .",
    "thus the first pair in the list appears in both the symmetric and skew - symmetric cases , the next two pairs appear only in the symmetric case , while the last two pairs appear only in the skew - symmetric case .",
    "we will denote by @xmath92 either the weyl or the clifford algebra , and will distinguish the symmetric and the skew - symmetric cases by using a parameter @xmath93 which equals @xmath94 or @xmath95 respectively .",
    "the homomorphism @xmath96 will be denoted by @xmath97 .",
    "our algebra @xmath12 will be the tensor product @xmath98 .",
    "the algebra @xmath14 will be embedded into this tensor product diagonally : any element @xmath99 will be identified with the element of @xmath46 . the subspace @xmath100 will be then @xmath101",
    ". the group @xmath44 acts by automorphisms of the algebra @xmath102 , and the corresponding action of @xmath17 on @xmath92 coincides with the adjoint to @xmath97 .",
    "thus we get a ( diagonal ) action of the group @xmath44 by automorphisms of the algebra @xmath46 , obeying the assumptions from the beginning of this section . in subsection  2.1",
    "we summarize the properties of the homomorphism @xmath103 that we will use .    in subsection 2.2",
    "we introduce our main tool , the shapovalov form on the algebra @xmath42 corresponding to @xmath104 .",
    "it takes values in the ring of fractions @xmath105 of the algebra @xmath106 relative to the set of denominators .",
    "the algebra @xmath92 is generated by its two subspaces , @xmath87 and the dual @xmath107 .",
    "let @xmath108 be the subalgebra of @xmath92 generated by the subspace @xmath87 .",
    "then @xmath108 is the symmetric algebra of @xmath87 when @xmath109 , or the exterior algebra of @xmath87 when @xmath110 . for any @xmath111 let @xmath112 be the corresponding verma module of the lie algebra @xmath11 .",
    "there is a unique weight @xmath113 satisfying the condition .",
    "this weight is zero if @xmath114 , but differs from zero if @xmath115 or @xmath116 .    in subsection 2.3",
    "we take the space of @xmath19-coinvariants of the @xmath17-module @xmath117 .",
    "this space is denoted by @xmath118 .",
    "it is identified with a quotient space of the algebra @xmath12 by the right ideal @xmath119 and by a certain left ideal depending on @xmath120 , see the definition .",
    "if the weight @xmath121 is generic , that is if the value of @xmath121 on any coroot vector of @xmath18 is not an integer , then the @xmath122-valued shapovalov form on @xmath42 defines a @xmath13-valued bilinear form on @xmath118 .",
    "the latter form is denoted by @xmath123 .",
    "proposition  [ propositionsh14 ] relates the form @xmath124 to the extremal projector for the lie algebra @xmath11 . in subsection 2.4 for any @xmath71",
    "we take the subspace of weight @xmath125 in the space @xmath118 .",
    "this subspace is denoted by @xmath126 .",
    "if @xmath121 is generic , then we define a @xmath13-valued bilinear form @xmath127 on the subspace @xmath128 as the restriction of the form @xmath123 . letting the weights @xmath125 and @xmath129 vary",
    "while the difference @xmath130 is fixed , we extend the definition of @xmath127 to all @xmath129 such that @xmath78 is nonsingular , by continuity .",
    "thus here the weight @xmath121 needs not to be generic .",
    "this extension of @xmath127 corresponds to the _ fusion procedure _ of cherednik @xcite , see below for an explanation of this correspondence .",
    "our proposition [ proposition2 ] states that the quotient of @xmath131 by the kernel of the bilinear form @xmath127 is an irreducible @xmath73-module .",
    "this is the main result of section 2 .",
    "it shows that under the extra conditions of proposition  [ proposition3.9 ] the quotient of @xmath131 by the kernel of @xmath127 is an irreducible @xmath81-module , see corollary  [ corollary3.11 ] .    in subsection 2.5",
    "we give another construction of irreducible @xmath81-modules , by using the general results on the mickelsson algebras from our subsection 1.6 .",
    "let @xmath132 be the quotient of the verma module @xmath112 by its maximal proper submodule @xmath133 .",
    "take the space of @xmath19-coinvariants of weight @xmath125 of the @xmath11-module @xmath134 .",
    "we denote this space by @xmath135 . if @xmath78 is nonsingular",
    ", then @xmath136 is an irreducible @xmath73-module .",
    "moreover , then under the extra conditions of proposition  [ proposition3.9 ] the space @xmath136 is an irreducible @xmath81-module , see corollary  [ corollary3.11plus ] .",
    "note that then @xmath136 is an irreducible @xmath60-module by proposition [ knv ] .",
    "thus we extend the results of harish - chandra @xcite and of lepowski and mccollum @xcite .",
    "now take the space of @xmath19-coinvariants of weight @xmath125 of the @xmath11-module @xmath137 .",
    "we denote this space by @xmath138 .",
    "then @xmath136 can be regarded as the quotient of the space of @xmath131 by its subspace @xmath139 . in the case when @xmath78 is nonsingular while @xmath129 satisfies the conditions of proposition [ lmeq ] , the subspace @xmath140 coincides with the kernel of the form @xmath141 .",
    "hence the quotient of @xmath131 by the kernel of @xmath127 coincides with @xmath136 in this case . for each pair",
    "@xmath82 from the list , weights @xmath129 satisfying the conditions of proposition  [ lmeq ] will be produced later on , in section 4 .      in section 3",
    "we give another interpretation of the quotient space of @xmath131 by the kernel of @xmath141 , for any @xmath129 and nonsingular @xmath142 .",
    "the extremal cocycle corresponding to the weyl group @xmath143 of @xmath17 determines not only an action of the braid group of @xmath17 by automorphisms of the algebra @xmath40 , but also an action of the same braid group by linear operators on the vector space @xmath144 .",
    "we call them the zhelobenko operators on @xmath144 , see subection  1.4 . throughout this article",
    "the symbol @xmath145 indicates the shifted action of the group @xmath143 on @xmath146 , see .",
    "again suppose that the weight @xmath121 is generic .",
    "then the quotient space @xmath147 of @xmath12 can be identified with the quotient space of @xmath26 by the right ideal @xmath148 and by a certain left ideal . in subsection 3.1",
    "we describe the image of the quotient @xmath147 of @xmath26 under the action of the zhelobenko operator @xmath149 on @xmath150 , corresponding to any element @xmath151 . if @xmath152 then this image can be identified with @xmath153 .",
    "but if @xmath115 or @xmath154 then our description of the image is more involved , see corollary [ corolary2.13 ] . for @xmath152",
    "this result was obtained in @xcite . for @xmath115 or @xmath154",
    "it was obtained in @xcite . in subsection 3.1",
    "we give a new proof of this result , uniform for all these @xmath11 .    for generic @xmath121 the operator @xmath149 on @xmath155 maps the subspace @xmath128 of weight @xmath125 to the subspace of weight @xmath156 in the image of @xmath118 .",
    "our proposition [ proposition3.7 ] relates this map to the extremal projector for @xmath11 . letting the weights @xmath125 and @xmath129 vary while their difference @xmath130 is fixed , we extend the definition of this map to all @xmath129 such that @xmath78 is nonsingular , again by continuity ; see corollary [ corollary3.7 ] .",
    "thus the weight @xmath121 needs not to be generic anymore .",
    "yet if @xmath121 is not generic then the operator @xmath149 on @xmath155 does not necessarily define any map on the whole space @xmath157 . in subsection 3.3",
    "we consider the operator @xmath158 where @xmath159 is the longest element of @xmath160 .",
    "our proposition [ corollary3.8 ] states that the kernel of the corresponding map of @xmath131 coincides with the kernel of the bilinear form @xmath141 , for any @xmath129 and nonsingular @xmath142 . the proof is based on propositions [ propositionsh14 ] and [ proposition3.7 ] .",
    "corollary  [ corollary3.11 ] then implies that the quotient space of @xmath131 by the kernel of the map defined by @xmath161 is an irreducible @xmath81-module , under the extra conditions of proposition  [ proposition3.9 ] .",
    "moreover , then by proposition [ knv ] this quotient space of @xmath131 is an irreducible @xmath60-module .",
    "these are the main results of section 3 , they are stated as theorem [ theorem2 ] and corollary [ ircor ] .",
    "in section 4 we apply the results of section 3 to the representation theory of the yangians @xmath162 where @xmath163 according to . in subsection  4.1",
    "we fix realizations of the groups @xmath44 and @xmath85 appearing in , and define the corresponding homomorphisms @xmath164 .",
    "in subsection 4.2 we recall the definitions of the yangian @xmath0 and the twisted yangians @xmath165 .",
    "the latter two are defined as certain subalgebras of @xmath4 .",
    "their definition implies that they are also right coideals of @xmath4 , see .",
    "the twisted yangians @xmath166 can also be defined in terms of generators and relations , see and .",
    "the collection of all relations can be written as the _ reflection equation _ , introduced by cherednik @xcite and sklyanin @xcite .",
    "the algebras defined by the relations only , that is without imposing the relations , are called the extended twisted yangians .",
    "they are denoted by @xmath167 respectively .",
    "thus for @xmath168 we have a surjective homomorphism @xmath169 .",
    "its kernel is generated by certain central elements of @xmath170 , see subsection 4.2 for their definition . in proposition [ propo1 ] for @xmath171 and @xmath172",

    "thus @xmath125 and @xmath129 are determined up to the ( simultaneous ) shifted action of the group @xmath421 of @xmath1230 on them , as on elements of @xmath146 . using only the action of the subgroup @xmath2034 , we can choose @xmath125 to satisfy the conditions , so that the weight @xmath78 is nonsingular .    by using only the shifted action on @xmath129 of those elements of the subgroup",

    "the arguments are the same as in the end of subsection  5.4 , and we do not repeat  them  here .    now consider our intertwining operator corresponding to these @xmath125 and @xmath120 .",
    "due to theorem  [ drin5 ] , the quotient by the kernel of this operator is either a non - zero irreducible integrable @xmath5-module , or splits into a direct sum of two non - equivalent irreducible integrable @xmath5-modules . to any of the irreducible modules we associate the given polynomials",
    "it the quotient is irreducible , there is no label @xmath2057 associated to it .",
    "if the quotient splits into two irreducible modules , they have the labels @xmath2070 and @xmath2071 associated to them .",
    "therefore up to equivalence and similarity , every non - zero irreducible integrable finite - dimensional @xmath5-module arises either as such a quotient , or as one of its two direct summands .",
