    "the hipparcos astrometric satellite has provided very accurate positions , proper motions , and parallaxes for more than 118000 stars ( esa 1997 ) .",
    "does this mean that the long series of ground - based astrometric observations of all these stars are now merely of historical value ?",
    "this is certainly not the case : it can be shown that the combination of the hipparcos data with ground - based results is providing for many thousands of stars individual proper motions which are significantly more accurate than the hipparcos proper motions themselves ( wielen 1988 , wielen et al .",
    "1998 , 1999 ) .",
    "there are two main reasons why ground - based observations can improve the hipparcos results : ( 1 ) for many of the brighter stars , the ground - based observations cover a period of time of more than two centuries .",
    "the measuring accuracy of these ground - based positions is such that they allow , especially in combination with the hipparcos positions , to derive proper motions which have significantly smaller measuring errors than the hipparcos proper motions .",
    "it is well - known that ground - based observations suffer from considerable systematic errors .",
    "however , it is just the hipparcos catalogue itself which allows us to remove these systematic errors from the ground - based data to such a high degree that we can use with much confidence the corrected ground - based results for the direct combination with hipparcos .",
    "( 2 ) the hipparcos proper motions are derived from observations which have been carried out within about three years only . since many of the hipparcos stars are undetected astrometric binaries , these nearly ` instantaneously ' measured hipparcos proper motions can differ significantly from ` time - averaged ' , ` mean ' proper motions . we have called the difference between the instantaneous hipparcos proper motion and the mean motion of a star the ` cosmic error ' of the hipparcos proper motion ( wielen 1997 ) . in many cases these cosmic errors are significantly larger than the measuring errors of the instantaneous hipparcos proper motions ( wielen 1995a , b , wielen et al .",
    "1997 , 1998 , 1999 ) .",
    "the ground - based observations , with their long observational history , are often already providing ` mean ' proper motions .",
    "the ground - based data allow us therefore to identify and to correct partially the cosmic errors in the hipparcos proper motions .",
    "having argued that a combination of ground - based observations with the hipparcos data is useful for many stars , we now provide a method for carrying out such a combination .",
    "the best way would be to combine the individual observational catalogues of ground - based positions directly with hipparcos .",
    "however , there exists more than 2000 of such observational catalogues . while we have collected most of these catalogues in our astrometric data base arigfh ( described in wielen ( 1998 ) ) and hope to use them individually in the future , we have to rely for the moment on a few compilation catalogues .",
    "such a compilation catalogue is usually based on a large number of observational catalogues and provides as a ` summary ' of these individual catalogues a derived proper motion and a mean position at a central epoch .",
    "the most accurate of the ground - based compilation catalogues is the first part of the fk5 ( fricke et al .",
    "it contains the 1535 basic fundamental stars .",
    "the second part of the fk5 ( fricke et al . 1991 ) lists 3117 additional stars in the bright and faint extension .",
    "a compilation of the remaining fk4sup stars ( schwan et al . 1993 ) provides data for further 995 stars with a good observational history .",
    "the combination of the basic fk5 stars with hipparcos data produces the fk6 .",
    "the proper motions of the fk6 are of unprecedented accuracy ( wielen et al .",
    "1998,1999 , and sect .",
    "the accuracy of these fk6 proper motions rests to a high degree on the older observations .",
    "this is not only to be expected on theoretical grounds , but can be proved empirically also ( wielen et al .",
    "1998 ) by combining hipparcos with an older fundamental catalogue such as the fk3 ( kopff 1937 , 1938 ) . because the old observations carry most of the weight in a combination with hipparcos , the gc ( boss et al . 1937 ) is also relevant for our purpose .",
    "the gc is a careful compilation of ground - based observations from the 18th century until about 1930 .",
    "the main advantage of the gc is its large number of stars .",
    "about 29700 of the 33342 gc stars have been observed by hipparcos and can therefore be used in our method . the typical accuracy obtained for a",
    "gc star is , of course , lower than for an fk6 star ( wielen et al .",
    "1998 , 1999 ) .    instead of using a _ compilation _ catalogue ,",
    "we may rely on one old _",
    "observational _ catalogue only , such as the astrographic catalogue ( ac ) . however , the formal accuracy of the proper motions obtained by a combination of the ac with the hipparcos data is in most cases only marginally better than that of the hipparcos proper motions alone . on the other hand , a comparison of a proper motion derived from an ac position and a hipparcos position with the quasi - instantaneous hipparcos proper motion",
    "@xmath0 can reveal the occurence of a large value of the cosmic error in @xmath0 for the star under consideration .    before we can combine the ground - based data with hipparcos",
    ", the systematic errors of the ground - based positions and proper motions have to be determined and removed .",
    "for the determination of these systematic errors we use methods developed for the construction of the fk5 ( bien et al .",
    "these methods do not only provide the systematic errors themselves but also the local uncertainty of the correction , i.e. the mean ` measuring ' error of the systematic correction for a given star .",
    "as the reference system , we use the hipparcos system .",
    "the combined catalogue is therefore always on the hipparcos system , i.e. on the icrs . for our purpose",
    ", we can consider the hipparcos data as free from systematic errors . a possible slight rotation of the hipparcos system with respect to an inertial",
    ", extragalactic system does not affect our method ( but of course our results ) .    in the following sections , we assume that the angular coordinates of a star , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , change linearly in time @xmath3 . in practice , the non - linear motion of a star in @xmath4 and @xmath2 because of spherical effects and the foreshortening effect has to be taken into account . we do this already in the determination of the systematic errors between the ground - based data and hipparcos .",
    "later we do not use the full values of ground - based positions and proper motions , but only their differential values with respect to the hipparcos solution at the proper epoch .",
    "if we use these differential values only , the linear approximation is then fully sufficient for our purpose .",
    "we shall now present the mathematical details of our combination method .",
    "we offer two approaches : an approximate analytic one and a rigorous numerical one .",
    "the analytic approach has the advantage to show more clearly the basic principles .",
    "it neglects , however , some of the correlations which occur among the hipparcos results . in practical applications ,",
    "we use the numerical approach which takes all the correlation among the hipparcos results into account . in all cases , we assume that the hipparcos data are completely uncorrelated with the ground - based data .",
    "this is certainly true for all of our stars , although the hipparcos input catalogue , used as a first approximation in the hipparcos data reduction procedure , had to rely on the ground - based observations .",
    "we assume that two astrometric catalogues are available .",
    "they are identified by the indices 1 and 2 .",
    "examples are the fk5 and hipparcos . for the combined catalogue ,",
    "e.g. the fk6 , we use the index c. each of the two basic catalogues ( i=1 , 2 ) provides for all the stars under consideration a position @xmath5 and a proper motion @xmath6 at a central epoch @xmath7 for two uncorrelated coordinate components , e.g. for @xmath4 and @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , both catalogues provide mean errors of @xmath5 and @xmath6 which we denote by @xmath8 and @xmath9 .    in the case of a catalogue which has been reduced to the hipparcos system , the errors @xmath8 and @xmath9 have to take into account also the local uncertainty of the systematic corrections , e.g. by using @xmath10 , where the ` individual ' error @xmath11 is the random measuring error given in the catalogue .",
    "we should emphasize that @xmath12 is not the systematic correction itself but only its uncertainty .",
    "the central epoch @xmath7 is chosen such that the correlation between @xmath5 and @xmath6 is zero at @xmath13 .",
    "most of the ground - based catalogues give the central epoch @xmath7 explicitely for each star , separately for @xmath14 and @xmath2 .",
    "for hipparcos ( index 2 ) we have to derive @xmath15 ( separately for @xmath4 and @xmath2 ) from the data given in the catalogue : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the overall reference epoch of the hipparcos catalogue , @xmath18 the mean error of @xmath19 , @xmath20 the mean error of @xmath0 , and @xmath21 the correlation coefficient between @xmath22 and @xmath0 .",
    "the position @xmath23 is derived from @xmath24 the mean error of @xmath25 is given by @xmath26 the proper motion has not to be recalculated , i.e. @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the hipparcos position and proper motion , @xmath25 and @xmath29 , are now uncorrelated , i.e. @xmath30 . in the analytic approach",
    ", we assume that the values of @xmath25 and @xmath29 between @xmath4 and @xmath2 are also uncorrelated .",
    "this is not strictly true because our choice of @xmath31 ( separately for @xmath4 and @xmath2 ) forces only one correlation coefficient to vanish .",
    "all the other correlation coefficients of the hipparcos data remain finite ( albeit small ) in general .",
    "practical experience shows that this approximation is quite good for most stars ( see sect .",
    "we are now prepared to carry out the combination of the two catalogues .",
    "the basic idea of the combination is to reconstruct the normal equations of the least - square solutions from which the two catalogues have been derived .",
    "this can be done by using only the data actually given in the two catalogues .",
    "these two sets of normal equations are then added together to provide the normal equations for the combined catalogue c. our method is a generalisation of methods described by kopff et al .",

    "a comparison of the mean errors of the combined quantities with those of hipparcos shows the following : ( 1 ) there is a significant gain in the accuracy of the proper motion which justifies the combination of hipparcos results with ground - based data . in our example , the mean errors of the combined proper motions are smaller than those of the hipparcos proper motion by a factor of 1/4.4 in @xmath150 and of 1/3.9 in @xmath151 .",

    "in order to show the overall improvement in the accuracy of the proper motions obtained by using our combination method , we present here the statistics of the appropriate mean errors for a few samples of stars .",

    "the error budget of all the basic fk5 stars is slightly fictious in so far as this sample also contains binaries which can not be safely treated by a direct combination method . nevertheless , the error budget for the 1535 stars is still a valid indicator for the overall accuracy of our combination method .",
    "the error budget for the 1202 stars is slightly biased in favour of the hipparcos catalogue , since most of the stars for which especially hipparcos is less accurate than usually ( e.g. , c solutions for visual binaries ) are removed from this sample .",
