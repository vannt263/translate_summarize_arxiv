    "in recent decades , first - principles ( fp ) calculations with density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite have been widely adopted in studies of the structural , thermoelastic , rheological , and electronic properties of materials , molecules , and minerals in research areas that range from physics and chemistry to biology and geosciences @xcite .",
    "the modern implementation of fp techniques is based on different approximations , such as the pseudopotential ( pp ) method , the expansion of electronic wavefunctions by modal functions , and the choice of exchange - correlation ( xc ) functionals . as a result , the predictions made by different fp calculations may differ from one another moderately .",
    "many techniques have been developed to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of fp calculations .",
    "examples include the projector - augmented wave ( paw ) method @xcite , and maximally localized wannier functions @xcite . however , due to inadequate knowledge , the exact form of exchange - correlation functional remains unknown and the search for a precise xc term has been an active area of research .",
    "the choice of xc in fp calculations has been shown to be the main reason for the inconsistencies between these various calculations @xcite .",
    "in particular , the pressures calculated by generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) @xcite and local density approximation ( lda ) @xcite are known to be systematically over- and underestimated , and a common way to choose the xc functional is to use the xc that gives the best agreement with experiments .    in this article , we investigate the way in which such a pressure difference depends on volume and temperature .",
    "if this difference can be quantified , simulations can be performed using either exchange - correlation , and at the same time , obtaining the results of the other .",
    "this would be an efficient way of constraining the thermodynamic quantities .",
    "for example , @xcite calculated the elastic properties of @xmath0 at pressures up to the lower mantle condition using lda , which gave an equilibrium volume and elastic constant consistent with experiments @xcite .",
    "however , calculations by @xcite on @xmath0 have shown that the gga gives an extremely accurate elastic constant and the volume dependencies of the elastic properties , although the pressure is overestimated .",
    "the authors thus applied a constant pressure shift to the equation of state ( eos ) estimated by gga and then matched the measured ambient pressure eos , which resulted in an excellent match between the experimental observations and the fp calculation results .",
    "to quantify the relationship between the pressure difference and the xc functionals , we first consider the total internal energy of a system , which is contributed by the interaction energy between particles and the total kinetic energy of the ions and electrons . at thermal equilibrium , this total internal energy is given by @xmath1{\\big   \\rangle},\\label{total.e } \\label{total energy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 denotes the ensemble average , and @xmath3 and @xmath4 represent ionic and electronic degrees of freedom .",
    "also , @xmath5 and @xmath6 represent the mass and charge of the @xmath7th ion .",
    "the last term @xmath8 $ ] is the kohn - sham energy functional of the ion - electron system . within adiabatic approximation , @xmath8 $ ]",
    "is given by dft , and @xmath9 depends on the configuration of ions for bulk systems .",
    "the first and the second terms in eq .",
    "( [ total energy ] ) are the classical kinetic and coulomb energy of the ions . for a crystal system with small oscillation of ions , one can write @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are respectively the equilibrium position and the ( small ) displacement from @xmath11 of the @xmath7th ion .",
    "in addition , we can assume that each ion is under the influence of an effective local potential , given by @xmath13 .",
    "here @xmath14 is the effective force constant , which includes the contributions from ion - ion and electron - ion interactions , and @xmath15 is the component of displacement ( @xmath16 ) . as a result , the total internal energy [ eq .",
    "( [ total energy ] ) ] can be approximated by @xmath17 + { \\big \\langle}\\sum_{i,\\alpha}\\frac{1}{2}k_{i,\\alpha}(\\delta r_{i,\\alpha})^2{\\big \\rangle}\\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\langle t \\rangle + u^0_{\\rm ion } + e^0_{\\rm ks } + \\langle \\delta e\\rangle , \\label{total.e.approx}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which could be understood as the sum of zero - temperature energies ( quantities with superscript 0 ) and the contribution due to thermal motions of ions ( quantities with @xmath2 ) .    in first - principles calculations , @xmath18 and @xmath19",
    "depend on the choice of xc functional , whereas @xmath20 equals @xmath21 regardless of the choice of xc , because the ionic motions are treated classically .",
    "therefore , eq .  ( [ total.e.approx ] ) can be written as , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the total dft energy of the system .",
    "we now consider the internal energy calculated by two different choices of xc , say xc@xmath24 and xc@xmath25 , the difference between @xmath26 is given by @xmath27 as @xmath28 only depends on the equilibrium ionic configuration , it does not contribute to @xmath29 .",
    "moreover , @xmath30 should be equal to @xmath21 , because @xmath31 is regarded as a classical degree of freedom and @xmath32 at thermal equilibrium .",
    "therefore , @xmath33 becomes @xmath34 which depends solely on the system volume .",
    "more importantly , the difference between the calculated pressures , given by @xmath35 ( where @xmath36 represents the entropy of the system ) should be , in general , a function of @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "however , according to eqs .",
    "( [ delta.e.vt ] ) and ( [ delta.e.v ] ) , although both @xmath39 and @xmath40 depend on temperature , their difference , @xmath41 should not .",
    "consequently , the resultant difference in pressure should also be temperature independent , that is , @xmath42",
    "to illustrate the relationships in eqs .",
    "( [ delta.e.v ] ) and ( [ delta.p.v ] ) , we perform fp calculations on periclase mgo at thermodynamic conditions that range from ambient conditions to pressures and temperatures that are close to those of a deep earth environment .",
    "periclase mgo has a face - centered cubic structure and is known to be stable in the pressures and temperatures being considered in this work . therefore ,",
    "structural changes , such as phase transition and melting , are avoided .",
    "the eos at each temperature are determined by first - principles molecular dynamics simulations . for each simulation ,",
    "the simulation supercell consists of 64 atoms ( 32 mgo units ) .",
    "these atoms were first arranged in a face - centered cubic ( fcc ) configuration , and the atomic trajectories and electronic orbitals were evolved via car - parrinello molecular dynamics ( cpmd ) @xcite , with the temperature controlled by the nos thermostat technique @xcite , at @xmath38 = 300  k , 1000  k , 2000  k , ... 4000  k , at various cell volumes .",
    "the calculations are repeated using both lda and gga exchange - correlations .",
    "the pressures determined at each temperature are fitted against the third - order birch - murnaghan eos @xcite . as a result , two eoss at each temperature",
    "are obtained , one lda and one gga .",
    "the choice of the xc energy functional is implemented in the generation of the pseudopotentials . in this study ,",
    "two pairs of pseudopotentials for mg and o are generated , one pair generated using lda and the other using gga .",
    "apart from this difference in xc , all of the other parameters , such as the cutoff radius and the valence states , are the same . for mg ,",
    "a norm conserving pseudopotential @xcite with nonlinear core correction @xcite is used , whereas for o an ultrasoft @xcite pseudopotential is used .",
    "the reference configuration is 3s1.5 3p0 3d0 for mg and 2s2 2p2 for o. for cpmd , a fictitious electron mass @xmath43 @xmath44 and a simulation time step of @xmath45   atomic time units ( @xmath46 fs ) are used .",
    "electronic wavefunctions are expanded by planewaves with a cutoff of 30 ry , and the cutoff for charge density is 240 ry . to ensure enough statistical data , the simulations are run for more than 4  ps at each @xmath37 , @xmath38 point",
    "the eos given by our lda and gga calculations are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the results are fitted against the third - order birch - murnaghan eos , with @xmath47 @xmath48 , @xmath49  gpa , and @xmath50 for lda and @xmath51 @xmath48 , @xmath52  gpa , and @xmath53 for gga . to ensure that our calculations are compatible with existing results , we compare our results with those obtained by @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the bulk moduli for each eos are shown in fig .  2 .",
    "we recalculate the static eos of @xcite by using the same pp files as in their work @xcite , and the recalculated static eos is in excellent agreement with their published eos parameters .",
    "in addition , such eos was shown to be highly consistent with the experimental measurements at moderate pressures ( @xmath54 gpa ) .",
    "therefore , fig .  1 and fig .  2",
    "illustrate the discrepancy that arises from different methodologies , such as the implementation of pp , the choice of xc functionals , and the interaction potentials .",
    "k are joined for visualization . ]     at each temperature .",
    "note that the pressure difference is in the order of 10 gpa , and the maximum difference between these points is about 1 gpa , which is negligible in dft - based calculations .",
    "the pressure difference for @xmath55 k is fitted against @xmath56 with @xmath57 gpa @xmath48 and @xmath58 gpa @xmath59 for visualization . ]    at first glance , this discrepancy appears to reduce as the system volume increases .",
    "this is because both the pseudopotential errors and the difference between the xc functionals become less significant as atomic separation increases . also , the gga - calculated pressure and the bulk modulus in this work deviate systematically from those of lda .",
    "in addition , our gga results are more compatible with those estimated in ref .",
    "27 and ref .",
    "28 than our lda calculations .",
    "this indicates that the gga calculation should , in principle , be closer to the experimental measurements . the mg pp used in ref .",
    "27 was optimized by using a combination of various electronic configurations , and a norm - conserving o pp was used . nevertheless , the optimization of a pp configuration is the subject of further study .",
    "we concentrate on the errors introduced by the xc alone .",
    "according to eq .",
    "( [ delta.e.vt ] ) , it is intuitive to calculate the difference in energy at each temperature and volume . in fig .  3",
    ", we plot the difference in energy , @xmath60 , against @xmath37 at each temperature and find that it does not depend on temperature .",
    "this is consistent with the prediction of eq .",
    "( [ delta.e.v ] ) .",
    "the differences between the pressures estimated by lda and gga at each temperature , @xmath61 , are shown in fig .",
    "4 . as can be seen , the differences in pressure at all temperatures almost coincide , with a maximum deviation of about 1  gpa , which is much smaller than the typical statistical error in pressure estimated by the dft - based calculations .",
    "this is again in accordance with the conjecture of eq .",
    "( [ delta.p.v ] ) , and the pressure difference should be independent of temperature . within the pressure range we have examined ( 0 gpa @xmath62 170 gpa ) , @xmath63 behaves asymptotically as a polynomial of @xmath64 , that is , @xmath65    here , a few comments are in order .",
    "the present analysis implies that the thermodynamic quantities , such as internal energy and pressure , calculated by fp methodologies with a particular xc functional can easily be transformed into those obtained by another choice of xc functional .",
    "for example , the difference in heat capacity , given by @xmath66 at each volume should vanish because @xmath67 does not depend on temperature .",
    "this implies that the heat capacity calculated by any xc should be the same .",
    "in addition , the grneisen parameter , @xmath68 calculated by different xc functionals should also be the same . here",
    "@xmath69 and @xmath70 are , respectively , the coefficient of thermal expansion and the isothermal bulk modulus .",
    "to prove the statement , we consider the following thermodynamic relation , @xmath71 therefore , eq . ( [ gruneisen ] )",
    "can be written as @xmath72 as a result , the difference in the grneisen parameter , @xmath73 should vanish either .",
    "the present estimation of pressure and energy differences is based on calculations of the cubic mgo structure . in principle",
    ", our analysis should be valid for any crystal system with small oscillation of ions , although the corresponding fp calculations may require extra care in the estimation of pressure .",
    "although not shown in this work , our preliminary calculations on mgsio@xmath74 perovskite and post - perovskite phases @xcite support our proposed theory . for a non - cubic crystal structure",
    ", a finite strain may introduce shear stress to the system .",
    "in such a case , the eos should be determined by cell dynamics algorithms @xcite .",
    "it should also be noted that our conclusion on the pressure correction relies on the assumption that the thermal contribution to the total internal energy is governed by classical mechanics .",
    "however , this may not be valid in situations where quantum mechanical interactions , such as phonon vibration should be taken into account .",
    "in particular , at extremely low temperatures , long range acoustic phonon modes play an important role in various thermodynamic phenomena .",
    "nevertheless , recent works on structural phase transition in mgsio@xmath74 at core - mantle boundary conditions @xcite and postspinel transition in mg@xmath25sio@xmath75 @xcite have shown that high - temperature thermodynamic properties estimated by phonon - based calculations should not depend on the choice of xc functionals , as long as quasiharmonic approximation ( qha ) remains valid in the thermodynamic conditions of interest .",
    "for example , different choices of xc functionals only affect the position of the estimated phase boundaries in these works but not the clapeyron slopes .",
    "in addition , the recent theoretical study of ultrahigh - pressure eos of mgo @xcite has also shown explicitly that , within the qha validity regime , the difference between a lda - eos and a gga - eos is independent of temperature .",
    "more importantly , it should be noted that qha requires the vibrational amplitude of each atom to be small , which is the major assumption of our pressure correction conjecture .",
    "as a result , the work of @xcite ubiquitously supports our hypothesis of pressure correction , even the fp methodologies used ( lattice dynamics ) in this work are different from ours ( car - parrinello molecular dynamics ) .",
    "the validity and behavior of @xmath63 are also subjects for further investigation . in the pressure range",
    "we have investigated , @xmath63 is finite and is well approximated by eq .",
    "( [ series ] ) , which implies that the pressure difference should increase with a decreasing volume . however , this is not valid either when @xmath37 approaches infinity ( @xmath76 ) or when @xmath37 becomes vanishingly small ( @xmath77 ) . in the former case , the system consists of isolated atoms , and the energy difference that is due to different xc is constant ; as a result @xmath63 is zero as @xmath76 . in the latter case ,",
    "the inter - atomic distance approaches zero , the interacting electrons should be well described by the free electron gas model , and lda and gga should give the same pressure .",
    "last but not the least , the present study focuses on the pressure correction due to the chosen xc functional , which is in opposite to the idea of _ volume correction _ suggested by @xcite , in which an eos is corrected to match experimental data .",
    "a combination of these eos corrections will make various fp - based results more transferable , thus allowing one to have an effective recipe to transform the calculated thermodynamic quantities from one condition to another .",
    "to conclude , by using mgo as a prototype system , we have studied the discrepancy in pressure that is due to different choices of xc functionals in dft calculations .",
    "we have found that the differences in energy and pressure for gga and lda calculations should be independent of temperature . as a result",
    ", one may easily constrain the xc error at arbitrary temperatures .",
    "this may lead to a better estimation of thermodynamic properties , such as heat capacity and the grneisen parameter , in the systems that are being investigated by the fp and high - pressure communities .",
