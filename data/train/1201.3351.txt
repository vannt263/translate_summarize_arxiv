    "nuclei located far away from the valley of @xmath4-stability display peculiar features that do not occur for well bound nuclei .",
    "the strong coupling to the continuum manifests itself in the existence of halo configurations , where some nucleons orbit far away from a core of more tightly bound nucleons , and of borromean systems , where removal of one nucleon is accompanied by at least one more nucleon .",
    "the neutron - rich helium isotopes @xmath5 and @xmath6 offer two examples of such nuclei : both are borromean halos that have no bound excited states .",
    "they also exhibit the `` binding - energy anomaly '' , _",
    "i.e. _ , higher one- and two - neutron emission thresholds in @xmath7 than in @xmath1 .",
    "halo configurations are characterized by a large nuclear radius compared to the size of the tightly bound core or , equivalently , by a small nucleon separation energy compared to the core binding energy .",
    "the physics of halo nuclei is a perfect arena for the application of effective field theory ( eft ) .",
    "efts provide a powerful framework to exploit separation of scales in physical systems in order to perform systematic , model - independent calculations .",
    "if , for example , the relative momentum @xmath8 of two particles is much smaller than the inverse range of their interaction , @xmath9 , using contact interactions observables can be expanded in powers of @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the application of eft to halo and cluster systems , halo / cluster eft ( h / ceft ) , was first exemplified in low - energy neutron - alpha particle ( @xmath11 ) scattering @xcite . even though there is no bound state",
    ", the @xmath11 @xmath12 matrix has a resonance pole at an energy @xmath13 mev much smaller than the @xmath14 mev it takes to excite the alpha particle .",
    "the physics in the p wave is closely related to halo dynamics , because the ground state in @xmath15 can in a first approximation be described as an @xmath11 system in the p@xmath2-wave configuration , which has the qualitative characteristics of a two - body halo nucleus .",
    "h / ceft captures these features at leading order ( lo ) , and provides at next - to - leading order a good description of @xmath11 scattering @xcite .",
    "h / ceft has also been successfully applied to other dilute two - body systems such as low - energy @xmath16 @xcite and proton-@xmath17li @xcite scattering , radiative neutron capture on @xmath17li @xcite , and the electric properties of @xmath18be @xcite .",
    "the natural follow up to ref .",
    "@xcite is to consider the next halo system within the helium isotope family , that is , @xmath1 .",
    "this is the aim of the present paper .",
    "since the @xmath1 ground state is bound by only @xmath19 mev , it is appropriate to assume that it can be described as the three - body system @xmath20 .",
    "the @xmath11 interaction is that studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , while the @xmath21 force is a contact interaction determined by the low - energy @xmath21 scattering parameters @xcite .",
    "it is well understood that the physics of three - body systems can be much richer than the physics of its two - body subsystems .",
    "a famous example is the efimov effect which occurs for non - relativistic particles with short - range interactions : if the s - wave scattering lengths of its subsystems are tuned to infinity , there can be an infinite sequence of three - body bound states that has an accumulation point at the three - body threshold @xcite .",
    "a closely related phenomenon is the thomas effect @xcite , where a finite - range two - body potential that is only attractive enough to support a single two - body bound state can produce three - body bound states with arbitrarily large binding energies as the range goes to zero . in eft at a given order , the thomas effect is a consequence of an inappropriate omission of a three - body force .",
    "as it has been demonstrated for s - wave two - body interactions @xcite , a three - body force is necessary and sufficient for renormalization - group ( rg ) invariance at lo , allowing three - body energies to be independent of the ultraviolet regulator .",
    "the parameter associated with this force then provides a scale for the remaining discrete scale invariance , which reflects itself in the efimov spectrum .",
    "the structure of @xmath22c and other two - neutron halos with s - wave neutron - core interactions was discussed using h / ceft in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the situation with p - wave interactions is less clear .",
    "there is debate over whether the efimov effect can be realized in this case see ref . @xcite and references therein .",
    "the main issue to be addressed below is whether a three - body force is needed at lo so that the eft description of @xmath1 is properly renormalized .    a microscopic description of weakly bound / unbound nuclei requires taking into account the interplay between bound states , scattering states , and resonances . in other words ,",
    "these systems have to be described as open quantum systems ( oqss ) , in contradistinction with well - bound nuclei , which are nearly isolated from the environment of scattering states and decay channels ( `` closed quantum systems '' ) .",
    "a recent realization of the shell model for oqss is the so - called gamow shell model ( gsm ) @xcite .",
    "the gsm is based on the berggren basis @xcite , which consists of bound , resonant and scattering single - particle wave functions generated by a finite - depth potential , and provides the mathematical foundation for unifying bound and resonant states the poles of the @xmath12 matrix in the context of the schrdinger equation .",
    "the gsm has been used @xcite to study the properties of the helium isotope family using a phenomenological @xmath11 potential and a residual two - neutron interaction adjusted to few - body energies .    in this paper",
    "we use the formalism of the gsm to solve the schrdinger equation describing the dynamics of @xmath1 with the contact interactions of h / ceft , including a possible three - body force .",
    "we focus on the binding energy of the @xmath0 ground state .",

    "the small relative momentum means that neutron and alpha particle see each other , in a first approximation , as elementary objects . at lo",
    "there is only one contribution , which is in the p@xmath2 channel , and the `` dimeron '' potential projected onto this channel can be written as @xmath31 where @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) is the incoming ( outgoing ) relative momentum and @xmath34 in terms of the total energy @xmath35 of the @xmath11 subsystem . @xmath36 and @xmath37 are parameters . since this interaction is singular , a regularization procedure is introduced in form of an ultraviolet cutoff @xmath38 .",
    "the cutoff separates the short - distance physics , which is not included explicitly in the dynamics at low energies , and the long - distance physics , which is .",
    "this is here achieved by introducing a smooth regulator function @xmath39 whose role is to suppress the high - energy contributions of the potential .",

    "we have seen that , at leading order , two - body forces are not sufficient to properly renormalize the three - body system , even though they provide a systematic expansion for two - body scattering @xcite .",
    "indeed , as the cutoffs are increased the energy of the three - body ground state does not stabilize and would collapse for an arbitrarily large cutoff .",
    "we have shown that the addition of a single three - body counterterm is enough to achieve renormalization - group invariance , as for systems with s - wave interactions @xcite .",
    "we have obtained the rg running of the coupling constant by demanding that the binding energy be fixed at its experimental value .",
    "our work paves the way for more comprehensive studies of halo nuclei with h / ceft . for the future",
    ", we plan to carry out a more extensive investigation of @xmath1 , including higher - order corrections and calculation of other observables ( such as the ground - state radius and the first excited - state energy ) . at the cost of more computational resources ,",
    "other members of the @xmath197 isotope family could be investigated as well , along the lines of refs . @xcite .",
    "more generally , we hope that the combination of eft and gsm will prove to be a valuable tool in the study of other three - body resonant states , such as the hoyle state in @xmath198 .",

    "<S> we combine halo / cluster effective field theory ( h / ceft ) and the gamow shell model ( gsm ) to describe the @xmath0 ground state of @xmath1 as a three - body halo system . </S>",

    "<S> the three - body dynamics of the system is solved using the gsm formalism , where the continuum states are incorporated in the shell model valence space . </S>",
    "<S> we find that in the absence of three - body forces the system collapses , since the binding energy of the ground state diverges as cutoffs are increased . </S>",
    "<S> we show that addition at leading order of a three - body force with a single parameter is sufficient for proper renormalization and to fix the binding energy to its experimental value .    </S>",
