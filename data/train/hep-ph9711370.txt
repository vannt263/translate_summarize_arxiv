    "the complete elucidation of nuclear dynamics in terms of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is still forthcoming .",
    "this elucidation involves a meeting in the middle of two complementary efforts . on the one hand , using mainly symmetry patterns and the wealth of low energy experimental data , nuclear physicists have been able to construct models valid for different regimes and deduce relationships between these models . on the other hand , since the early 1970s it has become increasingly clear that nuclear processes are the emergent phenomena of the dynamics of quarks and gluons ( qcd ) . that these threads can be pursued independently has been demonstrated by the quantitative success of nuclear models without any knowledge of qcd and the subsequent widespread acceptance of qcd largely on the basis of high energy behavior that appears to have little or no bearing on nuclear phenomena .",
    "but in the middle there ought to be some confluence .",
    "indeed , though the details are still murky , qcd does dictate that quarks and gluons are _ confined _ into hadrons within a region of about 1 fermi .",
    "thus the qcd degrees of freedom at lower energies are transformed into the familiar nuclear degrees of freedom .",
    "one can then begin with a model of quarks and mesons at the confinement scale and ask what relationship each of the parameters has with qcd parameters .",
    "the form of the low energy dynamics is strongly constrained by _ chiral symmetry _ and its breaking in the hadronic sector .",
    "the small departure from chiral symmetry is a consequence of the smallness of the up and down quark masses with respect to the qcd scale @xmath3-@xmath4 .",
    "this can be exploited to construct an effective field theory for low energy qcd or what has been termed _",
    "chiral perturbation theory _ ( @xmath5pt ) . here",
    "the picture is based on a sigma model whose parameters are determined phenomenologically .",
    "the question arises , however , how to relate the parameters of the effective low energy theory to those of short distance qcd .",
    "intermediate to addressing this problem it is a desideratum to compute the scale dependence of parameters of simple models which incorporate the chiral symmetry breaking patterns of qcd .    in the present work we solve the gell - mann ",
    "levy @xmath0-model @xcite nonperturbatively using renormalization group ( rg ) flow equations where projections onto _ momentum independent _ couplings at each momentum step are made @xcite .",
    "this is equivalent to truncating the derivative expansion to leading order ( lo ) , an approximation sometimes referred to as the `` local potential approximation '' .",
    "a small quark mass is introduced at the ultraviolet scale to break chiral symmetry .",
    "the free parameters of the model can be constrained by infrared observables allowing modest predictive power .",
    "the main result of the calculations , detailed below , are predictions of @xmath2 scattering lengths which are significant improvements over tree - level calculations and are consistent with experiment as well as with lattice and chiral perturbation theory results @xcite .",
    "the present paper summarizes many of the results reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section [ rev ]",
    "we briefly outline the history of the rg approach to field theories . in section",
    "[ der ] , our derivation of the rg flow equations for the @xmath0-model is sketched . the numerical technique for solving the flow equations",
    "is then outlined , our approach to constraining the parameters are discussed , and the results presented in section [ num ] . a summary and some extensions to the model",
    "are considered in section [ con ] .",
    "three technical appendices include derivations of results used in the text .",
    "the renormalization group equation upon which this work is based was first derived by wilson and kogut @xcite and wegner and houghton @xcite in two different but equivalent ways .",
    "wilson and kogut derived their equation using a so - called `` smooth cutoff '' between integrated and unintegrated modes .",
    "their rationale was to avoid nonlocalities that naturally arise in position space when one makes sharp divisions in momentum space .",
    "the price paid for this approach is that unconstrained smoothing functions must be introduced to facilitate the integrations .",
    "these smoothing functions complicate the equations and make their solution  even after drastic approximations ( _ e.g. _ the leading order ( lo ) in the derivative expansion . )",
    "impossible analytically .",
    "there are also unphysical dependencies on the detailed form of the smoothing function .",
    "the so - called `` sharp - cutoff '' method of wegner and houghton @xcite is simpler in that there are no smoothing functions to contend with , but nonlocal effects are now present .",
    "another problem with this approach is that there appear to be ambiguities in the form of the rg equations that depend on a variable change at a particular point in the derivation @xcite .",
    "however , at least to leading order ( lo ) in the derivative expansion , there is no ambiguity with the sharp cutoff approach which we employ in this paper .",
    "one can imagine many different ways to approximate the exact rg equations .",
    "a natural approximation scheme involves expanding the action in powers of momentum , or  in real space  in powers of derivatives of the fields . after integrating over field components corresponding to momenta in the uv momentum shell , the leading order ( lo ) approximation",
    "is then obtained by setting all of the remaining components equal to zero except for the uniform component .",
    "( this is sometimes called the `` local potential approximation '' ( lpa ) . )",
    "the next to leading order ( nlo ) result is obtained by keeping one small momentum and so on .",
    "the lo approximation to the full rg equations appears first in the work of nicoll _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "hasenfratz and hasenfratz @xcite , in an early seminal work , showed that the rg equations approximated using a method equivalent to lo in the derivative expansion give interesting and nontrivial results .",
    "they solve for the rg flows of the effective potential in a pure scalar theory and extract critical exponents to compare with calculations performed by other means . for @xmath6 they find impressive agreement for the critical exponents @xmath7 and @xmath8 . also for @xmath9 they find no nontrivial fixed point solution which is consistent with the triviality of @xmath10 field theories .",
    "their work showed that even the lo approximation gives a rich quantitative description of the critical properties of strongly - coupled scalar field theories .",
    "there has been a recent resurgence of interest in the rg effective action approach to scalar field theories .",
    "hasenfratz and nager @xcite study the cutoff dependence of the higgs mass using rg methods .",
    "wetterich and co - workers @xcite , essentially extend the work of hasenfratz and hasenfratz to nlo use a smooth cutoff procedure .",
    "this allows them to include the effects of wavefunction renormalization and compute the critical exponent @xmath11 which they find to be in rough agreement with other calculations .",
    "morris @xcite studies approximations to the exact rg as derived using both smooth and sharp cutoffs and in ref.@xcite computes critical exponents to nlo noting that the scheme appears to converge . in ref.@xcite",
    "the so - called sharp cutoff ambiguities are treated in detail and the de of the effective action is reviewed in @xcite .",
    "alford @xcite , with an eye toward the electroweak phase transition , computes exponents with a sharp cutoff procedure and discusses some of the practical difficulties involved with extending the calculations to nlo . in an extensive rg and monte carlo analysis of general scalar field theories , shepard _ et al . _",

    "in addition the inclusion of fermions has been addressed in the literature recently .",
    "maggiore @xcite includes fermions via a generalized yukawa term and derives lo flows for the scalar and generalized yukawa potentials .",
    "he finds no evidence that the fixed point structure of the theory is affected by the addition of fermions . in a more comprehensive study , clark and co - workers",
    "@xcite derive the exact rg equations for theories of arbitrary field content and derive from this equation the lo flows for the scalar and generalized yukawa potentials which agree with the results of ref.@xcite .",
    "in two related papers clark _ et al . _ study the issue of computing mass bounds for scalars and fermions in the standard model @xcite and the stability of fine tuned hierarchies @xcite . in related work , ellwanger and vergara @xcite use rg flow equations for generalized njl models to study the higgs top quark system to leading order in @xmath12 .",
    "other work pertaining to the higgs top system appears as ref.@xcite .    in an effort paralleling this work jungnickel and wetterich @xcite have applied renormalization group methods to the generalized @xmath0-model . in one sense",
    "their work is more ambitious than the present work .",
    "they have considered the general su(n ) sector with all allowable functions of the field invariants and included via a smooth cut - off the nlo quantities which allow treatment of the anomalous dimension .",
    "but the price paid for such generality is an abundance of free parameters , some non - physical , which are difficult to constrain .",
    "in contrast , the present work focuses exclusively on the su(2 ) sector which requires only one field invariant , uses a sharp cut - off approach as in ref.@xcite truncated at leading order in the derivative expansion . while this precludes any treatment of the strange - quark sector or the anomalous dimension , there are fewer parameters which can be well constrained by experimental data allowing modest predictive power for the theory .",
    "there is now ample evidence in the literature that the leading order approxiamtion to the rg flow of a field theory incorporates correctly many of the intricacies of strong - coupled quantum field theories .",

    "we will not convert it directly into a functional differential equation ( as clark _",
    "@xcite do ) until we consider its form for a particular action .",
    "a terminology has grown up around equations such as ( [ erga ] ) .",
    "the `` @xmath42 '' term is generally referred to as the `` loop '' term and the `` @xmath43 '' term is referred to as the `` tree '' term .",
    "this is because the contribution from the @xmath43 term is present in mean field theory whereas the contribution from the @xmath42 term includes effects from loop integrations @xcite .    for the purposes of treating the @xmath0-model we consider only real scalar and spinor fields ( _ i.e. _ @xmath44 ) .",
    "if the flow equations are truncated to lo in the derivative expansion , many simplifications ensue .",
    "the source column vector becomes , @xmath45 where , @xmath46 the matrix of second derivatives is , @xmath47 now we can rewrite the superdeterminant appearing in eq.([erga ] ) using some tricks from appendix [ appendixa ] ( compare with eq.([appa ] ) ) , @xmath48 ( where @xmath49 ) which gives , @xmath50 ( the @xmath51 coming from the counting in the momentum sums due to the _ real _ @xmath24 . ) now eq.([erga ] ) becomes , @xmath52    restricted to lo in derivatives the last ( `` tree '' ) term in this equation may be neglected .",
    "one way to see this diagrammatically is to note that any particular contribution to the tree term in eq.([erga ] ) or ( [ ergaa ] ) will be comprised of external legs connected by a single _ internal _ propagator with momentum in the shell ( see fig . [ tree ] ) . since to",
    "lo we set the momentum of all external legs to zero , these diagrams can not conserve momentum at their vertices and therefore vanish . to make the argument analytically we write a particular term of @xmath53 , @xmath54 where @xmath55 is in the shell .",
    "when , in going to lo we set all field components , @xmath56 , with nonzero momentum to zero , it s clear that this term and all higher order terms will vanish .",
