    "coxeter transformations play an important role in the development of lie group and lie algebra theory . for a compact lie group , a coxeter transformation or a coxeter element is defined to be the product of all the reflections in the root system initially . h. s. coxeter studies these elements and their eigenvalues in @xcite .",
    "he also observes that the number of roots in the corresponding root system is equal to the product of the order of the coxeter transformation ( called the coxeter number ) and the number of eigenvalues of the coxeter transformation , which is proved by a. j. coleman in @xcite .",

    "they also prove the following : if the tits form is indefinite and degenerate , then the number of two - dimensional jordan blocks coincides with dimension of the kernel of the tits form , and the remaining jordan blocks are @xmath5 .",

    "there is a nice survey @xcite on this subject and recent development + the coxeter transformation is also important in the study of representations of algebras , quivers , partially ordered sets ( posets ) and lattices , see @xcite . its distinguished role in these areas is related to the construction of the coxeter functors @xmath8 ( see @xcite ) and given by i. n. bernstein , i. m. gelfand and v. a. ponomarev in @xcite . given any path algebra @xmath9 with finite global dimension , let @xmath10 be the cartan matrix .",
