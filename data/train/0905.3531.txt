    "there has been a steady improvement in the precision and the variety of the data for deep - inelastic and related hard - scattering processes .",
    "global parton analyses of these data allow the partonic structure of the proton to be quantified with ever - increasing accuracy .",
    "analyses are now possible at next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) in the running strong coupling @xmath12 .",
    "indeed , the accuracy is such that the theoretical formalism needs to consider effects at the level of @xmath13 .",
    "one area which needs careful treatment at this level of accuracy is the strong coupling itself .",
    "this applies both to the definition of the coupling , and to the uncertainties associated with it .",
    "the definition of @xmath0 is not unique and different definitions can give noticeable differences in the results . in the recent `` mstw 2008 '' global fit  @xcite",
    "we changed the definition of the strong coupling compared to that used in previous `` mrst '' analyses .",
    "we discuss the technical details of this change in detail in the appendix .",
    "however , the main emphasis of this article is the issue of the uncertainty on parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) and derived quantities such as cross sections , arising from the uncertainty in the strong coupling @xmath0 .",
    "this is a non - trivial , and sometimes significant , source of uncertainty which is often not considered when extracting pdfs from global fits or when calculating uncertainties on hadronic cross sections . _",
    "is _ included in the theoretical uncertainty on predicted cross sections . ]",
    "the interplay of the pdfs , their uncertainties and @xmath0 is both interesting in itself and important for making precise cross section predictions , and in this paper we give the first comprehensive account of this subject .",
    "the recent mstw analysis  @xcite ( using an improved definition of @xmath0 ) was based on the obtained `` best - fit '' values of the strong coupling , i.e.  the values obtained by minimisation of a global goodness - of - fit quantity , @xmath14 , simultaneously with the pdf parameters at an input scale @xmath15  gev@xmath16 . in the nlo and nnlo global pdf fits , the values were found to be @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "in addition to the best - fit pdfs and corresponding best - fit @xmath0 values , we also determined a set of eigenvector ( `` error '' ) pdf sets , designed to span the variation in the parton distributions allowed by the uncertainties on the data included in the global fit .",
    "we introduced and used a new `` dynamic tolerance '' method for determining 68@xmath19 or 90@xmath19 confidence - level ( c.l . )",
    "error pdfs , which is an extension of an earlier method introduced in the cteq6 analysis  @xcite .",
    "then the prediction and corresponding uncertainty for a physical quantity @xmath20 that depends on the pdfs , such as a cross section at a hadron ",
    "hadron collider , is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 ^ 2}.\\ ] ] here , @xmath23 is the central pdf set , and @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) are the eigenvector pdf sets , with @xmath26 in the mstw 2008 analysis  @xcite . to illustrate our method and its results",
    ", we used as examples in ref .",
    "@xcite the total cross sections for @xmath27 and @xmath8 production at the tevatron and lhc , i.e.  we computed the theoretical predictions for the total cross sections and their corresponding pdf uncertainties , @xmath28 .",
    "however , the pdf sets obtained in this previous study are only defined for the particular values of @xmath4 found by the best fit . if the user has a preferred ( different ) value of @xmath4 then pdfs determined with that particular value in the global analysis should strictly be used .",
    "hence , in this paper we provide best - fit pdfs for a range of values of @xmath4 .",
    "this is a straightforward matter of repetition .",
    "however , when considering _ uncertainties _ on pdfs and on physical quantities the process is more involved .",
    "the _ true _ theoretical uncertainty on a predicted cross section should also include a contribution from the allowed variation of @xmath0 about its best - fit value .",
    "this is particularly important for cross sections that at leading - order are proportional to a power of the coupling , for example , @xmath29 for production via gluon ",
    "gluon fusion at the tevatron and lhc . a nave way of doing this would be to define the overall theory error as @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the cross section variation when @xmath0 is allowed to vary within some range , determined , for example , by its world - average error , for a fixed set of pdfs .",
    "however , it is not consistent to use different values of @xmath0 in the partonic cross section describing the hard subprocess and in the pdf evolution .",
    "moreover , in a global pdf analysis , there are non - negligible correlations between the pdfs and the value of the strong coupling . for example",
    ", the evolution of the structure function @xmath32 at small @xmath33 is driven by the combination @xmath34 , and so a large value of the coupling will correspond , in principle , to a smaller gluon distribution at low @xmath33 .",
    "this is indeed observed in practice .",
    "this pdf@xmath0 correlation has been known for some time , and indeed early global analyses derived a series of best - fit pdfs for a set of discrete @xmath0 values spanning a given range , for example , @xmath35  @xcite .",
    "other relevant studies have been made by the cteq group  @xcite .",
    "however , given that the precision of the data used in global analyses has increased significantly in recent years , with a corresponding reduction in the error on both the pdfs and on @xmath0 , a more sophisticated approach is now required , that is , one in which ( i ) the allowed variation of @xmath0 is determined by the data , and ( ii ) the correlation between the variation in @xmath0 and in the pdfs is fully taken into account .",
    "the latter would be very difficult to achieve if @xmath4 and its uncertainty were taken as externally determined quantities rather than obtained directly from the fit .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the interplay between uncertainties on @xmath0 and uncertainties on parton distributions in the framework of the recent mstw 2008 analysis  @xcite .",
    "we show how both these sources of uncertainty can be properly accounted for simultaneously in calculations of cross sections .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec : desc ]",
    "we discuss how the description of each data set included in the global fit depends on the value of @xmath0 . in section  [ sec : unc ] we determine the @xmath36 ( that is , the 68@xmath19 c.l . ) and 90@xmath19 c.l .",
    "uncertainties on @xmath4 as determined in the nlo and nnlo global analyses . for 2598 data points is significantly worse than those at nlo and nnlo , and therefore there is no statistically meaningful constraint on @xmath0 at this order . as discussed in ref .",

    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",

    "for example , the bcdms data on @xmath50 prefer @xmath4 values around 0.110 . with the global best - fit @xmath0 , @xmath32 in the region",
    "@xmath51 falls too quickly with increasing @xmath38 for the bcdms data , particularly for low @xmath38 ( and hence low inelasticity @xmath52 ) , and so a lower @xmath0 is preferred since it gives a flatter @xmath38 slope .",
    "data points from bcdms are strongly affected by the energy scale uncertainty of the scattered muon .",
    "it has been advocated to impose a cut of @xmath53 on the bcdms data , which caused @xmath4 to increase by about 0.004 in a fit to only bcdms data and by about 0.002 in a combined fit to h1 and bcdms data  @xcite .",
    "] by contrast , the nmc @xmath50 data sets prefer @xmath0 values somewhat larger than the global average , since the increase of these data with @xmath38 is quicker than the default fit at nlo for @xmath54 , so a bigger @xmath0 increases the evolution speed ( as do nnlo corrections , hence this problem is reduced at nnlo ) .",
    "peculiarly , the e665 data , particularly @xmath55 , show the opposite trend to the nmc data in the same region of @xmath33 , and therefore the e665 data prefer low @xmath0 values at nnlo ( with the nlo fit giving a better description ) .",
    "note also from fig .",
    "[ fig : nnloscanasmzc ] that within the full global fit the h1 and zeus @xmath43 data ( mostly at small @xmath33 ) have minima at slightly high values of @xmath56 , implying that slightly stronger evolution than with the overall best fit is preferred .",
    "a similar relative feature is found at nlo .",

    "@xcite ) .",
    "we find that the preference of the inclusive hera data for high @xmath0 values holds also when we perform a nlo fit to these data alone , which at first sight seems to contradict previous findings by h1  @xcite and zeus  @xcite indicating a preference for low values of 0.115 and 0.110 , respectively , although each with a large uncertainty , when fitting only to inclusive data .",
    "relatively low values of @xmath0 are also preferred by the inclusive hera 96/97 data sets in the cteq global analysis  ( see fig .  4 of ref .",
    "however , the low-@xmath33 gluon distribution is strongly anticorrelated with @xmath0 .",
    "the input gluon parameterisation in the h1  @xcite , zeus  @xcite and cteq  @xcite analyses was assumed to have the form @xmath57 at low @xmath33 , whereas the more flexible mstw  @xcite ( and mrst  @xcite ) input gluon parameterisation is effectively a sum of two powers at low @xmath33 , where the second term is required by the fit to be negative , at the input scale @xmath58  gev@xmath16 .",
    "we find that a nlo fit to only inclusive hera data using a restricted input gluon parameterisation , with the second term omitted , gives @xmath59 ( with a large uncertainty ) .",
    "repeating the _ global _ fits gives @xmath60 at nlo and @xmath61 at nnlo .",
    "however , the global @xmath62 is worse by 63 at nlo and by 80 at nnlo , so the more flexible low-@xmath33 gluon parameterisation is clearly required ( particularly for the pdf uncertainties , see section 6.5 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . since the cteq pdfs",
    "are input at the slightly higher @xmath63  gev@xmath16 , and other sets have even higher input scales , the effect of only having a single power for the gluon parameterisation will be reduced compared to our above example . however , the general feature of a reduction in @xmath4 due to a restricted parameterisation is very likely to persist to a greater or lesser extent .",
    "the data set that exhibits particularly anomalous behaviour , where @xmath64 is significantly reduced for larger @xmath4 , is the d run ii @xmath65 charge asymmetry ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : nnloscanasmzd ] .",
    "we have already pointed out the difficulties of fitting these data in the standard nlo and nnlo global analyses ( see section  11.1 and fig .",
    "44 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , with both fits yielding a @xmath66 of 25 for 10 data points .",
    "we also noted that the asymmetry is sensitive to the separation into valence and sea quarks , particularly at lower lepton @xmath67 .",
    "indeed , this explains the behaviour of @xmath64 with @xmath4 : as @xmath4 increases , the valence quarks evolve more rapidly at high @xmath33 than the sea quarks , and the @xmath7 asymmetry is reduced . for @xmath68 at nnlo ( or @xmath69 at nlo ) the decrease in @xmath64 is approximately 15 , and a good fit is obtained",
    ". however , such large @xmath4 values are completely inconsistent with most of the other data sets in the global analysis ( and with other determinations of @xmath0 ) .    [",

    "[ fig : scanasmz_selected ] we compare the nlo and nnlo @xmath64 profiles for those data sets where there are notable differences between the two fits .",
    "specifically , the @xmath64 profiles for the h1 and zeus @xmath45 data , the nmc / bcdms / slac @xmath41 data and the e866/nusea @xmath70 drell  yan cross sections are clearly more quadratic at nnlo than at nlo , with minima closer to the best - fit values .",
    "this indicates a strong preference for the nnlo description , which is not so apparent if only the global best - fit values @xmath66 are known .",
    "let us give the reasons for this , taking each of these data sets in turn .",
    "the @xmath64 minimum for the @xmath45 data at nnlo is consistent with the global average value of @xmath4 , whereas a minimum is not even visible in the nlo plot .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that at nnlo the value of @xmath71 is lowered compared to the nlo value .",
    "the preference of the @xmath45 data for this is borne out by comparing both the values of @xmath66 at each order and the shape of the profile , i.e.  the nlo fit tries to flatten the slope with a lower coupling .",
    "the nnlo coefficient functions for @xmath72  @xcite are positive and significant , and similarly the nlo fit tries to mimic these with a higher value of @xmath4 .    the explanation of the different nlo and nnlo profiles for the e866/nusea @xmath70 drell  yan cross sections , seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : scanasmz_selected ] , is more complicated .",
    "the positive nnlo correction  @xcite requires an increased e866/nusea normalisation ( 1.09 at nnlo compared to 1.01 at nlo , cf .  the 1-@xmath73 normalisation uncertainty of 6.5% ) , with a correspondingly larger @xmath46 penalty ( 3.2 at nnlo compared to practically zero at nlo ) . when varying @xmath4 in the range shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scanasmz_selected ] , the @xmath46 penalty term due to the fitted normalisation of the drell  yan data set is negligible at nlo ( @xmath74 unit ) , while it increases dramatically at nnlo when increasing @xmath4 from the best - fit value , reaching 22 units when @xmath75 , i.e.  a sizeable proportion of the total increase in @xmath46 relative to the best - fit @xmath0 .",
    "the drell  yan data slightly prefer a higher value of @xmath0 at nlo than the global best - fit value , while at nnlo a lower value of @xmath0 is preferred mainly in order to reduce the @xmath46 penalty term due to the fitted normalisation .",

    "this tendency for the bcdms data to bring the value of @xmath4 down was well - illustrated in the hera - lhc `` benchmark '' fits  @xcite , where both the data sets chosen and the cuts applied led to the bcdms data carrying a high weight .",

    "@xcite it was shown that removing the tevatron jet data results in the best - fit value of @xmath4 at nlo falling only from 0.1202 to 0.1197 .",
    "it is more the case that the inclusion of the jet data can alter the shape of the gluon distribution obtained in a fit to only deep - inelastic scattering data , which indirectly affects the value of @xmath4 , or can turn a low value of @xmath4 with large uncertainty into a much better constrained higher value , as in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in addition to the data fitted , the differences seen in table  [ tab : asmzcompare ] between the experimental uncertainties on @xmath4 obtained by different groups can be traced partly to the different methods used for error propagation and in particular to the choice of the tolerance , @xmath81 .",
    "for example , the large cteq uncertainty corresponds to @xmath118 compared to the mstw values of @xmath119@xmath120 , gjr / jr use @xmath121 at nlo / nnlo respectively , while the other groups fit a smaller range of data and use @xmath122 .",

    "then @xmath4 is lowered by @xmath126 , at the expense of a slightly worse description of the d run ii data , as discussed in section 12 of ref .",
    "alekhin  @xcite has estimated the theory uncertainty on @xmath4 determined from fits to deep - inelastic scattering data due to scale dependence to be @xmath127 at nlo and @xmath128 at nnlo .",
    "@xcite estimated a similar uncertainty on their @xmath4 determination from h1 and bcdms proton data to be @xmath129 , and zeus  @xcite also obtained @xmath129 from varying the scale only for the jet data included in their fit .",
    "a simple estimate of the theory uncertainty can be obtained by taking the difference between the nlo and nnlo determinations of @xmath4 .",
    "this gives @xmath5 , which could be considered to be a minimum theory uncertainty at nlo and a maximum theory uncertainty at nnlo .",
    "it coincides with the estimate at nlo quoted in the mrst 2001 analysis  @xcite and the estimate at nlo obtained from scale variation by alekhin  @xcite .",
    "it is also of the same order as changes invoked by introducing models of higher - order corrections or changing the cuts on data at nlo  @xcite , which to us seems to be one of the most reliable estimates .",
    "it is probably an overestimate at nnlo and more quantitative studies are needed .",
    "however , at nnlo the estimates from changing data cuts and introducing models for theoretical corrections  @xcite suggested that variations in @xmath4 are distinctly lower than at nlo , and that perhaps @xmath130@xmath131 would be more appropriate .",
    "hence , to be conservative we estimate a nnlo theoretical uncertainty of at most @xmath132 , a slightly larger value than that obtained from scale variation at nnlo by alekhin  @xcite to account for the more complicated global fit .",
    "following on from our method of determining pdf uncertainties using the hessian method , we might consider simply letting @xmath4 be another free parameter when diagonalising the covariance matrix of the fit , resulting in 42 rather than 40 eigenvector pdf sets , each with a slightly different value of @xmath0 .",
    "we do not follow this approach for various reasons .",
    "the first of these is because the coupling does not quite sit on an equal footing with the input pdf parameters .",
    "let us consider a superposition of different eigenvector pdf sets .",
    "the linear nature of the dglap evolution equations means that any linear combination of pdfs , all with a common value of @xmath4 , is also a well defined pdf set evolving precisely according to the dglap evolution equations .",
    "consequently , the precise linear combination is the same whatever the factorisation scale at which we sample the pdfs .",
    "but if the eigenvector pdf sets in the superposition have differing @xmath4 , then this picture for linear combinations is not preserved .",
    "a linear combination of pdfs evolving with different @xmath4 values do not evolve in precisely the same manner as one single pdf set with a fixed @xmath0 , i.e.  they do not follow precisely a real trajectory in pdf space .",
    "this is not a problem in the particular case of using the eigenvector pdf sets to map out the uncertainty band , since each is used independently .",
    "however , it is an issue when rediagonalising the hessian matrix , such as in ref .",
    "@xcite , where , from a well - defined starting point , the new eigenvector pdf sets would not correspond to a particular pdf set which evolves in _ precisely _ the manner prescribed by the evolution equations . since the whole hessian method is based on manipulating linear combinations of perturbations in pdf parameters , which to first order in the taylor expansion is equivalent to manipulating linear combinations of pdf sets , we find this feature troubling , even though it would certainly be a small effect in practice .",
    "there are also more practical reasons why we reject the option of simply including @xmath0 as an extra parameter in the hessian matrix .",
    "we limit ourselves to 20 eigenvectors because a larger number of free input pdf parameters leads to too large correlations , and to a breakdown of the quadratic behaviour of the global @xmath62 distribution in some eigenvector directions  @xcite .",
    "a free @xmath0 would introduce more correlation between parameters , and reduce the stability of the eigenvectors , a feature we prefer to avoid .",
    "finally , this approach would limit the uncertainty analysis to an expansion about the single best - fit pdf set , with a unique value of @xmath0 .",
    "we acknowledge that the user may prefer more flexibility than this , and might wish to utilise pdf sets including uncertainties for a variety of different values of @xmath0 .",
    "hence , we provide eigenvector pdf sets with different , but fixed , @xmath0 values to allow studies of this sort . in the rest of this section , we give the details of our extraction of pdfs with uncertainties at different @xmath0 values , and examples of our recommended use of them will be given in section  [ sec : cross ] .",
    "here we just note that as we go away from the best - fit value of @xmath4 , the fit quality is automatically deteriorating , so that the pdfs can not vary as much before the fit quality becomes unacceptable .",
    "it is an automatic result of our procedure that the pdf uncertainty shrinks as @xmath4 deviates from the preferred value determined by the global fit .",

    "there is more than one definition of the strong coupling @xmath12 beyond lo commonly used in qcd phenomenology .",
    "the various prescriptions are all formally equivalent since they differ only at higher orders .",
    "the strong coupling @xmath12 runs according to the renormalisation group equation ( rge ) : @xmath293 where the @xmath294-function coefficients up to nnlo are @xmath295 the form of @xmath12 used in all previous mrst fits is given by @xmath296 where @xmath297 is defined as the solution of the rge , eq .  , which can be rewritten as @xmath298 where @xmath299 , @xmath300 and @xmath301 .",
    "the solution of this equation in terms of an input parameter @xmath302 is  @xcite @xmath303 note that @xmath12 defined by eq .",
    "is continuous across the flavour thresholds , and that the fitted parameter @xmath302 used in solving eq .",
    "is independent of the number of active flavours @xmath304 .",
    "this is different from other common prescriptions where it is necessary to choose @xmath302 to be @xmath304-dependent to ensure the continuity of @xmath12 .",
    "the mrst prescription , eq .  , for @xmath12 is numerically very similar at nlo to the other two principal definitions in use , provided that the same input value @xmath4 is taken  @xcite .",
    "however , the value of @xmath302 determined using one prescription for @xmath12 should not be used in a different prescription .",
    "for example , the mrst relation between @xmath302 and @xmath12 differs from the pdg relation  @xcite , which also differs from the cteq relation  @xcite .    by differentiating eq .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath12 at lo satisfies the rge exactly , and at nlo there is an additional higher - order term of @xmath305 , which is sufficiently small to be beyond the desired accuracy .",
    "therefore , the mrst definition eq .   is formally valid at lo and nlo , but not at nnlo .",
    "in addition , at nnlo , the strong coupling in the @xmath1 scheme is discontinuous at the heavy flavour thresholds , @xmath306 , where @xmath307 is the pole mass of the heavy quarks , i.e. @xmath308 these discontinuities in @xmath0 were not taken into account in any of the mrst nnlo fits , including the mrst 2006 nnlo analysis  @xcite where the corresponding discontinuities in the pdfs were included for the first time .",
    "( it is theoretically possible to modify eq .   to be correct up to nnlo , but only via a much more cumbersome and unattractive relationship . ) moreover , rather than use the solution of eq .",

    "<S> we do not address in detail the issue of the additional theory uncertainty on @xmath4 , but an estimate is @xmath5 at nlo and at most @xmath6 at nnlo . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the interplay between uncertainties on @xmath0 and uncertainties on parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) . </S>",
    "<S> we show , for the first time , how both these sources of uncertainty can be accounted for simultaneously in calculations of cross sections , and we provide eigenvector pdf sets with different fixed @xmath0 values to allow further studies by the general user . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate the application of these pdf sets by calculating cross sections for @xmath7 , @xmath8 , higgs boson and inclusive jet production at the tevatron and lhc .    </S>",
