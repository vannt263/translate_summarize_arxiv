    "<S> the holstein - primakoff representation for spin systems is used to derive expressions with solutions that are conjectured to be the zeros of hermite polynomials @xmath0 as @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this establishes a correspondence between the zeros of the hermite polynomials and the boundaries of the position basis of finite - dimensional hilbert spaces .    </S>",
    "<S> the hermite polynomials are prevalent in many fields . </S>",
    "<S> they can be defined as @xmath2 in the physics community , they are perhaps best recognized as the gaussian - weighted eigenfunctions ( in position representation ) of the quantum harmonic oscillator ( with @xmath3 , a convention that will be used for the rest of the paper ) : @xmath4 as such , they are orthogonal over the gaussian - weighted whole domain , @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this last property allows their use in gaussian quadrature , a useful and popular numerical integration technique where @xmath6 is approximated as @xmath7 where @xmath8 are the zeros of @xmath0 and @xmath9 is a well - behaved function . for this and many other reasons , </S>",
    "<S> an analytic formula for the asymptotic zeros of hermite and other orthogonal polynomials has been a subject of much interest@xcite , especially in the applied mathematics community and the field of approximation theory .    in this paper , </S>",
    "<S> i examine the position state representation of the eigenstates of finite dimensional @xmath10-spin systems , as expressed in the holstein - primakoff transformation . as @xmath11 , </S>",
    "<S> the system becomes the infinite dimensional harmonic oscillator . </S>",
    "<S> this association allows me to derive the simple main results presented in eqs  [ eq : evenzeros ] and [ eq : oddzeros ] , with solutions that i conjecture become the asymptotic zeros of the hermite polynomials ( as @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , i numerically show that this convergence is rather quick and so the expressions can frequently be used , in many instances of finite - precision application , as the effective zeros of @xmath0 with finite @xmath12 , such as in applications of gaussian quadrature . in a more aesthetic sense </S>",
    "<S> , these results also establish a beautiful correspondence between the boundaries of equal area partitions of circles with radii that are increasing in a certain manner and the hermite polynomial zeros .    </S>",
    "<S> spin systems are defined by the fundamental commutation relations between operators @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 :    @xmath16 = \\hat s^+ , \\hskip 5pt \\left [ \\hat s^z , \\hat s^- \\right ] = \\hat s^- , \\hskip 5pt \\left [ \\hat s^+ , \\hat s^- \\right ] = 2 \\hat s^z.\\ ] ]    associating a spin with a boson @xmath17 , holstein and primakoff showed that to satisfy these commutation relations , the operators can be expressed as@xcite    @xmath18    @xmath19    this is a very useful association and has found many applications in the condensed matter field s study of many - body spin systems . </S>",
    "<S> each boson excitation represents the `` ladder up '' finitesimal excitation away from the spin s extremal @xmath10 state . </S>",
    "<S> the hilbert space is finite - dimensional and possesses @xmath20 states @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , considering eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : hkladder ] it is clear that the hilbert space outside this defined space is not even hermitian .    transforming from the holstein - primakoff bosonic representation to position ( and its conjugate momentum ) space ( using the relations @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) reveals that the trivial hamiltonian is the harmonic oscillator : @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , transformation of the @xmath14 and @xmath15 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : hkladder ] reveals that the hilbert space spans the domain @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> just as in the @xmath26 representation , @xmath27 states all with the same area must exist within this domain . </S>",

    "<S> the radius of the hilbert space s domain is equal to @xmath32 and so grows along with the number of allowed basis elements . ]    for a particular @xmath10-spin system , the lowest eigenstate must have the same sign at all @xmath33-basis elements since it must be nodeless . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , the highest eigenstate must have @xmath34 nodes and so the @xmath33-basis elements must alternate in sign such that the eigenfunction passes through zero between them . </S>",
    "<S> this latter behavior is sketched in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : qbasis ] in red by the hermite polynomial @xmath0 denoting the value of the overlying @xmath33-basis element for the highest eigenstate .    for @xmath11 , </S>",
    "<S> the hilbert space becomes infinite - dimensional and the hamiltonian becomes that of the harmonic oscillator defined over @xmath35 with the associated eigenfunctions proportional to @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> it therefore follows that as @xmath11 , the boundaries of the @xmath33-basis elements become the zeros of the hermite polynomial @xmath0 where @xmath37 since the highest eigenstate must still have alternating sign with each @xmath33-basis element .    </S>",
    "<S> hermite polynomial zeros @xmath8 are real and symmetric around @xmath38 . to determine these boundary points , the @xmath39-dimensional hilbert space s circular shape in position space can be exploited . for even @xmath39 , the area of the all the @xmath33-basis elements up until the @xmath40th boundary ( measuring from the origin ) is @xmath41 . for odd @xmath39 , </S>",

    "<S> the approximate @xmath40th zero is at the right boundary of these regions . ]    using simple relations for the area of circle sectors and rectangles , it is possible to relate these @xmath33-basis element areas to @xmath8 ; the equation involving the approximate zeros of hermite polynomials @xmath44 with @xmath12 even is : @xmath45 while for odd @xmath12 it is : @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 .    solving these equations for @xmath8 yields the approximate @xmath40th zero for the @xmath12th hermite polynomial . </S>",

    "<S> [ eq : evenzeros ] and [ eq : oddzeros].,title=\"fig : \" ]    the finding that the boundaries of equal area partitions of growing circles correspond to the asymptotic zeros of the hermite functions appears to be a novel one from a search of the literature . </S>",
    "<S> it is all the more surprising that the origin of this one - to - one correspondance stems from the holstein - primakoff representations for finite - dimensional spin systems . </S>",
