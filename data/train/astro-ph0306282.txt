    "protons accelerated by uniformly distributed extragalactic astrophysical sources would be a perfect minimal explanation of the uhecr data above @xmath3  ev .",
    "however , protons with energy @xmath4  ev loose quickly energy due to pion production on cosmic microwave background photons .",
    "thus the proton spectrum should show the so - called greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) cutoff  @xcite , which is not observed by the agasa experiment  @xcite .",
    "moreover , if the small - scale clusters in the arrival directions of uhecr measured by agasa  @xcite are due to point - like sources , one can estimate their number  @xcite .",
    "this number is so small that the nearest source should be located at the distance @xmath5  mpc  @xcite .",
    "this means that the gzk cutoff is exponentially sharp at @xmath6  ev and even the data of the hires experiment  @xcite are inconsistent with the expected proton spectrum  @xcite .",
    "this inconsistency becomes even stronger if bl lacs , which show a statistically significant correlations with the arrival directions of uhecr with energy @xmath7  ev @xcite , are sources of uhecr",
    ".    a possible solution to this problem would be the existence of superheavy dark matter ( shdm )  @xcite .",
    "superheavy particles with mass @xmath8 gev can be naturally produced during inflation and would be today the dominant component of dark matter  @xcite .",
    "such particles will concentrate in galactic halos and the secondaries from their decay could be responsible for the highest energy cosmic rays .",
    "it has also been suggested that not decays but annihilations of shdm particles produce the observed uhecrs  @xcite .    by construction , this model has two clean signatures : the dominance of photons at the highest energies  @xcite and an anisotropy of the arrival directions with an increased flux from the galactic center  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , both signatures are not very clean for the present experiments . indeed , at 95% c.l .",
    ", @xmath9 of the uhecr above @xmath10  ev can be photons  @xcite , which means that still most of uhecrs with @xmath11  ev can be photons without any contradiction to the experimental data .",
    "since experiments in the northern hemisphere do not see the galactic center , they are not very sensitive to a possible anisotropy of arrival directions of uhecr from shdm . in contrast , the galactic center was visible for the old australian sugar experiment .",
    "the anisotropy of the arrival directions using data from the full sky was discussed in refs .",
    "reference  @xcite compared the flux from the galactic center to the one from the anti - center and found them to be comparable .",
    "similarly , the full - sky harmonic analysis including agasa and sugar data from ref .",
    "@xcite found no significant anisotropy . in this work ,",
    "we use a two - component energy spectrum of uhecrs consisting of protons from uniformly distributed , astrophysical sources and the fragmentation products of shdm calculated in susy - qcd .",
    "we compare their expected arrival direction distribution to the data of the sugar experiment using a kolmogorov - smirnov test .",
    "contrary to the harmonic analysis , this test allows to quantify directly the ( dis- ) agreement of the measured distribution of arrival direction with the expected one in the shdm model .",
    "we consider both decays and annihilations of shdm .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we discuss the status of the sugar data .",
    "the contribution of shdm to the uhecr spectrum is discussed in section iii . in section",
    "iv we perform an harmonic analysis of the arrival directions measured by the sugar experiment",
    ". then we use a kolmogorov - smirnov test in one and two dimensions to check the consistency of the sugar data with the probability distribution of arrival directions expected for shdm in section v. finally we conclude in section vi .",

    "the overall normalization of the spectra has only a weak influence on our results .",

    "[ f01 ] . rescaling the sugar energies calculated with the hillas prescription by 15% downwards , @xmath13 , makes their data consistent with the ones from agasa .",
    "the same is true for the hires spectrum if the energy is rescaled up - wards by 25%   we have chosen arbitrary the agasa spectrum as reference , but changing the overall normalization of the spectra affects our results only weakly . as seen from fig .",
    "[ f01 ] , the sugar spectrum has the ankle at the correct place around @xmath14  ev and is consistent with the agasa spectrum in the whole energy range . in particular , the sugar spectrum also does not show the gzk cutoff at the highest energies .",
    "the rescaling of the sugar data downwards by 15% should be compared to the recent reevaluation of the energy conversion formula used in the haverah park experiment  @xcite . in this reference ,",
    "the relation between @xmath15 and the primary energy has been recalculated using qgsjet  @xcite and compared to the original relation suggested by hillas .",
    "the new calibration results in @xmath9 lower primary energies .",
    "the sugar experiment was a very sparse array of detectors and its energy determination of each single event was therefore rather unprecise .",
    "thus , we shall use as a statistical test later on a method which relies only on the total flux measured by the sugar array , but uses not the energy of each single event .",
    "since after the rescaling of the energies measured by sugar , @xmath16 , its measured flux is consistent with newer experiments like agasa and hires , we conclude that _ on average _ the energy determination in the sugar experiment was reliable .    the energy conversion formula used in sugar to connect",

    "predicted to be dominant in the shdm model , the muon content of the shower is smaller by a factor 5  10  @xcite .",
    "thus the energies of photon events is expected to be _ underestimated _ by the sugar experiment . the sugar spectrum shown in fig .",
