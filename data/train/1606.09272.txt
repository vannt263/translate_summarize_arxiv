    "a critical task in materials science has been to understand how atomic defects on crystal surfaces form and evolve , so that one can assess the stability of novel nanostructures and small devices . below the roughening transition ,",
    "the growth of nanostructures is mediated by the motion of atomic line defects which resemble steps @xcite .",
    "these steps act as sources and sinks for adsorbed atoms ( adatoms ) .",
    "a goal is to understand the dynamics of steps , which can in turn elucidate the morphological evolution of crystal surfaces at large scales  @xcite",
    ". studies of the burton - cabrera - frank ( bcf ) model of step flow  @xcite and its variants  @xcite have long played a key role in achieving this goal .",
    "the bcf model @xcite was originally formulated as a phenomenological mesoscale theory for _ near - equilibrium _ processes that cause steps to move via mass conservation .",
    "the principal ingredients are : ( i ) a step velocity law ; ( ii ) the adatom diffusion on terraces , i.e. nanoscale domains bounded by steps ; and ( iii ) a _ linear _ kinetic law for the density of flux at steps .",
    "this model has been enriched to the point where it is now used to describe step flow under an apparently wide range of kinetics on a crystal surface .",
    "nonetheless , basic aspects of step flow remain poorly understood .",
    "recently , it was indicated that bcf theory in 1 + 1 dimensions can be interpreted as a dilute limit of the adatom gas  @xcite . in this context , the relative deviation ( supersaturation ) of the adatom density from its equilibrium value is a variable of importance .",
    "an emerging question is the following : how can _ corrections _ to the bcf theory be described consistently with atomistic dynamics on a crystal lattice ?    the goals of this paper are twofold .",
    "first , we seek to demonstrate the validity of the bcf model via appropriate selection of atomistic parameters .",
    "second , we wish to describe empirical corrections to a bcf - like model of one - step flow in correspondence to atomistic dynamics in 1 + 1 dimensions .",
    "we carry out ( i ) a formal analysis based on a master equation for a kinetic restricted solid - on - solid ( krsos ) model , in the spirit of  @xcite ; and ( ii ) numerical computations via kinetic monte carlo ( kmc ) simulations of the krsos model .",
    "our main results in this study are summarized as follows .    * assuming that an arbitrary yet finite number of particle states contribute to the system evolution , we derive a formal power - series expansion for the steady - state solution to a master equation with external material deposition . *",
    "we prove a `` maximum principle '' for a master equation including material deposition onto the surface from above .",
    "* by a microscopic averaging in the time - dependent setting , we derive exact expressions for the adatom flux at the step edge .",
    "our formulas separate the linear kinetic law of the bcf model , which is exact in the dilute limit , from higher - order corrections that result from many - particle states .",
    "* heuristically , we show how the bcf - type model results as the mesoscale limit of the master equation at low enough supersaturations .",
    "* we find bounds for possible deviations , which are expressed in terms of discrete averages over special microscale configurations , from the linear kinetic law for adatom fluxes at the step and from the diffusion equation on the terrace .",
    "our derivation makes use of estimates resulting from our `` maximum principle '' .",
    "* by using kmc simulations , we empirically determine these supersaturation - driven corrections to the bcf theory , particularly a nonlinear ( quadratic ) relation for the adatom mass flux at the step edge . furthermore , we empirically determine a condition by which the linear kinetic law for adatom flux at the step is reasonably accurate ( see remark 7 in section [ sec : corrections ] ) .",
    "we assume that the reader is familiar with the basic concepts of epitaxial growth",
    ". for broad reviews on the subject , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "our starting point is a master equation for the probability density of atomistic configurations .",
    "this description , which includes external material deposition with rate ( atoms per unit time ) @xmath0 , is an extension of the deposition - free master equation for adatoms invoked in  @xcite .",
    "our equation embodies generic microscopic rules of the krsos model for : adatom hopping on terraces ( or , the microscopic process for surface diffusion ) ; and detachment and attachment of atoms at the step edge according to detailed balance .",
    "the corresponding mathematical formalism also accounts for events that do not conserve the total mass , or adatom number , as a result of the nonzero @xmath0 . a simplifying assumption inherent to our formalism",
    "is that adatoms do not form bonds away from the step edge and do not interact with each other electrostatically or elastically or by indirect ( through - substrate ) mechanisms ; hence , adatom - adatom correlations originate solely from kinetics .",
    "our atomistic model allows for the analytical derivation of an exact , closed - form expression for the equilibrium concentration of adatoms on the terrace if @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , for arbitrary @xmath0 , we derive formulas for the adatom fluxes at step edges via formal analysis of the master equation . in this vein , kinetic contributions to the adatom mass flux are manifestly connected to atomistic variables .",
    "for low enough supersaturation , we formally show that the adatom motion gives rise to the familiar linear kinetic relation characteristic of bcf - type models . on the other hand , at high supersaturations , nonlinear corrections to this relation",
    "must be taken into account . by use of kmc simulations",
    ", we demonstrate this nonlinearity and numerically estimate the dependence of the coefficients of the emergent nonlinear kinetic relation on the attachment - detachment and deposition rates of the atomistic processes .",
    "specifically , within the mesoscale picture of a crystal surface , the adatom fluxes , @xmath2 , toward the step edge are empirically described by an expansion of the form @xmath3 in this relation , @xmath4 is the equilibrium adatom concentration at the step edge ( for @xmath1 ) ; @xmath5 is the adatom concentration at the upper ( @xmath6 ) or lower ( @xmath7 ) terrace ; @xmath8 is the corresponding supersaturation ; and @xmath9 are kinetic coefficients that in principle depend on atomistic rates .",
    "note that only the @xmath10 term in   is present in bcf - type models  @xcite . in the present work",
    ", we provide evidence for the origin of nonlinear terms in  ; and numerically compute the coefficients @xmath9 for @xmath11 in certain typical cases of atomistic dynamics .",
    "a related outcome of our numerical computations is an empirical condition for the validity of the linear kinetic law .",
    "it is worthwhile placing our work in the appropriate context of past literature , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "our goal here is to explore the connection of an atomistic model to mesoscale descriptions of crystals .",
    "this theme bears resemblance to the main objectives of @xcite .",
    "however , in these works @xcite the authors attention focuses on near - equilibrium processes , whereas in the present paper we study the kinetic regime in which external material deposition tends to drive the system away from equilibrium .",
    "a similar task is undertaken in  @xcite , albeit via a ( coarse - grained ) `` terrace - step - kink '' model .",
    "we herein avoid _ a priori _ approximations associated with the diluteness of the adatom system which is a key , explicit assumption in @xcite .",
    "our study here has a perspective distinct from that of  @xcite in which extensive computations are carried out in 2 + 1 dimensions .",
    "in particular , in  @xcite the authors derive a set of refined boundary conditions at the step edge that depend on the local environment on the basis of a discrete diffusion equation with a _ fixed",
    "_ step position . in  @xcite only numerical comparisons of kmc simulations",
    "to aspects of the bcf model are shown . a different view",
    "is adopted in  @xcite where a high - dimensional master equation is reduced to a langevin - type equation for height columns on the crystal lattice .",
    "we should also mention the probabilistic approach in  @xcite , which addresses the passage from an atomistic description within a solid - on - solid model to a _ fully _ continuum picture .",
    "a discussion that the boundary condition involving the mass flux toward the step edge may exhibit a nonlinear behavior as a function of the adatom density can be found in @xcite .",
    "specifically , in @xcite the authors carry out numerical simulations of a `` terrace - step - kink '' model that reveal a nonlinear dependence of adatom fluxes on the supersaturation , @xmath12 ; and relate this behavior to the step - continuum thermodynamic approach of @xcite .    in the present treatment ,",
    "we point out such a nonlinearity at the mesoscale from a kinetic atomistic perspective , in an effort to avoid continuum thermodynamic principles . by recourse to atomistic mechanisms",
    ", we argue that nonlinear terms in the boundary conditions for the mass flux naturally emerge as the system is driven farther from equilibrium ; cf .  .",
    "building on our results , our long - term goal is to address phenomena in 2d settings , for which more complicated atomistic models are necessary  @xcite .",
    "our work has several limitations . to start with",
    ", our atomistic model is one dimensional ( 1d ) .",
    "this simplification has some unphysical consequences .",
    "for example , it leaves out surface features intimately connected to the effect of step stiffness  @xcite .",
    "step meandering , an important 2d effect , is completely absent in our approach .",
    "furthermore , we do not account for nucleation , which at low enough temperatures is known to cause deviations from the usual kinetic law for the step velocity  @xcite . in a related vein , we are unable to adequately model advection at the atomistic scale and derive corresponding terms in the continuum limit . in our 1d setting , island formation dictates that equilibrium can not be established ; thus we exclude bonding between adatoms  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we focus on the motion of a single step .",
    "this consideration leaves out elastic and entropic step - step interactions  @xcite . admittedly , our version of a microscopic master equation is simplified since it forms a direct extension , by addition of external deposition , of the description in  @xcite .",
    "this model is deemed suitable for low and moderate adatom densities .",
    "thus , our formalism may not entirely capture the full range of effects arising at high supersaturation .",
    "our analysis , which focuses on averages of microscopic variables such as the number of adatoms per lattice site , leaves unexplored the issue of stochastic fluctuations in step motion  @xcite .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : reviewmodels ] provides a review of the main models : the bcf - type model of step flow in 1d ( section  [ subsec : bcfmodel ] ) , which offers the usual mesoscale picture phenomenologically ; and the atomistic krsos model ( section  [ subsec : sosmodel ] ) , which is the starting point and basis of our analysis . in section",

    "this approach makes use of an adatom concentration , @xmath20 , on each terrace in the laboratory frame .",
    "accordingly , the bcf theory is comprised of the following major elements : ( a ) a step velocity law , which expresses mass conservation for adatoms ; ( b ) a diffusion equation for @xmath20 ; and ( c ) a linear kinetic relation for the adatom flux normal to the step edge . to simplify the model without losing sight of the essential physics , we assume that the desorption and evaporation of atoms is negligible .",
