    "in addition to the optical lattice , the @xmath2 atomic impurity experiences a parabolic confining potential . for atoms in the lowest bloch band , the system can be described by the hubbard hamiltonian ( @xmath7 ) @xmath8 where @xmath9 represents the hopping amplitude between neighbouring sites , @xmath10 is the on - site ( attractive ) interaction energy and @xmath11 characterises the strength of the parabolic confining potential for the impurity . throughout the paper we set @xmath12 , and we choose as the length scale the lattice period @xmath13 .",

    "in the following , we characterize the different physical states which the impurity may form inside the bath .",
    "the key observable in our analysis is the oscillation of the time - dependent _ doublon density _ , defined as @xmath41 , after a kick with quasi - momentum @xmath42 has been imparted to the impurity at @xmath43 .",
    "we find that this is a more useful quantity than the impurity density @xmath44 , as it provides more direct information corresponding to the bath dynamics and pairing with the impurity .",

    "we also examine the way the impurity modifies the density of the bath around its position and explain why the peak position stays independent of @xmath53 despite this local distortion .",
    "subsection [ sec : high - frequency - peak ] describes this in detail , including the change in the polaron oscillation frequency with density .",
    "by contrast , in the case of weak interaction , a polaron component to the oscillation is significant only for densities at or below @xmath54 ( low - frequency peak in fig .",
    "[ fig : cm_w1]-a ) , while the dominant component of @xmath50 stems from the motion of a free particle ( low- and high - frequency peaks in figs .",

    "the polaronic component corresponds to the resonant scattering between a bound pair and an impurity particle propagating through the background particle bath .",

    "further , the existence of the two peaks in @xmath106 can be related to the known structure of the polaron ground state : in the the polaron ansatz @xcite of the type @xmath110 the first term describes the impurity at rest in the presence of the unperturbed fermi sea of the bath ( with the quasiparticle weight @xmath111 ) , and the second term a coherent superposition of states , in which the motion of the impurity is correlated with a single particle - hole excitation of the fermi sea ( like the weakly bound state entering eq .",

    "thus , the crossover from a polaron to a bound pair with increasing interaction is also taking place in analogy to higher dimensional continuum systems . in our system , however , we have a feature that does not have any analogy in the polaron vs.molecule crossover in 3d continuum , namely , the high - frequency peak in the large @xmath160 regime , which becomes dominant for bath fillings above 0.5 , which is the result of a virtual particle - hole creation process .",

    "<S> we study the non - equilibrium dynamics of an impurity in an harmonic trap that is kicked with a well - defined quasi - momentum , and interacts with a bath of free fermions or interacting bosons in a 1d lattice configuration . using numerical and analytical techniques </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the full dynamics beyond linear response , which allows us to quantitatively characterise states of the impurity in the bath for different parameter regimes . </S>",
    "<S> these vary from a tightly bound molecular state in a strongly interacting limit to a polaron ( dressed impurity ) and a free particle for weak interactions , with composite behaviour in the intermediate regime . </S>",
    "<S> these dynamics and different parameter regimes should be readily realizable in systems of cold atoms in optical lattices .    </S>",
    "<S> impurities play a crucial role in determining the low - temperature features of a number of condensed matter systems . </S>",
    "<S> these impurities may be localized ones , as for the x - ray edge @xcite and kondo effects @xcite , or mobile ones , like the itinerant single electrons modified by the phonon bath of the solid state crystal in which they move ( polarons ) @xcite , or the single spin - flipped electron moving in a lattice populated by opposite spin electrons , as studied in the context of high @xmath0 superconductors @xcite . with recent experimental developments for systems of ultracold atoms , such as the the tunability of the two - body interaction with the aid of feshbach resonances @xcite , a particularly well controlled environment @xcite to explore the properties of these types of many - body systems has become available .    for two- and three - dimensional systems </S>",
    "<S> , these advances have enabled the experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite study of mobile impurities inside a fermionic bath , i.e. a type of polaron , usually created by preparing two - component ultracold fermi gases with a large number imbalance between the components . in that context , the possibility of tuning the bath - impurity interaction across a wide range and even from attractive to repulsive regimes has opened up both the polaronic and the molecular regime to investigation . </S>",
    "<S> these advances have also stirred interest in using these fermionic systems to study the dynamics of the x - ray edge effect , which is induced by a localized impurity @xcite .    at the same time , the ability to restrict the spatial dimension of the ultracold gas experiments almost arbitrarily has also made the study of impurities inside one - dimensional many - body baths possible . </S>",
    "<S> as movement of the impurity in such a bath can very easily involve the collective motion of many bath atoms , the result can be profoundly modified compared with what would be expected in higher - dimensional systems , giving rise to a regime of subdiffusive impurity motion , in which it can displace only proportional to the logarithm of time , slower than any power law @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another reason for the particular interest in 1d impurity - bath systems is that they make particularly compelling benchmark systems for a wide range of impurity - bath systems , due to the powerful theoretical approaches available to treat interacting 1d systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the ground state of an impurity in a 1d fermi gas in a lattice was calculated via exact numerical methods  @xcite , demonstrating that it can be described by a polaron - type ansatz for weak interactions , while the strong interaction regime corresponds well to the strongly interacting limit of the bethe ansatz . </S>",
    "<S> static properties of polarons in 1d ultracold fermi gases have been studied also in  @xcite , and recently there has been interest in exploring the dynamics as well @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> complementary to the fermionic case , the dynamics of an impurity in a continuous bosonic bath was studied recently experimentally and theoretically  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> major advances with single - site addressing and manipulation in optical lattices @xcite have recently enabled the realization of lattice impurities within a bath described by a 1d bose - hubbard model @xcite .    in this article </S>",
    "<S> we explore the basic dynamical properties of a single impurity in a lattice potential and a harmonic trap in 1d , which interacts with a bath of free fermions or interacting bosons , also confined in the 1d lattice . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we consider the non - equilibrium response of the impurity to a kick with well defined momentum . a key open question in this context is how to characterise the role that the bath atoms play in the dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we ask whether the dynamical response of the system implies polaronic behaviour , in which the properties of the particle are renormalised by the presence of the bath , or whether the interaction gives rise to other states , e.g. , to tightly bounds pair or more complex objects .    using time - evolving block decimation ( tebd ) methods @xcite in conjunction with bethe - ansatz results , we study the non - equilibrium dynamics of the impurity beyond the weak coupling assumptions of linear response theory . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the observed oscillation frequencies of the impurity - bath system can be mapped onto different physical states , and explain their dependency on bath density and strength of the impurity - bath interaction . in different limits we see that the behaviour ranges from a tightly bound pair for strong interactions to polaron - like behaviour at weak interactions for a fermionic bath . </S>",
    "<S> the latter case is characterised by an interesting internal dynamics corresponding to the scattering between a bound pair and an impurity particle propagating through the fermionic bath . </S>",
    "<S> we also compare these results with the case of a bosonic bath to better define the role of the fermi sea . generally , we find that the physics for a boson bath can be qualitatively and even quantitatively similar to the fermionic case , for both the doublon and the polaron regime , provided the boson - boson repulsion is larger than the attractive interaction between bath and impurity </S>",
    "<S> .    this setup and characterisation of the dynamics should be readily realisable with cold atoms in optical lattices , and we expect our zero - temperature results to hold also at finite temperature , provided it is lower than the energy scale given by the oscillation frequency .    </S>",
    "<S> this article is organised as follows : we first introduce the system and describe the method used in section [ fermions ] . </S>",
    "<S> there we also discuss the effects of combining a lattice potential with a trap in the case of an impurity that does not interact with the bath . in section [ sec : pairs - dynamics ] we present numerical results for the impurity dynamics and explain them both in the regime of strong and weak interactions through comparison with analytical methods . </S>",
    "<S> we especially discuss the frequency spectrum of oscillations , and identify different physical regimes of impurity behaviour . in section [ bosons ] , we compare with the case of a bosonic reservoir , and identify similarities and differences to the case of the fermionic bath dependent on the boson - boson repulsion . in section [ sec : disc_conc ] , we discuss our findings and make a connection to earlier impurity and polaron studies . </S>",
    "<S> finally , an appendix contains details of several analytical results we have derived . </S>"
