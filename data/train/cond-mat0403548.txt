    "one characteristics of magnetic molecules is that their intermolecular interaction is usually extremely weak compared to their intramolecular interactions .",
    "this becomes one of the experimental advantages when investigating these materials since a measurement at a crystal or powder of such molecules reflects the properties of a single molecule .",
    "also for speculative applications like storage media the independence of the molecular units is crucial , for an overview see ref .   and references therein .",
    "despite the advantages of virtually independent magnetic molecules the controlled coupling of magnetic clusters to one- or multidimensional networks is a highly interesting avenue as well , especially if the degree of magnetic exchange between the cluster entities can be varied over a wide range .",
    "examples for such cluster - based networks are e.  g. given by chains@xcite and square lattices@xcite of the magnetic keplerate molecule \\{@xmath0}. these systems show new combinations of physical properties that stem from both molecular and bulk effects .    in this article",
    "we report the magnetic characterization of the new cluster compound@xcite [ ( cucl@xmath1tachh)@xmath2cl]cl@xmath1 ( tach @xmath3 _ cis , trans_-1,3,5-triamino - cyclohexane ) , which contains one - dimensional arrays of antiferromagnetically coupled equilateral copper(ii ) @xmath4 triangles that are aligned to form infinite stacks of antiprisms , see fig .  [ f-0 ] . these copper(ii ) triangle clusters ( cucl@xmath1tachh)@xmath2cl comprise a central @xmath5-chloride ion that coordinates to the three copper centers in an unprecedented trigonal - planar bonding mode .",
    "in addition , this arrangement is stabilized by hydrogen bonds between the terminal chloride ligands and the nh groups from neighboring tach ligands coordinating to neighboring copper centers . as the unpaired electron of each @xmath6 cu(ii ) center resides in a molecular orbital of dominant @xmath7 character which overlap with the ligand atoms involved in these hydrogen bonds , magnetic superexchange between the copper centers of a triangle",
    "should be restricted to this pathway , compare fig .",
    "[ f-1 ] , while exchange involving the central @xmath5-chloride ligand would require a significant population of the cu @xmath8 orbitals .",
    "further hydrogen bonds between the ( cucl@xmath1tachh)@xmath2cl triangles in the crystal lattice result in a extended three - dimensional supramolecular arrangement : additional non - coordinating chloride anions interlink the triangles to @xmath9-planes , and an extensive network of hydrogen bonds between the terminal chloride ligands and the nh groups connect these planes together along the crystallographic @xmath10-axis .",
    "taking into account that the coupling between the antiferromagnetically coupled triangles is mediated by hydrogen - bonded cu - cl@xmath11h - n - cu super - exchange pathways , one could conjecture that the magnetic properties of the system may be well described by weakly coupled triangles .",
    "this implies that the system at high temperatures behaves like independent triangles while at low temperatures it behaves like a linear chain of effective spins given by the ground state spin of each triangle , which is @xmath12 .    in a magnetization measurement",
    "such a situation would be reflected by a pronounced plateau at @xmath13 of the saturation magnetization .",
    "our high - field magnetization measurement show , however , no plateau .",
    "the observed magnetization and susceptibility curves are successfully interpreted by a theoretical model , in which the inter- and intra - triangle exchange parameters are of similar magnitude .",
    "actually , the hydrogen - bonded super - exchange appears to be even stronger than the intra - triangle exchange pathways ( mediated by the bridging chloro ligand and intra - molecular hydrogen bonds ) although the cu - cu distance between triangles is 6.82   , whereas the intra - triangle cu - cu distance is 4.46   .    from a solid state physics point of view",
    "the new chain system belongs to the class of heisenberg three - leg ladder systems with frustrated rung boundary condition , see e.  g. refs .  .",
    "such systems show a rich phase diagram and may have analytically known ground states.@xcite however , the three - leg copper ladder discussed in this article is not of the simple structure  investigated in refs .",
    " where one either assumes that the coupling is simpler@xcite or that the rung spin is a good quantum number.@xcite nevertheless , the present structure poses a new interesting frustrated three - leg ladder with two competing interactions .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec-2 ] we report our experimental results followed by a discussion of the theoretical model in sec .  [ sec-3 ] .",
    "the last section outlines the behavior of our three - leg ladder for fictitious intra- and inter - triangle couplings .",
    "the susceptibility @xmath14 was measured for [ ( cucl@xmath1tachh)@xmath2cl]cl@xmath1 using a squid magnetometer ( quantum design mpms-5 ) at @xmath15  tesla in a temperature range of @xmath16  k. the resulting dependence is shown as a solid curve in fig .",
    "figure [ f-3 ] displays the related dependence of @xmath17 on temperature . here",
    "the thin dashed line marks the high temperature limit for an equivalent system of three uncorrelated @xmath18 centers .    to establish the @xmath19-values of [ ( cucl@xmath1tachh)@xmath2cl]cl@xmath1 esr measurements",
    "have been performed at 190  ghz with a powder sample by using pulsed magnetic fields and gunn oscillators.@xcite a typical powder pattern has been found .",
    "we fitted the esr spectrum determined at 30  k , where one can neglect the effect of short range order , compare fig .",
    ". the spectrum can be very well reproduced by assuming a uni - axial anisotropy of the @xmath19-value with @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "these @xmath19-values can be interpreted by considering the local environment of cu@xmath22 ions as follows .",
    "cu@xmath22 is in pyramidical coordination and the apical bonds are in the plane normal to the chain ( @xmath9-plane ) .",
    "the lengths of the two bonds in the basal plane of each pyramid are nearly the same and thus the @xmath19-value anisotropy in the basal plane is small . in this case , we can define the local @xmath19-value along the apical bond as @xmath23 and in the basal plane as @xmath24 .",
    "note that directions of the apical bonds alter by @xmath25 between nearest neighbor cu@xmath22 ions in a triangle .",
    "therefore , the effective @xmath19-value of coupled copper ions in the @xmath9-plane is the average of @xmath23 and @xmath24 with some weak three - fold anisotropy .",
    "the @xmath19-value anisotropy in the @xmath9-plane for the three - fold symmetry of a triangle can not be seen in the present experiment due to the use of a powder sample .",
    "if a single crystal was used , the three - fold pattern may be observed at very high frequency ( @xmath26  ghz ) where the anisotropy of the zeeman energy is much larger than the exchange coupling .",
    "further , the effective @xmath19-value along the chain corresponds to @xmath24 , because it is common for all triangles .",
    "accordingly , we can expect a uni - axial @xmath19-value anisotropy , where @xmath24 is close to @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the average of @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "for the theoretical studies of section  [ sec-3 ] we are using an average @xmath19-value of 2.095 .",
    "the high - field magnetization of [ ( cucl@xmath1tachh)@xmath2cl]cl@xmath1 has been measured in pulsed magnetic fields at the okayama high magnetic field laboratory by using a standard inductive method ( maximum @xmath29  tesla , @xmath30  tesla / s ) . the sample is immersed in liquid @xmath31he to keep a good contact with the thermal bath .",
    "no clear hysteresis is found between up and down sweeps , see fig .  [ f-4 ] .",
    "in addition static - field measurements were performed up to 5  t which perfectly agree with the pulsed - field results .",
    "thus we conclude that the measured magnetization curve shows an isothermal magnetization .",
    "nevertheless , the experimental curve deviates from the theoretical one , see sec .",
    "[ sec-3 ] below , especially in the vicinity of the saturation field @xmath32  tesla .",
    "it might very well be that the @xmath19-value anisotropy or a staggered field , which is possible in the present crystal structure , are the origin of the stronger rounding of the experimental data .",
    "the effect of a staggered field is strongly enhanced in higher fields since it grows with the external field strength , see e.  g. ref .   where a linear dependence between staggered and external field is assumed which leads to rounding effects ( due to mixing of states ) that are quadratic in the staggered field .",
    "the small difference between experimental and theoretical curve at low fields is due to the fact that a finite chain has a larger singlet - triplet gap compared to the infinite chain , see fig .",
    "our epr measurements suggest only weak anisotropy , therefore we model the system by an isotropic heisenberg hamiltonian @xmath33 where @xmath34 are the individual spin operators at sites @xmath35 , @xmath36 is the total spin , @xmath37 its @xmath38-component .",
    "the homogeneous magnetic field defines the @xmath38-direction .",
    "the spin quantum number of the copper ions is @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath39 are the matrix elements of the symmetric coupling matrix .",
    "a negative value of @xmath39 corresponds to antiferromagnetic coupling .    using the fact that the hamiltonian , the total spin , its @xmath38-component as well as the point - group symmetry operations commute with each other it is possible to diagonalize the hamiltonian of finite chains numerically exactly .",
    "thus all the thermodynamic quantities can be evaluated without approximation .",
    "we determined the complete spectra of two , four , and six triangles with cyclic boundary condition in order to estimate the unknown intra - triangle exchange parameter @xmath40 as well as its inter - triangle counterpart @xmath41 . for eight triangles the spectrum could still be determined for hilbert subspaces with large enough magnetic quantum number @xmath42 .",
    "since the resulting magnetization does not differ from those of a six - triangle chain , see fig .",
    "[ f-4 ] , we can safely assume that a chain of six triangles already reflects the properties of the infinite chain to a very large extent .",
    "the figures [ f-2 ] , [ f-3 ] , and [ f-4 ] show the theoretical curves for the zero - field susceptibility as well as for the magnetization , which we obtain for @xmath43  k and @xmath44  k. the magnetization curve turns out to be crucial for an understanding of the exchange parameters . if the intra - triangle coupling was much stronger than the inter - triangle coupling , then the magnetization curve would show a pronounced plateau at @xmath13 of the saturation magnetization .",
    "this can be understood by looking at an equilateral triangle of spins @xmath18 .",
    "in such a triangle there are only two energy levels , one for total spin @xmath45 , the other for @xmath46 , both levels are fourfold degenerate . at @xmath47",
    "the magnetization is @xmath12 for low fields until one reaches the field where the lowest zeeman level of @xmath46 crosses the former ground state level .",
    "thus , in such a triangle the @xmath47 magnetization curve has a long plateau and one jump to saturation , compare also fig .",
    "[ f-6 ] . for weakly coupled triangles this plateau starts to shrink from both sides until it vanishes for couplings of the same order .",
    "this situation holds for the investigated compound , compare fig .",
    "[ f-4 ] , therefore , this chain is an example of a frustrated spin system with competing interactions .",
    "figure [ f-5 ] shows the energy eigenvalues as a function of total spin for the finite chain with six triangles .",
    "the ground state is a singlet which is clearly separated from the first triplet excitation .",
    "there are no singlet intruders below the triplet state which sometimes is a sign of strong frustration.@xcite",
    "the magnetism of the three - lag ladder shown in fig .",
    "[ f-1 ] exhibits three extremes depending on @xmath40 and @xmath41 . if the inter - triangle exchange parameter @xmath41 is equal to zero the chain decays into independent triangles , if the intra - triangle exchange parameter @xmath40 is zero the three - lag ladder transforms into a square lattice wrapped around a torus , and if @xmath48 the three - lag ladder is a triangular lattice on a torus .    from a classical point of view the ground states and the magnetization curves for @xmath47",
    "are analytically known for all combinations of antiferromagnetic couplings @xmath40 and @xmath41.@xcite here we will discuss the special cases @xmath49 and @xmath50 as well as @xmath48 . in the first case @xmath49 the system is bipartite and the classical ground state shows collinear nel order . in the other two cases the ground state",
    "is coplanar with relative angles of @xmath25 between neighboring spins because of three - colorability of the spin system.@xcite it can be shown that these two states always constitute a ground state .",
    "for @xmath51 the collinear nel state is ground state , for @xmath52 the @xmath25 arrangement becomes ground state.@xcite for all antiferromagnetic couplings the ground state has no chiral structure .",
    "in addition the minimal energies form a parabola as a function of total spin @xmath53 , therefore the magnetization curve for @xmath47 increases linearly up to saturation .    in the following",
    "we discuss the behavior of a finite quantum - spin chain of 8 triangles for various combinations of @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "figure  [ f-6 ] shows magnetization curves for @xmath47 for various hypothetical couplings .",
    "the dotted curve shows the magnetization of independent triangles ( @xmath54 ) , the dashed curve displays the behavior if both couplings are of equal size , and the solid curve denotes the magnetization for vanishing intra - triangle coupling ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "the thin curve gives an example for weakly coupled triangles ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "the discussion of independent triangles can be kept rather short , since this system can be analytically solved .",
    "for @xmath18 the ground state has @xmath45 and the first ( and sole ) excited state has @xmath46 .",
    "both are fourfold degenerate .",
    "the magnetization consists of a long plateau at @xmath13 saturation magnetization with a single jump to saturation .",
    "the opposite case with vanishing intra - triangle coupling is related to the square lattice in the sense that the triangular chain in this case is a square lattice on a torus which extends infinitely only along one direction . in the orthogonal direction",
    "the lattice has a periodic boundary condition with a period of three spins .",
    "since the system is bipartite the theorems of lieb , schultz , and mattis apply,@xcite i.  e. the ground state has @xmath57 and is non - degenerate .",
    "the symmetric case with @xmath48 corresponds to a triangular lattice on a torus which extends infinitely only along one direction and again has a periodic boundary condition with a period of three spins in the orthogonal direction , see also refs .  .",
    "although it is nowadays accepted that the triangular lattice has an ordered ground state and gapless magnetic excitations,@xcite these properties do not automatically extend to the triangular chain due to the different dimensionality .",
    "it is very likely that the ground state is not ordered because the chain is quasi one - dimensional .",
    "the magnetization curves of finite systems for the cases @xmath58 and @xmath48 look rather featureless , resembling an almost regular staircase with no prominent plateau or jump .",
    "the cases interpolating between uncoupled and coupled triangles show a plateau at @xmath13 saturation magnetization , which is longer or shorter depending on the ratio of inter- and intra - triangle coupling .",
    "after having discussed the properties of finite chains it is of course desirable to deduce properties of the infinite chain under investigation . for [ ( cucl@xmath1tachh)@xmath2cl]cl@xmath1 the ground state and the singlet - triplet gap",
    "can be evaluated using a lanczos procedure for systems up to 10 triangles .",
    "all finite size calculations result in a ground state spin @xmath57 which is separated by a finite gap from the triplet state , compare fig .",
    "[ f-5 ] . using chains with up to 10 triangles enables us to extrapolate to the infinite system , which turns out to have a ground state spin @xmath57 and a non - zero gap of @xmath59  k , compare fig .",
    "the value of the gap is very likely somewhat bigger since one can expect that the convergence changes from linearly in @xmath60 to exponential@xcite or a power law@xcite like @xmath61 once the system size is bigger than the correlation length @xmath62 .",
    "the ground state of the [ ( cucl@xmath1tachh)@xmath2cl]cl@xmath1 chain is non - degenerate for all simulated system sizes .",
    "this behavior differs from the behavior of chains of weakly coupled triangles where a dimerization together with a twofold degeneracy of the ground state is observed.@xcite with very high confidence we can also state that the big singlet - singlet gap  compare fig .",
    "[ f-5 ]  does not collapse to a degenerate ground state with increasing system size , see fig .  [ f-8 ] .",
    "the gap is practically independent of @xmath63 .",
    "the two values for eight and ten triangles have an uncertainty of about @xmath64  k due to the insufficient accuracy of the lanczos procedure for such high - lying levels .",
    "we thus regard the slight decrease for these values as not significant .",
    "we thank peter hage for letting us utilize his lanczos program , and we thank andreas honecker , johannes richter , heinz - jrgen schmidt as well as jrg schulenburg for fruitful discussions and again heinz - jrgen schmidt for carefully reading the manuscript .",
