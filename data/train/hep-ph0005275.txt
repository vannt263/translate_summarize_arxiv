    "effective field theories ( eft s ) provide a simple and elegant method for calculating processes with several relevant energy scales@xcite .",
    "part of the utility of eft s is that they dramatically simplify the summation of powers of logarithms of ratios of mass scales , which would otherwise make perturbation theory poorly behaved . for example , in a theory with a very heavy particle of mass @xmath7 , one - loop corrections will typically be enhanced by @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is a low scale in the problem . in the eft in which the heavy particle has been removed from the theory ,",
    "such logarithms are replaced by factors of @xmath10 ( where @xmath11 is the renormalization scale in dimensional regularization , or the cutoff in cutoff regularization ) , and the complete series of leading logarithms @xmath12 is straightforward to sum via the renormalization group .",
    "the situation is more complicated for processes with highly energetic light particles . in this case , there are both collinear and infrared divergences in the theory , which give rise to the familiar sudakov double logarithms @xcite .",
    "for example , the perturbative expansion of the @xmath13th moment of the photon spectrum in inclusive @xmath14 decay is of the form @xmath15 although the arguments of these logarithms are not obviously the ratio of two scales , they arise because the typical energy and invariant mass of light particles are widely separated , and they may be summed via well - known techniques based on factorization theorems  @xcite into the form @xmath16 \\,.\\ ] ] the terms @xmath17 are referred to as the leading logarithmic contribution , the terms @xmath18 are referred to as the next - to - leading logarithmic contribution , and the remaining terms are called subdominant .",
    "recently there has been some discussion in the literature of summing sudakov logarithms using effective field theory techniques  @xcite .",
    "such an approach could have several advantages over the conventional method ; in particular , while factorization formulas are based on perturbation theory , efts , by construction , are valid beyond perturbation theory , and by including higher dimension operators it should be straightforward ( if tedious ) to go beyond the leading twist approximation . in the various versions of the eft approach which have been suggested , the effective theory is the so - called `` large energy effective theory '' ( leet )  @xcite , which describes light - like particles coupled to soft degrees of freedom . however , a difficulty with the approaches presented to date is that , as pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite , in the minimal subtraction ( ms ) scheme logarithms arising at one loop in leet do not match logarithms arising at one loop in qcd for any choice of the matching scale @xmath11 ; hence these logarithms may not be summed using the rge s .",
    "in this paper we consider this problem in the context of @xmath19 decays .",
    "we show that the problem of matching scales may be resolved by introducing a new intermediate effective theory containing both soft and collinear degrees of freedom , which is then matched onto leet ( effectively integrating out the collinear modes ) at a lower scale .",
    "we show that the matching conditions onto both effective theories contain no large logarithms at one loop .",
    "we then calculate the rge s in the two theories summing the leading logarithms and a certain subset of the next - to - leading logarithms . to this order",

    "if the phase space is restricted such that the final hadronic state is dominated by only a few resonances , the breakdown of the ope simply reflects the fact that an inclusive treatment based on local duality is no longer appropriate .",
    "this is the case for the dilepton invariant mass spectrum in inclusive @xmath27 and @xmath28 decays  @xcite .",

    "since @xmath91 is an infrared scale in the problem , it is not clear how to sensibly renormalize this term . in ref .",
    "@xcite this divergence was cancelled by a nonlocal counterterm in the inclusive rate ; however , this term indicates that leet can not be used for exclusive processes @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the matching of the inclusive rate performed in @xcite still leaves large logarithms in the coefficient of the operator .",
    "the problem is that leet only describes the coupling of light - like particles to soft gluons , but does not describe the splitting of an energetic particle into two almost collinear particles .",
    "thus , by matching onto leet one is integrating out the collinear modes which also contribute to infrared physics . as we will show below ,",

    "it is the presence of infrared sensitive graphs with collinear loop momentum that makes this eft more complicated than other , more familiar , eft s , where infrared sensitivity comes purely from soft modes .",
    "this is similar to the situation in non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd)@xcite , in which power counting is complicated by the fact that a given amplitude receives contributions from loop momenta which are small compared to the heavy quark mass , but which have parametrically different dependence on the heavy quark velocity @xmath98 . in nrqcd ,",

    "there is an important difference between the approach taken here and the one taken in refs.@xcite where logarithms of @xmath98 are summed in nrqcd and nrqed . in the latter case",
    "no intermediate theory is introduced ; instead the running is performed in one step through the velocity rge . in nrqed",

    "in fact , although the @xmath9-counting looks complicated , graphs with _ only _ collinear lines are identical to the corresponding graphs in qcd .",
    "this is because in any graph in which all the lines have the same scaling ( and there are no purely soft graphs , so this only refers to purely collinear graphs ) , expanding in powers of @xmath9 does not change the propagators .",
    "since the locations of poles in the propagators are unaffected , it is irrelevant whether one calculates the full graph in qcd and then expands in powers of @xmath9 , or calculates each order in @xmath9 in the collinear - soft theory .",
