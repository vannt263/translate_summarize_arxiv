    "the thesis of the theorem is illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "in particular , we aim at showing that the space ( or data ) and time - limit can be taken in any order .",

    "we shall conclude by briefly mention some further results which can be obtained by suitably adapting to the current fully - discretized situation the arguments developed above for time - discretizations .",
    "firstly , in the same spirit of lemma [ uniform_distance_dis ] , one could consider the possibility of estimating the distance of a vector from the minimizer of @xmath507 by means of the functional itself .",
    "secondly , the use of corollary [ unif_dist ] would entail the possibility of an a posteriori error control an some adaptive strategy along the lines of subsection [ adaptivity ] could be considered .",
    "finally , by relying on the known convergence estimates for full space - time discretized problems @xcite one could obtain a convergence and an a posteriori error control result for some generalized space - time approximated problem where @xmath507 are not exactly minimized and one considers minimizing sequences instead ( see subsection [ discrete_scheme ] ) .",
