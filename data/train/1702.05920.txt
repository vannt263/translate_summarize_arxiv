    "gamma ray bursts ( grb ) are the most luminous , transient phenomena happening in the universe with luminosities of the order of @xmath2 erg / s @xcite . the prompt phase of the grb corresponds to the initial episodic event which lasts typically for a duration ranging from a fraction of a second to few tens of seconds .",
    "this is often followed by a fading emission , long after the initial burst decayed , termed as `` after glow '' . optical study of these after glow confirmed the cosmological origin of grbs @xcite .",
    "the distribution of the burst duration of grbs is bimodal with a minima falling at @xmath3 s suggesting the grb may plausibly arise from two different process @xcite .",
    "accordingly they were classified into two types , namely short bursts with duration @xmath4 s and long bursts with duration @xmath5 s. further , the spectra of short bursts are typically harder than the long ones supporting different origin of these two classes @xcite .",
    "the progenitor of the grbs are not well understood ; however , observational and theoretical advancements suggests short grbs to be associated with the mergers of compact objects , e.g. neutron star - neutron star merger or neutron star - black hole merger@xcite , and the long ones are associated with the collapse of a massive star onto a black hole@xcite .",
    "initial attempts to understand the grb emission were focussed on thermal nature originating from a catastrophic event involving collapse of a massive star or merging of two compact objects @xcite .",
    "the huge energy released within a small volume implies , the optical depth of the initial medium to be very high and the interaction between the energetic photons and particles will cause the medium to expand at relativistic speed , commonly referred as `` fire - ball '' .",
    "however , after sufficient expansion , the fire - ball approaches the photospheric stage where further decrease in density transits the matter to optically thin regime and the trapped thermal photons are released @xcite . on the contrary , the time - averaged spectra of grbs , observed by _",
    "batse _ on board _ cgro _ , are found to be non - thermal and are well explained by a broken power - law function with smooth transition at the break frequency ( band function ) @xcite . to understand this non - thermal emission ,",
    "internal shock models were proposed where particles are accelerated at a shock front initiated by the collision between shells of matter expelled by the initial catastrophic event @xcite . the grb emission is then modelled as the synchrotron emission from the relativistic electron population accelerated at these shock fronts .",
    "alternatively , @xcite showed that a non - thermal spectrum can also be imitated by the time integration of blackbody emission arising from an evolving grb shells .",
    "the observed photon spectral indices of many grbs ; however , confront the synchrotron emission interpretation as the indices are steeper than the one allowed by this model@xcite .",
    "in addition , the low energy conversion efficiency of internal shock models posed severe drawback @xcite .",
    "these discrepancies forced the addition of a thermal component in the grb spectra again , along with the non - thermal one @xcite .",
    "after the advent of _ fermi _ and _ swift _ , satellite based experiments operating at gamma ray and x - ray energies , the presence of thermal component in grb spectrum became more evident@xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite performed an elaborative spectral study of long and short bursts observed by fermi / gbm and cgro / batse and compared their spectral widths .",
    "the full width half maximum ( @xmath6 ) of the @xmath7 representation of the spectra , with @xmath8 being the photon energy and @xmath9 the specific flux , was calculated during the flux maximum of each bursts by fitting the observed fluxes using a band function .",
    "interestingly , the width distribution peaked at @xmath1 for long grbs and @xmath10 for short grbs , which is much broader than the planck function ( @xmath11 ) but narrower than the synchrotron spectrum due to a maxwellian distribution of electrons ( @xmath12 ) or a power - law electron distribution with index @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "a similar study was also carried out by @xcite who studied the spectral curvature at the peak of the grb spectrum for 1113 bursts detected by the _",
    "fermi _ gbm experiment .",
    "again , they concluded that most of the bursts are inconsistent with synchrotron emission models or a single temperature blackbody emission . in case of short bursts , a detailed study of spectral broadening",
    "was performed by @xcite using approximate analytical solution for the relativistic hydrodynamic equations .    in the present work",
    ", we study the broadening of the photospheric thermal emission due to relativistic effects under the fire - ball model of grbs .",
    "we consider a scenario where the temperature of the fire - ball decreases rapidly with increase in radius and this causes the high latitude emission to be relatively hotter than the on - axis emission for a distant observer .",
    "in addition , the time integrated spectrum will cause further broadening due to the evolution of the fire - ball within the integration time .",
    "particularly , we investigate the maximum attainable width of this multi temperature blackbody emission within the burst timescale typical for long grbs . in the next section",
    ", we describe the model and the spectral properties . in  3 , we study the maximum attainable width under the present model for the case of long grbs and summarize the work in  4 .",
    "we consider the thermal emission from the photosphere of grb to be associated with the release of radiation trapped in an initial optically thick and relativistically expanding ball of plasma ( fire - ball ) .",
    "we also assume the expansion to be associated with a rapid fall in temperature described by @xmath15 here , @xmath16 is the temperature when the fire - ball radius is @xmath17 , @xmath18 corresponds to the temperature at radius @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the temperature index describing the cooling .",
    "the burst is assumed to be in its coasting phase and hence the expansion velocity will be approximately constant till the internal shock or other dissipative events occur @xcite . further ,",
    "if the expansion is adiabatic , conservation of entropy limits the value of @xmath20 to be @xmath21 during the coasting phase of the burst @xcite .",
    "the relativistic expansion of the fire - ball and the light travel time effect will cause the emission from a higher latitude to be hotter than the on axis emission for a distant observer . the flux at frequency @xmath22 received by the observer located at a distance @xmath23 will then be a modified blackbody spectrum given by ( appendix [ appendix : instant_spec ] ) @xmath24 - 1\\right\\ } }      \\frac{(\\mu-\\beta)}{(1-\\beta\\mu)^3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where",

    "if we consider the photosphere to be spherical , then the relativistic beaming effects will cause the off - axis emission received by the observer to be limited within an angle @xmath31 subtended at the centre of the fire - ball . when the comoving plasma density varies as @xmath32 and for an energy independent photon scattering cross section",
    ", the photosphere can be significantly different from a simple sphere @xcite .",
    "however , within the opening angle @xmath31 along the line of sight of the observer , the surface of the photosphere can still be approximated as spherical @xcite . for simplicity ,",
    "the photosphere emission beyond this angle is not considered in the present work . in fig .",
    "[ fig : instant_spec ] , we show the instantaneous spectrum ( normalized ) for @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 kev along with equivalent blackbody spectrum . for @xmath36 , as in the case of grbs , the emission cone will be narrower and the instantaneous spectrum observed will drift towards a simple blackbody , unless @xmath20 is large enough to create significant off - axis temperature variation .",
    "following @xcite , if we define the width of the resultant spectrum as ( fig .",
    "[ fig : instant_spec ] ) @xmath37 where , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the photon frequencies at the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the @xmath40 ( unit : @xmath41 ) spectrum , then for @xmath42 , @xmath6 will be larger than the one expected from a simple blackbody spectrum ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "in addition , for @xmath43 , @xmath6 will depend mainly on @xmath20 and in fig .",
    "[ fig : inst_w_psi ] we show its variation with respect to the latter . as @xmath20 increases",
    ", @xmath6 increases from @xmath44 to a maximum of @xmath45 corresponding to @xmath46 . beyond this",
    ", the temperature gradient becomes too large such that the on - axis emission fall below the fwhm of the hotter high latitude emission , causing @xmath6 to decrease with further increase in @xmath20 . under the adiabatic limit ( @xmath34 ) , the maximum value of w that can be attained is @xmath47 and beyond this range",
    "is shown as the shaded region in fig .",
    "[ fig : inst_w_psi ] .",
    "a time - averaged spectrum will involve the temporal evolution of the fire - ball within the duration and this will further broaden the spectrum . considering the fire - ball expands from a radius @xmath48 to @xmath49 during an interval , the time - averaged spectrum will then be @xmath50 where , @xmath51 and the corresponding temperature @xmath52 with @xmath53 the temperature of the fire - ball at radius @xmath49 . in fig . [",
    "fig : wr1r2 ] , we show the dependence of @xmath6 on the ratio @xmath54 for the case @xmath36 and @xmath34 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 . if the time - averaged spectrum is obtained for a time step @xmath57 consecutively over the entire burst , then the radius of the fire - ball after @xmath58 duration can be expressed in terms of the initial radius of the burst ( @xmath19 ) as @xmath59 the ratio of the radii falling on the beginning and the end of @xmath57 will then be @xmath60 where , @xmath61 .",
    "since the ratio of the radii continuously evolves during a burst , the width of the time - averaged spectrum will additionally depend on the initial burst radius @xmath19 and the time segment @xmath62 , along with @xmath63 and @xmath20 . from equation ( [ eq : rratio ] ) , the minimum value of the ratio of radii attained will be @xmath64 corresponding to @xmath65 and @xmath66 , which approaches to @xmath67 as @xmath62 increases .",
    "hence , @xmath6 will eventually attains a constant value with negligible change soon after the explosion .",
    "the light curve of the burst can be obtained by integrating equation ( [ eq : r_ave ] ) over the frequency range of interest .",
    "the duration of the burst ( @xmath68 ) can then be obtained by clipping the light curve at 5% of the total flux in the beginning and the end of the burst .",
    "to study the maximum attainable width of long grbs under the expanding fire - ball scenario , we obtain one second time - averaged light curve integrated over the energies 8 kev to 40 mev , consistent with the observations @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : longgrb ] , we show the evolution of the normalized flux , time - averaged spectral width @xmath6 and temperature corresponding to @xmath33 and @xmath35 kev . the parameters @xmath20 and @xmath69 are chosen to be ( @xmath21 , @xmath70 ) , ( @xmath55 , @xmath71 ) and ( @xmath56 , @xmath72 ) such that @xmath73 s , the typical duration of long grbs .",
    "we find that the choice of @xmath20 significantly varies the temporal profile , with the burst peaking earlier for smaller @xmath20 values .",
    "for a given @xmath20 , the burst peak time ( @xmath74 ) can be elongated by increasing @xmath69 ; nevertheless , this will also increase the @xmath68 from the desired value .",
    "the spectral width @xmath6 can be as large as @xmath75 , during the initial phase of the burst ; however , it rapidly decreases to a nearly constant value due to increase in ratio of radii @xmath76 . maintaining a constant @xmath68 , the width of the spectrum during the flux peak ( @xmath77 ) increases with @xmath20 and , in principle ,",
    "can be adjusted to obtain the desired value @xmath78 .",
    "for example , choosing @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 , we obtain @xmath82 while @xmath83 s ; however , such choices will cause the burst to peak much earlier ( @xmath84s ) , inconsistent with the observations .",
    "reduction of @xmath20 to the adiabatic limiting value @xmath21 reduces @xmath77 and this should be associated with a decrease in initial radius @xmath19 in addition , to maintain @xmath68 at the desired value .     and",

    "the fwhm spectral width of the band spectrum used to fit the time resolved spectrum of long grbs is observed to be @xmath78 .",

    "in addition , the time averaging of the emission will incorporate considerable evolution of the fire - ball and this will further broaden the emission",
