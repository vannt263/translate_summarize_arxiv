    "the binary x - ray source gro j165540 ( also called x - ray nova scorpii 1994 ) is a member of the class of so - called `` soft x - ray transients '' ( sxts ) or `` x - ray novae '' . in these systems , a low mass roche - lobe - filling secondary star transfers mass through an accretion disk onto a compact object : a neutron star or a black hole .",
    "compared to a neutron - star transient , a black - hole transient ( bht ) generally has a larger x - ray outburst amplitude and a lower quiescent luminosity , which is a signature of a black hole s event horizon ( narayan , garcia & mcclintock 1997 ) .",
    "the mass of the black hole primary in gro j165540 is @xmath0 ( orosz & bailyn 1997 ; hereafter ob ) .",
    "gro j165540 is an exceptional bht because of its frequent outbursts in recent years .",
    "most bhts have recurrence times of decades or longer , whereas gro  j165540 has gone into outburst several times since its discovery on 1994 july 27 by batse on the _ compton gamma ray observatory _ ( cgro ) ( zhang et al .",
    "two subsequent outbursts occurred in late march 1995 ( wilson et al .",
    "1995 ) and in july 1995 ( harmon et al . 1995 ) . following an extended period of x - ray quiescence",
    ", the source again went into outburst in april 1996 , as discovered by the all - sky monitor ( asm ) on the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _",
    "( rxte ) ( remillard et al . 1996 ; levine et al . 1996 ) .",
    "thus gro j165540 has remained active off and on for nearly three years .",
    "other bhts have shown x - ray and optical activity several months after an outburst ; however , none of them have sustained their activity for more than about a year ( e.g. tanaka & shibazaki 1996 ) .",
    "the frequent outbursts of gro j165540 in recent years may be due to an enhancement of the mass transfer rate , which is estimated to be relatively high , @xmath1 g s@xmath2 ( ob ) .",
    "one should however note ( ritter 1997 ) that this estimate is based on a formula of king , kolb & burderi ( 1996 ) which is valid for giants , but not for systems such as 16 which have not yet reached the giant branch .",
    "systems with companions in the hertzsprung gap should transfer mass at a very high rate ( @xmath3 g s@xmath2 , ritter 1997 ) , since the secondary expands on a thermal time ; this is obviously not the case now in gro j165540 , and no observational determination of the mass transfer rate is available at present .",
    "as it happens , the value given by ob is plausible , and we shall use it in the following . in any case , on longer timescales gro j165540 behaves more like other bhts , since no outburst of the source has been reported in the previous 25 years .",
    "gro j165540 is also distinguished by its radio outbursts , which are associated with superluminal expansion events ( tingay et al .",
    "1995 ; hjellming & rupen 1995 ) .",
    "about 6 days prior to the most recent x - ray outburst of gro j165540 ( in april 1996 ) , a remarkable optical precursor was observed ( orosz et al . 1997 ; hereafter orbm ) . as shown in figure 1 , starting from an initially quiescent state , the optical intensities ( bvri ) were observed to rise gradually for several days and brighten by about 30% before the onset of the x - ray outburst . in this article",
    ", we examine only one aspect of the complex behavior of gro j165540 in outburst , namely , the properties of the optical precursor and the x - ray outburst , and what they imply for models of quiescent bhts and for the outburst mechanism . as argued by orbm",
    ", the substantial delay between the optical eruption and the x - ray outburst ( which we refer to hereafter as the `` x - ray delay '' ) may provide support for the advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) model of the inner regions of the quiescent accretion disk .",
    "one outburst mechanism that has been developed for sxts is the mass transfer instability ( hameury , king & lasota 1986 ) ; however , in general it can not reproduce the characteristic timescales of sxts and it has therefore been rejected ( gontikakis & hameury 1993 ) .",
    "it is now clear that the outburst mechanism must be due to a disk instability .",
    "a natural candidate for such an instability is the thermal ( and viscous ) instability resulting from abrupt changes in opacities when hydrogen becomes partially ionized .",
    "such a mechanism explains successfully dwarf nova outbursts in the framework of the disk instability model ( dim ) ( see cannizzo 1993 and references therein ) .",
    "the dwarf nova dim has been extended to sxts by mineshige & wheeler ( 1989 ) ( see also cannizzo , chen & livio 1995 ) .    the dim requires the quiescent accretion disk to be in a cold state ; the accretion rate therefore has to be everywhere lower than a critical accretion rate @xmath4 where @xmath5 ( see e.g. ludwig , meyer - hofmeister & ritter 1994 ) .",
    "this in turn implies that the accretion rate onto the compact object required by the dim is extremely low @xmath6 g s@xmath2 ( mineshige & wheeler 1989 ; lasota 1996a ) .",
    "however , observations of x - ray emission from quiescent bhts imply accretion rates which are several orders of magnitude higher ( mcclintock , horne & remillard 1995 ; verbunt 1996 ; narayan , mcclintock & yi 1996 ( nmy ) ; narayan , barret & mcclintock 1997 ( nbm ) ; robinson et al . 1997 ) . a similar problem is encountered in some quiescent dwarf novae ( see e.g. lasota 1997 ) .",
    "it is clear therefore that the standard dim can not apply to bhts ( lasota 1996a , b ) ; furthermore , in some cases it must be modified even to describe dwarf - nova outbursts ( meyer & meyer - hofmeister 1994 ; livio & pringle 1992 ) .    a model for sxts in quiescence",
    "was proposed by nmy in which the accretion flow occurs as a thin disk only outside a transition radius @xmath7 schwarzschild radii , while for @xmath8 the flow forms an advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) ( abramowicz et al . 1995 ; narayan & yi 1994 , 1995 ; for a recent review see narayan 1997 ) . in the nmy model ,",
    "the observed x - rays are emitted with a very low efficiency by the adaf while the uv and optical luminosity is produced by the outer disk .",
    "however , lasota , narayan & yi ( 1996 ) pointed out that the nmy model is not self consistent because the outer disk is relatively hot and therefore subject to a thermal instability , contrary to the assumed stationarity ( see also wheeler 1996 ) .",
    "more recently , nbm have shown that self - consistent models for the spectra of v404 cyg and a062000 can be obtained by an adaf that extends outward to @xmath9 schwarzschild radii .",
    "for these models , the accretion disk is cool and the optical / uv flux is mostly supplied by synchrotron emission from the adaf . in such a model , the transient outburst originates in the outer cold disk and is due to a dwarf - nova type instability .    in section 2",
    ", we discuss the consequences of the delay between optical and x - ray , and in section 3 we develop an adaf model for gro j165540 in quiescence . in section  4",
    "we demonstrate that a time - dependent model of the outburst of gro  j165540 implies the existence of a two - component accretion flow .",
    "the parameters determined for this flow agree with the parameters independently determined in section  3 .",
    "the x - ray delay observed in the outburst of gro j165540 is analogous to the well known uv delay observed for dwarf novae ( e.g. warner 1995 , and references therein ) . for dwarf",
    "novae the rise in the uv flux starts about 5 to 15 hours after the beginning of the optical outburst . in the framework of the standard disk instability model ( dim ) one can interpret the uv - delay as due to an `` outside - in '' ( or type a ) outburst . according to the dim ( e.g. cannizzo 1993 , and references therein ) , a thermal instability in the outer disk creates an inward propagating heat front .",
    "this front transforms the disk from a cold ( quiescent ) state to a hot state .",
    "because the uv flux is mainly emitted close to the white dwarf , one expects a delay in its rise , a delay equal to the time it takes the front to travel from the outer disk to the white dwarf . in the dim ,",
    "however , the calculated travel time of the front is much shorter than the observed uv - delay time ( pringle , verbunt & wade 1986 ; cannizzo & kenyon 1987 ) .",
    "thus , in its standard form the model fails to explain the uv - delay .",
    "two solutions have been proposed in order to rescue the dim ; both of them invoke a central `` hole '' in the accretion disk . at the edge of such a hole",
    ", an inward moving heat front would have to stop .",
    "the hole would then fill up on a viscous time scale , which is much longer than the heat front propagation time .",
    "livio & pringle ( 1992 ) suggested a mechanism for creating such a hole : they argued that at quiescent mass accretion rates , the magnetic field of a weakly - magnetized white dwarf can disrupt the inner accretion disk .",
    "they showed that such a model can reproduce the uv - delay observed in dwarf nova outbursts .",
    "this model can not apply to systems in which the accreting object is a black hole , since a black hole can not support a permanent magnetic field .",
    "meyer & meyer - hofmeister ( 1994 ) proposed a different scheme for quiescent accretion onto a white dwarf that also results in a central hole .",
    "they invoke inefficient cooling in the disk s upper layers , which leads to the formation of a hot corona and ultimately to the evaporation of the inner disk . as a result ,",
    "the inner accretion flow consists of a pure coronal plasma .",
    "a similar solution for quiescent sxts has been independently proposed by nmy . in both cases",
    ", the hot inner flow provides a natural explanation for the hard x - ray emission observed in quiescent dwarf novae and sxts .",
    "whether a hole is created by magnetic fields or by evaporation , the effect on the outburst of a dwarf nova is similar : when the heat front arrives at the inner edge of the truncated disk it can not propagate any further ; the ( surface ) density contrast slowly fills up the hole on a viscous time scale , thereby producing the required delay of the uv outburst .    below",
    "we show that the observations of the april 1996 outburst of 16 imply the presence of a two - component accretion flow in this system , and that the parameters deduced from observations agree very well with a model comprised of an outer cold disk and an inner hot adaf , as proposed by nbm .",
    "we assume that the april 1996 outburst of 16 was triggered by a dwarf - nova type instability in a standard cold disk , which extends from the transition radius @xmath10 to some outer radius @xmath11 .",
    "this disk is most probably marginally stable with respect to this instability ( e.g. lasota et al .",
    "1996 ) , or it may be globally unstable ( see below ) .",
    "once the instability is triggered , the resulting heat front propagates with the speed @xmath12 ( meyer 1984 ) , where @xmath13 is the equatorial - plane sound speed in the hot phase .",
    "thus , the time it takes for the front to travel a distance @xmath11 is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the central disk temperature , and @xmath16 the radius in units of @xmath17 cm .",
    "if the instability starts at a sufficiently large radius , the front may take up to a day to reach the inner edge of the disk ; this has been proposed by orbm as the origin of the observed delay between the i , r , v and b light curves .",
    "although very tempting , this explanation suffers from the fact that for any reasonable values of the radius and the primary mass , the effective temperature jumps to 10,000  11,000 k on a thermal time scale at the point where the instability sets in . at these temperatures ,",
    "b  v @xmath18 0 , v ",
    "i @xmath18 0 , and the b , v and i magnitudes should increase simultaneously .",
    "dilution of the disk light by the adaf and secondary light does not alter this conclusion . thus the disk instability model can not easily account for a one day delay at optical / ir wavelengths .",
    "it is interesting to note that the observations of orbm do not quite cover the very initial rise of the outburst , since their first observation shows that the r , v and i fluxes have already risen , whereas the b flux remains at its quiescent value .",
    "this indeed implies the existence of a delay ; however , the value obtained by orbm assumes a linear extrapolation , which may overestimate the delay for two reasons .",
    "the initial rise could be very non linear , with a sharp increase of the optical light from the disk , in which case the delay could be only a few hours .",
    "another possibility is that the mass transfer rate from the secondary may have significantly increased since the previous observation of the source in quiescence , one month prior to the outburst .",
    "in fact , it is quite plausible that such an increase could have triggered the thermal instability that caused the april 1996 outburst . in any case",
    ", such an increase in the mass transfer rate would not show up in the b - band because the quiescent temperature of the system does not exceed 6500 k.    when the heat front arrives at the transition radius @xmath10 where the dense ( cold ) disk ends , it can not propagate any further towards the black hole ; however , the resulting ( surface ) density contrast will propagate inward due to viscosity .",
    "the speed at which the density `` front '' propagates is @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the kinematical viscosity ( @xmath21 ) and @xmath22 is the scale of the density gradient .",
    "the density contrast will travel a distance @xmath10 in a time @xmath23 the width @xmath22 can be written as ( see e.g. cannizzo 1996 ) @xmath24 where we expect @xmath25 to be @xmath26 .    if we identify the observed x - ray delay with t@xmath27 we can estimate the transition radius as @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the mass of the central black hole , and @xmath32 is the x - ray delay time in days .",
    "( here and elsewhere we use the symbols @xmath33 and @xmath34 to refer to the radius in physical units and schwarzschild units , respectively . ) for @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , one obtains @xmath38 which shows that the transition between the hot adaf and the cold outer disk occurs at @xmath39 .",
    "remarkably , this same value of the transition radius was deduced for models of two bht by nbm in a completely independent way .",
    "furthermore , in the next section we show that @xmath39 is close to the radius at which the outer disk becomes unstable to the dwarf - nova instability .",
    "the outer disk radius in 16 is @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the orbital period .",
    "we have seen in the previous section that the x - ray delay in the outburst of 16 requires that the quiescent state of the system must consist of a two - zone flow .",
    "the thin accretion disk can extend only down to a transition radius @xmath42 which has to be greater than a few thousand schwarzschild radii . inside this radius ,",
    "the flow must either be absent or must have a much lower density than in the thin disk .",
    "this picture is very similar to the two - zone model proposed by nmy and nbm for fitting the spectral data of v404 cyg and a062000 in quiescence ; in that model , the flow inside the transition radius consists of an extremely hot two - temperature adaf .",
    "here we use the adaf plus thin disk model to fit the spectral data on 16 in quiescence and thereby estimate some key parameters of the quiescent accretion flow .",
    "we first select a set of system parameters for 16 that we use as inputs to our models for the source .",
    "these include the black hole mass , the binary inclination , the distance , and the velocity at the inner edge of the outer thin accretion disk .",
    "second , we summarize the multiwavelength data ( x - ray , optical and radio ) that we use to constrain our models of the quiescent state .",
    "finally , we use the spectral data to constrain the remaining parameters of the model .",
    "the mass of the black hole in 16 and the inclination of the system are very well determined : we adopt m@xmath43  m@xmath44 and @xmath45 ( ob ) . in  2.2 , we estimated the outer radius of the thin accretion disk to be @xmath46 ; in the spectral models we take @xmath47 .",
    "this parameter does not need to be determined very accurately since it has very little effect on the results .",
    "based on studies of the radio jets , we adopt a distance of d = 3.2 kpc ( hjellming & rupen 1995 )",
    ".    dynamical and geometrical information about the thin accretion disk can be obtained from studies of the broad , double - peaked balmer lines ( smak 1981 ; horne & marsh 1986 ) , and from this the transition radius @xmath48 can be constrained . of interest here is @xmath49 , the projected velocity at the inner edge of the thin accretion disk .",
    "estimates of this velocity have been inferred for several sxts from orbit - averaged profiles of the h@xmath50 emission line ( see nmy , and references therein ) .    16 is a difficult case because of the strong h@xmath50 absorption line present in the spectrum of the f subgiant secondary , and because of the relative brightness of the secondary . in order to obtain a useful spectrum at h@xmath50 , we formed a sum of 73 spectra that had been collected over a wide range of orbital phase in 1995 april - may when the system was near quiescence ( bailyn et al . 1995 ) , and then subtracted the spectrum of the best - fitting f5iv star ( orosz 1996 ) . in this way we measured the width of the h@xmath50 emission line and estimated @xmath49 @xmath51 1045 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the inner edge of the thin disk , or equivalently the transition radius @xmath48 between the thin disk and the adaf , is then estimated to be @xmath52 ( nbm ) .",
    "we present below models corresponding to a range of values of @xmath53 consistent with this constraint .",

    "this is consistent with the osse limit .",
    "recall , however , that the inferred start time of the x - ray rise at 212 kev is 25.4 @xmath59 0.8 april 1996 ( orosz et al .",
    "so the batse limit includes a @xmath18 5day period when the 212 kev x - ray outburst was underway .",
    "we have attempted to fit the quiescent spectral data on 16 using an adaf plus thin disk model , analogous to the models described in nbm .",
    "the solid lines in fig . 2 represent four models , where each model consists of a pure adaf for radii @xmath68 , and a thin accretion disk in the radius range @xmath69 .",
    "the models correspond to @xmath70 and 3.0 , respectively .",
    "the transition from the thin disk to the adaf in these models occurs via evaporation into a corona , as described in nbm .",
    "the models assume equipartition between gas and magnetic pressure ( @xmath71 in the notation of nmy and nbm ) and the viscosity parameter is taken to be @xmath37 in the adaf region .",
    "it is assumed that a fraction 0.001 of the viscous energy directly heats the electrons in the adaf ( and the corona ) while the remaining 0.999 of the energy goes initially into the ions ( i.e. @xmath72 , see nbm for details ) .",
    "the shape and normalization of the computed spectra are quite insensitive to the values chosen for @xmath48 , @xmath25 , @xmath63 and @xmath73 ( see figures 35 in nbm ) .    in each model , only one parameter has been adjusted , namely the mass accretion rate .",
    "this has been optimized such that the model flux in the asca band agrees with the observed flux .",
    "despite the large range of @xmath48 covered by the four models , the mass accretion rates vary very little from one model to another ; in eddington units , the accretion rates range from 0.0034 to 0.0037 , which correspond to physical accretion rates of @xmath74 .",
    "thus , the spectral models constrain the @xmath75 of 16 in quiescence quite well .",
    "technically , the models determine only the parameter combination @xmath76 and so @xmath77 depends on a knowledge of @xmath63 .",
    "however , the value of @xmath63 in adafs is fairly well - constrained by the various studies done to date ( narayan 1997 ) , and is unlikely to vary by more than a factor @xmath78 either way from the value we have assumed , @xmath37 .",
    "this suggests that the above estimate of @xmath75 in the adaf is good to about a factor @xmath79 .",
    "the models shown in fig .",
    "2 are consistent with all the measurements available at this time , including the osse and vla limits ( which are not shown in fig .",
    "2 ) . note , in particular , that the models fit the observed optical flux , predict the correct slope in the asca band , and lie below the rosat flux limit .",
    "a rather obvious point is that the quiescent data are incompatible with any model which is based only on a thin accretion disk .",
    "the rosat and asca data clearly indicate that ( 1 ) the x - ray flux of 16 in quiescence lies below the optical flux , and ( 2 ) the x - ray spectrum is quite hard , with a photon index @xmath80 ( 2 @xmath81 ) .",
    "a thin accretion disk model , with either a constant or variable @xmath75 as a function of radius , can not possibly reproduce such a spectrum .",
    "thus , 16 is similar to a062000 and v404 cyg ( see nmy and nbm ) , where again the quiescent spectra are found to be inconsistent with a pure thin disk model but are fitted well with an adaf plus thin disk model .",
    "although the spectral fit does not help us to determine @xmath48 , it is possible to obtain a fairly strong constraint on @xmath48 by considering the stability of the outer thin disk ( lasota et al .",
    "1996 , nbm ) .",
    "specifically , the outer disk will be unstable to the dwarf nova instability if it has an effective temperature greater than about 5000 k , and therefore the quiescent disk can not exceed this temperature at any radius .",
    "the four models presented in fig .",
    "2 , with @xmath82 , have maximum effective temperatures in their disks of @xmath83 @xmath84 kelvin respectively .",
    "the requirement @xmath85 k thus provides the constraint @xmath86 , or @xmath87 . just prior to outburst",
    ", we expect the thin disk to be very close to the limiting value of @xmath88 .",
    "we therefore estimate that 16 had its transition radius at @xmath89 , or @xmath90 cm , at the time of the april 1996 outburst .",
    "in this section , we present numerical simulations of the dwarf nova instability in the outer disk of 16 .",
    "we compare the results with observations of the early stages of the outburst , paying particular attention to the 6day delay between the optical and x - ray outburst .",
    "we also compare the mass accretion rate implied by the outburst calculations with the quiescent @xmath75 determined independently in the previous section .",
    "the calculations presented here have been done with the code described in hameury et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .    in the following we assume that the mass transfer rate from the companion star , i.e. the accretion rate at the outer rim of the accretion disk , has the value given by ob , viz .",
    "@xmath91 . for this value of @xmath92 ,",
    "the outer cold disk is unstable to the dwarf nova instability ( see e.g. ludwig et al .",
    "1994 ) , and so we are guaranteed that the code will produce an outburst .",
    "we assume that the transition between the outer thin accretion disk and the adaf is due to evaporation into a corona which gradually erodes matter in the disk as the cold inflowing material approaches the transition radius ; such a model has been proposed for dwarf novae by meyer & meyer - hofmeister ( 1994 ; see also nmy & nbm ) .",
    "we have estimated the evaporation rate by the following approximate method .",
    "narayan & yi ( 1995 ) have derived that the maximum allowable mass transfer rate in the adaf at small radii is @xmath93 ( in eddington units ) and that @xmath94 decreases at large radii ( @xmath95 ) ( see also abramowicz et al .",
    "1995 ) . assuming that the mass transfer rate within the inner adaf is equal to the maximum , and using m@xmath96 , we adopt the the following approximate prescription for evaporation : @xmath97 where @xmath98 is a constant which is adjusted so as to give the required value of the transition radius , and @xmath99 is the transition radius in units of 10@xmath100 cm .",
    "the local surface density evaporation rate is then related simply to the derivative of @xmath101 with respect to @xmath33 , i.e. @xmath102 this prescription for the evaporation is numerically close to the formula given by meyer & meyer - hofmeister ( 1994 ) .    according to the dwarf nova dim",
    ", the accretion rate in a quiescent disk must satisfy @xmath103 where we have taken @xmath104 from ludwig et al .",
    "the disk first becomes unstable at its inner edge when @xmath75 in the disk reaches the critical value near the transition radius .",
    "this triggers an inside - out outburst .",
    "since most of the mass evaporation occurs close to the transition radius , the condition for the outburst is equivalent to the requirement @xmath105 . for @xmath106",
    ", we then find @xmath107 as we showed in the previous section , 16 in quiescence requires a transition radius @xmath108 cm , which means that we require a value of @xmath98 of order a few . in the detailed calculations presented below we have selected @xmath109 , which gives @xmath110 cm for the quiescent model just before outburst . in this model , the mass transfer rate feeding the adaf prior to the onset of the instability",
    "is found to be @xmath111 , which is in excellent agreement with the @xmath75 in the adaf estimated in sect .",
    "3 ( @xmath112 for @xmath113 ) by fitting the spectrum of 16 in quiescence .    in the presence of evaporation",
    "the usual disk equation for mass conservation has to be modified as follows : @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the surface column density in the disk , and @xmath116 is the radial velocity . because the evaporation law is independent of @xmath115 , evaporation results in a disk which is sharply cut off at the transition radius @xmath10 .",
    "we thus use as an inner boundary condition the relation @xmath117 once the outburst begins , the transition radius moves in and reaches @xmath118 , the inner edge of the grid . when this happens , in order to avoid numerical complications , we switch to the standard inner boundary condition , @xmath119 .",
    "in the calculations presented here , the disk inclination was taken to be @xmath120 , the outer radius of the disk was taken to be @xmath121 cm , and the inner boundary of the grid was set at @xmath122 cm .",
    "our choice of the inner boundary corresponds to @xmath123 rather than @xmath124 , but this is merely for numerical convenience and does not affect any of the results presented here .",
    "once the outburst gets underway and the thin disk extends inward to @xmath125 , the time it needs to travel the additional distance to the black hole is quite short compared to the time it took to move from @xmath126 cm down to @xmath127 cm .",
    "therefore , very little error is made by truncating the numerical simulation at @xmath125 .",
    "the disk viscosity parameter @xmath63 in the simulations varies between 0.035 on the cool branch and 0.15 on the hot branch .",
    "figure 3 displays the initial phases of an outburst seen in the numerical calculations . in this run ,",
    "several outbursts have already occurred , so that the initial assumed density profile in the disc has been relaxed .",
    "the bottom panel shows the magnitude variations @xmath128 in the b , v and i bands , where @xmath129 accounts for the presence of diluting light originating essentially from the secondary ( which dominates over the adaf ) . for simplicity",
    ", we have assumed that @xmath130 is constant , and corresponds to a 48 l@xmath131 secondary with an effective temperature of 6500 k ( ob ) . during quiescence ,",
    "the disk is extremely faint ",
    "fainter than both the secondary and the adaf  and contributes less than 1 % of the total light ; however , in outburst , its optical luminosity , although still smaller than that of the secondary , dominates the adaf , justifying our assumption that @xmath130 is constant .",
    "the b , v , and i magnitudes decrease simultaneously in the calculations ; this is independent of the magnitude of the diluting light @xmath130 .",
    "the slopes however are directly related to @xmath130 : for large diluting fluxes , the logarithm appearing in the definition of the magnitude can be linearized , and one has ( @xmath132 ) @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the disk luminosity and @xmath135 the luminosity of the companion plus the adaf .",
    "the faster rise in the b band is thus simply due to the fact that b ",
    "v = 0 for a disk in the hot state , whereas most of the diluting light comes from the secondary with b ",
    "v @xmath18 0.5 .",
    "this gives a factor @xmath18 1.5 between the slopes of the b and v magnitudes , as observed .",
    "the middle panel in fig .",
    "3 shows the variation of the transition radius with time . once the outburst begins , the mass accretion rate increases significantly and the evaporation is unable to keep up .",
    "the transition radius therefore decreases , slowly at first and then more rapidly as the characteristic viscous time decreases with decreasing radius .",
    "about 5 days after the start of the outburst , @xmath10 moves down to @xmath125 , the inner boundary of the numerical grid .",
    "at later times , we assume that whatever accreted matter reaches @xmath125 will continue down to the black hole in the form of a thin disk , and we calculate the x - ray luminosity accordingly .",
    "the top panel in fig .",
    "3 shows the calculated x - ray light curve .",
    "this has been computed assuming that the emission from the adaf has an efficiency of 0.1% , while the matter flowing through @xmath125 in the thin disk has a standard efficiency of 10% .",
    "we assumed a conversion factor of @xmath136 ergs / count to relate asm counts / s ( 212 kev ) to x - ray luminosity ( ergs / s ) .",
    "this simulation shows that it takes about 5 days for the transition radius to move from its initial value of 10@xmath100 cm to values small enough that x - rays can be emitted , in excellent agreement with the optical to x - ray time delay observed in the april 1996 outburst of 16 ( orbm ) .",
    "this explanation of the observed delay is the most outstanding success of the present calculations .",
    "the simulations predict that the various optical bands should go into outburst simultaneously , whereas in the observations the outburst occurred first in the i band , followed by the other bands in the order r , v , and b , spread over a time range of about a day .",
    "the model does not reproduce the delays in the optical bands , but , as explained in sect .",
    "2.2 , this delay could result from an earlier increase in the mass transfer rate that occurred less than a month before the outburst , and could well have caused it .",
    "it is also worth noting that our optical light curves deviate significantly from linearity during the first two days , whereas the subsequent evolution shows an almost linear variation of the optical magnitudes .",
    "this suggests that it may be somewhat difficult observationally to identify the relative time of outburst in various optical bands .    both the quiescent mass transfer rate into the adaf and the inner disk radius are solely determined by the evaporation law .",
    "on the other hand , the x - ray delay corresponds to the time it takes to rebuild a standard inner disk , and is thus proportional to the mass of the disk , and inversely proportional to the mass transfer rate at the transition radius .",
    "this mass transfer rate depends essentially on @xmath137 , the ratio of the shakura - sunyaev viscosity parameter in the hot and cold states of the disk .",
    "therefore , an increase in @xmath98 results in a smaller transition radius and a smaller adaf luminosity ; the corresponding shortening of the x - ray delay can in turn be compensated for by taking a smaller @xmath138 , i.e. by increasing the viscous time .",
    "the calculations described so far show that a two - component accretion flow model consisting of an outer thin disk and an inner adaf explains most of the key observations of 16 .",
    "it explains the quiescent spectrum of the source as well as the characteristics of the outburst , notably the x - ray delay .",
    "we argued in  3 that the quiescent spectrum of 16 can not be explained by a pure thin disk .",
    "we now show that a pure thin disk model has difficulty in reproducing the outburst observations .",
    "we consider two models for which the thin disk extends down to @xmath122 cm .",
    "the first model describes an inside - out outburst ( solid lines in fig .",
    "the surface density in the outer parts of the accretion disk was adjusted such as to reproduce the correct slope of the x - ray and optical light curves , the viscosity being as in the previous model .",
    "for this reason , the agreement between the predicted and observed light curves is very good , better in fact that in the case of fig . 3 for which such a fitting procedure was not performed , since we considered a relaxed case ( i.e. after several outbursts ) in order to minimize the number of free parameters .",
    "the x - ray intensity , which increases simultaneously with the optical flux , is initially quite faint .",
    "thus , the x - ray delay depends on the sensitivity of the x - ray detector ; for example , the asm would be unable to detect the x - rays during the first 12 days , and therefore the model predicts an x - ray delay of this order . the delay could be increased further by decreasing the viscosity parameter , which would slow the rise of the x - ray intensity .",
    "however , this would cause the rise in the optical flux to be unacceptably slow .    the second model ( dashed lines in fig .",
    "4 ) describes an outside - in outburst . in order to obtain the longest possible characteristic times , and therefore the most optimistic scenario for the pure disk model",
    ", we started the outburst as far out in the accretion disk as possible . in long period systems like 16 ,",
    "the outer disk is always cold and stable ; therefore to trigger the outburst we added some matter at @xmath139 cm .",
    "the outburst then began at @xmath140 cm .",
    "the viscosity was chosen such as to reproduce the observed x - ray delay ( @xmath141 ) : it takes 2.6 days for the heat front to reach the inner edge of the disk , and an additional 3.1 days for the mass accretion rate to reach 10@xmath142 g s@xmath2 , the level at which the x - ray flux becomes detectable .",
    "thus , this model reproduces the observed x - ray delay .",
    "however , the optical light curves are not in agreement with observations since most of the disk reaches a hot state before the heat front reaches the inner edge of the disk .",
    "consequently , the optical flux increases too rapidly , on a thermal time scale , and then more slowly , on a viscous time scale",
    ". the observed optical light curve does not exhibit such a prominent two - phase behaviour , nor does it show such a rapid optical increase , features which are the signatures of an outside - in outburst .",
    "it therefore appears difficult to reconcile the observations with a pure disk model .",
    "this might not be an insuperable difficulty , but it would most probably require making ad - hoc assumptions about the density profile in the disk and about the viscosity .",
    "even if a candidate model could be contrived , one would also require an explanation for the quiescent x - ray flux that does not invoke accretion , since the whole disk must be in the low state and therefore the mass transfer rate has to be less than @xmath143 g s@xmath2 at the last stable orbit .",
    "such a small rate of mass transfer corresponds to a luminosity of less than @xmath144 erg s@xmath2 , almost six orders of magnitudes below the observed quiescent luminosity .",
    "together , the difficulty of building a viable model plus the near impossibility of explaining the x - ray flux in quiescence rule strongly against the pure disk model .",
    "we have shown that both the x - ray spectrum observed in quiescence and the 6day delay between the optical rise and the x - ray outburst in 16 imply that the accretion disk does not extend in its `` standard '' form all the way down to the last stable orbit ; instead the inner part of the accretion flow is a hot adaf .",
    "it is this adaf region that is responsible for the x - ray emission detected by asca in quiescence .",
    "the outer parts of the disk , located at distances larger than about 10@xmath100 cm in quiescence , are cold and subject to the same thermal and viscous instability as in dwarf novae .",
    "after the instability has been triggered , a heat front propagates inward .",
    "when this heat front reaches the transition radius , the divide between the thick disk and the adaf region , it can not propagate in further until it rebuilds the inner part of the disk on a viscous time scale ( about a week ) .",
    "because the efficiency of energy release in the adaf region is very low , the x - ray outburst starts only when the dense parts of the disk can penetrate far enough in , close to the marginally stable orbit , to allow an efficient transformation of gravitational energy into radiation .",
    "we have also shown that both in quiescence and during the initial outburst the observed properties of 16 are not consistent with a pure locally cooled thin accretion disk without an adaf component .",
    "if one wishes to invoke such a model , one has to ( 1 ) accept that the quiescent x - ray emission is not linked to accretion , and ( 2 ) tune the viscosity and the initial surface density of the disk with some care .",
