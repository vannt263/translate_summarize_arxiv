    "the dna melting transition is an interesting theoretical problem because a quantitative understanding of its mechanism may provide insight into how biological enzymes physically interact with dna  @xcite .",
    "while much theoretical work has examined the role of large nonlinear excitations as a precursor to melting  @xcite , surprisingly little focus has been paid to kinetics of the transition itself . in this article , we use classical and spinodal nucleation theory in conjuncton with simulations to study the kinetics of melting in both short- and long - range versions of the peyrard - dauxois - bishop ( pdb )  @xcite and poland - scheraga ( ps )  @xcite models of dna .",
    "nucleation plays an important role in many systems undergoing a phase transition  @xcite . in homogeneous systems , a droplet forms from a spontaneous fluctuation and",
    "grows into the stable phase . before nucleation",
    ", the system is trapped in a metastable well in a free energy landscape .",
    "the system samples the phase space of this metastable well until a fluctuation drives the system to the top of a free energy barrier that separates the stable and metastable wells . at this point ,",
    "the droplet is referred to as critical and the system is equally likely to nucleate or return to the metastable well .",
    "dna is believed to undergo such a process because its sharp melting curve indicates a first - order phase transition  @xcite and because hysteresis in the melting curve suggests the existence metastable states  @xcite . in addition",
    ", possible nucleation bubbles have been observed via electron microscopy  @xcite .",
    "there is experimental evidence for the presence of long - range ( lr ) interactions in dna  @xcite .",
    "telestability experiments on block copolymers show cooperativity effects over at least 10 - 15 base pairs ( bp )  @xcite while differential melting curves with multistep behavior show cooperatively melted regions of 100 - 350 bps  @xcite . in low salt concentration ,",
    "cooperatively melted regions can be as a large as a few thousand bps  @xcite .",
    "both experimental and molecular dynamics studies suggest that bases beyond nearest - neighbor can effect the enthalpic change that arises from the opening of a given bp  @xcite .",
    "in addition , it is known that nearest - neighbor ( nn ) ps models underestimate the probability of single bp opening  @xcite .",
    "only recently have researchers begun examining how lr interactions affect the dynamics of dna models @xcite . to consider the effects of the interaction range on the kinetic pathway , we simulate the peyrard - dauxois - bishop ( pdb )  @xcite and ps  @xcite models with both nn and lr interactions .",
    "it is well known that lr systems undergoing a phase transition can be quenched into metastable states near a pseudospinodal @xcite . in the mean field ( mf )",
    "limit @xmath2 , this pseudospinodal becomes a well - defined spinodal  @xcite , which is the limit of metastability .",
    "the barrier to nucleation for a @xmath3-dimensional system scales with the interaction range @xmath4 as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the distance away from the spinodal  @xcite . as such",
    ", the nucleation rate is much smaller for lr systems , and , practically , one must get very close to the spinodal to observe nucleation .",
    "nucleation near a spinodal or pseudospinodal is similar to classical nucleation near the coexistence curve in that droplets become critical by reaching the top of a free energy barrier and then either grow or decay with equal probability . unlike classical nucleation , which is initiated by compact droplets that resemble the stable phase  @xcite , spinodal nucleation is characterized by the formation of diffuse fractal - like droplets whose amplitude differs little from the metastable background  @xcite . in addition , the growth modes of classical droplets lie on the droplet surface , while spinodal droplets grow from their center . for these reasons ,",
    "the inclusion or exclusion of lr interactions in dna models makes a substantial difference in regard to the character of nucleation that can be observed .",
    "in addition to changing the qualitative shape of the critical droplet , moving the system toward a pseudospinodal also causes the isothermal susceptibility @xmath7 to diverge .",
    "this effect has been observed in supercooled water  @xcite , and its measurement may be a useful method for determining whether or not nucleation in real dna exhibits spinodal effects . while there is inherent fuzziness in the definition of the pseudospinodal in real systems  @xcite",
    ", practically one can determine both its location and the exponent @xmath1 characterizing the divergence if the metastable lifetime is longer than the measurement time of @xmath7 .",
    "if a spinodal exists for dna , it should in priniciple be possible to measure both the spinodal temperature @xmath8 and @xmath1 .    finally , it is important to note that biological dna is an intrinsically heterogeneous system because of its pseudo - random sequence of bases . in this work ,",
    "we concentrate on homogeneous nucleation , which is purely initiated by spontaneous fluctuations , rather than in heterogeneous nucleation , where nucleation is aided by the presence of boundaries , defects , or other impurities  @xcite .",
    "however , since heterogeneous sequences of bases are clearly important biologically , we simulate random base pair sequences to determine what effects the inhomogeneities have on the kinetic pathways of the transition .",

    "v , we describe the results of our simulations of long and short range pdb and ps models including evidence for nucleation , the shape of droplet profiles and growth modes , and the calculation of the spinodal exponent . we summarize and discuss the practical implications our results in sec .",

    ", we allow this interaction to extend to a range @xmath26 and examine the effect lr interactions have on the kinetic pathways of the transition .",

    "statistical weights are given to bound and unbound segments .",
    "a bound segment is energetically favored because of hydrogen bonding and stacking interactions .",
    "unbound segments are entropically favored because single stranded loops have a much shorter persistence length allowing them to sample a larger configuration of phase space .",

    "the cooperativity @xmath39 is chosen larger than values published elsewhere so that small loops may be observed  @xcite .",
    "it might be argued that we have not motivated our choice for the functional form of the lr interactions .",
    "we have chosen this form two reasons .",
    "first , the functional forms introduced in the original models have several desirable features that we would like to keep in the lr models .",
    "for example , the nonlinear stacking interaction in the pdb model produces a sharper transition than a simple harmonic interaction by making separated strands less rigid than bonded strands .",
    "second , there is theoretical evidence that the detailed form of the lr interaction does not play an important role in determining the quality of the physics .",
    "for example , simple experiments predict that the interaction matrix in the rundle - jackson - brown earthquake model should decay as @xmath40 , but it has been shown that the essential long wavelength physics is captured the model by a much simpler mean - field formulation @xcite . as we show below , the pdb and ps models , which have vastly different functional forms , produce the same qualitative characteristics when the interactions are extended to lr . for these reasons",
    ", we do not believe the exact functional form of the lr interaction will significantly impact the qualitative features we observe in nucleation . since our goal is purely to describe the qualitative differences between dna melting with and without lr interactions , the functional form we have chosen is perfectly suitable .",
    "moreover , since the origin of lr interactions is still unknown , an effective potential provides the most accurate description that can be obtained at present .",

    "second , our simulations of the nn pdb model show recombination of the strands even after complete separation , suggesting again that melting is more likely a fluctuation than a first - order phase transition .",
    "furthermore , van hove argued that phase transitions do not occur in one - dimension for systems with finite - range interactions  @xcite . strictly speaking , his argument does not apply here since it assumes the absence of external potentials .",
    "indeed , one can easily see that one - dimensional phase transitions do occur by considering a one - dimensional ginzburg - landau model with the @xmath0 polynomial expansion terms treated as an external potential . unlike the ginzburg - landau model , the nn pdb does not have a second energetic well to represent the bound state . as shown in section iv , the mean field pdb model does exhibit an entropic well caused by the nonlinear term in the coupling interaction , but the mean field model clearly contains lr interactions .",
    "it seems likely that the nonlinear coupling term is insufficient to induce a phase transition via nucleation when the interaction range is nn . in short , while the melting transition in the nn pdb model seems to be an activated process induced by a fluctuation , it does not appear to transition via true nucleation .",

    "still , it is worthwhile to analyze the particular pathways that the heterogenous systems reported here have taken .",
    "first , one will note that droplets of both models tend to be peaked around areas where the binding strength is weak .",

    "similarly , the critical droplet in nn ps model features two peaks around bp indexes 50 and 100 , which correspond to dips in the binding energy .",
    "particularly noticible is the dip in the critical droplet near bp index 75 that appears between these two peaks .",
    "this dip corresponds to a stronger than average binding strength .",
    "a similar dip in the lr pdb droplet occurs between bp indexes 1000 and 2000 , at which there is a maximum in the binding energy of the strands . while the criticial droplet of the lr ps model shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : heteropslr ] does not correspond to a large dip in the binding energy , the growth mode appears to develop a shoulder on the left side of the droplet at which there is a prominent dip in the binding energy .",
    "these results suggest that while modest amounts of inheterogeneities do not completely distort the qualitative character of the transition , they do make melting pathways at weaker sites more probable than pathways through strongly bound bps .",
    "this would imply that heterogeneities cause only minor changes in the droplet structure but cause appreciable changes in the nucleation rate .",
