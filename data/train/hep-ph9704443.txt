    "bhabha scattering is measured with remarkable precision at lep1/slc energies in two kinematical regions identified by the scattering angle : at small - angle for the luminosity monitoring and at large - angle for the measurements of the @xmath0 properties .",
    "such results require a continuous effort on the theoretical side to maintain the theoretical error on the prediction within a comparable precision and to provide a tool for realistic comparisons with the experimental data ( namely an event generator ) .",
    "we have already given in  @xcite the general description of our approach to the problem , while the features of the first version of our event generator bhagen are described in  @xcite , with instructions on how to get the program and how to use it .",
    "in  @xcite we have considered the higher order qed corrections , including the most relevant contributions and estimating the omitted terms ; in  @xcite a new version of our event generator , bhagen94 , is also announced .",
    "several improvements have been made subsequently to bhagen94 , in order to increase and control its precision , and in  @xcite some results for small - angle bhabha scattering cross - section are presented with the label bg94-new and compared with the results from few other available computer programs : oldbis  @xcite , lumlog  @xcite , bhlumi 2.01  @xcite and 40thieves  @xcite .",
    "the conclusion from the comparisons with the above programs , and also from the use of the new event generator bhagen-1ph , which contains the complete hard photon matrix element  @xcite , is that the hard photon part ( even in the improved version of bhagen94 ) deserves a more accurate treatment to achieve the 0.1% precision , presently aimed at small - angle for luminosity monitoring . to obtain such a result a new procedure and the code bhagen95",
    "are developed .",
    "bhagen95 ( available on request from the authors ) is actually a collection of three programs and in this paper we discuss in detail two of them , as the third one is already discussed separately  @xcite .",
    "the current precision for the cross - section is heavily dependent on the chosen event selection and for our code can be estimated to be about 0.1%-0.2% for typical experimental event selection at small - angle for lep1/slc and lep2 energies . in references  @xcite and",
    "@xcite our results are presented in a variety of different event selections and conditions ( some of those preliminary results are updated in this discussion ) , and compared with the other presently available programs of similar precision : bhlumi 4.03  @xcite , oldbis+lumlog  @xcite , sabspv  @xcite , nllbha  @xcite .",
    "the precision at large - angle depends on the beam energy and also on the event selection used ; in the worst case ( beam energy a few gev above the @xmath0 peak ) can be safely estimated to be about 1% , mainly due to the raise of the incertitude coming from the second order leading logarithmic correction in the @xmath6-interference terms , which are still unknown and usually are assumed to be the same as in the @xmath7-channel . for the other energy ranges at lep1/slc , and at lep2 , one can expect with relatively loose cuts a typical accuracy of 0.5% , which can be usefully compared with the other presently available programs , in the conditions they are suited for : alibaba  @xcite , zfitter  @xcite , topaz0  @xcite , bhagene3  @xcite , unibab  @xcite , bhwide  @xcite , sabspv  @xcite .",
