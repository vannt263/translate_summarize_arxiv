    "during last several years enormous progress has been made in the determination of the neutrino masses and mixings and in studies of the neutrino mass matrix .",
    "the main theoretical challenge is to understand the dynamics behind the observed pattern of neutrino masses and mixing .",
    "it is expected that detailed information of the neutrino mass spectrum and lepton mixing may eventually shed light on the origin of lepton masses , quark lepton symmetry and the fermion mass problem .",
    "the main objectives of the neutrino physics include the determination of the absolute mass scale of neutrinos , their mass spectra/ mass hierarchy and also the subdominant structure of mixing : namely 1 - 3 mixing , deviation of 2 - 3 mixing from maximality and the cp violating phases .",
    "however , there exist a large number of the possible structures of neutrino mass matrix .",
    "several proposals have been made in literature to restrict the form of the neutrino mass matrix and to reduce the number of free parameters which include presence of texture zeros @xcite , requirement of zero determinant @xcite , the zero trace condition @xcite .",
    "in addition , the presence of vanishing minors @xcite , and the simultaneous existence of a texture zero and an equality @xcite has been studied in the literature .",
    "however , the current neutrino oscillation data is consistent with only a limited number of texture schemes .",
    "detailed phenomenological analysis of the two texture zeros @xcite has been done in the past .",
    "the seesaw mechanism for understanding the scale of neutrino masses is regarded as the prime candidate not only due to its simplicity but also due to its theoretical appeal . in the framework of type",
    "i seesaw mechanism @xcite the effective majorana mass matrix @xmath0 is given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the dirac neutrino mass matrix and @xmath3 is the right handed majorana mass matrix .",
    "it has been noted by many authors @xcite that the zeros of the dirac neutrino mass matrix @xmath2 and the right handed majorana mass matrix @xmath3 are the progenitors of zeros in the effective majorana mass matrix @xmath0 .",
    "thus , the analysis of zeros in @xmath2 and @xmath3 is more basic than the study of zeros in @xmath0 .",
    "however , the zeros in @xmath2 and @xmath3 may not only show as zeros in effective neutrino mass matrix .",
    "another interesting possibility is that these zeros show as a vanishing minor in the effective mass matrix @xmath0 .",
    "phenomenological analysis of the case where the zeros of @xmath3 show as a vanishing minor in @xmath0 for diagonal @xmath2 has been done recently @xcite .",
    "this , however , is not the most general case . in the present work",
    "we explore the more general possibility of simultaneous existence of a texture zero and a vanishing minor in @xmath0 .",
    "such texture structures are realized via seesaw mechanism when there are texture zeros in @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "simultaneous existence of a texture zero and a vanishing minor restricts the form of neutrino mass matrix and hence reduces the number of free parameters to five .",
    "these texture structures can be generated through the seesaw mechanism and realized by a discrete abelian flavor symmetry @xcite .",
    "we present the detailed analysis for such texture structures and examine their phenomenological implications .",
    "it is found that there are thirty six such texture structures twenty one of which reduce to two texture zero form which have been extensively studied in the literature .",
    "we analyse the remaining fifteen texture structures and find that only six structures are consistent with the available data .",
    "we study the phenomenological implications for these texture structures and present their symmetry realization .",
    "we reconstruct the neutrino mass matrix in the flavor basis ( where the charged lepton mass matrix is diagonal ) assuming also that neutrinos are majorana particles . in this basis",
    "a complex symmetric neutrino mass matrix can be diagonalized by a unitary matrix @xmath4 as @xmath5 where    @xmath6 = @xmath7    the matrix @xmath0 can be parameterized in terms of three neutrino mass eigenvalues ( @xmath8 ) , three neutrino mixing angles ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) ( solar , atmospheric and the reactor neutrino mixing angles respectively ) and the dirac type cp- violating phase @xmath12 . the two additional phases @xmath13 and @xmath14 appear if neutrinos are majorana particles . here",
    "the matrix @xmath15 where @xmath16 with @xmath17 and @xmath18 and    @xmath19    is the diagonal phase matrix with the two majorana type cp- violating phases @xmath13 , @xmath14 and dirac type cp- violating phase @xmath12 .",
    "the matrix @xmath4 is called the neutrino mixing matrix or the pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns ) matrix @xcite . using eq . ( 3 ) and eq . ( 4 ) , the neutrino mass matrix can be written as @xmath20 the cp violation in neutrino oscillation experiments can be described through a rephasing invariant quantity , @xmath21 @xcite with @xmath22 . in our parameterization , @xmath21 is given by @xmath23 the observation of neutrinoless double beta decay would signal lepton number violation and imply majorana nature of neutrinos .",
    "the effective majorana mass of the electron neutrino @xmath24 which determines the rate of neutrinoless double beta decay is given by @xmath25    the experimental constraints on neutrino parameters at 1 , 2 and 3@xmath26 @xcite are given below : @xmath27 the upper bound on @xmath28 is given by the chooz experiment .",
    "the simultaneous existence of a texture zero and a vanishing minor in the neutrino mass matrix gives ,    @xmath29    these two conditions yield two complex equations viz .",
    "@xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 we denote the minor corresponding to the @xmath33 element by @xmath34 .",
    "the equation of vanishing minor becomes @xmath35 where @xmath36 with @xmath37 as the cyclic permutation of ( 1,2,3 ) .",
    "these two complex eqns .",
    "( 10 ) and ( 12 ) involve nine physical parameters @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and three cp - violating phases @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the masses @xmath39 and @xmath40 can be calculated from the mass - squared differences @xmath44 and @xmath45 using the relations @xmath46 and @xmath47 using the experimental inputs of the two mass squared differences and the two mixing angles we can constrain the other parameters .",
    "thus , in the above two complex equations we are left with five unknown parameters @xmath48 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath12 and @xmath28 which are , obviously , correlated . simultaneously solving eqs .",
    "( 10 ) and ( 12 ) for the two mass ratios , we obtain @xmath49 and @xmath50 the magnitude of the two mass ratios is given as @xmath51 @xmath52 while the cp- violating majorana phases @xmath13 and @xmath14 are given by @xmath53 @xmath54 since , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are known experimentally , the values of mass ratios @xmath55 from eq . ( 18 ) and ( 19 ) can be used to calculate @xmath48 .",
    "this can be done by inverting eqs .",
    "( 14 ) and ( 15 ) to obtain the two values of @xmath48 , viz . @xmath56 and",
    "@xmath57 we vary the oscillation parameters within their known experimental ranges . however , the dirac type cp- violating phase @xmath12 is varied within its full range and @xmath28 is varied in its 3@xmath26 range given by the chooz bound .",
    "the two values of @xmath48 obtained from the mass ratios @xmath58 and @xmath26 , respectively must be equal to within the errors of the oscillation parameters for the simultaneous existence of a texture zero and a vanishing minor .",
    "there are in total thirty six possible structures of neutrino mass matrix [ table 1 . ] with a single texture zero and a vanishing minor . as can be seen from table 1 .",
    ", twenty one structures corrosponds to two texture zero cases which have , already , been studied extensively .",
    "we examine the phenomenological viability of all the remaining texture structures and also present detailed phenomenological implications for the viable structures .",

    "all the phenomenologically viable textures with a texture zero and a zero minor in @xmath59 discussed in this work can be realized in a simple way in models based on seesaw mechanism with a abelian flavor symmetry @xcite . for constructing the required leptonic mass matrices , we consider three left - handed standard model ( sm ) lepton doublets @xmath60(a=1,2,3 ) and three right handed charged lepton singlets @xmath61 . to this",
    "we add three right handed neutrino singlets @xmath62 in order to enable the see - saw mechanism for suppressing the neutrino masses .",
    "for each non zero entry in @xmath63 or @xmath2 we need one higgs doublet .",

    "the bilinears @xmath73 and @xmath74 , relevant for @xmath75 and @xmath76 transform as    @xmath77    while the bilinears @xmath78 , relevant for @xmath79 , transform as    @xmath80    to obtain diagonal charged lepton mass matrix , only three higgs doublets are needed viz .",
    "@xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 . under @xmath69",
    "these scalar doublets get respectively multiplied by @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 so that the charged lepton mass term remains invariant .",
    "the non - diagonal entries of @xmath63 remain zero in the absence of any further higgs doublets .",
    "similarly non - zero entries of @xmath2 and @xmath3 in eq.(28 ) can be obtained by introducing scalar higgs doublets @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 being multiplied by @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath86 respectively under @xmath69 for @xmath2 and by introducing scalar singlet fields namely @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 which get multiplied by @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 under @xmath69 for @xmath3 .",
    "it is important to note that the scalar higgs doublets acquire vacuum expectation values ( vev ) at the electroweak scale , while scalar singlets acquire vevs at the seesaw scale . under @xmath102 the @xmath103 and the neutrino singlets",
    "@xmath62 change sign , while all other multiplets remain invariant . the symmetry realization for different @xmath2 and @xmath3 giving @xmath0 corresponding to our viable textures",

    "we presented a comprehensive phenomenological analysis for the majorana neutrino mass matrices with a texture zero and a vanishing minor .",
    "all these texture structures can be generated through seesaw mechanism when there are texture zeros in @xmath2 and @xmath3 and realized in the framework of discrete abelian flavor symmetry .",
    "it is found that out of a total of thirty six texture structures , twenty one reduce to two zero texture structures which have been extensively studied in the past .",
    "the viability of the simultaneous existence of a texture zero and a vanishing minor in the neutrino mass matrix is studied for the two regions of solutions .",
    "nine out of remaining textures are disallowed by the current data and we presented the numerical analysis for the remaining six texture structures . analytical framework for the two classes with strongly hierarchical mass spectrum",

    "predictions for 1 - 3 mixing angle and the dirac type cp- violating phase are given for the allowed texture structures .",
    "these parameters are expected to be measured in the forthcoming neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "we , also , obtained the lower bound on the effective majorana mass for different classes . in the end",
    ", we presented the symmetry realization of these texture structures which are generated via the seesaw mechanism .",
    "however , the evolution of the yukawa coupling matrices of the mass operators in models with multi higgs doublets is an important issue since the evolution of the coupling matrices from the seesaw scale down to the electroweak scale may alter the predictions of the models under consideration .",
    "however , these corrections , in general , are expected to be neglegibly small except perhaps for the case of a degenerate neutrino mass spectrum which needs to be investigated carefully .",
