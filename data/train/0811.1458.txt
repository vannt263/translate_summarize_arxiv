    "the present neutrino experimental data @xcite exhibit that the atmospheric neutrino deficit points toward a maximal mixing between the tau and muon neutrinos , however , the solar neutrino deficit favors a not - so - maximal mixing between the electron and muon neutrinos , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the leptonic pmns mixing matrix .",
    "in addition , although we do not have yet any firm evidence for the neutrino oscillation arisen from the 1st and 3rd generation flavor mixing , there is a bound on the mixing element @xmath14 from chooz reactor experiment , @xmath15 @xcite .",

    "in contrast with other models concerned with the @xmath1 reflection symmetry , we impose the exact symmetry at the gut scale and consider renormalization group ( rg ) evolution @xcite on the neutrino dirac yukawa couplings , heavy majorana neutrino masses and cp phases by running from the gut scale to a seesaw scale .",
    "one of interesting issues concerned with neutrino models with the @xmath1 reflection symmetry is if baryogenesis can be successfully realized through leptogenesis or not .",
    "in fact , high energy cosmological cp violation responsible for baryogenesis vanishes as long as the @xmath1 reflection symmetry is kept exact and flavor effects associated with the charged leptons are not taken into account @xcite .",

    ".    in general , the absolute magnitudes of the lepton asymmetries for each lepton flavor can be larger than that of the total lepton asymmetry .",
    "furthermore , since the interactions mediated by the tau and muon coupling are in thermal equilibrium at below the temperature @xmath27 gev , the processes which wash out lepton number are flavor dependent and thus the lepton asymmetries for each flavor should be treated separately with different wash - out factors .",
    "it has been known that flavor effects can enlarge the area of parameter space where leptogenesis can work .",
    "thus , it is meaningful to investigate if leptogenesis including flavor effects can be successfully realized in the case that leptogenesis without flavor effects does not work successfully . in this paper , we shall examine if the flavor effects on leptogenesis can help to achieve successful baryogenesis in the context of the sm with the @xmath1 reflection symmetry broken by rg corrections . in particular , we shall carefully discuss how the wash - out factors for each lepton flavor can be significant to achieve successful leptogenesis .",
    "in the supersymmetric seesaw model ( ssm ) , the baryon asymmetry of our universe can be achieved leptogenesis via the decays of heavy majorana neutrinos .",
    "one of interesting points is that the lepton asymmetry in the ssm can be enhanced in the case of large @xmath10 because it is proportional to the charged lepton yukawa couplings @xmath28 .",

    "<S> we consider an exact @xmath0 reflection symmetry in neutrino sector realized at the gut scale in the context of the seesaw model with and without supersymmetry . assuming the two lighter heavy majorana neutrinos are degenerate at the gut scale , it is shown that the renormalization group ( rg ) evolution from the gut scale to the seesaw scale gives rise to breaking of the @xmath1 symmetry and a tiny splitting between two degenerate heavy majorana neutrino masses as well as small variations of the cp phases in @xmath2 , which are essential to achieve a successful leptogenesis . </S>",
    "<S> such small rg effects lead to tiny deviations of @xmath3 from the maximal value and the cp phase @xmath4 from @xmath5 imposed at the gut scale due to @xmath1 reflection symmetry . in our scenario , the required amount of the baryon asymmetry @xmath6 can be generated via so - called resonant @xmath7-leptogenesis , in which the wash - out factor concerned with electron flavor plays a crucial role in reproducing a successful leptogenesis . </S>",
    "<S> we show that cp violation responsible for the generation of baryon asymmetry of our universe can be directly linked with cp violation measurable through neutrino oscillation as well as neutrino mixing angles @xmath8 and @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that , in addition to the reactor and long baseline neutrino experiments , the measurements for the supersymmetric parameter @xmath10 at future collider experiments would serve as an indirect test of our scenario of baryogenesis based on the @xmath1 reflection symmetry . + pacs : 14.60.pq , 11.30.fs , 11.10.hi , 98.80.cq , 13.35.hb </S>"
