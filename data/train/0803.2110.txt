    "* case ( i)/(iii ) * if the monodromy group of @xmath26 is 2-transitive then we can find a transformation which takes any two @xmath104 s to any other two .",
    "since , working modulo two , the action on the loops @xmath248 is the same as the action on the @xmath104 , we can find an element of the monodromy group which takes @xmath250 to @xmath257 modulo 2 for all @xmath59 and @xmath62 .",
    "now , the vanishing cycle @xmath8 occurs at the coalescence of two of these @xmath104 s and so must correspond to one of the @xmath258 for some @xmath74 .",
    "thus , there exist paths @xmath259 in @xmath102 such that @xmath260 for all @xmath59 .",

    "the proof then proceeds as above .",

    "in this final section we would like to consider the possibility of generalizing the tangential center focus problem or monodromy problem to the case where the cycle @xmath8 lies in @xmath268 .",
