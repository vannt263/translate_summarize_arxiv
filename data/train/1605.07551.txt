    "the laws of quantum physics dictate that there are certain tasks which are mutually exclusive , meaning that they can not be performed simultaneously with a single device .",
    "this quantum incompatibility is usually encountered in the context of mutually exclusive measurements : one can not measure two orthogonal spin directions @xmath0 and @xmath1 with a single measurement setup . in the modern quantum information point of view",
    ", incompatibility has been identified as a genuine resource gained from switching from classical to quantum protocols . as such , it is at the heart of many typically quantum applications , such as secure quantum key distributions , or the possibility to steer remote quantum systems . due to its importance in these applications as well as its status as a fundamental quantum feature ,",
    "it is essential to gain a deeper understanding of quantum incompatibility .",
    "even though quantum theory gives predictions of outcomes in statistical experiments , the essence of incompatibility is manifested on the level of single experimental runs .",
    "more specifically , for compatible observables it is possible to find a single measurement setup such that on each experimental run , the reading of the measurement outcome allows one to assign the values of the outcomes for the compatible observables .",
    "the prototypical example of this is the joint measurement of a pair of compatible observables @xmath2 and @xmath3 : if @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the outcome sets for @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively , then a joint observable will have the outcome set @xmath6 .",
    "the measurement outcome in each experimental run is therefore a pair of numbers @xmath7 , from which we assign the values @xmath8 and @xmath9 as the outcomes of @xmath2 and @xmath3 . by repeating this procedure multiple times , the resulting distributions",
    "should then correspond to those obtained from the separate statistical experiments of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "this should highlight the distinction between the joint measurement of a pair of observables , and any scenario where the outcome distributions are reconstructed from the full distribution of a third measurement .    in this paper",
    "we take a step away from this usual framework , and study joint measurements of observables in a setting where the experimenter has access to multiple copies of a given quantum system , rather than performing the experiments on each individual copy separately . at first sight",
    "it may seem that the whole phenomenon of incompatibility is lost in such an approach : if two copies of the same system are available , then by measuring @xmath0 on one system and @xmath1 on the other , one has in a sense measured these incompatible observables jointly .",
    "however , things change drastically when one looks at more than two observables .",
    "in fact , by including also a third spin direction , @xmath10 , one gets a triple of incompatible observables which can not be jointly measured even with two copies of the same system .",
    "this approach leads to a new way of treating and quantifying the incompatibility of larger sets of observables , by looking at the minimal number of system copies needed to be able to measure all of them with a single collective measurement .",
    "we will define this number to be the _ index of incompatibility _ of the set . on a more detailed level",
    ", we define the _ compatibility stack _ of a set of observables as a list of hypergraphs expressing the various multi - copy compatibility relations between the observables .",
    "this definition naturally generalizes the joint measurability hypergraphs introduced in @xcite . after these general treatments we focus on the qubit case , where we prove results for the multi - copy joint measurability of triples of noisy qubit observables . in particular , we demonstrate that all compatibility stacks of order 3 have a quantum realization .    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : observables ]",
    "we recall the definition of a quantum observable .",
