    "aql x-1 is the most active of the soft x - ray transients ( sxts ) , having outbursts nearly once per year ( kaluzienski et  al .",
    "1977 , priedhorsky & terrell 1984 ) .",
    "the accreting object is known to be a neutron star ( ns ) due to the detection of type  1 x - ray bursts ( czerny , czerny & grindlay 1987 ) . during outbursts the optical counterpart ( v1333 aql )",
    "brightens by several magnitudes to @xmath5 or occasionally @xmath6 . in - between outbursts",
    "the system fades to @xmath7 , and the spectrum shows k0 - 3  v absorption features as well as emission lines typical of low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs , thorstensen , charles & bowyer 1978 , shahbaz , casares & charles 1997 ) .",
    "the reddening and distance to the optical counterpart have variously been estimated at @xmath8 or @xmath9 , and @xmath10  kpc or 2.3  kpc , based on the observed quiescent colors and spectral type ( thorstensen , charles & bowyer 1978 , shahbaz et  al .",

    "1998a ) .    a photometric modulation at @xmath11  hr is sometimes found during quiescence and mini - outburst .",
    "sxt often show modulations at the orbital period during quiescence due to ellipsoidal effects , and in outburst due to x - ray heating of the accretion disk and/or the secondary ( van paradijs and mcclintock 1995 ) .",
    "interestingly , there are two disparate determinations of the period : shahbaz et  al .",
    "( 1998b ) find @xmath12  hr , while chevalier and ilovaisky ( 1998 ) find @xmath13  hr . this latter modulation was first found during outburst ( chevalier and ilovaisky 1991 ) and appears to be stable over several outburst cycles .",
    "recent quiescent data appear to show a modulation at the same period , and the phase of the quiescent and outburst minima are in agreement ( chevalier and ilovaisky 1998 ) .",
    "if this result is confirmed , the modulation is very likely at the orbital period .",
    "the former modulation was found over a 7  day period when the system was quiescent .",
    "effects which could produce periodicities offset from the orbital period ( ie , outburst superhumps ) should therefore be absent , and the modulation should be at the orbital period . therefore the discrepancy between the two periods is hard to understand .",
    "shahbaz et  al .",
    "( 1998b ) measure a very small ellipsoidal modulation at i - band during quiescence , and use this to estimate the inclination @xmath14 .",
    "however , they also caution that a nearby comparison star shows a similar ( but smaller ) modulation at the same period , and that their aql x-1 measurement may also be interpreted as an upper limit of @xmath2 .",

    "( 1997 ) measure the rotational velocity of the secondary star to be @xmath15  , and also note that the secondary contributes 94% of the quiescent light at 6000 .    the x - ray decay lightcurve , and changes in the x - ray spectrum during the 1997 february - march outburst provide good evidence that the propeller effect dominates the accretion flow in aql x-1 at x - ray luminosities below @xmath16 erg  s@xmath17 ( campana et  al .",

    "the rapid outburst cycle makes aql x-1 an ideal test object for theories of sxt outbursts .",
    "one possible explanation for the rapid outburst cycle of aql x-1 is offered by van paradijs ( 1996 ) , who points out that aql x-1 lies at the boundary of the ( in)stability line of the accretion disk limit cycle ( smak 1983 ) .",
    "the dominance of the secondary during quiescent intervals provides an opportunity to determine the evolutionary state of the system , the orbital period , and the mass function .",
    "a determination of the mass of the neutron star ( which requires accurate knowledge of the mass function and the inclination ) is of particular interest , as the current inventory of neutron star mass measurements is based largely on massive systems ( van kerkwijk , van paradijs , & zuiderwijk 1995 ) .",
    "given that the neutron stars in low - mass systems have different evolutionary histories , and may have formed via different methods ( accretion induced collapse is often mentioned , van paradijs et  al .",
    "1997 ) , there is a possibility their masses may differ .",
    "three low - mass systems in which ns masses have been measured are psr 1012 + 5307 ( callanan , garnavich & koester 1998 ) , cen x-4 ( shahbaz , naylor and charles 1993 ) , and cyg x-2 ( casares , charles & kuulkers 1998 ) .",

    "both the image reduction and photometry ( see below ) were performed using iraf / daophot .",
    "we note that the background images show systematic variations which appear to be caused by the combination of the large pixel size and the relatively crowded field .",
    "these systematics are included in our errors .",
    "the magnitude scale was set via observations of various stars from the ukirt faint standard catalogue ( casali and hawarden 1993 ) .",
    "the k@xmath0-band lightcurve for aql x-1 and a nearby ( presumed constant ) star of similar magnitude is shown in figure  2 .",
    "each light curve has been folded on the orbital period determined by chevalier & ilovaisky ( 1998 ) of @xmath26  hr , using a the t(0 ) determined above for phase zero .",
    "the mean magnitudes for aql x-1 were @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and k@xmath29 .",
    "these errors are indicative of the observed scatter in the aql x-1 k@xmath0 observations , and include the variations found in repeated observations of the standards over the run .",
    "we then binned these two datasets into 12  equally sized phase bins , determining the magnitude error for each bin from the observed variance in the bin .",
    "these data where then fitted to models of the expected ellipsoidal lightcurve , using the model of avni ( 1978 ) as described by orosz and bailyn ( 1997 ) .",
    "this code computes the orbital variations in the projected area of the star in the roche geometry , along with limb and gravity darkening , in order to predict the lightcurve . for q ( ratio of secondary mass to primary mass ) between 1 and 0.1 , the best fit inclination ranges between @xmath30 .",
    "the 68% error range includes zero and is bounded by @xmath31 ; the 90% error range is bounded by @xmath32 .",
    "similar fits to the presumed constant star show minima within a few degrees of zero , and 68% and 90% upper limits at @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectively .",
    "we note that mean variability in the binned data is higher for the standard star than that for aql x-1 : 7.3% vs. 6.4% .",
    "this indicates that the variability is dominated by systematic effects , likely due to the large ( @xmath35 ) pixel size and the very crowded aql x-1 field .",
    "we obtained 26 spectra of on the nights of 7,8 , and 9 june 1997 , using the mmt and blue channel spectrograph .",
    "the spectra cover the wavelength range 3600    7200 with 3.6 resolution .",
    "conditions were clear and seeing was @xmath35 .",
    "exposure times were 20  minutes , and each exposure was bracketed by an exposure of a henear comparison lamp in order to reduce the spectra to a common velocity .",
    "the dispersion is 1.2  pixel@xmath17 , and the s / n in each continuum pixel is @xmath36 .",
    "aql x-1 was near quiescence at this time , as evidenced by photometry with the wo 1.2 m telescope which finds @xmath37 on june 7 , and non - detection by the xte asm .",
    "the images were reduced with standard iraf routines , and spectra were extracted with the iraf longslit package .",
    "velocities were determined via cross - correlations computed with the iraf / fxcor package run against a range of late - type standard stars .",
    "we found that a late k star produced the strongest correlations , and therefore used gj  9698 ( spectral type k8v , @xmath38  , bopp & meredith 1986 ) in subsequent velocity determinations .",
    "we limited our correlations to the wavelength ranges 4900    5850 and 5915    6470 in order to avoid the possible ism contribution in the nad line and the h@xmath39 and h@xmath40 emission lines .",
    "the more heavily reddened sxt gs  2000 + 25 shows weak interstellar lines at 5778 , 6177 , and 6284 ( harlaftis , horne , & filippenko 1996 ) , but we find our results are unchanged if we shorten our wavelength intervals to exclude these lines .    in order to estimate the errors we also extracted the spectrum of a second star which was in the slit and had a magnitude similar to aql x-1 .",
    "if the velocity errors are due only to statistical effects , one expects the errors to scale with the @xmath41 values like @xmath42 ( tonry & davis 1979 ) , with c set such that the @xmath43 under the assumption of a constant velocity for this star .",
    "if the errors are set by systematic effects , then there should be no difference in the scatter for high ( or low ) @xmath41 values . in order to test for systematic effects we first culled out one deviant velocity ( @xmath44 ) which also had @xmath45 .",
    "we then separated the remaining 25 velocities into two groups based on whether the @xmath41 values were above or below the median value .",
    "we find no significant difference in the variance of the velocity data for the high @xmath41 value ( @xmath46 , @xmath47  ) or low @xmath41 value ( @xmath48 , @xmath49  ) groups , and therefore adapt a uniform error for the aql x-1 velocities of @xmath50  .",

    "this best fit sinusoid is plotted in figure  3 .",
    "the 68% confidence limits ( lampton , margon , & bowyer 1976 ) are @xmath57  , @xmath58  , and @xmath59  hjd , 90% limits are @xmath60 , @xmath61(the phase of t(0 ) is not bounded within the 90% limits ) .",
    "these results are unchanged if we fit instead to the 19.30  hour period reported by shahbaz et  al .",
    "( 1998b ) .",
    "we can determine more restrictive limits on @xmath62 if we first limit t(0 ) by accepting the 18.9479  hr period as orbital and projecting the time of optical minimum found in section  2.1 forward to the epoch of our radial velocities , e.g. , @xmath63  hjd .",
    "note that this @xmath56 is consistent with that found above , although one should not assign too much significance to this since the the radial velocity data alone only provide a @xmath64% restriction on the phase of @xmath56 .",
    "these fits show @xmath65  ( 68% limits ) and @xmath66  ( 90% limits ) .    in order to measure the velocities of the h@xmath39 line",
    ", we fit the individual spectra to a single gaussian emission line with a fwhm and amplitude equal to that measured in the averaged spectrum .",
    "the s / n in the h@xmath39 line is high enough that the statistical error in the fitting procedure is typically @xmath36  .",
    "however , as can be seen in figure  4 , the scatter around the best fit is much larger than 5  , possibly because the intrinsic shape of the line is variable . in order to estimate errors on the h@xmath39 velocity curve ,",
    "we have re - scaled the errors until @xmath67 . allowing all three parameters to vary ,",
    "we then find 68% error ranges of @xmath68  , @xmath69  , and @xmath70  hjd .",
    "the 90% error ranges are 50% larger .",
    "as before , @xmath71 is defined to occur when the sine component of the the fit equals zero , which in this case should be when the primary is in front of the secondary , assuming that the h@xmath39 velocities accurately trace the motion of the primary ( ie , 0.5  cycles from t(0 ) ) .",
    "the averaged spectrum of aql x-1 is shown in figure  5 .",
    "h - balmer , hei and heii lines are seen in emission .",
    "the h@xmath39 emission has an measured fwhm of @xmath72 . correcting for the instrumental resolution by subtracting it in quadrature , we estimate intrinsic fwhm of the line is @xmath73 .",
    "we estimate fwzi  @xmath74   at h@xmath39 , although this is a lower limit due to the s / n in the spectrum .",
    "the heii  4686 line does not show the double - peaked accretion disk profile often seen in lmxb and cvs , and has an intrinsic fwhm  @xmath75  , and a fwzi  @xmath76     we do not find any evidence for a li  i  6707 line in the summed spectrum .",
    "the noise level in the summed spectrum corresponds to 0.1  ew per resolution element , so we set a 3@xmath77 upper limit to the ew of this line of 0.3 .",
    "we also note that several photospheric lines with ew  @xmath78 are readily detectable in the spectrum , for example the ca  i  6717 line has ew  @xmath79 .",
    "_ what causes the observed modulations ? _  based on analogy to other lmxb , the 0.6  mag optical modulation seen during outburst in 1996  july is likely due to reprocessing of x - rays in a non - axisymmetric disk and/or in the heated face of the companion ( van paradijs and mcclintock 1995 ) .",
    "as both effects create minima at the same phase , we are not able to distinguish between these two possibilities .",
    "the relative phasing of the outburst and quiescent light curves found by chevalier and ilovaisky ( 1998 ) most likely supports either of these interpretations .",
    "additionally , the agreement between the time of 1996  july optical minimum and the t(0 ) found from our radial velocity data supports these interpretations , but we caution the significance of this agreement is low .",
    "any modulation found during quiescence is likely to be ellipsoidal , since the k - star is very dominant during quiescence .",
    "however , our data does not allow us to clearly detect any quiescent modulation .",
    "shahbaz et  al .",
    "( 1998b ) may detect a quiescent modulation , and are able to determine a time of minimum light . based on the standard model of x - ray reprocessing during outburst and ellipsoidal modulations during quiescence ,",
    "the time of the outburst and quiescent minima should differ by 0.5  cycles .",
    "the accuracy of the period determination of chevalier and ilovaisky ( 1998 ) is sufficient to allow meaningful comparison of the time of minimum light of our outburst modulation to that found in quiescence ( shahbaz et  al .",
    "this difference , @xmath80 cycles , is unexpected if the period is orbital in origin .",
    "this implies that either the orbital period or the time of minimum light in quiescence may be in error .",
    "_ what is the inclination ? _  the empirical relation between the inclination and the amplitude of outburst modulation found in @xmath81  dozen lmxb ( van paradijs and mcclintock 1995 , van paradijs , van der klis , & pedersen 1988 ) leads one to predict an inclination of @xmath82 from our observed 0.6  mag modulation .",
    "this high inclination is unexpected given the much lower inclinations implied by the very small modulations found during quiescence , at i - band ( shahbaz et  al .",
    "1998b ) and at k - band ( this paper ) .    the radial velocity amplitude @xmath62 can provide a measurement of the inclination of the system , if we make the assumption that the component masses in aql x-1 are similar to those in the well studied ns sxt cen x-4 .",
    "this may be a reasonable assumption , since cen x-4 has an orbital period and spectral type ( @xmath83  hr , chevalier et  al .",
    "1989 , spectral type k5 - 7 v , mcclintock and remillard 1990 ) similar to aql x-1 .",
    "previous studies of cen x-4 find that @xmath84   and @xmath85 ( mcclintock and remillard 1990 , shahbaz , naylor and charles 1993 ) .",
    "since @xmath62 scales directly with sin@xmath86 via the mass function , the limits we derive from the radial velocity data alone imply @xmath87 ( 68% ) , or @xmath88 ( 90% confidence limit ) . accepting the 18.9479  hr period as orbital allows even more restrictive limits of @xmath89 ( 68% ) or @xmath90 ( 90% ) .",
    "these limits are much more restrictive than those placed by the quiescent ellipsoidal modulations , and imply that aql x-1 is the lowest inclination sxt known .",
    "_ what are the binary parameters ? _  optical photometry and spectroscopy indicate the secondary star in aql x-1 is of early kv spectral type ( thorstensen , charles & bowyer 1978 , shahbaz , et  al .",
    "1997 ) . dereddening our ir  magnitudes assuming @xmath91 , we find @xmath92 , consistent with g0v  k6v spectral types ( tokunaga 1998 ) .",
    "secondaries in sxt are generally under massive for their spectral type ; for example , the secondary in cen x-4 has been estimated to have a mass @xmath93 ( mcclintock and remillard 1990 ) , so for aql x-1 we expect @xmath94  0.8 ( allen 1973 ) . combining the equation for rotational velocity of the secondary ( @xmath95 ) from wade and horne ( 1988 ) with that for the roche lobe radius from eggleton ( 1983 ) allows one to approximate :      assuming @xmath97  , our 90% upper limit of @xmath98   then allows us to approximate @xmath99  27  km  s@xmath17 .",
    "the more restrictive limits allowed by using the 18.9479  hr period imply @xmath99  16  km  s@xmath17 ( 90% confidence ) .",
    "the one previously published measurement of the rotational speed of the secondary finds @xmath100   ( 68% limits , shahbaz et  al .",
    "this may be consistent with our upper limits at the @xmath101 level .",
    "the assumptions above imply a mass ratio @xmath102@xmath103 .",
    "the mass ratio may also be estimated from the orbital velocity of the h@xmath39 line , if we assume that @xmath104 .",
    "this yields @xmath105 , or assuming @xmath106 , @xmath107 .",
    "while this is inconsistent with the assumed masses for the components at the 90% level , it is consistent at the 95% error level .",
    "one should be wary of mass ratios computed using orbital the velocity of emission lines , as they may not always correctly indicate the velocity amplitude of the primary .",
    "certainly many studies have found that the phase of the h@xmath39 radial velocity curve is not that expected if it accurately tracked the motion of the primary ( orosz et  al .",
    "1994 , filippenko , matheson & ho 1995 ) .",
    "_ caveats _  as an aside , we note that these results assume that the period of aql x-1 is @xmath11  hr . while there is clearly optical modulation at 19  hrs both in outburst and quiescence , the fact that the two independent determinations of the period disagree ( chevalier and ilovaisky 1998 , shahbaz et  al .",
    "1998b ) sheds some doubt on its orbital origin .",
    "some of the apparent discrepancies between the inclination as implied in outburst and in quiescence would be explained if there was an ` interloper ' along the line of sight to aql x-1 , of if the system was triple .",
    "the probability of an interloper within a @xmath108 radius of aql x-1 is rather small at 1.6% , based on the density of stars with v@xmath109 in the aql x-1 field .",
    "the non - detection of the li  6707 line in aql x-1 is interesting in comparison to the quite high equivalent width @xmath110 found in cen x-4 ( martin et  al .",
    "1994 , 1996 ) .",
    "because li is quickly destroyed in the stellar interiors of sxt companions , its detection implies that it is actively being created in these systems .",
    "it may be produced during x - ray outbursts ( martin et  al .",
    "1996 ) or also in the hot adaf during quiescent periods ( yi and narayan 1997 ) . in the latter case , truncation of the adaf at the alfven radius decreases the li production , and it is necessary to postulate a propeller in order to eject detectable quantities of li into the photosphere of the secondary .",
    "aql x-1 has recently been found to contain an efficient propeller consisting of a ns with a @xmath111  ms and @xmath112  g ( zhang et  al .",
    "1998 , campana et  al .",
    "if cen x-4 contains a 31  ms pulsar ( mitsuda 1996 ) then its li production should be much less efficient ( yi and narayan 1997 ) , and the strength of the li  6707 line relative to aql x-1 is difficult to explain . in the former case , the fact that aql x-1 has outbursts much more frequently than all other sxts would lead one to expect a substantial li  6707 line , so it s non - detection is once again difficult to explain .",
    "a possible explanation may lie in the radio observations : martin et  al .",
    "( 1994 ) postulate that non - thermal radio emission seen in outbursts of sxt ( including cen x-4 , hjellming and han 1995 ) is evidence of strong particle acceleration , and that these particles produce li via spallation . despite sensitive radio observations during numerous aql x-1 outbursts , radio emission has been detected only once , at a level of @xmath113  mjy during the 1992 outburst ( hjellming and han 1995 ) .",
    "more typically radio observations set upper limits of @xmath114  mjy ( biggs and lyne 1996 , geldzahler 1983 ) .",
    "this may indicate that aql x-1 is relatively inefficient at producing non - thermal particles , as scaling the observed flux of cen x-4 , at @xmath115  kpc ( mcclintock and remillard 1990 ) , to the distance of aql x-1 leads one to expect @xmath116  mjy during an outburst .",
    "as a word of caution , we note that martin et  al .",
    "1996 show that the strength of the li  6707 line changes with orbital phase in x - ray nova muscae 1996 .",
    "our phase coverage of aql x-1 is incomplete , so we can not discount the possibility that the line is stronger at phases we were not able to cover .",

    "<S> infrared ( k@xmath0-band ) photometry during a quiescent state limits any ellipsoidal variations to @xmath1  mag ( peak - to - peak ) , which implies an inclination @xmath2 ( 90% limit ) . </S>",
    "<S> spectroscopy in a quiescent state shows at most very small radial velocity variations , which implies a very low inclination of @xmath3 ( 90% limit ) . </S>",
    "<S> the low inclination is rather unexpected given the large photometric modulation seen in the active state . </S>",
    "<S> the upper limit to the equivalent width of the anomalous li  6707 line is @xmath4 , which is similar to the measured strength of this line in several other x - ray transients . </S>"
