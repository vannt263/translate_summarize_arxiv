    "the angular correlation function of galaxies has been used to characterize the large - scale distribution of galaxies for over 2 decades .",

    "the observed galaxy distribution is well described by a power law @xmath11 , with slope @xmath12 .",
    "since @xmath0 is a projection on the sky of the 3-dimensional auto - correlation function @xmath13 , the above power law for @xmath0 has been associated with a power law for @xmath14 with slope @xmath15 which is close to the observed value in the nearby galaxy distribution .",
    "measurements of @xmath0 are difficult to interpret as it involves a projection of the galaxy distribution out to redshifts of order 1 ( e.g. for a sample with limiting @xmath3 magnitude of about 24.5 ) .",
    "thus the effects of evolution of large scale structure due to gravitational clustering as well as galaxy evolution need to be understood to interpret @xmath0 .",
    "recently villumsen ( 1996 ) has considered the effect on @xmath0 of gravitational lensing by large - scale structure along the line of sight ( gunn 1967 ) . lensing increases the area of a given patch on the sky , thus diluting the number density . on the other hand ,",
    "galaxies too faint to be included in a sample of given limiting magnitude are brightened due to lensing and may therefore be included in the sample .",
    "the net effect , known as magnification bias , can go either way : it can lead to an enhancement or suppression of the observed number density of galaxies , depending on the slope of the number - magnitude relation .",
    "variations in the number density which are correlated over some angular separation alter @xmath0 .",
    "villumsen ( 1996 ) showed how the linear evolution of density fluctuations along the line of sight can be used to compute the change in @xmath0 due to magnification bias .",
    "the deflections of neighbouring photon trajectories due to lensing by large scale structure are very small , hence the calculation can be done in the limit of weak lensing .",
    "in this paper we compute @xmath0 for different cosmological models taking into account the effects of nonlinear gravitational evolution and gravitational lensing .",
    "since @xmath0 is a 2-point statistic , even in the fully nonlinear regime it is determined completely by the 3-dimensional power spectrum .",
    "we use extensions of the proposal of hamilton et al .",
    "( 1991 ) to include the nonlinear evolution of the power spectrum into the calculation of @xmath0 .",

    "first we shall briefly describe the effect of magnification bias on @xmath0 .",
    "gravitational lensing of a galaxy by dark matter concentrations between us and the galaxy increases the area of the galaxy image while conserving surface brightness .",
    "this results in a magnification @xmath35 which is given by the ratio of lensed to unlensed area of the image .",
    "the amplitude of @xmath35 depends on the convergence @xmath36 , which is the surface mass density divided by the critical density , and the shear @xmath37 through ( young 1981 ) = [ mugen ] in the limit of weak lensing , @xmath38 , applicable to lensing by large - scale structure , the above expression reduces to = 1 + 2[mu ] this magnification has two effects .",
    "since the lensed area is increased due to deflection of the light rays , the number density of galaxies decreases inversely proportional to @xmath35 .",
    "there is a competing effect , however . in a flux limited survey",
    ", magnification brings some faint galaxies above the flux limit , which would not otherwise have been detectable , thus increasing the number density of galaxies . which of the effects wins depends on the reservoir of faint galaxies available , which can be quantified by the slope @xmath39 of the true number counts @xmath40 for a magnitude limit @xmath41 , s= .",
    "the two effects change the galaxy numbers by ( e.g. broadhurst , taylor & peacock 1995 ) n^(m)=n_0(m ) ^2.5s-1 which reduces to n^(m)=n_0(m)[np ] in the weak lensing limit .",
    "in addition , the number density of galaxies is changed by @xmath42 due to intrinsic clustering .",
    "let @xmath10 denote the average number density of galaxies . at a given position in the sky @xmath43 , the number density",

    "these fitting formulae are based on the idea of relating the nonlinear power spectrum at scale @xmath72 to the linear power spectrum at a larger scale @xmath75 , where the relation @xmath76 depends on the power spectrum itself ( hamilton et al . 1991 ) .",
    "they have been calibrated from and tested extensively against n - body simulations . for the linear power spectrum",

    "having specified the shape of the mass power spectrum , we need to set the global cosmological parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the normalization of the power spectrum in turn will depend on these parameters .",
    "the four different cosmological models we consider include : a flat universe with @xmath79 , an open model with @xmath80 , and a flat @xmath74 dominated model , with @xmath80 and @xmath81 . these three models are normalized to cluster abundances , which give the approximate relation ( white et al .",

    "the models with low @xmath61 have higher amplitudes than the models with @xmath73 .",
    "this is because in the former models the growth of perturbations is slowed down at late times ; when normalizing to present - day cluster abundances , this implies a higher normalization at earlier times compared to the @xmath73 models .",
    "this in turn means that nonlinear effects become important earlier on , and lead to a greater effect of nonlinear clustering by today . at large mean redshifts , however , the amplitude for the @xmath74model dips below the @xmath73 , @xmath84 model . here",
    "a competing geometrical effect starts to come in : at a given redshift a physical volume element is larger if @xmath107 than in the absence of a cosmological constant , and therefore the intrinsic clustering is decreased . for @xmath106 , this geometrical effect in the @xmath74model",

    "the flat model with the higher normalization @xmath84 shows a stronger lensing signal than the one with the lower @xmath120 , because the bias factor @xmath93 is smaller , which increases the lensing contribution from the cross - term @xmath121 relative to the intrinsic clustering term @xmath122 .    in the open or @xmath74 model , as compared to the flat model",

    "it is interesting to consider measurable statistics that are more sensitive to the lensing contribution ; in this section we show that the ratio of @xmath0 for red and blue samples is one such example .",
