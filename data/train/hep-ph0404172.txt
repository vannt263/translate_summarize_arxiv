    "the topological approach to baryon structure and dynamics in the framework of an effective action for mesonic chiral fields has achieved a number of remarkable successes .",
    "the soliton concept  @xcite for baryons provides an impressive account of spectrum and properties of baryon resonances ( essentially without numerous missing resonances )  @xcite , with predictive power that recently has even led to the first indications for pentaquarks  @xcite .",
    "model - independent relations between t - matrix elements for meson - baryon scattering  @xcite and explicit results for specific channels are well supported by experimental data  @xcite .",
    "the matrix element of the axial singlet current related to the spin content of the proton is naturally of the observed order of magnitude  @xcite .",
    "the unexpected behaviour recently found  @xcite in the ratio of electric and magnetic proton form factors has been predicted in this approach long ago  @xcite .",
    "the underlying chiral effective action is profoundly based on the @xmath0-expansion of qcd  @xcite , preserving all relevant symmetries .",
    "efforts to include next - to - leading order quantum corrections have brought substantial improvement as expected  @xcite .",
    "the manifestations of a chiral phase transition pose another natural challenge for an effectice theory with a ground state that is characterized by spontaneously broken symmetry .",
    "the possible formation of disoriented domains  @xcite during the growth of the chiral condensate has been in the focus of interest for some time .",
    "but signatures in terms of anomalous multiplicity ratios for differently charged pions have not been observed  @xcite , in accordance with theoretical conclusions  @xcite .",
    "anomalies in anti - baryon production were very early recognized as possible signals for interesting dynamics  @xcite in that phase transition , and the concept to consider baryons as topological solitons in a chiral condensate should lead to quite definite expectations for this process",
    ".    meanwhile , in relativistic heavy - ion collisions at rhic , very high energy densities are being produced in extended spatial regions which are essentially baryon free and well separated in rapidity from the nuclear slabs receding from the collision volume .",
    "the experimental values found in the central rapidity region for the ratio of the integrated @xmath1 to @xmath2 yields lies between 0.065 and 0.075 @xcite .",
    "this is still too close to the thermal equilibrium @xmath3 ratio ( for a typical plasma temperature of @xmath4 mev ) , /^-",
    "~2 ( ( m_-m_p)/)=0.035 to constitute a clear indication for interesting underlying physics . still ,",
    "although the experimental result does not look very exciting , it still poses a constraint for the possible validity of the soliton concept , because any conceivable dynamical production process must be able to produce a comparable number .    in the topological approach",
    "the number of baryon - antibaryon pairs produced during the chiral phase transition depends on two factors : the first is the modulus @xmath5 of the average winding density present in the initial hot field configuration . in analogy to applications in cosmology  @xcite and condensed matter systems  @xcite this quantity is closely related to the coherence length for the local orientations of the chiral field @xmath6 . without detailed knowledge about the initial field configurations this coherence length enters as a parameter and takes away stringent predictive power from the approach . however , different conjectures about the nature of the initial field ensemble suggest typical ranges for the coherence lengths which then may be discriminated by the experimentally observed abundancies .    the second factor is the reduction of the initially present total @xmath7 through the dynamical ordering process , which finally leads to the formation of stable soliton structures embedded in",
    "the topologically trivial ordered chiral condensate of the cold system .",
    "the solitons or antisolitons evolve from topological obstacles which are met by the aligning field orientations , and develop into their stable cold form during the course of the evolution . at the end , the same integral @xmath8 counts the number of finally surviving nontrivial separate structures , so it is identified with the number of baryons and antibaryons created in the process .",
    "the decrease of @xmath9 during the roll - down is reasonably well represented by a power law @xmath10 and the exponent @xmath11 can be measured in numerical simulations .",
    "evidently , the initial time @xmath12 which marks the onset of the evolution , enters here as a second parameter which further reduces the predictive power of the approach .",
    "fortunately , it turns out that @xmath11 is rather small , so the dependence on @xmath12 is only weak .",
    "measuring @xmath11 and the time @xmath13 when the roll - down is completed , presents a typical task for numerical simulations once the equation of motion ( eom ) which governs the field evolutions is implemented on a lattice .",
    "the underlying effectice chiral action is known from other applications , so no additional parameters enter at this point . in condensed matter applications , a phase transition is generally driven by an externally imposed quench , or by a dissipative term included in the eom . in cosmology or in our present heavy - ion application",
    "it is the rapid expansion of the hot volume which drives the cooling process .",
    "this expansion is efficiently implemented  @xcite by transforming to rapidity - proper - time coordinates , i.e. by boosting to the local comoving frame .",
    "this is especially convenient if we consider a system that expands only in one ( longitudinal ) direction with its transverse scales unchanged , ( the bjorken rod ) .",
    "the resulting dilution of the longitudinal gradients drives the system towards its global minimum .",
    "however , as there is no genuine dissipation in the system , the total energy approaches a constant which resides in the chiral fluctuations around the global minimum .",
    "thus , the simulations also allow to estimate pion- or sigma- meson abundancies .",
    "naturally , before the field configurations can roll down towards the global minimum , the potential @xmath14 which underlies the eom must have changed from the hot chirally symmetric form to its cold symmetry - violating form .",
    "but , during the early stages , the evolutions are dominated by local aligning of the field orientation @xmath15 . during this phase",
    "the form of the potential is not important .",
    "so its time dependence can be replaced by a sudden quench where the hot field configuration is exposed to the cold potential @xmath16 , from the outset at initial time @xmath12 . in the following ,",
    "for definiteness we make use of this sudden quench approximation , ( although the simulations , of course , allow to study other cases as well ) .    for the sake of simplicity",
    "we first discuss all relevant features for the case of the 2-dimensional @xmath17-model , with only one spatial dimension transverse to the longitudinal rapidity coordinate . except for computational complexity the extension to the 3-dimensional @xmath18-field",
    "presents no essential new features .",
    "the effective action , its transformation to the bjorken frame , and the resulting eom are presented in section ii .",
    "it is important for the choice of the initial ensemble of field configurations that it allows in a convenient way to monitor the initial coherence lengths because they are the crucial parameters for the final baryon - antibaryon multiplicities .",
    "we choose an isotropic gaussian random ensemble of field fluctuations in momentum space which is characterized by a temperature - like parameter to be able to compare with other approaches .",
    "of course , this is not necessary .",
    "in fact , even at initial time @xmath12 the longitudinally expanding bjorken rod need not be an isotropic system , and it may be physically justified to distinguish already in the initial ensemble two different , longitudinal and transverse correlation lengths .",
    "this is easy to incorporate , but in section iii we present initial conditions which are locally isotropic .    as discussed elsewhere  @xcite stable solitons",
    "shrink in a spatially expanding frame .",
    "therefore , lattice implementations of their dynamics will necessarily involve lattice artifacts after some time .",
    "these are discussed in section iv .",
    "they can be isolated and subtracted from the physically interesting quantities .    in section",
    "v the essential features of typical evolutions are discussed .",
    "estimates for the times of onset and completion of the roll - down are obtained , and the dynamical exponents for the growth of correlation lengths and decrease of defect number are established and compared . the spectrum of the fluctuations remaining after the roll - down is considered and finally the mesonic and baryonic multiplicities are obtained .",
    "the extension to the physically interesting 3 + 1-dimensional @xmath18-field is discussed in section vi .",
    "the topological generalization is well known , the additional transverse dimension is of little influence for the growth exponents .",
    "however , the coupling constants in the effective action here are related to physical quantities , so they are known ( except for some uncertainty concerning the @xmath19-mass ) , and the results can be compared with experimentally determined abundance ratios .    of course",
    ", it would be desirable to obtain a very definite answer whether the topological approach to antibaryon production in a chiral phase transition is validated or ruled out by the data . however , with our poor knowledge about the initial conditions in the hot plasma after a heavy - ion collision , we can not expect much more than allowed ranges for the relevant parameters , which hopefully overlap with standard ideas about coherence lengths and formation times .",
    "for simplicity we first discuss the 2 + 1 dimensional @xmath17 model . it is defined in terms of the dimensionless @xmath20-component field @xmath21 with unit - vector field @xmath15 , ( @xmath22 ) , and modulus ( bag-)field @xmath23 , with the following lagrangian density in @xmath24 dimensions @xmath25    [ lag ] = f_^2(^(2)+^(4)+^(0 ) ) ( @xmath26 is an overall constant of dimension [ mass@xmath27 , so the physical fields @xmath28 are of mass - dimension [ mass@xmath29 ) .",
    "the second - order part @xmath30 comprises the kinetic terms of the linear @xmath19 model    [ l2 ] ^(2)= _ ^ , @xmath31 is the four - derivative skyrme-term ( which involves only the unit - vector field @xmath15 ) defined in terms of the topological current @xmath32 [ top ] ^= ^ ( _ _ ) , ( which satisfies @xmath33 ) [ l4 ] ^(4)=-^2 _ ^= - , and @xmath34 contains the @xmath35 potential and an explicit symmetry - breaker in 3-direction [ pot ] ^(0)=-v(,)=- ( ( ^2-f()^2 ) ^2 - h _ 3 ) - with dimensionless coupling constants @xmath36 and @xmath37 , and [ f2 ] f^2()= f_0 ^ 2()- .",
    "this choice ensures that the global minimum of the potential @xmath38 is always located at @xmath39 .",
    "generically , the function @xmath40 decreases from @xmath41 at @xmath42 towards zero for large @xmath43 .",
    "the constant in the potential ( [ pot ] ) is chosen such that the value of the potential @xmath44 at @xmath45 is independent of @xmath43 , ( given by the constant @xmath46 ) , and at the @xmath47-minimum @xmath48 we have @xmath49 .",
    "the masses of the @xmath50- and @xmath19-fluctuations @xmath51 around this minimum are [ masses ] m_^2= ,  m_^2= + m_^2 . without explicit symmetry breaking , @xmath52 , we assume that @xmath53 changes sign at @xmath54 , such that @xmath55 and @xmath56 for @xmath57 .    the parameter @xmath58 ( with dimension of a length ) which we have separated out from the coupling constants of potential and skyrme term can be absorbed into the spatial coordinates @xmath59 .",
    "so it characterizes the spatial radius of stable extended solutions ( which scales like @xmath60 ) .",
    "as @xmath58 simply sets the spatial scale , it could be put equal to one , as long as no other ( physical or artificial ) length scales are relevant . for lattice implementations ,",
    "however , the lattice constant @xmath61 and the size of the lattice @xmath62 set ( usually unphysical ) scales . to avoid artificial scaling violations we have to ensure that the size of physical structures ( like solitons ) is large as compared to the lattice constant @xmath61 and small as compared to the lattice size @xmath63 .",
    "so , for numerical simulations we have to choose @xmath64 .",
    "it has been shown in ref.@xcite that for solitons which extend over more than at least 4 - 5 lattice units the energy @xmath65 is independent of @xmath66 .",
    "so , in the following we will adopt @xmath67 as sufficiently large .",
    "this appears also as physically reasonable , if we consider typical lattice constants of 0.2 fm and baryon radii of about 1 fm . on the other hand this will require lattice sizes of at least @xmath68 to avoid boundary effects for the structure of individual solitons . unfortunately , in the bjorken frame which we shall use in the following , the longitudinal extension of stable solitons shrinks like @xmath69 as function of proper time @xmath70 .",
    "this means that after times of order @xmath58 the simulations will be influenced by lattice artifacts , which may even dominate for large times .    for rapid expansion in ( longitudinal ) @xmath71-direction",
    "we perform the transformation from @xmath72 to locally comoving frames ( @xmath73,@xmath70 ) with proper time @xmath70 and rapidity @xmath73 , defined through @xmath74 inserting ( [ trafo ] ) into ( [ l2 ] ) and ( [ l4 ] ) leaves the form of @xmath30 and @xmath31 invariant , with @xmath75 replaced by @xmath76 , and @xmath77 replaced by @xmath78 .",
    "the specific structure of the skyrme term again eliminates all terms with four @xmath70- or @xmath73-derivatives . for the effective action we take the integration boundaries from @xmath79 to @xmath80 for rapidity @xmath73 and for the transverse coordinate @xmath81 .",
    "the 3-dimensional space - time volume element @xmath82 is replaced by @xmath83 .",
    "therefore , in a separation of the action @xmath84 in kinetic terms @xmath85 , gradient terms @xmath86 , and the potential @xmath87 , [ s ] s = d_-^+ ddx = ( t_+t_-l_-l_-u ) dthe longitudinal @xmath88-terms involving rapidity gradients carry a factor @xmath89 , while all other terms carry a factor @xmath70 .",
    "so we have t_&=&\\ { ( ) + ^2}ddx,[int1 ] + t_&= & \\ { ^2}ddx,[int2 ] + l_&=&\\ { ( _ x_x ) } ddx,[int3 ] + l_&= & \\ { ( ) + ^2}ddx , [ int4 ] + u&=&\\ { ( ^2-f^2 ) ^2 - _ 3 + } ddx .",
    "[ int5 ] variation of @xmath84 with respect to @xmath6 leads to the equation of motion ( eom ) .    the contributions of @xmath31 to the longitudinal and transverse parts @xmath90 and @xmath91 of the kinetic energy cause certain numerical difficulties for the implementation of the eom on a lattice .",
    "they require at every timestep the inversion of matrices which depend on gradients of the unit - vectors @xmath15 , which multiply first and second time - derivatives of the chiral field .",
    "this can be troublesome in areas where the unit - vectors are aligned , and can be poorly defined in regions where the unit - vectors vary almost randomly for next - neighbour lattice points ( i.e. for initially random configurations , or near the center of defects ) . in any case , stabilizing the evolutions requires extremely small timesteps and leads to very time - consuming procedures .",
    "although these problems can be handled , we have compared the results with evolutions where the kinetic energy is taken from @xmath30 alone . for coupling strenghths @xmath92 within reasonable limits , we find that the resulting differences do not justify the large additional expense caused by the fourth - order kinetic contributions . evidently , the reason is , that the eom determines the field - velocities ( depending on the functional form of the kinetic energy ) in such a way that the numerical value of the total kinetic energy is not very sensitive to its functional form .",
    "we therefore use in the following an effective action where the kinetic terms ( [ int1 ] ) and ( [ int2 ] ) are replaced by [ tkin ] t_=()ddx ,  t_=0 . with this simplification",
    "the eom is [ eom ] _",
    "+ _ -_xx- _ + ( ^2-f^2)- _ 3 + = 0 .",
    "this form has the big advantage that we can make use of the geometrical meaning of the winding density @xmath93 as the area of a spherical triangle , bounded by three geodesics on a 2-dimensional spherical surface . in closed form",
    "it is expressed through the unit - vectors pointing to its corners , and does not involve gradients .",
    "so this allows for a very accurate and fast lattice implementation of the last term in the eom .",
    "we assume that at an initial proper time @xmath12 the system consists of a hadronic fireball with energy density @xmath94 stored in a random ensemble of hadronic field fluctuations .",
    "subsequently , for @xmath95 , it is subject to eom ( [ eom ] ) .",
    "the initial condition and the symmetry of the action imply boost invariance , i.e. the system looks the same in all locally comoving frames , so it is sufficient to consider its dynamics in a rapidity slice of size @xmath96 near midrapidity @xmath97 , which constitutes a section of the initially created bjorken rod with transverse extension @xmath98 .",
    "the energy @xmath99 in this slice then is given by an @xmath73-integral which extends over the finite rapidity interval @xmath96 and represents the energy contained in a comoving volume @xmath100 .",
    "due to the symmetry of the initial condition this comoving volume grows with increasing proper time @xmath70 into spatial regions with high energy density , therefore @xmath101 contains contributions which increase with @xmath70 . the average energy density @xmath102 satisfies @xmath103 .    for numerical simulations",
    "we implement the configurations @xmath104 on a rectangular lattice @xmath105 ( @xmath106 ) with lattice constants @xmath61 for the transverse coordinate and @xmath107 for the rapidity lattice .",

    "its magnitude is controlled by the constant @xmath130 in ( [ gauss ] ) .",
    "it should be sufficiently small to keep the amplitudes of the average initial fluctuations small .",
    "on the lattice the upper limit for the momenta @xmath139,@xmath140 is @xmath141 , ( i.e. @xmath142 ) .",
    "so , as long as [ lamt ] , the lattice cut - off ( upper limit momentum ) imposed by the finite lattice constant is unimportant because the corresponding states are almost unoccupied .",
    "note that periodicity and antisymmetry of the imaginary parts in ( [ albet ] ) requires that @xmath113 vanishes if both @xmath143 and @xmath144 are multiples of @xmath145 .",
    "with the condition ( [ lamt ] ) satisfied , this holds with good accuracy also for the initial configuration picked randomly from the ensemble ( [ gauss ] ) .    the average number of topological defects in a random ensemble of vector configurations is closely related to the characteristic angular coherence length in that ensemble .",
    "therefore , it will be necessary to measure the ( equal - time ) correlation functions for the unit - vector fields @xmath15 for the evolving ensembles . in order to have an analytical result at least for the initial configurations ( where length and orientation of the 3-vectors are uncorrelated ) ,",
    "it is easier to consider the correlations among the full vectors @xmath6 .",

    "apparently , both @xmath87 and @xmath187 , approach a linearly rising limit for @xmath188 , approximately like @xmath189 which dominates the total energy , but does not affect the ( essentially constant ) kinetic energy .",
    "longitudinal contributions drop off like @xmath69 , so they are irrelevant .",
    "it appears from fig.([fig2 ] ) that for this evolution the roll - down ( where the average of @xmath23 aproaches the vacuum value @xmath190 ) takes place during the time interval @xmath191 , i.e. long before artificial lattice effects dominate the energy .",
    "it is also by the end of the roll - down that the number of created defects stabilizes .",
    "so we would conclude that results obtained from lattice simulations for baryon - antibaryon production during the chiral phase transition in a rapidly expanding chiral gas are not severely affected by lattice artifacts .",
    "on the other hand , to follow the evolutions beyond the end of the roll - down , which comprise small @xmath19 and @xmath50-oscillations of @xmath6 around the true vacuum , interfering with small oscillations of the bag profiles ( resonances ) , will require to subtract the lattice artifacts .",

    "so , this is not a dramatic result .",
    "the reason is , evidently , that in the expanding bjorken frame the gradient coupling in rapidity direction quickly gets suppressed .",
    "it should be noted that all numerically measured exponents are independent of the choice of the lattice constants , because scaling @xmath274 , ( i.e.@xmath275 ) , @xmath276 , @xmath277 leaves the eom ( [ eom ] ) invariant .",

    "are slowed down , the roll - down times may be retarded by an order of magnitude , but the overall reduction factor in the number of surviving defects remains unaffected .",
    "of course , all fluctuations then are damped away during the course of the evolution , and the integrals ( [ int3 ] ) to ( [ int5 ] ) finally are determined by the remaining ensemble of squeezed solitons alone , while the kinetic energy goes to zero .      for times",

    "we adopt the considerations which led to the estimate ( [ ef ] ) .",
    "counting again all mesons as zero momentum pions we have [ npi ] n_= = c_0v_0 = f_^2(ab n ) . the rapidity density of negatively charged pions @xmath348 then is [ piminus ] = f_^2 . in a heavy - ion collision",
    "the transverse area @xmath98 of the bjorken rod will correspond to the spatial overlap of the colliding relativistic nuclear slabs . as we have assumed spatially homogeneous initial conditions we have to consider slabs with constant nucleon ( area-)density . in order to account for the number a of nucleons contained in one slab , its radius must be taken as @xmath349a@xmath350 , with @xmath351 fm . then , as function of centrality , @xmath352 is directly proportional to the number of participants @xmath353 , which is one of the basic experimental results in relativistic heavy - ion collisions . for central collisions of a - nucleon slabs we have @xmath354a , so we find for the @xmath2-rapidity density per @xmath355 participants [ ppp ] = ( r_0 f_)^2 .",
    "this is an interesting result because all parameters have been absorbed into physical quantities .",
    "there are , however , several caveats : we have used for this result the form of the potential ( [ pot ] ) _ after _ the quench ( only this enters into the calculations ) .",
    "this means that differences between the average potential energy _ before _",
    "the quench ( [ uth0 ] ) and immediately _ after _ the quench ( [ uth ] ) are left out . however ,",
    "this difference is of the order @xmath130 , which has been neglected in ( [ ppp ] ) anyway . but",
    "generally , the result ( [ ppp ] ) should be considered as a lower limit .",
    "it should further be noted that the result ( [ ppp ] ) depends linearly on the time @xmath223 for the onset of the roll - down .",
    "the definition of @xmath223 in ( [ onset ] ) is not very stringent and may be subject to changes by @xmath356 .",
    "the estimate ( cf .",
    "eq.([onset ] ) ) we used for the time @xmath223 required @xmath357 , i.e. with @xmath358 @xmath359 , the initial time @xmath12 should not exceed @xmath360 fm .",
    "another unsatisfactory feature of the homogeneous bjorken rod is that the inhomogeneity in the nucleon ( area-)density of real relativistic nuclear slabs with transverse radii @xmath349a@xmath361 has to be represented through radii @xmath349a@xmath350 for homogeneous slabs .",
    "the experimental value @xcite for the @xmath2-rapidity density per @xmath355 lies between 1.2 and 1.5 for @xmath353 increasing up to 350 . with @xmath362 , @xmath363",
    ", our result ( [ ppp ] ) leads to [ pipp ] 0.75 - 1.2  . in the light of the reservations discussed above ,",
    "this is quite satisfactory .",
    "in contrast to the parameter - free pion multiplicities , the result for baryon - antibaryon creation depends on two parameters : the time @xmath12 when the initial hadronic field ensemble is established and begins its expansion , and the initial coherence length @xmath148 within that ensemble . from ( [ pbar ] ) and ( [ piminus ] ) we have ( with @xmath343 to 0.25 ) [ ratio ] 0.15 ( ) .",
    "the experimental value for the ratio of integrated @xmath1 to @xmath2 multiplicities lies between 0.065 and 0.085 @xcite for varying numbers of participants . with @xmath364 fm , and a typical @xmath19-mass of @xmath365 3 @xmath359 ,",
    "the experimentally observed multiplicity ratios are reproduced if @xmath148 and @xmath12 ( both in [ fm ] ) satisfy [ rule ] r_0 ( 3 _ 0)^+1/3 . for initial times in the range 0.2 @xmath366 0.5 the dependence on @xmath347 is very weak and the coherence length varies in the range 0.7 @xmath367 1.2 ( all in [ fm ] ) .",
    "these values are certainly within the limits of conventional assumptions .",
    "interpreted in terms of a thermodynamic equilibrium ensemble , @xmath368 implies the standard estimate @xmath369 mev for the chiral phase transition . with our choice @xmath370 for the ratio of the spatial and rapidity lattice constants , the initial time @xmath371 fm resulting from ( [ rule ] ) for @xmath372 fm",
    "then means that in the initial ensemble the initial rapidity coherence distance @xmath326 extends over three units of rapidity .",
    "we have presented numerical simulations of the dynamical evolution which chiral field configurations undergo in a rapidly expanding spatial volume . starting at an initial time @xmath12 from a random hadronic field ensemble with restored chiral symmetry ,",
    "we follow its ordering process and roll - down into the global potential minimum with spontaneously broken chiral symmetry . in accordance with standard concepts of heavy - ion physics",
    "we have considered one - dimensional longitudinal expansion of an essentially baryon - free region of high energy density , as it may be realized in the aftermath of an ultra - relativistic collision of heavy ions for central rapidities .    performed on a space - rapidity lattice in proper time of comoving frames ,",
    "such simulations are very powerful instruments which allow to investigate a multitude of interesting features related to the chiral phase transition .",
    "we have concentrated here on the topological aspects which are directly related to baryon - antibaryon multiplicity as a sensitive signal for the phase transition .",
    "mesonic abundancies could be analysed as well , both for @xmath50 and @xmath19 mesons ( or any other elementary fluctuations included in the chiral field ) .",
    "not only their spectra can be obtained , but from the instantaneous configurations the spectral power of their momentum distribution could be extracted at every point in time .",
    "the method is not restricted to thermally equilibrated initial ensembles with global or local temperature ; inhomogenities and anisotropy in the correlation lengths could be implemented naturally .",
    "surface effects could be investigated by suitable boundary conditions",
    ". this may be interesting with respect to the @xmath373-dependence of spectra and multiplicities .",
    "here we have applied only standard periodic conditions .",
    "the one - dimensional expansion could be replaced by anisotropic or spherically symmetric expansion , which may be of specific interest in cosmological applications .",
    "we have used the sudden quench approximation , which could be replaced by any desired time - dependence of the chiral potential with arbitrary quench times .",
    "we have selected ensembles with conserved net - baryon number @xmath319 or very small @xmath374 .",
    "any other choice would be possible , and it appears as a peculiarly attractive feature to study evolutions in ensembles with high net - baryon density , either fixed or in the form of grandcanonical ensembles .",
    "the method is well suited to analyse distribution , growth and realigning of domains with disoriented chiral condensate as has been shown previously in purely dissipative dynamics  @xcite .",
    "the generalization to su(3)-fields appears most interesting , to learn about strangeness production in terms of baryonic and kaonic abundance ratios .",
    "evidently , the method opens up a wide field of applications .",
    "unfortunately , however , we know very little about the nature and characteristics of the initial ensemble which enters crucially into all physical results .",
    "so , in our present analysis of antibaryon and pion multiplicities , the experimental data do not allow to draw definite conclusions about the validity of the topological approach , because the results depend on two initial coherence lengths , the spatial @xmath148 and rapidity @xmath326 , ( which for an isotropic initial ensemble are related by @xmath375 ) .",
    "we can only conclude that conventional assumptions about these quantities lead to results which are compatible with experimentally detected multiplicities .",
    "so , luckily , the mechanism is not ruled out . on the other hand ,",
    "an assumption like @xmath376 ( which would imply that the correlations have grown with the speed of light from a pointlike origin ) is ruled out : it would overestimate the abundance ratio in ( [ ratio ] ) by a factor of 5 .",
