    "<S> we investigate the behaviour of exact closed bouncing friedmann universes in theories with varying constants . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the simplest bsbm varying - alpha theory leads to a bouncing universe . </S>",
    "<S> the value of alpha increases monotonically , remaining approximately constant during most of each cycle , but increasing significantly around each bounce . </S>",
    "<S> when dissipation is introduced we show that in each new cycle the universe expands for longer and to a larger size . </S>",
    "<S> we find a similar effect for closed bouncing universes in brans - dicke theory , where @xmath0 also varies monotonically in time from cycle to cycle . </S>",
    "<S> similar behaviour occurs also in varying speed of light theories .    </S>",
    "<S> the `` bouncing universe ''  is a modern cosmological reincarnation of an ancient fascination with the cyclic patterns of nature and the myth of the `` eternal return '' @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> gravitation theories like general relativity allow us to make precise models of this popular conception of a phoenix  cosmology , in which a universe periodically collapses to a big crunch , only to rebound into a new state of expansion , as if emerging from a unique big bang @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> multiple bounces are possible but each cycle lasts longer and expands to a larger maximum size than the previous one , a consequence of a simple application of the second law of thermodynamics  @xcite , unless there is a finite positive cosmological constant , in which case the oscillations must eventually cease @xcite and are replaced by eternal de sitter expansion . </S>",
    "<S> a sequence of many oscillations will drive the bouncing closed universe closer and closer to flatness .    </S>",
    "<S> quantum gravity  effects are invariably invoked to justify the bounce ; possible detailed calculations , however , have only recently emerged . in loop quantum gravity , </S>",
    "<S> the semi - classical friedmann equations receive corrections that produce a bounce  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ekpyrotic model of the universe , inspired by string / m - theory , is another possible realization of phoenix cosmology  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is also possible that ghost fields  fields endowed with negative energy  are capable of producing a _ classical _ bounce ( this idea has been often rediscovered ; see  @xcite for a good review ) . </S>",
    "<S> classical bounces produced by conventional scalar fields with potentials which only violate the strong energy condition are difficult to produce in universes that grow large enough to be realistic : typically the probability of bounce is of order the ratio of the minimum to the maximum expansion size @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it has been speculated that whatever causes a collapsing universe to bounce can reprocesses some aspects of physics , either randomly @xcite , or systematically @xcite , by changing the particle spectrum or resetting the dimensionless constants  of nature . </S>",
    "<S> both of these options are severely constrained by anthropic requirements but it is interesting to ask whether there are monotonic or asymptotic trends in the values of some quantities , as seems to be the case for the degree of flatness of the universe , over many bounces . </S>",
    "<S> this matter is clearly of great importance in the context of varying - constant theories  @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> , quantities which are traditionally constants become space - time variables and if  singularities are avoided in the bounce then their evolution from cycle to cycle is predictable by the field equations rather than the outcome of effectively random reprocessing . </S>",
    "<S> the values of any dimensionless constants of nature could evolve towards asymptotic attractors if they are allowed to be variables in a self - consistent theory . </S>",
    "<S> studies of these theories are also important in assessing the stability and level of fluctuations in a bouncing universe . it has been suggested that thermal fluctuations in bouncing models could be the origin of the cosmic structure  @xcite ; this would provide a distinct alternative to an origin from vacuum quantum fluctuations in a de sitter phase of cosmological expansion .    </S>",
    "<S> although these claims are intriguing , it is difficult to evaluate them in the absence of a concrete model for the bounce , which is usually viewed as a black box  from which anything can emerge @xcite . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we examine some exactly soluble examples . </S>",
    "<S> first , we consider a simple bouncing cosmology following from the simplest bsbm varying - constant theory  we developed @xcite from bekenstein s varying - alpha model  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the result that for suitable couplings ( indeed those favoured by observations  @xcite ; see however  @xcite ) the theory leads to a bouncing universe . </S>",
    "<S> we derive similar behaviour in the brans - dicke theory of a varying gravitational constant @xmath0  @xcite , and in a class of varying speed of light theories  @xcite . in each case </S>",
    "<S> we are able to find exact solutions in the absence of dissipation and compute the evolutionary trends in the fine structure constant and @xmath0 from cycle to cycle when dissipation occurs in accord with the second law . </S>",
    "<S> we find the interesting result that the varying constants in these theories change monotonically from cycle to cycle when the scale factor oscillates : the scalar fields determining the constants in each cycle do not oscillate .    </S>",
    "<S> crucial to our models is the idea that cosmological fields may have a negative energy . </S>",
    "<S> such fields are called ghosts  @xcite , and are far from new , having found widespread application in the study of steady - state cosmology  @xcite , phantom dark matter  @xcite , and @xmath1-essence  @xcite . bekenstein s theory  @xcite is rooted in the use of a real scalar dielectric field @xmath2 , representing the allowed variation of the electron charge according to @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the present - day value of the electron charge , and so the fine structure constant evolves with respect to its present - day value , @xmath5 as @xmath6 . by redefining the electromagnetic gauge field  @xcite , @xmath7 , as @xmath8 , and the electromagnetic field tensor , @xmath9 , as @xmath10 , the action may be written as @xmath11where @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 does not depend on @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the gravitational lagrangian is the usual @xmath15 , with @xmath16 being the curvature scalar . if the scalar coupling satisfies @xmath17 , then @xmath2 has a negative kinetic energy term , and is thus a ghost field </S>",
    "<S> .    this theory can fit the observational constraints on varying alpha reported by  @xcite as well as others  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however for this to be possible in the ghost - free case with @xmath18 one has to choose a very special type of dark matter , in which the magnetostatic energy @xmath19 dominates over the electrostatic energy @xmath20 . even though a dark - matter candidate was found satisfying this condition ( superconducting cosmic strings ) , most types of matter , including baryonic matter , are @xmath20 dominated , for which observational data implies @xmath17 , so that @xmath2 is a ghost field .    </S>",
    "<S> ghosts have been criticized on a variety of grounds . </S>",
    "<S> classically they are a source of instabilities if coupled to other forms of matter , since they will try to off - load an infinite amount of positive energy into them . </S>",
    "<S> this is not necessarily cataclysmic if the rate of these processes is sufficiently slow . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , in steady - state cosmology to negative probabilities . at the quantum level , ghosts lead to negative norm states and so negative probabilities . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum instabilities are also much more severe and are present even without direct coupling to matter , for example in runaway particle production via the graviton vertex . </S>",
    "<S> hence , at the quantum level ghosts _ are _ pathological .    however , we know that quantisation of the field @xmath2 is pathological even for @xmath18 . for one thing , the theory is non - renormalisable . </S>",
    "<S> the attitude to @xmath2 should therefore be similar to that with regards to gravity : do nt quantise . </S>",
    "<S> general relativity is also , at face value , non - renormalisable : for instance , the quantum corrections to the relativistic precession of the perihelion of mercury are infinite . </S>",
    "<S> this does nt stop the classical theory from being very successful . </S>",
    "<S> it may be that the quantisation of ghosts is simply more subtle ; ghosts have been found as type @xmath21 string theories  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> non - relativistic matter and the cosmological constant may be neglected near a bounce , so let us consider a friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe filled with radiation and a dielectric field , @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the cosmological equations for bsbm varying-@xmath22 theory ( [ sbsm ] ) are @xmath23where we have set @xmath24 , @xmath25  is the hubble expansion rate , @xmath26 is the 3-curvature constant , and @xmath27 . for the scalar field , in the absence of non - relativistic matter , we have @xmath28so @xmath29 we should not ignore the possibility that at high curvatures quantum processes may allow the conversion of @xmath2 energy into radiation . </S>",
    "<S> we take this into account by introducing variable @xmath30 and rewriting the conservation equations as : @xmath31 in this case , the equation of motion for @xmath2 will contain an additional @xmath32 term which models energy transfer between the @xmath2 field and the radiation sea in accord with the second law of thermodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we shall consider the implications of such a process , in all its generality , below , but let us look first at the equations neglecting this coupling function .    </S>",
    "<S> consider first a model @xmath33 bouncing universe which is exactly soluble . </S>",
    "<S> taking @xmath34 and @xmath35 eqn . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fried1 ] ) is @xmath36where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are positive constants . in terms of conformal time @xmath39 , </S>",
    "<S> this can be integrated to give @xmath40    \\label{eta}\\]]when @xmath41 . identifying the expansion </S>",
    "<S> maximum and minimum , we see that @xmath42 is given by @xmath43 ,   \\label{sol2}\\]]where @xmath44 is global expansion maximum and @xmath45 is the global minimum of @xmath42 , defined by    @xmath46    since @xmath47 we have , for @xmath17 , that @xmath48 and the scalar field driving time - variation of the fine structure constant is given by    @xmath49 in fig .  [ fig1 ] we plot these solutions and show @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( recall that @xmath52 ) , as functions of _ proper _ time , @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> we note the steady increase of @xmath22 with time despite the oscillatory behaviour of the expansion scale factor .    </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath33 we have a variety of oscillating solutions whose characteristics depend on the initial conditions . for bouncing solutions </S>",
    "<S> @xmath22 remains nearly constant during each cycle but changes sharply , but still monotonically , at the bounce . </S>",
    "<S> there is no significant change of behaviour at the expansion maximum which also implies that there should be no gross difference in evolution inside and outside spherical overdensities far from the bounce . with @xmath54 , and setting @xmath55 and @xmath56 , we have @xmath57 and @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> we can then see that the bounce duration is @xmath59 . since @xmath60 near the bounce , we find that @xmath61 , independently of initial conditions , during each bounce .    </S>",
    "<S> the extreme case is a stable static universe . setting @xmath62 and @xmath63 </S>",
    "<S> , we can see that this case is realized when @xmath64 , giving @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> for such a universe @xmath2 evolves linearly in @xmath53 , and since we have @xmath52 there is exponentially rapid increase @xcite . even though such a universe is static , the rulers and clocks of observers change as alpha changes , so that they actually observe a milne universe . </S>",
    "<S> we can see that the solution is stable because homogeneous and isotropic perturbations lead to a universe with regular sinusoidal oscillations as can be seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> fig1 . </S>",
    "<S> such solutions are described by ( [ sol2 ] ) in the case where @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> this situation differs from that found in general relativity in the absence of ghost fields @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath32 is a non - vanishing then , regardless of its exact functional form , there are two type of solutions . if @xmath67 at all times , then sooner or later the universe enters a steady - state evolution with exponential expansion and constant overall energy density ensured by the appropriate transfer of energy between the @xmath2 field and radiation </S>",
    "<S> however , we expect that these energy - transport processes will switch off at low curvatures , when the universe expands to a sufficiently large size ( @xmath68 ) and transport processes become collisionless and far slower than the expansion rate . </S>",
    "<S> then , the typical evolution is as plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> again , @xmath2 is approximately constant during each cycle and changes dramatically at the bounce . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , each cycle is now bigger than the previous one , because @xmath38 increases at each bounce . </S>",
    "<S> this is an interesting realisation of the standard tolman scenario . </S>",
    "<S> cycles get bigger ( and entropy is generated near the bounce ) specifically because radiation is produced from the scalar field close to each bounce . in producing fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] we have used @xmath69 ( @xmath2 decays into radiation ) , but other functional forms may be used with similar effects .    we now examine similar solutions for the brans - dicke ( bd ) theory of varying @xmath0  @xcite . in the einstein frame , _ if the matter content is pure radiation _ , we recover the same equations . </S>",
    "<S> all we need to do , then , is convert the above results into the jordan frame : the results found for @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath2 should then be translated into variables @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 ( the latter corresponding roughly to @xmath75 ) . under this transformation </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath76 , where @xmath77 in the brand - dicke coupling parameter . </S>",
    "<S> thus we need @xmath78 for the brans - dicke field to behave like a proper ghost in the einstein frame . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting dynamics is plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> these results may be understood analytically . </S>",
    "<S> the essential bd field equations in the jordan frame are @xmath79where overdots now refer to derivatives with respect to @xmath80 and @xmath81 . hence @xmath82with @xmath83 and @xmath84 constants . </S>",
    "<S> we are interested in negative @xmath85 solutions with @xmath86 , which give oscillating closed universes ( note that @xmath87 is not sufficient for an expansion minimum , we need @xmath88 ) . following the techniques of @xcite we put @xmath89 and in the bouncing case @xmath90 , we have simple exact solution in terms of conformal jordan time : @xmath91we see the same behaviour as displayed by the radiation - scalar universe given above with @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> the minimum value of @xmath92 is @xmath93 and the maximum is @xmath94 so in conformal time @xmath95 undergoes oscillations of increasing amplitude as the entropy increases ( ie if @xmath96 increases in value to model increasing radiation density ) ; that is , the horizon area ( entropy ) in planck units increases from cycle to cycle . </S>",
    "<S> the full solution for @xmath42 and @xmath97 is then obtained using eqns . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ phi ] ) and ( [ y ] ) : @xmath98 \\right ] , \\label{phisol}\\]]with @xmath99 constant and @xmath100 \\times    \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\exp \\left [ -\\frac{2a}{\\sqrt{c}}\\arctan \\left [ \\frac{\\lambda \\tan </S>",
    "<S> \\{\\eta + \\eta _ { 0}\\}+\\sqrt{\\lambda ^{2}-c}}{\\sqrt{c}}\\right ] \\right ] .   \\label{a}\\end{aligned}\\]]the effect of increasing radiation entropy can be seen by increasing the constant @xmath96 in these expressions . in this model </S>",
    "<S> the field @xmath101 and radiation are fully decoupled . </S>",
    "<S> although the size of the universe increases in each successive cycle , its size with respect to planck units remains the same , unless of course we consider a model in which the field @xmath101 and radiation may exchange energy .    </S>",
    "<S> we found similar solutions in the bsbm and bd theories because the dynamics in the einstein frame is very similar in the absence of non - relativistic matter . </S>",
    "<S> likewise , one can find identical solutions for the covariant varying speed of light ( vsl ) theories described in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this does not imply that the vsl , brans - dicke and bsbm theories are equivalent ; merely that one needs to add more general matter ( even if only as test matter  in a radiation - dominated universe ) for their differences to become obvious . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , the coupling to @xmath102 in ( [ sbsm ] ) is replaced in brans - dicke theory by non - minimally coupling the matter fields to the metric .    </S>",
    "<S> in summary , we have considered some simple exactly soluble models for closed bouncing universes in theories with varying @xmath22 and varying @xmath0 and examined the effects of simple non - equilibrium behaviour . even though the expansion scale factor of the universes undergoes periodic oscillations about a finite non - singular expansion minimum </S>",
    "<S> , we find steady monotonic change in the values of @xmath22 and @xmath0 from cycle to cycle both in the presence and absence of non - equilibrium behaviour . in the non - equilibrium case the oscillations of the expansion scale factor grow monotonically in amplitude and period in accord with the second law , and the expansion dynamics approaches flatness .    </S>",
