    "we study magnetic fields of the quiet sun .",
    "our analysis will exclude the magnetism in photospheric network regions known to contain strong kg magnetic fields ( e.g. , @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "we will concentrate on the low flux features in the interior of the network which we will call , for brevity , in fields ( inter - network fields ) .",
    "magnetic fields within the network cells were already discovered in the seventies ( @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) . during the last decade , with improved observational and diagnostic capabilities , these in fields have obtained increasing attention . they will allow to test our ideas on the magnetic field generation by convective processes , a natural step towards understanding the principles of astrophysical dynamos ( e.g. @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , it has been found that the very quiet in areas harbor a sizeable fraction of the solar magnetic flux ( see , e.g. , @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "such estimates are based on lower limits to the still unknown amount of flux , which suggests the potential importance of the in component of the solar magnetism .",
    "so far only a fraction of the in field has been detected .",
    "this conclusion follows from the presence of unresolved mixed polarities in 1  angular resolution observations ( e.g. , @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "the mixing of polarities reduces the polarization , making the magnetic structures difficult to identify .",
    "consequently , it is to be expected finding more sites with magnetic fields when increasing the spatial resolution .",
    "this idea triggered our investigation : we aimed at observing the in fields with the highest possible spatial resolution yet keeping a good polarimetric sensitivity .",
    "many of the recent observational studies find that the in fields have magnetic field strengths substantially lower than 1  kg ( @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "yet , on the basis of different observing and interpretation techniques , one can find in in areas strong kg magnetic fields ( @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "this seeming discrepancy probably points out that the in regions present a continuous distribution of field strengths .",
    "depending on the specificities of the diagnostic technique , one selects only a particular part of such distribution ( see @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) .    in this study",
    "we confirm the presence of kg in magnetic fields .",
    "in addition , we detect an amount of unsigned magnetic flux which exceeded any value previously reported in the literature .",
    "our conclusions are based on spectro - polarimetric observations achieving both high spatial resolution ( 05 ) and fair sensitivity ( 20 g ) . in this letter",
    "we give a short description of the observations and the data analysis .",
    "our aim is to communicate the results bearing on strong in fields and large flux densities .",
    "a detailed discussion , including additional properties on the time evolution , will be given in a forthcoming more extended contribution .",
    "the observations were obtained in april 2002 with the _ gttingen _ fabry - perot interferometer ( fpi ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) mounted at the vacuum tower telescope of the observatorio del teide ( tenerife ) .",
    "the seeing was excellent ( fried parameter @xmath2=1314 cm ) .",
    "a very quiet region near disk center was selected using g band video images to avoid network regions .",
    "the observational setup is described in @xcite ( @xcite ) , which includes a stokes @xmath3 polarimeter .",
    "while scanning across a spectral region , the spectrometer takes two - dimensional narrow - band images with short exposure times and , strictly simultaneously , broadband images from the same field of view ( fov ) .",
    "the data for the present study stem from a 17mininutes time series of spectral scans in the 6302  region , containing the fe  i  @xmath06301.5    line ( land factor @xmath4 ) , the fe  i  @xmath06302.5    line ( @xmath5 ) , and the telluric o@xmath6 6302.76  line .",
    "the fwhm of the fpi and the sampling interval were 44m  and 32m , respectively .",
    "each fpi scan consists of 28 wavelength positions for the two iron lines , and 5 wavelength positions for the telluric line .",
    "the duration of a spectral scan is 35s , plus 15s needed for storage onto hard disk .",
    "the fov corresponds to 15@xmath725on the sun , sampled with a pixel size of 01@xmath701 .",
    "the data reduction includes subtraction of dark current , flat fielding , and speckle reconstruction of the broadband images ( @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) using the spectral ratio method ( @xcite @xcite ) and the speckle masking method ( @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "the reconstruction of the narrow - band images proceeds the way proposed by @xcite ( @xcite ; see also @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "we use the code by @xcite ( @xcite ) with minor modifications . to have the noise filtering independent of the seeing , which may vary during a spectral scan",
    ", we apply a filter which limits the spatial resolution of the reconstructed spectro - polarimetric images to 05 . to further suppress noise ,",
    "the images were processed with a 5@xmath75 pixel boxcar smoothing after the filtering .",
    "the fpi simultaneously collects the left and right circularly polarized beams onto different areas of the ccd .",
    "they are added and subtracted to obtain the stokes @xmath8 and @xmath3 profiles .",
    "this task demands a careful superposition of the two beams , which we carry out after a sub - pixel interpolation .",
    "the spatial filters were not applied to the broad - band images .",
    "magnetic flux densities are computed starting from the magnetograph equation , which relates the circular polarization @xmath3 and the longitudinal component of the magnetic field @xmath9 ( e.g. , @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) , @xmath10 with the calibration constant @xmath11 proportional to @xmath12 .",
    "first , the derivative of stokes @xmath8 required to evaluate @xmath11 is computed numerically for each iron line .",
    "then , the wavelengths of the two extrema of the derivative , plus the two wavelengths immediately adjacent to each one of them , are selected .",
    "the flux density of each solar point , @xmath13 , is obtained solving equation ( [ eeqmag ] ) for these six wavelengths @xmath14 .",
    "the least - squares fit renders @xmath15 obviously , if the observed stokes @xmath8 and @xmath3 profiles satisfy equation ( [ eeqmag ] ) then @xmath16 . in general",
    "this is not the case and @xmath13 represents a mere biased estimate of the true flux density .",
    "two main sources of noise limit the precision of @xmath13 .",
    "the measure is affected by the random noise of the stokes @xmath3 spectra .",
    "we estimate its influence applying to equation ( [ llest ] ) the law of propagation of errors ( e.g. , @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "assuming the stokes @xmath3 noise to be constant and equal to @xmath17 ( @xmath18 being the continuum intensity ) , the typical value for the random error of @xmath13 turns out to be 20 g ( table [ table ] ; 1  g  @xmath19  1  mx  @xmath1 ) .",
    "the adopted @xmath3-noise comes from the r.m.s .",
    "fluctuations of the stokes @xmath3 profiles when @xmath20 .",
    "a second source of error affecting @xmath13 is due to the contamination of the polarization signals with intensity ( the so - called @xmath8-to-@xmath3 crosstalk ) .",
    "it can be created in many ways during the reduction procedure ( e.g. , errors in setting the continuum intensity level ) . since @xmath21 , a small crosstalk compromises the polarimetric accuracy of the measurements .",
    "fortunately , the procedure that we employ to determine @xmath13 is insensitive to this contamination .",
    "the calibration constant @xmath11 has different signs in the two wings of the spectral lines , consequently , any symmetric contribution to @xmath3 ( e.g. , the contamination with stokes @xmath8 ) leaves only a small residual in equation ( [ llest ] ) . using quiet sun stokes @xmath8 profiles",
    ", we deduce a residual of at most a few g , which is regarded as negligible .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] presents two magnetograms taken simultaneously in the two iron lines .",
    "they exhibit a _ salt and pepper _ pattern .",
    "the close similarity of the two magnetograms demonstrates that we have found magnetic field signals above noise .",
    "we sought and found further evidences for the consistency of the magnetograms . among them ( a ) most of the patches have sizes of the resolution limit or larger , and ( b ) the patches maintain their identity between successive snapshots of the time sequence that we obtained .",
    "approximately 45% of the fov contains polarimetric signal .",
    "the mean unsigned magnetic field density averaged over the fov is 21  g , for the magnetogram based on fe  i  @xmath06301.5   , and 17 g for fe  i  @xmath06302.5    ( table [ table ] ) . in this average",
    "we set to zero all those pixels with @xmath13 below the noise level .",
    "the unsigned flux densities that we measure are larger than the values found hitherto ( e.g. , see the values compiled by @xcite @xcite ,  4.1 ) .",
    "we detect more signals probably due to the unique combination of high spatial resolution and good sensitivity of our observation .",
    "the magnetic flux detected in the in critically depends on the polarimetric sensitivity and the angular resolution .",
    "for example , if the magnetograms in figure [ fig1 ] had a sensitivity of 100  g , then the mean unsigned flux density drops to 1 - 2 g ( table [ table ] ; the new lower sensitivity is modeled setting to zero all the observed signals below 100 g )",
    ". the drastic decrease of signals with decreasing sensitivity can easily explain why the in signals that we detect have been missed in previous high resolution magnetograms ( @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "a decrease of angular resolution also reduces the signals due to cancellation between close opposite polarities .",
    "if the angular resolution of the observation is artificially degraded by convolving the magnetograms in figure [ fig1 ] with a 1  fwhm gaussian , then the mean unsigned flux densities become of the order of 7 - 9 g. these values agree with previous determinations based on scanning spectro - polarimeters that reach 1  resolution ( @xcite @xcite obtain 10 g , whereas @xcite @xcite gives 9 g ) .",
    "the mean _ signed _ magnetic flux density in figure [ fig1 ] is found to be + 3  g for fe  i  @xmath06302.5   , and + 2  g for fe  i  @xmath06301.5   .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the speckle reconstructed broad - band image and , overlaid to it , the fe  i  @xmath06302.5    magnetogram .",
    "it is important to note that most of the magnetic fields , @xmath22% , are located in intergranular spaces .",
    "this was observed before ( @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) and is expected from numerical simulations of magneto - convection ( e.g. , @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "our high spatial resolution observations leave no doubt on these results .",
    "however , magnetic fields can also be found in granules ( @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "patches of opposite polarity are often located close to each other , again in agreement with expectations from numerical simulations .",
    "the polarization signals obtained from the two spectral lines are correlated ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "however , the magnitude of the effective flux density of fe  i  @xmath06301.5   , @xmath23 , is systematically larger than the effective field derived using fe  i  @xmath06302.5   , @xmath24 .",
    "we have estimated this excess by several means : least - squares fit of @xmath23 versus @xmath24 , least - squares fit of @xmath24 versus @xmath23 , mean ratio among all points in the field of view , etc .",
    "our best estimate for this ratio is , @xmath25 where the error bar accounts for all the individual estimates .",
    "we interpret this systematic difference as an indication that the magnetic field strengths in the magnetograms are , typically , in the kg regime .",
    "for weak fields , say 500 g , the magnetograph equation ( [ eeqmag ] ) holds , since the basic conditions for the approximation to be valid are satisfied ( @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "thus , for weak fields one expects @xmath26 .",
    "since this is not the observed ratio , one is forced to conclude that the field strengths have to be in the kg range .",
    "we have modeled the ratio ( [ ratio0 ] ) using synthetic polarized spectra formed in atmospheres whose magnetic fields are known .",
    "such numerical calibration confirms the qualitative argument posed above , namely , that the ratio ( [ ratio0 ] ) corresponds to kg fields .",
    "note that structures with intrinsic kg magnetic field strength showing 20 g flux density have to occupy only a small fraction of the solar surface . the simplest estimate yields 2% of the area , which comes from fill factor @xmath27 g",
    ".    magnetic structures with kg fields should be bright at the granulation level because they have lower density and thus lower opacity than the ambient atmosphere ( @xcite @xcite ) . except for a few cases ( e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , upper left corner at [ 15 ,  22 ] ) , we do not see such brightening in the broadband images .",
    "this implies that the structures must thus be smaller than the resolution of these images , of approximately 025 or 180 km .",
    "we have demonstrated that polarimetric observations with high spatial resolution reveal a wealth of magnetic structures even in the very quiet sun , away from activity or network features .",
    "our study reveals a mean unsigned flux density of 20 g , which is at least a factor two larger than the flux found in previous studies having lower angular resolution .",
    "even more , it is almost twice the flux density detected during the solar maximum in the form of active regions and network using conventional techniques ( see @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "our analysis also leads to the conclusion that the in fields contain strong kg fields .",
    "since only some 2% of the solar surface produces these kg signals , we do not exclude the existence of weaker fields in the region ( of the order of tens of g , as found from hanle diagnostics , or hundreds of g , as deduced from fe i 15648    measurements ; see  [ intro ] ) .",
    "we find no evidence that the angular resolution and sensitivity of our magnetograms suffice to single out all the magnetic features existing in the in region .",
    "consequently , the flux that we detect should be regarded only as a lower limit .",
    "thanks are due to t. berger , h. socas - navarro and a. title for discussions on the work .",
    "thanks are also due to k. janen for letting us use her image reconstruction routines .",
