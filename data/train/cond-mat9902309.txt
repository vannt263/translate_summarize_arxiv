    "<S> * we analyze the nonlinear voltage dependence of elelctrochemical capacitance for nano - scale conductors . </S>",
    "<S> this voltage dependence is due to finite density of states of the conductors . </S>",
    "<S> we derive an exact expression for the electrochemical capacitance - voltage curve for a parallel plate system . </S>",
    "<S> the result suggests a _ quantum scanning capacitance microscopy _ at the nano - scale : by inverting the capacitance - voltage expression one is able to deduce the local spectral function of the nano - scale conductor . *    </S>",
    "<S> it has been well known that density of states affects the capacitance@xcite of a system . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we investigate a nonlinear bias voltage dependence of the electrochemical capacitance of a model capacitor at the nano - scale for which the density of states ( dos ) also plays the crucial role . </S>",
    "<S> the physical origin of this bias dependence which we have examined , is _ not _ because of depletion of charges on a capacitor plate which has been understood in semiconductor research , but because of the finite dos of the plates . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the accumulated charge on a conductor has a nonlinear bias dependence due to dos effects , it is this nonlinear charge which leads to the nonlinear capacitance . for conductors at nano - scale , </S>",
    "<S> it is known@xcite that the very small dos plays an important role for the behavior of capacitance . </S>",
    "<S> however the dos induced nonlinear capacitance of nano - conductors has never been studied@xcite before and our investigation suggests a very interesting application which is the quantum scanning capacitance microscopy .    </S>",
    "<S> central to the problem is the determination of charge @xmath0 accumulated on a conductor labeled by @xmath1 . in general @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> is a nonlinear function of bias voltages @xmath2 , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the usual electrochemical capacitance@xcite , @xmath5@xcite _ etc _ are the nonlinear electrochemical capacitance coefficients , and @xmath6 is the general voltage dependent nonlinear capacitance . </S>",
    "<S> so far investigations on quantum correction to capacitance@xcite have only considered the _ linear _ term , but in this work we focus on a general nonlinear expression for @xmath7 .    to be specific we consider a model parallel plate capacitor connected to electron reservoirs by perfect leads@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we adopt the dynamic point of view@xcite to calculate the electrochemical capacitance , hence a finite bias applied at the reservoirs injects a charge density into the capacitor plates which , through interaction , induces a local response . the total net charge ( the sum of injected and induced charge ) at a plate @xmath1 , @xmath0 , is thus established at equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate @xmath0 by extending the standard nonequilibrium green s function ( negf ) technique . to save space </S>",
    "<S> we refer interested readers to literature for standard technical details , here we will only discuss the most important extension to the standard approach .    </S>",
    "<S> the quantum scattering ( injection of electrons ) is determined by the retarded and advanced green s function @xmath8 : note that we have explicitly included the electro - static potential build - up inside our capacitor , @xmath9 , into these green s functions . in the hartree approximation@xcite , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the hamiltonian for our nano - scale conductors written in the familiar second quantized form@xcite , @xmath12 is the self - energy describing the coupling between the conductors to the leads which is calculated in standard fashion@xcite . at hartree level </S>",
    "<S> we determine @xmath13 by the self - consistent poisson equation @xmath14 where the right hand side is just the total net charge distribution in our conductors . within hartree approximation , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the voltage dependent coupling parameter between probe @xmath17 and the scattering region@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the self - consistent equations ( [ gr ] , [ poisson],[lesser ] ) completely determine the nonlinear physics at the hartree level . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize again that the important departure of our theory from the familiar negf analysis@xcite is that we explicitly include the _ internal _ potential landscape @xmath13 into the green s functions _ self - consistently_.    the net charge pile - up on a capacitor plate , measured from the equilibrium background , is derived from the right hand side of eq . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath19_{xx}\\ \\ , \\label{rho2}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 are the equilibrium green s functions . </S>",
    "<S> next , we formally expand @xmath21 and @xmath22 in a power series of the internal potential @xmath23 , and expand the fermi function in series of the bias voltage @xmath24 . collecting terms according to the powers of @xmath23 and @xmath24 , eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ rho2 ] ) reduces to the following infinite series which can be exactly summed , @xmath25_{xx } \\nonumber \\\\ & \\equiv & \\sigma_\\alpha(e+v_\\alpha - u ) -\\sigma_\\alpha(e ) \\label{eq18}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the quantity @xmath26 is defined as @xmath27_{xx}\\ \\ . \\label{dnde1}\\ ] ] the physical significance of the quantity @xmath26 can be identified as the linear spatial dependent local partial density of states@xcite ( lpdos ) . </S>",
    "<S> expression ( [ dnde1 ] ) has been obtained before@xcite . for a conductor </S>",
    "<S> which is weakly coupled to external leads , lpdos gives the local dos of this conductor . </S>",
    "<S> hence the spectral function @xmath28 characterizes the local electronic structure of a nano - scale conductor .    </S>",
    "<S> the nonlinear charge distribution gives the general electrochemical capacitance versus voltage curve , @xmath29/(v_1-v_2 ) \\label{cv}\\ ] ] where we have set electron charge @xmath30 to be unity . to determine c we must obtain internal potentials @xmath31 and @xmath32 at the two plates </S>",

    "<S> capacitance@xcite @xmath33 @xmath34/(u_1-u_2 ) \\label{u1}\\ ] ] and @xmath35/(u_1-u_2 ) \\label{u2}\\ ] ] for a parallel plate capacitor , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the area of the plates and @xmath38 is their separation . in general @xmath33 </S>",
    "<S> can be calculated numerically . </S>",
    "<S> the two equations ( [ u1],[u2 ] ) determine the internal potentials @xmath31 and @xmath32 when the scattering spectral function @xmath39 and @xmath33 are known . </S>",
    "<S> eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ cv ] , [ u1 ] , [ u2 ] ) gives , for the first time , the general electrochemical c - v curve for quantum capacitors . </S>",
    "<S> it is universal in the sense that system specific parameters only appear in the scattering spectral functions of the conductors . from these general results , </S>",
    "<S> two useful applications follow :    . </S>",
    "<S> our general results allow us to predict capacitance - voltage curves . </S>",
    "<S> for this application we note that there are well established methods for calculating the scattering lpdos@xcite : either by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dnde1 ] ) after evaluating the green s functions , or using the scattering wavefunctions@xcite @xmath40 @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the velocity and @xmath43 the planck constant . </S>",
    "<S> hence by solving a quantum scattering problem one obtains @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> let s consider a case where @xmath40 is not very sensitive to @xmath44 , thus @xmath45 or @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a constant . </S>",
    "<S> for this lpdos , solving eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ cv ] , [ u1 ] , [ u2 ] ) we obtain @xmath48 where @xmath49 the inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) shows this electrochemical c - v curve as a function of @xmath50 for two sets of parameters @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> the physical reason that @xmath51 changes with @xmath52 is because the plates have finite dos . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , by making dos very large ( @xmath53 ) the voltage dependence of ( [ cv1 ] ) disappears and @xmath51 becomes purely geometrical . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it can be confirmed that formula ( [ cv1 ] ) recovers the linear@xcite and second order nonlinear@xcite capacitance coefficients when we take the @xmath54 limit .    . </S>",
    "<S> our general results suggest a quantum capacitance microscopy ( qscm ) . </S>",
    "<S> this idea naturally follows from the results presented above : since the electrochemical capacitance varies with bias due to a finite dos of the conductors involved , we should be able to find the dos by measuring @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> essentially we wish to obtain spectral function @xmath55 or local density of states @xmath56 as a function of energy for an unknown conductor , from a known @xmath57 of our qscm `` tip '' which has been calibrated@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as the qscm tip is scanned along the surface of a nano - scale conductor , or along the surface of a planar dielectric layer with nano - conductors buried underneath , experimentally one can measure the @xmath58 curves at each spatial position .    from eq.([cv ] ) , we obtain @xmath31 as a function of potential difference @xmath52 using the known @xmath59 and the measured @xmath58 , by solving the equation @xmath60 , where we have set @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 is set at the fermi energy of the qscm `` tip '' ( @xmath58 is measured at fermi energy of the `` tip '' @xmath64 , _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _ eq . ( [ cv1 ] ) ) </S>",
    "<S> next , from eq.([u1 ] ) we obtain @xmath65 . with @xmath31 and @xmath32 </S>",
    "<S> we finally find @xmath55 from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ u2 ] ) . in particular we can solve the spectral function @xmath66 by representing it into a polynomial : @xmath67 where the coefficients @xmath68 are just the linear ( @xmath69 ) lpdos and nonlinear ( @xmath70 ) lpdos@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they are obtained by solving the following set of linear algebraic equations which come from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ u2 ] ) , @xmath71 \\label{yi}\\ ] ] where @xmath72 . hence by making experimental measurements at @xmath73 different voltages @xmath74 </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain the functional form of @xmath55 from ( [ sigma2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) demonstrates the principle of qscm . </S>",
    "<S> we use eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ cv1 ] ) as the experimentally measured c - v curve ( the inset ) to simulate a measurement . then using the qscm `` measured '' @xmath55 from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sigma2 ] ) , we plot the local density of states @xmath56 versus energy @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> the solid line is the exact @xmath75 and the dots are the qscm result . </S>",
    "<S> we used 10 voltages in solving eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ yi ] ) and the outcome is quite good , while using 3 voltages it already represents a rough trend .    in summary , we have developed a general nonlinear dc theory which is applied to investigate , for the first time , the full nonlinear charge distribution in nano - scale conductors . </S>",
    "<S> we have derived an exact expression of the electrochemical capacitance versus external bias voltage curve for quantum capacitors . </S>",
    "<S> this result is generic in the sense that all system specific information are included in the scattering local density of states . </S>",
    "<S> hence the c - v formula has a wide range of applicability . by inverting this formula </S>",
    "<S> , we propose a novel qscm . </S>",
    "<S> the qscm extends the ability of the usual scanning capacitance microscopy@xcite : qscm includes the quantum corrections to capacitance in mapping out the the spatial charge distribution ; and it gives the local density of states as a function of electron energy . </S>",
    "<S> we believe such an idea can be readily implemented in a scanning apparatus using tiny tips as the calibrated conductor , thus allowing measurements of electronic properties for other conductors at the nano - scale .    </S>",
