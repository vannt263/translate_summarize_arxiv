    "<S> the determination of the normal and transverse ( frictional ) inter - particle forces within a granular medium is a long standing , daunting , and yet unresolved problem . </S>",
    "<S> we present a new formalism which employs the knowledge of the external forces and the orientations of contacts between particles ( of any given sizes ) , to compute all the inter - particle forces . having solved this problem </S>",
    "<S> we exemplify the efficacy of the formalism showing that the force chains in such systems are determined by an expansion in the eigenfunctions of a newly defined operator .    in a highly influential paper from 2005 </S>",
    "<S> majmudar and behringer @xcite wrote :  </S>",
    "<S> inter - particle forces in granular media form an inhomogeneous distribution of filamentary force chains . </S>",
    "<S> understanding such forces and their spatial correlations , specifically in response to forces at the system boundaries , represents a fundamental goal of granular mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> the problem is of relevance to civil engineering , geophysics and physics , being important for the understanding of jamming , shear - induced yielding and mechanical response . \" </S>",
    "<S> a visual example of such force chains in a system of plastic disks is provided in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ mahesh ] . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we present a solution of this goal .    </S>",
    "<S> to be precise , the problem that we solve is the following : consider a granular medium with known sizes of the granules , for example the 2-dimensional systems analyzed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and shown in fig .  [ mahesh ] , of @xmath0 disks of known diameters @xmath1 . given the external forces , denoted below as @xmath2 and the external torques @xmath3 exerted on the granules , and given the angular orientations of the vectors connecting the center of masses of contacting granules ( but not the distance between them ! ) , determine all the inter - particle normal and tangential forces @xmath4 and @xmath5 . the method presented below applies to granular systems in mechanical equilibrium ; the issue of instabilities and abrupt changes in the force chains will be discussed elsewhere . for the sake of clarity and simplicity we will present here the two - dimensional case ; the savvy reader will recognize that the formalism and the solution presented will go smoothly also for the three - dimensional case ( as long as the system is in mechanical equilibrium ) . </S>",
    "<S> the full formalism will be presented in a longer publication in due course .    </S>",
    "<S> the obvious conditions for mechanical equilibrium are that the forces and the torques on each particle have to sum up to zero @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the condition of force balance is usefully presented in matrix form using the following notation . </S>",
    "<S> denote the ( signed ) amplitudes of the inter - particle forces @xmath6 as a vector @xmath7 , where the amplitudes @xmath8 appear first and then the amplitudes @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the vector of @xmath10 and @xmath11 components @xmath12 and @xmath13 is denoted as @xmath14 where all the @xmath10 components are presented in @xmath14 first and then all the @xmath11 components . </S>",
    "<S> the vector @xmath7 has @xmath15 entries where @xmath16 is the number of contacts between particles . </S>",
    "<S> the vector @xmath14 has @xmath17 entries where @xmath0 is the number of particles , with zero entries for all the particles on which there is no external force . </S>",
    "<S> we can then write the force balance condition as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a @xmath20 matrix . </S>",
    "<S> the entries in the matrix @xmath19 contain the directional information , see supplemental material at [ url will be inserted by publisher ] for an example of an @xmath19 matrix . </S>",
    "<S> denote the unit vector in the direction of the vector distance between the centers of mass of particles @xmath21 and @xmath22 by @xmath23 , and the tangential vector by @xmath24 orthogonal to @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> then the entries of @xmath19 display the projections @xmath25 and @xmath26 or @xmath27 and @xmath28 as appropriate . </S>",
    "<S> we thus guarantee that eq.([m ] ) is equivalent to the mechanical equilibrium condition @xmath29 as is well known , the friction - less granular system in the thermodynamic limit is jammed exactly at the isostatic condition @xmath30 @xcite . in the friction - less case @xmath19 is a @xmath31 matrix and as long as @xmath32 one can solve the problem by multiplying eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ m ] ) by the transpose @xmath33 , getting @xmath34 in this case the matrix @xmath35 has generically exactly three goldstone modes ( two for translation and one for rotation ) @xcite , and since the external force vector is orthogonal to the goldstone modes ( otherwise the external forces will translate or rotate the system ) , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ mmt ] ) can be inverted with impunity by multiplying by @xmath36^{-1}$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> in fact even when @xmath37 but the system is small enough to be jammed , this method can be used since there are enough constraints to solve for the forces . </S>",
    "<S> this last comment is important for our developments below .    </S>",
    "<S> the problem becomes under - determined above isostaticity in the frictionless case , when force chains begin to build up that span from one boundary to the other . </S>",
    "<S> with friction we anyway have twice as many unknowns and we need to add the constrains of torque balance . </S>",
    "<S> the condition of torque balance is @xmath38 on every particle , where @xmath39 is the external torque exerted on the @xmath21th disk @xcite . for disks </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath40 is in the normal direction , and therefore the torque balance becomes a condition that the sum of tangential forces has to balance the external tangential force . </S>",
    "<S> this condition can be added to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ m ] ) using a new matrix @xmath41 in the form @xmath42 the order of the extended matrix @xmath41 is @xmath43 , see supplemental material at [ url will be inserted by publisher ] for an example of @xmath44 . above jamming when the number of contacts increases @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> the matrix @xmath46 is not square , and the matrix @xmath47 which is of size @xmath48 , has at least @xmath49 zero modes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly it can not be inverted and one can conclude that * the conditions of mechanical equilibrium are not sufficient to determine all the forces . *    </S>",
    "<S> obviously what is missing are additional constraints to remove the host of zero modes . </S>",
    "<S> these additional constraints are _ geometrical _ constraints @xcite which can be read from those disks which describe connected polygons . in other words , since we know the orientation @xmath23 of each contact in our system , we can determine which granules are stressed in a triangular arrangement , and which in a square or pentagonal etc . , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ geometry ] .    </S>",
    "<S> each such arrangement is a constraint on the radius vectors adjoining the centers of mass . </S>",
    "<S> for example if particles @xmath50 and @xmath51 are in a triangular arrangement then @xmath52 , with the analogous constraint on squares , pentagons etc . </S>",
    "<S> these constraints can be written in a matrix form by denoting the _ amplitudes _ of inter - particle vector distances as @xmath53 where we again arrange the @xmath10 components first and the @xmath11 components second : @xmath54 where the matrix @xmath55 again has entries @xmath25 or @xmath26 as appropriate to represent the vectorial geometric constraints , see supplemental material at [ url will be inserted by publisher ] for an example of @xmath56 . denoting the total number of polygons by @xmath57 the dimension of the matrix @xmath55 </S>",
    "<S> is @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> of course @xmath53 has @xmath16 entries while @xmath7 had @xmath15 entries . </S>",
    "<S> note that in generic situations there can be also disks which are not stressed at all . </S>",
    "<S> these are referred to as  rattlers \" . </S>",
    "<S> for example in the configuration shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ geometry ] there exist 14 rattlers .    at this point </S>",
    "<S> we specialize the treatment to hookean normal forces with a given force constant @xmath59 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> non hookean forces result in a nonlinear theory that can still be solved but much less elegantly . for the present case @xmath60 \\ . \\label{sig}\\ ] ] denoting the amplitudes of the vectors @xmath61 as the vector @xmath62 ( again with first the @xmath10 and then the @xmath11 components ) , we can rewrite eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ q ] ) in the form @xmath63 </S>",
    "<S> having this result at hand we can formulate the final problem to be solved . </S>",
    "<S> arrange now a new matrix , say g , operating on a vector @xmath7 , with a rhs being a vector , say @xmath64 , made of a stacking of @xmath14 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , as before with @xmath10 and then @xmath11 components : @xmath67 using these objects our problem is now @xmath68 the dimension of the matrix @xmath69 is @xmath70 and the matrix @xmath71 has the dimension @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> we can use now the euler characteristic @xcite to show that the situation has been returned here to the analog of the invertible matrix @xmath72 when @xmath73 : the euler characteristic in two dimensions requires that @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the number of  rattlers \" i.e. disks on which there is no force . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly we find that @xmath76 consequently , the matrix @xmath77 has no zero eigenmodes . </S>",
    "<S> thus the final solution for the forces can be obtained as @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the set of eigenfunctions of @xmath77 associated with eigenvalues @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> we compared the inter - particle forces obtained from direct numerical simulations ( see below for details ) to those computed from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ final ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> both normal and tangential forces are of course identical to machine accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> we reiterate that we did not need to know the distances between particles . </S>",
    "<S> this is important in applying the formalism to experiments since it is very difficult to measure with precision the degree of compression of hard particles like , say , metal balls or sand particles . note also the remarkable fact that we never had to provide the frictional ( tangential ) force law in the formalism to obtain the correct forces !    at this point we can discuss the force chains . by definition </S>",
    "<S> these are the large forces in the system that provide the tenuous network that keeps the system rigid . observing eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ final ] ) we should focus on the eigenfunction @xmath79 of @xmath77 that have the smallest eigenvalues and the largest overlaps with @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> these can be found and arranged in order of the magnitude of @xmath82 independently of the calculation of @xmath7 . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ order ] we show the contribution to the total energy @xmath83 , learning that about 20% of the leading eigenfunction are responsible for 90% of the energy .    </S>",
    "<S> we can therefore hope that the force chains will be determined by the same relatively small number of eigenfunctions . </S>",
    "<S> this is not guaranteed ; due to contributions to the forces that oscillate in sign the convergence can be much slower than in the case of the energy where the sum is of positive contributions . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ chains ] we show in upper left panel the force chains in the configuration of fig .  [ geometry ] . in the other panels we show the prediction of the force chains using 100 , 200 and 300 of the ( energy ) </S>",
    "<S> leading modes . </S>",
    "<S> we learn that with 100 out of the 864 modes the main force chains begin to be visible . </S>",
    "<S> with 200 out of the 864 modes the full structure of the force chains is already apparent , although with 300 it is represented even better .    </S>",
    "<S> since the number of geometric constraints is very large , one can ask whether all the geometric constraints are necessary , as eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ euler ] ) shows that @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> the answer is no , we could leave out constraints as long as we have enough conditions to determine the solution . </S>",
    "<S> there is the obvious question then why do we have a unique solution when the number of equations is larger than the number of unknowns . </S>",
    "<S> the answer to this question lies in the properties of the vector @xmath64 and the matrix @xmath85 which does have many zero modes . </S>",
    "<S> a condition for the existence of a solution is that @xmath64 is orthogonal to all the zero modes of @xmath85 , as can be easily checked . </S>",
    "<S> we have ascertained in our simulations that this condition is always met .    in the near future </S>",
    "<S> we will present an extension of this formalism to three dimensions and the use of the formalism to study the instabilities of the force networks to changes in the external forces . as a final comment we should note that in fact only _ one _ external force is necessary to determine _ all _ the inter - disk forces . </S>",
    "<S> this single external force is necessary to remove the re - scaling freedom that this problem has by definition .    </S>",
    "<S> * simulations * : for the numerical experiments in 2-dimensions we use disks of two diameters , a ` small ' one with diameter @xmath86 and a ` large ' one with diameter @xmath87 . such @xmath0 disks are put between virtual walls at @xmath88 and @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> these walls exert external forces on the disks . </S>",
    "<S> the external forces are taken as hookean for simplicity . for disks near the wall at @xmath88 </S>",
    "<S> we write @xmath90 here @xmath91 denotes the @xmath10 component of the position vector @xmath40 of the center of mass of the @xmath21th disk , and we have a similar equation for the @xmath11 components with @xmath92 replaced by @xmath93 . </S>",
    "<S> when two disks , say disk @xmath21 and disk @xmath22 are pressed against each other we define their amount of compression as @xmath94 : @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the actual distance between the centers of mass of the disks @xmath21 and @xmath22 .    in our simulations </S>",
    "<S> the normal force between the disks acts along the radius vector connecting the centers of mass . </S>",
    "<S> we employ a hookean force @xmath97 .    to define the tangential force between the disks we consider ( an imaginary ) tangential spring at every contact which is put at rest whenever a contact between the two disks is formed . during the simulation we implement memory such that for each contact we store the signed distance @xmath98 to the initial rest state . for small deviations we require a linear relationship between the displacement and the acting tangential force . </S>",
    "<S> this relationship breaks when the magnitude of the tangential force reaches @xmath99 where due to coulomb s law the tangential loading can no longer be stored and is thus dissipated . </S>",
    "<S> when this limit is reached the bond breaks and after a slipping event the bond is restored with a the tangential spring being loaded to its full capacity ( equal to the coulomb limit ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the numerical results reported above were obtained by starting with @xmath100 particles on a rectangular grid ( ratio 1:2 ) with small random deviations in space and no contacts . </S>",
    "<S> we implement a large box that contains all the particles . </S>",
    "<S> the box acts on the system by exerting a restoring harmonic normal force as described in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ external ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the experiment is an iterative process in which we first shrink the containing box infinitesimally ( conserving the ratio ) . </S>",
    "<S> the second step is to annul all the forces and torques , to bring the system back to a state of mechanical equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore annul the forces using a conjugate gradient minimizer acting to minimize the resulting forces and torque on all particles . </S>",
    "<S> we iterate these two steps until the system is compressed to the desired state .    </S>",
