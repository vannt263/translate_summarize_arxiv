    "recent years have witnessed a growing interest in semimetallic systems in both two ( 2d ) and three ( 3d ) spatial dimensions , which support gapless quasiparticle excitations only in the vicinity of isolated band touching points in the brillouin zone ( bz ) .",
    "around such a diabolic point located at @xmath0 , the dispersion relations of the low energy quasiparticles become @xmath1 , where @xmath2 respcetively describe the conduction and the valence bands . consequently",
    ", the density of states ( dos ) at low energies becomes @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the spatial dimensionality and @xmath5 is the dynamic scaling exponent .",
    "when the fermi energy is pinned to the band touching points , these semimetals can possess interesting power law behaviors for thermodynamic and transport quantities as a function of temperature or external frequency .",
    "these power laws as determined by @xmath4 and @xmath5 are generically different from the ones obtained for a standard fermi liquid . in this respect , these semimetals provide striking examples of fermionic quantum criticality  @xcite . despite the difference in power law behaviors , these semimetals are not non - fermi liquids , as the quasiparticle excitations in these systems are well defined , i. e. , we have a finite quasiparticle residue .",
    "there are many well known examples of the @xmath6 semimetals , which possess linearly dispersing , massless dirac quasiparticles .",
    "monolayer graphene  @xcite in 2d and bi@xmath7sb@xmath8  @xcite , pb@xmath7sn@xmath8te  @xcite ,",
    "cd@xmath9as@xmath10  @xcite , na@xmath9bi  @xcite in 3d are some experimentally relevant examples of dirac semimetal .",
    "sometimes , these semimetals can also describe the universailty class of the quantum phase transition between two topologically distinct states .",
    "a 3d dirac semimetal with an odd number of dirac cones describes the quantum phase transition between a @xmath11 topological insulator and a trivial band insulator  @xcite . by applying pressure or chemical doping bi@xmath10se@xmath9",
    "can be tuned through a critical point that separates a strong @xmath11 topological insulator from a trivial band insulator @xcite , where the quantum critical point can be described by one species of 3d massless dirac fermion  @xcite .",
    "a similar transition in bi@xmath7sb@xmath8 produces three dirac cones .",
    "in contrast , pb@xmath7sn@xmath8te has four dirac cones and describes the transition between a crystalline topological insulator and a trivial insulator  @xcite .",
    "it is also conceivable to realize a @xmath12 parabolic semimetal for which the conduction and the valence bands show quadratic band touching .",
    "the prominent examples of such semimetals are the bernel - stacked bilayer graphene  @xcite in 2d , and hgte  @xcite , gray tin  @xcite , and the normal state at high temperature for some 227 iridates such as pr@xmath10ir@xmath10o@xmath13  @xcite ( above @xmath14 ) in 3d . while applied strain can covert hgte into a strong topological insulator , stretching ( if possible through negative chemical pressure ) can induce a dirac semimetal phase .",
    "the quantum phase transition between these two topologically distinct phases is succinctly described by the _ luttinger model _",
    "@xcite which provides a simple realization of three dimensional , @xmath12 fermionic critical theory .",
    "the stability of such noninteracting fermionic critical systems against disorder and interaction is a problem of deep fundamental importance .",
    "dirac semimetals in both two and three spatial dimensions are extremely robust against weak electron - electron interaction , which is an _ irrelevant _ perturbation due to the _ vanishing _ dos in the vicinity of the band touching point .",
    "this is captured by the scaling dimension of short range interaction @xmath15 .",
    "nevertheless , sufficiently strong interactions can drive dirac semimetals through continuous phase transitions and take it into various broken symmetry phases , where the spectrum becomes fully gapped @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", a long ago abrikosov and beneslavski noticed that coulomb interaction is a _ relevant _ perturbation in 3d parabolic semimetals with scaling dimension @xmath16 and predicted the possibility of an infra - red stable non - fermi liquid ( nfl ) fixed point in that system @xcite , which has recently been revisited by using the modern language of renormalization group ( rg ) and @xmath17-expansion @xcite . besides the nfl phase",
    ", it has also been conjectured that parabolic semimetals instead may support various _ excitonic _ ground states that in turn can replace the stable nfl phase at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "interesting enough , a recent one - loop rg calculation clearly demonstrated that seemingly irrelevant short - range coulomb interaction receives a strong boost from its long range tail and the nfl phase indeed becomes unstable towards the formation of a broken symmetry phase , even for arbitrarily weak bare strength of the short - ranged couplings @xcite .",
    "taking into account only the short - range components of coulomb interactions number of theoretical works have suggested the possibility of realizing numerous broken symmetry phases in bilayer grpahene @xcite .",
    "recent experiments are also strongly supportive of such phenomena in bilayer graphene at low temperatures , even in the absence of external magnetic or electric fields @xcite .",
    "one may therefore pose an interesting question : _ analogous to 3d , is it possible to find a stable non - fermi liquid phase in 2d parabolic semimetals _ ?",
    "this is the question we address in this paper pursuing a one - loop rg appraoch .",
    "for the sake of technical ease , we here choose to work with a simpler model for spinless fermions in a 2d system that supports only one parabolic touching in bz that , for example , can be realized in checkerboard or kagome lattices  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , our analysis can immediately be generalized for bilayer graphene .",
    "the role of disorder in semimetallic systems is a subtle issue .",
    "given that dos scales as @xmath3 , the standard born approximation dictates that quasiparticle lifetime ( @xmath18 ) goes as @xmath19 , when @xmath12 and @xmath20",
    ". therefore disorder appears to be an _ irrelevant _ perturbation in 3d parabolic semimetals .",
    "however , the proper insight into the pertinence of disorder can only be gained within the framework of rg .",
    "the averaged disorder potential assumes the form of an four - fermion interaction term that is , however , _ nonlocal _ ( infinitely correlated ) in imaginary time .",
    "the scaling dimension of the averaged disorder coupling ( @xmath21 ) is @xmath22=2z - d$ ] .",
    "therefore , scaling analysis dictates that any quenched short - ranged disorder is respectively a marginal and an irrelevant perturbation in 2d @xcite and 3d dirac semimetals @xcite . however , disorder is a _ relevant _",
    "perturbation in parabolic semimetals irrespective of its dimensionality , when @xmath23 . in this paper",
    "we will perform disorder averaging using the _ replica formalism _ and study its effects in parabolic semimetals in @xmath24 and @xmath25 through the procedure of coarse graining up to quadratic order in averaged disorder coupling ( @xmath21 ) .        here",
    "we would like to point out a subtle intricacy involved in the rg procedure for parabolic semimetals .",
    "the noninteracting hamiltonian @xmath26 and consequently the green s function @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the matsubara frequency and @xmath29 representing the spatial momenta , are defined in terms of @xmath4-wave or _ even - parity _ functions . as a result ,",
    "contributions form a pair of diagrams , shown in fig .",
    "[ lad - cross ] , do not cancel each other since @xmath30 .",
    "this situation is in stark distinction from the one in dirac semimetals , where the green s function is defined in terms of @xmath31-wave or _ odd - parity _ functions , and therefore @xmath32 .",
    "consequently , a bare theory that contains only one interaction or one disorder , remains closed under coarse graining in dirac semimetals . on the other hand , in parabolic semimetals even if the bare theory is defined only with the long - range coulomb interaction or onsite potential disorder , it generates additional short range interaction and disorder vertices ( time reversal symmetric ) , as we integrate out a shell of fast fourier modes . in this paper , we will thoroughly discuss the importance of these diagrams and the couplings they generate in both 2d and 3d parabolic semimetals .",
    "similar interplay between long range and short range interactions also arises for charged boson ( cooper pair )  @xcite    we now provide a synopsis of our central results .    1 .    in this paper",
    "we first study the disorder effects on 2d parabolic semimetals . for simplicity",
    ", we consider a spinless model described by a two - component spinor with parabolic band touching . through one loop rg calculations we show infinitesimally weak disorder is sufficient for destabilizing the parabolic semimetal .",
    "we argue that the disorder controlled phase is an anderson insulator .",
    "these outcomes are germane to disordered bilayer graphene as well .",
    "2 .   quenched disorder remains a relevant perturbation in 3d parabolic semimetals as well .",
    "infinitesimally weak disorder drives the parabolic semimetal into a diffusive metallic phase , where the dos , the quasiparticle lifetime , and the mean - free path all defined at zero energy become finite , before it turns into an anderson insulator at sufficiently large disorder .",
    "we also study the effect of electronic correlations in clean parabolic semimetals in two and three spatial dimensions . in 2d ,",
    "the short range interaction is a marginally relevant perturbation and its flow under rg suggests an instability of this system towards the formation of topological quantum anomalous hall insulator at lowest temperature .",
    "otherwise , the long range tail of coulomb interactions enhances such ordering tandency irrespective of the sign of the bare short range interaction .",
    "the long range coulomb interaction also leads to non mean - field corrections to various physical observables , such as critical temperature , scaling of specific heat .",
    "4 .   in 3d",
    "the situation is more interesting . if we neglect the long range piece of coulomb interactions , the rg flow equations can be closed in terms of _ two _ linearly independent short range quartic couplings .",
    "the set of coupled rg equations displays a _",
    "critical point _ , which possibly indicates the appearance of a broken symmetry phase that breaks the _ rotational invariance _ of the system in the ordered phase beyond a critical threshold of interaction strength . on the other hand ,",
    "when the long range part of coulomb interactions is restored such critical point gets vanquished and arbitrarily weak short - range interactions run away toward strong couplings .",
    "therefore , clean interacting 3d parabolic semimetal is also expected to discover itself in a strongly coupled broken symmetry phase , as our one loop rg calculations would suggest @xcite .",
    "finally we address the interplay of interaction and disorder in 2d and 3d parabolic semimetals .",
    "unfortunately both perturbations are relevant at the noninteracting fixed point and rg flows can not be controlled as all the couplings grow stronger during the procedure of coarse graining .",
    "nevertheless , from the flow equations of disorder and interaction couplings we can roughly estimate a qualitative phase boundary between a broken symmetry phase and anderson insulator in 2d or diffusive metal in 3d systems .",

    "hence , infinitesimally weak disorder is sufficient to destroy the ballistic , parabolic semimetal in 2d .",
    "notice , that even if we choose the bare coupling @xmath69 , it will be generated in the process of coarse graining .",
    "the perturbative rg calculations by itself can not reveal the nature of the disorder dominated phase . for a better understanding of this phase we can perform a self - consistent born approximation calculation , which is now justified by the strong coupling flow of disorder . due to the finite density of states at zero energy ,",
    "even the simple born approximation shows that an infinitesimally weak disorder is sufficient to cause a finite lifetime @xmath70 for the quasiparticle , where @xmath71 .",

    "for this reason , the two dimensional non - linear sigma model for the parabolic fermions can not remain gapless , and anderson localization becomes inevitable .",
    "the parabolic band touching in 3d can be well described by the luttinger hamiltonian @xcite . now",

    "one _ , which gives rise to the mean free path @xmath99 and the life - time @xmath100 at zero energy .",
    "this corresponds to the destabilization of the ballistic , incompressible semimetal phase in favor of a compressible , diffusive metal .",
    "this phase can again be described in terms of the non - linear sigma model for the diffusion modes . unlike in two dimensions ,",
    "the diffusive metal can remain stable up to a certain strength of disorder couplings before succumbing to the anderson insulator .",
    "before discussing the more realistic problem of the combined effects of interaction and disorder , we analyze the clean , interacting model to understand the role of electronic correlations . for clarity , we will consider two and three spatial dimensions separately .",
    "the 2d model only in the presence of the short range interactions has been considered in literature @xcite , where it has been shown that the short range interaction is a marginally relevant perturbation , which causes a bcs like instability towards an insulating , anomalous quantum hall state at zero temperature .",
    "similar mechanism also remains operative in bilayer graphene which can support a plethora of broken symmetry phases due to the presence of additional flavor degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "thus far the long range coulomb interaction and the short range interactions have not been treated on equal footing .",
    "the long range coulomb interaction at tree level is a relevant perturbation with scaling dimension @xmath101 , and can have more dominant effects than the short range interaction .",
    "it is also legitimate to ask , whether the coulomb interaction after many body screening effects can lead to an infra - red stable , nfl fixed point as discussed by abrikosov and beneslavskii for the 3d parabolic semimetal  @xcite .",
    "so far , rpa/ large n technique has been adopted by several authors  @xcite , which produces static screening of the coulomb interaction due to the finite dos at zero energy . since",
    ", in this process one first integrates out all the states from zero energy up to the ultra - violet cutoff , a subsequent coarse graining always remains a questionable procedure .",
    "for this reason we will perform a weak coupling rg analysis and treat both short range and long range interactions on an equal footing . in this and the subsequent section we will show a remarkable similarity for the flow of the coulomb coupling both in 2d and 3d , and its strong feedback effects to the coupling constants for the short range interactions .",

    "notice , that in contrast to the disordered problem where the dynamic exponent is an increasing function , the coulomb interaction rather causes a decrease of @xmath5 .",
    "physically this can be understood in the following way .",
    "disorder coupling tends to enhance the dos and lead to a slower dynamics , which leads to an increment of @xmath5 . on the other hand ,",

    "the long range coulomb interaction dramatically alters this picture . by itself",

    "_ @xcite the self - consistent generation of short range coupling from the @xmath112 has been ignored , which led to the infra - red stable , nfl fixed point .",
    "our analysis suggests that there are nfl corrections to the scaling at high temperatures , which finally give away in favor of a broken symmetry phase at some critical / transition temperature .",
    "ultimately , the weak coupling rg analysis of the long range interaction vindicates the existence of an excitonic condensate at low temperatures for both 2d and 3d clean interacting parabolic fermions , which is in agreement with the recent study by herbut and janssen @xcite .",
    "now we are in a position to consider the rg flow equations for the combined effects of disorder and interaction .",

    "there is an interaction dominant region determined by @xmath161 , when @xmath115 becomes @xmath162 before the disorder coupling . in this region",
    "the system should enter the anomalous quantum hall phase . inside this phase",
    "there is a hard gap in the density of states , and the disorder induced scattering rate at zero energy indeed vanishes . for disorder",
    "dominated phase determined by @xmath163 , we expect the system to be a topologically trivial anderson insulator .",
    "therefore , we expect a disorder and interaction controlled quantum phase transition between these topologically distinct phases . in the language of non - linear sigma model",
    ", we anticipate the emergence of a @xmath164 term at the critical point to make the sigma model gapless  @xcite .    for the 3d model",

    "this remains true even if we set @xmath146 .",
    "in particular , the quantum critical point found for the short range interactions gets ruined by disorder .",
    "this is actually not surprising .",
    "the landau theory mandates that the spin - orbit type of disorder mentioned above couples to the rotational symmetry breaking non - magnetic order parameter like a random field , and we have to consider a random field ising model to understand the stability of the broken symmetry phase . according to the celebrated imry - ma argument  @xcite the rotational symmetry breaking order parameter is destabilized below @xmath150 , and at long length scale we should be left with a disorder controlled diffusive metal . therefore , in the presence of disorder only a magnetically ordered phase can be the most viable broken symmetry phase .",
    "however , the competition between the magnetism and the disorder induced diffusive metal is beyond the scope of present weak coupling analysis .",
    "in this paper we have considered the stability of the parabolic semimetal in two and three spatial dimensions , which are examples of @xmath12 fermionic quantum critical systems . a perturbative renormalization group analysis of the disordered non - interacting model shows that the parabolic fixed point is vanquished by disorder in both 2d and 3d .",
    "the resulting disorder controlled phases in 2d and 3d respectively correspond to an anderson insulator and a diffusive metal .",
    "the rg flow equations for the clean interacting system show that the coupling constant for long range coulomb interaction has a tendency to flow into a nfl fixed point first considered by abrikosov and beneslavskii .",
    "however , the long range coulomb interaction also generates short range interaction in the process of coarse graining , which ultimately destabilizes the nfl fixed point , in favor of an excitonic condensate in both 2d and 3d .",
    "when both interaction and disorder effects are combined , the rotational ( or translational ) symmetry breaking non - magnetic phases ( e. g. , charge density wave and nematic phases ) get destroyed according to imry - ma argument below @xmath150 .",
    "for this reason , the time - reversal symmetry breaking order parameters will be most favorable candidates for the broken symmetry phase .",
    "for such states ( either magnetically ordered or anomalous quantum hall states in 2d ) a sharp quantum phase transition between the disordered controlled metal / insulator and the broken symmetry phase becomes viable .",
    "our calculations suggest that such quantum critical phenomena can be investigated in bilayer graphene ( 2d ) and pr@xmath10ir@xmath10o@xmath13 ( 3d ) in future experiments .",
