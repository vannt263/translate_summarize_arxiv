    "one goal of relativistic heavy ion collision experiments is to explore and map the qcd phase diagram as a function of temperature and baryon chemical potential .",
    "recent theoretical developments suggest that a key qualitative feature , namely a critical point which in a sense defines the landscape to be mapped , may be within reach of discovery and analysis by the cern sps or by rhic , if data is taken at several different energies @xcite .",
    "the discovery of the critical point would in a stroke transform the map of the qcd phase diagram from one based only on reasonable inference from universality , lattice gauge theory and models into one with a solid experimental basis @xcite .    in qcd with two massless quarks ( @xmath3 ; @xmath4 )",
    "the phase transition at which chiral symmetry is restored is likely second order and belongs to the universality class of @xmath5 spin models in three dimensions @xcite .",
    "below @xmath6 , chiral symmetry is broken and there are three massless pions . at @xmath7 , there are four massless degrees of freedom : the pions and the sigma . above @xmath7 , the pion and sigma correlation lengths are degenerate and finite .    in nature ,",
    "the light quarks are not massless . because of this explicit chiral symmetry breaking ,",
    "the second order phase transition is replaced by an analytical crossover : physics changes dramatically but smoothly in the crossover region , and no correlation length diverges .",
    "this picture is consistent with present lattice simulations @xcite , which suggest @xmath8 mev @xcite .",
    "arguments based on a variety of models @xcite indicate that the transition as a function of @xmath0 is first order at large @xmath1 .",
    "this suggests that the phase diagram features a critical point @xmath9 at which the line of first order phase transitions present for @xmath10 ends , as shown in figure 1 .",
    "would be a tricritical point , at which the first order transition becomes second order .",
    "] at @xmath11 , the phase transition at @xmath12 is second order and is in the ising universality class @xcite .",
    "although the pions remain massive , the correlation length in the @xmath13 channel diverges due to universal long wavelength fluctuations of the order parameter .",
    "this results in characteristic signatures , analogues of critical opalescence in the sense that they are unique to collisions which freeze out near the critical point , which can be used to discover @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the position of the critical point is , of course , not universal .",
    "furthermore , it is sensitive to the value of the strange quark mass .",
    "@xmath11 decreases as @xmath14 is decreased @xcite , and at some @xmath15 , it reaches @xmath16 and the transition becomes entirely first order @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath15 is an open question , but lattice simulations suggest that it is about half the physical strange quark mass @xcite , although these results are not yet conclusive @xcite .",
    "of course , experimentalists can not vary @xmath14 .",
    "they can , however , vary @xmath1 .",
    "the ags , with beam energy 11 agev corresponding to @xmath17 gev , creates fireballs which freeze out near @xmath18 mev @xcite .",
    "when the sps runs with @xmath19 gev ( beam energy 158 agev ) , it creates fireballs which freeze out near @xmath20 mev @xcite .",
    "rhic will make even smaller values of @xmath1 accessible . by dialing @xmath21 and thus @xmath1",
    ", experimenters can find the critical point @xmath9 .",
    "predicting @xmath11 , and thus suggesting the @xmath21 to use to find @xmath9 , is beyond the reach of present theoretical methods because @xmath11 is both nonuniversal and sensitively dependent on the mass of the strange quark .",
    "crude models suggest that @xmath11 could be @xmath22 mev in the absence of the strange quark @xcite ; this in turn suggests that in nature @xmath11 may have of order half this value , and may therefore be accessible at the sps if the sps runs with @xmath23 gev .",
    "however , at present theorists can not predict the value of @xmath11 even to within a factor of two .",
    "the sps can search a significant fraction of the parameter space ; if it does not find @xmath9 , it will then be up to the rhic experiments to map the @xmath24 mev region .    locating @xmath9 on the phase diagram can only be done convincingly by an experimental discovery .",
    "theorists can , however , do reasonably well at describing the phenomena that occur near @xmath9 , thus enabling experimenters to locate it .",
    "this is the goal of ref .",
    "the signatures proposed there are based on the fact that @xmath9 is a genuine thermodynamic singularity at which susceptibilities diverge and the order parameter fluctuates on long wavelengths .",
    "the resulting signatures are _ nonmonotonic _ as a function of @xmath21 : as this control parameter is varied , we should see the signatures strengthen and then weaken again as the critical point is approached and then passed .",
    "the simplest observables to use are the event - by - event fluctuations of the mean transverse momentum of the charged particles in an event , @xmath25 , and of the total charged multiplicity in an event , @xmath26 .",
    "one analysis described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite is based on the ratio of the width of the true event - by - event distribution of the mean @xmath25 to the width of the distribution in a sample of mixed events .",
    "this ratio was called @xmath27 .",
    "na49 has measured @xmath28 @xcite , which is consistent with expectations for noncritical thermodynamic fluctuations .. bose effects increase @xmath27 by @xmath29 @xcite ; an anticorrelation introduced by energy conservation in a finite system  when one mode fluctuates up it is more likely for other modes to fluctuate down  decreases @xmath27 by @xmath29 @xcite ; two - track resolution also decreases @xmath27 by @xmath29 @xcite . the contributions due to correlations introduced by resonance decays and due to fluctuations in the flow velocity are each significantly smaller than @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "] critical fluctuations of the @xmath13 field , i.e. the characteristic long wavelength fluctuations of the order parameter near @xmath9 , influence pion momenta via the ( large ) @xmath31 coupling and increase @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "the effect is proportional to @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the @xmath13-field correlation length of the long - wavelength fluctuations at freezeout @xcite . if @xmath34 fm , the ratio @xmath27 increases by @xmath35 , fifty times the statistical error in the present measurement @xcite .",
    "this observable is valuable because data on it has been analyzed and presented by na49 , and it can therefore be used to learn that pb+pb collisions at 158 agev do _ not _ freeze out near  @xmath9 .",
    "once @xmath9 is located , however , other observables which are more sensitive to critical effects will be more useful .",
    "for example , a @xmath36 , defined using only the softest @xmath37 of the pions in each event , will be much more sensitive to the critical long wavelength fluctuations .",
    "the higher @xmath25 pions are less affected by the @xmath13 fluctuations @xcite , and these relatively unaffected pions dominate the mean @xmath25 of all the pions in the event .",
    "this is why the increase in @xmath27 near the critical point will be much less than that of @xmath36 .",
    "the multiplicity of soft pions is an example of an observable which may be used to detect the critical fluctuations without an event - by - event analysis .",
    "the post - freezeout decay of sigmas , which are copious and light at freezeout near @xmath9 and which decay subsequently when their mass increases above twice the pion mass , should result in a population of pions with @xmath38 which appears only for freezeout near the critical point @xcite . if @xmath39 , this population of unusually low momentum pions will be comparable in number to that of the `` direct '' pions ( i.e. those which were pions at freezeout ) and will result in a large signature .",
    "the variety of observables which should all show nonmonotonic behavior near the critical point is sufficiently great that if it were to turn out that @xmath40 mev , making @xmath9 inaccessible to the sps , all four rhic experiments could play a role in the study of the critical point .",
    "our purpose in this paper is to estimate how large @xmath33 can become , thus making the predictions of ref .",
    "@xcite for the magnitude of various signatures more quantitative . in an ideal system of infinite size which was held at @xmath12 ; @xmath41 for an infinite time , the correlation length @xmath2 would be infinite . ref .",
    "@xcite estimated that finite size effects limit @xmath2 to be about 6 fm at most .",
    "we will argue in this paper that limitations imposed by the finite duration of a heavy ion collision are more severe , preventing @xmath2 from growing larger than about @xmath42 fm .",
    "we will do the calculation in the next section in the three - dimensional ising model , as appropriate for describing the universal dynamics of the long wavelength fluctuations near the critical point .",
    "however , in order to relate a calculation in the ising model to experiments which explore the qcd phase diagram , we will need numerical values for three temperature scales .",
    "several other nonuniversal quantities will also enter our calculation ; we will discuss them in the next section as they arise .",
    "we will see that in the end , only one combination of nonuniversal quantities plays a role in our estimates .",
    "we expect @xmath43 to be slightly less than the temperature range at which the crossover occurs at @xmath46 .",
    "we therefore take @xmath47 mev , at the low end of lattice estimates for the @xmath46 crossover temperature .",
    "as we have discussed at length , we know very little about @xmath11 .",
    "fortunately , we will not need a numerical value for @xmath11 below .",
    "pb+pb collisions at 158 agev freeze out at about 120 mev , and na49 data @xcite demonstrate clearly that they do _ not _ freeze out near @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "we also know @xcite that if the matter produced in a heavy ion collision comes near @xmath9 , the large specific heat characteristic of @xmath9 will cause the system to `` linger ''  the expansion will cause the energy density to decrease as usual , but this will result in an unusually slow temperature decrease .",
    "the freezeout temperature is therefore expected to be unusually close to the critical temperature for collisions which have the appropriate @xmath1 to pass near @xmath9 .",
    "for concreteness , we will take @xmath48 mev .. using smaller ions results in a fireball which freezes out earlier , at a larger @xmath44 @xcite . ]",
    "( if the freeze - out temperature in pb+pb collisions at 158 agev is closer to 100 mev , as some authors estimate @xcite , then it may be better to estimate that collisions which pass near @xmath9 freezeout at @xmath49 mev . )    finally , we need to estimate @xmath45 , the temperature at which we can begin an ising model treatment .",
    "the three dimensional ising model is only valid close enough to @xmath9 that the correlation length @xmath50 . in this critical region ,",
    "the long wavelength fluctuations of the order parameter become effectively three dimensional .",
    "( we will find that @xmath2 is never @xmath51 .",
    "this means that our estimates are not precise . )",
    "we need to know how far above @xmath43 the equilibrium correlation length is larger than @xmath52 .",
    "the model of ref .",
    "@xcite suggests that @xmath53 for @xmath54 .",
    "this estimate is based on a mean field analysis of a toy model , and so should not be taken too seriously .",
    "for concreteness we shall assume that @xmath55 at @xmath56 mev , 40 mev above @xmath57 .",
    "we will use @xmath58 fm to set the scale below , in the sense that we will estimate the factor by which @xmath59 grows as the system cools .",
    "fm is simply a definition ; @xmath45 , the temperature at which the equilibrium correlation length @xmath60 , is a quantity which must be estimated and which will affect our results .",
    "the nonequilibrium dynamics which we analyze in this paper is fundamental in the sense that it is _ guaranteed _ to occur in a heavy ion collision which passes near @xmath9 , even if local thermal equilibrium is achieved at a higher temperature during the earlier evolution of the plasma created in the collision .",
    "we assume early thermal ( although not necessarily chemical ) equilibration , and ask how the system evolves out of equilibrium as it passes @xmath9 .",
    "more precisely , we will assume that when the system has cooled to @xmath61 mev , it is in equilibrium , with @xmath62 . for the present , assume that the system cools through the critical point @xmath9 , as sketched in trajectory ( a ) of figure 1 .",
    "if it were to cool arbitrarily slowly , @xmath63 would be maintained at all temperatures , and @xmath2 would diverge at @xmath43 .",
    "however , it would take an infinite time for @xmath2 to grow infinitely large .",
    "indeed , near a critical point , the long correlation length results in long equilibration times , a phenomenon known as critical slowing down .",
    "this means that the correlation length can not grow as fast as @xmath64 , and the system can not stay in equilibrium .",
    "we describe the effects of critical slowing down on the time development of the correlation length @xmath65 using the following equation for @xmath66 : @xmath67 here , @xmath68 parametrizes the rate at which an out - of - equilibrium value of @xmath69 approaches its equilibrium value .",
    "if @xmath69 is close to its equilibrium value , the theory of dynamical critical phenomena @xcite tells us that @xmath70 where @xmath71 is a universal exponent and we have used @xmath72 to set the scale , making @xmath73 a dimensionless constant . knowing that we are interested in a system which is in the same static universality class as the 3-dimensional ising model is _ not _ enough to tell us @xmath71 .",
    "there are in general several different dynamical universality classes corresponding to a given static universality class .",
    "however , knowing in addition that : ( i ) the chiral order parameter is not a conserved quantity ; ( ii ) there are other conserved quantities in the system , like the baryon number density ; and ( iii ) there are no poisson bracket relations between the order parameter and the conserved quantities , tells us that our system belongs in the dynamical universality class named model c in halperin and hohenberg s classification @xcite of dynamical critical phenomena , and has @xmath74 where we have taken @xmath75 and @xmath76 from ref .",
    "the dimensionless constant @xmath73 is nonuniversal .",
    "we have no way to estimate it other than to guess that it is of order 1 .",
    "we will explore the sensitivity of our results to different choices of @xmath73 below .",
    "we will use the differential equation ( [ mainequation ] ) to analyze how critical slowing down prevents the correlation length @xmath2 from `` tracking '' @xmath77 .",
    "critical slowing down guarantees that the system falls out of equilibrium .",
    "note that the differential equation has only been derived for small departures from equilibrium ; once @xmath78 is not small , its use is not quantitatively justified .",
    ", instead of the equation ( [ mainequation ] ) for @xmath79 .",
    "these two equations give the same results for small departures from equilibrium , but they do not agree in all circumstances .",
    "for example , in a system which is not cooling and which has @xmath12 and @xmath80 for all time , only ( [ mainequation ] ) yields the correct result , namely @xmath81 at late time .",
    "]    we have initial conditions for the differential equation ( [ mainequation ] ) , namely @xmath82 .",
    "therefore , all we need in order to solve it is a description of @xmath83 .",
    "this requires @xmath84 , which we discuss below , and also requires a description of the cooling @xmath85 .",
    "this can be estimated using hydrodynamic and cascade model calculations , although these describe @xmath85 assuming the plasma is _ not _ cooling near the critical point @xmath9 .",
    "hydrodynamic models ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) describe @xmath85 at central rapidity in the center of mass frame via @xmath86 since we are only interested in a relatively small range of temperatures around @xmath43 , it will suffice for us to treat @xmath87 as constant in time .",
    "we discuss the effects of the time dependence of @xmath87 below .",
    "the expression ( [ dtdt ] ) assumes that the @xmath0-dependence of the energy density is @xmath88 as in a resonance gas , for which @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "the timescale @xmath90 is not constant over the whole history of the collision .",
    "a simplified estimate ( made by equating @xmath90 with the scattering time ) suggests that in pb+pb collisions at 158 agev , @xmath90 is between 4 and 10 fm at times of interest to us @xcite .",
    "this suggests @xmath91 at @xmath92 mev .",
    "careful analysis favors @xmath90 closer to @xmath93 fm @xcite .",
    "this agrees with a recent analysis of these collisions using the urqmd cascade model , which suggests @xmath94 at @xmath92 mev @xcite .",
    "these estimates are all for cooling through @xmath92 mev at a @xmath1 such that one is not near the critical point . as we discussed above",
    ", the cooling rate is likely to be unusually low near @xmath9 because of the large specific heat there ; we will therefore take @xmath95 as our estimate , noting also that the cooling rate at rhic will be slower still .",
    "we wish to use the three - dimensional ising model to describe @xmath96 near @xmath9 . in the ising model ,",
    "the order parameter @xmath97 ( the magnetization ) and the correlation length @xmath2 are functions of the reduced temperature @xmath98 and the magnetic field @xmath99 .",
    "( in the ising model , @xmath98 is defined as @xmath100 and is usually called @xmath101 ; we reserve the symbol @xmath101 for time , however . )",
    "the critical point is at @xmath102 ; at this point , @xmath103 and @xmath80 . for @xmath104",
    ", there is a first order phase transition as a function of @xmath99 at @xmath105 between @xmath106 for @xmath107 and @xmath108 for @xmath109 .",
    "the exponent is @xmath110 for the 3-dimensional ising model @xcite . for @xmath111 ,",
    "@xmath97 increases smoothly through zero as @xmath99 goes from negative to positive . for @xmath112 ,",
    "the order parameter is @xmath113 , with @xmath114 @xcite .",
    "we can now discuss how the ising model @xmath98- and @xmath99-axes are mapped onto the @xmath115 plane .",
    "the @xmath98-axis is the direction tangential to the line of first order phase transitions ending at @xmath9 .",
    "this is shown in figure 1 .",
    "there is no guarantee that the @xmath99-axis is perpendicular to the @xmath98-axis when both are mapped onto the @xmath115 plane .",
    "this mapping will in general deform the ising axes , but we have no way of estimating this deformation . and",
    "higgs mass @xmath116 , there is also a line of first order phase transitions ending at an ising critical point . here , the explicit mapping between ising axes and the @xmath117 plane has been constructed @xcite",
    "this is possible only because there are reliable numerical methods for analyzing the full , nonuniversal theory in the @xmath117 plane .",
    "universality arguments alone , which is all that we have at our disposal in the absence of lattice simulations at nonzero @xmath1 , do not tell us how the ising axes should be deformed in the @xmath115 plane of figure 1 . ] for simplicity , we draw the @xmath99-axis perpendicular to the @xmath98-axis in figure 1 . in thinking through the mapping between qcd and the ising model even qualitatively , it is important to note that the qcd order parameter ( the chiral condensate @xmath118 ) is offset with respect to the ising model order parameter ( the magnetization @xmath97 ) . in the ising model ,",
    "@xmath103 at the critical point and along the first order line one has phase coexistence between phases whose @xmath97 s are equal in magnitude and opposite in sign . in qcd ,",
    "@xmath119 at the critical point @xmath9 , because of the explicit breaking of the @xmath5 symmetry by quark mass terms . near @xmath9 , @xmath118 corresponds to @xmath97 plus an offset , and the phase coexistence is between phases with differing values of @xmath118 which both have the same sign . in figure 1",
    ", we take the @xmath120 side of the ising coexistence line to correspond to the higher temperature side of the qcd coexistence line , so that increasing @xmath97 corresponds to increasing the magnitude of @xmath118 .",
    "the matter created in heavy ion collisions at sps energies will follow a trajectory in the @xmath115 plane which is approximately vertical as it cools .",
    "( see , for example , ref .",
    "we therefore begin by considering trajectory ( a ) of figure 1 , which follows the @xmath99-axis , as this is likely not a bad approximation to cooling at almost constant @xmath1.-direction , corresponding to the reduced temperature direction in the ising model , is almost perpendicular to the @xmath0 direction in qcd .",
    "this is another reason why we have labeled it by a letter other than @xmath101 .",
    "] we have analyzed trajectories which pass through @xmath9 at a variety of angles , for example like trajectory ( b ) in figure  1 .",
    "the results do not differ qualitatively from those we present in detail for a trajectory along the @xmath99-axis , unless the trajectory passes through @xmath9 almost parallel to the @xmath98-axis . at the end of this section",
    ", we will present results for trajectories like ( c ) in figure 1 , which miss @xmath9 but come close to it .",
    "let us take the initial temperature in our calculation , @xmath61 mev , to correspond to @xmath121 . along the @xmath99-axis ,- axis , @xmath122 ; along the @xmath99-axis , @xmath123 ; for trajectories like ( b ) of figure 1 which pass through @xmath9 at generic angles , the larger exponent @xmath124 is the relevant one .",
    "our @xmath99-axis analysis is therefore a good guide to the generic case . ] as in trajectory ( a ) , the equilibrium correlation length is a power law in @xmath99 : @xmath125 where we have normalized @xmath2 by setting @xmath126 .",
    "that is , we measure @xmath2 in units of @xmath58 fm . with units chosen , we can now rewrite the equation ( [ mainequation ] ) which describes the dynamics of the growth of the correlation length @xmath127 in terms of ising model variables as @xmath128 where the nonuniversal constant @xmath129 is related to the other nonuniversal parameters we have discussed by : @xmath130 nonuniversal parameters appear in equation ( [ universalequation ] ) only in the single combination @xmath129 . taking the nonuniversal constant from ( [ gammadef ] ) to be @xmath131 , using @xmath132 mev",
    ", @xmath133 and @xmath134 yields the estimate @xmath135 in fact , because @xmath136 is a power law in @xmath99 , if one changes @xmath137 and then redefines the units of @xmath2 so that @xmath138 is again set to one , equation ( [ universalequation ] ) is unaffected .",
    "our results are therefore determined solely by @xmath73 , @xmath139 and @xmath87 in the single combination @xmath129 , together with the assumption that the system begins in equilibrium at @xmath140 .",
    "we can now use ( [ universalequation ] ) to learn how much @xmath2 grows relative to @xmath141 fm .",
    "given the uncertainties in the determination of @xmath129 , in figure 2 we show @xmath142 obtained by solving ( [ universalequation ] ) for @xmath143 .",
    "four lessons are apparent :    first , critical slowing down has a large effect .",
    "although by assumption we begin in thermal equilibrium with @xmath63 at @xmath140 , the fact that the dynamics slows down in the vicinity of @xmath9 prevents @xmath2 from tracking @xmath64 and growing very large .",
    "second , our results do not depend sensitively on the parameter @xmath129 .",
    "this is fortunate , since there are so many uncertainties involved in estimating @xmath129 . for @xmath143 ,",
    "the maximum correlation length which is achieved is @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 , corresponding to 2.6 , 3.0 , 3.4 fm .",
    "this means that although our estimate is only qualitative , it is clear that @xmath2 can not grow as large as 6 fm .",
    "( to obtain a maximum value of @xmath147 would require @xmath148 .",
    "although @xmath129 is uncertain , this large a value seems out of the question . )",
    "we estimate that @xmath2 grows to about twice @xmath72 , corresponding to approximately 3 fm .",
    "third , since previous work @xcite suggests that finite size effects limit @xmath2 to @xmath149 fm , we conclude that slowing out of equilibrium ( i.e. the combination of finite time and critical slowing down ) imposes the more stringent constraint on @xmath2 .",
    "we have analyzed this nonequilibrium effect as if the system were spatially homogeneous . had we found correlation lengths growing beyond 6  fm",
    ", we would have to do a much more complicated analysis , taking both the finite time and the inhomogeneous spatial dynamics into account . since we find that @xmath2 only grows to about 3 fm , this is not necessary .",
    "fourth , just as critical slowing down prevents @xmath2 from growing as fast as @xmath64 does , it also prevents @xmath2 from shrinking as fast as @xmath64 does after @xmath9 has been passed . whether we estimate @xmath150 mev ( corresponding to @xmath151 ) or @xmath152 mev ( @xmath153 ) for trajectories passing near @xmath9 , one finds @xmath154 .",
    "we can also argue that even if an @xmath129 as large as 1000 were possible , our conclusions would be little affected : if @xmath148 , and @xmath2 follows @xmath64 closely enough that it increases to @xmath155 , @xmath2 also tracks @xmath64 more closely as it decreases below @xmath43 .",
    "if @xmath148 , it turns out that @xmath2 is quite close to @xmath64 by the time @xmath151 .",
    "thus , although increasing @xmath129 to a ridiculous extent does increase the maximum value of @xmath2 , it has little effect on @xmath33 .",
    "this is further evidence that although our estimate @xmath156 fm is qualitative , it is robust .",
    "the @xmath129-dependence of the maximum value attained by @xmath2 can be understood analytically at large @xmath129 . for large @xmath129",
    ", @xmath69 tracks its equilibrium value @xmath157 well until @xmath158 is quite small .",
    "if we define @xmath159 , we can use ( [ universalequation ] ) to show that @xmath160 as long as @xmath161 if we assume that once @xmath2 begins to drop out of equilibrium ( i.e. once @xmath162 begins to grow comparable to @xmath163 ) , little further growth of @xmath2 occurs before @xmath2 reaches its maximum , we predict that @xmath2 will peak at @xmath164 for some constant @xmath165 .",
    "the maxima of solutions to ( [ universalequation ] ) obtained numerically follow this scaling relation ( with @xmath166 ) quite accurately once @xmath167 or so . even at much smaller @xmath129 , as in figure 2 , @xmath168 is within a few percent of that in ( [ scaling ] ) .",
    "this scaling relation explains why our results are so weakly dependent on @xmath129 .",
    "note that even with the scaling relation in hand , full solutions as in figure 2 are of value because they allow us to estimate @xmath33 and not just @xmath169 .",
    "we have to this point assumed that @xmath87 is approximately constant as the system cools through @xmath43 .",
    "this is an oversimplification .",
    "it is more reasonable to assume that @xmath170 is approximately constant , where @xmath171 is the entropy density .",
    "since @xmath172 and the specific heat @xmath173 is peaked at @xmath43 , we expect that @xmath87 is unusually small near @xmath43 . as we discussed above , this `` lingering '' results in a @xmath44 which is unusually close to @xmath43 @xcite . here",
    ", we estimate the effect of lingering near @xmath9 on the growth of @xmath2 . along the @xmath99-axis , the specific heat due to the long wavelength sigma fluctuations diverges like @xmath174 in thermal equilibrium @xcite .",
    "the exponent @xmath175 @xcite .",
    "we take @xmath176 , where @xmath177 is the specific heat due to all the degrees of freedom other than the sigma and is smooth near @xmath43 .",
    "note that @xmath173 depends on the actual correlation length @xmath2 , and not on @xmath64 . in our dynamical nonequilibrium",
    "setting , therefore , @xmath173 peaks but does not diverge .",
    "we can implement lingering in our calculation by replacing the constant @xmath129 in ( [ universalequation ] ) by @xmath178^{-\\gamma/\\nu}\\right]\\ . \\label{bdef}\\ ] ] here , @xmath129 is the same constant as before and the constant @xmath179 is the fraction of the specific heat at @xmath140 which is due to sigma fluctuations .",
    "this fraction is perhaps about @xmath180 and is surely less than @xmath181 .",
    "as the system cools from @xmath45 to @xmath43 , the sigma contribution to @xmath173 grows and peaks .",
    "we find that changing constant @xmath129 to @xmath182 as in ( [ bdef ] ) with @xmath183 increases @xmath169 by about @xmath37 beyond that shown in figure 2 , and increases @xmath33 by somewhat less .",
    "for @xmath184 , the increase in @xmath169 is about @xmath185 .",
    "we conclude that because @xmath173 receives contributions from all degrees of freedom and not just from the sigma fluctuations , and because @xmath173 , like @xmath2 , peaks but does not diverge , the reduction in @xmath87 near @xmath9 is not large enough to significantly increase @xmath2 beyond our previous estimates .",
    "we now ask how much our results change if we consider trajectories like ( c ) in figure 1 which come close to , but miss , @xmath9 . our analysis can easily be extended to cover those trajectories which pass @xmath9 on the crossover side ( @xmath111 ; @xmath186 ) . in an appendix , we present the ising model expression for @xmath187 near the critical point .",
    "we use this expression to evaluate @xmath142 for trajectories parallel to the @xmath99-axis with @xmath188 , @xmath189 and @xmath190 , for which @xmath64 peaks at @xmath155 , @xmath191 and @xmath192 .",
    "the results are shown in figure 3 in which we have taken @xmath193 .",
    "note that in plotting figure 3 we have defined @xmath194 anew for each @xmath98 .",
    "we see that as long as @xmath64 peaks at @xmath191 or higher , the dynamics of @xmath2 is almost the same as for the trajectory of figure 2 which goes precisely through @xmath9 . even for a trajectory which misses @xmath9 by enough that @xmath64 peaks at only @xmath192 , the actual correlation length @xmath2 grows by a factor which is within @xmath195 of that for trajectories which pass arbitrarily close to @xmath9 . just as the growth of @xmath2 is robust with respect to changes in @xmath129 , it is robust with respect to how close the trajectory comes to @xmath9 , for those trajectories which come close enough .",
    "our analysis is not sufficient to describe the dynamics for those trajectories which pass to the first order side of @xmath9 , because we do not treat the dynamics of bubble nucleation and phase coexistence .",
    "near enough to @xmath9 , though , the first order transition is so weak that it will not have detectable effects given the finite length and time scales in a heavy ion collision , and the physics is likely qualitatively similar to that we have analyzed on the crossover side of @xmath9 .",
    "farther from @xmath9 on the first order side , this is not the case .",
    "farther from @xmath9 , though , the correlation length is never large .",
    "our results have a number of consequences which should be taken into account both in planning experimental searches for the qcd critical point , and in planning future theoretical work .",
    "because of critical slowing down , the correlation length in a heavy ion collision can not grow as fast as it would in equilibrium ; this means that @xmath33 is likely about 3 fm for trajectories passing near @xmath9 .",
    "although finite size effects alone would allow a correlation length as large as 6 fm , this is unrealistic to expect in a heavy ion collision .",
    "this effect arises due to _ guaranteed _ nonequilibrium physics : even if heavy ion collisions achieve local thermal equilibrium above the transition , as we have assumed , if they cool through the transition near the critical point they must `` slow out of equilibrium . '' by this we mean that the correlation length can not grow as it would in equilibrium , because the long wavelength dynamics are slow near  @xmath9 .",
    "critical slowing down also prevents the correlation length from decreasing quickly after passing the critical point .",
    "one therefore need not worry about @xmath2 decreasing significantly between the phase transition and freezeout .    one need not hit @xmath9 precisely in order to find it .",
    "the results shown in figure 3 demonstrate that if one were to do a scan with collisions at many finely spaced values of the energy and thus @xmath1 , one would see signatures of @xmath9 with approximately the same magnitude over a broad range of @xmath1 .",
    "the magnitude of the signatures will not be narrowly peaked as @xmath1 is varied . as long as one gets close enough to @xmath9 that the equilibrium correlation length is @xmath196",
    ", the actual correlation length @xmath2 will grow to @xmath197 .",
    "there is no advantage to getting closer to @xmath9 , because critical slowing down prevents @xmath2 from getting much larger even if @xmath64 does .",
    "data at many finely spaced values of @xmath1 is _ not _ called for . over which @xmath198 fm is about @xmath199 mev for @xmath200 mev .",
    "similar results can be obtained @xcite within a random matrix model @xcite .",
    "it is likely over - optimistic to estimate @xmath199 mev when the effects of the strange quark are included and @xmath11 itself is reduced .",
    "a conservative estimate would be to use the models to estimate that @xmath201 . ]",
    "only one combination of the nonuniversal quantities ( called @xmath129 above ) plays an important role in estimating the dynamics of @xmath2 .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath129 is the sum of that in its three factors : @xmath73 ( the nonuniversal constant in the dynamical scaling law ( [ gammadef ] ) ) , @xmath87 and @xmath202 .",
    "it is already fortunate that only one combination @xmath129 matters ; it is even more fortunate that our results are not very sensitive to the value of @xmath129 .",
    "this means that although our results are not completely quantitative , they are robust .",
    "in addition to the uncertainty in @xmath129 , however , our results can not be treated as precise because the qcd dynamics are precisely described by the three - dimensional ising model dynamics only if @xmath203 , and we have found that @xmath2 does not grow beyond @xmath204 .",
    "there are a number of steps that could be taken in future work to refine our estimate .",
    "one could do a more complete job of analyzing the universal dynamics of a system which passes near an ising critical point . for example , instead of simply writing a differential equation for @xmath2 , one could follow the full 3 + 1-dimensional dynamics in a langevin simulation , from which one would measure @xmath2",
    ". doing this , however , would still leave one facing the same nonuniversal uncertainties which we face in our treatment .",
    "if we simply ask how to reduce the uncertainty in @xmath129 , perhaps the hardest part of this task would be a reliable calculation of @xmath73 , as that would require a reliable calculational method for qcd dynamics at nonzero @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the other two ingredients in @xmath129 are likely to become better known as the modeling of heavy ion collisions and the analysis of data from these collisions proceed .",
    "it seems , though , that the uncertainty in @xmath73 will prevent a fully quantitative calculation of @xmath129 for the foreseeable future .",
    "our results are sufficiently insensitive to @xmath129 that they suffice to estimate the magnitude of signatures ; when these signatures are found , perhaps they will give us more quantitative information about the nonuniversal quantities which go into @xmath129 .    knowing that we are looking for @xmath205 fm is very helpful in suggesting how to employ the signatures described in detail in ref",
    "the excess of pions with @xmath38 arising from post - freezeout decay of sigmas is large as long as @xmath206 , and does not increase much further if @xmath33 is longer .",
    "this makes it an ideal signature .",
    "the increase in the event - by - event fluctuations in the mean transverse momentum of the charged pions in an event ( described by the ratio @xmath207 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) is proportional to @xmath32 .",
    "the results of ref .",
    "@xcite suggest that for @xmath208 fm , this will be a @xmath209 effect .",
    "this is ten to twenty times larger than the statistical error in the present na49 data , but not so large as to make one confident of using this alone as a signature for @xmath9 .",
    "the solution is to use signatures which focus on the event - by - event fluctuations of only the low momentum pions .",
    "unusual event - by - event fluctuations in the pion momenta arise via the coupling between the pions and the sigma order parameter which , at freezeout , is fluctuating with correlation length @xmath33 .",
    "this interaction has the largest effect on the softest pions @xcite .",
    "@xmath36 , described in the introduction , is a good example of an observable which takes advantage of this .",
    "depending on the details of the cuts used to define it , it should be enhanced by many tens of percent in collisions passing near @xmath9 .",
    "@xcite suggests other such observables , and more can surely be found .",
    "together , the excess multiplicity at low momentum ( due to post - freezeout sigma decays ) and the excess event - by - event fluctuation of the momenta of the low momentum pions ( due to their coupling to the order parameter which is fluctuating with correlation length @xmath33 ) should allow a convincing detection of the critical point @xmath9",
    ". both should behave nonmonotonically as the collision energy , and hence @xmath1 , are varied .",
    "both should peak for those heavy ion collisions which freeze out near @xmath9 , with @xmath208 fm .",
