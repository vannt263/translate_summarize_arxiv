    "a standard problem in quantum field theory is to calculate the decay width @xmath4 of a parent particle @xmath5 to @xmath0 number of daughter particles .",
    "as is well - known , the physics resides in the spin - averaged matrix element squared @xmath6 for the transition , but there are two kinematic factors also , namely , the initial flux ( which is given by the mass of @xmath5 if it is at rest ) and the @xmath0-body phase space . while the calculation of @xmath4 for @xmath7 processes is an undergraduate exercise , the phase space integration gets complicated for @xmath8 , and even more so if all the particle masses are kept in the calculation .",
    "often , this has to be done by some monte carlo ( mc ) sampling @xcite , introducing further uncertainties and also taking a lot of computer time .",
    "depending on the complexity of the phase space , one has to compromise between the accuracy and the computer time needed , even more so if a huge number of events are to be generated .    in this paper",
    "we would like to propose an algorithmic approach to deal with the @xmath9 cascade decays , mediated by _ virtual",
    "_ particles .",
    "the algorithm does not work if one or more of the intermediate particles are on - shell ; one must apply the algorithm separately for different cascade branches .",
    "the algorithm consists of the following steps .",
    "several examples are provided later on , as well as estimates of numerical accuracy of the approach .    1 .",
    "cut each and every off - shell propagator into two pieces such that the full cascade can be decomposed in terms of multiple @xmath7 decays .",
    "this is , of course , not the usual prescription of cutkosky @xcite of cutting an on - shell propagator to get the absorptive part of the amplitude .",
    "rather , this is an artificial cut , and one must remember that the cut propagator is still off - shell . thus , ( i ) the spin sum over the off - shell leg can not be done at this stage , and ( ii ) the phase space becomes imaginary .",
    "2 .   assign spin ( for fermions ) and polarization ( for gauge bosons ) indices for all particles , both on- and off - shell .",
    "our convention for the following examples will be to use latin ( greek ) alphabet for fermion ( gauge boson ) polarization indices . we will call both of them spin , as there should not be any chance of confusion .",
    "3 .   while squaring the amplitude , one must not sum over the external leg spins that are off - shell , as mentioned in rule 1 .",
    "the indices that appear in the vertices are to be summed over as usual . following this prescription , we calculate a few quantities ( examples are provided later ) which are analogous to the scalar quantities like @xmath6 or @xmath4 that one usually computes .",
    "however , because of the floating indices , they are not scalars in our case ; rather , they are tensors in spin indices .",
    "4 .   once we compute all such variables necessary for the full cascade decay , we will club them according to their appearance in the cascade such that all the spin indices are contracted leading to the trace of the full matrix in spin space .",
    "the final trace is a scalar quantity . for an off - shell scalar propagator",
    ", the entire trace can be decomposed into the product of two traces .",
    "the most important part is to write the @xmath7 phase space function in terms of the invariant masses of the off - shell particles and then integrate over all possible values of the invariant mass .",
    "+ for @xmath0 off - shell particles there will be @xmath0 such integrals .",
    "this integral takes into account the off - shell propagator too .",
    "this is the crux of the algorithm and should better be followed by the following examples .",
    "6 .   all the intermediate  partial decay widths \" @xmath10 are to be defined in the prescribed way .",
    "their dimensions need not be that of mass .",
    "7 .   finally , for identical particles in the final state , we need to incorporate the symmetry factor in the form of @xmath11 for the decay @xmath12 .",
    "thus , the width for the decay @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 should typically be of the form @xmath16",
    "\\left[\\frac{1}{\\pi } \\frac{dm_{fg}^2}{(m_{fg}^2-m_c^2)^2}\\right ] \\tg(a\\to bc ) \\tg(b\\to de ) \\tg(c\\to fg)\\,,\\ ] ] where , for example , @xmath17 which is easy to evaluate ; the only thing to keep in mind is to use @xmath18 instead of @xmath19 because @xmath20 is off - shell .",
    "the factor of @xmath21 is the flux factor evaluated in the rest frame of the parent particle .",
    "if the intermediate state @xmath20 has a large width , we should replace @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the decay width of @xmath20 . here",
    "we will work in the narrow width approximation .",
    "why is this proposal working ?",
    "an intuitive justification is that when one integrates over the invariant masses , the invariant mass can effectively be used in place of the physical mass for the parent particle .",
    "using the invariant mass has the extra advantage that the phase space is always real .",
    "we are effectively decomposing the full phase space of the entire cascade into several parts , writing each of them in terms of trivial @xmath7 phase spaces .",
    "now these individual subdiagrams have been computed using the standard techniques of quantum field theory , so there is no ambiguity . the essential part of our proposal is to provide the prescription to join those contributions , maintaining the flow of polarizations through off - shell propagators .",
    "thus this method can be applied to any tree level cascade decay , irrespective of the spin of the intermediate propagators , and the number of such propagators . however , at this present form , it can not be applied to calculate loop integrals , unless they can be reduced to some effective operators .",
    "a few examples will now follow .",
    "we will , however , not show the detailed evaluation of @xmath6 , which is an undergraduate exercise .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in section 2",
    ", we will provide a ` toy ' example with an off - shell scalar propagator . in section 3 ,",
    "more examples will be provided , including numerical checks with the existing software .",
    "we conclude in section 4 .",

    "suppose the decay chain is @xmath32 , @xmath33 . according to our proposal , the virtual decay width of @xmath33 is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the momentum transfer through @xmath28 ;",
