    "most of galaxies contain smbhs at their centers . if a galaxy collides with another galaxy , the merging remnant hosts two smbhs and they form a binary system .",
    "@xcite discussed the possibility of the formation of smbh binaries and their evolutions .",
    "they concluded that the evolution of the semi - major axis stalls after they ejected out all the nearby stars ( loss cone depletion ) and the binary is unlikely to merge within the hubble time , as far as we consider the stellar dynamical effects and the gravitational wave radiation only .",
    "this problem is called as `` last parsec problem '' since the typical separation of a stalled binary is around one parsec .",
    "many researchers studied this problem and confirmed that the separation of the binary stall @xcite .",
    "most of previous works on the evolution of the smbh binary focused on the evolution of the semi - major axis .",
    "recently , @xcite performed @xmath0-body simulations of smbh - imbh binaries with the mass ratio of 1000:1 , and found that the eccentricity of the binary grows toward unity after the loss cone depletion .",
    "because of this increase of eccentricity , the merging timescale through the gravitational radiation goes below @xmath1 years even if the loss cone is depleted .",
    "similar result was obtained by @xcite , and it has been reported that under certain circumstance smbh binaries of mass ratios close to 1:1 show similar increase of the eccentricity @xcite .    however , this increase of the eccentricity is difficult to understand , because the measured differential cross sections of interaction between an smbh binary and field stars indicated that eccentricity of a smbh binary would not increase through interaction with field stars @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite pointed out that the bound stars around smbh binary play important role in the evolution of the eccentricity but did not give the explanation about the mechanism of the eccentricity growth .",
    "if the increase of eccentricity actually occurs in real smbh binaries , it naturally explains the orbit of the binary in the quasar oj287 @xcite .",
    "the central smbh of the quasar oj287 has the mass of @xmath2 , and the secondary black hole has the mass @xmath3 , orbital period of 12 yrs , and eccentricity of 0.66 .",
    "currently , this smbh binary is in the process of circularization due to the gravitational wave radiation .",
    "thus , one would expect that oj287 had much larger semi - major axis and eccentricity very close to unity in the past .    in this letter",
    ", we describe the mechanism which drives the increase of the eccentricity . in section 2",
    ", we describe the numerical experiment we performed . in section 3 ,",
    "we present the interpretation of the numerical result .",
    "we give the discussion and summary in section 4 .",
    "in order to clarify the mechanism which drives the growth of the eccentricity of unequal - mass smbh binaries , we performed @xmath0-body simulations and investigated the change in orbital property of field stars due to interaction with the smbh binary .",
    "our initial model is similar to that of @xcite .",
    "galaxy density profile is given by where @xmath4 is the scale length and @xmath5 is the total mass of field particles , and we set @xmath6 and @xmath7 . from observations ,",
    "the slope of central density of a giant elliptical galaxy is shallower than @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "this feature is well understood by numerical simulations and theory @xcite . in our simulation ,",
    "the density is @xmath9 cusp .",
    "the velocity profile is isotropic and consistent with the density profile .",
    "the number of field stars @xmath0 are 16384 and 32768 .",
    "we performed five runs for each @xmath0 .",
    "the heavier smbh particle whose mass is @xmath10 is placed at the center of the galaxy , and the lighter one whose mass is @xmath11 is placed in an eccentric orbit with eccentricity @xmath12 of 0.2 and semi - major axis @xmath13 of 20pc . at this radius",
    "the enclosed stellar mass is comparable to that of the secondary mass and the stall of the evolution of semi - major axis takes place quickly .",
    "the mass of field particles @xmath14 in the case of @xmath15 .",
    "our simulation roughly mimics the oj287 system .",
    "the time integration scheme we used is the fourth - order hermite scheme @xcite for interactions between the field - field particles and the secondary smbh - field particles .",
    "the forces from the primary smbh are integrated with the sixth - order hermite scheme @xcite to reduce the integration error . to save the calculation time , we used grape - dr @xcite for calculating interactions between the field - field particles .",
    "figure 1 shows the evolution of the semi - major axis @xmath13 , the eccentricity @xmath12 and the merging timescale due to the gravitational wave radiation @xmath16 of a smbh binary using @xcite formula , for an @xmath15 run .",
    "the evolution of the semi - major axis slows down and deviates from the theoretical prediction . at the same time , the eccentricity starts to grow , and reaches @xmath17 by @xmath18 myrs .",
    "this increase of eccentricity causes the drastic decrease of the merger timescale through gravitational wave radiation . in this case , at @xmath19 myrs , the merger timescale is 10 gyrs , but by @xmath20 myrs the timescale shrinks to 10 myrs .",
    "we did not include the effect of the gravitational wave radiation , but if we did , the smbh binary would have merged very quickly .",
    "figure 2 shows the evolutions of the eccentricity for all runs .",
    "the evolutions in all runs inferred from figure 2 are basically similar .",
    "the variation of the results of @xmath15 runs is smaller than that of @xmath21 runs .",
    "these appear to be no statistically significant difference between the results for @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "we have carefully analyzed the behavior of the stars around the smbh binary in our numerical simulation , and found that the following three - stage mechanism drives the increase in the eccentricity of the secondary .    1 .",
    "the presence of the secondary gives small , non - axisymmetric perturbation to the orbits of the field stars , which would be purely keplerian otherwise . because of this perturbation the orbital motions of the stars become chaotic , and their angular momenta change chaotically .",
    "2 .   since the orbital angular momenta of stars are not conserved , they can experience close encounters with the secondary , some of which result in the ejection of stars .",
    "when a star is on a prograde orbit relative to the orbit of the secondary , it has a much larger chance of being ejected than when it is on a retrograde orbit .",
    "3 .   since the secondary tends to scatter stars on prograde orbits , there will be more stars on retrograde orbits than on prograde orbits around the binary .",
    "however , the chaotic changes of angular momenta of stars reduce the difference between the number of stars on prograde and retrograde orbits .",
    "this means the angular momentum of the secondary is transferred to field stars and the eccentricity of the secondary increases .",
    "note that in this process the transfer of angular momentum occurs between the binary and field stars , while field stars are bound to the system , through secular perturbation .",
    "this secular perturbation is neglected in previous theoretical models on the behavior of smbh binaries @xcite or models based on scattering experiment @xcite , and can give the reasonable interpretation of the results of @xcite .",
    "figure 3 shows the time evolution of the specific angular momentum of a star that comes close to the secondary smbh .",
    "the orbital plane of the secondary smbh is the @xmath23 plane .",
    "one can see that none of the three components of the angular momentum are conserved and the changes are complicated .",
    "these changes are due to the secular perturbation of the secondary smbh .",
    "if the secondary smbh had a circular orbit , the secular perturbation would not have any non - axisymmetric term , and therefore @xmath24 would be conserved @xcite . however , since the secondary smbh has non - zero eccentricity , the perturbation has non - axisymmetric term , resulting in a triaxial potential field .",
    "thus , the orbits of many stars become chaotic @xcite .    this chaotic change of the orbits of field stars means that they approach the secondary smbh when their total angular momentum becomes small enough .",
    "one can assume that stars on both prograde and retrograde orbits will approach the secondary smbh in roughly equal chances .",
    "the cross section of the large change of the binding energy , which would result in the ejection of a star , is larger for prograde orbits , because the typical relative velocity is smaller for prograde orbits and the effect of gravitational focusing is larger .",
    "figure 4 shows the cumulative mass of ejected stars in units of the mass of secondary smbh .",
    "we can see that prograde stars are more likely to be ejected . in this calculation , the difference between the cumulative mass of ejected stars on prograde and retrograde orbits was comparable to the mass of the secondary smbh . for @xmath25 , the ejection rates of prograde and retrograde stars are rather similar , but that is simply because the eccentricity of the secondary smbh has become large enough and therefore the relative difference in the cross section terms has become small .",
    "figure 5 shows the evolution of the average value of @xmath24 of stars which are bound to the primary smbh at @xmath26 and are ejected by @xmath27 . the net change of @xmath24 of stars which were initially in prograde orbit is small , while that of stars in retrograde orbits is large .",
    "thus the primary mechanism of angular momentum transfer is the transfer of angular momentum to retrograde stars through secular perturbation and removal of them through ejection .",
    "to summarize , we found a quite efficient mechanism that causes the increase of the eccentricity of unequal - mass smbh binaries .",
    "it is the combination of the non - axisymmetric potential field of the secondary smbh , which randomizes the angular momentum of field stars , and the selective ejection of stars with prograde orbits through close encounters with the secondary smbh .",
    "since either effects depends on masses of field particles , our proposed mechanism does not depend on @xmath0 .",
    "this mechanism is effective at least for smbh binaries with fairly large mass ratios ( larger than 10:1 ) .",
    "there is no other known mechanism that can make the eccentricity of a smbh binary close to unity .",
    "both the gravitational wave radiation and gas dynamical effect reduce the eccentricity , and interaction with field stars , if we neglect the mechanism we described in this paper , would not change the eccentricity @xcite . if the parent galaxy is globally nonspherical , the smbh binary could become eccentric because of the kozai mechanism , but it would be hard to reach very high eccentricity values since the @xmath28-component would be conserved if the parent galaxy is axisymmetric . if the parent galaxy is triaxial , we could expect to see a significant effect on the evolution of the semi - major axis @xcite , but its effect on eccentricity is currently unknown . furthermore , it is difficult to maintain triaxiality given the presence of the central smbh @xcite .",
    "if the mass ratio between the secondary smbh and the field stars is infinite , in other words , in the continuous limit , we can expect that the eccentricity of the smbh binary reaches unity . in practice , since the mass and the number of field stars are both finite , they give random perturbations to the angular momentum of smbh binary .",
    "if we assume that there is thermal equilibrium between tangential velocity of the secondary smbh and random velocity of stars around the secondary , we can estimate the specific angular momentum @xmath29 and the eccentricity @xmath12 of the secondary smbh as and where @xmath30 is the mean value of the specific angular momentum of the field star around the secondary smbh and @xmath31 and @xmath32 are masses of the secondary and the field star , respectively .",
    "the timescale of the change in the angular momentum of the field stars is proportional to @xmath34 , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the masses of the primary and secondary smbhs , respectively .",
    "the rate at which angular momentum is removed through ejection of stars is @xmath37 , since it is proportional to the interaction cross section . therefore ,",
    "if @xmath34 is large , the timescale of the change in the angular momentum is shorter than that of the removal of the field stars .",
    "thus @xmath38 is determined by the removal timescale .",
    "the loss rate of the angular momentum of the secondary smbh is proportional to @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the density at the radius of the secondary , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are a kepler velocity and cross section of the secondary .",
    "thus , @xmath38 is proportional to @xmath43 . from our numerical result",
    ", we can estimate the timescale as where @xmath44 is a semi - major axis of a stalled binary and assumed @xmath45 .",
    "since the majority of galaxy - galaxy merger events are minor mergers with mass ratios of around 10:1 or more , the typical mass ratio of the smbh binary is also around 10:1 , if we assume the linear relationship between the smbh mass and the mass of the stellar spheroid @xcite .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that our mechanism is effective for most of smbh binaries , and they can merge through interactions with field stars and gravitational wave radiation . our result finally has given a definite solution to the `` last - parsec problem '' @xcite .",
    "the mechanism we found naturally explains why the oj287 system is eccentric .",
    "most likely , this mechanism resulted in the orbit of secondary with the periastron distance similar to the present value , but with much larger semi - major axis and eccentricity , and gravitational wave radiation have driven the semi - major axis to its present value .",
    "the state of a recently found candidate smbh binary @xcite might also be explained by our mechanism .",
    "this system is a binary with the mass ratio of around 30:1 .",
    "interaction with field stars can not drive its semi - major axis to the value suggested by the observed relative velocity of @xmath46 , if we assume a circular orbit .",
    "however , our mechanism implies that all unequal - mass smbh binaries with mass ratio larger than 10:1 become highly eccentric .",
    "thus , they all have very large relative velocities at the pericenter .",
    "therefore the observed relative velocity is only weakly coupled to the semi - major axis .",
    "the frequency @xmath47 is given by where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the pericenter distance of the secondary smbh from the primary and the distance of the binary from us .",
    "unfortunately , the frequency is too low to be observed even with space missions like lisa .",
    "however , since the amplitude is very large , other techniques such as doppler tracking of interplanetary spacecraft or pulsar timing could be used .      in this letter",
    ", we present a stellar - dynamical mechanism that drives the increase of the eccentricity of an smbh binary .",
    "there are two key processes involved .",
    "the first one is the kozai mechanism under non - axisymmetric potential , which effectively randomizes the angular momenta of surrounding stars .",
    "the other is the selective ejection of stars with prograde orbits . through these two mechanisms ,",
    "field stars extract the orbital angular momentum of the smbh binary .",
    "our proposed mechanism causes the increase of the eccentricity of most of smbh binaries , resulting in the rapid merger through gravitational wave radiation .",
    "this research is partially supported by the special coordination fund for promoting science and technology ( grape - dr project ) , ministry of education , culture , sports , science and technology , japan .",
    "part of calculations were done using the grape system at the center for computational astrophysics ( cfca ) of the national astronomical observatory of japan ."
