    "investigations of mass spectra have always provided promising clues for solving problems in physics : for example , the balmer formula brought the bohr theory , and the gell - mann - okubo mass formula brought the quark model .",
    "therefore , we may expect that investigation of the quark and lepton mass spectra and mixings will also provide a promising clue to new fundamental physics .    meanwhile , in the charged lepton sector , we know that an empirical relation  @xcite @xmath15 is satisfied with the order of @xmath16 with the pole masses @xcite , i.e. @xmath17 while it is only valid with the order of @xmath18 with the running masses , i.e. @xmath19 at @xmath20 . in conventional mass matrix models , ",

    "\" why is the mass formula ( [ k_relation ] ) so remarkably satisfied with the pole masses ? this has been a mysterious problem as to the relation ( [ k_relation ] ) for long years .",
    "recently , a possible solution of this problem has been proposed by sumino @xcite .",
    "the deviation of @xmath21 from @xmath22 is caused by a logarithmic part @xmath23 in the radiative correction term @xcite @xmath24 ( note that the formula ( 1 ) is invariant under a transformation @xmath25 if the value @xmath26 is independent of a family number . ) he considers that a flavor symmetry is gauged , and the logarithmic term in the radiative correction to the charged lepton masses due to photon is exactly canceled by that due to family gauge bosons .",

    "even apart from such a cancellation mechanism , the assignment @xmath36 seems to be natural also from a point of view of grand unification ( gut ) scenarios .",

    "since the family gauge symmetry proposed by sumino has the energy scale @xmath42 tev , at which the charged lepton mass relation @xmath43 is exactly satisfied and the gauge bosons acquire their masses as shown in eq.(10 ) , differently from other family gauge symmetry models , searches for the family gauge boson effects soon become within our reach .      the new assignment @xmath36 can induce interesting observable effects . in the conventional assignment , a family gauge boson @xmath44 couples to a current component @xmath45 , while in the present model , the gauge boson @xmath44 couples to @xmath46 in general , the current - current interactions by this type of currents cause interactions which violate the individual family number @xmath47 by @xmath48 .",
