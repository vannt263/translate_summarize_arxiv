    "am canum venaticorum was found in a survey of faint , blue objects by @xcite .",
    "it was observed to have peculiarly broad and shallow helium absorption lines , but no hydrogen @xcite .",
    "the star was shown to be a possible ultra - compact white dwarf binary by @xcite , who discovered photometric variations on an 18-minute period ; quickly thereafter , @xcite noted that it would be a prime example of a binary whose evolution is expected to be governed by gravitational - wave radiation , and which could serve as an excellent test for the existence of gravitational radiation .",
    "the interpretation as an interacting binary analogous to the cataclysmic variables was first proposed by @xcite upon their discovery of rapid flickering in the light - curve .",
    "the discussion as to the true orbital period of the system was finally put to rest by @xcite who discovered a kinematic ` s - wave ' feature in time - resolved spectra of am cvn , thereby proving that the orbital period is 1028 seconds , while the main photometric signal at 1051 seconds is to be interpreted as a ` superhump ' .",
    "here we present phase - resolved spectra of am cvn with significantly higher spectral resolution and signal - to - noise ratio than those previously used by @xcite .",
    "moreover , our current data - set fully samples the proposed 13.37-h accretion disc precession period @xcite for the first time , allowing for a characterisation of the spectroscopic appearance of the system as a function of orbital period , precession period , and superhump ( beat ) period .",
    ".summary of our observations . [ cols= \"",
    "< , < , > , > \" , ]     our results have been corrected for the geometric effect that the ` apparent absolute magnitude ' @xcite of an accretion disc depends on the inclination . a factor",
    "@xmath3 has been taken into account as the correction from apparent absolute magnitude to absolute magnitude , where the factor @xmath4 represents the direction - averaged fraction of the disc area seen by the observer , @xmath5 .",
    "we neglect the ( unknown ) effect of limb darkening .    in converting the bolometric luminosity @xmath6 obtained from equation ( [ lacc ] ) to an absolute visual magnitude @xmath7 , the bolometric correction is of some importance .",
    "am cvn s spectral energy distribution from the far - uv to the optical ( roelofs et al .  in preparation ; see also @xcite ) indicates that it is dominated by a blackbody of @xmath8@xmath9k .",
    "this corresponds to a bc of @xmath10 , with an estimated error of @xmath11 .",
    "if we calculate the minimum temperature the accretion disc must have in order to be able to radiate away the required luminosity ( for any given @xmath12 we know the maximum radiating surface of the disc ) , we find @xmath13k for accretion rates @xmath14/yr .",
    "the bc we use is thus self - consistent with the accretion rate we derive ; in particular , it seems unlikely that we are overestimating the mass transfer rate due to an overestimate of the bc .     and",
    "@xmath7 for am cvn .",
    "our measurement of the absolute magnitude @xmath7 and its implications for the secondary mass @xmath15 are indicated by the dashed line .",
    "the open circle represents the minimum secondary mass for which the system does not eclipse ( assuming a disc that extends to the @xmath16 resonance radius ) ; the dotted line , towards larger @xmath15 and smaller @xmath7 , shows the helium - burning regime where we expect our assumptions regarding the mass - radius relation to break down ( @xmath1710% error ) .",
    "the labelled dots indicate @xmath18 in @xmath19/yr.,width=317 ]     and @xmath20 for am cvn . the upper and lower solid line represent the evolutionary tracks for semi - degenerate helium star and for cold white dwarf secondaries , respectively @xcite .",
    "the dotted line is the requirement that the secondary star fills its roche lobe .",
    "the dashed line represents our measurement of @xmath15 .",
    "the data favour a semi - degenerate helium star secondary , rather than a white dwarf.,width=317 ]    summarising , we have two independent pieces of evidence suggesting a relatively massive donor star  the large mass ratio and the large luminosity .",
    "if we compare our results to evolutionary models for helium star and white dwarf secondaries as given by @xcite , we see that our derived secondary mass is compatible with the secondary being the semi - degenerate core of a formerly helium burning star , while a ` cold ' degenerate donor star is ruled out .",
    "see figure [ mrplot ] .",
    "the secondary mass @xmath21 is close to the turn - off mass for helium burning , which lies at @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "we conclude that it is very likely that am cvn formed through an evolutionary channel in which the donor star was , upon the start of roche - lobe overflow , still burning helium .",
    "these observations thus provide the first observational evidence that the helium star evolutionary channel contributes to the am cvn population .",
    "we expect the orbit of am cvn to be circular , so that the gravitational wave polarisation amplitudes @xmath23 and @xmath24 at twice the orbital frequency , @xmath25 , become ( e.g.  @xcite ) @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the so - called chirp mass , @xmath28 is the inclination of the binary , and @xmath29 its distance . defining the strain amplitude @xmath30 and converting to more convenient solar units ,",
    "one finds @xmath31    filling in the numbers derived above gives @xmath32 .",
    "figure [ gwr ] shows the estimated strain amplitudes and frequencies of the ` known ' am cvn stars .",
    "am cvn itself is the first potential _",
    "lisa _ source which is sufficiently well - constrained that we can plot error bars with some confidence , and we see that it stands out significantly above both the instrumental design sensitivity and the estimated confusion - limited galactic background due to , mainly , detached wd  wd binaries .",
    "it is understood from numerical simulations , and it is observed in outbursting dwarf novae and nova - likes , that there exists a relation between the superhump period excess @xmath33 and the mass ratio @xmath34 of the binary .",
    "see @xcite , and references therein , for an overview including the very latest empirical work on the @xmath35 relation .",
    "in short , they conclude that for hydrogen - rich systems , @xmath36 for am cvn , this results in @xmath37 based on the photometry of @xcite . although it is unknown what the intrinsic spread in @xmath38 is , it appears from figure 9 in @xcite to be quite low , no more than about @xmath39 .",
    "this means that the @xmath38 for am cvn deviates significantly from our minimum kinematic mass ratio @xmath1 .    of course",
    ", the superhump excess @xmath33 may depend on more parameters than just the mass ratio @xmath34 ; it is quite conceivable that the helium nature of am cvn may be of influence .",
    "a recent study by @xcite indicates , for instance , quite a significant dependency of @xmath33 on the thickness of the accretion disc , where thicker discs lead to smaller superhump period excesses for a given mass ratio .",
    "if this effect should be at play , our results would suggest a physically thicker disc in am cvn compared to discs in hydrogen - rich systems of the same mass ratio .",
    "although am cvn represents only a single data point , it seems advisable to apply the empirical superhump excess ",
    "mass ratio relation with caution for such ultra - compact binaries .",
    "an obvious test would be to obtain the mass ratio in hp librae , the other known helium nova - like , and check whether it , too , shows a discrepancy with relation ( [ epsilon ] ) .      in our derivation of the minimum mass ratio @xmath1",
    ", we have assumed a maximum accretion disc radius equal to the minimum radius of the primary roche lobe .",
    "it is customary to assume a slightly more stringent limit on the maximum accretion disc radius , caused by tidal truncation of the disc .",
    "see e.g.  @xcite and references therein . for reference ,",
    "we show in figure [ truncation ] the often - used tidal truncation radius @xmath40 for an inviscid flow , which is indeed smaller than the full minimum roche lobe radius we assume . however , since this tidal truncation radius depends , in particular , on the unknown viscosity of the matter in the disc ( and increasing with viscosity ) , we have not used it as a hard upper limit to the disc s radius .",
    "interestingly , one sees that the best - fitting accretion disc radius we derive for ballistic stream velicities in the bright spot ( reproduced in figure [ truncation ] ) lies very close to , but slightly above , the tidal truncation radius ( [ truncfunc ] ) .    , but now including the tidal truncation radius ( eq .  ( [ truncfunc ] ) ) for an inviscid disc , indicated by the dot - dashed line.,width=317 ]    the effective eccentricity value @xmath2  we derive for the outermost part of the disc , from the stream  disc impact spot , is smaller than typical values @xmath41 found in numerical simulations .",
    "although the eccentricity is not one of the observables that is usually quoted in numerical studies ( the resulting superhump period excess is often the only given quantity ) , it can be inferred that the effective eccentricity we find is significantly smaller than that found by @xcite in their simulations of discs in am cvn stars .",
    "a possible explanation would be that tidal truncation , discussed in the previous paragraph , acts to circularise the disc at the outer edge to some extent by effectively removing particles from the most eccentric orbits there .",
    "this tidal truncation process is essentially a competition between viscosity transporting angular momentum outwards and tidal forces ` dissipating ' this angular momentum increasingly strongly with radius , and predictions about this tidal truncation process would thus be affected by our lack of understanding of the viscosity in accretion discs .",
    "if the central spike originates from the surface of the accreting white dwarf , in particular if it rotates with the accretor , its width puts an interesting constraint upon the accretor s spin .",
    "the central spike is unresolved in our data , and we therefore place an upper limit of @xmath4245 km / s , equal to our formal spectral resolution , on the fwhm of the feature . for the system parameters derived for am cvn , corotation with the orbit would imply a projected equatorial velocity of @xmath4236 km / s .",
    "the central spike we observe is thus consistent with a corotating primary , while significantly faster rotation is ruled out .",
    "we can estimate the tidal synchronisation timescale of the accretor from this constraint .",
    "for simplicity , we assume that am cvn has been steadily accreting matter at a rate @xmath43/yr for a long time .",
    "as long as the accretor is near corotation with the orbit , the spin - up timescale @xmath44 of the primary due to the accretion of disc matter can be written as @xmath45 where @xmath46 ( see @xcite ) is the moment of inertia factor ( @xmath47 for a solid sphere ) , and @xmath48 is the angular velocity of the accretor . requiring that tidal synchronisation proceeds on timescales similar to or shorter than the accretion - induced spin - up of the primary ,",
    "gives a maximum tidal synchronisation timescale @xmath49 yr .",
    "a key question in binary evolution theory is whether two white dwarfs , upon roche - lobe overflow at orbital periods of a few minutes , can manage to stabilise the accretion process and avoid a merger by feeding back angular momentum from the spun - up accretor to the orbit .",
    "this has profound implications for the number of systems that may survive the initial phase of mass transfer , when accretion proceeds at a high rate of @xmath50/yr @xcite .",
    "although its absolute magnitude is highly uncertain from a theoretical point of view , tidal synchronisation is understood to scale with the orbital separation and the radius of the accretor as @xmath51 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this means that , for a three - minute white dwarf binary in which roche - lobe overflow is about to commence , the tidal synchronisation timescale will be at least a factor @xmath52 shorter than for am cvn , or @xmath53 yr .",
    "this is an interesting result since it is exactly the regime that is needed for an appreciable fraction of binary white dwarf systems to survive the initial phase of mass transfer .",
    "see @xcite , in particular their figure  11 .",
    "if the central spike is thus associated with the accreting white dwarf as we think , it implies a tidal synchronisation timescale that is short enough to make the double - degenerate formation channel for am cvn stars viable @xcite .",
    "it would thereby also increase the viability of the direct - impact accretor scenario for the ultra - compact binaries rx j0806.3 + 1527 and v407 vul @xcite .",
