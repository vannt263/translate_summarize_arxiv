    "quantum turbulence  @xcite , as well as classical turbulence  @xcite , is dominated by reconnection of vortical structures which is much simpler to treat in the framework of quantum fluids rather than in viscous fluids  @xcite , while leading to similar features such as time asymmetry  @xcite . despite the fundamental differences between the two forms of turbulence , there are reasons to believe that the understanding of quantum turbulence might shed new light on the understanding of its classical counterpart  @xcite .",
    "quantum fluids dynamics is properly described by the gross  pitaevskii equation  ( gpe )  @xcite @xmath0where @xmath1 is the complex wave function . through the madelung transformation @xmath2 , equation",
    "can be viewed in classical fluid dynamical terms as @xmath3 where @xmath4 denotes density , @xmath5 velocity , @xmath6 pressure , and @xmath7 the so - called quantum stress ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "defects in the wave function @xmath1 are interpreted as infinitesimally thin vortices of constant circulation @xmath9 , with healing length @xmath10 .",
    "gpe conserves the mass and the energy @xmath11    the main reason for preferring the gpe approach to others for the study of quantum turbulence is that it guarantees a natural dynamics of interacting vortices  @xcite while resolving fine scales up to the vortex core  @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "methods based on the inviscid euler equations ( either their direct numerical simulation  @xcite or vortex filament methods  @xcite ) are unable to automatically perform vortex reconnections , being forbidden by euler dynamics .",
    "the numerical solution of the gpe   is normally carried out by employing time splitting fourier methods  @xcite and by imposing vortices in the form of singular phase defects in a unitary background density , i.e. @xmath12 when @xmath13 . however , these methods assume periodic boundary conditions .",
    "solutions which are not periodic must be mirrored in the directions lacking periodicity  @xcite , thus imposing doubling of the degrees of freedom in each of those directions and a consequent increase of the computational effort .",
    "recent developments  @xcite have shown that reconnections in quantum fluids are strictly related to topological features characterizing the interacting vortex tubes such as writhe , total torsion and intrinsic twist .",
    "these quantities depend on the fine details of the curve that describes the vortex centerline ( its third derivative with respect to the curvilinear abscissa is required for computing torsion ) and on the phase of the wavefunction @xmath1 in the neighborhood of the vortex centerline .",
    "therefore it is paramount to resort to high resolution numerical simulations of equation  , especially in the proximity of the reconnection event .    with the goal of assessing the goodness of time - splitting fourier methods for singular solutions on uniform grids versus time - splitting finite differences on nonuniform grids , we first derive an analytic approximation of a two - dimensional steady state vortex that nullifies the right - hand - side of  .",
    "then we perform a systematic comparison between the two approaches by measuring the deviation of the numerical solution from the initial condition ( being steady the initial condition should remain preserved ) .",
    "finally , we explore the possibility to evaluate the solution obtained by time - splitting fourier methods on nonuniform grids designed to guarantee higher spatial resolution in the proximity of vortex singularities .",
    "we seek a two - dimensional , steady - state solution of equation   that represents a straight vortex centered at the origin .",
    "it is well - known that the classical two - dimensional euler vortex of circulation @xmath14 has azimuthal velocity @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the radius and @xmath17 $ ] is the azimuthal angle .",
    "the cartesian components of the velocity are thus @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "therefore @xmath20 .",
    "this shows that the velocity field is solenoidal ( @xmath21 ) , that the quantum mechanical phase , @xmath22 , is simply the azimuthal angle @xmath23 , and that the quantum of circulation , in our dimensionless units , is equal to @xmath24 . in steady conditions ,",
    "the continuity equation ensures that @xmath25 , hence @xmath26 , which means that @xmath27 .",
    "the solution @xmath28 leads to @xmath29 , which has infinite energy   and must be rejected .",
    "the other possibility is that @xmath30 .",

    "that @xmath1 is the steady solution of equation  , we find that @xmath38 satisfies the equation @xmath39 with boundary conditions @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",

    "this rescaling provides denser points @xmath55 in the neighborhood of the origin , where they are mostly needed ( more than 95% of the points @xmath55 are in the interval @xmath56 ) .",

    "interestingly enough , we observe _ a posteriori _ that canceling the lower - order coefficients of @xmath83 results in very small values of the coefficients of larger powers of @xmath85 .",
    "the step - by - step derivation of @xmath78 for @xmath86 is reported in  [ sec : appendix ] , whereas tables  [ t : coeff23 ] and  [ t : coeff4 ] summarize all coefficients for the expansions @xmath87 .",

    "visual inspection confirms that @xmath69 is a poor representation of the solution of equation  , especially for @xmath88 .     and the numerical solution of   with ( equally spaced grid , second - order finite differences , 5000  points ) . ]    to appreciate quantitatively the error with respect to the numerical solution , in figure  [ fig : errrho ] we report the relative error in a semilog plot .",
    "interestingly , the relative error does not reach its maximum close to the origin , meaning that any pad approximation reproduces quite well the behavior of the vortex for @xmath89 . on the other hand ,",
    "the maximum relative error is always reached for @xmath90 , i.e. in a region of interest for the numerical simulations that we will perform .",
    "widely used schemes for the numerical simulation of the dynamics of   are the so - called time - splitting methods and the finite difference time domain methods ( see  @xcite for a review ) .",
    "if we restrict the options to second - order accurate schemes in time , time splitting pseudospectral ( tssp ) methods , time splitting finite difference ( tsfd ) methods and crank  nicolson finite difference ( cnfd ) method conserve the mass at the discretized level .",
    "however , cnfd is implicit and requires the solution of a coupled nonlinear system at each time step . for this reason we resorted to time splitting methods .",
    "we refer the reader to  @xcite for higher - order time splitting methods .    in  ( * ?",
    "* example 4.1 ) tssp is suggested when the solution is smooth and tsfd otherwise , although the hint comes from a one - dimensional numerical experiment . in what follows ,",
    "we analyze two approaches : a classical time splitting fourier method and a time splitting _ nonuniform _ finite difference method . in any case ,",
    "equation   is split into two parts    @xmath91    where @xmath92 .",
    "the solution of the first equation depends on the space chosen for the discretization and will be described in the next two sections .",

    "this is usually not a big deal when approximating smooth solutions fastly decaying to zero , since spectral order of convergence takes place . for this to happen",
    ", the unbounded domain has to be truncated to a computational bounded domain @xmath102 large enough to support the most of a periodic approximation of the solution . however , when simulating the dynamics of vortex solutions not decaying to zero , as in our case where @xmath103 , there are some issues to take into account : the low regularity of the solution at the origin , due both to @xmath104 and to @xmath105 , and lack of periodicity at the boundaries , also considering the usual extension of the computational domain and reflection of the solution ( see  @xcite ) . in fact , after such a mirroring , the solution takes the same values at opposite boundaries , but its derivatives do not .    in order to investigate the accuracy of fourier approximation for vortex solutions",
    ", we consider the fourier series expansion of the function obtained by mirroring    @xmath106    with respect to the axis @xmath107 and @xmath108 . the final computational domain is therefore @xmath109 , with @xmath110 , for which @xmath111 .",
    "the choice of the parameters @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 corresponds to a two - dimensional straight vortex as described above .",
    "different choices provide more regular functions or functions fastly decaying to zero , for which the derivatives at the boundaries are almost periodic .",

    "only the case of a regular and fast decaying to zero function ( @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 , green , upward triangles ) shows the typical spectral rate of convergence . ]    for a quite regular and periodic function , corresponding to @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 we observe in figure  [ fig : regularity ] a typical spectral rate of convergence . for any other choice of the parameters , which affects the regularity of the density ( @xmath112 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 ) , or the fast decay to zero of the function and its derivatives ( @xmath119 , @xmath113 , @xmath121 ) or the regularity of the phase ( @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath114 ) we observe a strong order reduction .",
    "the same reduction occurs for the straight vortex ( @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath121 ) .",
    "increasing the number of fourier coefficients so as to gain accuracy is often not an option .",
    "in fact , due to the necessary mirroring , this corresponds to a huge growth of the degrees of freedom .",
    "moreover , the use of hyperbolic sparse grids ( see  @xcite , for instance ) is not possible , since the possibility of discarding coefficients and grid points is given only for highly regular solutions .",
    "the low regularity of the solutions to be approximated and the needed duplication along axes in order to satisfy at least the periodicity of the values of the solutions suggest to explore the alternative of a finite difference discretization in space .",
    "the main advantage of a finite difference approach is that the mirroring of the solution is not required , being the extension of the bounded domain replaced by the imposition of homogeneous neumann boundary conditions .    given the low regularity of vortex solutions , we use centered second order finite differences . with the aim of increasing the spatial resolution around the vortex cores and keeping a reasonable degree of freedom , we employ a set of nonuniform grid points ( see  @xcite , for instance , for locally adaptive finite element discretizations ) .    the discretization of the laplace operator in one dimension with nonuniform finite differences on @xmath122 points provides the nonsymmetric matrix @xmath123 0 & \\ldots & 0 & \\frac{2}{h_{m-1}^2 } & -\\frac{2}{h_{m-1}^2 } \\end{bmatrix}\\ ] ] where @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 .",
    "this is not exactly a second order approximation , although a discretization in which @xmath127 and a refinement with @xmath128 yields a first order term in the error decaying faster than the second order term ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "the approximation for the two - dimensional and the three - dimensional cases can be simply obtained by kronecker products with the identity matrix .",
    "if we call @xmath129 the corresponding matrix , equation   is transformed into the system of ordinary differential equations @xmath130    given the importance of the mass preservation , we investigate this issue for the numerical solution of system  . a quadrature formula with positive weights for the computation of the mass writes @xmath131 it can be written as @xmath132 where @xmath133 denotes the transposed conjugate vector of @xmath134 and @xmath135 the matrix with diagonal @xmath136 .",
    "we define @xmath137 such that @xmath138 with @xmath139 . if @xmath140 is _ symmetric _",
    ", then the solution @xmath141 is an orthogonal matrix and @xmath142 this means that @xmath143 and therefore system   preserves the mass at the discrete level if @xmath135 makes @xmath140 symmetric . from the structure of the matrix @xmath144 , it is clear that the vector of trapezoidal weights @xmath145 $ ] gives a matrix @xmath146 such that @xmath147 is symmetric .",
    "the extension to @xmath135 in the two - dimensional and three - dimensional cases is trivial and this is enough to get @xmath140 symmetric as well , in fact @xmath148 .",
    "we conclude that equation   preserves the mass at the discrete level whenever the trapezoidal rule is used as quadrature formula and this is easily extended to any space dimension .",
    "system   could be solved , for instance , by the crank  nicolson scheme @xmath149 which preserves the discrete mass being @xmath140 symmetric ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "this scheme is second order accurate in time , therefore the size of the time step @xmath150 has to be chosen such that the error is smaller than the time splitting error .",
    "moreover , crank  nicolson scheme requires the solution of a linear system of equations with matrix @xmath151 at each time step @xmath150 . although this is not a big deal in one space dimension , since the matrix is tridiagonal , in higher dimensions the discretization yields a large , sparse , complex symmetric matrix .",
    "this implies the use of preconditioned krylov solvers for general matrices such as gmres or bicgstab or minimal residual methods for complex symmetric systems ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "iterative methods converge to the solution up to a specified tolerance which therefore influences the mass conservation and the whole accuracy of the result . given these complications ,",
    "we prefer to consider a direct approximation of the exact solution @xmath152 nowadays there are several options for the computation of the action of the matrix exponential to a vector .",
    "we refer to  @xcite for a review of _ polynomial _ methods which do not require the solution of linear systems . in this way ,",
    "the kinetic linear part   is solved exactly in time , as in the fourier spectral method .",
    "in section  [ sec : pade ] we have derived various approximations of @xmath60 for a straight , two - dimensional vortex , whose wavefunction is @xmath153 . in order to quantitatively",
    "compare the two methods introduced in section  [ sec : splitting ] , we measure the preservation of such a steady solution by reporting the relative error @xmath154 with @xmath155 , where @xmath156 is either @xmath157 or @xmath158 , the latter evaluated at any required @xmath85 by linear interpolation of  . the origin is excluded since @xmath159 is zero therein .",

    "the maximum over the continuum set @xmath164 in the error above is approximated by the maximum over a discrete set which will be specified later .",
    "although the preservation of the initial state may seem a trivial test , it is in fact a reliable and necessary experiment in order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed numerical methods .",
    "thanks to the reliability of the analytic solution , this test can show the influence of both the spatial approximation and the time splitting error in the numerical discretization of the pde  .    in",
    "what follows we will employ either tssp ( fourier ) or tsfd . for a computational grid with @xmath165 grid points in the physical domain of interest",

    "the number of fourier modes is fixed to @xmath170 , i.e. @xmath171 degrees of freedom .",
    "we compare the solution at each time step with the initial condition on the grid nodes within the considered disk .",
    "the worst approximation of the steady - state solution is the commonly used @xmath172 pad approximation , whereas @xmath173 turns out to be as accurate as the numerical solution .",
    "for this reason , in the following experiments we will consider only @xmath173 .",
    "all curves collapse on each other in the case of the largest disk , meaning that the maximum error occurs at the boundaries , mainly due to the non - periodicity of the solution .",
    "+      we compare the performance of the finite difference approximation on a uniform versus nonuniform grid .",
    "the uniform grid has the same step - size @xmath174 as the grid employed for the fourier approach and reported in figure  [ fig : diffic ] .",
    "the nonuniform grid is generated by taking into account different constraints . given the smallest step - size @xmath175 at the origin ( in the vortex core ) , we linearly increase the step - size according to @xmath127 in both @xmath95 and @xmath176 and in both positive and negative directions .",

    "the number of points of the nonuniform grid is chosen such that the mean value of @xmath180 equals the step - size of the uniform grid .",
    "these constraints guarantee a reasonable nonuniform grid .",
    "the comparison between the uniform and nonuniform grids is shown in figure  [ fig : univsnon ] . in all cases",
    "the initial condition is @xmath173 , thus the error for the uniform grid can be compared directly with that in figure  [ fig : diffic ] for the case of pad approximation with @xmath181 ( red squares in both figures ) .",
    "we first focus on the results with the same number of points and the same boundaries , i.e. red squares and blue circles in figure  [ fig : univsnon ] .",
    "the discrete mass variation along time integration is comparable and of order @xmath182 .",
    "this confirms the conservation of mass also for the case of nonuniform grid , as discussed in section  [ sec : tsfd ] . in the nonuniform case",
    "the error is roughly one order of magnitude smaller than in the uniform case on small disks and for @xmath183 not too large , whereas the curve of the nonuniform case tends to jump onto the uniform one after a certain time as the radius of the disk of interest increases .",
    "this suggests the idea that the error arises at the boundaries , where @xmath184 does not exactly fulfill neumann boundary conditions .",
    "motivated by this , we have changed the boundaries from @xmath110 to @xmath185 and @xmath186 to check the dependency of the error on the choice of the truncated domain . in doing so ,",
    "we have preserved the constraints on the nonuniform grids discussed above , obtaining @xmath187 degrees of freedom for @xmath186 ( upward green triangles ) and @xmath188 degrees of freedom for @xmath185 ( downward black triangles ) . with reference to figure  [ fig : univsnon ] ,",
    "the domain bounded at @xmath186 is clearly too small and the error is always very large compared to all the other cases . on the other hand , the curves for @xmath110 ( blue circles ) and @xmath185 ( downward black triangles ) behave roughly in the same way up to a certain value of @xmath183 , after which the case @xmath110 consistently show larger errors than the case @xmath185 .",
    "this reinforces the claim that the error arises from the borders .",
    "now we concentrate on our main goal , which is the comparison between tssp with fourier basis function on uniform grids and tsfd on a nonuniform grid that we fix to @xmath189 , @xmath110 , @xmath190 . in order to compare the error defined by   for the two methods",
    ", we always evaluate the tssp solution on the nonuniform grid points ( spectral solutions can be evaluated everywhere ) .",
    "this set of points has the advantage of being denser in the vortex core , where higher spatial resolution is desirable .",
    "results are reported in figure  [ fig : tsfdvstssp ] , where sp stands for spectral and nfd for nonuniform finite differences .         keeping in mind that the spectral fourier approach needs mirroring , i.e.",
    "the number of modes in each direction must be doubled , we first choose a number of fourier modes @xmath170 in each direction to make it equal to the number of points of the reference case for nonuniform finite differences ( @xmath190 ) in the physical ( un - mirrored ) domain .",
    "the overall behavior of the error for these two cases is comparable : tssp ( red squares ) performs better than tsfd ( blue circles ) for small values of @xmath183 , whereas the opposite happens for intermediate values of @xmath183 . for large @xmath183 the two curves collapse on each other .    due to the fact that tssp needs mirroring , i.e. @xmath191 , in figure  [ fig : tsfdvstssp ]",
    "we explore also the cases with less fourier modes , namely @xmath192 ( upward green triangles ) and @xmath193 ( downward black triangles ) .",
    "as observed for the case @xmath170 , in the long term all curves seem to provide similar errors , regardless of the disk radius . on the other hand , for small values of @xmath183 ,",
    "the number of degrees of freedom plays a rle in that a larger number of fourier modes ensures smaller errors .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that , for what seen in figure  [ fig : regularity ] , the tssp fourier approach does not retain the spectral accuracy because of the singular nature of the solution at the origin and the lack of periodicity at the boundaries .    as a final remark ,",
    "we observe that the error of the fourier solution computed on its own uniform grid , reported in figure  [ fig : diffic ] with red squares , is smaller than the error of the fourier solution evaluated on the nonuniform grid , reported in figure  [ fig : tsfdvstssp ] with red squares .",
    "as expected , from figure  [ fig : tsfdvstssp ] we have seen that the smaller the number of fourier modes , the larger the relative error with respect to the initial condition .",
    "we wish to check if there exists an upper limit to the maximum resolution of fourier spectral method . for doing so",
    ", we increase the number of fourier modes and , proportionally , the number of time steps as suggested in  @xcite .",
    "results are shown in figure  [ fig : maxrestssp ] .",
    "we observe high accuracy in the core ( see smaller disk , left plot ) for small values of @xmath183 , immediately followed by saturation . in a larger disk ( right plot ) , saturation kicks in almost immediately .",
    "the errors reported in figure  [ fig : maxrestssp ] suggest that @xmath170 is a reasonable value of fourier modes for the preservation of a two - dimensional quantum vortex .",

    "[ fig : tsspcoll ] we compare the reasonable case @xmath192 , for which the number of modes is relatively small , but not too small , with different nonuniform grids .",
    "we notice that the numerical integration itself is carried out only once and the fourier coefficients of the solution are stored at each time step .",
    "the evaluation at the grid points is performed afterward , in the post - processing stage , as many times as desired . moreover , tools like the nonuniform fast fourier transform ( nfft , see  @xcite ) can be employed for the fast evaluation of trigonometric polynomials at arbitrary point sets .",
    "the constant spatial step - size of the tssp method is @xmath194 , whereas @xmath195 stands for the minimum value of the step - size , in the proximity of the origin , for the nonuniform grids . as seen before",
    ", there is a substantial difference in the error only for @xmath196 , whereas for larger values of @xmath183 evaluating the fourier solution on a nonuniform grid does not worsen the solution .",
    "it is important to note that vortex reconnections , usually , require a dynamics that takes a time of at least @xmath197 .",
    "evaluating a tssp solution on a locally refined grid is , thus , a very promising approach to study quantum vortex reconnections .",
    "after deriving a new accurate pad approximation for the density distribution of a two - dimensional steady - state vortex , we have used it as the initial condition for the gross  pitaevskii equation to test the performance of the time - splitting fourier method .",
    "although it can not retain its classical spectral accuracy in space , being as accurate as low - order finite difference on nonuniform grids , it preserves quite well the steady - state solution , especially in the neighborhood of the singularity .",
    "the advantage of a post - processing evaluation on arbitrary points makes this approach suited for applications where _ local _ high resolution is required .",
