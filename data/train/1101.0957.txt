    "it is worth noting that wronskians containing @xmath38 and @xmath39 are constant for @xmath40 and those with @xmath41 and @xmath42 are constant for @xmath43 .",

    "note that the application of the numerical integration method is straightforward because all the functions @xmath13 and @xmath14 are real .",

    "[ fig : wronskians ] we appreciate that the wronskians approach constants as @xmath83 and that @xmath84 is large enough for an accurate estimation of those limits .",
    "we thus calculated the transmission coefficients shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : twg ] for three values of @xmath85 . as expected there is tunneling for all @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "it is clear that the oscillatory behavior of @xmath88 found by chalk@xcite is due to the truncation of the gaussian potential with the purpose of connecting the power  series solution for the intermediate region with the asymptotic plane waves@xcite .",
    "we appreciate that the necessary truncation of the integration interval does not produce any undesirable effect on the transmission probabilities calculated in terms of wronskians .",
    "in fact , the great advantage of the wronskian method is that we calculate the constant asymptotic limit of each wronskian with a given desired accuracy as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wronskians ] .    in passing we point out that there is no trace of the questionable tunneling condition derived by nandi@xcite for the gaussia barrier .",
    "another simple , nontrivial , and most interesting problem is the gaussian well @xmath89 proceeding as in the preceding example we obtain the dimensionless potential @xmath90 and the same expressions for @xmath85 and @xmath7 . in this case",
    "it is most instructive to calculate the transmission probability @xmath91 in terms of @xmath85 for fixed values of @xmath7 in order to reveal the scattering resonances as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : twgw ] .",
    "note that the maxima of the transmission probability @xmath92 that occur at some particular values of @xmath85 are roughly independent of the energy @xmath93 .",
    "this well known phenomenon is better understood by means of an exactly solvable model .",
    "the scattering resonances appearing in fig .",
    "[ fig : twgw ] are similar to the ones exhibited by the exactly solvable well @xmath94 that we easily transform into the dimensionless potential @xmath95 .",
    "both the dimensionless potential parameter @xmath85 and energy @xmath7 have the same expressions as in the preceding examples .",
    "in this case the transmission probability reads@xcite @xmath96 the family of curves @xmath91 vs. @xmath85 for constant @xmath7 resembles the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : twgw ] .",
    "note that there is full transmission @xmath92 when @xmath97 ; that is to say , when @xmath98 is an integer . in order to understand the origin of these resonances we pay attention to the bound states@xcite @xmath99 we appreciate that full transmission takes place when one of the excited bound ",
    "state energies ( @xmath100 ) lies exactly at the rim of the well @xmath101 in which case @xmath102 ( the ground  state energy @xmath103 is negative for all @xmath104 ) .",
    "this exactly solvable problem also proved to be useful for testing the accuracy of our programs for the calculation of the transmission probability .",
    "in this paper we propose an alternative way of approaching quantum scattering in one dimension .",
    "we think that the method based on the wronskians between linearly independent solutions to the schrdinger equation is preferable to other approaches .",
    "the relatively light effort necessary to master a few mathematical properties of the wronskians pays generously when attacking the scattering problem either analytically or numerically . in this paper",
    "we focused mainly on the latter because we are interested in nontrivial problems that are not so widely discussed in most textbooks on quantum mechanics@xcite .",
    "the derivation of all the necessary scattering equations in terms of wronskians is straightforward as well as their practical application by means of extremely simple computer programs .",
    "the calculation of the transmission probability is quite reliable if one simply checks for constant wronskians before truncating the propagation of the solutions towards left and right in the numerical integration routine .",
    "thus , the error due to a finite integration interval is simply the error in the lack of constant wronskians that is easily bounded to the desired accuracy . in this way",
    "we avoid any spurious oscillations in the transmission probability as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : tunneling ] .",
    "in addition to all that , the wronskians have proved to be most useful for the estimation of the complex energies that describe tunnel resonances as discussed in the paper on which we based present pedagogical presentation@xcite .",
    "one can also apply the wronskian method to bound states and calculate their energies by simply taking into account the appropriate asymptotic behavior of the wavefunction and requiring that it be square integrable .",
    "it is clear that the approach exhibits a wide variety of useful applications and for that reason we think that it is worth teaching in advanced undergraduate or graduate courses on quantum mechanics .",
    "in order to make this paper sufficiently self  contained in this appendix we outline some well known results about the wronskians that are useful for the study of ordinary differential equations in general@xcite and also for the treatment of the schrdinger equation in particular@xcite . to this end",
    ", we consider the ordinary second  order differential equation @xmath105 if @xmath106 and @xmath107 are two linearly independent solutions to this equation then we have @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the wronskian ( or wronskian determinant@xcite ) .",
    "two obvious properties are : @xmath110    by linear combination of @xmath111 and @xmath112 we easily obtain two new solutions @xmath113 and @xmath114 satisfying @xmath115 at a given point @xmath17 so that @xmath116 for all @xmath117 .",
