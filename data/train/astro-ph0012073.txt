    "grs 1915 + 105 is the prototypical microquasar , a galactic x - ray binary ejecting plasma clouds at v@xmath00.92c ( mirabel & rodriguez 1994 ) .",
    "three different sources of infrared ( ir ) radiation are expected from a x - ray binary , namely thermal emission from the outer part of accretion disk , thermal emission from the companion star or synchrotron emission from the jet(s ) .",
    "previous ir observations of grs 1915 + 105 include , besides a few single measurements since 1993 , some few hrs photometry in conjunction with x - ray / radio measurements ( eikenberry  2000 ) , and a 2 month monitoring in 1996 ( bandyopadhyay  1998 ) .",
    "k band observations have been performed with the 1.55-m telescope of the us naval observatory flagstaff equipped with the 256@xmath1256 pixel hgcdte ircam camera during 810 day intervals around full moon . because the main interest was in the long - term behaviour , `` only '' about 13 observations per month were done , consisting of groups of 3 or 4 individual observations per night .",
    "each group represents a set of coadded integrations with an exposure of 400 sec . in total , observations were performed on 34 nights between 05 may 1999 and 15 jun 2000 .",
    "these observations show grs 1915 + 105 to be variable between 12.1  k  13.7 mag ( not extinction - corrected ; fig .",
    "1 ) . our long coverage allows to search for correlations with other emission characteristics , e.g. the rxte all - sky monitor ( asm ) quick - look results provided by the asm / rxte team . after selecting those k band observations which were done within 4 hrs of an asm scan",
    ", we find that both the x - ray flux as well as the x - ray hardness ratio ( flux ratio of 512 kev vs. 35 kev band ) are positively correlated with the k band flux .",
    "a regression analysis suggests that a doubling of the x - ray count rate ( flux ) leads to a 33% increase in the k band flux .",
    "this argues against an explanation due to illumination of the secondary .",
    "instead , it rather could be synchrotron radiation related to ( small ) ejections / flares as seen also at shorter time scales ( eikenberry  2000 ) . in this picture",
    "the correlation of the k band flux with the x - ray hardness ratio is compatible with the correlation of x - ray spectral slope and radio flux found by rau & greiner ( 2001 ) . a large ( small ) value of the hardness ratio corresponds to a flat ( steep ) x - ray power law slope , and therefore a high ( low ) temperature of the electrons in the corona if the general comptonization paradigm is adopted .",
    "these correlations then imply that strong k band flux and weak radio flux occur during times of a flat x - ray power law , i.e. most of the synchrotron power is radiated either in the infrared or radio band depending only on the temperature of electrons in the corona ."
