    "<S> we study the numerical resolution of the time - dependent gross - pitaevskii equation , a non - linear schrdinger equation used to simulate the dynamics of bose - einstein condensates . considering condensates trapped in harmonic potentials , we present an efficient algorithm by making use of a spectral galerkin method , using a basis set of harmonic oscillator functions , and the gauss - hermite quadrature . we apply this algorithm to the simulation of condensate breathing and scissors modes . </S>"
