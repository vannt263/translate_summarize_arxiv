    "e.g. _ , the average hadron multiplicities in events with heavy particle production , or the probability for hard diffractive events with large rapidity gaps .",
    "these problems require knowledge also of the transverse spatial distribution of partons in the initial state ( including its dependence on flavor and spin ) , as well as parton ",

    "such measurements at fnal and hera have provided a rather detailed picture of the transverse spatial distribution of gluons down to momentum fractions of the order @xmath8 . in particular ,",
    "these results have shown that the transverse area occupied by partons with @xmath2 is _ much smaller _ than the transverse size of the proton in generic inelastic @xmath9 collisions at high energies .",
    "since the latter size rises rapidly with energy , the difference between the two transverse areas , which is already significant at tevatron energies , is expected to become even more pronounced at lhc .",
    "one is dealing with an `` onion  like '' transverse structure of the nucleon , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_onion ] .",
    "this two  scale picture is the key to understanding the properties of the hadronic final state in @xmath0 events with hard processes at lhc .",
    "first , the two  scale picture of fig .  [ fig_onion ] implies a classification of @xmath9 events in `` central '' ( areas of large@xmath10 partons overlap ) and `` generic '' ones ( areas of large@xmath10 partons need not overlap ) .",
    "the `` generic '' collisions give the dominant contribution to the overall inelastic cross section .",
    "hard processes such as heavy particle production will practically only happen in `` central '' collisions @xcite .",
    "a new phenomenon expected at lhc is the approach to the `` black body limit '' of strong interactions due to the interactions of large@xmath10 partons with the strong small@xmath10 gluon field in the other proton .",
    "this has profound consequences for the pattern of hadron production , in particular in the forward / backward rapidity region .",
    "these strong interaction effects need to be understood in order to reliably identify signals due to new particles .",
    "second , the two  scale picture of the transverse structure of the nucleon can be applied to diffractive processes in @xmath0 scattering , in which the particles produced in the hard process are separated from the rest by rapidity gaps .",
    "one example is the diffractive dissociation of one of the protons into three jets , @xmath11 .",
    "this process proceeds from small  size configurations in the dissociating proton , and is the analogue of the diffractive two  jet dissociation of pions in @xmath12 collisions .",
    "in particular , measurements of such processes will allow to investigate whether the fast increase with energy of the gluon density in the nucleon , predicted by dglap evolution in qcd and observed at hera , will slow down as suggested by various resummation approaches @xcite .",
    "another example is the exclusive diffractive production of heavy particles , @xmath13 , which is being discussed as a candidate for the higgs search at lhc @xcite . here ,",
    "the requirement that soft interactions between the spectator systems preserve the rapidity gaps results in a suppression of the cross section compared to the non - diffractive case , which can be estimated using information from @xmath0 elastic scattering .",
    "the same applies to inclusive diffractive processes , @xmath14 or @xmath15 .",
    "information about the spatial distribution of partons in the transverse plane comes from studies of hard exclusive processes in @xmath1 scattering , in particular the electroproduction of light vector mesons ( @xmath16 ) at large @xmath17 , and the photoproduction of heavy quarkonia ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "these processes probe the generalized parton distributions in the nucleon .",
    "the extensive data on vector meson production at hera ( for a review , see ref.@xcite ) support the dominance of the partonic mechanism .",
    "in particular , they confirm a qualitative prediction of qcd factorization  the convergence of the @xmath7slope of @xmath19 meson electroproduction at large @xmath17 to the slope of @xmath20 photo / electroproduction @xcite , see fig .  [ fig_levy ] .",
    "numerical calculations , accounting for the finite transverse size of the wave function of the produced vector meson , explain the key features of the high@xmath17 data @xcite .",
    "the @xmath7dependence of the cross section for @xmath20 photo / electroproduction is given ( up to small corrections ) by the square of the `` two  gluon form factor '' of the nucleon @xcite , @xmath21 ^ 2 , \\hspace{4em } x \\ , \\sim \\ , m_{\\bar c c}^2 / w^2 .\\ ] ] the two  dimensional fourier transform of this function , @xmath22 describes the spatial distribution of gluons with momentum fraction @xmath10 in the transverse plane [ the distribution is normalized as @xmath23 .",

    "the experimentally observed increase of the slope between @xmath27 and @xmath28 can be explained by contributions of the nucleon s pion cloud to the gluon distribution at transverse distances @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "this effect , as well as the subsequent slow increase of the slope at smaller @xmath10 , and the small effects of dglap evolution , are incorporated by way of an @xmath10 and @xmath17dependence of the dipole mass parameter , see refs .",

    "a crucial observation is that the transverse area occupied by partons with significant momentum fraction , @xmath2 , is much smaller than the size of the nucleon as it appears in generic inelastic @xmath0 collisions at high energies .",
    "this can qualitatively be understood in gribov s picture of the partonic wave function of the nucleon , which allows for a unified description of electromagnetic and strong interactions at high energies @xcite . in this picture , the @xmath0 cross section is dominated by collisions of `` soft '' partons ( very small @xmath10 ) , which are the result of successive decays of the `` hard '' partons at large @xmath10 .",
    "this decay process has the character of a random walk in the transverse plane ( `` gribov diffusion '' ) .",
    "each decay process results in a shift of the transverse position inversely proportional to the transverse momentum in the decay vertex , @xmath30 . due to the randomness of the emissions , and the constant degrading of the longitudinal momentum",
    ", one finds that @xmath31 successive decays result in an overall increase of the transverse area of @xmath32 the transverse area occupied by soft partons thus grows linearly with @xmath33 . for hard partons",
    "the growth of the transverse area with the collision energy is much weaker , due to the smaller scale of the random shifts in impact parameter space .",
    "in addition , the transverse area occupied by the hard partons at large @xmath10 is already small .",
    "this leads to the appearance of two widely separated transverse area scales in @xmath0 collisions at high energies ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_onion ] )  a small transverse area occupied by hard partons , and a much larger area occupied by soft partons .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     our estimates show that in @xmath0 collisions at lhc the leading partons acquire substantial transverse momenta due to `` black interactions '' with the small@xmath34 gluons in the other proton .",
    "a much weaker effect is found at the tevatron energy .",
    "the origin of this difference is the increase in the gluon density due to the decrease of @xmath34 between tevatron and lhc energies , _ cf . _",
    "( [ x_resolved ] ) .",
    "this indicates that the final state characteristics of central @xmath0 collisions at lhc will be substantially different from what one expects from the extrapolation of tevatron results , see section  [ sec_final ] .",
    "finally , the large values of the critical transverse momentum for `` black interactions '' of leading partons at lhc confirm our assessment of section  [ sec_hardblack ] , that the probability for two nucleons at lhc energies not to interact inelastically at small impact parameters is very small .",
    "in central @xmath0 collisions the leading partons acquire large transverse momenta , @xmath35 , due to the approach to the black body limit . as a result",
    ", particle production at forward / backward rapidities will largely be dominated by incoherent parton fragmentation .",
    "one thus expects the following modifications compared to generic inelastic collisions :    * strong suppression of leading particles , in particular nucleons ( for @xmath36 the differential multiplicity of pions should exceed that of nucleons ) * average transverse momenta of the leading particles @xmath37 * no correlations between the transverse momenta of leading hadrons ( some correlations will remain , however , because two partons produced in collisions of large@xmath38 and small@xmath34 partons may end up at similar rapidities ) * a large fraction of events with no particles with @xmath39 in both fragmentation regions ( emergence of long  range rapidity correlations ) , and large energy release at rapidities @xmath40 .    another effect of the multiple scattering of large@xmath38 partons with small@xmath34 gluons in the other proton is the shift of a large number of small@xmath34 gluons to larger rapidities ( `` holes '' ) .",
    "this amounts to the creation of a substantial amount of color charge , and should result in an increase of soft particle multiplicities over a broad range of rapidities ( albeit much smaller than if the particles originated from independent fragmentation ) .",
    "such an increase should in fact be present already at tevatron energies , in events with a trigger on two  jet or @xmath41 production .",
    "an increase of the multiplicity at rapidities @xmath42 was indeed observed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which investigated the correlation of the underlying event structure with the presence of such a trigger .",
    "it is important to extend these studies to higher rapidities .    to summarize , in @xmath0 collisions at lhc new particles",
    "will be produced in a much more `` violent '' strong  interaction environment than one would expect from the extrapolation of the properties of minimum bias events at the tevatron .",
    "even the extrapolation of properties of hard dijet events should not be smooth , as the transverse momenta acquired by leading partons are estimated to be substantially larger at lhc than at tevatron , see figs .",

    "lhc will offer an opportunity to study a variety of hard diffractive processes in @xmath0 and @xmath43 scattering .",
    "one interesting aspect of such processes is that they allow to probe rare small  size configurations in the nucleon wave function .",

    "is again suppressed compared to the naive estimate based on the diffractive parton densities of the proton measured in @xmath1 scattering at hera . as in the case of exclusive diffractive higgs production ,",
