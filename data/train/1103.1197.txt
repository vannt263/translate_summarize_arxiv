    "a candidate model for new physics is the @xmath4 supergravity grand unified model  @xcite which with universal boundary conditions for soft breaking at the unification scale is the model msugra  @xcite ( for reviews see  @xcite ) defined by the parameter space @xmath5 and the sign of @xmath3 , as well as @xmath6 and @xmath7 where @xmath6 is the grand unification scale and @xmath7 is the common value of @xmath8 ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 is gauge coupling ) for the gauge groups @xmath11 at the unification scale .",
    "this model has recently been investigated at the lhc with r parity conservation , and constraints on the model have been set with 35 pb@xmath0 of data by the cms and atlas collaborations @xcite .",
    "these works , therefore , produce the first direct constraints on supergravity unified models at the lhc . indeed the recent results of cms and atlas @xcite are encouraging as they report to surpass the parameter space probed in previous @xcite direct searches by lep and by the tevatron .    in this work",
    "we explore and interpret further the recent data from the lhc in the framework of msugra . in our analysis",
    "we follow the techniques developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and we study the parameter space under full simulation of the 7 tev standard model backgrounds @xcite . the atlas analysis produces a reach which is more stringent that the one from cms and thus in our analysis we utilize the cuts used by atlas . for the case @xmath12 and @xmath13 our results are in conformity with the atlas results but we explore other regions of the parameter space in @xmath14 plane and discuss the reach plots for these",
    ". we also carry out a detailed comparison of the constraints arising from the cms and atlas reach plots  @xcite vs the constraints arising from the higgs mass lower limits , from flavor physics and specifically from @xmath15 experimental bounds , and from the wmap relic density constraints on dark matter .",
    "the atlas collaboration has released two analyses , one with @xmath17  lepton  @xcite and the other with @xmath18  leptons  @xcite  both of which are considered in our analysis . for the @xmath17  lepton analysis",
    "we follow the selection requirements that atlas reports in @xcite .",
    "the preselection requirements for events are that a jet must have @xmath19 and @xmath20 , electrons must have @xmath19 and @xmath21 and muons must have @xmath19 and @xmath22 .",
    "further , we veto the  medium \" electrons in the electromagnetic calorimeter transition region , @xmath23 .",
    "an event is considered if it has a single lepton with @xmath19 and its three hardest jets have @xmath24 , with the leading jet having @xmath25 .",
    "the distance , @xmath26 , between each jet with the lepton must satisfy @xmath27 , and events are rejected if the reconstructed missing energy , @xmath28 , points in the direction of any of the three leading jets , @xmath29 .",
    "events are then classified into @xmath30 channels , depending on whether the lepton is a muon or an electron .",
    "these are then further classified into four regions based on the missing energy and @xmath31 cuts , where we reconstruct the missing transverse momentum using the selected lepton plus jets with @xmath19 and @xmath32 following atlas analysis , and @xmath33 is the transverse mass between the lepton and the missing transverse momentum vector .",
    "the four regions alluded to above are labeled the  signal region \" , the `` top region '' , the `` w region '' and the `` qcd region '' . for the  signal region \" events",
    "were required to pass the additional cuts of @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 . here",
    "the effective mass , @xmath38 , is the scalar sum of the missing energy with the @xmath39 s of the selected visible objects ( in this case the lepton and the @xmath40  jets ) . the number of events were then compared to the @xmath41 upper bounds that atlas found ( @xmath42  events and @xmath43  events )  @xcite .",
    "the  top region \" and  w region \" are defined by events with @xmath44 and @xmath45 , where the `` top region '' requires at least one of the three hardest jets to be @xmath46-tagged and the `` w region '' requires none of the three hardest jets to be @xmath46-tagged .",
    "the  qcd region \" was required to have @xmath47 and was purely data driven . for our analysis events",
    "were rejected if they contaminated the three control regions . using the standard model background from @xcite we reproduced the atlas results .        for the @xmath18  lepton analysis we follow the selection requirements that atlas reports in  @xcite where the pre - event selection is the same as for the @xmath17  lepton case except that leptons are identified to have @xmath48 .",
    "here the events are classified into 4 regions  a \" ,  b \" ,  c \" and  d \" ; where regions a and b have at least @xmath30  jets and regions c and d have at least @xmath40  jets . when referring to different cuts in these regions we define cuts on the  selected \" jets to mean that the bare minimum number of jets in this region must satisfy the following requirement : for regions a and b  selected \" jets mean that they are the first two hardest jets and for regions c and d  selected \" jets mean that they are the first three hardest jets .",
    "events are required to have @xmath49 and the selected jets must each have @xmath50 with the leading jet @xmath51 . as in the case with @xmath17  lepton , events are rejected if the missing energy points in the direction of any of the selected jets , @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is over the selected jets .",
    "region a requires events to have @xmath54 and @xmath37 and regions c and d require events to have @xmath36 with region c requiring @xmath37 and region d requiring @xmath55 . in this case",
    "@xmath38 is defined in terms of selected jets , i.e. for regions a and b it is the scalar sum of the first two hardest jets and for regions c and d it is the scalar sum of the first three hardest jets . for the analysis here",
    "we do not apply the cut for region b , i.e. @xmath56 , since the models excluded in this region are already excluded in region d  @xcite .    following the framework of the atlas collaboration",
    "@xcite we have carried out a set of three parameter sweeps in the @xmath57 plane taking @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "two of the parameter sweeps were a @xmath60 grid scan in the @xmath57 plane having a fixed universal trilinear parameter , @xmath12 , and fixed @xmath2 ; one set with @xmath13 and the other with @xmath61 .",
    "a third parameter scan was done with @xmath62 and @xmath63 . throughout the analysis",
    "we take @xmath64 and @xmath65 . for the simulation of the msugra models , renormalization group evolution and computation of the physical masses of the sparticles",
    "was performed using suspect  @xcite and we implement both madgraph and pythia for event generation @xcite .",
    "a comparison of our reach to the reach done by the atlas collaboration is shown in fig.([atlas1 ] ) .          in figure  [ atlasex ]",
    "we plot the number of signal events for electrons in the @xmath57 plane where the reach plot from atlas is also exhibited and where the atlas reach plot corresponds to the number of observed events and those that have a larger number predicted by the model .",
    "for the 1 lepton analysis , we first present the models excluded by the muon channel , colored by @xmath66 ( indicated by squares ) .",
    "next , we overlay from the remaining models , those that have been excluded by the electron channel , and colored by @xmath67 ( indicated by diamonds ) . similarly for the 0 lepton analysis , we begin with models excluded by channel a , colored by @xmath68 ( indicated by squares ) ; overlay models excluded by c ( but not a ) and colored by @xmath69 ( indicated by diamonds ) .",
    "next , we overlay models excluded by channel d alone in a single color ( stars ) , as @xmath70 are not comparable with @xmath68 or @xmath69 .",
    "we also show the number of signal events for electrons in the @xmath71 plane . an atlas reach curve is also exhibited .",
    "the upper left panel of fig.([atlasex ] ) gives us a more quantitative description of the electron and muon channels in putting constraints on the @xmath57 parameter space with @xmath72 pb@xmath0 of data . as expected the largest number of single @xmath73 and @xmath3 events arise at low mass scales , i.e. , for low values of @xmath74 and of @xmath75 and the number of signal events decrease and we approach the boundary after which they fall below 2 for the 1 lepton atlas analysis .",
    "it is also instructive to examine the signal events in the gluino - squark mass plane where the squark mass corresponds to the average first two generation squark mass .",
    "this is done in the upper right panel of fig.([atlasex ] ) . here",
    "the polygon shape of the region is a simple mapping of the allowed parameter in the @xmath57 plane of the upper left panel .",
    "the plot is useful as it directly correlates squark and gluino model points that are either excluded or allowed by the 1 lepton atlas analysis .",
    "the 0 lepton analysis of the lower panels in fig.([atlasex ] ) is very similar to the analysis of the upper panels except for different array of cuts .",
    "there is a general consistency in the analysis of the 1 lepton and the 0 lepton analysis , although the 0 lepton cuts appear more constraining as they appear to exclude a somewhat larger region of the parameter space . together the analysis of the upper and lower panels of fig.([atlasex ] ) gives us a more analytical understanding of the relative strengths of the 1 lepton and 0 lepton cuts .",
    "in the analysis of the reach plots experimental constraints were not imposed beyond those that arise from the atlas analyses .",
    "next we include these constraints and in our analysis we will consider the larger parameter space when all four parameters @xmath76 are varied . in doing so , we apply various constraints from searches on the sparticle mass limits , b - physics and from @xmath77 .",
    "next we explore the constraint from upper bound on the relic density from wmap only , and then with combination of all of the above .",
    "these indirect constraints were calculated using micromegas  @xcite , with the standard model contribution in the @xmath78 corrected using the nnlo analysis of misiak  _ et al_.  @xcite .",
    "we now describe this more general analysis . in the upper left panel of fig.([total ] ) we apply the following  collider / flavor constraints \" @xcite @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 , along with @xmath83 , see  @xcite , @xmath84 ( 90 % c.l . )",
    "@xcite , and @xmath85  @xcite .",
    "these collider / flavor constraints by themselves have an effect , but the effect is quite small in terms of reducing the density of models that are already constrained by the atlas results .",
    "we note that our scans of the parameter are very dense with 10@xmath86 models after ewsb alone . in the @xmath87 plane",
    "the collider / flavor cuts eliminate 12  % of the models . however",
    "because @xmath1 and @xmath88 are not fixed to specific values , but are allowed to run over their full natural ranges , a model point which is eliminated for say , large @xmath88 by @xmath89 or @xmath90 at a specific point in the @xmath87 plane can correspond to a model point with a smaller value of @xmath2 for the same @xmath91 which is not eliminated.thus the @xmath87 plane appears densely filled .",
    "this is contrary to what one would observe for fixed values of @xmath92 .",
    "for example , for @xmath93 the @xmath94 constraint would remove models at large @xmath74 up to close to 2 tev and @xmath75 up to about 750 gev . as another example , for @xmath95 ( the space looked at by atlas , and in the previous section ) a strict limit of @xmath96 for light cp even higgs removes all model points below the atlas limits .",
    "however because one is varying @xmath92 the area below the atlas limit is filled in this case .",
    "continuing on we next consider the  cosmological constraint \" in the upper right panel of fig.([total ] ) where we apply only an upper bound on the relic density of the thermally produced neutralino dark matter of @xmath97  @xcite .",
    "the wmap upper bound constraint removes 96.5  % of the models alone , thus this cosmological constraint is very severe eliminating a large fraction of models , but again the atlas constraints remain quite strong .",
    "next we consider the  combined collider / flavor and cosmological constraints \" and find that together these constraints are generally much more severe than the atlas constraints .",
    "this is shown in the lower left panel of fig.([total ] ) . here",
    "models that were separately allowed by previously known collider / flavor constraints , and models that were separately allowed by just the upper bound from wmap , are now eliminated under the imposition of the combined constraints .",
    "there is , however , a new region that atlas appears to exclude above and beyond what the indirect constraints exclude and this region is a region for low @xmath74 and for @xmath75 around 350 gev .",
    "thus it would require a larger integrated luminosity to move past the barren region , which is above the atlas bound , to get into the fertile region of the parameter space , where the fertile region is the area above the white patch in the lower panel of fig.([total ] ) .    finally in lower right panel of fig.([total ] ) we show the value of @xmath3 ( at the electroweak symmetry breaking scale ) in the @xmath98 plane where @xmath3 is the higgsino mass parameter that enters in the higgs bilinear term in the superpotential .",
    "the analysis is given under the  combined constraints \" discussed in the lower left panel of fig.([total ] ) .",
    "we note that essentially all of the natural region of the parameter space corresponding to small @xmath3 , most of which lies close to the hyperbolic branch ( focus point ) ( hb / fp ) @xcite of radiative breaking of the electroweak symmetry or near the vicinity of the light cp even higgs pole region @xcite remains untouched by the cms and lhc exclusion limits as illustrated in the lower right panel of fig.([total ] ) and remains to be explored .",
    "further , as pointed out in ref .",
    "( 1 ) of @xcite , low mass gluinos as low as even 420 gev in msugra are allowed for the region for large @xmath74 where relic density can be satisfied on the light cp even higgs pole @xcite .",
    "this can be seen from fig.([total ] ) as the gluino and squark masses are exhibited in the plots . along the higgs pole region ,",
    "electroweak symmetry breaking can also be natural , i.e. , one has a small @xmath3 .",
    "it is also seen that this region is not constrained by cms and atlas since their limits taper off at large @xmath74 as @xmath99 gets heavy and the jets from squark production are depleted ( see ref .",
    "( 1 ) of @xcite ) .",
    "the cms and atlas analyses on the search for supersymmetry are impressive in that with only 35  pb@xmath0 of data their reach plots already exceed those from cdf and d  experiments at the tevatron . both cms and atlas have given reach plots in the @xmath57 plane for the case @xmath100 with the atlas analysis presenting more stringent limits compared to cms . because of the more stringent limits from atlas we adopted the atlas cuts in our analysis presented in this work . in our analysis",
    "we find consistency with the 1 lepton and 0 lepton results of atlas for the case analyzed by atlas , i.e. , @xmath101 .",
    "we have also investigated reach plots for other values of @xmath102 , i.e. , @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "another interesting question explored in this work is a relative study of the constraints on the @xmath57 parameter space by the cms and atlas experiments vs the constraints that arise from higgs mass limits , flavor physics , and from the dark matter constraints from wmap .",
    "one finds that the current cms and atlas limits are consistent with such constraints .",
    "specifically a significant part of the parameter space excluded by the cms and atlas 35 pb@xmath0 data is already excluded by the indirect constraints .",
    "we emphasize that low gluino masses ( even as low as 400 gev ) remain unconstrained in msugra , and and this conclusion holds generically for other high scale models of soft breaking , for the case when the squark masses are significantly larger than the gluino mass . of interest to the model at hand , is that such situation arises on the hyperbolic branch of radiative breaking of the electroweak symmetry where typically @xmath3 is relatively small , and the region is very dense in the allowed set of parameter points .",
    "finally , we note that some recent papers related to various topics discussed in this work can be found in ref.@xcite .",
