    "the recent astronomical observations are strongly suggesting that the expansion of the universe is speeding up and not slowing thereby revealing the presence of some form of repulsive gravity .",
    "the basic set of experiments includes : observations from sne ia@xcite , cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature anisotropies@xcite , large scale structure@xcite , x - ray data from galaxy clusters@xcite , age estimates of globular clusters and old high redshift galaxies@xcite . in the present cosmic concordance @xmath4cdm model the universe is formed of @xmath5",
    "26% matter ( baryonic + dark matter ) and @xmath5 74% of a smooth vacuum energy component .",
    "the thermal cmb component contributes only about 0.01% , however , its angular power spectrum of temperature anisotropies encode important information about the structure formation process and other cosmic observables .    on the other hand , the number density of collapsed objects for a given mass at a certain time , named the _ mass or multiplicity function _ , is a key quantity in the analysis of cosmic structures such as clusters of galaxies .",
    "the simplest successful approach to analytically describe this quantity was developed more than three decades ago by press and schechter@xcite ( hereafter ps ) .",
    "this gaussian ps formalism is extensively adopted to derive the mass function , @xmath6 , of bounded objects in the observed universe@xcite .",
    "the ps formalism was adopted by reiprich and boringer@xcite in their construction of the cluster mass function based on the x - ray flux - limited sample of galaxy clusters ( hiflugcs ) selected from the rosat all - sky survey . as a result ,",
    "the best fit parameters , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , were obtained in their analysis .",
    "these values are , respectively , very low and very high when compared with the nowadays independent cmb results@xcite thereby leading to some skepticism about the usefulness of clusters as sensitive cosmological probes .",
    "however , several authors have recently claimed that there is no tension between cosmological constraints from cmb and clusters@xcite . in particular , rines and",
    "collaborators@xcite argued that the dynamical determination of cluster masses were overestimated and even modest values of velocity segregation between galaxies and dark matter are sufficient to match the mass function with the wmap results .    in this article",
    "we discuss a different possibility .",
    "we advocate here that such a discrepancy comes out because the matter density fluctuations should be described by an intrinsically non - gaussian random field ( due to the action of the long - range gravitational interaction ) and , therefore , the ps approach should be somewhat modified .    in previous papers@xcite , inspired by the tsallis @xmath2-nonextensive statistics@xcite and kinetic theory@xcite ,",
    "we have proposed a simple extension of the ps analytical formalism . instead the gaussian function of the original ps approach , it was adopted the power law ( pl ) tsallis distribution for describing the fluctuations of the density field .",
    "a basic attractive feature of the pl distribution is that the resulting model is analytically tractable and the standard press - schechter formalism is recovered as particular case . in this way ,",
    "a detailed comparison between the two approaches is immediate .    as we shall see , by applying the pl distribution to fit the observational mass function data from x - ray highest flux - limited sample ( hiflugcs ) we find a strong degeneracy among the pair of cosmic parameters ( @xmath1 , @xmath0 ) , and the @xmath2 parameter from pl distribution .",
    "trough a joint analysis involving recent observations from baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) peak@xcite and cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) shift parameter@xcite the degeneracy is broken and the tension between independent determinations is alliviated .",
    "it is widely known that in the ps original approach the primordial density fluctuations @xmath9 for a given mass @xmath10 is described by a random gaussian field @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the mean squared fluctuation .",
    "when the amplitude of the density contrast grows above a critical value ( @xmath13 ) , a bound object is formed and the fraction @xmath6 , at a given time , can be written as@xcite    @xmath14    while the distribution of bound objects with masses between @xmath10 and @xmath15 reads    @xmath16    now , if instead of gaussian initial fluctuations , we consider that the amplitudes are described by a class of q - parameterized power law distributions , we have the follow expression@xcite    @xmath17 ^{\\frac{1}{\\left ( 1-q\\right ) } } , \\label{prob2}\\ ] ]    where the factor @xmath18 is a one - dimensional normalization constant given by    1 .",

    "@xmath21 , ( if @xmath22 )    in this framework , the non - extensive multiplicity function of bound objects with masses between @xmath10 and @xmath15 reads @xmath23 ^{\\frac{1}{\\left ( 1-q\\right)}}. \\label{fm - pl}\\ ] ] note that in the limit @xmath24 the above pl expressions reduce to the ones of the standard gaussian approach .",

    "we display the results of the joint analysis with bao and shift parameter signatures . ]",
    "as remarked earlier , by performing a @xmath27 statistical procedure with basis on the x - ray hiflugcs data sample , reiprich and boehringer ( rb)@xcite determined the statistical confidence contours for the pair of parameters , @xmath25 and @xmath28 .    in figure 1",
    "we show the contours in the @xmath28-@xmath25 plane obtained by using the standard ps and pl approaches .",
    "the first panel is the rb result .",
    "the legend of this panel show the parameter @xmath29 , and , as already explained , when the @xmath2 parameter from the pl distribution tends to the unity the gaussian results are recovered . in this case ,",
    "the best - fits of the ps method are also shown , namely , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the results from pl distributions ( @xmath30 ) can be seen in the panels below ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , from top to bottom ) .",
    "note that for each panel of fig.[fig1 ] , the solid vertical and horizontal lines shows the minimum and maximum independent wmap limits for @xmath28 and @xmath25 , respectively@xcite .",
    "the important point here is that the contours using the gaussian distribution ( first panel ) does not intercept the independent best - fit values from wmap even at @xmath34 confidence level . in the other panels",
    ", we see that the @xmath2 free parameter of the pl distribution , however , permit the contours to intercept the wmap results in a wide range of @xmath2 values .",
    "roughly estimates show that the range between @xmath35 and @xmath36 is allowed , and , in principle , such a degeneracy need to be removed .",
    "in principle , the above results suggest that in the non - extensive framework there are many possibilities for the theoretical mass function . still more important , some of them are working in the right direction and may help for reconciling the independent estimates of the cosmic parameters .    in this section",
    "we discuss how the parametric 2-dimensional spaces @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 can be further constrained by apllying a statistical analyses involving different cosmological observations . to this end",
    "we consider the current estimates of the baryon acoustic oscillations found in the sdss data @xcite , as well as , the shift parameter from wmap observations @xcite .",
    "the basic aim is to break the degeneracy between the @xmath28 , @xmath25 and @xmath2 parameters in order to better constrain the pl distribution that fits the hiflugcs data .      the baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) in the primordial baryon - photon fluid ,",

    "this signature furnishes a standard rule which can be used to constrain the following quantity : @xmath40^{2/3 }   = 0.469 \\pm 0.017 , % \\nonumber \\label{a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the normalized hubble parameter of the @xmath4cdm model , @xmath42 is a typical redshift of the sdss sample , and @xmath43 is the dimensionless comoving distance to the redshift @xmath44 .",
    "this quantity can be used even for more general models which do not present a large contribution of dark energy at early times@xcite .      a useful quantity to characterize the position of the cmb power spectrum first peak is the shift parameter . for a flat universe",
    "it is given by@xcite : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the recombination redshift and the value for @xmath47 above is calculated from the mcmc of the wmap 3-yr in the standard flat @xmath4cdm model .",

    "note that the contour becomes small and shifted to higher and lower values of @xmath28 and @xmath25 , respectively .    by applying the same procedure ( now fixing @xmath48 ) and plotting the contours on the @xmath28-@xmath2 plane , the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] is obtained .",
    "one may see that almost all values for the @xmath2 parameter is allowed , however , a joint analysis with bao and shift parameter restricts severely the @xmath2 parameter ( @xmath50 ) .",

    "in the precision era of cosmology it is very important to show the compatibility of the cosmological parameters as determined from independent observations .",
    "the current standard cosmological model , i.e. , a flat , accelerating universe composed of @xmath51 of matter ( baryonic + dark ) and @xmath52 of a dark energy component in the form of the vacuum energy density ( @xmath4 ) seems to be fully consistent with a variety of observational data .",
    "however , some tension has recently been detected between the determinations of the pair ( @xmath53 ) from galaxy clusters and cmb . in principle , many temporary solutions are possible , but , hopefully , only one will survive to future analyses based on the next generation of cluster surveys .",
    "in this article we have discussed an alternative route which seems interesting to be investigated from a theoretical and observational viewpoint .",
    "initially , inspired by the non - extensive kinetic theory , we have extended the original gaussian distribution of the primordial density field@xcite . by using this pl distribution to fit the observational mass function from the hiflugcs data we have identified a degeneracy involving the cosmic parameters @xmath1 and @xmath0 with the @xmath2 parameter from the pl distribution .    finally , a joint analysis involving the baryon acoustic oscillation signature and the cmb shift parameter have been applied . as a result , we have shown that the non - extensive pl distribution may alliviate the tension underlying the independent determinations of the cosmic parameters ( see right panel of fig .",
