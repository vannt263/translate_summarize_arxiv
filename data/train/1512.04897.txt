    "the first - generation ground - based detector laser interferometer gravitational - wave observatory ( ligo ) has successfully undergone major technical upgrades in the past few years that have led to a significant increase of the volume of the observable universe.[multiblock footnote omitted ] the detector has already been operative for a few months and _ observation run 1 _ ( o1 ) is being analyzed as these lines are written . in this configuration , ligo can observe binaries of stellar - mass black holes ( bhs)one of the most interesting sources to be detected  of masses @xmath4 out to a distance of @xmath5 gpc ( a redshift of @xmath6 ) , and with the final advanced ( aligo ) configuration about a factor 3 farther away ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , the virgo interferometer is currently undergoing an upgrade program to improve its strain sensitivity , and will be online in the advanced configuration in the next future .",
    "the first direct detection of gws is imminent , provided the number of sources in the observable volume of aligo is big enough .",
    "the fundamental low - frequency limitations of the second - generation detectors are given by thermal , gravity gradient , and seismic noise .",
    "to circumvent these problems , yet a third generation of gravitational - wave ( gw ) interferometers to be operated underground is currently being proposed .",
    "the einstein telescope will be a 10 km laser - interferometer with a sensitivity 100 times better than that of the current detectors , which expands the observable volume of the universe by a factor of a million @xcite .",
    "moreover it will cover the frequency range between 1  hz and @xmath7  hz .    for the search ,",
    "the availability of accurate waveform models for the full merger is pivotal .",

    "nonetheless , the high cost of the development of the many ( @xmath8 ) waveforms necessary for a matched - filtering search represents a problem , if not a true limitation .",
    "hence , to speed up the production of waveforms , certain values are assumed for some of the physical parameters .",
    "these values are not chosen randomly , but rely on electromagnetic observations or theoretical modeling , which represents an emergent symbiotic relationship between astrophysics and gw searches  we reduce the spectrum of the parameter space based on our best understanding of the astrophysics of the system and , once the first detections arrive , they will help us to understand our astrophysical models better .    following this line of thought , in this paper we show that there is a correlation between the mass of bhs with large masses , which we call `` hyperstellar '' ( henceforth hsb ) ) , ( b ) stellar - mass ( @xmath9 ) or ( c ) intermediate - massive ( imbh , @xmath10\\,m_{\\odot}$ ] ) .",
    "the range of masses we are interested in is @xmath11 .",
    "since these bhs are too heavy compared to the nominal mass of an stellar - mass bh but well below the mass of an imbh , we choose the name `` hyperstellar '' to avoid confusion .",
    "] , and their spin .",
    "hsbs are expected to form in low - metallicity environments following the collapse of very - massive stars , as in the works of @xcite , and have been suggested to be the central engines of those ultra - luminous x - ray sources found in star - forming galaxies ( @xcite , who call this sort of bhs `` massive stellar black holes '' ) .",
    "_ we show that bhs with masses _",
    "@xmath12 _ will be detected with typically low spin values _ ( @xmath13 ) _ and on basically circular binary orbits_.",
    "binaries of compact objects in the relativistic regime detectable by ground - based interferometers like aligo can , in principle , form in two different ways ( see e.g. the living review paper by @xcite and references therein ) : ( i ) in galactic plane or bulge as the remnants of massive binary stars ( `` field binaries '' ) , or ( ii ) in dense stellar - systems , such as globular and young clusters , or those nuclear star clusters at the centers of galaxies , via dynamical interactions ( henceforth `` dynamical binaries '' ) .      to have two bhs in a field binary",
    ", we need a binary formed of two stars that are both massive enough ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "since we need them bound , the natal kick that the bhs receive during their formation can not exceed the break - up velocity of the stellar binary .",
    "this favors the formation of binaries of hsbs because ( i ) high - mass bhs receive relatively small natal kicks @xcite and ( ii ) a higher mass requires a larger break - up velocity . for these reasons",
    ", we expect the ground - based gw experiments to detect mostly hsbs ( see * ? ? ?",
    "*  for a more quantitative evaluation ) .",
    "dynamical binaries will naturally tend to form with large masses .",
    "this is so because the timescale for an object to sink towards the center of a stellar system via dynamical friction is the relaxation time divided by its mass  more massive stars will sink first into a dense environment . moreover , binaries of larger masses are more difficult to separate in three - body interactions because of the larger binding energy .",
    "in particular , @xcite found with monte - carlo simulations bh masses well exceeding the nominal @xmath1 in @xmath14 of the binaries in globular clusters , and @xcite estimated with semi - analytical arguments and scattering experiments that there is a strong tendency for the merging bhs in nuclear star clusters to be biased toward high masses .",
    "this bias of forming massive binaries due to the existence of hsbs has been confirmed using direct - summation @xmath15body simulations of young clusters @xcite . as a result of the above bias , ground - based observatories are more likely to detect hsb binaries in dense clusters than in the stellar - mass range ( i.e. with masses of about @xmath16 @xcite ) .",
    "in the field , the only way to produce a hsb binary is to form , in the first place , a stellar binary of two wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars ( with stellar mass @xmath17 , following the definition of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "an environment with low metallicity is more favorable .",
    "for example , in a solar - metallicity environment , a @xmath18 wr star produces a bh of only @xmath19 @xcite , but in an environment with @xmath20 solar metallicity the same star can produce a @xmath21 hsb ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it is interesting to note that for extremely metal - poor environments ( which are uncommon in the redshift range of our interest , @xmath22 , @xcite ) , hsbs in the mass range @xmath23 are prevented from forming because of a pair - instability process during the supernova phase @xcite .",
    "because of angular - momentum loss by stellar wind , wr stars are slow rotators . the rotational velocity at the stellar surface drops from an initial value of @xmath24 to below @xmath25 during the stellar evolution @xcite . as a result , the compact remnant which is sitting at the core of a wr star retains very little of the initial angular momentum .",
    "for example , when @xmath26which is the initial stellar mass relevant to hsb formation ",
    "the current stellar evolution models predict that the specific angular momentum measured at the edge of the stellar remnant will drop from @xmath27 in the initial configuration to as small as @xmath28 , and even smaller for more massive stars @xcite .",
    "since the remnant of a wr star has a low specific angular momentum , the hsb must be a slow rotator . even under the assumption that no angular momentum is lost during the collapse of the remnant and the growing of the initial seed bh that eventually becomes a hsb ,",
    "the spin parameter of the final hsb is :    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the speed of light .",
    "note that because of the reason we just argued , this is an upper limit , and in a more realistic estimation , the value will be even lower . also , it is interesting to note that equation  ( [ eq.spin_param ] ) gives the same spin range as what we have observed currently for the stellar - mass bhs ( @xmath31 ) in the local group @xcite .    to spin up the slowly rotating hsb that we have predicted , the only two possibilities are ( i ) merger with another hsb because of a dynamical interaction , such as a three - body encounter , or ( ii ) accretion of enough material onto the hsb , about an amount of @xmath32 to achieve a result of @xmath33 .",
    "the first possibility can indeed enhance the spin value of the merger product to @xmath33 .",
    "however , this process can not take place in the field , because the stellar relaxation timescale ( i.e. encounter timescale ) exceeds by many orders of magnitude the hubble time .",
    "moreover , in the next section we will see that the outcome will not be observed because of a dynamical selection effect .    regarding ( ii ) , there are two sources that can possibly provide material to feed the hsb , either the interstellar medium ( ism ) surrounding our field binary , or the companion star , i.e. the other wr star in the binary which may not have collapsed into a bh yet .",
    "the bondi - hoyle accretion rate from the ism is @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the proton density in ism and @xmath36 the velocity dispersion of stars @xcite .",
    "this feeding rate is too low to spin up the hsb , because it would require a time longer than the hubble time . on the other hand ,",
    "the life span of the wr companion star is of @xmath37 myr , which is too short compared to the minimum timescale for a bh to double its mass by accreting at the maximum ( eddington ) rate .",
    "this is the salpeter timescale , which is about @xmath38 myr assuming that @xmath39 of the rest mass is converted into radiation ( see sec .",
    "6.3 in * ? ? ?",
    "we hence deduce that _",
    "field hsbs must be slow rotators , with lower values than the upper limit shown in eq .",
    "[ eq.spin_param ] because of loss of angular momentum during the remnant collapse_.",
    "for this section , we assume that the hsb binary forms dynamically from two hsbs that were born isolated ( if this is not the case , then the previous result applies ) and then later formed a binary via three - body interactions .",
    "there are three possible channels to form an isolated hsb : ( i ) the collapse of an isolated wr star , ( ii ) the coalescence of two less massive bhs ( e.g. @xmath40 ) and ( iii ) by accreting background stars .    channel ( i ) : as we have seen in section  [ sec : field ] , hsbs with masses higher than @xmath21 have typically low spins , @xmath2 .",
    "this hsb receives a natal kick typically of @xmath41^{-1}~{\\rm km~s^{-1}}$ ] @xcite and is hence kept in the host cluster , because the velocity dispersion is of order @xmath42 .",
    "lighter bhs will not be retained .",
    "since we want to build binaries , it is important to retain them in the cluster .",
    "hence , most bhs with masses lighter than @xmath21 are typically bound to leave the cluster at birth , without a chance of forming a binary .",
    "channel ( ii ) : although we have just shown that lighter bhs typically abandon the host cluster at birth , there is sufficient margin so that some remain ( see e.g. the work of @xcite , although the accretion rate is so low that it is difficult to assess whether the bhs are @xmath43 or @xmath44 ) , and so we also address this channel .",
    "we point out two particular properties of dynamical binaries that will be important in determining the spin parameter , @xmath45 , of the final merged bh .",
    "( a ) on average , the two members of a dynamical bh binary very likely will have similar masses because the three - body interaction tends to retain equal - mass binaries .",
    "this is particularly true for bhs , since they belong to the heaviest objects in clusters , and so they have lower probabilities to be ionized or replaced by another interloper ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "( b ) the majority of bh - bh mergers have a zero - eccentricity orbit , as we will see in section  [ sec : ecc ] . as a result of these two points ,",
    "the binary has a significant amount of angular momentum before it merges , and hence preferentially produces a high - spin hsb by the end of the merger .    to prove this",
    ", we calculate the distribution of @xmath45 for different mass ratios ( @xmath46 , with @xmath47 the more massive bh ) , using the method developed by one of us and presented in @xcite .",
    "the algorithm chooses a random orientation for the spin axis of each progenitor , and then , given the mass ratio @xmath48 ( @xmath49 in our model ) of the two bhs , computes @xmath45 and the relativistic recoiling velocity , @xmath50 , according to the empirical fitting formulae derived from numerical relativity simulations @xcite .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ fig : merger ] shows our results , where we have assumed a random distribution for the spin magnitudes in the range @xmath51 $ ] for the two progenitors .",
    "we can see that when @xmath52 , the value of @xmath53 is most likely greater than @xmath54 , which correlates into a very large relativistic recoiling velocity ( see lower panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : merger ] ) , that , for all purposes , is much higher than the average dispersion velocity of the host cluster , typically of @xmath42 .",
    "the excess of recoiling velocity relative to the velocity dispersion of the host stellar system is also true even for nuclear star clusters ( nsc , dense stellar clusters found at the center of galaxies of all hubble types , see e.g. @xcite ) , whose dispersion velocities are around @xmath55 , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "hence , even if the few remaining lighter bhs led to the formation of high - spin hsbs in clusters , these are immediately kicked out of the host environment because of the relativistic kick , and do not stand a chance of forming a binary .    channel ( iii ) : by accreting background stars , a bh with a mass initially well below @xmath21 can not become a hsb .",
    "this is because the accretion rate from other stars in a very dense environment , such as a nsc , is    @xmath56    where @xmath57 is the critical radius for the bh to tidally disrupt a solar - type star and @xmath58 is the spatial density of background stars .",
    "hence , in this channel we can not form hsbs .",
    "therefore hsbs retained in globular clusters or nsc predominantly have slow spin ( @xmath59 ) , and hence _ dynamical bh binaries detected with ground - based detectors will be hsbs with low spin . _",
    "field binaries will have low eccentricities when they enter the detector band because    their orbits circularize during the binary - star evolution due to roche lobe overflow , common envelope phase and tidal synchronization ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and , much later in the evolution , due to gw radiation .",
    "for dynamical binaries , however , the eccentricities in the detector band are more uncertain , because of dynamical interactions with other stars . for instance",
    ", a binary - binary interaction can lead to the existence of a third body gravitationally bound to and interacting with the binary ( though the probability to form a triple via single - binary interaction is very low , at least for bodies with the same masses , see @xcite and references therein ) . for this particular situation , the interaction can lead to a large oscillation of the orbital eccentricity of the binary because of the kozai - lidov resonance ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this case ,",
    "as many as @xmath60 of mergers in the detector band could have an eccentricity larger than @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "these results hold for bound triple systems in which all bodies have a similar or equal mass in the stellar - mass bh range ( i.e. around @xmath1 ) .",
    "however , direct - summation @xmath15body simulations that do not make a priori assumptions about mass ratios and bound systems , find that bh - bh mergers are preferentially circular ( @xmath62 ) and driven by interactions with unbound small bodies ( which is referred to as hardening in stellar dynamics ) @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , such direct - summation simulations are very expensive and not suited for statistical studies .    hence , to statistically address the evolution of the eccentricities of the hsb binaries during three - body interactions    , we use the numerical tool fewbody @xcite .",
    "moreover , we have modified it by adding relativistic corrections to the force term , which might be important in the kind of interactions that we are interested in ( hsb binaries ) . for this , we have chosen the centre - of - mass frame of the binary for the post - newtonian ( @xmath63 hereafter ) expressions , which is equivalent to the center - of - mass hamiltonian in adm ( arnowit , deser and misner ) coordinates thanks to a transformation of the particles variables , following the expressions given by @xcite .",
    "this means that the relative acceleration in the center - of - mass frame has the form    @xmath64 + { \\cal o}\\left ( \\frac{1}{c^7 } \\right)\\ ; , \\label{eq.blanchet}\\ ] ]    where the relative separation of the binary is @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 ; the @xmath68 and @xmath69 are given by the expressions ( 3.10a ) and ( 3.10b ) in @xcite .",
    "we truncate the series and neglect all terms of order higher than 2.5@xmath63 , since e.g. the 3@xmath63 correction requires a very expensive computation and provides us only with a correction which is negligible for the purpose of this study . on the other hand , the 3.5@xmath63 term , even if it is significantly less challenging ,",
    "would provide us only with a rough ( @xmath70 ) estimate of the gravitational recoil velocity .",
    "in other words , we focus in this work only on the relativistic corrections corresponding to periastron shift ( 1@xmath63 and 2@xmath63 ) and the energy loss in the form of gw radiation ( 2.5@xmath63 ) .",
    "the first implementation of relativistic terms in a dynamical code was done by one of us and they have been well tested in a number of different works that feature different orders in the expansion ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the initial conditions for all experiments are a binary of two hsbs plus an unbound interloper .",
    "we note that during the interactions , there are long - lived hierarchical triples forming , which are hence also included in the experiments .",
    "we assume a relative velocity corresponding to the velocity dispersion of a nsc , @xmath71 .",
    "initially the code calculates @xmath72 , the impact parameter corresponding to a classical , point - mass closest approach of @xmath73 .",
    "it then performs scattering experiments with @xmath74 increasing from near zero , following a distribution uniform in area , @xmath75 .",
    "it continues performing classical , point - mass closest approach of @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the initial semimajor axis of the hsb binary .",
    "it then performs scattering experiments with @xmath74 increasing from near zero .",
    "it continues performing experiments as long as @xmath74 is less than @xmath72 , or b is less than two times the last @xmath74 for which the encounter was either a recordable event or a resonant encounter .",
    "the reason for the latter constraint on @xmath74 is to ensure that any interesting encounters that might occur at large @xmath74 are not missed .",
    "the masses of the hsbs are set to @xmath78 . in a dense stellar environment such as",
    "a nsc , a bh binary becomes hard when its kinetic energy per unit mass , @xmath79 ( with @xmath80 the reduced mass of the binary ) , becomes greater than the kinetic energy per unit mass of the field stars , @xmath81 .",
    "this definition of a hard binary gives a critical semi - major axis , @xmath82 , which is about @xmath83 au when @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "a genuinely hard binary ( i.e. one with binding energy @xmath86 , with @xmath87 the average thermal energy of stars in the system , see e.g. @xcite ) should have a semi - major axis @xmath77 about ten times smaller than the above critical value .",
    "hence , for the simulations we consider only @xmath88 au .    for each binary we assume a single encounter with an interloper .",
    "the reason why we do not consider successive encounters can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq.gamma ] ) : the encounter rate for a hsb binary ( of total mass @xmath89 and a semimajor axis of 0.1 au ) with another star is @xmath90 , while the rate to interact with an hsb interloper is @xmath91 .",
    "i.e. for a hubble time the binary will interact with 2 stars and with no other hsb .",
    "to first order , the initial mass function ( imf ) can be approximated by two well - separated mass scales .",
    "we hence consider interlopers of masses @xmath92 ( representing within order or magnitude main sequence stars , white dwarfs and neutron stars ) and @xmath93 ( stellar - mass black holes ) .",
    "the relative abundance ( i.e. the number fraction ) of objects in these mass ranges after a relaxation time is dominated by the lighter stars @xcite , and hence we use a number fraction of heavy mass particles of @xmath94 , with @xmath95 the abundance of light stars .",
    "we ran @xmath7 samples for each of the experiments to do a statistical study .",
    "the code scans different orbital parameters , such as the initial relative velocity and impact parameter , and integrates the system until it has been dynamically solved .",
    "this means that the three - body interaction has finished and we are then left with either a new binary with new orbital elements and one of the particles has been ejected , or the binary has coalesced during the three - body interaction because it was set on a very radial orbit and the pericenter was smaller than the semi - major axis defined for coalescence ( see below ) .",
    "we then filter the results looking for binaries that are already in the detector band .",
    "for instance , for aligo this means that we look for systems with an orbital period of @xmath96 seconds  so that the gravitational wave frequency ( the double of the orbital frequency ) , should be @xmath97 . for those systems we calculate the eccentricities at both detector - entrance and coalescence .",
    "we assume as a first - order approximation that the systems coalesce if @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the schwarzschild radius ( for instance , for a @xmath100 , @xmath101 ) .",
    "even if from a dynamical point of view the three - body interaction has finished before the binary enters the detector band , we want to know how many will be in the detector band within a hubble time . for this , we evolve the orbital parameters from the last snapshot in the evolution that we have from the numerical code , and we evolve them with an approximation of keplerian orbits , as in @xcite .",
    "the equations evolve a system under the assumption that gravitational radiation is the only source of shrinkage of the semi - major axis of the binary , which is valid in our situation , since we do not allow the binary to interact with any other interloper after the first three - body scattering process .",
    "we then evolve them until they reach @xmath102 , provided this happens in within a hubble time . of those that enter into the detector band ,",
    "we record the eccentricity .",
    "the calculations were halted whenever the orbital speed of binary reached @xmath103 c ( the speed of light ) , since the @xmath63 expansion is not valid for higher velocities .",
    "furthermore , once that point in the evolution is reached , the binary will always coalesce .",
    "the description of the parameter space of the simulations given below corresponds to that point , which we refer to hereafter as the _ merger point _ in the evolution of the binary , even if it does not strictly corresponds to the real coalescence of the objects . to speed up calculations",
    ", the code analytically treats weakly tidally perturbed binaries :",
    "any hierarchies are analytically treated whenever they are tidally perturbed less than the tidal perturbation tolerance .",
    "this means that in a hierarchical triple in which the eccentricity of the outer binary is very large , the inner binary could be treated analytically at each apocenter passage in the orbit  provided it is not strongly tidally perturbed ( for more details , see section 3.3.4 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to make this feature work with @xmath63 gravity",
    ", we added the proviso that a weakly tidally perturbed binary must also have orbital speed at pericenter smaller than @xmath104 to be treated analytically .",
    "we typically take @xmath105 , which provides a good compromise between accuracy and computational speed .    in fig .",
    "[ fig.hist_circular ] we display the distribution of eccentricities for the scattering experiments at detector entrance .",
    "we can readily see that there is a trend towards higher eccentricites as the binary is tighter because the tighter the binary , the shorter the time to coalesce , and the shorter time for gw radiation to reduce the eccentricity .",
    "we also explore binaries that initially are more eccentric , as displayed in figs .",
    "( [ fig.hist_ecc_a1e-3 ] , [ fig.hist_ecc_a1e-4 ] ) , initially starting with eccentricities of 0.3 , 0.5 , 0.7 , and 0.9 . for these , only a negligible fraction of the experiments with a high initial eccentricity and a very tight semimajor axis achieves a final eccentricity of about @xmath106 and a very few events ( about @xmath107 of the binaries with initial @xmath108 which are very tight ) enter the detector band with @xmath109 , to completely circularise a bit before coalescence .",
    "all other results stay well below @xmath110 .",
    "the relative fraction of eccentric binaries is so low that they can be ignored even for the overoptimistic upper limit cases .",
    "current search strategies are based on templates of circular binaries , so that the size of the parameter space will be manageable .",
    "although this blinds them to most eccentric mergers @xcite , and in principle to the richer information contained in the gravitational wave signals associated with those mergers , these events are so rare that they can be safely ignored .",
    "the same applies to field binaries because , as explained before , they will also be circular .",
    "in this work we have addressed the formation channels for bh binaries in the range of observation of ground - based detectors .",
    "we find that in the two cases ( binaries forming isolated or via dynamical interactions ) the most likely is that the binary members are two bhs in the the mass range of @xmath111 , which we call `` hyperstellar black holes '' , produced by massive wr stars .",
    "we show that the two binary members , again in the two different formation channels , will be slow rotators , meaning a spin magnitude of @xmath2 .",
    "we show that there is ( so far ) no possible physical process capable of spinning a hsb up to values @xmath33 in a binary .",
    "we carry out a statical study of the eccentricity distribution for a binary of two hsbs in a dense stellar environment .",
    "for this we use a numerical newtonian code in which we have implemented relativistic correcting terms .",
    "we prove that hsb binaries will predominantely have almost circular orbits at detector entrance , so that eccentric binaries can be ignored in the searches .",
    "field bh binaries formed in isolation have been shown to also have almost circular orbits at aligo frequencies .",
    "moreover , these binaries should have similar masses . in section  [",
    "sec : cluster ] we gave reasons based in relaxation and we referenced as well the work of @xcite for the case of dynamical binaries .",
    "field binaries will also very likely have similar masses , as has been shown with binary evolution and population synthesis codes @xcite .",
    "we therefore predict that hsb binaries will be observed by ground - based detectors with similar masses , low spin magnitudes and almost zero eccentricities , regardless of where they have formed .",
    "this has the potential to speed up the searches .",
    "moreover , a binary of two @xmath100 bhs , i.e. a hsb binary , will be seen at farther distance than a binary of two @xmath1 bhs .",
    "so the increased volume will ensure that many more massive hsbs will be detected .",
    "although there is so far no evidence for the existence of hsbs , we deem the non - detection to be related to the limitation of conventional observations in the electromagnetic wavebands .",
    "stellar - origin bhs are discovered whenever a bh is accreting material from a companion star @xcite . for hsbs , the lifespan in such",
    "a configuration is short : the companion star is very likely also a wr star , since they should have similar masses , as we have seen .",
    "since the lifetime of a wr star is only 5 myr , the time window to observe a hsb binary is very short ( even shorter if the two wr stars collapse each to a hsb simultaneously ) .",
    "hence , hsbs stay virtually always dark in the electromagnetic domain .    with the first detections being imminent , soon",
    "the symbiotic relation between astrophysics and data analysis that we mentioned in the introduction will be fulfilled .",
    "the upcoming detections will either confirm our prediction or rule it out , and we will hence obtain information about the birth and evolution of stellar black holes , as well as about their environments  information that is virtually unaccessible to our old friend the photon .",

    "<S> we also address the distribution of the eccentricities of hsb binaries in dense stellar systems using a large suite of three - body scattering experiments that include binary - single interactions and long - lived hierarchical systems with a highly accurate integrator , including relativistic corrections up to @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that most sources in the detector band will have nearly zero eccentricities . </S>",
    "<S> this correlation between large , similar masses , low spin and low eccentricity will help to accelerate the searches for gravitational - wave signals .    </S>",
