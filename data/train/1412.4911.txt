    "it suggests that a first - order - like transition , rounded by finite size effect , takes place , in qualitative agreement with the result for a system of harmonic spheres  @xcite .",
    "note that , within the accuracy of our data , we see that the amplitude of the ( smeared out ) jump in @xmath42 $ ] seems to vanish around @xmath52 , thus indicating that at around that temperature the line of first order transition ends in a critical point that is second - order - like .    from this approach with the overlap",
    ", we can define the ideal glass transition temperature @xmath53 as the temperature at which the skewness of @xmath9 $ ] vanishes ( see si ) , and in fig .",
    "4 we have included the resulting @xmath53 as well . for small and intermediate @xmath0 , we find a very good agreement between @xmath1 and @xmath54 , thus showing that the two very different approaches do give the same ideal glass transition temperature .",
    "this is thus very strong evidence that at this temperature the system does indeed undergo a thermodynamic phase transition from the fluid to an ideal glass state . for temperatures above the second - order - like critical point the curves @xmath1 and @xmath55 differ .",

    ", the value of @xmath57 $ ] at high @xmath10 moves steadily upward , which is reasonable since the energy of the system is literally _ pinned _ at the higher energy levels due to the presence of the pinned particles . concomitantly the crossover temperature increases with @xmath0 and",
    "the crossover becomes smeared out , completely disappearing at the highest @xmath0 .",
    "the vanishing of this crossover with growing @xmath0 indicates thus that the pinning affects qualitatively the nature of the pel and of the relaxation dynamics .",
    "for instance it is found that with increasing @xmath0 the fragility of the system decreases and shows at high @xmath0 an arrhenius dependence  @xcite .    in the inset of figure  3(a ) , the low temperature behavior of @xmath59 $ ] is shown .",

    "this is an indicator that the distribution of @xmath61 is gaussian  @xcite .",
    "another important quantity that connects the glassy dynamics of a system with its pel is the saddle index @xmath62 , _",

    "2 ) , thus indicating that in this region of parameter space the system has a second order like critical point .",
    "the theoretical calculations for a mean - field spin glass model show that @xmath1 should terminate at a finite @xmath0 and that this end point is a critical point of the universality class of the random field ising model  @xcite .",
    "furthermore the theory predicts that at this end point the coexistence line @xmath1 and the dynamical line @xmath4 merge .",
    "figure  4 shows that this prediction is indeed compatible with our data in that the two lines do cross near @xmath75 .    from the figure we also recognize that , beyond the endpoint , @xmath1 obtained from @xmath73 almost matches with @xmath4",
    "this result is reasonable since in this range of @xmath10 and @xmath0 the particles are strongly confined by the labyrinthine structure imposed by the pinned particles , _",

    "in contrast to @xmath1 , @xmath55 raises continuously even beyond the endpoint .",
    "this can be understood by recalling that this line is defined by the points at which the skewness becomes zero , _",

    "@xcite . , scaledwidth=48.0% ]    [ fig - phasediagram ]    to the best of our knowledge , the present study is the first report of a system in finite dimensions that shows the existence of an ideal glass state _ in equilibrium _ , _",
    "i.e. _ , a state in which the configurational entropy is zero at a finite @xmath10 .",
    "the kauzmann temperatures reported in the past have all relied on somewhat questionable extrapolation procedures , leaving thus room for debate over the very existence of a thermodynamic transition  @xcite .",
    "our findings are inconsistent with recent simulation studies in which the @xmath2and @xmath3dependence of the relaxation dynamics has been studied  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the structural relaxation time @xmath11 was fitted with the vogel - fulcher relation @xmath83 $ ] , with @xmath84 as fit parameter .",
    "this relation can be directly derived from the adam - gibbs as well as the rfot theory , both of which assert that @xmath85 , and thus the vogel - fulcher temperature @xmath84 is predicted to be identical to @xmath5 .",

    "@xcite fitted their data also with the mct power - law @xmath86 in order to determine the @xmath3dependence of @xmath7 .",

    "we have plotted the relaxation time @xmath11 as a function of @xmath6 for finite @xmath0 and found that the adam - gibbs relation is violated ( see si for details ) .",
    "thus we conclude that in the case of pinned systems one can not deduce the vogel - fulcher law from the adam - gibbs relation .    since the results presented here are all obtained in thermodynamic equilibrium without referring to any kind of extrapolation , we are confident that the phase diagram presented in fig",
    ".  4 does indeed reflect the properties of the system and is not an artifact of the analysis .",
    "a further evidence that the simulated system is really in equilibrium is the observation that the entropy obtained by thermodynamic integration from the high temperature limit matches with that obtained from the low temperature side ( via harmonic approximation ) in the glass phase .",
    "it is also reassuring that all three methods , the thermodynamic integration ( vanishing entropy ) , the overlap distribution ( the discontinuous jump of @xmath8 ) , and the geometric change of the pel , consistently point to the same end point , thus giving strong evidence that this point really exists .",
    "also suggestive is that each combination of pairs amongst three methods are compatible beyond the end point , which is reminiscent of the widom line in the standard gas - liquid phase transition .    at this stage",
    "we can conclude that the phase diagram as predicted by the rfot theory is confirmed at least qualitatively .",
    "what remains to be done is to probe the relaxation dynamics in the vicinity of the critical end point since one can expect that this dynamics is rather unusual  @xcite and to establish its universality class  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it will also be important to see whether the predicted phase diagram can also be observed in real experiments .",

    "one simulates simultaneously several copies of the system _ i.e. _ , the same hamiltonian but each replica is at a different temperature . using a boltzmann criterion and the detailed balance condition , we periodically attempt to interchange the configurations of two replicas at different temperatures . hence each replica makes a random walk in the temperature space . due to the fast relaxation at high @xmath10",
    ", this will lead to an efficient relaxation of the system also at low @xmath10 .",

    "we follow the notations introduced in the method and materials section .",
    "our starting system is a binary mixture of type a and b particles .",

    "this equivalence is the well - known fact for this type of the pinned system  @xcite .        to calculate the entropy @xmath147 from simulations , we employ the thermodynamic integration ( ti ) method .",
    "the ti method that is most frequently applied to lennard - jones particles is to connect the ideal gas state and the state of interest by a combination of a compression path ( increasing density ) and a cooling path ( decreasing temperature )  @xcite .",

    "thus we can not use the relation eq .",
    "( [ equiv ] ) to evaluate the integrands .",

    "the integral in eq .",

    "we employ the simpson s rule to evaluate the integral and take the disorder average over realizations .",
    "( 3 ) we take a special care about the integration at very high temperature @xmath162 , since the potential energies @xmath154 and @xmath163 diverge in the high temperature limit . to accurately calculate the integral",
    ", we first fit the potential energy data to a polynomial function then analytically integrate the function .",
    "considerations on the high temperature expansion shows that the potential energy of the lennard - jones particles at high temperature behaves as    @xmath164    where @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath113 are constants  @xcite .",
    "we thus fit the data of @xmath165 with expression  ( [ eq : u_expansion ] ) to obtain these constants and integrate it analytically . in fig .",

    "the vertical dashed line indicates the temperature above which we use the analytical integration .",

    "we next summarize the method to calculate the harmonic vibrational entropy of the pinned system .",
    "we consider the system that weakly vibrates around an inherent structure ( is ) .",

    ", we have sampled the inherent structure by minimizing the potential energy of instantaneous configurations obtained in the simulations . for this calculation we used the conjugate - gradient method .",
    "note that the pinned particles were frozen during the minimization process and only the coordinates of the unpinned particles are optimized .      in fig .",

    "the dynamic transition temperatures @xmath7 can be evaluated by two methods : the dynamic route and the static one  @xcite . in the dynamic route , @xmath7 is obtained directly by fitting the relaxation time @xmath11 from the time - dependent correlation functions , such as the scattering function @xmath185 , to the mct power - law @xmath186 .",

    "as it is well known for bulk systems , special care has to be taken to chose an optimized temperature windows over which @xmath11 can be fitted by a power - law and we have thus put the emphasis to get a good fit in the low temperature part of the data .    in fig .",

    "this is the reason why in the present study we put more emphasis on the static method .",
    "in this section we will show that for the pinned fluid the adam - gibbs relation @xmath193  @xcite is violated . in fig .",
