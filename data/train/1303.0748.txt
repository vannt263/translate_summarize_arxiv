    "<S> extending the stochastic mean - field model by including pairing , an approach is proposed for describing evolutions of complex many - body systems in terms of an ensemble of time - dependent hartree - fock bogoliubov trajectories which is determined by incorporating fluctuations in the initial state . </S>",

    "<S> , this idea has been pushed forward to improved the mean - field description of many - body interacting systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> mean - field description can not describe essential quantal effects associated to collective motion and severely underestimates fluctuations of collective observables . by considering an ensemble of mean - field trajectories with a specific choice of the fluctuations ( quantal zero - point and thermal ) in the initial state , it is possible to overcome some of these shortcomings . </S>",
    "<S> several applications , especially in the nuclear physics context @xcite , have shown that this approach can improve the mean - field description by including important dissipative aspects in transport properties of heavy - ion collisions . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , we illustrated that such an approach , in addition to fluctuations , can accurately tackle the problem of symmetry breaking close to bifurcation point in collective energy landscape @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> up to now , the stochastic mean - field ( smf ) approach with initial fluctuations has been developed starting from a time - dependent hartree - fock ( tdhf ) version of the mean - field . </S>",
    "<S> nowadays , there are increasing interests in the treatment of pairing to describe evolution of strongly interacting fermi liquids @xcite employing the time - dependent hartree - fock bogoliubov ( tdhfb ) approach or its simplified bcs limit . </S>",
    "<S> while the tdhfb theory provides an important improvement beyond tdhf , it still suffers from the above quoted limitations : i.e. underestimation of quantum collective fluctuations and impossibility to spontaneously break symmetries . due to the successful description of the smf approach in geometric symmetry breaking , </S>",
    "<S> it is rather tempting to introduce quantum fluctuations through initial sampling to treat pairing where the @xmath0 symmetry breaking plays an important role .    in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we present an extension of the smf approach by incorporating pairing into the description . in the standard tdhfb theory , evolution of the generalized density matrix @xmath1 </S>",

    "<S> it is rather interesting to mention that eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : flucrho ] ) and ( [ eq : fluckappa ] ) provide fluctuations in the quasi - particle basis which give specific aspects . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , at zero temperature , eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : flucrho ] ) cancels out and only ( [ eq : fluckappa ] ) gives non - zero fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , although it might appear surprising , the t=0 limit is fully contained in the fluctuation of the anomalous density especially in the case of vanishing pairing . as an illustration , </S>",
    "<S> let us consider that the initial state is a slater determinant . in that case quasi - particle creation operators can be either particle creation operators ( with @xmath39 ) or holes annihilation operators ( with @xmath40 ) , where @xmath41 are the single - particle occupation number . </S>",
    "<S> then eq . ( [ eq : fluckappa ] ) identifies with the fluctuation of the one - body density originally proposed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . in a similar way , </S>",
    "<S> the case of a statistical ensemble at finite temperature with zero pairing can be deduced . </S>",
    "<S> then , both eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : flucrho ] ) and ( [ eq : fluckappa ] ) contribute to fluctuations .    in order to illustrate the powerfulness of the approach </S>",
    "<S> , we consider a many - body system governed by a pairing hamiltonian . in the model , there are @xmath42 single - particle levels , labelled by @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> each level is associated with the energy @xmath44 and has a degeneracy @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> it is assumed that each time a state @xmath43 is present , its time - reversed states @xmath46 is also present with same energy . </S>",
    "<S> we define a number operator for each energy level as @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , pair creation / annihilation operators @xmath48 , @xmath49 are introduced . </S>",
    "<S> the pairing hamiltonian of the system is given by @xcite @xmath50 from the set of operators , one can construct three quasi - spin components @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , which form a standard su(2 ) algebra . for not too large particle and single - particle levels numbers </S>",
    "<S> , the eigenstates of @xmath54 can be determined by direct diagonalization @xcite giving access to the exact static and dynamical properties .    within tdhfb , </S>",
    "<S> evolutions of the expectation values @xmath55 of the quasi - spin components are determined by a set of coupled equations ( @xmath56 ) , @xmath57 where @xmath58 is nothing but the self - consistent mean - field while the pairing field @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> these equations of motion are quite general . </S>",
    "<S> they appear for instance in fermi gas dynamics simulations on a lattice with a contact interaction @xcite or in the nuclear physics context @xcite .    in order to illustrate some limitations of tdhfb , </S>",
    "<S> let us suppose that the initial state of the system is described by a slater determinant of single - particle wave functions . </S>",
    "<S> since the hamiltonian ( [ eq : rich ] ) contains two - body interactions , this state is not an eigenstate of the pairing hamiltonian and it is expected to evolve in time . </S>",
    "<S> however , it turns out that this state is a stationary solution of the tdhfb equation . indeed , since the state is an eigenstate of the particle number , the expectation values of quasi - spins vanish @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we deduce that all quasi - spin components remain constant in time . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the tdhfb approach is unable to describe correlations that built up in time and leads to the departure from the independent particle approach . </S>",
    "<S> this failure stems from the fact that a symmetry that exists initially , here the @xmath0 symmetry , can not be spontaneously broken in the mean - field approach . in the stochastic tdhfb approach </S>",
    "<S> , the situation is different . </S>",
    "<S> time evolution of the expectation values of quasi - spin components are still determined by the same set of equations ( [ eq : tdhfbspin ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , the initial condition is not determined in a deterministic manner , but is specified in terms of distributions of @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> following from the basic postulate of the approach , ( [ eq : flucrho ] ) and ( [ eq : fluckappa ] ) , the initial distributions of quasi - spin components are uncorrelated random gaussian numbers . </S>",
    "<S> their mean values are determined by @xmath62 while @xmath63 or @xmath64 for occupied and unoccupied levels respectively . </S>",
    "<S> identifying the quasi - particle vacuum with a slater determinant , variances of quasi - spin distributions are given by , @xmath65 and @xmath66 consequently , for each level @xmath43 , the @xmath67 component of quasi - spin is initially a non - fluctuating quantity , while the @xmath68 and @xmath69 components ( @xmath70 ) are specified by uncorrelated real gaussian distributions . </S>",
    "<S> solution is not a deterministic final state , but consists of a distribution of final states . </S>",
    "<S> note that the mean number of particle is conserved event by event while the total energy is conserved in average .     </S>",
