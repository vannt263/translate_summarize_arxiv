    "this paper examines the probability of particle production by two strong colliding laser beams .",
    "the laser frequencies are low , @xmath2 .",
    "however , we find that qualitatively important features of the process deviate from the case of particle creation by a static electromagnetic field originally considered by sauter , and formulated in the language of quantum field theory by schwinger @xcite .",
    "the electron - positron ( @xmath1 ) pairs created in the oscillating laser field may recollide ; these collisions violate the adiabatic condition , and consequently strongly enhance the probabilities of a number of phenomena .",
    "the phenomena considered in this paper are the creation of high energy gamma quanta and muon production .",
    "the found rate for @xmath3 production exponentially exceeds the rate predicted by the schwinger mechanism , while high energy photon production by low frequency laser fields is a new phenomenon , which has not been discussed previously .",
    "the @xmath1 pair creation process predicted in @xcite for static fields has since become a popular area of study  it lies outside the ambit of perturbation theory and illustrates the nonlinear properties of the qed vacuum .",
    "the problem was subsequently extended to electromagnetic fields that vary slowly @xcite , and thereafter , the creation of @xmath1 pairs due to such fields colliding with various targets has been extensively studied in literature @xcite .    despite its theoretical import , pair production due to",
    "static , or slowly - varying strong fields has only been indirectly observed @xcite as it is strongly suppressed for experimentally achievable electric fields .",
    "the critical field strength for particle creation is @xmath4 v / cm , requiring an intensity of @xmath5 w/@xmath6 , much larger than the fields available experimentally .",
    "however , in recent years , several large laser facilities including eli @xcite , xfel @xcite and hiper @xcite , have come increasingly close to creating the critical electric field strength required for observing pair production ",
    "hiper , for instance , is predicted to produce intensities of @xmath7 w/@xmath6 .",
    "these theoretical and experimental advances mean laser facilities may test theories of strong field qed in the next decade , motivating further study into what they may observe .",
    "several contemporary efforts are therefore directed at means to improve the observability of pair production .",
    "recent works investigate manipulation of the laser pulse shape @xcite and tuning of the laser polarization @xcite .",
    "many studies have investigated the so - called dynamical schwinger mechanism @xcite , brought about by colliding two laser beams one strong low frequency field ( which gives rise to schwinger pair production ) , and a weak high frequency field which lowers the barrier for the strong field , schwinger - type process .",
    "recent work by di piazza et al .",
    "@xcite claims that by tuning the frequency of the weak field , @xmath1 creation may be observable with presently available technology .",
    "another means to enhance pair production provides the so - called antenna mechanism @xcite , which is a three step process .",
    "first , an @xmath1 pair is created through the schwinger mechanism .",
    "second , the @xmath8 and @xmath9 oscillate in the laser field , and third they recollide .",
    "the pair has gained energy by accelerating in the field , and this energy becomes available for the creation of new particles upon collision . in the original study @xcite , @xmath1 pairs created by the collision of a heavy nucleus and laser beam were considered , and it was shown that high energy inelastic @xmath1 collisions are possible . in a recent paper by meuren et .",
    "@xcite , the recollision probability was found in the case of a single photon colliding with a strong optical laser pulse and was demonstrated to contain subleading dependence on the laser frequency @xcite .",
    "the complete antenna - type process can be written as @xmath10 where @xmath11 may be any of a number of particles .",
    "for example , @xmath11 can be an electron , in which case the last step in describes scattering @xmath12 . during this process",
    "the @xmath13 pair fulfils a transition from one adiabatic state in the laser field to another one .",
    "the antenna mechanism then provides an efficient exchange of energy between the pair and the field .",
    "another possibility is that @xmath11 is a photon , in which case describes high energy photon production , see figure [ feynman2005diag ] .",
    "ultimately , we will show that the antenna may accumulate enough energy for @xmath11 to be essentially any particle that interacts with electrons .",
    "the first transition in is a multiphoton transition by a strong field , and hence exponentially suppressed , in accordance with the schwinger result .",
    "however , the second transition is a non - adiabatic inelastic collision , and therefore exhibits only power - type suppression .",
    "this is the salient point : the creation rate is enhanced by replacing exponential suppression of the high energy particle @xmath11 with power - law suppression .",
    "process , with @xmath14 .",
    "the double lines represent the laser - dressed electron propagators ; wavy lines on the left represent low frequency laser photons , while those on the right represent high frequency photons . in the processes we consider , @xmath15 . ]",
    "an analogy with atomic physics is instructive .",
    "the analogue of the @xmath1 antenna in atomic physics is the atomic antenna originally proposed in @xcite and described semiclassically by corkum , and lewenstein et al .",
    "a laser wave ionizes an atom , accelerates the free electron , before colliding the electron with its parent atomic particle  producing high - harmonic radiation , multiple ionization and above threshold ionization @xcite .",
    "this is currently an area of active research @xcite .",
    "schwinger showed in @xcite that the probability rate per volume of fermion pair creation @xmath16 due to a static electric field of strength @xmath17 is @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the fermion mass . for large masses , this process is therefore drastically suppressed as compared with electron production .",
    "remarkably , the probability rate due to the antenna mechanism considered in our work is @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the electron mass , and the factor @xmath22 incorporates power - law dependence on @xmath23 . whilst the exponent in depends on the mass @xmath19 of a heavy particle ,",
    "the exponent in depends on the electron mass @xmath21 , and dependence on @xmath19 only appears preeponentially .",
    "in such a way , the probability is exponentially larger than . , where @xmath24 .",
    "] we also predict emission of photons with high frequency @xmath25 , whose creation rate is also described by , for which the exponent includes the electron mass and does not incorporate @xmath26 .",
    "we present formulae for the probability rates and spectra of the recollision processes , for laser frequencies @xmath27 and large adiabatic parameter @xmath28 .",
    "interaction between the @xmath1 pair and the laser field is included to all orders via the dressed fermion wave functions .",
    "interestingly , the preexponential factor @xmath22 , which determines the rate of @xmath1 annihilation , proves to be much larger than classical estimates anticipate due to the fact that the velocities of the created @xmath8 and @xmath9 are correlated along the direction of the laser electric field , enhancing the yield of quantum process @xmath29 compared to the classical estimate @xmath30 by a factor @xmath31 here @xmath32 is the adiabatic parameter , which is presumed large , @xmath33 , and the strength of the considered electric field is also small , @xmath34 .    section ii of this paper describes parameters of the laser field we consider .",
    "section iii presents the probability of @xmath1 pair creation .",
    "section iv derives the wave function of the @xmath1 pair created in a laser field , which allows us to derive the recollision probability in section vi .",
    "section v discusses the influence of photon radiation during the electron propagation .",
    "section vii presents an analytical estimate for the creation rates in section vi , which is then compared with numerical calculations in section viii .",
    "section viii presents the spectra and total creation rate for photons produced via recollisions .",
    "section ix discusses the possibility of muon production , and presents an approximation for the relevant creation rates .",
    "natural units @xmath35 are used .",
    "the electric fields considered below are presumed to be weak , @xmath36 a condition satisfied by the presently available laser fields @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we presume that the laser frequency @xmath37 is small , @xmath27 .",
    "the latter presumption implies that the creation process requires the absorption of a large number of photons .",
    "the behavior of electrons in the laser field is governed by an important dimensionless quantity , the afore - mentioned adiabaticity parameter @xmath38 . ]",
    "@xmath39 we consider @xmath37 and @xmath17 within the adiabatic limit , in which @xmath38 is large  as indicated on the right - hand side of ( [ xi ] ) ( and was mentioned in eq .",
    "( [ quantum - class ] ) ) . to illustrate how large @xmath38 may be , take the following numerical values as an example :",
    "@xmath40 and @xmath41 ( these are feasible for lasers currently being developed @xcite ) ; then @xmath42 .",
    "the electric field is supplied as follows .",
    "two laser pulses collide in the vicinity of some point we choose as the origin .",
    "the waves propagate in opposite directions , colliding head - on with equal frequency @xmath37 , identical linear polarization and intensity .",
    "we choose the reference frame in which the direction of propagation is along the @xmath43 axis , the electric field points along the @xmath44 direction and the magnetic field along the @xmath45 direction .",
    "in addition , we presume that the phases of the beams are tuned in such a way that the electric field reaches its maximum at the origin , while the magnetic field is cancelled there .    altogether ,",
    "these assumptions mean that we consider a linearly polarized standing wave that produces the following electric and magnetic fields @xmath46 it is shown in section iv that after the @xmath1 pair is created , it propagates along a trajectory close to the planes @xmath47 , @xmath48 , where the electric field is large . as a result , we may neglect the magnetic field , as per the right hand side of eq ..",
    "we shall summarize several important features of the @xmath1 creation process . consider the electric field .",
    "the slow variation of this field allows us to describe the probability of pair creation by a simple modification of eq .",
    "( [ schwinger1951 ] ) , substituting there the slow varying electric field instead of the static one .",
    "the exponential dependence in eq .",
    "( [ schwinger1951 ] ) on the electric field implies that the dominant contribution to the creation rate comes from those regions of space - time where the field reaches its maximum .",
    "this implies that the @xmath1 pairs are created mainly in the vicinity of planes @xmath49 .",
    "for convenience we will consider the contribution of the maximum located at @xmath50 .    to find the averaged probability rate of @xmath1 creation , we average the schwinger result ( [ schwinger1951 ] ) over the coordinates and time in the vicinity of @xmath50 , @xmath51 this approximation",
    "is arrived at by noting that a small deviation of @xmath43 and @xmath52 from zero results in a rapid decrease of the integrand , and so we may expand the field over @xmath43 and @xmath52 about @xmath53 , @xmath54 and extend the limits of integration to infinity .",
    "this technique is commonly employed in the theory of strong - field atomic ionization @xcite .",
    "altogether , this brings us to the final expression eq .",
    "( [ average - w ] )",
    ".    the momentum distribution of created @xmath1 pairs may be found in the amplitude that describes the creation of the pair .",
    "the calculation of this amplitude , which relies on the adiabatic , keldysh - type approach @xcite is outlined in appendix [ keldysh method ] .",
    "the adiabatic nature of the process allows one to express the amplitude @xmath55 of pair creation via the tunneling action @xmath56 @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a preexponential , @xmath59-independent factor , while according to eqs .",
    "( [ afroms ] ) and ( [ bfroms ] ) , the tunneling action reads @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the time dependent energy of the electron or positron oscillating in the electric field , which is defined in detail below , see eq . .",
    "( [ s(p ) ] ) it is presumed that @xmath62 , c.f .",
    "( [ bfroms ] ) . using this result ,",
    "the probability of the pair creation may be written as follows @xmath63 the exponential dependence on @xmath64 follows from eqs .",
    "( [ aexps ] ) and ( [ s(p ) ] ) , while the @xmath64-independent factor in the first line is determined by requiring the average creation rate comply with eq .",
    "( [ average - w ] ) such that @xmath65 equation ( [ momentumdistribution ] ) can also be verified using the results of marinov and popov @xcite , who considered the problem for arbitrary @xmath66 . in the limit @xmath67",
    ", their result reproduces the exponent of .",
    "the quantity @xmath64 which appears in eqs .",
    "( [ aexps ] ) , ( [ s(p ) ] ) and ( [ momentumdistribution ] ) , is the momentum of the electron at the moment of creation , @xmath68 .",
    "the positron momentum equals @xmath69 .",
    "the components of the momentum may take any values , positive or negative , though according to eq .",
    "( [ momentumdistribution ] ) very large momenta are suppressed .",
    "examination of the exponent in ( [ momentumdistribution ] ) shows that the component of the electron ( positron ) momentum collinear with the electric field is much larger than the momentum transverse to the field , @xmath70 additionally , the electron and positron polarizations may be described by spiral states i.e. eigenstates of the spin projection along the fermion momentum . in this representation ,",
    "the electron and positron must have opposite spin projections .",
    "this means the projection of the pair s total spin , along the momentum of one fermion , is zero . to verify this , recall that the adiabatic pair creation process in the homogeneous electric field can be understood , similarly to the static schwinger process , using an effective lagrangian which describes the influence of the field on the vacuum see e.g. ref .",
    "this lagrangian possesses only trivial quantum numbers .",
    "hence , the created pair can have only zero projection of total spin ( see also @xcite ) . by the same token ,",
    "the total momentum of the pair also remains zero , as we have already noted .",
    "the spin polarization of the @xmath1 pair leads to a slight , power - type suppression of the @xmath71 process @xcite that must be taken into account when calculating the total creation rate of the antenna process in section [ totalprob ] .",
    "in this section we calculate the wave function @xmath72 of the @xmath1 pair which is firstly created , and then propagates in the electric field , see section [ wavefunction of the pair ] .",
    "our derivation relies on the adiabatic and semiclassical approximations , which remain valid since the frequency of the field is small , @xmath73 .",
    "the desired wave function describes electron oscillations in the laser field , the magnitudes of which are of the order of @xmath74 .",
    "our objective is to describe the collision of the two fermions with high energy @xmath75 , which results in the creation of new particles .",
    "the collision takes place in the region of small fermion separations , @xmath76 , over which the function @xmath77 does not show substantial variation .",
    "accordingly , the @xmath1 collision can be described by the wave function @xmath78 , i.e. the wave function at @xmath79 .",
    "this is analogous to the known problem of the positronium annihilation , which is resolved through calculation of @xmath80 , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 pair undergo a collision , which produces new particles .",
    "generally , @xmath81 is a sophisticated function of @xmath52 , which distinguishes the present problem from positronium annihilation where the fermion wavefunction exhibits simple oscillations @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the total positronium energy .",
    "however , the complicated @xmath52-dependence of the wave function reveals itself only at large intervals of time @xmath84 , while the annihilation is a rapid process .",
    "hence , the only contribution relevant to the annihilation originates from the part of wave function that oscillates , at the moment of collision , with the frequency matching the frequency @xmath85 of the particles ( say , photons ) in the final state . to extract this term , we need to take the fourier transform , @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the fourier component of @xmath78 . in order to describe the creation of the final pair with energy @xmath88 we consider the fourier component @xmath89 , that is , the coefficient in front of the term exhibiting the necessary oscillations @xmath90 .",
    "we conclude that @xmath89 is the primary object of interest in describing the inelastic collision of @xmath1 pairs , with energy @xmath88 .",
    "we find @xmath78 in section [ saddle point approximation ] , and the fourier component @xmath89 in section [ fourier component of wavefunction ] .",
    "let us calculate the wave function which describes the created @xmath1 pair .",
    "the exact volkov wave function is not applicable in our case , because the laser standing wave considered is not a plane wave .",
    "however , we can derive a reliable approximation for the wave function using the fact that the electron ( positron ) momentum and energy greatly exceed the frequency of the field , @xmath91 .",
    "consequently , the motion of the pair in the smooth field can be described using the semiclassical approximation , which relies on the classical trajectories of the fermions . from the previous discussion",
    "we know that most of these trajectories are located in the region where the magnetic field is greatly suppressed , while the electric field is almost homogeneous .",
    "the approximation corresponding to our problem , of fermion propagation in a homogeneous adiabatic electric field , is detailed in appendix [ adiabatic approximation ] . from the appendix ,",
    "the single - particle wave functions are @xmath92 ( the superscripts , @xmath93 and @xmath94 , refer to the electron and positron states respectively ) .",
    "the electron ( positron ) energy @xmath95 is related to the electron momentum given by @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the vector potential @xmath98 . in",
    ", we took into account the fact that the classical momentum of the positron is opposite to that of the electron when they are created as a pair .",
    "the factor @xmath99 in is the dirac spinor , defined in appendix [ adiabatic approximation ] . at any given moment of time @xmath52",
    "this spinor may be considered as describing a plane wave with momentum @xmath100 and energy @xmath101 .",
    "its distinction from the conventional plane wave in vacuo is that its momentum and energy are slowly varying functions of time .",
    "overall , the representation of the wave function in ( [ psie ] ) complies with conventional machinery of the adiabatic description . as is usual , the large phase factor @xmath102 needs to be written accurately , incorporating integration over different moments of time .    to construct the wave function of the @xmath1 pair @xmath103 , which is created and then propagates in the laser field , it is convenient to interpret this wave function as the amplitude of transition from the vacuum state @xmath104 into the state @xmath105 , in which at the moment of time @xmath52 , the electron and positron have coordinates @xmath106 and @xmath107 . in other words ,",

    ", while the amplitudes of fermion propagation coincide with fermion single - particle wave functions @xmath115 combining eqs .",
    "@xmath116 , we present the wave function of the created @xmath1 pair as the following wave packet @xmath117 this result may be verified using simple properties of quantum amplitudes , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the amplitudes of independent events are multiplied , as per the three factors in the integrand of , while the amplitudes of interfering events need to be added , which is taken care of by the integration over momenta .",
    "it is convenient to rewrite the wave function of the pair using eqs . , and as follows , @xmath118 where @xmath119 the function @xmath120 is the spin part of the wave function ; @xmath121 is the projection operator that separates only those spin states of the pair , with zero spin projection on the direction of the pair propagation .",
    "the constant @xmath122 in is a normalization factor , into which we absorbed the factor of @xmath123 present in @xmath124 .",
    "we choose @xmath125 to ensure the conventional normalization @xmath126 the spinor part of this identity , @xmath127 follows from the chosen normalization of spinors in .",
    "the distance @xmath128 is the fermion separation .",
    "the first and second terms in @xmath129 , due to the wave functions , constitute the classical action which describes propagation of the pair in the external electric field .",
    "the third term in @xmath129 originates from the phase factor in @xmath124 , see and .",
    "we will discuss the physical significance of this term in the next section .",
    "summarizing , the wave function of the created @xmath1 pair is found in a simple , appealing form .",
    "we aim to evaluate the wave function of the electron - positron pair in a convenient form using the saddle - point approximation , the method of stationary phase , more specifically .",
    "the ratio between the fermion energies and the frequency of the laser plays the role of large parameter , which justifies this approach .",
    "the action @xmath129 in is a rapidly varying function of momentum .",
    "by contrast , @xmath130 and @xmath131 from and are slowly varying functions .",
    "the latter statement is obvious for the preexponential factors @xmath132 and @xmath133 , which appear in the spin part . at a first glance , the function @xmath131 incorporates a potentially dangerous exponential dependence on @xmath64 , which may induce rapid variations .",
    "however , this function in fact remains slow - varying , as shown at the end of this section .",
    "evaluating the integral at the saddle point , we find @xmath134 where @xmath130 and @xmath131 are taken at the saddle point , the location of which is given by the condition @xmath135 which leads to @xmath136 here @xmath137 index spatial coordinates , @xmath138 , while @xmath139 denotes the electron velocity and @xmath140 is the initial electron energy . in eq .",

    "this interpretation shows that the last term in eq .",
    "equals the separation between the fermions at the moment of creation , @xmath143 .",
    "this term in originates from the tunneling amplitude , so we conclude that the initial separation @xmath144 between the fermions is produced by the tunneling process , exactly analogous to the tunneling distance seen in multiphoton ionization @xcite .",
    "the existence of this initial separation is clear for the static electric field ",
    "a similar separation also appears in the present adiabatic case .    since the energy of the @xmath1 collision is large , the fermion annihilation takes place at small separations , @xmath145 , where the pair is described by the quantity @xmath146 . incorporating the condition @xmath79 into the classical trajectory , we observe firstly that the trajectory is aligned with the direction of the electric field @xmath147 otherwise , if the electron and positron had non - zero transverse velocities @xmath148 and @xmath149 , the fermions would drift apart .",
    "secondly , the @xmath44 coordinates of the electron and positron must be equal at some point on the trajectory , which implies @xmath150 where @xmath151 is the electron @xmath44 coordinate ( when the origin is defined as the midpoint of the electron and positron positions upon creation ) and @xmath140 is the initial electron energy . since @xmath152 and @xmath153 , we henceforth dispense with the subscript @xmath154 for vectors parallel to the electric field , for simplicity .",

    "this is different from the problems considered previously , when an electron is created in the vicinity of an atom @xcite , or when an @xmath1 pair is created near a nucleus @xcite , the fermions are created in the near vicinity of the atom / nucleus . in those cases ,",
    "the created particles possess well - defined coordinates , whereas in the present paper they possess well  defined momenta , leading to enhanced yields .",
    "those previous studies rely on semiclassical treatments in which the classical trajectories emanate from the coordinates of the atomic / nuclear particle , by contrast in the problem at hand one can not indicate any special coordinate responsible for the @xmath1 creation .",
    "hence from the very beginning the process required the coherent quantum description , making the problem more theoretically involving .",
    "we needed to construct and use the time ",
    "dependent wave function for the @xmath1 pair , which describes the amplitude of pair creation and its subsequent propagation within the whole volume exposed to the strong laser field .",
    "the coherent nature of the problem has a remarkable consequence .",
    "we found that it produces a strong boost for the probability of the recollision , and therefore provides a substantial additional enhancement of high energy particle production .",
    "this fact is demonstrated through the analytical and numerical calculations .",
    "the time dependent , many - body , quantum nature of the problem makes it rather involving .",
    "it is therefore surprising that it was possible to derive certain analytical statements .",
    "comparison between our analytic and numerical results is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ estimation ] , which presents the conversion coefficient for the gamma production ( number of photon pair per one @xmath391 pair ) versus the adiabatic parameter @xmath392 .",
    "the figure shows good quantitative and semi  qualitative agreement between the numerical and analytical results .    as is typical of the wkb  type semiclassical approach , the classical trajectories of the @xmath8 appear .",
    "we find that the necessary classical trajectories progress linearly along the direction of the electric field .",
    "this is unsurprising , as it is well  known that in quantum electrodynamics that the vacuum exhibits to the dichroism of the vacuum in quantum electrodynamics ; the vacuum predominantly absorbs light polarized along the direction of the electric field , which means that the @xmath1 pairs produced are similarly polarized @xcite .",
    "the numerical calculations show that the spectrum of emitted gamma quanta possesses two distinctive features .",
    "firstly note that the larger the adiabatic parameter @xmath393 , the larger is the energy available to each fermion in the laser field , @xmath394 . at the moment of collision , this large energy can be transformed into the energy of the emitted photons , so the spectrum includes higher photon energies as @xmath38 is increased .",
    "the lower limit on the photon energy is given by the electron mass .",
    "one ought to anticipate therefore an existence of a broad spectrum of photon energies @xmath26 emitted in the region , @xmath378 .",
    "our calculations support these expectations .",
    "secondly , alongside the smooth energy distributions of emitted photons there also exist much narrower , pronounced maxima in the spectrum resulting from the `` caustic  type '' collisions .",
    "the electron ( positron ) energy @xmath101 in the laser field is a function of time ; we found that the probability of the @xmath391 collision is boosted if at the moment of collision @xmath318 when the energy derivative turns zero , @xmath395 .",
    "the intensity , position , width and sophisticated shape of the resulting maxima in the photon spectrum depend on the intensity and frequency of the field , enriching the structure of the photon spectrum .",
    "the efficiency of the antenna mechanism must diminish with the increase of @xmath38 , since in the static limit the electric field can not put the pair on a collision course .",
    "interestingly , our calculations show that this decrease in @xmath22 is logarithmically slow , @xmath396 .",
    "this means that the antenna mechanism produces an intense flux of colliding @xmath391 fermions even at large @xmath38 , when the photon energy is high .",
    "the origin of this efficiency can be traced down to the focussing of the fermion trajectories along the electric field .    on the other hand ,",
    "the relevant cross section shows the standard power - type decrease with increasing electron energy .",
    "for example , for the photon production @xmath397 , which gives sizable suppression for high energy photon production . however , this feature is not unique to the collisions considered  it manifests itself similarly in any process where high energy @xmath1 collisions are present .",
    "qualitatively similar observations can be made in relation to the production of muon pairs . unlike the photon case",
    ", the @xmath398 pairs can be created directly , via the schwinger mechanism .",
    "however , the antenna - type production , via the intermediate @xmath1 pair , exponentially prevails over the schwinger process ; the ratio of the two probabilities is @xmath399 , which is enormous .",
    "the mentioned exponential enhancement does not remove all obstacles to the observing muon production in laser fields . despite the removal of the exponential suppression ,",
    "the process remains suppressed by the preexponential factor present in the cross section of the @xmath389 collision . even for small muon energies in the final state ,",
    "this cross section remains small @xmath400 , producing sizable suppression for the muon yield . for unpolarized muons , the cross section would contain the factor @xmath401",
    " it is the opposite spirality states of the @xmath8 and @xmath9 which introduce the additional suppression @xcite .    to cite some numerical values for the processes considered , take the case of gamma production and tune the field to the maximum value @xmath402 , which is on the border of the region allowed by the approximations considered .",
    "figure [ estimation ] shows that the coefficient of conversion reaches the value @xmath403 for @xmath404 .",
    "this is an encouraging result , as it greatly exceeds the rate of photon production in the collision of a laser beam and a nucleus @xcite .",
    "the calculated values of @xmath22 in fig .",
    "[ upsilonnumeric ] are encouraging .",
    "an electric field corresponding to a peak intensity of @xmath405 w@xmath406 , yields a schwinger - type exponential suppression of the @xmath1 creation rate of order @xmath407 , but can be compensated for by the comparably large four - volume of the focal spot of the laser @xmath408 , where @xmath409 is the compton wavelength i.e. even for small creation rates , pair creation is observable @xcite .",
    "larger laser focii , and other techniques such as the dynamical schwinger mechanism , may similarly compensate for the apparently small value of @xmath22 .",
    "moreover , the volume over which photons may be detected can be made much larger than the laser focus , since the photons may propagate outward away from the point of recollision , across distances much greater than the laser frequency .",
    "production of photons with energies @xmath410 100 gev seems plausible with the lasers of the future , with @xmath411 and @xmath412 .",
    "more immediately , observation of pair production can be made feasible at eli with @xmath371 and @xmath413 ( as suggested by their documentation @xcite ) ; the conversion coefficient can be of the order of @xmath414 , and the energies of the photons produced may reach @xmath415 25 gev @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath416 nonetheless presents a challenge for experimental observation . searching for possible enhancement , it is tempting to contemplate development of the approach presented here into the region of strong fields , @xmath417 .",
    "we do not make such an attempt here , but the appeal of such extension should be kept in mind for future studies . in such a region , the radiation reaction would most likely become significant , as @xmath418 , making avalanches of @xmath1 and @xmath281 cascades possible .",
    "the problem then resembles high  harmonic generation in a plasma , the plasma consisting of a swarm of pairs created by the strong field .",
    "the possible observations of the effects considered need certain experimental conditions to be satisfied .",
    "first of all , the laser intensity should be large while the laser frequency remains low to make the @xmath391 production probable and supply high wiggling energy for these fermions .",
    "hopefully , in the next generation of laser facilities these conditions would be satisfied .",
    "as mentioned previously , the parameter @xmath38 can be made very large in experimental facilities scheduled to be operational in the next few years , making our process capable of producing photons with energies of up to 25 gev and higher in the immediate future .",
    "secondly , the two colliding laser beams need frequencies , polarizations and phases to be tuned to produce a standing wave .",
    "it may be a challenging task , but the outcome looks very attractive . with the projected intensities and frequencies of laser beams , laser facilities of the next generation would plausibly be capable of studying @xmath391 collisions at energies close to , even exceeding 100 gev .",
    "we derive an approximation to the electron wave function , valid when the wave function varies slowly with respect to the field .",
    "consider the electron - positron pair creation by a periodic vector potential @xmath419 and corresponding electric field @xmath17 , which are aligned along the @xmath44 axis and satisfy @xmath420 let @xmath421 be the electron and positron wave functions  the subscript indicates the sign of the particle s charge ( i.e. @xmath116 for the electron and @xmath422 for the positron ) .",
    "the dirac equation reads @xmath423 introducing the adiabatic wave function @xmath424 substitution into the dirac equation gives @xmath425 and so @xmath426 is a solution if we neglect the partial derivatives of the spinor @xmath427 @xmath428 this is the content of the adiabatic approximation .",
    "we have solved the dirac equation as if the time - dependent field is at some fixed moment in time @xmath429 .",
    "the spinors @xmath427 are given by @xmath430 at any given moment of time @xmath52 the spinor @xmath427 can thus be considered as describing a plane wave with momentum @xmath431 and energy @xmath101 , as noted in section iv a. these wave functions incorporate the laser - fermion interaction to all orders .",
    "we choose the usual normalization of of one particle per volume , @xmath432",
    "consider the electron - positron pair creation by a periodic vector potential @xmath419 and corresponding electric field @xmath17 , which are aligned along the @xmath44 axis and satisfy and .",
