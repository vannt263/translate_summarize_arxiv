    "deep near - ir imaging surveys have revealed a population of extremely red objects ( `` eros '' ; elston , rieke &  rieke 1988 ; mccarthy , persson &  west 1992 ; graham &  dey 1996 ; hu &  ridgeway 1994 ; soifer et al .",
    "1994 ; dey , spinrad &  dickinson 1995 ; thompson et al .",
    "the nature of the extremely red population remains unclear .",
    "as it is defined largely by a single color , primarily @xmath12 , there is no certainty that it represents a uniform class of object , and it may contain contributions from galaxies , cool stars or substellar objects and active nuclei . the precise definition of an ero varies among the different surveys and depends on the particular bandpasses employed .",
    "most samples were defined by @xmath13 or @xmath14 .",
    "the present work is based on a somewhat different color system , that defined by the nicmos f160w bandpass and conventional kron - cousins r magnitudes .",
    "the nicmos f160w band is similar to the johnson h band filter and the @xmath15 color term is negligable for a flat spectral energy distribution ( in @xmath16 units ) ( m. rieke , 1999 , private communication ) . among the resolved objects there are reasonable expectations that there should exist stellar systems at redshifts such that the k - correction applied to an old or intermediate age population",
    "will produce very red optical to near - ir colors .",
    "alternatively even fairly modest extinction , when observed in the same redshift range , can produce very steep spectral energy distributions in the rest - frame near - uv and there are local examples of such objects among the dusty starburst population . the central issue regarding the nature of the resolved eros is to understand to what degree these two classes of objects contribute to the overall population .",
    "the earliest interpretation of the colors of eros were centered around the old stellar population hypothesis ( e.g. mccarthy , persson , & west 1991 ; hu & ridgeway 1994 ) and redshifts of 1 - 2 were inferred from their multi - band photometry .",
    "there are clear examples which support this interpretation , such as weak radio source lbds 53w091 at @xmath17 ( dunlop et al .",
    "1996 ) and near - ir selected object cl0939 + 4713b at z@xmath18 ( soifer et al .",
    "1999 ) , and a concentration of eros at @xmath19 ( liu et al . 2000 ) .",
    "graham and dey ( 1996 ) argued that the spectral energy distribution of hr10 ( hu & ridgeway 1994 ) is well matched by a dusty star - forming galaxy at @xmath20 .",
    "the detection of a strong sub - mm continuum from hr10 ( cimatti et al .",
    "1998 ; dey et al . 1999 ) provided conclusive evidence that some of eros , if not all , are dust enshrouded starburst galaxies with inferred star formation rates of @xmath21 at moderate redshifts ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "recent deep near - ir follow - up observations of the sub - mm sources detected with the scuba ( smail et al .",
    "1998 ) have suggested that two faint sub - mm sources may also be eros with @xmath23 ( smail et al .",
    "liu et al . have measured redshifts for several other eros and most of these are also in the @xmath24 range and some have moderately strong emission lines ( liu et al . 2000 ) .",
    "two important open issues concern the surface density of eros and the relative contribution of different classes of objects as a function of both color and apparent magnitude .",
    "we continue to lack statistically large samples of eros .",
    "the most recent systematic large survey , covering an area of 154  square arcminutes by thompson et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , has yielded six objects with @xmath25 and @xmath26 . to quantify the fraction of different classes of eros as a function of colors and magnitude ,",
    "larger samples are required . the ero surface density inferred from the thompson et al .",
    "survey is 0.04@xmath27 arcmin@xmath10 for @xmath25 and @xmath28 .",
    "depending on the k - band magnitude limit , @xmath29 color and possibly environment , the reported surface densities of eros range from @xmath30 arcmin@xmath10 , derived from several serendipitous surveys over small areas ( hu &  ridgway 1994 ; cowie et al .",
    "1994 ; beckwith et al . 1998 ; thompson et al . 1999 ) .",
    "there have been suggestions that eros tend to cluster , particularly , in regions around high redshift agns compared with blank fields .",
    "the large luminosities and ( admittedly uncertain ) space densities imply that these objects represent a singificant consitutent of the overall galaxy population and that their contribution to the overall rate of star formation is non - negligable ( e.g. liu et al .",
    "2000 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we present a sample of eros discovered using nicmos on hst while operating in the parallel mode .",
    "our combined nicmos / optical survey covers only 16 square arcminutes but it provides high spatial resolution and better signal - to - noise in the near - ir than most ground - based surveys .",
    "the images under discussion here were obtained with camera 3 on nicmos ( thompson et al .",
    "1998 ) using the f160w ( @xmath31 m , @xmath32 m ) and f110w band - passes ( @xmath33 m , @xmath34 m ) .",
    "the data were obtained in the parallel observing mode during the period from october 1997 to november 1998 , excluding the dedicated nicmos camera 3 observing campaigns .",
    "this allowed us to observe fields which are essentially randomly distributed over the sky .",
    "the sensitivity varies from field - to - field due to different integration times and background levels .",
    "the nicmos internal pupil adjustment mirror was set near the end of its travel , providing the best possible focus for camera 3 .",
    "the psf in the images is slightly non - gaussian , but well characterized by fwhm@xmath35 .",
    "we obtained four images per orbit , two each with the f110w and f160w filters .",
    "the field offset mirror ( fom ) was used to dither between two fixed positions @xmath36 apart in a direction aligned with one axis of the detector .",
    "in addition there were small inter - orbit dither moves executed for some of the pointings . the projected size of a camera 3 pixel is @xmath37 , giving a @xmath38 field of view for each image .",
    "a small area is lost in the construction of the final mosaic image .",
    "the nicmos camera 3 parallel program covered approximately 200 square arcminutes at high galactic lattitude in its 14 months of operation . in the present work ,",
    "we are limited by the amount and the depth of the visible - light data that we were able to collect for the nicmos parallel fields . as described below ,",
    "most of the nicmos f160w images easily reach f160w magnitudes fainter than 21 ( vega magnitude ) with high signal - to - noise ratios ( eg .",
    "20@xmath39 at h = 21.0 ) .",
    "thus , to detect eros at these depths requires 3@xmath39 r magnitude limits of 26 in our follow - up images .",
    "as the nicmos camera 3 field of view is only 0.722 square arcminutes , optical followup is quite inefficient .",
    "we used mcleod s ( 1997 ) nicred v1.7 package to linearize and remove the cosmic rays from the multiaccum images .",
    "median images were derived from more than 50 pointings and these were used to remove the dark and sky signals .",
    "even with the optimal dark subtraction , there remain considerable frame - to - frame variations in the quality of the final images .",
    "the individual linearized , dark corrected , flatfielded and cosmic ray cleaned images were shifted , masked and combined to produce final mosaic images . before shifting , each image was @xmath40 block - replicated and integer ( @xmath41 ) offsets were applied . in this way we avoided smoothing or interpolation of the data .",
    "the multiaccum process is not 100% efficient in rejecting cosmic ray events and so we applied a @xmath42 rejection when assembling the final mosaics .",
    "more details regarding the nicmos imaging reduction can be found in yan et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .    in table 1",
    ", we list @xmath42 surface brightness limits in the f160w filter for the fields where we have obtained optical data .",
    "the 50%  completeness depth in the in the shallowest field is approximately m(f160w)@xmath43 .",
    "thus our near - ir catalog is 100%  complete at the ero selection limit ( f160w @xmath44 as described below ) .",
    "we emphasize that our ero search is entirely limited by the depth of the optical images .",
