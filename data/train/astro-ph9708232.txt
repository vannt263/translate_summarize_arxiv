    "globular star clusters ( gcs ) are pressure - supported collections of between @xmath4 and @xmath5 stars which are usually associated with galaxies , although there is evidence that some clusters of galaxies contain a population of `` free '' gcs which are associated with the cluster potential as a whole and not any individual galaxy ( west et al .  1995 ) .",
    "individual galactic gcs are made up of stars with a single overall chemical abundance suggesting that they formed in a single star formation event .",
    "gcs typically have integrated magnitudes of @xmath6 making gc systems visible out to redshifts of @xmath7 , the approximate distance to the great wall galaxies .",
    "the shape of the gc luminosity function ( lf ) has been assumed to be universal , so the gc lf has been used as a distance indicator ( see harris 1991 for a review ) .",
    "however , recent work has suggested that the shape of the gc lf may depend on the metallicity of the gc system ( ashman et al .",
    "1995 ) and the details of stellar evaporation from individual gcs ( okazaki & tosa et al .",
    "1995 ) . because of the wide - spread use of gcs to determine distances to external galaxies , it is important to determine if gcs truly are the same from one galaxy to the next .",
    "this is best determined by studying the physical structures and stellar populations of gcs in nearby galaxies .",
    "the nearest large gc system outside the milky way galaxy is that of the andromeda galaxy ( @xmath8 m31 @xmath8 ngc 224 ) .",
    "m31 is located at a distance of 725 kpc ( @xmath9 , van den bergh 1991 ) so individual stars in m31 s gcs can be easily resolved with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) and large ground - based telescopes at sites with sub - arcsecond seeing .",
    "m31 s low inclination ( @xmath10 , hodge 1992 ) means that many of its gcs are not superimposed against the disk of m31 , making identification of gcs , and photometry of their stars , relatively straightforward .",
    "m31 offers a unique laboratory to study the outer regions of gcs . because of their small fields - of - view it is not practical to used ccds to obtain star counts in the outer regions of galactic gcs . beyond distances of approximately half the tidal radius , @xmath11 ,",
    "the projected stellar densities of the clusters are overwhelmed by random fluctuations in the background stellar number density ( innanen et al .",
    ". however , m31 s gcs have sufficiently small angular sizes ( @xmath12 to @xmath13 ) that both the cluster and the background can be imaged on a single large format ccd image .",
    "this eliminates the need to match photometric zero - points between the cluster and the background , which makes possible a more precise subtraction of the background light from the cluster light .",
    "the first study of the internal structures of m31 gcs was undertaken by battistini et al .",
    "( 1982 ) , who estimated core radii for several clusters .",
    "pritchet & van den bergh ( 1984 ) found that the surface brightness profile for g1 ( @xmath8 mayall ii ; the g - numbers used in this paper are from sargent et al .",
    "[ 1977 ] ) had an excess of light at large radii compared to the best - fitting seeing - convolved analytical king ( 1966 ) model .",
    "they did find that g1 was well fit by empirical king ( 1962 ) models with core radii of @xmath14 pc .",
    "crampton et al .",
    "( 1985 ) used seeing - convolved king ( 1962 ) models to derive core radii for nearly 500 m31 gcs .",
    "their values , however , are systematically @xmath1550% larger than those of battistini et al .",
    "( 1982 ) , despite the better seeing conditions of the crampton et al .",
    "( 1985 ) data set .",
    "bendinelli et al .",
    "( 1990 ) used ground - based data to produce seeing - deconvolved radial profiles for six bright gcs in m31 , but seeing and pixel scale limitations restricted them to resolutions of @xmath1503 , insufficient to resolve the cores of the clusters .",
    "still , their data suggest that m31 gcs have king - like profiles similar to those of galactic gcs .",
    "the core structures of some of m31 s gcs have been studied using the pre - refurbished _",
    "bendinelli et al .  (",
    "1993 ) detected a power - law density cusp in g105 using _ hst _",
    "s faint object camera ( foc ) images and a variety of image restoration and seeing deconvolution techniques .",
    "in addition , fusi pecci et al .",
    "( 1994 ) used similar methods to obtain half - width at half - maxima ( hwhm ) and half - light radii ( @xmath16 ) for thirteen m31 gcs from foc images .",
    "they found hwhms similar to the core radii of galactic gcs .",
    "their data , however , could not be used to find the tidal radii of these clusters because the point - spread function ( psf ) before the refurbishment of the _ hst _ overfilled the foc s field of view .",
    "cohen & freeman ( 1991 ) derived tidal radii for thirty m31 gcs by fitting seeing - convolved king models .",
    "although their fits to individual clusters were quite uncertain they did find a mean tidal radius for the m31 clusters  after adjustment for differences in galactic masses and rotation velocities  which was very similar to that of the milky way clusters .",
    "gcs do not exist in isolation but sit in the tidal field of a galaxy .",
    "any stars that evaporate from a gc by the galaxy will have velocity vectors similar to the velocity vector of the gc .",
    "this can result in the gc being surrounded by an extended halo of unbounded stars which move in approximately the same direction as the gc and have approximately the same velocity .",
    "this idea has been explored numerically by oh & lin ( 1992 ) who predicted that gcs could be surrounded by extended halos of escaped stars which can persist for up to a hubble time . the size and shape of such a halo can be influenced by the tidal field of the parent galaxy .",
    "evidence for extended halos has been observed in some galactic gcs by grillmair et al .",
    "in addition , grillmair et al .",
    "( 1996 , hereafter referred to as gaf ) have observed an excess of resolved and unresolved stars beyond the formal michie  king ( mk ) tidal radii of several gcs in m31 , as would be expected if extended halos were present .",
    "there has been some interest in determining the ellipticities of m31 gcs .",
    "pritchet & van den bergh ( 1984 ) measured an ellipticity of @xmath17 for the region of g1 with @xmath18 .",
    "spassova et al .",
    "( 1988 ) measured ellipticities for approximately two dozen gcs while a study by lupton ( 1989 ) suggests that the mean ellipticity measured in the inner 7 to 14 pc of a m31 gc ( @xmath19 ) is indistinguishable from the mean ellipticity of galactic gcs .",
    "in the outer 14 to 21 pc , however , the mean ellipticity of an m31 cluster is @xmath20 , greater than that of the galactic gcs ( @xmath21 ) and similar to gcs in the large magellanic cloud ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "baev et al .",
    "( 1997 ) found systematic differences between the shapes of m31 s disk and halo gcs .",
    "they found that the disk gcs are triaxial ellipsoids while the halo gcs are oblate or prolate spheroids , but cautioned that this is a preliminary result since the sample of halo gcs in their study is small compared to the sample of disk gcs .    the first color  magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) for gcs in m31 were for g1 by heasley et al .",
    "( 1988 ) and g219 ( @xmath8 mayall iv ) by christian & heasley ( 1991 ) .",
    "couture et al .",
    "( 1995 ) undertook a systematic study of five m31 gcs ( g11 , g319 , g323 , g327 @xmath8 mayall vi , and g352 @xmath8 mayall v ) with a range of iron abundances .",
    "unfortunately none of these ground - based studies were able to reach the level of the horizontal branch ( hb ) at @xmath23 .",
    "the first cmds constructed from _",
    "data were for g1 ( rich et al .",
    "1996 ) ; g58 , g105 , g108 , and g219 ( ajhar et al .",
    "1996 ) ; and g280 , g351 , and bo468 ( fusi pecci et al .",
    "these cmds were able to resolve stars one to two magnitudes below the red portion of the hb .    in order to study the stellar populations and structures of gcs in m31 we obtained deep _",
    "hst _ wide - field / planetary camera-2 ( wfpc2 ) images of two halo gcs ( g302 and g312 ) located @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively from the center of m31 along the southeast minor axis . our data is unique in that we have centered the gcs on the wf3 ccd in order to take advantage of the wfc s field of view to search for extended halos around each gc .",
    "we obtained deep _ v_- and _ i_-band images of two bright gcs , g302 ( @xmath26 ) and g312 ( @xmath27 ) in the halo of m31 .",
    "these data were obtained using the _ hst _ in cycle 5 program # 5609 .",
    "we used the wfpc2 operating at @xmath28c with a gain setting of 7 @xmath29/adu .",
    "table  [ table : obs_log ] lists the exposures obtained in each filter .",
    "exposure times were based on the central surface brightnesses of the two gcs as determined from ground - based observations ( holland et al .  1993 ,",
    "holland 1997 ) and chosen to avoid saturating the cores of the gcs .",
    "the total exposure times were 4320 seconds in the f555w ( wfpc2 broadband _ v _ ) filter and 4060 seconds in the f814w ( wfpc2 broadband _ i _ ) filter for each field .",
    "the data was pre - processed through the standard stsci pipeline for wfpc2 data .",
    "known bad pixels were masked , and geometric corrections were applied using standard techniques .",
    "g302 is located @xmath30 from the center of m31 ( a projected distance of @xmath31 kpc ) approximately along the southeast minor axis while g312 is located @xmath32 from the center of m31 ( @xmath33 kpc ) approximately along the southeast minor axis .",
    "each gc was centered on the wf3 ccd .",
    "we chose to locate the gcs on the wf3 ccd , instead of taking advantage of the higher spatial resolution offered by the smaller pixels of the pc ccd , for three reasons :    first , the tidal radii of g302 and g312 , as determined by fitting mk models ( michie 1963 , king 1966 ) to the surface brightness profiles of g302 and g312 derived from hrcam observations taken at the cfht , are @xmath34 ( holland et al .",
    "1993 , holland 1997 ) .",
    "therefore , each gc would occupy a significant fraction of the total field of view of the pc , leaving insufficient area to make reliable determinations of the spatial variations in the background stellar density .",
    "second , grillmair et al .",
    "( 1995 ) found evidence for extended stellar halos , extending to @xmath15 2 to 3 times the tidal radius , in several galactic gcs .",
    "recently , gaf and holland ( 1997 ) found weak evidence for stellar density enhancements out to @xmath35 in some m31 gcs including g302 and g312 . by centering the gcs on the wf3 ccd we ensured that as much as possible of any extended halos would be located on the same ccd as the gc itself .",
    "this enabled us to avoid systematic effects that may occur if surface brightness and stellar number density data are transferred between the pc and wfc ccds , with their different pixel scales and sensitivities .",
    "third , by locating the gcs at the center of the wf3 ccd we were able to use the wf2 and wf4 ccds to probe the stellar populations in the halo of m31 .",
    "these results are published in holland et al .",
    "( 1996 , hereafter referred to as hfr ) .",
    "having two background fields for each gc field enables us to differentiate between stellar number - density enhancements that are due to statistical fluctuations in the star counts from m31 halo stars , and those that are due to physical structures , such as extended halos of unbound stars , that are related to the gcs .",
    "photometry was performed on stars imaged by the wfpc2 s wide field ccds using the daophot ii / allframe software ( stetson 1987 , stetson 1994 ) .",
    "all nineteen images for each field were re - registered to a common coordinate system and median - combined .",
    "this eliminated cosmic ray hits and increased the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) in our data allowing fainter stars to be detected . in order to eliminate large - scale gradients in the images due to unresolved light from the gcs ( the gradient in the light from the halo of m31 was @xmath36 1% in both the g302 and g312 fields )",
    "a square median - filter was run over the combined image to produce a map of the large - scale gradients .",
    "this smoothed image was then subtracted from the combined image and a constant sky added back to produce a median - subtracted image .",
    "the size of the square median - filter was @xmath155 times the stellar full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) to avoid smoothing out structure in the stellar images ( e.g. stetson & harris 1988 ) . subtracting the median - filtered image resulted in a reasonably clean subtraction of the integrated light from each gc to within @xmath15 25 pixels ( @xmath37 25 @xmath37 9 pc ) of the center of each gc .",
    "this process is the digital equivalent of unsharp masking .",
    "the daophot find routine , with a find threshold of @xmath38 , was used to detect peaks on the median - subtracted image .",
    "we experimented with different find thresholds and found that @xmath38 excluded most of the mis - identifications of noise spikes and cosmic - ray events as stars at faint magnitudes while including almost all of the stars to the photometric limit of the data .",
    "find was able to reliably detect stars to within @xmath15 25 pixels ( @xmath15 25 ) of the center of each gc .",
    "artificial star tests showed that detections closer to the centers of the gcs than this were usually spurious .",
    "the resulting list of stellar candidates was used as input to allframe .",
    "allframe does simultaneous psf fitting on all the _ original _ images ( _ not _ the combined median - subtracted image ) to preserve the photometric properties of the data .",
    "the psfs used ( stetson 1996 ) were moffatians ( moffat 1969 ) with @xmath39 and a look - up table of residuals .",
    "the psfs varied quadratically over each ccd to account for variations in the form of the psf from one part of the ccd to another .",
    "only stars which appeared in at least seven frames for each filter were considered to be real stars .",
    "tests with different minimum numbers of frames showed that this requirement provides a clean cmd without significantly affecting the limiting magnitude .",
    "aperture corrections and photometric calibrations were performed in exactly the same manner as described in hfr .",
    "we adopted a distance modulus of @xmath40 , a reddening of @xmath41 , and interstellar extinctions from tables 12a and 12b of holtzman et al .",
    "these extinction values are dependent on the stellar spectrum . for a k5 giant",
    "the extinctions were @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "see hfr for a discussion of why these values were adopted .",
    "table  [ table : apcor ] lists the adopted aperture corrections for the wfpc2 ccds .",
    "we were unable to obtain reliable aperture corrections for the pc images of the g312 field due to a lack of bright stars in this field .",
    "photometry in this field exhibited an unusually high degree of scatter , although the stellar images appeared to be normal to the eye .",
    "as a result , we have not included this data in any of the analysis presented here .",
    "allframe s @xmath44 statistic represents the ratio of the observed pixel - to - pixel scatter in the psf fitting residuals to the expected amount of scatter given the noise properties of the data .",
    "values of @xmath44 which are significantly greater than unity indicate that the image was not well fit by the stellar psf and thus may not be a star . in light of this",
    "we discarded any stars with a final @xmath44 value of greater than 2 . in order to eliminate stars with poorly determined magnitudes we used an interactive approach based on the uncertainty in the calibrated magnitude .",
    "a plot of uncertainty vs.magnitude was made and a locus defined which corresponded to the expected photometric scatter at a given magnitude .",
    "any stars which were judged to have a significantly greater uncertainty than the typical value for that magnitude were discarded .",
    "visual examinations of the cmds and the wf images suggested that we did not remove any legitimate stars from our sample .",
    "we wish to stress that this culling was done _",
    "solely _ on the basis of the photometric uncertainty of each star , not on the star s location on the cmd or the ccd .",
    "mean photometric uncertainties for our entire culled data set are listed in table 3 of hfr .",
    "the mean photometric uncertainties , based on the formal photometric uncertainties returned by daophot ii / allframe , for the gc stars are listed in table  [ table : mag_errs ] of this paper .",
    "the complete set of calibrated stellar photometry for g302 and the surrounding fields is listed in table  [ table : g302_sample_phot ] .",

    "tables  [ table : g302_gc_sample_phot ]  and  [ table : g312_gc_sample_phot ] list the photometry for stars with @xmath46 of the center of g302 and g312 .",
    "the data is the same as for tables  [ table : g302_sample_phot ]  and  [ table : g312_sample_phot ] except an extra column , giving the distance of the star from the center of the gc , has been added .",
    "only the first ten lines of tables  [ table : g302_sample_phot ] ,  [ table : g312_sample_phot ] ,  [ table : g302_gc_sample_phot ] ,  and  [ table : g312_gc_sample_phot ] are published here .",
    "the full tables can be found on the aas cd - rom volume 9 .",
    "a total of 12,289 stars were found in the three g302 wfc fields while 3,355 stars were found in the three g312 wfc fields .",
    "there are 626 stars within @xmath47 of the center of g302 and 325 stars within @xmath47 of the center of g312 .      in order to determine the effects of crowding , as well as the efficiencies of our star - finding and photometry techniques , on our photometry",
    ", we undertook a series of artificial star tests .",
    "we used the following procedure to generate and recover artificial stars :    1 .   for each field we generated a series of artificial stars with @xmath48 colors based on the observed cmd and lf of the m31 halo stars .",
    "the artificial stars were added to each of the original images for a field .",
    "the total number of artificial stars added in each field was @xmath49% of the total number of stars in that field .",
    "3 .   the entire photometry process described in  [ section : data ] ( find / allframe / culling / matching ) was performed on this new set of images and the resulting photometry was matched against the original list of artificial stars for that field .",
    "this process was repeated until we had recovered approximately the same number of artificial stars as there were real stars found on that ccd .",
    "this process was performed for each ccd field .",
    "figure  [ figure : art_shift ] shows the relationship between the input magnitudes of the artificial stars and their recovered magnitudes for a typical set of stars , in this case using the wf2 field near the gc g312 .",
    "artificial stars with magnitude differences of more than @xmath50 mag have been omitted .",
    "this figure plots the magnitude difference as a function of the recovered , not the input , magnitudes of the artificial stars .",
    "this was done because the observed magnitudes of the real stars are the recovered magnitudes , not the actual ( or input ) magnitudes .",
    "therefore , figure  [ figure : art_shift ] can be used to directly determine the uncertainty in a star s observed magnitude .",
    "smirnov ( ks ) tests show that the distributions of recovered magnitudes for the artificial red - giant branch ( rgb ) and hb stars are the same at the 98.892% confidence level in the _ v_-band and at the 99.999% confidence level in the _ i_-band .",
    "the apparent excess scatter in the hb artificial stars is merely an artifact of the large number of artificial hb stars .",
    "table  [ table : art_shift_rgb ] lists the systematic shifts in @xmath51 and @xmath52 as well as the degree of scatter as a function of magnitude for the artificial red - giant branch ( rgb ) stars of g312 .",

    "these quantities are identical to those described by stetson & harris ( 1988 ) except for @xmath59 , which we defined in non - parametric terms instead of in gaussian terms .",
    "our reduction process has a slight tendency to underestimate the brightnesses of stars near the photometric limit of our data ( see column 4 of table  [ table : art_shift_rgb ] ) .",
    "this systematic shift is less than the internal scatter in the photometry and is smaller than @xmath60 mag for rgb stars at the level of the hb . therefore , we conclude that the systematic uncertainties in our photometric reductions do not affect the morphology of the cmds above @xmath61 .    figure  [ figure : art_rgb ] shows a cmd created from a set of artificial rgb stars added to the g312 wf3 image .",
    "the hb stars have been omitted in order to show the increase in the scatter in the recovered colors at fainter magnitudes .",
    "the amount of scatter seen at a particular magnitude is comparable to the amount of scatter seen in the cmd of g312 , which is believed to be made up of stars with a single metallicity .",
    "if the stellar populations in m31 gcs are analogous to the stellar populations in galactic gcs , then the observed spread in g312 s rgb is primarily due to photometric uncertainties .",

    "table  [ table : art_shift_hb ] and figure  [ figure : art_hb ] show that hb stars , because of the large color spread in the hb , can suffer badly from systematic differences between their input and recovered magnitudes .",
    "blue hb stars are scattered by as much as 0.5 mag .  in @xmath52 , while red hb stars have a tendency to be recovered at fainter magnitudes and redder colors than they really are .",
    "this tends to move red hb stars into the lower half of the rgb resulting in our star counts underestimating of the total number of red hb stars in the gc .",

    "g312 has a projected ellipticity of @xmath180 but there is considerably more scatter in the fitted position angles ( the standard deviation is @xmath181 ) than in the g302 position angles ( @xmath182 ) .",
    "this suggests that the observed projected ellipticity of g312 is primarily due to the stochastic placement of stars within g312 , variations in the stellar background of the m31 halo , and the intrinsic precision of the ellipse algorithm . running the ellipse task on a series of circular artificial mk gc models",
    "which were convolved with the wf3 psf suggests that seeing alone can produce ellipticities of between 0.01 and 0.02 at radii of between approximately @xmath183 and @xmath184 .",
    "this agrees with the fluctuations in ellipticity seen in figure  [ figure : g312_shape ] at these radii .",
    "while seeing has very little effect on the observed ellipticity beyond @xmath185 , artificial star tests indicate that stochastic star placement can introduce an uncertainty in the ellipticity of between @xmath186 and @xmath187 . in light of this",
    "we believe there is no evidence for g312 being elliptical in the plane of the sky .",
    "it is , however , possible that g312 is elongated along the line of sight .",
    "gaf have observed an excess of resolved and unresolved stars beyond the formal mk tidal radii of several gcs in m31 , as would be expected if the stars which evaporated from these gcs remained in extended halos around those gcs .",
    "another test for extended halos of unbound stars is to identify an asymmetrical overdensity of stars in two dimensions beyond the formal tidal radius .",
    "this has been done for some galactic globular clusters ( see grillmair et al .",
    "1995 ) using multiple schmidt photographic plates for each gc .",
    "however , it has not been attempted for the m31 gcs , where the gc , and the background , can be imaged on a single ccd .",
    "this eliminates possible systematic effects arising from comparing star counts across multiple fields .    to search for extended halos around g302 and g312 we looked at the two - dimensional distribution of stars beyond the tidal radii of each gc .",
    "the total background stellar densities around each gc were small ( @xmath188 for g302 and @xmath189 for g312 ) .",
    "we rebinned the stellar positions into `` super - pixels '' so there were enough stars in each bin to ensure that the poisson fluctuations in a bin would be small compared to the total number of stars in that bin .",
    "in order to compute the optimum binning size we assumed that all the stars on the wf3 ccd were part of the gc and that the gc could be approximated by a gaussian distribution of stars . it can be shown ( heald 1984 ) that for any gaussian distribution the bin size , @xmath190 , which maximizes the signal - to - noise in each bin , is given by @xmath191 where @xmath45 is the standard deviation of the gaussian and @xmath3 is the size of the sample .",
    "this technique provides a balance between the need to keep the bin sizes small compared to the width of the gaussian , and the need to have a large number of data - points in each bin to reduce poisson noise in the bin .",
    "since we are searching for overdensities of stars beyond the mk tidal radii of the gcs the assumption that a gc can be approximated by a gaussian will result in an underestimate of the bin size needed to maximize the signal - to - noise .",
    "we found that bin sizes of 32 pixels ( @xmath37 32 ) , approximately two to three times the computed optimal size for gaussians , provided the best signal - to - noise for our data .",
    "we smoothed the resulting binned data by convolving it with a unit gaussian with a dispersion equal to the bin size ( @xmath192 ) .",
    "the resulting stellar number density distribution for g302 is shown in figure  [ figure : g302_tail ] and the stellar number density distribution for g312 is shown in figure  [ figure : g312_tail ] .",
    "figure  [ figure : g302_tail ] shows an asymmetric overdensity of stars around g302 extending to at least twice the mk tidal radius .",
    "the coherence of the isodensity contours which lie beyond the tidal radius , but inside the background contour , suggests that the observed overdensities are not an artifact of the binning , smoothing , or contouring processes .",
    "the surface brightness profile of g302 ( see figure  [ figure : g302_sdp ] ) light beyond the tidal radius ( @xmath193 ) of the gc is in agreement with the asymmetric halo of stars seen in figure  [ figure : g302_tail ] .",
    "the surface brightness profile of g312 , however , is consistent with there being no light beyond the tidal radius ( @xmath194 ) .",
    "this is reflected in the lack of an extended halo of stars in figure  [ figure : g312_tail ] .",
    "the fact that an overdensity of stars is seen beyond the tidal radius of g302 , but not beyond the tidal radius of g312 , suggests that the overdensity is real and not an artifact of the analysis .    in order to determine if the observed halo surrounding g302 is real we applied our contouring procedure to the star counts from the wf2 and wf4 images in the g302 and g312 fields .",
    "figure  [ figure : bkgd_tail ] shows that no structures of comparable size to the halo around g302 are seen in any of the four background fields . to test whether a random distribution of stars could give rise to coherent structures which could be mistaken for an extended halo we constructed a series of random star fields with number densities comparable to those found in the g302 and g312 background fields .",
    "none of these artificial star fields showed evidence for coherent sub - structure .",
    "we also used mk surface density profiles to place artificial stars onto randomly generated star fields to see if the presence of a gc would bias our binning / smoothing / contouring process in favor of finding structure beyond the tidal radius when none was really present .",
    "none of these monte - carlo images showed any evidence for extended halos .    in order to quantify the orientation of the halo around g302 we computed the second moment of the distribution of stars beyond the fitted tidal radius . only stars with @xmath195 from the center of the gc",
    "were used to ensure that neither the gc or the edges of the ccd biased our sample .",
    "we computed the statistic @xmath196 where @xmath3 is the number of stars beyond the tidal radius and @xmath197 is the distance from the @xmath142 star to an arbitrary axis of symmetry for the gc .",
    "this statistic corresponds to the root - mean - square distance between the stars and the axis of symmetry so the value of @xmath198 will be at its minimum when the assumed axis of symmetry coincides with the true major axis of the distribution .",
    "the @xmath198 values for g302 and g312 , assuming a range of angles of symmetry , are shown in figure  [ figure : zeta ] .",
    "a second statistic , @xmath199 , gives a measure of the degree of symmetry in the distribution of stars about the center of the gc .",
    "the value of @xmath200 for a distribution depends on the shape of the distribution and the number of stars present . for a given distribution , the greater",
    "the value of @xmath200 measured the greater the deviation from a circular distribution of stars . for a perfectly circular distribution",
    ", @xmath198 would be the same for all angles resulting in @xmath201 . in order to determine the probability of getting the observed value of @xmath200 by chance from a uniform circular halo of stars around a gc we generated 10,000 sets of stellar coordinates and measured @xmath200 for each set .",
    "the stellar coordinates were randomly drawn from a uniform distribution of stars with the same size and number density as the field around the gc .",
    "this data formed the cumulative probability distributions shown in figure  [ figure : eta_prob ] . since the stellar number density in the g302 field is different from the stellar number density in the g312 field we computed separate probability distributions for the g302 field and the g312 field",
    "for g302 this analysis yields @xmath202 , which occurs at a position angle for the major axis of the extended halo of @xmath203 east of north .",
    "the cumulative probability distribution for @xmath200 in the g302 fields ( see figure  [ figure : eta_prob]a ) shows that there is only a 1.84% chance of obtaining a value of @xmath204 from a uniform distribution of stars .",
    "in contrast , the wf2 and wf4 fields near g302 yielded @xmath200 values of 3.5530 and 4.6618 corresponding to 38.47% and 20.62% chances respectively of occurring by chance .",
    "the orientation of the extended halo around g302 is @xmath205 to the west of the projected major axis of g302 as observed in the _ v_-band and @xmath206 west of the projected major axis for the gc as observed in the _ i_-band . in light of our inability to find coherent overdensities in any of the background images or simulated images , the results of our moment analysis , and the observed overdensity of stars beyond the tidal radius of the best - fitting mk model , we believe that the extended asymmetric halo around g302 seen in figure  [ figure : g302_tail ] is a real feature of g302 .",
    "since the probability of observing a given value of @xmath200 by chance depends on the number density of stars on the image we performed a separate series of 10,000 monte - carlo simulations for the g312 data ( see figure  [ figure : eta_prob]b ) .",
    "the resulting probability distribution indicated that the observed value of @xmath207 for the stars beyond the tidal radius g312 in the wf3 field had a 9.96% chance of occurring in a randomly distributed set of stars .",
    "the wf2 and wf4 fields around g312 have @xmath200 values of 9.6342 and 9.1801 respectively , corresponding to 27.65% and 30.73% probabilities of occurring at random .",
    "this , and the lack of a significant excess of stars beyond the tidal radius of the best - fitting mk models , leads us to believe that g312 does not exhibit any evidence for having an extended halo of stars .",
    "we are not , however , able to rule out the possibility that such a halo does exist and is aligned along the line of sight .",
    "figures  [ figure : g302_sdp ]  and  [ figure : g302_tail ] show that there is an excess of light and stars beyond the tidal radius of the best - fitting mk model for g302 . by computing the amount of mass beyond the tidal radius we can estimate the mass - loss rate for g302 .",
    "we converted our _ v_-band surface brightness profile for g302 to a projected mass profile using a mean mass - to - light ratio of @xmath208 solar units ( from dubath & grillmair 1997 ) .",
    "the total mass inside the mk tidal radius ( @xmath209 ) was @xmath210 .",
    "we estimated the total mass of g302 , by applying the mass - to - light ratio to the total integrated _ v_-band magnitude of g302 , to be @xmath211 .",
    "this gives a total mass of @xmath212 beyond the formal tidal radius of g302 .",
    "mass - segregation within a gc can result in @xmath213 increasing with radius so the total mass beyond the tidal radius that we derive here will be a lower limit on the true mass in the extended halo around g302 .",
    "if we assume an age of @xmath129 gyr and a constant rate of mass loss for g302 then the mass - loss rate required for the observed amount of mass to escape beyond the mk tidal radius is @xmath214/gyr .",
    "the relaxation time at the half - mass radius for a gc is given by ( spitzer 1987 )    @xmath215    where @xmath216 is the total mass of the gc in solar masses , @xmath16 is the half - mass radius of the gc in pc , @xmath217 is the mean stellar mass in the gc in solar masses , and @xmath218 is the estimated number of stars in the gc .",
    "following djorgovski ( 1993 ) we adopted @xmath219 .",
    "the half - mass radius obtained by fitting isotropic mk models to g302 is @xmath220 pc which gives a half - mass relaxation time of @xmath221 gyr .",
    "this yields a projected escape rate of @xmath222 per half - mass relaxation time .",
    "converting observed surface brightnesses to a deprojected mass profile involves solving an abel integral which contains the radial derivative of the surface brightness distribution .",
    "since the surface brightness data for g302 contains noise this inversion is inherently unstable .",
    "therefore , we chose to project the theoretical escape rates of oh & lin ( 1992 ) into the plane of the sky before comparing them to our observed escape rate .",
    "the oh & lin ( 1992 ) evaporation rates for isotropic gcs with ages of @xmath223 in the galactic potential then become @xmath224 to @xmath225 per relaxation time .",
    "this is comparable to the escape rate inferred from our data .",
    "this result further strengthens our claim that we have detected an extended halo of unbound stars around g302 .      using the methods described above we find that g312 has a mass of @xmath226 beyond its fitted isotropic mk tidal radius ( @xmath227 ) .",
    "the large uncertainty in the amount of mass beyond the tidal radius is due to the large uncertainties in the surface brightness profile at large radii .",
    "figure  [ figure : g312_tail ] does not show any evidence for an extended halo of stars around g312 so it is likely that the light seen beyond the fitted tidal radius in figure  [ figure : g312_sdp ] is due to low - level variations in the unresolved background light .",
    "alternately , it is possible that the use of multi - mass mk models would result in a slightly larger tidal radius .",
    "if we assume that the observed excess of light in figure  [ figure : g312_sdp ] is due to an extended halo of stars , then the mass - loss rate required is @xmath228/gyr , approximately 10% of the mass - loss rate from g302 .",
    "g312 has a half - mass relaxation time of @xmath229 gyr , so the escape rate per relaxation time is @xmath230 .",
    "this is consistent with oh & lin s ( 1992 ) theoretical values .",
    "however , the large uncertainties in our photometry near the tidal radius of g312 ( and thus the large uncertainty in our observed escape rate ) suggest that the observed escape rate is consistent with there being no observable mass - loss from g312 .",
    "hbk measured a heliocentric radial velocity of @xmath231 km@xmath232s@xmath233 for g302 .",
    "correcting for rubin & ford s ( 1970 ) 21 cm velocity for m31 ( @xmath234 km@xmath232s@xmath233 ) gives g302 a radial velocity of @xmath235 km@xmath232s@xmath233 relative to the center of m31 .",
    "this is one of the largest radial velocities observed for a gc in m31 , suggesting that almost all of g302 s space velocity is along the line - of - sight .",
    "this can only occur when g302 is near its perigalactic passage .",
    "since very little of g302 s space velocity is in the plane of the sky , and g302 is near its perigalacticon , g302 must be at approximately the same distance from us as is the center of m31 .",
    "this means that the distance measured on the sky between g302 and the center of m31 is the true separation ; so the perigalactic distance for g302 is @xmath236 corresponding to @xmath237 kpc assuming a distance modulus of @xmath9 for m31 .    in order to constrain the orbit of g302 we used a three - component model for the m31 potential .",
    "the disk was modeled by a miyamoto & nagai ( 1975 ) potential , the bulge by a hernquist ( 1990 ) potential , and the halo by a spherical logarithmic potential :    @xmath238    @xmath239    @xmath240    we adopted @xmath241 , @xmath242 , @xmath243 kpc , @xmath244 kpc , @xmath245 kpc , @xmath246 kpc , and @xmath247 km@xmath232s@xmath233 .",
    "these parameters were chosen by scaling the galactic values to the observed mass and diameter of m31 .    using this model , and the observed radial velocity and perigalactic distance of g302",
    ", we found that the orbit of g302 has an eccentricity of @xmath248 where @xmath249 is the apogalactic distance ( in kpc ) for g302 .",

    "if we allow 40% of g302 s space velocity to be in the plane of the sky then the orbital parameters become @xmath252 and @xmath253 .",

    "if this is the case , the orbital eccentricity for g302 is @xmath255 and the apogalactic distance is @xmath251 kpc .",
