    "3c  120 , known as broad - line radio galaxy ( blrg ) at @xmath1 , is classified as fanaroff - riley class i ( fr i ) radio galaxy based on the radio morphology .",
    "since the viewing angle of the jet is not as small as blazars ( whose jets are directed toward the earth ) , both thermal disk and non - thermal jet components are present in the broad band spectrum . in this",
    "regard , 3c  120  and also 3c  111 are ideal objects to investigate the disk - jet connection .",
    "for example , from long - term very long baseline array ( vlba ) and x - ray monitorings , x - ray dimmings are found to be followed by radio knot ejections @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is understood by a scenario that the disk materials suddenly fall onto the central black hole ( bh ) and then they are ejected as a jet ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is reported that three blrgs , namely 3c  111 , 3c  120 , and 3c  390.3 , showed blue - shifted fe xxv / xxvi k - shell absorption lines in the _ suzaku _ x - ray spectrum @xcite .",
    "this feature is interpreted as highly ionized gas outflow whose velocity is of the order of @xmath2 . since 3c  120 and 3c  111 are also detected by _",
    "fermi_-lat , these sources are ideal objects to study a physical link between accretion disk , ultra - fast outflow , and jet .",
    "indeed , @xcite performed detailed study of 3c  111 by using x - ray and vlba data ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "location of jet dissipation region is a long - standing matter of debate . to unveil this problem ,",
    "multi - wavelength light curve and high spatial resolution vlba images provide useful information . here",
    ", we show _ fermi _ large area telescope monitoring result , together with 230  ghz sub - millimeter array ( sma ) and 43  ghz vlba ones . based on the light curves and broadband spectrum from radio to mev / gev @xmath0 rays ,",
    "we show that jet dissipation took place at sub - pc scale from the central bh and mev / gev @xmath0 rays would be produced by synchrotron self compton process , rather than inverse - compton scattering of external photons from broad line region and dusty torus .",
    "details are described in @xcite .",
    "fig  [ fig : lc ] shows the _",
    "fermi_-lat , 230  ghz sma , and 43  ghz vlba light curves . after the _ fermi_-lat  detection , vlba light curve showed brightening . closed - up light curves between mjd  56100 and 56500 are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : lc2 ] .",
    "mev / gev @xmath0-ray emission is followed by core brightening and knot ejection .",
    "fig  [ fig : sed ] shows a broadband spectrum from radio to gev band .",
    "swift / uvot and xrt data points obtained during the gev flaring state are also plotted together .",
    "radio , sub - mm , and mev / gev fluxes are nicely fitted by one - zone synchrotron - self - compton modeling ( see section  [ sec : dis ] ) , while optical - uv and x - ray fluxes are obviously above the jet component and are reasonably represented by accretion - related disk model by @xcite .",
    "we first assume that the mev / gev @xmath0-ray enhancement and radio knot ejection event are physically connected . then , our observation ( the @xmath0-ray detection before the core brightening and subsequent knot ejection ) indicates that @xmath0-ray emission region is located inside the vlba core . from long - term x - ray and vlba monitoring over six years , @xcite derived the distance from the central bh to 43  ghz vlba core as @xmath30.5  pc .",
    "then , we can infer the location of the @xmath0-ray emission region from the time lag ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 days ) and viewing angle of @xmath6 as @xmath7 and @xmath8 pc from the central bh .",
    "mev / gev @xmath0 rays are thought to be produced by inverse compton scattering .",
    "there are three candidate photons sources ; synchrotron photons , photons from broad line region , and hot dusty torus .",
    "since the @xmath0-ray emission region is located far beyond the broad line region of @xmath9  pc , which is derived by reverberation mapping @xcite , we can safely neglect the contribution of blr photons as targets . by using reasonable parameter values ,",
    "we obtain @xmath10 , indicating that synchrotron self compton is favored ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) .    to derive the physical quantities , we performed sed modeling .",
    "see @xcite for the derived parameter values , but here we briefly summarize the important points . the ratio of comoving electron and magnetic field density is obtained as @xmath11 , suggesting almost equipartition .",
    "total radiated power estimated from sed modeling is @xmath12 erg s@xmath13 . given the observational fact that @xmath14 for agn jets @xcite , we obtain @xmath15 erg s@xmath13 . on the other hand , total power of accreting plasma @xmath16",
    "is estimated as @xmath17 erg s@xmath13 .",
    "hence , we obtain @xmath18 , meaning the jet launch is extremely efficient ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "finally , we mention a future perspective .",
    "next - generation x - ray satellite _ astro - h _",
    "@xcite is scheduled to be launched in 2015/2016 .",
    "ultra - high - resolution spectroscopy by micro - calorimeter sxs and simultaneous broadband spectral measurement by sxi , hxi , and sgd will provide new information about a physical link between accretion disk , ultra - fast outflow , and jet .",
    "in particular , highest sensitivity of sgd at 50600  kev will enable us to detect the jet component in soft @xmath0-ray band , as was detected by _ suzaku _ from centaurus  a core by @xcite .",
    "hence , simultaneous _",
    "fermi_-lat  and vlba observations are also complementary and allow us to precisely derive physical parameters ( such as electron distribution and magnetic field ) at the emission region by sed modeling .",
    "we presented six - year multi - wavelength light curve since the launch of _",
    "fermi_-lat  in 2008 august .",
    "under the assumption that mev / gev @xmath0-ray flux increase is physically connected by the subsequent vlba core brightening and knot ejection , we derived the @xmath0-ray emission region is located at @xmath7 and @xmath8  pc from the central bh . we conclude that synchrotron - self - compton process is preferred as a @xmath0-ray emission mechanism .",
