    "beginning more than ten years ago , we have performed an experimental study of the medium - heavy and heavy antiprotonic atoms using the slow antiproton beam from the low energy antiproton ring ( lear ) at cern .",
    "the main objective of our program was to obtain information on the neutron distribution at the nuclear periphery and to provide data useful for deducing the antiproton - nucleus optical potential parameters .",
    "two experimental methods were employed .",
    "first , using the so called `` radiochemical method '' we have investigated  @xcite the ratios of peripheral neutron to proton densities at distances around 2.5  fm larger than the nuclear charge half - density radius  @xcite .",
    "the method consisted in measuring the yield of radioactive nuclei having one proton or one neutron less than the target nucleus , produced after antiproton capture , cascade and annihilation in the target antiprotonic atom .",
    "the experiment yielded 19 density ratios ( proportional to the `` halo factor '' @xmath5  defined below ) , which were subsequently employed to deduce the shape of the peripheral neutron distribution .",
    "the second method consisted in measurements of the antiprotonic - atom level widths and shifts due to the strong antiproton - nucleus interaction .",
    "these observables are sensitive to the interaction potential which contains , in its simplest form , a term depending on the sum of the neutron and proton densities .",
    "the level widths and in a number of cases also the level shifts were measured for 34 antiprotonic atoms ( in some cases for different isotopes of the same element ) .    the rich harvest of the two methods employed which are sensitive to the neutron and proton density ratio and the sum of these densities , has allowed to derive a number of systematic conclusions on the nuclear periphery properties presented in a series of summary and analysis publications  @xcite .",
    "moreover , our data were used to determine the antiproton - nucleus optical model parameters through global fits of @xmath6  x - rays and halo factors  @xcite with a substantially larger and more precise database than employed in previous approaches  @xcite .    besides our summary papers , after the end of the antiprotonic x - ray ( ps209 ) experiment",
    ", we prepared more detailed reports , containing information on experimental procedures and their analysis for some cases studied  @xcite .",
    "the present article , dealing with @xmath7 and @xmath1 antiprotonic atoms , is the next in this series .    during the last years",
    "it was shown that properties of the @xmath7 neutron distribution can be correlated with a number of quantities in various fields .",
    "in particular the knowledge of the difference @xmath2  between the rms radii of neutrons and protons in this nucleus constrains the symmetry energy of nuclear matter and therefore is reflected in the neutron equation of state ( eos )  @xcite .",
    "the neutron eos models , in turn , are used to calculate the properties of neutron stars , such as their radii and proton fraction  @xcite . however , not only the first moments of the neutron density distributions , but also their shapes are of considerable interest , e.g. in the determination of the isovector potential parameter of the pion - nucleus interaction in nuclear matter  @xcite or in the calculation of the lepton flavor violating muon - electron conversion rate  @xcite .",
    "there is also a certain dependence on the radial neutron distribution in the proposed determination of the @xmath0  neutron rms radius through parity violating electron - nucleus scattering  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the @xmath2  value in @xmath7 was previously determined using hadronic probes ( elastic scattering , inelastic scattering exciting gdr ) , reported in refs .",
    "@xcite and discussed in  @xcite .",
    "there were also some attempts to deduce higher moments of the neutron distribution from the hadron scattering experiments  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , the ability of the medium - energy elastic proton scattering data to determine the neutron distributions was recently contested  @xcite .",
    "the measurement in @xmath1  offers other advantages .",
    "it is the only experiment that allows to see an even - odd isotopic effect in heavier nuclei , in this case due to the loosely bound proton in @xmath1 .",
    "one difficulty in the way of analysis is the calculation of the hyperfine - structure that is comparable to the strong interaction shift and broadening .",
    "after this is done , it turns out that the level shift in @xmath0  is repulsive ( as most of the lower shifts ) , but the level shift in @xmath1  is attractive .",
    "this finding is open to interpretation .",
    "here we pursue the view that it is related to a @xmath6n quasi - bound state , which is important in cases of loosely bound valence nucleons .",
    "the heavy antiprotonic atoms @xmath8pb and @xmath9bi were investigated during the experiment ps209 at cern in 1996 using antiprotons of momentum 106  mev / c .",
    "table  [ target ] gives the target properties and the number of antiprotons used for each target .",
    "the antiprotonic x - rays emitted during the antiproton cascade were measured by three high - purity germanium ( hpge ) detectors .",
    "two detectors were coaxial with an active diameter of 49 mm and a length of 50 mm ( relative efficiency about 19% and 17% , respectively ) , and the third one was planar with 36  mm diameter and a thickness of 14  mm .",
    "the detectors were placed at distances of about 50  cm from the target at angles of 13@xmath10 , 35@xmath10 and 49@xmath10 towards the beam axis , respectively .",
    "the detector - target distance was adjusted to obtain a good signal - to - noise ratio and to decrease at the same time the background produced by pions from the annihilation processes .",
    "more details concerning the experimental methods , the detector calibration and the data reduction may be found in our previous publications  @xcite .",
    "the strong interaction between antiproton and nucleus causes a sizeable change of the energy of the last x - ray transition from its purely electromagnetic value .",
    "the nuclear absorption reduces the lifetime of the lowest accessible atomic state ( the `` lower level '' , which for lead is the @xmath11 state ) and hence this x - ray line is broadened .",
    "nuclear absorption also occurs from the next higher level ( `` upper level '' ) although the effect on level energy and width is generally too small to be directly measured .",
    "the width of the @xmath12 level was deduced indirectly by measuring the intensity loss of the final x - ray transitions .",
    "the level scheme for the antiprotonic pb atom with the observables of the x - ray experiment is shown in fig .",
    "[ observ ] .    the x - ray spectrum measured with antiprotons stopped in @xmath8pb",
    "is shown in fig .",

    "those lines in the spectra that are not broadened were fitted with gaussian profiles .",
    "the lowest observable ls - split doublet lines @xmath13 , which are significantly broadened ,  were fitted with two lorentzians convoluted with gaussians ( fig .  [ voigt ] ) .",
    "the measured relative intensities of the antiprotonic x - rays observed in the investigated lead and bismuth targets are given in table  [ relat ] .",
    "these intensities were used to determine the feeding of the consecutive @xmath14 levels along the antiprotonic - atom cascade .",

    "table [ shiftt ] gives the measured shifts @xmath15 , defined by @xmath16 , where @xmath17 the experimental value for the transition energy and @xmath18 the energy calculated without strong interaction  @xcite .",
    "for the lead @xmath11 levels the shifts are clearly repulsive , whereas for bismuth the levels shifts are consistent , within the errors , with zero ( fig .",
    "[ isoef ] ) .",
    "however , as discussed in the next sections , there exists an additional repulsive shift due to the hyper fine structure . for the @xmath12 levels in lead the shifts are repulsive , as in the case of the @xmath11 levels , but the shifts are smaller",
    ". tables [ gamlt ] and [ gamut ] give the measured widths . as indicated above , the widths of the @xmath12 levels were derived from the intensity balance of transitions feeding and depopulating these levels .",
    "contributions of parallel transitions to the measured intensities were obtained from cascade calculations ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "the rates for radiative dipole transitions were calculated with the formulae given in ref .",
    "the auger rates were derived from the radiative rates and from cross sections for photoeffect using ferrell s formula  @xcite .",
    "the width of the levels @xmath12 are larger for @xmath1  than for @xmath0   ( fig .",
    "[ isoef ] ) .",
    "this is due to the hyperfine structure in bi , which will be discussed below .",
    "the analysis of the presented antiprotonic @xmath7 atom data is based on some assumptions that are briefly mentioned here and discussed below .",
    "we assume and show by a comparison with model calculations that charge , proton and neutron distributions in this nucleus can be well approximated by two - parameter fermi ( 2pf ) distributions : @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the half - density radius , @xmath21 is the diffuseness parameter , and @xmath22 is a normalization factor . in particular , calculating the neutron rms radius from the antiprotonic x - ray data sensitive to densities at distances around 1.5  fm larger than the half - density charge radius  @xcite , we extrapolate the experimental density well into the interior of the nucleus . as shown below ( sec .",
    "[ calc - mean ] ) , this assumption is in reasonable agreement with the density shapes calculated in terms of the mean field models .    in evaluating the observables of the antiproton - nucleus interaction the important question of the ratio of the annihilation probability on a neutron to the one on a proton arises . in the simplest nuclear optical potentials this ratio is given by the ratio of the imaginary parts of the effective scattering lengths , @xmath23 .",
    "the experimental determination of this quantity  @xcite gave @xmath24 .",
    "in spite of this observation , a value r=1 was assumed in the optical potentials proposed in refs .",
    "our analysis of the antiprotonic x - ray data , together with the radiochemical experiment , also indicated  @xcite a better consistency of these two methods when @xmath25 was chosen .",
    "therefore this value is also adopted in the present data evaluation , as discussed in the following sections .",
    "it is generally assumed ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) that the charge rms values are known for the stable nuclei with remarkable precision , about 0.3% . the same belief is often projected on the charge _",
    "distributions_. in fig .",
    "[ pbcharge ] we show ( as it was already observed in  @xcite ) that this is not the case for the radial distances where the antiproton - nucleus interaction takes place in @xmath7 ( about 7 to 10  fm away from the nuclear center , see below ) . in this figure",

    "the @xmath2  value of 0.16  fm differs by 0.01  fm from the previously published one  @xcite ; this is due to the updated value  @xcite of the electromagnetic proton rms radius used in the transformation from charge to proton densities .",

    "although this unphysical assumption is presently avoided  @xcite as leading to worse fits than the finite range potentials , we still pursue our data analysis using the batty prescription in its simplest form .",

    "[ batty ] , the batty - potential parameters were obtained before our antiprotonic atom data were available , ensuring the interpretation of the results to be independent of the interpretation tools .",

    "it was shown that the 90 data points from our ps209 x - ray experiments , together with 17 data points from the radiochemical experiment , determine an attractive and absorptive @xmath6-nuclear isoscalar potential , which fits the data well .    however , as the @xmath0  antiprotonic x - ray data were used in the determination of the friedman potential , we have tried to show in the analysis of the experiment with this potential what can be deduced on the neutron distribution of this nucleus on a more general ground . to this end",

    "it was shown in this paper that by an analysis based strictly on the experimental antiprotonic level widths one would be unable to propose meaningful limits for the @xmath2  value in @xmath0 . applying the batty potential with a pure `` halo shape '' of the neutron distribution ( @xmath32=0  fm ) leads to @xmath2=0.16  fm .",
    "the lowest limit of the interpolated halo factor would allow at most @xmath32=0.1  fm , i.e. @xmath2=0.20  fm , similarly to the @xmath110 uncertainty of the average @xmath2  value deduced from the hadron scattering experiments .",

    "a value for @xmath2  that is only 0.01  fm larger is deduced from the analysis using the friedman potential .",
