    "interpretations of astrophysical masers which involve the radiative transfer of the maser radiation are based almost entirely on the `` linear maser '' ( i.e. , the one dimensional ) approximation . in this approximation ,",
    "the paths of the rays of radiation within the maser are parallel , straight lines .",
    "this approximation is motivated by the recognition that the longest maser rays tend to dominate as a result of the exponential gain in the intensity with path length in the unsaturated regime . from an observational viewpoint , that the rays are nearly parallel",
    "is indicated by evidence that the angles into which the emergent maser radiation is beamed are quite small  as small as 10@xmath0 ster in some cases ( nedoluha & watson 1991 ) .    as an alternative to the extreme approximation that the masers are purely linear",
    ", the transfer of radiation in isolated spherical masers has been treated in a few investigations .",
    "although it is generally recognized that astrophysical masers are unlikely to be ideal spheres , spheres nevertheless serve as a convenient geometry with which to assess possible deviations from the linear maser approximation .",
    "the initial studies ( litvak 1971 ; goldreich & keeley 1972 ) demonstrated that the maser radiation becomes tightly beamed along the radii so that the rays are again nearly parallel .",
    "consequently , with increasing saturation the apparent sizes of these masers as seen by a distant observer become much smaller than the geometrical sizes .",
    "in these studies , the maser radiation was treated as containing only a single frequency and the thermal ( and any other ) velocities of the molecules were ignored .",
    "efforts to treat the full spectrum of the maser radiation and the thermal motions of the molecules in a spherical maser seems to have begun with bettweiser & kegel ( 1974 ) .",
    "the key aspect of the radiative transfer for masers that are not completely linear was recognized ",
    "the frequency dependence of the amplification of a ray varies with its direction of propagation . for spheres ,",
    "the amplification depends upon the angle between the ray and the radius vector .",
    "bettweiser ( 1976 ) concluded that the observable properties of spherical masers , such as the spectral line breadths and the apparent sizes as a function of frequency , may be sensitive to the details of the treatment of the frequency - dependent radiative transport .",
    "however , with limited computer capabilities , definite conclusions could not be reached in that investigation . to simplify the computations somewhat , emmering &",
    "watson ( 1994 ; hereafter ew ) then developed a series expansion method that is based on the knowledge that the radiation is beamed into small angles about the radii . despite the complications in the detailed treatment of the anisotropic , frequency dependent radiative transport , on the issues of main interest ew found ( a ) that the spectral line narrows and rebroadens as a function of the degree of saturation in essentially the same way as for a linear maser , and ( b ) that the variation in the apparent angular size as a function of frequency is negligible at frequencies within the spectral line where the flux is appreciable .",
    "speculation to the contrary on these issues has nevertheless persisted even including assertions of a specific behavior that the line profiles from disks and spheres rebroaden only to 1/@xmath1 and 1/@xmath2 of the thermal doppler breadth , respectively , instead of rebroadening to the full doppler breadth .",
    "the calculation of ew does employ an involved expansion proceedure and some reasoning is required to recognize that the results are accurate",
    ". the reasoning may not be completely clear to all readers . to remove these challenges to understanding that the key conclusions are valid ,",
    "we have now computed the spectra and images by solving the full equations without approximations .",
    "in addition to spherical masers , masers in the shape of thin disks and viewed edge - on also are treated .",
    "disk masers are , perhaps , more likely than spherical masers to occur in the astronomical environment .",
    "the results from the calculations with the full equations are described in this paper .",
    "the issues under investigation here are relevant for interpreting observational data .",
    "the observed breadths and shapes of the spectral lines of astrophysical masers can be used to infer information about the temperature , the degree of saturation , and the beaming angle of masers ( e.g. , nedoluha & watson 1991 ; watson , sarma , & singleton 2002 ) if the theoretical behavior of the profile is understood .",
    "it is striking that the spectral linebreadths associated with some of the brightest astrophysical masers ( the h@xmath3o maser flares ) are much less than the doppler breadths for the temperatures ( @xmath4 400k ) that are expected for the gas in the relevant environments .",
    "the images of astrophysical masers often are not identical when observed at different frequencies within the spectral line ( e.g. , gwinn 1994 ; moscadelli et al .",
    "2003 ) . establishing whether this difference is , at least in part ,",
    "a natural consequence of the radiative transfer is necessary when considering its significance .",
    "the relevant equations to be solved are given in section 2 .",
    "results of computations for the spectral line breadth and for the apparent angular size of the masers are presented in section 3 . as in the previous investigations ,",
    "the focus in the above discussion is on `` isolated '' masers  that is , on masers for which the seed radiation is due either to spontaneous emission or to isotropic continuum radiation that is incident from outside the masing region . in practice",
    ", some masers in the astronomical environment may be close enough to hii regions or other strong sources of continuum radiation that the radiation from one side dominates as the source of the seed radiation .",
    "calculations are performed in section 4 for this case , as well , and compared with the spectral line breadths and apparent angular sizes obtained for isolated spherical and disk masers .",

    "the @xmath30 for the linear and disk masers depend upon the assumed beaming angles and it is convenient to use other expressions for the saturation intensities in the calculations for these geometries . the geometry of the calculation is explained in more detail in appendix b.      for a linear maser , the foregoing equations are greatly simplified and , in the absence of spontaneous emission , the radiative transfer equation adopts the familiar form ( e.g. , goldreich & keeley 1972 ) @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the intensity that is propagating in the direction of increasing @xmath63 measured along the axis of the maser and @xmath64 propagates in the opposite direction .",

    "equation ( 9 ) follows from the foregoing general expressions when the integral over solid angles in equation ( 4 ) is performed by treating the intensities as constant within a solid angle equal to the beaming angle @xmath67 of the maser radiation .",

    "equation ( 10 ) is then used together with equations ( 6 ) and ( 8) to perform the numerical computations for the spherical maser .      to perform the integral in equation ( 8) over the angle that is perpendicular to the plane of the thin disk and to relate the result to a physical intensity which must have a finite angular extent ,",

    "incorporating @xmath76 into the definition of the saturation intensity is analogous to incorporating @xmath67 into the definition of the saturation intensity for the linear maser . with @xmath53 restricted to be in the plane of the thin disk , two of the integrations in equation ( 7 ) for @xmath81",

    "the term for spontaneous emission must also be interpreted as @xmath84(@xmath85 $ ] in order to incorporate the integration over the angle perpendicular to the plane .",
    "that is , equation ( 6 ) for the 3d geometry is effectively multiplied by @xmath76/2 to express it in units that are convenient for a disk .",
    "`` saturation '' reflects the importance of maser radiation for altering the population difference between the masing states , and hence the effect of the radiation upon @xmath86 in general , this depends upon the velocity @xmath35 of the molecule , and upon the direction and frequency of the radiation . as the benchmark for the degree of saturation of a maser , we adopt ",
    "r/@xmath87 = @xmath88 for disk and spherical masers as in ew .",
    "this quantity is the rate for stimulated emission ( divided by the loss rate @xmath15 ) for molecules with zero velocity at the edge of the masing region where the radius is @xmath89 . in practice ,",

    "the equations are solved by iteration . in each step , a new @xmath94 is chosen based on the @xmath68 that are obtained in the two most recent steps .",
    "this continues until @xmath95 and @xmath96 at all @xmath37 , @xmath44 , and angles in the computational grid change by less than a specified fractional amount  between successive iteration steps . we have , of course , verifed that the results that we present are insensitive to this fractional difference required for convergence , as well as to the number of grid points in @xmath37 , @xmath44 , @xmath97 , and in the angles @xmath39 and @xmath38 at which @xmath95 and @xmath31 are computed . in the computation for the disks , @xmath95 and @xmath31",

    "these values ( the `` grid '' ) are uniformly spaced , though the ranges of angles that are included are reduced to reflect the beaming of the maser radiation .",
    "the ranges of angles depend upon the location in radius at which @xmath95 and @xmath31 are being computed , as well as upon the degree of saturation of the model being considered",
    ". additional details about the geometry and about the computations are given in appendix b and appendix c.    two quantities must be specified at the outset of a computation to solve the foregoing equations for any of the three geometries    \\a ) the size of the maser expressed in terms of the number of unsaturated optical depths , that is , @xmath98 for the disk and spherical geometries and @xmath99 for the linear maser ( where @xmath91 is the length of the maser ) and    \\b ) the seed radiation parameter  either the external continuum intensity @xmath100 that is incident onto the outer surface of the masing region or the spontaneous emission term @xmath101 .",
    "we find that the results of computations performed with a specific external intensity @xmath100 and zero spontaneous emission differ negligibly from those performed with zero external intensity and with the spontaneous emission term @xmath101 set equal to @xmath102 in fact , they are indistinguishable except at the very highest @xmath103 for which we present the results in the figures .",
    "hence , we will give explicit results only for @xmath104 and various values of @xmath105 , but with the understanding that the results are applicable when spontaneous emission is the dominant source for the seed radiation and @xmath101 takes on these same numerical values .    to compare the behavior of the maser properties between the three geometries , the natural comparison is between computations for which the background radiation is the same .",
    "the background radiation is the same when the rates for stimulated emission ( with @xmath104 ) are equal when no masing gas is present  that is , when @xmath103 is the same for the three geometries in the limit where @xmath98 and @xmath106 hence , we compare computations for which @xmath100 is the same for the sphere and the disk , and those for a linear maser for which the @xmath107 is one - half of that for the sphere and disk .",
    "once @xmath100 is specified , the intensity of the radiation that emerges from the maser then depends only upon @xmath98 or @xmath99 . instead of designating our results by the values of  @xmath98 and @xmath99",
    ", we use the degree of saturation @xmath103 which is a measure of the emergent intensity . to summarize",
    ", the computations will be labelled according to their values of @xmath103 ( which substitutes for @xmath98 or @xmath99 ) and @xmath100 .    what are representative values for @xmath100 ?",
    "consider the 22 ghz masing transition of the water molecule which is observed and imaged extensively in a wide variety of astronomical environments .",
    "typical calculations ( e.g. , anderson & watson 1993 ; wallin & watson 1997 ) for the pumping rates yield @xmath108 . for @xmath109(@xmath110 s@xmath111 ) which is considered representative for these masers , then @xmath59\\simeq10^{-7}$ ] to @xmath112 .",
    "for spherical masers , no additional uncertainty enters due to lack of knowledge about the beaming angle .",
    "hence , @xmath113 @xmath114 for isotropic background radiation with brightness temperature @xmath114 .",
    "the effective value of @xmath114 is expected to be close to the 3k of the cosmic background . for the linear and disk geometries ,",
    "these expressions must be multiplied by the beaming angles  @xmath115by @xmath116 for the linear geometry and by @xmath117 for the disk geometry  to obtain the analogous estimates for @xmath100 and @xmath101 for these geometries .",
    "beaming angles for astrophysical masers are highly uncertain .",
    "ratios of ten for the length - to - width commonly are discussed ( for which @xmath118 and @xmath119 though the actual beaming angles may easily be smaller by a factor of ten or more . with the understanding that the spontaneous emission term can be replaced by an @xmath100 of the same magnitude without changing the results , we can then focus our attention on computations with @xmath120 , at least for applications with the 22 ghz water masers .",
    "analogous estimates suggest that this range is representative for other strong masers of methanol and 18 cm hydroxyl , though the range may be extended up to @xmath121 for the circumstellar sio masers .      the flux of radiation at frequency @xmath44  from a masing sphere that is seen by a distant observer is@xmath122 whereas that from an edge - on disk is@xmath123 and that from a linear maser is simply@xmath124 in terms of the intensities at the edges which propagate at angles @xmath39 relative to the radius vector ( or along @xmath93 in the case of linear masers ) , and where @xmath125 is the geometrical angular size of the maser .",
    "note that the flux @xmath126 is in units of the saturation intensity @xmath127 for the relevant geometry , and that the unsaturated optical depth parameter @xmath128 or @xmath129 depending upon the geometry .",
    "the behavior of the spectral line breadth of the maser flux as a function of the degree of saturation is one of the two main results of this investigation .",
    "representative results are given in figure 1 .",
    "there the spectral line breadth @xmath130  obtained by solving  @xmath131  @xmath132  for the maser flux from disks and spheres is seen to behave in essentially the same way as that from linear masers . as a function of the degree of saturation @xmath103 , the breadth first decreases as",
    "the maser becomes more intense but is still unsaturated .",
    "then , when saturation can no longer be ignored as @xmath103 approaches one , the profile rebroadens and ultimately reaches the full thermal doppler breadth just as occurs for linear masers .",
    "the rebroadening begins slightly later as a function of @xmath103 for the disk and the sphere .",
    "once it begins , however , the broadening is somewhat more rapid than for linear masers .",
    "although the maser profiles only approach the gaussian that has the breadth of the thermal gas velocities when the maser is saturated , the profiles can be quite close to gaussians with smaller breadths in the unsaturated regime .",
    "a useful quantitative measure of the deviation of the maser profile from a gaussian is ( watson et al . 2002 ) @xmath133^{2}d\\widetilde{\\nu}}{2\\widetilde{f}_{p}% ^{2}\\widetilde{\\nu}_{1/2}}%\\ ] ] where @xmath134 @xmath135 is the peak value of the flux which occurs at the center of the line profile , @xmath136 is the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of this profile , and ( @xmath137 are the parameters obtained in fitting @xmath138 to a gaussian using the least squares method .",
    "although @xmath139 can be small in both the saturated and unsaturated regime , the nature of the deviations from gaussian in the two regimes is different .",
    "the computed profile is more sharply peaked than a gaussian ( positive kurtosis ) in the unsaturated regime , but is less peaked than a gaussian ( negative kurtosis ) in the saturated regime . the deviation @xmath139 and the kurtosis k , where @xmath140 are shown in figure 2 for the three geometries .",
    "here , @xmath141 is the standard deviation of the distribution @xmath142 . certain observational evidence ( watson et al .",
    "2002 ; moscadelli , menten , walmsley , & reid 2003 ) indicates that the @xmath139 and @xmath143 for actual spectral lines are consistent with the predictions in figure 2 for spectral lines that have not been rebroadened by the effects of saturation .    as for linear masers ,",
    "the linebreadths for the disks and spheres tend to increase with @xmath100 when the maser is not fully saturated as seen in figure 3 . however , the behavior is relatively insensitive to @xmath100 . in all cases ,",
    "the line breadths are less than the thermal breadth and approach the thermal breadth as @xmath103 exceeds one .",
    "we calculate the apparent angular size as the region from which a distant observer sees one - half of the flux to be radiated .",
    "the goal is to show how the apparent angular sizes of the masers depend upon the degree of saturation and how , if at all , these sizes depend upon the frequency at which they are measured within the spectral line .    at a specific frequency @xmath44 , one - half of the flux  from a spherical maser is emitted within an angle @xmath144  that is found from equation ( 13 ) by solving @xmath145 from which it follows that the ratio of the apparent angular size  to the geometrical angular size is @xmath146 the apparent angular size based on the total power is found by performing the additional integration over frequency and finding @xmath147@xmath148 to give @xmath149 results of calculations for @xmath150 as a function of saturation and for @xmath151 as a function of frequency for representative choices of the saturation are presented in figures 4 and 5 for spherical masers .",

    "only the angular extent along the plane of the disk varies since the disks here are idealized as having zero ( or very small and constant ) thickness . for disks",

    "the apparent angular sizes can be obtained in a nearly analytic calculation . in the partially saturated regime ,",
    "the reasoning is more involved but still leads to a result that can be evaluated nearly analytically .    in figures 5 and 6 ,",
    "the normalized spectral line profile of the flux is shown to demonstrate that apparent angular sizes are relatively insensitive to frequency at frequencies where the flux is appreciable .",
    "significant variations in the sizes as a function of frequency do occur .",
    "however , they are only in the far wings of the line profile .",
    "the masers in the foregoing sections 2 and 3 are isolated .",
    "hence , the seed radiation is either the external , isotropic radiation background or the result of spontaneous emission within the maser .",
    "for some masers , it is likely that a strong continuum source is nearby and dominates as the source of the seed radiation . to obtain an indication about how the behavior of the spectral line breadths and angular sizes might be different from that of the isolated masers , we consider the idealized geometry where the radiation that is incident on the maser from the continuum source",
    "can be approximated as parallel rays .",
    "this idealization would be strictly applicable when the continuum source is small and far from the masing gas .",

    "similarly , the variation of the apparent angular size with frequency in figure 9 is unimportant at frequencies within the spectral line profile for which the flux is appreciable .",

    "in contrast , the calculations here solve the full equations that describe the rate equations and radiative transfer for the standard idealization for astrophysical masers . in that sense ,",
    "the solutions are `` exact '' . though the calculations do depend , in detail , on the intensity of the seed radiation  isotropic background radiation , a nearby continuum source , or spontaneous emission , the conclusions ( a ) and ( b ) above are independent of the type of seed radiation and of its intensity  at least within a plausible range of values for the intensity .",
    "it should not be surprising that the spectral line rebroadens with increasing degree of saturation in a way that is relatively independent of the geometry .",
    "the maser radiation from a disk or a spherical maser becomes highly beamed when the maser is saturated .",
    "highly beamed rays are nearly parallel , and are thus similar to those of linear masers where the rays are exactly parallel .",
    "all investigations to date of the above issues about the spectral line profiles and apparent angular sizes of masers with finite cross sections are based on the same idealized description as is used in our calculations .",
    "actual masing regions in astronomy probably deviate at least to some degree from these idealized conditions .",
    "velocity gradients , as well as variations in the composition and excitation may be present .",
    "the observed maser radiation may be a result of amplification by spatially separated components .",
    "the masing transition may consist of hyperfine components ( 22 ghz water ) .",
    "finally , @xmath182 and @xmath15 are approximations to the results obtained by solving a set of rate equations for the velocity - dependent populations of the non - masing , as well as the masing , excitation states of the molecule .",
    "the rate equations ordinarily involve non - masing radiative transitions ( usually infrared ) and collisional excitations .",
    "these processes may also cause velocity relaxation without a change in the excitation state of the molecule . in view of these complications ,",
    "the reduction of the rate equations to two - levels and phenomenological ( @xmath184 parameters provides a remarkably good description when it has been tested ( anderson &  watson 1993 ) .",
    "calculations based on the standard idealization thus provide benchmark results .",
    "the possibility can not be excluded that some of the additional complexities that may occur in actual astrophysical masers  which neither we nor others have investigated  will lead to deviations from these benchmark results .",
    "it seems unlikely , however , that the basic conclusion that rebroadening of a spectral line occurs until the full doppler breadth is reached will be altered .",
    "the observed spectral line breadths of maser radiation often are narrower than the thermal doppler breadths for the gas temperatures that are believed to be appropriate for the masing gas based on likely pumping schemes or other considerations .",
    "investigators are reluctant to accept the interpretation that these masers are unsaturated because their fluxes are relatively constant in time , because the inferred luminosities seem to require a high efficiency for the pumping , etc .",
    "the natural resolution is that the rate @xmath185 for stimulated emission of these masers satisfies @xmath186 the rate @xmath187 for velocity relaxation , as recognized long ago by goldreich &  kwan ( 1974 ) . in this regime ,",
    "the line breadth remains narrow as for unsaturated masers , but the gain ( linear with the length of the maser ) and the efficiency of the pumping are the same as for a saturated maser .",
    "the behavior of the line breadth as a function of the degree of saturation has been calculated with velocity relaxation for a linear maser ( nedoluha &  watson 1991 ; also anderson &  watson 1993 ) and explicitly shown to be the same as without velocity relaxation if @xmath187 is substituted for @xmath15 .",
    "although velocity relaxation has not been incorporated into the calculations of this paper , its effect on the line breadth is expected to be similar to that for the linear maser .",
    "we are grateful to a. ostrovskii and a. sobolev for help in finding the best iteration algorithms to use .",
    "we also acknowledge support from nsf grant ast99 - 88104 .",
    "in figures 10,11 , and 12 , we show examples of @xmath188 , @xmath189 and @xmath190 that are computed at the surface of a masing sphere that is radiatively saturated . in the calculations , quadratic interpolation is used for @xmath31 and @xmath68 near the symmetry points where @xmath39 or @xmath38 is equal to @xmath191 or @xmath192 degrees , and at @xmath44 and @xmath193 .",
    "to perform the computation with a disk or spherical maser for the intensity @xmath194 at radius @xmath9 propagating in the direction @xmath53 ( which makes an angle @xmath195 with @xmath9 ) and with frequency @xmath196 , equation ( 6 ) is integrated along the paths of the rays such as the ray shown in figure 13 .",
    "for example , at the integration step that is a distance @xmath63 along this path with impact parameter @xmath162 shown in figure 13 , @xmath197  from the previous iteration is evaluated at the location @xmath198 for the angle @xmath199 to compute the right hand side of equation ( 6 ) .",
    "after the intensities at @xmath9 for rays at a sufficient number of angles have been computed , the integral in equation ( 8) is performed to find @xmath30 at the location @xmath9 for the molecular velocity of magnitude @xmath37 that is in the direction @xmath200 shown in figure 13 . in turn , these values of @xmath201 are inserted into equation ( 10 ) for a spherical maser or equation ( 12 ) for a disk maser to obtain a new value for @xmath202 in the computation for a spherical maser , @xmath35 ordinarily is not in the same plane as @xmath9 and @xmath53 .",
    "the @xmath203 plane differs from the @xmath204 plane by the angle of rotation @xmath205 about @xmath9 as the axis of rotation .",
    "for the reader who might be interested in repeating our numerical calculations , here are a few details . in order to place more integration points near the center of the sphere ( or disk ) , where as discussed by , e.g. goldreich and keeley ( 1972 ) , there is a transition region between saturated and unsaturated , we distributed the points at radii proportional to @xmath206 . recognizing that the radiation is beamed",
    ", we distributed the angular points uniformly over the range @xmath207 with @xmath208 .",
    "thus , @xmath39 covers the entire angular range at the center , and decreases toward the perimeter and with saturation since @xmath209 increases with increasing saturation .",
    "the coefficient 0.2 in the expression for @xmath210 was chosen by trial and error .",
    "we also experimented with other forms for @xmath210 and for the @xmath97 dependence .",
    "we examined the choices which we adopted for the distributions of points in angle and in radius by plotting various distributions of the computed quantities after the fact .",
    "the equations were solved by cross iteration between the equation for @xmath68 and the equation for @xmath31 using the linear superposition @xmath211 to obtain @xmath68 for the next iteration step from the results of the most recent iteration step ( @xmath212 ) and the next most recent iteration ( @xmath213 ) step .",
    "we used @xmath214 for the first 15 iterations , @xmath215 for the next 15 , and @xmath216 for the subsequent iterations which typically number about 100 for high saturation ( with fewer interations for lower saturations ) to achieve the convergence criterion that the maximum change between iteration steps in @xmath68 and @xmath31 at any integration point be less than one percent .",
    "further tightening of the convergence criterion led to negligible change in the results .",
    "computations are performed first for a completely unsaturated case ( small @xmath98 )  where @xmath217constant is taken as the initial value for the iterations . for subsequent , larger values of @xmath98 ( where saturation may be important ) ,",
