    "in recent years a new generation of radio surveys has been released covering a large fraction of the celestial sphere down to flux density levels of a few mjy ( eg .",

    "the vast majority of the radio sources in these surveys are produced by active galactic nuclei ( agn ) powered by supermassive black holes in galaxies with a median redshift of @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "these dominate the radio source population above flux densities of 10mjy . below 10mjy",
    "the surveys contain an increasing fraction of nearby ( @xmath13 ) galaxies whose radio emission is fuelled by ongoing star formation @xcite . because radio surveys probe a wide range of redshifts , studying their global properties statistically ( eg . through radio source counts or luminosity functions ) provides a powerful constraint on the evolutionary properties of massive galaxies throughout the history of the universe .",
    "unfortunately , radio survey data alone are not sufficient to constrain the current models of radio source counts .",
    "these models are strongly dependent on the form of the _ local _ radio luminosity function ( rlf ) from which the measured source counts can be extrapolated via evolutionary models ( eg . * ? ? ?",

    "sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , @xcite ; 2 degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) , @xcite ; 6 degree field galaxy survey ( 6dfgs ) , @xcite ) provide a useful tool for calculating the local radio luminosity function , as they provide redshifts for thousands of radio sources in the local universe .",
    "the host galaxy spectra provide additional value in this context as they can be used to determine the physical cause of the radio emission from galaxies , thereby disentangling the star - forming galaxy population from the radio - loud agn .",

    "@xcite identified nvss radio sources in the 2dfgrs and derived the local radio luminosity function of both star - forming galaxies and radio - loud agn ; this will hereafter be referred to as the 2dfgrs - nvss sample .",
    "@xcite identified optical counterparts to first galaxies in the 2dfgrs ; this will hereafter be referred to as the 2dfgrs - first sample .",
    "both the radio - selected 2dfgrs samples cover a relatively small area of sky to redshifts of @xmath14 and predominantly comprise radio - loud agn .",
    "in particular the 2dfgrs - first sample detected relatively few star - forming galaxies as the high - resolution first survey resolves out much of the extended radio emission in the disks of nearby galaxies .",
    "@xcite identified nvss and first radio sources in the second data release of the sdss ; this will hereafter be referred to as the sdss - nvss / first sample .",
    "they optimised their radio - source selection via a hybrid method which used both the resolution of the first survey and the surface brightness sensitivity of the nvss survey .",

    "@xcite crossmatched the nvss catalogue with galaxies brighter than @xmath15mag . in the uppsala galaxy catalogue ( ugc ;",

    "galaxies in the 6dfgs - nvss sample presented in this paper lie at redshifts intermediate between the more distant 2dfgrs - nvss and sdss - nvss / first samples and the nearby ugc - nvss sample , in an effective sky area much larger than that of the 2dfgrs and sdss derived samples .",

    "in the brightest bins of @xmath9 the fractional luminosity function turns over below the radio power at which @xmath21 .",
    "it is probable that this turnover is caused by the normalisation of the fractional luminosity function ; a larger fraction of radio sources can not be measured at a given @xmath9 because nearly all available galaxies are detected .",
    "the turnover occurs at fainter radio powers in less luminous galaxies , this is probably because both less luminous galaxies and less powerful radio sources have higher space density .",

    "the function has approximately the same shape for all bins of @xmath9 though this breaks down above @xmath30 which is caused by the turnover in @xmath17 discussed in section  [ agnbiv ] .",
    "@xcite also found a ceiling in the bivariate radio luminosity - mass function of sdss - nvss / first galaxies at the 30percent level .",
    "we determine the dependence of @xmath31 ( the fraction of all galaxies that are radio loud ) on @xmath32 by scaling @xmath28 to remove the dependence on @xmath9 .",
    "the best - fitting scaling factor for @xmath33 is @xmath34 ; clearly , the probability of a galaxy to host radio - loud agn is a strong function of its @xmath8-band luminosity .    given that the majority ( @xmath35percent ) of the radio - loud agn in the 6dfgs - nvss sample reside in early - type galaxies , their total @xmath8-band luminosity should be close to or equal to their near - infrared bulge luminosity ( @xmath36 ) . assuming this , the @xmath8-band luminosities of these radio - loud agn are indicative of the black - hole mass of the galaxy via the @xmath37-@xmath36 correlation @xcite . the precise scaling",
    "is uncertain though , as it is unclear at this stage of the precise contribution from disks to the @xmath8-band luminosity of the radio - loud agn in our sample .",
    "an accurate derivation of the @xmath8-band bulge luminosity of all 6dfgs galaxies is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "accurate velocity dispersions will be measured from spectra of the 15000 brightest elliptical galaxies in the 6dfgs@xcite .",
    "we expect to detect about 30percent of these in the nvss ( see fig .",

    "in this paper we have derived a catalogue of 7824 radio sources from the nvss catalogue which have been observed in the 6dfgsdr2 @xmath8-selected primary sample .",
    "the main results of this paper are :    * the median redshift of all radio sources in the sample is @xmath38 , which is similar to that of the 47317 @xmath8-band selected galaxies from which the radio sources were selected .",
    "60percent of 6dfgs - nvss primary targets are spectroscopically identified as star - forming galaxies which form a much more nearby population ( @xmath39 ) and 40percent of 6dfgs - nvss primary targets are identified as radio - loud agn which form a more distant population ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "* star - forming galaxies and radio - loud agn have quite distinct distributions in the plane of radio power vs. absolute @xmath8 magnitude .",

    "many of the 208 radio - loud agn with iras - fsc 60@xmath46 detections also lie on the radio - fir correlation . however , these tend to have hotter iras 60 - 25@xmath43 m colours . the combination of the radio - fir correlation and the 60 - 25@xmath43 m colour as a means of agn / star - forming classification for radio sources agrees with spectroscopic classification for more than @xmath47percent of all galaxies , which is reassuring considering the differences in these classification techniques .",
