    "therefore , techniques for ground - state cooling that remedy the effects of stochastic driving from the thermal environment @xcite are fundamentally important @xcite . however , as regards attempts to realize the ground state of such an oscillator , even the @xmath0 dilution refrigerator is insufficient , unless the oscillator has very high resonant frequency ( ghz ) @xcite .",
    "thus , it is necessary to exploit laser cooling schemes ( or microwave techniques , etc .",
    ", depending on the system ) .",
    "lasers are employed in optomechanical cooling in two ways @xcite .",
    "one application is to measure the instant position of the oscillator .",
    "then , an appropriate friction force is exerted in order to reduce the oscillation amplitude ; this is known as cold damping quantum feedback @xcite , and the efficacy of this method depends on the measurement precision and the feedback loop quality @xcite . however , the second application is more interesting to us .",
    "it is based on that fact that , in some parameter regimes , the optomechanical interaction drives the cooling process automatically . the most extensively investigated interaction to generate this passive ( or self- )",
    "cooling phenomenon is _ dispersive _ coupling , which is named for the feature in which the mechanical oscillator displacement changes the resonant frequency of the optical mode .",
    "ground - state cooling involving such scenarios is valid only in the resolved sideband regime @xcite , where the mechanical resonant frequency is larger than the line width ( or the damping rate ) of the optical mode .",
    "thus , this phenomenon is also referred to as sideband cooling .    from a practical perspective",
    ", an unresolved sideband regime allows one to use small drive detuning and , thus , small input power .",
    "almost all the realized optomechanical systems with heavier oscillator functionality operate in the unresolved sideband regime @xcite , and a well - known example is the suspended mirrors of the laser interferometer gravitational wave detector @xcite . therefore , eliminating the considerable limitation imposed by the requirement for a resolved sideband for ground - state cooling would enrich the optomechanical toolbox in a meaningful way .    note that sideband resolution is not a stringent requirement in optomechanical systems with _ dissipative _ interaction , where the oscillator displacement changes the damping rate ( or line width ) of the optical mode @xcite .",
    "although works on that topic are relatively rare , the predicted cooling has been verified experimentally @xcite in an optomechanical system based on the michelson - sagnac interferometer @xcite .",
    "thus , the dissipative system is promising and merits further development . here , we show that this system also sheds light on the dispersive system problem , i.e. , ground - state cooling in the unresolved sideband regime .    in this study",
    ", we demonstrate that the dissipatively coupled oscillator in a hybrid optomechanical system comprised of both dispersively and dissipatively coupled oscillators cools not only itself , but also the dispersively coupled oscillator , which is coupled to the same cavity mode .",
    "importantly , both of the oscillators are in the unresolved sideband regime .",
    "thus , a solution to the difficult problem of cooling the dispersively coupled oscillator is provided .",
    "note that this approach is not the first reported technique of this kind ; however , the existing schemes for ground - state cooling in the unresolved sideband , such as cooling with optomechanically induced transparency ( omit ) @xcite , coupled - cavity configurations @xcite , atom - optomechanical hybrid systems @xcite , and the recently proposed scheme using quantum non - demolition interactions @xcite , require multiple driving lasers , multiple optical modes , high - quality cavities , and ground - state atom ensembles . compared with those methods ,",

    "is emphasized and exploited in the next section in order to evidence the validity of our scheme .",
    "we first specify the definition of dispersive coupling . in a typical cavity optomechanics setup , the cavity end mirror plays the role of the oscillator .",
    "displacement of this mirror alters the cavity length and , thus , the resonant frequency of the cavity mode ; this leads to _ dispersive coupling _ , which can be described by the hamiltonian @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the coupling strength , @xmath4 is the phonon annihilation operator , and @xmath5 annihilates the cavity - mode photons .",

    "it is quite interesting to note the similarities between these damping - like interactions . from this perspective",
    ", the ancillary oscillator serves as a medium in our scheme , and it is the input / environment mode that is essential for ground - state cooling . the ancillary oscillator plays a role similar to those of the ancillary cavities or ground - state atoms in the alternative schemes .",
    "next , we compare our scheme more closely with the omit scheme @xcite , which is analogous to electromagnetically induced transparency .",
    "the omit scheme uses an ancillary oscillator that is dispersively coupled to the cavity mode .",
    "its position spectrum is also embedded in the photon - number fluctuation spectrum .",
    "in addition , a significant imbalance between the two peaks of the position spectrum is necessary .",
    "therefore , the ancillary dispersive oscillator must also be cooled to the ground state . however , as this oscillator is coupled dispersively , cooling is only possible if the resonant frequency is larger than the cavity line width .",
    "this leads to an extremely large gap between the frequencies of the two oscillators . in our notation",
    ", this large frequency gap means that the requirement @xmath233 can not be satisfied .",
    "thus , another largely detuned driving laser would be required in order to introduce the driving laser beat note , and unexpected and harmful excitation of some modes of the real mechanical system could be induced .",

    "in this paper , we have proposed a new scheme for optomechanical cooling in the unresolved sideband regime , and we have verified this technique using both the quantum noise approach and exact solutions to the quantum langevin equations . the proposed scheme uses a dispersively coupled oscillator that is also in the unresolved sideband regime .",
    "this ancillary oscillator significantly modifies the photon - number fluctuation spectrum and , thus , realizes ground - state cooling in the unresolved sideband regime .",
    "therefore , the dissipatively coupled oscillator can cool not only itself , but also other mechanical oscillators coupled with the same optical mode .",
