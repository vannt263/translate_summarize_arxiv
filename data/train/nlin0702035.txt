    "a resonant bragg grating consists of a linear homogeneous dielectric medium containing an array of thin films with resonant atoms or molecules .",
    "the thickness of each film is much less than the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave propagating through such a structure .",
    "the interaction of ultra - short pulses and films embedded with two - level atoms has been studied by mantsyzov et al .",

    "this work demonstrated the existence of the @xmath0-pulse of self - induced transparency in such structures  @xcite .",
    "it was also found  @xcite that bright as well as dark solitons can exist in the prohibited spectral gap , and that bright solitons can have arbitrary pulse area .",
    "if the density of two - level atoms is very high , then the near - dipole - dipole interaction is noticeable and should be accounted for in the mathematical model .",
    "the effect of dipole - dipole interaction on the existence of gap solitons in a resonant bragg grating was studied in  @xcite ; details can be found in  @xcite .",
    "recent numerical simulations have yielded unusual solutions known as _",
    "zoomerons_.  @xcite the optical zoomeron was discovered and investigated recently @xcite in the context of the resonant bragg grating .",
    "a zoomeron is a localized pulse similar to an optical soliton , except that its velocity oscillates about some mean value .",
    "these works also contain careful construction of the underlying mathematical model , which is derived from first principles .",
    "recent advances in nanofabrication have allowed the creation of nanocomposite materials , which have the ability to sustain nonlinear plasmonic oscillations .",
    "these materials have metallic nanoparticles embedded in them  @xcite-@xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider a dielectric material into which thin films containing metallic nanoparticles have been inserted .",
    "these thin films are spaced periodically along the length of the dielectric so that the bragg prohibited spectral gap is centered at the plasmonic resonance frequency of the nanoparticles .",
    "we derive governing equations for slowly - varying envelopes of two counter - propagating electromagnetic waves and of the plasmonic oscillation - induced medium polarization .",
    "we find that this system of equations has the form of the two - wave maxwell - duffing model .",
    "we find exact solutions of this system and demonstrate that , in contrast to conventional @xmath0-pulses , they have nonlinear phase .",
    "we show that the stability of these solutions is sensitive to perturbation of this phase .",
    "we also study the collisions of these pulses and find that the outcomes of such collisions are highly dependent on relative phase .",
    "we consider a grating formed by an array of thin films which are embedded in a linear dielectric medium . in our derivation of the governing equations we follow  @xcite-@xcite ,",
    "wherein bragg resonance arises if the distance between successive films is @xmath1 , @xmath2  . to obtain governing equations we apply the transfer - operator approach , presented below .",
    "let us consider the ultra - short optical pulse propagation along the @xmath3-direction of the periodic array of thin films , which are placed at points @xmath4 ( fig.1 ) .",
    "the medium between films has dielectric permittivity @xmath5 .",

    "continuity conditions ( [ eq1a ] ) result in the following relations among these amplitudes @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the surface polarization of a thin film at point @xmath11 , which is induced by the electrical field inside the film .",
    "thus we find @xmath30 taking into account the strength of the electric field outside the films , we write @xmath31    if the vectors @xmath32 and @xmath33 are introduced , then the relations ( [ eq2 ] ) can be represented as @xmath34 where @xmath35  is the _ transfer operator _ of vector @xmath36 through the film located at point @xmath11 . in the general case",

    "the waves with these frequencies can not propagate in the grating .",
