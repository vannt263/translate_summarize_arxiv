    "the two - dimensional fluid turbulence represented during more than 70 years an active field of research ( see the review papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "it has many applications in different areas as fluid dynamics , meteorology , oceanography , fusion plasmas , superfluids , superconductors and astrophysics , in spite of the fact that it provides only idealized models for physical systems that are always three - dimensional .",
    "the two - dimensional turbulence has a self - organizing character , which is related to the invariance of both energy and enstrophy in ideal ( inviscid ) fluids .",
    "numerical studies of the decaying turbulence clearly show this property and the associated scaling behaviour @xcite , weiss1992 , @xcite .",
    "the enstrophy has a direct cascade ( to small scales ) , but with a complex evolution characterized by the presence of inverse cascade in isolated regions @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the energy has an inverse cascade ( to large scales ) that leads to the emergence of large quasi coherent vortices .",
    "the process of self - organization can continue until the coherent vortices reach the size of the system matthaeus1991 , @xcite .",
    "this behaviour was explained in the representation of point - like vortices by a negative temperature ( eduards1974 , @xcite , @xcite ) or by the property of self - duality of the associated field theoretical model ( spineanu2003 ) .",
    "the latter approach was extended to a model of planetary atmosphere and magnetized plasmas @xcite .",
    "this paper deals with the turbulent states and studies the self - organization during its initial stage , before the emergence of large coherent vortices of the system size .",
    "we show that trajectory trapping or eddying in the structure of the turbulence is the main physical reason for the strong nonlinear effects that are observed in two - dimensional ideal fluids .",
    "this conclusion is drawn from a study of the statistics of test particles ( tracers ) in turbulent euler fluids .",
    "this study is based on a series of recent results on the statistical properties of test particle trajectories in incompressible two - dimensional velocity fields .",
    "numerical simulations have shown that trajectories are complex , as they have both random and quasi - coherent aspects .",
    "a typical trajectory , shown in figure 1 , is a random sequence of long jumps and trapping events that consists of winding on almost closed paths .",
    "analytical methods that describe the statistics of these trajectories were developed @xcite , @xcite and used for understanding various aspects of turbulent transport .",
    "it was shown that they provide a very good description of the nonlinear effects produced by trajectory trapping or eddying and reasonably accurate quantitative results for the diffusion coefficients and for other statistical averages .",
    "the conclusion of these studies is that trajectory trapping or eddying leads to nonstandard statistics : memory effects ( represented by long time lagrangian correlation ) , strongly modified transport coefficients and non - gaussian distributions of displacements .",
    "it was also shown that trapping determines a large degree of coherence in the sense that bundles of trajectories that start from neighboring points remain close for very long time compared to the eddying time .",
    "trapped trajectories form quasi - coherent structures similar to fluid vortices .",
    "extensive theoretical @xcite-@xcite and numerical studies @xcite - beresnyak2011 have contributed significantly in the last decades to the understanding of the turbulent transport in laboratory or space plasmas , in fluids or in stochastic magnetic fields .    the connection between the test particle trapping and the turbulence evolution was discussed in @xcite based on a study of test modes on turbulent plasmas .",
    "analytical results that are in agreement with numerical simulations were obtained , and they allowed to deduce a new physical perspective on the nonlinear process of generation of large scale correlations ( inverse cascade ) and of zonal flow modes . essentially , they are effects of ion trajectory trapping or eddying .",
    "we show here that trapping has an essential role in two - dimensional fluid turbulence .",

    "the problem of test particle or tracer transport is defined in section 2.1 and section 2.2 contains a short presentation of the analytical statistical approach , the decorrelation trajectory method ( dtm ) .",
    "the effects of trapping or eddying on tracer transport and on the statistical characteristics of the trajectories are discussed in section 3 .",
    "this section contains a review of the previous work and new results on the modifications of the trajectory structures determined by an average velocity .",
    "the effects of trapping on the decaying two - dimensional turbulence in ideal fluids are analyzed in section 4.1 .",
    "the physical process that determines the separation of the positive and negative vorticity and leads to the inverse cascade of the energy is identified .",
    "the average speed of vorticity separation is estimated .",

    "consequently , the diffusion coefficient is a decreasing function of @xmath95 it means that when the decorrelation mechanism becomes weaker ( @xmath53 increases ) the transport decreases .",

    "this behavior is completely different from that obtained in stochastic fields that do not produce trapping . in this case , the transport is stable to the weak perturbations , because the lvc is zero for @xmath98 an influence of the decorrelation can appear only when the perturbation is strong such that @xmath99 and it determines the increase of the diffusion coefficient with the increase of @xmath95    the decorrelation can be produced for instance by the time variation of the stochastic potential , which destroys the lagrangian correlations at @xmath100 the transport becomes diffusive with an asymptotic diffusion coefficient that has the trapping scaling ( [ dtr ] ) , and thus it is a decreasing function of @xmath101 .",
    "this behavior is determined by the fact that a stronger perturbation ( with smaller @xmath102 liberates a larger number of trapped trajectories , which contribute to the diffusion . for other types of perturbations ,",
    "the interaction with the trapping process produces more complicated nonlinear effects . for instance , particle collisions lead to the generation of a positive bump on the tail of the lvc @xcite due to the property of the 2-dimensional brownian motion of returning in the already visited places",

    "the difference of velocities leads to the accumulation of the vorticity elements on the small velocity side and to the increase of the vorticity in that region . as the direction of the velocity on the contours of @xmath153",
    "depend on the sign of @xmath198the accumulation of the vorticity elements occurs on opposite sides for contours corresponding to @xmath153 and @xmath199  the time variation of the velocity field destroys the trajectory structures in a time of the order @xmath200 and the coherent displacements of the vorticity elements produce transverse average velocities .",
    "the average displacement @xmath201 along the average velocity @xmath3 is produced , as explained in section 3.1 , only by the free trajectories .",
    "they determine the elongation and eventually the splitting of the distribution of displacements ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "thus , the vorticity elements spread along @xmath3  while they have transverse drifts .     the average flows of the vorticity elements determine the modification of the vorticity distribution . due to the correlation ( [ cfiom ] ) , this changes the distribution of the stream function : the contour lines of the stream function follow the average motion of the vorticity .",
    "these findings are in agreement with the image provided by the numerical simulations ( see for instance @xcite ) , which show the emergence of large vortices that elongate and attract small vortices of the same sign .",
    "we note that the process analyzed here is different from the vortex drift transverse to a sheared flow analyzed in @xcite since it involves vorticity elements in turbulent flows and not localized vortices . in our case",
    "the drift is produced by an average velocity and the existence of a gradient of the background vorticity is not necessary .",
    "a vortex determines a velocity that has a gradient in the transverse direction .",
    "the gradient length is much larger than the correlation length of the stream function in the case of a large vortex in a small scale stochastic velocity field . in these conditions ,",
    "the effects of the gradient can be estimated using the dependence on @xmath34  of the statistical characteristics obtained at constant @xmath107     the transverse drift of the small structures with the same sign of the vorticity as the large vortex is in the direction of the gradient and brings the structure toward larger @xmath107 this determines the decrease of the transverse dimension of the structure and the increase of its elongation , as seen in figure 4 . when @xmath202 the small structures are destroyed .",
    "the fraction of trapped trajectories and the size of the structures decrease rapidly for @xmath203 their vorticity is included in the large vortex , and it leads to the increase of the large scale energy ( inverse cascade ) . on the contrary , the structures with opposite sign of vorticity drift toward smaller @xmath142 against the gradient .",
    "their size increases and their elongation is reduced .    in conclusion ,",
    "a large size vortex in a decaying two - dimensional turbulence attracts the small size vortices with the same sign of vorticity while the small vortices of the opposite sign are repelled .",
    "this effect of vorticity separation according to its sign is produced by trapping of the vorticity elements combined with the existence of the correlation of the stream function with the vorticity imposed by the nonlinearity ( [ voti ] ) .",
    "the nonlinear stage in the evolution of drift type turbulence is essentially a consequence of ion trajectory trapping or eddying in the structure of the stochastic potential .",
    "this conclusion is drawn from a study of test modes on turbulent plasmas @xcite , @xcite based on a new lagrangian approach that extends the type of methods initiated by dupree @xcite to the nonlinear regime characterized by trapping .",
    "drift waves are unstable due to the electron kinetic effects that produce the dissipation mechanism to release the energy , combined with the ion polarization drift @xcite . beside this",
    ", the polarization drift has a more complex influence determined by its nonzero divergence , which produces a weak compressibility effect in the background turbulence .",
    "test modes on turbulent plasmas were studied for drift turbulence in constant magnetic field starting from the basic description provided by the drift kinetic equations .",
    "analytical expressions are derived , which approximate the growth rate @xmath204 and the frequency @xmath205 of a test mode with wave number @xmath206 as functions of the characteristics of the background turbulence .",
    "these functions provide the tendency of turbulence evolution .",
    "the dispersion relation of the test modes in turbulent plasma is shown to be the same as in quiescent plasma , except for a time dependent function @xmath207 , which embeds all the effects of the background turbulence .",
    "this function appears in the propagator of the test mode , which is obtained using the formal solution of the ion equation with the method of characteristics .",
    "the characteristics are ion trajectories in the stochastic background potential .",
    "they are described by equations similar to eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) , with the difference that the potential @xmath153 is moving with the effective diamagnetic velocity @xmath3 , which leads to the replacement of @xmath208  with @xmath209  the function @xmath207 is evaluated using the dtm , and the dispersion relation is analytically solved .",
    "drift turbulence develops in the initial stage on a wide range of wave numbers .",
    "ion trajectories are not trapped at these small amplitudes of the background turbulence and they have gaussian distribution .",
    "their diffusion determines the damping of the large wave number modes .",
    "the correlation lengths @xmath210 remain close to the ion larmor radius @xmath211 during this stage .",
    "turbulence amplitude @xmath212 increases and the shape of the ec is not changed .    when the amplitude reaches values that make @xmath213 ion trajectory trapping appears and generates vortical structures of trapped ions as discussed in section 3.2 .",
    "they determine the decrease of the frequencies , which leads to the decrease of @xmath214 and to the displacement of the unstable range of wave numbers to smaller values .",
    "the maximum of the growing rate is displaced from @xmath215 to @xmath216 where @xmath217 is the average size of trajectory structures .",
    "turbulence amplitude continues to increase in this stage , but with a smaller rate .",
    "this determines the increase of the fraction of the trapped ions @xmath106 and of the size @xmath175 of the trajectory structures .",
    "large scale correlations are generated through a nonlinear process of decreasing the wave number of the unstable modes . in the same time",
    ", the diffusive damping produced by the free trajectories continues to act on the large @xmath218 modes , which are attenuated .",
    "this process of inverse cascade of turbulence energy stops well before the size of the potential cell becomes comparable with the system size .",
    "a different effect appears at larger trapping rates , which is also connected with trapping .",
    "when the fraction of trapped ions @xmath106 becomes comparable with the fraction of free ions @xmath219 ion flows are generated by the trapping process as explained in section 3.1 .",
    "trapped ions move with the potential , while free ions move in the opposite direction such that the total flux is zero .",
    "this determines the splitting of the distribution of ion displacement ( as in figure 2 ) .",
    "as shown in @xcite , an essential change of test modes is produced .",
    "the drift modes are damped and a different type of modes , zonal flow modes , are generated in this strongly nonlinear regime .",
    "they have @xmath220 and very small frequencies and are produced by the combined action of the ion flows and of the compressibility due to the polarization drift in the background turbulence .",
    "the damping of the drift modes is not determined by the zonal flow modes as generally believed .",
    "there is only an indirect contribution through the diffusive damping , which is increased by the zonal flow modes @xcite .",
    "the decay of the drift turbulence determines the decrease of @xmath106 and of the growth rate of the zonal flow modes , which is proportional to @xmath221 consequently , drift turbulence does not saturate , but it oscillates between weak and strong trapping .",
    "the predator - prey paradigm is not sustained by these results , although there is time correlation between the growth of zonal flow modes and the damping of the drift modes .    in conclusion , trapping determines in the first phase the increase of the correlation length by displacing the range of unstable modes to small @xmath222 in the second stage , when it becomes stronger and produces ion flows in the moving background turbulence , trapping leads to the nonlinear damping of the drift modes . in the same time",
    ", trapping combined with the polarization drift generates zonal flow modes .",
    "particle motion in two - dimensional incompressible stochastic velocity fields is characterized by a mixture of random and quasi - coherent aspects , represented by a random sequence of large jumps and trapping or eddying events .",
    "trajectory trapping generates quasi - coherent structures of trajectories .",
    "the development of statistical methods that are adequate for the description of such complex trajectories has contributed to the understanding of the nonstandard characteristics of the transport in these systems .",
    "various aspects of the turbulent transport were analyzed in the test particle approach using these semi analytical methods .",
    "these studies are now in a new stage that consists of developing lagrangian methods for the study of the evolution of the turbulence in the nonlinear regime .",
    "first results are reported in @xcite and in the present paper .",
    "they lead to the conclusion that trajectory trapping has the essential role in turbulence evolution .",
    "the physical mechanism depends on the specific nonlinearity of each system , but it is related to trajectory trapping .",
    "it appears that the quasi - coherent component of the trajectories determine the nonlinear effects in turbulence while the random component provides a damping or dissipation process .    _",
    "_  _ _ in the case of fluids , the trapped vorticity elements have an average motion , which leads to average velocities with the directions dependent on the vorticity sign .",
    "then , due to the correlation @xmath223  the stream function is also transported by the perpendicular average flows .",
    "the effect of this process is the separation of the vorticity with different signs since negative vorticity moves in the sense of the stream function gradient and positive vorticity in the opposite sense .",
    "a small gradient of the average velocity that characterizes a large scale vortex determines the decrease of the attracted small vortices and eventually the inclusion of their vorticity in the large vortex .",
    "this process determines the flow of the energy from small to large scales .    in the case of drift turbulence ,",
    "the trapped ions determine the displacement of the wave numbers of the most unstable modes towards small values , while the free ions contribute to the diffusive damping of the large @xmath224 modes .",
    "the correlation length of the stochastic potential increases until the process of nonlinear damping becomes dominant .",
    "ion trapping has an important role in this process and also in the generation of the zonal flow modes ."
