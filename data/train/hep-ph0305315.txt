    "a comparison of time - dependent asymmetries in @xmath139 and @xmath140 @xcite allows one to separate out strong and weak phases and relative tree and penguin contributions . in @xmath139",
    "the @xmath141 penguin amplitude is dominant , while the strangeness - changing tree amplitude @xmath142 is subsidiary . in @xmath143",

    "the u - spin subgroup of su(3 ) , which interchanges @xmath145 and @xmath78 quarks , relates each amplitude in one process to that in the other aside from the ckm factors .",
    "a potential problem with @xmath139 and @xmath64 is that the mass peaks will overlap with one another if analyzed in terms of the same final state ( e.g. , @xmath70 ) @xcite .",
    "thus , in the absence of good particle identification , a variant on this scheme employing the decays @xmath147 and @xmath148 ( also related to one another by u - spin ) may be useful @xcite . for these final states",
    ", kinematic separation may be easier .",
    "a further variant is to study the time - dependence of @xmath139 while normalizing the penguin amplitude using @xmath149 @xcite .",
    "the u - spin subgroup of su(3 ) allows one to relate many other @xmath2 decays besides those mentioned above to corresponding @xmath150 decays @xcite .",
    "particularly useful are relations between cp - violating rate _",
    "differences_. one thus will have the opportunity to perform many tests of flavor su(3 ) and to learn a great deal more about final - state phase patterns when a variety of @xmath2 decays can be studied .",
    "one promising method for tagging the flavor of a neutral @xmath1 meson is to study the charge of the leading light hadron accompanying the fragmentation of the heavy quark .",
    "this method was initially proposed by ali and barreiro @xcite to identify the flavor of a @xmath2 via the charge of the accompanying kaon .",
    "it was utilized in refs .",
    "@xcite to distinguish @xmath35 s from @xmath36 s .",
    "an initial @xmath0 will fragment into a @xmath36 by `` dressing '' itself with a @xmath151 .",
    "the accompanying @xmath78 , if incorporated into a charged pion , will end up in a @xmath80 . thus a @xmath80 is more likely to be `` near '' a @xmath36 than to a @xmath35 in phase space .",
    "this correlation between @xmath80 and @xmath36 ( and the corresponding correlation between @xmath152 and @xmath35 ) is also what one would expect on the basis of non - exotic resonance formation .",
    "thus the study of the resonance spectrum of the excited @xmath1 mesons which can decay to @xmath153 or @xmath154 is of special interest @xcite .",
    "the lowest such mesons are the p - wave levels of a @xmath155 antiquark and a light ( @xmath156 or @xmath78 ) quark .",
    "a new sensation has been reported by the babar collaboration @xcite and confirmed by cleo @xcite .",
    "partial information on the p - wave levels of a charmed quark @xmath159 and an antistrange @xmath160 consists of candidates for @xmath161 and @xmath162 states at 2535 and 2572 mev @xcite .",
    "these levels have narrow widths and are behaving as would be expected if the spin of the @xmath160 and the orbital angular momentum were coupled up to @xmath163 .",

    "if the @xmath167 states were fairly close to these in mass one would then expect another @xmath161 state and a @xmath168 state somewhere above 2500 mev . instead , a candidate for a @xmath168 @xmath169 state has been found around 2317 mev , with the second @xmath161 level around 2463 mev .",
    "both are narrow , since they are too light to decay respectively to @xmath170 or @xmath171 .",
    "they decay instead via the isospin - violating transitions @xmath172 and @xmath173 .",
    "they are either candidates for @xmath174 molecules @xcite , or indications of a broken chiral symmetry which places them as positive - parity partners of the @xmath157 and @xmath175 negative - parity @xmath169 ground states @xcite .",
    "indeed , the mass splittings between the parity partners appear to be exactly as predicted ten years ago @xcite .",

    "@xmath167 @xmath176 and @xmath177 states , lower in mass than the @xmath178 states at 2422 and 2459 mev @xcite but quite broad since their respective @xmath179 and @xmath180 channels will be open . the study of such states will be of great interest since the properties of the corresponding @xmath1-flavored states will be useful in tagging the flavor of neutral @xmath1 mesons , as noted in the previous subsection .",
    "if a strange antiquark can bind to a charmed quark in both negative- and positive - parity states , the same must be true for a strange antiquark and a @xmath0 quark .",
    "one should then expect to see narrow @xmath182 and @xmath177 states with the quantum numbers of @xmath183 and @xmath184 but below those respective thresholds .",
    "they should decay to @xmath185 and @xmath186 , respectively . to see such decays",
    "one will need a multi - purpose detector with good charged particle and @xmath187 identification !",
    "such detectors are envisioned for both the tevatron @xcite and the lhc @xcite .",
    "might there be heavier quarks visible at hadron colliders ? at present we have evidence for three families of quarks and leptons belonging to 16-dimensional multiplets of the grand unified group so(10 ) ( counting right - handed neutrinos as a reasonable explanation of the observed oscillations between different flavors of neutrinos ) .",
    "now , just as so(10 ) was pieced together from multiplets of su(5 ) with dimensions 1 , 5 , and 10 , we can imagine a still larger grand unified group whose smallest representation contains the 16-dimensional so(10 ) spinor .",
    "such a group is the exceptional group e@xmath189 @xcite .",
    "its smallest representation , of dimension 27 , contains a 16-dimensional spinor , a 10-dimensional vector , and a singlet of so(10 ) .",
    "the 10-dimensional vector contains vector - like isosinglet quarks `` @xmath190 '' and antiquarks @xmath191 of charge @xmath192 and isodoublet leptons .",
    "the so(10 ) singlets are candidates for sterile neutrinos , one for each family .",
    "the new exotic @xmath190 quarks can mix with the @xmath0 quark and push its mass down with respect to the top quark @xcite .",
    "troy andre and i are currently looking at signatures of @xmath193 production in hadron colliders , with an eye to either setting lower mass limits or seeing such quarks through their decays to @xmath194 , @xmath195 , and possibly @xmath196 .",
    "the @xmath197 , for example , would be identified by its decays to @xmath198 , @xmath199 , or jet @xmath200 jet , while the higgs boson would show up through its @xmath201 decay if it were far enough below @xmath32 threshold .",
    "the process @xmath56 has provided spectacular confirmation of the kobayashi - maskawa theory of cp violation , measuring @xmath100 to a few degrees .",
    "now one is entering the territory of more difficult measurements .",
    "the decay @xmath64 has great potential for giving useful information on @xmath106 .",
    "one needs either a measurement of @xmath202 @xcite , probably at the @xmath75 level ( present limits @xcite are several times that ) , or a better estimate of the tree amplitude from @xmath203 @xcite .",
    "indeed , such an estimate has been presented recently @xcite .",
    "the babar and belle experimental cp asymmetries @xcite will eventually converge to one another , as did the initial measurements of @xmath204 using @xmath56 .",
    "the @xmath205 decay can display new physics via special @xmath206 operators or effects on the @xmath207 penguin .",
    "some features of any new amplitude can be extracted from the data in a model - independent way if one uses both rate and asymmetry information @xcite . while the effective value of @xmath204 in @xmath208 seems to differ from its expected value by more than @xmath209",
    ", cp asymmetries in @xmath210 do not seem anomalous .",
    "the rate for @xmath211 is not a problem for the standard model if one allows for a modest flavor - singlet penguin contribution in addition to the standard penguin amplitude .",
    "the cp asymmetries for this process are in accord with the expectations of the standard model at the @xmath212 level or better .",
    "effects of the singlet penguin amplitude may also be visible elsewhere , for example in @xmath213 .",
    "various ratios of @xmath214 rates , when combined with information on cp asymmetries , show promise for constraining phases in the ckm matrix .",
    "these tests have shown a steady improvement in accuracy since the asymmetric @xmath1 factories have been operating .",
    "one expects further progress as instantaneous and accumulated @xmath215 luminosities increase , and as hadron colliders begin to provide important contributions .",
    "the decays @xmath216 and @xmath217 show promise for displaying large cp asymmetries @xcite since they involve contributions of different amplitudes with comparable magnitudes .",
    "rare decays of nonstrange and strange @xmath1 s involving photons or lepton pairs are beginning to be studied in detail , and the lhc will be able to look for the rare and interesting @xmath116 decay which can greatly exceed its standard model value in some theories . in the near term the prospects for learning about the @xmath2@xmath40 mixing amplitude are good .",
    "one hopes that this will be an early prize of run ii at the tevatron .",
    "the study of cp violation and branching ratios in @xmath2 decays will be an almost exclusive province of hadron colliders , whose potentialities will be limited only by the versatility of detectors .",
    "surprises in spectroscopy , as illustrated by the low - lying positive - parity @xmath169 candidiates , still can occur , and one is sure to find more surprises at the tevatron and the lhc .",
    "finally , one can search for objects related to the properties of @xmath0 quarks , such as the exotic isosinglet quarks @xmath190 , with improved sensitivity in run ii of the tevatron and with greatly expanded reach at the lhc .",
