    "recently synchronization phenomena in coupled chaotic oscillators have been extensively studied because of their fundamental importance in areas of science and technology such as laser dynamics , electronic circuits , and biological systems@xcite . due",
    "to interaction between two coupled chaotic oscillators , various features of synchronization are observed depending on the coupling strength .",
    "for example , when two identical chaotic oscillators are coupled , they can be synchronized either perfectly@xcite or intermittently@xcite . in another case , where they are coupled with slight parameter mismatch , non - synchronization , phase synchronization@xcite , or lag synchronization@xcite is observed depending on the coupling strength . among these features ,",
    "the noteworthy one of our study is _ phase synchronization _",
    "( ps)@xcite . as is widely understood , above the critical strength of the coupling for the transition to ps , suitably defined phases of two chaotic oscillators are locked while their amplitudes remain chaotic and uncorrelated . and",
    "below the critical value , the phases of two oscillators are intermittently unlocked , that is , @xmath6 phase jumps interrupt the phase locking states irregularly .",
    "so it can be said that the transition from nonsynchronous state to ps state is typically accompanied by an intermittent sequence of @xmath6 phase jumps@xcite .",
    "to explain the transition mechanism to ps , two different approaches have been introduced : topological@xcite and statistical@xcite .",
    "the topological approach assumes that the behavior of coupled chaotic oscillators is analogous to that of a chaotic oscillator driven by an external chaotic signal@xcite . from this study",
    "it was concluded that the phase jump phenomenon stems from a boundary crisis@xcite mediated by an unstable - unstable pair bifurcation , which is termed eyelet intermittency@xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the statistical approach focuses on a phase equation which describes the phase difference of coupled chaotic oscillators .",
    "a potential modulated by multiplicative noise was derived by the analysis of the phase equation and it was concluded that the transition mechanism is similar to that of eyelet intermittency@xcite .",
    "by taking the statistical approach , however , we are to show in this paper that the characteristic relation of the average length of the phase locking state ( or average laminar length ) on the coupling strength before the transition to ps in coupled rssler oscillators follows the relation of type - i intermittency in the presence of noise . to validate our argument , we derive a one - dimensional phase equation from the coupled rssler oscillators and obtain the bifurcation point , the tangent point that is a @xmath7 phase locking state , and the return map analytically , which exactly agree with those of the numerical simulations .",
    "and then we obtain the characteristic relations of @xmath8 for @xmath9 and of @xmath10 for @xmath11 which are the same as those of type - i intermittency in the presence of noise@xcite , where @xmath4 is the average length of the phase locking state , @xmath5 is the coupling strength and @xmath12 is the tangent bifurcation point .    in our approach , the analytic scaling rule is obtained from the fokker - planck equation @xcite and so it describes the asymptotic behavior near ps regime in which the effective noise can be reasonably approximated to be gaussian @xcite .",
    "for this reason , it seems that critical coupling does not appear in our formalism .",
    "however in real systems there is one critical coupling @xmath13 which is defined as a border of existence of phase slips , because of a finite amplitude of the effective noise .    in section",
    "ii , we will obtain phase difference equation of coupled rssler oscillators from one - dimensional phase equation and compare the analytical and numerical return maps of the phase difference in section iii .",
    "after that we will obtain the characteristic relations of intermittent phase locking time according to the coupling strength by fokker - planck equation in section iv , discuss the results in section v , and conclude our study in section vi .",
    "the transition to ps was first observed in coupled rssler oscillators which have a slight parameter mismatch @xcite , @xmath14 where @xmath15 @xmath16 are the overall frequency of each oscillator and @xmath5 is the coupling strength . by transforming the above equation to the polar form , we obtain the following one - dimensional phase equation , which describes the phase difference of the two oscillators : @xmath17 where , @xmath18 @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 . here",
    "@xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 in @xmath26 are fast fluctuating terms in comparison with slowly varying @xmath27 .",
    "whereas , in the previous studies , the authors neglected all of the fast fluctuating terms@xcite , we found that they play a crucial role in the analysis of the transition mechanism .",
    "equation ( 2 ) can be transformed into the following simple form : @xmath28 where @xmath29 , and @xmath30 . here",
    "@xmath31 and @xmath32 are the mean value of @xmath26 and @xmath23 respectively .",
    "this equation is similar to the one describing a phase locking of the periodic oscillator in the presence of noise @xcite .    in eq .",
    "( 4 ) , if we turn off @xmath33 , the analysis of the system stability is straightforward .",
    "if @xmath34 the system ends time - evolution and @xmath27 remains at @xmath35 , where @xmath36 here the condition of @xmath35 being stable is @xmath37 .",
    "tangent bifurcation occurs at @xmath38 and the tangent point is @xmath39 , where @xmath40 and the sign @xmath41 depends on @xmath42 . in our system since @xmath42 is positive , only @xmath43 appears .",
    "this explains why @xmath27 is locked near @xmath44 and @xmath6 phase jumps occur@xcite .",
    "if eq . ( 4 ) is expanded around the tangent point @xmath43 , the following equation is obtained : @xmath45 , where @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 . here if @xmath33 is absent , @xmath49 moves very slowly around the tangent point @xmath35 .",
    "so the dynamics of @xmath49 is mainly governed by @xmath33 in the situation @xmath50 .",
    "then we can regard @xmath51 as a constant when the two oscillators are in a locked state .",
    "we obtain a local poincar map by integrating the above equation during the period that oscillator 1 completes every n rotation ( the structure of the local poincar map is invariant with respect to the number of n as far as n is small enough in comparison with the average length of the phase locking state ) .",
    "the local poincar map is given by : @xmath52 where @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 . here",
    "@xmath56 is @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the overall time that oscillator 1 takes to complete @xmath59 rotations .",
    "this is the very local poincar map of type - i intermittency in the presence of noise@xcite when @xmath60 acts as random noise . in this equation tangent",
    "bifurcation occurs at the point @xmath61 , which meets the condition of @xmath62 . to determine the tangent bifurcation point , we calculate @xmath31 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 according to the coupling strength @xmath5 as presented in fig . 1 ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) , respectively . the figures show that the value of @xmath5 at the bifurcation point is @xmath67 .    in order to verify the above analytic results",
    ", we construct the return maps directly from eqs .",
    "( 1)-(3 ) by obtaining @xmath27 for @xmath68 .",
    "figure 2(a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) show the return maps before , near , and after the tangent bifurcation point , respectively .",
    "the figures show that as the coupling strength @xmath5 increases , the shadow curve approaches the diagonal line .",
    "when the curve touches the diagonal line , tangent bifurcation occurs and the tangent point is @xmath69 ( see the inset arrow in fig .",
    "2(b ) ) , which agrees well with the one obtained in the above .",
    "we define a measure @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the number of points above the diagonal line in the total number of points inside of the rectangle of @xmath72 and @xmath73 is the number of points below the diagonal line .",
    "then the measure shows the average ratio between above and below the passage near the tangent point .",
    "so the minimum value of @xmath74 indicates the bifurcation point .",
    "figure 2(d ) shows a sharp minimum at @xmath75 .",
    "this value again agrees with what we obtained from fig .",
    "1(b ) and ( c ) .",
    "the shadow curves are well fitted to the following form of type - i intermittency@xcite : @xmath76 where @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 . the coefficient @xmath80 in eq .",
    "( 7 ) agrees well with @xmath81 in eq .",
    "( 6 ) , since @xmath82 and the mean value of @xmath26 is @xmath83 .",
    "( the overall frequency @xmath84 . )",
    "this confirms that the phase equation of the coupled rssler oscillators coincide with the structure of type - i intermittency .",
    "under the long laminar length approximation , eq . ( 6 ) can be transformed into the differential form @xmath85 .",
    "then we can obtain the fokker - planck equation ( fpe ) by regarding @xmath60 as gaussian white noise@xcite . the probability distribution and auto - correlation of @xmath60",
    "are examined for various @xmath59s .",
    "so we find they are in better agreement with the gaussian distribution and @xmath86-correlation , respectively , as @xmath59 becomes larger .",
    "figure 3 shows the probability distribution and auto - correlation of @xmath60 for @xmath87 which coincide with the gaussian profile with a dispersion of @xmath88 and the @xmath86-function , respectively .",
    "( @xmath87 is still much less than the average length of the phase locking state that we have obtained . )",
    "the noise with the gaussian distribution is not bounded whereas @xmath60 in coupled rssler oscillators is bounded within @xmath89 . however , from the numerical data , we find that the probability of the occurrence of events outside the bounded region of @xmath60 is less than @xmath90 .",
    "so it is a negligible effect on the average length of the phase locking state .    from the fpe with appropriate boundary conditions@xcite ,",
    "we can obtain the characteristic form of the average laminar length according to the coupling strength @xmath5 as follows : @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the constant and @xmath93 is the average length of the phase locking state at the tangent bifurcation point .",
    "figure 4(a ) shows the average length of the phase locking state for @xmath68 as a function of @xmath94 in the region @xmath95 .",
    "the slope in the space @xmath96 versus @xmath97 is @xmath98 as shown in fig .",
    "4(b ) and its inset ( c ) .",
    "the line fits well within @xmath99% error from the 3/2 slope .",
    "the slope of the tail in fig .",
    "4 ( b ) converges to 1 @xcite which shows the transient regime from @xmath2 to @xmath100 .",
    "figure 4(d ) is the plot of @xmath101 versus @xmath102 in the region @xmath103 and the tail also clearly shows the transient regime .",
    "the straight line fits well with the @xmath104 slope .",
    "this means that the characteristic relation deforms from the conventional scaling rule @xmath2 to @xmath105 , as the coupling strength crosses the tangent bifurcation point .",
    "thus we can understand that the average length of the phase locking state agrees well with the characteristic relation of type - i intermittency in the presence of noise not only in the region @xmath106 but also in the region @xmath107 .",
    "in the previous study , lee _",
    "et al._@xcite once showed that the characteristic relation of the average length of the phase locking state for @xmath11 @xmath108 that is the scaling of type - i intermittency .",
    "and then they claimed that the relation deforms to the scaling of eyelet intermittency for @xmath109 based on the numerical data only in the narrow range @xmath110 .",
    "they obtained the tangent bifurcation point @xmath111 and the critical point for ps @xmath112 neglecting all the fast fluctuation terms , which are highly important in this regard as we have explained above . also a monograph claimed that the critical point for ps is @xmath113 relying based on the lyapunov exponent analysis@xcite . unlike their claims",
    ", however , we have showed that the true tangent bifurcation point is @xmath114 and we have obtained the characteristic relation in the wider range @xmath95 where it deforms from @xmath2 to @xmath115 continuously as @xmath5 crosses @xmath114 .",
    "this deformation is the typical characteristic of type - i intermittency in the presence of noise , as it was confirmed experimentally in our recent paper@xcite . in numerical simulations",
    ", we have also found that phase jumps still occur even at @xmath116 . as mentioned in the above",
    ", @xmath60 is bounded in the coupled rssler oscillators .",
    "nevertheless , it is very hard to determine the correct @xmath13 because it takes too long time to find out the point where the average length of the phase locking state becomes infinite due to the exponential increment of @xmath4 . instead of the ps point",
    ", the result of numerical simulation follows well eq .",
    "( 8) in the region which we studied .    in the route to ps ,",
    "the phase slip phenomenon in coupled chaotic oscillators is usually described by the langevin equation : @xmath117 @xcite .",
    "we understand that the phenomenon is in a process of losing the stability for the fixed point @xmath118 where @xmath119 by the stochastic perturbation @xcite and so the origin of the transition seems to be universal in coupled chaotic oscillators .",
    "the characteristic scaling rule can be deformed according to the local structure of the poincar map near the bifurcation point i.e. , @xmath120 .",
    "recently we observed a similar transition route which has the same origin in coupled hyper - chaotic rssler oscillators whose characteristic scaling rule is governed by type - ii intermittency in the presence of noise because its normal form has cubic polynomial type instead of a quadratic one@xcite .",
    "we have studied the origin of the transition to ps via phase jumps in coupled rssler oscillators analytically as well as numerically .",
    "analysis of the phase equation and the numerically constructed local poincar map reveal that the transition to ps via @xmath6 phase jumps is governed by type - i intermittency in the presence of external additive noise .",
    "the characteristic behavior of the average length of the phase locking state with respect to the parameter @xmath5 obtained both by numerical fitting and the fpe approach obeys @xmath121 for @xmath122 , with the well known scaling form @xmath123 for @xmath124 .",
