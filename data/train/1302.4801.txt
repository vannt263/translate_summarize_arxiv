    "in a recent paper @xcite we pointed out that the @xmath0-qubit pauli group ( for @xmath8 ) is a rich source of both observables - based and projectors - based  parity proofs \" of the kochen - specker ( ks ) theorem @xcite .",
    "we refer to the proofs as parity proofs because , in either the observables - based or projectors - based versions , they exploit the concept of parity to achieve their ends .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to give examples of both types of proofs for @xmath9- and higher qubit systems and to point out several of their properties that we did not discuss earlier in our work on 2- and 3-qubit systems @xcite .",
    "more precisely , the goals of this paper are the following : + ( 1 ) we explain what we mean by an observables - based ks proof and show how it can be depicted in the form of a diagram from which it is obvious by inspection .",
    "the two best known examples of such proofs are a 2-qubit proof due to peres @xcite and mermin @xcite and a 3-qubit proof due to mermin @xcite based on earlier work by greenberger , horne and zeilinger @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite we presented several examples of @xmath2- and @xmath3-qubit proofs of this kind and in ref .",
    "@xcite we indicated that we had found a large number of @xmath9- and higher qubit proofs but gave few details . here",
    "we give examples of 4-,5- and 6-qubit proofs that convey a feeling for the wide variety of possibilities that open up as one goes to a larger number of qubits .",
    "we should stress that we consider only _ critical _ proofs , i.e. , ones that can not be reduced to smaller proofs by omitting some subset of qubits and/or observables in them , but that despite this restriction the number of possibilities still grows very rapidly as one goes to a larger number of qubits .",
    "+ ( 2 ) we show how any observables - based ks proof can be used to construct a system of projectors and bases from which a large number of projectors - based parity proofs of the ks theorem can be obtained .",
    "the simplest example of this procedure is provided by the 2-qubit peres - mermin square , whose nine observables give rise to a system of projectors and bases that yield a total of @xmath10 projectors - based parity proofs @xcite . in recent years",
    "a number of other examples of projectors - based parity proofs have been found in four @xcite and eight @xcite dimensions .",
    "a major point of this paper is that every observables - based ks proof , based on a subset of observables of the pauli group , gives rise to a system of projectors - based parity proofs , and we give a simple algorithm for making this transition .",
    "we illustrate this algorithm in the particular case of a 4-qubit observables - based proof and show how the @xmath11 associated projectors - based proofs can be obtained with practically no effort ( once the system of projectors and bases within which they are embedded has been set up ) .",
    "in addition to the fact that they are easy to generate , the projectors - based proofs are also easy to check , since only simple counting is called for . like the observables - based proofs from which they are derived ,",
    "the projectors - based proofs are critical in the sense that they can not be whittled down to smaller proofs by omitting some subset of their bases . because each observables - based proof gives rise to a large number of projectors - based proofs , the variety and quantity of the latter are vastly greater than those of the former .",
    "+ ( 3 ) it is interesting to ask if there are any infinite classes of observables - based proofs that apply to all numbers of qubits from two up .",
    "we have discovered several such classes that we call the star , the wheel , the whorl and the kite ( with the names reflecting the shapes of the associated diagrams ) .",
    "the most complex of these families is the kite , and we give a detailed discussion of it in this paper .",
    "all the members of this family can be represented by diagrams having the form of a kite , with the body consisting of nine observables arranged on a 3 x 3 grid and the tail consisting of a string of observables of arbitrary length . for any number of qubits ,",
    "a suitable choice of observables ( and often more than one ) can be placed on the framework of the kite to yield a ks proof .",
    "the @xmath2-qubit peres - mermin square can be regarded as a kite without a tail , and the higher qubit proofs of this family involve tails of increasing lengths .",
    "an interesting feature of this family is that all its members give rise to projectors - based ks proofs involving just nine bases ( or experimental contexts ) , and so are the most compact proofs of this type known in @xmath6 dimensions for all @xmath7 .",
    "+ the next three sections are devoted to a discussion of the above three points .",
    "we then comment on the significance of our results and their relation to other work .",
    "although this paper builds upon our earlier work @xcite , it is written to be self contained and requires no familiarity with that work .",
    "an observables - based proof of the ks theorem for a system of @xmath0 qubits consists of a subset of observables of the @xmath0-qubit pauli group that forms a number of commuting sets of a special kind . the proof is conveniently displayed in the form of a diagram in which the observables are represented as points ( or actually as letters within circles centered at points ) and the special commuting sets as lines ( which could be straight or curved ) joining the points .",
    "an observable is represented by a sequence of letters , each of which can be one of @xmath12 or @xmath13 ( these being the pauli and identity operators of a qubit ) .",
    "for example , @xmath14 represents a 5-qubit observable that is the tensor product of the observables @xmath15 and @xmath16 of the individual qubits .",
    "every special commuting set in any of our proofs has the property that the product of all the observables in it is either + * * i * * or @xmath17**i * * , where * i * is the identity operator in the space of all the qubits",
    ". sets with product + * * i * * are shown by thin lines and sets with product @xmath17**i * * by thick lines in our diagrams . any diagram representing an observables - based ks proof has the following two properties : ( a ) each observable lies at the intersection of an even number of lines , and ( b )",
    "the total number of thick lines is odd .",
    "these properties guarantee that the diagrams provide proofs of the ks theorem . to see why , note that the eigenvalues of any @xmath0-qubit observable are @xmath18 and that a noncontextual hidden variables theory is required to assign the value @xmath19 or @xmath20 to each of the observables in such a way that the product of the values assigned to the observables on a thin ( or a thick ) line equals @xmath19 ( or @xmath20 ) .",
    "however properties ( a ) and ( b ) rule out such a value assignment be the product of the values assigned to the observables in the commuting set indexed by @xmath21 and consider the product @xmath22 taken over all the commuting sets .",
    "property ( b ) requires that @xmath23 but property ( a ) requires that @xmath24 , so there is a contradiction . ] and so prove the ks theorem .",
    "+ a number of @xmath0-qubit proof - diagrams are shown in figs.1 - 4 for @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the names we have given to the diagrams are whimsical and merely try to capture their shapes .",
    "we have also attached a symbol to each diagram that should help the reader pick out the commuting sets in it ( particularly in the case of the more complicated diagrams ) .",
    "the left half of each symbol lists the number of observables of each multiplicity ( with the multiplicities as subscripts ) and the right half lists the number of commuting sets of each size ( with the sizes as subscripts ) .",
    "for example , the symbol @xmath27-@xmath28 for the 4-qubit star of fig.1 indicates that it contains 12 observables of multiplicity 2 ( i.e. , that each occur twice among its commuting sets ) and that there are four commuting sets of four observables and one each of five and three observables .",
    "the sum of the products of each number with its subscript in the left half of the symbol must equal the similar sum of products on the right , and this can be used as a quick check on the consistency of the symbol . for a symbol to represent a valid ks proof , all the subscripts in its left half must be even ( it is also necessary that the number of commuting sets with product @xmath17**i * * be odd , but this fact is not made evident in the symbol and can only be checked by looking at the diagram . ) +    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     [ kite7_16 ]",
    "this paper has established the following results : + 1 .",
    "the hierarchy of @xmath0-qubit pauli groups ( for @xmath8 ) contains many subsets of observables that provide parity proofs of the ks theorem .",
    "we restrict our attention to proofs that are irreducible ( i.e. that can not be reduced to simpler proofs by omitting some subset of observables and/or qubits in them ) and unitarily inequivalent . with these caveats ,",
    "the 2-qubit group gives rise to only two distinct types of proofs ( the peres - mermin square and a more complicated structure we call the  whorl \" , which are shown as figs.1 and 2 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , but the 3-qubit group leads to many more @xcite and the possibilities increase rapidly as one goes upwards in the number of qubits . it would be an interesting problem to make a more systematic inventory of the proofs at a given value of @xmath0 and to get a feeling for how this number grows with @xmath0 .",
    "there are two devices we have introduced in this paper that could assist with this task : the first is a diagrammatic representation of each proof ( from which it can be verified by inspection ) and the second is a symbol that captures the important features of the observables and special commuting sets in the proof .",
    "however we should caution that neither of these devices suffices to pin down a proof uniquely since there are distinct proofs that can be accommodated on the same diagrammatic skeleton , as well as inequivalent proofs that share the same symbol ( see fig.7 of ref .",
    "@xcite for an example ) . even in the absence of a detailed knowledge of the terrain",
    ", one can state quite confidently that the pauli group ( particularly as one goes to a larger number of qubits ) abounds in a great variety of structures that can be used to give transparent demonstrations of quantum contextuality .",
    "the second major point of this paper is that every observables - based ks proof can be used to generate a system of projectors and bases from which a a large number of projectors - based ks proofs can be obtained .",
    "the algorithm for generating these proofs is simple , and the proofs themselves are easy to validate because only a simple parity check is called for .",
    "we have introduced a detailed symbol for a projectors - based proof that describes the projectors and bases in it , both as a way of summarizing the key aspects of the proof and to draw attention to the wide variety of proofs that can coexist within the same framework of pure and hybrid bases provided by an observables - based proof .",
    "since the observables - based proofs are themselves very numerous , and each spawns a large number of projectors - based proofs ( typically thousands ) , the quantity and variety of the latter proofs vastly outstrip those of the former .",
    "we should add that the symbols we have introduced for the projectors - based proofs , though useful and informative , do not serve to pin them down uniquely since we have found many examples of inequivalent proofs that are described by the same symbol .",
    "among all the observables - based and related projectors - based proofs , there is a simple class that is worth singling out for special mention : it is the one in which each observable occurs in exactly two commuting sets and any two commuting sets have at most one observable in common .",
    "one knows in this case , even before one has set up the basis table , that one will find exactly @xmath5 projectors - based proofs .",
    "we have discovered several infinite families of observables - based proofs ( that we term the star , the wheel , the whorl and the kite ) whose members yield ks proofs for all numbers of qubits from two up .",
    "the kite is the most complex of these families , and we have given a detailed discussion of it in this paper .",
    "this family has two remarkable features .",
    "the first is that for a system of @xmath0 qubits it is always possible to find commuting sets of considerably less than @xmath0 observables that can be used to construct a ks proof , thus leading to greater economy in the design of experimental tests based on this class of proofs .",
    "and the second is that _ any _ kite proof always yields a projectors - based proof involving only nine bases ( or experimental contexts ) .",
    "these proofs are generalizations of the classic 18 - 9 proof of cabello et al @xcite in four dimensions and hold in all dimensions of the form @xmath6 , for @xmath8 .",
    "it is an open question whether there are any proofs involving less than nine bases in these dimensions ( we believe the answer is no ) .",
    "an even more basic question is whether there are any projectors - based parity proofs @xcite .",
    "] at all in any even dimension not of the form @xmath6 .",
    "again we suspect that the answer is no , but we do not have a proof of this conjecture ( and would find it fascinating if someone came up with a counterexample ) .",
    "+ there is currently a great interest in contextuality and nonlocality and their experimental tests .",
    "in one interesting development , it has been shown that any projectors - based ks proof can be converted into an inequality for testing quantum contextuality @xcite and a number of experimental tests of such inequalities have actually been carried out @xcite .",
    "a number of works have shed light on contextuality in a manner that bypasses the ks theorem @xcite . on the formal side ,",
    "a connection between ks proofs and  logical bell inequalities \" has been made in ref .",
    "@xcite and the question of state - independent contextuality for identical particles has been explored in ref . @xcite .",
    "although the present work concentrates entirely on qubits , it should be pointed out that ks proofs for qudits ( i.e. , @xmath29-state systems ) have been explored in ref . @xcite . among the practical applications of contextuality that are receiving attention are quantum key distribution @xcite , quantum error correction @xcite , random number generation @xcite , parity oblivious transfer @xcite and the design of relational databases @xcite .",
    "this is not a complete survey , of course , but should convey a feeling for the broader context in which the results reported here may be of interest .",
