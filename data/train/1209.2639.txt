    "the characterization of the regularities of value function and optimal policy in stochastic singular control remains a big challenge in stochastic control theory , especially the higher dimensional case , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the traditional approach is to use the viscosity solution technique , see @xcite @xcite @xcite , which usually yields a less regular solution .",
    "another approach to solve singular control problems and characterize the regularity of value functions is through variational inequalities and optimal stopping or dynkin game , see , e.g. , karatzas and zamfirescu @xcite , guo and tomecek @xcite . in @xcite karatzas and",
    "shreve studied the connection between optimal stopping and singular stochastic control of one dimensional brownian motion , and showed that the region of inaction in the control problem is the optimal continuation region for the stopping problem . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors established and exploited the duality between the myopic investor s problem ( optimal stopping ) and the social planning problem ( stochastic singular control ) , where an integral form and change of variable formula were also presented on this connection .",
    "ma @xcite dealt with a one dimensional stochastic singular control problem where the drift term is assumed to be linear and the diffusion term is assumed to be smooth , and he showed that the value function is convex and @xmath0 and the controlled process is a reflected diffusion over an interval .",
    "guo and tomecek @xcite solved a one dimensional singular control problem via a switching problem @xcite , and showed , using the smooth fit property @xcite , that under some conditions the value function is continuously differentiable ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "it is found that @xcite through the approach via game theory and optimal stopping , it is possible to show the existence of a smooth solution . the connection is the following : given a symmetric markov process on a locally compact separable metric space , it is well known that the solution of an optimal stopping problem admits its quasi continuous version of the solution to a variational inequality problem involving dirichlet form , e.g. , see nagai @xcite .",
    "zabczyk @xcite extended this result to a zero - sum game ( dynkin game ) . in the one dimensional case , the integrated form of the value function of the dynkin game",
    "was identified to be the solution of an associated stochastic singular control problem , e.g. , see taksar @xcite , fukushima and taksar @xcite where a more general one dimensional diffusion is assumed . as a result ,",
    "the classical smooth solution ( @xmath0 ) can be obtained for this singular control problem .",
    "this paper extends the work by fukushima and taksar @xcite to multi - dimensional stochastic singular control problem .",
    "there are many difficulties in this extension . in the one dimensional singular control problem ,",
    "each point in the space has a positive capacity @xcite , hence the nonexistence of the proper exceptional set .",
    "however , this is no longer the case in multi - dimensional singular control problem .",
    "we overcome this difficulty using the absolute continuity of the transition function of the underlying process @xcite . under some conditions , the optimal control policy of the one dimensional case",
    "is proved to be the reflection of the diffusion at two boundary points , but the form of the optimal control policy and the conditions on the regularity of the value function in multi - dimensional case are much more complicated .",
    "for instance , in the two dimensional case , the boundary of the continuation region can have various formats , e.g. , bounded curves , unbounded curves , singular points , disconnected curves , line segments , etc .",
    "the difficulty in characterizing the continuation region is due to the fact that its boundary is a free boundary , and this paper investigates such issues .    in this paper , we are concerned with a multi - dimensional diffusion on @xmath2 : @xmath3 where @xmath4 in which @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) are continuous functions of @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is @xmath10-dimensional brownian motion with @xmath11 .",
    "thus we are given a system @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a measurable space , @xmath14 is a mapping of @xmath15 into @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is a shift operator in @xmath15 such that @xmath19 . here",
    "@xmath20(@xmath21 ) is a family of measures under which @xmath22 is an @xmath23-dimensional diffusion with initial state @xmath24 .",
    "we assume that @xmath25 and @xmath26 satisfy the usual lipschitz growth condition .",
    "a control policy is defined as a pair @xmath27 of @xmath28 adapted processes which are right continuous and nondecreasing in @xmath29 and we assume @xmath30 are nonnegative .",
    "denote @xmath31 the set of all admissible policies , whose detailed definition will be given in section [ mdssc ] .    given a policy @xmath32 we define the following controlled process : @xmath33 with the cost function @xmath34 here we assume that @xmath35 is the minimal decomposition of a bounded variation process into a difference of two increasing processes .",
    "a natural question is that why the control only applies on one dimension .",
    "the difficulty arises in the step where the value function of the zero - sum game is integrated ( in one dimension ) to obtain the value function of the singular control problem .",
    "if the control were applied to multi dimensions , no result so far is know on the choice of the direction of integration .",
    "this represents a traditional difficulty in multi - dimensional singular control problem .",
    "interested readers are referred to @xcite for a result on two dimensional singular control problem .",
    "there are two types of costs associated with the process @xmath36 for each policy @xmath37 .",
    "the first one is the holding cost @xmath38 accumulated along time .",
    "the second one is the control cost associated with the processes @xmath39 , and this cost increases only when @xmath39 increase .",
    "one looks for a control policy @xmath37 that minimizes @xmath40 , i.e. , @xmath41    as an application of this model , a decision maker observes the expenses of a company under a multi - factor situation but only has control over one factor , yet she still wants to minimize the total expected cost .",
    "analogously , by studying the associated maximization problem , i.e. , taking the negative of @xmath42 , this model can be used to find the optimal investment policy where an investor observes the prices of several assets in a portfolio and manages the portfolio by adjusting one of them .",
    "notice that every time there is a control action , it yields a certain associated cost , e.g. , the transaction cost .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : we first introduce some preliminaries on dirichlet form and a variational inequality problem in section [ dformdgame ] . in section [ dgamefbp ]",
    "we identify conditions for the value function as well as the optimal policy of the associated dynkin game .",
    "the integrated form of the value function of this dynkin game is shown in section [ mdssc ] to be the value of a multi - dimensional singular control problem , and the optimal control policy is also determined consequently . in the appendix we shall correct an error found in the paper by fukushima and taksar @xcite .",

    "furthermore , the @xmath46-resolvent @xmath61 associated with this dirichlet form satisfies @xmath62 and the resolvent @xmath63 of the hunt process @xmath64 given by @xmath65 is a quasi - continuous modification of @xmath66 for any borel function @xmath67 .    for @xmath68 , a measurable function @xmath69 on @xmath43",
