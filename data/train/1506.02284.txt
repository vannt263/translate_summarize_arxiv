    "@xmath5 is naturally endowed with its _ intrinsic metric _ :",
    "the distance between two points is the length of the shortest curve joining them . in this paper",
    ", we shall never consider the extrinsic distance .",
    "a _ segment _ is by definition a shortest path on the polyhedron between its endpoints . in general , it is not a line segment of @xmath6 , but becomes so if one unfolds the faces it crosses onto a same plane",
    ". an _ antipode _ of @xmath2 is a farthest point from @xmath2 ; the set of antipodes of @xmath2 is denoted by @xmath3 .",
    "it is well - known that the mapping @xmath1 is upper semicontinuous .",
    "when the context makes clear that @xmath3 is a singleton , we shall not distinguish between this singleton and its only element .",
    "the study of antipodes on convex surfaces began with several questions of h. steinhaus , reported in @xcite , most of them answered by tudor zamfirescu , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however , one of those questions had remained open a little longer : does the fact that the antipodal map of a convex surface is a single - valued involution imply that the surface is a round sphere ? as we shall see , the answer is negative . by definition , such a surface will be called a _",
    "steinhaus surface_.    the first family of steinhaus surfaces was discovered by c. vlcu @xcite .",
    "it consists of centrally symmetric surfaces of revolution , and includes the ellipsoids having two axes equal , and the third shorter than the two equal ones .",
    "( note that if the third axis is longer than the two equal ones , the surface is no longer steinhaus @xcite . ) other examples were discovered afterward : cylinders of small height @xcite , and the boundaries of intersections of two solid balls , provided that the part of the surface of the smaller ball included in the bigger one does not exceed a hemisphere .",
    "this last example , as well as the mentioned family , were generalized to hypersurfaces in @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "note that steinhaus conditions are related to another one .",
    "define the _ radius _ at a point @xmath2 as the distance between @xmath2 and its antipodes .",
    "it is known that , if some surface has a constant radius map , then it is a steinhaus surface @xcite .",
    "moreover , all examples of steinhaus surfaces hitherto discovered also satisfy the constant radius condition .",
    "so it is still open whether the two conditions are equivalent .",
    "one can also notice that all known examples are surfaces of revolution , and in particular , are not polyhedral .",
    "the first attempt to find a polyhedral example was the investigation of the regular tetrahedron .",
    "an explicit computation of the antipodal map proved that it is not a steinhaus surface @xcite .",
    "then we proved that no tetrahedra can be steinhaus @xcite .",
    "a few years later , we proved that no polyhedron can satisfy the radius condition , and that no centrally symmetric polyhedron can be steinhaus @xcite . since then , the problem of the ( non)existence of steinhaus polyhedra was very natural .",
    "the aim of this paper to prove they do not exist .    in order to make this article",
    "self - contained , we give in section [ s2 ] some preliminary , concerning the antipodes on a convex polyhedron . in section [ s3 ] ,",
    "we prove the result .",
    "then , in a last section , we discuss a few open questions related to this topic .",
    "the explicit computation of the antipodal map in the case of the regular tetrahedron @xcite was generalized  as much as possible  to arbitrary convex polyhedra @xcite,@xcite .",
    "we proved there the following theorem .",
    "[ t0]any convex polyhedron @xmath5 can be written as a disjoint union@xmath8    with the following properties .    1 .   the sets @xmath9 are open , and the restricted maps @xmath10 are singled - valued .",
    "2 .   the set @xmath11 is a finite union of algebraic arcs , of degree at most @xmath12 .",
    "it includes the edges of @xmath5 .",
    "3 .   the map @xmath10 is a constant map if and only if its image is a singleton containing a vertex .",
    "if @xmath13 , then there is exactly one segment between @xmath14 and any point of @xmath9 ; otherwise , there are exactly three segments between @xmath15 and @xmath3 .    from now on , the sets",
    "@xmath9 defined in the above theorem will be referred to as _",
    "zones_.    including a priori the edges in @xmath11 is only a trick to simplify the proof and ensure that any zone is ( isometric to ) a plane domain . in general",
    ", nothing special happens while crossing an edge : if @xmath16 and @xmath17 are two zones separated by an edge and one rotates the face of @xmath16 onto the plane of @xmath17 , then @xmath18 and @xmath19 become rational prolongations of each other .",
    "more generally , the notion of edges belongs to the extrinsic geometry and plays no role in a purely intrinsic problem .",
    "the proof of theorem [ t0 ] is given in details in @xcite and @xcite , we present next only its rough idea .",
    "the fourth point of the theorem has been stated for aim of completeness only .",
    "it will not be used here , so we shall omit its proof which involves extensive computation .",
    "a first remark is that a segment can not pass through any vertex , see for instance @xcite .",
    "secondly , note that a point @xmath2 on the polyhedron is joined to any of its antipodes @xmath20 by at least three segments , provided that @xmath20 is not a vertex .",
    "suppose on the contrary that there are only two segments @xmath21 and @xmath22 between @xmath2 and @xmath20 .",
    "they would determine two sectors at point @xmath20 , one of them having measure at least @xmath23 ( if there is only one segment , there is only one sector , measuring @xmath24 ) .",
    "consider a point @xmath25 on the bisector of this sector , tending to @xmath20 .",
    "a segment @xmath26 between @xmath2 and @xmath25 should tend to either @xmath21 or @xmath22 , say @xmath21 .",
    "for @xmath25 close enough to @xmath20 , the triangle composed of @xmath21 , @xmath26 , and the only segment between @xmath25 and @xmath20 contains no vertex , and so , is a ( folded ) euclidean triangle .",
    "moreover the angle at @xmath20 is obtuse or right ; it follows that the length of @xmath26 ( which is also @xmath27 ) is greater than the length of @xmath21 ( which is supposed to be the radius at @xmath2 ) , and we get a contradiction .",
    "hence there exist three segments @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath21 between @xmath2 and @xmath20 .",
    "let @xmath30 be the face of @xmath2 and @xmath31 be the face of @xmath20 ; if one unfolds the union of the faces crossed by @xmath32 ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) onto the plane of @xmath31 , one obtains three images of the face @xmath30 , say @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "one passes from @xmath36 to @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) by a planar affine direct isometry @xmath41 .",
    "since the segments @xmath32 have the same length , @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the point of @xmath36 corresponding to @xmath2 and @xmath44 stands for the circumcenter ( see figure [ f1 ] ) .",
    "there is only a finite number of ways to unfold sequences of faces , inducing a finite number of pairs of isometries @xmath45 , leading to a finite number of maps @xmath46 @xmath47 . for each zone",
    "@xmath16 the function @xmath18 is either one @xmath48 or a constant map whose value is a vertex .",
    "let @xmath49 be the square of the distance between @xmath2 and @xmath50 .",
    "the algebraic arcs that compose @xmath51 are parts of the locus of those points such that @xmath52 for some indices @xmath53 and @xmath54 , such that @xmath55 for some index @xmath53 and some vertex @xmath14 , or such that @xmath56 for some vertices @xmath14 and @xmath57 .",
    "a  straightforward computation shows that they have degree at most @xmath12 .",
    "( note that , in the only case that have been explicitly solved  the regular tetrahedron  the higher degree terms vanish and the actual degree drops to @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "so it is not entirely clear that @xmath12 can be achieved . )    for further reasoning , it is necessary to notice that @xmath59 and @xmath60 can not be both translations ( lemma 1 in @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , if either @xmath59 or @xmath60 is a translation then , by interchanging the roles of @xmath61 and @xmath62 , we obtain that @xmath60 and @xmath59 are both rotations , of the same angle .",
    "hence , we can assume without loss of generality that @xmath45 are both rotations .",
    "now , a straightforward computation proves the following lemma .",
    "[ l1 ] let @xmath5 be a convex polyhedron , let @xmath16 be a zone of @xmath5 , and assume that @xmath18 is not constant .",
    "endow the plane of @xmath16 and the plane of @xmath63 with orthonormal frames and let @xmath64 be the coordinates of @xmath65 .",
    "the coordinates of @xmath3 are given by the formula:@xmath66 where @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70   $ ] , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 .",
    "moreover , the zero set of the denominator is neither empty nor reduced to a single point .    indeed , @xmath74 if and only if the function @xmath45 are rotations of the same angle . in this case , the zero set of the denominator of ( [ 3 ] ) is the line through the centers of @xmath59 and @xmath60 . if the angles of the rotations are distinct ( , @xmath75 ) , the zero set of the denominator is the circle through the centers of @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath76 .",
    "[ l2]with the notation of lemma [ l1 ] , in the case @xmath74 , there exists orthonormal frames of the planes of @xmath16 and @xmath77 such that @xmath78    let @xmath79 be the angle common to both rotations .",
    "choose the orthonormal direct frame in the plane of @xmath63 in such a way that the coordinates of the center of @xmath41 are @xmath80 ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "in the plane of @xmath16 , choose the frame in which the coordinates of @xmath81 equal the coordinates of @xmath82 .",
    "let @xmath64 be the coordinates of @xmath2 ; the coordinates of @xmath83 are @xmath84 the equation in coordinates @xmath85 of the mediator of the segment @xmath86 is@xmath87 in order to shorten the formulas , we put @xmath88 and @xmath89 . the half difference and half sum of the two equations given by ( [ 4 ] ) ( @xmath40 ) are respectively@xmath90{rrr}u\\xi & + v\\psi & = -ux+vy\\\\ \\left (   ux - vy\\right )   \\xi & + \\left (   uy+vx\\right )   \\psi & = -u\\text{.\\hspace { 0.9cm}}\\end{array}\\ ] ] it follows that @xmath91@xmath92",
    "now , we are in a position to prove the claimed result .",
    "the idea of proof is very simple : we just have to prove that the inverse of a function of the form ( [ 3 ] ) can not be of this form .",
    "any convex polyhedron @xmath5 contains an open and dense set @xmath93 such that @xmath94 is single - valued , @xmath95 is single - valued , and @xmath96 for all @xmath97 .",
    "consequently , no polyhedron satisfies , even locally , steinhaus conditions .",
    "it is sufficient to prove that any open set @xmath98 contains an open subset @xmath99 such that @xmath100 and @xmath101 are single - valued , and such that @xmath96 for any @xmath102 .",
    "then , the union of all those @xmath99 is a suitable @xmath93 .",
    "let @xmath103 be a fixed open set ; by virtue of theorem [ t0 ] , it contains a subset @xmath104 which is included in a zone .",
    "since @xmath105 is continuous , there exists a smaller open set @xmath106 such that @xmath107 is wholly contained in a zone too . since @xmath108 is single - valued and thereby continuous , the set @xmath99 of those points in @xmath109 such that @xmath110 is open .",
    "if it is non - empty , the proof is over ; suppose on the contrary that @xmath111 for all @xmath112 .",
    "put @xmath113 .",
    "let @xmath114 be the plane of the face containing @xmath115 and @xmath116 be the plane of the face containing @xmath117 .",
    "by lemma [ l1 ] , @xmath118 and @xmath119 are rational and admit natural continuations @xmath120 and @xmath121 respectively , where @xmath122 and @xmath123 are either a circle or a line . by hypothesis , @xmath124 ; since @xmath125 and @xmath126 are rational , @xmath127 wherever @xmath128 is well defined .",
    "assume that @xmath129 intersects @xmath123 .",
    "let @xmath130 be a point of the boundary of @xmath131 , and @xmath132 be a point tending to @xmath130 when @xmath133 tends to infinity",
    ". then @xmath134 tends to infinity , in contradiction with @xmath135 .",
    "hence @xmath129 does not intersect @xmath123 , and similarly @xmath136 does not intersect @xmath122 .",
    "assume now that either @xmath122 or @xmath123 is a circle .",
    "since @xmath125 and @xmath126 play symmetrical roles , we can assume that @xmath122 is a circle .",
    "let @xmath93 be the interior of @xmath122 and @xmath137 its exterior ; let @xmath138 , @xmath139 be the two connected components of @xmath140 . since @xmath141 tends to infinity when @xmath142 tends to some points of @xmath123 , @xmath143 ( resp .",
    "@xmath144 ) can not be included in @xmath93 .",
    "it follows that @xmath145 .",
    "this contradict the fact that a point @xmath97 equals @xmath146 .",
    "now assume that @xmath122 and @xmath123 are both straight lines .",
    "by lemma [ l2 ] , one can assume that the expression of @xmath125 in euclidean coordinates is given by ( [ 3 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "let @xmath147 be the point of coordinates @xmath148 , @xmath149 be the point of coordinates @xmath150 and @xmath151 the point of coordinates @xmath152 .",
    "a direct computation shows that@xmath153 hence @xmath154 and we get a contradiction .",
    "in order to close the paper , we will mention a few open questions related to the above result .",
    "the first two were already suggested in the introduction .",
    "observe that the definition of steinhaus surfaces combines two distinct conditions : the fact that @xmath1 is single - valued does not imply that it is an involution .",
    "the simplest known example is an ellipsoid of revolution whose axes measure respectively @xmath35 , @xmath35 , and @xmath155 . on such an ellipsoid , @xmath1 is a homeomorphism , but not an involution @xcite .",
    "this naturally leads to the following question .",
    "a certain trend nowadays is to consider the so - called _ alexandrov surfaces with curvature bounded below _ , instead of the classical convex surfaces .",
    "roughly speaking , the difference between these notions is twofold . on the one hand ,",
    "the curvature bound is no longer necessarily zero , and on the other hand , the topology is no longer spherical .",
    "see @xcite for details . in this context , it is natural to consider _ abstract polyhedra _ obtained by gluing several polygons along their boundaries , in such a way that ( 1 ) the gluing map is length preserving , ( 2 ) the resulting space is a ( not necessarily spherical ) topological surface , and ( 3 ) the singular curvature at each vertex is non - negative . it is easy to see that the theorem of this paper can not be generalized to such abstract polyhedra , for rectangle flat tori are steinhaus . as for projective planes ,",
    "the main obstruction to be steinhaus is purely topological .",
    "assume that @xmath1 is single - valued , and consequently continuous .",
    "since , as a consequence of lefschetz fixed point theorem , even dimensional projective spaces have the fixed point property , @xmath1 should have a fixed point , which is absurd .",
    "still in the context of alexandrov surfaces , it is natural to consider abstract polyhedra whose faces are geodesic polygons of the unit sphere ( _ spherical polyhedra _ ) , or of the hyperbolic plane ( _ hyperbolic polyhedra _ ) ."
