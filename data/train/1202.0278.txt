    "dust extinction is the largest source of uncertainty in currently used measurements of the properties of galaxies at substantial redshifts .",
    "reddening strongly effects the blue / uv continuum of galaxies upon which most star formation rates ( sfrs ) are estimated @xcite .",
    "its effects are important across a wide range of redshifts spanning much of cosmic time @xcite .",
    "although several methods have been used to correct for dust extinction , it is still unclear how reliable each of them is , and under what circumstances .",
    "some are rough statistical estimates to be applied to large samples , such as the common simple assumption of a constant one magnitude of extinction for h@xmath2 .",
    "this is an average , derived from studying the balmer decrement of local galaxies @xcite .",
    "but there is significant scatter , so that any single value will not apply to many individual galaxies .",
    "local studies have used uv , h@xmath2 , and/or infrared measurements to derive wavelength - dependent extinction or estimate dust - corrected sfrs @xcite . also , studies have found that the dust reddening properties are correlated with galaxy s properties ( e.g. , luminosity , * ? ? ?",
    "as such , reddening corrections should be measured for individual galaxies , from spectroscopy of their gas ionized by young stars .",
    "the  gold standard \" estimator is the balmer decrement  h@xmath2/h@xmath4 , which gives a reddening assuming a simple thin dust screen covers the regions in a given galaxy .",
    "this measured gas extinction in a galaxy might then be applied to its starlight , assuming that it is the same , or alternately half as much @xcite . however , balmer decrement measurements require rest - frame optical spectra , which are especially difficult to obtain in high - redshift galaxy surveys . in this paper , we present new data on the sfrs and dust reddening for @xmath8400 h@xmath2-selected galaxies at @xmath90.5 .",
    "the sample is obtained from the subaru deep field ( sdf ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with deep broad - band and narrow - band ( nb ) imaging from subaru s prime focus imager , suprime - cam @xcite . throughout this paper , ( 1 )",
    "all distance dependent measurements adopt a flat cosmology with @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 km s@xmath13 mpc@xmath13 , ( 2 ) a @xcite initial mass function is assumed , and ( 3 ) we adopt a @xcite dust reddening formalism .",
    "our new analysis is based on two unique samples of emission - line galaxies selected in sdf by their excess flux in nb filters ( * ? ? ? * hereafter l07 ) . these are nb921 ( @xmath14 ; @xmath15 ) and nb973 ( @xmath16 ; @xmath17 ) .",
    "our selection of nb excess emitters uses the nb color  magnitude diagram ( illustrated in figure  [ z_nb ] ) , as in previous papers ( @xcite ; , and references therein ) . in total , 2512  nb921 and 1666  nb973 line emitters are identified , with a minimum observed equivalent width ( ew ) of 32  ( 0.2 mag nb excess ) , and 70  ( 0.25 mag nb excess ) , respectively .",
    "+    since the nb filters are not centered on the central wavelength of the @xmath18-band , correction to the continuum fluxes , as derived by extrapolating the @xmath19@xmath18  color , was applied to estimate the flux at the wavelength of the nb filter .",
    "this color correction decreases the scatter in @xmath18nb for non - nb excess emitters ( at bright magnitudes ) by as much as @xmath850% for the nb973 sample , and allows us to select genuine emission - line sources down to 0.25 mag excess .",
    "the correction also reduces the contamination from red galaxies without emission lines , which are our greatest `` false positives . ''",
    "next we separate out the nb - excess sources whose nb emission is due to the h@xmath2  line , at redshifts of @xmath20 ( nb921 ) and @xmath21 ( nb973 ) .",
    "in particular , these must be distinguished from other nb excesses produced by other strong nebular emission lines , such as [ o iii ]  @xmath225007 and [ o ii ]  @xmath223727 at higher redshifts .",
    "our preferred method of identifying the h@xmath2  emitters is through spectroscopic redshifts , where available ( see colored symbols in figure  [ z_nb ] and section  [ spec_sec ] ) .    for the remaining nb - emitting galaxies lacking spectroscopy",
    ", we use the broad - band color technique developed in to identify h@xmath2  emitters .",
    "we illustrate in figure  [ brri ] the @xmath23@xmath24  and @xmath24@xmath19  colors of our nb excess emitters .",
    "there is a clear locus of sources with red @xmath23@xmath24  and blue @xmath24@xmath19colors .",
    "color cuts ( indicated by dashed lines in figure  [ brri ] ) were chosen to separate these h@xmath2  emitters from higher - redshift populations , which lack a balmer/4000  break in the @xmath23@xmath24  color .",
    "such a selection was defined in our previous paper to yield a low ( @xmath83% ) interloper contamination rate .",
    "the current larger sample strongly confirms the reliability of this broad - band color classification , as we again find small interloper fractions .",
    "a total of 401  @xmath25 and 249  @xmath26 h@xmath2  emitters are identified .",
    "using several optical spectrographs , we observed 326  nb921 and 102  nb973 excess emitters .",
    "our nb973 spectroscopic observations are sparser , since that sample became available much later . the majority ( 50% and 78% for the nb921 and nb973 samples , respectively ) of our spectra",
    "are from hectospec @xcite , the multi - object fiber - fed spectrograph for the mmt .",
    "we extend our spectroscopic sample with subaru s focas @xcite , and keck s deimos @xcite .",
    "our spectra typically have 12 hours of on - source integrations .",
    "the acquisition and reduction of deimos and focas data have been discussed in previous papers @xcite .",
    "the mmt spectra were reduced following standard procedures with the hsred reduction pipeline , and will be described further in ly et al .",
    "( 2012 , in preparation ) .    among these spectroscopically targeted nb921-excess emitters , @xmath2771% ( 232 ) have reliable redshifts ( based on at least one other emission line ) .",
    "similarly , 72% ( 73 ) of the nb973-excess emitters are spectroscopically identified .",
    "we note that these success rates are probably lower limits , since we do not include 23  ( an additional 7% ) nb921 and 6  ( an additional 6% ) nb973 sources that show single weak emission lines in their spectra which , if they are real , are consistent with the redshifts predicted by an emission line in the nb filter .",
    "the numbers of spectroscopically confirmed h@xmath2 , [ o iii ] , [ o ii ] , and ly@xmath2 lines in nb921 ( nb973 ) are 81  ( 47 ) , 78  ( 12 ) , 42  ( 2 ) , and 21  ( 1 ) , respectively .",
    "thus , @xmath820% of our h@xmath2  samples have been confirmed spectroscopically .",
    "we note that hectospec suffers from poor sensitivity and flat - fielding issues redward of @xmath88500 . while h@xmath2  is not measured in these spectra , the redshift determination is reliable due to detection of bluer emission lines , generally [ o iii ] , h@xmath4 , and [ o ii ] . and for 41 ( 20 ) cases with strong emission lines , h@xmath28 is also detected at @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) significance .",
    "thus the spectroscopy provides several emission - line ratios , which are useful for a number of astrophysical studies . in this letter",
    "we concentrate on the estimation of extinction from the balmer decrement ; we defer discussions of gas metallicity measurements for these galaxies to a forthcoming paper ( ly et al .",
    "2012 , in preparation ) .",
    "we have independent confirmations of the reality of a reliable fraction of our nb emission lines , from imaging in a second nb filter .",
    "our nb704 ; @xmath31 . ] imaging of the sdf allows us to detect the [ o iii ]  emission at @xmath0 while h@xmath2  simultaneously enters the nb921 filter .",
    "other surveys @xcite have exploited similar dual line coincidences to confirm emission - line galaxies at a particular redshift .    in sdf , a total of 241   dual emitters \" were identified . among the dual emitters ,",
    "80  were spectroscopically targeted , and only nine  of them have unidentified redshifts . among the remaining 71 sources ,",
    "66 of them were h@xmath2  emitters .",
    "there are only two cases of dual [ o ii ]  and h@xmath4  at @xmath32 .",
    "since these lines are weaker than [ o iii ]  and h@xmath2  for typical star - forming galaxies at these redshifts , it is not a surprise that the majority of spectroscopically confirmed dual emitters are at @xmath9 .",
    "these dual emitters are shown as red crosses in figure  [ z_nb ] and black diamonds in figure  [ brri ] ; they further confirm that the two - color selection for h@xmath2  nb921 emitters is highly effective ( 89% meets the @xmath23@xmath24@xmath19  color cuts ) .",
    "since the redshift ranges covered in h@xmath2  by nb921 and in [ o iii]by nb704 only overlap by roughly 50% , the large rate of dual emitters indicates that nearly all h@xmath2  emitters have [ o iii ]  emission , if only it is searched for at the appropriate redshift .",
    "the h@xmath2  fluxes ( @xmath33 ) and luminosities ( @xmath34 ) are derived ( see ) from the @xmath18  and nb filter measurements , as follows : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the flux density in erg s@xmath13  @xmath37  @xmath13 for band `` x '' , @xmath38 s are the fwhms of the filters ( @xmath39  =  955 ) , and @xmath40 is the luminosity distance .",
    "we modeled the fifteen - band sed of each galaxy to derive stellar masses , sfrs , dust reddening ( @xmath41(@xmath23@xmath42 ) ) , and stellar ages . at @xmath7 ,",
    "the data span rest - frame 10001.5@xmath3 m .",
    "the spectral synthesis models are discussed further in @xcite . in brief",
    ", we use the fast code @xcite , with exponentially declining @xmath43 star - formation history models from @xcite . in these pure stellar - continuum broadband fits ,",
    "the redshifts are accurately fixed , either from the spectroscopic values when available , or from the presence of h@xmath2  in the nb bandpass .",
    "if nebular emission lines were accounted for , we expect to obtain somewhat younger less massive galaxy fits @xcite .",
    "a subset of our h@xmath2  emitters with mmt spectroscopy has significant detection of h@xmath4 . to obtain accurate emission - line fluxes from spectra",
    ", we calibrated them using hectospec observations of standards . to check the accuracy of our flux calibration , we compare the estimated continuum fluxes in our spectra for 50008000  to those from our ancillary broad - band optical @xmath44 data .",
    "we find good one - to - one agreement at the 20% level .",
    "we correct for stellar h@xmath4  absorption by assuming a rest - frame ew of 2 .    to obtain the h@xmath2  fluxes ,",
    "two corrections must be applied .",
    "first , one must correct the nb emission - line fluxes for contamination from [ ] @xmath226548,6583 .",
    "local studies have found that the h@xmath2/ [ ]  flux ratio to be 2.3 @xcite .",
    "however , in , we found from optical spectroscopy that many of our h@xmath2  emitters have very weak [ ]  emission .",
    "this is expected , as our galaxy population probes lower masses ( @xmath45 m@xmath46 ) , and the mass  metallicity relation would suggest weaker [ ]  emission . in our same mmt",
    "spectroscopic observations , we obtained spectra of 19 h@xmath2  emitters at @xmath47 from another nb filter . aside from redshift , these galaxies are no different from those at @xmath7 in terms of luminosity , stellar mass , and h@xmath2  fluxes . for these galaxies we measured an average h@xmath2/[](6548 + 6583 )",
    "ratio of 5.6@xmath482.0 .",
    "we assume that this average applies to all our nb measurements .",
    "second , the nb filters do not have perfectly rectangular transmissions , and as a result , the measured emission - line fluxes can be underestimated when an emission line falls away from the center of the nb filter . to correct for this effect , we generated model spectra consisting of a flat continuum with an added emission line of various strengths at the location that is dictated by the spectroscopic redshift .",
    "we convolved these spectra with our filters throughputs to measure the expected observed @xmath18nb colors . when compared to the measured @xmath18nb colors from our imaging , we are able to determine the intrinsic ew of the emission line , and hence the intrinsic emission - line flux when scaled by the continuum flux .",
    "the combination of spectroscopy and nb photometry allows us to estimate balmer decrement for individual galaxies . among 73",
    "nb921 ( 47  nb973 ) h@xmath2  emitters with mmt spectroscopy , we have 30  ( 26 ) 5@xmath5 h@xmath4  detections , 16  ( 10 ) 35@xmath5 h@xmath4  detections , and 9(4 ) 23@xmath5  detections \" which we show 3@xmath5 lower limits on the balmer decrements .    in figure  [ spec_compare ] , we compare the balmer decrements for these galaxies against their h@xmath2  observed luminosities and absolute @xmath49-band magnitudes , @xmath50 .",
    "we find a correlation between the balmer decrement and h@xmath2  luminosity ( 99.8% significance ) , which is qualitatively consistent with those derived for @xmath51 galaxies by @xcite ( hereafter ; see equation  [ ext ] ) .",
    "we determine that dust reddenings are systematically larger in the more massive galaxies , but the correlation is weak ( 85.6% significance ) .",
    "other studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have also found a correlation between dust attenuation and stellar mass .",
    "although not illustrated , we did compare the @xmath41(@xmath23@xmath42 )  inferred from balmer decrement against those estimated from sed modeling .",
    "we find a weak correlation , and are limited by significant balmer decrement measurement uncertainties and a small sample .",
    "since estimating @xmath41(@xmath23@xmath42 )  from the balmer decrement is difficult , we pursue other methods to correct for dust attenuation .",
    "we illustrate in figure  [ ha_pred ] a comparison between the _ reddened _",
    "h@xmath2  luminosity from nb observations and the sed-_predicted _ reddened h@xmath2  luminosity : @xmath52 the factor of 1.85 is for the ratio between stellar and nebular reddening : @xmath41(@xmath23@xmath42)@xmath53 = 1.85@xmath41(@xmath23@xmath42 )  @xcite , and @xmath54 is the conversion constant for the ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter k09 ) sfr@xmath34 relation : @xmath55 since the modeling was performed with only broad - band photometry , the two axes are strictly independent of one another .",
    "it illustrates that a nearly one - to - one correspondence with an rms of 0.25 dex exists , and argues that the sfrs from sed modeling ( hereafter `` sed sfrs '' ) is reliable over 3 dex . because the model fits to sfr and reddening are primarily influenced by the strength and slope of the uv continuum ,",
    "the sed sfrs are essentially dust - corrected uv sfrs .",
    "this comparison also supports the idea that dust extinction is lower for starlight than for gas , consistent with @xcite . without a factor of 1.85 ,",
    "figure  [ ha_pred ] would show a statistical deviation of 0.10 dex ( 25% ) from one - to - one .    using the sed sfrs as a reliable estimate of the intrinsic sfrs , we illustrate in figure  [ sfr_plot ] the h@xmath2  luminosity with different statistical corrections for dust attenuation .",
    "we limit our analyses to galaxies where their photometric redshifts ( derived from eazy ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are consistent with the nb redshifts",
    ". excluded galaxies are generally fainter sources where greater photometric uncertainties led to poorer fits .",
    "the h@xmath2  nb921 and nb973 samples are limited to 266  and 127  galaxies , respectively .",
    "first , in figure  [ sfr_plot]a , we show the _ observed _",
    "h@xmath2  luminosity on the @xmath56-axis .",
    "the majority of sources clearly fall below the relation ( red lines ) , as expected since these luminosities have not yet been de - reddened .",
    "next we adopt three possible reddening corrections .",
    "the first is a uniform @xmath57 mag of extinction .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ sfr_plot]b .",
    "although the average correction is reasonable , it is systematically too large for those with low luminosities .    in the second , shown in figure  [ sfr_plot]c , we adopt the sfr - dependent reddening formalism recast in luminosity : @xmath58 } ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the observed and intrinsic h@xmath2luminosities , respectively . adopting this dust - reddening correction",
    ", we find consistency with the sed sfrs over 3 dex with an rms of 0.3 dex .",
    "finally in figure  [ sfr_plot]d , we use individual estimates of the @xmath61 from modeling each galaxy sed ( see equation  [ aha ] ) . compared with the correction",
    ", this approach significantly reduces the scatter ( rms of 0.24 dex ) .",
    "figures  [ ha_pred ] and [ sfr_plot ] illustrate the following results :    1 .",
    "the assumption of @xmath57 mag applies for observed h@xmath2  luminosities of @xmath810@xmath6210@xmath63 erg s@xmath13 ( observed sfrs above @xmath80.210 m@xmath46  yr@xmath13 ) , but is invalid for galaxies with sfrs @xmath64 0.2 m@xmath46  yr@xmath13 .",
    "2 .   dust reddening is greater in cases with higher h@xmath2  luminosities , which have been suggested by previous studies .",

    "the h@xmath2  luminosity - dependent relation succeeds in making the two independent estimates of sfr agree across three orders of magnitude ( @xmath6510 m@xmath46  yr@xmath13 ) with an rms of 0.3 dex .",
    "this suggests that the behaviors of dust in star - forming galaxies have remained the same ( relative to the h@xmath2  luminosity ) over the past five billion years .",

    ", we have determined reliable de - reddened sfrs that can predict the h@xmath2 luminosity over 3 dex , and suggests that sfrs derived from full sed modeling can be used as a reliable substitute when direct h@xmath2  measurements are unavailable .",
    "these comparisons also indicate that dust reddening for the gaseous component is more significant than the stellar component , and is in agreement with @xcite .",
    "we used narrow - band imaging ( at @xmath89200  and @xmath89750 ) to identify large samples of line - emitting galaxies in the subaru deep field . in our previous paper",
    "we developed broad - band color cuts to isolate those produced by the h@xmath2  line at @xmath9 . in this paper",
    "we present new spectroscopy of @xmath67400 nb excess emitters .",
    "we confirm that the overwhelming majority of them are true line emitters and that the previously used color selection technique is highly efficient for identifying h@xmath2  emitters .",
    "we then find that the gas extinctions that we measure from the balmer decrement increase systematically with higher h@xmath2  luminosity and with higher stellar mass .",
    "in particular , the correlation with h@xmath2  luminosity is consistent with .",
    "finally , we compare the de - reddened sfrs that adopt different reddening corrections with the sfr obtained from modeling the broad - band 10001.5@xmath3 m  sed .",
    "we find that a constant reddening correction is not appropriate for low luminosity galaxies , and that a correction which increases with luminosity proposed by yields a good ( 0.3 dex ) overall agreement with the modeled sfrs over 3 dex .",
    "we also compare the observed h@xmath2  luminosity from nb measurements with those predicted when the sed sfrs are converted to an h@xmath2luminosity and reddened .",
    "we find significant one - to - one agreement over 3 dex with an rms of 0.25 dex .",
    "such finding suggests that broad - band far - ultraviolet to near - infrared sed modeling can yield reliable sfrs for star - forming galaxies at intermediate redshifts modulo direct h@xmath2  measurements .",
