    "we investigate using rydberg atom interactions to deterministically synthesize collective quantum states that can be strongly coupled to an optical cavity for applications in quantum information science , quantum optics and the production of quantum light fields .",
    "the method enables a single or several collective excitations to be prepared in a high - finesse optical cavity . the number of excitations is precisely controlled so that photon number states can be produced using the coupled atoms - cavity system .",
    "the system we describe in this paper differs from typical jaynes - cummings ( jc ) and tavis - cummings ( tc ) physics in that strong atom - atom interactions play a key role in the initial state preparation , which is the focus of this paper .",
    "rydberg atoms have many exotic properties .",
    "for example , rydberg atoms are large , interact strongly with one another , have relatively long lifetimes , and can be manipulated with external electric and magnetic fields @xcite . particularly important to the work presented in this paper , the interactions between ultracold rydberg atoms can be larger than typical frequency stabilized laser spectral bandwidths and kinetic energies at distances of over @xmath2 m @xcite .",
    "the interactions can be manipulated easily with electric fields , relative to valence states @xcite .",
    "there is a broad range of behavior that can be induced when the multi - level character of the interactions is taken into account .",
    "rydberg atom blockade is a result of the strong interactions between rydberg atoms . in rydberg atom blockade ,",
    "the long range interactions between rydberg atoms suppress multiple excitations in a volume in which the interactions are large enough to shift the excitation laser out of resonance with the rydberg atom transition frequency @xcite .",
    "it has been realized over the last 15 years that rydberg atom blockade is useful for a host of applications , particularly in quantum optics and quantum information science .",
    "rydberg atom blockade can be used to control quantum dynamics and prepare interesting quantum states @xcite .",
    "rabi oscillations have been observed in effective two - level ultracold rydberg atoms @xcite demonstrating long coherence times and collective behavior .",
    "collective rabi oscillations on rydberg transitions have even been observed in a thermal rubidium ( rb ) vapor on a time scale below @xmath3ns @xcite .",
    "atoms contained in cavities , both optical and microwave , have been important systems for investigating the quantum - classical boundary in physics . the ability to entangle atoms with light presented by cavity quantum electrodynamics has also served as a model system for applications in quantum information science @xcite . a cavity quantum electrodynamical system with a single excitation or controlled number of excitations is useful both for fundamental studies @xcite and applications that use quantum behavior , particularly those involving quantum entanglement @xcite .",
    "entangled states can be created between distant atoms in one cavity or separate cavities @xcite .",
    "trapping of a single atom in a high - finesse optical cavity has been achieved @xcite .",
    "however , it is technically challenging to couple the light in the cavity to a single atom because of the small absorption cross - section @xcite .",
    "the problem of small absorption cross - sections can be handled by using an atomic ensemble , where light more strongly interacts with collective atomic states .    in this paper",
    ", we theoretically show that one can excite collective @xmath0 atom superposition states using rydberg atom interactions that can be strongly coupled to a high - finesse cavity .",
    "we observe @xmath4 enhancement of the rabi oscillations within the cavity showing that the collective state can be realized @xcite and analyze the decay mechanisms that affect this interacting many - body system .",
    "collectively enhanced cooperativity factors help to improve the efficiency of photon generation out of the cavity .",
    "the efficiency can be improved by increasing the number of atoms .",
    "we also show that by chirping the laser excitation pulses in time , the single atom rydberg blockade effect can be suppressed and we can create two rydberg excitations within the blockade radius that are coupled to the cavity .",

    ", the state of the collective atoms - cavity system can be controlled .",
    "rydberg atom blockade plays an important role in this process , since we are interested in cases where a single or controlled finite number of coherently shared excitation(s ) are produced in a collection of @xmath9 state rb atoms .",
    "the @xmath0 interacting atoms - cavity system is within the reach of experimental realization @xcite .",
    "the system can be used to prepare single photons using a single excitation and more complex quantum light fields by preparing multiple excitations in the cavity .",
    "recently , a jc model in the optical domain has been proposed for investigating rydberg blockaded atomic ensembles in a cavity .",
    "the transmission through the cavity was studied numerically by monte - carlo simulation @xcite .",
    "in contrast to this work and others , our studies resemble a pumping scheme for inverting the population of a laser , except the upper state of the lasing transition is prepared in a collective state .",
    "the pumping scheme is similar to a raman or superradiant laser and work done on low atom number masers and micromasers .",
    "however , for these types of lasers and masers , the atoms are coherent but non - interacting @xcite .",
    "our approach is useful for single photon generation @xcite , as well as the generation of other types of quantum light fields , and coherent optical manipulation for quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "the collective atoms - cavity system can also be important for generating unique quantum states such as superposition states of the atomic ensemble @xcite .",
    "the approach does not require phase matching and it may be easier to use this system than those based on phase matching to create more elaborate quantum light fields @xcite .",
    "creating arbitrary quantum light fields remains an important challenge for quantum optics , so it is useful to explore a wide range of different strategies .",
    "the method that we explore in this paper may have technological and experimental advantages because the collective state is prepared on a set of transitions which have significantly different excitation wavelengths , @xmath10 nm for all transitions in rb , than the cavity mode to which it is coupled .",
    "the cavity output can be filtered and detected with low background .",
    "fig .  [ fig:1 ] shows a conceptual drawing of the experimental setup .",
    "the setup consists of a collection of atoms trapped in a high - finesse optical cavity .",

    "the decay processes that we consider explicitly in our model are also shown .",
    "we envision the atoms to be held in the cavity with a far off resonance dipole trap ( fort ) or a magnetic trap .",
    "the dipole trapping wavelength can ideally be set to a magic wavelength so that the frequency of the @xmath20 transition is fixed in the cavity .",

    "the other side of the diamond system is used to produce a collective state that is close to resonance with a field mode of a high - finesse optical cavity .",

    "the density matrix equations are not easily solvable for an arbitrary number of atoms because the number of states increases dramatically with @xmath0 .",
    "one way to reduce the basis set size in a many - body system is to use a mean - field approximation . for an ultracold rydberg gas",
    "this means each highly excited atom shifts the rydberg levels of surrounding atoms out of resonance with the laser field @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "atomic coherence is damped out and the quantum master equations reduce to many - body rate equations .",
    "this method is useful for understanding excitation suppression due to rydberg atom blockade in cold gases @xcite . a second way to practically address",
    "the increasing basis set size is to utilize the idea of local blockade and truncate the basis set when the number of excitations in the system exceeds some limit @xcite .",
    "the second method is appropriate when the system dynamics are constrained to a subspace of the complete basis .",
    "rydberg atom dipole blockade naturally justifies this approach . in the spirit of the latter approach",
    ", we carry - out our calculations in a truncated hilbert space , similar to that used by saffman and walker @xcite .      in our calculations , we assume that the interaction volume is less than the blockade volume .",

    "the spatial dependence will lead to fluctuations of the atoms - cavity coupling parameters that will decrease as the number of atoms in the collective state increases .",

    "the product of the time the atoms exist in a particular collective state and the dephasing rate due to atomic motion , including heating mechanisms that arise in an experimental scheme , needs to be small . as a consequence ,",
    "our method requires cold samples , @xmath240k , and fast excitation dynamics , @xmath257s .",

    "<S> , the rydberg blockade mechanism plays a key role in the deterministic quantum state synthesis of the atoms in the cavity . </S>",
    "<S> we use numerical simulation to show that non - classical states of light can be generated and that the state that is coupled to the cavity field is a collective one . </S>",
    "<S> we also investigate how different decay mechanisms affect this interacting many - body system . </S>",
    "<S> we also analyze our system in the case of two rydberg excitations within the blockade volume . </S>",
