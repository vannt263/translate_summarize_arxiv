    "dynamical studies have established that supermassive black holes , with masses @xmath4 , occur in the nuclei of most nearby galaxies with stellar bulges ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "yet few of these massive black holes are observed as luminous active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "rather , the palomar spectroscopic survey by @xcite showed that the majority have either no agn signatures or only the weak agn signatures that define them as low - luminosity agns ( llagns ; @xmath5  ergs  s@xmath6 ) .",
    "also , chandra surveys of selected palomar llagns @xcite commonly find x - ray nuclei with @xmath7  ergs  s@xmath6 , leading to @xmath8  ergs  s@xmath6 as an x - ray definition of a llagn .",
    "for the black hole masses involved , such h@xmath9 and x - ray luminosities are highly sub - eddington , that is , much less than the eddington luminosity @xmath10  ergs  s@xmath6 .",
    "understanding the radiative quiescence of these massive black holes has important implications for accretion physics , fuelling and feedback mechanisms , and black - hole growth over cosmic time @xcite .",
    "early theoretical models for weakly - radiating massive black holes invoked radiatively - inefficient inflows ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , jets / outflows ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , and combinations of the two ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the models predicted that continuum emission could emerge in the radio and hard x - ray regions . for llagns ,",
    "these frequency regions offer strong tests of the models because they benefit from high contrast against the stellar emission , little or no obscuration , and subarcsecond angular resolution and astrometry .",
    "significantly , a study of palomar llagns using _ chandra _ , the very large array ( vla ) , and the very long baseline array ( vlba ) , found that the majority are radio loud , defined as @xmath11 or higher @xcite . since llagns may possess radiatively - inefficient accretion flows ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and radio continuum emission is outflow - dominated ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this suggests that such accretion flows can produce outflows more efficiently than standard geometrically thin accretion disks @xcite .",
    "moreover , such radio continuum outflows might have sufficiently stable `` astrometric footprints '' to constrain the proper motions of their galaxy hosts in the extragalactic frame ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , especially for galaxy hosts which lack interstellar water masers .",
    "building upon the work by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite searched in the radio and x - ray regions for llagn signatures from the weakest accretors , namely nearby palomar nuclei showing no or very weak @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "those targets were mainly disk galaxies and the new _ chandra _ detections of them correspond to x - ray nuclei with @xmath13  ergs  s@xmath6 @xcite . with their typical @xmath14 ,",
    "these accretors are feeble emitters with eddington ratios @xmath15 .",
    "still , @xcite obtained vla detections of radio nuclei at the levels predicted from the radio - loudness relation @xcite , proving that the trait of radio loudness holds below @xmath16  ergs  s@xmath6 and continuing to emphasize the potential importance of radio outflows from these modest - mass black holes .    encouraged by these x - ray / radio trends , a next step is to search for continuum signatures of llagns in nearby elliptical galaxies , with their typically higher @xmath17 .",

    "each high - resolution radio detection occurs within the error circle for the galaxy centroid position .",
    "thus each galaxy harbors a bona fide llagn that has been localized at radio frequencies with subarcsecond accuracy .",
    "the position of the high - resolution radio detection of ngc4621 is consistent with the previous radio detection at low resolution , which was taken to mark a candidate llagn .",
    "ngc4697 has no prior radio detection and thus no prior radio astrometry .",
    "candidate llagns have been identified in the high - resolution _ chandra _ images derived from archival data and shown in figures  1 and 2 .",
    "the position of the candidate llagn in ngc4697 is consistent with that reported for source 1 by @xcite .",
    "ngc4621 has no prior x - ray astrometry .",
    "formally , the x - ray positions of these two candidate llagns are consistent with the centroid positions of the host galaxies from ned/2mass .    for ngc4621 and ngc4697 ,",
    "the separations between the high - resolution radio and x - ray positions are about 0.6 and 0.5 , respectively .",
    "the quadratic sum of the 1 @xmath19 error in the radio astrometry ( 0.1 ) and the x - ray astrometry ( 0.3 ) is about 0.32 , leading to normalized separations of @xmath27 for ngc4621 and @xmath28 for ngc4697 .",
    "these normalized separations are less than 3 , implying valid radio / x - ray matches for both galaxies @xcite .",
    "thus the x - ray positions of the candidate llagns are consistent with the positions of their high - resolution radio detections , meaning that ngc4621 and ngc4697 each host a bona fide llagn that has been identified at both x - ray and radio frequencies .",
    "the x - ray sources are therefore referred to as llagns in table  2 and figure  3 .",
    "from table  1 , the x - ray luminosities of the llagns in ngc4621 and ngc4697 conform to the luminosity limit of @xmath29  ergs  s@xmath6 for the x - ray definition of a llagn @xcite .",
    "the tabulated photon indices conform to the range of values , 1.6 to 2.0 , shown by other llagns @xcite .",
    "the x - ray photometry given in table  1 for the llagn in ngc4697 is consistent with that reported for source 1 by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "also , the latter study analyses data from 2000 and from 2003 - 2004 , and finds no evidence for significant spectral or luminosity changes over that long term .",
    "ngc4621 and ngc4697 each host a supermassive black hole with @xmath0 , for which the characteristic eddington luminosity is @xmath30  ergs  s@xmath6 ( table  1 ) .",
    "in stark contrast , the observed x - ray luminosities are lower by about 9 orders of magnitude , and using them as a proxy for a bolometric luminosity , the black holes energizing the llagns in ngc4621 and ngc4697 are found to have eddington ratios @xmath1 ( table  1 ) .",
    "such ratios are very sub - eddington .      for the llagn in ngc4621 , the flux density at 8.5  ghz measured at a resolution of about 10 ( 880  pc ) in 1999 (   [ data - old ] ) is higher than that measured at a resolution of 0.3 ( 26  pc ) in 2006 ( table  1 ) .",
    "this difference could arise from time variability and/or from source resolution effects in ngc4621 .",
    "variability on typical timescales of a few days has been established at 8.5  ghz for other llagns @xcite . a difference",
    "due to source resolution effects in ngc4621 could be linked to jet - like emission driven by the llagn , or to the stellar substructures on scales of about 2 ( 180  pc ) that are traced either kinematically @xcite or photometrically @xcite . but",
    "a stellar origin seems unlikely for two reasons .",
    "first , the palomar spectrum shows only an old stellar population @xcite .",
    "second , if the flux - density difference arises from star formation , then converting it to 1.4  ghz with a spectral index of -0.7 implies a star - formation rate of about 0.0045 @xmath31  yr@xmath6 @xcite , for which the h@xmath9 luminosity @xcite would be about 6 times higher than its observed upper limit @xcite .",
    "the left panel of figure  4 shows a population of discrete x - ray sources , presumably low - mass x - ray binaries .",
    "there also appears to be soft x - ray emission on a scale of a few kiloparsecs , but this faint emission may partly arise from blends of discrete sources and , based on figure  4 , it will be difficult to characterize the diffuse gas potentially available for accretion onto the black hole .",
    "for the llagn in ngc4697 , the flux - density upper limit at 8.5  ghz measured at a resolution of about 3 ( 170  pc ) in 2000 (   [ data - old ] ) is consistent with the detection at a resolution of 0.3 ( 17  pc ) in 2006 ( table  1 ) .",
    "ngc4697 has a probable stellar cluster centered on a dusty disk with a diameter of 7 ( 400  pc ) @xcite .",
    "the right panel of figure  4 shows evidence for soft x - ray emission on a scale of a few kiloparsecs , consistent with prior reports by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this diffuse emission is characterized by a `` temperature '' of 0.33  kev and a central gas density of 0.02  @xmath32 ; this gas , as well as the gas released by the stellar populations , is potentially available for accretion within the black hole s sphere of influence of diameter 0.76 ( 44  pc ) @xcite .",
    "the right panel of figure  4 also shows a population of discrete x - ray sources , identified as low - mass x - ray binaries in prior studies @xcite .      the study of palomar llagns using _ chandra _ , the vla , and the vlba found that the majority are radio loud , defined as @xmath33 or higher @xcite .",
    "that study involved radio sources with flat or inverted spectra , so the cited definition applies equally well at 8.5  ghz as at 5  ghz .",
    "as shown in table  1 , the emission from the quiescent black holes in ngc4621 and ngc4697 is radio - loud , with @xmath34 .",
    "since radio continuum emission is outflow - dominated @xcite , this suggests the presence of a radio outflow on scales less that 26  pc in ngc4621 and less than 17  pc in ngc4697 (   [ data - new ] ) . baring strong projection effects , the length scale of the 8.5-ghz emission from ngc4697 would place it inside the black hole s sphere of influence @xcite .      a relationship among radio luminosity",
    ", x - ray luminosity and black - hole mass was discovered by @xcite and @xcite for accretion - powered systems . for llagns in particular this so - called fundamental plane ( fp )",
    "relation supports the idea that they are massive analogs of black hole x - ray binaries in the low / hard state , with eddington ratios of about @xmath35 to @xmath36 . within this framework ,",
    "general models for the central engine of a llagn ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) contain ( 1 ) a cool , optically - thick , geometically - thin accretion disk with a truncated inner radius ; ( 2 ) a hot , radiatively - inefficient accretion flow ( riaf ) interior to the truncation radius ; and ( 3 ) an outflow / jet .",
    "application of such models to black hole x - ray binaries in the low / hard state can lead to strong tests involving both spectral and timing properties .",
    "for example , the coupled accretion - jet model of @xcite was successfully tested in this way . the outflow emission in that model",
    "was treated using the internal - shock picture widely applied to gamma - ray bursts .",
    "for the low / hard binary tested , the outflow dominated the radio and infrared emission , the thin disk dominated the uv emission , the hot riaf dominated the x - ray emission , and all three components contributed to the optical emission .",
    "in addition , the @xcite model was shown to be consistent with the fp relation @xcite .",
    "cast in the notation of table  1 , the fp relation of @xcite is @xmath37 , with a scatter of @xmath38 . given this large scatter , the relation can be use to estimate the 8.5-ghz luminosity @xmath39 expected for ngc4621 and ngc4697 from their black hole masses and x - ray luminosities ( table  1 ) .",
    "these fp - based predictions are @xmath40 ergs s@xmath6 for ngc4621 and @xmath41 ergs s@xmath6 for ngc4697 .",
    "although these predictions have uncertainties of almost an order of magnitude , both are about that amount below the galaxys observed @xmath42 listed in table  1 .",
    "the black holes in ngc4621 and ngc4697 are very sub - eddington , featuring ratios of about @xmath43 ( table  1 ) . for other similar systems , departures from the fp relation",
    "have been suggested ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . within the context of the coupled accretion - jet model @xcite described above , the very sub - eddington ratios for ngc4621 and ngc4697 place them in the model s so - called quiescent regime @xcite",
    "moreover , the black holes in ngc4621 and ngc4697 are able to generate radio emission which , as argued in the previous subsection , is plausibly jet - like .",
    "thus the `` if the jet persists '' caveat for the quiescent regime seems to be fulfulled , and motivates application of the radio  x - ray ",
    "mass relation for the quiescent regime @xcite .",
    "cast in the notation of table  1 , that quiescent relation is @xmath44 , and the black hole masses and x - ray luminosities in table  1 yield the predicted radio luminosities @xmath3 appearing in table  1 .",
    "those predicted radio luminosities agree , to within a factor of a few , with the observed radio luminosities , also listed in table  1 .",
    "significantly , the radio  x - ray  mass relation for the quiescent regime invokes x - ray emission from the outflow rather than from an accretion flow .",
    "also , @xcite note that their index for the quiescent relation , 1.23 , is in general agreement with earlier pure outflow models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the coupled accretion - jet model @xcite ,",
    "the outflow / jet generates synchrotron emission which is optically - thick near 8.5  ghz and optically - thin at hard x - rays . in the model s quiescent regime @xcite",
    ", the emission from the outflow dominates over that from any thin disk and any hot riaf . specifically , the spectral energy distribution of the outflow curves smoothly across the electromagnetic spectrum , and photon indices near 2 , like those observed ( table  1 ) , seem achievable in the hard x - rays @xcite . for comparison , comptonization in a riaf acts as a natural thermostat , limiting the electron temperature to about 100  kev . at the very low accretion rates associated with the quiescent regime , any feeble riaf would generate 100-kev bremsstrahlung emission which has a photon index of 1.3 in the _ chandra _ band .",
    "such an index is not consistent with the measured value for ngc4621 but is just consistent with the measured value for ngc4697 ( table  1 ) . in the latter case ,",
    "some bremsstrahlung contribution to the 2 - 10  kev luminosity could account for the model s slight overprediction of the 8.5-ghz luminosity .",
    "analysis of _ chandra _ data and vla data shows that the nearby elliptical galaxies ngc4621 and ngc4697 each contain a low - luminosity active galactic nucleus ( llagn ) , identified as a faint , hard x - ray source that is astrometrically coincident with a faint 8.5-ghz source .",
    "these frequency regions benefit from high contrast against the stellar emission , little or no obscuration , and subarcsecond angular resolution and astrometry .",
    "the massive black holes energizing these llagns have eddington ratios @xmath1 , placing them in the quiescent regime .",
    "these quiescent black holes are radio - loud emitters , suggesting the presence of a radio outflow .",
    "application of the radio  x - ray ",
    "mass relation from yuan & cui for quiescent black holes predicts the observed radio luminosiites @xmath3 to within a factor of a few .",
    "importantly , that relation invokes x - ray emission from the outflow rather than from an accretion flow . in the radio and x - ray regions ,",
    "the faint , but detectable , emission from these two massive black holes is therefore consistent with being outflow - dominated .    clearly",
    ", the spectral energy distributions of the llagns in ngc4621 and ngc4697 need to be measured across the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "deep vla observations at frequencies of 1 - 50 ghz would test the yuan & cui prediction of optically - thick emission from the llagns , as well as enable searches for faint , jet - like structures adjacent to the llagns .",
    "also , short - term variability on timescales of a few days has been found at 8.5  ghz for other llagns @xcite .",
    "for each of the llagns in ngc4621 and ngc4697 , evidence for short - term , correlated variability between the radio source and the x - ray source would strengthen the case for their common , outflow origin . finally , more cases like ngc4621 and ngc4697 are needed to better define the population of quiescent llagns , and the improved sensitivity of the expanded vla will help enormously on this front @xcite .",

    "<S> the nearby elliptical galaxies ngc4621 and ngc4697 each host a supermassive black hole with @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> analysis of archival _ chandra _ data and new nrao very large array data shows that each galaxy contains a low - luminosity active galactic nucleus ( llagn ) , identified as a faint , hard x - ray source that is astrometrically coincident with a faint 8.5-ghz source . </S>",
    "<S> the latter has a diameter less that 0.3 ( 26  pc for ngc4621 , 17  pc for ngc4697 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the black holes energizing these llagns have eddington ratios @xmath1 , placing them in the so - called quiescent regime . </S>",
    "<S> the emission from these quiescent black holes is radio - loud , with @xmath2 , suggesting the presence of a radio outflow . </S>",
    "<S> also , application of the radio  x - ray  </S>",
    "<S> mass relation from yuan & cui for quiescent black holes predicts the observed radio luminosities @xmath3 to within a factor of a few . </S>",
    "<S> significantly , that relation invokes x - ray emission from the outflow rather than from an accretion flow . </S>",
    "<S> the faint , but detectable , emission from these two massive black holes is therefore consistent with being outflow - dominated . </S>",
    "<S> observational tests of this finding are suggested . </S>"
