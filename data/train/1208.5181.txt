    "light - matter ultrastrong coupling @xcite means that the coupling strength @xmath0 is comparable to or larger than the transition frequency @xmath1 of excitations in matters ( @xmath2 ) , and it shows a variety of peculiar properties , such as virtual photons in the ground state @xcite , squeezed eigen states @xcite , nearly degenerated ground states @xcite , quantum phase transitions @xcite , and so on .",
    "the ultrastrong coupling has been realized experimentally by intersubband transitions in semiconductor quantum wells @xcite , artificial atoms in superconducting circuits @xcite , and cyclotron transition in two - dimensional electron gas @xcite . in most cases ,",
    "photons with thz or microwave frequency are confined in a cavity , and the cavity photons are coupled with external photonic field ( outside the cavity ) by unignorable dissipation rate ( but small compared to the light - matter coupling ) . in other words , when we neglect the coupling with matters , the real eigen modes of photons are represented as coupled fields of cavity mode and external fields @xcite . as we will discuss in the present paper by the fano - type diagonalization technique @xcite , when the cavity mode is squeezed in the ground state due to the ultrastrong light - matter coupling , the external photonic field is also squeezed in the ground state of the whole system .",
    "however , we can not observe the squeezing nor energy flow by photon detectors if the system is in the ground state . in this paper",
    ", we have developed two frameworks , the master equation and langevin equations with input - output relation .",
    "they are derived by supposing the squeezed external fields and show no photon detection consistently .    in the standard theory of quantum optics @xcite , in order to introduce a dissipation of cavity mode or of excitations in matters , we consider coupling with an ensemble of harmonic oscillators with continuous frequencies , and the oscillators are supposed to be in the vacuum state .",
    "the dissipation of focusing system has been successfully described by such a treatment in both master equation and input - output formalism , at least in the weak and ( normally ) strong light - matter coupling regimes ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively , for dissipation rate @xmath5 ) .",
    "as pointed out in some papers @xcite , the master equation should be derived by considering the eigen states of the focusing system , and the rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) should be performed carefully on the system - reservoir coupling even if the system - reservoir coupling is weak compared to the light - matter coupling ( in the strong light - matter coupling regime ) . in the ultrastrong coupling regime",
    ", such treatment has been performed by beaudoin , gambetta , and blais @xcite .",
    "the dissipation of the ultrastrong coupling systems can be successfully described under the rwa on system - reservoir coupling ( both pre - trace and post - trace rwas are used in terms of ref .",
    "@xcite ) by considering the eigen states of the cavity system ( there are squeezed virtual photons in the ground state ) .",
    "furthermore , the photon detection has also been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and virtual photons in the cavity are not counted by normal- and time - ordering the operators of cavity system .",
    "however , the rwa on the system - reservoir coupling destroys the information on how the cavity system couples with the reservoirs . in other words ,",
    "the reservoirs become a black box , and we effectively suppose simplified reservoirs coupling with the eigen states .",
    "although such a treatment is appropriate and simple for discussing the dynamics of the focusing system , it becomes difficult to discuss the statistics of output photons emitted from the cavity .",
    "there are actually virtual photons not only in the cavity but also in the photonic reservoir even if the whole system is in the ground state , which is naturally derived by the fano - type diagonalization , although the virtual photons are not counted by detectors .",
    "of course , when the cavity system is excited , we can detect photons emitted from the cavity .",
    "whereas antibunching of emission can survive even under the rwa on system - reservoir coupling @xcite , the quantum fluctuation ( squeezing ) of the emission is easily diminished in such treatment , because the interference between reservoir free field and cavity contribution is important for squeezing @xcite .",
    "therefore , in order to fully discuss the quantum statistics of emission in the ultrastrong light - matter coupling regime , we have to develop a comprehensive framework describing the dissipation and emission without using the rwa on light - matter coupling nor on system - reservoir one .",
    "in the weak and normally strong light - matter coupling regimes , the ground state of the whole system is approximately represented by the vacuum states of photonic and excitonic reservoirs ( exactly the vacuum states under the rwa on light - matter coupling ) . in both master equation and input - output formalism , the vacuum reservoirs are usually considered for describing the dissipation , and no photon detection is naturally obtained in the ground state .",
    "then , these three approaches ( analysis of ground state , master equation , and input - output formalism ) are consistent in the standard dissipation theory in the weak and strong light - matter coupling regimes .",
    "however , if we simply suppose the vacuum reservoirs , in the ultrastrong light - matter coupling regime , the master equation and input - output formalism give different results .",
    "this is because the photonic and excitonic reservoirs are not in the vacuum states in the ground state of the whole system , but they are actually squeezed and correlated .",
    "we have to suppose this non - vacuum reservoir state in order to remove the discrepancy between the results of master equation and of input - output formalism .    in the present paper",
    ", we discuss polariton system consisting of two bosonic modes , photons in a cavity and excitations in matter , each of which couples with an ensemble of harmonic oscillators ( photonic and excitonic reservoirs ) . diagonalizing the whole system by the fano - type technique @xcite ,",
    "we find the squeezed and correlated reservoirs in the ground state . by supposing this reservoir state , the master equation certainly guarantees the decay of the polariton system to its original ground state in the closed case .",
    "we also check that , when the polariton system is in the ground state , the virtual photons in the photonic reservoir are not counted by normal- and time - ordering the operators in polariton base . in the input - output formalism , we also obtain no photon detection by supposing the squeezed and correlated reservoirs and by normal- and time - ordering the operators . then , we achieve the consistency of the three approaches ( diagonalization , master equation , and input - output formalism ) even in the ultrastrong light - matter coupling regime .    this paper is organized as follows .",
