    "the first world combination of top - quark mass ( @xmath2 ) measurements has recently been performed by the cdf  @xcite , d0  @xcite , atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite experiments , resulting in a total uncertainty of 0.76 gev ( 0.44% )  @xcite .",
    "all input measurements to the combination use standard techniques based on template , ideogram and matrix element methods which all rely on monte - carlo ( mc ) simulation to calibrate the measurement .",
    "the mass of the top quark implemented in mc generators , however , may differ by @xmath3 from the theoretically well - understood pole - mass  @xcite .",
    "alternative techniques can be exploited allowing for a less ambiguous theoretical interpretation of the measured top - quark mass value which becomes even more crucial now that measurements have reached sub - gev precision .",
    "these alternative techniques include methods with a minimum dependence on mc simulation , for example accomplished by confronting the data to theory calculations .",
    "in addition , production modes other than top quark anti - quark pair production ( @xmath1 ) can be studied or alternative top - quark mass estimators can be used to perform measurements with a different sensitivity to systematic uncertainties compared to the standard techniques .",
    "standard techniques to measure the top - quark mass usually make use of observables obtained via kinematic reconstruction of the @xmath1 decay ( see ref  @xcite for a detailed discussion on kinematic reconstruction techniques ) .",
    "unless in - situ constraints are applied these observables have a strong sensitivity to uncertainties on the jet energy scale .",
    "alternative variables such as the transverse decay length of the @xmath0-hadron ( @xmath4 ) or the transverse momentum of the charged lepton from the top quark decay show a nearly linear @xmath2-dependence . since the reconstruction of these observables is based on the tracking systems and the electromagnetic calorimeter ( electron @xmath5 ) , analyses based on @xmath4 or the lepton @xmath5 are less prone to variations in the jet energy scale , however , at the cost of an enhanced statistical uncertainty w.r.t . the standard approach and a large sensitivity to the modelling of the boost of the top quark in mc simulation .",
    "cdf has used both the lepton p@xmath6 and @xmath0-hadron lifetime separately and in a simultaneous fit to measure the top - quark mass in a dataset corresponding to l = 1.9 fb@xmath7 in @xmath8+jets final states  @xcite .",
    "the simultaneous fit to the median @xmath4 and lepton @xmath5 distributions gives @xmath9 .",
    "performing a simultaneous fit results in a reduced statistical uncertainty w.r.t .",
    "the separate measurements as the momentum of the leptons is mostly uncorrelated with that of the @xmath10-quarks . the calorimeter jes uncertainty of the measurement yields 0.3 gev and is smaller compared to the measurements based on standard mass estimators .",
    "cms has performed a top - quark mass measurement based on the @xmath4 variable in a dataset corresponding to l = 19.3 - 19.6 fb@xmath7 and recorded at @xmath11 = 8 tev  @xcite , using @xmath12/@xmath13+jets and @xmath14 final states . combining the three channels the mass of the top - quark",

    ", height=113 ]    as an alternative approach the top - quark mass can be measured from the endpoints of kinematic distributions .",
    "this method was originally developed to determine unknown masses in decay chains in beyond standard model physics scenarios where undetected particles lead to underconstrained kinematics .",
    "cms has applied the method to @xmath1 final states in the dilepton channel  @xcite which give rise to two neutrinos escaping detection per @xmath1 decay .",
    "the measurement is based on the transverse mass @xmath19 , defined as the minimum parent mass consistent with the observed kinematics : @xmath20 since the endpoint of the @xmath19 distribution is sensitive to the parent mass it can be employed as a mass estimator . to solve the dileptonic event kinematics ,",
    "the @xmath1 decay is partitioned to create three variables  including two @xmath19 subsystems and the invariant mass of the @xmath10-jet + charged lepton system ( @xmath17 ) ( see fig .",
    "[ endpoints ] ) . to remove the dependence of the @xmath19 variable on the transverse momentum of the upstream top quarks , @xmath21 is introduced , which uses only momentum components perpendicular to the boost direction of the top quark . constraining the @xmath22 and @xmath18-boson masses to @xmath23 = 0 gev and @xmath24 = 80.4 gev respectively",
    ", the top - quark - mass is measured to be @xmath25 , using a dataset corresponding to l = 5.0 fb@xmath7 and recorded at @xmath11 = 7 tev .",
    "the measurement is based on analytic endpoint formulas and thus provides a model - independent technique to determine the mass of the top - quark . performing a simultaneous fit to the endpoints of the 3 distributions , the top - quark , @xmath18-boson and @xmath22 masses",
    "can be determined , allowing for a test of mass determination methods that may be used in beyond standard model physics scenarios .",
    "the theoretical dependence of the @xmath1 cross - section on @xmath2 can be exploited to extract the mass of the top - quark from measurements of @xmath26 . comparing the measured cross - section to the theory calculation ,",
    "the top - quark mass can be measured unambiguously in the renormalization scheme used in the @xmath27 calculation .",
    "the criteria applied to select the @xmath1 sample for the @xmath26 measurement , however , introduce a residual dependence of the acceptance  and , hence , of the measured cross - section  on the top - quark mass implemented in mc simulation .",
    "usually @xmath28 is assumed to parameterize the @xmath2-dependence of the measured @xmath1 cross - section in these measurements .",
    "the top - quark mass has been measured in both the pole - mass and @xmath29 scheme at approximate nnlo by d0 , using @xmath8 + jets final states  @xcite in a dataset corresponding to l = 5.3 fb@xmath7 .",
    "assuming @xmath28 for the experimental @xmath2-dependence of the measured @xmath1 cross - section yields a pole ( @xmath29 ) mass of @xmath30 gev ( @xmath31 gev ) while the alternative scenario with @xmath32 has been checked and found to result in a shift of 2.5 gev ( 2.6 gev ) of the extracted pole ( @xmath29 ) mass .",
    "cms and atlas have measured the top - quark pole mass in dileptonic @xmath1 final states at nnlo+nnll accuracy  @xcite .",
    "using data recorded at @xmath11 = 7 tev ( l = 2.3 fb@xmath7 ) , cms measures a top - quark pole mass of @xmath33 while atlas has performed a combined measurement using datasets recorded at @xmath11 = 7 tev ( l = 4.6 fb@xmath7 ) and @xmath11 = 8 tev ( l = 20.3 fb@xmath7 ) , obtaining @xmath34 .",
    "for the latter measurement the experimental @xmath1 cross - section shows only a marginal dependence of @xmath35 on @xmath36 ( see fig .",
    "[ crosssection ] ) .",
    "a novel technique to determine the top - quark pole mass has been introduced in  @xcite which is based on the normalized @xmath1 + 1 jet cross section , differential in the invariant mass of the final state jets : @xmath37 with @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "this method has been applied by atlas , using @xmath8+jets final states in a dataset corresponding to l = 4.6 fb@xmath7 , recorded at @xmath11 = 7 tev  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 + 1 jet system is reconstructed via a kinematic fit , where events are kept if the highest transverse momentum jet not assigned to the @xmath1 decay fulfills p@xmath40 . to extract the top - quark pole mass the @xmath41 distribution in data",
    "is unfolded to parton level and compared to the theoretical prediction at nlo+ps accuracy ( see fig .",
    "[ diffcrosssection ] ) , yielding @xmath42 .",
    "the theoretical uncertainties on the nlo+ps prediction  including pdf , renormalization and factorization scale uncertainties  are largely reduced due to the usage of the normalized cross - section .",

    "direct top - quark mass measurements make use of mc samples  generated at different top - quark input masses  to parameterize the shapes of the mass estimator , usually invariant mass distributions , as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "in addition to this approach , cms has used fixed - order nlo calculations  which imply an unambiguously defined pole mass  to extract the mass dependence of the invariant mass of the @xmath10-jet + lepton system ( @xmath44 ) in dileptonically decaying @xmath1 pairs  @xcite . to measure the top - quark mass , the shape of the @xmath44 distribution in data",
    "is compared to the fixed - order calculation mcfm  @xcite in the visible phase - space ( see fig .",
    "[ mlbfig ] ) .",
    "since the analysis is performed at reconstruction level the predicted @xmath44 distribution @xmath45 is folded to the reconstruction level @xmath46 @xmath47 where a dedicated response matrix @xmath48 is calculated for each systematic variation and seven values of @xmath2 based on mc simulation ( madgraph  @xcite + pythia  @xcite ) .",
    "the several response matrices as well as the measured @xmath44 distribution will be made publicly available . using a dataset corresponding to an integrated luminosity of l = 19.7 fb@xmath7 and recorded at @xmath11 = 8 tev the shape fit of the nlo mcfm prediction to the measurement yields @xmath49 gev .",
    "the result is consistent with the top - quark mass obtained when using mc simulation matched to parton shower ( madgraph+pythia ) instead of the fixed - order mcfm calculation , which gives @xmath50 gev .",

    "for the first time the top - quark mass has been measured in topologies enhanced with single top quarks produced in the @xmath51-channel by atlas  @xcite . due to their electroweak production mode ,",
    "single top final states show different sensitivity to signal modelling uncertainties compared to @xmath1 production , such as the modelling of color flow .",
    "the measurement uses a dataset corresponding to an integrated luminosity of l = 20.3 fb@xmath7 and recorded at @xmath52 .",
    "signal events are selected using a neural network , where the training is performed only against non top - quark backgrounds to enhance the statistical sensitivity of the measurement .",
    "the data sample used for the measurement of the top - quark mass comprises @xmath53 50% single top @xmath51-channel , @xmath53 23% @xmath1 and @xmath53 27% non - top background events .",
    "a template method is applied to measure the top - quark mass , where final states with @xmath1 and all single top channels are treated as signal .",
    "the top - quark mass is measured to be @xmath54 , with the dominant source of systematic uncertainty stemming from the jet energy scale .",
    "given the sub - gev level precision reached by the direct top - quark mass measurements , exploring and developing alternative methods has become an important task to further improve our understanding of the systematic uncertainties and the interpretation of the measured top - quark mass value .",
    "these alternative methods include techniques which are largely independent of mc simulation as well as measurements using alternative observables and final states which are sensitive to different systematic uncertainties .",
    "though most of the alternative measurements of the top - quark mass are not yet competitive with the standard approaches , their precision is ever increasing .",
    "the higher data statistics provided in run 2 might allow for a further improvements of the alternative techniques and the realization of new approaches , e.g. as proposed in  @xcite and investigated in  @xcite .",
