    "we assume equal masses for neutrinos and anti - neutrinos .",
    "for simplicity we have assumed that the two mixing angles that diagonalize the matrices @xmath22 and @xmath23 are equal ( i.e. @xmath24 ) .",

    "it is at times ( but not always ) a good approximation to consider two flavours only , depending on the parameters which one is studying .",
    "we adopt this in our calculations .",
    "this is tantamount to assuming that @xmath27 is small ( below the chooz @xcite bound ) and so is @xmath28 ( compared to @xmath29 ) and thus matter and related three - flavour effects can be safely neglected . as shown in @xcite matter effects show up in atmospheric neutrinos for @xmath30 and baselines above 7000 km .",

    "which term is larger for a given set of parameters and the energy , the mixing angle and oscillation length can vary dramatically with e. thus precision oscillation measurements can set unprecedented bounds on such effects . also , in order to see any observable effect of cptv , one must have both cpt - even and cpt - odd terms to be non - zero .",
    "in order to quantitatively demonstrate the feasibility of using atmospheric neutrinos as a source of detecting and putting bounds on cpt violation , we focus on a typical detector which can detect muon energy and direction and also identify its charge .",
    "the simplest choice of a suitable prototype is an iron calorimeter , which employs well - understood technology .",
    "such a detector was proposed for gran sasso ( monolith ) @xcite and is also currently being planned for a location in india ( ino ) @xcite , with initial data - taking by 2007 .",
    "it is contemplated as both a detector for atmospheric neutrinos and as a future end detector for a neutrino factory beam .",
    "the atmospheric neutrino physics program previously studied in the literature in the context of a magnetized iron tracking calorimeter includes attempting to obtain conclusive proof that neutrinos oscillate by observation of a @xmath0 dip in the up - down ratio of atmospheric neutrino induced muons , and a more accurate pinning down of oscillation parameters .",
    "however , its usefulness as a detector for cptv parameters using atmospheric neutrinos has not been studied earlier .",
    "our prototype is a 50 kt iron detector , with detection and charge discrimination capability for muons , provided by a b field of about 1.2 tesla .",
    "we have assumed a ( modest ) 50% efficiency of the detector for muon detection and a muon energy resolution of within 5% .",
    "we have factored in a resolution in @xmath0 of 50% at full width half maximum , and incorporated the requisite smearing in our event - rate calculations .",
    "the resolution function is best parameterised by an exponential damping term given by , @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "in the calculations presented here , we have assumed that the atmospheric neutrino problem is resolved by @xmath40 oscillations . specifically , we use the following input parameters : @xmath41 , @xmath42 = 1 , which are consistent with best fit values determined by the most recent analyses of atmospheric data combined with chooz bounds @xcite .",
    "in addition we have used the bartol atmospheric flux @xcite and set a muon detection threshold of @xmath43 gev . for",
    "neutrino energies below @xmath44 gev the quasi - elastic @xmath13-nucleon crosssection has been used , while above this energy we have put in the dis value of the crosssection .",
    "the number of muon events have been calculated using    @xmath45    where @xmath46 is the number of ( isoscalar ) nucleons in 1kt of target material and @xmath47 is the detector mass .",
    "our results are obtained from a simple parton level monte - carlo event generator .",
    "we have used cteq4lq @xcite parametrisations for the parton distribution functions to estimate the dis crosssection .    finally , we comment on the exposure time necessary to see a dependable signal .",
    "since the number of @xmath35 atmospheric events will be significantly smaller than the number of @xmath13 events , reducing the statistical error in the ratio will require an exposure time that enables observations of a sufficient number of @xmath48 events .",
    "our calculations indicate that an exposure of @xmath49 kt - yr would be sufficient for statistically significant signals to emerge .",

    "figure  [ fig : fig1 ] shows the variation of the ratio of total ( up + down ) muon survival events to those of anti - muons , plotted vs @xmath1 for various values of @xmath51 .",
    "the solid line in each of the plots is the ( cpt conserving ) = 0 case , shown for comparison .",
    "the overall shape and position of this ( solid ) curve is representative of the ratio of the two crosssections ( @xmath13 vs @xmath35 ) at the relatively low ( few gev ) energies which dominate the event - rates .",
    "the small wiggles and variations are a result of the various energies and lengths involved and angular differences in fluxes which characterize the overall atmospheric neutrino spectrum .    from equation  3",
    ", we see that the cptv difference in probabilities will become zero whenever @xmath56 ( @xmath57=integer ) , resulting in a node ( _ i.e. _ an intersection with the @xmath58 curve ) .",
    "the positions and the number of nodes for the various curves nicely correspond to these expected `` zeros '' of cptv and also provide a way of distinguishing between them .",
    "clearly , parameter values of the order of @xmath59 should be nicely discernible in these observations .",
    "we note that here the effects of the cptv parameters are maximal at baseline length @xmath60 km , thus neglecting matter effects is justified even if @xmath61 is close to the chooz upper bound .    in figure",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , we plot the same ratio of event - rates vs @xmath0 . the nodal position is now dictated by the term @xmath62 , resulting in a common node for the various @xmath51 values at @xmath63 .",
    "the plots also show a significant dip near @xmath64 km / gev .",
    "this is explained by the fact that @xmath65 for this value . in equation  2",
    ", the sine function has its maximum slope at this value of its argument , and hence the survival probabilities for @xmath13 and @xmath35 differ maximally here due to the sign difference of the terms , providing highest sensitivity to the presence of cptv parameters .",
    "we note that in the vicinity of the dip the antineutrino event - rate increases and the neutrino rate decreases , which consequently tends to reduce the statistical error in the ratio , aiding detection .",
    "this set of curves provides heightened sensitivity to the @xmath66 of cptv , without the same discriminating sensitivity ( between various values ) of the plots in figure  1 .",
    "for instance , cptv induced by parameter values as low as @xmath67 can be detected .",
    "for a lower value of , say @xmath68 , the curve tends to creep back closer to the @xmath69 solid line .",
    "very recently , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite considered the bounds on various types of new physics coming from super - k and k2k data .",
    "they obtain @xmath70    * conclusions :* atmospheric neutrinos in a detector capable of measuring muon energy and direction and identifying its charge can allow us to set significant bounds on all types of cptv in the neutrino sector .",
    "these bounds compare very favourably with those possible from future neutrino factories @xcite .",
    "specifically , the charge discrimination capability of such a detector when coupled with the significant @xmath1 and @xmath3 ranges which characterize the atmospheric neutrino spectrum provides a potent and sensitive probe of such violations . by calculating the ratios of muon and anti - muon events and studying their variation with @xmath1 and @xmath0",
    "we have shown that the presence of cptv can be detected provided @xmath71 .",
    "for somewhat higher values of @xmath51 , it is also possible to obtain a measure of their magnitudes by studying their minima and zeros as discussed in the text .",
