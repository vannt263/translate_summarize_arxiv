    "in - plane confinement is achieved by the photonic band gap introduced by the air holes etched in a high - index membrane , while out - of - plane confinement relies on total internal reflection at the membrane - air interface .",
    "historically , phc cavities are not designed for good mode - matching ; however , far - field optimization of phc devices has been recently an active area of research@xcite . in particular , the h1 defect@xcite , formed by removing one hole from a triangular lattice of air holes , is a promising candidate for the applications described because of its orthogonally - polarized , spectrally - degenerate dipole modes .",
    "although fabrication imperfections lift the degeneracy of the two dipole modes , some post - fabrication techniques have been implemented to restore the degeneracy@xcite .    here",
    "we show that h1 phc microcavities can be optimized for high extraction efficiency while maintaining a high q. we optimize the far - field emission patterns of our devices and suggest a compromise design in which we can achieve a collection efficiency of @xmath12 into a numerical aperture of 0.8 while maintaining a high q of 15,000 in simulation .",

    "in such a geometry , if a mode is an eigenstate of the wave equation , then any rotation of the mode by @xmath19 is also an eigenstate .",

    "we find the single - mode fiber coupling by calculating the mode overlap of the far - field phc mode with a gaussian of specified mode diameter , which is the guided mode of the fiber .    the simulated quality factor and collection efficiency for cavities with different outward shift values are plotted in fig .",

    "the data indicate that for the specific air gap separation of 925 nm , the q is virtually unaffected when this bottom reflector is introduced ; however , the collection efficiency changes significantly .",
    "this is partially due to the fact that the collection efficiency maximum is 50@xmath0 for simulations without a bottom reflector , while it can be as high as 100@xmath0 when the bottom relfector is taken into account . for the optimized @xmath41 device",
