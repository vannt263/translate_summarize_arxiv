    "although we will be mainly interested in @xmath0 yang - mills - higgs ( ymh ) dual models , most of our discussion will also apply to a general compact simple @xmath2 with nontrivial center .    in our model",

    "we also showed this type of description extends to correlated monopoles and center vortices , configurations that in the lattice are known as chains .",
    "now , the general discussion about the group weights and the topology for @xmath1 vortices in dual superconductor ymh models @xcite is similar to that for magnetic @xmath1 thin center vortices in pure ym @xcite-@xcite .",
    "therefore , a part of the analysis for ymh hybrid states should be similar to that for ym correlated vortices and monopoles . as we will see , in the ymh model defined by a gauge group @xmath2 , the defects of a local frame for the lie algebra @xmath19 will provide the guiding centers for the smooth hybrid configurations .",
    "for this aim , the higgs potential will be chosen such that the vacua are labeled by @xmath20 , the adjoint representation of @xmath2 .",
    "as a concrete example , we shall consider as many adjoint higgs fields as the dimension of @xmath19 , propose a flavor symmetry with global group @xmath20 , and construct a potential whose terms only involve the product in the algebra .",
    "however , the general discussion could also be applied to other potentials with the same symmetry breaking pattern , and diagonal and off - diagonal sectors , setting a scale for the monopoles and center vortices .",
    "this type of model has also points of contact with the @xmath0 ymh model in @xcite , describing center vortices by means of adjoint higgs fields along directions orthogonal with respect to a diagonal sector , although in that case the diagonal sector has been frozen in a way it does not contribute to the energy .",
    "the flavor symmetry also plays an important role in models containing non abelian vortices @xcite , constructed with as many fundamental higgs fields as the dimension of the fundamental representation of @xmath2 .    regarding the two different aspects related with center vortices and monopoles , namely , their study in either the context of dual superconductor ymh models with gauge group @xmath2 , or of pure ym theory with chromoelectric gauge group @xmath3 , the following remarks are in order .",
    "first , it is important to underline that , in the former case , a single configuration has a direct physical meaning , representing the chromoelectric confining string or junction acting between heavy quark probes . on the other hand , in the latter , a single configuration has no direct physical meaning , but represents possible virtual processes in @xmath21 euclidean spacetime , to be summed in physical objects such as the partition function .",
    "second , while in ymh models the topological objects are smooth and essentially classical , in pure ym theory they are initially singular , but lattice results lead to consider the possibility they could become thick and relevant due to quantum effects @xcite .",
    "the hope is that in pure ym the effective action of magnetic topological configurations become small or negative @xcite . in that case",
    ", they would proliferate and lead to a dual superconductor picture where similar topological objects , in a higgs phase , represent the different states of the confining gluon field .",

    "this is done in the framework of lattice inspired effective models , which also deal with topological defects , but on the side of the pure ym theory we are intending to describe . finally , in  [ conc ] we present our conclusions .",

    "the general picture is completed with a heuristic discussion about what could be the relation between the ymh model with gauge group @xmath2 and pure ym with gauge group @xmath3 .",
    "the natural choice of external sources in the ymh model , to describe quarks in different irreducible representations of @xmath3 , is also addressed .",
    "the idea is that configurations involving monopoles , center vortices and vortex - monopole junctions ( chains , in lattice language ) also appear in pure ym theories defined on the lattice .",
    "the abelian projection , leading to ensembles of monopoles , and the center projection , where only the center vortex degrees are maintained in the averages , proved to be very successful to describe some of the properties of the confining force .",
    "chains are also candidates to explain the different aspects of this force .    in continuum",
    "euclidean ym theory , the different projections can be simulated by considering ensembles of magnetic defects , characterized by a phenomenological measure that contains dimensional parameters . in @xmath21 , the monopole component is formed by looplike defects , placed at the border of observable center vortex worldsheets , and unobservable dirac worldsheets . as is well known , in abelian projection scenarios , an effective description of this component is expected to be a _ field _ theory .",
    "this comes about as the monopole ensemble contains a sum over different numbers of closed worldlines , that is , a second quantized field theory .",
    "as the possible elementary charges of ym monopoles are roots spanning the lattice @xmath750 , the abelian projected effective model contains as many charged fields as the number of positive roots .",
    "these modes were identified with the off - diagonal flavors of the abelian projected ymh model , when defined with adjoint higgs fields transforming in @xmath750 , that is , it is natural identifying @xmath751 .    in this regard , it would be interesting to look for the ensemble whose large distance behavior is described by the complete ymh model we proposed , although obtaining an effective model outside the abelian projection assumption is a difficult task , as well as dealing with ensembles of vortex - monopole junctions in @xmath21 .    because of the identification @xmath751 , the ymh center vortex charges become weights of the universal covering of @xmath752 .",
    "in addition , in dual language , we have shown that the mesonic and baryonic ym wilson loops become naturally represented by external pointlike monopole sources , with weights of the irreducible representation of @xmath3 where the quark probes are defined .",
    "that is , the quark sources can be matched and confined by center vortices , junctions formed by them , and junctions containing interpolating monopoles . in the ymh model , these configurations are smooth , in contrast to what happens in the ym theory .",
    "they are solutions to the classical equations of motion , representing normal and hybrid mesonic and baryonic states .",
    "further research on this direction , performing a numerical analysis of the equations , will permit to obtain the model s potential between a quark / antiquark pair , for various irreducible representations , and the field distribution of confining strings and valence gluons inside hadrons .",
    "i am grateful to nick manton for very helpful discussions , and david tong , for raising interesting questions that motivated this work .",
    "i would also like to thank for their hospitality the damtp , during the completion of this project , and the ictp , during a visit .",
    "the conselho nacional de desenvolvimento cientfico e tecnolgico ( cnpq - brazil ) , the fundao de amparo a pesquisa do estado do rio de janeiro ( faperj ) , and the proppi - uff are acknowledged for the financial support ."
