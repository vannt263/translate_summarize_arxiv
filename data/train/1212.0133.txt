    "numerous experiments in the last two decades have shown that the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) is a powerful cosmological probe .",
    "the temperature anisotropy of the cmb has now been mapped to exquisite precision by many experiments ( e.g. - @xcite ) , yielding tight constraints on the standard @xmath0cdm cosmological model @xcite .",
    "many current and upcoming experiments focus on measuring cmb polarization , which potentially encodes information from long before the epoch of matter - radiation decoupling .",
    "cmb polarization can be decomposed into two orthogonal bases : the  @xmath1-mode \" , a curl - free mode , and the  @xmath2-mode \" , which possesses a curl or handedness .",
    "the shape of the @xmath1-mode power spectrum has been measured and is consistent with the @xmath0cdm cosmological model predicted by the temperature power spectrum .",
    "multiple experiments have now measured the @xmath1-mode and temperature cross @xmath1-mode power spectrum @xcite .    primordial @xmath2-mode polarization , however , is not a facet of the standard @xmath0cdm model of the universe .",
    "instead , the inflationary paradigm predicts the existence of a stochastic gravitational wave background ( gwb ) that would imprint a unique pattern on the surface of last scattering @xcite . while this faint signal does affect the cmb @xmath1-mode and temperature power spectra , the gwb s effect is degenerate with other parameters .",
    "only the @xmath2-mode polarization provides a unique and direct probe of the gwb .",
    "this signal is expected to peak at degree angular scales with an amplitude determined by the energy scale of inflation @xcite .",
    "a detection of the @xmath2-mode signal would provide strong evidence for an inflationary phase in the early universe .",
    "detection of the sought - after @xmath2-mode signal presents many difficulties .",
    "first , the inflationary @xmath2-mode amplitude is extremely small compared to sky temperature , the cmb s temperature , and even its temperature and @xmath1-mode anisotropy .",
    "currently , the most restrictive limits , derived from temperature anisotropy , put an upper limit on the expected @xmath2-mode signal of less than 200 nk @xcite .",
    "second , polarized emission from galactic and extra - galactic objects acts as a foreground contaminant for cmb polarization measurements . even in the case of optimistic predictions for the signal amplitude ,",
    "models suggest that foreground contamination could be an order of magnitude larger than the @xmath2-mode signal at the largest angular scales @xcite .",
    "finally , exquisite control of systematic and instrumental effects , down to the tens of nk level , will be required before a detection of @xmath2-modes can be claimed with confidence .",
    "one approach to mitigating systematic errors is to modulate incoming polarization , thereby shifting the signal to higher frequencies and away from lower frequency systematic contaminants .",
    "rapid modulation eliminates concerns about time varying thermal , optical , or electrical fluctuations that often change on much longer time scales .",
    "in essence , modulation speed can be used to tune the signal band of the instrument , otherwise set by a combination of scan speed and beam size , placing the signal away from microphonic lines and low frequency @xmath3 noise .",
    "the lack of limitation on scan speed expands the parameter space for observation strategies .",
    "modulation also mitigates polarized systematic effects that are introduced by optical elements between the modulator and the detector .",
    "there are additional benefits to polarization modulation .",
    "the reconstruction of the stokes q ( or u ) parameter requires two independent measurements at different detector angles , typically done by two detectors .",
    "mismatched detector properties , such as those caused by caused by differential spectral response , differential pointing , and mismatched transfer functions , can result in spurious polarization .",
    "modulation allows a single linearly polarized detector to act as an independent polarimeter , removing systematics resulting from combining mismatched detectors .",
    "many cmb polarimeters already employ mechanisms to modulate the incident radiation field about the optical axis of the instrument .",
    "the modulator effectively exchanges electric fields between two detectors ( or a single detector in two orientations ) and decomposes the radiation into two orthogonal bases .",
    "traditional methods for modulation in millimeter wave polarimetry include physical rotation of the entire instrument about the optical axis @xcite , rotation or translation of a wiregrid polarizer @xcite or birefringent half - waveplate @xcite , or parallactic angle rotation (  sky rotation \" ) with respect to the fixed instrument coordinate system .",
    "these classical modes of polarization modulation often employ bulky and complex mechanisms , where any mechanical failure would result in the complete loss of polarization modulation .",
    "faraday rotation modulators ( frms ) are coupled to individual detectors , eliminating the single point failure mode and relieving the need for producing large grids and waveplates that are often limited to tens of centimeters in diameter .",
    "frms can be tuned individually for specific bandwidths , whereas birefringent crystal waveplates require specialized anti - reflection coatings that are difficult to optimize for multiple frequencies .    in addition , polarization modulation via mechanical motion is limited to a low frequency range due to tolerances on vibrational and microphonic noise .",
    "specifically , half - waveplate rotation is limited to modulation frequencies of tens of hertz ( hz ) at most and boresight rotation is limited to much less still .",
    "parallactic angle rotation is also a slow signal modulation and is also location dependent ; at south pole observatories , such as bicep , parallactic angle modulation caused by sky rotation is simply not present .    in this paper",
    "we describe the faraday rotation modulator , a solid - state polarization switch that employs the faraday effect to rapidly modulate polarized light at cryogenic temperatures .",
    "the frm is compact , works over a large frequency range , and is capable of modulation rates up to 10 khz .",
    "specifically , we describe the laboratory testing and galactic observations of the frms in the bicep experiment during the 2006 observing season .",

    "are two alumina cones attached to either side of a ferrite cylinder , providing an impedance match to minimize reflection loss .",
    "the ferrite and cones form a `` toothpick '' assembly .",
    "the input and output waveguides preserve polarization orientation .",
    "the ferrite itself is surrounded by a superconducting solenoid and the entire toothpick assembly acts as a dielectric waveguide , allowing hybrid electric modes to propagate .",
    "details of the design and construction of frms can be found in @xcite .",
    "polarization rotation takes place only within the cylindrical ferrite .",
    "bias currents driven through the solenoid generate a longitudinal magnetic field within the frm , rotating the polarized input by an angle @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the verdet constant , a parameter describing the intrinsic polarization properties of the ferrite material , @xmath6 is the length of the ferrite cylinder , and @xmath2 is the strength of the applied magnetic field .",
    "equation 1 is known as the second - order magneto - optical faraday effect .",
    "the frms were optimized for use in bicep , a ground - based cmb polarimeter designed to measure the b - mode polarization of the cmb at degree angular scales .",
    "bicep is an on - axis refracting telescope with a 0.25 m aperture capable of scanning in azimuth and elevation and rotating about the boresight .",
    "full details of the bicep instrument can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "here we provide only a brief summary .",
    "bicep s focal plane consists of 49 pairs of orthogonally oriented polarization sensitive bolometers ( psbs ) @xcite cooled to 0.25 k. during the 2006 observing season , 25 psb pairs were tuned for band center of 100 ghz ( beam size 0.93 degrees ) and the other 24 for 150 ghz ( beam size 0.60 degrees ) .",
    "each pixel is individually coupled to a stack of three corrugated microwave feed horns cooled to 4k .",
    "the upper edge of the frequency pass band is defined by a series of metal mesh resonant filters placed in front of the feed horn .",
    "the lower edge is defined by the waveguide cut - off imposed by the horn itself .",
    "the frms were present in the optical path of six psb pairs around the perimeter of the focal plane : three at each of 100 ghz and 150 ghz .",
    "figure  [ focalplane ] shows the location of the frms in the focal plane of bicep along with a cross section of the frm positioning in the optical path . for the remainder of the paper the frms at 100 ghz",
    "will be referred to as 100a , 100b , and 100c and at 150 ghz as 150a , 150b , and 150c as labeled in figure  [ focalplane](a ) .",
    "the frms were subjected to a rigorous series of lab and field tests to characterize their behavior and choose optimal operating parameters for bicep observations .",
    "the following section describes the frm laboratory testing and results .",
    "frms modulate mm - wave signals by rotating the direction of polarized radiation relative to the axis of polarization of the corresponding bolometers . to mitigate systematic offsets",
    ", this relative rotation must be well - calibrated and time - invariant .",
    "measurements of the rotation angle as a function of bias current were made by placing an aperture - filling wire grid polarizer ( resulting in a 100% linearly polarized signal ) at the telescope window , biasing the frm with a triangle wave signal , and measuring the voltage response of the psb pair beneath the rotator .",
    "an example output of this technique is given in figure  [ rotangle ] .     and",
    "@xmath7 . ]    as the frm bias current is increased and decreased , the bolometer voltage responds with a sinusoidal wave form that  flattens \" at the turnarounds when the ferrite begins to saturate magnetically . from this data , the relative rotation angle of the frm , @xmath8 ,",
    "can be calculated by @xmath9 where @xmath5 is the bolometer response voltage and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the maximum and minimum of that voltage , respectively .",
    "figure  [ rotangle ] shows the voltage response curve as a function of @xmath8 .",
    "frms in bicep can continuously rotate a polarized signal through a range of approximately @xmath12 .",
    "maximum rotation corresponds to a bias current of approximately 300 ma .",
    "the curves shown in red in figure  [ rotangle ] are for increasing bias whereas the curves shown in blue are for decreasing bias .",
    "the two curves do not overlap due to magnetic hysteresis , where a change in magnetization will lag with respect to the externally applied field due to configurational internal forces .",
    "magnetic hysteresis prevents assigning a one - to - one correspondence between current and rotation angle , creating a degeneracy in the bias angle for values of the bias current where hysteresis is present .",
    "additionally , the degree of hysteresis was shown also to be a function of bias frequency , further increasing the complexity of demodulation . to avoid the complications of magnetic hysteresis",
    "the frms were biased with a square wave signal .",
    "this limited the frm rotation angle to only two states , which could be uniquely determined by the magnitude and sign of the bias current .",
    "the amplitude of the bias signal was chosen such that the frms would have angular modulation of 45 degrees , corresponding to a bias current of approximately @xmath13125 ma . in the reference frame of the bolometer ,",
    "this is equivalent to switching between stokes + q and -q , effectively transforming _ a single _ psb into two orthogonal detectors .",
    "the square wave bias was tuned for a frequency of 1 hz , slightly higher than the 1/@xmath14 knee for the bicep temperature data , generally 0.5 - 1 hz for a single pixel @xcite . during unmodulated cmb and galactic half - scans , bicep shifts the @xmath3 knee by scanning the telescope at a scan speed of @xmath15 .",
    "although the frms are capable of switching at frequencies orders of magnitude higher , the frms in bicep were limited by the bolometer time constants , which had a median of 21 ms across the focal plane .",
    "a 1 hz bias was found to be the best compromise between maximizing integration time per cycle , which lowers the frequency but decreases the noise in demodulation ( section 4.2.3 ) , and minimizing the @xmath3 atmospheric fluctuations .",
    "instrumental polarization ( ip ) is spurious polarization detected when only unpolarized light is observed .",
    "ip can result from use of the frms if frm toothpick assembly is tilted relative to the optical axis of light to the detector .",
    "the frm s ip were measured by placing unpolarized aperture - filling 300 k and 77 k sources at the cryostat window and biasing the frms through their full range of rotation angles .",
    "the resultant fractional ip is defined as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the mean bolometer voltage at 300 k , @xmath18 is the mean at 77 k , and @xmath19 is the peak - to - peak bolometer voltage at 300 k.    individual frm pixels were found to have a repeatable and time - invariant ip signal , with a standard deviation of approximately six percent ( and limited to ten percent ) over the testing period of several months .",
    "the scatter of the mean ip between frm assemblies , however , varied considerably .",
    "the average value of all frm assemblies was found to be 0.59% with a standard deviation of 0.43% .",
    "the maximum value among all the frm pixels was found to be less than 1.2% , for frm150a .",
    "two rotation angle calibration runs were performed with the bicep frms . a dielectric sheet calibrator ( dsc )",
    "was used based on the design from polar @xcite .",
    "the dsc consisted of an eccosorb - lined cylinder with a polypropylene sheet mounted at @xmath20 that served as a beam splitter , creating a small polarized signal from input ambient temperature and sky loads .",
    "the direction of the polarized signal was determined by the angle of the dsc relative to the detector .",
    "the dsc was placed above bicep s optical window , and as the boresight was rotated each psb exhibited a sinusoid - like response that varied as a function of radial position in the focal plane .",
    "model fits using the known properties of the dsc yielded detector polarization angles for each psb in the focal plane .",
    "figure  [ yukical ] shows the timestream response of a bicep psb to dsc calibration with frm modulation . to extract polarization angle ,",
    "the frm output was demodulated into two separate timestreams as described in section 4.2.3 .",
    "the result is shown in the bottom panel of figure 4 .",
    "each timestream was fit to the dsc model for detector angle . given a nominal psb orientation angle @xmath21 , derived from dsc tests in the absence of modulation , the two demodulated timestreams with proper bias should yield detector angles @xmath22 .     degrees . ]",
    "dsc calibration showed proper bias rotation for four of the six frms .",
    "one of the rotator biases was incapable of supplying the currents necessary for full @xmath23 rotation ( frm 100b ) and another was deemed unreliable based on the high standard deviation in its rotation angle ( frm 150c ) . in addition , the psb pair associated with frm 100c had excess noise in both the modulated and demodulated timestreams , rendering it ineffective for celestial polarization studies .",
    "the results of the dsc calibration are summarized in table  [ yukitable ] for all six psb pairs .",

    "although the off - galactic portions of the map show relatively large noise fluctuations due to the low integration time , the galactic signal dominates the noise for both bands .",
    "this is , however , not true for the much fainter polarization signal ( not pictured ) ; a detection of statistically - significant polarization was not seen in this observation .",
    "the large scale noise features that differ between the 100 ghz and 150 ghz maps result from a combination of @xmath3 atmospheric noise and beam smoothing .",

    "this differencing should remove all true sky signal and leave only uncorrelated noise , which should combine as the quadrature sum of the noise in the two individual maps . to estimate the map noise in the non - frm bicep map ,",
    "the scan direction difference map was utilized , yielding 12.5 and 12.0 @xmath95k per effective pixel at 100 and 150 ghz respectively .",
    "given the map noise values in table  [ pixeljack ] for the frm map , the difference map noise is consistent with the quadrature sum of the map noise of the frm and non - frm bicep difference maps .",
    "although many properties of the frms were characterized during initial testing and deployment , the lack of time for field testing prevented a complete characterization for the frms and is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "specifically , properties such as cross - polar leakage and polarization inefficiency were not studied in - depth , and it was assumed throughout this analysis that the frms behaved as ideal devices in these respects .",
    "further , the dsc calibration revealed an imperfect bias signal for most of the frms , but for the deep observations it was assumed that the frms accomplished an ideal rotation of @xmath23 to the nominal angle of the coupled psbs .",
    "deviations from this perfect modulation would result in miscalibrated detector angles and reduced polarization efficiency , which would alter the polarization signal in the q and u maps .",
    "although the frm maps are absolutely calibrated via non - frm bicep maps , the calibration is done using temperature alone .",
    "deviations from the ( assumed perfect ) polarization properties of the frms ( described above ) would result in marked differences between the frm and non - frm q and u difference maps .",
    "the fact that these maps are statistically consistent with each other limits the presence of frm non - idealities to the percent level .",
    "map noise in frm observations 25 was quantified via the scan - direction difference map .",
    "if the map was not sensitive to systematic effects ( e.g. - systematics are not present ) , then the noise should be gaussian white and integrate down with the square - root of the integration time and the square - root of the number of detectors . to validate this assumption for these maps",
    ", the data were reprocessed several times , each time removing a different number of points from the transitions during demodulation .",

    "the results are shown in figure  [ diffmap_nt ] . the data exhibit a decrease in rms map noise with a @xmath96 dependence based on the data cuts .",
    "additionally , at 100 ghz , the data show a @xmath97 increase in the map noise when accumulating the difference maps with a single psb as opposed to the pair . at 150 ghz ,",

    "the @xmath97 reduction in noise is not seen . ]",
    "histograms of the noise distribution were also computed using the unsmoothed difference maps at both frequencies and are shown in figure  [ noisehist ] .",
    "only map pixels with an integration time of 50 seconds or more are used in this analysis to avoid pixels with low integration time weighting the result .",
    "the histograms show that the amplitude distribution of the noise is roughly gaussian and distributed about zero within one standard deviation of the mean .",
    "the mean @xmath13 standard deviation are given by @xmath98 and @xmath99 at 100 ghz and 150 ghz respectively .",
    "assuming these maps are gaussian white noise - dominated , detector noise was quantified by multiplying the q and u pixel values by the square - root of the integration time per pixel and taking the standard deviation across the maps .",
    "this yielded an average instantaneous ( i.e. , single stokes parameter ) `` neq per feed '' of 420 @xmath100 and 501 @xmath100 for 100 ghz and 150 ghz respectively .",
    "the value at 100 ghz is comparable to the values in @xcite , though the value at 150 ghz is elevated by a factor of  1.6 .",
    "the source of the excess noise at 150 ghz is unknown , though the lack of @xmath97 dependence when doubling the number of psbs indicates that systematic effects , such as detector cross - talk , can not be ruled out .",
    "for the majority of the 2006 observing season , the frms remained unbiased in the bicep focal plane . without modulation ,",
    "the psb pairs coupled to the frms functioned as nominal bicep psbs , where the sum and difference of the pair were used to calculate temperature and polarization respectively . using 2006 galactic scans ,",
    "noise was computed for all frm feeds to analyze whether the presence of the frms in the optical path introduced additional noise within the detectors .    to compute the noise , the spectral power distributions for detector sums and differences for each calibrated half - scan",
    "is calculated and averaged for all frm pixels at each band .",
    "this is done after masking , filtering , and sum - differencing each psb pair .",

    "the pair - sum data exhibits increasing 1/@xmath14 contamination from 100 to 150 ghz .",
    "pair differencing removes this contamination , resulting in nearly white noise above 0.1 hz .",

    "previous studies @xcite characterizing the pixels in bicep ( which do not include the frms ) give bicep net values of 525 @xmath101 at 100 ghz and 450 @xmath101 at 150 ghz .",
    "the elevated noise at 100 ghz was found to stem from the psb pair corresponding to a single frm ( 100c ) . when removed , the frm net at 100 ghz is 520 @xmath101 .",
    "both bands show excellent agreement with the quantities derived from observation quality pixels , demonstrating that unbiased frms do not introduce any excess noise into the detectors .",
    "in this paper , we report on the first detection of galactic polarization using fast , active optical polarization modulation .",
    "the observed polarized signal is consistent with both bicep s and other recent experiments maps of galactic polarization .",
    "although observation and testing time limited the scope of the comparison that could be made between the nominal bicep instrument and the bicep instrument modulated by frms , the frms have been shown to be effective solid - state polarization modulators for both laboratory and celestial polarimetry applications .",
    "in particular , the 100 ghz frm was found to exhibit equivalent noise to similar bicep psb pairs without frms , but expands the parameter space for the instrument s scan strategy , relaxing constraints on scan speed and potentially increasing the observed sky fraction .",
    "ultimately , the choice of whether to use a fast active modulator such as a frm depends upon the details and constraints of the experiment .",
    "devices similar to the frms are currently being explored for use in several experiments @xcite .",
    "frm technology could be applied wherever fast solid - state polarization modulation is called for .",
    "frms are a promising technology due to their design flexibility , low systematic polarization , large bandwidth , and ability to be used over a large frequency range .",
    "further , frms have been shown to be functional in both modulating and non - modulating modes without adding noise , making them a flexible option for a mm - wave polarization modulation .",
