    "the main idea of finding solutions to the equations of motion is to start with equation ( [ eoj_tau_loc ] ) and to solve it , assuming the function @xmath37 is a sum of eigenfunctions of the dalembert operator : @xmath49 hereafter we use @xmath50 ( which can be infinite as well ) denoting the number of roots and omit it in writing explicit summation limits over @xmath51 . without loss of generality",

    "momentum tensor of many free massive scalar fields .",
    "if @xmath57 has simple real roots , then positive and negative values of @xmath58 alternate , so we can obtain phantom fields .",
    "using formula ( [ eoj_g_onshell ] ) we obtain the ostrogradski representation  @xcite for action ( [ action_model2 ] ) : @xmath59 one can see that @xmath60 is a local action if the number of roots @xmath50 is finite .",
    "we stress that all the above formulae are valid for an arbitrary metric and the general solution . from now on , however , the only metric we will be interested in is the spatially flat friedmann  robertson  walker ( frw ) metric with the interval given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the scale factor , @xmath63 is the cosmic time .",

    "this model possesses an approximate solution with all scalar fields tending to the minimum of the potential ( i.e. @xmath74 ) and the hubble parameter going to the constant .",
    "such solution was constructed numerically and was proven to be a solution in @xcite .",
    "also the asymptotic form of this solution was derived in @xcite .",
    "it is instructive to investigate the lyapunov stability of the fixed point . using formulae from  @xcite , we come to conclusion the fixed point is asymptotically stable at @xmath75 if at the fixed point",
    "@xmath76 or @xmath77 for some @xmath51 , then this fixed point is unstable . at @xmath78 for",
    "some @xmath51 or @xmath79 one can not use the lyapunov theorem to analyse the stability of the fixed point . note that the conditions ( [ stabcond_frw ] ) are sufficient for stability in not only the friedmann  robertson ",
    "walker metric but also the bianchi i metric  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we shall extend this analysis and consider the stability of the fixed point with respect to arbitrary perturbations .    to compute an approximate solution to ( [ freomtaucsf_frw ] ) one starts with a constant @xmath80 and then computes the correction to @xmath81 using friedmann equations .",
    "then the procedure can be iterated to compute higher corrections .",

    "let s assume it is the first one proportional to @xmath86 constant . then in order to pick the ( slowest ) convergent solution we put @xmath87 .",

    "the first correction to the constant hubble parameter in case only decaying modes in @xmath84 are present is @xmath91 constant @xmath92 is not independent and is related with @xmath93 .",
    "we note that @xmath94 is of order @xmath95 .",
    "the last expression is a good approximation for @xmath81 in the asymptotic regime when @xmath96 .",
    "further one can find the scale factor to be @xmath97",
    "now we turn to the main problem of the present paper : derivation of cosmological perturbation equations in models with a non - local scalar field .",
    "we are focused on the scalar perturbations , because both vector and tensor perturbations exhibit no instabilities  @xcite .",
    "scalar metric perturbations are given by four arbitrary scalar functions  @xcite .",
    "changing the coordinate system one can both produce fictitious perturbations and remove real ones . natural way to distinct real and fictitious perturbations is introducing gauge - invariant variables , which are free of these complications and are equal to zero for a system without perturbations .",
    "there exist two independent gauge - invariant variables ( the bardeen potentials ) , which fully determine the scalar perturbations of the metric tensor  @xcite . to construct the perturbation equations one can use the longitudinal ( conformal - newtonian ) gauge , in which the interval ( [ mfr ] ) with scalar perturbations has the following form ( in terms of the bardeen potentials ) : @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the conformal time related to the cosmic one as @xmath100 .",
    "the the bardeen potentials @xmath101 and @xmath102 are as usually fourier transformed with respect to the spatial coordinates @xmath103 having thereby the following form : @xmath104 and similar for @xmath102 .",
    "the obtained equations contain only gauge invariant variables , so they are valid in an arbitrary gauge .",
    "although the metric perturbations are defined in the conformal time frame in the sequel the cosmic time @xmath63 will be used as the function argument and all the equations will be formulated with @xmath63 as the evolution parameter .    to the background order energy density and pressure",
    "are given by ( [ ep_sol ] ) .",
    "to the perturbed order one has @xmath105 where @xmath106 gives the perturbed @xmath107 components of the stress - energy tensor and @xmath108 is the anisotropic stress . using the einstein equations",
    "one gets that @xmath109 is equivalent to @xmath110 .",
    "the bardeen potential @xmath102 is proportional to the gauge invariant total energy perturbation @xmath111 the function @xmath112 is a solution of the following linear differential equation ( see details in  @xcite ) : @xmath113 here @xmath114 is the equation of state parameter , @xmath115 is the speed of sound , @xmath116 is the comoving wavenumber and @xmath117 the latter quantity is identically zero for a local scalar field , i.e. in the case @xmath118 . therefore , @xmath119 is the attribute of the non - locality here .    for the linearized model ( [ action_model2 ] ) we can consider the background solution as given by ( [ tau_sum ] ) to obtain @xmath120 in the more convenient form . to do this",
    "the following relation is useful @xmath121 using ( [ tau_sum ] ) and the well - known formula @xmath122 one has @xmath123    perturbing the equation of motion for @xmath37 , one has @xmath124 more explicitly this equation can be written as @xmath125 where we have put @xmath126 .",
    "it follows from ( [ eoj_g_onshell ] ) that if for some @xmath127 we have @xmath128 as a background solution , then @xmath129 , contributes only to the second order in the energy ",
    "momentum tensor perturbations . in this paper",
    "we consider perturbations only to the first order , and therefore for all @xmath128 we can put @xmath130 without loss of generality . if @xmath46 has an infinite number of roots , but we select as a background the function @xmath37 , which includes only a finite number of @xmath131 , then only a finite number of perturbations @xmath129 give contribution to the first order perturbation equations , whereas in the second order all perturbations are important .",
    "after some algebra one can get the following expression for @xmath120 @xmath132 where @xmath133 satisfy the following set of equations @xmath134 equation ( [ deltagieps01nlscalar ] ) with the above derived @xmath120 and equations ( [ deltaijeps ] ) in a closed form describe the perturbations in the case of linearized model . comparing these equation with the equation for perturbations in a system with many fields ( see eqs .",
    "( 82 ) and ( 85 ) in  @xcite ) we see they do coincide . thus perturbations become equivalent in the model with one free non - local scalar field and in the model with many local scalar fields . in our model , however , the quantity which should be considered as energy density perturbation is @xmath112 .",
    "functions @xmath135 play auxiliary role and normally should not be given an interpretation .",
    "to understand better what is going on in the discussed type of models it is instructive to see how the curvature and entropy perturbations behave in our model having infinitely many scalar degrees of freedom ( interesting results in analysing this parameters in case of many fields can be found for instance in @xcite ) .",
    "comoving curvature perturbations can be expressed as @xmath136 where @xmath102 is the bardeen potential connected in turn with @xmath112 as ( [ bardeenpsi ] ) .",
    "entropy perturbations defined as @xmath137 can be found as @xmath138 both quantities are gauge invariant and play crucial role in computing various spectral indexes .    in order to figure out the behavior for the curvature and entropy perturbations",
    "it is enough to find out the behavior of only two functions : @xmath112 and @xmath120 .",
    "such a generic form in formulae ( [ isocurv ] ) and ( [ entropy ] ) persists because the theory can be written in the local form .",
    "it is nevertheless obvious that it would be difficult to reach similar results in a general case , when @xmath139 and equation ( [ eoj_g ] ) is not linear in @xmath20 .",
    "moreover , it is not transparent that one can make a significant progress for a general operator @xmath46 even in the linearized model .",
    "there are several specific situations in which we can outline the strategy of the further analysis .",
    "* the first one is already mentioned above and refers to the background configuration where only the finite number of scalar fields is excited .",
    "then in the linear perturbations we will have no impact of the perturbation modes related to the zero background fields .",
    "this statement is obvious having in mind that the local action is quadratic and diagonal in scalar fields . *",
    "the second situation corresponds to particular form of the function @xmath46 such that its roots form a sequence @xmath140 and one can arrange them such that @xmath141 when @xmath51 tends to infinity .",
    "then in the asymptotic regime where solutions for the scalar fields are dumped plane waves ( [ freomtaucsfsoltau_frw ] ) one gets the factor in the rhs of equation ( [ deltaijeps ] ) tending to zero and equations for corresponding @xmath142 become homogeneous . in this case one",
    "can easily solve this equation which now reads @xmath143 here we assumed the coefficient in front of the first derivative to be a constant while the background solutions are the planewaves .",
    "two modes come out when the time grows @xmath144 and therefore we see that there is a decaying or growing mode depending on the sign of @xmath145 .",
    "this constant in the asymptotic regime is given by @xmath146 recall that the stability of the asymptotic solution requires @xmath147 ( see ( [ stabcond_frw ] ) ) and it guarantees that @xmath148 and perturbations vanish . even though it is not the final answer and one still has to solve coupled equations",
    "the claim is that only a finite number of @xmath135 are really coupled with @xmath112 while other functions @xmath135 just produce the inhomogeneity in equation for @xmath112 ( [ deltagieps01nlscalar ] ) .",
    "mathematically we can put all this decoupled modes to be zero but than the problem becomes completely equivalent to the previous case with a finite number of fields in the play . here",
    ", however , we keep trace of other fields even though the are effectively decoupled from the system of equations .",
    "+ one example of the operator giving such a behavior is @xmath149 roots are given by @xmath150 resummation in @xmath120 ( [ explicitdelta ] ) for all the components which are effectively decoupled ( assuming this happens from some @xmath151 ) gives @xmath152 where @xmath153 and @xmath145 are from eq .",
    "( [ deltaijepshomomodesconst ] ) when @xmath154 . * the third situation is when the values of @xmath155 are equidistant meaning @xmath156",
    ". then equation ( [ deltaijeps ] ) in the asymptotic regime becomes @xmath157 the advantage with respect to the general situation is that the the inhomogeneous part of this equation is universal for any number @xmath51 meaning that we can construct homogeneous equations consdering the difference of the latter equations for some @xmath51 and @xmath158 .",
    "it is important to say that all these cases even giving some insight into the problem are not very simple to analyze .",
    "we hope to address this issue in the future analysis of models of this type .",
    "if a complex number @xmath159 is a root of @xmath46 , then @xmath162 is a root of @xmath46 as well .",
    "system ( [ freom ] ) becomes : @xmath163,\\\\[2.7 mm ] \\displaystyle \\dot h={}-\\frac{4\\pi g_n}{g_o } \\left[{\\mathcal{f}}'(j)\\dot{\\tau}^2+{\\mathcal{f}}'({j^*}){\\dot{\\tau^*}}^2\\right ] .",

    "so , in the case of two complex conjugated roots we get a quintom model ( for details of quintom models see reviews  @xcite ) .    what is interesting ( but not surprising , though )",
    "one can not have non - interacting fields passing to the real components .",
    "precisely , fields will be quadratically coupled in the lagrangian .",
    "it means that the usual intuition about field properties ( like signs of coefficients in front the kinetic term or the mass term ) may not work .    following the method outlined in section 2.3 we find the asymptotic solution for the scalar fields with constant @xmath80 to be @xmath180 where @xmath181 .",

    "were explored as well but we have here new models featuring complex masses and complex coefficients in front of the kinetic terms . as it was stressed above",
    "there is no problem with this for the physics of our models while properties of such models , in particular the cosmological perturbations with such scalar fields were not studied in depth .",

    "the main results of this paper are the construction of the perturbation equations in non - local models with one scalar field and arbitrary potential and consideration of the very intriguing example of perturbations .",
    "namely , using the possibility to construct a local equivalent model with many scalar fields we find out that masses of these local fields may easily become complex and such a case constitutes the above - mentioned example .",
    "the characteristic feature of the present setup is that all the local fields in fact are not physical and play a role of auxiliary functions introduced for the reduction of the complicated non - local problem to a known one .",
    "as it was noted in @xcite , for a very wide class of the sft inspired models the local counterpart is not yet studied .",
    "looking strange such configurations do not produce a problem for the model since they are not physical quantities .",
    "perturbation equations for this local model are ( [ deltagieps01nlscalar ] ) and ( [ deltaijeps ] ) where only @xmath231 functions @xmath232 are independent .",
    "the discussion on how a cosmological constant can be generated during the tachyon evolution is presented in  @xcite .",
    "we note that perturbations in a quintom model very close to our setup with a phantom field without potential and an ordinary scalar field with quadratic potential were studied in  @xcite .",
    "perturbations in models with many scalar fields were studied in literature considering various cosmological scenarios @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we have worked the indicative example where two scalar fields with complex conjugate masses are present .",
    "we have demonstrated numerically that in the case @xmath192 the gauge invariant energy density perturbation associated with the matter sector does decay in all wavelength regimes in contrary to ordinary scalar field models .",
    "the general case of complex masses deserves deeper investigation and is partially considered in @xcite .",
    "moreover we singled out configurations when really an infinite set of scalar fields may present but on the other hand there is a chance to analyze in full the system of equations for perturbations .",
    "these are configurations when @xmath233 and when @xmath234 .",
    "this should definitely help in understanding how important quantities like curvature perturbations and entropy perturbations behave .",
    "also the case of double roots is addressed and it is shown that one can again formulate the local equivalent theory and build a closed system of equations",
    ". however , the deep analysis of all these regimes seems to be rather involved and therefore we put it as still open question to be addressed separately .",
    "looking further it is interesting to consider perturbations in other non - local models coming from the sft .",
    "for instance , models where open and closed string modes are non - minimally coupled may be of interest in cosmology .",
    "an example of the classical solution is presented in @xcite .",
    "furthermore it should be possible to extend the formalism presented in this paper to other models involving non - localities like modified gravity setups @xcite .",
