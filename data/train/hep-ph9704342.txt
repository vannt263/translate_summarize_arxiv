    "the qcd `` hard pomeron '' is understood as the solution of perturbative qcd expansion at high energy ( @xmath2 ) after resumming the leading @xmath3 terms .",
    "it is known to obey the bfkl equation@xcite .",
    "it has recently attracted a lot of interest in relation with the experimental results obtained at hera for deep - inelastic scattering reactions at very low value of @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the virtuality of the photon probe @xmath6 and @xmath2 is , in this case , the c.o.m energy of the @xmath6-proton system .",
    "interestingly enough , the proton structure functions increase with @xmath2 at fixed @xmath7@xcite in a way qualitatively compatible with the prediction of the bfkl equation .",
    "however , the phenomenological discussion is still under way , since scattering of a `` hard '' probe on a proton is not a fully perturbative qcd process and moreover , alternative explanations based on renormalization group evolution equations do exist@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the phenomenological success@xcite of parametrizations based on the bfkl evolution in the framework of the qcd dipole model@xcite is quite encouraging for a further study of its properties .    beyond these phenomenological motivations , there",
    "exist interesting related theoretical problems which we want to address in the present paper .  in its 2-dimensional version ,",
    "the bfkl equation expresses@xcite the leading - order resummation result for the elastic ( off - mass - shell ) gluon - gluon scattering amplitude in the @xmath8 transverse plane @xmath9 which depends on the energy @xmath10 and on the 2-momenta of the incoming and outgoing gluons with @xmath11 is the transferred 2-momentum .",
    "@xmath12 is the total rapidity space available for the gluon - gluon reaction . alternatively ,",
    "one introduces@xcite the coordinate variables via 2-dimensional fourier transforms and the gluon green function @xmath13 where 2-momentum conservation in momentum space leads to global translationnal invariance in coordinate space",
    ". the amplitude @xmath14 is solution of the bfkl equation expressed in the 2-dimensional transverse coordinate space and explicit solutions can be obtained@xcite using conformal invariance properties of the bfkl kernel .",
    "we will heavily use these symmetry properties in the sequel .    in our paper",
    ", we will address the problem of finding the amplitudes @xmath15 solution of processes involving @xmath16 external gluon legs where @xmath17 @xmath18 ... ,@xmath19 are their arbitrary coordinates in the plane transverse to the initial gluon - gluon direction . note that @xmath20 @xmath21 is the original bfkl amplitude .",
    "recently , it has been shown@xcite that @xmath22 is equal , up to kinematical factors , to the number density @xmath23 of dipoles existing in the wave - function of an initial quark - antiquark pair ( onium ) after an evolution `` time''@xmath12 ( such can be interpreted @xmath12 in the bfkl equation written as a diffusion process@xcite ) . in the qcd - dipole picture@xcite , gluons are equivalent to a @xmath24 pairs ( in the @xmath25 limit ) which recombine into a collection of independent and colorless dipoles .",
    "the elastic amplitude is thus obtained from the elementary dipole - dipole amplitude weighted by the dipole number densities of each initial state obtained after evolution time @xmath26 using conformal invariance properties of the bfkl kernel , it turns out@xcite that : @xmath27 where @xmath28(resp .",
    "@xmath29 are the components of the dipole density ( resp .",
    "the gluon green s function ) expanded upon the conformally invariant basis , namely : @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the value of the bfkl kernel in the ( diagonal ) conformal basis",
    ". the corresponding eigenvectors are explicitly known@xcite to be : @xmath32 with @xmath33 are the holomorphic ( resp .",
    "antiholomorphic ) components in the 2-d transverse plane considered as @xmath34 and @xmath35 , @xmath36 ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) , are the quantum numbers defining the appropriate unitary representations@xcite of the conformal group @xmath39 .",
    "indeed the bfkl solution ( i.e. , also , the qcd dipole solution ) is given by @xmath40 which can be explicitly calculated in terms of hypergeometric functions@xcite .    in order to generalize these investigations to an arbitrary number of gluons",
    ", we shall use the qcd dipole formalism allowing to express the probability of finding @xmath41 dipoles in an initial one , i.e. the p - uple dipole density after an evolution  time ",
    "@xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44 is the solution of an integral equation which has been proposed in the paper of ref.@xcite , and approximate solutions have been worked out and applied to problems like the double and triple - qcd pomeron coupling@xcite , the qcd dipole production@xcite , hard diffraction@xcite and , more generally , to the unitarization problem@xcite . in particular ,",
    "monte - carlo simulations of the unitarization series based on a numerical resolution of the @xmath44 integral equations have been performed@xcite . however a general expression for the solution of these equations and a physical interpretation of its properties are yet lacking .",
    "it is the purpose of our work to provide such a solution , which is intimately related , as we shall see , to dual string amplitudes emerging from the qcd dipole picture .",
    "our main result is the explicit expression of the p - uple dipole density distributions in the transverse coordinate plane as dual virasoro - shapiro amplitudes@xcite ( for conformal spins all equal to @xmath45 these are the dominant contributions at high @xmath26 we also give the expressions for arbitrary conformal spins ( i.e. for all the conformal components ) in terms of a well - defined generalization of shapiro - virasoro amplitudes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section * 2 * , we derive the qcd dipole equation for @xmath46 ( for zero conformal spins ) .",
    "the solution is found in a compact form in terms of integrals over explicit conformal eigenvectors . in section * 3 * we reformulate the obtained 3-dipole vertex in terms of the koba - nielsen projective - invariant parametrization of the shapiro - virasoro amplitude @xmath47 in the following section * 4 * we show that the solution can be iterated and obtain the triple dipole density distribution in terms of @xmath48 this iteration gives the p - uple dipole distribution in terms of @xmath1 integrands . in section * 5 * we discuss the extension for arbitrary conformal spin and the possibility of finding a target - space realization of the underlying closed string picture emerging from the qcd dipole interactions .",
    "the integral equation satisfied by the dipole pair density @xmath50 see fig.1 , is written as follows@xcite @xmath51 where the integration domain @xmath52 avoids the singularity at the initial dipole end - points @xmath53 the physical meaning of this equation is transparent : the probability of finding a pair of dipoles at given transverse coordinates at time @xmath12 is made of two terms ; the last term in ( 7 ) is the survival probability after @xmath12 of two dipoles , whereas the former corresponds to the probability of creating two new dipoles @xmath54 and @xmath55 which then are surviving till @xmath12 , each with probability @xmath23 . in both cases ,",
    "the survival probability is given by the @xmath56-dependent sudakov - like form factor @xmath57    in fact , it is possible@xcite to reexpress this equation in a way which is explicitely independent of @xmath58 when @xmath59 multiplying both terms of eqn.(7 ) by @xmath60 and differentiating with respect to @xmath12 , one gets : @xmath61 where @xmath62 denotes a parametrization@xcite of the bfkl kernel in coordinate space , namely @xmath63 with the property@xcite @xmath64 in equation ( 8) , the @xmath65 limit can be taken without harm , thanks to the non - singular behaviour of the kernel @xmath62 after regularization .",
    "the kernel @xmath62 is conformally invariant@xcite and its eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are given by equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , respectively .    in order to solve eqn.(8 ) , we shall expand the function @xmath49 on the basis ( 4 ) by writing : @xmath66 where @xmath67 are conjugate variables and @xmath68 is an auxiliary transverse coordinate variable which labels the set of eigenfunctions @xmath69 the solution of eqn.(8 ) is obtained using the known@xcite orthogonality relations of the @xmath70 eigenfunctions @xmath71 @xmath72 with @xmath73 given in ref.(5 ) and @xmath74 inserting the decomposition ( 10 ) into eqn.(3 ) , we integrate both sides of the equation by @xmath75 one finds using relations ( 11 ) @xmath76 where the normalisation factor takes into account the overcompleteness of the eigenbasis , since @xmath77 and @xmath70 correspond to the same component @xmath78 .    introducing finally the components @xmath79 see ( 2 ) , for the single density distributions with their corresponding eigenvalues @xmath80 and eigenvectors @xmath81 one writes @xmath82 @xmath83 @xmath84 @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 are auxiliary coordinates which play for the dipoles @xmath54 and @xmath55 the same r^ ole played by @xmath88 for the dipole @xmath89 , see fig.1 .",
    "the expression ( 15 ) gives the formal solution of @xmath49 in terms of the eigenfunctions of the bfkl kernel which are given in ( 4 ) .",
    "let us comment one after the other the 3 different building blocks appearing in ( 15 )    i)the summation @xmath90 is related to the dipoles @xmath91 @xmath92 and will be used for inserting @xmath49 in cross - section calculations .",
    "it will also restrict the final integration over the quantum numbers @xmath93 through the poles appearing at @xmath94 in the denominators of ( 15 ) .",
    "ii)the factors @xmath95 are the only ones depending on the coordinates @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "interestingly enough , the subsequent interaction terms involving these dipoles , for instance when computing multi - pomeron interactions in the qcd dipole picture@xcite , will be greatly simplified by using factorization and the orthogonality relations ( 11 ) .",
    "these features are already at the root of the derivation@xcite of the equivalence ( see formula ( 1 ) ) between the elastic bfkl and qcd - dipole amplitudes .",
    "iii)the last factor in the solution ( 15 ) , is the triple - dipole vertex @xmath98 in the qcd dipole picture .",
    "it depends on the conformal quantum numbers and auxiliary coordinates of the 3 dipoles which are coupled together in @xmath99 it is the purpose of the next sections to give an interpretation of these vertices in terms of dual amplitudes .",
    "let us first consider the vertex @xmath100 for conformal spins @xmath101 this vertex is physically relevant since it corresponds to the dominant contribution at high @xmath26 in fact , the method used for its evaluation will be valid for any conformal spin . inserting the definitions ( 4 ) in the expression of @xmath102 obtained from the solution ( 15 ) , one gets : @xmath103 our observation is that @xmath104 can be expressed as follows : @xmath105 where @xmath106 is a shapiro virasoro@xcite amplitude with @xmath107 external legs and @xmath108 is a known conformally - invariant tensor of the coordinates , i.e. it is completely fixed@xcite by the symmetry . in order to derive the expression ( 17 ) ,",
    "let us recall the koba - nielsen formulation@xcite of @xmath109 , namely .",
    "@xmath110 where the integration measure is the conformally - invariant one and the powers @xmath111 correspond to scalar products of external momenta on the target space in the closed string realizations of the shapiro - virasoro amplitudes .",
    "note that the string tension can be chosen to be equal to 1 by scale invariance of the solution . in our case ,",
    "the powers @xmath111 are not specified in terms of external momenta but stringent constraints are required on @xmath111 in order to satisfy the requirements of duality and conformal symmetry@xcite namely : @xmath112 it is tedious but straightforward to verify that the constraints ( 19 ) are verified for the set of @xmath111 corresponding to formula ( 16 ) given in table i. from that , one easily obtains formula ( 17 ) with @xmath113 formula ( 20 ) does not come as a surprise , since it is the universal form@xcite of a 3-point correlation function for field theories obeying global conformal invariance .",
    "indeed it corresponds to a correlation function @xmath114 where @xmath115 @xmath116 @xmath117 are so - called `` quasi - primary '' fields@xcite of conformal dimensions @xmath118 respectively .",
    "it is interesting to note that such fields already appear in the field - theoretical interpretation of the bfkl equation and its relation to conformal invariance properties@xcite , where correlation functions @xmath119 are introduced , with @xmath120 being a scalar ( i.e. of conformal dimension 0 ) field representing external ( reggeized ) gluons . in this sense",
    "our result ( 17 ) can be considered as a qcd dipole model realization of the triple hard - pomeron vertex .",
    "it is a stimulating ( but non - trivial ) challenge to confront the solution we obtain ( in particular eqns.(15 - 20 ) ) with the known results@xcite on the @xmath121 gluon vertex in the bfkl approach .",
    "this would allow to go deeper in the equivalence of bfkl to the qcd dipole approach .",
    "the result obtained in eqn.(20 ) for @xmath122 is a consequence of the global conformal invariance of the bfkl equation .",
    "indeed , the @xmath106 function is conformally invariant by construction ( provided the constraints ( 19 ) are satisfied ) and the overall vertex @xmath104 of formula ( 17 ) should reflect the general structure@xcite @xmath123 where @xmath124 @xmath125 has to be coordinate - independent while its dependence on the conformal dimensions is not specified by the global @xmath126 symmetry .",
    "this result could be expected for any conformally invariant kernel . by contrast , the specific bfkl kernel @xmath127 of formula ( 9 ) allows the determination of @xmath128 and its relation to the shapiro - virasoro amplitude @xmath106 .",
    "let us generalize the vertex calculation to the @xmath129-dipole amplitude by considering first the exemple of @xmath130 see fig.2 . in much the same way as for @xmath131 one writes : @xmath132 @xmath133 where we have used the fact that the probability of finding three dipoles at @xmath12 can be expressed by two equivalent iterations of the bfkl kernel , namely : @xmath134 hence , the intermediate step ( the @xmath135 segment or , equivalently , the @xmath136 segment in the case of fig.2 ) is not relevant in the final integration kernel . from the symmetry of ( 24 ) , it is easy to realize that this iteration procedure will give a symmetric kernel for any number @xmath41 of produced dipoles .",
    "the integral over the four eigenfunctions appearing in the last term of expression ( 23 ) gives the @xmath137 dipole vertex and can be cast in the following form ( for zero conformal weights ) : @xmath138}\\times \\ c_{8}\\left ( \\frac{\\rho _ { \\alpha \\beta _ { } } \\rho _ { \\gamma \\delta _ { } } } { \\rho _ { \\alpha \\gamma } \\rho _ { \\beta \\gamma } } , \\frac{\\rho _ { \\alpha \\beta } \\rho _ { \\gamma \\delta } } { \\rho _ { \\alpha \\delta } \\rho _ { \\beta \\gamma } } \\right ) ,   \\tag{25}\\ ] ] where the first factor is determined@xcite by conformal invariance constraints on 4-point correlation functions for quasi - primary fields of conformal dimension @xmath139",
    "it is a matter of tedious but straightforward verification that the vertex term in equation ( 23 ) can be cast into the generic form ( 25 ) with : @xmath140 indeed the functional dependence ( 25 ) is obtained from the constrained relations @xmath141 see ( 19 ) .",
    "the corresponding values of @xmath111 are displayed in table ii .",
    "as well - known@xcite global conformal invariance of 4-point correlation functions does not determine the residual function @xmath142 as an arbitrary function of the @xmath126-invariant harmonic ratios of the 8 coordinates involved in the problem , see fig.2 .",
    "however the explicit integrand ( 24 ) induced by the bfkl kernels leads to a well - defined connection with the ( koba - nielsen form of ) the shapiro - virasoro @xmath143 function .",
    "indeed , one may write : @xmath144",
    "^{-1}\\prod_{i < j}\\rho _ { ij}^{-2p_{ij } } ,   \\tag{26}\\ ] ] where the factor @xmath145 ^{-1}$ ] conventionnally means that 4 integration variables out of @xmath146 have to be omitted . formula ( 26 ) can be identified by comparison with the koba - nielsen formulation of @xmath147 namely : @xmath148",
    "^{-1}\\prod\\limits_{i < j}\\rho _ { ij}^{-2p_{ij}}\\ \\equiv \\int d\\rho",
    "_ { \\delta } \\left|   \\frac{\\rho _ { \\beta \\delta } } { \\rho _ { \\gamma \\delta } \\rho _ { \\delta \\alpha } } \\right| ^{2 } \\   c_{8 } ,   \\tag{27}\\ ] ] where the three coordinates in the @xmath126 volume factor have been choosen in order to match with the variables of @xmath149 it is clear from formulae ( 26,27 ) , that @xmath150 is the @xmath151-invariant integrand of the shapiro ",
    "vivasoro amplitude @xmath152    by simple iteration in the number of produced dipoles , it is not difficult to find the generalization of formulae ( 23)-(27 ) to the @xmath153 dipole distribution .",
    "the key observation to determine the powers @xmath111 appearing in ( 26 ) which are known combinations of conformal dimensions @xmath154 obeying the constraints ( 19 )  is to notice that the coordinates in transverse plane are nearest neighbours along the polygonal perimeter @xmath155 ( see fig.2 for the case @xmath156 ) .",
    "the auxiliary points @xmath157 are also connected via nearest neighbours to the previously mentioned perimeter , except for their conformal - dimension factors @xmath158 which are fixed by the constraints .",
    "indeed , we note that the 4 legs connected to a given coordinate @xmath159 in the polygonal perimeter are such that the corresponding sum @xmath160 is always zero . the powers attached to the auxiliary points",
    "are fully determined by @xmath126 invariance ( for the set of constraints ( 19 ) ) .",
    "the shapiro - virasoro amplitudes which are obtained for @xmath153 dipole distributions lead naturally to the question of a closed - string interpretation of the high - energy limit of perturbative qcd .",
    "indeed , these amplitudes appear in the context of a closed string moving in a minkowskian @xmath161 target space@xcite .",
    "more generally , such amplitudes appear as a consequence of vertex operator constructions in conformal field theories@xcite and are related to the existence of an ( anomalous ) infinite - dimensional algebra associated with local conformal invariance , namely the virasoro algebra .",
    "moreover in the case of a critical target - space dimension @xmath162 the fock space on which the quantum string theory is realized is spanned by positive normed states ( no ghosts ) with full reparametrization invariance .",
    "this connection has both a practical and conceptual interest for qcd calculations .",
    "first , the many and much explored mathematical properties of dual amplitudes may lead to a simplification of qcd dipole computations for given processes , e.g. `` hard '' diffraction , multi - pomeron contributions , etc .. second , there is a possibility of building an effective theory of qcd in the high - enrgy limit , which could be based on a string theory ( instead of a field theory ) .",
    "this would allow the computation of string loop contributions and thus induce an effective theory of interacting qcd pomerons .",
    "however , the variables which appear as conformal exponents @xmath111 of the integrands are not directly expressed as scalar products of momenta in a minkowskian @xmath161 target space .",
    "they are complex numbers , see , e.g. ( 26 ) obeying constraints which are not directly expressed as on - mass shell and momentum conservation constraints as for the closed string@xcite .",
    "even if such a target - space interpretation is possible , an analytic continuation in the imaginary direction ( implied by the quantum numbers of the conformal eigenvectors ( 4 ) ) is to be performed .",
    "it is thus useful to pass in review the properties of shapiro - virasoro amplitudes in this context and to see which are those to be completed for a full closed string theory to be valid .      a first consequence of the solutions ( 17 ) , ( 25 ) , and their iterations , is that duality properties exist in the dipole formulation of qcd vertices .",
    "indeed , by construction , shapiro - virasoro amplitudes are meromorphic but forbid the existence of multiple pole singularities coming from dual channels .",
    "for instance , in fig.2 , the @xmath163 and @xmath164 channels can not both together bring singularities to the amplitude . as usual in dual theories",
    ", there exists intricate relations between different ways of describing the amplitudes depending on the series of pole contrbutions which are choosen for their expansion .",
    "an interesting example of such a duality property has been provided by the equivalence of the `` t - channel '' bfkl elastic 4-gluon amplitude with the `` s - channel '' qcd dipole description of the same amplitude@xcite .",
    "further application of this fruitful concept are expected from our results .      as a practical consequence of our identification of the multiple - dipole vertices with integrands of standard shapiro - virasoro amplitudes in the case of zero conformal spins",
    ", one may use some tools which are developed in the string theoretical formalism to generalize our investigations to the case of general ( integer or half - integer ) conformal spins as follows ; one can consider in general amplitudes of the form : @xmath165 ^{-1}\\prod\\limits_{i < j}^n \\ \\rho _ { ij}^{-p_{ij } + \\frac { n_{ij}}2 } \\bar { \\rho } _ { ij}^{-p_{ij } + \\frac { { \\tilde n}_{ij}}2 } ,   \\tag{28}\\ ] ] where @xmath166 are integers .",
    "interestingly enough , in the framework of string theory , this corresponds to consider external excited states of the bosonic string@xcite .",
    "moreover , the same techniques allow to connect closed string to open string tree amplitudes which may allow to extend to the multiple - vertex calculations the conformal - block structure initially identified in the bfkl 4-point amplitudes@xcite .      in the seminal paper of ref.@xcite",
    ", it has been noticed that it was not straightforward to extend the ( already beautiful ) global conformal symmetry @xmath39 to the infinitely dimensional conformal group in 2 dimensions . in other words , only the 6 generators @xmath167 @xmath168 @xmath169 ( 3 holomorphic and 3 non - holomorphic ) of the virasoro algebra were expected to generate the symmetry algebra of the bfkl kernel .",
    "the results we obtain indicate that the algebra can probably be extended to the infinite series of locally conformal generators , i.e. the whole virasoro algebra , at least in the qcd dipole representation . as usual , the symmetry is expected to be anomalous due to the possibility of a central charge@xcite ( conformal anomaly ) at the quantum level of consistency .",
    "this issue will depend on the interpretation of a suitable @xmath170independent target - space representation of the exponents @xmath171 see , for @xmath172 , table i and ii ) .",
    "for instance , if an embedding @xmath173 in a minkowskian @xmath161 space is allowed , this will determine the central charge to be related to @xmath174 and the critical dimension to be @xmath175 by compensation of the ghost contribution due to reparametrization symmetry@xcite .",
    "this interesting issue deserves certainly more study .",
    "we want to thank andrzej bialas and henri navelet for a fruitful collaboration on the qcd theory of dipoles which initiated the present work helping the author to find the way out in two noticeable occasions .",
