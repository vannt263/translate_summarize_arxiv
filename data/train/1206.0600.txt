    "let us briefly comment on this : a moment s thought shows that , by far , many natural domains fail to be lipschitzian .",

    "our approach to ( [ e - parabol])([e - initial ] ) , which also covers the case that @xmath11 or @xmath10 is empty , is essentially based on the theory of sesquilinear forms and the suitable incorporation of the boundary conditions into an @xmath0-space .",

    "@xmath35 is the @xmath24-dimensional hausdorff measure .",
    "these properties of the trace are a consequence of the regularity of @xmath11 and @xmath10 .",

    "hence the dynamic equations on @xmath11 and @xmath10 are modelled by the part @xmath71 of the base space @xmath39 .",
    "the subsequent analysis will show that , in either the elliptic or in the parabolic setting , these three components may be prescribed , and the equation indeed has a solution in the functional analytic setting which we will establish .",
    "moreover , the solution depends continuously on the data .",
    "the operator @xmath72 generates a holomorphic , submarkovian @xmath73-semigroup of contractions on @xmath39 , and may thus be extended to a semigroup of contractions on @xmath74 for all @xmath75 $ ] . denoting the corresponding generators by @xmath76",
    ", it turns out that for all @xmath77 the operator @xmath78 generates a holomorphic @xmath73-semigroup of contractions on a suitably renormed @xmath79-space .",
    "this has two important consequences .",
    "first , applying an abstract result that is presented e.g.  in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 2.2 ) , we obtain a bounded holomorphic functional calculus for @xmath80 with angle strictly smaller than @xmath81 , and in particular the boundedness of the purely imaginary powers ( see theorem [ t - imagin ] ) .",
    "moreover , the pioneering theorem of lamberton @xcite gives us maximal parabolic regularity for @xmath82 in theorem [ t - qreg ] , which we consider as the main result of this work .",
    "the introduction of temporal weights as in @xcite further allows to reduce the regularity of the initial data almost up to the base space @xmath74 .",
    "this yields the solution of ( [ e - parabol])([e - initial ] ) in an adequate manner , see theorem  [ t - solution ] .",
    "based on these linear results we treat a nondegenerate quasilinear variant of ( [ e - parabol])([e - initial ] ) , even if the right hand side explicitly and discontinuously depends on time ( theorem [ t - semilinear ] ) . here",
    "a difficulty is that the domain of the realization of the operator @xmath83 on @xmath74 is not independent of the coefficients @xmath13 .",
    "we therefore consider a problem which is obtained when applying the kirchhoff transform to the original one , and which involves only one fixed operator ( see definition [ quasi - solution ] ) . maximal parabolic regularity then allows to apply a result of prss @xcite ( see also @xcite ) to the transformed problem , giving local existence and uniqueness of solutions in a suitable sense . throughout it",
    "is essential that @xmath84 for large @xmath85 and @xmath86 sufficiently close to @xmath87 , which is a consequence of ultracontractivity estimates for the semigroup ( see lemma [ llpr206 ] and proposition [ plpr301 ] ) .",
    "the quasilinear problems may be of relevance for the applications : the heat source on the hypersurface can depend on the solution itself , and , additionally , explicitly on time .",
    "let us briefly compare the approach in this paper with those in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for static robin boundary conditions .",
    "there the banach space under consideration is a negatively indexed sobolev space of type @xmath88 or a sobolev  morrey space .",
    "in contrast to that settings , in @xmath74 one may form the dual pairing of the above parabolic equation with the indicator function @xmath89 of suitable subsets @xmath90 . then",
    "one may , additionally , apply gauss theorem to @xmath91 .",
    "this allows to recover the underlying physical balance law for the parabolic equation , which is the starting point for the numerical treatment of such problems . for more details we refer to remark [ rem - heuristics-2 ] .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec-2 ]",
    "we introduce the spaces @xmath74 , define an appropriate realization of @xmath92 and show that it admits a bounded holomorphic functional calculus . in section [ s - parabolic ] we show that in this setting ( [ e - parabol])([e - initial ] ) enjoys maximal parabolic regularity , and in section [ s - semilinear ] we treat the quasilinear case .",
