    "understanding the dynamics of open quantum systems @xcite requires methods to model their temporal dynamics .",
    "generally the evolution of an open quantum system is described by the master equation which determines the evolution of the system s density matrix @xmath0 . solving the master equation for the full density matrix is in many situations cumbersome .",
    "this is also the case for closed systems where the evolution can be described by wave functions . since in general an open system",
    "involves both unitary and dissipative dynamics , the complexity of its evolution is , however , substantially higher than for the corresponding closed system , as the number of entries in the density matrix is the square of the number of entries in the wave function . to make the description of an open quantum system manageable as well as to gain physical insight into the evolution of the system it is therefore desirable to develop effective theories which reduce the complexity of the system .    in an open system",
    "there are often quite different time scales associated with different effects , such that the hilbert space can be divided into two parts , one for the rapidly decaying ( excited ) states , and one for the comparably stable ( ground ) states .",
    "for instance , for weakly driven atoms the evolution and decay of the excited states happen on a time scale which is fast compared to any other time scale in the system . in such situations",
    "it is desirable to eliminate the rapidly evolving excited states to get a simpler description of the slow evolution of the ground states .",
    "a standard method for doing this is adiabatic elimination @xcite , where the density matrix equations involving the excited states are solved by assuming a slow evolution of the ground states .",
    "this can then be used to describe an effective evolution of the ground states .",
    "this procedure can , however , be rather involved , as there are many density matrix elements if the system is large .",
    "in this paper we present a simple method to eliminate the excited states and to reduce the system dynamics to the ground states .",
    "the method we present is essentially equivalent to adiabatic elimination but is much easier to apply in practice . by formalizing the procedures leading to adiabatic elimination we obtain simple expressions for the effective operators describing the ground - state evolution . with our expressions",
    "one avoids the often tedious steps leading to adiabatic elimination and can obtain the effective operators by evaluating simple formulas . in particular , we have found that these methods are very convenient for studying dissipative state preparation @xcite , where the goal is to engineer decay processes such that a system evolves into a desired state . to this end",
    "it is highly desirable to have a convenient tool to rapidly identify the effective dissipative dynamics of the system .    for closed systems with purely unitary couplings",
    "similar simplifications have been used to derive effective hamiltonians , in particular by james and co - workers @xcite .",
    "if decoherence is added to the system , the joint unitary and dissipative dynamics can be captured by introducing non - hermitian descriptions .",
    "the use of complex energies allows for the combination of the energy of a resonance with its width @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , non - hermitian hamiltonians are commonly used to describe the dynamics of open systems @xcite . in quantum optics",
    "the use of non - hermitian hamiltonians is put in a more rigorous form by the so - called quantum jump formalism , or monte carlo wave function method @xcite , which is equivalent to the evolution by a markovian master equation . in this method",
    "the non - hermitian hamiltonian describes the evolution in the absence of decay , whereas quantum jumps are introduced at random times to account for the resulting state after a decay .",
    "the separation of the hilbert space into rapidly and slowly evolving ground and excited states , similar to what we consider here , has been studied also for non - hermitian hamiltonians .",
    "in particular , for a coupling of the ground to the excited states much weaker than the evolution inside the subspaces , a formalism for effective processes is provided by the feshbach projection - operator approach @xcite .",
    "similar formalisms for successive nuclear reactions have been studied by weidenmller and co - workers @xcite .",
    "methods based on the feshbach projection operator method have been used in several fields @xcite . however , these treatments are only concerned with the evolution from the effective non - hermitian hamiltonian and therefore ignore the quantum jumps describing the state after the decay .",
