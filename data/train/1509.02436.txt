    "for instance , there are nowadays many methods to calculate the hawking radiation .",
    "nevertheless , all results show that the black hole radiation is very close to the black body spectrum .",
    "this conclusion raised a very difficult question whether the information is conserved in the black hole evaporation process ?",
    "the black hole information paradox has been a puzzled problem .",
    "the study of the thermodynamic properties of black holes in space - times is therefore a very relevant and original task .",
    "for instance , based on recent observation of supernova , the cosmological constant may be positive .",
    "the possible corrections can be calculated by means of approaches to the quantum gravity . through the comparison of the corrected results obtained from this alternative approaches",
    ", it can be shown that a suitable choice of the expansion coefficients in the modified dispersion relations leads to the same results in the gup approach .",
    "the existence of minimal length and maximum momentum accuracy is preferred by various physical observations .",
    "thought experiments have been designed to illustrate influence of the gup approaches on the fundamental laws of physics , especially at the planck scale .",
    "the concern about the compatibility with the equivalence principles , the universality of gravitational redshift and the free fall and reciprocal action law should be addressed .",
    "the value of the gup parameters remains a puzzle to be verified .",
    "furthermore , confronting gup approaches to further applications would elaborate essential properties .",
    "the ultimate goal would be an empirical evidence that the same is indeed quantized and its fundamental is given by the minimal length accuracy .",
    "if the current technologies would not able to implement this proposal , we are left with the empirical prove that the modifications of various physical systems can be estimated , accurately . to this destination",
    ", we should try to verify the given approaches , themselves .",
    "we believe that the compatibility with mdr would play the role of the rosetta stone translating gup in energy - momentum relations .",
    "the latter would have cosmological and astrophysical observations .",
    "this work is partly supported by the world laboratory for cosmology and particle physics ( wlcapp ) , http://wlcapp.net/. the authors are very grateful to the anonymous referee for her / his constructive comments and constructive comments , which contribute a lot to improving the script !",
