    "the brownian bridge is a universally known model which is widely used in several areas of applied mathematical science . as only an example , the recent publication of @xcite and the reference therein provide a huge interested literature , while @xcite provide a theoretical analysis of such a process .",
    "the main aspect of the brownian bridge is its periodicity , that makes this model widely used . on the other hand ,",
    "a lack of this model is its non - stationarity , which is almost a must when one models pure noise .",
    "this is due to the fact that brownian bridge is assumed to be @xmath0 at @xmath1 .",
    "one question arises : is the brownian bridge a stationary and periodic process conditioned to be @xmath0 when @xmath2 is @xmath0 ?",
    "the recent interest in random noise models can be seen in the modeling of planar objects without landmarks ( see e.g.@xcite and the references therein ) . in @xcite is proposed a parametric random fourier series model ( called generalized @xmath3-order model ) to describe the border of random planar star - shaped objects in terms of normalized radius - vector function ; again , in @xcite are also provided results about sample path regularity , and an expression for the maximum likelihood function for the model parameters , even if there are not asymptotic results about these estimators .",
    "we focus here on @xmath4 , the set of gaussian , stationary , periodic processes , which can be thought as the space of the ` noises ' on a periodic data , e.g.  the noise on a contour of a closed feature of an image , or , more generally , the noise on a stationary , periodic , functional data process .",
    "we recall in the next section that @xmath4 is isometrically equivalent to @xmath5 as a consequence of karhunen - love s theorem .",
    "notably , the isometry is build via fourier transform .",
    "in particular , fft is used in application , which makes the set @xmath4 computationally feasible .    a `` good '' noise model is then generated by a process in @xmath4 conditioned to be @xmath0 when @xmath1 .",
    "we call the class of this process @xmath6 , and we study the correlation function that defines the process in @xmath6 .",
    "surprisingly , the brownian bridge can not be generated in this way .",
    "indeed , it is generated by gaussian , stationary , _ anti - periodic _ processes conditioned to be @xmath0 when @xmath1 ( and hence periodic ! ) , as shown in section  [ sec:3s ] .    in section  [ sec:4s ]",
    "we show that any process in @xmath4 shares asymptotically the spectrum with the corresponding process in @xmath6 . in section  [ sec:5s ]",

    "the number @xmath7 of discrete approximation is linked to the maximum number of available measures , and it defines the `` observation window '' . the particular choice of @xmath7 may be used to discriminate between different behavior , even when they will be the same asymptotically outside the observation window ( see , e.g. , the difference between fractal dimension and topologic dimension of liver fibrosis morphological quantities in @xcite ) . in other words ,",
