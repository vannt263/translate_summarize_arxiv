    "unfortunately , we have not succeeded in finding of the general solution to the equation ( [ y ] ) .",
    "therefore , in what follows we consider some special cases of the exponential magnetic field .    in the preferable coordinate system ( [ uv ] )",

    "one has also to note that , on the other hand , for some choice of the parameters of the superpotential ( [ wd1 ] ) , the well - known exactly solvable system with the morse potential can be reproduced @xcite .",

    "the term `` landau levels '' is justified here by the analogy with the case of the constant magnetic field in which the hamiltonian eigenstates are bounded only in one of two directions corresponding to the continuous variables .",
    "the reduced magnetic field with @xmath145 ( @xmath146 ) can be considered exactly in the same way . in this case",

    ". however , the detailed consideration of such a problem lies out of the scope of the present paper .",
    "let us turn now to the case of the polynomial magnetic field .",

    "the essential feature of this integral is its linearity in derivatives .    the polynomial magnetic field ( [ bp ] ) is invariant under rotations about the point @xmath151 .",
    "therefore , one can expect that the operator ( [ jp ] ) should be related to a generator of the axial symmetry . to use the benefit of this symmetry , we pass over to the polar coordinate system with the center at the point @xmath151 .",
    "then the magnetic field is radial , @xmath152 and the hamiltonian reads as @xmath153 here @xmath154 , @xmath155 , the magnetic field is given by @xmath156 and the supercharges have the simple structure ( cf . with eq .",
    "( [ qbc ] ) ) : @xmath157 as in the case @xmath112 , the anticommutator of the supercharges ( [ qpol ] ) is a polynomial of the @xmath0-th degree in @xmath54 , @xmath158 , where @xmath159 denotes a polynomial of the @xmath160-th degree . for example , for @xmath116 we have @xmath161 these expressions can be obtained from ( [ ao ] ) via the limiting procedure discussed above .    for the radial magnetic field it is convenient to use the asymmetric gauge @xmath162 one could add an additive constant to @xmath163 since this does not affect the magnetic field ( [ ba ] ) .",
    "but such a constant would lead to a singular gauge potential in the cartesian coordinates owing to the singular at the coordinate origin nature of the polar system . by the same reason the constant can not be removed by a gauge transformation .",
    "therefore it has to vanish .    in the gauge ( [ ap ] ) , the hamiltonian ( [ hpol ] ) is simplified : @xmath164 the angle variable @xmath165 is cyclic and the eigenfunctions of ( [ h1 ] ) can be represented as @xmath166e^{im\\varphi}\\psi_m(r )   \\end{pmatrix},\\qquad   m,\\ m'\\in\\mathbb n.\\ ] ] in the gauge ( [ ap ] ) the integral @xmath53 takes the form @xmath167 up to a constant , this integral is equal to ( [ bcj ] ) .",
    "moreover , the system with the constant magnetic field is recovered in the limit @xmath168 . in this case",
    "@xmath169 that means that @xmath53 disappears from ( [ ap ] ) recovering the corresponding superalgebra for the system with the constant field .",

    "the kinetic term of the hamiltonian ( [ h1 ] ) is hermitian with respect to the scalar product with the measure @xmath172 . in order to obtain a one - dimensional system with the usual scalar product defined by the measure @xmath173 , one has to perform the similarity transformation @xmath174",

    "the `` integrability condition '' ( [ int ] ) arises at the quantum level and guarantees the conservation of the supercharges in a pure algebraic way .",
    "thus , the formulation of the nonlinear holomorphic supersymmetry does not depend on representation of the operators @xmath105 and @xmath106 . in this sense",
    "the holomorphic @xmath0-supersymmetry can be treated as a direct algebraic extension of the usual linear supersymmetry .",

    "the action of quantum mechanical operators is associative that , in principle , is enough for realizing the holomorphic @xmath0-supersymmetry ( [ halg])-([qalge ] ) .    at present time",
