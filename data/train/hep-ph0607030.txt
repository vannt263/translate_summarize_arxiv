    "several models of neutrino mass have been suggested in the literature in which the neutrinos acquire masses through a seesaw @xcite type mass texture , but the majorana masses of the right - handed neutrinos are at the tev scale instead of the gut scale of @xmath2  gev @xcite .",
    "the smallness of the neutrino masses in those models is achieved either by the reduction of the rank of the mass matrix through a judicious choice of mass texture @xcite , or by the suppression of the dirac masses through an extended higgs sector @xcite .    in such models , the heavy",
    ", mostly - right - handed mass eigenstates typically have masses of a few tev , placing them within reach of the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) or future @xmath3 linear colliders .",
    "if created , the particles will decay into a light neutrino+higgs through the yukawa interaction responsible for the dirac masses , or into a light neutrino+@xmath4 or a charged lepton+@xmath5 through the small admixture of the left - handed neutrino state .",
    "this last decay mode is particularly interesting since the decay products can be all visible .",
    "of course , whether such a decay , and thus the particle , can be observed at colliders or not depends on whether the lifetime of the particle is short enough for it to decay inside the detector , and if that is the case , whether the width is small enough so that a narrow peak is discernible in the invariant mass of its decay products .    in this paper",
    ", we calculate the lifetimes of the heavy , mostly - right - handed states of the model proposed by okamura et al . in ref .",

    ", we can set the phase of @xmath11 to zero .",
    "this can always be achieved by changing the overall phase of @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and does not affect any physical result .",

    "furthermore , we need not consider both orientations since the two cases can be transformed into each other by a simple interchange of the lengths of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and a relabeling of the singlet neutrino fields . as discussed previously , this does not affect any physical result either .",
    "therefore , we will always take the triangle to be in the @xmath36 orientation .",
    "this choice also reduces the redundancy of the parameter space from @xmath21 to 3 since we have used up the freedom to interchange @xmath12 and @xmath13 to fix the orientation .",

( [ normalization ] ) , and also the triangle inequalities : @xmath41 so they form a closed triangle ? to this end , we utilize the fact that the sum of distances from any point inside a triangle to its three sides is constant : any point inside an equilateral triangle of height three will have distances to the three sides which add up to three . if we identify these distances with @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 , we can use the position of the point to specify the three lengths . requiring the square - roots of these distances to satisfy the triangle inequality",
