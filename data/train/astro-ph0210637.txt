    "for each system , five keplerian parameters are measured : orbital period , @xmath2 ; eccentricity , @xmath3 ; angle of periastron , @xmath4 ; time of periastron passage , @xmath5 ; and projected semi - major axis , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the semi - major axis of the pulsar orbit , @xmath8 is the orbital inclination angle , and @xmath9 is the speed of light .",
