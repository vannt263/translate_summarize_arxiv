    "the main physics goal of heavy ion collisions at the bnl relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) is the study of the extremely hot and dense matter , the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , formed in the early stage of the collisions .",
    "hydrodynamics may provide a direct link between the early state of the matter and final observables and has been extensively used in high energy heavy ion collisions .",
    "the hydrodynamic calculations with the equation of state of the qgp agree well with the rhic @xmath0 data of the elliptic flow at low transverse momentum @xmath1 gev @xcite , which is believed as an important evidence of the existence of a strongly coupled qgp in the early stages of the collisions @xcite .",
    "however , hydrodynamic results can not explain the rhic hanbury - brown - twiss ( hbt ) measurements , @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "it is the so - called hbt puzzle .    in ref .",
    "@xcite a granular source model of qgp droplets evolving hydrodynamically was put forth to explain the hbt puzzle .",
    "the suggestion was based on the observation that in the hydrodynamic calculations for the granular source the average particle emission time scales with the initial radius of the droplet , whereas the spacial size of the source is the scale of the distribution of the droplets . for a granular source with many of the small droplets distributed in a relatively large region ,",
    "the hbt radius @xmath3 can be close to @xmath4 @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors further investigated the elliptic flow and hbt radii as a function of the particle transverse momentum for an improved granular source model of qgp droplets .",
    "they argued that although a granular structure was suggested earlier as the signature of a first - order phase transition @xcite , the occurrence of granular structure may not be limited to first - order phase transition @xcite . in an event - by - event basis ,",
    "the initial transverse distribution of energy density in nucleus - nucleus collisions have been known to be highly fluctuating @xcite .",
    "this large spatial fluctuation may facilitate the occurrence of instability of the system during it violent expansion subsequently and the fragmentation to many granular droplets together with surface tension effect @xcite .",
    "so , the examination of the space - time structure in event - by - event basis is important to understand the system evolution and the hbt puzzle",
    ".    smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) is a suitable candidate that can be used to treat the system evolution with large fluctuating initial conditions for investigating event - by - event attributes in high energy heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "the main idea of sph is the parametrization of the fluid in terms of discrete lagrangian coordinates attached to small volumes ( call ` particles ' ) with some conserved quantities in hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "nexspherio is a sph code @xcite with event - by - event initial conditions generated by nexus event simulator @xcite .",
    "it has been used to study a wide range of problems in high energy heavy ion collisions @xcite . in this article",
    "we use nexspherio to simulate the evolution of the system produced in the collisions of @xmath5 gev au+au at rhic .",
    "we will examine the space - time structure of the systems and investigate the two - pion hbt correlation functions in event - by - event basis .",
    "our results show that the systems are inhomogeneous in space and time both for a first - order and a cross - over transitions between the qgp and hadronic phase .",
    "there are  lumps \" in different regions of the system .",
    "the two - pion hbt correlation functions in event - by - event basis exhibit large fluctuations , which lead to a wide distribution of the error - inverse - weighted fluctuations between the hbt correlation functions of single and mixed events .",
    "these large fluctuations and wide distributions are important features for the sources with event - by - event fluctuating initial conditions .",
    "the root - mean - square of the weighted fluctuations is a signal to detect the inhomogeneity of the systems produced in high energy heavy ion collisions .",
    "in hydrodynamics the behavior of system evolution is determined by the initial conditions and the equation of state ( eos ) of the system . the system initial states of nexspherio are given by the nexus code , which can provide detailed space distributions of energy - momentum tensor , baryon - number , strangeness , and charge densities at a given initial time ( which is taken to be @xmath6 fm in our calculations ) , in event - by - event basis @xcite . in our calculations",
    "we use two kinds of eos .",
    "the first one , eos - i , considers a first - order phase transition at @xmath7 mev between a qgp and a hadronic resonance gas as used in refs .",
    "the qgp is an ideal gas of massless quarks ( u , d , s ) and gluons and the hadronic gas contains the resonances with mass below 2.5 gev / c@xmath8 , where volume correction is taken into account @xcite . because at rhic energy the net baryon constituent is very small and the phase transition is a smooth cross over , in the mid - rapidity region of the heavy ion collisions , a modification for the eos with first - order phase transition in the hydrodynamical code should be considered @xcite .",
    "accordingly , we introduce eos - ii which is obtained by smoothing the eos - i in the transition region with the entropy density suggested by qcd lattice results @xcite .",
    "1 shows the relations of the thermodynamical quantities for the systems evolving with the eos - i ( grey ) and the eos - ii ( black ) , where @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are entropy density , energy density , and pressure of the system .",
