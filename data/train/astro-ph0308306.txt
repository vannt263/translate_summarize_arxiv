    "a snapshot survey of optical counterparts to 3cr radio sources with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) has detected unresolved ( @xmath0 ) optical nuclear components to these luminous radio sources in a large number of objects , particularly at low redshift @xcite .",
    "a correlation between radio core emission at 5ghz and optical core flux was discovered by @xcite , and between the x - ray emission and core radio emission @xcite implying that the x - ray and optical emission are relativistically beamed and so probably originate in the radio jet . as pointed out by these studies , these correlations would be consistent with the unifying model that has identified populations of fr  i radio sources as bl  lac type objects seen at different viewing angles @xcite",
    ".    multiwavelength studies of radio galaxy cores represent a detailed way to test the unification model as their spectral energy distributions ( seds ) can be directly compared to bl  lac type objects .",
    "previous work has focused on three flux points ( x - ray , radio and optical ) and found that they are not consistent with a single power law @xcite , and could be consistent with the sed of a bl  lac type object , but seen at less inclined angles with respect to the line of sight @xcite . by carrying out observations of the nuclei in the submillimeter we extend the coverage of the sed to contain a point intermediate between the optical and longer wavelength radio emission . with these additional data",
    "we aim to test the hypothesis that the underlying seds are similar to bl  lac type objects , estimate the total bolometric output of these nuclei and search for constraints on the shape of the seds .",
    "the seds of bl  lac type objects and blazars typically have two energy peaks , a lower one from synchrotron radiation and a higher one interpreted to be caused by inverse compton scattering ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the previous classification into `` low - energy '' peaked objects ( synchrotron peak residing in the infrared ; denoted lbl ) and `` high - energy '' peaked objects ( synchrotron residing in the uv / x - rays ; denoted hbl ) @xcite , has been superseded by a unified continuum where objects exhibit a range of synchrotron peak wavelengths @xcite .",
    "this calls into question the identification of fr  i radio galaxies with lbl bl  lac type objects .",
    "some authors have proposed more complex unification scenarios in which the parent populations of bl  lac type objects include a mix of fr  i and fr  iis @xcite .",
    "indeed , the extended radio morphologies of bl  lac objects can be of both fr  i and ii types ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus is more appropriate to unify bl  lac objects more generally with radio galaxies @xcite . by studying the nuclear spectral energy distributions of nearby radio galaxies",
    ", we aim to find which type of bl  lac type object they would resemble if they were oriented with their jets oriented toward us .    in  2 of this paper we present continuum observations at 870@xmath1 m of the cores of 34 low redshift radio galaxies . in  3",
    ", we explore the luminosity ratios between our data points and those based on core fluxes measured at 5ghz , optical and x - ray wavelengths compiled by previous studies . in ",
    "3 we also compile as detailed seds of as many objects as possible to see if the seds do indeed resemble those of bl  lac type objects and if so which type .",
    "a discussion follows in  4 .",
    "the 3crr sample @xcite is a flux limited sample of the northern sky .",
    "it includes all objects with 178mhz flux density greater than 10.9jy having @xmath2 and @xmath3 but excludes the starburst galaxy , m82 . in this paper",
    "we restrict our study to the low redshift component , @xmath4 , of this sample .",
    "many of the galaxies in this subsample have been observed at high angular resolution ( @xmath5 ) at visible wavelengths with the wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) on the hubble space telescope @xcite and subsequently in the ultraviolet with the stis nuv mama detector @xcite .",
    "we used the heinrich hertz submillimeter telescope ( hht ) @xcite located on mt .",
    "graham , arizona .",
    "observations were carried out 2001 feb 10 - 12 , with the 19-channel bolometer array which was developed by e.  kreysa and collaborators at the max - planck - institut fr radioastronomie ( mpifr ) , bonn @xcite .",
    "the 19 channels are located in the center and on the sides of two concentric regular hexagons , with an apparent spacing between two adjacent channels ( beams ) of @xmath6 . the central frequency of the bolometer is about 345ghz ( the highest sensitivity is reached at 340ghz ) , and the instrument is sensitive mainly between 310 and 380ghz .    to calculate the atmospheric zenith opacity , we made skydip observations every 40 to 80 minutes . during the observations",
    "the sky opacity at 345ghz was around 0.4 most of the time , increasing to 0.9 for a few scans . during the observations ,",
    "the subreflector was wobbled at 2hz in azimuth , with a beam throw of @xmath7 .",
    "our observation mode consisted of 20 continuum on - off scans , 10 seconds each . except for the brightest sources , we observed each radio galaxy 6 times in the above mode resulting in a total typical on - source exposure time of 1200 seconds and an actual observing time approximately 3 times this . for calibration purposes",
    "every few hours we also performed mapping and on - off measurements of planets ( venus , mars ) .",
    "these measurements yielded a conversion factor from observed counts to mjy / beam of 0.8  1.1mjybeam@xmath8count@xmath8 .",
    "the conversion factor is affected by the atmospheric condition during the observations and the uncertainties in the opacity calculation .",
    "the pointing of the telescope was checked every few hours . pointing errors ( a few arcseconds ) remained well within the beam width @xmath9 throughout these observations .",
    "data reduction was performed with a customized version of the software package nic which is part of the gildas software package and is a collaborative project of the centre detudes de saclay , mpifr bonn , the observatoire de grenoble and iram ( institut de radioastronomie millimtrique ) . after baseline subtraction and the elimination of spikes in each single coverage , the atmospheric noise , which is highly correlated between the individual channels ,",
    "was subtracted .",
    "the maps were gridded , restored , and finally combined ( with an appropriate weighting ) into a single map per galaxy .",
    "we expected the radio source to be located in the central channel of the array , and for all sources detected this was indeed the case .",
    "the flux of the central source was measured using an on - off distance of @xmath10 and by subtracting the mean of the sky fluxes from the surrounding channels . for most of the galaxies we had multiple observation sets and",
    "the final flux was measured using the noise weighted sum of the flux of the central source in each map . of the 46 galaxies from the 3crr low redshift galaxies observed by @xcite",
    ", we observed 34 galaxies at the hht .",
    "in addition we include a measurement of the radio galaxy ngc 6251 which has also been observed extensively by hst .",
    "ngc 6251 fits the criterion for being selected in the 3crr galaxy @xcite .",
    "of the 35 galaxies observed we detected 24 and estimated @xmath11 upper limits for the 11 undetected .",
    "the measured fluxes and estimated upper limits are listed in table 1 .",
    "observations of three galaxies ( 3c35 , 3c198 , 3c227 ) were repeated during better observing conditions later in the observing run , but remain undetected .",
    "these are listed twice in table 1 .",
    "for many of these galaxies , nuclear continuum fluxes have been measured in the optical using hst images @xcite , in the x - rays from chandar , rosat and asca data @xcite .",
    "using these measured fluxes and 5ghz core fluxes measured by @xcite , we search for correlations and measure spectral indexes between the radio and submillimeter , optical and x - rays .",
    "plots comparing measured core powers are shown in figure [ fig : power ] .",
    "luminosities have been estimated by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the flux density , @xmath14 the frequency and @xmath15 the distance which we estimate from the redshift using a hubble constant of 75  km  s@xmath8  mpc@xmath8 .",
    "spectral indexes for objects detected at 870@xmath1 m are listed in table 2 along with luminosities estimated from the submillimeter fluxes .",
    "the spectral index , @xmath16 , is defined in the sense that flux density is proportional to @xmath17 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : power]a we see that there is a correlation between the @xmath18 m and 5ghz core luminosities .",
    "this implies that the emission at @xmath18 m is not thermal emission from cold dust but more likely to be synchrotron emission .",
    "contamination from co(3 - 2 ) line emission in the 345ghz band is unlikely .",
    "we find that the typical spectral indexes between the radio ( 5ghz core ) and submillimeter , @xmath19 this suggests that these sources are approximately flat spectrum up to frequencies higher than 345ghz .",
    "there is significantly more power emitted from these sources in the submillimeter than at 5ghz .",
    "the luminosity ratio between the submillimeter and 5ghz is for the mean approximately 50 .",
    "this is similar to what is seen in bl  lac type objects which can have their synchrotron emission sed peaking anywhere between the ir through the x - rays ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    from figures [ fig : power]b ,",
    "c we find that the submillimeter luminosities are similar to those emitted in the optical and x - rays .",
    "however the scatter in the optical / radio and optical / submillimeter plots is higher than that seen in the submillimeter / radio plots .",
    "a large scatter in the optical / submillimeter spectral index , @xmath20 , could be caused by a variety of processes including extinction from dust , an additional source of radiation such as continuum emission from a broad line region , or variations in the position of the emission peaks from an underlying blazar or bl  lac type sed .",
    "bl  lac type objects vary in the wavelength position of their synchrotron peaks , and the location of these peaks also depend on orientation angle or beaming .",
    "if the underlying seds of these sources are similar to blazars or bl  lac type objects we might also expect a large scatter in @xmath20 due to differences in synchrotron peak wavelength and orientation angle .    for most of these sources , the luminosity in the submillimeter and the x - rays are similar .",
    "@xcite noted that since the x - ray fluxes are not higher than the optical fluxes , most of these sources are unlikely to be candidate debeamed hbl type objects .",
    "however extinction could have reduced the observed optical fluxes .",
    "the submillimeter observations have the advantage over the optical ones that they are relatively unaffected by extinction from dust . in figure",
    "[ fig : ratio ] we show the x - ray to submillimeter and optical to submillimeter luminosity ratios for objects detected at all three wavelengths .",
    "most of our sources have similar submillimeter and x - ray luminosities , confirming the result by @xcite that most of these sources are more likely to be similar to lbls rather than hbls .    in the subsample containing both x - ray and submillimeter measurements , we find that only 3 objects have x - ray luminosities significantly higher than submillimeter luminosities , the fr  i galaxy , 3c264 , and the fr  ii galaxies , 3c382 and 3c390.3",
    ". these objects could have seds similar to debeamed hbl type objects .",
    "we concur with @xcite who also found that 3c264 is similar to an hbl . to test this possibility we have plotted on figure [ fig : ratio ] luminosity ratios for debeamed lbl and hbl objects at different orientation angles , based on mkn421 ( dotted line ) as done by @xcite and the means of the populations measured by @xcite based on the x - ray selected einstein slew bl  lac sample ( primarily hbls ) , the wall & peacock flat spectrum radio quasar sample and the 1jy bl  lac sample consisting primarily of lbls . as these bl",
    "lac type objects are debeamed ( oriented closer to perpendicular to the line of sight ) the optical to submillimeter ratio increases so the rightmost end of these lines are the objects oriented nearly perpendicular to the line of sight .",
    "most of 3crr sources lie in the region expected for lbls at a range of orientation angles , excepting the three extreme objects 3c264 , 3c382 and 3c390.3 .",
    "a correction for extinction from dust and photoelectric absorption in the x - rays would increase the underlying optical and x - ray fluxes moving the data points upward and to the right in the plot .",
    "consequently some of the sources with low x - ray to submillimeter luminosity ratios could be similar to objects intermediate to lbls and hbls .",
    "however the three extreme galaxies are unlikely to resemble lbls and so are candidate hbls or intermediate objects .    in some cases we have additional information on the object s orientation .",
    "most but not all of fr  is have disks nearly perpendicular to the line of sight and so are likely to be debeamed compared to bl  lac type objects .",
    "those that contains optical jets or exhibit circular dusty disk ( such as 3c78 and 3c264 ) are unlikely to have jets oriented perpendicular to the line of sight @xcite .",
    "3c264 is probably closer to face on rather than edge - on because it exhibits a nearly round dusty disk , seen in absorption at optical wavelengths @xcite .",
    "3c390.3 exhibits superluminal motion @xcite , and the jets of 3c382 and 3c390.3 are one sided @xcite suggesting that these two objects are also oriented at high inclination angles to the line of sight .",
    "the candidate hbls we have identified are probably not oriented perpendicular to the line of sight . while 3c390.3 falls near the expected location of the x - ray selected hbl sample , 3c382 and 3c264",
    "are more likely to be similar to intermediate type objects , consistent with recently identified bl  lac populations with spectra in between those of lbls and hbls ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is clear from the previous section that the possibility of extinction in the optical bands causes an uncertainty which inhibits our study of the underlying seds . because the seds of bl  lac type objects are smooth , the spectral indexes are only weakly dependent upon the boosting factor ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this presents a possible way to tell the difference between obscuration by dust and beaming .",
    "if the sed is rapidly changing between the optical and uv wavelengths then it is likely that dust is causing significant obscuration resulting an underestimate of underlying synchrotron emission in the optical region .",
    "if dust is indeed a factor causing us to underestimate the extent of the emission in the optical region then some of these source might be much brighter in the near - ir .",
    "unfortunately only a few of these galaxies were observed by nicmos .",
    "@xcite found that the sed of 3c264 between 1 - 2 microns was nearly flat , whereas that of 3c270 decreased remarkably toward shorter wavelengths .",
    "here we compile the seds of the objects which were observed at more than one wavelength to examine the shape of the sed in more detail than presented by @xcite .",
    "we have compiled in table 3 core fluxes in the uv and optical from stis and wfpc2 images , in the near - infrared with nicmos images ( on board hst ) , in the mid - infrared from isocam / iso images and at @xmath21 from ground based images taken by us at the irtf .",
    "we have also included measurements by and compiled by @xcite .    in figures [ fig : fr1 ] , and [ fig : fr2 ] we show the compiled seds for fr  is and fr  iis respectively .",
    "these are an improvement on previous studies such as @xcite which contained fewer data points .",
    "ngc  4261 , and ngc  6251 , have notable nearly edge - on dusty disks seen in hst images , and they both have extremely steep seds between the near - infrared and optical region , as previous studies have noted @xcite .",
    "non - thermal processes such as synchrotron radiation seldom permit extremely sharp drops in a spectral energy distribution .",
    "variability could cause some of the scatter among the points in figures [ fig : fr1 ] , and [ fig : fr2 ] , however it would not systematically account for a steep drop between the near - infrared and uv wavelengths which is seen in many of these objects .",
    "it would be difficult to construct a model from non - thermal emission processes alone in which a number of objects are likely to exhibit such a steep drop exactly in the near - ir / optical region .",
    "however extinction by dust naturally causes a steep drop in this region .",
    "if we assume that the underlying sed is fairly flat in terms of luminosity , then extinction causes a reduction in the optical flux by more than a factor of 10 in ngc  4261 and by a factor of a few in ngc  6251 .",
    "we suspect that extinction from dust is important even though many of these radio galaxies were detected as unresolved sources in optical images .",
    "if extinction by dust does affect the detection of unresolved nuclei in the radio galaxies , we expect that subsequent surveys will detect more nuclear sources in the infrared than previous detected in optical surveys .",
    "the energy absorbed by the dust should be re - emitted in the infrared , so some of the mid - ir emission should be from hot dust . if we corrected the optical fluxes for extinction , the underlying sed should have more optical emission and consequently lower optical / x - ray and optical / submillimeter spectral indexes .",
    "the shape of the seds displaying sharp drops between the near - infrared and uv could still be consistent with those of misdirected lbl type objects .",
    "in this paper we have presented a survey of submillimeter continuum observations at 870 microns of the low redshift 3crr radio galaxies , which we observed with the heinrich hertz submillimeter telescope .",
    "we find that the submillimeter luminosities are about 50 times larger than that from the core 5ghz , but similar in size to the x - ray and optical luminosities .",
    "the seds for most of the fr  is are similar to what is expected from debeamed low energy peaked bl  lac type objects , agreeing with the results of previous works @xcite .",
    "we predict that the seds of most of these objects should peak in the infrared and so can be detected with forthcoming mid - ir imaging studies .    by examining a few seds in detail we have found good evidence for extinction in the optical region in sources with edge - on disks ( m84 , ngc 4261 , ngc 6251 ) but not in a source with a face - on disk ( 3c264 ) .",
    "we suspect that some of the scatter in optical spectral indexes is due to extinction from dust , and that many of these nuclei should be brighter at near and mid - infrared wavelengths .",
    "the ratio of submillimeter to x - ray and optical luminosities suggest that most of our sources have underlying spectra similar to lbl bl  lac type objects .",
    "however three objects ( the fr  i galaxy 3c264 , and the fr  ii galaxies 3c390.3 and 3c382 ) stand out as having higher optical to submillimeter and x - ray to submillimeter luminosity rations",
    ". these three cores are candidate hbl or intermediate type bl  lac type objects .",
    "previous studies have found that the optical emission is enhanced in some fr  ii galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , suggesting that the optical emission in some cases arises from an additional component such as an accretion disk .",
    "the two fr  iis with high optical to submillimeter luminosity ratios in our sample also have high x - ray to submillimeter ratios .",
    "this suggests that a similar emission mechanism is responsible for both excesses .",
    "one explanation would be that some fr  ii galaxies have seds similar to hbls rather than lbls , in which case the emission from the radio to the x - ray would be synchrotron emission . we find only 1 fr  i with an hbl type sed whereas we have found 2 such fr  iis out of a smaller number of sources .",
    "the larger number of fr  iis is surprising since the unified model for bl  lacs by @xcite suggests that those objects with higher luminosities have lower energy synchrotron peaks , whereas fr  ii radio galaxies tend to have have higher luminosities than fr  i radio galaxies .",
    "another possibility is that an additional emission mechanism is present in both the optical and x - ray wavelengths in 3c390.3 and 3c382 .",
    "these fr  iis have been identified optically as broad line radio galaxies ( blrgs ) .",
    "recent work has found that the x - ray to radio ratios in blrgs quasars tend to be above that expected from an extrapolation of lower energy objects @xcite , suggesting that there could be an additional component associated with an accretion disk accounting for the high optical to submillimter and x - ray to submillimeter flux ratios of 3c390.3 and 3c382 .",
    "fr  iis with weak and strong emission lines may participate differently in unified schemes ; it may be predominantly weak - lined fr  iis that are the parent population of bl  lac objects @xcite .",
    "recent work on bl  lacs suggest that the sed depends on a beaming factor as well as the energy density in the plasma @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that higher luminosity bl  lac type objects tend to have lower energy synchrotron peaks .",
    "however , the objects considered here with likely synchrotron peaks in the infrared have significantly lower power than the bl  lac type objects studied by @xcite .",
    "this makes it difficult to unify the 3crr sample with the known bl  lac population , however as pointed out by @xcite if the jets contain material accelerated at different velocities then it may be possible to resolve this problem .",
    "the seds presented in this paper suffer from lack of infrared coverage , diverse ( non - uniform ) types of measurements , and are comprised of observations spanning many years .",
    "since these sources are variable , much of the scatter in the points shown could be caused by intrinsic variability .",
    "it is likely that the shape of the sed depends on the current luminosity of the source @xcite , an effect that would be difficult to see given the scatter caused by the comparison of points at different epochs .",
    "better wavelength coverage , simultaneous observations and more uniform samples would better allow better studies and tests of unification models .",

    "<S> we present submillimeter continuum observations at 870 microns of the cores of low redshift 3crr radio galaxies , observed at the heinrich hertz submillimeter telescope . </S>",
    "<S> the cores are nearly flat spectrum between the radio and submillimeter which implies that the submillimeter continuum is likely to be synchrotron emission and not thermal emission from dust . </S>",
    "<S> the emitted power from nuclei detected at optical wavelengths and in the x - rays is similar in the submillimeter , optical and x - rays . </S>",
    "<S> the submillimeter to optical and x - ray power ratios suggest that most of these sources resemble misdirected bl  lac type objects with synchrotron emission peaking at low energies . </S>",

    "<S> . these three objects are candidate misdirected high or intermediate energy peaked bl  lac type objects . with additional infrared observations and from archival data , we compile spectral energy distributions ( seds ) for a subset of these objects . </S>",
    "<S> the steep dips observed near the optical wavelengths in many of these objects suggest that extinction inhibits the detection and reduces the flux of optical continuum core counterparts . </S>",
    "<S> high resolution near or mid - infrared imaging may provide better measurements of the underlying synchrotron emission peak . </S>"
