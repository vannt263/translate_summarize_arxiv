    "the appearance of vortices in a rotating dilute bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) is a phenomenon that is intrinsically related to the existence of superfluidity @xcite .",
    "this has been intensively studied @xcite after the achievement of bec in alkali - metal gases @xcite .",
    "the vortex formation can be understood as a local suppression of the bec due to rotation .",
    "it happens when the angular velocity @xmath2 exceeds a critical value @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the critical angular velocity is obtained by an energy argument @xcite , in which the energy of the bec without a vortex is higher than the energy of the bec with a vortex for @xmath4 . with higher angular velocities more",
    "than one vortex can be created to minimize the energy of the bec . in this paper",
    "we will concentrate on values of @xmath2 where only the the creation of a single vortex is possible .",
    "since vortices are accompanied by a local suppression of the bec , other mechanisms of bec suppression may interfere with the vortex formation .",
    "an important example is the depletion of the bec by a strong interaction between the bosonic particles .",
    "the latter is possible in the form of repulsive s - wave scattering in a dense bec @xcite .    in the case of a dilute bec ( i.e. for weak interaction ) a mean - field theory in terms of the gross - pitaevskii equation",
    "provides a description of the vortex formation @xcite .",
    "the relation between the number of particles in the bec and the critical angular velocity was determined within this approach @xcite .",
    "this can be extended to a dense bose gas , where not all particles contribute to the bec ( i.e. there is a depletion of the bec ) .",
    "the discussion of the dense bose gas requires a statistical description of the entire bose gas , using , for instance , a functional - integral representation @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it turns out that a classical field equation for the bec order parameter can also be derived , which is equivalent with the gross - pitaevskii equation in the limit of a dilute bose gas @xcite and a renormalized gross - pitaevskii equation for higher densities . in the regime of high densities",
    "the strongly interacting bose gas had been studied within this statistical approach @xcite .",
    "a relatively simple method to study strong interaction is the slave - boson approach .",
    "this method was originally suggested for strongly interacting fermions @xcite and was later also applied to bosons @xcite .",
    "the central idea of the method is to construct operators or fields for particles and holes in a fictitious vacuum , and to introduce a constraint , which guarantees that each position is occupied either by a particle or by a hole .",
    "this leads to a dynamics , where tunneling of physical particles is described by an exchange of a particle with a hole , and no multiple occupation by particles is possible .",
    "although this construction makes the theory more complex ( because of the additional holes ) , it also provides more freedom to choose a proper mean - field approximation .",
    "moreover , the bosonic version of the slave - boson approach , which will be applied in this paper , allows for an exact treatment of the constraint @xcite . here",
    "we will not present the details of the slave - boson approach but refer to the literature .",
    "a recent discussion can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . within a mean - field ( thomas - fermi ) approximation of a slave - boson theory",
    "we were able to study the formation of a vortex in the bec of a dense bose gas @xcite .",
    "however , a mean - field approach is a reliable approximation only for a bec that is smoothly changing in space .",
    "the latter is not the case near the core of a vortex , where the condensate density is changing strongly on short scales .",
    "therefore , it is important to extend the mean - field theory to a classical field theory with a kinetic term .",
    "this leads to a nonlinear partial differential equation which can be treated with a numerical method . in the present work we are using a relaxation approach .",
    "relaxation techniques have been extensively used to obtain the ground - state solution of the gross - pitaevskii equation @xcite .",
    "these techniques require interaction and need little computational efforts .",
    "the method provides stable solutions of the slave - boson approach .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we summarize the main equation of slave - boson approach . the trapped condensate is shown in spherical and cylindrical coordinates in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we discuss the numerical procedure used in this work and present the numerical results with and without vortex .",
    "afterwards we review our main results in section 5 .",
    "we consider a grand - canonical ensemble of bosons with chemical potential @xmath5 at temperature @xmath6 .",
    "its thermodynamics is described by the partition function @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the hamiltonian of the interacting bose gas , @xmath9 the particle number operator , and @xmath10 is the trace over all possible quantum states of the system .",
    "if the interaction is due to a hard core of a given radius @xmath11 , the bose gas can be approximated by a lattice gas with lattice constant @xmath11 .",
    "then we can apply the slave - boson approach @xcite which allows us to write the partition function @xmath12 as a functional integral with respect to a complex ( order - parameter ) field @xmath13 . here",
    "we start with an expression for @xmath12 , whose derivation was given in ref .",

    "we have introduced the parameters @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the tunneling rate of the lattice model ( i. e. before taking the continuum limit ) .",

    "moreover , the depletion of the condensate density at the center shows a perfect agreement between the full solution and the tfa in this region .    in order to compare the slave - boson ( sb ) approach with resuls for the dilute bose gas in the existing literature , we first evaluate the condensate density profile from the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation ( [ conventionalgp ] ) without @xmath77 and with @xmath78 vortex for the tfa and for the full kinetic gp equation .",

    "the cases of the gp and the sb calculations without vortex indicate that there is a noticeable depletion of the central condensate density in the sb approach .",
    "there is practically no difference between the tfa and the full solution . in the vortex case",
    ", the sb calculation shows that the core is also smooth when the kinetic term is added , as shown in the inset .",
    "therefore the depletion in the center is overestimated by the tfa .",
    "this indicates that the formation of a vortex is less favorable than predicted by the tfa . comparing the sb and the gp calculation in the vortex case",
    ", we also observe that the maximum of the sb profile is lower than that of the gp equation .",
    "thus the depletion is more effective in the sb approach than in the gp equation .",
    "these results are in agreement with the general idea that the sb approach takes into account higher order interaction terms , leading to a more pronounced depletion at the center .    the depletion at the center of the condensate should be observed experimentally by measuring the critical angular velocity of a stable vortex formation . in order to include strong interaction ,",
    "the measurement should be performed near a feshbach resonance , where the scattering length is very large .",
    "the critical angular velocity can be evaluated in the sb approach by following the procedure outlined previously in ref .",
    "a vortex in a rotating condensate is stable if the action , given in eq .",
    "( [ scontinuous ] ) , is smaller than the action of the condensate without vortex @xmath80 solving numerically eq .",
    "( [ sbeq_vortex ] ) and using this stability criterion , we find the critical angular velocity @xmath3 for a vortex formation . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we compile these results by plotting the critical angular velocity as a function of the number of condensed atoms .",
    "the tfa shows a lower critical angular velocity , both in the sb and in the gp approach , than the full numerical solutions .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with previous results for the gp equation @xcite .",
    "it can be simply understood in terms of our analysis above : adding the kinetic term smooths the core generated by tfa .",
    "thus the kinetic term adds condensed particles to the center .",
    "this effect suppresses the vortex formation .",
    "a comparison indicates that for a small number of atoms , i.e. low density , the sb prediction is practically the same as that of the gp equation .",
    "however , as we increase the number of atoms , the sb approach significantly deviates from the gp equation , showing lower critical angular velocity for a vortex formation . this can be explained with the profile analysis described above : the sb approach causes a stronger depletion than the gp equation .",
    "this difference is even enhanced as the total density increases . as a consequence ,",
    "a stronger depletion will favor a vortex formation and thus to a lower critical angular velocity .",
    "we employed the relaxation method to solve the slave - boson model . with this method we obtained results beyond the thomas - fermi approximation by including the kinetic term of the field equation .",
    "we noticed that the depletion of the condensate is overestimated by the thomas - fermi approximation .",
    "therefore , in this approximation the critical angular velocities are smaller than in the full solution .",
    "we also compared the full slave - boson model with the full gross - pitaevskii equation in the limit of low temperatures . in this limit ,",
    "the slave - boson condensate profiles are very similar to the gross - pitaevskii condensate profiles at low densities . as the density",
    "is increased , there is a significant enhancement of the depletion in the slave - boson approach as compared to the gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "this causes the critical angular velocity of vortex formation to be lower than expected from the gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "the latter results corroborate previous estimates within the thomas - fermi approximation done in ref.@xcite .",
    "all these effects should be observable in a bose gas near a feshbach resonance , where the scattering length is comparable with the mean distance of atoms .",
