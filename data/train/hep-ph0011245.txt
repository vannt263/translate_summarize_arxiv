    "the sudbury neutrino observatory @xcite is a second generation water cerenkov detector using 1000 tonnes of heavy water , d@xmath6o , as detection medium .",
    "sno was designed to address the problem of the deficit of solar neutrinos observed previously in the homestake  @xcite , sage  @xcite , gallex+gno  @xcite , kamiokande  @xcite and super  kamiokande  @xcite experiments , by having sensitivity to all flavours of neutrinos and not just to @xmath5 , allowing for a model independent test of the oscillation explanation of the observed deficit .",
    "such sensitivity can be achievable because energetic neutrinos can interact in the d@xmath6o of sno via three different reactions .",
    "electron neutrinos may interact via the charged current ( cc ) reaction @xmath7 with an energy threshold of several mev .",
    "all non - sterile neutrinos may also interact via neutral current ( nc ) @xmath8 with an energy threshold of 2.225 mev . with smaller cross section",
    "the non - sterile neutrinos can also interact via elastic scattering ( es ) @xmath9 .",
    "the main objective of sno is to measure the ratio of nc / cc events . in its first year of",
    "operation sno is concentrating on the measurement of the cc reaction rate while in a following phase , after the addition of mgcl@xmath6 salt to enhance the nc signal , it will also perform a precise measurement of the nc rate .",
    "it is clear that a cross - section - normalized and acceptance - corrected ratio higher than 1 would strongly indicate the oscillation of @xmath5 into @xmath1 and/or @xmath2 . on the other hand a deficit on both cc and",
    "nc leading to a normalized nc / cc ratio @xmath10 , can only be made compatible with the oscillation hypothesis if @xmath5 oscillates in to a sterile neutrino .",
    "there are several detailed studies in the literature of the potential of the sno experiment to discriminate between the different oscillation solutions to the solar neutrino problem ( snp ) @xcite .",
    "most of these studies have been performed in the framework of oscillations between two neutrino states where @xmath5 oscillates into either an active , @xmath11 , or a sterile , @xmath12 , neutrino channel . on the other hand ,",
    "once the possibility of a sterile neutrino is considered , these two scenarios are only limiting cases of the most general mixing structure @xcite which permits simultaneous @xmath12 and @xmath11 oscillations .",
    "in this paper we study the potential of the sudbury neutrino observatory to discriminate between active and sterile solar neutrino oscillations when analyzed in the framework of four  neutrino mixing .",
    "we consider those four ",
    "neutrino schemes favoured by considering together with the solar neutrino data , the results of the two additional evidences pointing out towards the existence of neutrino masses and mixing : the atmospheric neutrino data @xcite and the lsnd results @xcite .",
    "we concentrate on two sno measurements : the first expected result on the cc ratio and the expected to be most sensitive , the ratio of nc / cc .",
    "the measurement of other observables , such as the recoil energy spectrum of the cc events and the zenith angular dependence @xcite can provide important information to distinguish between the different allowed regions for @xmath5active oscillations but they are not expected to be very sensitive as discriminatory between the active and sterile oscillations .    the outline of the paper is the following . for the sake of completeness we begin by discussing in sec .

    "two ] the expected results when obtained in the pure two  neutrino oscillation hypothesis . in section  [ fourana ]",
    "we determine the presently allowed regions for the oscillation solutions to the snp in the framework of four  neutrino mixing . in sec .",
    "[ foursno ] we present the results of the expected cc and nc / cc rates for the different solutions and quantify the attainable sensitivity to the additional mixing controlling the admixture of active  sterile entering into the solar neutrino oscillations . finally in sec .",
    "[ discuss ] we summarize our conclusions .",
    "we first describe the results of the analysis of the solar neutrino data in terms of @xmath5 oscillations into either active or sterile neutrinos .",
    "we determine the allowed range of oscillation parameters using the total event rates of the chlorine @xcite , gallium @xcite and super ",
    "kamiokande @xcite ( corresponding to the 1117 days data sample ) experiments . for the gallium experiments",
    "we have used the weighted average of the results from gallex+gno and sage detectors .",
    "we have also include the super  kamiokande electron recoil energy spectrum measured separately during the day and night periods .",
    "this will be referred in the following as the day ",
    "night spectra data which contains @xmath13 data bins .",
    "the analysis includes the latest standard solar model fluxes , bp00 model  @xcite , with updated distributions for neutrino production points and solar matter density . for details on the statistical analysis applied to the different observables we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite . nevertheless , two comments on the statistical analysis are in order : +  in the present analysis we also include the contribution to the theoretical errors of the event rates arising from the small uncertainty in the measured @xmath14factor for the reaction @xmath15o(p,@xmath16)@xmath17f which is new in the bp00 model as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . following the standard procedure @xcite",
    ", we include this new source of uncertainty for the rates , that we denote as @xmath18 , by adding a new fractional @xmath19 uncertainty @xmath20 .",
    "since this uncertainty affects in direct proportion to the @xmath17f flux we correspondingly add a new line @xmath21 to the response matrix , with values @xmath22 and @xmath23 for all other fluxes .",
    "+  in the analysis of the day  night spectrum data we include the correlation between the systematic errors of the day and night bins which were conservatively ignored in ref.@xcite .",
    "thus , we use the correlation matrix : @xmath24 where i and j run from 1 to 36 bins in the day ",
    "night spectra data .",
    "@xmath25 is the statistical error , and @xmath26 is the error due to uncorrelated systematic uncertainties . @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the correlated errors due to correlated systematic experimental uncertainties and the calculation of the expected spectrum respectively ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "the addition of the correlations between the errors for the day and night bins , which more properly takes into account the day  night information , leads to stronger constraints on the regeneration region .    with all this we obtain",
    "that using the predicted fluxes from the bp00 model the @xmath29 for the total event rates is @xmath30 for 3 d.  o.  f. this means that the ssm together with the sm of particle interactions can explain the observed data with a probability lower than @xmath31 .",
    "the allowed regions in the oscillation parameter space are shown in fig .",
    "[ 2frspdn ] .",
    "we present them in the full parameter space for oscillations including both msw@xcite and vacuum@xcite oscillations , as well as quasi - vacuum@xcite oscillations ( qvo ) and matter effects for mixing angles in the second octant ( the so called dark side @xcite ) . in the case of @xmath5active neutrino oscillations",
    "we find that the best ",
    "fit point is obtained for the lma solution .",
    "there are two more local minima of @xmath29 in the msw region : the sma and low solutions .",
    "notice also that low and qvo regions are connected at the 99 % cl and they extend into the second octant so maximal mixing is allowed at 99 % cl for @xmath32 in what we define as the low",
    " qvo region .    following the standard procedure ,",
    "the allowed regions are defined in terms of shifts of the @xmath29 function _ with respect to the global minimum in the plane_. defined this way , the size of a region depends on the _ relative _ quality of its local minimum with respect to the global minimum but from the size of the region we can not infer the actual _ absolute _ quality of the description in each region . in order to give this information we list in table  [ minima ] the goodness of the fit ( gof ) for each solution obtained from the value of @xmath29 at the different minima .    for oscillations into sterile neutrinos",
    "the global minimum lies in the sma solution . as seen in fig .",
    "[ 2frspdn ] we find that with the present data and using the criteria explained above , there are also allowed solutions for sterile neutrinos in the lma and low ",
    "qvo regions at 99 % cl once the day ",
    "night spectra data is included .",
    "we consider , however , that they are not acceptable solutions as their fit to the global rates is really poor with a probability of acceptance less than 0.004 .",
    "the differences between both oscillation scenarios ( active and sterile ) can be easily understood . unlike active neutrinos which lead to events in the super  kamiokande detector by interacting via nc with the electrons , sterile neutrinos",
    "do not contribute to the super  kamiokande event rates .",
    "therefore a larger survival probability for @xmath33b neutrinos is needed to accommodate the measured rate . as a consequence a larger contribution from @xmath33b neutrinos to the chlorine and gallium experiments is expected , so that the small measured rate in chlorine can only be accommodated if no @xmath34be neutrinos are present in the flux .",
    "this is only possible in the sma solution region , since in the lma and low regions the suppression of @xmath34be neutrinos is not enough .",
    "notice also that the sma region for oscillations into sterile neutrinos is slightly shifted downwards as compared with the active case .",
    "this is due to the small modification on the neutrino survival probability induced by the different matter potentials .",
    "the matter potential for sterile neutrinos is smaller than for active neutrinos due to the negative nc contribution proportional to the neutron abundance .",
    "for this reason the resonant condition for sterile neutrinos is achieved at lower @xmath32 . on the other hand , the flatter spectrum ,",
    "is better fitted in both lma and low regions independently of the active or sterile nature of the neutrino .",
    "this leads to the improvement of the quality of the description for these solutions for both active and sterile neutrinos .",
    "however , as mentioned above , for the analysis of the total rates these lma and low solutions give a very bad fit in the sterile case and we decide not to consider them in the following . also , as we will see in next section , when the analysis is performed in the framework of four  neutrino oscillations those large mixing solutions for sterile neutrinos do not appear .",
    "next we quantify the predictions for the sno observables in the allowed regions discussed above .",
    "the total number of events in the cc reaction at sno can be obtained as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the neutrino energy , @xmath37 are the total neutrino @xmath33b and hep fluxes , @xmath38 is the neutrino energy spectrum ( normalized to 1 ) and @xmath39 is the time  averaged @xmath5 survival probability for oscillations into either active or sterile neutrinos . here",
    "@xmath40 is the @xmath41d cc cross section computed from the corresponding differential cross sections folded with the finite energy resolution function of the detector and integrated over the electron recoil energy : @xmath42 where t and t are the _ measured _ and the _ true _ kinetic energy of the recoil electrons and @xmath43 indicates the threshold expected from the experiment .",

    "correspondingly , the total number of events in the nc reaction at sno is obtained as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the @xmath41d nc cross section from  @xcite and @xmath51 is the time ",
    "averaged probability of oscillation into any other active neutrino . in the case",
    "that @xmath5 oscillates only into active neutrinos @xmath52=1 and @xmath53 is a constant .    in order to cancel out all energy independent efficiencies and normalizations",
    "we will use the ratio : @xmath54 } }   \\label{ratescc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the predicted number of events in the case of no oscillations .",
    "the equivalent expression for the nc ratio @xmath56 } }    \\label{ratesnc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] out of those ratios one can compute the double ratio @xmath57 [ nc]/[cc ] for which the largest sources of uncertainties cancel out  @xcite . as it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the ratio between the nc and cc reaction cross sections is extremely stable against any variations of the inputs of the calculations .",
    "the expected total uncertainties for the [ cc ] ratio and the [ nc]/[cc ] ratio are 6.7 % and 3.6 % respectively assuming 5000 cc events and 1219 nc events  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ 2fsno ] we show the predicted [ cc ] and [ nc]/[cc ] ratios for the allowed regions in the two flavour analysis .",
    "the dots correspond to the local best fit points and the error bars show the range of predictions for the points inside the 90 and 99 % cl allowed regions .",
    "the mapping of the regions onto these bars can be easily understood from the behaviour of the probability for the different solutions : + ( a ) for oscillations into active neutrinos the [ nc]/[cc ] ratio is simply the inverse of the [ cc ] prediction .",
    "therefore    * in the sma region smaller mixing angles are mapped onto higher ( lower ) values of [ cc ] ( [ nc]/[cc ] ) ratio .",
    "one may notice that the prediction for the [ cc ] rate for the global best fit point ( 0.72 ) is larger than the measured rate at super  kamiokande .",
    "this is due to the nearly flat spectrum at super  kamiokande which implies that the best fit point in the global analysis corresponds to a smaller mixing angle than the best fit point for the analysis of rates only .",
    "* in the lma region , the lower @xmath32 and @xmath58 values are mapped onto higher ( lower ) [ nc]/[cc ] ( [ cc ] ) ratios and viceversa . * in the low region the higher ( lower ) [ nc]/[cc ] ( [ cc ] ) ratio occurs for smaller @xmath58 and higher @xmath32 .",
    "\\(b ) for the sterile case , the best fit point in sma occurs at lower @xmath32 than in the active case and this produces a higher prediction for the [ cc ] ratio ( 0.74 ) .",
    "the [ nc]/[cc ] ratio takes an almost constant value very close to one ( 0.98 in the best fit point ) , since both numerator and denominator are proportional to @xmath59 .",
    "it is smaller than one because for the sma solution the probability increases with energy in the range of detection at sno and the threshold for the nc reaction is below the one for the cc one .",
    "for the sake of consistency we have checked that our results agree perfectly with those in ref .",
    "@xcite when comparing the same points in the parameter space .",
    "however a careful reader may notice that the predictions at the best fit points and ranges in each region displayed in fig .",
    "[ 2fsno ] are slightly different of those in ref .",
    "the difference is due to two factors .",
    "first , the allowed regions are defined in a different way . in ref .",
    "@xcite departures from the standard solar model in the boron flux normalization are allowed and moreover the regions are defined in terms of shifts of the @xmath29 function _ with respect to the local minimum in the corresponding region_. second , the inclusion of the updated data , mainly the super ",
    "kamiokande day  night spectra , lowers the value of @xmath60 for the best bit point in the sma region by a factor  2 and increases @xmath32 for the best fit point in lma by a factor  1.5 .",
    "what we see from these results is that while the data on [ cc ] can give a hint towards large or small mixing solutions , it will be hard to distinguish active from sterile oscillations on the only bases of this measurement .",
    "this is not the case for the [ nc]/[cc ] ratio where both scenarios appear nicely separated .",
    "it is not hard to foresee from these results that from the [ nc]/[cc ] measurement sno will be able to constraint the additional mixings in the four  neutrino scenario which describe the admixture of active and sterile oscillations .",
    "this is the main point in this paper .",
    "together with the results from the solar neutrino experiments we have two more evidences pointing out towards the existence of neutrino masses and mixing : the atmospheric neutrino data @xcite and the lsnd results @xcite .",
    "all these experimental results can be accommodated in a single neutrino oscillation framework only if there are at least three different scales of neutrino mass - squared differences .",
    "the simplest case of three independent mass - squared differences requires the existence of a light sterile neutrino , _",
    "i.e. _ one whose interaction with standard model particles is much weaker than the sm weak interaction , so it does not affect the invisible z decay width , precisely measured at lep .",
    "there are six possible four  neutrino schemes that can accomodate all these evidences .",
    "they can be divided in two classes : 3 + 1 and 2 + 2 . in the 3 + 1 schemes",
    "there is a group of three neutrino masses separated from an isolated mass by a gap of the order of 1ev which gives the mass - squared difference responsible for the short - baseline oscillations observed in the lsnd experiment . in 2 + 2 schemes",
    "there are two pairs of close masses separated by the lsnd gap .",
    "we have ordered the masses in such a way that in all these schemes @xmath61 produces solar neutrino oscillations and @xmath62 ( we use the common notation @xmath63 ) .",
    "3 + 1 schemes are disfavoured by experimental data with respect to the 2 + 2 schemes @xcite but they are still marginally allowed @xcite .",
    "in any of these four - neutrino schemes the flavour neutrino fields @xmath64 ( we choose @xmath65 ) are related to the fields @xmath66 of neutrinos with masses @xmath67 by a rotation @xmath68 .",
    "@xmath68 is a @xmath69 unitary mixing matrix , which contains , in general , 6 mixing angles and 3 cp violating phases ( 3 additional phases appear for majorana neutrinos but they are irrelevant for oscillations ) .",
    "we neglect here the cp phases , which , in the schemes considered , are irrelevant for solar neutrinos because their effect is washed out by averaging over neutrino energy and distance .",
    "existing bounds from negative searches for neutrino oscillations performed at colliders as well as reactor experiments , in particular the negative results of the bugey @xcite and chooz @xcite @xmath70 disappearance experiment , impose severe constrains on the possible mixing structures for the four  neutrino scenario .",
    "in particular they imply that the matrix elements @xmath71 and @xmath72 are very small @xcite . as a consequence , for any of these four  neutrino schemes , either 2 + 2 or 3 + 1 ,",
    "only four mixing angles are relevant in the study of solar neutrino oscillations  @xcite and the @xmath68 matrix can be written as @xmath73 where @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 are four mixing angles and @xmath78 and @xmath79 .    since solar neutrino oscillations are generated by the mass - square difference between @xmath80 and @xmath81 , it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ u - sun ] ) that the survival of solar @xmath5 s mainly depends on the mixing angle @xmath74 , whereas the mixing angles @xmath75 and @xmath76 determine the relative amount of transitions into sterile @xmath3 or active @xmath82 , this last one being a combination of @xmath1 and @xmath2 controlled by the mixing angle @xmath83 .",
    "@xmath1 and @xmath2 can not be distinguished in solar neutrino experiments , because their matter potential and their interaction in the detectors are equal , due only to nc weak interactions . as a consequence",
    "the active / sterile ratio and the survival probability for solar neutrino oscillations do not depend on the mixing angle @xmath77 , and depend on the mixing angles @xmath75 @xmath76 only through the combination @xmath84 .",

    "dimensional @xmath94 .",
    "we want to stress that , although originally this derivation was performed in the framework of the 2 + 2 schemes  @xcite , it is equally valid for the 3 + 1 ones @xcite .",
    "we first present the results of the allowed regions in the three ",
    "parameter space for the global combination of observables .",

    "notice , however , that the statistical analysis is different : in the two  neutrino picture the pure @xmath5active and @xmath5sterile cases are analyzed separately , whereas in the four  neutrino picture they are taken into account simultaneously in a consistent scheme . since the gof of the sma solution for pure @xmath5sterile oscillations is worse than for sma pure active oscillations ( as discussed in the previous section ) , the corresponding allowed region is smaller because they are now defined with respect to a common minimum . also , we notice , that for the sma solution the best scenario is a non - zero admixture between active and sterile oscillations . for this reason",

    "the [ nc]/[cc ] ratio can definitively improve the discrimination between the different scenarios provided its measurement lies in the upper range . for instance a measurement of [ nc]/[cc]@xmath106 4 ( @xmath115 0.7 at @xmath116 ) will be conclusive for selecting lma as the solution to the snp and will imply and upper bound on @xmath117 .    the predictions for the low  qvo region lie between the ones for sma and lma as displayed in fig .",
    "[ 4fsno_low ] and therefore they are more difficult to discriminate . the predictions at 99% vary in the range [ cc]@xmath106 0.30.68 and [ nc]/[cc]@xmath106 1.23.4 . as a consequence",
    "we see that a low [ cc ] ratio but still within the 99% cl range allowed for this region , 0.3@xmath107[cc]@xmath1070.4 , will constrain significantly the @xmath98 parameter compatible with this solution but it will not be distinguishable from the lma solution unless the measured [ cc]@xmath1070.3 . as mentioned above",
    ", the [ nc]/[cc ] ratio will be able to differentiate the lma and low - qvo solutions if not in the range [ 1.5,3 ] .",
    "one should also notice that for the upper part of this range a positive measurement of the day ",
    "night asymmetry and the zenith dependence  @xcite will point towards the higher @xmath118 of the low region as the solution .",
    "in this paper we have studied the potential of the sudbury neutrino observatory to discriminate between active or sterile solar neutrino oscillations when analyzed in the framework of four  neutrino mixing .",
    "we considered those four ",
    "neutrino schemes favoured by considering together with the solar neutrino data , the results of the two additional evidences pointing out towards the existence of neutrino masses and mixing : the atmospheric neutrino data @xcite and the lsnd results @xcite .",
    "these schemes allow simultaneous transitions of solar @xmath0 into active @xmath1 s , @xmath2 s and sterile @xmath3 controlled by the additional parameter @xmath4 and they contain as limiting cases the pure @xmath5active and @xmath5sterile neutrino oscillations .",
    "the allowed solar solutions have been reanalyzed including the recently bp00 standard solar model and the latest solar neutrino data .",
    "we find that the global minimum lies in the lma region and for pure @xmath5active oscillations ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "we also find that in the framework of four  neutrino mixing the sma solution is allowed at 90% cl for non vanishing active  sterile mixing @xmath98 in the range [ 0.11,0.31 ] .",
    "we concentrated on two sno measurements : the first expected result on the [ cc ] ratio and the expected to be most sensitive to the active  sterile admixture , the ratio of [ nc]/[cc ] and evaluated the predictions in the different regions as a function of the additional mixing @xmath98 .",
    "our results are display in figs .",
    "[ 4fsno_sma]@xmath102[4fsno_low ] .",
    "they show that in most cases with the measurement of the [ cc ] ratio , it will be hard to improve the present knowledge of @xmath98 but with the precise determination of the [ nc / cc ] ratio at sno , this parameter can be strongly constrained for some of the allowed solutions . for example , we find that for the [ cc ] rate the most discriminatory scenario would be that sno finds a small value [ cc]@xmath113 .",
    "this significantly hints towards the lma solution to the solar neutrino problem and towards an active  active oscillation scenario . in this case",
    "the [ nc]/[cc]@xmath106 4 ( @xmath115 0.7 at @xmath116 ) will be conclusive for selecting lma as the solution to the snp and will imply and upper bound on @xmath117 .",
    "conversely , a measurement of [ nc]/[cc]@xmath111 , although harder to distinguish from the non  oscillation scenario , will push the oscillation hypothesis towards the sterile sma solution , and with the expected sensitivity a bound @xmath119 at 99% cl can be imposed .",
    "we thank j.  n.  bahcall for clarifying several aspects of bp00 standard solar model .",
    "we also acknowledge valuable discussions with e. lisi on the correlations in the day ",
    "night spectra and with c. giunti on the four  neutrino schemes .",
