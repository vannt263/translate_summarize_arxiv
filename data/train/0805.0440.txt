    "the ground state hyperfine separations between levels with neighboring values of @xmath107 range from 4.31 to 8.28 ghz , so selective shelving to or from the auxiliary levels as well as rydberg levels are well resolved as regards different @xmath107 values . for each value of @xmath107",

    "this allows the use of greater than @xmath200 rabi frequencies while keeping the probability of population transfer of a nonaddressed bit below the @xmath0 level in the worst case , and much less for the majority of register bits",
    ".    there remains , however , the problem of selectively addressing bits for single qubit rotations . in this case",
    "the resonance condition scales as @xmath201 the worst case is for bits 40 - 60 since @xmath202 and @xmath203 the selectivity between bits with neighboring @xmath194 values is thus only @xmath204 or about @xmath205 to run single qubit operations at a @xmath206 rabi frequency and have errors at the @xmath0 level on a neighboring bit requires a detuning of about @xmath207 or about a @xmath208 field . while this is not particularly large we simultaneously require small dephasing on the most sensitive bits 1 and 9 which see a big differential shift of @xmath209 any known differential rotation can be accounted for , so the feasibility of zeeman selectivity without inducing unwanted dephasing rests on the ability to create a very low noise bias magnetic field .",
    "such a large field only needs to be turned on for a time given by the inverse rabi frequency or about @xmath210 . to keep the dephasing error at @xmath0 of a radian",
    "would require a field stability of @xmath211 this is not impossible but will be a technically challenging requirement .",
    "there are several possible approaches to mitigating this stability requirement .",
    "since shelving is well resolved by much smaller magnetic fields than those needed to resolve single qubit rotations , we can shelve bits @xmath212 to the metastable @xmath91 level , do the rotation there , and then return them to the ground state levels . alternatively , to perform a rotation on a qubit encoded in @xmath213 states we first swap the bit with a bit encoded in @xmath214 ( @xmath215 and @xmath216 ) , relabel the information , and then perform the rotation on the bit in @xmath217 this has the advantage that the swap operation has a larger selectivity governed by the @xmath109 of the lower @xmath107 states .",
    "swapping in this way from @xmath213 to @xmath214 reduces the bias field requirement by a factor of @xmath218      finally we need to consider rydberg interactions in ho .",
    "the asymptotic scaling of eq .",
    "( [ eq.c6p ] ) is expected to hold at large @xmath6 for any atomic species with singly excited rydberg states so the estimates found in sec .",
    "[ sec.lattice ] should remain valid , although the precise numerical values will require adjustment .",
    "we know of no principal reasons why rydberg blockade analogous to what has been studied in the alkalis@xcite should not be possible but a detailed characterization remains a topic for future investigation .",
    "we are aware of only one experimental study of the rydberg structure of ho@xcite where the rydberg series corresponding to excitation of @xmath219 was observed by collisional ionization .",
    "resolved rydberg levels up to @xmath220 were seen .",
    "as these are even parity states excitation from the ground state requires either one @xmath221 photon or a three step excitation at longer wavelengths .",
    "the @xmath222 or @xmath223 series which are accessible by two step excitation are a second possibility .    the largest uncertainty as regards the feasibility of rydberg gates in ho concerns the rydberg state lifetimes . in sec .",
    "[ sec.lattice ] we assumed @xmath224 blackbody scaling . if the ho rydberg series are perturbed by interactions between the valence and core electrons the lifetime could be substantially altered .",
    "if strong core - valence interactions do occur they are likely to be specific to particular @xmath6 values , so that with judicious choice of the rydberg level it should be possible to minimize the impact of series perturbations .",
    "in light of the principle feasibility of collective encoding in ho discussed above , it is interesting to examine how an array of ensembles can be efficiently prepared in the geometry shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.array ] .",
    "the use of a many atom ensemble at each site , instead of requiring deterministic loading of single atoms , immediately removes one of the prime challenges of neutral atom quantum computing , which has been the difficulty of preparing a singly occupied lattice of optically resolvable sites .",
    "there has been a considerable amount of work on this problem based on several different solutions .",
    "an elegant approach relies on the bec to mott insulator transition@xcite as has been demonstrated in recent experiments@xcite .",
    "unfortunately the transition only works in finite time with a very short period lattice which does not give optically resolvable lattice sites .",
    "this has been partially addressed by the demonstrated transfer of the insulating state to a longer period lattice@xcite .",
    "while the mott insulator transition at finite temperature does not result in a lattice that is filled with perfect fidelity there are also possible solutions to purifying the lattice@xcite .",
    "these purifying steps can also potentially be used on a lattice which is imperfectly filled directly from a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) , without needing a bec phase@xcite .",
    "one of us has also proposed a deterministic loading scheme@xcite which relies on rydberg blockade to remove all but one atom from a multiply filled site .",
    "this can potentially be implemented in parallel on a large number of sites .",
    "the ensemble based approach described here is potentially much simpler since it does not require preparing sites with single atom occupancy",
    ". based on the results of@xcite a 60 bit register , including error correction , needs an ensemble of @xmath225 atoms . for the purposes of the present discussion we will target a value somewhat larger say , @xmath226 these @xmath1 atoms",
    "should all be confined to a small volume to allow an effective rydberg blockade and to maximize the total number of processor qubits .",
    "the disadvantage of a multi - atom ensemble is that high density samples suitable for rydberg blockade experiments are susceptible to collisions which will drastically reduce coherence times . to solve this problem we propose to load the ensemble in a short period lattice , thereby eliminating collisional decoherence .",
    "the loading protocol is shown in fig . [ fig.loading ] .",
    "we start with ho in a mot , and assume doppler cooling to a few @xmath227 using transition e ) .",
    "the atoms are then transferred into a 3d blue detuned lattice ( 3 pairs of beams with orthogonal polarizations , and frequency shifts to avoid unwanted interference ) created with @xmath228 light , as described above .",
    "the angle between each pair of beams is adjusted to give a lattice spacing of @xmath229 which corresponds to a lattice site density of @xmath230 magneto - optical trapping of er has resulted in peak densities of @xmath231 and we expect similar baseline results for ho .",
    "it is unknown what densities can be achieved using transient magnetic compression and/or evaporative cooling , but by analogy with experience from the alkalis where evaporation has produced small samples with densities above @xmath232@xcite preparing a few thousand atoms with @xmath233 appears realistic .",
    "loading such a sample into the above lattice would give a filling fraction of @xmath234 assuming poissonian loading statistics the probability of double site occupancy at this filling fraction is @xmath235 which implies that for @xmath74 about 18 sites will have more than one atom .",
    "the atoms in these sites will rapidly redistribute or be lost from the trap due to hyperfine changing collisions leaving a sample with slightly smaller @xmath1 but only single atom occupancy at all sites .",
    "we then superimpose a blue - detuned bottle beam trap@xcite and drop the lattice to remove atoms outside the region defined by the bottle beam ( frames b , c in fig .",
    "[ fig.loading ] ) .",
    "the lattice is then restored and the bottle beam turned off ( frames d , e ) which leaves us with @xmath1 atoms in the lattice , in a well defined spatial region .",
    "we can achieve an average value of @xmath236 using @xmath237 and a spherical bottle beam trapping region with diameter @xmath238 ( the bottle beam trapping potential is not far from spherical for such small trap volumes ) .",
    "the probability of doubly occupied sites , and hence collisions , will be somewhat higher than in the initial lattice state since in the bottle beam transfer phase when the lattice is dropped the atoms will tend to fall towards the center and compress",
    ". this effect will be smaller than in a harmonic trap since our bottle beam design provides a quartic transverse potential , @xmath239 , which provides only weak radial compression .",
    "the potential is harmonic axially , but by judicious choice of the time window for the bottle beam transfer @xmath240 where @xmath241 is the axial vibrational period , and @xmath14 is an integer multiplier , compression effects should be minimized .    following the above procedure",
    "we can prepare a localized region with @xmath242 atoms .",
    "this can readily be done in parallel at multiple sites by superimposing an array of bottle beams on the 3d lattice .",
    "poissonian loading statistics will imply @xmath243 variations in @xmath1 from site to site , and hence variations in rabi frequencies for qubit operations involving rydberg levels .",
    "for the first encoded qubit which is supported by @xmath74 atoms the rabi frequency variations will be @xmath244 or @xmath245 .",
    "for the last encoded qubit which is supported by @xmath246 atoms the rabi frequency variations will be @xmath247 or @xmath248 .",
    "these variation will not prevent high - accuracy gate operations since composite pulse sequences can be readily used to remove the dependency on rabi frequency variations .",
    "we have thus arrived at the situation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.array ] with an array of closely spaced ensembles .",
    "if the diameter of each ensemble is about @xmath249 then we might space them in a plane by @xmath250 using addressing beams with flatter than gaussian profiles to minimize site to site cross talk .",
    "the scaling arguments of sec .",
    "[ sec.lattice ] imply we can connect roughly @xmath82 ensembles .",
    "the total processor size is thus @xmath251 directly coupled qubits .",
    "we have presented a path towards a neutral atom gate array that could allow as many as a thousand qubits to be interconnected without resorting to mechanical motion , swap chains , or interconversion between stationary and flying qubits .",
    "the scaling relies on optimization of qubit array and rydberg parameters to allow up to 500 sites to be directly coupled in a planar geometry .",
    "the estimate was based on realistic parameters , including gate errors of @xmath63 and a maximum principal quantum number of @xmath64 .",
    "this limit may be too conservative , and the ultimate limit in a planar geometry may be higher than predicted here . nevertheless manipulating single atoms in such a large number of sites",
    "presents a difficult experimental challenge .",
    "we can avoid the overhead associated with individual addressing and single atom loading at each site by invoking collective encoding .",
    "using ho atoms this gives a multiplying factor of 60 per site .",
    "since the ensemble sites are larger than those holding a single atom we arrive at a limit of about 17 sites , each with 60 collectively addressed qubits , giving a 1000 qubit scale device .",
    "our estimates are based on available spectroscopic data for ho .",
    "more information , particularly concerning the rydberg states of ho , will be needed to further refine the limits discussed here .",
    "another attractive application of collective encoding would be to use a single ensemble with a 60 qubit register as a quantum repeater , or as part of a hybrid quantum computation scheme involving small , optically connected registers@xcite .",
    "the 60 qubits are sufficient for 8 logical qubits , each built from 7 physical qubits , or , for example , 5 logical qubits , each built from 5 decoherence free subspace encoded qubits , that in turn require 2 physical qubits each@xcite . in this way 50 physical qubits would enable 5 error corrected and potentially low decoherence logical qubits in one ensemble .",
    "the ensemble qubits can be efficiently mapped to and from photonic bits using blockade mediated preparation of excited states@xcite , and the large choice of transitions in ho provides flexible opportunities for coupling to wavelengths compatible with optical fiber transmission .",
    "there are undeniably many challenges associated with collective encoding , particularly in rare earth atoms that are relatively poorly studied and have not been widely used for laser cooling . a large number of lasers of different wavelengths and frequencies are required for the various internal state manipulations . in some sense we have transferred the complexity of moving the information about spatially , as in current approaches to scalable ion traps , to the problem of dexterously moving information between internal states .",
    "although the overall complexity required to build a scalable quantum processor will remain very high , we believe it is worthwhile to explore a wide range of approaches . indeed , we are not aware of any approaches to building a thousand qubit scale quantum logic device that are simple .",
