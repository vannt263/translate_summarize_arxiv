    "the domination of m dwarfs in the galaxy s stellar census makes them ideal tracers of the kinematics , structure , and evolution of the milky way .",
    "many of these stars are also host to large magnetic fields that act to heat the upper atmosphere and give rise to magnetic activity ( as often traced by chromospheric emission lines ) .",
    "observations of magnetic activity put important constraints on the internal structure , the relationship between magnetic field generation and rotation , atmospheric models , and the ages of m dwarfs .",
    "although low - mass stars are intrinsically faint , recent large surveys include an unprecedented number of m dwarfs .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ? * ) in particular has identified @xmath530 million m dwarfs in the photometric database ( bochanski et al .",
    ", in prep . ) and over 40,000 m dwarfs with spectra @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite used these spectra to statistically examine the magnetic activity properties ( as traced by h@xmath6 ) of field m dwarfs .",
    "because the sdss sample traces a large range of physical and dynamic properties , it provides an important laboratory for studying how magnetic activity changes as a function of mass , metallicity , rotation , and stellar age @xcite .",
    "magnetic activity is often quantified by computing the ratio of the luminosity in an emission line ( typically h@xmath6 ) to the bolometric luminosity of the star ( l@xmath7/l@xmath8 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "this quantity allows for comparison of stars of different temperatures , where changes in the continua can severely affect the derived equivalent widths .",
    "although the activity - bolometric ratio is strictly distance independent , the challenges associated with obtaining accurate bolometric fluxes ( namely good bolometric corrections for individual stars ) have resulted in studies that use a color or spectral type dependent bolometric luminosity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and thus still require a distance to solve for the line emission luminosity .",
    "for h@xmath6 , the line luminosity is often calculated using the equivalent width of the emission line , and the luminosity of the continuum near h@xmath6 ; the latter can be measured directly from a flux - calibrated spectrum and a measured stellar distance .",
    "alternatively , the continuum luminosity can be estimated from the photometric colors @xcite . because of the difficulty in calculating individual bolometric corrections for large samples of stars , the fact that many spectra are not flux - calibrated ( e.g. high resolution echelle data and data taken under non - photometric conditions ) and that distance estimates to most m dwarfs are still a major source of systematic uncertainty @xcite , an alternative approach to calculating the activity - bolometric ratio is required .",
    "* hereafter whw04 ) and later @xcite , introduced a novel method for calculating l@xmath7/l@xmath8 by removing many of the intermediate steps and requiring only a measurement of the equivalent width of the emission line ( ew ) and either the color or the spectral type of the star .",
    "whw04 , defined a sample of nearby stars with known distances ( from trigonometric parallax ) , derived bolometric corrections and used flux - calibrated spectra to solve for the ratio of the h@xmath6 continuum region luminosity to the bolometric luminosity as a function of both spectral type and color .",
    "this ratio is dubbed @xmath0 ,    @xmath9    and when multiplied by the ew of the h@xmath6 emission line yields the following l@xmath7/l@xmath8 ratio :    @xmath10    the power of the @xmath0 method ( whw04 ) is that it does not require a flux - calibrated spectrum to obtain l@xmath7/l@xmath8 , and it is distance independent .",
    "although previous studies had applied similar strategies for obtaining l@xmath7/l@xmath8 @xcite , they did not explicitly report recipes for obtaining `` @xmath0 '' and they relied on colors and photometric or spectroscopic parallax relations , or in the latter case , spectral models , to obtain l@xmath7(continuum ) .",
    "whw04 was the first study to use flux - calibrated spectra to determine l@xmath7(continuum ) and to present empirical @xmath0 values in h@xmath6 for the entire m dwarf sequence .",
    "recently , @xcite derived @xmath0 values for h@xmath6 from model spectra as a function of effective temperature .",
    "although the @xcite @xmath0 relations are similar to those in whw04 for stars hotter than 2600 k ( @xmath5m6 ) , they do not produce the plateau seen in the late - type empirically derived @xmath0s from whw04 .",
    "this discrepancy is likely due to problems with the spectral models of late - type dwarfs , which do not reproduce the correct optical colors and magnitudes of m dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the difference in derived log(l@xmath7/l@xmath8 ) values using the two methods rises to 0.6 dex at a spectral type of m9 .",
    "we prefer to rely on the measured data rather than models , and adopt the whw04 @xmath0 values for h@xmath6 in our analysis .",
    "the whw04 @xmath0s have shown great utility in computing l@xmath7/l@xmath8 in numerous studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but h@xmath6 is not the only emission line produced by an active chromosphere .",
    "in fact , h@xmath6 may not always be the best tracer of activity as compared to other lines @xcite .",
    "traditionally , there have been several limitations in using the bluer emission lines , namely that the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) in the blue part of an m dwarf spectrum is low because the continuum emission peaks in the near - infrared , and ccds have been more sensitive in the red .",
    "several recent studies have examined magnetic activity as traced by the ca ii h and k emission lines and higher order balmer transitions including h@xmath1 , h@xmath2 , h@xmath3 , h@xmath4 and h8 @xcite , but star - to - star comparisons have been limited by the lack of line specific @xmath0 conversions to activity - bolometric luminosity ratios .    in this paper , we expand upon the whw04 study , using similar methods to compute @xmath0 values for the ca ii h and k emission lines as well as the h@xmath1 , h@xmath2 , h@xmath3 , h@xmath4 and h8 balmer emission lines .",
    "we describe the data and our techniques in  2 . in  3 we derive @xmath0 for each emission line as a function of both color and spectral type and use these values to investigate the mean emission line properties of active m dwarfs .",
    "we discuss the results in  4 .",
    "we used two complementary techniques and datasets to derive a single set of @xmath0 values for the blue emission lines in m dwarfs .",
    "the first technique uses flux - calibrated blue spectra for a sample of nearby stars with good parallaxes and distances .",
    "the second made use of the @xcite sdss spectral templates , which provide high s / n average spectra at each m spectral type , flux - calibrated on a relative scale .",
    "these two methods were combined to derive @xmath0 values as a function of both color and spectral type and are described in detail below .",

    "the @xmath40 vs. @xmath0 relations for h@xmath2 , h@xmath3 , h8 , along with the caiik , caiih , and h@xmath4 , were obtained using the observed colors of the individual nearby stars in ph89 ( see table [ tab : stars ] ) and the measured @xmath0 values discussed above , while the h@xmath6 relation is taken from the colors and @xmath0 values in whw04 . the colors for the h@xmath1 @xmath40 versus @xmath0 relation were derived by transforming the mean @xmath38 colors for each spectral type to @xmath40 using the @xmath41 vs. @xmath40 transformation of @xcite and the following linear transformation between @xmath41 and @xmath38 that we found from the @xcite sample :    @xmath42    the @xmath40 vs. @xmath0 relations do not extend beyond @xmath40 @xmath43 3.05 ( @xmath5m5 ; except for h@xmath6 ) due to the lack of late - type m dwarfs with measured @xmath40 colors in the ph89 sample .",
    "we fit analytic relations to our derived @xmath0 values as a function of spectral type , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 color .",
    "we adopt the exponential form of whw04 :    @xmath44    where @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are derived coefficients and @xmath48 is the associated variable ( e.g. @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) .",
    "all of the fits were performed using a levenberg - marquardt least - squares method .",
    "tables [ tab : spt]-[tab : v_i ] give the resulting fit coefficients for each @xmath0 value .",
    "most of the fits require 2 piecewise ( but continuous ) components ; the tables specify the range over which each fit component is valid .",
    "in addition , the tables provide a typical uncertainty in the derived @xmath0 for each fit component .    using our derived @xmath0 values and the active templates of @xcite , we next computed l@xmath49/l@xmath8 values as a function of spectral type for the h@xmath6 , h@xmath1 , h@xmath2 , h8 and caii k emission lines .",
    "the @xcite active templates consist of the mean spectrum of up to several hundred active sdss m dwarfs at each spectral type .",
    "we measured the ews of the h@xmath6 , h@xmath1 , h@xmath2 , h8 and caii k emission lines in each of the @xcite active templates , taking care to use the continuum regions from table [ tab : cont ] for our measurements ( see section 2.1 ) .",
    "lines which were not in emission in a given template were omitted . combining the measured ews with our new @xmath0 values",
    "gives l@xmath49/l@xmath8 values at each spectral type for each line .",
    "these represent the average values of active field m dwarfs measured by sdss .",
    "figure [ fig : lbol ] shows the new activity relations , which represent the mean luminosity fractions of six different activity - tracing emission lines for thousands of active field m dwarfs .",
    "the relations suggest that the fraction of the bolometric luminosity that is produced in a given emission line increases monotonically with wavelength at all spectral types .",
    "in addition , the newly measured emission lines are consistent with the h@xmath6 study of @xcite that showed a constant value for l@xmath7/l@xmath8 for early - mid m types ( m0-m4 ) with a decrease occurring near spectral type @xmath5m5 .",
    "the l@xmath50/l@xmath8 relation shown here agrees with l@xmath50/l@xmath8 results for the h@xmath6 active m dwarfs from @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 values from whw04 provide a distance - independent way to compare the h@xmath6 activity of stars with different spectral types .",
    "we used a spectroscopic sample of nearby m dwarfs from @xcite and the @xcite templates to expand the @xmath0 values to include the h@xmath1 , h@xmath2 , h@xmath3 , h@xmath4 , h8 , caii k , and caii h emission lines .",
    "we fit analytic relations to all of the @xmath0 values ( including h@xmath6 ) as a function of spectral type and color ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 ) .",
    "the new @xmath0 values are useful for analyzing both past and future m dwarf data .",
    "magnetic activity can be easily quantified if studies include ew measurements ( measured using the continuum regions given in table [ tab : cont ] ) and either spectral types or colors .",
    "we show that the percentage of bolometric luminosity emitted in the optical emission lines of active - field m dwarfs increases monotonically with increasing wavelength .",
    "in addition , the emission line luminosities relative to the bolometric luminosities are constant in all measured lines for spectral types m0-m4 , and then decrease at later spectral types , in agreement with the h@xmath6 results in @xcite .",
    "the l@xmath50/l@xmath8 values are consistent with those measured for the h@xmath6 active stars from @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the h@xmath6 inactive templates of @xcite do not have a sufficient s / n at each spectral type to systematically compare the strength of the caii k emission lines in active and inactive stars .",
    "however , a caii k emission line is present in the m5 inactive template .",
    "the resulting mean l@xmath50/l@xmath8 for the inactive template is an order of magnitude lower than the ( h@xmath6 ) active template .",
    "our @xmath0 values have already proven useful in the rotation - activity analysis of @xcite by allowing l@xmath50/l@xmath8 and l@xmath51/l@xmath8 to be computed from echelle spectra .",
    "future improvements to our @xmath0 measurements can be made by creating a larger spectroscopic sample of nearby m dwarfs with good parallaxes .",
    "the advent of synoptic telescopes like pan - starrs , lsst and sim will measure parallaxes for thousands of m dwarfs , many of which will have sdss ( or other previously observed ) spectra .",
