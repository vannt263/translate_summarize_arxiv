    "motivated by the rich observational landscape of stellar magnetism and by our own sun s cycles of activity , we have undertaken 3d simulations of convection and dynamo action in solar type stars .",
    "these simulations have explored how global - scale flows of differential rotation and meridional circulation are established in rapidly rotating suns @xcite and how dynamo action might be realized in these stars .    in @xcite",
    "we studied dynamo action in a star rotating three times faster than our current sun and found that global - scale magnetic structures can arise naturally in the midst of the stellar convection zone .",
    "these wreaths of magnetism were stable for long periods of time , maintaining their identity for many thousands of days , and did not require a stably stratified tachocline to survive the turbulent convection .",
    "rather they coexisted with it .    in this paper",
    "we explore a convective dynamo simulation in a solar - like star rotating five times the current solar rate . here",
    ", global - scale magnetic wreaths still form in the convection zone but now they become time dependent and undergo repeated cycles of magnetic polarity reversal .",
    "these wreaths are significantly more complex than the steady wreaths discussed in .",
    "magnetism is a nearly ubiquitous feature of solar - type stars .",
    "young , rapidly rotating suns appear to have much stronger magnetic fields at their surfaces .",
    "observations reveal a clear correlation between rotation and magnetic activity , as inferred from proxies such as x - ray and chromospheric emission , but the observational landscape is complex with few other well - established trends to constrain dynamo models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a fundamental characteristic of the solar dynamo is its regular cycles of sunspots .",
    "indeed , the 22-year solar activity cycle stands out as one of the most remarkable and enigmatic examples of magnetic self - organization in nature .",
    "solar type stars appear to undergo magnetic cycles with periods ranging from several years to several decades .",
    "most observational investigations of stellar activity cycles rely on long - term monitoring of photospheric , chromospheric , or coronal emission using the sun as a baseline for calibration and comparison .",
    "photometric and spectroscopic variability are linked to magnetic activity and periodic modulation on time scales of years to decades is interpreted as an activity cycle .",
    "the most extensive such survey is still the mount wilson hk project which monitored chromospheric emission in 111 solar - type stars from 19661991 @xcite .",
    "about half of the stars in the sample ( 51 ) show clear signs of cyclic activity , including 21 with well - defined cycle periods ranging between 7 and 25 years .",
    "the remaining stars exhibit either irregular variability with no clear systematic variation ( 29 ) or smooth time series with flat or linear trends ( 31 ) .",
    "longer - term but more sporadic photometric measurements are available for a few dozen stars and these , along with the mount wilson data , show evidence for multiple periodicities and possible variations in the apparent starspot cycle periods over the course of multiple decades @xcite .",
    "more rapidly rotating stars generally have shorter cycles , but robust scaling relationships with stellar mass , rotation rate and other fundamental parameters have remained elusive .",
    "the shortest stellar activity cycles observed to date have periods of roughly 1 to 1.6 years , and occur in rapidly rotating f - type stars @xcite .",
    "the magnetic fields observed at the surfaces of late - type stars must arise from dynamo action in the stellar convection zones , as in the solar dynamo .",
    "self - organization in turbulent dynamos is intimately associated with helicity and shear . in many mean - field dynamo theories ,",
    "poloidal magnetic fields are built by turbulent correlations in the convection through what is known as an @xmath1-effect , and these correlations are enhanced if the flow is helical .",
    "rotation and stratification impart helicity , both kinetic and magnetic , and can also lead to large - scale shearing flows of differential rotation .",
    "global - scale shear promotes self - organization through a process known as the @xmath0-effect where mean toroidal fields are generated from poloidal fields .",
    "dynamos employing these two effects are known as @xmath1-@xmath0 dynamos , and these models form the basis of much of our theoretical understanding of cyclic dynamos is stars like the sun ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the central role of shear and helicity in establishing cyclic activity has been confirmed by global numerical simulations of convective dynamos .",
    "the first 3d magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations of convection in rotating spherical shells to exhibit cyclic behavior were explored in detail by @xcite .",
    "recent simulations of global convective dynamos have focused on rapidly - rotating boussinesq systems in deep convective shells , often in the context of planetary dynamos . here the magnetic field is often dominated by the axisymmetric dipole component and is typically either stable in time or undergoes chaotic reversals . in planetary dynamos , rapid rotation , deep shell geometries , and minimal density stratifications",

    "stellar convection occurs under quite different conditions .    in the solar convection zone ,",
    "density stratification is of fundamental importance and the rotational influence is moderate ( rossby number @xmath2 ) , giving rise to intricate , three - dimensional , highly turbulent convective structures spanning many spatial and temporal scales @xcite .",
    "dynamo simulations in this parameter regime produce complex magnetic topologies , with more than 95% of the magnetic energy in the fluctuating ( non - axisymmetric ) field components @xcite .",
    "mean magnetic fields are likewise complex , with multipolar structure and transient toroidal ribbons and sheets .",
    "polarity reversals of the dipole component occur but they are irregular in time .",
    "the presence of an overshoot region below the convection zone and a tachocline of rotational shear there promotes mean - field generation , producing persistent bands of toroidal flux antisymmetric about the equator while strengthening and stabilizing the dipole moment @xcite .",
    "however , these simulations did not exhibit systematic magnetic cycles .",
    "recent results by @xcite achieve both large - scale organization and cyclic reversals of polarity in a convection simulation with an underlying tachocline . in that simulation ,",
    "substantial mean magnetic fields are present in both the tachocline and the bulk of the convection zone .",
    "the simulation spans roughly 93,000 days ( 225  years ) with polarity reversals occurring on roughly 11,000 day ( 30  year ) periods .",
    "convective simulations in spherical wedge geometries with self - consistently established differential rotation profiles and imposed tachoclines also achieve organized fields in the convection zone and cyclic dynamo activity @xcite .",
    "interestingly , large - scale magnetic fields and organized polarity reversals have also been achieved in spherical geometries with helically forced flows , and involving neither global - scale differential rotation nor tachoclines @xcite .    here",
    "we explore convection and dynamo action in a rapidly rotating sun which spins five times faster than the current solar rate , calling this case  d5 .",
    "this dynamo builds globally organized fields but also undergoes quasi - regular reversals of magnetic polarity .",
    "this is achieved in the stellar convection zone itself ; a tachocline is not included in our simulation and thus can play no role .",

    "we study mhd stellar convection and dynamo action with the anelastic spherical harmonic ( ash ) code @xcite . our simulation approach is briefly described here , but the equations , implementation and nature of our study are explained in detail in @xcite .",
    "this global - scale code simulates a stratified spherical shell and here we focus on the bulk of the convection zone , with our computational domain extending from @xmath3 to @xmath4 ( with @xmath5 the solar radius ) and spanning about 172  mm in radius .",
    "we avoid regions near the stellar surface and also do not include the stably stratified region near the base of the convection known as the tachocline .",
    "the total density contrast across the shell is about 25 , with a stratification derived from a 1d solar structure model @xcite .",
    "as discussed in ( section  3.1 ) , we chose to simplify these calculations by omitting a tachocline of penetration and rotational shear , motivated also by the lack of observational evidence for tachoclines in rapidly rotating stars .",
    "we have explored some companion simulations that include a tachocline , and find that the wreath - building dynamics and their temporal behavior are largely unmodified by its presence .",
    "we will report on this in another paper .",
    "furthermore , recent mean - field models of the solar dynamo suggest that the latitudinal shear in the lower convection zone is primarily responsible for the generation of the mean toroidal field , as opposed to the radial shear in the tachocline .",
    "the role of a tachocline in establishing cyclic magnetic activity remains unclear .",

    "the dynamo simulation ( case  d5 ) was initiated from a mature hydrodynamic progenitor which had been evolved for more than 8000  days and was well equilibrated ( case  h5 ) .",
    "to initiate our dynamo case , a small seed dipole magnetic field was introduced and evolved via the induction equation .",
    "the energy in the magnetic fields is initially many orders of magnitude smaller than the energy contained in the convective motions , but these fields are amplified by shear and grow to become comparable in energy to the convective motions .",
    "our magnetic boundary conditions are a perfect conductor at the bottom of the convection zone and match onto an external potential field at the top .",
    "stellar dynamo simulations are computationally intensive , requiring both high resolutions to correctly represent the velocity fields and long time evolution to capture the equilibrated dynamo behavior , which may include cyclic variations on time scales of several years .",
    "the strong magnetic fields can produce rapidly moving alfvn waves which seriously restrict the courant - friedrichs - lewy ( cfl ) timestep limits in the upper portions of the convection zone .",
    "case  d5 , rotating five times faster than the current sun , has been evolved for over 17000 days ( or over 8 million timesteps ) . as a historical note , with the higher resolution of this simulation , this represents roughly a factor of a million more computation than was possible in @xcite , which is in surprisingly good agreement with moore s law doubling over the almost thirty year interval separating these simulations .",

    "there is little radial flow in these regions , as the strong differential rotation shears out the convective cells .",
    "this region is equatorward of the tangent cylinder , an imaginary boundary tangent to the base of the convection zone and aligned with the rotation axis . for rotating convective shells",

    "though there is some modulation with longitude in the equatorial roll amplitudes here , this modulation is less extreme in either case  d5 or h5 than in our previous rapidly rotating simulations of stellar convection ( e.g. , case  g5 in * ? ? ?",
    "this difference appears to be linked to our background stratification and feedbacks from thermal transport near the top of the domain .",
    "here we have attempted to reduce the region of influence of the unresolved sgs heat flux @xmath34 which carries flux out the top of the domain @xcite .",
    "this thinner thermal boundary has larger gradients and a steeper profile of the background entropy gradient @xmath35 and thus slightly higher rayleigh numbers and radial velocities .",

    "the equatorial acceleration is achieved by reynolds stresses and convective transport that redistribute angular momentum and entropy , and build prominent gradients in latitude of angular velocity and temperature .",
    "radial cuts of @xmath0 indicate that strong radial shear is present throughout the lower - latitudes ( figure  [ fig : case_d5_patterns]@xmath38 ) .",
    "this differential rotation is solar - like in the sense that there is a monotonic decrease of @xmath0 from the equator to the pole .",
    "generally , the profiles here of @xmath0 are more cylindrical than those deduced from helioseismology for the sun , but this is to be expected for more rapidly rotating stars .",
    "this may also be influenced by our omission of a tachocline . from studies of solar convection ,",
    "it is evident that the thermal structure of the tachocline with latitude influences the differential rotation profiles in the bulk of the convection zone .",
    "the main effect is to tilt the @xmath0 contours toward a more radial alignment @xcite .",

    "when the dipole and octupole are strong , we generally see wreaths that are antisymmetric about the equator .",
    "when the quadrupole becomes stronger ( e.g. , during the interval from roughly 700010000 days ) the dynamo typically exhibits toroidal fields that are symmetric about the equator .",
    "this indicates that the global - scale toroidal field is likely being produced by the stretching of global - scale poloidal field by the shear of differential rotation .",
    "the latitudinal propagation and orderly reversal of large - scale magnetic fields realized in case d5 constitute a striking finding of these simulations . here",
    "we examine how field propagation and reversal might arise , by examining the spatial and temporal dependence of some of the mechanisms that act to strengthen or weaken fields .    spatial propagation and field reversals",

    "the differential rotation remains fast and prograde , but with some modulation in time .",
    "prominent structures of speedup are visible propagating toward the poles at the high latitudes .",
    "these structures are much more evident when we subtract the time - averaged profile of @xmath0 for this period at each latitude ( figure  [ fig : case_d5_omega]@xmath23 ) .",

    "in contrast , in the south only two such bands are evident ; a third is perhaps launched around day 4500 , but it does not survive or propagate .    comparing these features with the propagation of magnetic fields shown in figures  [ fig : case_d5_reversal]@xmath21 and [ fig : d5 production]@xmath21 over the same interval , we find that velocity speedup features are well correlated with the poleward migration of mean longitudinal magnetic field . the velocity features bear some resemblance to the poleward branch of torsional oscillations observed in the solar convection zone over the course of a solar magnetic activity cycle , though on a much shorter time scale here as befits the correspondingly shorter time between magnetic polarity reversals in these dynamo simulations .",
    "the speedup bands propagate toward the poles relatively slowly . in a period of roughly 500 days they travel about @xmath156 in latitude , and this angular propagation rate of about @xmath157 or about @xmath158",
    "is roughly constant at all depths in the convection zone . at mid - convection zone ( @xmath159 )",
    "this corresponds to a distance of roughly 415  mm and a propagation velocity of about @xmath160 or about @xmath161 .",
    "near the base of the convection zone ( @xmath141 ) , this corresponds to a distance of about 355  mm and a propagation velocity of @xmath162 or about @xmath163 .",
    "this is considerably slower than the fluctuating latitudinal flows associated with the convection which at mid - convection zone have peak speeds of @xmath164 during this time period .",
    "the meridional circulations are more difficult to interpret . at mid - convection zone",
    "they can have instantaneous amplitudes of about @xmath165 , but the fluctuations are large and the time - averaged circulations are much slower ( @xmath166@xmath167 ) though they are poleward in sense at mid - latitudes . near the base of the convection zone the time - averaged circulations are weakly equatorward with amplitudes of about @xmath168 and thus act to resist the poleward propagation of the speedup bands and the magnetic wreaths .",
    "if we do moving 35-day time - averages of the meridional flows in the lower convection zone , we see some evidence for variations that track the speedup bands .",
    "in particular , the flow in the core of the wreathes tends to be poleward with an amplitude of up to @xmath169@xmath170 ( up to @xmath171 without smoothing ) .",
    "this poleward flow is likely induced by magnetic tension in the toroidal wreathes , analogous to the mechanism underlying the poleward slip instability . in the absence of rotation and convection ,",
    "the propagation speed associated with the polar slip instability is approximately given by the alfvn speed associated with the mean toroidal fields , @xmath172 in case d5 , the propagating toroidal features have an amplitude of @xmath173 @xmath118@xmath174  kg in the mid convection zone , implying an alfvn speed of about @xmath175@xmath176 .",

    "the much lower poleward flows in the wreathes may reflect the inhibiting influence of rotation @xcite and convective pumping .    in the lower convection zone",
    ", the slip - induced poleward flow must also operate against the background equatorward flow maintained by the convection ( fig .",
    "[ fig : case_d5_patterns]@xmath50 ) .",
    "this gives rise to a horizontal convergence of the meridional flow near the poleward edge of each wreath and an associated upward flow with an amplitude of about @xmath168 , consistent with mass conservation .",
    "this is analogous to the recirculating flows around shear - generated magnetic flux structures that rise due to magnetic buoyancy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the idealized polar slip instability ,",
    "the poleward propagation of toroidal bands is associated with the formation of prograde zonal flows as the fluid within the bands tends to conserve its angular momentum . by contrast , the wreathes in case d5 are not isolated flux structures , they have a leaky topology that allows plasma to escape .",
    "this will also influence the slip - induced propagation speed but it is likely to accelerate it rather than decelerate it because prograde zonal flows provide gyroscopic stabilization .",
    "the wreathes in case d5 do induce prograde zonal flow variations as they migrate poleward ( fig .",
    "[ fig : case_d5_omega ] ) , as expected from the polar slip instability .",
    "however , as we shall see in section  [ sec : amom transport ] , the zonal flow variations in case d5 are largely produced by the lorentz force , as opposed to the coriolis - induced flows associated with angular momentum conservation in closed flux structures .",
    "the important role of the mean lorentz force in accelerating the torsional oscillations ( section  [ sec : amom transport ] ) and the phasing of the @xmath0-effect relative to the wreathes ( section  [ sec : d5 production ] ) suggests that the poleward propagation of the torsional oscillations may be mainly attributed to a nonlinear dynamo wave .",
    "the phase speed of such a wave is governed primarily by the poloidal and toroidal source terms in the mean induction equation but it may also be linked to the alfvn speed associated with the mean latitudinal field .",
    "values of @xmath183 in the cores of the poleward propagating bands are roughly @xmath184@xmath118  kg in the mid convection zone , implying alfvn speeds of about @xmath119@xmath185 . near the base of the convection zone these values are larger , with mean latitudinal field strengths of @xmath174@xmath186  kg and alfvn speeds of @xmath187@xmath176 .    with the expanded sensitivity of figure  [ fig : case_d5_omega]@xmath23",

    "the velocity variations at the equator do not correspond with the equatorial propagating branch of torsional oscillations seen in the sun @xcite . in the sun ,",

    "these near - surface values of @xmath39 are reported in table  [ table : delta_omega ] , averaged over this entire period ( avg ) and at points in time when the contrast is large ( max , at day  3702 ) and small ( min , at day  4060 ) . from periods of highest contrast to lowest , @xmath44 changes by about 0.5  @xmath189 , which is a change of roughly 45% relative to the long running average .",
    "this corresponds to a total change of about 4% relative to the frame rotation rate of 13  @xmath189 ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "we now turn to discussing the transport of angular momentum associated with the speedup bands observed in case  d5 .",
    "the bands of speedup are clearly associated with the magnetic wreaths which are similarly propagating towards the poles , and here we examine the physical processes that lead to the angular momentum transport that locally speeds up the flow of differential rotation .",
    "our choice of stress - free and potential - field / perfectly conducting boundary conditions at the top and the bottom of the shell respectively has the advantage that no net external torque is applied and angular momentum is conserved .",
    "convection and magnetism can however redistribute angular momentum throughout the shell . in the general mhd case",
    "there are five processes that serve to transport angular momentum @xcite .",
    "these are the reynolds stresses from fluctuating flows ( which we denote @xmath190 ) , the meridional circulations ( @xmath191 ) , the viscous torque ( @xmath192 ) , the maxwell stresses from fluctuating fields ( @xmath193 ) , and the magnetic torque from the global - scale fields ( @xmath194 ) .",

    "these measurements are taken in the lower convection zone where the magnetic wreaths are strong ( at @xmath141 ) and as in @xcite we do not average these contributions in time but rather follow their time evolution with time - latitude plots . here",

    "we show only the northern hemisphere here , but dynamics in the southern hemisphere are similar .",
    "contours of angular velocity @xmath0 are superimposed on each panel to guide the eye .",
    "the transport of angular momentum is modulated and has significant polar branches that are strongly associated with the speedup bands . as the magnetic wreaths",
    "propagate poleward , they accelerate the local angular velocity .",
    "this is clearly seen in figure",
    "[ fig : d5 amom]@xmath21 , where the latitudinal shear is reduced with the retrograde ( blue ) regions disappearing as the prograde ( red ) bands migrate polewards .",
    "the acceleration of the high latitude region is largely due to the large - scale magnetic torque associated with the axisymmetric fields in the magnetic wreaths ( @xmath194 , figure  [ fig : d5 amom]@xmath86 ) .",
    "this magnetic torque traces the propagation of @xmath16 quite well .",
    "the negative ( positive ) sense of this term in the core of the wreaths in the northern ( southern ) hemisphere indicates that @xmath194 transports angular momentum toward the poles , thus accelerating flow in those retrograde regions .",

    "the reynolds stresses ( @xmath190 , figure  [ fig : d5 amom]@xmath23 ) generally act to transport angular momentum towards the equator but have amplitudes lower than either of the maxwell stresses . in this simulation angular momentum transport by viscous diffusion ( @xmath192 , figure  [ fig : d5 amom]@xmath38 ) plays very little role .",
    "the coriolis forces associated with the meridional circulations works in concert with the maxwell torques to spin up the flow in the wreaths ( @xmath191 , figure  [ fig : d5 amom]@xmath37 ) .",
    "this spinup largely arises from the poloidal flows associated with the wreaths themselves , rather than from the time - averaged meridional circulations , which are equatorward at this depth .",
    "before the speedup bands begin propagating towards the poles , @xmath191 is large and opposite in sense to @xmath194 , acting to transport angular momentum towards the equator . in the cores of the wreaths",
    "however , @xmath191 is converging , which acts to spinup the fluid within the wreaths .",
    "after the speedup bands have launched ( e.g. , at about day 3850 in the northern hemisphere ) , @xmath191  changes sense and acts to help maintain the prograde rotation in the speedup bands .",

    "these speedup bands appear to be accelerated primarily by magnetic torques arising from the global - scale axisymmetric magnetic fields , with an additional contribution arising from poloidal circulations associated with the propagating magnetic wreaths .",
    "the angular velocity contrast @xmath39 can vary by more than 45% during a reversal and these variations may represent changes of several percent relative to the rotating reference frame . as such , we may expect similar variations in observations of surface differential rotation on magnetically active stars during the course of a magnetic cycle .",
    "the bands of speedup bear some resemblance to the poleward branch of the torsional oscillations seen in observations of the sun over the course of a solar cycle @xcite . in these simulations",
    ", we do not see any evidence of the observed equatorial branch . in the sun ,",
    "the equatorial branch may arise from enhanced cooling in the magnetically active regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but those effects lie beyond the spatial resolution or physical effects included in our simulations of global - scale convection and dynamo action .",
    "these global - scale polarity reversals are not special to case  d5 .",
    "indeed , we have explored a broader class of oscillating dynamo solutions , which will be detailed in forthcoming papers .",
    "some of these solutions are realized by taking our more slowly rotating case  d3 ( ) to higher levels of turbulence by reducing the eddy diffusivities , while others are achieved in simulations spinning at even higher rotation rates than case  d5 .",
    "large oscillations in the magnetic fields and global - scale reversals of polarity appear to be common features in the parameter space we have explored , likely arising when the ohmic diffusivity on large scales is small enough to allow the dynamo waves to run polewards in these wreath - building dynamos .",
    "we find such global - scale oscillations and polarity reversals fascinating , since these are self - consistent 3d stellar dynamo simulations which achieve such temporally organized behavior in the bulk of the convection zone , without appealing to a stable tachocline of shear at the base of the convection zone as the organizational seat of the dynamo .",

    "<S> we find that the mean toroidal fields are built primarily through an @xmath0-effect , while the mean poloidal fields are built by turbulent correlations which are not necessarily well represented by a simple @xmath1-effect . during a reversal the magnetic wreaths propagate towards the polar regions , and this appears to arise from a poleward propagating dynamo wave . </S>",
