    "stellar atmospheric parameters are of fundamental importance in a plethora of astrophysical scenarios . on the one hand , effective temperature and surface gravity ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) and , to some extent , chemical composition allow , for instance , to properly locate stars in the hr diagram and therefore to better establish their evolutionary status and ages .",
    "this has been particularly true for segregating stars on the main sequence from evolved objects in the _ kepler _ field in a wide temperature range @xcite .",
    "they are also important in identifying solar analogues or twins that permit to place our sun into context of its neighbourhood @xcite .",
    "+ on the other hand , the stellar chemical composition turns out to be a primary criterion in the analysis of the chemical history of galaxies , including our milky way .",
    "global metallicity ( [ m / h ] ) provides , in the case of metal - poor stars , information on the early stages of galaxy evolution , before the rapid insertion of enriched yields through supernovae events shaped their observable chemical properties .",
    "less attention , however , was initially paid to the super metal - rich ( smr ) stars , in spite of having been defined more than four decades ago by @xcite as stars with metallicity higher than the hyades .",
    "this leading ( and controversial ) study and that of @xcite on the galactic bulge have for a long time served as the basis for investigations of metal - rich extragalactic populations , such as those found in elliptical galaxies and spheroidal components ( mainly bulges ) of spirals . in this work ,",
    "we adopt a threshold of + 0.16  dex for a star to be considered smr ; this value is slightly more conservative than the recent estimate of the average metallicity of the hyades ( [ fe / h]=0.13@xmath40.06  dex ) , reported by @xcite + more locally , smr stars have become particularly interesting objects in view of the well established correlation between the presence of giant exoplanets and the stellar metal content @xcite .",
    "such correlation indicates that the probablility of finding a giant planet significantly increases with increasing metallicity .",
    "it is now known that 25% of metal - rich nearby field stars harbor planets , while the prevalence is reduced to 3% if we consider solar abundances @xcite .",
    "the metallicity - planet correlation has posed interesting challenges to the current planet formation scenarios , since it appears to favour the core accretion model @xcite over the planetary formation as a result of disk instabilities @xcite .",
    "it has also motivated a number of studies in search for giant exoplanets in field stars as well as in metal - rich stellar clusters as ngc  6791 @xcite .",
    "+ to date , smr stars are attractive on both of the above scenarios , and studies in one field have been shared by the other .",
    "for instance , the construction of stellar databases as tools for the synthesis of stellar population have recently been incorporated in exoplanetary studies @xcite .",
    "conversely , stellar studies , aimed at finding fiducial targets for exoplanet searches and potential correlations between stellar host properties and the presence of substellar companions , have already impacted broader issues , as the chemical evolution of the milky way ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    ", we carried out a spectroscopic analysis of a sample of stars of spectral types g0g3 , luminosity class v , in the visual magnitude interval @xmath5 , that has been observed at moderate resolution ( fwhm  2.5   ) .",
    "we simultaneously derive the three leading atmospheric parameters ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 and [ m / h ] ) , through the study of their spectroscopic indices , and identify a new sample of smr stars as potential targets of planet searches .",
    "we selected in late 2008 a sample of stars from simbad database using the following criteria : _",
    "i ) _ spectral type between g0 and g3 ; _ ii ) _ luminosity class v ; _ iii ) _ visible magnitude @xmath0  @xmath115  mag ; and _ iv ) _ declination @xmath6 .",
    "the selection resulted in about 1200 objects .",
    "we report here the results for 233 stars .",
    "we carried out the spectroscopic observations at the 2.12 meter telescope of the observatorio astrofsico guillermo haro ( sonora , mexico ) between 2008 and 2013 , with a boller & chivens spectrograph , equipped with a versarray 1300@xmath71340 ccd .",
    "the grating of 600 l / mm and the slit width of 200  @xmath8 m provided a constant spectral resolution of 2.5    fwhm and a dispersion of 0.7    px@xmath9 along the wavelength range between about 3800 and 4800   . typically , we acquired 2 or more images for each star , with total exposure times between 3  min , for the brighter objects , and about 60  min for the fainter ones , to reach a signal - to - noise ratio per pixel ( s / n ) of 3080 , computed in a window of 100    around 4600   .",
    "the sample is presented in table  [ tab : samp ] , where we list the star identification , the @xmath0 magnitude and the spectral type as given in simbad . in fig .",
    "[ fig : vdist ] we show the distribution of the @xmath0 magnitude for the stars in our sample .",
    "in addition to the sample described above , we also observed a set of 29 _ reference _ stars from the pastel catalogue @xcite and complemented this sample with 35 objects from @xcite . the reference sample will serve to test the adequacy of theoretical spectra in a range of atmospheric parameters , as explained in sect .",

    "the main photospheric parameters ( see table  [ tab : refs ] ) of these objects were obtained by averaging only those pastel entries that provide the three parameters ( @xmath2,@xmath3,[m / h ] ) to minimize the effect of degeneracies .",

    "the stellar parameters ( t@xmath10 , @xmath11 , [ m / h ] ) of a sample of 233 stars with spectral types between g0v - g3v were determined through the comparison of a set of spectroscopic indices and those calculated from a segment of munari s library of synthetic spectra .",
    "this work provides the first spectroscopic determination of the stellar parameters for almost 70@xmath12 ( 213 ) of the stars in our sample .",
    "the results obtained are compatible with the expected values for the considered spectral types , and in general agreement with previous determinations . in particular the effective temperature of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we nevertheless find significant incosistencies with @xcite , particularly at the lower temperature edge ( @xmath135600  k ) .",
    "we identified a new sample of 20 smr stars plus two that were already known .",
    "the comparisons presented in sect .  [ sec : comp ] and that conducted with the solar spectrum gives us confidence that the smr stars found in this work indeed represent bona fide targets for future searches of giant exoplanets .",
    "additionally , the present sample and its planned extensions in number of objects and in wavelength converage will complement , for instance , the data set of @xcite and the fainter sample included in @xcite in the investigation of the chemical evolution of the galaxy .",
