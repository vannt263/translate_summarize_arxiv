    "the origin of the dark matter ( dm ) is one of the most earnest questions for scientists .",
    "a lot of candidates have been proposed , but it still remains an open question . a primordial black hole ( pbh )  @xcite is one of the dm candidates , which has been studied for a long time .",
    "pbhs are black holes which are theoretically suggested to be formed in the early universe , and distinguished from ordinary black holes which are believed to be formed from the collapse of stars",
    ".    the constraint on the abundance of pbhs has been basically obtained from the non - detection of them ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and recently , by the kepler telescope , all of the mass windows for pbhs to be a dominant component of dms would be closed and the possibility of pbh - dm scenario seems to be completely excluded if pbhs have a monochromatic mass function  @xcite . however , there remain theoretical uncertainty of constraints , the possibility such that the mass region of pbhs broadens widely , and so on .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the large scale clustering behavior of pbhs and discuss the possibility of pbh - dm scenario in a way independent of the pbh mass . here",
    ", we assume the case that pbhs are formed from the gravitational collapse of the radiational overdense regions , though there are several mechanisms for the pbh formation like a collapse of cosmic strings  @xcite and domain walls  @xcite , or bubble collisions  @xcite .    in the context of the structure formation",
    ", the large scale clustering of such collapsed objects as halos / galaxies , has been studied well .",
    "for example , bardeen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that the collapsed objects tend to be formed intensively in widely dense regions , in the peak - background split picture in which source density perturbations are divided into short- ( peak ) and long - wavelength ( background ) modes . in the case",
    "where the statistics of the initial primordial perturbations is gaussian , the large scale clustering of the collapsed objects could be related to the distribution of the underlying matter density field by introducing a constant _ scale - independent bias _ parameter . on the other hand , due to the existence of the non - gaussian feature in the statistics of the initial primordial perturbations",
    ", the bias parameter tends to have a scale - dependent component , which is known as _ scale - dependent bias _ , and this has been considered to be a powerful tool to hunt the primordial non - gaussianity and extensively studied ( see e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    with the object that pbhs are also collapsed objects , chisholm  @xcite considered the scale - independent bias of pbhs and concluded that though the bias factor is large in itself , the density perturbations of pbhs are hardly produced on much larger scales like observable scales of cosmic microwave backgrounds ( cmb ) temperature anisotropies .",
    "recent several papers  @xcite also agree with this result .",
    "this is simply because that pbhs are caused by the collapse of horizon scale overdensity , which are hardly affected by the super - horizon density fluctuations that has little causality with physics inside the horizon .    in this paper , based on these previous works",
    ", we consider the case where the statistics of the primordial curvature perturbation is almost gaussian , but with small non - gaussian component , and investigate the large scale clustering of the pbhs . as a non - gaussian component",
    ", we consider the so - called local - type non - gaussianity , which is known to give a strong scale - dependence in the halo bias .",
    "we find that if pbh is a dominant component of dm , the large scale clustering of the pbh can be detected as the matter isocurvature perturbations and excluded by cmb observations even in the case with small non - gaussianity .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ single source case ]",
    ", we briefly review the bias effect and calculate the matter isocurvature perturbations from biasing effect of pbh in the case where a single source causes both observed cmb temperature perturbations and pbh formation . in section  [ different source case ] , we discuss the other case where the source of pbh formation is different from that of cmb perturbations .",
    "section  [ conclusions ] is devoted to the conclusions .",
    "in this section we discuss the simplest case that the fluctuation of a certain single field causes both observed large scale cmb temperature perturbations and pbh formation .",
    "let us denote a primordial adiabatic curvature perturbation on the comoving slice as @xmath1 .",
    "although the amplitude of @xmath2 is known to be around @xmath3 on cmb scale , it could be large enough to produce pbhs on smaller scales , becoming blue - tilted  @xcite or having some bump on its power spectrum  @xcite .",
    "also we assume @xmath2 has a small local - type non - gaussianity which is represented as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a gaussian field . here , we do not mention the concrete pbh formation model where the generated adiabatic curvature perturbation has the above type of non - gaussianity .",
    "there have been several claims about the local - type non - gaussianity in single source case . according to maldacena  @xcite",
    ", there is a consistency relation between non - linearity parameter @xmath6 and the spectral tilt of the adiabatic curvature perturbations , and hence even in the simplest inflation model , namely single - field slow - roll inflation , the local - type non - gaussianity does not vanish and is @xmath7 . on the other hand , recently , some authors claimed that such a non - gaussianity given by the consistency relation is nothing but a gauge artifact and it does not contribute the scale - dependent bias  @xcite and this statement is based on the adiabaticity of the curvature perturbations .",
    "as for the pbh formation model , e.g. , in the bump cases , in order to grow up the curvature perturbations rapidly on the bump scale the adiabaticity would be violated and it would be possible to generate the curvature perturbations with non - zero local - type non - gaussianity . related issues in preheating model was discussed in ref .",
    "anyway we simply presume a small non - gaussianity @xmath8 here without any assumption of the concrete inflationary models .",
    "we will assume that pbh formation can be described by press - schechter approach  @xcite as in the standard structure formation .",
    "following the peak background split picture in the structure formation  @xcite , we discuss the large scale clustering of pbh .",
    "in other words , we will consider how the pbh number density in some region of scale @xmath9 will be modulated if that region is on some long - wavelength fluctuations whose scale @xmath10 is much larger than @xmath9 .",
    "anyway let us calculate the pbh density without the long - wavelength mode at first .",
    "we would like to note that using the peak background split picture is just for intuitive understanding how the non - gaussianity affects the large scale clustering of the biased objects such as halos , galaxies and pbhs . a clustering behavior of halos",
    "/ galaxies with the non - gaussian initial fluctuations has been also discussed by employing not only the peak - background split picture but also other analytic approach @xcite .",
    "there are also several literatures about numerical n - body simulation with the non - gaussian initial fluctuations and they are consistent with the analytic result ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    according to  @xcite , when the pbh formation is discussed , one should not use the curvature perturbations @xmath2 but take the density perturbations of the radiation on the comoving slice @xmath11 .",
    "the fourier transformed component of such density perturbations of the radiation is obtained from the poisson equation and it becomes  @xcite @xmath12 on super - horizon scale . following the press - schechter approach , we consider the density perturbations coarse - grained on pbh - formation scale . with some window function @xmath13 , we define the coarse - grained density perturbations as @xmath14 where @xmath15 @xmath16 is the coarse - graining scale , and almost the same as the horizon scale at the pbh - formation time @xmath17 since the overdensity will collapse soon after entering the horizon .",
    "note that @xmath9 should be much larger than @xmath16 .    in the press - schechter approach ,",
    "the overdensity such that @xmath18 exceeds a certain threshold @xmath19 is assumed to collapse to be pbhs .",
    "has the non - gaussianity , the dynamics of collapse after the overdensity enters the horizon may also vary",
    ". therefore we may not be able to say sweepingly the overdensity such that @xmath20 will collapse ( for instance , nakama _ et al . _",
    "@xcite analyzed the development of overdensities of generalized curvature profile beyond the gaussian one and proposed two crucial parameters as thresholds of pbh formation . ) .",
    "however those effects are beyond the scope of this paper , and we just follow the standard press - schechter approach . ] therefore , assuming the statistics of @xmath21 is also nearly gaussian , is considered in  @xcite for example .",
    "however such an effect to the scale - dependent bias is the second order quantity w.r.t . @xmath6",
    "@xcite , and therefore it can be neglected safely . moreover , in appendix [ chi - squared type ] , it is suggested that the part of bias factor without @xmath6 is not so different even if the non - gaussian profile effect is taken into account as long as the pbh abundance is fixed .",
    "] the probability of pbh formation is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the standard deviation of @xmath21 averaged in the region @xmath9 : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the volume of the region @xmath9 .",
    "we have included conventional factor 2 of press - schechter formulation .",
    "also we have assumed a high peak limit as @xmath27 , because pbhs should be rare objects .",
    "then we will consider how this probability will be modulated under the existence of long - wavelength modes .    with the long - wavelength mode , the two quantities @xmath19 and",
    "@xmath24 seem to be able to be modified .",
    "however , in the integral of eq .",
    "( [ def of variance ] ) , the factor @xmath28 in @xmath29 cuts off the long - wavelength modes of @xmath2 and @xmath24 is determined only by the short - wavelength modes as @xmath30 with the power spectrum @xmath31 .",
    "here we have replaced @xmath32 by @xmath33 for sufficiently large @xmath34 and @xmath35 compared to @xmath36 . if @xmath2 is completely gaussian and there is no modal coupling between long- and short - wavelength modes , it does not affected by long modes at all . on the other hand , the threshold @xmath19 is simply reduced to @xmath37 if the region @xmath9 is on the long - wavelength density perturbation @xmath38 ( see fig .",
    "[ bias image ] ) .",
    "therefore the pbh density in that region will be slightly larger as @xmath39 here we have used a high peak limit @xmath27 again .",
    "the spatial label @xmath40 denotes the coarse - grained position of the region @xmath9 .",
    "this coefficient @xmath41 is called _ scale - independent bias_.     and dark blue points show the regions which will be pbhs . in the first ( top ) figure , it can be seen that the threshold for the short - wavelength mode @xmath21 is effectively reduced to @xmath37 .",
    "therefore pbhs tend to be formed in @xmath42 region , and this effect is called the scale - independent bias .",

    "however , although a biasing factor @xmath49 is larger than order of unity , @xmath47 is actually much smaller than @xmath2 on the cmb scale .",
    "this is because the cmb scale @xmath50 is quite larger than the pbh scale @xmath51 , namely @xmath52 , and then @xmath47 is strongly suppressed as @xmath53 . indeed ,",
    "this result is consistent with the claims of @xcite .",
    "however , it will be dramatically changed if we consider the effect of non - gaussianity , namely the scale - dependent bias  @xcite .    if the primordial perturbations have local - type non - gaussianity as given in eq .",
    "( [ local - type non - gaussianity ] ) , there is a correlation between short- and long - wavelength perturbations as shown later .",
    "therefore the long - wavelength density perturbation @xmath38 not only reduces the threshold effectively but also modifies the variance of short - wavelength perturbations , @xmath24 .",
    "thus the bias parameter @xmath54 has the other component @xmath55 which is called _ scale - dependent bias_. then let us evaluate this bias effect .    from eq .",

    "@xmath64 denotes the variance of @xmath21 averaged over the whole universe , namely @xmath65 .",
    "hence , with an approximation @xmath66 , the fourier mode of the dependence of @xmath24 to @xmath38 on large scale is given by @xmath67 where , @xmath68 on the other hand , since @xmath69 is the function only of @xmath70 , we can obtain the following relation with use of the definition of @xmath71 .",
    "@xmath72 from the above results , the scale - dependent bias is given by @xmath73 it is noteworthy that @xmath74 has a factor of @xmath75 . since this factor cancels out @xmath44 in @xmath21 , @xmath76 with the scale - dependent bias is not negligible compared to the adiabatic curvature perturbation @xmath1 even on much larger scales",
    "this is because the scale - dependent bias is directly proportional to @xmath2 via the non - gaussianity , while the scale - independent bias is proportional to @xmath11 .",
    "gravitational collapse is irreversible process and potentially accompanied by entropy production .",
    "furthermore , especially in the case of pbh formation , the equation of state of the density component changes from the radiation to the matter , and therefore the density perturbations of pbhs can bring about easily - detectable entropic ( or isocurvature ) perturbations . in this section",
    "we will calculate the specific value of the isocurvature perturbations .",

    "this is a main result of this paper .",
    "furthermore , we have also considered the case that pbh is a subdominant component of dms .",
    "we have plotted the upper limit of the pbh fraction in such a case to satisfy the isocurvature constraints  ( [ original isocurvature constraint ] ) in fig .",

    "in the case where the source fluctuation of pbh formation is different from that of cmb fluctuations , the above discussion does not change so much .",
    "let @xmath2 and @xmath116 denote the curvature perturbations which respectively induce the cmb fluctuations and the pbh formation .",
    "in other words , @xmath2 is dominant and has a nearly flat spectrum on cmb scale , while @xmath116 dominates on much smaller scale .",

    "note that in this case the correlation between adiabatic curvature perturbations and generated isocurvature perturbations is much suppressed , that is , almost uncorrelated - type isocurvature perturbations .",
    "the constraint for the uncorrelated isocurvature perturbations shown by planck collaboration is  @xcite @xmath121 at @xmath93 cl . and",
    "therefore the constraint for @xmath122 is weakened up to @xmath123 furthermore , @xmath116 is not necessarily almost gaussian but possibly quite non - gaussian .",
    "accordingly , we also discuss the chi - squared case in appendix  [ chi - squared type ] as a simple example .",
    "in this paper , we consider the clustering of the pbhs on cmb scale produced by the bias effect .",
    "since there is a great gap between cmb scale and the horizon scale at the time of pbh formation during the radiation dominant phase , the distribution of pbh is hardly biased basically . however ,",
    "if the curvature perturbation field which cause pbhs has a local - type non - gaussianity , even if it is small , we have showed non - negligible spatial fluctuations of pbh number density can be produced on cmb scale because the source field has a correlation between large and small scale via the non - gaussianity .",
    "specifically , the fluctuation of the number density of pbh is biased from the source curvature perturbation roughly by the factor of non - linearity parameter @xmath6 times @xmath124 , where @xmath69 is the pbh production probability which is commonly represented as @xmath125 in the literature . if dms consist of pbhs , these extra density perturbations on cmb scale can be detected as the matter isocurvature perturbation and are constrained strictly by cmb observations .",
    "we have showed , if the source curvature perturbation of pbhs also cause cmb temperature fluctuations , the pbh - dm scenario is excluded even with quite small non - linearity parameter @xmath110 . on the other hand , in the case",
    "that the source curvature perturbation of pbhs @xmath116 is different from that of cmb fluctuations @xmath2 , we can avoid the isocurvature constraints if @xmath116 is sub - dominant enough on cmb scale .",
    "even such a case , the pbh - dm scenario should satisfy @xmath126 .",
    "these constraints are almost independent of the pbh mass , and moreover they may not change a lot even if the pbh - mass spectrum is quite non - monochromatic unlike many other constraints .",
    "this is because even if the isocurvature perturbations of each mass range are small enough , they will be piled up and the total amplitude of them will be determined only by @xmath6 and @xmath127 , hardly affected by the shape of mass function .",

    "<S> primordial black holes ( pbhs ) are theoretical black holes which can be formed during the radiation dominant era through the gravitational collapse of radiational overdensities . </S>",
    "<S> it has been well known that in the context of the structure formation in our universe such collapsed objects , e.g. , halos / galaxies , could be considered as bias tracers of underlying matter fluctuations and the halo / galaxy bias has been studied well . applying such a biased tracer picture to pbh , we investigate the large scale clustering of pbh and obtain an almost mass - independent constraint to the scenario that the dark matter ( dm ) consists of pbh . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the case where the statistics of the primordial curvature perturbations is almost gaussian , but with small local - type non - gaussianity . </S>",
    "<S> if pbhs account for the dm abundance , such a large scale clustering of pbhs behaves as nothing but the matter isocurvature perturbation which is strictly constrained by the observations of cosmic microwave backgrounds ( cmbs ) . from this constraint , we show that , in the case where a certain single field causes both cmb temperature perturbations and pbh formation , the pbh - dm scenario is excluded even with quite small local - type non - gaussianity , @xmath0 . </S>"
