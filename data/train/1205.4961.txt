    "ross and mazur @xcite analyzed the bimolecular chemical reaction @xmath8 and extracted general expressions for the forward and reverse reaction rates and the entropy production from the boltzmann equation .",
    "the distribution function was not determined explicitly from the boltzmann equation so that no exact expressions for the reaction rates and entropy production were derived .",
    "the solution of the boltzmann equation for the distribution function from the expansion of the distribution function in sonine polynomials and computation of the forward and reverse reaction rate were presented later by present @xcite and by shizgal and karplus @xcite .",

    "another important issue in applications of the chapman - enskog to the reactive boltzmann equation is the distortion of the maxwellian distribution functions by the reaction heat @xcite , which makes the reaction rate coefficients sensitive to the reaction heat .",

    "the reaction rates in the former case are larger than those in the latter , an indication that more reactions occur in the former case , due to the fact than even grazing collisions with translational energy larger than the activation energy lead to chemical reactions . in the same figures",
    "we also plot the influence of the departures from the maxwellian distribution functions on the reaction rate coefficients .",
    "the left and the right panels show that the non - maxwellian distribution functions reduce the reaction rate coefficients and that the forward reaction rate coefficient is less reduced than the reverse reaction one .",

    "in view of the law of mass action @xmath153 , which shows that , in equilibrium , the forward and the reverse reactions occur with the same probability , the affinity  ( [ a4 ] ) becomes @xmath154 so that the entropy production rate  ( [ za ] ) can be written as @xmath155    as one would expect , the entropy production rate is positive semi - definitethanks to the inequality @xmath156 which is valid for all @xmath157 , the equality being valid for @xmath158 .",

    "we have used the boltzmann equation to analyze a bimolecular chemical reaction in its initial stage . as an illustration , we computed the reaction rates and the entropy production rate for the typical bimolecular reaction @xmath9 . to solve the boltzmann equation by the chapman - enskog method",
    "we have expanded the distribution function in sonine polynomials up to the second order .",
    "our reactive differential cross section allows a reaction to occur only when the relative translational energy in the direction of the line of centers which joins the centers of the molecules is greater than the activation energy . with this cross section",
    "the calculated reaction rates are substantially smaller than those obtained from the line - of - centers model , which requires the relative translational energy to be larger than the activation energy .",
