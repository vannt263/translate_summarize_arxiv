    "disparate astronomical observations provide compelling evidence for additional , non - luminous matter , or dark matter , in gravitational interactions .",
    "the evidence includes the persistence of the galactic rotation curves to distances for which little luminous matter is present  @xcite , the relative strength and shape of the galaxy - distribution power spectrum at large wave numbers  @xcite , and the pattern of acoustic oscillations in the power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background  @xcite . the cosmological evidence , in aggregrate , points to the assessment that dark matter comprises some twenty - three percent of the energy density of the universe , with a precision of a few percent  @xcite .",
    "yet we know little about the nature of dark matter  we do not know its mass , its quantum numbers , or even with surety that it is indeed composed of isolated elementary particles . a recent gravitational lensing study does disfavor a modification of gravity in explanation of its effects  @xcite : we shall assume  @xcite that dark matter exists and is matter .",
    "we do know other things about dark matter  @xcite ; namely , that it is not hot  @xcite , and that it appears to lack both electric and color charge  @xcite .",
    "here we use temperature , i.e. , whether dark matter is `` cold '' or `` hot , '' to connote whether dark matter is non - relativistic or relativistic , respectively , at the redshift at which it decouples from matter in the cooling early universe . for so - called thermal relics ,",
    "this criterion selects the mass of the dark candidate as well , so that colder particles are heavier .",
    "however , alternative production scenarios can exist , and very light particles can also act as cold dark matter , as in the case of the axion  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , model - dependent constraints do exist on the mass of the candidate particle , and we consider them in sec .",
    "[ masslimit ] .",
    "the evidence for dark matter emerges from astrophysical observations of gravitational interactions , but establishing its couplings to standard model ( sm ) particles has proven elusive .",
    "nevertheless , such a quest is of great import , for it is through such means that its mass and quantum numbers can ultimately be determined .",
    "indeed all direct and indirect means of detecting dark matter rely on the notion that it does indeed experience weak or electromagnetic interactions to some degree . turning to the known particles of the sm for guidance ,",
    "the neutron shows us that a particle can have both a vanishing electric charge and a significant magnetic moment .",
    "thus we wish to constrain the possibility that dark matter has a small electromagnetic coupling , via its magnetic moment .",
    "we review the existing constraints on this possibility in sec .",
    "[ mulimit ] .",
    "in this paper we consider a new technique for the direct detection of dark matter , namely , through use of the gyromagnetic faraday effect  @xcite . alternatively",
    ", this effect can be used to limit a possible magnetic moment @xmath0 of a dark - matter particle of mass @xmath1 .",
    "let us consider how this could work .",
    "an electrically neutral medium of particles which possesses a net magnetization in an external magnetic field is circularly birefringent , even if the medium is isotropic .",
    "this implies that the propagation speed of light in the medium depends on the state of its circular polarization , so that light prepared in a state of linear polarization will suffer a rotation of the plane of that polarization upon transmission through the medium  @xcite , as long as it does not travel at right angles to the external magnetic field .",
    "we term this the gyromagnetic faraday effect , after ref .",
    "note that we need not rely on any existing magnetization of the dark matter in order to realize an effect .",
    "rather we imagine a faraday rotation experiment mounted in a region with a large external magnetic induction @xmath2 and dark matter of spin @xmath3 incident on it in the direction of @xmath2 .",
    "if the value of @xmath4 is larger than the dark matter particle s kinetic energy in the earth s rest frame , then the field region acts as a spin - filter , or longitudinal stern - gerlach , device  at least the highest energy spin configuration can not enter the field region .",
    "this technique is used to polarize ultra - cold neutrons ( ucns ) in the ucna experiment at los alamos with near 100% efficiency  @xcite .",
    "thus , viewed in the earth s rest frame , the dark matter which sweeps through the field region can possess a net magnetization .",
    "if light transits this medium in the direction of the magnetic field , and if we define @xmath5 to be the wave number for states with right- ( @xmath6 ) or left - handed ( @xmath7 ) circular polarization , then the rotation linearly polarized light suffers in its transit through the medium is given by the angle @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the length of transmission through the medium .",
    "if @xmath10 is non - zero once all systematic effects which could mimic the signal are excluded , we have evidence for dark matter with a non - zero magnetic moment .",
    "the direct detection of dark matter with a magnetic moment could be realized in a variety of ways .",
    "for example , one could search for anomalous recoil events in scattering from nuclei , in just the manner one searches for spin - independent and spin - dependent dark matter - nucleon interactions  @xcite . indeed",
    ", an experimental signal of the latter , from the dama experiment  @xcite , has been interpreted as a limit on a putative dark - matter magnetic moment , namely of @xmath11 for a dark matter candidate of 100 gev in mass  @xcite . in such experiments , however , the light dark - matter candidates we discuss give rise to momentum transfers which are much too small to be detected , even if the channeling effect proposed by ref .",
    "@xcite and studied in ref .",
    "@xcite is operative for the events studied in the dama / libra nai detector  @xcite  note ref .",
    "@xcite for further discussion .",
    "alternatively , a dark matter magnetic moment can be found through either nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) or faraday rotation studies .",
    "a nmr signal is typically realized through the detected change in magnetic field incurred through a spin - flip transition of the magnetic - moment - carrying particle , induced by an applied radio frequency .",
    "however , very small magnetic fields are more efficiently discovered through magnetoptical studies  @xcite .",
    "thus we focus on the use of faraday rotation to detect dark matter .",
    "precision optical rotation studies have also been conducted in which the external magnetic field is oriented at right angles to the direction of the propagating light , to the end , e.g. , of testing the optical birefringence of the vacuum , or , alternatively , of limiting the photon - axion coupling  @xcite .",
    "such an experimental configuration does not support a nonzero faraday effect , yet the empirical parameters used in these studies are useful to us , for we employ them to estimate the limit on the magnetic moment as a function of mass in the set - up we consider .",
    "a great variety of dark matter candidates , consistent with the various astrophysical constraints , exist in the literature  @xcite .",
    "indeed , their masses vary from some @xmath12 to @xmath13 gev , and their interaction cross sections  with nucleons  vary over orders of magnitude as well .",
    "typical direct detection strategies rely on the observation of `` anomalous '' nuclear recoils  @xcite , so that their sensitivity is typically to candidates of @xmath14(100 gev ) in mass scale .",
    "the experiment we suggest is sensitive to a completely different window in parameter space  to dark - matter candidates of crudely @xmath14(1 mev ) or less in mass .",
    "although constraints can be set through cosmological studies  @xcite , terrestrial studies are amenable to better control , for the existence of cosmological magnetic fields have not yet been established  @xcite .",
    "let us conclude our introduction by outlining the sections to follow .",
    "we begin by describing , in secs .",
    "[ masslimit ] and [ mulimit ] , respectively , the mass and magnetic moment constraints which exist on a light dark - matter candidate with a non - zero magnetic moment .",
    "we then proceed to review the gyromagnetic faraday effect in sec .",
    "[ faraday ] and to describe in concrete terms the experimental limits on @xmath0 one might possibly attain in sec .",
    "[ setup ] .",
    "we conclude with a summary in sec .",
    "in standard big - bang cosmology , the nature of dark matter impacts the formation of the large - scale structure of the universe .",
    "in particular , if dark matter is cold and collisionless , then galaxy formation proceeds via a hierarchial clustering , namely , from the merging of small protogalactic clumps , on ever larger scales  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , if dark matter is hot , the hierarchy is inverted , so that large protogalactic disks form first , which then clump  @xcite .",
    "galaxies , however , are observed at much larger redshifts than such simulations predict  @xcite .",
    "moreover , observations of particular classes of quasar absorption lines , the so - called damped lyman-@xmath15 systems , thought to be the evolutionary progenitors of galaxies today , also favor the former scenario  @xcite .",
    "it has also been argued that hot dark matter , i.e. , most notably , light , massive neutrinos , can not explain the galactic rotation curves  @xcite .",
    "however , the cold - dark - matter paradigm does have difficulties in confronting small - scale structure ; it yields , in effect , too much clumpiness below the mpc scale .",
    "warm dark matter has been advocated as a way to alleviate these difficulties  @xcite .",
    "limits on the mass of warm dark matter emerge from the comparison of the observations of the lyman-@xmath15 absorption spectrum with numerical simulations  @xcite ; the limits depend on the particle considered , and the manner in which it is produced  @xcite , yielding  @xcite , at 2@xmath16 , @xmath17 kev for a thermal relic and @xmath18 kev for a massive sterile neutrino  @xcite .",
    "cosmological constraints also exist on the mass of a dark - matter particle .",
    "if the particles annihilate via the weak interaction , then @xmath19 is parametrically set by @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the fermi constant , @xmath22 is a dimensionless factor , and we assume @xmath23 . in this case avoiding a dark - matter abundance in excess of the observed relic density bounds @xmath1 from below . indeed , under these conditions the mass of the cold dark - matter particle must exceed @xmath24 to avoid closing the universe  @xcite .",
    "the resulting lower bound on @xmath1 can be relaxed in different ways .",
    "feng and kumar  @xcite , e.g. , have emphasized that the appearance of @xmath21 in @xmath19 is simply parametric , that @xmath21 can be replaced with @xmath25 , and that the effective coupling @xmath25 can be small without having the precise numerical value of @xmath21 .",
    "thus if @xmath26 , the bound on @xmath1 is weakened . indeed , such considerations permit dark matter candidates which confront the relic density and big - bang nucleosynthesis constraints successfully but yet range from the kev to the tev scale in mass  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we consider what empirical constraints can be placed on the magnetic moment of a dark matter particle .",
    "this hypothesis gives rise to a new annihilation mechanism , though both a dark matter particle and its antiparticle must be present to realize it .",
    "we recall that particles with magnetic moments are invariably described by complex field representations , so that such a particle and its anti - particle are physically distinct  by the cpt theorem we expect the magnetic moments of such particles to differ only in sign .",
    "if the particle - antiparticle annihilation is mediated by a magnetic moment interaction , then @xmath19 is parametrically set by @xmath27 with @xmath28 a dimensionless parameter , as long as @xmath29 , the electron mass .",
    "the annihilation of still lighter mass dark matter candidates follows a different parametric form .",
    "that is , if the particles annihilate to standard model particles , then @xmath19 is suppressed by higher powers of the coupling constant  at least .",
    "alternatively , if they annihilate to `` secluded '' dark matter particles , note , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite , then @xmath19 is of form @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the electromagnetic coupling of the secluded particles and @xmath28 is a dimensionless parameter .",
    "generally , we expect the magnetic moment @xmath0 to be of form @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the anomalous magnetic moment , so that @xmath19 scales as @xmath34 .",
    "the presence of an additional annihilation mechanism should make the light dark matter candidates we consider , of @xmath35 scale in mass , say , decouple as matter and not radiation , so that constraints on the number of relativistic degrees of freedom during the epoch of big - bang nucleosynthesis also do not apply .",
    "this new annihilation mechanism becomes more effective as the candidate mass grows lighter .",
    "nevertheless it is still possible to saturate the dark - matter density with such a candidate particle , for the efficacy of the annihilation process can be mitigated by a particle - antiparticle excess  @xcite .",
    "thus the dark matter relic density need not bound the magnetic moment from above .",
    "moreover , we emphasize that dark matter could have multiple components , so that an upper bound on the magnetic moment could also be evaded by diluting the magnetic - moment - carrying particle with other sorts of dark matter .",
    "we shall assume these various annihilation mechanisms are effective enough to permit dark matter candidates as light as @xmath36 in mass .",
    "the intensity and morphology of galactic positron emission , as studied by the integral satellite  @xcite , has prompted much discussion of dark matter candidates with electromagnetic interactions  @xcite , which are of @xmath14(1 mev ) scale in mass , as well as of other possibilities , as , e.g. , in refs .",
    "if the pattern of the integral spectra are indeed explained by dark matter , then additional constraints follow on its nature .",
    "for example  @xcite , observational constraints on the diffuse photon flux also impose limits on the mass of the dark - matter candidate @xmath37 through internal bremsstrahlung corrections to the annihilation process @xmath38 .",
    "such constraints apply to our scenario as well ; the upshot is that the dark particle s mass is limited to be less than a few mev  @xcite . in our case",
    "internal bremsstrahlung contributions can also be generated by the magnetic - moment - carrying particle .",
    "however , we note that soft photon emission via a m1 transition of an isolated magnetic dipole is slow compared to the rate set by the inverse age of the universe , as we discuss in greater detail in sec .",
    "[ faraday ] , so that no meaningful limit follows on its magnetic moment . in what follows",
    "we consider candidate particles which range from @xmath14(1 kev ) to @xmath14(100 mev ) in mass , though our limits are most effective at sub - mev mass scales .",
    "various constraints on the magnetic moment of a dark - matter particle for masses in excess of @xmath39 mev have been considered in ref .",
    "we review these and more , in order to provide a context for the direct detection experiment we suggest . in the mass window of interest to us , two experimental constraints are important  one comes from precision electroweak measurements  @xcite , and the other comes from low - energy @xmath40 collider data , namely from the process @xmath41  @xcite .",
    "this last constrains the magnetic moment of the invisible particle directly and thus offers a constraint on a dark - matter magnetic moment as well .",
    "the authors of these studies use data at center - of - mass energies sufficient to produce a @xmath42 pair , given accelerator constraints on its mass  @xcite  this easily includes our mass range of interest . interpreting their results as a limit on the anomalous magnetic moment of the tau neutrino , the low - energy analyses conclude @xmath43 at 90% cl  @xcite , and @xmath44 at 90% cl  @xcite from distinct data sets",
    ". a more severe limit on the @xmath45 magnetic moment does exist  @xcite ; however , the nature of the @xmath46 limits allows us to interpret them in a manner useful to our current study . for a discussion of how low - energy @xmath40 collider data can probe particular mev dark matter models  @xcite , see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "precision electroweak measurements also constrain the magnetic moment  @xcite .",
    "the quantity @xmath47 captures radiative corrections to the relationship between the fine - structure constant @xmath15 , the fermi constant @xmath21 , and the @xmath48 and @xmath49 masses , @xmath50 and @xmath51  @xcite .",
    "the difference between the empirically determined value of @xmath47 and that computed in the standard model provides a window @xmath52 to which a dark - matter particle can contribute .",

    "@xcite , we assume @xmath52 is given by the vacuum polarization correction to the photon self - energy from a dark - matter particle with a magnetic moment , with no other adjustments .",
    "we choose to study the quantity @xmath47 as its uncertainty is dominated by that in the running of @xmath15  @xcite .",

    "a variety of astrophysical constraints exist on the magnetic moment of the neutrino , and they can be adapted to our current case as well .",
    "they emerge , in particular , from the impact of the additional cooling mechanism such would render on stellar evolution and lifetimes and on supernovae  @xcite .",
    "an additional , albeit somewhat weaker , constraint comes from confronting element abundances with the predictions of big - bang nucleosynthesis , to yield , e.g. , @xmath73  @xcite .",
    "these constraints can be significantly weakened by the candidate particle s mass  @xcite ; the ability to produce particles of @xmath74 in mass and more in plasma at stellar temperatures is limited . in the case of big - bang nucleosynthesis , the constraints on the magnetic moment of a massive tau neutrino are also weakened , though values as large as @xmath75 are nevertheless excluded  @xcite .",
    "the constraints we have considered in this section can be weakened by other means as well .",
    "since they arise from the effects of particle production , the most economical mechanism is compositeness ; to include this , we need only include a form factor at each electromagnetic vertex . thus we replace @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the compositeness scale , in our earlier formulae .",
    "thus for @xmath71 our earlier bound of @xmath72  @xcite from @xmath47 relaxes to @xmath78 if @xmath79 gev . in this scenario , however , the electrically charged constituents may well give rise to other observable effects .",
    "one possibility which avoids this would be to give a known charged particle , such as an electron , a small hidden sector interaction , so that it can help constitute dark matter , though its contribution to @xmath47 has already been taken into account .",
    "we proceed to consider the manner in which direct constraints can be set on @xmath0 .",
    "a medium of free electric charges in an external magnetic field is circularly birefringent and gives rise to a faraday effect  @xcite , as long as the light doe not propagate at right angles to the magnetic field .",
    "this effect has long been used in radio astronomy to study the properties of the interstellar medium  @xcite .",
    "a faraday effect can also arise in an electrically neutral medium in an external magnetic field , if the constituents carry magnetic moments and if they are aligned by that magnetic field to give the medium some net magnetization  @xcite .",
    "we consider the latter possibility exclusively .",
    "to derive the gyromagnetic faraday effect , we apply a magnetic induction @xmath2 in a magnetizable medium with circularly polarized electromagnetic waves propagating parallel to it .",
    "the external field induces a magnetization @xmath80 , i.e. , a net magnetic moment / volume , where @xmath81 and @xmath82 results from @xmath2 alone .",
    "the total magnetization of a medium at rest in the laboratory frame obeys the larmor precession formula @xmath83 so that @xmath84 , noting @xmath85 with @xmath86 for a particle of mass @xmath1 , is the gyromagnetic ratio of the magnetic - moment - carrying particle .",
    "we note @xmath87 , where @xmath3 is the spin of the particle .",
    "the gyromagnetic faraday effect was first derived for a ferromagnetic material  @xcite , for which use of the magnetic field @xmath88 is appropriate .",
    "since dark matter is only weakly self - interacting at most , our hypothesized dark matter should be treated as a paramagnetic material  so that we employ the magnetic induction @xmath89 throughout , though the use of @xmath88 is also commonplace  @xcite .",
    "corrections to the larmor formula result if the medium s particles move at a significant fraction of the speed of light , or if the particles possess a non - zero electric dipole moment  @xcite .",
    "we shall neglect the latter possibility and , moreover , shall consider dark - matter candidates for which relativistic effects are ultimately small corrections .    to determine the relativistic corrections to eq .",
    "( [ larmor ] ) , we first construct the covariant classical equation of motion for a single spin in homogeneous electromagnetic fields .",
    "this is germane as we can and indeed do neglect the mutual interactions of the dark - matter particles , so that the magnetization is given by the quantum - mechanical expectation value of the spin operator for a single particle times the number density ; and the time evolution of the expectation value is itself described by that of the associated classical equation of motion .",
    "the latter , for a charged particle with a spin , is given by the bargmann - michel - telegdi equation  @xcite .",
    "we can not use this result directly because no forces act on electrically neutral particles in homogeneous electromagnetic fields , so that no thomas precession term is present  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , well - known treatments  @xcite can be readily adapted to this case .",
    "requiring @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the 4-velocity of the particle in the laboratory frame and @xmath92 is its spin , namely @xmath93 , we find that @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the field - strength tensor in si units and @xmath96 is the proper time of the particle .",
    "thus in the laboratory frame the magnetization evolves as @xmath97 where we emphasize @xmath98 is the lorentz factor , namely @xmath99 .",
    "to proceed , we separate @xmath100 and @xmath101 as @xmath102 and @xmath103 , so that @xmath82 results exclusively from the external electromagnetic fields @xmath2 and @xmath104 .",
    "working to leading order in the small quantities @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 , which arise in the presence of electromagnetic radiation , we have @xmath108 we can consider the evolution of the dark matter magnetization in vacuum , i.e. , in the absence of ordinary matter , or in matter . since the largest external fields we can apply obey @xmath109 in vacuum , we set @xmath110 henceforth .",
    "we note , however , that the atomic - scale separation of electric charges in matter permit the opposite limit , @xmath111 , so that the analysis of the magnetization in that case can be altogether distinct .",
    "we set this possibility aside for later discussion and continue with the analysis in vacuum .",
    "we note that the ability to establish a vacuum relies on the presence of matter with conventional electromagnetic and strong couplings ; dark matter is sufficiently weakly interacting that vacuum technology does not affect it .",

    "the average value of @xmath5 is not altered to leading order in small quantities , namely , @xmath137 so that an appreciable faraday rotation can accrue in the absence of an effect on the average group velocity .",
    "thus far we have considered the faraday rotation of linearly polarized light consequent to passage a distance @xmath9 through a medium ; practical considerations demand that we determine its properties under reflection as well . if we reverse the direction of the light , eq .",
    "( [ solnvac ] ) is unaltered save for the sign of the term in @xmath138 . the last does change sign since @xmath139 .",
    "thus if we set @xmath134 , an initially right - handed circularly polarized wave , e.g. , travels both forward _ and _ backward with wave number @xmath140 , so that the rotation angle accrues coherently under momentum reversal . the additional faraday rotation associated with the explicit @xmath138-dependent term in eq .",

    "thus the net rotation angle after a round - trip , or after many , of a _ total _ travel length @xmath9 is @xmath141 neglecting the @xmath142 corrections and working in the @xmath143 limit , this becomes simply @xmath144 which agrees with the result of the non - relativistic treatment in ref .",
    "@xcite . for a system at rest in thermal equilibrium ,",
    "the magnetization @xmath131 is a simple function of the applied magnetic field .",
    "we recall that for a system of spin @xmath145 particles , e.g. , each with magnetic moment @xmath0 , the magnetization for a system with number density @xmath146 at temperature @xmath147 is  @xcite @xmath148 though it is of little practical relevance to the current circumstance , for the system we consider approaches thermal equilibrium extremely slowly .",
