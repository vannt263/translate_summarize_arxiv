    "this paper is part of a long term program to cauchy - characteristic matching ( ccm ) codes as investigative tools in numerical tools in numerical relativity . for a review of ccm see the article of winicour@xcite .",
    "the approach has two distinct features : ( i ) it dispenses with an outer boundary condition and replaces this with matching conditions at an interface between the cauchy and characteristic regions , and ( ii ) by employing a compactified coordinate , it proves possible to generate global solutions .",
    "this paper is continuation of work investigating ccm in systems with vacuum cylindrical symmetry ( as a prototype system containing only one spatial degree of freedom ) . in @xcite",
    "we developed the necessary machinery and in @xcite we applied the approach to the exact solution of weber and wheeler @xcite which has one degree of polarization and so only possesses one gravitational degree of freedom .",
    "an agreement with the exact solution was found with a maximum error better then 1 part in @xmath1 . in the same paper we also investigated the propagation of gaussian wave packets possessing two gravitational degrees of freedom , but this work did not involve a check against any exact solution .",
    "such a test is likely to be a more rigorous one because , unlike the weber - wheeler case , it would involve passing derivative information across the interface .    one of the major problems in numerical relativity is that there are very few exact solutions known which can be used to test numerical codes . in this paper ccm is applied to an exact two - parameter family of cylindrically symmetric vacuum solutions possessing both gravitational degrees of freedom due to piran , safier and katz @xcite .",
    "this family is somewhat unphysical because the rotational degree of freedom diverges at future null infinity .",
    "nonetheless , it can be used to test the ccm cylindrical code more rigorously because it involves passing derivative information across the interface .",
    "the previous ccm cylindrical code was constructed specifically for solutions which ( after using geroch decomposition to factor out the @xmath0-direction ) are asymptotically flat and therefore can not be used for processing the piran et al family . however , by working directly in terms of the geroch potential @xcite it proves possible to develop a modified version of the code which is able to process the family . in section [ sec : two ] we present the family of solutions and briefly discuss its properties . in section [ sec : char ] we review the derivation of the field equations in the characteristic region for solutions which , after factoring out the @xmath0-direction , are asymptotically flat . in section [ sec : asymp ] we discuss the asymptotic limit of the piran et al family and derive the modified field equations and the interface equations .",
    "an appendix discusses the regular singular nature of two of the resulting equations . in section [ sec : results ] we briefly discuss the results of the modified code .",
    "piran et al derive their metric by an indirect method starting from the kerr line element in boyer - lindquist coordinates @xmath2 , namely @xmath3 ^ 2 + { { \\rho^2}\\over{\\delta}}d\\tilde{r}^2 + \\rho^2d\\tilde{\\theta}^2,\\ ] ] where @xmath4 they first transform to a new isotropic radial coordinate @xmath5 where @xmath6 and then to cylindrical coordinates @xmath7 where @xmath8 employing the complex trick of sending @xmath9",
    "they then introduce new cylindrical coordinates @xmath10 given by @xmath11,\\\\ r&=&{{\\tilde{\\rho}}\\over{\\alpha}}\\biggl[1 -{{m^2+a^2}\\over{4(\\tilde{\\rho}^2-\\tilde{t}^2)}}\\biggr],\\\\ z&=&z-2a^{-1}m(m+\\sqrt{m^2+a^2})\\tilde{\\phi},\\\\ \\phi&=&\\alpha\\tilde{\\phi},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 and the resulting line element is in the jordan - ehlers - kompaneets form for a cylindrically symmetric spacetime @xcite , @xmath13 if we finally introduce coordinates @xmath14 then we can express the two - parameter family of solutions in the form @xmath15 where explicitly @xmath16 } } ,   \\label{omegaval}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath17 the coordinates @xmath18 and @xmath19 are null , @xmath20 is the canonical azimuthal coordinate and @xmath0 lies along the axis of symmetry .",
    "the two parameters are @xmath21 @xmath22 which is a length scale and @xmath23 @xmath24 which is a measure of the total energy of the system , with @xmath25 corresponding to flat space @xcite .",
    "the solution is regular everywhere in the coordinate range @xmath26 there is no conical singularity on the axis of symmetry and the solution reduces to minkowski spacetime at past and future infinity .",
    "however , the solution is conical at spatial infinity and singular at both past and future null infinity .",
    "more precisely , at future null infinity ( cf eq .",
    "( 10 ) in @xcite ) @xmath27 as @xmath28 , with analogous behaviour at past null infinity on interchanging @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "( note that eq .",
    "( 10 ) in @xcite includes a typographical error and that @xmath18 and @xmath19 should be transposed ) .",
    "since piran et al only derived this family of solutions by the indirect method described above , we tried to confirm that the family is vacuum by a direct computation of the ricci tensor using both of the computer algebra systems sheep @xcite and grtensor @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , neither system was able to complete the calculation because the metric involves nested radicals and algebra systems are notorious for the difficulties such quantities present .",
    "however , we were able to confirm the indirect derivation described above .",
    "the standard treatment of the jordan - ehlers - kompaneets cylindrically symmetric line element ( [ jek ] ) in the cauchy region @xmath29 is described in @xcite . in particular",
    ", it is shown that the independent set of dynamical equations for the variables @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are @xmath34 , \\label{ltildedot}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are defined in terms of the mixed components of the extrinsic curvature @xmath35 by @xmath36 these equations are augmented by the constraint equation @xmath37 , \\label{haml}\\ ] ] which serves to determine @xmath38 once the main variables are known .    in the rest of this section",
    "we review the treatment in the characteristic region since this will need modification to cope with the piran et al family of solutions .",
    "we introduce the compactified coordinate @xmath39 in which case the line element becomes @xmath40 where the metric functions @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath38 are now to be regarded as functions of @xmath18 and @xmath41 .",
    "the characteristic region then consists of @xmath42 where the interface is taken to be at @xmath43 and future null infinity is given by @xmath44 . instead of working directly with the metric functions @xmath30 and @xmath31",
    ", we use the related quantities @xmath45 and @xmath46 which are defined by @xmath47 where @xmath48 @xmath49 is the geroch potential @xcite , and the integration is along any path connecting a fixed point @xmath50 on the interface ( we choose @xmath51 ) to a general point @xmath52 in the characteristic region ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .    with these definitions the vacuum equations can be written in the succinct form @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are explicit functions of their arguments @xcite .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) and ( [ e2 ] ) serve to define @xmath56 and @xmath57 and ( [ e3 ] ) and ( [ e4 ] ) provide coupled propagation equations for @xmath56 and @xmath57 along the null rays ruling the hypersurfaces @xmath58 .",
    "the initial data consists of specifying @xmath45 and @xmath46 on the initial hypersurface @xmath59 and the interface @xmath60 , together with @xmath38 at their intersection @xmath51 .",
    "the essence of the iterative integration scheme is to use ( [ e3 ] ) and ( [ e4 ] ) to determine @xmath56 and @xmath57 on the interior null hypersurface @xmath61 and then ( [ e1 ] ) and ( [ e2 ] ) to determine @xmath62 and @xmath63 on @xmath61 , which in turn determines @xmath45 and @xmath46 on the next neighbouring null slice .",
    "finally @xmath38 is determined from the constraint equation ( eq .  ( 42 ) in @xcite ) which has the form @xmath64 where @xmath65 is an explicit function of its arguments .",
    "the ccm method requires the exchange of values of the metric functions and their derivatives at the interface at each iteration , the details of which are given in @xcite .",
    "the approach described in the last section breaks down for the piran et al solution in the characteristic region because @xmath66 as @xmath67 .",
    "let us consider the behaviour of the various functions on the hypersurface @xmath61 in the asymptotic limit @xmath68 .",
    "we have , @xmath69 where we set @xmath70 thus , asymptotically , @xmath71 and @xmath72 where @xmath73 it is clear that @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath31 and @xmath46 are all divergent as @xmath76 . however , the ancillary quantities @xmath77 and @xmath78 as well as @xmath45 and @xmath49 , the geroch potential , are all regular .",
    "this suggests rewriting the system ( [ e1])([e5 ] ) in terms of these last two variables .",

    "in fact , it is clear from the defining equations ( [ e6 ] ) and ( [ e7 ] ) , together with ( [ em ] ) and ( [ eo ] ) , that both @xmath56 and @xmath80 are of order unity in the limit @xmath76 .",
    "these are the modified equations on which the new code is based for investigating the piran et al solutions .",

    "in order to test the ccm code against the piran et al solution we will first compare the metric quantity @xmath30 in both the cauchy and characteristic regions .",
    "( [ psi ] ) provides the exact solution in both cases when @xmath85 and @xmath74 , eqs .",
    "( [ lamu ] ) and ( [ lamv ] ) , are written in terms of @xmath86 coordinates and @xmath87 coordinates for the cauchy and characteristic regions respectively .",
    "it is not possible to use @xmath31 for a similar comparison since from ( [ omegdiv ] ) we have seen that it diverges as @xmath76 .",
    "we use , instead , the geroch potential , @xmath49 , which is computed directly by the code in the characteristic region , but must be constructed in the cauchy region using its definition ( cf eq .",
    "( 24 ) of @xcite ) , @xmath88 it is straightforward to evaluate the integrals in the cauchy region using finite - difference representations of @xmath89 and @xmath90 . for the exact solution @xmath89 and @xmath90",
    "can be evaluated by differentiation , however the integral must be evaluated numerically to find a semi - analytic @xmath49 .",
    "a similar approach is required for the ` exact ' value of @xmath49 in the characteristic region using eq .",
    "( [ omchardef ] ) .",
    "as mentioned previously , the two parameters @xmath21 and @xmath23 of the piran et al solution represent the length scale and strength of the gravitational wave respectively . for @xmath91 the wave moves in from infinity , reaches its highest concentration at @xmath92 , where it rebounds from the @xmath93 axis , and is outgoing for @xmath94 .",
    "ccm allows us to evolve initial data containing an ingoing gravitational wave , something which is difficult to do for a cauchy only evolution .",
    "since we have set the interface at @xmath95 the value of @xmath21 can be chosen such that a substantial fraction of the the wave will move onto the cauchy region and will be well resolved with the numbers of grid points we choose .",
    "changing the interface position while keeping the ` interface distance to @xmath21 ' ratio the same results in an identical evolution on the cauchy portion of the grid .",
    "the primary variable we used for comparison are @xmath30 and @xmath49 ( since @xmath38 is a derived quantity ) .",
    "we considered grid resolution numbers of @xmath96 and @xmath97 , where the error is defined as @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the exact value , @xmath100 is the code computed value and @xmath101 denotes the @xmath102 norm .",
    "we ran the modified code for a whole range of values in the @xmath103 parameter space and found an error in @xmath30 of no more than 0.01% and an error in @xmath49 of less than 0.2% .",
    "however , in this version of the code , although the convergence rate of the solution starts as second - order it deteriorates to first order after long time evolution . in some recent work ,",
    "colleagues in the southampton numerical relativity group have modified the code so that it is now fully second order and very long time stable @xcite .",
    "the improvement was achieved by dispensing with variables which are related by exponential or logarithmic functions at the interface , using the geroch potential both in the cauchy and characteristic regimes and also using an implicit method at the interface .",
    "this version of the code is currently being applied successfully to modelling dynamic cosmic strings .",
    "surface plots are shown for evolutions of the metric quantity @xmath104 in fig .",
    "[ fig2a ] , the geroch potential @xmath49 in fig .",
    "[ fig2b ] , and the radial derivative @xmath105 ( which indicates the distribution of energy within the wave)in fig .",
    "[ fig2c ] , where the parameters are @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "the surface plots use a radial coordinate @xmath0 defined by , @xmath108 so that there is a change in the coordinate system at @xmath109 .",
    "note that the value of @xmath104 remains equal to 1 at null infinity , but is very close to zero at the axis @xmath93 .",
    "the incoming wave hits the axis at @xmath92 and rebounds .",
    "this can be seen very clearly in the surface plot of @xmath105 .",
    "the large peak of fig .",
    "2c grows without bound as @xmath23 is increased .    for comparison purposes figures  [ fig3a ] ,",
