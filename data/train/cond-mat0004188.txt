    "in statistical mechanics and field theory euclidean lattices describe the geometrical structure of crystals and of more abstract geometrical objects , such as discretized flat space - time . however , most real systems have irregular geometry : this is the case for glasses , polymers , amorphous materials , biological structures and fractals in condensed matter , as well as discretized curved space - times in field theory .",
    "the geometrical model for these inhomogeneous systems is a general discrete network made of sites and links , i.e. a graph . from this point of view",
    "usual lattices are a particular kind of graphs .",
    "statistical models defined on graphs ( e.g. harmonic oscillations , random walks , spin system ) are the natural way to describe the physical properties of inhomogeneous real structures .",
    "the study of the relation between geometry and physics is one of the most complex and interesting problem of statistical mechanics and field theory on graphs .",
    "the main link between this two aspects is provided by random walks .",
    "the latter are usually introduced to describe the diffusion of a classical particle and they are related to markov chains , potential theory and algebraic graph theory on one side @xcite , and to many problems of equilibrium and non equilibrium statistical mechanics , disordered systems and field theory on the other @xcite .",
    "in particular , the large times asymptotics of random walks provides the most effective method to describe the influence of large scale topology on the physical properties of discrete structures .",
    "the definition of the spectral dimension for inhomogeneous networks , generalizing the euclidean dimension of lattices in field theory and phase transitions , is indeed based on long time behavior of random walks @xcite .",
    "more generally , this asymptotic regime allows to classify every graph either as _ locally _ _ recursive _ or _ transient _ , according to the probability of ever returning to the starting site : the probability is 1 in the former case and less than 1 in the latter , independently of the site .",
    "this classification , first introduced by polya for regular lattices @xcite , is known as the type - problem .",
    "local transience and recurrence describe local properties of physical models on graphs .",
    "however , in the study of statistical models on graphs we are in general interested in average ( extensive ) thermodynamic quantities . indeed , while on lattices , due to translation invariance , local quantities are the same on all sites and therefore they are equal to their average , on inhomogeneous structures they depend in general on the site and the average behavior can not be reduced to the local one . in the last few years it has become clear that bulk properties are affected by the average values of random walks return probabilities over all starting sites : this is the case for spontaneous breaking of continuous symmetries @xcite , critical exponents of the spherical model @xcite , harmonic vibrational spectra @xcite .",
    "therefore the classification of discrete structure in terms of _ recurrence on the average _ and _ transience on the average _ appears to be the most suitable .",
    "unfortunately , while for regular lattices the two classifications are equivalent , on more general networks they can be different and one has to study a type - problem on the average @xcite .    recently this problem has acquired particular relevance in the study of spin models on graphs .",
    "indeed it has been shown that spontaneous breaking of continuous symmetries occurs at @xmath0 if and only if the underlying network is transient on the average @xcite .",
    "moreover this analysis has shown that relevant and new topological properties of infinite graphs are associated to the _ on the average _ classification .    in this paper",
    "we deal with the type - problem on the average and with the topological and thermodynamic properties arising from it , proving some basic theorems and discussing their relevance for present and future development in statistical physics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we introduce the basic concepts and notations concerning random walks on infinite graphs . in section",
    "iii we analyze local recurrence and transience properties of random walks , defined by the asymptotic behavior of return probabilities generating function . in section",
    "iv we consider thermodynamic averages on infinite graphs and in section v we introduce the topological classification in terms of average properties of random walks , based on transience and recurrence _ on the average_. in section vi we analyze the general relations between average generating functions of return probabilities and consider a further classification holding for transient on the average graphs , which completes the topological description of infinite graphs in terms of random walk behavior . in section vii and viii",
    "we show the relevance of this topological classification in the study of thermodynamic properties of statistical models on inhomogeneous structures .",
    "a summary and a discussion of our results are presented in section ix .",
    "let us begin by recalling the basic definitions and results concerning graph theory and random walks on infinite graphs , which will be used in the following .",
    "a more detailed and complete treatment can be found in the mathematical reviews by woess @xcite .    a graph @xmath1 is a countable set @xmath2 of vertices ( or sites ) @xmath3",
    "connected pairwise by a set @xmath4 of unoriented links ( or bonds ) @xmath5 .",
    "if the set @xmath2 is finite , @xmath6 is called a finite graph and we will denote by @xmath7 the number of vertices of @xmath1 . a subgraph @xmath8 of @xmath1 is a graph whose set of vertices @xmath9 and whose set of links @xmath10 .",
    "a path in @xmath11 is a sequence of consecutive links @xmath12 and a graph is said to be connected , if for any two points @xmath13 there is always a path joining them . in the following",
    "we will consider only connected graphs .",
    "the graph topology can be algebraically represented introducing its adjacency matrix @xmath14 given by : @xmath15 the laplacian matrix @xmath16 is defined by : @xmath17 where @xmath18 , the number of nearest neighbors of @xmath19 , is called the coordination number of site @xmath19 . here",
    "we will consider graphs with @xmath20 .    in order to describe disordered structures we introduce a generalization of the adjacency matrix given by the ferromagnetic coupling matrix @xmath21 , with @xmath22 and @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "one can then define the generalized laplacian : @xmath25 where @xmath26 .",
    "every connected graph @xmath1 is endowed with an intrinsic metric generated by the chemical distance @xmath27 which is defined as the number of links in the shortest path connecting vertices @xmath19 and @xmath28 .",
    "let us now introduce the random walk on a graph @xmath1 defining the jumping probability @xmath29 between nearest neighbors sites @xmath19 and @xmath28 : @xmath30 where @xmath31 . from ( [ pij ] ) the probability of reaching in @xmath32 steps site @xmath28 starting from @xmath19",
    "is given by : @xmath33 recurrence properties of random walks are studied introducing the probability @xmath34 for a walker starting from @xmath19 of reaching for the first time in @xmath32 steps the site @xmath35 , while @xmath36 is the probability of returning to the starting point @xmath19 for the first time after @xmath32 steps and @xmath37 . the basic relationship between @xmath38 and @xmath34",
    "is given by : @xmath39 @xmath40 . from the previous definitions @xmath41 turns out to be the probability of ever reaching the site @xmath28 starting from @xmath19 ( or of ever returning to @xmath19 if @xmath42 ) . therefore @xmath43 .",

    "we have that @xmath45 is a uniformly continuous function for @xmath48 $ ] and @xmath49 , while @xmath44 is continuous for @xmath50 but it can diverge for @xmath51 .",
    "multiply equations ( [ pf ] ) by @xmath52 and then summing over all possible @xmath32 with the initial condition @xmath53 we get the basic relations between @xmath44 and @xmath45 @xmath54 in the following we will call @xmath55 and @xmath56 .    before discussing recurrence and transience properties we briefly recall the definition of the gaussian model on a graph , whose deep relation with random walks will be exploited in the next section .",
    "the gaussian model on the graph @xmath1 can be defined @xcite introducing the field @xmath57 which are the functions of @xmath58 .",
    "it exist a unique gaussian probability measure @xmath59 on @xmath60 with mean zero and covariance @xmath61 @xcite ( @xmath62 is the diagonal matrix @xmath63 , @xmath64 ) ; @xmath65 characterize the gaussian model and we will write : @xmath66 and in particular : @xmath67    alternately , the gaussian model can be introduced using standard approach of statistical mechanics via the hamiltonian : @xmath68 together with the boltzmann weight @xmath69 , also leading to ( [ gauss2 ] ) .",
    "the long time asymptotic behavior of random walks on infinite graphs are determined by the large scale topology of the graph and the quantities @xmath70 and @xmath71 can be used to characterize the geometry of the graph itself . in particular a graph",
    "is called _ locally recurrent _ if @xmath72 on the other hand if : @xmath73 the graph is called _ locally transient_. by standard markov chains properties @xcite ( [ dric ] ) and ( [ dtr ] ) are independent from the site @xmath19 and then they can be consider as properties of the graphs .",
    "let us prove the independence from @xmath19 of ( [ dric ] ) . if @xmath74 then by equation ( [ gf2 ] ) we get @xmath75 for all @xmath28 ( @xmath76 ) ; now from ( [ pij ] ) and ( [ ptij ] ) we have that @xmath77 and @xmath78 . then also @xmath79 and from ( [ gf2 ] ) we obtain @xmath80 , @xmath81 . in an analogous way it can be shown",
    "that property ( [ dtr ] ) is independent from the choice of @xmath19 .",
    "local transience and local recurrence satisfy important universality properties @xcite .",
    "indeed these properties are not modified if we substitute the jumping probabilities of the random walker ( [ pij ] ) with the generalized jumping probability : @xmath82 in @xcite the invariance of the local recurrence properties under a wide class of transformations of the graph itself is also proven .",
    "local recurrence and transience are not modified by the addition a finite number of links or the introduction of second neighbor links on the graph .",
    "notice that these basic invariance properties prove that local recurrence and transience are determined only by the large scale topology of the graph .",

    "the study of thermodynamic properties of statistical models on infinite graphs requires the introduction of averages of local quantities .",
    "the latter are related to random walks by the return probabilities on the average @xmath129 and @xmath130 , which are defined by : @xmath131 @xmath132 a graph @xmath1 is called _ recurrent on the average _ ( roa ) if @xmath133 , while it is _ transient on the average _ ( toa ) when @xmath134 .    recurrence and transience on the average are in general independent of the corresponding local properties .",
    "the first example of this phenomenon occurring on inhomogeneous structures was found in a class of infinite trees called ntd ( fig .",
