    "more than hundred years ago j.j.sylvester stated @xcite and proved @xcite a theorem about restricted partition number @xmath0 of positive integer @xmath7 with respect to the @xmath4-tuple of positive integers @xmath8 : * theorem . *",
    "_ the number @xmath0 of ways in which @xmath7 can be composed of ( not necessarily distinct ) @xmath4 integers @xmath9 is made up of a finite number of @xmath10 where @xmath11 run over all distinct factors in @xmath9 and @xmath12 denotes the coefficient of @xmath13 in the series expansion in ascending powers of @xmath14 of @xmath15 and @xmath16 are all numbers ( unity included ) less than @xmath11 and prime to it .",
    "_ @xmath0 is also a number of sets of positive integer solutions @xmath17 of equation @xmath18 .",
    "it is known that @xmath0 is equal to the coefficient of @xmath19 in the expansion of generating function @xmath20 if the exponents @xmath9 become the series of integers @xmath21 , the number of waves is @xmath4 and @xmath0 of @xmath7 is usually referred to as a restricted partition number @xmath22 of @xmath7 into parts none of which exceeds @xmath4 .",
    "another definition of @xmath0 comes from the polynomial invariant of finite reflection groups .",
    "let @xmath23 is a molien function of such a group @xmath24 , @xmath25 are the degrees of basic invariants , and @xmath4 is the number of basic invariants @xcite",
    ". then @xmath0 gives a number of algebraic independent polynomial invariants of the @xmath7-degree for group @xmath24 .    throughout his papers",
    "j.j.sylvester gave different names for @xmath0 : _ quotity _ , _ denumerant _ , _ quot - undulant _ and _ quot - additant_. sometime after he discarded some of them .",
    "because of a wide usage of @xmath0 not only as a partition number we shall call @xmath0 a _ sylvester wave_.",
    "the sylvester theorem is a very powerful tool not only in the trivial situation when @xmath4 is finite but also it was used for the purposes of asymptotic evaluations @xmath22 , as well as for the main term of the hardy - ramanujan formulas for unrestricted partition number @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "recent progress in the self - dual problem of effective isotropic conductivity in two - dimensional three - component regular checkerboards @xcite and its further extension on the @xmath4-component anisotropic cases @xcite have shown an existence of algebraic equations with permutation invariance with respect to the action of the finite group @xmath24 permuting @xmath4 components .",
    "@xmath24 is a subgroup of symmetric group @xmath2 and the coefficients in the equations are build out of algebraic independent polynomial invariants for group @xmath24 . here",
    "@xmath0 measures a degree of non - universality of the algebraic solution with respect to the different kinds of @xmath4-color plane groups .",
    "several proofs of sylvester theorem are known @xcite,@xcite .",
    "all of them make use of the cauchy@xmath27s theory of residues .",
    "the recursion relations imposed on @xmath0 provide a combinatorial version of sylvester formula .",
    "the classical example for the elementary ( complex - variable - free ) derivation was shown by erd@xmath28s @xcite for the main term of the hardy - ramanujan formula .",
    "recently an elementary derivation of szekeres@xmath27 formula for @xmath0 based on the recursion satisfied by @xmath0 was elaborated in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we give a new derivation of the sylvester waves based on the recursion relation for @xmath0 .",
    "we find also its _ zeroes _ and prove a lemma on parity properties of the sylvester waves .",
    "finally we present a list of the first ten sylvester waves @xmath29 for symmetric groups @xmath2 and for all coxeter groups . in the appendix",
    "we prove a conjecture on asymptotic behaviour of the _ least common multiple _",
    "lcm(@xmath30 ) of the series of natural numbers .",
    "we start with a recursion that follows from ( [ syl3 ] ) @xmath31 and after inserting the series expansions into the last equation we arrive at @xmath32 where @xmath7 is assumed to be real .",
    "we apply now the recursive procedure ( [ rec2 ] ) several times @xmath33 let us consider _ the generic form _ of @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the independent positive integers .",
    "we will choose them in such a way that @xmath37 thus the relation ( [ rec3 ] ) reads @xmath38 as follows from ( [ rec4 ] ) , in order to return via the recursive procedure from @xmath39 to @xmath40 we must use @xmath36 which have @xmath41 as a divisor . due to the arbitrariness of @xmath41 it is easy to conclude that all exponents @xmath9 serve as the divisors of @xmath36 .",
    "in other words @xmath36 is the _ least common multiple _",
    "lcm of the exponents @xmath9 @xmath42 actually @xmath36 does play a role of the `` _ period _ '' of @xmath0 . but strictly speaking it is not a periodic function with respect to the integer variable @xmath7 as could be seen from ( [ rec5 ] ) .",
    "the rest of the paper clarifies this hidden periodicity .",
    "as we have mentioned above , @xmath0 gives a number of algebraic independent polynomial invariants of the @xmath7-degree for the group @xmath24 .",
    "the situation becomes more transparent if we deal with the irreducible coxeter group where the degrees @xmath25 and the number of basic invariants @xmath4 are well known ."
