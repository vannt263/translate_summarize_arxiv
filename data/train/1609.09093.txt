    "mass loss from massive stars is directly linked to the massive stars evolution , affecting a star s apparent temperature , and often luminosity and burning lifetime as well , for most of their lives .",
    "therefore , it has been actively investigated from both observational and theoretical points of view .",
    "in particular , the mass loss in the final stage toward sn explosions , which determines the type of a resulting supernova ( sn ) explosion , is one of the main issues in modern stellar astrophysics .",
    "one way to study the mass loss at the last stage of the massive star s evolution is to observe young sne .",
    "mass loss influences the stellar environments , forming the circumstellar medium ( csm ) around the progenitor star .",
    "the csm will be excited by the collision with the sn ejecta , and emits intense radiation in various wavelengths , allowing us to reveal the csm properties and the mass - loss history of the progenitor .",
    "in fact , the mass - loss histories have been revealed for a number of various types of sne , based on radio , optical , and x - ray observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "it is also important to measure the geometry of the csm around a sn , because a direct comparison with a csm directly imaged around an evolved massive star can help understand the nature of the progenitor ( e.g. , whether or not @xmath2 carinae can explode immediately ) .",
    "however , little is known about the geometry of the csm , since extragalactic sne are spatially unresolvable during the early phase of their evolution .",
    "this situation has been gradually changing by recent detailed spectropolarimetry of young sne , first pointed out by @xcite .",
    "however , these measurements are mostly for sn photospheric geometries ( i.e. , the sn ejecta ) , and the csm geometries still remain uncertain .",
    "csm geometries have been revealed / inferred for only a few sne including a remarkable example , sn  1987a , for which a complex csm ring was directly imaged ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "others include sne  1997eg , 1998s , and 2010jl , all of which are classified as type iin  a rare class of sne comprising of @xmath09% of all core - collapse sne @xcite , characterized by an intense narrow h@xmath3 line , and thought to have experienced the most drastic mass - loss episodes among all types of sne .",
    "polarization spectra of the three sne iin are strikingly similar with each other in that continuum emission is wavelength - independently polarized by @xmath02% and line emission is depolarized .",
    "this result led @xcite and @xcite to suggest a dense , disk - like or ring - like csm surrounding aspherical sn ejecta .",
    "we should however note that the interstellar polarization can change  valleys \" into  peaks \" ( or vice versa ) in the polarization spectrum , as clearly demonstrated by figure  10 in @xcite . since it is not easy to know a correct interstellar polarization ,",
    "there remain large uncertainties on the csm geometry .",
    "therefore , additional observational information about the csm geometry has been awaited .",
    "we here present new evidence for asphericity in the csm for three type iin sne , sn  2005kd , sn  2006jd , and sn  2010jl , based on multi - epoch x - ray spectral observations .",
    "essentially , in the very early - phase , we can detect a heavily - absorbed x - ray component solely , but later ( @xmath012yr after explosions ) , an additional moderately - absorbed x - ray component emerges .",
    "the co - existence of the two components and the delayed emergence of the moderately - absorbed component argues for asphericity , presumably a torus - like geometry , in the csm . in section  [ sec : obs_ana ] , we present information about observations as well as our analyses .",
    "we give our interpretation and conclusion in sections  [ sec : discussion ] and [ sec : conclusion ] , respectively .",
    "we analyzed a number of x - ray observations listed in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "parts of these observations were already published in the literature @xcite , while the rest are presented here for the first time . as for the _ swift _ data , we combined several observations taken closely in time to improve the photon statistics .",
    "the explosion dates are taken from the literature : 2005 - 11 - 10 for sn  2005kd @xcite , 2006 - 10 - 06 for sn  2006jd @xcite , and 2010 - 10 - 01 for sn  2010jl @xcite .",
    "we utilize the heasoft ( version 6.16 ) , ciao ( version 4.6 ) , and sas ( version 2014 - 11 - 04 ) software packages to analyze the data .",
    "we extracted a source spectrum from a circular region with a radius of 90@xmath4 , 30@xmath4 , or 15 for each _ suzaku _ , _ swift_/_xmm - newton _ , or _",
    "chandra _ observation , respectively , and subtract background emission from its surrounding annular region . within a few 10 arcsec of sn  2010jl , there are faint x - ray point sources including the closest source ugc  5189a ( thought to be a galaxy : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and six other sources @xcite .",
    "as for _ chandra _ , we choose the source region to avoid all of these contaminating sources . on the other hand , spatial resolutions of the other telescopes ( i.e.",
    ", _ suzaku _ , _ xmm - newton _ , and _ swift _ ) are not capable of resolving these sources , so that we take account of the contaminating emission in our spectral modeling . to this end , we adopt two absorbed power - law components for ugc  5189a and the other six sources , following @xcite .",
    "we fix the hydrogen column densities and power - law indices to @xmath5 = 4@xmath6@xmath7 ( ugc  5187a ) and 5@xmath6@xmath7 ( six nearby sources ) and a power - law index of @xmath8 = 1.15 ( ugc  5187a ) or 2.05 ( six nearby sources ) .",
    "the power - law normalizations are set to the _ chandra _ s best - fit values closest in time listed in tables  2 and 3 in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we added a gaussian component at @xmath06.41kev ( after correcting for the redshift of the host galaxy ) for some very early - phase spectra .",
    "this line has been identified as fe k@xmath3 arising from the neutral or low ionized iron ions in the csm @xcite .",
    "since most of the data are statistically too poor to perform chi - square tests , each spectrum is grouped into bins with minimum counts of 5 , and we use maximum likelihood statistics for a poisson distribution , the so - called c - statistics @xcite , to find the best - fit model . on the other hand , there are some exceptions that have relatively rich photon statistics , including the example spectra shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec ] . for them , we grouped the spectra into bins with minimum counts of 20 , and performed chi - square tests .",
    "we found / confirmed that most of the spectra were successfully reproduced by either an absorbed ( tbabs : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , non - equilibrium ionization model , i.e. , the vpshock model @xcite or collisional equilibrium model , i.e. , the vapec model @xcite , in xspec version 12.8.2k @xcite . regardless of the model , the temperature was obtained to be @xmath910kev .",
    "this suggests that the x - ray emission is dominated by a forward shock propagating into a csm , which is consistent with previous studies @xcite .    in the literature ,",
    "thermal equilibrium models had been favorably used over non - equilibrium models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is mainly motivated by the high density of the csm , of the order of @xmath010@xmath10@xmath11 based on both the optical spectroscopy and the high mass - loss rates inferred from optical and x - ray light curves ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "such a high density can raise the ionization timescale up to 10@xmath12@xmath11s ( i.e. , a typical equilibration time ) within a few months  much shorter than the time after the explosion .",
    "we noticed , however , that some of the spectra exhibiting strong fe k complexes can not be adequately reproduced by thermal equilibrium models without invoking an unusually high fe abundance ( e.g. , 10 times the solar values ; see tables  [ tab : param1][tab : param3 ] ) , as already noted by @xcite for sn  2010jl .",
    "this is because fe ions are almost fully ionized for equilibrium states at a high temperature ( @xmath1310kev ) . instead",
    ", these spectra can be well reproduced by non - equilibrium models without invoking unusually high elemental ( fe ) abundances . in principle , non - equilibrium ( under - ionized ) plasmas should be present behind ( collisionless ) forward shocks at any time , as shocks continuously take fresh , unshocked medium .",
    "in addition , bremsstrahlung radiation behind a forward shock cools some of the equilibrated ( high density ) plasmas down to non - x - ray emitting temperatures , increasing the relative importance of non - equilibrium plasmas compared with the equilibrium plasmas .",
    "for example , the cooling time due to bremsstrahlung radiation , @xmath14s @xcite , is indeed as short as @xmath08yr for a temperature of 20kev and a density of @xmath15@xmath11 ( which is expected at 3@xmath1610@xmath17 cm for a mass - loss rate of 0.01m@xmath18yr@xmath19 and a wind speed of 100kms@xmath19 ) .",
    "although it is difficult to estimate the amount of cooling plasmas , as it depends on the density structure of the csm which is often poorly constrained ( see section 3 ) , cooling would be at least qualitatively non - negligible for forward shocks of sne  iin .    in this context",
    ", it is likely that post - shock regions where x - rays are emitted has a range of ionization timescale .",
    "therefore , we basically adopt a non - equilibrium ionization ( vpshock ) model for our following spectral analyses .",
    "this model takes account of a range of the ionization parameter , where we take a range from zero up to a fitted maximum value .",
    "however , we note that our main conclusion is essentially independent of the model used ( whether the equilibrium model or non - equilibrium models ) at the expense of an unusually high fe abundance for the equilibrium model .    since the electron temperature was not well constrained owing to both low sensitivities at high energies of the x - ray instruments and the relatively poor photon statistics , we fixed the temperature of the vpshock component to be @xmath20 = 20kev ( unless otherwise stated ) , which is the only example of the robustly - measured temperature of a forward - shocked gas , based on a broadband x - ray spectrum of sn  2010jl with _ nustar _ and _ xmm - newton _ @xcite .",
    "we also fixed metal abundances to 0.4 times the solar values @xcite , based on metallicities of the sn environments : sn  2006jd @xcite , sn  2010jl @xcite , and sn  2005kd .",
    "an exception is the final - epoch _ suzaku _ observation of sn  2006jd when the data required an fe abundance of 1.56 solar ( see table  [ tab : all2 ] ) , even if we use the vpshock model .",
    "we found significant deviations from the single - component vpshock ( or vapec ) model for some early - phase spectra , as can be seen in the left panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : spec ] .",
    "therefore , we added another component , for which both power - law and thermal components are equally allowed from a statistical point of view .",
    "based on the @xmath21-test , statistical significances of adding the second component exceed 99.9% for all of the three sne .",
    "the fit results are summarized in tables  [ tab : param1][tab : param3 ] . as shown in these tables ,",
    "we examined two electron temperatures for the additional thermal ( vpshock ) component ; @xmath20 = 0.5kev and 20kev representative of the reverse and forward shocks , respectively , which will be discussed below .",
    "we point out that the main fit results ( i.e. , absorption column densities and the luminosities ) are in good agreements between the vpshock and vapec models , assuring that our analysis is fitting - model independent .",
    "the right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : spec ] show the best - fit models for the double high - temperature vpshock case .",
    "now , let us examine the validity of the three possibilities ( power - law , low - t thermal , high - t thermal ) for the additional component , based on astrophysical points of view .",
    "the power - law component could arise from the inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of the sn light ( @xmath01ev ) by accelerated electrons ( lorentz factor @xmath22 @xmath030 ) and/or synchrotron radiation from accelerated electrons .",
    "the former mechanism was discussed in detail to explain the x - ray emission from type iib sn  2011dh @xcite .",
    "for sn  2011dh , the ic process was preferred especially because this model was able to reproduce the observed x - ray light curve evolution strikingly well .",
    "however , there was a difficulty in explaining the x - ray luminosity ( @xmath02@xmath23ergs@xmath19 ) ; the electron number density responsible for the ic emission ( @xmath24 ) is required to be two orders of magnitude larger than the extrapolation from the radio spectrum ( @xmath25 ) , requiring an additional low - energy electron population @xcite .",
    "later , @xcite analyzed a deep x - ray observation at @xmath0500day , and found that the x - ray spectrum at this time is dominated by the reverse - shock thermal emission . by extrapolating the flux to the early phase",
    ", they found that the reverse - shock thermal emission could substantially contribute to the early - phase x - ray spectrum as well , which makes the required ic flux smaller .",
    "meanwhile , the x - ray luminosities of the sne iin in this paper are 12 orders of magnitude higher than that of sn  2011dh , whereas the peak radio fluxes are only a few times higher than ( or consistent with ) that of sn  2011dh .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the ic scenario is unlikely . likewise , the synchrotron possibility is not likely , either . a simple extrapolation of the radio emission to the x - ray regime results in @xmath26 ( x - ray ) @xmath0 @xmath26 ( radio ) @xmath0 10@xmath27ergs@xmath19 , which is four orders of magnitude lower than those observed ( see tables  [ tab : param1][tab : param3 ] ) .",
    "if there is a break in the power - law spectrum as is usually seen in sn remnants ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the x - ray flux would become even smaller than the simple extrapolation from the radio band , making the synchrotron case very unlikely .",
    "second , we turn to the low - t ( @xmath28kev ) thermal case .",
    "we suppose that this emission would originate from either a reverse shock or a dense clumpy / shell csm . in the reverse - shock case ,",
    "a reasonable density profile of the ejecta ( @xmath29 ) and a forward - shock speed of @xmath05,000kms@xmath19 indicates the reverse shock to be radiative .",
    "then , the unabsorbed x - ray luminosity decreases as @xmath30 @xcite , where @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 are the time after the explosion , and density slopes of the csm and the sn ejecta @xmath34 , respectively . by substituting @xmath35 and @xmath36 , which are typical values for wolf - rayet stars @xcite",
    ", we obtain @xmath37 . on the other hand , if we fit the multi - epoch spectra with this two - component thermal model , we find that the low - t component quickly disappears as @xmath38 ( which is not shown in this paper ) .",
    "this decline is much faster than expected .",
    "in addition , the fact that the absorbing column density of the low - t component is smaller than that of the high - t component ( see table  [ tab : param1][tab : param3 ] ) can not be explained by the reverse - shock scenario , since a cold dense shell forming between the reverse shock and the contact discontinuity absorbs the reverse - shock emission , whereas it can not absorb the forward - shock emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "thus , we do not favor this idea .",
    "as for the clumpy / shell csm scenario , such a density inhomogeneity is generally expected in a high - density csm rather than a low - density csm .",
    "this would conflict with the fact that the low - t component has a lower absorption than the high - t component ( see tables  [ tab : param1][tab : param3 ] ) .    in this context",
    ", the only viable possibility is the high - temperature ( @xmath39kev ) thermal case , which indeed seems plausible as described below .",
    "figure  [ fig : lumi_nh ] shows x - ray light curves and time evolution of absorbing hydrogen column densities for the three sne , where the data in red and blue are responsible for heavily- and moderately - absorbed thermal ( @xmath39kev ) vpshock component .",
    "the fit results responsible for these images are summarized in tables  [ tab : all1][tab : all3 ] .",
    "note that we fix the ionization timescale to 2@xmath1610@xmath12@xmath11 for very poor statistics data .",
    "we will give our interpretation of this spectral evolution in the next section .",
    "we have studied x - ray spectral evolution of three sne iin ( sn  2005kd , sn  2006jd , and sn  2010jl ) .",
    "initially , the spectra can be represented by a single , heavily - absorbed thermal component ( phase-1 ) .",
    "subsequently , the spectra start to show two components , comprised of one heavily absorbed , and another moderately absorbed high - temperature component ( phase-2 ) . finally , the heavily absorbed component disappears , leaving only the moderately - absorbed component ( phase-3 ) . as discussed in the previous section ,",
    "both of the two components should be associated with the forward shock propagating into the csm .",
    "the heavily - absorbed component comes through the massive csm until the forward shock overtakes the dense csm region , whereas the moderately - absorbed component directly reaches us .",
    "the timing when the moderately - absorbed component emerges is critical to determine the geometry of the massive csm . for a spherically symmetric csm",
    ", we expect that a heavily absorbed component , which is usually responsible for the reverse - shock emission , emerges later than the less absorbed component , which is usually responsible for the forward - shock emission .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the spectral evolution observed for the three sne iin .",
    "the unexpected x - ray spectral evolution observed , i.e. , a heavily absorbed component appears first , and then a less - absorbed component emerges later , requires an aspheircal csm and/or a density inhomogeneity of the massive csm ( e.g. , a spherical csm having lots of voids / holes ) , providing us with a new observational support to the mounting evidence for the asphericity of the csm .",
    "specific geometries of the csm around sne iin have been suggested to be disk - like or ring - like , based on previous spectroscopic and spectropolarimetric observations of sne iin @xcite .",
    "we here show that the x - ray spectral evolution can be reasonably explained along the same line .",
    "figure  [ fig : csm_image ] illustrates a schematic view of the csm geometry as well as the origin of the x - ray emission and its path to the observer .",
    "arrows in black and blue are , respectively , responsible for emission from the far and near sides of the torus hit by the forward shock , while arrows in red are responsible for the emission from the forward shock propagating into the void of the torus .    in the initial phase ( phase-1 ) , the radius of the forward shock is so small that the entire emission is heavily absorbed by the near - side of the csm torus .",
    "this phase is expected only if the csm torus is large and thick enough .",
    "in fact , at least for sn  2010jl , a large covering fraction of the csm is suggested by the large equivalent width ( 0.2@xmath400.1kev ) of the fluorescent fe k@xmath3 @xcite ; ew@xmath41 @xmath0 0.12 @xmath42 @xmath43 kev , where @xmath44 is a covering fraction ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "when the forward - shock radius increases enough to be observed over the csm torus ( phase-2 ) , we can see both of the moderately - absorbed and heavily - absorbed x - ray components . here , the moderately - absorbed x - ray component could arise from the hot gas in the void as well as the far - side torus hit by the forward shock . in the last stage ( phase-3 ) , the forward shock breaks out the dense csm torus , leaving only the moderately - absorbed x - ray component .",
    "given that the x - ray intensity scales as the square of the density , our interpretation that the moderately- and heavily - absorbed components originate from the  tenuous void \" and the  dense torus \" regions , respectively , is in reasonable agreement with the fact that the latter component is brighter than the former component ( see tables  [ tab : param1][tab : param3 ] ) .",
    "also in this interpretation , we expect a somewhat higher temperature for the moderately - absorbed component than for the heavily - absorbed one due to the possible difference in the shock speed .",
    "however , we assume a temperature of 20kev , which is a measurement by _ nustar _ , for both components .",
    "this is because such a high temperature is not sensitive to our x - ray data covering an energy range of 0.510kev .",
    "future wide - band spectroscopy may be able to resolve the temperature between the two components .",
    "the relative intensity between the moderately- and heavily - absorbed x - ray components also depends on the viewing angle of the csm torus .",
    "if viewed edge - on , the moderately - absorbed x - ray component will be very weak , which may be the case for another type iin sn  2005ip that do not show the two - component phase @xcite .",
    "if viewed face - on , the moderately - absorbed x - ray component can be seen even earlier than the heavily - absorbed x - ray component . in this way ,",
    "future systematic x - ray spectral observations of sne iin will help constrain the csm geometry .",
    "also , synergies between x - ray observations and optical spectropolarimetry / spectroscopy are very important .",
    "we now constrain properties of the dense csm torus , based on the results from x - ray spectral analyses .",
    "the timing when the heavily - absorbed component disappeared allows us to estimate the size of the csm torus . assuming that the forward - shock speed is constant at 5,00010,000kms@xmath19 @xcite",
    ", we estimate the radius of the csm torus to be 36@xmath1610@xmath17 cm or a few 1,000 au .",
    "the mass - loss rate for the eruption that produced the csm torus can be also inferred by comparing the x - ray light curve with an analytical model ( equation 3.18 , integrated from 0.2 kev to 10 kev in * ? ? ?",
    "this analytical model assumes a spherically symmetric csm , which is not likely the case at least for the three sne iin .",
    "however , if the covering fraction of the csm is large enough ( which is indicated by the large ew of the fe k line ) , the spherically symmetric model is not a bad approximation . from the early - phase ( @xmath45day ) heavily - absorbed x - ray component of sn  2010jl",
    ", we derive the mass - loss rate and the density slope in the csm to be @xmath46 @xmath0 0.01(@xmath47kms@xmath19)m@xmath18yr@xmath19 ( at @xmath48 cm ) and @xmath49 , which are consistent with previous estimates based on x - ray observations @xcite .",
    "these two parameters can be also inferred by modeling the @xmath5 evolution @xcite , from which we find a consistent density slope but a smaller mass - loss rate by a factor of 5 .",
    "this discrepancy may be explained by a substantial amount of the csm being fully ionized . adopting the flux - based mass - loss rate",
    ", we calculate the total mass in the csm torus to be 3.59m@xmath18 for a shock speed of 5,00010,000kms@xmath19 . assuming the same density slope ( @xmath49 ) , we calculated the masses of the csm torii for the other two sne iin to be 26m@xmath18 .",
    "these properties of the csm torus are quite different from those of sn  1987a and its older cousin sn  1978k @xcite ; the size and mass are an order of magnitude smaller and two orders of magnitude larger than those of the inner csm ring of sn  1987a , respectively @xcite .",
    "this implies that the nature of the progenitor stars of sne iin is very different from that of sn  1987a and presumably general type iip / l sne .",
    "for sne iin , the large amounts of mass eruptions during a short period prior to explosions , @xmath50yr where @xmath51 is the time for the forward shock to breakout the massive csm , favor the idea that the progenitors of these sne iin look like luminous blue variable stars @xcite .",
    "we should note , however , that neither the mass - loss rate nor the density slope for sn  2010jl is consistent with those obtained from the optical light - curve modeling : @xmath46 @xmath0 0.040.3(@xmath47kms@xmath19)m@xmath18yr@xmath19 and @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "( note that the masses from x - ray and optical measurements are roughly consistent with each other , since the combination of the large mass - loss rate and the steep density slope cancels out that of the small mass - loss rate and the flat density slope . )",
    "this might be due to the imperfect modeling of our x - ray data , especially because the analytical model we employed is applicable only for a spherically symmetric csm @xcite , which is not the case .",
    "therefore , for a better description of the x - ray data , we may need to develop sophisticated theoretical models / simulations , which is left for future work .",
    "based on multi - epoch spectral analyses of three sne iin , sn  2005kd , sn  2006jd , and sn  2010jl , we found that their x - ray spectra were initially explained by a single heavily - absorbed component , and then became comprised of moderately- and heavily - absorbed components during @xmath012 yr after explosions .",
    "both of the two components are most likely high - temperature thermal emission associated with the forward shock propagating into the csm , but have distinct absorptions .",
    "this x - ray spectral evolution requires a departure of a spherical symmetry in the csm .",
    "specifically , a torus - like geometry of the csm would qualitatively explain the x - ray spectral evolution .",
    "we estimated that the radius of the torus - like csm is on the order of @xmath05@xmath1 cm .",
