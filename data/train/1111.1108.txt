    "quantum particles in lattice potentials , e.g. electrons in crystals , have been studied since the early days of quantum theory @xcite . with the development of artificial ( optical ) lattice potentials for cold neutral atoms @xcite",
    ", bosonic lattice models are recently attracting increased interest as well @xcite , with the bose - hubbard model ( bhm ) @xcite being an important example . a remarkable phenomenon entailed by the bhm",
    "is that pairs of strongly interacting bosons can form tightly bound `` dimers '' both for attractive and repulsive interactions @xcite . in free space , or in the presence of energy dissipation , the repulsive interaction inevitably leads to pair dissociation . in a lattice , however , the kinetic energy of each particle is restricted to the values in the allowed bloch band .",
    "consequently , two co - localized particles in a dissipation - free lattice remain tightly bound together as a dimer when their interaction energy @xmath1 exceeds the kinetic energy of free particles @xmath2 within the bloch band .    in a previous publication @xcite ,",
    "we have studied the many - body dynamics of the repulsively - bound dimers of bosons . due to virtual transitions of the dimer constituent particles ,",
    "the dimers at the neighboring lattice sites strongly attract each other , with the corresponding interaction energy exceeding the dimer tunneling energy by a factor of 4 . for many dimers on the lattice , it is then energetically favorable to form dynamically stable `` droplets '' , constituting incompressible mott - insulating ( mi ) clusters with the number of particles per site of exactly @xmath0 .",
    "inevitable imperfections in the preparation process would typically cause such mi clusters to contain hole and particle defects corresponding , respectively , to unpaired and excess particles ( monomers and trimers ) .",
    "an important question is thus how to purify the system of the defects reducing thereby the entropy . in the present paper ,",
    "we discuss a mechanism of self - purification of stable mi clusters of dimers surrounded by lattice vacuum .",
    "we study the dynamics of defects in one - dimensional system by analytical calculations and numerical many - body simulations . within the cluster , hole and particle defects",
    "can propagate via resonant single - particle hopping with enhanced amplitude , which stems from the bosonic statistics of the surrounding @xmath0 mi environment .",
    "outside the cluster , hole defects correspond to free particles .",
    "since their tunneling energy @xmath3 is much larger than the monomer - dimer interaction energy @xmath4 @xcite , hole defects are not bound to the cluster and can `` evaporate '' .",
    "however , the widths of the single particle bloch band is twice larger inside the cluster than outside of it , therefore only the hole defects with energies in the center of the band can penetrate the cluster boundaries and evaporate into the lattice vacuum , while in the absence of quasi - momentum redistribution , low- and high - energy hole defects will remain in the cluster .",
    "we show that the presence of particle defects leads to efficient `` thermalization '' of the hole defects via quasi - momentum redistributing collisions .",
    "hence , very few such `` catalyzing '' particle defects can purify the mi cluster .    before continuing ,",
    "we note a recent relevant work @xcite dealing with fermionic dimers described by the hubbard model . after preparing a cold atomic gas with filling of @xmath5 in the trap center , followed by turning off the trap",
    ", the hole defects will simply tunnel out of the cluster into the vacuum . for fermions , however , the remaining cluster is not stable , since the effective second - order tunneling of the on - site pairs is not restrained by the interaction between the pairs .",

    "we can thus retain only the contributions on the scale of @xmath3 , which results in a very simple and transparent effective theory for the monomers . for a monomer in the cluster ( hole defect ) ,",

    "however , collisions of two particles interacting via any finite range potential can only exchange their quasi - momenta or leave the quasi - momenta unchanged @xcite ( for indistinguishable particles both outcomes are equivalent ) , provided that the lattice is deep enough so that the large band gap precludes interband transitions .",

    "[ sec : pairsonly ] , dimers forming stable clusters do not contribute to the dynamics of the system . for our initial conditions , typically containing a single cluster , we can thus reformulate the problem as one of the hole and particle defects moving on the background of dimers or vacuum , with the spatial configuration of the dimer cluster entering the effective hamiltonian for the defects only as a parameter .",
