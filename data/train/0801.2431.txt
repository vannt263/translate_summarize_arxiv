    "another possibility is that general relativity requires modification on large distance scales and at late times in the universe . in this case cosmic acceleration",
    "would arise not from dark energy as a substance but rather from the dynamics of modified gravity .",
    "modified gravity is not particularly attractive theoretically , but the observed cosmic acceleration is so surprising that all plausible explanations should be considered .",

    "they are expected to show significant departures from general relativity only on cosmological distance scales .",
    "the combination of cosmic microwave background anisotropy , weak gravitational lensing , and the growth of clustering of dark matter and galaxies provides an opportunity to discriminate between dark energy and modified gravity .    performing cosmological tests of modified gravity requires a set of predictions .",
    "there are two approaches to generating these predictions . in the first , a theory is specified by its lagrangian ( or other fundamental description ) which provides the equations of motion for both homogeneous expansion and cosmological perturbations .",
    "a class of theories can be specified by giving a lagrangian with free parameters , e.g. @xmath0 theories where @xmath12 is the ricci scalar @xcite .",
    "a second approach is inspired by the parameterized post - newtonian framework for solar system tests @xcite .",

    "where dark energy appears to drive accelerated expansion , there are no longer any bound test - particle orbits to measure @xmath13 , so a different approach , based on cosmological perturbation theory , is needed .    previous work in the cosmological parameterized post - newtonian framework has either assumed that some of the einstein field equations remain valid with modified gravity @xcite or has examined the dynamics of individual theories , e.g.@xcite .",

    ", assumptions must also be made about the background spatial curvature and entropy perturbations .",

    "this length scale might be associated , for example , with the dynamics of new scalar degrees of freedom .",
    "the value of this length scale , compared with the size of the systems investigated , plays a crucial role in characterizing the behavior of modified gravity theories .    if @xmath24 is much smaller than the length scales over which linear cosmological structure formation is measured ( e.g. , @xmath25 mpc ) , then the factorization of cosmological perturbations on scales larger than the jeans length remains valid .",
    "we denote this case scale - independent modified gravity .",

    "we assume that during this early period of evolution general relativity is an excellent approximation so that the damping is well described by the transfer functions computed using standard codes @xcite .",

    "also , for wavelengths short compared with @xmath196 and @xmath197 but large compared with the nonlinear scale , the gravitational couplings are constant but differ from gr , e.g. , @xmath198 for @xmath0 .    from the perspective of model testing ,",
    "scale - dependent modified gravity is much more complicated than the scale - independent case considered in sect .",
    "[ sec : long ] .",
    "the models have four dimensional parameters plus an exponent giving the time dependence .",
    "however , the situation is not so bleak , because structure formation depends only on @xmath179 and not on @xmath199 . in particular",

    "it is easy to see that the transfer function can depend only on the dimensionless variables @xmath203 .",
    "the most interesting new feature of scale - dependent modified gravity is the change of shape of the matter density transfer function .",

    "gravity is weaker than gr if @xmath208 , leading to reduced growth ; the growth is enhanced for @xmath209 .",
    "thus , scale - dependent gravity changes the shape of the matter power spectrum @xcite .",
    "ultimately , measuring this scale - dependence ( and doing so at several redshifts ) can constrain scale - dependent modified gravity theories . however , the interpretation of the galaxy power spectrum shape is complicated by scale - dependent biased galaxy formation and by the dark - matter - dependent transfer function ( e.g. , the neutrino fraction ) .",
    "thus , while the linear growth of structure offers a potentially powerful test of gr versus modified gravity , it must be combined with other tests .",
    "the second function characterizing scale - dependent modified gravity , @xmath199 , is ( in our analysis , which assumes no particular lagrangian ) unrelated to @xmath179 .",
    "this function is best constrained by combining weak gravitational lensing and galaxy clustering measurements made at the same redshift .",
    "care is required because the lensing amplitude is proportional to @xmath210 while the galaxy density is proportional to @xmath211 and also depends on biasing .",
    "galaxy peculiar velocity measurements could be used , in principle , to reduce or ideally eliminate the dependence on biasing @xcite .",

    "the continuity equation gives @xmath212 where the logarithmic growth rate @xmath213 is now scale - dependent , as shown in figure [ fig : s ] .",
    "as in the case of galaxy clustering , measurement of this effect is contingent upon knowing the composition of dark matter ( hot dark matter has a free - streaming scale , and its abundance determines the suppression of growth at small scales ) and correcting for any velocity bias .    the greater freedom allowed by scale - dependent modified gravity models , and the fact that astrophysics ( biased galaxy formation and dark matter dynamics ) may also introduce scale - dependence into transfer functions , makes it challenging to test gr using growth of structure and weak gravitational lensing .",
    "it is likely that a combination of galaxy clustering , peculiar velocities , and weak lensing will be needed to obtain strong constraints on scale - dependent modified gravity theories .",
    "a difference between the two longitudinal potentials @xmath13 and @xmath14 need not signal modified gravity ; it might arise from shear stress @xcite . for scalar mode fluctuations ,",
    "the shear stress is fully characterized by a scalar potential @xmath214 , such that the spatial stress tensor components are @xmath215 where @xmath216 is the background enthalpy and @xmath217 . in linearized gr ,",
    "one of the einstein field equations yields @xmath218 all of the results obtained in sections [ sec : long ] and [ sec : observe ] for modified gravity apply equally to gr with shear stress if @xmath2 is replaced by @xmath219 .    in standard cosmology ,",
    "the only significant source of shear stress is relativistic neutrinos after neutrino decoupling during the radiation - dominated era . for long wavelengths during the radiation - dominated era ,",
    "neutrino shear stress gives @xcite @xmath220 during the matter - dominated era , @xmath221 and shear stress is unimportant at late times in the @xmath7cdm model .",
    "it is also unimportant in simple quintessence models because shear stress vanishes for linear perturbations of a minimally - coupled scalar field .",
    "shear stress might nonetheless be important if cosmic acceleration is driven by an imperfect fluid . without specifying the dynamics of this fluid",
    ", few constraints can be placed on @xmath214 .",
    "one possible bound comes from the dominant energy condition , which states that each of the eigenvalues of @xmath222 must be smaller in absolute value than the energy density .",
    "if this condition holds , then eqs.([shearstress ] ) and ( [ grshear ] ) can be combined to give rather weak bounds on @xmath223 .",
    "additional constraints follow from the initial - value constraints of gr and energy - momentum conservation , which for a spatially flat background become @xcite    [ ivcon ] @xmath224    the first of these equations is the usual poisson equation in conformal newtonian gauge .",
    "the density and velocity potential perturbations are defined from the energy - momentum tensor components by @xmath225 , @xmath226 , while the entropy perturbation is defined by @xmath227 with @xmath228 . for a single perfect fluid like cold dark",
    "matter before its trajectories intersect , @xmath229 . however , in general @xmath230 for a multi - component fluid , e.g. dark matter and a non - constant dark energy .",
    "the freedom introduced by entropy and shear stress perturbations is , unfortunately , sufficient in principle to reproduce any observations of large - scale structure and gravitational lensing .",
    "consider , for example , perfect measurements of galaxy peculiar velocities everywhere and at all times assuming that galaxies exactly trace cold dark matter .",
    "then , eq .  ( [ momcons ] ) with @xmath231 for cdm yields",

    "now , the gr initial - value constraints ( [ energycon])([momcon ] ) suffice to yield @xmath234 and @xmath235 for the multi - component fluid of dark matter and dark energy . requiring this fluid to obey energy - momentum conservation ( [ econs])([momcons ] ) yields @xmath236 and @xmath214 . in short , perfect measurements of @xmath13 and @xmath14",
    "can be used to determine @xmath236 and @xmath214 of the combined fluid of dark matter and dark energy . when combined with measurements of the dark matter density and velocity fields ( assuming galaxies trace dark matter )",
    ", one can , in principle , determine the energy - momentum tensor components for dark energy .",
    "one can think of this energy - momentum tensor for dark energy as the difference between the einstein tensor for the observed metric and the energy - momentum tensor of the ordinary matter @xcite .",
    "this approach can be used , in principle , to determine the dark energy entropy and shear stress needed to explain any observations of large - scale structure ( including peculiar velocities ) and weak lensing  even if there is no dark energy , but instead gravity is modified . in effect , the two observable metric fields @xmath13 and @xmath14 can be exchanged for either @xmath236 and @xmath214 ( gr with exotic dark energy ) or @xmath26 and @xmath2 ( modified gravity ) .    although the initial - value constraints of gr can be used to determine the properties of dark energy , they can not be used to model modified gravity . as we have seen in previous sections ,",
    "modified gravity leads generically to a modified poisson equation with a variable gravitational coupling @xmath179 . in order not to break local lorentz invariance by the selection of a preferred frame",
    ", the other components of the einstein equation should also be modified .",
    "for example , in @xmath0 theories the left - hand side of ( [ momcon ] ) is multiplied by @xmath237 while the right - hand side acquires an extra term @xmath238 .",
    "neglecting these modifications leads to violations of eq .",
    "( [ consistent ] ) on large scales .",
    "for example , caldwell et al .",
    "@xcite modeled the dynamics of modified gravity with three recipes that assume the validity of some combination of eqs .",
    "( [ energycon ] ) and ( [ momcon ] ) .",
    "while recipes r1 and r2 satisfy the conservation of @xmath20 , recipe r3 does not . as a result",
    ", it leads to a different prediction for the gravitational potentials and therefore the isw effect .",
    "parameterizing modified gravity theories in cosmology is much more difficult than parameterizing post - newtonian gravity in the solar system because the gravitational potentials @xmath13 and @xmath14 in the gr limit are not static coulomb potentials in cosmology . in gr , on scales larger than the jeans or nonlinear length scales , @xmath239 factorizes into a product of a time - dependent growth function and a spatially - varying curvature perturbation .",
    "if this factorization persists in modified gravity theories , then a simple post - newtonian parameterization can be obtained .",
    "this is the approach we introduced in section [ sec : long ] .",
    "it has the practical virtue of yielding easily calculated predictions for all observables in the linear regime , including the growth of matter clustering , peculiar velocities , microwave background anisotropy , and weak gravitational lensing .    introducing the eddington parameterization @xmath15 ,",
    "where @xmath2 depends on time but not on space , we showed that structure grows faster ( gravity is stronger ) in models with @xmath77 .",
    "however , the shape of the transfer functions ( i.e. , their dependence on spatial wavenumber ) for these scale - independent models is unchanged compared with gr .",
    "unfortunately , realistic modified gravity theories such as the @xmath0 models have scale - dependent effects and can no longer be described by only one post - newtonian quantity @xmath2 . instead , the strength of gravity , described by @xmath26 in the poisson equation , can vary independently of @xmath2 .",
    "even so , because galaxy clustering and dynamics depends on @xmath26 but not on @xmath2 , while weak lensing depends on @xmath2 , observations could , in principle , measure modified gravity parameters assuming there is no dark energy .",
    "if dark energy is complex enough to require two additional fields to characterize its stress tensor ( e.g. , shear stress potential and entropy ) , then it appears that there is enough information in the dark energy model to account for any @xmath13 and @xmath14 without modifying gravity .",
    "one can not prove gravity is modified unless one can account for all significant contributions to the stress - energy tensor .",
    "thus , our hope to describe all modified gravity models with two parameters , yielding predictions measurably different from all dark energy models , has not been realized .",
    "distinguishing modified gravity from dark energy will require making additional assumptions .    nevertheless , the @xmath78 parameterization of scale - independent modified gravity presented in section [ sec : long ] , and the @xmath185 parameterization of scale - dependent modified gravity models presented in section [ sec : scaledep ] , are still useful for characterizing observational data .",
    "if measurements of galaxy clustering , peculiar velocities , and weak lensing are all consistent with @xmath73 and @xmath240 , for example , then modified gravity and exotic dark energy models can both be excluded .",
    "if measurements require nonzero parameters , however , dark energy and modified gravity remain viable explanations until additional assumptions are made to distinguish them , e.g .",
    "restriction of the lagrangian to a particular form .",
    "a generic prediction of modified gravity theories in cosmology is that the gravitational coupling @xmath26 in the poisson equation should vary with time and with length scale .",
    "departures from gr could be important not only in the linear regime of cosmological perturbations but perhaps also in the nonlinear regime ( albeit on scales much larger than the solar system ) .",
    "nonlinear effects may allow modified gravity to be distinguished from exotic dark energy , assuming that the dark energy fluctuations are small .",
    "for this reason it would be valuable to perform n - body simulations of structure formation using variable @xmath26 , extending previous work @xcite to the scale - independent and scale - dependent modified gravity models discussed in the current paper .",
