    "since the foundations were laid for a standard theory of disk accretion @xcite , two fundamental problems were immediately recognized @xcite : ( 1 ) the efficient transport of angular momentum to large radii can not be attributed to conventional kinematic viscosity , and ( 2 ) the observed high - energy spectra and luminosities and the ubiquity of outflow phenomena from accreting black holes implies efficient vertical transport of energy from a relatively cool , dense disk to a hot , tenuous and unbound corona . while it has been widely accepted that magnetic fields provide the most plausible means of efficiently transporting both angular momentum and energy , the precise nature of this transport has remained unclear until recent numerical simulations demonstrated , unambiguously , that accretion disks work because of magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence @xcite .",
    "the turbulence is generated by the magnetorotational instability ( mri  * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , which is driven by the free energy available from the differential rotation of the bulk flow . notwithstanding these groundbreaking results",
    ", however , the nature of vertical energy transport from an accretion disk to a corona and/or outflow still remains an outstanding and contentious issue .    in the context of active galactic nuclei ( agn )",
    ", much theoretical effort has recently focussed on the physics of accretion disk coronae @xcite , commensurate with the dramatic increase in both the quality and quantity of high - energy observational data .",
    "however , there has been little improvement in coupled disk ",
    "corona models since the first phenomenological descriptions of @xcite .",
    "current models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) simply replace the fraction of accretion power transferred from the disk to the corona with a poynting flux quantity estimated from a mean - field buoyant velocity and an equipartition , mean - field magnetic energy density .",
    "while numerical models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) do indeed show that turbulent fluctuations in a vertically stratified disk are capable of driving the magneto - gravitational modes of the parker instability @xcite , whether magnetic buoyancy can supply the corona with sufficient power to explain the observed high - energy emission is questionable .",
    "numerical simulations indicate that magnetic buoyancy is an ineffective saturation mechanism for the mri @xcite , while theoretical models for disk coronae require implausibly ideal buoyancy conditions and limiting accretion conditions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "realistically , the growth of the unstable buoyant - parker modes , which is essentially a wave - fluctuation resonance interaction , must compete against particle - fluctuation interactions , which correspond to dissipation of the turbulence and internal heating of the disk .",
    "the production and ubiquity of outflows from accretion disks around black holes also remains a challenging problem and it is unclear from most theoretical models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) whether mhd disk turbulence plays a significant role ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . nevertheless",
    ", numerical simulations of turbulent mhd accretion disks do in fact show that outflows become important in the innermost regions of turbulent accretion disks ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "unfortunately , the numerical models are restricted by their approach : non - keplerian motions are defined _ a priori _ as fluctuating quantities , so that vertical , mean - field transport is not self - consistently taken into account .",
    "indeed , the outflows that emerge in some of the simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are defined as regions where the nett radial flow is outward , rather than inward .",
    "furthermore , the neglect of vertical angular momentum transport restricts the radial inflow to substantially subsonic speeds ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . inevitably , the resulting accretion rates in the numerical models are typically very low ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "numerical models are also restricted by computational limitations : simulations that are global as well as vertically stratified are required to estimate the fraction of accretion power that can be vertically transported and this is not only computationally prohibitive , but also sensitive to numerical dissipation effects , which are difficult to quantify .",
    "thus , the present status of black hole accretion disk theory is that _ there is currently no formalism which self - consistently couples turbulent , mhd disk accretion with a magnetically - dominant corona in a framework that can accomodate a range of radial inflow and vertical outflow solutions . _    in this paper , we present the first fully analytic description of a turbulent mhd accretion disk coupled to a corona , self - consistently taking into account both vertical and radial mean - field fluxes of mass , momentum and energy . by deriving the relevant transport equations from first - principles ,",
    "our formalism provides a non - phenomenological and non - empirical approach to the problem of energy transport to a corona and the associated outflow and the inter - relationship of this transport with accretion onto the central black hole . in this treatment , we focus on the effects of turbulent magnetic stresses and the mean magnetic flux density",

    "however , our formalism lends itself naturally to the inclusion of nonzero mean magnetic fields , which we intend to explore separately in a subsequent paper . in   2 ,",
    "we present the relevant conservation equations for a resistive , viscous , and optically - thick mhd gas . in   3 , we statistically average these equations and derive the corresponding mean - field equations for a turbulent mhd gas . in   4 ,",
    "we apply these mean - field equations to the dynamics of a geometrically - thin accretion disk that is stationary and axisymmetric in the mean , and we expressly examine the implications of vertical mean - field transport for the conservation of mass and momentum . in   5 , we utilize the results of   4 to analyze the total disk energy budget .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of the main results in   6 .",

    "in the following , we make extensive use of a statistical averaging approach ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in which the mhd equations are ensemble - averaged .",
    "when the flow is steady in the mean , we can think of the averaging process as involving an average over a time - scale large compared to the time scales of instabilities and turbulent fluctuations .",
    "statistical averaging is not commonly used in astrophysics ( at least not explicitly ) .",
    "however , it is commonly used in the theory of the physics of turbulent fluids and in application areas such as geophysical fluid dynamics .",
    "the approach is capable of providing valuable insights .",
    "for example , in the case of accretion disks we gain valuable insights into the energy flow within the system .    to describe the mean flow dynamics , we adopt the prescription whereby a quantity , @xmath37 , is expressed in terms of mean and fluctuating components and @xmath38 denotes its ensemble average value .",
    "we distinguish intensive quantities , such as velocity , from extensive quantities , such as density , pressure and magnetic flux density , by using mass - averaged values , @xmath39 , and mean values , @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "this has the effect of conserving the mass associated with the mean flow , of conserving the mean magnetic flux and of restricting the number of terms that are produced by the averaging procedure .",
    "thus , the statistical averages of the density , velocity , pressure and magnetic field are represented by : @xmath41 and the mean fluid shear is @xmath42    in this paper , we restrict ourselves to the simplest case in which the magnetic field is dominated by its fluctuating component , so that @xmath43 .",
    "the more complex case in which a systematic component of the magnetic field is present clearly has important implications for disk accretion solutions , particularly when the field strength is sufficiently high to quench the mri and transport angular momentum via large - scale magnetic torques such as those invoked in models for mhd - driven outflows and poynting flux jets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , it is unclear whether large - scale , organized mean fields can be generated from a highly chaotic underlying flow and whether they can explain collimated outflows associated with accretion disks ( see e.g. the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the more general case of @xmath44 is thus defered for future work .",
    "all the mean - field equations derived here can , however , be straightforwardly generalized to include terms involving @xmath45 that are directly analogous to their turbulent counterparts .",
    "the molecular viscous stress tensor can also be written as @xmath46 , with @xmath47 , since it can be related to a coefficient of kinematic shear viscosity , @xmath48 , by @xmath49 ( ignoring bulk viscosity ) , where @xmath21 is the shear tensor defined in ( [ e : s_ij ] ) . in practice ,",
    "the mean viscous stress , @xmath50 , usually has a negligible effect on momentum transport ( particularly in a high reynolds number turbulent flow ) and is thus usually ignored .",
    "however , the fluctuating part of the viscous stress plays an important role in the dissipation of turbulent energy on the smallest scales at the end of a turbulent cascade .",
    "mathematically , this is described by the appearance of the correlation term @xmath51 in the mean - field internal energy equation , ( [ e : internal_mean ] ) , derived below .",
    "this term represents the mean rate of turbulent viscous heating and is dominated by the high wavenumber components of the turbulent velocity fluctuations ; that is , by the dissipative region ( in wavenumber space ) of the turbulent cascade .",
    "thus , although we henceforth assume @xmath52 , we retain @xmath10 throughout the averaging procedure in order to consistently include stochastic energy dissipation by turbulent viscous stresses .",
    "statistical averaging of the continuity equation , ( [ e : mass ] ) , gives @xmath53 so that the mass defined by the mean density is conserved .      in the case of zero nett magnetic flux ,",
    "the magnetic stresses are @xmath54 with ensemble mean , @xmath55 we also define the reynolds stresses as @xmath56    statistical averaging of the momentum equation , ( [ e : momentum ] ) , yields @xmath57 this equation shows that momentum transport in a fluctuating mhd fluid involves additional , statistically - averaged quantities that arise from the turbulent magnetic stresses and the reynolds stresses .",
    "note that the reynolds stress is conventionally defined as a mean quantity , whereas , for convenience , we have defined @xmath20 as an unaveraged quantity in order to simplify triple correlation terms that appear in the energy equations derived in   [ s : energy ] below .",
    "note also that these definitions of the turbulent stresses are opposite in sign to those used , for example , by @xcite .",
    "our usage is consistent with the conventional description of this term as a stress .    often in astrophysical contexts ,",
    "the terms @xmath58 and @xmath20 are referred to as viscous and resistive terms since they represent additional forms of momentum and electromagnetic transport . in this paper",
    ", we consistently refer to these terms as turbulent stresses and reserve the term viscosity and resistivity for real molecular effects .",
    "although we assume that the mean magnetic flux density is zero , for completeness , and to make one physical point , we present here the mean - field induction equation obtained by statistically averaging ( [ e : b_induced ] ) : @xmath59 this equation forms part of the foundation of classical mean - field electrodynamics ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is usually developed under the assumption of an incompressible flow .",

    "we do not , therefore , make any assumption in our formalism concerning mean - field dynamo amplication .",

    "however , the presence of transport terms , as well as terms describing the work done by fluid compression and/or expansion , implies that the steady - state production and dissipation of turbulent energy are non - local and therefore , the rates can not in general be equated .",
    "thus , it is not generally correct to simply replace the viscous dissipation term in the internal energy equation with the production term for turbulent energy",
    ". the rate of turbulent viscous dissipation in the mean - field internal energy equation must be related to the rate of production of turbulent energy self - consistently using ( [ e : te ] ) , as is demonstrated in the following section .      statistically averaging the internal energy equation , ( [ e : e_int ] )",

    "even this low a stress is capable of physically interesting effects , as we argue in the following section when we consider the implications of mass and momentum transport for the energetics of turbulent accretion disks .",
    "we now apply the above deductions from the momentum balance in a magnetized , turbulent accretion disk to calculate the power generated in the disk and emerging from the disk surface as both radiation and mechanical plus non  radiant electromagnetic energy .",
    "dissipation of the latter two components may generate further emissivity in a corona and/or outflow .",
    "our basis for this calculation is the total energy equation  ( [ e : energy_mean ] ) . usually in expositions of accretion disk theory , the internal energy equation is used , since this explicitly identifies energy exchange processes , in particular , the transfer of free energy from the keplerian shear in the bulk flow to the stresses which then dissipate that energy in the disk . in a turbulent mhd disk ,",
    "this energy transfer is largely attributed to the turbulent energy production term @xmath244 , that is related to the rate of viscous dissipation via a turbulent cascade and the rate of bulk heating of the fluid via various additional radial and vertical transport terms .",
    "however , the internal energy equation for a turbulent , mhd accretion disk involves many intermediate terms that are cumbersome . the total energy equation , on the other hand , has the advantage that all terms are in total fluxes , which can be integrated straightforwardly to obtain a conservation equation in terms of the nett power in each of the available energy fluxes .",
    "we therefore prefer to use the total energy equation , which more elegantly describes the contributions of all terms to the overall energy balance in a disk .",
    "the total energy flux contains a number of terms and in estimating the relative importance of these , it is useful to deduce order of magnitude estimates of the various components of velocity .",
    "these are the mean velocity components , @xmath121 , @xmath245 and @xmath155 , and the corresponding fluctuating components @xmath246 , @xmath247 and @xmath248 .",

    "so far , simulations of turbulent accretion disks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "however , vertical gradients in turbulent energy flux terms involving @xmath248 should in general be retained since , in addition to being affected by the mri , this component of the fluctuating velocity can also be enhanced by the parker instability and the total rate of vertical energy transport can be nonnegligible in a thin disk .",
    "turbulent perturbations in a magnetized disk become unstable to the gravitational modes of the parker instability as matter drains down slightly elevated flux tubes , thereby enhancing their buoyant rise to the disk surface . the buoyant velocity field generated in this way",

    "we estimate the buoyant velocity of such a flux tube by balancing the buoyant force per unit length corresponding to a density deficit of @xmath265 with the drag force @xmath266 where @xmath267 is the drag coefficient .",

    "as we have indicated earlier , the vertical mean flow velocity at the base of the corona , @xmath128 , that could arise from an imbalance between the thermal and radiation pressures and the local gravitational field , can not be estimated without a specific model .",

    "we now combine the fourth , fifth , and sixth terms on the right hand side of ( [ e : ld ] ) into a single term describing the total power removed from the disk by a wind : @xmath308 the leading term in the wind power is negative since the disk material is highly bound ; the only way in which the wind power can be positive is for the succeeding terms in @xmath309 to be positive .",
    "( see the discussion concerning winds below equation  ( [ e : vz ] ) ) .",
    "we define the nett heating rate of the disk due to irradiation and heat conduction from an external corona by @xmath310    we can now write the total disk luminosity as the following sum : @xmath311 when vertical energy transport from the disk ( i.e. @xmath309 ) is important , the disk luminosity is reduced as a result of the conservation of energy .",
    "realistically , some of the total power @xmath309 removed from the disk is available to heat the corona and potentially , the most important contribution to this term is : @xmath312 which represents the integral of part of the poynting flux over both surfaces of the disk ( see equation  ( [ e : poynting ] ) ) . to evaluate the importance of this term",
    "we compare the integrand of ( [ e : pphiz ] ) to the leading term in equation  ( [ e : ftot2 ] ) for the disk energy flux .",
    "this comparison shows that @xmath313 is an important component of the disk energy budget when @xmath314 we showed in ",
    "[ s : disc_eqns ] ( see equation  ( [ e : az_vert_condn ] ) ) that @xmath315 has an appreciable effect on the accretion process when @xmath316 hence , when this is the case , the power @xmath313 is comparable to @xmath305 , that is , when the @xmath237 stresses are important for angular momentum transport , they do significant work on the flow .    of course , the effect of the @xmath237 stress would be unimportant if it fluctuated in sign .",
    "however , if the disk has a wind , then one expects @xmath317 as a result of inertia causing magnetic field loops to trail the rotation of the disk .",
    "when @xmath257 is systematically negative , the disk luminosity is reduced for a given mass accretion rate and a corresponding amount of energy is available to heat the corona . as we have shown in ",
    "[ s : disc_eqns ] , even a weak stress can be dynamically important and the above shows that it can also be energetically important .",
    "indeed , the importance of @xmath237 stresses in thin disks is widely appreciated in accretion - outflow models . in the model by @xcite , for instance , the entire accretion flow is attributed to outward angular momentum transport by the torque associated with these stresses . a major physical difference between our model and that of disk - driven wind models such as that of @xcite and @xcite is in the mean magnetic flux threading the disk .",
    "we can also express the condition  ( [ e : pphiz_condn ] ) in terms of other disk parameters using , @xmath318 .",
    "for @xmath319 to be a significant fraction of the accretion power @xmath320 for representative agn values @xmath321 , @xmath322 , this condition effectively implies ( c.f .",
    "( [ e : wind_condn3 ] ) ) @xmath323 if the radial inflow velocity is subsonic , and there is at least a modest vertical field ( e.g. @xmath324 , say ) , then this condition may be satisfied if the coronal alfvn speed is comparable to the keplerian speed",
    ". however , depending upon the details of disk parameters ( including @xmath325 and the radial mach number ) , the condition may be satisfied for much lower values of the alfvn speed .    at this stage",
    "we also consider further the relationship of the power @xmath313 , to the vertical component of the poynting flux : @xmath326 the term @xmath327 in this expression contributes directly to @xmath313 .",
    "( other terms in @xmath328 are represented in @xmath329 . )",
    "the power @xmath313 represents the integral of this part of the poynting flux .",
    "it is interesting that the term @xmath330 does _ not _ appear in the expression for the _ local _ radiative flux , _ viz .",
    "_ equation  ( [ e : ftot ] ) .",
    "such a term is initially present as the above derivation for the local radiative flux shows .",
    "however , it is eliminated by a corresponding opposite term arising from the expression for @xmath282 .",
    "what does remain in the expression for the local radiative flux is a more complicated term involving @xmath331 multiplied by an integral over @xmath332 .",
    "this cause of this is that the angular momentum flow is driven by the total stress whereas the poynting flux is only related to the magnetic part of that stress as well a the inter - realtionship between the @xmath192 stress and the @xmath237 stress in the angular momentum equation  ( [ e : angmom ] ) .",
    "the term @xmath333 involves the integration of a number of terms all of which could be important in the disk energy budget . rather than consider them all here",
    ", we consider the representative , and probably most important terms : @xmath334 = 4 \\pi r \\left [ \\frac{\\langle { b_r^\\prime}^2 + { b_\\phi^\\prime}^2 \\rangle^+}{4 \\pi } \\tilde v_z^+ \\right ]   \\\\ 4 \\pi r \\langle s_z^{(3 ) } \\rangle & = & 4 \\pi r    \\langle \\left({u_{\\scriptscriptstyle \\rm b}}-    { t^{\\scriptscriptstyle \\rm b}}_{zz } \\right )   v_z ^\\prime \\rangle^+     = 4 \\pi r\\left [ \\frac{\\langle ( { b_r^\\prime}^2 + { b_\\phi^\\prime}^2 ) v^\\prime_z \\rangle^+ } { 4 \\pi}\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the term @xmath335 represents the contribution to the poynting flux from the wind ; the term @xmath336 represents the contribution to the poynting flux from turbulent diffusion .",
    "consider the first term , @xmath337 comparing this with the leading term in equation  ( [ e : ftot2 ] ) for @xmath338 we have : @xmath339 for the power associated with this term to be important , it would seem that both the wind mass loss rate should be comparable to the mass accretion rate ( @xmath340 ) and the alfvn speed in the corona should be comparable to the local keplerian speed . otherwise , the requirements on each of these factors would probably be excessive .    similarly , one can compare the diffusive terms to the same leading term in @xmath338 .",
    "the diffusive flux is important when @xmath341 this condition is similar in some respects to the one above referring to the systematic velocity component .",
    "however , in this case the turbulent velocity is not related to the wind mass - loss rate and one should allow for the possibility that the turbulent velocity can in principle be larger than the mean wind velocity .",
    "again , utilizing @xmath342 in this expression leads to the condition @xmath343 as in the treatment of the @xmath313 term above , typical agn values @xmath344",
    ", @xmath322 this condition relies on the ratio of the radial inflow velocity to the turbulent buoyant velocity . nevertheless , the impression from ( [ e : diffusn_condn ] ) is that the alfven speed in the corona should be fairly high with respect to the local keplerian speed for turbulent diffusion to be important .",
    "we have seen above that the importance of the various terms in the poynting flux compared to the accretion power generally depends upon the ratio of the coronal alfvn speed to the local keplerian speed and its relationship to disk and wind parameters .",
    "the above relationships give us a good idea of the importance of the various components of the poynting flux in absolute terms .",
    "further insight is obtained if we compare the various terms with respect to one another ; this informs us of the conditions under which each component is likely to dominate . in these comparisons",
    "we remind the reader that @xmath345 is associated with the power @xmath313 , @xmath346 is associated with wind - advective part of the poynting flux and @xmath347 is associated with the turbulent diffusive part .",
    "the ratio @xmath348 since @xmath349 , the vertical magnetic field would have to satisfy @xmath350 in order that the wind advective power dominate @xmath313 .",
    "similarly , the ratio of the turbulent diffusive power to the @xmath313 is determined by the ratio @xmath351 again , given that @xmath352 the vertical component of magnetic field would have to be extremely small for the turbulent diffusive term to dominate .      in a real disk , angular momentum",
    "is probably transported by a combination of both radial and vertical fluxes .",
    "the limiting case of radial transport only has , of course , been well  explored in the past .",
    "let us now investigate the opposite limiting case of vertical transport only , specifically as it affects the estimate of the power of the disk wind . in this limiting case , equation  ( [ e : angmom ] )",
    "becomes : @xmath353 = \\tilde v_\\phi r \\frac{{\\rm d}{\\dot m_{\\rm a}}}{{\\rm d}r } - 4\\pi r^2 \\langle t_{\\phi z }",
    "\\rangle^+     \\label{e : angmom_limit}\\ ] ] in this limit ,",
    "the non - kinetic , non - gravitational part of the wind power is dominated by @xmath313 so that @xmath354 \\ > { \\rm d}r \\label{e : pw}\\ ] ] using equation  ( [ e : angmom_limit ] ) the poynting flux term can be expressed as : @xmath355 inserting this expression into the integral  ( [ e : pw ] ) for the wind power , one obtains : @xmath356 i.e. the wind power is equal to the accretion power .",
    "the corresponding disk luminosity is @xmath357 i.e. the entire disk luminosity is attributed to external feedback heating from the corona . in this limiting case , some of the wind power would be dissipated in the corona and the rest would escape to infinity .",
    "there is a difference between the power in such a wind and the power in a centrifugally driven wind with a nett magnetic flux threading the disc .",
    "for example the power in a @xcite wind is @xmath358 and depends upon the nett magnetic flux in the disk , as well as the keplerian velocity at the inner radius .    in the theory",
    "we have developed here , the nett flux is zero , so that the magnetic field plays a different role than that envisaged in centrifugally driven flows .",
    "since the @xmath239 stresses play no role , the result represented in equation  ( [ e : pw_limit ] ) is inevitable .",
    "the binding energy released by the accreting disk material has to be manifest in the power of the wind .",
    "in this paper , we have established a self - consistent framework for the theory of magnetized , turbulent disk accretion around black holes .",
    "our formalism is the first to consistently treat turbulent disks using a robust statistical averaging procedure that explicitly includes dynamical equations for the evolution of the magnetic field together with the conservation equations for mass , momentum and energy transport .",
    "we have paid special attention to vertical transport of conserved quantities and consistently related such transport to the dynamical structure of the underlying disk .",
    "although the nett magnetic flux is assumed to be zero , the formalism is nonetheless sufficiently general to allow the straightforward inclusion of a systematic nett mean - field component .      1 .",
    "we have derived a comprehensive set of equations describing the transport of mass , momentum , internal energy , turbulent kinetic and magnetic energies , and total energy .",
    "the statistically - averaged conservation equations are completely general and are applicable to other subject areas involving turbulent magnetic fields .",
    "we have applied the statistically averaged equations to a geometrically - thin , optically - thick accretion disk that is stationary and axisymmetric in the mean .",
    "we have demonstrated that when vertical transport of mass , radial , vertical and angular momentum , and energy is self - consistently treated , the general equations include additional terms related to a disk wind and turbulent azimuthal ",
    "vertical stresses on the disk surface .",
    "we have shown that the total azimuthal - vertical stress can have a significant dynamical and energetic effect on the disk even though it may be numerically small compared to the radial ",
    "azimuthal stress that has dominated a large amount of accretion disk theory and simulation , to date .",
    "note , however , that the importance of this stress has also been realized in accretion  outlfow models ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "we have derived an expression for the radiative luminosity from the disk photosphere and shown clearly how this relates to the mechanical power in a wind and to the poynting flux , thereby identifying the possible sources responsible for powering coronae and/or outflows from accreting black holes .",
    "this expression also entails a different distribution of radiative flux than a standard accretion disk .",
    "this in turn affects the integrated spectrum .",
    "again , we defer the details to future work .",
    "we have discussed the three main sources of poynting flux into the corona  a component associated with the product of the azimuthal - vertical component of the turbulent magnetic stress , a component associated with wind advection of magnetic energy and a component associated with turbulent diffusion of magnetic field from the disk into the corona .",
    "the first component probably dominates in most cases even if the azimuthal - vertical stress is quite small in comparison to the radial - azimuthal stress .",
    "in the course of the analysis of the condition for a wind and the conditions for a significant poynting flux into the corona , the ratio of the coronal alfvn emerges as a critical parameter .",
    "when this ratio is of order unity , important magnetic effects are clearly present",
    ". however , there is also the prospect of significant effects when this parameter is less than unity .",
    "this region of parameter space is currently a relatively unexplored avenue of research in black hole accretion disks .",
    "6 .   in the limiting case ,",
    "when all of the angular momentum transport is through the vertical - azimuthal stress , we have shown that the wind power , at the base of the wind , is exactly equal to the accretion power .",
    "some of this power would be dissipated in the corona .",
    "this is the first time that a coupled disk - corona model has demonstrated , in a physically consistent fashion , the possibility of significant power emanating from the corona .",
    "this is also the first time that the power of a disk wind has been dynamically linked to the process of accretion . in models with a nett magnetic flux",
    "the wind power is related to the strength of the magnetic field .",
    "the existence of a coronal wind and the production of intense coronal emission are inextricably linked .",
    "the major influence in heating the corona is the stress that is responsible for transporting angular momentum vertically .",
    "the wind is essential to transport this angular momentum away from the disk .    in a realistic disk",
    ", we expect that both radial  azimuthal and azimuthal  vertical stresses would be involved in the transport of angular momentum , as well as a nett mass loss from the innermost regions .",
    "nevertheless , our limiting solution provides a good physical basis for the commonly held notion that accretion power could be channelled into significant coronal emissivity and/or outflow comprised of electromagnetic and bulk kinetic components .",
    "thus there is the prospect of explaining not only the coronal emission from radio - quiet agn and galactic balck hole candidates ( gbhcs ) , but also systems such as ultra - luminous x - ray ( ulx ) sources and analogous agn sources such as broad absorption line ( bal ) quasars where large mass outflows ( e.g. @xmath359 ) are inferred ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .    with a self - consistent framework now established , we are in the position of being able to consider further , via specific models , the complex relationship between disk , corona and outflows in a variety of sources , and to examine more thoroughly the conditions for the initiation of a wind and the implications for the general structure of the immediate environment of accreting black holes .",
