    "fully nonlinear pdes arise in many areas , including differential geometry ( the monge  ampre equation ) , mass transportation ( the monge  kantorovich problem ) , dynamic programming ( the bellman equation ) and fluid dynamics ( the geostrophic equations ) .",
    "the computer approximation of the solutions of such equations is thus an important scientific task .",
    "there are at least three main difficulties apparent to someone attempting to derive numerical methods for fully nonlinear equations : first , the strong nonlinearity on the highest order derivative which generally precludes a variational formulation , second , a fully nonlinear equation does not always admit a classical solution , even if the problem data is smooth , and the solution has to sought in a generalised sense ( e.g. , viscosity solutions ) , which is bound to slow down convergence rates , and third , a common problem in nonlinear solvers , the exact solution may not be unique and constraints , such as convexity requirements must be included in the constraints to ensure uniqueness .",
    "regardless of the problems , the _ numerical approximation of fully nonlinear second order elliptic equations _",
    ", as described in @xcite , have been the object of considerable recent research , particularly for the case of monge  ampre of which @xcite are selected examples .    for more general classes of fully nonlinear equations some methods have been presented , most notably , at least from a theoretical view point , in @xcite where the author presents a @xmath0 finite element method shows stability and consistency ( hence convergence ) of the scheme , following a classical `` finite difference '' approach outlined by @xcite which requires a high degree of smoothness on the exact solution . from a practical point of view",
    "this approach presents difficulties , in that the @xmath0 finite elements are hard to design and complicated to implement , in @xcite a useful overview of bzier - bernestein splines in two spatial dimensions is provided and a full implementation in @xcite .",
    "similar difficulties are encountered in finite difference methods and the concept of _ wide - stencil _ appears to be useful , for example by @xcite .    in @xcite the authors give a method in which they approximate the general second order fully nonlinear pde by a sequence of fourth order quasilinear pdes .",
    "these are quasilinear biharmonic equations which are discretised via mixed finite elements , or using high - regularity elements such as splines .",
    "in fact for the monge  ampre equation , which admits two solutions , of which one is convex and another concave , this method allows for the approximation of both solutions via the correct choice of a parameter . on the other hand",
    "although computationally less expensive than @xmath0 finite elements ( an alternative to mixed methods for solving the biharmonic problem ) , the mixed formulation still results in an extremely large algebraic system and the lack of maximum principle for general fourth order equations makes it hard to apply vanishing viscosity arguments to prove convergence .",
    "a somewhat different approach , based on @xmath1-penalty , has been recently proposed by @xcite , as well as `` pseudo time '' one by @xcite .",
    "it is worth citing also a _ least square _ approach described by @xcite .",
    "this method consists in minimising the mean - square of the residual , using a lagrange multiplier method . also here a fourth order elliptic term appears in the energy .    in this paper , we depart from the above proposed methods and explore a more `` direct '' approach by applying the _ nonvariational finite element method _ , introduced in @xcite , as a solver for the newton iteration directly derived from the pde . to be more specific , consider the following model problem @xmath2 } : = { f}({\\ensuremath{{\\ensuremath{\\,\\mathrm{d}}}^2}}u ) - f = 0\\ ] ] with homogeneous dirichlet boundary conditions where @xmath3 is prescribed function and @xmath4 is a real - valued algebraic function of symmetric matrixes , which provides an elliptic operator in the sense of @xcite , as explained below in definition [ def : ellipticity ] .",
    "the method we propose , consists in applying a newton s method , given below by equation of the pde , which results in a sequence of linear nonvariational elliptic pdes that fall the framework of the nonvariational finite element method ( nvfem ) proposed in @xcite .",
    "the results in this paper are computational , so despite not having a complete proof of convergence , we test our algorithm various problems that are specifically constructed to be well posed .",
    "in particular , we test our method on the monge  ampre problem , which is the de - facto benchmark for numerical methods of fully nonlinear elliptic equations .",
    "this is in spite of monge  ampre having an extra complication , which is conditional ellipiticity ( the operator is elliptic only if the function is convex or concave .",
    "a crucial , empirically observed feature of our method is that the convexity ( or concavity ) is automatically preserved if one uses @xmath5 elements or higher . for @xmath6 elements",
    "this is not true and the scheme must be stabilized by reenforcing convexity ( or concavity ) at each timestep .",
    "this was achieved in @xcite using a semidefinite programming method . in a different spirit , but somewhat reminiscent , a stabilization procedure was obtained in @xcite by adding a penalty term .",
    "the rest of this paper is set out as follows . in  [ sec : notation_and_discretisation ] we introduce some notation , the model problem , discuss its ellipticity and newton s method , which yields a sequences of nonvariational linearised pde s . in  [",
    "sec : ndfem ] we review of the nonvariational finite element method proposed in @xcite and apply it to discretise the nonvariational linearised pde s in newton s method . in ",
    "[ sec : unconstrained - fnl - pde ] we numerically demonstrate the performance of our discretisation on a class of fully nonlinear pde , those that are elliptic and well posed without constraining our solution to a certain class of functions . in ",
    "[ sec : ma ] we turn to conditionally elliptic problems by dealing with the prime example of such problems , i.e. , monge  ampre .",
    "we apply the discretisation to the monge  ampre equation making use of the work @xcite to check _ finite element convexity _ is preserved at each iteration . finally in  [ sec : pucci ] we address the approximation of pucci s equation , which is another important example of fully nonlinear elliptic equation .    all the numerical experiments for this research , were carried out using the dolfininterface for fenics@xcite and making use of gnuplotand paraviewfor the graphics .",
