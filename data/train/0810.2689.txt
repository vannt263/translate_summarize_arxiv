    "shell - type supernova remnants ( snr ) are widely believed to be the prime candidates for accelerating cosmic ray protons and nuclei up to @xmath4ev .",
    "a promising way of proving the existence of high energy hadrons accelerated in snr shells is the detection of very high energy ( vhe ; e @xmath5  gev ) @xmath0-rays produced in nucleonic interactions with ambient matter .",
    "vhe @xmath0-ray emission has been detected recently in several shell - type snrs , especially from cassiopeia  a  ( @xcite , @xcite ) , rx  j1713.7 - 3946  @xcite and rx  j0852.0 - 4622  @xcite .",
    "these two latest sources both show an extended morphology highly correlated with the structures seen in non - thermal x - rays .",
    "although a hadronic origin is probable in the above cases @xcite , a leptonic origin can not be ruled out @xcite . +",
    "another young shell - type snr is rcw  86 ( also known as g315.4 - 2.3 and msh  @xmath6 ) .",
    "it has a complete shell in radio  @xcite , optical  @xcite and x - rays  @xcite , with a nearly circular shape of @xmath7 diameter .",
    "it received substantial attention because of its possible association with sn  185 , the first historical galactic supernova  @xcite .",
    "however , conclusive evidence for this connection is still missing : using optical observations ,  @xcite found an apparent kinematic distance of 2.8  kpc and an age of @xmath8 years , whereas recent observations of the north - east part of the remnant with the chandra and xmm - newton satellites strengthen the case that the event recorded by the chinese in 185  ad was a supernova and that rcw 86 is its remnant  @xcite . in this case , a distance to the snr of @xmath9  kpc can be estimated for a standard sedov evolution scenario  @xcite . the x - ray spectrum obtained with the einstein satellite",
    "was first represented by a two - temperature plasma model  @xcite .",
    "then , rxte  @xcite and asca observations ( @xcite , @xcite ) , with a wider spectral coverage , were used to resolve a non - thermal component in the x - ray spectrum which can be well described by a soft power - law with a photon index of @xmath10 .",
    "the large - scale density gradient across rcw  86 ( @xcite and @xcite ) possibly suggests that the northern part could be the shocked half of a very low - density wind bubble plus dense shell from the progenitor star , and to this extent it could well be similar to rx  j1713.7 - 3946 and rx  j0852.0 - 4622 . in its southern part , rcw  86 contains an hii region . apparently , the gas density in this hii region is rather high and spatially extended .",
    "therefore , the snr shock has swept over an extended high density region in the south , with consequent high radio and thermal x - ray emissions  @xcite . with a diameter of about 40",
    ", rcw  86 is one of the very few non - thermal x - ray emitting snrs resolvable in vhe @xmath0-rays .",
    "h.e.s.s . , with its high sensitivity",
    ", its good angular resolution and its large field of view is ideally suited for morphology studies of such an extended object .",
    "+ evidence for @xmath0-ray emission from rcw 86 was found using the cangaroo - ii instrument , but no firm detection was claimed  @xcite . here , we present data on rcw  86 obtained with the full h.e.s.s .",
    "array between 2004 and 2007 .",
    "h.e.s.s . is an array of four imaging cherenkov telescopes located 1800  m above sea level in the khomas highland in namibia  @xcite .",
    "each telescope has a tesselated mirror with an area of @xmath11  @xcite and is equipped with a camera comprising 960 photomultipliers  @xcite covering a field of view of 5@xmath12 in diameter . due to the effective rejection of hadronic air showers with the stereoscopic imaging technique , the h.e.s.s .",
    "telescope system can detect point sources near zenith at flux levels of about 1% of the crab nebula flux with a statistical significance of 5  @xmath13 standard deviation in 25 hours of observation  @xcite .",
    "+ the shell - type snr rcw  86 was observed between 2004 and 2007 with the complete h.e.s.s . array .",
    "after standard data quality selection and dead time correction , the resulting live time is 31 hours .",
    "the observations have been carried out at zenith angles ranging from @xmath14 to @xmath15 .",
    "the data were taken using the wobble mode where the source is offset from the centre of the field of view , alternating between 28 minute runs in the positive and negative declination or right ascension directions ; the mean offset angle of the data set used in this analysis is @xmath16 .",
    "the energy threshold of the system increases with zenith angle : for the observations presented here , the average threshold was 480 gev .",
    "+ the data were calibrated using standard h.e.s.s .",
    "calibration procedures , as discussed by @xcite .",
    "the data were analyzed using a hillas parameter based method as described in @xcite with _ standard _ cuts , which include a minimum requirement of 80 photo electrons in each camera image .",
    "two different background estimation procedures were used , as described in @xcite . for 2d image generation and morphology studies , the _ ring background _",
    "method was applied with a mean ring radius of @xmath16 . as this method uses an energy averaged radial acceptance correction , the _ reflected - region background _",
    "method was applied for spectral studies . in this second background subtraction procedure ,",
    "off events were selected from the same field of view and in the same runs as the on events by selecting the region symmetric to the on region with respect to the camera centre . as a cross - check , a second analysis chain , sharing only the raw data and using the `` combined model '' analysis @xcite ,",
    "was also applied to the data .",
    "the two analysis methods yield consistent results .",
    "a clear vhe @xmath0-ray signal of @xmath2 standard deviation and @xmath17 excess @xmath0-rays is detected from a circular region of @xmath18 radius , centered on ( @xmath19 = 14@xmath2042@xmath2143@xmath22 , @xmath23 = @xmath24 ) .",
    "this integration region was chosen a priori on the basis of the x - ray data obtained with the rosat satellite and fully encompasses the snr .",
    "figure  [ fig::rcw86 ] shows the vhe @xmath0-ray excess map of the @xmath25 region around rcw  86 .",
    "the map has been smoothed with a gaussian kernel with a @xmath13 of @xmath26 to suppress statistical fluctuations on scales smaller than the h.e.s.s .",
    "point - spread function ( psf ) .",
    "the vhe @xmath0-ray excess from rcw  86 is significantly extended beyond the psf of the instrument , which is illustrated in the bottom left corner of figure  [ fig::rcw86 ] .",
    "contours of constant significance are superimposed in white at the 4 , 5 and 6@xmath13 levels .",
    "an excess map has also been produced with the so - called `` hard cuts '' for better gamma hadron separation , which includes a stricter cut of 200 photo electrons on the image size compared to the `` standard cuts '' , and was found to be compatible with figure  [ fig::rcw86 ] .",
    "the vhe emission shown in figure  [ fig::rcw86 ] is suggestive of a shell - like morphology . to test this hypothesis , the brightness profile of a thick shell projected along the line of sight and folded with the h.e.s.s . point - spread function was fit to the unsmoothed excess map .",
    "as illustrated in figure  [ fig::rcw86 ] , the best fit ( @xmath27 = 233.1/220 ) is obtained with an outer radius of @xmath28 , a width of @xmath29 and a centre of the shell at ( @xmath19 = 14@xmath2042@xmath2142.96@xmath30 , @xmath23 = @xmath31 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig::radprof ] shows the radial profile of the vhe excess relative to the fitted centre .",
    "the fit of the radial profiles to the data points results in a chi - square per degree of freedom of @xmath27 = 2.85/7 for a projected shell ( determined by outer ring radius , ring width and absolute normalization ) which is not significantly better than the fit of a projected uniformly - emitting sphere characterized by a ring radius and a normalization factor ( @xmath27 = 5.43/8 ) . also visible in figure  [ fig::rcw86 ] is an apparent deficit of @xmath0-rays at the western part of the snr .",
    "however , the azimuthal profile in figure  [ fig::azprof ] is consistent with a constant and reveals that this dip is not significant ( @xmath27 = 1.47/5 )",
    ". +    figure  [ fig::xmm ] shows the 3 - 6 kev x - ray map of rcw  86 obtained using six observations of the remnant carried out by the xmm - newton satellite in 2006  @xcite and additional observations taken in 2007 .",
    "the energy range was selected to avoid as much as possible contamination from line emission from the , in general , cool plasma ( @xmath32 1 kev ) of rcw 86 .",
    "potentially , the 3 - 4 kev range could contain some contamination from ar and ca lines , but no such line emission is seen in the available chandra , xmm - newton  @xcite or suzaku spectra  @xcite .",
    "this map was obtained by first automatically cleaning the observations of @xmath33 excursions to the mean count rate , thus minimizing the background of the maps .",
    "then , for each observation and for each of the three detectors ( mos1 , mos2 , and pn ) , a background count rate in the 3 - 6 kev band was determined using a relatively empty region of the field of view . in the final stage ,",
    "the background image was subtracted from the count rate image , and then corrected using the exposure maps obtained with the standard xmm - newton sas 7.1.0 software ( which includes vignetting correction ) , in order to obtain the background corrected map displayed in figure  [ fig::xmm ] . an overall positional agreement with the h.e.s.s .",
    "contours derived from figure  [ fig::rcw86 ] as well as a good compatibility between the outer radius of the @xmath0-ray emission ( @xmath28 ) and the extension of the x - ray emission can be observed .",
    "however , the emission peak apparent in the x - ray azimuthal profile is not visible in @xmath0-rays ( figure  [ fig::azprof ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the dip in surface brightness at the center of the remnant seems more pronounced in the x - ray radial profiles ( figure  [ fig::radprof ] ) .",
    "a more detailed comparison of the @xmath0-ray and x - ray morphologies would require higher statistics than presently available , and hence will have to await future longer observations .",
    "+    for the spectral analysis , the source region ( on region ) is defined by a circle of @xmath34 radius centered on the best fit position of the shell , chosen to fully enclose the whole source .",
    "the radius of the extraction region is illustrated in figure  [ fig::radprof ] .",
    "the spectrum obtained ( see figure  [ fig::spec ] ) is well described by a power - law with a photon index of @xmath35 and a flux normalisation at 1 tev of @xmath36 ( @xmath27 = 6.30/4 ) . the integral flux in the energy range 1 - 10 tev is @xmath37 , which corresponds to @xmath3 10% of the integrated flux of the crab nebula in the same energy interval .",
    "no significant improvement is obtained by fitting a power - law with an exponential cut - off ( @xmath27 = 2.96/3 ) .",
    "if the fit range is restricted to energies below 10 tev , a photon index of @xmath38 and a flux normalisation at 1 tev of @xmath39 are determined ( @xmath27 = 0.68/2 ) , compatible with the fit of the snr in the whole energy range . +",
    "there are two commonly invoked mechanisms for vhe @xmath0-ray production in young supernova remnants , inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of high energy electrons off ambient photons ( leptonic scenario ) and @xmath40 meson production in inelastic interactions of accelerated protons with ambient gas ( hadronic scenario ) . in such a hadronic scenario , a comparison between the expected thermal x - ray emission and the actually measured thermal emission has to await deeper observations in which one can better determined whether the tev emission traces the denser , thermal x - ray emitting parts of the snr , or is more closely correlated with the x - ray synchrotron emission from the remnant . + the measured @xmath0-ray spectrum from rcw  86 , restricted to energies below 10 tev , translates into an energy flux between 1 and 10 tev of @xmath41 .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of the whole remnant is mixed between thermal and non - thermal emission .",
    "assuming that the hard x - ray continuum originates from non - thermal synchrotron emission as reported by  @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , the measurement made by  @xcite using rxte data provides an estimate of the total amount of non - thermal flux from rcw  86 .",
    "they find that the spectrum is well fitted by a power - law of index @xmath10 and a flux normalization at 10 kev of @xmath42 , which extrapolated down to the 0.7 to 10 kev band leads to an integral flux of @xmath43 . in a leptonic scenario , assuming that the @xmath0-ray emission is entirely due to the ic process on cosmic microwave background photons , the ratio of the synchrotron power and ic power radiated is often used to constrain the magnetic field . for a power - law distribution of electron energies , @xmath44 , the general equation relating the synchrotron power ( @xmath45 ) produced by electrons with lorentz factors between @xmath46 and @xmath47 and the ic power ( @xmath48 ) radiated between @xmath49 and @xmath50",
    "can be expressed as follow : @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the energy density of the photon field and the energy density of the magnetic field , respectively .",
    "it should be noted here that , for a fixed x - ray energy , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are inversely proportional to the square root of the magnetic field .",
    "if x - rays and @xmath0-rays probe the same region of the electron spectrum , one finds the standard relation between the synchrotron and ic power @xmath54 . assuming that the target photon field is the cosmic microwave background , a magnetic field of @xmath55 can be estimated using equation  [ eq1 ] and the synchrotron photon index of @xmath56 , independent of the distance and age of the snr .",
    "this estimate is compatible with that of  @xcite based on thin filaments resolved by chandra ( assuming a distance of 2.5  kpc ) in which the authors also deduce a high speed of the blast wave ( @xmath57 ) ; their estimated value would increase to @xmath58 for a distance of 1  kpc .",
    "however , it is still a factor of 2 lower than the maximum field strength determined by  @xcite using a lower shock velocity of @xmath59 as suggested by optical data in the southern region of the snr  @xcite .",
    "the difference between the field amplification estimated by  @xcite and that of  @xcite lies in the fact that vlk et al . obtained a higher result when they de - projected the measured filament width , as for an ideal spherical shock , whereas vink et al .",
    "did not . without de - projection the two results",
    "remarkably agree , even though they were obtained for the southern side and the northern side , respectively . a discussion of de - projection for rcw  86 is given in  @xcite .",
    "with similar data ,  @xcite deduced a significantly lower magnetic field strength of @xmath60 .",
    "however , their analysis is based on rather different assumptions on the nature of filament formation . + in a hadronic scenario , one can estimate the total energy in accelerated protons @xmath61 in the range @xmath62  tev required to produce the @xmath0-ray luminosity @xmath63 observed by h.e.s.s . using the relation @xmath64 , in which @xmath65 is the characteristic cooling time of protons through the @xmath40 production channel  @xcite . the total energy injected in protons",
    "is calculated by extrapolating the proton spectrum down to 1 gev . because of this extrapolation over 4 decades in energy , the uncertainty of the estimate can be as large as a factor of 10 .",
    "assuming that the relatively steep slope of the proton spectrum ( as inferred from the observed @xmath0-ray spectrum ) is the result of an energy cut - off ( somewhere around several tens of tev in proton energy ) , and that at lower energies the proton spectrum has a @xmath66 type spectrum representative of those predicted by the diffusive shock acceleration theory , the total energy budget in all protons for the distance of 2.5 kpc and the ambient gas density between @xmath67 and @xmath68  @xcite , would be @xmath69 .",
    "this estimate is in reasonable agreement with theoretical expectations that a significant fraction of the explosion energy of @xmath70 is released in relativistic protons . on the other hand ,",
    "if the power - law spectrum of protons continues to gev energies with the spectral index @xmath71 ( i.e. similar to the gamma - ray spectrum below 10 tev ) , the total budget in protons would exceed a few times @xmath72 erg for a distance of 2.5  kpc .",
    "this would exclude the hadronic origin of tev @xmath0-rays , unless the snr is nearby ( @xmath73 kpc ) , or the @xmath0-rays are produced in very dense regions .",
    "indeed , @xcite and @xcite reported that there is a large density contrast across the remnant , e.g. in the south , where the density could be as high as @xmath74 ; with such a dense medium , a larger distance for the remnant could still be compatible with the observed @xmath0-ray flux .",
    "h.e.s.s . observations have led to the discovery of the shell - type snr rcw  86 in vhe @xmath0-rays .",
    "the @xmath0-ray signal is significantly more extended than the h.e.s.s",
    ". point - spread function .",
    "the possibility of a shell - like morphology was addressed , but can not be settled on the basis of the limited statistics available at the moment .",
    "the flux from the remnant is @xmath310% of that from the crab nebula , with a photon index of about 2.5 .",
    "the question of the nature of the particles producing the @xmath0-ray signal observed by h.e.s.s . is also discussed .",
    "+ in a leptonic scenario , assuming that the @xmath0-ray emission is entirely due to the ic process on cosmic microwave background photons and that the synchrotron and ic photons are produced by the same electrons , the ratio of the @xmath0-ray energy flux and the x - ray flux determines the magnetic field to be close to @xmath55 .",
    "+ in the hadronic scenario , the lack of information about the low - energy @xmath0-ray spectrum results in large uncertainties on the total energy budget in protons .",
    "if below several tens of tev , the proton spectrum has a @xmath66 type spectrum , the total energy in protons would be in reasonable agreement with theoretical expectations .",
    "on the other hand , if we assume that the proton spectrum continues down to gev energies with the observed spectral index @xmath75 , energetics would rule out a hadronic origin for the tev @xmath0-rays unless the snr is nearby , or if the @xmath0-rays are produced in a very dense medium as reported in the southern part of the remnant .",
