    "the x - ray transient a1744361 was discovered by ariel v in 1976 , when the source was in outburst ( davison et al .",
    "1976 ; carpenter et al .",
    "no optical counterpart was identified ( burnell & chiappetti 1984 ) , and no thermonuclear ( type i ) x - ray bursts were reported .",
    "the source was observed to be in outburst again 13.5 years later in august 1989 ( int zand 1992 ; in t zand 2004 ) .",
    "this time it was detected by the coded mask imaging spectrometer ( comis / ttm ; int zand 1992 ) onboard the ` mir ' space station , and the source was at a relatively constant level of @xmath4  mcrab ( about three times fainter than in 1976 ; see int zand 1992 ) .",
    "it was at least 10 times weaker ( and undetectable ) five months earlier and one month later ( in t zand 2004 ) .",
    "the source spectrum was indicative of a soft transient ( int zand 1992 ) .",
    "emelyanov et al .",
    "( 2001 ) analyzed data from comis / ttm and found 33 likely type i bursts from several x - ray sources in the field containing a1744361 .",
    "they found a burst from the aug 23 , 1989 data from a1744361 .",
    "the burst was detected with 8 s time resolution , by comparison of the source flux during the likely burst and the session - averaged source flux .",
    "no burst profile or detailed information about this burst was given .",
    "moreover , emelyanov et al .",
    "( 2001 ) made a classification of the observed bursts as type i ( thermonuclear ) based only on their identification with known classical bursters , while at the time a1744361 was not known to be a burster .",
    "however , they considered this burst to be the first detection of a type i x - ray burst from this source , and suggested that a1744361 contains an accreting neutron star .    since 2003",
    ", a1744361 has been in outburst every year , detected by rxte ( asm and pca ) , chandra , and integral ( remillard et al .",
    "2003 ; mcclintock et al . 2003",
    "; torres et al . 2004 ; markwardt & swank 2004 ; grebenev et al . 2004 ; swank & markwardt 2005 ) .",
    "the detections of radio and optical counterparts of this source have also been reported ( rupen et al . 2003 ; steeghs et al . 2004 ) . however",
    ", the x - ray detections ( in 2003 & 2004 ) did not show any type i x - ray bursts .",
    "discovery of type i bursts from an x - ray source can conclusively classify it , as these bursts are produced by thermonuclear burning of matter accumulated on the surfaces of accreting neutron stars ( joss 1977 ; lamb , & lamb 1978 ) .",
    "moreover , thermonuclear bursts are observed only from lmxbs ( strohmayer & bildsten 2003 ; liu , van paradijs , & van den heuvel 2001 ) . by analyzing 2005 rxte pca data ,",
    "we have found a type i burst from this source , which confirms the earlier conclusion of emelyanov et al ( 2001 ) .",
    "we have also discovered millisecond period brightness oscillations with a frequency of @xmath5 hz during this burst .",
    "these oscillations are produced by an asymmetric brightness pattern on the stellar surface that is modulated by rotation of the star ( chakrabarty et al .",
    "2003 ; strohmayer & bildsten 2003 ) .",
    "therefore , the burst oscillation frequency is identical to , or very close to the stellar spin frequency .",
    "hence , our detection of @xmath6  hz burst oscillations establishes the spin frequency of the neutron star in a1744361 .    analysing the 2003 rxte pca data , we have discovered two episodes of energy dependent dips in the x - ray flux from a1744 .",
    "the time interval between the two sets of dips in two successive rxte orbits indicates that the orbital period of a1744361 is @xmath7  min .",
    "we also report the discovery of a low frequency quasi - periodic - oscillation ( qpo ; @xmath8  hz ) , as well as an indication of a khz qpo @xmath9  hz ) from this source . in   2 , we describe the analysis of the data , and present our results . in   3 , we discuss the implications of our findings .",
    "we analyzed rxte pca data from the transient source a1744361 when it was in outburst in 2003 , 2004 , and 2005 .",
    "the duration ( rxte proposal number , rxte observation duration ) of these outbursts were @xmath2 month ( p80431 , @xmath10  ks ) , @xmath11 days ( p90058 , @xmath12  ks ) , and @xmath13 days ( p91050 , @xmath14  ks ) respectively .",
    "we analyzed all the @xmath15  ks of data , and found a single thermonuclear x - ray burst ( july 16 , 2005 ) .",
    "the rise time of the burst is @xmath2  s , while the decay time is @xmath16  s ( see fig .",
    "the peak count rate of the burst was @xmath17 with 3 pcus operating .",
    "we created burst profiles for different energy ranges , and also hardness profiles for several pairs of energy ranges .",
    "we also performed a time resolved spectral analysis by fitting blackbody spectra ( for the fixed hydrogen column density @xmath18  @xmath19 ; int zand 1992 ) through the burst .",
    "the lack of any significant drop in the blackbody temperature correlated with an increase in the blackbody normalization ( ie . radius ) , leads us to conclude that this is not a photospheric radius expansion ( pre ) burst .",
    "the burst had a peak flux in the 2 - 20 kev band of @xmath20 ergs @xmath19 s@xmath21 .",
    "considering this flux to be less than the eddington flux ( shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ) , the upper limit to the source distance is @xmath22  kpc , for a 1.4 @xmath23 neutron star mass , ionized hydrogenic accreted matter , and isotropic emission from the star .",
    "however , this upper limit will increase for lesser hydrogenic abundance , and will decrease if the gravitational redshift due the neutron star is considered ( galloway et al 2005 ) .    in order to search for oscillations during the burst , we calculated power spectra with a nyquist frequency of 2048 hz for 4 s intervals starting from the burst onset , using 125 @xmath24s event mode data .",
    "we found a candidate peak at @xmath6  hz in the first such spectrum .",
    "the main panel of fig .",
    "1 shows the 2 - 60 kev burst profile and the 4 s interval used to compute the power spectrum .",
    "the peak was resolved , so lowering the frequency resolution by averaging adjacent fourier bins improved the signal to noise ratio . at 2 hz resolution",
    "we found a peak power of 10.3 .",
    "the inset panel of fig .",
    "1 shows the 2 hz resolution power spectrum .",
    "the probability of obtaining a power this high in a single trial from the expected @xmath25 noise distribution ( 16 dof ) is @xmath26 .",
    "multiplying by a conservative trials penalty of 8192 , the number of frequency bins in the original spectrum , we arrive at a significance of @xmath27 , which indicates a strong detection .    to get a rough idea about possible frequency evolution , we next calculated a dynamic @xmath28 power spectrum ( strohmayer & markwardt 1999 ) .",
    "we used 1 s intervals to compute @xmath28 power spectra , and started a new interval every 1/8 s. the corresponding power contours ( see fig .",
    "2 ) are associated primarily with the rising portion of the burst profile , and the time evolution suggests that the oscillation frequency increases somewhat during the burst rise to peak .",
    "these properties are fairly typical of the behavior of oscillations seen in other burst sources , giving us even added confidence in the detection .",
    "the highest amplitude in the @xmath29 kev band in a 1 s interval during the oscillation is 10.3 % ( rms )",
    ". the amplitude increases with energy , reaching 15% for photons above 8 kev .",
    "this behavior is also fairly typical of burst oscillations ( strohmayer et al .",
    "1997 ; muno , ozel & chakrabarty 2003 ) .",
    "the pulse profile is sinusoidal , with no indications of significant harmonic structure .",
    "we searched all the data for qpos , and found a @xmath8  hz qpo in the april , 2004 data .",
    "we divided 750 s of data from the obsid 90058 - 04 - 01 - 00 into @xmath30 (= 75 ) equal segments of 10 s duration , and we calculated fast fourier transforms on each time segment . in order to reduce the noise ,",
    "the resulting power spectra were averaged , and @xmath31 (= 8) consecutive frequency bins were combined ( making the frequency resolution 0.8 hz ) . the upper figure of panel _ a _ of fig .",
    "3 shows this power spectrum , which clearly depicts a qpo of quality factor @xmath32 , at @xmath33  hz ( rms amplitude @xmath34% ) . for computing the significance of this qpo , we fitted the spectrum with a model , and minimized the corresponding @xmath25 to get the best fit parameter values .",
    "then we divided the power spectrum by the best fit model , and multiplied by 2 ( see the upper figure of panel _ b _ , fig .",
    "3 ) , in order to have the noise distributed as @xmath25 with @xmath35 degrees of freedom .",
    "the peak power ( 2.45 ) of the qpo , therefore , has the single trial significance of @xmath36 .",
    "as low frequency qpos are searched up to 100 hz , multiplying by the number (= 125 ) of trials , we get a significance of @xmath37 , which implies a @xmath38 detection .",
    "we also note that this qpo seems to shift by @xmath2  hz in @xmath13 hours , as there is an indication of a @xmath39  hz qpo ( with significance @xmath40 , and rms amplitude @xmath8% ; lower figures of panels _ a _ & _ b _ of fig .",
    "3 ) in the obsid 90058 - 04 - 02 - 00 ( apr 10 , 2004 ) .",
    "we searched for khz qpos in the whole data set , and found a tentative indication of a 800 hz qpo in the obsid 90058 - 04 - 02 - 00 .",
    "the significance of this possible qpo is only @xmath41 .",
    "however , its centroid frequency @xmath42  hz ) and high @xmath43-value @xmath44 are consistent with those of lower khz qpos observed from other sources . the inferred amplitude ( rms ) of @xmath45%",
    "is also consistent with lower frequency khz qpos in other sources .",
    "we discovered intensity dips in the obsid 80431 - 01 - 02 - 00 ( nov 17 , 2003 ) .",
    "the observed durations of the dips are between 5 s and 25 s. these dips appear only in the softer energy bands ( see fig .",
    "4 ) , which indicates that they are caused by partial obstruction of the central x - ray source by structures ( above the equatorial plane ) created within the accretion flow ( white & swank 1982 ; jonker et al .",
    "we found two sets of dips in two subsequent data segments .",
    "a particular set of dips may be caused by cold clouds ( or other structures ) distributed in a range of azimuthal angles above the accretion disk plane ( see for example , frank , king , & lasota 1987 ) . the time separation @xmath46  min ) between the two subsequent sets of dips",
    "gives an estimate of the orbital period of the binary system ( white & swank 1982 ) .",
    "as the width of each set of dips introduces an uncertainty , we suggest that the orbital period of a1744361 is @xmath7  min .",
    "however , we note that the actual orbital period may be half ( as we may have missed a set of dips because of the gap between two data segments ) , or twice this value ( as secondary dips may occur in between two primary sets of dips ; smale et al .",
    "the x - ray transient a1744361 has been an elusive source , observed only twice before 2003 ( in 1976 and in 1989 ) with gaps of many years . as a result ,",
    "detailed information about this source was lacking , except the strong indication ( from an putative type i x - ray burst ; emelyanov et al .",
    "2001 ) that a1744361 is a neutron star lmxb . since 2003",
    ", the source has shown outbursts every year .",
    "analyzing 2005 rxte pca data , we found a thermonuclear burst from this source with certainty ( as no other known candidate source was in the pca field of view ) .",
    "we also discovered millisecond period brightness oscillations during this burst . from these results",
    "we confirm that this source is an lmxb harboring a neutron star .",
    "we infer the spin frequency of the neutron star to be @xmath6  hz from the burst oscillations .",
    "this value is consistent with the observed spin frequencies of the neutron stars in lmxbs , that range from 45 hz to 619 hz ( strohmayer & bildsten 2003 ; kaaret et al . 2005 ) .",
    "more observations of bursts with oscillations from this source will be important , because the coherent addition of oscillation signals from several bursts may lead to a significant detection of harmonic power ( bhattacharyya & strohmayer 2005b ) , which will be very useful for constraining neutron star mass and radius , and hence for understanding the dense cold matter at the stellar core ( bhattacharyya et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the oscillation frequency of the observed burst seems to increase somewhat with time , and such evolution during burst rise can be used to understand the spreading of the thermonuclear flames on the neutron star surface ( bhattacharyya & strohmayer 2005b ; 2005c ) .",
    "such an understanding ( spitkovsky , levin , & ushomirsky 2002 ; bhattacharyya & strohmayer 2005a ; 2005c ; 2005d ) may be useful for constraining stellar surface and structure parameters .",
    "we also discovered intensity dips in the soft x - ray band from a1744361 , but have not observed any eclipses .",
    "this establishes that a1744361 is a ` pure ' dipper , which suggests that the observer s inclination angle @xmath47 is in the range @xmath48 ( frank et al .",
    "1987 ) . two subsequent sets of dips also suggest that the orbital period of this binary system is @xmath49  min , which is consistent with the observed orbital periods of other compact lmxb systems harboring rapidly rotating neutron stars . using this orbital period and the equation @xmath50 ( assuming that the donor star fills its roche lobe ; bhattacharya & van den heuvel 1991 ) , we can draw a curve in the radius - mass plane of the secondary companion star . here , @xmath51 is 9 hours , @xmath52 & @xmath53 are the companion radius and mass , and @xmath54 & @xmath23 are the solar radius and mass .",
    "this radius - mass relation , and the obtained range of @xmath47 , would allow us to determine the nature of the companion star , if either the pulsar mass function or the projection of the orbital velocity of the neutron star along the line of sight were known .",
    "however , even with the available information , we can make some useful comments . to do this",
    ", we keep in mind that for a given nature and mass of the companion , if @xmath55 is the normal stable radius , then the actual radius @xmath56 may be greater than or equal to @xmath55 ( due to bloating by x - ray heating ) , but can not be less than it . consequently , if @xmath57 , the companion can not be a hydrogen main sequence star .",
    "as for @xmath58 a degenerate or helium main sequence companion would have to be bloated by at least several or many times its original volume , it is likely that @xmath59 .",
    "this suggests that the companion star in a1744361 is likely to be a slightly bloated brown dwarf or hydrogen main sequence star ( see bildsten & chakrabarty 2001 ) .",
    "however , we note that if the actual orbital period is double of the proposed one , the companion star may be a hydrogen main sequence star ( with the upper limit of @xmath60 ) , or a brown dwarf , while an orbital period half the proposed value will allow for a brown dwarf and a hydrogen main sequence star ( for @xmath61 , as well as a bloated helium main sequence star with larger mass ( may be @xmath62 .    we have also discovered low frequency qpos @xmath63  hz ) for the first time from a1744361 .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that this source is a dipper , as such qpos have been observed from other dipping lmxbs ( jonker et al .",
    "it has been proposed that these qpos are caused by the partial obscuration of the central x - ray source by a nearly opaque or gray medium in or on the accretion disk ( jonker et al .",
    "2000 ) that requires a high system inclination angle @xmath64 , which is the case for a dipper .",
    "we also report an indication of a khz qpo from this source , which if confirmed , would likely be a lower khz qpo .",
    "if confirmed , this will be the first khz qpo observed from a1744361 ."
