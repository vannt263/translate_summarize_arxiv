    "in the past decade considerable amount of attention have been drawn both towards the experimental and theoretical studies of the internal scattering of atoms with a graphene layer and with various carbon nanostructures @xcite .",
    "owing to the fact that these nanostructures are endowed with exceptional electronic , optical , mechanical , thermal , and magnetic properties that are of vested interest to the modern communication engineering technologies  @xcite , their applications are in huge demand both in the scientific and industrial laboratories .",
    "graphene , in particular , manifest unique properties incurring its honey comb - lattice structure that could maximize the interaction of atom on the layer .",
    "in fact , the knowledge of the atom - graphene interactions has been very useful in the construction of the hydrogen storage devices @xcite and also plays an important role in understanding different physical , chemical and biological processes  @xcite .",
    "moreover , these interactions are connected to the phenomenon of quantum reflections whose studies are of special interest today to many experimentalists and theoreticians for explaining their exact behavior  @xcite .",
    "in addition to this , gaining insights of atom - graphene contacts are crucial in the development of graphene based electronics . in particular ,",
    "metals adsorbed on graphene can form different types of structures and can change graphene s electronic behavior instigating towards observation of interesting physical phenomenon  @xcite . among the metals that can be adsorbed on graphene ,",
    "study for the li atom is particularly very interesting for the applications in the storage of hydrogen gas @xcite , improving efficiencies of li - ion batteries @xcite , and making superconductors  @xcite .",
    "k atoms have also been used to tune the electronic structures of the graphene bilayers  @xcite .",
    "a graphene layer rolled to make a carbon nanotube ( cnt ) has some very peculiar properties and gained special attention by the researchers world - wide @xcite .",
    "interaction of the alkali atoms with the single walled cnts have profound applications in the purification of the cnts  @xcite .",
    "adsorbed alkali atoms have been demonstrated to act as chemical dopants on the cnts and have been used to fabricate field effective transistors  @xcite .",
    "accurate experimental measurements of the @xmath0 coefficients of any atomic systems with a graphene layer and with a cnt is extremely difficult .",
    "a number of theoretical methods have been performed , particularly using the density functional theories @xcite , lower order many - body methods @xcite , lifshitz theory  @xcite etc .",
    ", to uncover the nature of interactions of carbon nanostructures with various materials .",
    "klimchitskaya and co - worker have used lifshitz theory to explain the interaction between graphene layer with different materials including metal plate  @xcite , conduction cylinder  @xcite , atoms such as h  @xcite , na , rb , cs  @xcite , h@xmath1 molecule  @xcite , he * ion  @xcite , etc .",
    "interaction of cnt with the h atom and h@xmath1 molecule have also been explained by them in great detail  @xcite .",
    "however , these calculations for graphene layer have been basically carried out by employing single oscillator model ( som ) for the estimation of the dynamic polarizabilities . in this paper",
    ", we verify the results by evaluating them for the alkali atoms with their accurate values of the dynamic polarizabilities and emphasis on the need to use such accurate values by comparing our results with the som results .",
    "moreover , the interactions between cnt and alkali metal - atoms remain to be investigated thoroughly . in view of the fact that these interactions play crucial roles in a number of applications and keeping in mind their vast experimental use",
    ", it would be expedient to carry out more accurate theoretical analysis of the interactions of the graphene layer and cnt with the alkali atoms .",
    "the interaction between an atom and a wall is usually modeled by calculating the interaction between the atom and its image charge ( reflection ) in the wall .",
    "the reflection coefficients required for such calculations are well described by the widely celebrated lifshitz theory which expresses these quantities as the functions of the dynamic dielectric permittivity of the wall and of the dynamic dipole polarizabilities of the atoms @xcite .",
    "although accurate evaluation of the dynamic dipole polarizabilities in the atomic systems require sophisticated many - body methods , but their values for the alkali atoms , which are the utmost used atoms in the ultra - cold atomic experiments , are now known reliably at least with the sufficient precision at this stage of interest @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the dynamic dielectric permittivity values are generally known to insufficient accuracy in the material mediums due to their strenuous procedure of evaluation and could remain to be a tedious task for a long to determine them precisely . in particular , the nanostructures with thickness of the size of an atom such as the considered graphene layer and single walled cnt do not have well defined dielectric permittivity .",
    "this entails the need for adopting suitable models to estimate the @xmath0 coefficients by introducing some effective parameters that can substitute the role of the dielectric permittivity of the wall in the lifshitz theory . in this context , the two most popular models that are often employed in the theoretical determination of the dispersion coefficients are the hydrodynamic model @xcite and the dirac model @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we intend to apply both the models and would like to compare the obtained results using accurate values of the dynamic dipole polarizabilities .",
    "in addition , we plan to present a very handy functional form of the radial dependent dispersion coefficients so that they can be easily derived for any arbitrary values of the atom - wall distance and the cnt radius for their convenient use in the practical applications .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we present the modified lifshitz theory for the reflection coefficient on the graphene layer and cnt in the hydrodynamic and dirac model framework .",
    "this follows with a brief description of the method of calculations of the dynamic dipole polarizabilities in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] which are later used in the evaluation of the dispersion coefficients .",
    "calculated results for the @xmath0 coefficients using accurate values of the dynamic polarizabilities and using the som model are given in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] . in the same section we present the dispersion coefficients for the graphene layer and cnt determined by employing both the hydrodynamic and dirac models and compare them with the results obtained for an ideal conducting medium , au , and sio@xmath1 wall which were reported earlier .",
    "unless stated explicitly , the results are given in atomic unit ( a.u . ) throughout the paper .",
    "the general form of the interaction potential energy in the configuration of a micro - particle and a material planar structure interacting at a distance @xmath2 is described by the lifshitz theory which is expressed by @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the fine structure constant , @xmath5 is the frequency dependent dielectric constant of wall material , @xmath2 is the separation distance between the atom and the surface and @xmath6 is the dynamic polarizability of the atom with imaginary argument .",

    "the most difficult part in the evaluation of the above expressions is to get the @xmath15 and @xmath16 reflection coefficients correctly .",
    "two different models widely used to describe the electronic structure of graphene are the hydrodynamic model and the dirac model . within the framework of hydrodynamic model , the reflection coefficients for a graphene layer or cnt are given by @xcite @xmath21 with the wave number of graphene sheet @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "in this model , graphene is considered as an infinitesimally thin positively charged sheet carrying a homogeneous fluid with some mass and negative charge densities .",
    "the energy of the quasi - particles in graphene is quadratic with respect to their momenta .",
    "therefore , this model works well at large energies and fails at the low energies ( where actual energy of the quasi - particles is linear function of momentum ) .",
    "this model is an approximate one and does not take into account the dirac character of the charge carriers in graphene .    within the framework of the dirac model of the electronic structure of graphene ,",
