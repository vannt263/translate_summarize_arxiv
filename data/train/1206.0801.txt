    "the study of the hund s coupling effects in solids has a long history .",
    "van der marel and sawatsky@xcite pointed out that unlike the hubbard @xmath4 which is strongly screened , the atomic hund s @xmath5 , persists essentially unrenormalized in the solids and increases the splittings between the lower and the upper hubbard bands for a half filled shell , while decreases it away from half filling .",
    "the hund s term was also shown to have important consequences on the low energy physics of quasiparticles , when a transition metal impurity is screened in metallic host .",
    "the hund s coupling was shown to dramatically reduce the value of the kondo temperature@xcite .",
    "recent interest in this problem arose from dynamical mean field theory@xcite ( dmft ) investigations of the recently discovered iron pnictide superconductors .",
    "it was proposed that in these materials strong correlations arise from the hund s rule coupling @xmath5@xcite rather than from the hubbard @xmath4 , resulting in large mass enhancements .",
    "these calculations@xcite showed that for a reasonable value of the hubbard @xmath4 , the mass enhancement due to interactions is very small when @xmath5=0 , whereas it is exponentially enhanced by the hund s rule coupling .",
    "optical spectroscopy studies have shown that in both iron pnictides and chalcogenides the optical masses are many times larger than the band masses@xcite .",
    "the trend in mass enhancements is well accounted for by dmft combined with density functional theory ( dft+dmft ) calculations@xcite .",
    "since the strength of correlations in these solids is almost entirely due to the hund s coupling , these materials are dubbed hund s metals@xcite . the role of hund s coupling in iron pnictides and chalcogenides",
    "has been addressed from different perspectives in the literature .",
    "@xcite powerlaw behavior in quasiparticle self energy of model hamiltonians with hund s coupling was discovered in ref .",
    "@xcite and related to observations in ruthenates@xcite .",
    "many anomalous properties of ruthenates@xcite and other @xmath6 compounds were shown to be governed by hund s physics .",
    "@xcite    while at low energies and low temperatures hund s metals are describable by fermi liquid theory , the physical properties in their incoherent regime are anomalous and surprising . in the iron pnictides and chalcogenides there is a strong tendency towards orbital differentiation  @xcite , and the large mass enhancement can occur even though no clear hubbard band exist in the one particle spectra of these hund s metals  @xcite .    in this article ,",
    "we use first principles methods and model hamiltonians to search for experimental signatures of hund s physics in iron chalcogenides and ruthenates which are the subject of current intensive experimental studies .",
    "we show how the incoherence in iron chalcogenides above the nel temperature can blur portions of the fermi surface rendering them dark to photoemission spectroscopy .",
    "we show that fractional powerlaw behavior in optical conductivity that received significant attention in the ruthenates also takes place in the fete system , deepening the analogies between these systems .",
    "we compare the powerlaw exponents in optical conductivity extracted from first principles dft+dmft calculations with experiments in a broad class of materials , and elucidate the control parameters that govern this behavior .",
    "the fractional powerlaw behavior is characteristic of an intermediate regime where the orbital degrees of freedom are quenched but the spin degrees of freedom are not .",
    "this physics is most pronounced at the special valence of one unit of charge away from the half - filling .",

    "that we include all the electronic states in a large energy window ( -10 ev to 10 ev ) as opposed to 3- or 5-band model calculations , thus the hubburd @xmath4 appropriate for our calculations is much less screened compared to those studies .",
    "the electronic charge is computed self - consistently on dft+dmft electronic density .",

    "hunds metals have a very low temperature scale , called the coherence temperature , below which a fermi liquid - like coherence regime is reached .",
    "this phenomena has been discussed in other contexts such as heavy fermions@xcite and transition metal oxides@xcite and can be fruitfully probed by photoemission spectroscopy . at finite temperatures",
    ", some electronic states can be very incoherent and coherence in different electronic states is usually not reached simultaneously . due to the strong orbital differentiation discussed in ref .",

    "within dmft , this model maps to a su(3)@xmath44su(2 ) impurity hamiltonian . to understand why the hund s rule coupling has such a dramatic effect on the physical properties , we first perform schrieffer - wolff transformation ( for derivation see appendix ) to obtain kondo - like hamiltonian , of the form @xmath45 , with the potential scattering term @xmath46 , the spin - spin kondo part @xmath47 , the orbital - kondo part , @xmath48 , and the coupled spin - orbital part @xmath49 here @xmath50 and @xmath51 are spin , and su(3 ) orbital operators acting on the impurity site , @xmath52 are field operators of the conduction electrons coupled to the impurity , while @xmath53 and @xmath54 are pauli matrices and the gell - mann @xmath55 matrices of the su(3 ) group , respectively .",
    "notice that in our picture the same electrons carry both orbital and spin degrees of freedom , in contrast to the point of view of ref .",
    ", which emphasizes the spin and orbital degrees of freedom being carried by different type of electrons , i.e. , @xmath9 the spin , and @xmath16 the orbital .",
    "while the form of the low energy impurity model is dictated by symmetry considerations , the exchange couplings @xmath56 depend crucially on the impurity valence and hund s coupling @xmath5 .",
    "for the half - filled shell and large @xmath5 , only the spin - spin term @xmath57 survives , and a well known reduction of the @xmath57 kondo coupling for a factor of @xmath58 was derived in refs .   compared to a corresponding one band model .",
    "consequently , a huge reduction of the kondo temperature for a factor of @xmath59 in the exponent was derived in ref .  .",
    "this regime is relevant for half - filled @xmath15 shell realized in the hund s insulators lamnpo  @xcite .    for the above hund s metals ,",
    "the relevant valence of transition metal ion is one unit of charge away from half - filling .",
    "when @xmath5 is negligible , the hamiltonian is su(6 ) symmetric , and all three kondo couplings @xmath56 are positive ( antiferromagnetic ) . for the valence @xmath60 ( or @xmath61 ) , their numerical values are @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 , where @xmath65 ( or @xmath66 ) is a positive number , which depends on the corresponding anderson impurity model parameters , i.e. , hybridization @xmath67 and impurity level @xmath68 .",
    "the ground state is a fermi liquid , because antiferromagnetic couplings between conduction electrons and impurity degrees of freedom ensure complete quenching of both the orbital and spin moments . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath5 is large , the spin - spin kondo coupling @xmath57 changes sign to ferromagnetic , while the orbit @xmath69 and spin - orbit @xmath70 remain positive . in the three band su(2)@xmath44su(3 ) model and large @xmath5 , their numerical values are @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 , where @xmath74 ( or @xmath75 ) for valence @xmath60 ( or @xmath61 ) .",
    "this change of sign is due to the orbital blocking mechanism  @xcite , that allows only those virtual charge excitations which go through orbital singlet intermediate state ( see appendix ) .",
    "we note that for valence @xmath14 in iron pnictides / chalcogenides , the correct low energy hamiltonian has three terms , but not just spin - spin term , as proposed earlier  @xcite .",
    "it is however the spin - spin @xmath57 term that changes sign in the limit of large @xmath5 , and impedes quenching of the spin degrees of freedom ( termed spin freezing in ref .  ) .",
    "this substantially reduces coherence temperature , however , the @xmath70 term , which couples spin and orbital , is positive and gives rise to the fermi liquid state at very low temperature .      to demonstrate the above picture",
    ", we numerically solve a simplified three band model with the nearest neighbor diagonal hopping @xmath76 , and the next nearest neighbor hopping @xmath77 and @xmath78 , which gives a total bandwidth of the tight banding model @xmath79 .",

    "therefore there is an incoherence - coherence crossover with decreasing temperature .",
    "we determine the coherence temperature as the temperature at which the renormalized scattering rate is equal to the temperature , i.e. , @xmath83 , where @xmath84 and @xmath85 is the boltzmann constant .",

    "the range of frequencies at which the powerlaw is valid ( @xmath90 , as indicated by arrows in fig .",
    "[ model - self - energy]b ) is largest at valence @xmath86 , where the exponent is close to @xmath91 , as previously reported in ref .",

    "@xcite , hence stronger correlations approaching the mott state at @xmath93 lead to smaller exponent at low temperature , in qualitative agreement with our realistic calculations for fe and ru compounds .",
    "most importantly , there is no signature of quantum phase transition to non - fermi liquid spin - frozen state around valence @xmath86 , where the powerlaw exponents are found , and the crossover temperature scale does not follow the powerlaw behavior @xmath94 expected in a quantum critical scenario . hence we can _ exclude _ the possibility that the exponents are due to the proximity to the quantum phase transition , as proposed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "the powerlaw exponents are found in the temperature and frequency regime where the spin degrees of freedom are very slow and unquenched ( spin susceptibility has curie - weiss form and large static value ) while the orbital degrees of freedom are very fast and quenched ( orbital susceptibility is pauli - like , but enhanced).(see fig .  [ model]b and fig .",
    "[ susc ] in appendix ) this is a novel regime in which two degrees of freedom behave in different ways , one fluctuates very fast ( positive @xmath69 ) , the other one fluctuates very slowly ( negative @xmath57 ) , and both coupled by a third antiferromagnetic coupling @xmath70 .",
    "this situation is similar to the intermediate phase of the extended hubbard model study of ref .",
    "@xcite , where similar continuously varying exponents were shown to exists in the metallic non - fermi liquid phase in which there was a quenched spin - degree of freedom and an unquenched charge degree of freedom .",
    "notice that at @xmath93 only the large spin state is possible , hence the orbital degrees of freedom are gapped , and exponents disappear , while the effect is maximal one unit of charge away from half - filling , i.e. , @xmath86 .",
    "in conclusions , we have shown in this paper that the hund s rule coupling has a strong impact on the electronic states in valence of one unit of charge away from half - filling .",
    "the strongly correlated state in such materials can have very low coherence temperature , and the self - energy and optical conductivity show fractional powerlaw at intermediate energy .",
    "we have derived the effective low energy hamiltonian describing these systems and identified a negative kondo coupling in the spin - spin part of the corresponding low energy kondo model . we have shown that these anomalies are not controlled by the proximity to a quantum critical point but result from coexistence of fast quantum mechanical orbital fluctuations and slow spin fluctuations .",

    "we will limit our discussion to the case of a ground state valence @xmath106 and virtual charge excitations into valence @xmath107 . a direct way of evaluating this effective hamiltonian is to perform exact diagonalization of @xmath108 , then expressing matrix elements of @xmath109 operators in terms of atomic eigenstates @xmath110 , and finally evaluating all terms which appear in the sum @xmath111 here @xmath112 runs over the ground state multiplet at valence @xmath113 , while @xmath114 and @xmath115 run over ground state multiplet at valence @xmath116 .",

    "we first consider the su(6 ) symmetric case , which is realized in the absence of hund s rule coupling . in this case , the projector @xmath138 is irrelevant , since all states at some valence have equal energy .",

    "<S> we identify the effective low energy hamiltonian describing these systems and show that these anomalies are not controlled by the proximity to a quantum critical point but result from coexistence of fast quantum mechanical orbital fluctuations and slow spin fluctuations . </S>"
