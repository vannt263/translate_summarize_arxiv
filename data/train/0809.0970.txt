    "dark clouds are seen as dark patches against bright star fields , while they are observed as reflection nebulae at near - infrared ( nir ) wavelengths in the recent decade ( lehtinen & mattila 1996 , nakajima et al .",
    "2003 , foster & goodman 2006 ) .",
    "the images of nir reflection nebulae give us an insight that darker areas with fewer background stars have larger column densities .",
    "in our previous paper ( nakajima et al .",
    "2003 ) , we showed that the lupus 3 dark cloud appears as an nir reflection nebula and suggested that there is a relationship between the nir surface brightness and dust column density toward the lupus 3 dark cloud .",
    "it is worth investigating whether if we can quantify the relationship between the nir surface brightness and column density .",
    "star counting , color excess of background stars , molecular gas and thermal dust emissions have been used for column density mapping of dark clouds .",
    "juvela et al . (",
    "2006 ) reviewed these methods intensively .",
    "each of these methods has limitations .",
    "a common limitation to all these methods is that it is hard to obtain a high spatial resolution .",
    "padoan et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and juvela et al .",
    "( 2006 ) examined the use of scattered nir surface brightness as a new high resolution tracer of the interstellar clouds .",
    "they derived an analytical formula to convert nir surface brightness to visual extinction .",
    "the formula is linear at low visual extinctions and starts to saturate when visual extinction reaches @xmath7 10 mag .",
    "juvela et al . ( 2006 ) used numerical simulations and radiative transfer calculations to show that the nir surface brightness can be converted to column density in the range of @xmath6 @xmath8 15 mag with accuracy of better than 20% .",
    "juvela et al .",
    "( 2008 ) applied the method to a filamentary cloud in corona australis .",
    "the method using surface brightness and one using color excess of background star agrees below @xmath6 @xmath7 15 mag .    in this paper",
    ", we propose an empirical method of estimating column density of dark clouds up to @xmath6 @xmath7 50 mag by using nir surface brightness .",
    "we re - examine the nir data of the lupus 3 dark cloud in nakajima et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and obtain a plausible empirical equations which fit the observed relationship between the surface brightness and column density . using the relationship , we obtain the dust column density map from the surface brightness .    , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 bands from top to bottom .",
    "saturated stars are masked with circles in black .",
    "bad pixel clusters in the j band are also shown in black .",
    "the lowest contour level denotes the 3-sigma limiting flux and the interval of contour is set to the 3-sigma limiting flux value at each band . ]",
    "we obtained the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 band data of the lupus 3 dark cloud on 2001 june 4 and 7 with the irsf 1.4 m telescope and the nir camera sirius .",
    "the total integration time was 135 minutes for each band .",
    "procedures of observations and data reduction are almost the same as described in nakajima et al .",
    "the differences are as follows .",
    "we included data obtained on 2001 june 7 in addition to those on 2001 june 4 to obtain a higher signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "we calibrated photometry by comparing stars in the observed field with 2mass catalog stars instead of using standard stars .",
    "color conversion factors between the 2mass and irsf / sirius system were taken into account ( nakajima et al . 2008 ) .",
    "hence , magnitudes and colors are presented in the 2mass photometric system .",
    "we selected well - measured stars by the sharpness value of allstar routine in iraf .",
    "we rejected stars with an absolute value of sharpness larger than 0.2 as no point - like sources .",
    "the total number of the stars which were selected in both the @xmath2 and @xmath3 bands was 2910 and that in all the three bands was 1611 .",
    "we corrected vertical streaks due to bright stars by comparing adjacent columns .",
    "we calculated the surface brightness toward each pixel by taking the median value of 5 @xmath4 5 = 25 pixels centered at the pixel after subtraction of stars by using substar routine in iraf .",
    "the pixel area corresponds to 2.3 @xmath4 2.3 arcsec@xmath5 , and the error was estimated by standard deviation of the 25 pixels .",
    "the 3-sigma limiting fluxes for surface brightness were @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 @xmath12jy arcsec@xmath13 .",
    "surface brightness maps in the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 bands are shown in figure [ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "the values of @xmath6 toward the background stars are shown in figure [ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "the @xmath6 is estimated from the observed @xmath0 color of each background star by @xmath14 $ ] . the conversion factor between @xmath6 and the color excess",
    "is calculated from the theoretical curve no .",
    "15 of van de hulst ( 1946 , hereafter vdh ) . , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 bands toward the galactic center with irsf / sirius .",
    "the study used a number of red clump stars toward the galactic center region and the results are quite reliable .",
    "relations among the @xmath15 band and nir bands which are consistent with nishiyama et al .",
    "( 2006 ) are not yet obtained .",
    "the results of nishiyama et al .",
    "( 2006 ) are significantly different from the values of rieke & lebofsky ( 1985 ) but are close to ones calculated from the curve no.15 of vdh .",
    "thus , we adopted the curve no . 15 of vdh for calculations of factors for the conversions and extinction ratio in this paper . ] here , we set @xmath16 for all the background stars , which is the average value of those behind the lupus 3 dark cloud as estimated in nakajima et al .",
    "figure [ fig : fig3 ] shows a color - color diagram for the background stars whose fluxes were well determined in all the three bands . while the lupus 3 dark cloud is a low - mass star forming region , the observed field contains no stars which have a clear intrinsic color excess ; colors of all the stars can be explained by reddening of dwarfs or giants .",
    "we therefore assume that the color excess of the majority of the stars are totally due to extinction by dust , although stars without the @xmath1 magnitude have not been examined by the color - color diagram .",
    "we compared the observed @xmath0 color and the surface brightness in each band toward each background star .",
    "we show the results in figure [ fig : fig4 ] .",
    "we used only stars with the color error of @xmath17 mag and surface brightness ( i ) with flux error less than 0.002 mjy arcsec@xmath13 and ( ii ) with flux larger than the 3-sigma limiting flux at each band .",
    "there is a well defined relation between the observed @xmath0 color and the surface brightness for each band . a simple interpretation of the relation is as follows .",
    "forward scattering is dominant and we consider that the starlight behind the cloud is the main source of the surface brightness in this case .",
    "surface brightness has a peak where the column density has an adequate value so that there is enough amount of dust to scatter the incident background star light into diffuse light , while the scattered light suffers from only moderate extinction .",
    "surface brightness is faint where the column density is small , because incident light is less scattered and therefore is less turned into diffuse light .",
    "surface brightness is faint again where the column density is large , because incident light and scattered light suffer from heavy extinction .",
    "the value of @xmath0 for the peak surface brightness depends on the wavelength ; at longer wavelengths the peak surface brightness takes place at higher @xmath18 .",
    "the surface brightness is , technically , a result of complex processes among dust grains and incident starlight , which depend on optical characteristics of dust and cloud geometry . in the followings , however , we do not take such complex physical processes into account ; we consider the dark cloud as a _ black box _ and we try to obtain an empirical relationship between the observed @xmath0 color and the surface brightness for each band quantitatively and to estimate the column density based on the surface brightness toward any direction even without background stars .",
    "we consider a simple one - dimensional scattering model to make an adequate fitting function to obtain an empirical relationship .",
    "we assume that a dark cloud is illuminated uniformly from the behind of the cloud and forward scattering is dominant at the wavelengths .",
    "when a beam of intensity @xmath19 passes through scattering and absorbing material of thickness @xmath20 , the radiation transfer equation for isotropic scattering is generally given by @xmath21 here , @xmath22 is the absorption coefficient , @xmath23 is the scattering coefficient , and @xmath24 is the mean intensity within the scattering material . we replace @xmath24 with @xmath25 based on the assumptions of one - dimensional symmetry and strong forward scattering .",
    "here @xmath26 is the probability of radiation being scattered in the forward directions .",
    "if we define @xmath27 the whole radiation scattered in the forward directions , @xmath28 , contributes to the source term due to scattering . here ,",
    "@xmath29 and @xmath30 are cylindrical coordinates together with the axis parallel to @xmath19 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath26 equals to @xmath31",
    ". then we get @xmath32 here , @xmath33 is the total opacity and @xmath34 is the albedo .",
    "the observed intensity of scattered radiation is then @xmath35 exp(-\\tau_\\lambda ) .\\ ] ] here , @xmath36 is the average surface brightness of initial intensity of radiation of background stars and @xmath37 is optical depth along the line of sight .",
    "using the relationships @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 from the extinction curve no .",
    "15 of vdh , we write @xmath41 using @xmath0 .",
    "consequently , we get the following equation with two free parameters , @xmath36 and @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath43 -1 \\ } \\ exp [ -1 \\times \\alpha_\\lambda ( h - k_s - 0.15)]\\ ] ] here , @xmath44 is @xmath45 and equals to 4.04 , 2.35 and 1.46 for @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "we set @xmath16 for this equation as well as noted above .",
    "the parameter @xmath42 represents the product of @xmath26 and @xmath46 .",
    "we obtained plausible fittings to the @xmath0 and surface brightness relationship with the equation ( 5 ) .",
    "the fitting parameters were summarized in table [ tab : first ] .",
    "the thick curve denotes the best fit for each band in figure [ fig : fig4 ] .",
    "we calculated standard deviation of the surface brightness from the best fit curve for each band and obtained 0.001 mjy arcsec@xmath13 for all the band .",
    "the upper and lower thin curves denote the best fit curve @xmath47 0.001 mjy arcsec@xmath13 .",
    "we consider that the area between the two thin curves defines the empirical relationship between the surface brightness and @xmath0 , i.e. , dust column density , in the diagram for each band .     and surface brightness toward background stars at @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 .",
    "colors of the points denote number density of the plot in the diagram ; blue , green , yellow , orange , red , and black from low to high .",
    "the 3-sigma limiting fluxes are indicated by dashed lines . ]    .fitting parameters . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]      we made a simple one - dimensional formula with two parameters . in reality , however , the observed cloud is not one - dimensional , and the scattered source term in the equation ( 3 ) is to be altered according to the local cloud density structure and radiation field . in this study ,",
    "the derivation of column densities is essentially empirical .",
    "the fitted values of the parameters do not necessarily match the actual physical parameters : intensity of background radiation and dust properties . here , we examine the fitted values .",
    "we compared the fitting parameter @xmath36 and the average surface brightness from the background stars for each band .",
    "we made a @xmath3 band luminosity function of the point sources with @xmath48 mag , in which magnitude was de - reddened by @xmath49 .",
    "the log of the luminosity function is well fitted by a power - law in the magnitude range of @xmath50 .",
    "we calculated a total flux from the de - reddened @xmath3 magnitude between @xmath50 . in order to correct the total flux by taking the fainter stars into account",
    ", we also estimated the flux contributed by background stars with @xmath51 by integrating the power - law fitting function .",
    "then we divided the total flux by the area of @xmath52 which is estimated by the @xmath6 map in figure 5 .",
    "the color of @xmath53 corresponds to @xmath54 mag .",
    "we obtained 0.011 mjy arcsec@xmath13 , with an uncertainty of a factor of 2 , as the average flux at @xmath3 from the background stars .",
    "similarly , we estimated the average flux at @xmath2 to be 0.011 mjy arcsec@xmath13 . thus",
    ", the fitting parameter @xmath36 is consistent with the average flux from the background stars in the @xmath2 and @xmath3 band .",
    "we could not obtain a meaningful value of the average flux for the @xmath1 band , because the number of the stars with @xmath55 mag is too small and the luminosity function was not fitted by a power - law function .",
    "the parameter @xmath42 is a product of @xmath46 and @xmath26 : the albedo and the probability of radiation being scattered into the forward direction .",
    "both @xmath46 and @xmath26 range between 0 and 1 .",
    "the resultant values of @xmath560.81 - 0.89 means that both the parameters have values close to the upper limit .",
    "this is consistent with large albedo obtained in nakajima et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "padoan et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and juvela et al .",
    "( 2006 , 2008 ) developed a new method of mapping column density of dark cloud using nir scattered light .",
    "this paper is based on the similar considerations ; however , this paper has some new aspects .",
    "our method uses an empirical formula whose parameters are directly calibrated by the color excess of the background stars , while the previous studies used an analytic formula and used an extinction map derived from the color excess just for comparison as an independent tracer .",
    "we do not use a smoothed extinction map but the color excess of individual stars for comparison with the surface brightness toward each star .",
    "the use of individual background stars avoids the problems with the bias when there are few background stars ( juvela et al .",
    "2008 ) . by adopting a different formula",
    ", our method covers a part beyond the point where surface brightness starts to decrease with increasing column density , while the previous studies did for only the non - saturated part of the relation .",
    "when this method is applied to other clouds , the fitting parameters should be determined for each cloud .",
    "the fitting parameters for each band in the equation ( 5 ) can be different among dark clouds .",
    "the parameter @xmath57 represents the average surface brightness of background stars , which depends on the galactic coordinates .",
    "the parameter @xmath42 represents optical property of dust grain in the cloud , which can be different among the clouds .",
    "teixeira , lada , & alves ( 2005 ) made an extinction map toward the lupus 3 dark cloud with the @xmath0 color of the background stars . while their map generally agrees with ours ( see their figure 2 and 6 ) in their smoothing scale , 30 and 40 arcsec , the map failed to trace the core c ( the core e in their paper ) properly due to the lack of stars .",
    "we constructed an empirical relationship equation between the surface brightness and column density of the lupus 3 dark cloud for each @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 band . by using the equations",
    ", we obtained a column density map with a pixel scale of 2.3 @xmath4 2.3 arcsec@xmath5 and a large dynamic range up to @xmath6 = 50 mag of the cloud from the nir surface brightness .",
    "we expect the empirical method to be one of the new tools of column density mapping of dark clouds .",
