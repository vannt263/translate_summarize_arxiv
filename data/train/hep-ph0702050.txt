    "the recent measurements for the @xmath0 mass difference from the d  @xcite and cdf @xcite collaborations given by [ bsmix ] 17ps^-1 < m_s^exp < 21ps^-1  , + m_s^exp = ( 17.77 0.10 0.07 ) ps^-1  , have triggered to probe new physics effects in @xmath3 transition .",
    "although the experimental results are consistent with prediction of the standard model ( sm ) dominated by the @xmath4quark exchange in the @xmath5 box diagram , they do not fully exclude all the possible new physics effects in @xmath6 transitions .",
    "since flavor changing @xmath7 transitions are very sensitive to new physics , it is worthwhile to probe them through the @xmath0 mixing phenomena @xcite .",
    "moreover , the combined analysis of the @xmath0 mixing and the @xmath8 mixing may provide clearer hint on the existence of new physics in flavor changing transitions , due to a possible cancellation of hadronic uncertainties .",
    "probing such a possibility of new physics in flavor changing transitions is the main purpose of this work . as a concrete example of physics beyond the sm",
    ", we will consider the supersymmetric grand unified model ( susy gut ) with heavy right - handed neutrinos where the imprint of large atmospheric neutrino mixing may appear in the squark mass matrices . in this model",
    "large dirac neutrino yukawa couplings can induce large off - diagonal mixing in the right - handed down type squark mass matrix , and there can exist possible correlation between quark flavor changing processes and lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) decays , @xmath9 . here",
    "we want to test such new physics in @xmath10 processes in the susy gut , to find out the correlated new physics effects in lfv decays as a function of branching fractions of @xmath9 .",
    "we examine in detail how new physics effects in @xmath2 mixing phenomena are correlated with the branching fractions of the lfv decays . comparing our analysis with future measurements of the branching fractions of lfv decays",
    "may serve as a test of the supersymmetric grand unified model .",
    "recently , the similar idea has been proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite : the authors have studied a correlation between @xmath11 mixing and lfv decay @xmath12 by assuming that there is no new physics effects in @xmath13 mixing and some arbitrary mixing term in the slepton mixing matrix . however , in our approach , we consider not only such a correlation but also the correlation among the ratio of new physics contributions to @xmath13 and @xmath11 mixings and the corresponding ratio of the branching fractions of lfv decay @xmath14 .",
    "thus , our approach is less dependent on arbitrary susy input parameters and may also reduce the hadronic uncertainties in those processes .",
    "moreover , interestingly enough , our analysis can lead to an implication of new physics effects in the quark - lepton complementarity @xcite between the solar neutrino mixing angle and cabibbo angle , as will be shown later .",
    "in general , the @xmath15 mass difference is defined as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the effective hamiltonian responsible for the @xmath18 transition , and the sm prediction @xcite is given by _",
    "12^sm(b_q)= m_b_q^b_b_q f^2_b_q(v^_tqv_tb)^2l_0(x_t ) , where @xmath19 is the fermi constant , @xmath20 , @xmath21 is an `` inami - lim '' function @xcite , @xmath22 is a short - distant qcd correction , and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are non - perturbative parameters from which main theoretical uncertainties arise .    due to",
    "the hadronic uncertainties in the sm prediction for @xmath25 , various estimates of the sm values of @xmath26 have come out so far consistent . in order to estimate the sm values of @xmath26 , in particular , we adopt the following two results for the input hadronic parameters , @xmath27 .",
    "the first one is from the most recent ( unquenched ) simulation by jlqcd collaboration@xcite , with non - relativistic @xmath28 quark and two flavors of dynamical light quarks . the second one is from combined results , denoted by ( hp+jl)qcd .",
    "lacking any direct calculation of @xmath29 with three dynamical flavors , it has been suggested to combine the results of @xmath23 from hpqcd collaboration@xcite with that of @xmath29 from jlqcd .",
    "then , two numerical results for @xmath26 are given by @xcite [ eq : dmd : sm ] m_d^sm & = & ps^-1 + & = & ps^-1 , [ eq : dms : sm ] m_s^sm & = & ps^-1 + & = & ps^-1 .",

    "as is well known , supersymmetric standard model ( ssm ) is one of the most motivated candidates for new physics beyond the standard model . in supersymmetric theories ,",
    "the effective hamiltonian @xmath35 receives new contributions through the box diagrams mediated by gluino , chargino , neutralino , and charged higgs .",
    "it turns out that gluino exchanges give the dominant contributions @xcite .",
    "it is widely accepted that the mass - insertion approximation in which only terms with off diagonal elements of squark and slepton mass matrices are considered is profitable to treat the supersymmetric contributions to flavor changing neutral current processes . in the mass - insertion approximation , the gluino contribution to the amplitude of @xmath11 oscillation is given in terms of the ratio of the gluino mass @xmath36 to the average squark mass @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and the down squark mass insertions between second and third generations , @xmath39 , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 stand for left ( @xmath42 ) or right ( @xmath43 ) handed mixing .",

    "we also obtain similar expression for @xmath54 by replacing @xmath55 with @xmath56 in eq .",
    "( [ rs ] ) . here , we note that the @xmath57 contributions @xmath58 are strongly constrained by the measurement of @xmath59 decay , and thus those contributions should be very small . from now on",
    ", we will ignore the @xmath57 contributions to @xmath60 , and thus @xmath61 is approximately expressed by r_s & & a_1[(^d_ll)^2_23+(^d_rr)^2_23 ] + a_4[(^d_ll)_23(^d_rr)_23 ] , + r_d & & a_1[(^d_ll)^2_13+(^d_rr)^2_13 ] + a_4[(^d_ll)_13(^d_rr)_13 ] .",
    "[ relllrr ] we also note that the values of the corresponding coefficients @xmath62 in @xmath63 are very similar to those in @xmath64 .",
    "it was pointed out in @xcite that large angles in the neutrino sector may imply large mixing among right - handed down - type quarks if they are grand unified with lepton doublets , and the imprint of the large atmospheric neutrino mixing angle may appear in the squark mass matrices as a large @xmath65 mixing effect through radiative corrections due to the large top yukawa coupling .    in ssm with the right - handed neutrino singlets accounting for the data on neutrino oscillation , it is known that large neutrino dirac yukawa couplings can induce large off - diagonal mixings in the right - handed down - type squark mass matrix through renormalization group evolution .",
    "those mixings can be parameterized as @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the average right - handed down - type squark mass",
    ". in particular , the large @xmath65 mixing generated in turn feeds into new physics effects in @xmath41 physics , and thus there may be large enhanced @xmath11 mixing . as shown in susy su(5 ) , the off - diagonal elements in the mass matrix of the down - type squarks can be generated through rg running , and is approximately given by @xcite ( m^2__rr)_ij-(y^_y_)_ij ( 3m_0 ^ 2+a_0 ^ 2 ) , [ lfv ] where @xmath68 and @xmath69 stand for the universal scalar mass and the universal @xmath40-parameter for the soft susy breaking , @xmath70 for the scale where the universality of the scalar mass is imposed and @xmath71 denotes the su(5 ) breaking scale .",
    "then , @xmath72 and @xmath73 contribute to @xmath11 and @xmath13 mixing , respectively .    from the experimental results for @xmath74 and their sm predictions",
    ", one can extract the allowed regions of the parameters @xmath75 and @xmath34 by using eq .",
    "( [ relrdelta ] ) . using these constraints for @xmath75",
    ", we can extract useful information on the relevant lfv radiative decays in susy gut context .",
    "let us discuss how the new physics effects extracted from measurements of the @xmath76 mixing can be related to the lepton flavor violation in the context of susy gut . in the case that the @xmath77 contribution to @xmath78 dominates over the others in eq .",
    "( [ rs ] ) , the new physics contributions to @xmath78 are approximately given by r_s & & a_1(^d_rr)^2_23 , + r_d & & a_1(^d_rr)^2_13 . since the term @xmath79 is proportional to @xmath80 in susy gut , we can obtain the following simple relation ,  .",
    "[ r - ratio ] therefore , the origin of new physics effects in the @xmath76 mixing is from the susy seesaw in this case .",
    "on the other hand , the susy seesaw model we consider can lead to sizable effects on the lfv processes such as @xmath81 due to the new source of lepton flavor violation arisen from the misalignment of lepton and slepton mass matrices , and the branching ratios of the lfv decays depend on the specific structure of the neutrino dirac yukawa matrix . in the context of susy gut , this mixing in the charged lepton sector is dictated as same as that of the down type quark sector in eq .",
    "( [ lfv ] ) .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the lfv processes in susy gut models can provide a probe of quark - lepton unification .",
    "thus , combining the idea proposed in @xcite with the analysis based on @xmath76 mixing , we can further probe quark - lepton unification .",
    "the contribution to the branching fractions of the lfv decays due to the slepton mass term is roughly given by @xcite br(l_il_j ) |(^d_rr)_ij|^2 ^2 , where @xmath82 is a supersymmetric leptonic scalar mass scale and we used a rough gut relation , @xmath83 .",
    "we remark that such a gut relationship for the parameter @xmath84 s must be corrected down to the typical mass scale of the right - handed majorana neutrinos @xmath85 because the slepton mass term gets additional corrections due to rg evolution . however , in general , such rg effects as well as corrections from rg evolution down to @xmath86 do not significantly modify the gut relations for off diagonal elements @xmath87 presented at @xmath71 s due to large change from rg evolution @xcite .",
    "those cases are not relevant to our work . ] and , furthermore , the logarithmic scale dependence is suppressed in the ratio of branching fractions of lfv processes .",
    "relating eq .",
    "( [ r - ratio ] ) to the expression for @xmath88 , we can derive the following simple relation | | .",
    "[ relrr1 ] therefore , using the experimentally allowed regions of @xmath89 , we can predict the ratio of the corresponding lfv processes .",
    "however , recent work reported that the susy models with the dominant @xmath77 mixing would be disfavored by the @xmath90 constraints @xcite .",
    "in fact , the @xmath91 squark mixing receives renormalization group ( rg ) effects through the ckm matrix .",
    "the evolution from @xmath70 to the weak scale @xmath86 leads to the @xmath91 mixings such as [ dll23:rg ] ( ^d_ll)_23-y^2_tv_ts , + [ dll13:rg ] ( ^d_ll)_13-y^2_tv_td , where @xmath92 is the top quark yukawa coupling , @xmath68 is the typical soft susy scale .",
    "it is known that the rg evolution from the gut scale in supergravity scenario induces @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",

    "<S> motivated by the recent measurements of the @xmath0 mass difference from the d  and cdf collaborations , we probe new physics effects in the @xmath1 mixing within the context of the supersymmetric grand unified model ( susy gut ) . we find that new physics effects in @xmath2 mixing lead to the correlated information in the branching fractions of the lepton flavor violating decays , which may serve as a test of the susy gut . </S>",
