    "the interest of semi - inclusive hadron production in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) on nuclear targets is at least twofold .",
    "first , and on rather general grounds , this reaction should help us to understand how a given qcd medium affects the non - perturbative hadronization mechanism .",
    "in particular , the use of nuclei   with a size @xmath5 of a few fm   provides a direct information on the soft time scales @xmath6 involved in the dynamics of hadronization . in the second place",
    ", such a process also allows one to gain a quantitative insight into the scattering properties of cold nuclear matter .",
    "these may serve as a baseline to which properties of hot qcd media should be contrasted .",
    "this is clearly an important issue in high energy heavy ion physics where the quark gluon plasma is expected to be formed .",
    "measurements of semi - inclusive hadron electroproduction on nuclei were performed a decade ago by the european muon collaboration ( emc ) experiment who reported a significant attenuation of charged hadron spectra in copper as compared to deuterium targets  @xcite .",
    "this was a strong indication that quark fragmentation functions get modified in a nuclear environment ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : multdis ] ) ) but the atomic mass number , hence rather reflected the nuclear modifications of parton densities ( see discussion in section  [ se : xs ] ) .",
    "for this reason , these data are not considered in the present study . ] .",
    "more recently , the hermes collaboration at desy reported on high statistics measurements of charged hadron ( @xmath7 ) , pion ( @xmath8 ) , kaon ( @xmath9 ) , proton and antiproton ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) electroproduction on several nuclei ( deuterium , nitrogen , neon , krypton ) and on a wide kinematic acceptance  @xcite .",
    "these two data sets make quantitative analyses possible .",
    "several suggestions have been advanced so far to account for the experimental results .",
    "models based on the nuclear absorption of the produced hadron  @xcite , gluon bremsstrahlung  @xcite , or partial deconfinement in nuclei  @xcite , were shown to describe the trend of the data fairly well . following wang and wang  @xcite",
    ", we shall assume here that the observed hadron quenching actually comes from the energy loss incurred by hard quarks traveling through the nuclear medium .",
    "although the effects of quark energy loss in dis on nuclear targets have already been investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite , a more complete analysis of emc and hermes data is still lacking .",
    "this is the aim of the present study .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "hadron electroproduction in nuclei is computed to leading order in the coupling constant ( section  [ se : xs ] ) using nuclear fragmentation functions modeled in section  [ se : nff ] .",

    "the starting point to determine the hadron attenuation @xmath47 is therefore the computation of nuclear fragmentation functions @xmath48 .",

    "the theoretical computations eq .",

    "however , the hard quark suffers multiple scattering and radiates soft gluons all along its path .",
    "due to this medium - induced gluon radiation , the quark energy is reduced from @xmath49 to @xmath50 at the time of hadronization .",
    "this picture is schematically depicted in figure  [ fig : model ] .",
    "how to relate these final state interactions to nuclear fragmentation functions remains however unclear .",
    "such an attempt has been performed recently in a series of papers  @xcite in which a higher - twist perturbative framework has been applied successfully to describe hadron production in dis and heavy ion reactions .    here , we shall rather adopt the effective model suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite . within this approach",
    ", the quark energy shift leads to a rescaling of the momentum fraction in presence of a qcd medium , @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the measured hadron energy and @xmath53 the energy lost by the hard quark while going through the nucleus .",

    "it should already be kept in mind , however , that this value could not be determined with a high accuracy ( @xmath79  gev/@xmath76 ) because of the large statistical errors in the drell - yan measurements .    as we shall discuss later",

    "figure  [ fig : nuntkr ] ( upper panel ) indicates that the quenching of charged hadrons on nitrogen is extremely well reproduced by our predictions , while the calculations slightly overestimate the attenuation in the pion ( isospin averaged ) sector .",
    "it should be noted that the stronger pion quenching @xmath112 reflects only the different acceptance acceptance .",
    "pions were measured with @xmath113 while a cut @xmath114 has been applied to the charged hadron channel . ] in the hermes experiment . in the kr target ,",
    "the suppression of charged hadrons is again well described by the calculations .",
    "the trend predicted in the pion channel in kr is close to what is observed experimentally , although the absolute magnitude of the pion quenching slightly underestimates the data ( @xmath115 ) .",
    "perhaps more interesting are the hermes preliminary measurements on kaon quenching in krypton , @xmath116 ( figure  [ fig : nuntkr ] , lower panel ) . a significantly larger depletion is observed in @xmath117 production on the whole energy range , @xmath118 . furthermore , this noticeable isospin dependence in the kaon sector is apparent in the theoretical predictions as well .",
    "it is indeed clear from eqs .",

    "nevertheless , the rather small differences between the dashed and solid curves indicate that the krypton nucleus ( a=84 ) is not too large to probe the hadronization _ in _ the medium .",
    "more pronounced effects are expected in heavier nuclei .",
    "finally , hadron attenuation has been computed on a neon target ( figure  [ fig : nunexe ] , _ upper panel _ ) measured very recently by the hermes collaboration  @xcite .",

    "this feature was already present , although less pronounced , in the comparison with krypton measurements .",
    "the underestimate of the slopes of the flavor - tagged @xmath129 fragmentation functions , poorly constrained by @xmath130 data , may be at the origin of this discrepancy  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the assumption made in ref .  @xcite that the sea type channels ( e.g. @xmath131 ) get suppressed by one extra power in @xmath132 ( see discussion above ) seems to be disfavored by experimental data on kaon production  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : nunexe ] ( lower panel ) also displays our predictions on xenon nuclei ( a=131 ) , in which formation time effects get larger .",
    "as later stressed in the discussion section , measurements in such a heavy nucleus will be of crucial importance to disentangle the possible various mechanisms responsible for the observed hadron attenuation .",
    "another way to probe the dynamics of hadronization in a nuclear medium is to look at the @xmath1 dependence of hadron quenching . in our calculations",
    ", we expect a stronger hadron quenching as @xmath1 increases for two reasons .",
    "first , as can been seen from the rough estimate eq .",
    "( [ eq : suppdis_approx2 ] ) , the slope of the fragmentation functions increases with @xmath1 , and thus so does the attenuation @xmath108 .",
    "the second reason that leads to significant hadron depletion at large @xmath1 actually comes from the restricted phase space .",
    "measuring hadrons with large momentum fraction @xmath1 selects on those ( rare ) fragmenting quarks that have lost a tiny amount of energy .",
    "assuming for simplicity that the fragmentation functions are flat , @xmath133 , the quenching factor may be approximated by @xmath134 which vanishes as @xmath1 approaches 1 .",
    "let us note however that the ratio ( [ eq : ps ] ) will tend to a constant @xmath135 in the parton energy loss frameworks developed by gyulassy , lvai , vitev  @xcite and wiedemann  @xcite in which the quenching weight @xmath64 contains a discrete part , @xmath136  @xcite .",
    "similar behavior is also observed within the bdmps formalism when ultra soft gluons are removed from the perturbative spectrum  @xcite .    .",

    ", high energy quarks hadronize well after escaping the nucleus in this whole @xmath1 range .    on the contrary",
    ", we do observe huge formation time effects in the hermes data which are taken at much lower energy @xmath138@xmath139  gev ( figure  [ fig : zntkr ] ) .",
    "the predictions fairly reproduce the hermes measurements for all hadron species when @xmath1 is not too high . at large @xmath140 , nevertheless , the discrepancy between the predictions assuming @xmath101 ( dashed lines ) and the data is striking .",
    "as discussed above , the hadron attenuation @xmath141 falls too steeply as @xmath1 goes to one , unlike the experimental results .",
    "this does not come as a surprise as we have already anticipated in the latter section that this assumption is no longer justified since @xmath142 .    when the realistic length eq .",
    "( [ eq : meanl ] ) is used , the typical scale @xmath143 is getting smaller and weakens the quark energy loss   and subsequently the hadron attenuation   as @xmath1 increases .",
    "this effect somehow compensates the quenching due to the slope of the fragmentation functions ( [ eq : suppdis_approx2 ] ) and to phase space restriction ( [ eq : ps ] ) at moderate @xmath1 , and eventually takes over at @xmath144 ( see figure  [ fig : zntkr ] ) .",
    "this non - monotonic behavior of the hadron depletion is actually a manifestation of the quadratic behavior of the parton energy loss in qcd media .",
    "we may indeed convince ourselves of this by replacing the energy loss @xmath145 in the rough estimate ( [ eq : suppdis_approx2 ] ) .",

    "the 3.3% systematic errors are not shown . ]",
    "let us finally stress that theoretical uncertainties might get large in the high @xmath146 region .",
    "in particular , important higher twist corrections may come into play in this restricted region of phase space  @xcite , given moreover the fact that the typical values @xmath147  gev@xmath148 measured in these reactions are pretty small .",
    "moreover , the resummation of soft and collinear gluons leads to large contributions @xmath149 in the fragmentation functions  @xcite which are not taken into account in the leading order analysis  @xcite we use here .",
    "the nuclear dependence of semi - inclusive hadron production in dis comes in our calculations from the sole effect of the quark energy loss in nuclei .",
    "of course , many other mechanisms , which have not been considered here , could play a role in the hadron quenching observed experimentally . the absorption of the ( pre)hadrons produced in the medium may for instance substantially affect its production  @xcite .",
    "this will be particularly true at large @xmath1 and/or small @xmath0 when the formation time is small .",
    "it was also stressed that the partial deconfinement which could occur in large nuclei rescales the fragmentation functions and eventually suppress the hadron yields  @xcite .",
    "however , although such effects have not been taken into account here , a very nice description of the emc and more recent hermes preliminary data for several hadron species and various nuclei is still achieved .",
    "the already good agreement assuming only energy loss effects in our approach is therefore a hint that the above mentioned competing processes play a rather modest role .",
    "let us moderate this statement .",
    "the strength of each of these mechanisms is governed by one parameter which is in general poorly constrained .",
    "take the quark energy loss for instance .",
    "we have used here the transport coefficient for nuclear matter @xmath150",
    "gev/@xmath76 extracted from drell - yan data , whose absolute magnitude is not known with a great accuracy .",
    "similarly , the nuclear absorption strongly depends on the pre - hadron cross section @xmath151 about which little is known .",
    "it is therefore a delicate matter to disentangle these various processes .",
    "we suggest a couple of observables which may help us in this prospect .",
    "first , we have seen that the mean length @xmath152 , hence the scale @xmath73 , becomes independent of @xmath5 when the nuclear radius is large , @xmath153 .",
    "the effects of quark energy loss on hadron quenching thus somehow saturates when the nuclei are sufficiently heavy .",
    "this can already be seen from the comparison of the rather similar hadron quenching in kr and xe targets , @xmath154 ( figures  [ fig : zntkr ] and [ fig : znexe ] , solid lines ) .",
    "it is clearly at variance with the absorption models which predict of course a much stronger attenuation as the nucleus gets larger .",
    "we therefore predict that the ratio of hadron depletion in two large nuclei ( say , xe / kr ) will provide a good measurement of hadron absorption , _",
    "only_. inversely , hadron quenching in small nuclei could help to constrain the transport coefficient in nuclear matter , without being spoiled by hadronic absorption .",
    "fitting @xmath3 to the charged hadron and pion quenching in nitrogen and neon data , we found @xmath155  gev/@xmath76 and @xmath156  gev/@xmath76 , respectively , in excellent agreement with the drell - yan estimate , eq .",
    "( [ eq : qhat ] ) , which suffered from a larger statistical uncertainty .    we also think that the isospin dependence of the kaon quenching could be important . as already mentioned , a similar attenuation ratio @xmath157 is expected at small @xmath36 if quark energy proves the most relevant mechanism at work .",
    "on the contrary , a stronger @xmath117 quenching should still be observed in the framework of absorption models from the larger interaction of negative kaons .",
    "the @xmath32 dependence ( at a given @xmath0 ) of the ratio @xmath158 may thus clarify the relevant underlying processes .    to conclude ,",
    "a leading order calculation of semi - inclusive hadron production in dis on nuclei has been performed .",
    "the fragmentation functions were modified to take into account the energy loss incurred by hard quarks while they propagate through the nuclear medium .",
    "the quenching of hadron spectra was then compared to the emc and hermes preliminary data in several nuclear targets , as a function @xmath0 and @xmath1 . using the transport coefficient determined from drell - yan production , a nice agreement between our predictions and the experimental measurements",
    "is observed for the various hadron species . in particular",
    ", we emphasized that hadron production in small nuclei may help us to determine and constrain what the transport coefficient ( hence the quark energy loss ) of nuclear matter is .",
    "measurements of semi - inclusive hadron production in heavy nuclei are highly desirable since , in addition to be a sensitive probe of formation time effects , these prove crucial to disentangle quark energy loss on the one hand from hadron absorption on the other hand .",
    "finally , it should be interesting to constrain , from the hermes and emc data , the rapidity dependence of the quenching of charged hadron and pion hadroproduction inclusive spectra in deuteron - gold collisions at rhic energy  @xcite .",
