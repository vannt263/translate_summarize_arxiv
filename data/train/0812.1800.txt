    "filaments are the most prominent features visible in the galaxy distribution .",
    "this finding dates back to a few papers in the seventies and eighties @xcite .",
    "subsequent work substantiates this ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and shows the filaments to be statistically significant @xcite .",
    "it is now well accepted that galaxies are distributed in an interconnected network of clusters , sheets and filaments encircling voids .",
    "this complicated pattern is often referred to as the cosmic web . despite this progress",
    ", it still remains a challenge to quantify the cosmic web that is so distinctly visible in galaxy redshift surveys ( eg .",
    "sdss dr5 , @xcite ) .",
    "statistical measures like the void probability function @xcite , percolation analysis @xcite and the genus curve @xcite each quantifies a different aspect of the cosmic web .",
    "the minkowski functionals @xcite are very effective to quantify the shapes of individual structural elements like sheets or filaments . in @xmath5 dimensions",
    "there are @xmath10 minkowski functionals , namely the volume , surface area , integrated mean curvature and integrated gaussian curvature .",
    "@xcite introduce the shapefinders , essentially ratios of the minkowski functionals , as a very effective shape diagnostic . a @xmath6 dimensional version of shapefinders @xcite has been extensively used to quantify the filamentarity in the galaxy distribution ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "centered on a galaxy located in the filament.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    though the minkowski functionals and the shapefinders are very effective techniques to quantify the shapes of individual structural elements like sheets or filaments , it is very different when dealing with the cosmic web which is an interconnected network of filaments , sheets and clusters .",
    "for example consider a sheet connected to a filament as shown in figure [ fig : exp1 ] .",
    "the minkowski functionals are global properties of the entire object",
    "the area is the sum of the areas of the sheet and the filament etc . , and",
    "the fact that object is actually a combination of two different elements would be lost .",
    "it is necessary to quantify the local shape at different points in the object in order to determine that it actually is a combination of a sheet and a filament . in this paper",
    "we consider the `` local dimension '' as a means to quantify the local shape of the galaxy distribution at different positions along the cosmic web .",
    "we choose a particular galaxy as center and determine @xmath2 the number of other galaxies within a sphere of comoving radius @xmath3 .",
    "this is done varying @xmath3 . in the situation where a power law @xmath11 gives a good fit over the length - scales @xmath12",
    ", we identify @xmath0 as the local dimension in the neighbourhood of the center .",
    "the values @xmath13 and @xmath5 correspond to a filament , sheet and cluster respectively .",
    "it may be noted that the term `` cluster '' here denotes a three dimensional , volume filling structural element and is not to be confused with a `` cluster of galaxies '' .",
    "values of @xmath0 other than @xmath14 and @xmath5 are more difficult to interpret .",
    "for example , a galaxy distribution that is more diffuse than a filament but does not fill a plane would give a fractional value ( fractal ) in the range @xmath15 . referring to figure [ fig : exp1 ]",
    ", we expect @xmath16 and @xmath17 when the center is located in the filament and the sheet respectively .",
    "this is provided that the center is well away from the intersection of the filament and the sheet .",
    "when the intersection lies within @xmath12 from the center , there will be a change in the slope of @xmath2 when it crosses the intersection .",
    "it is not possible to determine a local dimension at the centers where such a situation occurs .",
    "we perform this analysis using every galaxy in the sample as a center . in general",
    "it will be possible to determine a local dimension for only a fraction of the galaxies .",
    "it is expected that with a suitable choice of the @xmath3 range _ ie .",
    "_ @xmath18 and @xmath19 , it will be possible to determine the local dimension for a substantial number of the centers .",
    "the value of the local dimension at different positions will indicate the location of the filaments , sheets and clusters and reveal how these are woven into the cosmic web .    in this _",
    "letter _ we test this idea and demonstrate its utility by applying it to simulations .",
    "we have used a particle - mesh ( pm ) n - body code to simulate the @xmath20 dark matter distribution .",
    "the simulations have @xmath21 particles on a @xmath21 mesh with grid spacing @xmath22 .",
    "the simulations were carried out using a lcdm power spectrum with the parameters @xmath23 .",
    "we have identified @xmath24 particles , randomly drawn from the simulation output , as galaxies . these have a mean interparticle separation of @xmath25 , comparable to that in galaxy surveys .",
    "this simulated galaxy distribution was carried over to redshift space in the plane parallel approximation . the subsequent analysis to determine the local dimension",
    "was carried out using this simulated sample of @xmath24 galaxies . since the resolution of the simulation is about @xmath26 , we ca nt choose @xmath18 to be less than that .",
    "the value of @xmath19 is determined by the limited box size .",
    "we have chosen the value of @xmath18 and @xmath19 to be @xmath6 and @xmath27 respectively .",
    "increasing @xmath19 causes a considerable drop in the number of centers for which the local dimension is defined .",
    "the analysis was carried out for @xmath28 different , independent realizations of the dark matter distribution .",
    "figure [ fig : exp2 ] shows @xmath2 for three different centers chosen from a particular realization .",
    "the @xmath29 error at each data point is @xmath30 due to the poisson fluctuation .",
    "for each center we have determined the power law @xmath1 that provides the best fit to the data .",
    "the power law fit is accepted if the chi - square per degree of freedom satisfies @xmath31 and the value of @xmath0 is accepted as the local dimension corresponding to the particular center .",
    "the power law fit is rejected for larger values of @xmath32 , and the local dimension is undetermined for the particular center .",
    "the criteria @xmath31 is chosen as a compromise between a good power law fit and a reasonably large number of centers for which @xmath0 can been determined .",
    "the number of centers for which @xmath0 can been determined falls if a more stringent criteria is imposed on @xmath32 .",
    "of a center with @xmath9 are shown as points .",
    "the galaxy distribution was converted to a set of 1s and 0s on a grid of spacing @xmath33 .",
    "connected structures were identified using the friend - of - friend algorithm where adjacent 1s are identified as belonging to the same connected structure . only the two largest structures have been shown , both pass very close to the center and they appear connected in the figure .",
    "the @xmath0 values have been painted on these structures with red , blue and green representing @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively .",
    "the @xmath0 value is undetermined for the parts of the structures shown in black . ]",
    "the number of centers for which it is possible to determine a local dimension varies between @xmath34 to @xmath35 _ ie . _",
    "less than @xmath36 variation across the @xmath28 different realizations .",
    "the @xmath0 values in the interval @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 have respectively been binned as @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "we have inspected the galaxy distribution in the vicinity of a few centers in order to visually identify the structures corresponding to the respective @xmath0 values .",
    "figure [ fig : fil1n ] shows the galaxy distribution within @xmath7 of a center which has local dimension @xmath40 .",
    "we expect this center to be located in a filament .",
    "we have used the friend - of - friend algorithm with linking length @xmath41 to identify connected patterns in the galaxy distribution .",
    "we note that all the galaxies in this region connect up into a single structure if the linking length is doubled to @xmath42 . using @xmath41 yields several disconnected structures of which",
    "we show only the largest two .",
    "both the structures pass close to the center , and appear connected in the figure .",
    "of the two structures , one with two well separated tentacles appears below the center , whereas the other with two nearly connected tentacles appears above it .",
    "the filamentary nature of these structures is quite evident . out of the total @xmath43 galaxies in these two structures",
    ", @xmath0 is undetermined for @xmath44 .",
    "there are @xmath45 galaxies with @xmath46 , all located in a contiguous region near the center , and @xmath47 and @xmath48 galaxies with @xmath49 and @xmath5 respectively spread out along the structure at locations quite different from the center . while it is relatively easy to visually identify the filament corresponding to the centers with @xmath50 , we have not been able to visually identify the sheets and clusters corresponding to the centers with @xmath49 and @xmath5 shown in figure [ fig : fil1n ] .",
    "we note that a visual identification of the sheets and clusters corresponding to @xmath51 and @xmath5 respectively has been possible in other fields where the largest structure is predominantly sheetlike or clusterlike .",
    "it is quite apparent that the largest structure in figure [ fig : fil1n ] is predominantly filamentary .",
    "values in a box of size @xmath52 ^ 3 $ ] , red , blue and green denote @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively . ]",
    "figure [ fig : allshown ] shows the distribution of @xmath0 values over a large region from one of the realizations .",
    "the distribution shows distinct patterns , there being regions with size ranging from a few @xmath53 to tens of @xmath54 where the @xmath0 value is constant .",
    "the centers with @xmath9 appear to have a more dense and compact distribution compared to the centers with @xmath51 , whereas the centers with @xmath55 appear to have a rather diffuse distribution .",
    "figure [ fig : hist1 ] separately quantifies two different aspects of the distribution of @xmath0 values , ( a. ) the fraction of centers with a particular @xmath0 value , and ( b. ) the fraction of volume with a particular @xmath0 value . for this analysis the @xmath0 values were divided into bins of width @xmath56 and the centers for which a @xmath0 value could not be determined were discarded .",
    "we find that the fraction of centers and the volume fraction both have very robust statistics with a variation of @xmath57 or less across the @xmath28 different realizations .",
    "we first consider the distribution of the fraction of centers with different @xmath0 values .",
    "the bin at @xmath58 contains the maximum number of centers , and the two bins at @xmath58 and @xmath6 together contain more than @xmath59 of the centers .",
    "this indicates that the maximum number of centers for which @xmath0 can be determined lie in sheets and filaments . assuming that this is representative of the entire matter distribution , we conclude that the bulk of the matter is contained in sheets and filaments , with the sheets dominating .",
    "we next consider the the fraction of volume occupied by a particular @xmath0 value .",
    "we have estimated this using a mesh with grid spacing @xmath60 .",
    "each grid position was assigned the @xmath0 value of the centers within the corresponding grid cell .",
    "cells that contain centers with different values of @xmath0 were discarded .",
    "it was possible to assign a @xmath0 value to @xmath61 grid cells .",
    "we find that the distribution peaks at @xmath62 , the peak is rather broad and more than @xmath59 of the volume for which it was possible to assign a @xmath0 value is occupied by values in the range @xmath6 to @xmath5 . assuming that this result is valid for the entire volume , we conclude that the volume is predominantly filled with sheets and clusters .",
    "while the matter is mainly contained in sheets and filaments , the filaments do not occupy a very large fraction of the volume .",
    "this leads to a picture where the filaments have relatively higher matter densities as compared to clusters . to test this",
    "we separately consider the centers with @xmath0 values @xmath14 and @xmath5 , and for each value we determine the fraction of centers as a function of the density environment .",
    "the density was calculated on a @xmath63 grid after smoothing with a gaussian filter of width @xmath64 .",
    "we find ( figure [ fig : hist2 ] ) that in comparison to the centers with @xmath9 and @xmath6 , the centers with @xmath55 are more abundant in under - dense regions in preference to the over - dense regions .",
    "this is consistent with the picture where filaments and sheets located along the cosmic web contain the bulk of the matter and also most of the high density regions , whereas the centers with @xmath65 are predominantly located in under - dense regions away from the cosmic web , namely the voids .",
    "the results presented above are specific to the length - scale range @xmath66 .",
    "it is quite possible that the relative abundance of clusters , sheets and filaments would be quite different if the same analysis were carried out over a considerably different range of length - scales , say for example @xmath67 .",
    "here we have repeated the entire analysis using a smaller range of length - scales @xmath68 for which the results are also shown in figure [ fig : hist1 ] .",
    "we find that the results are qualitatively similar to those obtained using @xmath66 , indicating that our conclusions regarding the relative abundance of clusters , sheets and filaments are quite robust and are not very sensitive to small changes in the range over which @xmath0 is determined .",
    "this also indicates that the @xmath0 values determined using length - scales @xmath69 are not severely biased by the presence of other structural elements with @xmath70 of the one on which the center is located .",
    "in conclusion we note that the local dimension provides a robust method to quantify the shapes and probe the distribution of the different , interconnected structural elements that make up the cosmic web .",
    "we plan to apply this to the sdss and other galaxy surveys in future .",
