    "this paper represents the continuation of another paper @xcite - in the following referred as part i - in which a general method to analyze small - world models has been presented . here",
    "( part ii ) we apply it to some cases of interest which can be fully faced analytically .",
    "even if the exactness of this method is limited to the paramagnetic regions , it gives the exact critical behavior and the exact critical surfaces , and provide a clear and immediate ( also in terms of calculation ) insight of the physics . as stressed in part i , the underlying structure of the non random part of the model , _",
    "i.e. _ , the set of spins staying in a given lattice @xmath0 of dimension @xmath1 and interacting through a fixed coupling @xmath2 , is exactly taken into account .",
    "when @xmath3 , the small - world effect gives rise to the known fact that a second order phase transition takes place , independently of the dimension @xmath1 and of the added random connectivity @xmath4 .",
    "however , when @xmath5 , a completely different scenario emerges and - besides a second - order spin glass transition - for a sufficiently large @xmath4 , multiple first and second - order ferromagnetic phase transitions may take place . here",
    "we will emphasize above all this aspect which , to the best of our knowledge , until now was observed only in @xcite and in the context of small - world neural networks in @xcite , and in our opinion represents a new paradigm in view of interesting applications in real small - world networks .",
    "the main advantage of our method lies in its great simplicity .",
    "in fact , what is required to apply it , is to solve not the small - world model ( a random model ) defined over @xmath0 , but a corresponding non random model still defined over @xmath0 and immersed in an external magnetic field .",
    "this implies that we are able to solve analytically small - world models whose underlying lattice @xmath0 has dimension 0 , 1 or infinite , as for an ensemble of non interacting units , the one dimensional chain , and the spherical model , respectively .",
    "in fact , in all these cases the non random model can be exactly solved even when immersed in an external magnetic field .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in secs .",
    "ii and iii we recall the definition of the small - world models and the method , which mainly consists in finding the solution of the self - consistent equation ( [ theoa ] ) minimizing the effective free energy ( [ theoll ] ) . in sec .",
    "iv we analyze two simple cases in which @xmath0 has dimension @xmath6 : an ensemble of non interacting units . the small world - model defined on it",
    "gives rise in particular to the well known viana - bray model ( sometime called random bethe lattice model ) . in sec .",
    "v we consider the case in which @xmath0 is the one dimensional chain .",
    "vi is devoted to the spherical model - an infinite - dimensional model - defined for arbitrary @xmath1 @xcite . finally , in sec .",
    "vii some conclusions are drawn .",
    "we consider random ising models constructed by super - imposing random graphs with finite average connectivity onto some given lattice @xmath0 whose set of bonds @xmath7 and dimension will be indicated by @xmath8 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "given an ising model - shortly _ the unperturbed model _ - of @xmath9 spins coupled over @xmath0 through a coupling @xmath2 and with hamiltonian @xmath10 and given an ensemble @xmath11 of unconstrained random graphs @xmath12 , @xmath13 , whose bonds are determined by the adjacency matrix elements @xmath14 , we define the corresponding small - world model - shortly _ the random model _ - as described by the following hamiltonian @xmath15 the free energy @xmath16 and the averages @xmath17 being defined in the usual ( quenched ) way as @xmath18 and @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the partition function of the quenched system    @xmath21    @xmath22 the boltzmann - average of the quenched system ( note that @xmath22 depends on the given realization of the @xmath23 s and of @xmath12 : @xmath24 ; for shortness we will often omit to write these dependencies )    @xmath25    and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are two product measures given in terms of two normalized measures @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively : @xmath30 @xmath31 the variables @xmath32 specify whether a `` long - range '' bond between the sites @xmath33 and @xmath34 is present ( @xmath35 ) or absent ( @xmath36 ) , whereas the @xmath37 s are the random variables of the given bond @xmath7 . for the @xmath38 s , we shall consider the following distribution @xmath39 where @xmath40 .",
    "this choice leads in the thermodynamic limit @xmath41 to a number of long range connections per site distributed according to a poisson law with mean connectivity @xmath4 .",
    "when we will need to be specific , for the @xmath37 s we will assume either the distribution @xmath42 or @xmath43 to consider ferromagnetism or glassy phases , respectively .",
    "( [ dpsg ] ) @xmath44 $ ] .",
    "depending on the temperature t , and on the parameters of the probability distributions , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , the random model may stably stay either in the paramagnetic ( p ) , in the ferromagnetic ( f ) , or in the spin glass ( sg ) phase . in our approach for the f and sg phases",
    "there are two natural order parameters that will be indicated by @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "similarly , for any correlation function , quadratic or not , there are two natural quantities indicated by @xmath49 and @xmath50 , and that in turn will be calculated in terms of @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "to avoid confusion , it should be kept in mind that in our approach , for any observable @xmath51 there are - in principle - always two solutions that we label as f and sg , but , for any temperature , only one of the two solutions is stable and useful in the thermodynamic limit .    in the following , we will use the label @xmath52 to specify that we are referring to the unperturbed model with hamiltonian ( [ h0 ] ) .",
    "let @xmath53 be the stable magnetization of the unperturbed model with coupling @xmath2 and in the presence of a uniform external field @xmath54 at inverse temperature @xmath55 .",

    "iiid of part i. we recall however that , at least for lattices @xmath0 having only loops of even length , the stable p region is always that corresponding to a p - f phase diagram , so that in the p region the correlation functions must be calculated only through eqs .",

    "( [ theog ] ) ensures the unicity of the solution .",
    "we end this section by stressing that this method is exact in all the p region and provides the exact critical surface , behavior and percolation threshold , and that , in the absence of frustration , the order parameters @xmath56 become exact also in the limit @xmath88 , in the case of second - order phase transitions , and in the limit @xmath89 ( see sec .",
    "iiic of part i ) .",
    "note also that the order parameters @xmath56 , and then the correlation functions , are by construction always exact in the zero temperature limit .",

    "( [ vbf]-[vbi ] ) were derived by mapping the viana - bray model and , similarly , the sherrington - kirkpatrick model to the non random fully connected ising model . in this sense",
    "it should be also clear that , at least for @xmath103 and zero external field , in the thermodynamic limit , the connected correlation functions ( of order @xmath73 greater than 1 ) in the sherrington - kirkpatrick and in the viana - bray model are exactly zero .",
    "in fact , in the thermodynamic limit , the non random fully connected model can be exactly reduced to a model of non interacting spins immersed in an effective medium so that among any two spins there is no correlation .",
    "such a result is due to the fact that , in these models , all the @xmath9 spins interact through the same coupling @xmath104 , no matter how far apart they are , and the net effect of this is that in the thermodynamic limit the system becomes equivalent to a collection of @xmath9 non interacting spins seeing only an effective external field ( the medium ) like in eq .",

    "our major interest in this simpler gas of dimer small - world model is related to the fact that , in spite of its simplicity and @xmath1=0 dimensionality - since the second derivative of @xmath95 may be positive when @xmath2 is negative - according to the general result of sec .",

    "it will be however rather evident how much the two methods differ in terms of simplicity and intuitive meaning .",

    "the simplicity of the method allows us to find very easily ( just a few line equations ) the critical surfaces and the order parameters . in our method",
    "the former are exact whereas the latter provide an approximation to the exact order parameters which , in the absence of frustration , become exact in the limit @xmath160 , when the transition is of second order , and in the limit @xmath89 . in particular , we have studied in detail the small - world defined over the one dimensional chain with positive and negative short - range couplings , showing explicitly how , in the second case , multicritical points with first- and second - order phase transition arise .",

    "this latter result - besides to be consistent with what we have found in the @xmath6-dimensional discrete models - is easily and physically explained by the method .",
    "in fact , it consists on mapping the small - world model ( a random model ) to a corresponding non random model ( no long - range bonds ) but immersed in an effective uniform external field which is active as soon as the added random connectivity @xmath4 is not zero ( see eqs .",
