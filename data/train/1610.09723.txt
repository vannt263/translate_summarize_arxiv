    "ion beams have many application in research and industry . being able to increase the delivered intensity to the application and reducing size and cost are important aspect of developing new accelerators and enabling new application for particle accelerators .    among the most ambitious applications for high - intensity beams",
    "are driving fusion reactions for the purpose of electricity generation .",
    "there are roughly two approaches to the challenge of fusion energy production : magnetic confinement ( mfe ) and inertial confinement ( ife ) . in both approaches ,",
    "high - intensity ion beams have been proposed as methods to heat the fusion fuel .    in magnetic confinement , typified by tokamaks and other magnetic confinement schemes , a plasma of , for example , deuterium and tritium is heated to a temperature of several where the fusion cross - sections are high enough for the generation of energy from the reaction products exceeds the energy required to sustain the plasma .",
    "the plasma and fusion reactions are sustained for a long time ( minutes to hours ) .",
    "various methods are being developed to heat the plasma , including the deposition of energy in the plasma from high current deuteron beams .",
    "for iter , two deuterium beam systems are being constructed with ion kinetic energy of .",
    "each beamline occupies a volume exceeding @xmath0{m^3}$]@xcite .",
    "the idea of using accelerators for inertial fusion came in the 1970 s shortly after rapid progress in laser technology and the recognition that lasers might drive inertial fusion targets@xcite . in laser and ion beam driven targets ,",
    "the fuel is a spherical shell a few millimeters in diameter .",
    "ion beam energy of the order of have to be delivered in @xmath1{s}$ ] to achieve ignition , and simulations indicate that  100@xmath2 more energy may be created from the fusion reactions@xcite .",
    "in contrast to the magnetic fusion approach , the process here is pulsed , with a repetition rate of several hertz .",
    "the ion beam requirements are constrained by the target design , where for heavy ions ( a>100 ) a kinetic energy of several and kiloamperes of current are required . for lighter ions and for a given total beam energy ,",
    "the current must be increased .",
    "there has been interest in magneto - inertial fusion ( mif ) , where aspects of magnetic and inertial fusion approaches are merged .",
    "the initially low density plasma is confined by a magnetic field .",
    "the plasma and embedded magnetic field are compressed by , e.g. , a metal liner , directed plasma or beams , with a confinement time longer than characteristic of ife , and shorter than mfe .    for the ife and mif fusion energy applications ,",
    "the final current density must be @xmath3 and the total energy per pulse needs to be @xmath4{mj}$ ] .",
    "the accelerators generating the fusion driver beams are usually the most costly aspects of the fusion energy power plant system .",
    "most ion accelerators have average acceleration gradients of over their length . comprising focusing magnets and acceleration cells ( rf or induction accelerators )",
    ", they have transverse dimensions approximately , not including power supplies , vacuum pumps and other ancillary equipment . for non - fusion applications ,",
    "the beam requirements tend to be less demanding but state of the art accelerator architecture in these applications have the same footprint and cost .",
    "this work is motivated by advances in microelectromechanical systems ( mems ) techniques , in particular the potential for low - cost fabrication combined with excellent dimensional tolerances . in order to generate high power beams",
    ", we propose to accelerate many parallel beams in a common accelerator structure and vacuum system , closely nested toward a lower - cost and reliable accelerator architecture for the applications above .",
    "the idea of a scaled down accelerator was presented by maschke @xcite .",
    "he proposed a meqalac structure consisting of electrostatic quadrupoles and rf - acceleration .",
    "the current limit for an electrostatic quadrupole focusing lattice is given by    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the beam aperture , @xmath7 the maximum electric field , and @xmath8 the ion beam velocity@xcite . the electric field is bound by the breakdown field of the quadrupole structure .",
    "measured breakdown fields stay constant or increase when scaling down the gap distance @xcite .",
    "therefore the current density of an accelerator structure can be increased by scaling down the size of the structures and the total current can be increased by using multiple beamlets .",
    "although magnetic quadrupoles offer better focusing than electrostatic ones at higher beam velocities , they do not scale well to smaller sizes , i.e. the current density needed to create the magnetic field increases when scaling down the quadrupole size . in practice",
    "the smallest useful size for the quadrupole structures will be limited by alignment and fabrication errors of the structure .",
    "mems technology pushes the boundaries of these fabrication errors into the micrometer range and therefore allows drastic improvements in transportable currents .",
    "in fact , the theoretical current density transport limits achievable with an aperture of the order of @xmath9{\\mu m}$ ] a unit cell size of @xmath10{\\mu m}$ ] and an applied field of @xmath11{v}{m}$ ] ( taken as 50% of the breakdown limit from fig .  4 in [ sl02 ] ) will be @xmath12{a}{cm^2}$ ] for xe ions and @xmath13{a}{cm^2}$ ] for h ions , both at .",
    "normal ion sources produce of the order of @xmath14{ma}{cm^2}$ ] beam currents for xe , for hydrogen up to @xmath15{a}{cm^2}$ ] have been achieved@xcite",
    ". the ion source will therefore be the limiting factor in most applications and bunching , funneling or other methods of increasing the current density might be utilized to overcome this limitation .",
    "the proposed accelerator structure consists of two main components : rf - units and esq doublets .",
    "the rf - units will provide the acceleration for the ion beam and the esqs will allow effective beam transport along the accelerator structure .",
    "each rf - wafer unit consists of two vacuum gaps between ring electrodes that are used for acceleration and a field - free drift region of a specific length that allows the rf - field to adjust its phase , so that the ions entering the second gap will also see an accelerating field . for each rf - unit",
    "the ions enter and leave the unit at ground potential .",
    "all rf - wafers share the same design making batch fabrication possible : each beamlet corresponds to a through hole aperture in the wafer that has a ring electrode at its entrance and exit on the surface of the wafer . in silicon",
    "this would be a deposited metal ring and in our circuit board design the on board copper is utilized for this purpose . to create an rf - unit ,",
    "four wafers are stacked together .",
    "both sides of the outer wafers are grounded and all four sides of the inner wafers are connected to the rf - source ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : rf - concept ] ) .",
    "we use gaps as acceleration gaps .",
    "the drift distance is calculated depending on the expected ion energy , ion mass , and rf - frequency .",
    "precision washers are used between the wafers to define the gap distances .    to focus the beam we rely on esqs .",
    "each consists of two pairs of electrodes which are biased positive and negative respectively . to implement esq components , we form four electrodes around each beam aperture and run electrical connections to the front and back of each wafers for the positive and negative voltages ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : esq - concept ] ) .",
    "the esq structure is therefore completely contained in a single wafer .",
    "a single esq wafer focuses the beam in one direction and defocuses the beam in the other .",
    "we therefore use two esq wafers to form a focusing doublet to provide an overall focusing effect on the beam .",
    "for initial prototyping we utilize pc board ( fr-4 ) to fabricate the rf and esq wafers .    using laser micromachining ,",
    "top and bottom metal layers are patterned and holes are drilled through the board .",
    "alignment between top and bottom is achieved by using an integrated vision system and pre - fabricated alignment fiducials .",
    "furthermore , by using the integrated camera of the tool , top and bottom layers can be registered for alignment .",
    "steps of the process to fabricate rf wafers are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : rf - fab ] . in this process , we start with fr-4 based board that has copper on both sides as seen in the cross section .",
    "the circular holes are created using a laser tool .",
    "then laser cutting is used to define top and bottom metal routing . a top and bottom view of the fabricated rf wafer is shown in fig .  [ fig : rf - fab ] .",
    "the main steps of the process to fabricate esq wafers are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : esq - fab ] . in this process",
    ", the fr-4 based board also has copper on both sides .",
    "the holes are then created using the laser tool . as the holes in the pcbs are created using a scanned laser beam rather than a milling tool ,",
    "arbitrary hole shapes can easily be realized . after defining of holes ,",
    "a copper layer is evaporated onto the board in a conformal evaporator with a rotating chuck system on both sides ( @xmath16{\\mu m}$ ] thick ) .",
    "furthermore , for better sidewall coverage , copper is also electroplated from both sides .",
    "then the laser is then used to remove the metal on certain parts of the sidewalls of the holes to isolate the electrode .",
    "finally , the laser is used again to define top and bottom metal routing .",
    "to test the major components of this technology , a compact test stand has been set up .",
    "a filament driven , multi - cusp ion source@xcite is used to generate a plasma .",
    "the source operates using argon or helium at a pressure in the plasma chamber of around ( granville - phillips convectron atm 385003 ) that is connected directly to the source body . to create the plasma we rely on continuous gas flow .",
    "the filament is then operated at several amperes and a arc pulse is applied for a certain time ( normally @xmath17{\\mu s}$ ] ) to ignite the plasma .",
    "ions are extracted during the arc pulse by floating the source body to a high voltage ( ) and using a three electrode extraction system ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : setup ] ) .",
    "the plasma facing electrode is not electrically connected to a fixed voltage source and therefore floats to the plasma potential during operation .",
    "a voltage of has been measured during plasma operation .",
    "the second electrode is used to extract the ion beam and is biased at a negative voltage relative to the source body .",
    "a third electrode has been implemented that can be utilized to gate the extracted beam and short , uniform ion pulses of @xmath18{\\mu s}$ ] bunch length with no electron pre - pulse have been achieved . however , in the work reported here , we do not utilize the gating mechanism and the third electrode is biased slightly above the second grid , so that ions are extracted continuously during the arc - pulse .",
    "the ions then gain their remaining kinetic energy when they are accelerated from the source potential to a grounded exit aperture .",
    "to demonstrate multiple parallel beamlets , we use a multi - aperture extraction system . in this first prototype a @xmath19 array of beam extraction apertures is implemented for each electrode , where each extraction aperture has a diameter and the electrodes are positioned with an inter - hole distance of .",
    "array of beamlets .",
    "a faraday - cup is used to measure the beam current .",
    "alternatively a scintillator and a ccd camera can be used to image the beam . ]    after the ions leave the beam extraction section we utilize the beam to test our accelerator components . for the rf - tests , the test structure consisted of two rf - units .",
    "the drift gap length is adjusted to match a argon ion beam , a driving rf - frequency of and an acceleration voltage of .",
    "since the acceleration gaps are a serious of _ pull _ and _ push _ stages , the applied rf - voltage needs to change phase by .",
    "the drift gap between the center points of the gaps is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the relative ion velocity @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the rf wavelength .",
    "we summarize the implemented distances in our two rf - unit ( four acceleration gaps ) setup in table  [ tab : drifts ] .",
    ".[tab : drifts]drift distances used between rf - wafers , designed for , rf signal and a ion beam .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     the rf high - voltage for our experiments is generated by amplifying the output of a signal generator ( agilent 33520a ) to an output power of max .",
    "( mini circuit zhl-2 - 8 ) where it can be used to directly drive the gate of an rf mosfet and excite the tuned resonant circuit at the same frequency resulting in another gain of  40 .",
    "the losses in the mosfet and the rf wafer capacitance ( @xmath24{pf}$ ] per gap ) are the dominant loads .",
    "the frequency used for the experiments presented here is . a peak amplitude on the printed circuit board of up to has been measured .",
    "in the absence of a pre - bunching ( or chopper ) section between the ion source will deliver a constant ion current ( compared to the rf - period ) , therefore some fraction of ions are expected to get accelerated and others decelerated .",
    "a retarding potential analyzer was used to measure the beam energy distribution .",
    "this has been implemented by adding a biased grid after the rf - units followed by a faraday cup to measure the beam current . by scanning the grid voltage ,",
    "the faraday - cup at the end of the beamline selectively detects the current of ions with a kinetic velocity that is higher than the applied voltage on the grid .",
    "the esq wafers are tested in a similar fashion . instead of the rf - units a single esq or a doublet wafer",
    "is mounted behind the ion source .",
    "we then use a scintillator ( rp 400 plastic scintillator ) and a fast image intensifying camera ( princeton instruments ) to look at the beam output .",
    "since a filament driven ion source is being used , light from the filament also reaches the scintillator , by looking at the scintillator at an angle , we avoid overlapping the light from the scintillator with light output from the ion beam hitting the scintillator . as both have roughly the same amplitude , this avoids the need for background subtraction .",
    "voltage scans on the esq electrodes then result in beam deflection that can be measured .",
    "to characterize the ion source , we scanned the extraction voltages of the ion source .",
    "the source was operated at using argon .",
    "the filament was on for to create a stable and high enough filament temperature .",
    "then the arc voltage was pulsed at for .",
    "the source was floated at and then extraction voltages on the second and third electrode was scanned . here , the third electrode was always held higher than the extraction electrode . fig .",
    "[ fig : source ] shows the resulting beam current measured in the source without any rf - unit or esq - units present .",
    "as you can see , the ion current increases according to the child - langmuir law of space - charge limited extraction at the beginning and then , depending on the plasma density , changes at one point into an emission limited regime . operating the source in the emission limited regime , will generate more noise from shot - to - shot , since the output level with depend on the current gas pressure , filament conditions , etc .",
    "therefore , an operating point at an extraction voltage of was chosen for an arc current of , which provided a very stable source performance .",
    "next a two stage rf - unit was tested .",
    "the beam energy profile was measured at three different conditions : 1 ) minimum rf - amplitude ( lowest setting on the rf - generator ) 2 ) rf - amplitude at amplitude and 3 ) rf - amplitude at amplitude .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rf - result ] together with simulated results ( solid lines ) .",
    "the simulation uses a very simply 1d - model to estimate the beam energy of several nanosecond long beam pulses and a perfect energy filter in front of the faraday - cup .",
    "the simulated results are based on the rf - frequency and amplitude , the ion energy and mass , as well acceleration gap positions and contains no free parameters .",
    "results from using several rf - gaps as well discussion of the simulation program will discussed in a future publication .        even for the case with almost no rf ,",
    "most of the feature in the signal still can be attributed to the few volts of remaining rf - amplitude .",
    "the remaining discrepancy is due to the energy spread that is intrinsic to the ion source .",
    "the measured beam energy can be estimated to be .",
    "for the cases where the rf was turned on , we measured a wider energy spread .",
    "as can be seen , some particles arrive at the correct time to achieve full acceleration in each gap , whereas other arrive at different phases of the rf and either get partial accelerated , do not feel any acceleration or get decelerated .",
    "the measured energy distribution fits very well with our simulated results from the 1d - model .",
    "as one can see , the maximum beam energy is roughly given by the starting beam energy and four times the maximum rf - amplitude .",
    "the fact that the measured energy is a bit lower can be attributed to the fact that the gap distances were designed for a slightly higher rf - amplitude .    for the esq tests ,",
    "we first utilized a single esq wafer and demonstrated the typical elliptical deformation of a round beam that is the result of focusing the beam in one direction and at the same time defocusing the beam in the other direction , see fig .",
    "[ fig : esq - result ] for results from applying different polarities to the esq electrodes .        combining two esqs into a doublet",
    "then allows the beam to be focused in both directions . to demonstrate this",
    ", we were able to choose the voltages on an esq doublet so that the initial round beam is again focused to a round beam after passing to energies esq ( not shown ) .",
    "in this paper we have shown that the basic components needed to implement a mems based meqalac work .",
    "this opens the path to compact , high current accelerator that can be used , for example , to drive fusion reactions with ion beams as well as for other applications .",
    "we envision this technology to be applicable for ions beam in the to several range , with average beam current densities up to @xmath25{ma}{cm^2}$ ] .",
    "the technology can also be used for lower energies , however below it will be more effective to use a single high voltage gap to directly accelerate the ions . above beam energy , the advantages of having cheap components and lower voltages will be more and more important . for this technology to be competitive",
    "we believe that an rf - amplitude of several kilovolts is needed per acceleration gap .",
    "this way , we will be able to achieve gradients of for the accelerator structure at frequencies in the range . to accomplish these high gradients we are currently investigating the use of on board resonators with a high q that already have been shown to produce the required voltages .",
    "first prototypes are currently being designed and we will test these devices in the coming month to be able to integrate most of the rf - stack onto the wafers . switching from pcboard to silicon will also provide a path for mass fabrication and better manufacturing precision .",
    "we have shown that a compact rf - cell without a resonant cavity can be used to accelerate an ion beam .",
    "for this proof of concept printed circuit board structures have been used , whereas for a final accelerator we envision the use of silicon wafers .",
    "this will allow smaller beamlets packed to a higher density on a wafer for increased effective beam - current densities .",
    "furthermore , focusing elements in the form of electrostatic quadrupoles will be added to the accelerator to allow for beam transport and refocusing of the beam along the beamline ."
