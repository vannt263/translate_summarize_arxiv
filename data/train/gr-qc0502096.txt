    "@xmath1    in the series of papers @xcite we analyzed the asymptotic directional properties of electromagnetic and gravitational fields in spacetimes with a nonvanishing cosmological constant @xmath2 .",
    "it had been known for a long time @xcite that  contrary to the asymptotically flat spacetimes  the dominant ( radiative ) component of the fields is not unique since it depends substantially on the direction along which a null geodesic approaches a given point at conformal infinity @xmath3 .",
    "we demonstrated that , somewhat surprisingly , such directional structure of radiation can be described in closed explicit form .",
    "it has a universal character that is essentially determined by the algebraic type of the field , i.e. , by the specific local degeneracy and orientation of the principal null directions .",
    "our results were summarized and thoroughly discussed in the recent topical review @xcite .",
    "they apply not only to electromagnetic or gravitational fields but to any field of spin @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , the expression representing the directional behavior of radiation can be written in a unified form which covers all three possibilities @xmath4 , @xmath5 or @xmath6 , corresponding to a spacelike , timelike or null character of  @xmath3 , respectively .",

    "the parameter @xmath42 is the pseudostereographic representation of @xmath44 : @xmath49    in fact , we can introduce both these parametrizations simultaneously , independently of the causal character of the infinity , just with respect to the reference tetrad  the angles @xmath38 using a projection onto the 3-space orthogonal to the time vector @xmath50 of the reference tetrad , and the parameters @xmath51 using a projection to the 2 + 1-space orthogonal to @xmath52 . in such a case",
    "they are related by expressions @xmath53    if the infinity has a timelike character , all future oriented null directions at one point at @xmath7 naturally split into two families of outgoing and ingoing directions .",
    "the directions of each of these families form a hemisphere which can be projected onto a unit circle parametrized by @xmath54 and @xmath46 , such that @xmath55 see also figure .",

    "the principal null directions ( pnds ) are special directions along which some of the field components vanish  see @xcite or section for a precise definition .",

    "distinct pnds are also called of the field .",
    "the classification according to the degeneracy of pnds for a gravitational field is the well - known petrov classification .",

    "the directional dependence of the magnitude of a gravitational type d field and of an algebraically general electromagnetic field are thus quite similar .",
    "this similarity is even closer if we recall that the square of the electromagnetic component @xmath83 is proportional to the magnitude of the poynting vector with respect to the interpretation tetrad , @xmath84 .",
    "indeed , we have @xmath85    as discussed in section , the form of the directional structure depends on the choice of the normalization factor @xmath86 .",
    "other choices can sometimes be more convenient , in particular if the factor @xmath86 vanishes which happens when one of the pnds points along the direction @xmath87 of the reference tetrad . for the type d fields there",
    "exists a more natural choice of normalization of the directional structure of radiation which is guaranteed to be non - degenerate . for these fields we can define a , namely , the only nonvanishing component with respect of the null tetrad associated with the pnds .    having two distinct algebraic directions @xmath88 and @xmath89 we can define ( and associated orthonormal tetrad @xmath90 ) by requiring that @xmath91 are _ proportional _ to the pnds and future oriented , and that the spatial vector @xmath92 is _ tangent _ to @xmath7 , @xmath93 for pnds which are not tangent to the conformal infinity the normalization of null vectors @xmath91 can be fixed by condition @xmath94 where @xmath95 parametrize orientations of the pnds with respect to @xmath7 .",
    "the special case of pnds tangent to @xmath7 will be discussed below .    using the definition of pnds ( see section )",
    "we find that the field components with respect to the algebraically special tetrad have very special form  only the component @xmath96 is nonvanishing ( @xmath97 for gravitational and @xmath98 for electromagnetic fields ) .",
    "this component is , in fact , independent of the choice of the spatial vectors @xmath99 , and thus it does not depend on the normal vector @xmath8 which we used in the definition  .",
    "it also does not depend on the normalization , provided that the normalization is satisfied .",
    "we will use the privileged component @xmath96 for the normalization of the directional structure of radiation .",
    "however , the algebraically special tetrad is _ not _ adjusted to the infinity ( cf .",
    "condition  ) since @xmath100 and @xmath101 are not in general colinear with @xmath8 and thus it can not be used as a reference tetrad .",
    "nevertheless , we can define privileged reference tetrad which is with the algebraically special tetrad , and which shares some of the symmetries of the geometric situation .",
    "we will always assume that the reference tetrad satisfies the normalization and adjustment conditions , , and we set @xmath102 .",
    "this is , however , still not sufficient to fix the reference tetrad completely .",

    "as mentioned above , the component @xmath211 is then vanishing:@xmath212    if both distinct pnds are not tangent to @xmath7 we may normalize them by and fix the reference tetrad by the condition @xmath213 , namely , @xmath214 together with the adjustment condition , see figure [ fig : ast - n ] . in terms of the reference tetrad the pnds @xmath100 and @xmath101 are given by @xmath215 and their complex parameters are @xmath216 the relation between the algebraically special and reference tetrads is thus the same as in section [ ssc : timelike4 ] . using , @xmath210 , and relation we find that the radiative component has no directional structure : @xmath217 in particular , for gravitational and electromagnetic field we obtain @xmath218",
    "we have analyzed the asymptotic directional structure of fields that are characterized by the existence of two distinct but equivalent algebraicaly special null directions .",
    "this involves a generic electromagnetic field ( @xmath58 ) , the petrov type  d gravitational fields ( @xmath57 ) having double degenerate principal null directions , and other possible fields of an integer spin @xmath0 which admit a pair of @xmath0-degenerate pnds .    the structure of such fields near the conformal infinity depends on the specific orientation of these algebraically special directions with respect to @xmath3 , and on the causal character of @xmath3 .",
    "in case of a spacelike conformal infinity ( @xmath143 ) there is essentially only one possibility which is described in section  [ ssc : spacelike ] , whereas for a timelike conformal infinity ( @xmath219 ) four different situations may occur that have to be discussed separately , see sections  [ ssc : timelike1]  [ ssc : timelike4 ] . for the conformal infinity having a null character ( @xmath220 )",
    "the asymptotic directional structure disappears : when one of the ( degenerate ) pnds is tangent to  @xmath3 the radiative component vanishes , otherwise the radiation is present and it is independent of the direction along which the infinity is approached , cf . section  [ ssc : null ] .    in all such cases",
    "we have introduced the privileged reference tetrad which is naturally adapted to the algebraically special directions and to @xmath3 .",

    "these results generalize our previous study of the asymptotic directional structure of gravitational and electromagnetic radiation in the c - metric spacetimes @xcite to other fields which are of type d. on the other hand , the expressions presented here are more detailed and more explicit than those given in the review article @xcite .",
    "it would now be an interesting task to apply them on particular exact model spacetimes of type d. this may provide a deeper insight into the geometric relation between the structure of the sources and the properties of radiation generated by them , as observed at spacelike or timelike conformal infinities .",
