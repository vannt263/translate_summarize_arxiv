    "the positive value of @xmath29 implies that during this span @xmath30 ( proportional to the braking torque ) was decreasing steadily , by a total of 9% during the year .",
    "one unusual aspect of radio emission from  is the fluctuation on @xmath31 daily timescales of its period - averaged flux density , largely intrinsic to the pulsar ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these variations result from a combination of different pulse profile components becoming active ( i.e. , because of radically changing profiles ) and varying intensity from particular components . superimposed on this apparently chaotic variation , the average flux density of the pulsar decreased by over an order of magnitude in the 10 months following its pulsed radio discovery , as seen in figure  [ fig : fdotflux]b ( these pre-2007 data were originally presented in @xcite but have been reanalyzed here in order to present a consistent flux density record ) .",
    "most period - averaged flux densities presented in this paper ( including all in figure  [ fig : fdotflux]b ) were obtained by measuring for each daily observation the area under the pulse profile , scaled to its off - pulse rms , and converting to a jansky scale using the observing parameters and telescope system noise ( cf .",
    "the sefd@xmath13 values in table  [ tab : sens ] ; see section 7.3.2 of @xcite for more details on this method ) .",
    "we estimate that the absolute 1.4ghz flux density scale is accurate to within 10% .",
    "the greatest source of uncertainty arises from the impact of radio frequency interference ( rfi ) and system noise fluctuations on this long period and , from 2007 , faint pulsar .",
    "each pulse profile was carefully excised of rfi in both the frequency and time domains . nevertheless , for approximately one - third of all the post-2006 nrt observations , the rfi was so bad or the flux density was so low ( approaching the @xmath32mjy detection threshold ) , that we did not extract a flux density measurement at all . in some of the remaining instances , as much as half of the data had to be discarded in order to obtain an integrated profile clean enough to measure flux density .",
    "mindful of these caveats ( most often some residual rfi is bound to remain , and individual measurements could be greatly affected ) , we estimate that the nrt flux density measurements in figure  [ fig : fdotflux]b have a typical relative fractional uncertainty of @xmath33% , with a minimum of 0.1mjy .",
    "two things immediately stand out from figure  [ fig : fdotflux]b : daily flux density variations continued through the end of our data set , by factors of a few ; and the average 1.4ghz flux density stabilized early in 2007 , at a level of @xmath34mjy for all post-2006 nrt detections presented here . also , the panels of figure  [ fig : fdotflux ] are curiously something of a mirror image to each other .",

    "the last detection at the nrt was on october 29 , on november 2 at the gbt ( figure  [ fig : lastgbt ] ) , and at parkes on the following day .",
    "the next attempt to detect it was on november 10 .",
    "we attempted to detect the pulsar at parkes on 20 occasions through 2016 january , largely at 1.4ghz , each time for 0.51hr . at the nrt we did 10 more observations through 2009 june . at the gbt we made a total of 17 attempts at 2ghz , each @xmath36hr , through 2012 august .",
    "the pulsar was not detected in any of these 47 observations spanning 7 years since 2008 november ( figure  [ fig : nd ] ) .",
    "we emphasize that  did not gradually fade into undetectability . a few weeks before the last detection , we recorded beautiful profiles ( e.g. , figures  [ fig : pol]d , [ fig : profs]c and [ fig : profs]d ) ; the signal strength and pulse profiles were fluctuating at least as much as they had for the previous @xmath37 days .",
    "and then the radio pulses were gone .    for an assumed pulse duty cycle of 6% ( comparable to the component widths often observed for this pulsar ) and the parameters used in our monitoring observations ( table  [ tab : sens ] ) ,",
    "the upper limit on the flux density of  since late 2008 is approximately 0.1mjy at 1.4ghz based on the nrt observations , slightly lower than that for the parkes observations , and approximately 0.03mjy at 2ghz based on the gbt observations ( figure  [ fig : nd ] ) .",
    "these limits are nearly an order of magnitude below the _ average _ flux densities during the 1.8 years of radio emission post-2006 , although not much below the faintest established detections ( see figures  [ fig : lastgbt ] and [ fig : alpha ] ) . the great profile variability , long period , and rfi , make more detailed estimates unreliable . in any case , since the last detection in late 2008 , in none of 47 observations spanning 7 years was the pulsar as detectable as in the poorest of more than 200 detections made over a period of 2 years before 2008 november .     flux density measurements for  at 1.4ghz and 2ghz in 20072008 .",

    "recurring profile features are labelled p1p5 ( as in figure  [ fig : profs ] ) . ]",
    "the available evidence suggests that during the faint epoch that lasted for 2 years preceding its radio disappearance in late 2008 ,  had a steep radio spectrum , contrasting to its earlier generally flat spectrum .    in figure",
    "[ fig : alpha ] we present all our post-2006 flux density measurements at 1.4ghz and 2ghz .",
    "the 1.4ghz nrt values are reproduced from figure  [ fig : fdotflux]b .",
    "these are fundamentally consistent with parkes measurements at the same frequency from six full - stokes observations using pulsar digital filterbanks ( dfbs ) , analyzed with psrchive @xcite , and 12 analog filterbank ( afb ) observations .",
    "the 2ghz flux density values presented here were obtained from a subset of the gbt data used to derive toas ( section  [ sec : timing ] ) , using the method outlined in section  [ sec : flux ] for nrt and parkes afb observations .",
    "we determined the system noise ( table  [ tab : sens ] ) from a full - stokes 2ghz observation in the direction of , flux - calibrated with psrchive .",
    "even after careful rfi excision , we selected for reliable flux density measurements only 40% of all observations from which we extracted a toa .",
    "we estimate relative fractional uncertainties of @xmath33% on average .    the 2ghz measurements in figure  [ fig : alpha ] range over 0.10.5mjy , with an average and standard deviation of @xmath39mjy .",
    "this is to be compared to @xmath40mjy for the 1.4ghz measurements in the figure ( section  [ sec : flux ] ) , spanning much the same time interval . at face value",
    "this would seem to suggest a spectral index of @xmath41 ( where @xmath42 ) . given the inherent difficulties in extracting such a measurement for this variable pulsar from non - simultaneous multi - frequency observations susceptible to rfi despite our best efforts , we do not claim a reliable numerical value for @xmath43 . but figure  [ fig : alpha ] strongly suggests that  indeed became a steep - spectrum object during its final `` weak '' state prior to disappearance as a radio source , in that respect more akin to an ordinary pulsar than earlier in its `` high '' state , when the torque was also varying rapidly ( figure  [ fig : fdotflux ] ) .",
    "all of our previously published  polarimetric data are from before 2006 december @xcite .",
    "the data published by @xcite end even earlier , but include single - pulse polarimetry . here",
    "we present some polarimetric observations done in 2007 and 2008 with parkes at 1.4ghz and 3ghz , using respectively the center beam of the multibeam receiver and the 10 cm band of the 1050 cm receiver .",
    "the data were collected using dfbs , and analyzed with psrchive , as in @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : pol]a is a reprocessed version of a 2006 observation presented in @xcite , differing mainly in the flux density scale and amount of data excised due to rfi .",
    "the recalculated rotation measure is @xmath44radm@xmath26 , entirely consistent with the value in @xcite , and the rms calculated for the latter observations are consistent with this value within their larger uncertainties .",
    "the 3ghz full - stokes profile ( figure  [ fig : pol]c ) looks similar to its counterpart from 1.5 years before ( figure  1c of * ? ? ?",
    "at 1.4ghz , the two 2007/2008 profiles ( figure  [ fig : pol]b and [ fig : pol]d ) show very similar position angles of linear polarization ( pa ) , and differ mainly in the relative amplitudes of three total - intensity profile components ( labelled p2 , p3 , and p4/5 ) .",
    "both profiles are close to 100% linearly polarized .",
    "comparison between the 2006 profile ( figure  [ fig : pol]a ) and the 2007/2008 1.4ghz profiles shows that the pa sweep and its absolute values are similar for the `` main pulse '' regions ( components p3p5 ) .",
    "however , the 2007/2008 profiles show component p2 not present in the 2006 profile  whose p1 component in turn is not seen later on .",
    "profile components p1p5 altogether span 40% of pulse phase , and if they all display stable pas between 2006 and 2007/2008 , then in principle this allows for a more conclusive investigation of geometry than previously possible ( see section  [ sec : rvm ] ) .       a selection of  radio pulse profiles .",
    "prominent features in the profile that reoccur are labelled p1p5 ( as in figure  [ fig : pol ] ) .",
    "we define the `` main pulse '' ( mp ) region as being composed of up to features p3p5 .",
    "profiles are aligned by eye , and the absolute phase here is arbitrary . ]    the total - intensity pulse profiles of  were always extremely variable , both in phase of active emitting regions and in the daily appearance of each pulse profile component .",
    "the description that follows is based on a review of hundreds of daily profiles that we obtained during 20062008 at the gbt , parkes , and nanay .",
    "there was never any stable pulse profile , but we detected emission from some pulse longitudes more often than from others , with some discernible patterns over time , and radio pulsations were never detected from many longitudes . in that sense",
    ", there was some long - lasting stability to the radio - emitting region .    referring to figure  [ fig : profs]a",
    ", emission was always detected from the main pulse region ( mp , in turn made up of at least three discernible sub - structures , labelled p3p5 , not all necessarily emitting at once ) .",
    "emission from component p1 ( see also figure  [ fig : pol]a ) was detected only during 2006 , and it was the most variable , sometimes being much brighter than the mp components .",
    "on the other hand , p2 was active sometimes in 2006 and 2007 ( figure  [ fig : pol]b ) , but became more common in 2008 ( figures  [ fig : pol]d and [ fig : profs]c  d ) . in 2007 the observed profile often consisted of emission from the mp region alone ( figure  [ fig : profs]b ) . in only one ( 2006 )",
    "observation out of hundreds did we detect emission from all these regions at once ( figure  [ fig : profs]a ) .",
    "the relative amplitudes of the different components varied widely , exemplified in figure  [ fig : profs]d by p4 , usually not preeminent but on this day the brightest of any .",
    "the very `` spiky '' nature of the individual sub - pulses that built up the broader integrated profile components ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) continued to the very end ( figure  [ fig : lastgbt ] ) .",
    "our sense is that in 20072008 the profiles were less variable than in 2006 , but this impression may be biased by two factors : the pulsar was much brighter in 2006 , which allowed the detection of very faint rarely observed components ( see figure  2 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; and the total integration ( both in number and in average duration of observations ) was larger in 2006 compared to later . in any case",
    "it is clear that during the period when the torque had stabilized by comparison to earlier huge variations , and when the period - averaged flux density had also stabilized in an average sense at a low level ( figure  [ fig : fdotflux ] ) , the pulse profiles of  were still varying at unprecedented levels compared to normal pulsars , and continued to do so until radio pulsations disappeared .",
    "in order to search for clues to the disappearance of radio pulsations from , we reviewed all its archival  and  data collected from 20032014 .",
    "timing results from 2009 november onward are newly published here .",
    "detailed spectroscopic and flux analysis are presented in @xcite , with a summary of the fluxes given in section  [ sec : xrayflux ] . in summary , we find that the x - ray fluxes stepped down to a minimum value around the time that the radio pulsations shut off , and this is the only recognizable event in x - rays that is plausibly contemporaneous with the disappearance in radio .",

    "observations used the pn ccd in full - frame or large - window mode , with 74ms or 44ms resolution and , in most cases , the mos ccds in small - window mode with 0.3s resolution .",
    "we corrected the processed archival  photons for leap seconds and time jumps when needed , and applied the barycentric correction at the vlbi measured position .",
    "we then computed frequencies and @xmath46 errors using the @xmath47 test on photons in the 0.34kev band .",
    "the two short  hrc observations that were obtained for the purpose of source location have relatively uncertain frequencies , and were not used in the subsequent analysis .",
    "the frequency measurements are shown in figure  [ fig : xray]a .",
    "these were used to track the time - varying frequency derivative from 20032009 by computing the difference in frequency between adjacent  observations , usually 6 months apart . where these @xmath0 measurements overlap with the more precise record obtained from radio observations during 20062008 ( figure  [ fig : fdotflux]a ) , they agree .",
    "figure  [ fig : xray]b illustrates that @xmath0 varied by a factor of @xmath48 . in the months immediately following the outburst , which was first detected in 2003 january , monitoring by _ rxte _ showed noisy spin - down with an even higher mean frequency derivative of @xmath49hzs@xmath9 @xcite , which is @xmath50 times the minimum value of @xmath51hzs@xmath9 measured by  in 20072008 ( figure  [ fig : xray]b ) .    starting in 2009 september , more frequent observations allowed a phase - connected solution to be established up through 2012 may",
    "this process was facilitated by the relatively stable spin - down with small rate at later times .",
    "beginning with the two observations on 2009 september 5 and 7 , we folded the photons jointly using the @xmath47 test , and used the resulting frequency to fold the next observation , verifying that the predicted phase agrees with the observed one to @xmath52 cycles .",

    "this could have arisen from their underestimation of uncertainties in frequency measurements . in any case",
    ", our phase - coherent ephemeris spanning this time shows no such event .",
    "@xcite also propose that there is a single phase - connected timing solution spanning all of 20072014 .",
    "this is clearly invalid , because their listed uncertainties on the polynomial coefficients ( @xmath17 , @xmath0 , @xmath18 ) are two orders of magnitude larger than what would be needed to describe a unique cycle count .",
    "also , the parameters of our actual phase - coherent timing segments in radio ( table  [ tab : parms ] ) and x - ray ( table  [ tab : xraytime ] ) disagree with theirs . in particular , their fitted @xmath61hzs@xmath9 is about half of the true value .    after 2012",
    "may we were unable to maintain phase connection .",
    "the prior coherent timing solution fails to predict the phase of the 2012 september observation by @xmath62 cycles .",
    "possibly an anti - glitch @xcite and/or change in torque occurred between 2012 may and september .",
    "but we can not tell for sure what happened because the change in frequency differs from the extrapolation by only @xmath63 .",
    "we can only estimate the frequency derivative from 2012 september to 2014 september with an incoherent fit to the frequencies , which is highly uncertain .",
    "all we can say is that the long - term frequency derivative did not clearly change in 2012 ( see figure  [ fig : xray]b ) .    from 2009 september to 2012 may , @xmath0 changed by at most 4% , as measured by the frequency second derivative ( which is a factor of 6 smaller than that measured over the year following 2007 september ; table  [ tab : parms ] ) .",
    "such behavior is common in axps and soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) , which often show extended periods of smooth spin - down at small @xmath64 as well as noisier epochs with larger @xmath64 @xcite . at one time , it was proposed that the combined action of free and radiative precession could explain `` bumpy '' spin - down of axps @xcite , which predicted that @xmath0 would oscillate with a period of several years .",
    "however , as observations of dramatic changes in @xmath0 from magnetars have accumulated over the years , none are apparently dominated by such periodic variations ( see references above ) .",
    "there is at best some evidence possibly indicating quasi - periodic @xmath0 behavior in one magnetar @xcite .",
    "the timing behavior of  shown in figure  [ fig : xray ] seems typical when compared with other magnetars that have been monitored for longer times with no cyclic pattern evident in their spin - down .",
    "figure  [ fig : xraypulse ] shows three sample energy - dependent x - ray pulse profiles from , during ( 2007 ) and after ( 2009 , 2011 ) the epoch of pulsed radio detection .",
    "they share the same characteristics as earlier observations , in particular those from 2005 and 2006 as shown in @xcite .",
    "the pulse peaks are in phase as a function of energy , while the pulsed fraction increases sharply with energy .",
    "this is understood in a model in which a small hot spot is surrounded by a cooler , larger annulus that covers most of the neutron star . in summary , there is no obvious change in x - ray timing or pulse shapes corresponding to the shut - down of radio emission in late 2008 .",
    "figure  [ fig : xray]c summarizes the results from blackbody spectral modelling that is described in more detail in @xcite .",
    "the spectrum is fitted with either two or three blackbodies , where the coolest one is restricted to having a constant temperature and area representing the full surface of the neutron star ( dashed line in figure  [ fig : xray]c ) .",
    "the triangles represent the fluxes from one or two blackbodies ( hot and warm ) of much smaller area that account for the decaying outburst flux .",
    "the squares are the total flux at each epoch .",
    "it is evident that the fluxes have been steady since after 2009 , just after a slight decrease of @xmath3 in the hot / warm component between 2008 march and 2009 march .",
    "this small step - down in flux , corresponding to @xmath65 erg  s@xmath9 in bolometric luminosity , is the only event in x - rays that we have been able to find that is approximately coincident with the turn - off of radio pulsations in late 2008 .",
    "five of the x - ray observations listed in table  [ tab : xraylog ] were made during the period in which  was an active radio source ( see also figure  [ fig : xray ] ) .",
    "for these observations , we can therefore compare the emission phases of the x - ray and radio profiles .",
    "for each of these observations ( two made with and three with ) , we used tempo to fit for an offset between the x - ray toa and a small number of surrounding radio toas ( the latter corrected to infinite frequency using the dm from table  [ tab : parms ] ) .",
    "the radio reference phase is the peak of the main radio component , which owing to changing pulse shapes can contribute up to @xmath66 jitter in this comparison .",
    "the x - ray reference phase is the peak of the approximately sinusoidal profile , which has an effective uncertainty of up to @xmath67 for the observations and is a little better for the  profiles .",
    "the measured offset between the x - ray and the radio toas was , in chronological order , 0.21 , 0.03 , @xmath68 , 0.01 , and @xmath69s .",
    "all radio and x - ray toas therefore match to within @xmath70 .",
    "thus , at least between 2006 september and 2008 march , the peak of radio emission coincided with the peak of x - ray emission .",
    "since the main radio pulse coincides with the peak of the x - ray emission , it is reasonable to assume that both radio and x - ray are coming from near the surface , where a hot spot is located at the footpoint of a bundle of magnetic field lines ( for the other two magnetars with detected radio and x - ray pulsations , the radio profile is not as well aligned with , but still overlaps , the x - ray profile ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this picture ,",
    "currents flowing along this field - line bundle are responsible for both surface heating and radio emission .",
    "the x - ray and radio pulses should coincide as long as the field lines are normal to the surface and the radio emission height is much smaller than the radius of the speed of light cylinder . while these are reasonable assumptions for the open field - line bundle in ordinary pulsars , the geometry may be different in the case of magnetars , where currents on closed , twisted magnetic field lines are thought to contribute to x - ray emission via resonant cyclotron scattering @xcite , and the location of the radio emission region is not obvious .",
    "therefore , the rotating vector model ( rvm ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is not necessarily applicable unless the radio emission is produced on open field lines as in ordinary pulsars .",
    "theory and observation are inconclusive as to whether radio emission in magnetars is produced on open or closed magnetic field lines @xcite .    assuming that the rvm applies to magnetars",
    ", @xcite used it to deduce the geometry of the star .",
    "there were two possible solutions depending on whether an orthogonal jump in polarization was introduced between widely spaced pulse components ( p1 and p3 in figure  [ fig : pol]a ) . in the first solution , without an orthogonal jump ,",
    "the magnetic and rotational axes are almost aligned , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , where @xmath43 is the angle between the magnetic and rotation axes , and @xmath73 is the angle of closest approach of the line - of - sight to the magnetic axis .",
    "the second solution , with an orthogonal jump inserted , had @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "new data reported here show a polarized component not present earlier ( p2 in figure  [ fig : pol]b and d , at pulse phase between those of p1 and p3 ) . if we combine all the information on the pa values from different epochs ( namely from data represented in figures  [ fig : pol]a , b , and d ) , we obtain rvm fits which are consistent with those presented in @xcite .",
    "the result is again @xmath71 , @xmath72 with no orthogonal jump .",
    "the addition of an orthogonal jump between components p2 and p3 ( see figure  [ fig : pol]b ) yields @xmath76 and @xmath77",
    ". broadly speaking , therefore , the same arguments apply as before  either the pulsar is aligned , which is problematic given the x - ray pulse properties discussed below , or @xmath43 is large and the emission height , determined from the width of the pulse , is also relatively large , @xmath78 km , about 8% of the light cylinder radius ( see * ? ? ?",
    "it appears that the x - ray spectrum of  has always been dominated by the thermal hot spot and surrounding warm region @xcite , which is supported by the single - peaked x - ray pulse that aligns well in phase as a function of energy .",
    "so the x - ray pulse has been modeled independently of the radio as an indicator of the spin orientation and viewing geometry of a surface hot spot , which can then be compared with the results of the rvm fits under the assumption that the hot spot underlies a perpendicular radio beam .",
    "the most recent such x - ray modeling results @xcite allow , in our notation , @xmath43 in the range @xmath79@xmath80 , which is degenerate with @xmath81 , while @xmath73 ranges from @xmath82 to @xmath83 .",
    "their extreme solutions have @xmath84 or @xmath85 .",
    "neither of the rvm solutions are entirely consistent with the model of the x - ray pulse , although the high pulsed fraction of the harder x - rays would at least seem to rule out a nearly aligned rotator with @xmath86 , and a geometry with @xmath87 seems reasonably compatible with both radio and x - ray observations .",
    "a detailed explanation for the exponential x - ray decay of  was developed by @xcite . in this model",
    ", a bundle of closed , twisted magnetic field lines centered on the magnetic dipole axis carries the current that heats a spot on the surface .",
    "this so - called `` j - bundle '' is the result of a twist of the crust by the starquake that initiated the outburst . as the j - bundle untwists , its boundary recedes toward the magnetic pole ; thus , the area of its footpoint decreases , which accounts for the declining blackbody area fitted to the x - ray spectrum @xcite .",
    "@xcite also accounts for the non - monotonic change in spin - down rate of , which after the outburst first increased then decreased as shown in figure  [ fig : xray]b .",
    "the initial increase in torque is caused by growing twist of field lines near the magnetic axis , even as the outer boundary of the j - bundle is shrinking .",
    "this twist inflates the poloidal field lines , effectively increasing the dipole moment and the magnetic field strength at the light cylinder .",
    "once the twist reaches a maximum stable value of @xmath88 radian , the dipole moment decreases due to the continued contracting of the j - bundle , and the torque decreases .    in this picture ,",
    "radio emission is produced on the closed field lines of the j - bundle , which is wider and more energetic than the open field - line bundle .",
    "therefore , radio emission from a transient magnetar in outburst could be easier to see , both for geometric and energetic reasons , than in its quiescent state .",
    "its radio beam could be broader and different in many respects ( spectrum , polarization , variability ) from those of ordinary radio pulsars .",
    "the radio pulse in this model is coincident with the x - ray pulse , and when the j - bundle contracts to less than the width of the observed radio beam , then the radio emission should decrease rapidly .",
    "however , in this model one may expect the width of the radio pulse to decrease gradually to zero as the j - bundle shrinks , possibly approaching zero width and disappearing when the outer boundary of the emitting region reaches the tangent point to the observer s line of sight .",
    "but this is contrary to the observations , which show no change in the width or complexity of the radio pulse just before it disappeared . the x - ray flux from the hot / warm spot showed at most a 20% decrease ( @xmath65 erg  s@xmath9 ) at the epoch of radio disappearance , when there was no detectable change in spin - down power in the x - ray timing .",
    "since this luminosity change is comparable to or greater than the spin - down power at the time , it is difficult to understand how spin power could be responsible for the event .",
    "probably a more subtle physical process is required to explain the sudden quenching of the radio emission .",
    "@xcite proposed that the ( then ) three radio - detected magnetars share the property that their quiescent x - ray luminosity is smaller than their spin - down power , but not the converse : not all magnetars with @xmath89 are radio pulsars .",
    "however , review of these parameters for  shows that the minimum spin - down power of , which it reached in quiescence in 20072012 , is in the range @xmath90ergs@xmath9 , while its quiescent ( 0.310kev ) x - ray luminosity is @xmath91ergs@xmath9 , uncorrected for absorption , both before and after the outburst @xcite .",
    "the distance of 3.5kpc is taken from @xcite .",
    "the bolometric luminosity of the cool component alone from @xcite is @xmath92ergs@xmath9 .",
    "these values of @xmath93 and @xmath94 disagree with the ones used in @xcite , and do not support their proposition , because the x - ray luminosity of is greater than its spin - down power , whether before , during , or after the outburst .",
    "@xcite explain radio pulsations from magnetars and ordinary radio pulsars by a single model , the partially screened gap .",
    "it assumes that rotational energy heats the open - field - line polar cap , and the resulting temperature , compared with a critical temperature for ion emission , is what determines whether a partially screened gap is maintained . only if the luminosity of the polar cap is much less than the spin - down power is radio emission possible .",
    "however , the temperature of the x - ray / radio emitting cap in  is larger than that of a rotation - powered pulsar with the same timing parameters because it is heated by magnetic field decay , not by rotation . during the outburst of  the polar cap luminosity rose by more than two orders of magnitude while the spin - down luminosity only increased by a factor of 8 .",
    "so it is not clear how this model could explain the onset or turn - off of radio pulsations during the outburst of .",
    "radio pulsations appear to be characteristic of some , but not all transient magnetars in outburst .",
    "the long record left by the single known outburst of  provides a prototype for investigating the mechanism of magnetar radio emission .",
    "the radio flux densities and x - ray fluxes each declined by about a factor of 50 from the peak of the outburst to the year 2006 .",
    "then the x - ray and radio luminosities both levelled off in 2007 .",
    "this large - amplitude correlation would argue that the power for the radio emission comes from the magnetar mechanism that creates currents in the pulsar magnetosphere and heats the neutron star crust , rather than from rotation power .",
    "the radio pulses of  before they turned off continued to show large day - to - day fluctuations , unlike ordinary radio pulsars .",
    "the radio spectrum appears to have changed from flat to steep as the radio ( and x - ray ) emission leveled off .",
    "the emission remained highly polarized , and the observation of a new polarized pulse component allowed us to test and refine the previously derived emission geometry assuming a dipole field geometry .",
    "this was compared with independent modeling of the x - ray pulse , which is coincident in phase with the main radio pulse .",
    "the radio polarization allows two solutions , depending on whether an orthogonal jump in polarization is assumed between pulse components .",
    "however , the almost aligned solution appears inconsistent with the large - amplitude x - ray pulse , so we favor the more inclined model .    finally , the radio pulsations turned off abruptly in late 2008 , and have not reappeared in the subsequent 7 years .",
    "however , a continuing pulse of hard x - rays from a hot spot persists during the radio quiet epoch and exceeds the spin - down luminosity , evidence of continuing magnetar activity .",
    "this should not be thought of as a `` return to quiescence , '' because magnetar activity is not a quiescent state , but a continuing conversion of magnetic energy to luminosity that , for a period of years , may well result in a quasi - constant luminosity .",
    "also , we do not know enough about the pre - outburst state of to determine if it had precisely the same emission properties then as is does now , or if it was truly quiescent prior to the outburst detected in early 2003 .",
    "the sudden radio disappearance prompted us to search for any contemporaneous event in the x - ray record that could be associated .",
    "the only possible such occurrence was a step - down in the x - ray flux of the hot spot by @xmath3 between 2008 march and 2009 march .",
    "although this would appear to be a small effect , it bears some consideration , as none of the other observations and theories offer a natural explanation for the sharp radio turn - off .",
    "this investigation is partly based on observations obtained with , an esa science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by esa member states and nasa , and with .",
