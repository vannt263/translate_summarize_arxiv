    "cosmological tests using high - redshift type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) rule out an @xmath2=1 universe @xcite and provide evidence for an acceleration of the cosmic expansion @xcite , attributed to a nonzero cosmological constant ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the statistical weight of these results is high , so the current focus of our high - z supernova search team @xcite is on systematic effects , most of which can be convincingly tested using sne at @xmath40.8 , regardless of their precise nature .",
    "we expect dimming from systematic effects to grow larger with increasing redshift . however , the effect of a nonzero @xmath3 on apparent magnitude can decrease with increasing redshift , due to the different redshift dependence of @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( see figure 4 of filippenko & riess 2000 ) . obtaining data for sne at @xmath40.8",
    "is therefore critical for testing systematic bias versus real cosmological effects and the presence of a nonzero @xmath6 .",
    "in addition to photometry of high-@xmath0 sne ia needed to determine a luminosity distance for the hubble diagram , we obtain spectra of our sne to measure the redshift , determine the supernova type , and look for spectral differences between the low-@xmath0 and high-@xmath0 sn ia populations that may indicate evolution of sne with time . here",
    "we present spectra of two high-@xmath0 sne ia and address uncertainties in using the spectra to determine redshifts and the sn type .",
    "details of the observing program , finder charts , and light curves will be presented by tonry et al .",
    "sn 1999ff @xcite was observed with lris ( oke et al .",
    "1995 ) on the keck - ii 10-m telescope on 1999 november 8 ut with 0.7@xmath7 seeing .",
    "use of a 1@xmath7 slit and the 150 line mm@xmath8 grating resulted in a spectral resolution of @xmath120  .",
    "the total exposure time was 2200 s , divided into three exposures dithered 10@xmath7 along the slit to reduce the effects of fringing .",
    "the slit was oriented at a position angle ( pa ) of 156@xmath9 to include the galaxy nucleus .",
    "sn 1999fv @xcite was observed with the same setup on 1999 november 10 ut .",
    "the seeing was 0.9@xmath7 , and a slit width of 0.7@xmath7 resulted in a spectral resolution of @xmath116  .",
    "the slit was oriented to pa=252@xmath9 to include a star .",
    "the total exposure time was 6000 s , taken in four dithered frames .",
    "sn 1999fv was also observed on 1999 november 11 ut with the 400 line mm@xmath8 grating , with a 1.0@xmath7 slit at the same pa and 1@xmath7 seeing , in four dithered exposures of 1000 s each .",
    "standard ccd processing and optimal spectral extraction were done with iraf , and we used our own idl routines to calibrate the wavelengths and flux of the spectra and to correct for telluric absorption bands .",
    "the sn 1999fv data from both nights were combined , after binning to the same resolution . only the first two exposures from november 11 were used , as the last two were overwhelmingly dominated by sky noise .",
    "rest - frame spectra of sn 1999ff and sn 1999fv are shown in figure 1 .",
    "the observed wavelength range for sn 1999ff is 40507700  , corresponding to 27855290   in the rest frame , while for sn 1999fv the observed wavelength range is 62009150  , corresponding to 28304180   in the rest frame .",
    "sn 1999ff is located @xmath12@xmath10 from the center of a large , bright elliptical galaxy with @xmath11=19.1 mag , whereas the sn was @xmath123 mag . to eliminate contamination from the host galaxy , we scaled and subtracted the host galaxy spectrum from the sn spectrum .",
    "the high-@xmath0 spectra have been smoothed with a savitsky - golay filter @xcite , a polynomial fit that preserves line features better than boxcar smoothing .",
    "the spectra of sn 1999ff and sn 1999fv were heavily smoothed with a 70   and 180   filter width , respectively , in the rest frame .    for sn 1999ff",
    "we estimate the age based on its spectral features @xcite to be 5 @xmath122 days .",
    "photometric data of sn 1999ff will be presented by @xcite and will determine the true epoch of maximum brightness .",
    "sn 1999fv was significantly fainter and we were unable to get a reliable spectral age for it , in part due to the lack of available early - time spectra of low-@xmath0 sne ia that extend blueward of 4000  .",
    "the redshift of the host galaxy of sn 1999ff is @xmath0=0.455 @xmath120.001 , as determined by balmer absorption lines in its spectrum , and we adopt this redshift for the sn .",
    "the host galaxy of sn 1999fv was not visible in our images , and to calculate the redshift of this sn we cross - correlated the high-@xmath0 spectrum with several low-@xmath0 sn ia spectra near maximum light ( as defined by the @xmath13-band maximum ) , the ages of which are determined from their light curves .",
    "correlating against a sample of 31 spectra with ages between @xmath148 days to + 5 days relative to maximum , the redshift of sn 1999fv is @xmath0=1.17 - 1.22 for the unsmoothed spectrum , somewhat lower than the initial estimate of tonry et al .",
    "( 1999 ; @xmath0=1.23 ) made at the telescope . using the same technique on the spectrum of sn 1999ff , correlating against a sample of 18 spectra with ages between 7 and 3 days , we find @xmath0=0.458@xmath120.006 , consistent with the host galaxy redshift .",
    "we also include galaxy and m - star spectra among our templates for cross - correlation , which did not fit the high-@xmath0 spectra well .",
    "the redshift of sn 1999fv has the quoted uncertainty ( 1.171.22 ) due to the low signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio of the spectrum , and to its high redshift placing key sn features near bright sky lines at observed wavelengths @xmath15  . in order to check the validity of our redshift estimates , we performed blind tests with fake spectra added to the 2d frames .",
    "we redshifted each of 14 low-@xmath0 sn ia spectra by an arbitrary amount between @xmath0=0.5 and @xmath0=1.3 , scaled the flux level down to the signal of sn 1999fv in each 1000 s exposure , and added poisson noise .",
    "we added the spectra to the 2d frames ( which are dominated by sky emission ) , convolving the signal with a gaussian across several pixels perpendicular to the dispersion , imitating seeing effects .",
    "each spectrum was then extracted , and we verified that its s / n ratio as a agreed with that of sn 1999fv . the spectrum was smoothed heavily with a savitsky - golay filter to get an initial redshift estimate by eye , and subsequently cross - correlated with a database of low - z spectra to find a quantitative redshift estimate and uncertainty .",
    "we obtained good results for 12 of the 14 spectra , all of which matched the input redshift to within the error bars . for one spectrum",
    "we were unable to estimate the redshift , as the signal was dominated by sky lines and sn features were not clearly visible .",
    "for another spectrum we obtained two equally likely redshifts , one of which was the correct input redshift . in neither of these two cases",
    "were we led to believe an incorrect redshift .",
    "the redshift range for sn 1999fv of z=1.171.22 is roughly a 95@xmath16-confidence level , based on the tests done .",
    "it is important to note that the difference in luminosity distance at z=1.17 and z=1.22 is 0.11 mag ( 5@xmath16 ) which is much smaller than our distance uncertainty .",
    "this redshift uncertainty therefore has negligible impact on our ability to constrain cosmology .",
    "the largest concern with using sne ia in cosmological tests is a possible photometric difference between the low-@xmath0 and high-@xmath0 samples .",
    "spectral comparisons of the distant and nearby sne could show subtle evolutionary effects , if present .",
    "if the spectra do not show differences , this does not prove that the peak luminosities of the sne are identical , but it does build confidence that the two samples are similar .",
    "spectra of normal , nearby sne ia at the same phase are quite homogeneous @xcite . as a qualitative comparison with our high-@xmath0 spectra , we present in figure 1 spectra of four low-@xmath0 sne ia near the same epoch : sn 1989b at both 7 and 1 days relative to maximum @xcite , sn 1992a at 1 day @xcite , and sn 1981b at maximum @xcite .",
    "the sn 1989b spectra have been dereddened by @xmath17 ",
    "@xmath18)=0.32 mag @xcite .",
    "the 1 day sn 1989b spectrum is a composite of a ctio spectrum redward of 3300 and an _ international ultraviolet explorer _ ( _ iue _ ) spectrum from 4 days blueward of 3300  .",
    "the sn 1992a spectrum is a composite of a ctio spectrum redward of 3600   and a _ hubble space telescope _ ( @xmath19 ) spectrum blueward of 3600  , taken 5 days after maximum @xcite . for comparison",
    "we also show sne ii , ib , and ic spectra : sn iib 1993j @xcite , sn ib 1998dt at maximum @xcite , and sn ic 1994i at 4 days , dereddened by @xmath17 ",
    "@xmath18)=0.45 mag ( filippenko et al .",
    "1995 ; see filippenko 1997 for a discussion of sn subclasses ) .",
    "the sn 1998dt spectrum has been smoothed with a 30   savitsky - golay filter .",
    "we also show an _ iue _ spectrum of sn ib 1983n at 4 days from 2800 to 3300   @xcite at the blue end of the sn ib 1998dt spectrum to compare with the high-@xmath0 spectra .",
    "the sn iib 1993j spectrum , taken 16 days past discovery and 3 days relative to maximum , resembles a relatively normal sn ii .",
    "the sn 1999ff spectrum exhibits many of the features seen in the low-@xmath0 sn ia spectra , most prominently the deep h&k absorption ( `` a '' ) , the @xmath204130 dip blueshifted to 4000   ( `` b '' ) , @xmath204555 and/or @xmath204481 ( `` d '' ) , and @xmath205051 ( `` i '' ) .",
    "there are several weaker features seen in all of the low-@xmath0 sn ia spectra that are also apparent in the spectrum of sn 1999ff , including a shoulder blueward of @xmath204555 ( `` c '' ) , @xmath204560 ( `` e '' ) , @xmath204816 ( `` f '' ) , and / blends ( `` g '' and `` h '' ) .",
    "all line identifications ( but not the specific letter labels ) are from jeffery et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , kirshner et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , and mazzali et al .",
    "unfortunately , the sn 1999ff spectrum does not extend to rest wavelength 6150  , where the @xmath206355 feature is prominent in sne ia and much less apparent in sne ic / ib .",
    "this line is the usual diagnostic for distinguishing between sne ia and ib / ic .",
    "sn 1999ff does not , however , resemble the spectra of sn ib 1998dt or sn ic 1994i , in which the and features `` b '' and `` e '' are either very weak or absent . the sn ib and ic spectra also have a broad peak centered at 5250   that is not seen in sn 1999ff or the sn ia spectra . a comparison with the sn iib 1993j spectrum shows that while sn 1993j does have h&k ( `` a '' ) and absorption at 3980   due to blueshifted h@xmath21 which results in a double - peak centered just blueward of 4000  , the resemblance with sn 1999ff redward of 4100",
    "  is poor .",
    "very early sn ii spectra are blue and nearly featureless and would be easily classified ; they begin to resemble the sn iib 1993j spectrum shown here a few weeks after discovery .    due to its high redshift",
    ", the spectrum of sn 1999fv does not have broad rest - frame coverage and does not extend redward of 4200  .",
    "sn 1999fv does display the h&k feature ( `` a '' ) as well as @xmath204130 ( `` b '' ) .",
    "in the uv region of the spectrum , there are perhaps hints of small rises at 3150   and just blueward of 3000  , as seen in the _ iue _ spectra of sn ia 1992a and sn ic 1983n .",
    "sn 1999fv is bluer than the low-@xmath0 spectra below 3700  . our discovery image for this object does not reveal an obvious host galaxy , and it is unlikely that the blue color is due to host galaxy contamination as sn 1999fv was at least 1 to 1.5 mag brighter than the host .",
    "the sn ib 1998dt and sn ic 1994i spectra provide a worse match to sn 1999fv around 4000   than do the normal sne ia .",
    "while the spectrum of sn 1999fv has a limited rest - frame wavelength range , the presence of the @xmath204130 ( `` b '' ) feature is very important , as it results in a broad double - peak in the spectrum centered at @xmath14000   that is not seen in sn ib / ic spectra @xcite , which show a small dip at this wavelength but lack a strong peak just redward at @xmath14100  .",
    "thus , even for @xmath41 sne with noisy spectra , it is possible to distinguish features that differentiate sne ia from ib and ic events near 4000  .",
    "the sn iib 1993j spectrum has a double - peak centered near 4000  , but the widths of the features blueward of 4200   are significantly narrower than in the sn ia spectra and the sn 1999fv spectrum .",
    "in general , substantial contamination of the high-@xmath0 sne ia sample with sne ic , ib , and ii seems unlikely .",
    "first , typical sne ic , ib , and iib are much fainter than sne ia ; on average , the @xmath13-band peak brightness of sne ib and ic is @xmath11.5 mag lower , while sne ii are @xmath11.8 mag lower ( miller & branch 1990 ; richmond et al .",
    ". however , clocchiatti et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have found a very luminous sn ic , and if such objects are common at high redshift they might contaminate the sample .",
    "second , nearby sne ic , ib , and iib are rarer than sne ia , with a relative rate of 0.25 to 0.5 @xcite , though the relative rates are likely to increase at high redshift . additional photometric data ( light - curve shapes ) are useful in ruling out contamination from sne ic , ib , iib , and ii .",
    "we do not believe that there is confusion with very luminous , peculiar sne ic , also known as `` hypernovae , '' in the high-@xmath0 sample , as their spectra are quite dissimilar from those of our high-@xmath0 objects @xcite .    although the analysis techniques of hamuy et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and riess et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , in which light - curve shapes are used to derive luminosity corrections , can be applied to sne ia having a range of luminosities and light - curve shapes , it is of interest to determine whether the proportion of peculiar high-@xmath0 sne ia differs from that at low-@xmath0 . in figure 2",
    "we compare our spectra of sn 1999ff and 1999fv to the two archetypical , very peculiar sne ia : overluminous sn 1991 t at 5 days @xcite and underluminous sn 1991bg at maximum @xcite .",
    "our two high-@xmath0 sne ia do not appear to be these kinds of peculiar events , as seen by the lack of correlation of their spectral features with those of sn 1991 t and sn 1991bg .",
    "sn 1991 t lacks h&k as well as @xmath224130 , 5051 , and exhibits strong lines that are not seen in sn 1999ff and sn 1999fv .",
    "sn 1991bg , on the other hand , shows prominent h&k absorption but lacks the usual lines and has several features not seen in the high-@xmath0 spectra or in normal sne ia .    as a further comparison with peculiar sne ia",
    ", we show in figure 2 a spectrum of sn 1999aa taken at 1 day .",
    "this object is similar to sn 1991 t but also exhibits h&k absorption .",
    "several recent low-@xmath0 sne ia of this nature have now been classified @xcite .",
    "while our two high-@xmath0 sne ia are not peculiar in the sense of sn 1991t - like and sn 1991bg - like events , they do share some features with the spectrum of sn 1999aa .",
    "however , they agree best with the normal sne ia shown in figure 1 . we conclude that sn 1999ff is a relatively normal sn ia , and we do not see any compelling evidence for sn 1999fv being a very peculiar sn ia , though wider wavelength coverage and higher s / n ratios would permit a more definitive comparison .",
    "in addition , more uv sn ia spectra are needed to better understand the nature of peculiar and normal sne ia at these wavelengths .",
    "we present spectra of two high-@xmath0 sne ia discovered during our late-1999 high-@xmath0 sn search campaign @xcite .",
    "exposure of a sn at @xmath0 @xmath10.5 yields a high - quality spectrum with detailed features from which a spectral age can be derived .",
    "a 130-min .",
    "exposure of a sn at @xmath0 @xmath11.2 results in a moderate - quality spectrum with prominent , broad features .",
    "the redshift of sn 1999ff is 0.455 , as given by stellar absorption lines in the host galaxy , and from spectral features we estimate the age to be 5 @xmath23 days . for sn 1999fv",
    "we use the spectrum to determine a redshift of 1.171.22 .",
    "we find that the double - peak in the spectrum centered at @xmath14000   and the strength of the @xmath204130 line can be used as a diagnostic for distinguishing sne ia from sne ib and ic when the usual @xmath206355 feature is not available , as is often the case for high-@xmath0 sne . however , moderate - quality spectra are needed to determine the sn type , especially for @xmath41 sne .",
    "we conclude that sn 1999ff is most consistent with normal sne ia , and that sn 1999fv is a sn ia and is not peculiar in the sense of sn 1991 t and sn 1991bg - like objects .",
