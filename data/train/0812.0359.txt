    "i discuss two related topics .",
    "the first is an approximate evaluation of the qcd coupling at zero momentum , @xmath3 , using the functional schrdinger equation ( fse ) .",
    "the second is the beginning of a program , not completed , for relating chiral symmetry breakdown ( csb ) properties for both quarks and ( hypothetical ) adjoint dirac fermions in qcd to @xmath3 .",
    "this program can be looked on as using known csb results ( from the lattice ) to constrain the allowed range of @xmath3 or as using a theoretically - determined value of @xmath3 to predict the csb properties .",
    "the present accuracy of some preliminary investigations of these issues is not high enough to be definitive , but it does suggest that @xmath3 in the range 0.6@xmath40.2 is consistent with known properties of csb .",
    "the fse has long been of interest to me @xcite ; more recently , motivated by a talk @xcite of s. olenk at the 2006 oberwlz symposium , i wrote a paper last year @xcite , one conclusion of which is an estimate of the @xmath5 strong coupling constant at zero ( or small ) momentum , @xmath6 .",
    "this estimate is somewhat unusual since this estimate is based on one - loop gluon gap equations and lattice numerics in @xmath7 , not @xmath5 , plus some theory that attempts to relate @xmath7 qcd to @xmath5 qcd through the fse .",
    "the @xmath7 studies @xcite vary somewhat , but in my view ( ref .",
    "@xcite argues that the one - loop gap - equation results for @xmath0 are too small ) the most reliable value for the ratio @xmath1 is @xmath8 ( for gauge group @xmath9 ) , where @xmath0 is the dynamical gluon mass and @xmath10 is the @xmath7 gauge coupling .",
    "fse theoretical estimates suggest @xmath11 .",
    "there are , of course , other estimates of @xmath3 : phenomenology sensitive to infrared properties of qcd gives @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "other pinch - technique calculations @xcite suggest @xmath13 , just as i use here .",
    "recently , lattice simulations @xcite have been reported for an interesting question with a long lineage @xcite : how does csb work in qcd with adjoint fermions instead of the usual fundamental - representation quarks ?",
    "these authors works state that there is csb for quenched adjoint fermions not only at temperatures below the deconfinement phase transition but also up to a temperature exceeding the deconfinement phase transition .",
    "in contrast , for quarks there is no csb above the deconfinement phase transition , consistent with lattice findings @xcite that center vortices , the standard confinement machinery of today , are both necessary and sufficient for csb with quarks .",
    "adjoint fermions , blind to the long - range parts of center vortices , are not confined and the argument is , therefore , that there are different mechanisms for csb for fundamental and adjoint fermions .",
    "i do not claim to have definitively answered this question , but present numerical estimates based both on estimates of @xmath3 and on fermion gap equations that have appropriate kernels for small momentum suggest an answer that , given fairly large uncertainties , seems to accord with present - day knowledge from the lattice .",
    "what i report here is at best the beginning of a program of refining our quantitative understanding of qcd by comparing estimates of @xmath3 with lattice and theoretical studies of adjoint csb .",
    "theoretical papers from long ago @xcite argue that various confinement mechanisms produce csb for quarks .",
    "( later i will give a brief update of some of these ideas , based on the role of a condensate of center vortices and their close relatives , nexuses , in confinement and csb ) .",
    "these confining mechanisms depend only indirectly on @xmath3 . in principle",
    "it could be ( although the lattice data say otherwise ) that there would be csb for quarks even with no confinement , a possibility that does depend on @xmath3 .",
    "generally , csb for quarks and adjoint fermions should be sensitive to three couplings : ( 1 ) the standard qcd coupling @xmath14 at zero momentum transfer ; ( 2 ) the critical coupling @xmath15 above which csb occurs for fundamental - representation fermions ( quarks ) as found from a gap equation that does _ not _ contain confinement effects ; and ( 3 ) @xmath16 , the same coupling for ( quenched ) adjoint fermions . because these last two couplings differ from the first only by casimir factors , the critical couplings for gap equations are inversely proportional to @xmath17 , the quadratic casimir eigenvalue for the fermions in the gap equation , and so for qcd , @xmath18 .",
    "however , just knowing this is not enough to settle the issue of whether csb can or can not take place through a standard gap equation for quarks or adjoint fermions ; we need not just the ratios but also the values of the critical couplings to compare with estimates from other qcd models of the couplings",
    ".    there are in principle three possibilities : @xmath19 in the first case only quarks can show csb , and confinement is necessary for quark csb . in the second case ( which is favored",
    "both from the lattice data and from the estimates i give here ) there is csb for both adjoint and fundamental fermions .",
    "confinement is again necessary for quark csb , whose transition temperature must be rather near that of the deconfinement transition ; the gap equation is largely irrelevant , althouogh it may account for some separation in these two transition temperatures ..",
    "csb for adjoint fermions comes solely from non - confining effects as summarized in a gap equation , and adjoint - fermion csb may or may not extend above the deconfinement transition . in the third case ,",
    "there is csb for both kinds of fermions , and this ought to persist even if confiners such as center vortices are removed from the lattice simulations .",
    "since there is more than a factor of two between adjoint and fundamental critical couplings , the inequality in the second case is a fairly broad one and great accuracy is not needed to single out this case .",
    "fermion gap equations have a long history , beginning with the jbw equation @xcite , and nearly all previous work that does not address confinement issues makes three approximations : 1 ) gluons are massless ; 2 ) landau gauge is used ; 3 ) because to one - loop order in this gauge vertex corrections are not ultraviolet - divergent , vertex corrections are ignored .",
    "non - perturbative phenomena of low - energy qcd require a more careful treatment that i will sketch here .",
    "in the first place , infrared slavery implies dynamic gluon mass generation , which can be only studied effectively in the gauge - invariant pinch technique @xcite . in the second place , because fermion mass generation is an infrared effect there may be important low - energy fermion - gluon vertex corrections .",
    "finally , the possibility of such corrections requires a more careful study of gauge invariance of the gap equation . to some extent",
    "these issues have been addressed before @xcite , but not in a context particularly useful here . in the present work",
    "i include a dynamical gluon mass in the gluon propagator ; give a sketch of the derivation of a gauge - invariant gap equation using the pinch technique ( which seems not to have been addressed in detail before ) ; and use the gauge technique to infer approximate low - momentum vertex corrections that satisfy the correct ward identities of the pinch technique .",
    "the simplest application of these principles , all that i report here , yields a gap equation much like the jbw @xcite equation except that the gluon is massive .",
    "the work reported here is still very much in progress , and needs considerable sharpening .",
    "however , i believe it is already at the point where one can qualitatively see and explain the differences between csb for quarks and for adjoint fermions .",
    "this work has already been published @xcite so i will be brief here . the vacuum wave functional of qcd is a gauge - invariant functional that i write in the form : @xmath20 in which @xmath21 is a real gauge - invariant @xmath7 effective action ( a factor of two because @xmath22 is the weight function for constructing vacuum expectation values ) .",
    "it is constructed to satisfy @xmath23 with hamiltonian @xmath24+v.\\ ] ] the functional @xmath25 has infinitely many terms : @xmath26 gauge invariance requires @xcite that @xmath27 be conserved , and any two successive terms in the expansion are related by ghost - free ward identities . even the simplest of these terms for a free gauge theory is not familiar as an effective action , because it has a square root : @xmath28 here @xmath29 is the usual transverse projector : @xmath30    my approach to the fse ( and later to the fermion gap equations ) begins with the fact that qcd , because of infrared slavery , undergoes dynamical gluon mass generation @xcite .",
    "the fse must display this fact ; how does it do so ?",
    "it is easy to describe in a toy model , an abelian gauge theory with gauge - invariant mass @xmath31 put in by hand .",
    "the hamiltonian is : @xmath32\\}\\ ] ] the corresponding @xmath25 that exactly satisfies this hamiltonian is : @xmath33    once i add the mass , a nonlocality appears from the transverse projector . but this is easily remedied , by introducing a scalar field in the mass term : and project out its gauge - independent part by integrating over all gauge transformations of the gauge potential . ]",
    "@xmath34 ^ 2\\ ] ] and functionally integrating over not only the gauge potentials but also over @xmath35 when constructing vacuum expectation values .",
    "this is entirely equivalent to using the non - local transverse projector .",
    "note that the mass term by itself satisfies a fse with the @xmath36 term missing from the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ abelham ] ) .",
    "since we are interested in infrared effects , it is reasonable to make an expansion in inverse powers of the mass @xmath0 ( or equivalently in powers of the gradient operator ) .",
    "the leading term is @xmath37 and is just the mass term @xmath38 itself .",
    "however , a naive expansion runs into a little bit of trouble , as we see by expanding the square root in the exact abelian solution : @xmath39 p_{ij}a_j.\\ ] ] ( observe that the second and succeeding terms in the expansion are local ; in fact , the second term is , up to a factor @xmath40 , the usual @xmath36 term . )",
    "if only these two terms are kept , the field has mass @xmath41 and not @xmath0 .",
    "higher - order terms not written must correct for this discrepancy .",
    "of course , no such expansion in @xmath40 is necessary for the abelian case , but it is for the non - abelian case , and requires @xcite a somewhat better approximation to the square root which is usable for momenta whose components are comparable in size to @xmath0 .",
    "how does this go for the non - abelian case ?",
    "i have argued for decades @xcite that one describes locally gauge - invariant gauge - boson mass generation through a gauged non - linear sigma model ( gnsm ) , analogous to the local mass action @xmath42 above . to simplify the notation i use the anti - hermitean matrix gauge potential @xmath43 where the @xmath44 are the standard gell - mann matrices , and covariant derivative @xmath45 introduce a unitary matrix @xmath46 , with the gauge transformation properties @xmath47 when the gauge potential is transformed by : @xmath48",
    "then the locally gauge - invariant gnsm mass term is : @xmath49 ^ 2.\\ ] ] the non - covariant derivative @xmath50 is the non - abelian generalization of the abelian scalar @xmath51 ; in fact , the gnsm action can be written as : @xmath52 ^ 2.\\ ] ] one can , just as in the abelian case , eliminate @xmath46 through its equations of motion ( that is , minimize @xmath53 ) , which are ( after some non - trivial algebra ) : @xmath54=0.\\ ] ] the perturbative solution has infinitely many terms , of which a few are @xcite : @xmath55+\\frac{1}{2}[\\partial \\cdot a,\\frac{1 } { \\nabla^2}\\partial \\cdot a]+\\cdots \\right \\}\\ ] ] the linear term simply generates the transverse projector i have already used in the abelian case . in addition , there are non - perturbative solutions relevant for center vortices .",
    "i claim that this gnsm mass term is the leading term in the @xmath40 expansion of an effective action that capture the leading non - perturbative effect of infrared slavery , which is dynamic gluon mass generation .",
    "( it also captures the structure of massless poles in the pinch - technique schwinger - dyson equation yielding the mass dynamically . )",
    "it is a good candidate for the leading term of the effective action @xmath25 because it is gauge - invariant ; indeed , just as in the abelian case , it comes from projecting out the non - abelian gauge invariant from the simple @xmath56 mass term .",
    "it is almost evident without calculation that the next - leading term should be the usual yang - mills term , which is just the non - abelian gauge completion of the abelian term shown in eq .",
    "( [ sqroot ] ) : @xmath57 ^ 2-\\frac{1}{4g^2 m } \\int tr g_{ij}^2+\\dots\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the usual yang - mills field strength .",
    "the normalization of the second term follows from the fact that the quadratic term in @xmath25 is just the abelian action of eq .",
    "( [ sqroot ] ) , one copy for each gauge boson .",
    "but just as in the abelian case this wrongly yields a free - field mass of @xmath41 instead of @xmath0 .",
    "i have proposed @xcite to cure this approximately by choosing a renormalization factor @xmath59 that best approximates the actual square root operator of the fse with a two - term expansion ; the result for the approximate two - term action @xmath60 is : @xmath61 ^ 2\\}+\\frac{z}{mg^2 } \\int d^3x trg_{ij}^2+\\mathcal{o}(m^{-3})\\ ] ] with @xmath62 .",
    "the final step is to compare this to the standard @xmath7 form of gauge - invariant massive qcd for the given mass @xmath0 , which is : @xmath63",

    "the results are quite consistent with an average value of @xmath68 .",
    "one can roughly convert the no - quark coupling in eq .",
    "( [ compare2 ] ) to three light flavors by multiplying the right side of eq .",
    "( [ compare2 ] ) by 11/9 , and the resulting value of the strong coupling at zero momentum is : @xmath69    this estimate and other quite similar pinch - technique estimates @xcite , combined with phenomenology @xcite that gives somewhat higher values , suggests that @xmath70 .",
    "i will now see how this range of values fits into fermion gap equations for csb .",
    "the first step is to understand the difference between gap equations that purport to show the effects of confinement and those that do not .",
    "i will not do that in any detail here , but simply draw a few conclusions from the fact that confinement comes from the long - range pure - gauge parts of center vortices , which are quantum solitons of an effective action of the type given in eq .",
    "( [ cand3 ] ) or its @xmath5 extension . because of complications having to do with integrating over center - vortex collective coordinates , it is easiest to present the argument in @xmath71 , where i will use not the familiar action of @xmath71 yang - mills theory but rather the effective action , with a mass term , of eq .",
    "( [ cand3 ] ) in two dimensions @xcite .",
    "( i have argued @xcite that this is ( possibly up to an overall factor ) the correct action for the @xmath72 fse vacuum wave functional , and that leaving out the mass term can not be right ; the reason is that without the mass term wilson loops of all representations show an area law , while with it only @xmath73-ality @xmath74 0 representations are confined , which is correct for @xmath72 .",
    "but all this is irrelevant to the present argument . )",

    "the vector @xmath80 is a collective coordinate for translations , and i do not indicate collective coordinates for group rotations .",
    "a gluon propagator can be defined by integrating the product of two soliton potentials over their common collective coordinates : @xmath81}(-2)tr(q_j^2)a_i(x - a;k)a_j(y - a;k).\\ ] ]    this propagator has a long - range part coming from the @xmath82 term , and the remainder is short - range . the full gluon propagator , with both terms , can be used in the gap equation for the pinch - technique fermion propagator .",
    "this gap equation is derived from an s - matrix element , or equivalently from some complicated functional of a wilson loop .",
    "the long - range pure - gauge parts are detected by their linkage with the wilson loop . if a vortex is inside the loop it gives a non - trivial center element ; otherwise it gives unity .",
    "since there are no non - trivial elements for @xmath73-ality zero representations , such as the adjoint , the adjoint fermion is completely blind to them and sees only the short - range parts .",
    "so for quarks the gap equation should be described with a gluon propagator containing the long - range pure - gauge terms , which gives the long - range gluon propagator : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the gauge propagator of @xmath71 qcd .",
    "this propagator , singular at large distances , not only confines quarks , it breaks csb .",
    "( generally in @xmath85 dimensions the propagator behaves like @xmath86 , which i used in @xmath5 in an earlier discussion @xcite of confinement and csb . )",
    "the remaining short - range part couples to all fermions with strength proportional to the quadratic casimir @xmath17 , and has range @xmath40 .",
    "in fact , these short - range soliton parts must sum to a standard massive gauge propagator of the form ( omitting the group labels ) : @xmath87 i have written this propagator in the form given by the pinch technique , where the physical part is both gauge - invariant ( unlike conventional propagators ) and transverse .",
    "the last term on the right is a necessary but inert term depending on the chosen gauge that can not enter any pinch - technique physical prediction . in particular",
    ", it must cancel out in pinch - technique fermion gap equations .",
    "in this section i briefly mention the older gap equations , which are oriented toward ultraviolet behavior .",
    "then i go onto newer equations that treat the infrared regime of qcd more accurately , including a quick discussion of a pinch - technique gap equation .",
    "more details on these newer gap equations will be published elsewhere .",
    "the history of gap equations , from the johnson - baker - willey ( jbw ) equation of the sixties @xcite to work of the nineties , can be traced from various specializations of an approximate gap equation for the csb - breaking running fermion mass @xmath88 : @xmath89 an often - studied variant , and the only one i will consider explicitly , drops the non - linear fermion mass terms in the denominator of the fermion propagator on the right side of the equation , replacing @xmath90 by @xmath91 .",
    "trouble arises with any linearized gap equation that has a massless gluon propagator , because it is impossible to have a finite fermion mass @xmath92 at zero momentum .",
    "removing this problem by keeping the full non - linear equation with a massless gluon and a fermion mass in the denominator is not really a good solution , since the only mass scale would have to come from the running charge , which is essentially constant in the low - momentum regime where the non - linear fermion mass is needed as an infrared cutoff .",
    "in fact the fundamental infrared cutoff is the gluon mass @xmath0 and i expect that @xmath93 .",
    "jbw used the linearized equation for qed , where @xmath94 , the charge does not run , the photon mass @xmath0 vanishes , and @xmath31 is the electron mass , supposed to be generated spontaneously in massless qed .",
    "the idea was to show that this equation leads to a running mass vanishing at large momentum , hence requiring no bare mass counterterm . when this equation is used for qcd",
    ", @xmath17 is the quadratic casimir eigenvalue , @xmath0 is the gluon mass , and @xmath95 is the running qcd charge .",
    "( in principle the dynamical gluon mass @xmath96 must run too @xcite , but since the most important effect of this mass is in the infrared region i will not include such running . )",
    "the master gap equation is a simplified form of the schwinger - dyson equations for the fermion propagator @xmath97 , which has the form : @xmath98.\\ ] ] as defined , the fermion  mass \" is essentially gauge - invariant , at least in the sense that its ultraviolet anomalous dimension is gauge - invariant . in practice , most workers specialize to the landau gauge because large - momentum radiative corrections to the fermion - gluon vertex are absent in one - loop order , so it is argued that in this gauge it should be a decent approximation to ignore vertex corrections and set ( using the qed ward identity ) @xmath99 for all momenta .",
    "i will also use landau gauge and assume @xmath100 does not change much with momentum , although this requires a few words of justification for the pinch technique / gauge technique approach given later .",
    "the linearized fermion gap equation has the generic matrix form @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the kernel , derived from the single skeleton graph for the inverse fermion propagator .",
    "there is always a chiral - symmetry - preserving solution @xmath103 , but we seek csb - breaking solutions with @xmath104 . if the kernel is a well - behaved ( finite - dimensional , bounded ) matrix it is clear that csb can only occur if @xmath105 is sufficiently large ; otherwise the determinant @xmath106 will not vanish . actually , @xmath102 ( from , for example , eq .  ( [ jbw ] ) )",
    "is not that well - behaved , but in the equations we use there is a critical coupling @xmath107 marking the boundary between csb and chiral symmetry preservation ; most students of gap equations give rather similar values for this critical coupling .",
    "there are two forms of criticality : the first is based on a differential equation derived from the gap equation",
    ". its solution may be well - behaved for sufficiently small coupling , and then show unphysical features , such as alternation of signs of the running fermion mass , for larger coupling .",
    "the second is based on the original linearized integral equation , which imposes a boundary condition equivalent to consistency between the left - hand and right - hand sides of the gap equation evaluated at zero momentum .",
    "consistency fails if the coupling is too small . whether either or both criticality criteria hold depends on the gap equation , as i will show by an explicit example .",
    "now i give some simple special cases , the first of which is well - known , of the master gap equation of eq .",
    "( [ jbw ] ) .",
    "the first is the original jbw equation used to study possible dynamical generation of the electron mass in qed .",
    "the jbw equation sets @xmath105 to a constant and has no mass terms in the propagators on the right side . with the aid of @xmath108 the jbw equation (",
    "now for qcd , so @xmath17 is reinstated ) becomes the differential equation @xmath109 where @xmath110 and the primes indicate derivatives with respect to @xmath111 .",
    "there are two linearly - independent solutions : @xmath112^{1/2}\\}\\ ] ] for small coupling the @xmath113 solution decreases roughly at large momentum like @xmath114 and is commonly called infrared - dominated ; the @xmath115 solution corresponds to the original jbw solution , which falls off very slowly at large momentum and is called ultraviolet - dominated .",
    "although we may term one of the solutions infrared - dominated , this does not mean that it can be used for small momenta ; in fact , both @xmath116 diverge .",
    "the infrared - dominated solution is only useful in the ultraviolet .",
    "these solutions @xmath117 are not appropriate for finding the ultraviolet behavior in qcd , where the charge runs at large momentum .",
    "this issue was first clarified by lane @xcite , who showed that the master gap equation with a running charge and no masses exactly captures the ultraviolet behavior of the fermion running mass . at large momentum",
    "the gluon mass @xmath0 can be dropped in the denominators , and the running coupling has its usual behavior ( at leading order ) @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the leading term in the @xmath120-function ( @xmath121 ) and @xmath122 is the qcd mass . with the aid of",
    "the renormalization group lane showed that the ultraviolet behavior appropriate to csb is : @xmath123",
    "i will recover this behavior later in a jbw - like equation with both a gluon mass and a running charge .",

    "there is certainly no reason to accept as physical a running fermion mass that alternates in sign .",
    "i have already noted that for a well - behaved kernel @xmath105 must exceed a certain value for csb to take place , yet for the simple jbw equation criticality marks the onset of apparently unphysical behavior .",
    "so is criticality in the jbw equation at all related to csb ?",
    "the general answer is yes , although csb may require a somewhat different value from @xmath107 .",
    "there are in fact a few reasons to believe that @xmath107 above is indeed close to the true critical coupling for csb .",
    "for example , miransky @xcite and his collaborators @xcite have studied the positronium bethe - salpeter equation and find that if @xmath129 tachyonic levels appear .",
    "they relate these to vacuum rearrangment and scale - breaking phenomena , of which csb is an example , and compare the oscillatory behavior of equations like the jbw equation with supercritical coupling to the quantum - mechanical problem of fall into the center or to the behavior of solutions to the dirac equation with supercritical qed charge @xmath130 .",
    "in fact , the jbw differential equation is nothing but the radial schrdinger equation at zero angular momentum and energy for an attractive potential @xmath131 : @xmath132 this potential shows fall into the center if @xmath133 , which is just the critical coupling given above .",
    "the qcd critical coupling of refs .",
    "@xcite would be @xmath134 , not much different from the jbw critical value .",
    "others ( see @xcite and references therein ) claim that the jbw value is the critical coupling for the pion bethe - salpeter equation to admit a massless pion .",
    "so i will assume that a critical coupling deduced from the gap equation is close to , if somewhat below , the critical coupling above which there is csb .",
    "the renormalization group can not say anything about the behavior of @xmath88 at low momentum , where ( among other things ) it becomes necessary to include the effects of the gluon mass @xmath0 not only on the propagator but also on the running coupling .",
    "i and others ( see @xcite , which has many references to other works ) claim that in qcd there is a quasi - conformal infrared regime where the running charge @xmath95 is only slowly changing with momentum .",
    "long ago it was argued @xcite that a decent approximation to the running charge at both low ( euclidean ) and high momentum , with the right sort of two - gluon threshhold , is : @xmath135 this quasi - conformal coupling runs very slowly at @xmath136 .",
    "because higher - order terms are neglected this expression can not be more than perhaps 10% accurate . in the ultraviolet region a wide range of values of @xmath122 does not change the coupling very much , but in the infrared regime dimensional transmutation has taken place , with the zero - momentum coupling determined by the ratio @xmath137 .",
    "the reader can verify that the choice @xmath138gev , @xmath139 gev is within 10% of a recent evaluation from data @xcite of the strong coupling at the masses of the @xmath140 and @xmath59 , and ( for three light flavors ) gives @xmath141 .",

    "[ fig1 - 4](h ) .",
    "a pinch can change part of a vertex graph to a propagator graph , resulting in new terms that must be added to the conventional fermion propagator .",
    "since the whole s - matrix element is gauge - invariant , it turns out that the new fermion propagator is gauge - invariant ; gauge - dependent terms in the original feynman graphs are cancelled by these other pinch terms .",
    "it is already known @xcite that this procedure yields , in an @xmath201 gauge , a gauge - invariant gluon propagator of the type : @xmath202 where @xmath203 is completely gauge - invariant ( independent of @xmath204 ) and the @xmath204 term receives no radiative corrections ( other than wave - function renormalization ) .",
    "not only do the longitudinal terms @xmath205 cancel out of the s - matrix , they also cancel out of the fermion pinch - technique propagator .",

    "the essential non - perturbative phenomenon is a gluon mass , and i use @xmath206 .    as is well - known @xcite , the pinch technique leads to schwinger - dyson equations identical to those of the background - field method in the feynman gauge ( @xmath207 ) .",
    "however , one can formulate the pinch technique in any gauge @xcite , in the sense that ghost - free ward identities and certain other structural elements of schwinger - dyson equations important for the pinch technique in the feynman gauge still hold .",
    "i will , in pilaftsis @xcite sense of the pinch technique , use landau gauge as all other workers do , because ultraviolet corrections to the vertex are unimportant to one loop in this gauge . because the wasd identity relating the vertex to the fermion propagator has no ghost terms , the same is true ( as in qed ) for the coefficient @xmath100 of @xmath208 in the fermion propagator [ see eq .",

    "the gauge - technique solution for a pinch - technique form factor is an infrared - valid approximation to the form factor that is asymptotically exact as the gluon momentum vanishes , and its ultraviolet inaccuracies can be compensated for @xcite , although i will not attempt that here . because its ward identity is ghost - free , just as in qed , all necessary formulas can be read off with straightforward modifications from the qed work in @xcite .",
    "one pinch technique / gauge technique improper form factor is ( omitting irrelevant group factors and indices ) : @xmath210\\ ] ] and obeys the qed - like ward identity @xmath211 eq .",
    "( [ imp ] ) is not a unique choice for the form factor , but it has the advantage of being an identity for a free massive theory , with @xmath212 and @xmath213 .",

    "( [ imp ] ) only by terms that vanish with at least one more power of @xmath214 at small values of @xmath214 .",
    "the schwinger - dyson ( sd ) equation is : @xmath215 and with the gauge - technique form factor it is _ linear _ in the fermion propagator . in the pinch technique",

    "( [ imp ] ) is identically equal to that of a free massive field theory and because the running fermion mass is not running very fast in the infrared , the resulting pinch - technique equation at small momentum ( including small integration momentum @xmath173 ) is really the same as i started with in eq .",
    "( [ jbw ] ) , except that for small momenta i ignore the running of masses and the coupling .",
    "it is plausible that a nearly - correct modification of the infrared pinch - technique equation that accounts for ultraviolet effects is simply to let the masses and coupling run ",
    "cases i have already reviewed or analyzed . actually , it is somewhat more complicated than this , but the final analysis is much too elaborate to discuss here .",
    "the gauge technique incorporates infrared - important vertex corrections and the pinch technique yields a unique gauge - invariant gap equation in an arbitrary gauge for the underlying feynman graphs . at the present rather simple level of approximation to the pinch technique / gauge technique gap equation , the deep - infrared gap equation , with plausible ultraviolet corrections ,",
    "is the same as found by many others over decades by ignoring vertex corrections and working in the landau gauge ( of course , self - consistent at one - loop level ) .",
    "the full finite - temperature ( @xmath218 ) gap equation , especially for the pinch technique , has a number of complications that i have not dealt with as of this writing , but will save for a more detailed work .",
    "these include separating the gluon propagator into space - space , space - time , and time - time components , which are no longer related by lorentz invariance and which have two mass scales , the magnetic and electric ( debye ) .",
    "this complicates the application of pinch - technique cancellation mechanisms @xcite .",
    "i will only present here the crudest initial attempts at understanding finite - temperature csb with massive - gluon exchange , using what i call the superconductor approximation , because it is in the same spirit as used in the original bcs paper on superconductivity .",
    "it amounts to saying that the gluon propagator is relatively unchanged by temperature effects as long as the temperature is not too large compared to the phase - transition temperature @xmath219 mev .",
    "the reason is that the gluon already has a large @xmath220 mass of some 600 mev , which is not changed drastically by thermal effects at @xmath221 .",
    "however , the fermion mass steadily decreases from its @xmath220 value , eventually vanishing at the csb phase transition .",
    "the difference between fermionic and gluonic dynamical mass generation at finite @xmath218 is that the effective coupling strength for fermions is decreased as @xmath218 increases , by a factor something like @xmath222 where @xmath223 and @xmath224 is a characteristic energy scale ; ultimately , the fermionic mass has to vanish as the coupling diminishes .",
    "but the gluonic mass is increased by a factor roughly @xmath225 ( so the mass grows like @xmath218 at large @xmath218 ) .    in the superconductor approximation",
    "i convert the original zero - temperature gap equation , eq .",
    "( [ jbw ] ) , to finite temperature by the usual replacement of the integral over the ( euclidean ) time momentum @xmath226 by a discrete frequency sum : @xmath227.\\ ] ] as mentioned above it is not quite correct simply to make this substitution in an equation such as ( [ jbw ] ) where the vector - propagator kinematics have been worked out at zero temperature .",
    "a further approximation is to average certain momentum - dependent quantities that vary fairly slowly by averages , which allows us to make contact with an already - studied zero-@xmath218 equation , eq .",
    "( [ jbwir ] ) .",
    "the resulting gap equation is then eq .  ( [ jbwir ] ) with the modified zero - momentum but finite-@xmath218 coupling : @xmath228 with the finite-@xmath218 coupling determined from the zero - momentum form of eq .",
    "( [ corn82 ] ) by using a plausible form for the temperature dependence of the finite-@xmath218 gluon mass : @xmath229\\}^{-1};\\;\\;m(t)= m(t=0)\\coth ( \\frac{\\beta \\omega_g}{2})\\ ] ] where i choose for the average gluon frequency @xmath230 so as to give a simple but fairly accurate high-@xmath218 limit ( _ cf _ the value used in connection with the fse of @xmath231 , with @xmath232 ) .",
    "the fermion frequency @xmath233 is of the form : @xmath234    at the level of the simple approximations used here , it is not possible to predict with any accuracy the actual ratio of the temperature @xmath235 , at which adjoint chiral symmetry breaking is restored , to the usual deconfinement transition temperature @xmath236 .",
    "however , after some not very interesting numerics involving plausible ranges of unknown and approximated quantities , and using the superconductor approximation given here , it appears possible that @xmath237 . if this possibility survives more detailed numerics then adjoint chiral symmetry breaking survives deconfinement , as the lattice simulations show .",
    "of course , there is much more to learn about qcd in general from adjoint csb at finite temperature beyond our interests here , as the literature shows @xcite .",
    "i hope to take up these questions in more detail later .",
    "i use the fse to estimate , using @xmath7 dynamical mass calculations , the usual @xmath5 strong coupling at zero momentum : @xmath13 ( for three light flavors ) , a value in accord with other estimates using the pinch - technique schwinger - dyson equations .",
    "this is somewhat smaller than phenomenological estimates of around 0.75 .",
    "i then consider modern versions of the fermion gap equation both for quarks and for adjoint fermions in qcd  made modern by adding dynamical gluon mass effects and by consideration of the gauge - invariant pinch techniqe / gap technique gap equation .",
    "the final results , although not impressively accurate , suggest that confinement is essential to break csb for quarks , but that standard fermion gap physics can explain csb for adjoint fermions , for some ( uncalculated ) range of temperatures , possibly reaching above the deconfinement temperature .",
    "these results are consistent with present - day lattice simulations .",
