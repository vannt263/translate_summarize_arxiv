    "the glass transition is a ubiquitous but still mysterious phenomenon in condensed matter physics @xcite . indeed",

    "examples include fragile molecular glasses , polymers , colloids or , more relevant here , disordered magnetic alloys named spin glasses  @xcite .",
    "the dynamic slowing down is not accompanied by dramatic changes in structural or thermodynamic properties . in spite of this , quite general arguments suggest that the sluggish dynamics must be correlated with an increasing length scale  @xcite .",
    "this putative length scale can be fairly difficult to identify ( a significant amount of research has been devoted to this problem , see , e.g. ,  @xcite )",
    ".    in this context , spin glasses are unique for a number of reasons . to start with",
    ", they provide the only example of a material for which it is widely accepted that the sluggish dynamics is due to a thermodynamic phase transition at a critical temperature @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "this phase transition is continuous , and the time - reversal symmetry of the system is spontaneously broken at @xmath3 .",
    "spin glasses are also remarkable because special tools are available for their investigation . on the experimental side ,",
    "time - dependent magnetic fields are a very flexible tool to probe their dynamic response , which can be very accurately measured with a squid ( for instance , see  @xcite ) .",
    "for very low applied magnetic fields , one can measure _ glassy _ magnetic domains of a diameter up to @xmath4 lattice spacings  @xcite , much larger than any length scale identified for structural glasses  @xcite . on the theoretical side ,",
    "spin glasses are simple to model , which greatly eases numerical simulation .",
    "in fact , special - purpose computers have been built for the simulation of spin glasses  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the janus computer  @xcite has allowed us to simulate the non - equilibrium dynamics from picoseconds to a tenth of a second  @xcite , which has resulted in detailed connections between non - equilibrium dynamics at finite times and equilibrium physics in finite systems @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "now , mean field provides compelling motivation to investigate spin glasses in an externally applied magnetic field .",
    "although a magnetic field explicitly breaks time - reversal symmetry , it has been shown that a phase transition should still occur when cooling the mean - field spin glass in an external field  @xcite , which leads us to expect a sophisticated and still largely unexplored behavior for short - range spin glasses . in this respect ,",
    "we remark as well an intriguing suggestion by moore , drossel and fullerton .",
    "these authors speculate that the spin glass in a field sets the universality class for the structural - glass transition @xcite ( the statement is supposed to hold in @xmath5 spatial dimensions ; spatial dimensionality _ is _ crucial ) .",
    "however , two major problems hamper further progress : ( i ) the mean - field theory , which is expected to be accurate above the upper critical dimension @xmath6 , predicts a rather different behavior for spin and structural glasses ; ( ii ) the behavior of spin glasses in a field in @xmath5 is the matter of a lively controversy .",
    "we now address each issue separately .",
    "regarding the first problem , we note that the standard mean - field model for structural glasses is the @xmath7-spin glass model , with @xmath7-body interactions @xcite ( for odd @xmath7 , the time - reversal symmetry is explicitly broken ) . in the mean - field approximation",
    ", the odd-@xmath7 models display a dynamic phase transition  _ in their paramagnetic phase .",
    "_ reaching thermal equilibrium becomes impossible in the temperature range @xmath8 .",
    "the dynamic transition at @xmath9 is identical to the ideal mode coupling transition of supercooled liquids  @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamic phase transition at @xmath10 is analogous to the ideal kauzmann thermodynamic glass transition  @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamic transition is very peculiar : although it is of the second order ( in the ehrenfest sense ) , the spin - glass order parameter jumps discontinuously at @xmath11 from zero to a non - vanishing value . on the other hand , for spin glasses in a field ,",
    "mean - field theory predicts a single transition ( i.e. , @xmath12 ) and an order parameter that behaves continuously as a function of temperature .",
    "however , mean - field theory is accurate only in high - enough spatial dimensions , @xmath6 , hence it is legitimate to wonder about our three - dimensional world .",
    "in fact , the ideal mode coupling transition is known to be only a crossover for supercooled liquids .",
    "the power - law divergences predicted by mode coupling theory hold when the equilibration time lies in the range @xmath13 .",
    "fitting to those power - laws , one obtains a mode coupling temperature @xmath14 .",
    "however , @xmath15 is finite at @xmath14 ( typically @xmath14 is 10% larger than the glass temperature @xmath9 where @xmath16 seconds ) . a theory for a thermodynamic glass transition at @xmath17 has been put forward  @xcite , but it has still not been validated ( however , see  @xcite ) .    regarding now our second problem , we recall that whether spin glasses in a magnetic field undergo a phase transition has been a long - debated and still open question .",
    "there are mainly two conflicting theories .",
    "the above mentioned mean - field picture is the replica symmetry breaking ( rsb ) theory  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the droplet theory  @xcite predicts that the system s behavior is akin to that of a disguised ferromagnet ( i.e. , no phase transition in a field ) .",
    "recent exponents of this controversy are @xcite .",
    "we elaborate on concrete predictions by both theories in section  [ sec : droplets_vs_rsb ] . for now , we note that recent numerical simulations in @xmath5 did not find the thermodynamic transition predicted by mean - field  @xcite .",
    "experimental studies have been conducted as well , with conflicting conclusions  @xcite . up to now , a transition has been found only numerically , in four dimensions ( note that @xmath18 )  @xcite .",
    "a different numerical approach has consisted in the study of levy graphs : one - dimensional systems where the interaction decays with distance as a power - law @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that the critical behavior in @xmath20 spatial dimensions can be matched with that of a levy graph with an appropriate choice of the decay exponent @xmath21 .",
    "the spin - glass transition has been investigated in this way , both with and without an externally applied magnetic field .",
    "the latest result within this approach suggests that the de almeida - thouless line is present in four spatial dimensions , but not in three dimensions  @xcite .",
    "however , it has been pointed out that the matching between the decay exponent @xmath21 and the spatial dimension @xmath20 changes when a magnetic field is applied  @xcite , a possibility not considered in @xcite .",
    "our scope here is to explore the dynamical behavior of @xmath5 spin glasses in a field using the janus computer .",
    "we shall study lattices of size @xmath22 , where we expect finite - size effects to be negligible @xcite .",
    "our time scales will range from 1 picosecond ( i.e. , one monte carlo full lattice sweep  @xcite ) to @xmath0 seconds .",
    "hence , if the analogy with structural glasses holds , we should be able to identify the mode coupling crossover .",
    "our study will be eased by the rather deep theoretical knowledge of the relevant correlation functions @xcite .",
    "hence , we shall be able to correlate the equilibration time @xmath15 with the correlation length @xmath23 .",
    "the layout of the remaining part of this work is as follows . in section  [ sec : modeland_observables ] we describe the model and our observables and we give an overview of the different theoretical pictures that have been put forward to explain the dynamics of the spin glass in a field .",
    "we pay particular attention to the specific predictions for the observables that we are going to study ( sections  [ sec : droplets_vs_rsb ] and section  [ sec : mct - and - beyond ] ) . in section  [ sec : protocols_and_taus ] we describe the different protocols that we have considered ( simulating a direct quench and annealings with different temperature variation rates ) .",
    "next , in section  [ sec : taus ] , we turn our attention to the crucial and delicate issue of identifying intrinsic time scales in the dynamics .    once this foundation has been laid , we delve into the physical analysis and interpretation of our results .",
    "first , we consider the high - temperature regime , where our simulations reach equilibrium , in section  [ sec : equilibrium ] .",
    "we thus try to approach the critical region from above .",
    "afterwards , in section  [ sec : non - equilibrium ] , we study the low - temperature regime , where the relaxation times are much longer than our simulations ( perhaps infinite ) .",
    "we consider two complementary approaches : in section  [ sec : non - equilibrium - power - law ] we try the simplest ansatz for a low - temperature behavior compatible with a rsb spin - glass transition , while in section  [ sec : non - equilibrium - linear - log ] we assume from the outset that no transition occurs .",
    "the spatial correlation of the system is studied in section  [ sec : xi ] , where we carry out a direct analysis of the correlation length .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : conclusions ] we present our conclusions , evaluating the different physical scenarios on the light of our data .",
    "we also include two appendices : one describing some details of our implementation and the other presenting a more detailed look at the correlation functions .",
    "in section  [ sec : model ] we describe the model that we have simulated .",
    "the observables that we consider are defined in section  [ sec : observables ] . at that point",
    ", we will be ready to describe the different predictions of the droplet and rsb theories in section  [ sec : droplets_vs_rsb ] .",
    "however , it has been recently suggested that spin - glass on a field behave just as supercooled liquids @xcite .",
    "the current theoretical predictions for supercooled liquids do not quite match neither the droplet nor the rsb theories for spin glasses on a field .",
    "hence , we briefly recall those predictions in section  [ sec : mct - and - beyond ] .",
    "we have studied a three - dimensional cubic lattice system with volume @xmath24 ( @xmath25 is the linear size ) and periodic boundary conditions . on every node of the lattice",
    "there is an ising spin @xmath26 and nearest neighbors are joined by couplings @xmath27 .",
    "the spins are dynamic variables , while the couplings @xmath27 are fixed during the simulation ( this is the so - called quenched disorder @xcite ) .",
    "the couplings are independent random variables : @xmath28 with @xmath29 probability .",
    "we also include a local magnetic field @xmath30 on every node . the magnetic field is gaussianly distributed with zero mean and variance @xmath31 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model is @xmath32 where @xmath33 means sum over nearest neighbors . a given realization of couplings , @xmath27 , and an external field , @xmath30 , defines a _ sample_. all of our results will be averaged over many samples .",
    "it is important to realize that both the hamiltonian   and the probability distribution functions ( pdf ) for the couplings and the magnetic field are invariant under a gauge symmetry .",
    "let be @xmath34 be arbitrary site - dependent signs .",
    "the gauge symmetry is @xmath35 the observables defined in section  [ sec : observables ] must be invariant under this symmetry . as explained in the literature ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , one forms gauge - invariant observables by considering real replicas , namely copies of the system that evolve independently under the same coupling constants and magnetic fields .",
    "in particular , we consider four replicas per sample .",
    "the model   has been simulated on the janus special - purpose computer @xcite .",
    "janus limited memory does not allow us to study one independent , real - valued magnetic field per site @xmath30 .",
    "we circumvented the problem using gauss - hermite integration @xcite .",
    "details of our implementation , as well as comparison with pc simulations for real - valued @xmath30 , can be found in appendix  [ app1 ] .    from the theoretical point of view",
    ", two main and contradictory theoretical predictions for the finite - dimensional model in an external magnetic field can be found in the literature : the droplet theory ( dt ) and the replica symmetry breaking theory ( rsb ) .    in the droplet framework",
    ", the @xmath36 spin - glass phase is destroyed by any magnetic field , however small : there is only a paramagnetic phase  @xcite .    instead , in the rsb construction",
    ", the spin - glass phase remains in the presence of small magnetic fields .",
    "the boundary of this spin - glass phase with the paramagnetic phase is called the de almeida - thouless ( dat ) line  @xcite .",
    "finally , we can summarize briefly the main analytical results obtained up to date .",
    "renormalization group ( rg ) studies , assuming that the longitudinal and anomalous sectors are degenerate ( see below for more details ) have failed to find a fixed point  @xcite .",
    "the upper critical dimension in this approach turns out to be just six as in absence of a magnetic field ( however , some observables change their mean - field behavior just at and below eight dimensions due to the appearance of dangerous irrelevant variables in the rg  @xcite )",
    ".    the lack of stable fixed points below six dimensions could be due to the absence of a phase transition , the presence of a first - order phase transition or the limitations of the perturbative approach used ( e.g. , there might be a stable fixed point for higher orders of the perturbative expansion ) .",
    "these computations  @xcite have been performed enforcing that the number of replicas , @xmath37 , of the effective field theory be zero , which implies the above cited degeneration between the anomalous and longitudinal sectors of the theory .",
    "however , @xcite started using the most general hamiltonian compatible with the symmetries of a replica symmetric phase and relaxed the @xmath38 condition , so the longitudinal and anomalous sectors are no longer degenerate . in this work stable fixed points",
    "were found below six dimensions .",
    "in addition , in a more recent work @xcite , the at line was computed in dimensions slightly below the upper critical dimension ( @xmath39 ) ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "notice that in all these analytical studies the phase transition ( if it exists ) is approached from the paramagnetic phase .",
    "hence , the only information about the structure of a tentative spin - glass phase in finite dimensions is just that of mean field .",
    "we are going to consider the temporal evolution of different physical quantities in simulation protocols with temperature variation . to this end",
    ", we define @xmath40 as the total time elapsed during the simulation ( measured in monte carlo sweeps , mcs , i.e. , updates of the whole lattice ) and the waiting time @xmath41 as the total time elapsed since the last change of temperature .",
    "when this distinction is not important , we use @xmath42 as a generic time variable .",
    "first , a couple of useful definitions of local quantities . on every node @xmath43 of the lattice we have the local overlap : @xmath44 where the superscripts are the replica indices .",
    "the total overlap is written as @xmath45 where @xmath46 means sample average ( over the @xmath47 s and @xmath48 s ) , and @xmath24 is the total number of spins in the lattice .",
    "in addition , we have focused in this work on the magnetic energy defined as @xmath49 and @xmath50 we note that if the magnetic field is gaussian distributed , the following identity is fulfilled in _ thermal equilibrium _ : @xmath51 to derive eq .",
    "integrate by parts the term @xmath52 that appears on the disorder average for @xmath53 , and recall the _ equilibrium",
    "_ fluctuation - dissipation relation @xmath54 .    both @xmath55 and @xmath56",
    "disregard the spatial dependence . to address this issue",
    ", we should consider correlation functions . in a magnetic field ,",
    "one may consider three different correlators @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 at equal time .",
    "the three of them can be computed with four replicas : @xmath60 to gain statistics , we average over all the replica - index permutations that yield the same expectation values in the above equations .    now , because of the magnetic field , none of the correlators @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 tend to zero for large @xmath61 , hence one needs to define _ connected _ correlators .",
    "this problem was faced long ago , and the answer is in the three basic propagator of the replicated field theory namely the longitudinal ( @xmath62 ) , anomalous ( @xmath63 ) and replicon ( @xmath64 ) ( see @xcite ) : @xmath65 where @xmath37 is the number of replicas of the effective replica field theory ( @xmath37 should not be confused with the number of _ real replicas _ that we hold fixed to four ) .",
    "quenched disorder is recovered from replica field theory in the limit @xmath66 . in this limit ,",
    "( [ eq : gr ] ,  [ eq : gl ] ,  [ eq : ga ] ) yield the replicon @xmath67 while @xmath63 and @xmath62 coalesce in the limit to a single propagator : @xmath68 ( strictly speaking , replica field theory applies only to equilibrium ; the reader will forgive us for borrowing the natural equilibrium definitions for our dynamic computation at finite @xmath42 ) .",
    "having in our hands two correlation functions ( replicon and longitudinal / anomalous ) , it is natural to compute the associated susceptibilities @xmath69 where @xmath70 stands for any of the correlators introduced in this section .    at finite @xmath41",
    ", correlations surely are sizeable only within some characteristic correlation length @xmath71 .",
    "if one expects a typical scaling form for such correlators @xmath72 where @xmath73 is some long - distance cutoff function , it is natural to extract the correlation length from integral estimators  @xcite @xmath74 where @xmath75 the @xmath76 in eq .   is a shorthand for @xmath77 and permutations .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio is increased if one imposes a long - distance cutoff in eq .  .",
    "in particular , we stop integrating when the relative error in @xmath78 grows larger than @xmath79 ( we can estimate the effect of the tail with an exponential extrapolation , although this is a very minor effect , see @xcite and appendix  [ app_grgl : truncacion ] ) .",
    "notice that a similar method can be used to obtain estimators for the susceptibility .",
    "assuming isotropy ( see @xcite ) we can write eq .   as @xmath80 which can be computed with the long - distance cutoff .",
    "finally , let us mention that quantities such as @xmath78 , due to the slow temporal evolution and the strong sample - to - sample fluctuations , turn out to be very rugged functions of @xmath41 .",
    "this is particularly bad for the computation of @xmath81 , since it can have an unpredictable effect on the cutoff . in order to avoid this problem",
    ", we perform a temporal binning , averaging @xmath78 in blocks of @xmath82 consecutive times and considering it as a function of the geometrical mean of the times in each block .",
    "this smoothing procedure yields a significant error reduction .",
    "we summarize here the major differences among the predictions from the droplet and rsb theories with an emphasis on the quantities defined in section  [ sec : observables ] .",
    "we discuss as well the different predictions for the characteristic time scale for equilibration , @xmath15 ( see section  [ sec : taus ] ) .",
    "as we shall see , the predictions of the droplet theory are more detailed , hence let us start there .",
    "according to the droplet theory , there is no phase transition in a field .",
    "this means that the long - time and large - system limits , @xmath83 and @xmath84 , can be taken in any order . in this work ,",
    "we will always take _ first _ the limit of large @xmath25 ( because @xmath85 in our simulations , see @xcite ) .",
    "thus , it is a consequence of the droplet picture that eq",
    ".   should always hold for large lattices and then large times .    the physics at low temperatures",
    "is predicted to be ruled by a fixed point at @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "temperature is an irrelevant scaling field , while the magnetic field is relevant .",
    "the scaling dimensions would be @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the droplet stiffness exponent and @xmath20 is the space dimension ( @xmath5 in this work ) .",
    "therefore , the correlation length is predicted to remain finite for all positive temperatures , even in the limit @xmath83 .",
    "a scaling law follows from eqs .",

    "the droplet prediction is that it is of the activated type , with a typical barrier of order @xmath92 [ @xmath93 is a second droplet exponent which should satisfy @xmath94  @xcite ] .",

    "would predict an apparent super - arrhenius behavior .",
    "now , in order to make some use of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : droplets - for - xi],[eq : droplets - dynamics ] ) , it is mandatory to have an estimate for the exponents @xmath88 and @xmath93 .",

    "the comparison of periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions yields @xmath100 @xcite , the most recent value being @xmath101 @xcite .",
    "however , excitations of much lower energy , low enough in fact as to suggest @xmath102 , have been identified with fixed boundary conditions @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", one may address the computation of @xmath88 in a rather more direct way , by considering the behavior of the spatial correlation functions .",
    "this approach yields @xmath103 [ the error estimate contains both statistical and systematic effects , see eq .",

    "the rsb theory is based on the solution of a mean - field model ( the sherrington - kirkpatrick model ) .",
    "extending the theory below its upper critical dimension @xmath106 is problematic , as explained in section  [ sec : model ] .",
    "hence , it is not simple to guess which of the properties of the mean - field solution will remain valid in @xmath5 .",
    "maybe the most prominent feature of the mean - field solution is the resilience of the spin - glass transition to an external magnetic field ( at least , this is the property that justifies writing this separate paragraph ) .",
    "the rsb theory expects a divergence of the correlation length at @xmath107 , the locus of the de almeida - thouless line , in the form of a power law : @xmath108 consequently , the relaxation time should diverge at @xmath107 .",
    "it may do so in the form of critical slowing down : @xmath109 which defines the dynamic critical exponent , @xmath110 .",
    "this is consistent with the mean - field analysis of the dynamics @xcite .",

    "probably , the most successful theory for supercooled liquid dynamics is the mode - coupling theory ( mct ) @xcite .",
    "this is a very rich theory , with many predictions .",
    "we shall content ourselves by recalling the results most directly relevant to our discussion .",

    "notice , however , that we are always working with @xmath206 , so this kind of fit is rather dangerous .    at this point , is is only natural to ask whether the droplet theory , see eq .  , describes our data .",
    "the answer is negative , see figure  [ fig : xi - droplets ] .",
    "therefore , none of the available theories provide a satisfactory description of our simulation . of course",
    ", this might be due to the fact that we have not reached the regime where these theories apply ( low enough temperatures , or low enough magnetic fields ) .",
    "however , we should stress that our data span a rather significant range of time scales ( from one picosecond to a hundredth of a second ) .",
    "hence , we dare say that our simulations are of direct experimental relevance . the issue is discussed at length in the conclusions .    a final remark .",
    "one can be tempted to compare eq .  , which works for our equilibrium data , with the analysis in section  [ sec : non - equilibrium - linear - log ] giving @xmath207 ( which is based on an extrapolation to times beyond our simulated timescales ) .",

    "we try ( and fail within the reachable temperature window ) to collapse the data with two different estimates of @xmath88 , see section  [ sec : droplets_vs_rsb ] ]",
    "in this work , we have investigated the approach to equilibrium and the building - up of spin - glass order for the @xmath5 ising spin glass in an external magnetic field . specifically , we have simulated the edwards - anderson model on the janus dedicated computer .",
    "our lattices were always much larger ( @xmath22 ) than the correlation length , @xmath71 .",
    "hence , we think that our results are representative of the thermodynamic limit .",
    "our time scales range from the picosecond to one hundredth of a second .",
    "we are thus approaching the experimental scale .",
    "however , when the temperature was low enough , we have been unable to reach the thermalization time scale , @xmath15 .",
    "we have monitored this effect carefully .",
    "therefore , in this work we are presenting in a controlled way both equilibrium and non - equilibrium data .",
    "our results have been analyzed on the light of the two major theories on the market , the replica - symmetry breaking and the droplet theory .",
    "on the view of recent claims @xcite , we have also analyzed our data as suggested by current theories for relaxation in supercooled liquids .",
    "none of these three approaches was fully satisfying .",
    "the problem with the droplet / rsb theories was in the correlation length : the growth of @xmath23 upon lowering the temperature is too fast to fit the droplet theory and too slow to fit rsb .",
    "we summarize now the strengths and weaknesses of each approach .",
    "we start with the droplet theory , then consider rsb and , finally , the supercooled liquids point of view .    as we show in section  [ sec : xi ] , the dynamics really seems to be of activated type , as predicted by the droplet theory .",
    "however , the scaling law predicted by the theory is not fulfilled by our data .",
    "in fact , see section  [ sec : non - equilibrium - linear - log ] , the dynamics is of super - arrhenius type at least down to temperature @xmath213 ( to be compared with @xmath214 @xcite , the @xmath36 critical temperature ) .",
    "therefore , although the droplet theory might be finally correct at still lower temperature , the corresponding time and length scales would be beyond not only our computational capabilities , but also current experimental possibilities .",
    "the rsb approach resulted in a determination of the de almeida - thouless line , which is consistent , whether one uses equilibrium ( section  [ sec : equilibrium ] ) or non - equilibrium ( [ sec : non - equilibrium - power - law ] ) data .",
    "unfortunately , our _ equilibrium _ estimate of @xmath23 does not seem to diverge at the de almeida - thouless line ( also , the fisher - sompolinsky scaling@xcite is _ not _ verified , as the reader may easily check ) .",
    "there are a number of possible explanations for our failure to find the divergence :    * for all three magnetic fields , we have been able to equilibrate the system only down to @xmath215 .",
    "perhaps the critical growth of @xmath216 starts only closer to the de almeida - thouless line .",
    "* it is by no means guaranteed that we are looking at the right correlation function .",
    "we have shown in section  [ sec : corr - funct ] that some correlators might display sizeable correlations while others do not .",
    "in fact , the quest for sensible correlators is a longstanding problem in the investigation of supercooled liquids @xcite . also in the field of spin glasses it has been suggested that energy and link - overlap correlators deserve more attention @xcite . * as explained in section  [ sec : droplets_vs_rsb ] , it is very possible that the physics in @xmath5 will be ruled by a fixed point at @xmath111 .",
    "if this is the case , activated dynamics is to be expected also in the rsb theory . under these circumstances , the de almeida - thouless line identified in section  [ sec : equilibrium ] and  [ sec : non - equilibrium - power - law ]",
    "might well represent a dynamic glass transition .",
    "in fact , our data for @xmath216 are consistent with a critical divergence _ below _ the de almeida - thouless line .",
    "the divergence could take place in the range @xmath217 for @xmath140 , @xmath218 for @xmath146 and @xmath218 for @xmath166 ( note , however , that these upper bounds are only crude estimations ) .",
    "* finally , as explained above , it is possible that the droplet theory could be correct and no transition takes place for @xmath156 in three spatial dimensions .",
    "however , it is clear that the correlation length grows noticeably in our simulations , which suggests that the lower critical dimension in a field can not be much larger than @xmath5 .",
    "notice as well that the lower critical dimension in a field is well below @xmath219 , since very clear evidence of a second - order phase transition has been obtained in @xmath219 @xcite .",
    "let us finally consider the supercooled liquid approach . at the qualitative level , this is maybe the most successful description .",
    "indeed , we do identify in our data a mode coupling temperature , @xmath220 ( section  [ sec : tau - mct ] ) and a cross - over to activated dynamics ( sects .",
    "[ sec : tau - mct ] and  [ sec : xi_t_tw ] ) .",
    "however , the description remains qualitative since our numerical accuracy does not allow a strict test of basic relations among critical exponents .",
