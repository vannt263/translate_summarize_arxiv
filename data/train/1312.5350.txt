    "we consider bipartite finite dimensional quantum systems , and what state transformations can be achieved given arbitrary quantum operations on each system and classical communication between them .",
    "this class of quantum operations is known as locc .",
    "locc arises in many natural settings .",
    "for example , it is much easier to transmit classical data than quantum data over long distances .",
    "for another example , quantum gates involving multiple registers are much harder to implement , and methods to effect them using entangled states , measurements , and classical feedback hold high promise .",
    "the study of locc also provides insights on the nature of quantum information , leading to discoveries including teleportation @xcite , quantum error correcting codes @xcite , and security proofs for quantum key exchange @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , locc , as an operationally defined class , does not have a succinct mathematical description .",
    "traditionally , one turns to relaxations of locc such as sep or ppt instead of analysing locc operations .",
    "this method has proved fruitful for many problems such as data hiding @xcite and state discrimination @xcite .",
    "yet this approach fails to answer other interesting questions such as whether more rounds of communication , or infinitely many intermediate measurement outcomes can make a difference , or whether there are operations that can be approximated arbitrarily closely with locc but do not belong to locc ( _ i.e. _ , whether locc is equal to its topological closure @xmath1 or not ) .",
    "recent investigation of the locc class itself has resolved these questions ; for example , more communication rounds can be helpful @xcite and @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "a common technique to prove that a certain task can not be accomplished perfectly by a finite locc protocol is to start by assuming the contrary .",
    "then the properties of steps taken in any perfect implementation of the task are shown to be incompatible with the structure of an locc protocol .",
    "however , it could still be possible to accomplish the task with vanishing error using locc protocols . excluding the possibility of approaching perfect implementation is much harder and few results",
    "have been established @xcite .    in this paper , we focus on two problems concerning @xmath1 .",
    "our first problem is , are there natural classes of measurements in locc that are closed ?",
    "in other words , are there sets of measurements such that it does not help to allow vanishing error and more and more rounds of communication ? our second problem concerns the possibility of discriminating sets of orthogonal product states called upbs ( for _ unextendible product bases _ though these states are not bases ) in @xmath1 .",
    "we first summarize prior works in the two problems of interest .",
    "the first example of a task for which @xmath1 gives no advantage over finite locc concerns perfect discrimination of the so - called domino states @xcite .",
    "they can not be discriminated by either set . over a decade",
    "later a generalization was reached by establishing that the set of full basis measurements implementable by locc is closed @xcite . for our second question",

    "we make partial progress in the two problems posed above .",
    "first , we show that the set of locc implementable projective measurements with tensor product operators is closed ( see ) .",
    "second , we prove that @xmath1 can not be used to perfectly discriminate states from a upb in @xmath3 ( see ) . both results are applications of a necessary condition from @xcite .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in",

    "we note as a side remark that , using theorems 2 and 3 in @xcite , any bipartite upb with @xmath179 states can be perfectly discriminated by a separable measurement .",
    "thus provides another example of the phenomenon _ nonlocality without entanglement _ , in which a set of unentangled states can not be discriminated by asymptotic locc , but can be discriminated by separable operations .",
    "to ease the analysis of asymptotic locc we have introduced two scenarios in which no new task can be accomplished ( information theoretically ) collapse . by allowing vanishing error .",
    "the first scenario is the implementation of projective measurements with tensor product operators .",
    "the second is the discrimination of the states from an unextendible product basis in @xmath251 . on the first subject ,",
    "an obvious next step is to investigate whether asymptotic locc can be helpful for implementing any projective or general measurement .",
    "a second question is whether asymptotic locc can help for perfect state discrimination . on the second subject ,",
    "it is likely that a general upb can not be discriminated by asymptotic locc .",
    "it will be nice to obtain a rigorous proof .",
