    "estimation of power spectral density ( spectrum ) of a continuous time , mean square continuous , stationary stochastic process is a classical problem . generally the estimation is based on finitely many samples of the process .",
    "it is well known that if the spectrum is compactly supported ( bandlimited ) , then it can be estimated from uniformly spaced samples , provided the sampling is done at the nyquist rate or faster ( kay , 1999 ) . for sampled non - bandlimited processes , or bandlimited processes sampled at sub - nyquist rate ,",
    "the problem of aliasing leads to biased estimation .",
    "for this reason , it is sometimes argued that a non - bandlimited spectrum can never be estimated consistently from uniformly spaced samples at any fixed sampling rate ( shapiro and silverman , 1960 ; masry , 1978 ) .",
    "consequently , some researchers have turned to non - uniform sampling schemes such as stochastic sampling and periodic non - uniform sampling .",
    "masry ( 1978 ) proved the consistency of some spectrum estimators based on stochastic sampling schemes , under appropriate conditions that allow the underlying spectrum to be non - bandlimited .",
    "for bandlimited processes , it has been shown that periodic non - uniform sampling at sub - nyquist average rate can lead to consistent spectrum estimation ( marvasti , 2001 ) .",
    "it is important to note that the argument of inconsistency of spectrum estimators computed from uniformly spaced samples is based on the assumption that the sampling rate remains fixed even as the sample size goes to infinity .",
    "however , when one has the resources to increase the sample size indefinitely , one would like to use some of those resources to sample faster , rather than being constrained by a fixed sampling rate .",
    "in fact , it has been shown ( srivastava and sengupta , 2010 ) that if this constraint is removed , and the sampling rate is allowed to increase suitably as the sample size goes to infinity , then the smoothed periodogram can be a consistent estimator of a non - bandlimited spectral density .",
    "it should be noted that uniform sampling is generally far easier to implement than non - uniform sampling .",
    "for this reason , the fact of consistency of a spectrum estimator computed from uniformly spaced samples of a non - bandlimited process is noteworthy .",
    "this fact also gives rise to further questions about the estimator , such as its convergence in distribution , and construction of asymptotic confidence intervals for the spectrum , based on the estimator .",
    "these questions have so far not been addressed through asymptotic calculations that allow the sampling rate to go to infinity .",
    "this is what we propose to do in this paper .",
    "the asymptotic approach chosen here ( referred to as ` shrinking asymptotics ' by fuentes , 2002 ) was also adopted by other authors ( e.g. , constantine and hall , 1994 ; hall et al . , 1994 ;",
    "lahiri , 1999 ) , although the asymptotic distribution of the smoothed periodogram has not been studied previously .",
    "this approach is different from the ` fixed - domain asymptotics ' or ` infill asymptotics ' approach ( chen et al . , 2000 ;",
    "stein , 1995 ; zhang and zimmerman , 2005 ; lim and stein , 2008 ) which , in the present case , would have required that the time - span of the original continuous - time data ( before sampling ) remains fixed as the sampling rate goes to infinity .",

    "we establish the consistency of the spectrum estimator ( [ est ] ) for non - bandlimited processes , which is a generalization of a result of srivastava and sengupta ( 2010 ) to the case of multivariate time series .",

    "in order to establish the consistency of the estimator @xmath17 given in ( [ est ] ) , we make a few assumptions on the process @xmath18 , the kernel @xmath12 and the sequences @xmath13 and @xmath14 .    the function @xmath19 , defined over the real line as @xmath20 .",
