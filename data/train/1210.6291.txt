    "the compact radio source 3c345 ( j1642 + 3948 ) is a 16th magnitude quasar at a redshift of @xmath7 ( 6.5 kpc / arcsecond in concordance cosmology , @xmath8 ) .",
    "this is one of the best studied quasars at a wide range of wavelengths and angular resolutions because it is nearby and bright .",
    "the source is variable in x - ray , optical , and radio bands on time scales ranging from minutes to months , and it is highly polarized at optical and radio wavelengths ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the radio structure was studied by @xcite on angular scales from @xmath9 through @xmath10 ( 2 to 200  kpc ) using multi - array vla data at 5  ghz .",
    "they were able to trace the radio source from the core north - west along the jet , which then turns northward and eventually loops around to the east and then to the south ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite concluded that this highly distorted structure was the result of projection , and that 3c345 was a fanaroff - riley type  ii radio source @xcite seen nearly end - on .",
    "3c345 has been observed extensively by very long baseline interferometry , and is superluminal with inferred lorentz factor @xmath11 up to at least 20 @xcite .",
    "thus it is assumed that the jet near the core is aligned within an angle @xmath12 of the line of sight , consistent with the interpretation of the large - scale structure . since at larger distances the jet is strongly curving , the inclination of the jet within about @xmath13-@xmath14 of the core ",
    "the region studied below  is not well determined .",
    "this uncertainty makes it impossible to de - project the jet with complete confidence ; however , it seems certain that bends and opening angles are exaggerated by projection .    in this paper",
    "we use high - resolution , high dynamic range vla images at 5 and 8  ghz to study the structure and linear polarization of 3c345 .",
    "the observations and data reduction are described in  [ s : obs ] , the properties of the jet described in  [ s : jets ] , we discuss the results in  [ s : discussion ] , and our conclusions are presented in  [ s : conclude ] .",
    "interferometer data from 1989 january 78 ( epoch 1989.02 ) were obtained from the vla data archive ( experiment code ar196 ) .",
    "the array was in the a configuration with 27 working antennas .",
    "the frequencies used were 4.86  ghz ( c  band , @xmath15 ) and 8.44  ghz ( x  band , @xmath16 ) , with a bandwidth of 50  mhz for each of the two if systems at each band .",
    "the data were edited and calibrated in aips @xcite . the nearby source 1635",
    "+ 381 was used for phase calibration , and the primary flux calibrator 3c286 was used for amplitude calibration . to obtain the maximum dynamic range in the images a baseline - dependent calibration was executed with the task blcal .",
    "the baseline calibration tables were determined from the data for 3c286 and its aips clean component models .",
    "the tables were then attached to the data files of 3c345 for their respective frequency bands .",
    "it was found that making a baseline correction using an image of the bright source 3c84 made from data collected about 12 hours earlier produced essentially the same results at 5  ghz , but was superior at 8  ghz .",
    "hence this correction was used at the higher frequency .",
    "baseline - corrected images had signal - to - noise about a factor of two better than those made without baseline correction , and were judged to have higher image fidelity .",
    "polarization calibration was done with the phase calibrator using the task pcal .",
    "the position angle of linear polarization on the sky was set by 3c286 .",
    "we estimate that the absolute position angle calibration is good to within @xmath17 at 5  ghz and @xmath18 at 8  ghz .",
    "images were made using aips and the caltech difference imaging package difmap @xcite as follows . using difmap , at each step in the selfcal ",
    "clean cycle , a tight clean box was placed around the brightest remaining flux and purely positive clean components were removed until the process ended .",
    "then a 15  minute phase - only selfcal was done , and the boxing - cleaning - selfcal resumed .",
    "the @xmath19-@xmath20 weighting was changed and @xmath19-@xmath20 tapers applied as required to recover more flux . only when this process terminated was an amplitude selfcal used , with a 60  minute timescale .",
    "phase - only selfcals were resumed until the process terminated .",
    "finally , the self - calibrated visibilities were moved into aips and the final images made with the task imagr using the restoring beams listed in table  [ tab : maps ] . to create images that could be compared at the two frequencies , uniform weighting ( robust @xmath21 )",
    "was used for 5  ghz and natural weighting ( robust @xmath22 ) for 8  ghz , a @xmath19-@xmath20 taper with parameters ( 850 , 800 ) k@xmath23 was used at both frequencies , and identical circular restoring beams of full - width at half - maximum @xmath24 were applied . to study the divergence of the jet , full - resolution images were made from the data at 8  ghz ; it was judged that `` optimum weighting '' ( robust parameter 0 ) and a clean beam of @xmath25 gave the best compromise between resolution and signal - to - noise . to simplify the analysis and image display , most of the images were rotated by @xmath26 in position angle .    in table",
    "[ tab : maps ] we give the parameters of the images and the figures .",
    "the root - mean - square ( rms ) noise reported is from a @xmath27 box centered @xmath28 southeast of the core , and is reasonably representative of the uncertainties in the images ( see below ) .",
    "a @xmath29-wide field of 3c345 at 5  ghz at its correct orientation on the sky is shown in figure  [ fig : cfullbl ] .",
    "the detailed total intensity structures at 5 and 8  ghz are shown in figure  [ fig : cxibl ] . at the epoch of observation ( 1989.02 ) ,",
    "the core of 3c345 was essentially unresolved , and had flux densities of 8.1 and 7.1  jy at 5 and 8  ghz , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig : highres2 ] shows a full - resolution image of 3c345 at 8  ghz .    ) .",
    "the image is the mean of those made by two of the authors , and has been rotated by @xmath26 in position angle .",
    "see table  [ tab : maps ] for image data and figure details.[fig : highres2 ] ]    since the jet is weak compared to the core , we examined the reliability of the images by comparing those made independently from the same data by two of the authors ( dhr & vvm ) .",
    "the rms difference between the pairs of images was about 0.5  mjy / beam at each frequency , consistent the rms noise in the images .",
    "ridge - line intensities at 5 and 8  ghz are compared in figure  [ fig : comparecpk ] , and are consistent with an rms difference of @xmath30  mjy / beam .",
    "this gives an idea of the dependence of the intensity levels in this faint jet on the personal equation in the hybrid imaging technique .",
    "this of course does not mean that the absolute intensity levels are reliable at that level because any calibration uncertainties cancel in this comparison .",
    "the jet consists of a westward straight section we will refer to directions on the sky as they appear in the rotated images ; note that the true position angles are  west \" = @xmath31 ,  east \" = @xmath32 ,  north \" = @xmath33 , and  south \" = @xmath34 . ] of approximate projected length @xmath35 ( 16  kpc ) , with two `` knots '' that we will call `` k1 '' and `` k2 , '' and two additional bright spots at the west end of the jet that do not lie on the same east - west line . to avoid confusion with k1 and k2",
    ", we will refer to the first of these spots as the `` knob , '' denoted `` kb , '' and the final one as the `` hotspot , '' or `` hs ; '' see figure  [ fig : cxibl]a .",
    "examination of the polarization images below suggests that we further subdivide the knob into a northern piece we will refer to as `` kbn '' and a southern piece `` kbs . ''",
    "figure  [ fig : spixcx ] shows a spectral index image in color over total intensity contours , made from from the images in figure  [ fig : cxibl ] .",
    "the core has a rather flat spectrum with @xmath36 , while the spectral index of the jet along the ridge - line ranges over @xmath3 @xmath37 .",
    "the spectrum is significantly steeper along the south edge of the jet yet flatter on the north side , and flatter between k2 and kb , and between kb and hs .",
    "the spectral index is plotted along with the ridge - line intensities in figure  [ fig : alpha+i ] .",
    "the error bars for @xmath38 were determined from the estimate of the systematic uncertainties in the intensities derived by comparison of pairs of independent images made from the same data .    , and has been rotated by @xmath26 in position angle .",
    "see table  [ tab : maps ] for image data and figure details.[fig : spixcx ] + ]      @xcite detected a possible counter - jet with ( true ) position angle @xmath39 . in the naturally - weighted image ( figure  [ fig : cfullbl ] ) we see the same feature in essentially the same location at both 5 and 8  ghz .",
    "is this feature a counter - jet ? in our images",
    "it is not as `` jet - like '' as in figure  2 of @xcite , and it does not meet the criteria of @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the feature is real ; at a distance of @xmath40 from the core the intensity is about 1  mjy / beam , a factor of about 20 fainter than the main jet at the same core distance , and so we take @xmath41 as a lower limit on the jet  counter - jet ratio . in figure",
    "[ fig : ratios ] we show theoretical curves of constant jet - counter - jet ratio in the @xmath42 plane , assuming that the jet and counter - jet lie along the same line and taking @xmath43 .",
    "examination of the curves shows that the fluid speed must be @xmath44 .",
    "thus our images support the conclusion of @xcite that at least mildly relativistic fluid speeds are required on kiloparsec scales in 3c345 .",
    "more stringent constraints are derived by @xcite from a model of the polarization .",
    "we also show the curve @xmath45 that expresses the constraint that the photons we observe are emitted perpendicular to the jet axis in the frame of the fluid @xcite .",
    "the shape of the jet may play an important role in understanding the peculiar electric vector configuration in this object ( see  [ s : twist ] below ) .",
    "we examined the divergence of the main body of the jet using a set of transverse slices taken from the image in figure  [ fig : highres2 ] .",
    "we estimated the half - width at half - maximum of the jet in two ways , by fitting gaussian profiles to the slices , and by searching for the location of the half - maxima on each side of the peak , and subtracting the beam quadratically .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : jetwidthsx1 ] , which shows deconvolved half - widths and fits .",
    "the linear least - squares fits yield half - opening angles of @xmath46 and @xmath47 , depending on whether or not the fit is forced to go through the origin .",
    "we adopt an apparent half - opening angle of @xmath48 .    .",
    "the data points are the means of gaussian fits and simple searches for the half - power points , and the error bars are standard errors using these two estimates .",
    "the linear least - squares fits yield half - opening angles of about @xmath4.[fig : jetwidthsx1 ] ]      the linear polarization and @xmath49 are combined to make the complex linear polarization @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the fractional polarization , @xmath52 is the linearly polarized intensity , and @xmath53 is the electric vector position angle . ] structures at 5 and 8  ghz are shown in figure  [ fig : polnmaps ] , and the fractional polarization is illustrated in figure  [ fig : fpol ] .",
    "we confirm the discovery by @xcite that the electric vectors in the jet are not transverse to the jet but twisted at a significant angle here we are able to resolve the polarization of jet in the transverse direction , and find that the twist is greatest , about @xmath54 , down the center of the jet and vanishes at both edges .",
    "the fractional polarization of the jet is about 25% down the center of the main part of the jet , greater at the edges , and varies strongly with position in kb and hs .",
    "we first address the possibility that the twist in electric vector position angles is due to faraday rotation in the jet .",
    "this is ruled out as it is apparent from figure  [ fig : polnmaps ] that the electric vector distributions at the two frequencies are nearly identical .",
    "polarization angle differences @xmath55 across 3c345 are shown in figure  [ fig : dchi ] , where @xmath56 is displayed as position angle . any deviations from the vertical indicate faraday rotation . for a rotation measure of @xmath57 . ] everywhere in the source except the edges , @xmath58 , corresponding to about @xmath59 70  rad  m@xmath60 .",
    "the total range of @xmath56 in the brighter parts , which is independent of absolute polarization position angle calibration , is @xmath61 , or 100  rad  m@xmath60 .",
    "these amounts of faraday rotation produce only small @xmath56 at these frequencies , and we conclude that faraday rotation is not the cause of the twist in the * e * vector directions in the main body of the jet .",
    "vectors , made from ( a ) 5 & ( b ) 8  ghz vla a - array data .",
    "the contours are of linearly polarized intensity .",

    "data from figure  [ fig : polnmaps ] .",
    "see table  [ tab : maps ] for image data and figure details.[fig : dchi ] ]    @xcite found an integrated rotation measure of @xmath62 for 3c345 , but our measurement at the core yields @xmath63 .",
    "our absolute position angle calibration uncertainty of @xmath18 corresponds to a rotation measure uncertainty of about @xmath64 , marginally incompatible with the integrated measurement .",
    "we have examined data from the university of michigan radio astronomy observatory for this epoch , and they are compatible with our measurement of negligible faraday rotation .",
    "the source is highly variable and this is the likely cause of the disagreement with the @xcite measurement .    in highly - luminous radio sources with fr  ii structure such as 3c345",
    "the inferred magnetic field in the jets is typically longitudinal @xcite , as evidenced by orthogonal * e * vectors , while in low - luminosity fr  i sources the inferred field is transverse @xcite .",
    "thus the linear polarization distribution in the straight portion of the 3c345 jet is unusual in that the * e * vectors are neither longitudinal nor transverse to the jet axis .",
    "the non - co - linear @xmath65 structure of the jet seems to suggest that the jet was pointed in different directions at different times in the past @xcite .",
    "but the polarization structure strongly suggests that this is not the case , and instead that kb contains two impact points of a jet that is twice re - directed by interactions with the external medium , and that comes to an apparent end at the hotspot .",
    "we interpret the electric vector configurations at kbs , kbn , and hs as indicating compressed sheets of magnetic field seen roughly edge - on @xcite . in kbs and kbn the jet is redirected by interaction with the ambient medium , and at hs the jet ends in a hot - spot .",
    "this interpretation is consistent with a jet inclined at a small angle to the line of sight that is seen roughly from the side due to aberration because its fluid speed is highly relativistic .",
    "is the magnetic field in the 3c345 helical , as it appears to be ?",
    "there are few similar examples in the literature , the best observed one being m87 .",
    "there the well - resolved jet shows a twisted filamentary structure in the radio @xcite that has been ascribed to a kelvin - helmholtz instability @xcite , and the magnetic field structure seems to follow the filaments .",
    "optically it looks quite similar to the radio image @xcite . in 3c345",
    "we see no filamentary structure in the jet , and suggest instead that the twisted electric field pattern is the result of relativistic transfer effects .",
    "a helical magnetic field in a transparent homogeneous cylindrical jet would appear either transverse or longitudinal , not helical , due to cancellations between the back and the front ( in a horizontal jet this means that stokes @xmath49 is identically zero ) .",
    "two possibilities for producing a twist in the electric vector pattern suggest themselves ; either the symmetry through the jet is broken by opacity or it is broken by relativistic effects . in the latter case , the gentle divergence in the profile of the jet demonstrated in  [ s : openingangle ] suggests a similarly diverging velocity field .",
    "in such a velocity field , differential doppler boosting due to differing line - of - sight velocity components in the front and back of the jet will break the symmetry , permitting there to be non - zero @xmath49 , and thus creating a twist to the observed electric vectors if the underlying magnetic field is helical .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that simple models for the magnetic field in 3c345 coupled with differential doppler boosting in a gently diverging jet can produce the `` twist '' seen in the electric vectors in the main body of the jet .",
    "this model can be used to place limits on the speed of the jet .",
    "we have made sensitive vla array a - array images of the nearby bright quasar 3c 345 in total intensity and linear polarization at 5 and 8  ghz .",
    "the principle results of the analysis of these images are the following .    1 .",
    "3c345 has a bright 7 - 8  jy unresolved core with spectral index @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the jet consists of a straight section of projected length about @xmath66 ( 15  kpc ) , and two bright knots at the end of the jet that do not lie on the same line .",
    "the spectral index of the jet ranges over @xmath3 .",
    "the spectrum flattens significantly between the end of the main body of the jet and the first knot at the end , and between that knot and the final one .",
    "4 .   the jet diverges slightly with an apparent half - opening angle of about @xmath4 . de - projected , the jet opening angle is significantly smaller @xcite .",
    "there is a faint near - core feature whose base extend from the core at ( true ) position angle @xmath67 .",
    "this feature does not appear to be a true counter - jet , but instead is part of an extended lobe seen in projection .",
    "the lack of a true counter - jet requires fluid speeds @xmath5 .",
    "the fractional polarization in the jet is high , ranging over @xmath68 , and is systematically greater at the edges .",
    "the non - co - linearity of the main body of the jet and the knots at its end seems to indicate that the jet was pointed in different directions at different times in the past .",
    "however , the polarization structure suggests instead that the knots represent three impact points with the external medium of a jet that is twice re - directed by interactions .",
    "the polarization behavior in the knots at the apparent end of the jet is consistent with the possibility that the jet , despite being at a small angle to the line of sight , is seen effectively from the side due to relativistic effects for a fast - moving flow .",
    "unusually , the electric vector directions in the main body of the jet are neither longitudinal nor transverse , but are twisted . 10 .",
    "the `` twist '' in the electric vectors is not due to faraday rotation , which is a few degrees or less everywhere , and is significantly less in the core , the brightest parts of the jet , and the knots at the end .",
