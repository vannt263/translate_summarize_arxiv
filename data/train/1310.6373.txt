    "the distribution of mass in galaxy clusters , groups and massive galaxies provides a powerful tool for cosmological studies .",
    "explicit predictions from our current @xmath0cdm  cosmological paradigm for the number , size and radial mass distribution of dark matter halos can now be tested against high - quality constraints from studies employing lensing , sunyaev - zeldovich , stellar dynamics and , in particular , x - rays @xcite .",
    "the relative distribution of dark and baryonic mass , coupled with the thermodynamic state of the hot intracluster medium , similarly provides a unique insight into the uncertain baryonic physics of galaxy formation , such as the role of feedback in shaping the nascent structures , and the complex interplay between adiabatic contraction and dynamical friction @xcite .",
    "spherical , hydrostatic x - ray techniques are an appealing method for measuring such mass distributions due to their computational simplicity , given the isotropy of the gas pressure tensor , and the small biases introduced by the spherical approximation ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , particularly if the spherically averaged mass profile is close to a singular isothermal sphere @xcite .",
    "while the hot gas permeating the potential well is not expected to be exactly hydrostatic , theoretical arguments and observational constraints suggest only modest ( 30% ) biases on the inferred gravitating mass distribution , provided care is taken to study systems with relaxed x - ray morphologies @xcite . with the current generation of x - ray observatories ,",
    "x - ray methods are especially appealing as they can provide mass measurements over @xmath13 orders of magnitude in virial mass , or more , and the radial mass distribution inferred can span a similarly large dynamical range in radius @xcite .    for spherically distributed hot gas in hydrostatic equilibrium , the radial mass profile can be uniquely inferred provided the gas density and temperature profiles are known @xcite .",
    "prior to the launch of  and , temperature profiles were typically sparsely sampled , at best . in such circumstances",
    ", isothermality is a convenient approximation , since the gas temperature does not vary dramatically with radius .",
    "this then implies a one - to - one relation between the gravitational potential and the density profile , and hence the surface brightness distribution , provided the abundance profile is known ( or , more usually , assumed to be flat ) . for a @xcite gravitational potential ,",
    "this leads to the ubiquitous `` isothermal @xmath2-model '' @xcite .",
    "the simple analytical form of the @xmath2-model has guaranteed its longevity as a convenient ad hoc fitting function even though the underlying assumptions of the model are no longer believed to hold strictly @xcite .    with the advent of  and ,",
    "spatially resolved spectroscopy has largely superseded wide - band surface brightness photometry as a means for measuring the mass ( although see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , at least for high signal - to - noise ( s / n ) data @xcite .",
    "a range of techniques have evolved for transforming the spectra into mass constraints ( * ? ? ? * for a review ) , most of which first entail fitting a single - phase plasma model to spectra from different regions of sky in order to obtain binned temperature ( and , possibly , density ) profiles .",
    "this process often introduces correlations between the binned temperature or density points , especially if deprojection techniques are employed or if coarser binning is used for the temperature or abundance than the density .",
    "care should be taken to account for these , for example by using the full covariance matrix to compute @xmath3 when model - fitting downstream , rather than the common practice of just using the leading diagonal @xcite . even for gas that is strictly single phase in any infinitesimal volume , temperature or",
    "abundance variations over the spectral extraction aperture violate the single phase approximation in that bin and can lead to biases in the inferred temperature , abundance or density profiles @xcite .",
    "attempts to mitigate these issues have been made by modifying the spectral fitting procedure .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite fitted stacks of coarsely - binned , narrow - band images ( `` data cubes '' ) by adopting parametrized models for the temperature , abundance , and either the gas density or gravitating mass profiles .",
    "( in the latter case , the gas density profile was then derived under the hydrostatic approximation . )",
    "given the physical state of the gas as a function of position predicted by this model , spectra were generated in a series of shells that were , in turn , projected along the line of sight and fitted directly to the data cube .",
    "this circumvents the intermediate step of measuring the binned temperature profile .",
    "similar approaches , albeit emphasizing the simultaneous fitting of full - resolution spectra obtained from concentric annuli , were advocated by @xcite and @xcite .    in objects with lower surface brightness",
    "it is often impossible to obtain sufficient photons to enable high - quality spectral analysis in as many bins as required . in these cases , it is common practice to measure coarse , global quantities such as the emission - weighted luminosity ( determined , for example , from a @xmath2-model fit ) , temperature or @xmath4 ( the product of temperature and gas mass : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and apply scaling relations to transform these into mass estimates @xcite .",
    "the calibration of these scaling relations is generally empirical , and , to be reliable , requires high resolution spectroscopy of objects similar to those under scrutiny .",
    "any given object can not , in practice , be guaranteed to obey these relations , and assuming this behaviour can , therefore , restrict discovery space .    as a compromise between these two extremes ( global scaling relations and spatially resolved spectroscopy )",
    ", we propose a powerful alternative method , _ narrow band photometry _ ,",
    "the simultaneous fitting of radial x - ray surface brightness profiles in multiple pulse height ( pha ) bands , as an appropriate choice for modest - s / n data .",
    "this involves first adopting models for the three - dimensional gas temperature , density and abundance profiles , which are then used to derive the predicted surface brightness distribution in each band .",
    "while this has philosophical similarities to the data cube fitting of @xcite , in this paper , we demonstrate that only a limited number of energy bands are necessary to constrain the mass of the system . by emphasizing radial surface brightness photometry ,",
    "the treatment of the background is also simplified .",
    "if the source and background models are constrained together , spectral based methods generally require the arbitrary parametrization of the background spectrum , as well as usually employing assumptions over its spatial variation @xcite . in our approach",
    ", we demonstrate that minimal assumptions need to be made about the spectral shape of the background",
    ".    an essential ingredient of our approach is a physical model for the three dimensional distribution of the gas density and temperature . in our recent work",
    ", we have demonstrated the utility of an entropy - based model , in which the gas density and temperature profiles are inferred self - consistently in the hydrostatic approximation from a model for the ( non - gas ) gravitating mass and the gas entropy @xcite .",
    "part of the advantage of this parametrization is that it allows convective stability ( a necessary condition for hydrostatic equilibrium ) to be rigorously enforced , which imposes additional important constraints on the mass distribution @xcite .",
    "similar , entropy - based approaches have been independently explored in the context of sunyaev - zeldovich studies @xcite , and in a more non - parametric manner by @xcite .",
    "we have found that a powerlaw model ( with arbitrary , multiple breaks ) and a central plateau is sufficient to fit typical entropy profiles measured from high - quality , spatially resolved spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "when using such a model , a major source of uncertainty is the behaviour of the entropy at the largest physical scales , where the s / n of the data is lowest , which can translate into errors on the recovered global properties , such as the gas fraction @xcite .",
    "in addition to the usual powerlaw parametrization , in this paper , we therefore also explore a class of model that mitigates this uncertainty by exploiting , in a somewhat revised form , the recently discovered correlation between the gas fraction and entropy profile , which spans a wide range of halo mass @xcite .",
    "we discuss the practical implementation of narrow band photometry in x - ray analysis in   [ sect_narrow_band ] . in   [ sect_entropy_model ]",
    "we illustrate how this technique can be used in conjunction with the entropy - based , hydrostatic gas model to constrain the gravitating mass over a range of mass scales by employing simulations tailored to match two well - studied objects from the literature .",
    "finally , in   [ sect_entropy_scaling ] , we show how additional constraints on the entropy profile lead to a new class of model that is optimal for fitting low s / n data , and reach our conclusions in   [ sect_discussion ] .",
    "in this section , we discuss the practical implementation of narrow band photometry as a tool for x - ray astronomy .",

    "forward fitting is a powerful way to achieve this .",
    "this entails adopting a reasonable parametrization for @xmath21 as a function of ( @xmath26 ) , and evaluating eqn  [ eqn_ci_definition ] numerically .",
    "the adopted parameters are adjusted until good agreement is found with the measured @xmath27 . as we discuss below (   [ sect_hardness ] ) , it is generally insufficient to use a single photometric band @xmath6@xmath7 , and so multiple surface brightness profiles ( @xmath28 ) will need to be fitted simultaneously . to simplify the problem , spherical symmetry is generally assumed . in appendix  [ sect_sb ]",
    "we outline a practical scheme for evaluating the integral efficiently in that case .          directly fitting a coronal plasma model to the full resolution spectrum of the hot gas",
    "provides the most reliable means for measuring the temperature and metallicity .",
    "provided the abundance ratios of key species with respect to fe are known ( for example , if they match the solar abundance pattern ) , however , hardness ratios (  the ratio of the detected count - rates in two energy - bands ) can also be used to extract temperature and abundance information .    for representative  acis - s3 observations ,",
    "we show in fig  [ fig_hardness ] the loci in hardness - hardness space of apec thermal plasma models having different temperatures and abundances . we have carefully chosen the energy - bands under scrutiny to maximize the separation of the models , but it is clear that two hardness ratios (  three energy bands ) are sufficient to constrain the gas temperature and abundance ( and hence density ) in these observations .",

    "we have demonstrated that narrow band photometry provides an effective alternative to spatially resolved spectroscopy for determining detailed mass profiles of x - ray luminous galaxies , groups and clusters . since surface photometry is , in general , less demanding of data than spectroscopy , the narrow band photometric method presented here is ideally suited to systems with modest s / n , for which spatially resolved spectroscopy is not realistic . without the intermediate step of measuring temperature and",
    "density profiles ( from single phase plasma model fits ) , biases due to the projection of different temperature gas components along the line of sight are effectively minimized , and the difficulty of accounting for covariance between the temperature and density data points downstream is circumvented .    in our fully bayesian forward - fitting analysis , a model for the surface brightness profile in each band is constructed based on a physical model for the mass distribution and the entropy profile , assuming hydrostatic equilibrium , a single phase gas and spherical symmetry , and is directly fitted to the data . although real galaxy clusters are not exactly spherical , on average the spherical approximation does not introduce significant bias into their inferred global properties , such as the virial mass , halo concentration , and gas fraction @xcite .",
    "similarly , the hydrostatic approximation , provided the system is sufficiently relaxed in its x - ray morphology , is likely to be accurate at least to the @xmath125%  level ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . in regions",
    "where the gas is morphologically relaxed , spatially resolved spectroscopy is generally consistent with a single phase plasma , provided the temperature gradient is not strong across the aperture @xcite .",
    "similarly , the range of temperatures in the cores of clusters measured within the  rgs aperture @xcite is broadly consistent with the observed central temperature gradients .",
    "limited multiphase gas has , nevertheless , been inferred in regions of strong interaction between the hot gas and ejecta from a central agn @xcite .",
    "recent work has also invoked multiphase gas as a possible explanation of the unexpected flattening of cluster entropy profiles outside @xmath1@xmath107  @xcite , although observations of relaxed clusters suggest such behaviour ( and , hence , the postulated clumping ) is not ubiquitous @xcite .    while it is relatively straightforward to identify and exclude data from the disturbed cores of clusters ( where the hydrostatic and single phase approximations may break down ) , the effects of possible clumping at large scales are more troubling , due to projection effects . still , if one focuses on regions well within projected @xmath107 , the projected emission from outside @xmath107  is unlikely to contribute significantly along the line of sight , in which case the results should not depend sensitively on the behaviour of the entropy in the outskirts of the cluster .",
    "this can be tested explicitly by varying the maximum radius used during the projection calculation .",
    "application of the photometry method to the outskirts of clusters can , of course , also be used to test the need for clumping or deviations from hydrostatic equilibrium in those regions . if necessary , given a physical model for the clumping , the expression for @xmath21 can be modified to compensate and allow a useful measurement of the gravitating mass even in those regions .    while the number of energy bands used is entirely arbitrary",
    ", we found that three standard bands ( 0.50.9  kev , 0.92.0  kev and 2.07.0  kev ) were sufficient to constrain the gas temperature and total abundance from  data over a fairly wide range of parameter space .",
    "limiting the number of photometric bands is desirable , since it minimizes the number of adjustable parameters needed to account for the background . nevertheless ,",
    "if the data permit , the number of energy bands can be expanded to focus on regions of particular interest that may help constrain the relative abundance of other species , such as o , ne , mg and si .      we present two classes of hydrostatic model that enable the gravitating mass to be inferred .",
    "both involve a physical model for the ( non - gas ) gravitating mass ( comprising dark matter halo , stars and central black hole ) , and solving the hydrostatic equations ( eqn  [ eqn_zeta][eqn_mg ] ) by imposing a constraint on the entropy distribution .",
    "the performance of the former approach , which entails adopting an arbitrary parametrization for the entropy profile , has been demonstrated in our previous , spatially resolved spectrocopic fits to x - ray data @xcite , and , independently , in fits to sunyaev - zeldovich data @xcite .",
    "combined with narrow - band photometry , we have demonstrated that precise , accurate constraints can be obtained on the global properties of objects over a wide mass range .",
    "the latter entropy parametrization is more suitable for lower s / n data , since it involves exploiting an empirical scaling relation between the gas fraction and entropy profile outside the cooling core , effectively eliminating the arbitrariness in the extrapolation of the entropy profile to large scales .",
    "this scaling relation is unlikely to be exact in any given system , which introduces systematic errors into the recovered temperature and density profiles , especially in the system cores .",
    "however , with the extra constraints at large scale , we found that the reduction in the error - space did not give rise to appreciable biases in the derived global system properties .",
    "the utility of this method is illustrated by the fact that , even for a shallow , snapshot observation of a realistic low - mass object , we were still able to recover the global parameters to within @xmath10.1  dex .      for simplicity ,",
    "our simulations were for systems with a constant metallicity profile .",
    "in reality morphologically relaxed systems tend to have centrally - peaked metallicity distributions @xcite and so , if the properties in the centre of the system are important it is necessary to modify the model to incorporate such a gradient .",
    "as there is no _ de facto _ standard model for such purposes , we recommend a simple ansatz , such as : @xmath108 where @xmath109 and @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 are adjustable fit parameters , and we initially assume that the ratio of the abundance of the other metals to fe does not vary with radius . to verify that adopting such a parametrization does not appreciably degrade the constraints on the global system parameters , we re - simulated object b , assuming eqn  [ eqn_abund_gradient ] .",
    "we set @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115  [ kpc ] and @xmath116 .",
    "we fitted the surface brightness profiles , using the scam  model ( this time incorporating eqn  [ eqn_abund_gradient ] ) and allowing the parameters @xmath109 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 to be fitted .",
    "we summarize the constraints on the global parameters in fig  [ fig_compare_derived ] , demonstrating that incorporating an abundance gradient into our fits does not significantly degrade the level of constraints we can obtain .",
    "furthermore , with this approach , we were also able to constrain the abundance profile reliably ( we measured @xmath117 , @xmath118 [ kpc ] and @xmath119 ) .",
    "while we have focused on the use of the scam  model in the context of narrow - band x - ray photometry , it actually has broader implications .",
    "in particular , it is a potentially powerful tool for constraining the global properties of galaxy clusters from the sunyaev - zeldovich ( s - z ) effect ( * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "the key observable is the compton y - parameter , @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the thompson scattering cross - section , @xmath122 is the mass of the electron , @xmath123 is the speed of light , @xmath124 is the electron number density , and the integral is along the line - of - sight ( los ) . in comparison to x - ray emission ,",
    "for which the emissivity depends on the density _ squared _ , the y - parameter is more sensitive to the properties of the gas at large radii .    in order to derive the physical properties of a system from the inferred y - parameter ,",
    "it is necessary to construct a model for the spatial variation in both density and temperature .",
    "models employing _ ad hoc _ parametrization for the thermodynamical state of the gas , for example the isothermal @xmath2-model , or even the simple entropy - based model discussed in   [ sect_entropy_model ] ( for the application of this kind of model to s - z data , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , can not be guaranteed to capture the true behaviour of the gas when extrapolated to large scales .",
    "on the other hand , the thermodynamic behaviour of the gas at large radii predicted by the scam  model is determined entirely by the underlying scaling relation , and it is clear from fig  [ fig_kt_rho_rxj ] that it is sufficiently accurate to model morphologically relaxed objects with very different mass distributions , density and temperature profiles . while it remains to be seen whether there exist clusters for which the empirical scam  scaling does not ( at least approximately ) hold , the well - determined asymptotic behaviour of the model is very desirable in s - z studies , and so we strongly advocate its use .",
