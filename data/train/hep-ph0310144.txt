    "@xcite , the couplings of the zero - mode fermions to the lightest kaluza - klein ( kk ) excitations of gauge bosons become large for tev brane localized fermions .",
    "although this might result in tight constraints from electroweak precision measurements  @xcite , the actual bounds are quite model dependent , with the most important factors being the choice of `` weak '' gauge group in the bulk and the localization of the light fermions .",
    "however , even if the latter are considered on the planck brane in order to avoid electroweak bounds , at least part of the third generation should be tev localized .",
    "this constitutes a potentially large source for flavor violation , particularly with third generation quarks .",
    "such dynamics is also present in purely four dimensional theories .",
    "for instance , this is the case in topcolor theories  @xcite , where a gauge interaction strongly coupled to the third generation quarks is spontaneously broken at the tev scale .",

    "we consider the flavor violation induced in these models . in particular , we study the fcnc effects leading to @xmath0 transitions induced by massive color - octet gauge bosons that are present in all the specific realizations . in the case of warped extra dimensions ,",
    "the kk excitations of the gluon field give rise to these interactions provided that the zero - mode fermions of third generation quarks are localized toward the tev brane , as it is required in order to obtain a large top yukawa coupling . in topcolor theories , the dynamics responsible for top - condensation",

    "the presence of these extra contributions is model - dependent and therefore we choose to focus on the color - octet gauge boson interactions , which in any event tend to give the largest effects due to the presence of @xmath6 . we show that flavor - violating color - octet interactions strongly coupled to the third generation could naturally lead to large effects in @xmath7 and @xmath8 cp asymmetries , such as in @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 among others .",

    "in addition , and as it was recognized in ref.@xcite , it is possible to generate the fermion mass hierarchy from @xmath33 flavor breaking in the bulk masses of fermions . since bulk",
    "fermion masses result in the localization of fermion zero - modes , lighter fermions should be localized toward the planck brane , where their wave - function has exponentially suppressed overlap with the tev - localized higgs , whereas fermions with order one yukawa couplings should be localized toward the tev brane .",
    "this creates an almost inevitable tension : since the lightest kk excitations of gauge bosons are localized toward the tev brane , they tend to be strongly coupled to zero - mode fermions localized there .",
    "thus , the flavor - breaking fermion localization leads to flavor violating interactions of the kk gauge bosons .",
    "in particular , this is the case when one tries to obtain the correct top yukawa coupling : the kk excitations of the various gauge bosons propagating in the bulk will have fcnc interactions with the third generation quarks , as we will see below in detail .",

    "finally , there will also be contributions from the heavy gluons to other non - leptonic @xmath19 decays , such as @xmath172 , etc .",
    "these modes have less clean sm predictions . however , if the deviations hinted in table  [ data ] are confirmed by data samples of @xmath173 , to be accumulated in the next few years , it might prove of great importance to confirm the existence of these effects in less clean modes , perhaps requiring even larger data samples .",
    "even if the heavy gluons are directly observed at the lhc , their flavor - violating interactions will be less obvious there than from large enough @xmath19 physics samples .",
    "thus , if flavor violating interactions are observed at the lhc , high precision @xmath19 physics experiments could prove crucial to elucidate what is their role in fermion mass generation .",
