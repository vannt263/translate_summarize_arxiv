    "recent advances in infrared and x - ray array technologies have greatly increased the spatial coverage and resolutions in near - ir and x - ray observations , providing powerful tools to compare high - resolution radio , ir and x - ray images of the complex region of the galactic center .",
    "sgr a@xmath0 is a bright compact radio source which is considered to be the strongest candidate for a 2.5@xmath10 black hole at the dynamical center of the galaxy ( eckart and genzel 1997 ; ghez et al .",
    "this source is surrounded by diffuse ionized gas as well as clusters of hot and cool stars seen in near - ir wavelengths .",
    "detailed comparison of radio and near - ir images was recently made with a new approach by menten et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , who detected a number of sio ( 0.7 cm ) and h@xmath11o ( 1.3 cm ) masers associated with known compact stellar sources seen in the diffraction limited 2.2 @xmath12 m infrared images .",
    "astrometric measurements between radio and 2 @xmath12 m images of this region were used to determine the position of sgr a@xmath0 with respect to other well - known near - ir sources .",
    "although the relative position of sgr a@xmath0 is accurately measured within 30 mas in this technique , the absolute position of sgr a@xmath0 was known with an accuracy of 0.2@xmath13 .",
    "a more accurate position of this source and its subsequent x - ray counterpart in future sub - arcsecond observations has important implications on the nature of high energy activity predicted from models of this source ( melia 1994 ; narayan et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "the absolute positions of radio sources are routinely obtained to an accuracy of a few milliarcseconds using centimeter wavelength vlbi techniques .",
    "however , the large scattering diameter of sgr a@xmath0 ( yusef - zadeh et al . 1994 ) makes the application of centimeter wavelength vlbi less feasible , as the source is completely resolved on longer baselines .",
    "thus , shorter baseline arrays and/or shorter wavelengths are needed resulting in reduced positional accuracy .",
    "the most recent measurements of the location of sgr a@xmath0 with the smallest error bar is given as @xmath2 , @xmath3 [ 1950 ] = @xmath14 29314@xmath15 , @xmath16 ( rogers et al .",
    "this position is determined with respect to the reference source nrao 530 using vlbi techniques at 3 mm .    to improve the absolute position of sgr a@xmath0",
    ", we obtained archival vla data sets at a number of frequencies taken over the last 13 years . by averaging the position of sgr a@xmath0 at different frequencies and at different epochs , the new position of sgr a@xmath0",
    "is determined with an accuracy of an order of magnitude better than earlier measurements .",
    "the averaging of the data over such a long span of time and frequency can be justified .",
    "the proper motion measurements of this source is too small with respect to reference extragalactic radio sources ( reid et al .",
    "1998 ; backer 1996 ) to affect individual measurement . also , the change in the position of sgr a@xmath0 as a function of frequency is too small to be significant compared to other systematic errors .",
    "the frequency dependence of the size of sgr a@xmath0 due to scattering of radio waves will not change the centroid of the position of sgr a@xmath0 as a function of frequency ( yusef - zadeh et al .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the detection of frequency dependence of the position of sgr a@xmath0 at a milliarcsecond level , due to its intrinsic radio emission , has the potential to support the asymmetrical bondi - hoyle accretion model ( melia 1994 ) .",
    "table 1 shows the list of 15 data sets that were based on continuum observations made with the very large array of the national radio astronomy observatory at 6 ( 5 ghz ) , 3.6 ( 8.4 ghz ) , 2 ( 15 ghz ) , 1.2 ( 20 ghz ) , and 0.7 cm ( 44 ghz ) between 1986 and 1999 .",
    "all had a bandwidth ranging between 2 @xmath17 50 and 2 @xmath17 12.5 mhz in each right and left circular polarization .",
    "each of these original data sets had relatively good uv coverage and none were done in snapshot mode with less than one hour of integration time on the source . with the exception of 0.7 cm data which was taken in the c configuration ,",
    "all the observations were done in either the a or the b configurations of the vla to obtain the highest resolution images of sgr a@xmath0 with minimal contamination or confusion by ionized features in the vicinity of sgr a@xmath0 .",
    "the low resolution images of sgr a@xmath0 at 20 and 90 cm suffer from this source confusion as well as optical depth effects due to intervening thermal and nonthermal continuum sources .",
    "thus , 20 and 90 cm observations were not used .    in all observations , nrao530 and 3c286 were chosen as the phase ( astrometric ) and flux ( photometric ) calibrators , respectively .",
    "all processing was done using the nrao aips analysis package ; the standard calibration was applied and the field around sgr a@xmath0 was imaged .",
    "since the observations were all made in the b1950 coordinate system , the data were analyzed in this system .",
    "the vla calibrator b1950 coordinate system is referred to epoch 1979.5 .",
    "no self  calibration was done on any of the data as this procedure loses the absolute position of a source in order to minimize atmospheric phase errors .",
    "prior to self - calibration , no significant emission from sgr a@xmath0 was detected at 0.7 cm in the a and b configurations , so these data were excluded .",
    "vla continuum data consists of two independent frequency bands .",
    "the final images based on combining these two frequency bands were used to determine the position of sgr a@xmath0 with aips routine jmfit by fitting a gaussian to the source .",
    "fits done using images from the individual frequency bands showed no significant positional shift .    at short wavelengths ,",
    "the phase fluctuations degrading the positional accuracy are due mainly to variable refraction in the troposphere ; at longer wavelengths the ionosphere adds increasingly important contributions .",
    "variable ionospheric refraction is particularly significant for observations made at 6 cm during the day when the ionosphere is densest .",
    "solar heating of the troposphere also increases the variations in refraction .",
    "so , we have assigned weights of 1 and 2 to day and night - time observations , respectively . for observations that were carried out between night and day ,",
    "the assigned weight was 1.5 .",
    "the atmospheric effects are aggravated by the low declination of the source and the calibrator and the resultant low elevation angles of the observations .",
    "these effects are minimized by restricting the _ uv _ data to near transit .",
    "the data sets selected within one to three hours of the highest elevation improved considerably the dispersion in measured position of sgr a@xmath0 among the different epochs .",
    "errors in atmospheric refraction affect mainly the measurements of the declination of sgr a@xmath0 .",
    "the astrometric calibrator used , nrao530 , is about 15@xmath18 north of sgr a@xmath0 .",
    "since the observations were restricted to those near transit , this corresponds to a difference primarily in elevation .",
    "corrections to the atmospheric refraction model are determined from the calibrator observations which is at a significantly higher elevation than sgr a@xmath0 ( i.e. at lower air mass ) ; any unmodeled differences in atmospheric refraction between the calibrator and sgr a@xmath0 will appear primarily as errors in declination .",
    "a further potential source of systematic error is the assumed position of the calibrator , nrao530 .",
    "our measurements are of position relative to that of the calibrator whose absolute position is known ; any errors in the assumed position of nrao530 will directly affect the derived position of sgr a@xmath0 . in all our measurements ,",
    "the position of nrao530 was constant and was assumed to be at ( b1950 epoch 1979.5 ) @xmath2 , @xmath3 = @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "this position is consistent to within 5 mas of the vlbi source position given by johnston et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and by us naval observatory s ( usno ) astrometry list ( ftp://casa.usno.navy.mil/navnet/n9798.sor ) after the correction between the vla and usno frames is made .",
    "the position of nrao530 assumed is an absolute position measured by vlbi techniques which are insensitive to structure larger than a few tens of milliarcseconds .",
    "nrao530 is suspected of having structure on the scale of several hundred milliarcseconds which would not affect the vlbi measurements but will cause an apparent shift of the position when viewed with the lower vla resolution .",
    "any difference between the centroid of the position of nrao530 at vlbi and vla resolutions will appear as an error in the derived position of sgr a@xmath0 .",
    "table 1 lists 15 data sets , three of which at 1.3 cm , four at 2 cm , five at 3.6 cm , two at 6 cm , and one at 0.7 cm . the date of each observation , the gaussian fitted position with 1 @xmath21 error , duration of the observation and the corresponding weight in the final averaging are also given .",
    "the errors of the fitted positions depend on the signal - to - noise ratio and are much less than the errors introduced by the atmosphere .",
    "the rms scatter within the data set , as described below , is about ten times the fitted noise , thus we have not used the errors of the fitted positions in any of our analysis .",
    "the mean position of sgr a@xmath0 , both weighted and unweighted , as well as the position determined by rogers et al .",
    "1994 are also listed at the bottom of the table .",
    "the most descripant point at 1.3 cm was not included in the final averaging .",
    "the rms scatter of the individual measurements in table 1 ( either weighted or unweighted ) is about 0.035@xmath13 in right ascension and 0.055 `` in declination .",
    "this is consistent with the assumption that the errors are dominated by uncertainties in atmospheric refraction which should produce a larger scatter in declination .",
    "this is further supported by the two pairs of positions measured on the same day , in which the declinations differed by about 0.030 '' , or nearly half of the day - to - day scatter .",
    "the one sigma errors in the mean position are taken to be the rms scatter of the sample divided by the square root of the number of observations minus one .",
    "figure 1 shows the right ascension and declination of sgr a@xmath0 with one sigma error given by rogers et al .",
    "( 1994 ) against 15 positions determined from our measurements .",
    "all the new positions fall to the sw quadrant of the position derived by rogers et al .",
    "the weighted position of sgr a@xmath0 with the weighted mean epoch of our observation being 1992.4 is ( b1950 ) @xmath2 , @xmath3 = @xmath4 293076@xmath5 , @xmath22 or ( j2000 ) @xmath2 , @xmath3 = @xmath8 400383@xmath5 , @xmath23 .",
    "these measurements are in good agreement with the less precise measurement of rogers et al .",
