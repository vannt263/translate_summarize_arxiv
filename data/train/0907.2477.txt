    "realizing organic ferromagnets consisting entirely of non - magnetic elements is a challenging target in condensed - matter physics and chemistry@xcite .",
    "we usually can not expect itinerant ferromagnetism in organic materials with p - bands , although there are very a few exceptions such as polymethylthiophene@xcite .",
    "therefore , we need a smart design / strategy to realize purely organic ferromagnets .    polymers of five membered rings constitute a unique and interesting playground for such materials design , because we can attach a variety of functional groups to the polymers .",
    "indeed , the present authors have proposed that we can realize `` flat - band ferromagnetism '' , originally conceived by mielke and by tasaki@xcite , in aminotriazole with the multi - band hubbard model@xcite .",
    "while it has been well known that the hubbard model can have a spin - polarized ground state , it is also well known that the periodic anderson model , which has been studied extensively especially in the context of the heavy - fermion electron systems , has various magnetic ground states that include a metallic ferromagnet . in the present study , we explore whether a purely organic polymer can be mapped to the periodic anderson model .",
    "in the course of our attempts , we have found that _ dimethylaminopyrrole _ , which can be polymerized comparatively easily@xcite , is a good candidate for that purpose in that it can accommodate an electronic structure having both narrow and wide bands . by means of spin - density - functional calculations",
    ", we shall indeed show that the polymer and oligomers of dimethylaminopyrrole have ferromagnetic ( f ) or antiferromagnetic ( af ) instabilities if holes are sufficiently doped ( i.e. , more than 1/2 hole per five - membered ring ) .",
    "as for the former instability , we propose that its origin can be explained by the scenario proposed by batista _",
    "et al._@xcite while we find that the difference between the energy of the f state and the af states are rather small in this material , we shall finally give a discussion on how the f state can be stabilized .",
    "-bands ( @xmath0-bands).,width=245 ]    let us start with the undoped polymer of dimethylaminopyrrole .",
    "figure  [ xyzband](a , b ) depicts the atomic structure of polydimethylaminopyrrole in a unit cell .",
    "we have studied both the spin - unpolarized cases based on the density - functional theory with generalized gradient approximation@xcite ( gga - dft ) and the spin - polarized ones based on the spin - density functional theory ( gga - sdft ) .",
    "we have used the plane - wave based ultrasoft pseudopotentials@xcite with the energy cutoff at 20.25 rydberg .",
    "the convergence criterion of the geometry optimization was that all of the forces acting on each atom were within @xmath1 h / a.u .",
    "we have first optimized the structure .",
    "while we have started , in our materials design , from a planar configuration of rings , the structure - optimized polydimethylaminopyrrole has dimethylamino bases somewhat twisted out of the plane .",
    "this makes the @xmath0-orbital of the nitrogen atom in the amino base lying in the molecular plane , that is , the angle between the @xmath0-orbitals of the nitrogen atom in the amino base and the neighboring nitrogen atom in the five membered ring becomes nearly 90 degrees , leading to a very small @xmath0-bonding between them .",
    "the band structure of undoped polydimethylaminopyrrole is shown in fig .",
    "[ xyzband](c ) .",
    "we can see that there exist flat bands ( labeled as ( b)-(e ) and ( c)-(f ) in fig .",
    "[ xyzband](c ) ) , but they lie well below the fermi energy , unlike the case of polyaminotriazole@xcite where the flat band sits around @xmath2 . in the band structure ,",
    "a band folding of the quasi - one - dimensional band is due to the alternating directions of the pyrrole molecules .",
    "( a - d ) or at x ( e - h ) as depicted by isosurfaces with different colors representing the signs of the wave function . see fig .",
    "[ xyzband](c ) for labels of the energy levels .",
    "we have chosen the wave function to be real at @xmath3 .",
    ", width=302 ]    figure  [ polwfn](a - h ) shows the wave functions in the highest four valence ( occupied ) bands at @xmath3 and x points .",
    "the wave functions of the flat bands ( b , c , e and f in fig .",
    "[ xyzband](c ) ) are mixtures of the @xmath0-orbitals of the nitrogen atoms and @xmath4-orbitals of the carbon atoms , while the other wave functions consist almost entirely of @xmath0-orbitals .",
    "we can thus call the flat bands ( b)-(e ) and ( c)-(f ) ( thick solid lines in fig .",
    "[ xyzband](c ) ) as @xmath4-bands , and the top valence band ( a)-(g ) ( uppermost thick dashed line in fig .",
    "[ xyzband ] ) as a @xmath0-band .    while in polyaminotriazole@xcite the @xmath0-band is flat , for which the `` flat - band ferromagnetism '' is expected to be realized , this is no longer the case with polydimethylaminopyrrole , since the @xmath0-band is considerably dispersive . on the other hand",
    "the @xmath4-bands are flat , and one might expect that the flat - band ferromagnetism may occur .",
    "this does not apply either , since the bands do not satisfy the local connectivity condition@xcite necessary for the flat - band ferromagnetism .",
    "they are flat simply because the transfer between five - membered rings is small , as seen in figs .",
    "[ polwfn](b ) , ( c ) , ( e ) and ( f ) where @xmath4-bonds are absent between those two carbon atoms connecting the adjacent five - membered rings .",
    "although small @xmath0-like orbitals can be seen there , they are negligibly small compared to those of @xmath0-bands in figs .",
    "[ polwfn](g ) and ( h ) .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table  [ nmers ] shows the result of gga - sdft calculations for a series of oligomers of dimethylaminopyrrole with various numbers of doped holes . in the calculation of the dimer and tetramer , geometry optimizations are performed for each hole concentration and each spin state , n , f and af . for the hexamer and larger oligomers , geometry optimization is performed only for undoped n state .",
    "such a treatment is acceptable because there is no significant difference in the optimized structures depending on the spin state and hole concentration in the polymers and small oligomers .",
    "the numbers of holes necessary for spin polarization and @xmath5 of f state almost fully agree with the above estimate in terms of the polymer s band structure .",
    "for the @xmath6-mers with odd @xmath7 , i.e. , hexamer and decamer , the values of the spin polarization agree well with the above estimate , which should reflect the fact that no energy levels associated with the @xmath0-band exist near the fermi energy when spin polarization emerges , as shown in fig .",
    "[ dividing](b ) . for the oligomers with even @xmath7 , i.e. , octamer and dodecamer",
    ", @xmath5 is expected to take either of @xmath8 and @xmath9 depending on the order of almost degenerated energy levels of @xmath0-band and @xmath4-band .",
    "the result shows that @xmath5 is always equal to @xmath8 for all cases .",
    "this indicates that the energy level of the @xmath0-band at x/2 is slightly higher than that of @xmath4-band .",
    "we have used a first - principles calculation to examine magnetism in a polymer and oligomers of dimethylaminopyrrole .",
    "we have found that polydimethylaminopyrrole should have magnetic instability if density of doped holes are more than one hole per unit cell ( @xmath10 ) . for @xmath6-mers of dimethylaminopyrrole , we conclude that @xmath11 or @xmath12 holes are necessary to have spin - polarization depending on whether @xmath7 is even or odd , respectively .",
    "while polydimethylaminopyrrole belongs to the same category ( chains of five - membered rings ) as the previously proposed polyaminotriazole@xcite which has theoretically shown to realize the flat - band ferromagnetism@xcite , we suggest that the present magnetic instability can be related to the mechanism proposed by batista _ et al._@xcite based on the periodic anderson model .",
    "realization of ferromagnetism is not yet sufficient , because the total energies of the ferromagnetic state and antiferromagnetic state is almost degenerate in gga - sdft calculations .",
    "diagonalizations of the model hamiltonians constructed from the band structure do not show ferromagnetic ground states , either .",
    "since this comes from the smallness of the hybridization @xmath13 between the flat band and the dispersive band , we can conversely predict that ferromagnetism will be stabilized if we can increase @xmath13 . in the present material @xmath13",
    "is determined mainly by @xmath0-bonding between the nitrogen atom in the amino base and the nitrogen atom in the five membered ring . in dimethylaminopyrrole",
    ", @xmath13 is very small because the angle between the two @xmath0-orbitals is nearly 90 degrees .",
    "therefore , @xmath13 can be increased if this angle is decreased by replacing dimethylamino base with another base .",
    "note that reducing the angle to 0 would be excessive because that is the same as the case of aminotriazole whose electronic state applies to the mechanism of flat - band ferromagnetism rather than periodic anderson model .",
    "so the present work gives an interesting case of material design where control of the parameters of electronic states has lead to a different mechanism for the many - body effects , namely _ organic periodic anderson model _ and associated ferromagnetism .",
    "an important future problem is whether the sdft calculations can capture the ferromagnetism _  la _ batista .",
    "another future problem is how the present concept of the organic periodic anderson model can be extended to wider materials beyond those considered here .",
    "studying inter - oligomer couplings will also be important for examining ferromagnetic materials .",
    "as for the doping the material , we can consider various chemical dopants as discussed for in ref .",
    "we would like to thank hiroshi nishihara , yoshinori yamanoi and norikazu ohshima for extensive discussions on the chemistry of polymers and oligomers , and also for the collaboration in fabricating the materials .",
