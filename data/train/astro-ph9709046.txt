    "in any cdm or @xmath15  cosmology , the first generation of stars is expected to form at redshifts 1030 in small ( @xmath16 ) bound objects and is assumed to imprint the intergalactic medium by both enriching and ionizing it .",
    "this enrichment may now have been detected in keck spectra of the lyman forest ( cowie et al .",
    "1995 ; tytler et al .  1995 ; songaila & cowie 1996 [ sc96 ] ) , and various attempts have been made to use the first crude measurements of the forest metallicity ( sc96 ; haehnelt , steinmetz , & rauch 1996 ; rauch , haehnelt & steinmetz 1997 ) to place upper limits on the amount of early star formation in small galaxies ( sc96 ; miralda - escud & rees 1997 ; gnedin & ostriker 1997 ; haiman & loeb 1997 ) and to infer the rate of the high redshift type  ii supernovae that may be our best hope of detecting objects in these early stages of the galaxy formation era ( miralda - escud & rees 1997 ) .",
    "the critical quantity for normalizing the amount of early star formation is the density of metals at early epochs .",
    "this has generally been obtained ( e.g. miralda - escud & rees 1997 ; haiman & loeb 1997 ) by combining the rough estimates of metallicity in forest clouds with the total baryon density ( @xmath17 ) inferred from big bang nucleosynthesis ( sbbn ) .",
    "apart from the uncertainty in the value of @xmath17  from sbbn , this methodology assumes a uniform enrichment of metals in the igm and also entails considerable uncertainty in the determination of individual cloud metallicities caused by poorly known ionization corrections and abundance patterns in the heavy elements .",
    "it is possible to avoid many of these problems by directly integrating the observed ion column densities in the forest clouds to obtain @xmath18  and , within plausible limits , @xmath19 .",
    "carbon and silicon are both well suited to this approach : as discussed below , their dominant ionization stages in the igm are and , strong doublets that are easy to find and measure with 10 m class telescopes (  [ obs ] ) ; they both have strong accessible lines in other ionization stages with which to assess ionization corrections (  [ ion ] ) ; and the ratio of @xmath12-process silicon to fe - coproduction carbon is useful for determining the abundance pattern at early epochs and to give some idea of the nature of the initial mass function (  [ discuss ] ) .",
    "letter _ reports the results of such a direct integration .",
    "the data used comprises high resolution observations of eleven quasars with @xmath20  made with the hires spectrograph on the keck i telescope , for a variety of programs , between 1994 november and 1997 april .",
    "all spectra have a resolution @xmath21  and have variable wavelength coverage in the range @xmath22 .",
    "full details of the extraction and processing of these spectra are given in a companion paper ( songaila 1997 ) .",
    "seven of the spectra have complete wavelength coverage between the quasar s",
    "@xmath2  and emission lines , whereas the remainder have only partial coverage redward of @xmath2  emission or have remaining inter - order gaps from hires s incomplete coverage above @xmath23 .",
    "the sample used to construct the column density distribution consists of all doublets detected redward of @xmath2  emission in those spectra with complete coverage .",
    "the doublets were found by inspection of the spectra , and confirmed by consistency of the column density and velocity structure in the two members of the doublet .",
    "systems within @xmath24  of the quasar s emission redshift were excluded from the sample to avoid including proximate systems which have ion ratios dominated by photoionization from the quasars themselves .",
    "also excluded were 10 specifically targeted partial lyman limit systems ( plls ) in 9 quasars that were chosen to be observed in a program to look for suitable systems in which to measure the primordial ratio of deuterium to hydrogen .",
    "the final sample consists of 81 doublets , with @xmath25  and @xmath26 , free from proximity or observational selection bias .",
    "the column density distribution was similarly determined from all doublets detected in the same subsample of quasar spectra as used for the distribution .",
    "only systems blueward of the quasars rest - frame but redward of the lyman forest were included , again excluding proximate systems and targeted plls .",
    "this resulted in 35 systems in seven lines of sight between @xmath27  and @xmath28 , with @xmath29 .    in all cases ,",
    "ion column densities were determined by fitting up to ten voigt profiles to each redshift system , defined in this context to be all absorption near a given fiducial redshift with gaps in velocity space of no more than @xmath30 .",
    "the column density at a given redshift is then the total column density of all such components . in all but a few systems ,",
    "individual lines were unsaturated , so fitted column densities are insensitive to @xmath31-value .    with these samples , the column density distribution function @xmath32  was determined for each ion .",
    "@xmath32  is defined as the number of absorbing systems per unit redshift path per unit column density , where at a given redshift @xmath33  the redshift path , @xmath34 , is defined as @xmath35 $ ]  for @xmath36  or by @xmath37 $ ]  for @xmath38 ( tytler 1982 ) .",
    "the and distribution functions are shown in figure  1 , over the redshift ranges , @xmath39and @xmath40  for , and @xmath41  and @xmath42  for .",
    "the data were calculated with @xmath36  and are plotted with @xmath9  error bars calculated from the poisson errors based on the number of systems in each bin .",
    "because of the somewhat heterogeneous nature of the parent observations , the signal - to - noise of the final sample is quite variable , in some cases because the low quasar emission redshift entailed observing below @xmath43  where the ccd efficiency dropoff is quite severe , in others because of variable coverage at the red end of the spectrum to fill in inter - order gaps .",
    "exposure times were also variable for the usual observational reasons .",
    "the amount of incompleteness at low column density was assessed by recalculating the column density distributions using only systems drawn from the highest signal - to - noise spectrum , toward q1422 + 231 , which has an exposure time of 580 minutes and reaches a @xmath9  limiting column density of @xmath44  for and @xmath45  for for @xmath46 . comparing this with the distributions obtained from the full sample",
    ", it is found that the turnover at low column density ( @xmath47 ) in the full sample is almost entirely a result of incompleteness . to take this into account",
    ", power laws were fitted only above @xmath48  for and @xmath49  for , with best - fit indices of @xmath50  for both low and high redshift , and @xmath51  for low redshift and @xmath52  for high redshift .",
    "these values are quite similar to those measured in in the forest at these redshifts ( petitjean et al .  1993 ; hu et al .",
    "1995 ; kim et al .",
    "1997 ) and in higher column density samples ( petitjean & bergeron 1994 ) .    @xmath53  and @xmath54  were calculated from the column density distributions of figure  1 according to @xmath55 where @xmath56  is the cosmological closure density , @xmath57  is the ion s mass , and @xmath58 ( e.g. , lanzetta et al .",
    "values of @xmath53  and @xmath54  were calulated for @xmath59  in individual lines of sight to the five quasars in the sample with @xmath60  and complete spectral coverage between the quasar s",
    "@xmath2  and emission lines .",
    "the results are tabulated in table  [ tbl:1 ] for @xmath61  and @xmath62  ( @xmath63  scales as @xmath64^{1/2}$ ] ) and give some idea of the uncertainty in calculating @xmath63 .",
    "formal mean values , weighted by @xmath65 , are @xmath66^{1/2}$ ]  and @xmath67^{1/2}$ ] , where the errors are @xmath9 .",
    "the mean redshift of the sample is @xmath68 .",
    "a similar procedure applied to the @xmath69 systems gives @xmath70^{1/2}$ ] and @xmath71^{1/2}$ ] at @xmath72 .    because of the rarity of high column density systems ( @xmath73 ) considerably longer",
    "path lengths are required to determine the number density of such systems , and the present data measure @xmath18  only for absorption with column density less than this value .",
    "( this corresponds roughly to @xmath74 , from sc96 . )",
    "the metal densities of the stronger systems are addressed in a companion paper ( songaila 1997 ) .",
    "the contribution of systems to @xmath75  and @xmath54  converges at the low column density end , and systems weaker than those observed will not contribute significantly to the density unless there is a very rapid upturn below the observed range .",
    "a less restricted sample was used to assess the ionization balance correction to be applied to the and sample .",
    "this was drawn from the full set of eleven quasar spectra , excluding proximate systems . in cases where there was no apparent absorption at the redshift in the other ionic species , an upper limit to the absorption in other ions",
    "was found by formally fitting the component model to the local continuum .",
    "this approach results in conservative upper limits , especially to lower ionization species , since absorption is likely to be more widespread in velocity space than lower ionization absorption .    as is shown in figure  2 ,",
    "is a trace ion relative to with nearly all systems having @xmath76  0.1  .",
    "an additional direct search in the spectra for systems with no strong yielded no additional systems . for photoionization models ,",
    "this in turn yields a high photoionization parameter ( @xmath77 ) which , for a wide range of photoionizing spectra , implies that @xmath78 and @xmath78 ( e.g. , steidel 1990 ; giroux & shull 1997 ) . for this",
    "can be directly verified from observations ( middle panel of figure  2 ) which show that , even with @xmath2  forest contamination , the upper limits on the column density are generally compatible with measurements .",
    "ionization by a starburst galaxy spectrum with no high energy photons could result in a much higher ratio of to while maintaining the low / and / ratios , but it would also produce much in excess of , which is not observed : at @xmath79  / has an average value of about 0.2 ( sc96 ; songaila 1997 ) .    finally , neither nor is strong in the -selected systems .",
    "the right panel of figure  2 shows that @xmath80 0.05 in the small number of systems measured .",
    "the high observed ratio of to combined with the low observed values of / and / suggests that forest clouds at @xmath59  are ionized by a broken power low spectrum with relatively few high energy photons and that it is unlikely that there is much material above the and levels ( sc96 ; giroux & shull 1997 ) . the best guess , therefore , would give @xmath81  and @xmath82  in these clouds .",
    "converting @xmath83  and @xmath84  to the @xmath19  of all metals requires an assumption of an abundance pattern in the @xmath59  forest . as in the old metal - poor halo stars ,",
    "silicon is overabundant with respect to carbon relative to solar .",
    "however , assuming that the carbon and silicon abundances trace the universal abundances of iron coproduction and @xmath12-process elements , respectively ( e.g. , timmes , lauroesch , & truran 1995 ) , then for the fe - coproduction elements ( c , n , fe ) , @xmath85 , and for the @xmath12-process elements ( o , ne , si , mg , s ) , @xmath86 , and setting @xmath87 and @xmath88 gives @xmath89^{1/2}$ ] ( relative abundances from anders & grevesse 1989 ) . assuming a value of @xmath17  from sbbn of @xmath90  ( songaila , wampler , & cowie 1997 ) gives @xmath91^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "with @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and a solar metallicity of 0.019 , this implies a minimum universal metallicity relative to solar , at @xmath92 , in the range [ @xmath93 to [ @xmath94 .",
    "( the value of @xmath95  given in tytler , fan & burles ( 1996 ) has now been revised upwards to @xmath96  ( tytler 1997 ) which would imply @xmath97  and a metallicity of [ @xmath93 , while the value of @xmath98  obtained by webb et al.(1997 ) would give a metallicity of [ @xmath99 [ @xmath100 . )",
    "this is a minimum range of metallicity since there may be additional metals in higher column density clouds or galaxies as well as in ionization states that were not sampled by these observations .",
    "furthermore , adoption of @xmath38 would roughly double the metallicity .",
    "however , much of @xmath17  inferred from sbbn is believed to reside in the forest clouds at this time ( rauch et al .",
    "1997 ; kim et al .  1997 ) , suggesting that this calculated metal density should be a good estimate of the total metals .",
    "interestingly , since a metallicity of @xmath101  gives rise to one ionizing photon per baryon ( e.g. , miralda - escud & rees 1997 ) , the metallicity measured here is just sufficient to preionize the igm .",
    "however , this metallicity range is substantially lower than the value of @xmath102  assumed by miralda - escud & rees ( 1997 ) and haiman & loeb ( 1997 ) and implies that their predicted rate of very high-@xmath33  type - ii supernovae could be lowered by as much as an order of magnitude , to a value of around 1 sn per 10 arcmin@xmath103  per year .",
    "i am grateful to the many people at the keck telescopes who made these observations possible , and to len cowie and esther hu for obtaining some of the observations on which this work is based .",
