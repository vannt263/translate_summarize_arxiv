    "recently , we have developed accurate numerical schemes to handle the `` inverse '' problem , that is how to retrieve the imaginary part of a physical quantity ( e.g. , a cross section , or a form factor in the time - like region ) using data for its real or the reactive part ( usually in the space like region)@xcite .",
    "figure 1 : values of @xmath0 ( light gray band ) obtained from the integral equation with five spin 1/2 quarks in the interval @xmath5 $ ] of @xmath6 .",
    "figure 2 : values of @xmath0 ( light gray band ) obtained from the integral equation with five spin 1/2 quarks plus one scalar quark .",
    "it has been reviewed at this conference by s. pacetti ( see his contribution t20 ) , and its applications to the nucleon form factor have been discussed . here these techniques have been applied to three following problems .",
    "the purpose of this analysis is to once again focus on a long standing discrepancy between data from crystal ball @xcite and mark i @xcite in the energy region @xmath1 .",
    "to arrive at a model independent answer to this problem we have applied the following procedure ( for details we refer the reader to @xcite ) .",
    "we write a dispersion relation for the derivative of the polarization tensor @xmath8 whose imaginary part is proportional to @xmath0 . as input , we use all available data for @xmath0 from outside the disputed region and for its asymptotic part contributions from the five light quark flavors .",
    "we then solve the integral equation for @xmath0 in the disputed region .",
    "as shown in fig.(1 ) , very good agreement is found with the cb data .",
    "this implies that some additional contribution to the asymptotic behavior is mandatory to reproduce the mark i data . as shown in fig.(2 ) , we find that a low mass , spin zero quark of charge @xmath9 is quite adequate for this purpose .",
    "it is worthwhile to point out that it is not inconceivable for the cb data to be consistent with the mark i data given their different selection criteria for what constituted @xmath0 .",
    "if one inquires into the selection criteria for @xmath0 in the cb data , one is struck by the remarkable fact that in it only two jet ( @xmath10 ) events were included .",
    "more precisely , all events with more than 20% imbalance in energy between forward - backward , left - right and up - down hemispheres were discarded .",
    "were there any decays from beyond that of the simple ( @xmath10 ) type , they were not counted .",
    "mark i had imposed no such restriction .    given the importance consequences for the standard model that it entails",
    ", we stress upon the necessity of an independent measurement of @xmath11 in this region .",
    "one possibility is through the radiative technique at @xmath12 machines@xcite .",
    "several authors have noted that the perturbative @xmath13 has the wrong analyticity@xcite .",
    "e.g. , the 1-loop af formula @xmath14 has a pole at space - like value @xmath15 .",
    "higher loops suffer from the same disease .",
    "of course , analyticity derived from unitarity forbids any singularity for space like @xmath6 ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "several cures for the above have been suggested .",
    "for example , in @xcite the imaginary part for @xmath2 computed from af @xmath17 is used in an unsubtracted dispersion relation ( which converges thanks to the behavior @xmath18 in the asymptotic region ) to compute the real part .",
    "thus , one has @xmath19.\\eqno(3)\\ ] ] the second term cancels the unwanted pole .",
    "this procedure has been generalized upto 3-loops . an added curiosity : @xmath20 ,",
    "is finite and universal to all loops .",
    "so why not stop here ?",
    "the lacuna is that @xmath21 is too tame ; has not enough `` oomph '' to produce all what qcd is advertised to possess .",
    "that is , to obtain , confinement of quarks and glue , infinite number of regge trajectories , etc .",
    "etc . , one would then have to add - in an ad hoc fashion - a confining potential to produce a reasonable hadronic spectrum .",
    "e.g. , on the lattice , where the wilson area law is imposed automatically and thereby confinement , so there @xmath22 constant or even zero .",
    "parenthetically , the embarrassment on the lattice is that the same prescription leads to a linear potential @xmath23 rather than @xmath24 for qed .",
    "a different analytic model is due to nesterenko@xcite , where the af pole is eliminated multiplicatively : @xmath25.\\eqno(4)\\ ] ] here @xmath26 increases as @xmath6 goes to zero .",
    "the problem with this model is that it is `` too singular '' , so that integrals ( such as those needed for soft gluon summations @xcite ) @xmath27 are not convergent .",
    "taking our cue from the above , we have developed the following general strategy to develop a whole class of models for an analytic @xmath28 - with 1 and 2 as special cases .",
    "a simpler function to disperse is ( @xmath29 ) , which provides much physical insight .",
    "let us recall that the vacuum coulomb potential is modified in the following way for charged particles in a medium @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the dielectric constant of the material .",
    "hence , we shall consider @xmath32 e.g. , in the af case , its imaginary part is much simpler , a constant @xmath33 we write a subtracted dispersion relation for @xmath31 @xmath34 in eq.(9 ) , confinement is easily imposed . here",
    ", confinement means @xmath35 using eq.(8 ) as the asymptotic limit from af for @xmath36 , we have a general class of models consistent with af and confinement provided by [ fig.(3 ) ] @xmath37 the model in @xcite is obtained for @xmath38 .",
    "+ we have considered two applications : 1 .",
    "@xmath3 decay , fig.(4 ) ; 2 . hadronic transverse momentum distributions in w and z decays . for @xmath39",
    ", af analysis requires a large @xmath40 . for values of @xmath41 ,",
    "on the other hand , we obtain a much more reasonable value for @xmath42 to get agreement with the data .    regarding the transverse momentum distribution broadening due to soft gluon summations , we reproduce previous phenomenological results @xcite for values of @xmath43 in the same range . both these applications",
    "lead us to conclude that the dispersive method is indeed capable of joining af with confinement in a suitable way .",
    "figure 3 : values of @xmath44 space - like obtained by integrating the dispersion relation ( 9 ) with the imaginary part ( 11 ) for @xmath45 ( lower curve ) , @xmath46 ( higher curve ) ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "figure 4 : @xmath48 , obtained with different values of @xmath43 and @xmath49 , compared with its experimental value ( gray band ) .",
    "in the previous section , we imposed confinement along with af . here",
    "we discuss further results of some importance regarding the nature of confinement itself through a vacuum instability induced by af .",
    "the 1-loop result for @xmath36 may be decomposed into its quark and glue pieces as @xmath50 with @xmath51 ( for @xmath52 ) , @xmath53 and @xmath54 . + in qed on the other hand ,",
    "only charged particles contribute and the sign in eq.(12 ) is reversed .",
    "( the `` price '' for it is the landau ghost absent in qcd ) .    in qed",
    ", this positive sign is necessary for stability , since @xmath31 is related to the conductivity @xmath55 @xmath56 thus , for example , for ohm s law to work , there must be dissipation , i.e. , @xmath57 .",
    "for such `` normal '' systems , it is usual to define a noise temperature @xmath58 which is positive .",
    "what if the sign is reversed ? then the system is not dissipative instead is an `` amplifier '' for which , the noise temperature @xmath59 .",
    "the notion of a noise temperature may be appreciated by considering a system with two energy levels @xmath60 .",
    "the probability ratio for finding the state with these energies is given by @xmath61 thus , we see that the `` normal '' situation is for @xmath62 whereas the `` amplifier '' case has @xmath59 .",
    "an artificially pumped system such as a maser or a spin system has @xmath59 .",
    "but such a system is * unstable*. we have shown elsewhere that such systems exhibit a klein paradox for photons@xcite .    turning to qcd then ,",
    "since the perturbative ground state has @xmath63 , we conclude that such a system is unstable .",
    "this is a pleasing physical result since it implies that the perturbative ground state containing free quarks and glue is an excited ( higher energy ) state whereas the states of lower energy containing the hadrons must be the true ground state of qcd .",
