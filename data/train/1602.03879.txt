    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are the most luminous explosions in the universe , which mark ultra - relativistic jets launched from new - born stellar mass black holes that beam towards earth @xcite .",
    "blazars are moderately relativistic jets launched from super - massive black holes towards earth @xcite .",
    "the energy composition of these relativistic jets , which is still in debate , is a fundamental property that defines the subsequent energy dissipation process , particle acceleration mechanism , and radiation mechanism , which are directly connected to the observational properties such as light curves , spectra , and polarization characteristics .",
    "an important parameter to classify relativistic jets is the magnetization parameter , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the specific enthalpy defined in the fluid rest frame , @xmath5 is the rest mass density , @xmath6 is the gas pressure , @xmath7 is the adiabatic index , and @xmath8 is the emf energy density calculated by @xmath9 in the fluid rest frame of each simulation cell . a jet is matter - flux - dominated ( mfd ) when @xmath10 @xcite , and is poynting - flux - dominated ( pfd ) when @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "recently , evidence suggesting that at least some grbs may be produced through magnetic dissipation within moderately pfd jets has been accumulated , including the weak or the lack of bright thermal emission in the spectra of most grbs @xcite , linearly polarized emission with high polarization degree ( pd ) in both grb prompt emission @xcite and early optical afterglow @xcite , as well as the lack of associated high - energy neutrinos with grbs @xcite . in the blazar field , polarized optical emission has been commonly observed @xcite .",
    "a connection between blazar jets and grb jets has been established through several observational correlations @xcite .",
    "theoretically , a possible connection between jets in different scales has been proposed @xcite , but no detailed studies have been carried out to show that the same physical model can account for the observational data in both grbs and blazars .    within the context of grbs , @xcite suggested that collision - induced magnetic reconnection and turbulence ( icmart ) can be an efficient mechanism to dissipate energy in a moderately pfd outflow , and the model can overcome some difficulties in the traditional internal shock models and account for many grb observations .",
    "recently , we @xcite carried out the first detailed numerical study on collision - induced magnetic dissipation , and demonstrated that such processes can indeed dissipate magnetic energy with a high efficiency , and that local , relativistically - boosted regions due to high-@xmath12 reconnections can indeed form , which mimic the so - called `` mini - jets '' invoked in interpreting the rapid variabilities in grbs @xcite and blazars @xcite .",
    "it is then encouraging to extend our numerical model to study radiation from the jets , and directly compare the model results with observations .    in this paper , we study radiation properties of jets based on our 3d relativistic mhd numerical simulations of collision - induced magnetic dissipation model @xcite , paying special attention to the polarization properties of the jets .",
    "the observational motivations include the detection of high - degree of linear polarization as well as a @xmath1 polarization angle ( pa ) change between two major flares in the prompt @xmath0-ray emission phase of grb 100826a @xcite , and the detections of a @xmath2 pa swing during strong flaring emission in some blazar sources , especially 3c279 @xcite .",
    "several models @xcite have been proposed to interpret these phenomena within the grb context or blazar context , respectively , but these models introduce very different assumptions , so that there is no unified understanding to the phenomena .",
    "the 3d special relativistic mhd ( srmhd ) code , that we are using here , is named as  la - compass \" @xcite which was first developed at los alamos national laboratory .",
    "it uses the higher - order godunov - type finite - volume methods to solve the ideal mhd equations as following : @xmath13 = 0 , \\\\ & \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}(\\gamma^2 h - p-\\gamma \\rho c^2 + \\frac{b^2+e^2}{8 \\pi } ) \\nonumber \\\\ & + \\nabla \\cdot[(\\gamma^2 h-\\gamma \\rho c^2){\\mbox{\\boldmath $ v$ } } + \\frac{c}{4 \\pi}{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ e$}}\\times { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ b$}}]=0,\\\\ & \\frac{\\partial { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ b$}}}{\\partial t}+ c \\nabla \\times { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ e$}}=0,\\\\ & { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ e$}}=-\\frac{{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ v$}}}{c}\\times { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ b$}},\\\\ & p=(\\hat{\\gamma}-1)u,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are the vectors of magnetic field , electric field , and fluid velocity , respectively , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the lorentz factor and internal energy density , respectively ( see more in @xcite ) .",
    "we set up the two - blob collision problem similar to @xcite .",
    "we consider that the black hole central engine of a grb or a blazar launches a pfd jet with both toroidal and poloidal magnetic field components .",
    "the jets are episodic , probably due to variations of the accretion rate , intrinsic episodic magnetic activities from the accretion disk @xcite , or current - driven kink instabilities during jet propagation @xcite , forming discrete high-@xmath12 blobs with both toroidal and poloidal field components @xcite .",
    "the collisions between the two blobs lead to discharge of magnetic energy through reconnection @xcite , which lead to efficient particle acceleration @xcite and synchrotron radiation .",
    "we simulate the collisions in the jet co - moving frame , which is the center of mass frame of the two blobs .",
    "the magnetic field configuration of each magnetic blob is initialized using the model from @xcite .",
    "we introduce the equations in the cylindrical coordinates @xmath19 first , and then transfer them to the cartesian coordinates in our simulations . from the center ( @xmath20 ) of each blob , the field is assumed to be axisymmetric with the @xmath21 and @xmath22 components of the poloidal field : @xmath23 and @xmath24 where , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the normalization factor for the magnetic strength and the characteristic radius of the magnetic blob , respectively .",
    "the poloidal field is closed , which keeps the net global poloidal flux zero .",
    "the toroidal field configuration is motivated by the consideration of a rapidly rotating central engine , whose spin shears the poloidal flux to form the toroidal flux .",
    "it has the form @xmath27 where the parameter @xmath28 controls the toroidal - to - poloidal flux ratio . in our simulation",
    ", we set @xmath29 , which suggests that the two flux components are roughly equal to each other @xcite .    the initial conditions for the grb and blazar simulations are presented in table [ tab : para ] .",
    "the simulation box size is 10@xmath30 @xmath31 10@xmath30 @xmath31 10@xmath30 for the grb case , and 10@xmath30 @xmath31 10@xmath30 @xmath31 20@xmath30 for the blazar case .",
    "the total simulation time is 160@xmath32 for both cases .",
    "we also assume a co - moving observer in the x - axis direction , and a bulk motion along the @xmath33-axis .",
    "the bulk lorentz factor is set to 300 for the grb case and 20 for the blazar case , respectively . from the mhd simulations",
    ", we can roughly estimate the observed luminosity assuming that the radiation is isotropic in the jet comoving frame .",
    "for the grb case , the average observed luminosity from 0 to 100 seconds is @xmath34ergs / s@xmath35ergs / s ; for the blazar case , the average observed luminosity from 0 to 20 days is @xmath36ergs / s@xmath37ergs / s .",

    "figure [ fig : power_combo ] shows two cuts of the @xmath46 evolution and the corresponding zoom - in magnetic field line configuration for the grb and blazar cases , respectively .",
    "the collision - induced magnetic reconnection happens in the contact area of the two blobs around the middle plane ( @xmath47 ) , where the magnetic energy dissipation mainly concentrates .",
    "based on the distribution of the negative @xmath46 value , we define a reconnection region ( inner black rectangle box ) which is the major magnetic energy release region to produce strong flaring emission for grb prompt emission and blazar flares .",
    "we also define a background region ( outer black rectangle boxes ) which contributes to the background emission .",
    "the magnetic field topology in the strong dissipation region evolves significantly between the two snapshots for both cases .    in each time step and each simulation cell with negative @xmath46 value ,",
    "we inject non - thermal electrons with certain power - law distribution as follows : @xmath48 for the grb jet @xcite , and @xmath49 for the blazar jet @xcite . in the reconnection region , the normalization factor @xmath50",
    "is calculated with the assumption that the injected particle energy rate is about half of the @xmath46 values . in the background region , on the other hand , @xmath50 is set to be uniform and normalized to the background emission level from the observations .",
    "the minimum lorentz factor @xmath51 is set to @xmath52 for the grb case to roughly match the observed peak energy ( @xmath53 ) of grb 100826a @xcite .",
    "next , we use a 3d multi - zone polarization - dependent ray - tracing radiation code @xcite named  3dpol \" to calculate the detailed radiation and polarization evolution properties based on the mhd simulations .",
    "3dpol \" code takes magnetic field and particle population as inputs , and calculates stokes parameters at each spatial point . by adding up the polarized signals that arrive at the observer at the same time",
    ", the time - dependent pd and pa can be calculated .",
    "this code performs full 3d calculations of the polarization properties by taking into account detailed radiation and polarization transfer , light travel time effects , and time- , space- and frequency dependencies .",
    "our results and the referenced observations are shown in fig . [",
    "fig : pol_grb ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : pol_blazar ] for the grb and blazar cases , respectively . for the grb case ,",
    "the simulated light curve shows multiple global pulses ( corresponding to the `` slow '' component of grb emission @xcite ) , which is similar to the observations .",
    "the simulated pa on average rotates by @xmath1 between the two intervals of the light curves , which matches the observation quite well .",
    "in addition , the calculated pd also shows an increasing trend between the two intervals , consistent with the observations . for the blazar case",
    ", our results also match the observations well .",
    "in particular , the following three key features are reproduced : 1 .",
    "the pa shows a @xmath2 angle swing ; 2 .",
    "the pd nearly drops to zero around the flare s peak time ( around @xmath54 days ) ; 3 . in the light curve ,",
    "the background level after the flare is much lower than it was before the flare .",
    "our results can be understood in terms of the magnetic field configuration evolution during the collision processes .",
    "since we assume that the observer views the system from the @xmath42-axis in the jet co - moving frame ( the @xmath55 cone direction in the observer frame ) , only the radiation power from the @xmath56 and @xmath57 components contribute to the observed emission .",
    "the pa is roughly controlled by the dominant component of these two components , and the pd is related to the relative ratio between them . since we inject the same energy distribution of non - thermal electrons in each cell , the synchrotron radiation powers of the two components in a certain region are related to @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively , where @xmath60 is the total number of cells in this region , with @xmath50 introduced in equations [ eq : ele_dist_grb ] and [ eq : ele_dist_blazar ] .",
    "figure [ fig : power_evo_combo ] shows the evolution of the above two quantities for both cases .",
    "the final results should be controlled by the superposition ( solid lines ) from both the reconnection ( dash - dotted lines ) and background ( dotted lines ) regions . for the grb case ( left panel ) , the observation @xcite shows a low level of the background emission , so we inject a small amount of non - thermal particles in the background region .",
    "therefore , the radiation is dominated by the reconnection region . in this panel",
    ", there are two major power release intervals .",
    "the first one forms during the initial collision - induced strong magnetic reconnection process . due to the small misalignment ( @xmath41 ) and high-@xmath12 environment , the blobs bounce back significantly .",
    "this process temporally suppresses energy release due to reconnection .",
    "after that , the imbalance due to the small misalignment is gradually built up , which triggers the later strong reconnection again to produce the second major flare ( see detailed analysis of this process in section 4.2 and figure 12 in @xcite ) .",
    "this episodic power release process gives the multiple global pulses . on the other hand , the dominant component in the reconnection region switches from the @xmath57-dominated radiation to the @xmath56-dominated radiation between the two intervals , which is mainly due to the magnetic reconnection that reconnects the @xmath57 component to form the @xmath56 component gradually",
    "this is the main reason to cause the @xmath1 pa change as observed .    for the blazar case ( right panel ) ,",
    "the observation @xcite shows a relatively high level of background emission , so we inject more non - thermal particles in the background region to mimic the observation .",
    "therefore , the superposition of the statistical quantities from the two regions is different from the grb case . from the light curve point of view , due to the larger misalignment and moderate-@xmath12 adopted in the simulation , the bouncing effect is relatively weak and more significant rotation is triggered , so that power release is relatively continuous in the reconnection region which gives rise to a single major flare in the light curve .",
    "the systematical decay of the magnetic field strength during the reconnection dissipation process causes the continuous decay of the background power release , which can explain the observed significantly lower level of the background emission after the flare than before . from the pa point of view , during the flare , the reconnection changes the dominant radiation component from @xmath57 to @xmath56 gradually .",
    "however at the late stage of the flare , @xmath56 domination becomes weaker and is even surpassed by the @xmath57 component again .",
    "this is mainly due to the relatively faster rotation caused by the larger misalignment , which rotates the system more than @xmath61 at the late stage .",
    "so @xmath56 becomes less dominating in the rotation co - moving frame , or even turns into @xmath57 domination for the fixed observer in the simulation frame .",
    "this double switching of the dominant component in the reconnection region causes the @xmath2 pa swing . from the pd point of view",
    ", the background contribution which is mainly @xmath57 dominant for this case is relatively high , so that the @xmath56 dominated emission from the reconnection region around the peak stage of the flare is nearly balanced by the @xmath57 dominated background emission .",
    "therefore , the pd nearly drops to zero around the flare s peak time ( around @xmath54 days ) .",
    "we note that besides this representative case , many other blazars show significant pa swing along with relatively strong flare(s ) @xcite , which can be also potentially interpreted with our model .",
    "in realty , different grb and blazar events may have different parameters ( e.g. @xmath12 , @xmath28 , @xmath41 etc . ) , or even different global magnetic field structures . based on our study",
    ", we find that as long as the change of magnetic field topology is mainly due to the magnetic reconnection process within a single global reconnection location , the dominant magnetic field component would switch and give a significant ( e.g. @xmath1 ) pa change . for more complicated cases involving multiple blobs colliding and triggering many global reconnection events consecutively , the polarization evolution would be more complicated .",
    "in summary , using mhd simulations , we are able to evolve the magnetic field topology of the grb and blazer systems self - consistently by fully taking into account the collision - induced reconnection and rotation effect due to mis - alignment . the unified interpretation of the polarization properties of both grbs and blazars suggest that similar underlying physics is in operation in black hole relativistic jet systems . in particular , collision - induced magnetic reconnection may hold the key to understand a variety of phenomenology .",
