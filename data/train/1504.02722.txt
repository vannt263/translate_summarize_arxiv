    ", monochromatic plane - wave laser field has been analyzed in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "as lasers field are naturally produced with linear polarization and the hightest intensities can only be achieved by using short laser pulses , it is desirable to generalize these results accordingly . in the present paper",
    "we will therefore consider a plane - wave laser field with arbitrary polarization and pulse shape",
    ".    inside plane - wave laser fields the probability for a neutrino process depends primarily on the laser intensity and the neutrino energy .",
    "a convenient gauge- and lorentz - invariant measure for the laser field strength is given by the parameter @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the electric field amplitude and @xmath4 the central angular frequency of the laser ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote the electron charge and mass , respectively ) .",
    "in the regime @xmath7 the interaction between the background field and the electron and the positron , must be taken into account exactly by solving the dirac equation in the presence of the background field @xcite .",
    "for a plane - wave field this is possible analytically and one obtains the volkov states as single - particle states @xcite . working in momentum space , the only necessary modification of the feynman rules is the replacement of the free vertex by the so - called dressed vertex ( i.e. @xmath8 for qed ; see app.0.20em[sec : dressedvertexappendix ] and e.g. @xcite for more details ) . unlike in vacuum , four - momentum is conserved only up to a multiple of the laser four - momentum at the dressed vertex , which changes the kinematics of the processes .",
    "it is well known that for @xmath9 the formation region for single - vertex processes primed by the laser field is much smaller than the laser wavelength , such that the local constant - crossed field approximation is applicable @xcite .",
    "therefore , the case of a constant - crossed background field ( studied e.g. in @xcite ) is particularly interesting and provides the order of magnitude for the expected probabilities . inside a constant - crossed field the probability depends nontrivially only on the quantum - nonlinearity parameter @xmath10 , where @xmath11 denotes the energy of the incoming neutrino and @xmath12{v}{cm}$ ] the critical field strength of qed @xcite ( the expression of @xmath13 given here assumes a head - on collision and neglects the neutrino mass ) .    as the nonlinear - quantum parameter is inversely proportional to the cube of the electron ( positron ) mass ( @xmath14 ) , nonlinear quantum effects caused by muon or tau leptons are strongly suppressed for reasonable parameters and ignored here .",
    "correspondingly , the symmetry between different lepton generations is broken and the gim mechanism does not apply . furthermore , the laser provides additional energy and momentum to the reaction , which enlarges the available phase space . due to these two reasons the probability for photon emission by neutrinos inside a plane - wave field is strongly enhanced in comparison with the vacuum case ( note that the laser field also affects tree - level processes like the decay of a muon @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , since the enhancement is primed by an electromagnetic exchange of photons between an electron / positron loop and the laser , we expect that the probabilities for nonlinear neutrino processes inside laser fields still contain the suppression factor @xmath15 and an experimental observation is challenging ( @xmath16{gev}$ ] and @xmath17{gev}$ ] denote the mass of the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 boson , respectively @xcite ) .    by combining accelerator - based neutrino beams with energies in the gev range @xcite with strong optical lasers ( @xmath18 ) @xcite ,",
