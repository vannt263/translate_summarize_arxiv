    "( e.g. @xmath103 ) the growth of @xmath20 at small-@xmath0 , implied by the @xmath19 terms resummation , is hidden behind the singular behaviour of @xmath93 , which survives the qcd evolution . comparing plots from fig.2 and results from the last column in table",
    "ii , one can read that the @xmath19 resummation gives steep growth of the @xmath20 in the small-@xmath0 region .",
