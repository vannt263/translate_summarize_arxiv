    "the extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields ( elf - emf ) are omnipresent in human life , being generated by common appliances electrical conductors that cross the populated areas or the walls of houses , medical devices used in the treatment of different illness , electrical cars ( used in the public transportation systems or as private cars ) and electrical trains ( underground or suburban electrical trains ) .",
    "both in the case of the medical devices ( mainly used in the physiotherapy ) and of the electrical components of the cars and trains , the common generated frequency is that of 100 hz @xcite . even though the patients or passengers are exposed for a short time , the deserving personnel are subject to prolonged exposure .",
    "also , the combined treatment of 100 hz magnetic field and x - rays has increased the survival time of hepatoma - implanted balb / c mice as compared to magnetic field or x - rays treated groups @xcite , suggesting the possible use in oncotherapy . + the exposure of different cell lines or organisms to electromagnetic fields have produced a bulk of data that were sometimes contradictory and did nt allow a concise and clear conclusion about the effects of electromagnetic fields on biological systems @xcite .",

    "+ the worrying but contradictory epidemiologic or experimental data about the possible genotoxic effects of this kind of electromagnetic fields , suggesting the possible carcinogenetic effect , requires an enrichment of the pool of experimental information and the deciphering of its action mechanisms .",
    "+ carcinogenic processes have three developmental stages : initiation , promotion and progression .",
    "the first stage , tumour initiation , begins when the dna in a cell or population of cells is damaged by exposure to exogenous or endogenous carcinogens .",
    "if this damage is not repaired , it can lead to genetic mutations .",
    "the responsiveness of the mutated cells to their microenvironment can be altered and may give them a growth advantage relative to normal cells @xcite .",
    "+ the possible carcinogenetic effect of the low frequency and intensity electromagnetic fields are still under debate , the data being controversial . studies in this field suggested that exposure to low frequency and intensity electromagnetic fields could alter the dna integrity , which could trigger the initiation of carcinogenetic processes or could accelerate the development or spreading of already present cancers @xcite .",
    "also , it was suggested that chronic exposure to the elf could be involved in the development of some neurodegenerative diseases by production of reactive oxygen species @xcite .",
    "+ contrary , other researches identified no effects on the integrity of the dna in the conditions of exposure to the electromagnetic fields @xcite .",

    "the unpowered coils presented a magnetic field with a 0.021 mt intensity , similar to the registered magnetic field background . the magnetodiaflux device delivered to the two coils a pulsating direct current ( pdc ) , obtained by converting and rectifying the 220 v/50 hz alternative current .",

    "after 48 hours , the highest percentage of cells blocked in the s phase was registered in the case of cemf followed by dcemf , as it can be seen in table [ tab3 ] .",
    "the general assumption is that extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields are nt genotoxic and do not affect the integrity of the dna molecule , but the scientific data are still controversial and supplementary evidence is necessary to consider this physical agent as a real carcinogenic factor .",
    "+ other aspects that need to be clarified are the differences either in effect or in the magnitude of the effect , in respect to the use of continuous and intermittent electromagnetic fields .",
    "ivancsits @xcite reported that intermittent electromagnetic fields caused dna damage of the human diploid fibroblasts , while continuous electromagnetic field did not alter the dna integrity .",
    "starting from this experiment , crumpton @xcite argued that supplementary data , obtained in independent experiments , concerning the biological effects of low frequency electromagnetic , is necessary , and the link between electromagnetic fields and initiation of the carcinogenesis processes has to be proved .",
    "+ the current study was designed to establish whether 100 hz extremely low - frequency electromagnetic fields affect the dna integrity in the normal vero cell line , the dna damage being assed 48 hours after the electromagnetic exposure .",
    "in addition , we have investigated if there are any significant differences between the manner of exposure of 100 hz elf ( continuous or discontinuous ) and the magnitude of the effects .",
    "the use of the comet assay is a very valuable tool in the identification of possible genotoxic effects of different agents and could offer rapid and solid evidence about the possible impairments of the dna integrity .",
    "also , this test was used extensively in a study concerning the effect of different types of electromagnetic fields upon the dna integrity @xcite . + the qualitative analysis of the comet assay showed a reduction of the frequency of cells with broken dna between 5 - 40% , but a significant increase in frequency of the cells with major impairments of the dna .",
    "the late determination of the cells status ( 48 hours after the treatment ) showed that the exposure to the electromagnetic field determined a spectrum of consequences upon the integrity of genetic material , such as damages which activated internal control systems of the cell and the restoration of the normal state of dna molecule and alterations that could nt be corrected or needing a longer time to be repaired .",
    "the activation of the repairing systems allowed the correction of the errors with a higher efficiency than in the unexposed cells . nevertheless , the increased frequency of the cells with a high degree of damaged dna indicates heterogeneity of cellular response to the electromagnetic field , depending on the cellular state in the moment of exposure .",
    "the cell cycle analysis of the exposed cells revealed a blockage of the cells in the s phase of the cell cycle , suggesting that the 100 hz elf could impair the synthetic and correction mechanisms , as was suggested by @xcite .",
    "in addition , the stop of the cells in s phase of the cell cycle suggests the formation of the single strand breaks or collapse of the dna replication forks during the s phase , under the action of the electromagnetic treatment @xcite + it is not clear whether the action of the electromagnetic fields is due to a direct or indirect effect , mediated by other mechanisms , as the production of reactive species of oxygen .",
    "some results support redox - mediated elf - emf biological effects , as a positive modulation of antioxidant defences was observed , as well as a shift of cellular environment towards a more reduced state @xcite . +",
    "our data correlates with those obtained by wolf et al .",
    "@xcite , which signalled that elf of 50 hz determined a transient blockage of the cells in the s phase of the cell cycle and suggested the implication of the presence of reactive species of oxygen .",
    "+ the data obtained by qualitative evaluation of the cells assessed by comet assay were reinforced by quantitative appreciation of the electromagnetic fields effects .",
    "all four parameters determined by us showed an increase in the tail length and the quantity of fragmented dna in the tail , tail moment and olive tail moment .",
    "the overall evaluation of our findings is that extremely low frequency electromagnetic field acts as a moderate damaging agent .",
    "they are in accordance with other studies which suggested the mild oxidative effects of extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields responsible for the dna damage @xcite .",
    "+ albeit it was signalled that the intermittent exposure showed a stronger effect in the comet assay than continuous exposure @xcite , our results did not find significant differences between the two ways of exposure .",
    "the lack of any significant differences between continuous and discontinuous exposure of the cells to elf - emf , in our experimental setup , resides in the triggering changes in the metabolic pattern of the used cells , dependent by intensity of the magnetic field and not by the frequency .",
    "the modifications induced by elf - emf to dna and their persistence are , most probably , the result of the appearance of the reactive species of oxygen and the prolongation of their lifetime extension under the influence of the magnetic field , as documented by @xcite . + the persistence of the errors , even 48 hours after the exposure , indicates a persistence of reactive oxygen species , the perturbation of the cellular apparatus implied in the verification and repairing of the dna errors and the occurrence of the ssbs in exposed cells",
