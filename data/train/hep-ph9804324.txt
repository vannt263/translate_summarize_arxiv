    "within the last decade , the most significant progress in the qcd description of hadronic physics is the discovery of heavy quark symmetry ( hqs ) @xcite , which , together with the development of heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) from qcd @xcite , has largely simplified the analysis of heavy hadron physics @xcite .",
    "however , even in the infinite quark mass limit , the general properties of heavy hadrons , namely , their decay constants , transition form factors and structure functions etc . measured in various exclusive and inclusive decay processes remain unknown in the framework of qcd .",
    "the difficulty in understanding the heavy hadronic properties essentially lie in nonperturbative qcd dynamics , but hqet itself does not provide such a description to nonperturbative qcd .",
    "lattice qcd simulations @xcite permit a nonperturbative approach to the low - energy qcd problem , but so far a direct lattice calculation with heavy quarks is still not possible due to the difficulty of placing heavy particles on the lattice .",
    "an alternative first - principles calculation of nonperturbative qcd to these heavy hadron properties is to solve the heavy meson bound states directly from light - front qcd @xcite , but to obtain reliable results , further investigations are needed .",
    "therefore , in most recent studies , these heavy hadron properties are usually evaluated using phenomenological models , such as the constituent quark model @xcite , the mit bag model@xcite , the qcd sum rule @xcite , and the light - front quark model @xcite .",
    "as is well known , although the constituent quark model ( cqm ) and the mit bag model have been widely used in the phenomenological discussion of hadronic structures , applications of these two models are trustworthy only for processes involving small momentum transfers .",
    "this is due mainly to the nonrelativistic limitation of the cqm and to the difficulty with boost in the bag model .",
    "the light - front quark model ( lfqm ) which is a relativistic quark model with simple boost kinematics allows us to describe physical processes with large momentum transfers , but it is still not truely lorentz covariant due to the exclusion of the so - called @xmath5-diagrams @xcite . as a result ,",
    "certain theoretical ambiguities arise in lfqm calculation which may lead to inconsistent results as have been shown in @xcite .",
    "to overcome the drawbacks in these phenomenological models , we recently proposed a covariant light - front model @xcite which modifies the conventional lfqm in the heavy quark limit by adding a constraint on the light - front wave function .",
    "the covariant light - front model rules out some non - covariant light - front wave function often used in the literature , and therefore partially eliminates the ambiguities presented in previous calculations .",
    "meanwhile , it also largely simplifies the light - front formulation , and may further provide a first - principles qcd analysis of the @xmath0 corrections within hqet @xcite .",
    "however , further investigation indicates that although it has overcome some theoretical difficulties encountered in the conventional light - front formulation for heavy hadrons , our covariant quark model @xcite still can not provide fully consistent results for processes involving light quark currents .",
    "this is because for those processes involving only heavy quark transitions , the @xmath5-diagram contributions are suppressed in the heavy quark limit ; however , when the light quarks ( or currents ) are involved , the non - covariant light - front treatment of light quarks ( due to lack of @xmath5-diagram contributions from the light quark production ) will still cause theoretical ambiguities .    in this paper , we will present a detailed formulation of a fully field theoretical description of heavy mesons in terms of an effective theory of composite particles we have proposed very recently@xcite .",
    "the composite particle consists of a reduced heavy quark ( heavy quark in the heavy quark limit ) coupled with the light degrees of freedom , in which a structure function of the composite particle , @xmath6 , corresponding to the wave function of a heavy meson bound state , is explicitly built in . in this field theory description ,",
    "the constituents in composite particles are no longer fixed at a given instant point of time , which is a condition imposed in the usual construction of hadronic bound states in various quark models .",
    "the field theory structure of the constituents in hadrons allows us to formulate the physical processes in terms of the standard feynman diagrams in which various time - ordering diagrams are all automatically included .",
    "therefore , the lack of @xmath5-diagrams in the usual quark model descriptions is no longer a problem in the present formulation .",
    "moreover , combining the effective lagrangian of the composite heavy mesons with the @xmath0 expansion of the heavy quark qcd lagrangian , we can systematically evaluate various @xmath0 corrections to heavy meson properties in the standard framework of perturbative field theory .",
    "thus , a self - contained description of heavy mesons ( including the bound state structure and @xmath0 corrections ) is realized in a field - theoretic framework .",
    "this effective field theory allows us to explore the nonperturbative heavy meson dynamics , which is not possible in the light - front quark models .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we will analyze the basic structure of heavy mesons in the heavy quark limit as a composite particle of the reduced heavy quark coupled with the light degrees of freedom . in sec .",
    "iii , we construct an effective lagrangian to describe the composite structure of heavy mesons and combine this effective lagrangian with hqet to establish a realistic effective field theory which can be used to evaluate the @xmath0 corrections in the standard feynman diagrammatic approach . as first applications",
    ", we evaluate the isgur - wise function , the heavy meson decay constant and the axial - vector coupling constant in the heavy quark limit in sec .",
    "iv . in sec .",
    "v , we compute the pseudoscalar and vector heavy meson masses up to @xmath0 , which determine the hqet parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 . in sec .",
    "vi , we compare the effective field theory with the covariant light - front model @xcite , and show how the effective field theory overcomes the lack of relativistic covariance in light - front quark models . in sec .",
    "vii , we present some numerical calculations to check the self - consistency of the theory , and then calculate all the basic parameters in hqet .",
    "the summary and perspective are given in sec .",
    "now we take the heavy quark limit , i.e. , @xmath25 . in the momentum space , the heavy meson carries momentum @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is a four velocity @xmath28 of the heavy meson , and @xmath29 the residual momentum .",
    "the heavy meson on - mass - shell condition @xmath30 corresponds to @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the heavy meson mass which approaches to infinity under the heavy quark limit but @xmath33 is kept finite .",
    "note that @xmath2 is a basic parameter in hqet known as the residual mass of the heavy meson .    in the heavy quark limit",
    ", we define the so - called reduced heavy quark field @xmath34 in the heavy quark expansion@xcite , @xmath35 we also introduce the reduced heavy meson composite operator @xmath36 , @xmath37 then the fourier transformation of the composite field operator in the momentum space can be expressed as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the residual momentum of the heavy quark , and @xmath40 the momentum of the light antiquark .",
    "the function @xmath41 is the heavy - quark - limit expression of the fourier transformation of @xmath23 , which is the analog of heavy meson wave function in the covariant light - front quark model @xcite .",
    "one may ask why is @xmath42 only a function of @xmath43 ? note that the fourier transformation of @xmath23 should be a scalar function of the relative momentum @xmath44 , @xmath45 in the heavy quark limit , the @xmath46- and @xmath47-dependences are suppressed by the heavy quark mass : @xmath48 also , due to heavy quark symmetry , @xmath49 must be a @xmath1-independent function in the heavy quark limit . besides , by momentum conservation [ i.e. the @xmath50-function in eq.([mhmf ] ) ] , @xmath51 and hence @xmath52 . since @xmath53 describes the composite structure of heavy meson bound states in which @xmath54 , then , without loss of the generality , we have replaced @xmath49 by the @xmath1-independent function @xmath55 in eq .",
    "( [ mhmf ] ) .",
    "a motivation of the above analysis is to provide a realistic field theory formulation of the intuitive picture of heavy hadrons ; that is , in the heavy quark limit the heavy meson is a composite particle which can be described by a composite field operator of a heavy quark @xmath56 coupled with the light degrees of freedom which is sometimes called the  brown muck \" in the literature . from eq .",
    "( [ mhmf ] ) , we see that it is natural to define the brown muck by @xmath57 the above definition indicates that the brown muck consists of a light valence antiquark ( which contains the tensoral structure of a spin-1/2 dirac particle ) coupled with a brown muck structure function @xmath6 , which effectively describes the dynamics of infinite number of @xmath20 pairs and gluons surrounding the light antiquark .",
    "thus , according to haag , nishijima and zimmermann @xcite , we may rewrite the composite field operator of heavy mesons as a local operator : @xmath58 and its momentum representation is given by : @xmath59    from eq.([rshm ] ) , the normalization condition of the heavy meson bound states ( with @xmath60 ) in the heavy quark limit is given by @xmath61 where the superscript @xmath62 denotes the energy component in the momentum space , which can be either the @xmath63 or the @xmath64 component , depending on whether the light quark on - shall energy is picked on the light - front , @xmath65 , or on the equal - time form , @xmath66 .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath67 becomes @xmath68 or @xmath69 .",
    "of course , a first - principles determination of the above composite particle picture lies in the detailed form of @xmath6 .",
    "how to solve @xmath70 directly from qcd is one of the most interesting and difficult problems in strong interaction physics . in the present paper , we shall treat @xmath71 in a phenomenological manner .",
    "based on the above analysis of the composite particle picture of heavy mesons in the heavy quark limit , we can now build an effective field theory to describe the heavy meson structure in hqet .      in principle , the heavy - meson composite particle structure is determined by the qcd lagrangian for heavy and light quarks plus gluons , @xmath72 using the @xmath0 expansion to the heavy quark qcd lagrangian @xcite , the above lagrangian can be rewritten as @xmath73 where @xmath74 governs the structure of the heavy meson composite field operator of eq .",
    "( [ cfo ] ) , and it has the heavy quark @xmath75 flavor - spin symmetry ( or simply the heavy quark symmetry , hqs ) , while , @xmath76 determines the @xmath0 corrections to @xmath77 , which breaks the heavy quark symmetry , where @xmath78 .    to directly solve the structure of the composite field operator of eq.([cfo ] ) from @xmath77 is not simple and may not even be possible within the known framework of field theory . instead we shall introduce an effective lagrangian to phenomenologically describe the heavy meson composite structure , @xmath79 which has the same heavy quark symmetry as @xmath77 , where @xmath80 , @xmath81 is the brown muck field of the light degrees of freedom inside the heavy mesons , specified by eq .",
    "( [ bmaq ] ) in momentum space . @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the reduced pseudoscalar and vector heavy meson fields , respectively : @xmath84 with @xmath85 , and @xmath86 as the bare residual mass of the heavy mesons , where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are defined here as the bare masses of heavy mesons and heavy quarks , respectively .",
    "the third and fourth terms in ( [ elcy ] ) are directly obtained from the free lagrangian of the pseudoscalar and vector fields with the above definition of the reduced fields , @xmath89 where @xmath90 .    in principle , the effective lagrangian @xmath91 may be derived from @xmath77 by integrating out the gluon degrees of freedom in a nonperturbative way , which is unfortunately not practical at present .",
    "therefore , we shall assume that after integrating out the gluon degrees of freedom mediated between heavy and light quarks , we are led to an effective lagrangian of the form : @xmath92 in which the complicated nonperturbative qcd dynamics to the heavy meson structure is effectively described by introducing the brown muck field @xmath81 through the universal structure function @xmath93 of eq.([bmaq ] ) .",
    "_ a consistency condition for the composite particle picture of heavy mesons in the heavy quark limit can be determined by demanding the equivalence of eqs.([elcy ] ) and ( [ el4q ] ) . _",
    "note that a priori the structure of @xmath94 can be different in eqs.([elcy ] ) and ( [ el4q ] ) , however the consistency requirement demands that they must be the same @xcite .",
    "we can now dynamically describe the heavy mesons in the heavy quark limit as composite particles in the above two effective field theories .",

    "our result is also close to the qcd sum rule results , which tend to concentrate within the range @xmath367 .",
    "in this paper , we have given a detail account of a recently proposed field theoretical description of heavy mesons @xcite .",
    "the effective theory incorporates heavy quark symmetry and the heavy quark effective theory , from which a natural realization of heavy mesons in the heavy quark limit as a composite particle of the reduced heavy quark coupled with a brown muck of light degrees of freedom is provided .",
    "this theory is fully covariant , so that feynman diagrammatic techniques can be use to carry out perturbative calculations .",
    "moreover the effective theory preserves the simplicity of a conventional quark model , in fact , for those quantities which do not have the so - called @xmath368diagram contributions , light - front quark model results can be reproduced as a special case in the present theory .",
    "thus this theory provides a link between the fundamental qcd and the phenomenologically successful quark model , so that the difficult subject of hadronic bound state physics can be quantitatively studied in a covariant framework .",
    "the effective theory provides a quasi - first - principles description of the heavy meson dynamics .",
    "although at present the description of the heavy mesons structure function @xmath6 is still phenomenological in nature , it offers a systematic approach to evaluate the @xmath0 corrections based on the first - principles @xmath0 expansion of qcd .",
    "this resembles very much the situation of the qcd analysis of deep inelastic scatterings , in which the low energy dynamics ( described by parton distribution functions ) is determined phenomenologically and perturbative corrections are given in a fully first - principles way .",
    "here the situation may even be better since the phenomenological part is constrained by hqs and hqet , and the nonperturbative qcd dynamics should be much simpler in the heavy quark limit .    as we have seen , the introduction of the structure function @xmath126 is crucial for a field theoretic realization of the heavy mesons as composite particles .",
    "in fact , this structure function is related to the covariant wave functions of heavy meson bound states , and it essentially describes the brown muck structure of the light degrees of freedom inside the heavy mesons in the heavy quark limit .",
    "our results show that it is not possible to extend the popular gaussian - type wave functions to be used in a fully covariant formulation . however , we find that a lorentzian - type function can be readily adopted in a covariant formulation for heavy meson structures , and numerically it gives a very good description of the physical properties of heavy mesons",
    ". the predictions for all the hqet parameters are consistent with experiment .",
    "@xmath2 is about @xmath369 gev [ for @xmath370 with @xmath371 which is consistent with results from hqet analyses of the experimental data@xcite .",
    "the heavy quark masses @xmath286 and @xmath338 , determined by fitting to the @xmath372 and @xmath373 mass differences , are about @xmath374 gev and @xmath375 gev respectively , which agree with those used in various relativistic quark model calculations , and also their respective pole masses .",
    "we find that the mass shift parameter @xmath3 in hqet is negative and very small ( about -0.04 @xmath376 ) because of a large cancellation between the heavy quark kinetic energy and the chromo - electric interaction between the heavy quark and the light degrees of freedom .",
    "the isgur - wise function we obtained is also consistent with other calculations .",
    "thus , we have self - consistently determined and predicted all the hqet parameters within the effective theory .",
    "we expect that the effective theory presented in this paper can now be applied to describe various heavy meson processes , such as the inclusive @xmath309 decays and various exclusive @xmath309 decays without involving light mesons . for processes involving light mesons",
    ", we must first extend our framework so that light mesons are also included . finally , to solve the structure function @xmath6 from the fundamental theory in the heavy quark limit is an important and interesting challenge .",
