    "a number of observations suggested that phenomena in most active regions in the universe are related to black holes .",
    "some of most active objects in the universe , for example , active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , micro - quasars ( black hole binaries ) , and gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , emit relativistic jets @xcite .",
    "it is believed that these relativistic jets are caused by the drastic phenomena around the black holes at the centers of these objects .",
    "the possible energy sources of the drastic phenomena are gravitational energy of the matter falling toward the black hole and rotational energy of the black hole itself .",
    "recently , numerical simulations of general relativistic mhd ( grmhd ) have suggested that the relativistic jet is launched from the vicinity of the black hole , i.e. inside of the ergosphere @xcite , and some long - term simulations showed that the energy is seemed to be supplied from the rotational energy of the black hole @xcite . in these grmhd simulations",
    ", the black hole rotational energy seems to be extracted through the magnetic field flux tubes due to the so called blandford - znajek mechanism @xcite .",
    "it was proposed as the mechanism in the force - free condition , by which the rotational energy of the black hole is extracted directly through the horizon along the magnetic flux tubes . however , in principle , causality prohibits the outward transportation of any material , energy , and information across the horizon .",
    "thus , as pointed out by @xcite , the blandford - znajek mechanism seems to be contradictory to the causality . on the other hand , in the penrose process",
    ", the black hole spin energy is extracted causally due to the negative energy - at - infinity ( or just called  energy \" ) of a particle caused by fission @xcite . @xcite and",
    "@xcite found the axisymmetric steady - state solution of ideal mhd plasma inflow with the negative energy toward the rotating black hole .",
    "when the negative energy of the inflowing plasma in the ergosphere is swallowed by the black hole , the black hole rotation energy decreases , that is , the black hole energy is extracted , just like the penrose process .",
    "the difference between the ideal mhd mechanism and the penrose process is that the negative energy is produced by the magnetic tension force in the ideal mhd inflow , while in the penrose process it is caused by the fission of a particle .",
    "this mhd energy extraction mechanism is called  mhd penrose process \" ( see table [ clasmech ] ) .",
    "the mhd penrose process was mimicked and confirmed by the grmhd simulations of initially uniform , very strongly magnetized plasma around a rapidly rotating black hole , which showed that the negative energy of plasma is produced quickly in the ergosphere @xcite . however , because of the short time duration of the simulation , the numerical solution is far from a stationary state .",
    "@xcite performed a long term grmhd simulations with the similar initial situation of koide ( 2003 ) , and confirmed the mhd penrose process in the early stage .",
    "furthermore , he found that the mhd penrose process is a transient phenomenon and alternately the outward electromagnetic energy flux through the horizon stationarily appears almost everywhere with the exception of a very thin equatorial belt .",
    "he remarked that the pure electromagnetic mechanism with ideal mhd condition continues to operate to extract the rotational energy of the black hole . strictly speaking",
    ", this electromagnetic mechanism should be distinguished from the original blandford - znajek mechanism because the original mechanism is derived with the force - free condition , while the electromagnetic energy extraction mechanism was shown with the ideal mhd simulations . in this paper",

    ", @xcite discussed the electromagnetic extraction mechanism of the black hole energy , including the force - free blandford - znajek mechanism , mhd penrose mechanism , and superradiance in the wide view .",
    "however , unfortunately , the convincing explanation with respect to the causality of these mechanisms , which should also yield the conditions of the mechanisms , is not given except for the mhd penrose process @xcite .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the force - free blandford - znajek mechanism uses the _ negative electromagnetic energy - at - infinity _ to extract the spin energy of the black hole .",
    "this point of view was discussed extensively by @xcite and @xcite for ideal mhd and force - free blandford - znajek mechanisms , respectively . however , it is often difficult to build physical intuition on the mhd / force - free blandford - znajek mechanisms with causality . here , we present an intuitive formula for the electromagnetic mechanism of the energy extraction from the rotating black hole to aid in building the physical intuition on the mechanisms .",
