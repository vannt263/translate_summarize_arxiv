    "imaging air cherenkov telescopes ( iacts )  @xcite have evolved into one of the most important tools for ground - based @xmath0-ray astronomy in the tev energy range . in an iact",
    ", cherenkov light emitted by particles of an extended air shower is imaged by a large mirror onto a camera consisting of an array of photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) .",
    "mirror sizes range from a few to almost 100 m@xmath1 ; initially , cameras consisted of some tens of phototubes (  pixels \" ) , whereas the latest generation of cameras now in operation or under construction frequently has several hundred phototubes , resulting both in an enhanced resolution of the image and in an improved field of view .",
    "the orientation and shape of the cherenkov image are related to the direction and type of the primary particle , and can be used to separate @xmath0-rays from the otherwise overwhelming background of charged cosmic rays .",
    "the total light yield in the image provides a measure for the energy of the primary .    to initiate the digitization of the signals from the camera , and of",
    "the read out of data , a trigger signal is required .",
    "usually , this trigger signal is derived from the camera itself . in order to suppress spurious signals , two or more camera pixels have to fire in coincidence , with pulse heights exceeding a threshold @xmath2 .",
    "the threshold value is usually quoted in units of the mean pulse height per photoelectron .",
    "the dominant source of spurious triggers are photons of the night - sky background ( nsb ) light , with a flux of about @xmath3 photons / m@xmath1  sr  s in the relevant spectral range from 300 to 600  nm  @xcite . for a telescope with 5  m@xmath1 mirror area and an effective pixel diameter of",
    "0.4@xmath4 this translates into a photoelectron rate of about 30  mhz per pixel . in order to prevent random coincidences between pixels from saturating the data acquisition system , rather high trigger thresholds for the individual pmts have to be chosen .",
    "typical telescopes  @xcite with a two - fold trigger coincidence require trigger thresholds of 20 or more photoelectrons in each pmt",
    ". as we shall see , these threshold values are generally much higher than expected based on the poisson fluctuation in the number of nsb photoelectrons .",
    "topic of this paper is the study and interpretation of the single - pmt trigger rates and the optimization of the behaviour of the individual pmts of a camera .",
    "we will first briefly review the expected night - sky trigger rates .",
    "we then describe the experimental setup used to study the trigger rates of pmts and present the experimental results and their interpretation .",
    "this work was carried out in preparation of the construction of the hegra iact system - an array of 5 cherenkov telescopes now under deployment at the canarian island of la palma .",
    "these telescopes will have about 8.3 m@xmath1 mirror area , 5 m focal length , and will be equipped with cameras consisting of up to 271 pmt pixels with size corresponding to @xmath5 .",
    "it is planned to use thorn - emi 9083 pmts , equipped with a short light funnel with a hexagonal entrance area .",
    "an additional prototype telescope has a mirror area of 5 m@xmath1 , and an initial camera consisting of 37 russian feu-130 pmts , each subtending a field of view of @xmath6 .",
    "a detailed description of this telescope @xmath7 whose camera is meanwhile upgraded to 127 thorn - emi pixels @xmath7 is found in  @xcite .",
    "in the following we review estimates for the rates at which individual pixels and the trigger coincidence fire .    let us assume , for simplicity , that the individual pixels of a camera fire at identical rates @xmath8 , and that all discriminator output pulses have the same length @xmath9 .",
    "if the coincidence unit reacts instantaneously , the rate @xmath10 of random @xmath11-pixel coincidences is approximately ( for @xmath12 ) : @xmath13 the coefficient @xmath14 gives the number of different @xmath11-pixel combinations ; for a two - fold coincidence of @xmath15 pixels , @xmath16 .",
    "typical coincidence windows @xmath9 range from 10 to 20  ns ; acceptable iact trigger rates @xmath17 are usually in the range of a few hz .",
    "for a two - fold coincidence of the 37 pixels of the hegra prototype telescope , e.g. , these numbers imply single - pixel trigger rates of a few 100 hz , many orders of magnitude below the 30-mhz rate at which single photoelectrons are generated by nsb .",
    "obviously , trigger thresholds have to be chosen high enough such that only rare fluctuations trigger a pixel .",
    "to estimate the single - pixel rates @xmath8 for a given discriminator threshold , a usual approach is the following : the single - photoelectron pulse response of the pmt is approximated as a rectangle of length @xmath18 , the characteristic shaping time .",
    "a discriminator with its threshold set at @xmath2 photoelectrons will then trigger if within a time @xmath18 at least @xmath2 photoelectrons are generated .",
    "assuming that the individual night sky photons , and hence the photoelectrons are uncorrelated , the rate @xmath19 can be estimated to @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the rate at which photoelectrons are generated , provided that the rate is small , @xmath22 .    in order to reduce random iact triggers ,",
    "two factors appear to be re - le - vant : a short coincidence resolution time @xmath9 is useful ( but in case of the usual 2-fold coincidence not too crucial , given that the rate @xmath23 depends only linearly on @xmath9 ) .",
    "more important is a fast response @xmath18 of the pmt , ideally close to the spread of a few ns of the genuine cherenkov photons ; for the required large thresholds @xmath24 this shaping time enters with a high power .",
    "a short estimate shows that based on these equations , a threshold of about 7 photoelectrons should reduce the random trigger rate of a single pmt of the hegra - ct1 to well below 300 hz , and hence the random coincidence rate @xmath23 to below one hz . operational experience",
    ", on the other hand , shows that much larger trigger thresholds are required , indicating that there are additional sources of pmt pulse - height fluctuations .",
    "the rate estimates given above neglect a number of effects .",
    "for example , the pulse - height discriminator is often ac - coupled to the pmt .",
    "the threshold is hence applied relative to the time - averaged amplitude , resulting in a small shift .",
    "also , the output pulse from the pmt is not rectangular .",
    "however , it is easy to see that approximating the pulse by a rectangular pulse of the same peak height and fwhm , pile - up is overestimated rather than underestimated . finally , the single - photoelectron pulse spectrum generated by a pmt is usually not a narrow line , but instead a rather broad spectrum of relative width @xmath25 .",
    "hence , the rms noise is increased by a factor @xmath26 ; the required threshold @xmath2 should increase by a similar factor .",
    "none of these factors explains the discrepancy between estimated and actually required thresholds .",
    "electronics noise could be another source of random triggers , but rate measurements with a closed camera lid usually identify night - sky photons as the dominant source of random triggers .    to provide more insight into the statistics of the amplification process",
    ", we calculated the expected distribution of pulse heights at the output of the pmt and the trigger rates based on the assumption that at each dynode the number of secondary electrons generated by a primary electron follows a poisson distribution .",
    "lacking an exact analytical expression , the response was calculated by numerically convoluting the distributions for the various stages of dynode amplification .",
    "to describe the response of the pmt in terms of an equivalent number of photoelectrons at its input , the resulting pulse heights were rescaled to the mean pulse height for a single photoelectron , corresponding to a total gain @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the gain of the n@xmath29 dynode .",
    "we used @xmath30 and @xmath31 for @xmath32 , corresponding roughly to the mean gain of becu dynodes at the typical voltages applied in our tests  @xcite .",
    "[ fig_model_pe_dist ] shows the resulting distribution of pulse heights for a single photoelectron .",
    "[ fig_model_pe_rate ] illustrates the modeled trigger rate as a function of the nsb photoelectron yield .",
    "the modeled pmt trigger rate shows two distinct regimes :    * for a very small mean number of photoelectrons per integration interval @xmath18 , the trigger probability is directly proportional to the nsb photoelectron rate . in this regime ,",
    "upward fluctuations of the single - photoelectron response cause triggers .",
    "the rate is much higher than expected on the basis of fluctuations in the number of photoelectrons per integration interval , and is quite insensitive to the pulse length @xmath18 . * for higher photoelectron rates the trigger probability grows with a higher power of the nsb photoelectron rate . in this regime , pile - up of photoelectrons causes triggers .",
    "the trigger rate rises steeply with the pulse length @xmath18 .",
    "rather than using actual night - sky light , the experimental trigger studies were carried out with an artificial source of background light , in order to generate reproducible conditions .",
    "for all practical purposes , only the rate at which  night sky \" photoelectrons are generated should matter , and not details of the spectrum of the incident light .    in our setup ,",
    "the pmt under test ( usually a thorn - emi 9083 ) is illuminated by a dim dc light source ; we use either a small filament lamp or a led . in order to study the time structure of pmt pulses , a pulsed fast led as well as a laser with about 1",
    "ns pulse length is available .",
    "the pmt output is coupled to a fast amplifier ( lecroy 612 am ) , which is connected via 15  m of rg178 cable to a fan - out . a similar setup will be used in the real telescopes , where a preamplifier is mounted in the camera , and the adcs and discriminators are located in crates near the telescope . despite its bandwidth limitations , rg178 cable is used in order to limit the cross section and the weight of the cable bundles . at the end of the cable , the pmt signal has a typical width of about 5  ns ( fwhm ) .",
    "one output of the fan - out is routed to a discriminator ( lecroy 821 ) , the other , via a delay , to a charge - sensitive adc ( lecroy 2249a ) gated by the discriminator signal .",
    "alternatively , a flash - adc system is used to record the pulse shapes , in particular to search for afterpulses .",
    "discriminator trigger rates are measured with a scaler .",
    "the pmt current is monitored by switching the pmt output to an electrometer . during a sequence of measurements , either the discriminator threshold or the light intensity",
    "is varied . to investigate the influence of the signal shaping time ,",
    "shaping amplifiers ( canberra 2111 ) could be added , resulting in pulse lengths of 15  ns or 30  ns fwhm .",
    "two critical constants have to be determined in order to calibrate the system : the relation between the discriminator threshold voltage and the equivalent number of photoelectrons , and the relation between the pmt dc current and the ( otherwise uncalibrated ) photon flux .",
    "we use the single - photoelectron peak to determine these coefficients . the charge spectrum measured at low light levels and with a low threshold setting",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_pe_peak](a ) , already corrected for the adc pedestal and after subtraction of the dark - count spectrum accumulated over the same time  . with a higher discriminator threshold setting , a relatively sharp cutoff in the spectrum is seen .",
    "adjusting the threshold until the cutoff is at the position of the single - photoelectron peak allows a rather precise calibration of the threshold in units of photoelectrons , after correction for offsets and pedestals . at lower operating voltages ,",
    "the single - photoelectron peak is not always well enough separated to use this technique . in such cases ,",
    "the calibration factor is determined at a higher voltage and then scaled down in proportion to the pmt gain as derived from the ratio of the dc currents at the two voltages , measured at the same light flux .",
    "for an asymmetric single - photoelectron peak such as the one seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_pe_peak ] , a principal question is whether the calibration should refer to the peak position , i.e. , the _ most probable _ pulse height , or to the _ average _ pulse height .",
    "we use the peak position as the easier and more reliable measurement .",
    "we estimate the systematic difference between the most probable and the average pulse height to be less than 10 to 15 % .",
    "the single - photoelectron rate @xmath21 for a given light intensity can be obtained either by directly counting events with a low threshold , or based on the pmt average current @xmath33 and the ( average ) charge gain @xmath34 of the pmt , @xmath35 with the elementary charge @xmath36 .",
    "we determine the charge gain using the position of the single - photoelectron peak in the adc spectrum . with either method to measure @xmath21 ,",
    "the behavior of the spectrum at very low pulse heights causes systematic uncertainties .",
    "the agreement between the two methods to determine the photoelectron rate @xmath7 counting or current measurement @xmath7 depended somewhat on the particular pmt used . typically , the values agreed within 10 to 15% .    in summary",
    ", we estimate that scale uncertainties in the calibration of the discriminator threshold in units of photoelectrons amount to 15 % , and that the photoelectron rate has a similar systematic uncertainty .",
    "fig .  [ fig_results ] shows a typical set of measurements carried out using an thorn - emi 9083 pmt . operated as 10-dynode pmt",
    ", the tube provides too much gain for use in an iact , resulting in large anode currents for typical nsb levels .",
    "therefore , the signals were derived from the 9th dynode , with the 10th dynode and the anode connected to the same potential .",
    "we used a resistive voltage divider , with resistor ratios 2:1.5:1:1 ... ( starting from the photo cathode ) .",
    "the divider was optimized to provide maximum homogeneity and size of the active surface , and good linearity .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_results ] we illustrate how the pmt trigger rates depend on various parameters , such as the trigger threshold @xmath2 ( a ) , the light level ( expressed in terms of the photoelectron rate ) ( b ) , the pulse length ( c ) and the high voltage applied to the pmt , with the trigger threshold kept constant in units of photoelectrons ( d ) .",
    "statistical errors on the data points are generally negligible , except for low rates in the hz region ; even there , statistical errors are generally below 10% .",
    "complete sets of measurements were repeated after several days , including the determination of calibration constants , and showed that rates are reproduced within 15% . for a given pmt current , illumination with a filament lamp and a led results in identical trigger rates , within 5% .",
    "different pmts of the same type ( and from the same production batch ) showed similar trigger rates , within a factor of 2 .",
    "the results shown in fig .  [ fig_results ] ( a),(b),(c ) agree qualitatively with our expectations ; trigger rates drop with increasing threshold , with decreasing light level , and with decreasing shaping time .",
    "quantitatively , they are however in striking contrast with the model calculations ( fig .  [ fig_model_pe_rate ] ) :    * with increasing threshold , trigger rates fall much more slowly than expected on the basis of a poisson distribution in the number of photoelectrons , even including the gain fluctuations . * the absolute trigger rates for large thresholds are several orders of magnitude larger than expected . * the trigger rate depends linearly on the light yield over almost the entire range of light levels . only for the highest levels the dependence steepens . *",
    "the influence of the pulse length is relatively modest ; based on eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] a change from 5 ns pulse length to 30 ns at a threshold @xmath2 = 15 should increase the rate by about 8 orders of magnitude , compared to an observed increase of less than 10 .",
    "* finally , as the single - photoelectron peak narrows with increasing high voltage , one would expect the rate to decrease slightly , when the voltage is increased , and the threshold is adjusted to correspond to a fixed number of photoelectrons .",
    "in contrast , the data show a significant increase of the rate with the pmt operating voltage . for @xmath2 = 15 , e.  g.",
    ", the trigger rate rises with the 1.8@xmath29  power of the pmt gain .",
    "the obvious interpretation of these observations is that gain fluctuations have a much larger tail towards large pulse heights than expected ; these gain fluctuations dominate over the poisson fluctuations in the number of photoelectrons over nearly the entire range in @xmath21 .",
    "the presence of such a tail in the pmt response is indeed evident from the charge spectrum of single - photoelectron signals , once it is plotted on a logarihmic scale ( fig .",
    "[ fig_pe_peak ] ( b ) ) . at levels below about @xmath37 of the peak",
    ", a long and flat tail takes over from the steep descent of charge spectra right beyond the peak . in the region of iact",
    "trigger thresholds , this tail dominates .",
    "the tail is not caused by background events unrelated to the illumination ; the fraction of events in the tail is constant over a wide range of light levels .",
    "the observation of this tail is not limited to the thorn - emi 9083 pmt ; similar behaviour was observed for the philips xp2020 , and for the ( in its construction completely different ) hamamatsu r5600p , although the relative level of the tail differed .",
    "in order to identify the origin of the large pulses , which cause the high trigger rates , we considered first the high - voltage dependence of the phenomenon .",
    "the voltage of the early stages ( photocathode to 4th dynode ) and of the later stages were varied independently ( see fig .  [ fig_hv_dep ] ) .",
    "the level of the tail is sensitive to the field strenght in the early stages , and quite insensitive to the later stages . as a candidate mechanism to generate the large pulses ,",
    "the ionization of rest gas on or near the first dynode emerged .",
    "studies with the fast led as a pulsed light source and the flash - adc system to record the time history of the signals did indeed reveal afterpulses following about 500  ns after the light pulse ( fig .",
    "[ fig_time_dep ] ) .",
    "this delay is consistent with the propagation time  @xcite of an ion back to the photocathode , where its impact releases a large number of electrons , which are then subsequently amplified and generate a large output pulse .",
    "varying the voltage @xmath38 applied to the pmt , the delay @xmath39 was observed to vary as expected for such a mechanism , @xmath40 . using the pulsed light source",
    ", we could separately record the pulse height distributions of both prompt and delayed pulses .",
    "[ fig_early_late ] illustrates that indeed for prompt pulses ( first 20  ns after the led pulse ) the large - amplitude tail is significantly reduced , whereas the delayed pulses ( around 450 to 550  ns ) include the large - pulseheight tail causing most of the triggers for large @xmath2 .",
    "what do these observations imply for the optimization of iact trigger schemes ? given the high photoelectron rate , an active veto of delayed pulses seems excluded , since it would generate enormous dead time .",
    "since a major source of rest gas in pmts is the diffusion of helium in the atmosphere through the pmt walls  @xcite , an effective reduction of the rest gas pressure appears difficult .",
    "a relatively simple means , however , is the reduction of the voltage applied to the pmt ; a lower field in the space between photo cathode and 1st dynode reduces both the probability for ionization , and the reacceleration of ions .",
    "usually , pmt voltages are optimized for optimal electron collection and a good single - photoelectron peak .",
    "given that at least some telescopes operate with conversion factors of about 1 adc channel per photoelectron , a slightly - wider than optimal single - photoelectron peak seems tolerable .",
    "we conclude that the voltage between photocathode and 1st dynode should be chosen near the minimum required for homogenous electron collection and response .",
    "we thank t. lohse for contributions to the numerical modeling of the pmt trigger rates .",
    "we acknowledge discussions with members of the hegra - iact group , in particular with r.  mirzoyan .",
