    "in the past decade great interest has been devoted to the study of _ limited information related _ control problems .",
    "limited information related control is defined as follows : given a physical plant @xmath0 and a set of performance specifications such as tracking , design a controller @xmath1 based on limited information such that the resulting closed - loop system meets the prespecified performance specifications .",
    "there are generally two sources of limited information , one is signal quantization , and the other is signal transmission through various networks .    in designing a digital control system , signal quantization induced by signal converters such as a / d , d / a and computer finite word - length limitation is unavoidable . to compensate this ,",
    "traditional design methods generally proceed like this : first design a controller ignoring the effect of signal quantization , then model it as external white noise and analyze its effect on the designed system .",
    "if the performance is acceptable , it is okay ; otherwise , adjust controller parameters such as the sampling frequency , or do redesign ( including the choice of converters ) until satisfactory performance is obtained .",
    "recently the following problems have been asked :    1 .   how to study the effect of signal quantization more rigorously ?",
    "more precisely , how will it genuinely affect the performance of the underlying control system ? 2 .",
    "if there are positive answers to the above question , can one design better controllers based on this knowledge ?    to address these two problems , stability , the fundamental requirement of a control system , has been studied recently in somewhat detail .",
    "delchamps [ 1990 ] studied the problem of stabilizing an _ unstable _ linear time - invariant discrete - time system via state feedback where the state is quantized by an arbitrarily given quantizer of _ fixed _ quantization sensitivity .",
    "it turned out that there are no state feedback strategies ensuring asymptotic stability of the closed - loop system in the sense of lyapunov .",
    "instead , the resulting closed - loop system behaves chaotically .",
    "fagnani & zampieri [ 2003 ] continued this research in the context of a linear discrete - time scalar system .",
    "based on the flow information provided by the system invoked by quantization , stabilizing methods based on the lyapunov approach and chaotic dynamics of the system were discussed .",
    "ishii & francis [ 2003 ] studied the quadratic stabilization of an unstable linear time - invariant continuous - time system by designing a digital controller whose input was the quantized system state ; an upper bound of sampling periods was calculated geometrically using state feedback for the system @xmath0 with a carefully designed quantizer of fixed quantization sensitivity , by which the trajectories of the closed - loop system would enter and stay in a region of attraction around the origin .",
    "clearly in order to achieve asymptotic stability , quantizers with _",
    "quantization sensitivities must be adopted . in brockett & liberzon [ 2000 ] , for the system @xmath0 , by choosing a quantizer @xmath2 with time - varying sensitivities , a linear time - invariant feedback was designed to yield global asymptotic stability .",
    "this problem was also studied in elia & mitter [ 2001 ] for exponential stability using logarithmic quantizers . in nair & evans [ 2002 ] , exponential stabilization of the system",
    "@xmath0 with a quantizer is studied under the framework of probability theory .",
    "more interestingly , the simultaneous effect of sampling period @xmath3 and quantization sensitivity was studied in bamieh [ 2003 ] , where it is shown via simulation that system performance would become _ unbounded _ as @xmath4 if a quantizer of fixed sensitivity was inserted into a control loop composed of a system and an unstable controller .",
    "therefore it is fair to say that the problem  performance of quantized systems is quite complicated as well as challenging .",
    "much research is still required in this area .",
    "another representation of limited information is signals suffering from time - delays or even loss , which are ubiquitous in the networked control systems ( wong & brockett [ 1997 ] , walsh _ et al . _ [ 2001 ] , and ray [ 1987 ] ) .",
    "the fast - developing secure , high speed networks ( varaiya & walrand [ 1996 ] and peterson & davie [ 2000 ] ) make control over networks possible . compared to the traditional point - to - point connection , the main advantages of connecting various system components such as processes , controllers , sensors and actuators via communication networks are wire reduction , low cost and easy installation and maintenance , etc .",
    "thanks to these merits , networked control systems have been built successfully in various fields such as automobiles ( krtolica _ et al . _ [ 1994 ] , ozguner _",
    "et al . _ [ 1992 ] ) , aircrafts ( ray [ 1987 ] and sparks [ 1997 ] ) , robotic controls ( malinowshi _ et al . _",
    "[ 2001 ] , safaric _ et al . _",
    "[ 1999 ] ) and so on .",
    "in addition , in the field of distributed control , networks may provide distributed subsystems with more information so that performance can be improved ( ishii & francis [ 2002 ] ) .",
    "however , networks inevitably introduce time delays and packet dropouts due to network propagation , signal computation and coding , congestion , etc . , which lead to limited information for the system to be controlled as well as the controller , thus complicating the design of controllers and degrading the performance of control systems or even destabilizing them ( zhang _ et al .",
    "_ [ 2001 ] ) .",
    "therefore it is very desirable to reduce time delays and packet dropouts when implementing a networked control system . for the limitation of space , for",
    "now we will concentrate on discussing a network protocol proposed by walsh , beldiman , bushnell , and hong , _ et al . _ ( walsh _ et al . _",
    "[ 1999 , 2001 , 2002a , 2002b ] ) since our proposed one is in the same spirit as theirs . for",
    "a more complete review on networked control systems and more references , please refer to zhang & chen [ 2003 ] .",
    "one effective way to avoid large time delays and high probability of packet dropouts is by reducing network traffic . in a series of papers published by walsh , beldiman , bushnell , and hong , _ et al . _",
    "( walsh _ et al . _",
    "[ 1999 , 2001 , 2002a , 2002b ] ) , a network protocol called try - once - discard ( tod ) is proposed . in that scheme",
    ", there is a network along the route from a mimo plant to its controller . at each transmission time",
    ", each sensor node calculates the importance of its current value by comparing it with the latest one , the larger the difference is , the more important the current value is , then the most important one gets access to the network . for this scheme , based on the lyapunov method and the perturbation theory , a minimal time",
    "within which there must have at least one network transmission to guarantee stability of networked control systems is derived .",
    "this network protocol , tod , essentially belongs to the category of dynamical schedulers . in comparison with static schedulers such as token rings",
    ", it allocates network resources more effectively .",
    "however , a supervisor computer , i.e. , a central controller , is required to compare those differences and decide which node should get access to the network at each transmission time .",
    "it is therefore complicated and possibly difficult to implement . in this paper",
    ", we introduce another technique aiming at reducing network traffic .",

    "( [ constraint1])-([constraint2 ] ) are not satisfied , suggesting that we are reducing network traffic .",
    "we expect this will benefit the overall system connected by the common networks .",
    "one example will be given in sec .",
    "3 to illustrate this point .",
    "similar work is done in otanez _",
    "et al . _ [ 2003 ] where _ adjustable _ deadbands are proposed to reduce network traffics . in that formulation ,",
    "the closed - loop system with deadbands is modeled as a perturbed system , then its exponential stability follows that of the original system [ khalil 1996 ] .",

    "2 is quite complicated ( e.g. , only local stability can be obtained ) .",
    "however , the advantage of fixed deadbands is that it will reduce network traffic more effectively .",

    "next let @xmath449 when @xmath450 @xmath451 . if @xmath452 , then the trajectory will stay at @xmath453 forever .",
    "the goal is achieved . on the other hand ,",
    "assume @xmath454 . if @xmath455 , we first let the trajectory move along the @xmath441axis until we get @xmath456 @xmath457 , then choose @xmath458 . in this way",
    "@xmath459 is below the line segment of fixed point ( then @xmath460 will move downward at the next step ) such that@xmath461and @xmath462(note this is guaranteed by the property of the vector field of the system . )",
    "then let @xmath463 , and repeat the above procedure .",
    "similarly if @xmath464 , all we need to do is to choose suitable @xmath465 such that @xmath466 is above the line segment of fixed points , then follow the above procedure . in this way",
    "we can keep the trajectory within the distance @xmath443 of the origin . based on the above analysis",
    ", we observe that the instability of the parameter @xmath320 poses a difficulty for implementing our scheme , there are more discussions from the perspective of higher dimensional systems ( e.g. theorem 6 below ) .",
    "the foregoing discussion is reminiscent of proposition 2.2 in delchamps [ 1990 ] , however our scheme is better since the @xmath303 in that paper can be @xmath100 here .",
    "moreover , our algorithm is simpler too .    for the item ( 2 ) ,",
    "suppose it is desired that the system operates on a periodic orbit @xmath467 of periodic @xmath3 . if @xmath113 , according to theorem 4 , by suitably choosing @xmath321 , a periodic orbit of period @xmath3 can be built . if @xmath468 , then following the discussion at the end of sec .",
    "2.1.2 , it is also possible to construct a periodic orbit of period @xmath3 .",
    "then the real question is : can we really find an initial condition which produce or converge to the desirable periodic orbit @xmath467 ? if @xmath467 is within a strange attractor , then from almost all initial points , trajectories will be within an arbitrarily small neighborhood of @xmath467 at some time @xmath99 ; this is the property of a stranger attractor .",
    "so we can just pick up such an initial condition , let the system run automatically first , and apply control similarly to the case in item ( 1 ) when the trajectory is sufficiently close to @xmath467 , and keep it remain within a small neighborhood of @xmath467 .",
    "therefore the problem boils down to constructing a strange attractor containing @xmath467 .",
    "this is the problem we are currently studying .",
    "note that our chaotic system seems different than many known chaotic systems , which have strange attractors within which there are periodic orbits of any periods .",
    "however in light of corollary 2 , there may be no periodic orbits at all when @xmath320 is rational and @xmath321 is irrational .",
    "this annoying fact may probably be due to the scheme we are proposing involves discontinuities .",
    "we have already known that there may be a great variety of dynamics this scheme can produce , which brings more freedom to a control engineer , and especially suitable for multi - purpose controller design .",
    "however in order to make the proposed scheme more useful , a thorough study of this scheme has to be conducted .",
    "we have to acknowledge that the preceding analysis is naive , nevertheless , it illustrates that by using the trajectories of the system , i.e. , some extra information in addition to system parameters , we can achieve better control in some sense . for chaotic control , interested readers may refer to schuster [ 1999 ]",
    ". these will be our future research directions .",
    "here we still adhere to classic control theory .",
