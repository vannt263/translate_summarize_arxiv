    "the formation process of massive stars is still a largely unsolved problem .",
    "although it is believed that stars generally originate from the collapse and subsequent accretion of clumps within molecular clouds ( palla & stahler @xcite ) , this model can not explain the formation of stars beyond 10 ( bonnell et al .",
    "the strong radiation pressure of massive stars can halt the infall of matter limiting the mass of the star ( yorke & krgel @xcite , wolfire & cassinelli @xcite , beech & mitalas @xcite ) , while a large fraction of the infalling material may as well be deflected into bipolar outflows by processes which we do not yet know in detail ( churchwell @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , since the evolutionary time scales of massive stars are comparatively short , these stars are believed to enter the main sequence while still embedded in their parent molecular clouds ( yorke & krgel @xcite , shu et al .",
    "@xcite , palla & stahler @xcite , beech & mitalas @xcite , bernasconi & maeder @xcite ) .",
    "this means that massive stars may already experience significant mass loss and subsequent evolution while still accreting mass from the parental cloud .    in order to understand the formation of massive stars it is therefore necessary to study them at the earliest phases where they can be reached through the enshrouding material at different wavelengths . while high - resolution radio continuum observations allow the investigation of ultracompact 2 regions ( churchwell @xcite ) formed around newborn massive stars , high angular resolution observations in ultraviolet , visible , and infrared wavelengths ( walborn & fitzpatrick @xcite , walborn et al .",
    "@xcite , schaerer & de koter @xcite , hanson et al .",
    "@xcite ) are necessary to access accurate physical parameters of these stars and then evaluate their states of evolution .",
    "our search for the youngest massive stars in the magellanic clouds started almost two decades ago on the basis of ground - based observations .",
    "this led to the discovery of a distinct and very rare class of 2 regions , that we called high - excitation compact 2 `` blobs '' ( hebs ) .",
    "the blob in n159 , which is the subject of this paper , was the prototype of this category of nebulae ( heydari - malayeri & testor 1982 ) .",
    "so far only four other hebs have been found in the lmc : n160a1 , n160a2 , n83b-1 , and n11a ( heydari - malayeri & testor 1983 , 1985 , 1986 , heydari - malayeri et al.1990 ) and two more in the smc : n88a and n81 ( testor & pakull 1985 , heydari - malayeri et al .",
    "1988 ) . to further improve our understanding of those compact 2 regions and overcome the difficulties related to their small size",
    ", we used the superior resolving power of _ hst _ to image n81 and n88a , in the smc , as well as n159 - 5 in the lmc .",
    "the analysis and discussion for the first two objects was presented by heydari - malayeri et al .",
    "( @xcite,@xcite , hereafter papers i and ii respectively ) .    in the present paper",
    "we study our third _ hst _ target , the lmc blob n159 - 5 .",
    "this object lies in the 2 complex n159 ( henize @xcite ) , situated some 30 ( 500 pc ) south of 30 dor .",
    "n159 is associated with one of the most important concentrations of molecular gas in the lmc ( johansson et al . @xcite and references therein ) and contains several signposts of ongoing star formation ( cocoon stars , ir sources , masers ) .",
    "n159 - 5 is the name given by heydari - malayeri & testor ( @xcite ) to a compact 2 region of size 6 ( 1.5 pc ) with high excitation ( /=8 ) and suffering a considerable extinction of @xmath2=5 mag as derived from and radio continuum ( heydari - malayeri & testor @xcite ) .",
    "they also showed that the chemical composition of the object is compatible with that of typical lmc 2 regions .",
    "israel & koornneef ( @xcite ) detected near - ir molecular hydrogen emission towards the object , partly shocked and partly radiatively excited .",
    "they also confirmed the high extinction of the object from a comparison of br@xmath3 and and estimated that n159 - 5 contributes 25% to the total flux of the iras source lmc1518 ( israel & koornneef @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , comern & claes ( @xcite ) used isocam to obtain an image of n159 - 5 at 15@xmath4 m .",
    "similarly , hunt & whiteoak ( @xcite ) used the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) to obtain the highest angular resolution radio continuum observations in existence of n159 - 5 ( beam 8.37.4 ) .",
    "however , none of these observations were able to resolve n159 - 5 .",
    "the observations of n159 - 5 described in this paper were obtained with the wide field planetary camera ( wfpc2 ) on board the _ hst _ on september 5 , 1998 as part of the project go6535 .",
    "we used several wide- and narrow - band filters ( f300w , f467 m , f410 m , f547 m , f469n , f487n , f502n , f656n , f814w ) to image the stellar population as well as the ionized gas .",
    "the observational techniques , exposure times , and reduction procedures are similar to those explained in detail in paper i.",
    "in fig.[mosaic ] we present the wfpc2 image of the eastern part of the giant 2 region n159 .",
    "this image reveals a very turbulent medium in which ionized subarcsecond structures are interwoven with fine absorption features .",
    "a large number of filaments , arcs , ridges , and fronts are clearly visible . in the south - western part of fig.[mosaic ] , we note a relatively large , high excitation ridge bordering a remarkable cavity 25 ( 6pc ) in size .",
    "another conspicuous cavity lies in the northern part of the image .",
    "these are most probably created by strong winds of massive stars . moreover , a salient , dark gulf running westward into n159 cuts the glowing gas in that direction and as it advances takes a filamentary appearance . a comparison with the co map of johansson et al .",
    "( @xcite ) indicates that this absorption is due to the molecular cloud n159-e .",
    "the 2 blob n159 - 5 stands out as a prominent high excitation compact nebula in the center of the wfpc2 field ( fig.[mosaic ] ) , at the edge of two distinct absorption lanes of size 313 ( 0.83.3 pc ) .",
    "the most important result of our wfpc2 observations is shown in the inset of fig.[mosaic ] , namely the n159 - 5 blob resolved for the first time .",
    "in fact n159 - 5 consists of two distinct ionized components separated by a low brightness zone the eastern border of which has a sharp front .",
    "the overall shape of n159 - 5 is reminiscent of a butterfly or _",
    "papillon _ in french .",
    "the centers of the two wings are 2.3 ( 0.6 pc ) apart .",
    "the brightest part of the right wing appears as a `` smoke ring '' or a doughnut with a projected radius of 0.6 ( 0.14 pc ) .",
    "the left wing is characterized by a very bright `` globule '' of radius 0.4 ( 0.1 pc ) to which are linked several bright stripes all parallel and directed towards the central sharp front .",
    "an obvious questions is : where is ( are ) the ionizing star(s ) of n159 - 5 ?",
    "no conspicuous stars can be detected within the papillon itself , although its overall high excitation and morphology require the source of ionization to be very close to the center of this structure .",
    "a faint star of @xmath5=17.9 mag can be seen between the two wings ( fig.[mosaic ] , inset ) and may well be the major source of ionization , heavily obscured by foreground dust .",
    "at least three more stars weaker than @xmath520 mag are detected ( not visible in fig.[mosaic ] ) , two of them lying in the brightest parts of the smoke ring and one towards the other wing , east of the front .",
    "no star is detected towards the globule .",
    "the _ hst _ observations allow us to study the spatial variation of the extinction in the direction of the papillon nebula .",
    "the / ratio is high in both wings ( fig.[rapport]a ) , varying between 5 and 10 , corresponding to a visual extinction @xmath2 between 1.5 and 3.5 mag , if the lmc interstellar reddening law is used ( prvot et al .",
    "the extinction towards the zone separating the two wings also shows comparable ratios .",
    "the / map was used to de - redden the flux on a pixel to pixel basis .",
    "the 5007/ map also displays the butterfly - like structure ( fig.[rapport]b ) with line ratios varying between 3.5 and 8 .",
    "the band separating the wings has overall smaller values .",
    "a comparison of the and images shows that the papillon has the same size and morphology in both filters .",
    "this suggests a hard radiation field in which the high excitation o@xmath6 ions occupy the same zone as the ionized hydrogen . a simple calculation ( paper ii )",
    "shows that almost all oxygen atoms are doubly ionized .",
    "we measure a total flux f ( ) = 2.6810@xmath7 erg 2 above 3@xmath8 level for both wings ( accurate to 3% ) . correcting for the extinction ( sect . 3.2 ) gives @xmath9=5.3510@xmath10 erg 2 .",
    "the flux is not equally distributed between the two wings since 60% is generated by the eastern wing ( globule ) , whereas the western wing ( smoke ring ) contributes by 40% .",
    "a lyman continuum flux of @xmath11=4.1710@xmath12 photons can be derived for the whole n159 - 5 taking @xmath13=10500k ( heydari - malayeri & testor @xcite ) , assuming a distance of 55 kpc , and considering that the 2 region is ionization - bounded .",
    "a single o8v star can account for this ionizing flux ( vacca et al .",
    "@xcite , schaerer & de koter @xcite ) .",
    "however , this should be viewed as a lower limit , since the region is probably not ionization - bounded .",
    "the three magellanic cloud blobs studied so far with _ hst _ ( n81 , n88a , and n159 - 5 ) represent very young massive stars leaving their natal molecular clouds .",
    "while n81 is a rather isolated starburst , n88a and n159 - 5 are formed in richer regions of gas where a preceding generation of massive stars has taken place .",
    "being very young , these two regions are also similar in that they are heavily affected by dust . in spite of these similarities ,",
    "n159 - 5 has a bewildering morphology which is seen neither in the other blobs , nor , generally speaking , in any of the known magellanic cloud 2 regions .",
    "the global morphology of the papillon and more especially the presence of peculiar fine structure features in the wings make this object a unique 2 region in the lmc .",
    "it is also the first bipolar nebula indicating young massive star formation in an outer galaxy . in this respect",
    "the papillon may even represent a new type of very young 2 region in the magellanic clouds overlooked so far because of insufficient spatial resolution .    even though high resolution spectroscopy would be necessary for a conclusive picture of the papillon s nature , the parallel ray - like features of the globule as well as the smoke ring strongly suggest a dynamical origin .",
    "several observational facts also advocate a common process for the formation of these two compact features : their proximity ( 2.3 ) , their location in a distinct , more diffuse nebular structure , and the uniqueness of the phenomenon in the large field of the n159 complex . in order to explain the observed morphology of n159 - 5 , two different models can be envisaged .",
    "\\1 ) we are looking at a bipolar region produced by strong stellar wind of hot star(s ) hidden behind the central absorption zone .",
    "it has been shown that in hot , rotating stars the mass loss rate is much larger at the poles than at the equator ( maeder 1999 ) .",
    "this model can account for the high excitation of the two wings , as well as the global bipolar morphology .",
    "although we can not yet firmly advocate a bipolar phenomenon , we underline the morphological similarity between the papillon and the high resolution image of kleinmann - low nebula in orion recently obtained with the subaru 8.3 m telescope at 2.12@xmath4 m ( subaru team 1999 ) .",
    "this image shows a butterfly - shaped exploding area produced by the wind of a young cluster of stars , among which irc2 , a particularly active star estimated to have a mass over 30 .",
    "however , this model does not explain the smoke ring neither the parallel stripes .",
    "one may also compare n159 - 5 with the well - studied galactic 2 region sh106 which has a prominent bipolar shape , marvellously shown in an _ hst _ image ( bally et al .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "its exciting star is hidden in the absorption region between the two lobes where extinction amounts to 20 mag in the visual .",
    "the southern lobe is much brighter than the northern one because it is blueshifted , while the other is expanding away from the observer . also , both lobes get gradually fainter in their external parts",
    ". however , we do not see such global trends in n159 - 5 and , more importantly , no smoke ring or globule features are present in sh106 .",
    "\\2 ) alternatively , n159 - 5 may represent two close but distinct nebulae each with its own massive star providing a high excitation for the ionized gas . in this possibility",
    ", the globule may be a bow shock created by an o star with a powerful stellar wind moving at speeds of 10 km through the molecular cloud ( models of van buren & mac low @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the presence of the parallel rays and the sharp front make this explanation attractive .",
    "since no stars are detected towards the globule , we may speculate that the star is hidden behind the bow shock / globule that is heading towards the observer .",
    "as for the smoke ring , it may be due to the interaction of a stellar wind from a central star with the surrounding medium creating a bubble structure . if this is the case , the mass loss should be important , comparable to that observed in luminous blue variables .",
    "however , lbvs are evolved massive stars and it is not clear how this phenomenon can occur in such a young region .",
    "another explanation for the smoke ring can be provided by the mentioned bow shock models .",
    "they predict the formation of a stellar wind bubble when the star s motion is subsonic .",
    "the smoke ring can therefore be due to such a slower moving star .",
    "if this picture is correct , we are witnessing a very turbulent star forming site where massive stars formed in group are leaving their birthplace .",
    "one should stress the noteworthy absence of prominent stars towards the papillon . as in the case of the smc n88a ( paper ii ) , this is certainly due to the very young age and the high dust content of this star formation region .",
    "n159 - 5 is just hatching from its natal molecular cloud , and its exciting stars should therefore be buried inside dust / gas concentrations . in order for a star of type o8 with @xmath14=4.66 mag ( vacca et al .",
    "@xcite ) to remain undetected in our strmgren @xmath5 image , we need extinctions larger than @xmath2=6 mag , which is quite possible given the above estimates",
    ". however , n159 - 5 will gradually evolve into a more extended , less dense region exhibiting its exciting stars , like the smc n81 ( paper i ) .",
