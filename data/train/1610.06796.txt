    "while there is currently no complete theory of quantum gravity , phenomenological models can motivate conceptual and experimental studies of the interplay between quantum theory and general relativity  @xcite .",
    "experimental bounds on a variety of models have been obtained , both from the observed validity of quantum mechanics in a variety of systems and from studies focussed on experimentally testing for such phenomena  @xcite .",
    "so far , there has been no experimental evidence of a modification to quantum mechanics or general relativity within their respective regimes of applicability .",
    "however , improved experimental bounds can help to rule out some models and/or restrict where free parameters can lie .",
    "a specific class of phenomenological models assumes that the heisenberg uncertainty principle undergoes modifications near the planck energy or the planck length .",
    "this so - called generalized uncertainty principle ( gup ) is motivated by various considerations in quantum gravity @xcite , including string theory @xcite , micro black holes @xcite , doubly special relativity @xcite , and gedankenexperiments at short distances @xcite .",
    "a quantum theory based on the gup has been the subject of a wide range of studies @xcite .",
    "one of the main implications is the lack of position eigenstates and the appearance of a minimal - length scale @xcite .",
    "effects of the gup on various quantum systems and phenomena have been studied , such as a particle in a box , the simple harmonic oscillator , the lamb shift , scanning tunnelling microscopy @xcite , as well as its effects in cosmology @xcite .",
    "it was also shown that the gup implies discreteness of measured lengths , areas and volumes at the fundamental level @xcite . in the last few years , several schemes to test the gup have been proposed .",
    "these include optomechanical interactions  @xcite , gravitational bar detectors  @xcite , nanodiamond interferometry  @xcite , and direct measurements on a harmonic oscillator  @xcite .",
    "various different forms of the gup have been proposed in the literature @xcite .",
    "a general form of the gup , expressed in terms of an inequality and in terms of a deformed commutator , is given , to @xmath0 , by @xmath1 , \\\\",

    "@xcite a type of gup was proposed based on algebraic structure , from which the quadratic terms in momentum and higher orders follows the commutator @xmath13 = i\\hbar \\delta_{ij } \\sqrt{1 + \\alpha^2 \\left [ p^2 + ( mc)^2 \\right ] } \\label{comm2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 denotes the mass of the quantum object",
    ". in the following , we will be working in one spatial dimension ( with coordinate @xmath15 and momentum @xmath16 ) , applying the various gups to a quantum mechanical oscillator .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that optomechanics can be used to constrain the free parameters in gup models to a high precision , under the assumption that collective quantum degrees of freedom are affected . here",
    "we present an extension to this scheme and show that multiple pulsed interactions can be used to improve the sensitivity of the experiment .",
    "in particular , we analyze optical phase noise and loss and identify the parameter regime where this extension is advantageous .",
    "this work can help obtain better experimental bounds on gup parameters , which can also help to better constrain other interpretations of the model where only the `` fundamental constitutents '' are affected .",
    "we first present the scheme and main ideas of ref . @xcite .",
    "then in section [ ncycles ] we describe our scheme to amplify the signal using multiple cycles .",
    "in section [ sec : deleterious_effects ] we analyze optical phase noise and optical loss and , exploiting the multiple pulse sequence proposed here , present a strategy to reduce the unwanted effects of optical loss .",
    "the basic idea presented in @xcite is to utilise a sequence of four radiation pressure interactions with an optical pulse and a mechanical harmonic oscillator ( mass : @xmath14 ; angular frequency : @xmath17 ) , which forms one end - mirror of an optical cavity  @xcite .",
    "the scheme allows one to precisely infer the value of the mechanical canonical commutator , including possible quantum - gravity - induced deformations , by measuring how the phase of the light field is changed by the interaction . introducing the dimensionless mechanical position and momentum quadrature operators    @xmath18",
    "one can show that in a pulsed regime  @xcite the interaction can be described in terms of the unitary operator @xmath19 where @xmath20 represents the interaction strength , and @xmath21 is the photon number operator .",
    "note that @xmath22= [ x , p]/\\hbar$ ] . in what follows , the subscript",
    "m is used to identify mechanical quantities , and the subscript l is used for optical degrees - of - freedom .    the same pulse re - enters the cavity after a quarter of a mechanical period and this is repeated three more times to complete a full mechanical cycle .",
    "the total interaction is described by the operator @xmath23 the operator @xmath24 contains information on the commutation relation between @xmath25 and @xmath26 and imprints this information onto the optical field . to quantify this change to the optical field",
    "we examine the mean of the field operator , i.e. @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the annihilation operator for the optical field and @xmath29 is the input optical coherent state with mean photon number @xmath30 .",
    "the mean of the field operator using standard quantum mechanics is @xmath31 , and @xmath32 describes the planck - scale - physics - dependent additional phase on the light .",
    "for example , for the purely quadratic gup , and for the models in ( [ comm1 ] ) , and ( [ comm2 ] ) , we have    @xmath33    respectively .",
    "an analysis has also recently been published  @xcite that determined what fraction of @xmath34 can be described classically , thus there is a hierarchy between classical , quantum , and quantum - gravitational predictions .",
    "the above approach opens a new avenue to measure planck - scale effects in a low - energy regime on a table - top and it is highly desirable to enhance the sensitivity of the scheme to more deeply explore the gup parameter regime .",
    "also , the coupling strengths currently available in solid - state implementations of optomechanics are small , i.e. @xmath35 , which limit the signal strength .",
    "further , as noted in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , if the modified commutators are first applied to the `` fundamental degrees of freedom '' ( which have to be specified independently of the model , e.g. atoms or elementary particles ) , then the resultant commutator and gup effects for the macroscopic objects are suppressed ( we will comment more on this in the concluding section ) . thus , any enhancement in the potential signal strength will greatly help to determine the magnitude of any gup correction to standard quantum mechanics and , indeed , also to which degree - of - freedom such a deformation should apply . in this section ,",
    "we show that such amplifications are possible by repeating the four - pulse - sequence over @xmath36-cycles . as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : four - displacement_operator ] ) , after @xmath36-cycles , the four - pulse operator would simply be @xmath37 , when neglecting deleterious effects such as changes in the pulse shape , optical losses , or decoherence . in the following sub - sections , we compute this operator for standard quantum mechanics , the linear and quadratic gup , and only quadratic and the higher - order gups . in all of these cases",
    "we assume that the photon number per pulse is large .",
    "since it follows from the unmodified @xmath38 $ ] commutator that @xmath39 , after @xmath36-cycles , one gets @xmath40 similarly , using the hausdorff formula , one gets @xmath41 and finally , using the following well known properties of coherent states @xmath42 one obtains for the mean optical field @xmath43      for the gup defined by the commutator ( [ comm1 ] ) , including linear and quadratic terms in momentum , one finds @xmath44 carrying on the analysis as in the previous sub - section , one now obtains @xmath45 thus , we can see that the desired phase @xmath32 is enhanced by a factor of @xmath36 .",
    "next we consider the original gup that was proposed by various authors , which consists of just the quadratic term in momentum in the rhs of ( [ comm1 ] ) . following the steps of @xcite for the operator @xmath24",
    ", we now find for the displacement operator , after @xmath36 mechanical periods , to leading order @xmath46 and the mean optical field @xmath47 with @xmath48      finally , for the gup associated with eq.([comm2 ] ) , following the steps of @xcite one has for @xmath36-cycles ( and for @xmath49 ) : @xmath50 } \\\\ & \\simeq \\langle { a } \\rangle_{\\textsc{qm},n } e^{-i \\theta(n ) } ; \\\\",
    "\\theta ( n ) \\simeq & n ( \\alpha m c)^2 n_\\textrm{p } \\lambda^2 e^{-i2n\\lambda^2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that this is also proportional to the inverse square of the planck mass .",
    "there are many sources of noise and imperfections , both of fundamental and technical origins , that can limit the ability to detect these potential planck - scale deformations .",
    "notable unwanted effects include the intrinsic optical quantum noise , additional ( classical ) optical phase noise , optical loss , and mechanical anharmonicity  @xcite .",
    "the signal @xmath32 then has to be compared to the sensitivity of measuring the optical phase shift @xmath51 .",
    "if we call @xmath52 the uncertainty of measuring @xmath51 , then @xmath53 is desirable . in an ideal experiment with no loss or classical phase noise with a coherent state of light with mean photon number @xmath30 and for @xmath54 independent runs of the experiment ,",
    "the phase uncertainty is given by @xmath55 .",
    "it is important to compare this uncertainty to the scaling of the signal , which we have shown to increase in proportion to the number of loops , i.e. @xmath56 .",
    "thus , the signal to noise ratio ( snr ) , in ideal conditions , becomes @xmath57 it is therefore advantageous to use more cycles @xmath36 over more individual runs @xmath54 of a single - cycle experiment .",
    "this is because @xmath36 amplifies the signal , while @xmath54 uncorrelated runs only reduces the uncertainty in estimating the phase .",
    "using @xmath36 cycles is advantageous if no deleterious effects are present .",
    "however , using several cycles can also increase the noise in the setup .",
    "thus , for some noise sources , the advantage may be negated , leading to an optimal @xmath36 .",
    "we anticipate that the primary noise source will be classical phase noise , which will reduce our ability to estimate the optical phase shift .",
    "we then have @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the classical phase noise . in any practical application ,",
    "the classical noise @xmath59 will increase with photon number and propagation time . at some sufficiently large @xmath36 or @xmath30 ,",
    "the noise is dominated by @xmath59 and the signal - to - noise ratio will reach a maximum . such classical noise is not fundamental , however , and can be avoided in principle , but it requires significant effort at large photon numbers . within the optical delay loops we anticipate high - frequency noise ,",
    "which is uncorrelated between loops , and lower frequency noise , which is correlated between loops . random , uncorrelated noise , will cause the classical noise to scale as @xmath60 , whereas the scaling of correlated noise may approach @xmath61 .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio then becomes @xmath62 where @xmath63 , and @xmath64 , parameterize the strength of the correlated , and uncorrelated , classical noise , respectively , in units of the optical quantum noise .",
    "the size of these terms will be strongly dependent on the experimental realization and in practice both terms will be present to some extent .",
    "examples of how the signal - to - noise ratio can scale is provided in fig .",
    "[ fig - snr ] .    ) , as a function of the cycle number @xmath36 .",
    "the upper trace is for the ideal case with no classical noise ( @xmath65 , shown in red ) .",
    "the two other curves show the effect of uncorrelated noise ( @xmath66 , shown in green ) , and correlated noise ( @xmath67 , shown in blue ) .",
    "a dashed line at unity is given to aid comparison . ]    using an @xmath36-cycle scheme has the additional advantage that one can now control the pulses within a sequence .",
    "two example types of control include displacing the pulse to modify is magnitude and phase  @xcite and changing the timing of the pulses to interact with a different mechanical quadrature .",
    "this can be used to better close the loop made in mechanical phase space in the presence of optical loss and thus reduce any unwanted residual correlations between the light and mechanics , which reduces the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "in the following we describe a protocol to minimize the effects of optical loss ( and related deleterious effects such as pulse shape distortion ) without full control of the timing of the pulses as that would require an efficient , phase coherent , tunable optical delay line , which would introduce unwanted experimental complexity . in this model",
    "we neglect the added optical noise due to the effective optical self - kerr effect , and the small change in the optical noise due to optical loss , as these effects will be small compared to the classical phase noise discussed above and the effects loss has on the mean of the optical field discussed below .",
    "then , optical loss can be described by a change of the interaction parameter @xmath20 after each pulsed interaction @xcite . for a single cycle ,",
    "the four - pulse operator for regular quantum mechanics becomes @xmath68 where @xmath69 a varying interaction strength thus not only changes the strength of the signal , but also introduces an unwanted correlation between the light and the mechanical state .",
    "for an initial thermal state @xmath70 of the mechanics with the mechanical thermal occupation number @xmath71 , the mean phase becomes @xmath72 \\\\ & = \\textrm{tr } [ e^{-(\\epsilon b^{\\dagger } - \\epsilon^ * b)n_\\textsc{l } } a \\ , e^{(\\epsilon b^{\\dagger } - \\epsilon^ * b)n_\\textsc{l } } e^{-i \\lambda_{\\epsilon}^2 n_\\textsc{l}^2 } | \\alpha \\rangle \\langle \\alpha | \\\\ & \\quad \\otimes \\rho_\\textsc{m}^{(th ) } e^{i \\lambda_{\\epsilon}^2 n_\\textsc{l}^2 } ] \\\\ & = \\textrm{tr } [ e^{i \\lambda_{\\epsilon}^2 n_\\textsc{l}^2 } a \\ ,   e^{-i \\lambda_{\\epsilon}^2 n_\\textsc{l}^2 } | \\alpha \\rangle \\langle \\alpha | \\otimes \\rho_\\textsc{m}^{(th ) } e^{\\epsilon b^{\\dagger } - \\epsilon^ * b } ] \\\\ & = \\textrm{tr}_{\\textsc{l } } [ a \\ ,   e^{-i \\lambda_{\\epsilon}^2 ( 2 n_\\textsc{l}+1 ) } | \\alpha \\rangle \\langle \\alpha | ] \\cdot \\textrm{tr}_{\\textsc{m}}[\\rho_\\textsc{m}^{(th ) } e^{\\epsilon b^{\\dagger } - \\epsilon^ * b } ] \\\\ & = \\langle a \\rangle_{\\textsc{qm } , \\epsilon } \\ , e^{-\\frac{|\\epsilon|^2}{2}\\left(1 + 2 \\bar{n } \\right ) } , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where we used the cyclic property of the trace and where @xmath73 . for @xmath74 ,",
    "it can thus be beneficial to cool the mechanical mode of interest .",
    "for the case of optical loss by a constant fraction in between each pulsed interaction , characterized by the intensity efficiency @xmath75 ( where @xmath76 is no loss ) , the strengths of each of the four displacements are given by @xmath77 , and thus @xmath78 .    ) , the first loop ( black arrows ) does not close and thus causes degradation of the signal as given by eq .  .",
    "two additional loops ( red dashed arrows ) bring the mechanical state back to its original position , thus giving @xmath79 for this particular value of optical loss .",
    "( b ) the parameter @xmath80 as a function of optical loss @xmath75 , as given in eq .  .",
    "a finite value of @xmath80 reduces the signal . ]    however , using a cycle of @xmath36 loops can reduce this deleterious effect , if one changes the direction of phase - space displacements after the first cycle . in the second cycle ( and",
    "all subsequent ones ) one can apply the following modified four - displacement operator : @xmath81 the sign of the correlating term is reversed , while the main phase has the same sign .",
    "this remains true for any commutator deformation that is of even power in the mechanical momentum .",
    "thus , if the above sequence is performed after the sequence given by eq . , the second displacement is subtracted from the first displacement while the signal adds up as in the ideal case : @xmath82 here we assumed loss by a constant fraction as above , such that @xmath83 . in this case",
    "the additional phase factor vanishes , which is otherwise @xmath84}$ ] .",
    "we can repeat the same interaction multiple times .",
    "after @xmath36 cycles in total one has @xmath85 and @xmath86 , where @xmath78 and @xmath87 .",
    "thus , for @xmath88 further cycles with the sequence given in eq .",
    ", one obtains ( without the commutator deformations ) : @xmath89 where @xmath90 if @xmath91 , the unwanted correlating term can therefore be made to completely vanish , see figure [ fig - arrows ] .",
    "depending on the value of @xmath75 , the additional loops given by eq .",
    "may overcompensate for the losses , in which case some of the loops could be performed in the original direction as in eq .  .",
    "for @xmath92 , the effect of loss can still be reduced with the above scheme . in this case the optical phase is still affected as in eq . , but with a new effective parameter @xmath93 .",
    "cavity optomechanics is well - suited to probe the generalized uncertainty principle ( gup ) for the centre - of - mass motion of a macroscopic mechanical oscillator . here",
    "we introduce a scheme to increase the sensitivity of measuring these possible deformations by using an extended sequence of optomechanical interactions to accumulate a greater signal . by analysing the phase - noise in this approach",
    ", we show where such a scheme is advantageous for the two types of noise anticipated . additionally , for a quadratic gup model",
    ", it is possible to reduce the effects of optical loss by reversing the direction of phase - space displacements after the first cycle . making the practical assumption that optical loss is constant between each pulsed interaction , this noise source can be mitigated .",
    "it was noted in ref .",
    "@xcite ( supplementary information ) and in ref .",
    "@xcite that if the gups were applied to the fundamental constituents of the mechanical systems ( notwithstanding the inherent ambiguity in defining such constituents ) , then the gup effects would get reduced by some power of the number of these constituents @xmath94 .",
    "for example , for the quadratic gup and a reduction linear in @xmath94 , one would obtain @xmath95 . with @xmath36-cycles however , this changes to @xmath96 , and thus , this reduction can be partially compensated by using multiple cycles . moreover ,",
