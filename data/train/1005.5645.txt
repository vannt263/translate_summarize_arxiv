    "physical understanding of astrophysical objects most often uses correlation diagrams . for early - type galaxies ,",
    "such scaling laws have been for instance established on one hand between optical luminosity and central velocity dispersion @xmath0 @xcite , and on the other hand between their effective radius @xmath1 and surface brightness averaged over effective radius @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "these correlations are rather tight , but the scatter is still reduced using a three - parameter relation of the form : @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this relation extends to faint and low - mass galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this is the fundamental plane ( hereafter fp ) of early - type galaxies .",
    "a long - running difficulty is the so - called `` tilt '' of the fp with respect to the `` virial plane '' obtained with the virial theorem and some simple assumptions about the population of early - type galaxies .",
    "indeed , this tilt is different for different types of galaxies , like disk ones ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "many studies have been devoted to this problem without a clear solution .",
    "the motivation is to obtain pure correlations both to constrain the models better and to use them as probes of characteristics which are difficult to measure or strongly biased .",
    "in particular , the fp could in principle be a powerful tool to measure distances .",
    "but a proper calibration is required , and this appears difficult with its different tilts depending on the galaxy populations .",
    "interpretation of the fp very often assumes some homology which is defined by @xcite as : `` systems with density , luminosity and kinematics structures equal over the entire early - type sequence and with constant mass - to - light ratios '' . @xcite",
    "define homology in such a way that the evolution of the fp is due only to the evolution of @xmath4 .",
    "these definitions are certainly linked to the assumption that all early - type galaxies are assembled in the same way , like dissipational mergers @xcite .",
    "reality is however more complicated ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and early - type galaxies are very probably not all the result of the same formation process .",
    "basically , what is needed is some invariant that allows us to trace a given object or class of objects through changes due to evolution .",
    "this invariant has been hoped to be the fp relation with some universality among a given population , universality which is implied by the definition of homology above and characterized essentially by @xmath4 .",
    "this provides a rough way of simplifying the many variables that can evolve and may hide important sides of galaxy evolution .",
    "models assuming only one homologous population have apparently failed to fit the fp in its entire extent .",
    "selection criteria were proposed in order to obtain more homogeneous samples and thus define what could be called a `` purer '' fundamental plane . however , these criteria are necessarily arbitrary , subjective and/or model dependent .",
    "the difficulty is that many parameters are known to influence the global shape of the fp .",
    "tilt of the fp @xcite , warps , dispersion , changes with redshift , dependence of the mass - distribution on mass @xcite among others , show that even though the fp looks tight in the @xmath5 , @xmath2 and @xmath6 space , additional parameters could still play a role .",
    "the universality of the fp is also questioned : is it a bent plane @xcite or a bent surface approximated by a collection of planes @xcite ? obviously , this problem is related to the choice of the sample , that is to the definition of homology .",
    "theorists cope with many parameters that may influence the evolution of a given galaxy , especially when mergers are considered @xcite .",
    "testing parameters one after the other , both theoretically and observationally , takes a lot of time , and might partly explain why after so many years , this tight correlation keeps most of its mysteries .",
    "we think that it is time to explore new methodologies to better characterize and understand the fp relation .",
    "multivariate clustering approaches are more objective in selecting really multivariate `` homologous '' sub - populations of galaxies .",
    "this requires to explicitly assume that the `` fundamental plane '' is a priori not universal , and to understand it as a correlation in the @xmath7 space that could depend on the sub - population .",
    "since galaxies are evolutive objects , homology can be more rigorously defined by similarity due to same class of progenitor. it is the astrophysical equivalent of similarity by common ancestry in cladistics , a statistical method designed to relate evolutionary objects and developed mainly by biologists .",
    "the use of many parameters is necessary to find the true homology , and to prevent analogy ( same characteristics due to convergent evolution ) to yield false lineages of galaxies .",
    "cladistics does not _",
    "assume a priori _ properties linked to homology , but rather relies on all the pertinent parameters to _ construct _ homologous groups .    in the present paper",
    ", we have performed multivariate classifications with two independent approaches , cluster analysis and cladistic analysis , of a carefully chosen sample from the literature .",
    "for this first kind of study , we consider only the three parameters of the fp , @xmath5 , @xmath2 , @xmath6 , plus @xmath8 that are all given for this homogeneous sample .",
    "the first justification is that the number of parameters is small , so it is not necessary to use pca because we can physically discuss the variation in the light of these few parameters easily .",
    "the second advantage is that we are interested to study the evolution of early - type galaxies in the light of their fp properties , and most of the authors have discussed evolution of galaxies on the basis of global fp .",
    "the first approach we have used is by a multivariate technique known as k - means cluster analysis using the parameters above .",
    "the second approach , known as astrocladistics , is based on the evolutionary nature of both galaxies and their properties @xcite .",
    "the clustering technique compares objects for their global similarities , while astrocladistics gathers objects according to their `` histories '' .",
    "the two techniques are indeed complementary , the first one identifying coherent groups , the second one establishing an evolutionary scenario among groups of objects .",
    "they are also totally independent , so that the comparison of their results is extremely instructive from a statistical point of view .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the data and the different multivariate analyses we performed are described in sect .",
    "[ multivanal ] .",
    "comparison of the structures resulting from these analyses , characterization of the fundamental planes of individual groups , evolution properties within the global fp and properties of the groups , are presented in sect .",
    "[ results ] .",
    "the discussion on the meaning of the groups we have found is given in sect .",
    "[ discussion ] , before our conclusion in sect .",
    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "we present detailed descriptions of the cluster and cladistic analyses respectively in appendix  [ appendclus ] and appendix  [ appendclad ] , and provide additional diagrams in appendix  [ otherfigures ] .",
    "for this first study , exploratory , it was important to choose the sample carefully to be able to understand the result .",
    "we first need a homogeneous sample , devoid as much as possible of systematic biases .",
    "we need to remain at low redshifts , but ideally integrating several clusters .",
    "we are limited in the number of objects in the astrocladistic analysis . at the current stage of development of this novel approach ,",
    "the reasonable limit is a thousand objects , and it is clear that a sample with @xmath9 objects is untractable directly .",
    "we thus chose the data compiled and standardized by @xcite for 699 early - type galaxies in 56 clusters , in the redshift range from 0.007 to 0.053 ( smac catalog ) .",
    "this sample has been carefully established in order to obtain distance estimates from the fp and study streaming motions in galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "the data include the three parameters of the fp space : @xmath1 in arcsec , @xmath2 in the r - band in mag arcsec@xmath10 , @xmath0 in km s@xmath11 , plus the fully corrected magnesium index @xmath8 for nearly all of them .",
    "distances were taken from the ned database ( @xmath12 km / s / mpc ) to compute @xmath6 in kpc .",
    "we performed analyses both with and without @xmath8 ( hereafter 4- and 3-parameter configurations respectively ) .",
    "we use this parameter as a tracer of the abundance of light elements . while it increases as nucleosynthesis proceeds",
    ", it may not evolve at the same pace as the metallicity ( measured by fe / h ) , because the light elements and fe are produced in different kinds of supernovae arising in stars of different lifetimes .",
    "however we are mainly interested in an indicator of chemical evolution , not in the detailed evolution of elements .",
    "no error bars were used in this analysis .",
    "cluster analyses do not accept missing values , so that they were performed with 696 galaxies in the 3-parameter case ( 3 galaxies did not have redshift hence distance available ) , and 528 in the 4-parameter case ( 171 galaxies without @xmath8 ) . the data for each parameter have been standardized to give them uniform weightage as we want to classify the galaxies considering all the parameters as equally important .    with the k- means algorithms @xcite ,",
    "we have obtained the optimum number of clusters given by the value of k associated with the largest jump and partitioned the galaxies according to this grouping ( see appendix  [ appendclus ] for more details ) .",
    "we used the 699 galaxies for the cladistic analysis because for missing values the algorithm simply guesses values that yield the most parsimonious diversification scenario . in this way",
    ", cladistic analysis also provides predictions for undocumented variables .",
    "the standardization is done automatically through the discretization of the variables ( appendix  [ appendclad ] ) .",
    "even though the four parameters show mutual _ observational _ correlations , they characterize a priori _ distinct _ and _ independent _ physical properties that are expected to evolve and for which some sort of evolutionary states could be defined .",
    "note that this holds even when the variables are physically linked by the virial theorem , because the virial equilibrium is a physical state that can evolve .",
    "these parameters are thus adequate for a cladistic analysis , in which case they are called `` characters '' .    the cladistic analysis yields trees from which groups can be defined .",
    "groups on a cladogram are theoretically defined as evolutionary groups ( or `` clades '' ) that comprise a node and all its descending branches ( see sect .",
    "[ structures ] ) .",
    "the identification of groups depends on the rooting of the tree , and must be analysed in regard with properties and other characteristics .",
    "the trees of the present study are rooted with objects or group of objects having low @xmath8 .",
    "objects can not reasonably be described as `` more evolved '' or `` less evolved '' than others because we do not have an evolutionary clock .",
    "in addition , the measure of evolution is a very difficult concept in a multivariate space .",
    "this is why `` diversification '' is a more appropriate term .",
    "a very basic illustration of this point on the hierarchical growth of dark matter halos can be found in @xcite .",
