    "a fundamental problem in analysis is the existence and/or uniqueness of the solutions to the equation @xmath1 in the unknown @xmath2 .",

    "is often too restrictive , and actually many applications arise in more general spaces .",
    "we especially think about injectivity and surjectivity problems in differential equations which are not discussed in this paper but constitute one of the reasons of our discussion .",
    "the books prodi and ambrosetti [ 31 ] , and chow and hale [ 9 ] , give the proof of global inversion theorems in general spaces and show applications to differential equations .",
    "let us also refer to invernizzi and zanolin [ 21 ] , brown and lin [ 6 ] , and radulescu and radulescu [ 33 ] among the papers which could be mentioned for results in differential equations obtained by means of the inversion of functions in infinite dimensional banach spaces .",
    "finite dimensional problems are also important .",
    "the research field of the jacobian conjectures deals with deep questions of invertibility linked to global stability problems , see olech [ 27 ] , meisters [ 23 ] , meisters and olech [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] , and the references contained therein .",
    "the inversion of functions , of course , also plays a role in the applied sciences , e.g. economics and network theory .",
    "more references are listed at the end of the paper with no claim to completeness .",
    "the present paper is not a survey on the rich literature on these topics .",
    "section 1 below is devoted to the following theorem which we call after hadamard and caccioppoli since hadamard was probably the first to have the idea in finite dimension , and caccioppoli was perhaps the most important author in the process of clarification and generalization to abstract spaces ( but other mathematicians also gave a contribution ) .    .",
    "let @xmath3 be a local homeomorphism with @xmath4 path connected hausdorff spaces and @xmath6 simply connected . then @xmath7 is a homeomorphism onto @xmath6 if and only if it is a proper function , namely if and only if the inverse image @xmath8 of any compact set @xmath9 is compact .",
    "the proof below uses , in a crucial way , the concept of @xmath0-limit set .",
    "this is perhaps the main novelty of our approach .",
    "the statements of the theorem in the books of prodi and ambrosetti [ 31 ] , and chow and hale [ 9 ] ( whose treatment of this topic is based on [ 31 ] ) , seem different from theorem 1 at a first glance since they mention possible singular points of @xmath7 ; however those statements actually follow at once from the one above .",
    "incidentally , those books state the theorem in metrizable spaces .",
    "we believe that the more general framework of hausdorff spaces does not cost more than usual presentations in metrizable spaces even if these are , of course , the relevant case for applications .",
    "and generality usually favours understanding the essence of a subject .",
    "the framework of theorem 1 is somehow essential , in particular it is false in non - hausdorff topological spaces as a simple counterexample will show .",
    "finally we show an application of the theorem to algebra , due to gordon .",
    "namely we show , following [ 14 ] , that there can not be a product in @xmath5 for @xmath10 ( see proposition  1.3 below for a precise formulation ) .",
    "this is related to the fact that @xmath11 is simply - connected if and only if @xmath10 .",
    "we quote this application to convince the reader of the depth of the hadamard - caccioppoli theorem in a concise way .",
    "in section 2 we deal with local homeomorphisms @xmath12 from an open connected set of a banach space @xmath13 to a banach space @xmath6 . in order to briefly mention the ideas discussed there ,",
    "let us here refer to the particular case of a local diffeomorphism @xmath7 .",
    "then the celebrated waewski equation with parameter @xmath14 ,    @xmath15    is often used in the literature to deal with invertibility problems .",
    "waewski introduced ( 0.1 ) in [ 40 ] , for @xmath16 , to give an estimate for a ball , around a given point @xmath17 , where the inverse function can be defined .",
    "instead of ( 0.1 ) we consider @xmath18 whose trajectories are also trajectories of the family of equations ( 0.1 ) ( as @xmath19 ) but with different parametrization ( incidentally , remark that the family ( 0.1 ) has many more trajectories ) .",
    "the point @xmath20 is an asymptotically stable equilibrium for ( 0.2 ) and its attraction basin @xmath21 will be proved to coincide with the maximal open subset of @xmath22 , containing @xmath20 , such that @xmath23 is injective and , at the same time , the image @xmath24 is star - shaped with respect to @xmath25 . using these ideas we show some criteria for the injectivity of @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , we shall see that the solutions to the equation ( 0.2 ) are all defined on the whole @xmath26 if and only if @xmath7 is a global homeomorphism onto @xmath6 .",
    "in particular , this fact leads to the following :    let @xmath3 be a local diffeomorphism with @xmath4 banach spaces . then @xmath7 is a diffeomorphism onto @xmath6 if there exists a continuous ( weakly ) increasing map @xmath27 such that    @xmath28    in particular this holds if , for some @xmath29 , we have @xmath30    this theorem was discovered by hadamard in @xmath31 .",
    "then it was generalized by levy to infinite dimension under condition ( 0.4 ) with   @xmath32 .",
    "meyer dealt with the full condition ( 0.4 ) , and finally plastock gave a proof for the general statement . in the literature",
    "it is often named after hadamard only .",
    "finally , we deal with the injectivity of @xmath7 ( together with the star - shape of the image ) by means of global lyapunov functions .",
    "we extend to general banach spaces some results previously obtained in [ 17 ] by two of the authors for @xmath31 .",
    "our approach to the invertibility of functions , by means of attraction basins for ( 0.2 ) , is one of the ingredients used in [ 26 ] by meisters and olech to prove one of the results in that paper , namely the global asymptotic stability for certain polynomial vector fields .",
    "we hope that it can lead to further consequences , in particular for the differential equations .",
    "in this section @xmath33 will always be topological hausdorff spaces .    .",
    "as is well known the function @xmath3 is called a local homeomorphism at @xmath34 if there exist open neighbourhoods @xmath35 of @xmath20 and @xmath25 respectively , such that @xmath36 and the restriction @xmath37 is a homeomorphism . then @xmath38 is called a local inverse of @xmath7 at @xmath39 .",
    "moreover we say that @xmath3 is a local homeomorphism if it is a local homeomorphism at any @xmath40 .",
