    "the peccei - quinn ( pq ) mechanism and concomitant axion is arguably the most plausible explanation for the smallness of the @xmath7 parameter of qcd  @xcite .",

    "likewise , the possibility of a massless up - quark is now convincingly excluded  @xcite , leaving few credible alternatives to the pq mechanism .",
    "perhaps the greatest advantage of the pq mechanism is that it can be verified by the detection of axions .",

    "a series of overlapping experimental and astrophysical constraints suggests @xmath18  gev @xcite , so axions are very light and `` invisible , '' in any case far more elusive than neutrinos",
    ".    however , during the qcd epoch of the early universe , a non - thermal mechanism produces axions as nonrelativistic coherent field oscillations that can play the role of cold dark matter  @xcite . in terms of the initial `` misalignment angle '' @xmath19 relative to the cp - conserving minimum of the axion potential ,",
    "the cosmic axion density is  @xcite @xmath20 if @xmath21 is of order unity , axions provide the dark matter of the universe if @xmath22  gev ( @xmath23 ) . as such",
    "they can be detected by experiments that exploit the generic axion ",
    "two photon interaction , allowing for the coherent conversion into excitations of a high - quality microwave cavity placed in a strong @xmath24-field  @xcite .",

    "would both reveal the nature of dark matter and verify the pq mechanism for cp symmetry restoration .",
    "meanwhile one may study other `` windows of opportunity '' where axions could leave a detectable trace .",

    "if future surveys were to reveal a hot dark matter fraction beyond the minimal neutrino component , an axion interpretation would be conceivable .",
    "we consider here axions in another range beyond the classical cosmological window . in a scenario where the pq symmetry is not restored during or after inflation",

    "postulating @xmath30 may look like shuffling the qcd problem of a small @xmath7 parameter into an unnatural initial condition for our universe .",
    "however , a gut - scale value of @xmath41  gev would only require a modest fine - tuning of @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "more importantly , anthropic selection suggests that the cosmic baryon / dark matter ratio can not be too small , so for any @xmath43 the most probable value for @xmath44 is near the one required for the observed dark - matter density  @xcite .    following these papers",
    "we emphasise that in our late - inflation scenario @xmath44 , and therefore the axion dark matter density , is an environmental parameter of our universe , not a fundamental one , and that its prior probability distribution is known to be flat on the interval @xmath29 .",
    "this contrasts with typical other cases of anthropic reasoning where usually it is not known if a given cosmological or particle - physics parameter is fundamental or environmental . in the axion case anthropic reasoning",
    "is unavoidable to quantify if a given value of @xmath44 is natural or not .",
    "therefore , the `` anthropic axion window '' with @xmath0  gev is well motivated . in this case @xmath45ev and axion dark matter is difficult to detect with the cavity technique because of the large required cavity size and magnetic field region .",
    "an alternative signature is provided by primordial isocurvature fluctuations that can show up in future data . in our late - inflation scenario ,",
    "the massless axion field is present during inflation and thus acquires the usual amplitude fluctuations imprinted by the de  sitter expansion .",
    "when axions acquire a mass during the qcd epoch , these fluctuations become dynamically relevant in the form of isocurvature fluctuations that are uncorrelated with the adiabatic fluctuations inherited by all other matter and radiation from the inflaton field .",
    "the isocurvature amplitude depends on both @xmath5 and @xmath46 , the hubble parameter during inflation , so observational limits on isocurvature fluctuations exclude certain regions in this parameter space @xcite .",
    "since there is no trace of isocurvature fluctuations in existing data , perhaps a more interesting question is the remaining window for axions to show up in future .",
    "one forecast was recently provided by the cmbpol study team collaboration  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of our paper is to provide a more detailed sensitivity forecast on the amplitude of isocurvature fluctuations .",
    "we explore possible degeneracies that may exist between the isocurvature fluctuations and other cosmological parameters in both present and future data , and determine the region in the underlying axion parameter space that is realistically within the reach of future cosmological probes .    to this end",

    "to specify the cosmological imprint of axions we begin with their contribution to the matter density of the present - day universe .",
    "when the pq symmetry breaks at some large temperature @xmath47 , the relevant higgs field will settle in a minimum corresponding to @xmath19 , where @xmath48 .",
    "we assume that this happens before cosmic inflation , so throughout our observable universe we have the same initial condition except for fluctuations imprinted by inflation itself .",
    "when the universe cools and evolves towards the qcd epoch , instanton effects become important and produce a potential for the axion field .",
    "the corresponding temperature - dependent axion mass is  @xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 , assuming @xmath54 .",

    "together equations  ( [ eq : mass ] ) and ( [ eq : hubble ] ) give @xmath62 we see that the limit @xmath63 is only relevant for @xmath64 .",
    "we will usually focus on @xmath5 values around or below @xmath65 and therefore concentrate on the case where the axion field begins oscillating during the qcd epoch .",
    "the traditional calculation of the present - day axion density  @xcite was recently revisited in detail , taking into account modern values for the relevant qcd parameters and anharmonic corrections for the axion potential  @xcite . however , since we are interested in the anthropic axion window where the initial misalignment angle is small , anharmonic effects are not important .",
    "we also ignore the possibility of axion dilution by late entropy production , so @xmath66 here , the initial misalignment angle @xmath44 is to be interpreted as the average in our hubble volume , @xmath67 , while @xmath68 is the inflation - induced variance , with @xmath6 the hubble parameter during inflation . in other words ,",
    "the relevant initial parameter is @xmath69 .",
    "we will usually assume that all of the cold dark matter consists of axions , so according to current cosmological data @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "assuming @xmath71 is small , we then find @xmath72 as a unique relationship between the initial misalignment angle and the axion decay constant .",
    "since the axion is essentially massless during inflation , quantum fluctuations are imprinted on the axion field in the same manner that the inflaton field acquires its perturbations . because of the axion s negligible contribution to the total energy budget of the universe during inflation , these fluctuations do not perturb the total energy density and manifest themselves only as perturbations in the ratio of axion number density to entropy density , i.e. , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 . for this reason they are known as entropy or isocurvature perturbations . as the axion field provides some or all of the cold dark matter of the universe , these perturbations contribute to the temperature and polarisation fluctuations in the cmb .",
    "axion - induced isocurvature fluctuations are uncorrelated with the adiabatic fluctuations inherited by other matter and radiation components from the inflaton .",
    "the spectrum of entropy perturbations  is @xmath75 assuming @xmath76 has a gaussian distribution , the perturbation power spectrum can be written  as @xmath77 where @xmath44 and @xmath78 are the mean and the variance of the initial @xmath7 distribution .",
    "as we shall see later , for all of the viable parameter space , @xmath79 , thus @xmath80 in the second equality we have approximated the power spectrum by a power law with spectral index @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the first inflationary slow - row roll parameter and @xmath83 the pivot scale .",
    "likewise , adiabatic perturbations sourced by the inflaton field are encoded in the curvature power spectrum , @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the adiabatic spectral index .    because fluctuations of the axion field are uncorrelated with those of the inflaton field ,",
    "the primordial scalar power spectrum is simply the incoherent sum of the adiabatic and isocurvature perturbation spectra , @xmath86 the resulting cmb temperature and polarisation anisotropy spectra are given by a similar sum , but with the appropriate transfer functions @xmath87 folded in ( @xmath88 ) , @xmath89 here it is useful to define the isocurvature fraction @xmath90 , @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the amplitude of the total primordial scalar power spectrum at the pivot scale @xmath93 , and we have assumed @xmath94 .",
    "given @xmath95 , the solution @xmath96 can not be realised . in the opposite limit @xmath97",
    "we find @xmath98 where we have used equation  ( [ eq : omc ] ) .      the misalignment mechanism _ per se _",
    "does not produce gravity waves .",
    "however , all inflationary scenarios produce some amount of tensor perturbations , which is in principle manifest in the cmb temperature and polarisation anisotropies .",
    "the quantity of interest is the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath99 , defined as the ratio of the primordial tensor to the scalar perturbation spectrum at @xmath100 .",
    "the amplitude of tensor perturbations from inflation is @xmath101 .",
    "thus , the hubble expansion rate during inflation @xmath102 is directly probed by a measurement of @xmath103 .",
    "to discuss the observational imprint in the cmb we recall that the axion field causes scale - invariant cdm isocurvature fluctuations that are uncorrelated with the dominant inflaton - induced adiabatic fluctuations .",
    "compared to adiabatic initial conditions , the growth of isocurvature cdm density perturbations with wavenumber @xmath104 is suppressed by a factor of @xmath105 on sub - horizon scales @xcite . hence ,",

    "a non - detection of isocurvature modes by planck would improve the limit to @xmath148 , while an ultimate cmb probe limited only by cosmic variance in both temperature and @xmath4-polarisation up to @xmath149 could reach @xmath150 , about a factor of five more restrictive than current limits .",
    "these forecasts agree roughly with previous estimates , notably by the cmbpol collaboration  @xcite .",
    "the small differences are probably due to their using fisher - matrix techniques in contrast to our full - fledged analysis of mock data sets .",
    "we emphasise that the cvl sensitivity to @xmath90 is essentially `` as good as it gets '' , since all relevant degeneracies have been lifted and no other cosmological probe besides the cmb is directly sensitive to isocurvature fluctuations . in terms of the axion decay constant @xmath5 , the cosmic - variance limited probe shifts the sensitivity region by approximately a factor of five for some fixed hubble parameter during inflation @xmath6 , and thus opens a sliver of parameter space where axions can still leave a detectable imprint in the microwave sky .",
    "if a tentative signal were found , an experimental search for axion dark matter in this parameter range would be crucial , yet technologically challenging .",
    "the idea of dark - matter axions with @xmath5 at the gut scale or larger has received relatively little attention , at least from the perspective of experimental searches , because the initial misalignment angle would have to be much smaller than unity . however , in our late - inflation scenario the axion dark matter density is fixed by the random number @xmath29 with a flat prior distribution . in this case",
    "anthropic selection is practically unavoidable and implies that the required small @xmath44 value is not unnatural .",
    "therefore , as stressed by previous authors , the anthropic axion window is a plausible parameter range . in the absence of direct experimental searches in this window ,",
    "the appearance of isocurvature fluctuations is the only opportunity for axions to become visible in this scenario .",
    "however , in view of the fundmental limitations posed by cosmic variance on all cosmological probes , a large chunk of parameter space in @xmath5 and @xmath6 will likely remain unreachable by this method .",
