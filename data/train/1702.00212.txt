    "it can be seen from fig .",

    "general considerations to understand current waveforms follow from shochley - ramo theorem @xmath58 . decreasing / increasing current shows on decreasing / increasing electric field in a positive / negative space charge at cathode / anode . the space charge at anode forms weak current response at @xmath59  0v and it causes current shoulder for early time of charge collection .",
    "the dominant signal at the charge collection time for @xmath60  0 is caused by accelerated electrons in a spatially modulated electric field by inter - grid bias @xmath20 .",
    "more specifically , we have shown that the cathode bias increases the peak current response .",
    "it also increases the initial signal caused by positive space charge at the cathode  [ fig1 ]  ( b ) .",
    "this can lead to spurious signal leading to low energy spectral shoulder in x ray spectra . at the same time , since the charge is swept faster through detector bulk , there is lower probability for carrier trapping and detector polarization .",
    "the lowest doping density is still the ultimate option here because it worsens the charge collection efficiency .",
    "the effect of diffusion is twofold .",
    "first , the higher is diffusion / mobility , the faster is a response time at a given detector size .",
    "second , as absorption efficiency increases with detector size , diffusion lowers the signal .",
    "hence , for fast response and strong current signal , thinner detector is acceptable .",
    "we also point out that thinner detector volume also eliminates carrier trapping .",
    "the optimal detector thickness and coplanar grid dimensions can be established for differential signal sensing .",
    "the final peak width in the case of differential sensing is caused by space charge at the anode , grid size ( signal increases for denser anode grid ) and by carrier diffusion .",
    "low diffusion rate also leads to better signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the diffusion length on a distance of detector size should be smaller than anode intergrid spacing .",
    "if diffusion length is comparable or larger than the anode intergrid spacing , the cg and ncg diffusion dominated current will be equal , and , differential signal will be negligible . the shielding has been shown to improve the current waveforms in a solely drift model , as shown experimentally  @xcite .",
    "it improves signal to noise ratio , deceases the initial spurious signal caused by positive space charge at the cathode and eliminates noise from the external detector environment .",
    "contrary to that , it slows the detector response time by about @xmath61 and directs carriers into one single conducting channel inside detector .",
    "the channeling effect leads to increased diffusion and electron repulsion even for intermediate times before charge collection .",
    "next , further simplifications of the proposed numerical model are discussed .",
    "it is shown that many current waveform characteristics can be explained separately one by one using simple physical considerations .",
    "these are based on electrostatic potential spatial distribution of the space charge in bulk semiconductor and assuming proper scaling of charge - to - electrode distance .",
    "if charge is close to planar cathode with respect to the cathode dimension , the electric field can be considered constant and electrostatic potential linearly scales with distance from cathode . in the presence of space charge below cathode and charge - cathode proximity , the field scales linearly and electrostatic potential quadratically with the charge - cathode distance .",
    "the schockley - ramo theorem than gives quadratic current waveform .",
    "the situation at the anode has to be split into two regimes .",
    "when electron is far from anode compared to the anode dimension , the electric field can be tought as that of charged wire .",
    "the intergrid potential difference will be negligible and the electron effectively moves in the effective electric field given by mean potential on cg and ncg anode .",
    "this mean potential influences the transient time by the order of 100d / l  % , where d is anode width and l is a detector thickness .",
    "when electron approaches anode on a distance much smaller than anode width , the situation becomes equal to the one at cathode in close charge - cathode proximity .",
    "the iterative schemes can be applied to describe analytically field profiles through whole detector volume .",
    "deviations from these assumptions lead to another model parameters .",
    "we have studied negative space charge below anode as one example and discussed diffusion due to localized carriers in one narrow potential minimum when shielding is applied as a second example of these deviations . the first additional parameter is easily taken into account in our drift model , the second one exceeds our model limitations .",
    "the proper treatment of the latter case has to be solved by coupled set of drift - diffusion , continuity and poisson equation .",

    "we have simplified the model even more based on our experience from the numerical simulations .",
    "the simplified analytical considerations have been shown to provide a fruitful insight into detector operation .",
    "the current waveforms were studied under varied doping density , positive and negative space charge , cathode and intergrid bias , diffusion length and detector shielding .",
    "the trends on how current waveforms are influenced by these parameters provide numerically insight on a detector optimization .",
    "a mutual influence of these parameters has been discussed and their possible contradiction was pointed out . finally , we have quantified increased efficiency of the commonly employed differential sensing in hard x - ray and @xmath6-ray detectors .",
    "the more elaborate extension of the work has been discussed in terms of nonlinear set of coupled drift - diffusion , continuity and poissons equation .",
