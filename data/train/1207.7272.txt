    "<S> one of the most well known relativistic field theory models is the thirring model ( tm ) . </S>",
    "<S> its realization can demonstrate the famous prediction for the renormalization of mass due to interactions . </S>",
    "<S> however , experimental verification of the latter requires complex accelerator experiments whereas analytical solutions of the model can be extremely cumbersome to obtain . in this work , following feynman s original proposal , we propose a alternative quantum system as a simulator of the tm dynamics . here </S>",
    "<S> the relativistic particles are mimicked , counter - intuitively , by polarized photons in a quantum nonlinear medium . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the entire set of regimes of the thirring model  bosonic or fermionic , and massless or massive  can be faithfully reproduced using coherent light trapping techniques . </S>",
    "<S> the sought after correlations scalings can be extracted by simple probing of the coherence functions of the light using standard optical techniques .      </S>",
    "<S> the thirring model is the simplest relativistic quantum field theory that can describe the self interaction of a dirac field in 1 + 1 dimensions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> various techniques have been developed to predict its correlations function behaviour with conclusive results only for the massless fermonic case @xcite . for the opposite case of fermions with mass , </S>",
    "<S> approximations involving the form factors approach have been developed for the n - point correlations whereas a full analytical solution still evades the efforts of seminal theoretical physicists @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the theory of the bosonic regime and the correlation function behavior is less developed with efforts mainly concentrated in the solving the classical case@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the possibility to physically simulate the thirring model dynamics in a different controllable quantum system is thus extremely interesting . </S>",
    "<S> an ideal quantum simulation should be capable of reproducing on demand the bosonic or the fermionic cases with tunable interactions and mass terms . </S>",
    "<S> in addition direct access to the correlation function behaviour will be an advantage . </S>",
    "<S> such a system would not only shed light in the unknown parts of the thirring model itself , but motivate works for probing of the behaviour of other relativistic quantum field theories which are beyond the realm of numerical and experimental techniques . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we describe exactly such a setup where the tm is generated counter - intuitively in nonlinear optical system . </S>",
    "<S> here polarized photons are mimicking the behaviour of the relativistic fermions where interactions and the mass terms are generated and controlled using quantum slow light techniques .    </S>",
    "<S> recent works in quantum simulations of relativistic theories focused on free fermion simulations using cold atoms and ion systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an interacting fields proposal is described in a recent seminal work where fermions on an optical lattice are used @xcite and more recently a connection between a variational simulation of fields to a generic cavity qed setup was made@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the present work differs in many aspects to all previous quantum simulations . </S>",
    "<S> first and foremost it is not based on cold atoms or particles with mass in general , but on a fundamentally different and somewhat counter intuitive approach using photons in a nonlinear optical medium . in addition , our optical setup being a natural continuum system , has the ability to reproduce the continuous thirring model directly without resorting to a lattice approach . finally , both the bosonic and the fermionic cases can be generated by controlling the relevant optical interactions , and in both massless and massive regimes . in our proposal </S>",
    "<S> the relativistic dynamics ( linear dispersion ) and the necessary strong interactions are generated and controlled by employing electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) techniques @xcite.the scalings of the correlation functions of the tm , for any regime of interactions , could be simply probed by analyzing the quantum optical coherence functions of the outgoing photons as they exit the medium .    </S>",
    "<S> we start our analysis by showing the possibility to generate a nonlinear dirac type of hamiltonian using stationary polarized pulses of light . </S>",
    "<S> we then analyze the parameter regime to tune the system to a hardcore regime reproducing the ftm dynamics and continue by showing that both the massless and massive cases are reproducible . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude by discussing how one could probe the scaling of correlation functions for any regime of interactions and mass values using standard quantum optical measurements . in this last part </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate analytically for demonstration purposes the correlation function behaviour for the case of the massless fermionic tm where an exact solution is known . </S>",
    "<S> this could be used to gauge or first test our simulator before it is used in the territory of theories without known solutions .      </S>",
    "<S> our proposal is based on exploiting the available huge photonic nonlinearities that can be generated in specific quantum optical setups . more specifically , we envisage the use of a highly nonlinear waveguide where the necessary nonlinearity will emerge through the strong interaction of the propagating photons to existing emitters in the waveguide . </S>",
    "<S> recent efforts have developed two similar setups in this direction , both capable of implementing our proposal with either current or near future platforms . in these experiments , </S>",
    "<S> cold atomic ensembles are brought close to the surface of a tapered fiber @xcite or are loaded inside the core of a hollow - core waveguide @xcite as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ]  ( a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the available huge photon nonlinearities due to the ( eit ) effect can be used to create situations where the trapped photons obey tm dynamics .    </S>",
    "<S> we start by assuming two probe quantum fields of few photons each , labeled as @xmath0 , @xmath1 , are tuned to propagate in the medium . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2 will denote their different polarizations ( later to be representing the spins of the simulated relativistic particles ) . </S>",
    "<S> the waveguide can also be illuminated by two pairs of counter - propagating control lasers with rabi - frequencies @xmath3 with @xmath4 denoting right- and left - moving directions . </S>",
    "<S> the atoms placed inside or close to the surface of the waveguide ( depends on the implementation ) have a ground state @xmath5 and excited states @xmath6 and @xmath7 each of the probe pulses is paired with an appropriate classical field and is tuned to an atomic transition such that a typical @xmath8 ( eit ) configuration is setup ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(c ) and methods ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the process to generate the tm dynamics in our photonic system is as follows : first , the laser - cooled atoms are moved into position so they will interact strongly with incident quantum light fields as done in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> initially , resonant to the corresponding transitions , the classical optical pulses with opposite polarizations are sent in from one direction , say the left side . </S>",
    "<S> they are injected into the waveguide with the co - propagating classical control fields @xmath9 and @xmath10 initially turned on . </S>",
    "<S> as soon as the two quantum pulses completely enter into the waveguide , the classical fields are adiabatically turned off , converting the quantum probes into coherent atomic excitations as done routinely in slow - light experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we then adiabatically switch on both @xmath11  and @xmath12  from two sides . </S>",
    "<S> the probe pulses become trapped due to the effective bragg scattering from the stationary classical waves as analyzed in @xcite . at this stage </S>",
    "<S> the pulses are noninteracting with the photons expanding freely due to the dispersion . by slowly shifting the @xmath13-levels </S>",
    "<S> we show that the effective masses of the excitations can be kept constant whereas the effective intra- and interspecies repulsions are increased . </S>",
    "<S> this drives the system into a strongly interacting regime . </S>",
    "<S> this dynamic evolution is possible by keeping for example the corresponding photon detunings @xmath14  constant while shifting the @xmath15-level . </S>",
    "<S> once this correlated state is achieved , the counter - propagating control fields @xmath16 responsible for trapping the polaritons are slowly turned off . </S>",
    "<S> this will release the corresponding quasi - particles by turning them to propagating photons which will then exit the fiber . </S>",
    "<S> as all correlations established in the previous step are retained , the propagating wave packets will carry the correlation of the tm dynamics taking place in the medium outside , where they can be probed by appropriately placed photon detectors .     and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath17 enter the nonlinear waveguide with different polarizations where they are trapped and made to strongly interact . @xmath18 and @xmath19 are two pairs of classical lasers helping to trap and control the pulses . in this regime </S>",
    "<S> , the polarized pulses can be made to mimick interacting fermions of opposite spins following the tm dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the scheme is based in engineering the photons interaction with atoms in the waveguide using eit techniques . the appropriate relativistic dispersion relation and the relevant tm mass and interaction terms , </S>",
    "<S> are fully tunable by tuning optical parameters such as atom - photon detunings and laser strengths . </S>",
    "<S> once the strongly interacting regime is reached , the pulses can be released with all correlations established during the interaction period coherently transfered over to outgoing photon pulses . </S>",

    "<S> 2a we calculate and plot the ratio of their strength as a function of the controllable single photon detunings . </S>",
    "<S> we see that by appropriate tuning from the corresponding upper atomic states ( tuning the laser towards or away from the corresponding states ) the system enters a hardcore regime where the same species interaction is much larger than any other term in the hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> the particles will then behave as effective fermions in all aspects - identical density density correlations@xcite and spectra but different first order correlations due to the sign issue . </S>",
    "<S> we note here that as we will discuss later , our optical simulator will be naturally probing intensity - intensity correlations which nicely fits with the above point .    for this regime , we also calculate and plot the individual interaction strengths , denoted @xmath40 @xmath41 , as a function of the kinetic energy of the particles for the same values of the tunable optical detunings ( fig . 2b and 2c ) . </S>",
    "<S> we see that when the system is optically tuned to the hardcore regime , the intra - species repulsion is much larger not only the inter - species interaction ( fig2 a ) but the kinetic energy as well ( fig2b , c ) . in plotting ( fig2 a ) </S>",
    "<S> we have set @xmath42 with @xmath43 turned off . </S>",
    "<S> we note here the simple way of tuning the rest mass of the particles by simply controlling the connecting \" laser .     </S>",
    "<S> @xmath41 , as a function of the corresponding single photon detuning ]      in the following we describe how one could probe the scaling behaviour of the correlation functions and from that infer the model s properties and the fascinating renormalization of mass due to the interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we use the case of the massless fermionic tm as an example to illustrate our approach . </S>",
    "<S> of course in this case the spectrum of the model and the scattering matrix was explicitly evaluated by the bethe ansatz @xcite and is known . </S>",
