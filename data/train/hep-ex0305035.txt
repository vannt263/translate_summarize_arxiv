    "the decays @xmath14 and @xmath15 provide interesting tests @xcite of chiral perturbation theory , chpt . the dominant contribution to the @xmath14 decay",
    "is @xmath16 and can therefore be computed with reasonable accuracy in chpt .",
    "the @xmath16 term vanishes for @xmath15 in the su(3 ) limit .",
    "however large @xmath17 contributions mediated by pseudoscalar mesons @xcite are expected for @xmath18 with values depending on the amount of singlet - octet mixing @xcite .",
    "a precise measurement of the @xmath15 decay rate is also of interest in connection with the @xmath19 decay .",
    "in fact the absorptive part of the decay rate , @xmath20 , is proportional to @xmath21 .",
    "this constrains the dispersive part , @xmath22 and eventually the possibility of determining the v@xmath23 parameter of the ckm matrix @xcite .",
    "measurements of @xmath24 and @xmath25 have been recently published by the na48 collaboration @xcite .",
    "we describe a new measurement of @xmath26 obtained with @xmath27-mesons from @xmath28 decays at da@xmath3ne , the frascati @xmath4factory .    in da@xmath3ne the electron and positron beams have energy @xmath29 where @xmath30 = 12.5 mrad is half of the beam crossing angle .",
    "@xmath2-mesons are produced with a cross section of @xmath31 3 @xmath32b and a momentum of 12.5 mev / c toward the center of the rings .",
    "the center of mass energy , @xmath33 , the position of the beam crossing point ( @xmath34 ) and the @xmath2 momentum are determined by measuring bhabha scattering events . in a typical run of integrated luminosity @xmath35dt",
    "@xmath31 100 nb@xmath36 , lasting about 30 minutes , we have @xmath37 kev , @xmath38 kev / c , @xmath39 m , and @xmath40 m .",
    "the detector consists of a large cylindrical drift chamber , dc @xcite , surrounded by a lead - scintillating fiber sampling calorimeter , emc @xcite , both immersed in a solenoidal magnetic field of 0.52 t with the axis parallel to the beams .",
    "the dc tracking volume extends from 28.5 to 190.5 cm in radius and is 340 cm in length . for charged particles the transverse momentum resolution is @xmath41 and vertices",
    "are reconstructed with a spatial resolution of @xmath31 3 mm .",
    "the calorimeter is divided into a barrel and two endcaps and covers 98@xmath42 of the solid angle .",
    "photon energies and arrival times are measured with resolutions @xmath43 and @xmath44 respectively .",
    "the photon entry points are determined with an accuracy @xmath45 along the fibers , and @xmath46 cm in the transverse directions .",
    "a photon is defined as a calorimeter cluster not associated to a charged particle , by requiring that the distance along the fibers between the cluster centroid and the impact point of the nearest extrapolated track be greater than 3@xmath47 .",
    "two small calorimeters , qcal @xcite , made with lead and scintillating tiles are wrapped around the low - beta quadrupoles to complete the hermeticity .",
    "the trigger @xcite uses information from both the calorimeter and the drift chamber .",
    "the emc trigger requires two local energy deposits above threshold ( @xmath48 mev in the barrel , @xmath49 mev in the endcaps ) .",
    "recognition and rejection of cosmic - ray events is also performed at the trigger level , checking for the presence of two energy deposits above 30 mev in the outermost calorimeter plane .",
    "the dc trigger is based on the multiplicity and topology of the hits in the drift cells .",
    "the trigger has a large time spread with respect to the beam crossing time .",
    "it is however synchronized with the machine radio frequency divided by four , @xmath50 = 10.85 ns , with an accuracy of 50 ps . during the period of data taking the bunch crossing period at da@xmath3ne was @xmath51 = 5.43 ns .",
    "the @xmath52 of the bunch crossing producing an event is determined offline during the event reconstruction .",
    "the @xmath2-meson decays into @xmath53 @xmath54 of the time .",
    "the production of a @xmath27 is tagged by the observation of a @xmath55 decay . @xmath15 and @xmath56",
    "decay vertices are reconstructed along the direction opposite to the @xmath57 in the @xmath2 rest frame and required to be inside a given fiducial volume , @xmath58 .",
    "we call @xmath59 the ratio of interest . the numerators and denominators",
    "are found from :    @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the numbers of observed events and estimated background , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are respectively the trigger efficiency , the tagging efficiency , the acceptance in the fiducial volume and the selection efficiency for the two decays .",
    "the efficiencies @xmath64 and @xmath63 are equal at the few per mil level and cancel in the ratio @xmath67 .",
    "background and selection efficiencies must be separately determined .    for this analysis the drift chamber",
    "is used to measure the @xmath68 decay and to determine the direction of the @xmath27 , the calorimeter is used to measure the photon energies and impact points and to reconstruct the @xmath27 decay vertex by time of flight .",
    "the data sample was collected during 2001 and 2002 for an integrated luminosity of @xmath31 362 pb@xmath36 corresponding to the production of @xmath69 @xmath2 .",
    "details of the analysis can be found in reference @xcite .",
    "@xmath15 events have a very clear signature , being the only source of @xmath31 250 mev photon pairs that balance the momentum of the observed @xmath57 .",
    "this allows the use of very loose selection criteria . on the other hand @xmath56 , the dominant neutral decay ,",
    "is characterised by a large multiplicity of lower energy photons . the final error on @xmath67",
    "is dominated by the error on the number of @xmath15 events .    before full event reconstruction ,",
    "the data are passed through a filter to reject machine background and cosmic ray events . as discussed later",
    ", this filter has a modest impact on the events of interest for this analysis .",
    "@xmath55 decays are selected with the following requirements :    * two tracks with opposite charge that form a vertex with cylindrical coordinates @xmath70 cm , @xmath71 cm , and no other tracks connected to the vertex ; * @xmath72 momentum 100 mev / c @xmath73 120 mev in the @xmath2 rest system , and @xmath74 invariant mass 490 mev @xmath75 505 mev .",
    "the @xmath7 decay provides an unbiased tag for the @xmath27 when it decays into neutral particles and a good measurement of the @xmath27 momentum , @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the central value of the @xmath78 momentum determined with bhabha scattering events . the angular resolution on the @xmath27 direction",
    "is determined from @xmath79 events by measuring the angle between @xmath80 and the line joining the @xmath2 vertex and the @xmath74 reconstructed vertex .",
    "the widths of the angular distributions are @xmath81 , @xmath82 .",
    "the position of the @xmath6 vertex for @xmath15 and @xmath56 decays is measured using the photon arrival times on the emc .",
    "each photon defines a time of flight triangle shown in fig .",
    "the three sides are the @xmath27 decay length , @xmath83 ; the distance from the decay vertex to the calorimeter cluster centroid , @xmath84 ; and the distance from the cluster to the @xmath2 vertex , @xmath85 . the equations to determine the unknowns @xmath86 and @xmath84 are : @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the photon arrival time on the emc , @xmath89 is the @xmath27 velocity and @xmath30 is the angle between @xmath90 and @xmath91",
    ". only one of the two solutions is kinematically correct",
    ". the value of @xmath83 is obtained from the energy weighted average , @xmath92 where _ i _ is the photon index .",
    "the accuracy of this method is checked by comparing in the @xmath79 decays the position of the @xmath27 decay vertex measured both by timing with the calorimeter and , with a much better precision , by tracking with the drift chamber .",
    "the resolution function , @xmath93 , is determined with @xmath56 and @xmath9 events by the distribution of the residuals @xmath94 where @xmath83 is the average obtained with all the photons but the @xmath95 .",
    "we measure for the @xmath56 sample @xmath96 ( cm ) and for the @xmath15 sample @xmath97 ( cm ) .",
    "the @xmath27 fv is defined in cylindrical coordinates as 30 cm @xmath98 170 cm , @xmath99 140 cm .",
    "the fraction of @xmath6-mesons decaying in the fv is @xmath100 .",
    "the identification of the bunch crossing that originated the event is crucial to locate the vertex in space .",
    "an error by one bunch crossing period results in a displacement of the @xmath6 vertex of about 33 cm and decreases the probability of correctly associating the photon clusters .",
    "the bunch crossing is determined by identifying one of the two pions of the @xmath72 decay and by measuring its track length , momentum and time of flight .",
    "thus an error of one ( or more ) crossing periods can occur if there is an incorrect track - to - cluster association or the track parameters are poorly measured .    to minimise the number of events with an incorrect bunch - crossing assignment",
    ", we perform a consistency check of the time of flight of the pions along their trajectory @xmath101 measured with the dc , @xmath102 with the corresponding cluster time measured by the calorimeter , @xmath103 .",
    "requiring @xmath104 ns for at least one pion , the probability of correctly identifying the bunch crossing is @xmath105 .",
    "this additional cut retains @xmath106 of the original @xmath107 event sample .",
    "the probability of identifying the correct bunch crossing was measured with a sample of @xmath79 decays where the position of the @xmath108 vertex , @xmath109 , is reconstructed by tracking in the dc and the position of the two - photon vertex , @xmath110 , by timing with the emc .",
    "the difference @xmath111 is used to isolate the events in which the bunch crossing is incorrectly determined .",
    "the @xmath56 decay has a large branching fraction , 21% , and thus has very small background .",
    "given the large statistics we retain only 1 out of 10 decays .",
    "the selection of @xmath56 events requires at least three calorimeter clusters with the following properties      the main sources of inefficiencies are : 1 ) geometrical acceptance ; 2 ) cluster energy threshold ; 3 ) merging of clusters ; 4 ) accidental association to a charged track ; 5 ) dalitz decay of one or more @xmath113 s .",
    "the effect of these inefficiencies is to modify the relative population for events with 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 and @xmath114 , clusters without significant loss of efficiency .",
    "monte carlo simulation shows that the selection efficiency is @xmath115 .",
    "a comparison between data and monte carlo of the relative populations and of the distribution of the total energy , @xmath116 , shows that only events with 3 and 4 clusters are contaminated by background .",
    "this is due to @xmath79 decays where one or two charged pions produce a cluster not associated to a track and neither track is associated to the @xmath6 vertex or to @xmath117 decays , possibly in coincidence with machine background particles ( @xmath118 or @xmath119 ) that shower in the qcal and generate soft neutral particles .    to reduce this background , for the 3-cluster population we further require at least two clusters in the barrel with at least one of them with energy @xmath120 mev and for the 4-cluster population at least one cluster in the barrel with energy @xmath48 mev .",
    "the probability to have a cluster with @xmath121 mev has been evaluated using the 6-cluster events .",
    "the probability of having a given number of clusters in the barrel depends only on geometry and has been evaluated by monte carlo simulation .",
    "we obtain @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "additionally , an event with 3 clusters is accepted only if an additional cluster is found in qcal within a time window of 10 ns with respect to the @xmath27 decay time .",
    "the probability of such an occurrence is @xmath124 .",
    "the @xmath79 background is rejected by imposing a veto ( _ track veto _ ) on the events with charged tracks not associated to the @xmath57 decay and with the first hit in the drift chamber at a distance of less than 30 cm from the position of the @xmath27 vertex .",
    "the track veto also rejects about @xmath125 of the @xmath56 events with dalitz decays",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the distribution of the total energy for events with different numbers of clusters together with the results of the monte carlo simulation .",
    "the relative fraction of events is shown in table [ table1 ] .",
    "the difference between data and monte carlo simulation for events with @xmath126 5 clusters is due to split clusters .",
    "the contamination from accidental clusters originated by machine background is negligible .",
    "the residual background contamination in events with 3 and 4 clusters is evaluated by monte carlo simulation and amounts to @xmath127 and @xmath128 respectively . +        using the known value for the @xmath56 branching fraction",
    ", we obtain @xmath12 where the first error represents the statistical and systematic error on r combined in quadrature and the second is due to the uncertainty in the @xmath13 branching fraction .",
    "a decay width of @xmath132 ev is in agreement with @xmath17 predictions of chpt provided the value of the pseudoscalar mixing angle is close to our recent measurement of @xmath133 @xcite .",
