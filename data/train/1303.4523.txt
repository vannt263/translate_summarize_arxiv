    "the dissipative particle dynamics ( dpd ) simulation method  @xcite was originally developed to cover much longer length and time scales than in conventional atomistic molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations using a mesoscopic description of the simulated system  @xcite due to soft forces acting between large particles made of clusters of atoms . since its introduction about two decades ago ,",
    "several improvements and generalizations  @xcite have been proposed , making dpd method one of the mostly used coarse - grained approach in soft matter simulations .",
    "examples of such studies are microphase separation of block copolymers  @xcite , polymeric surfactants in solution  @xcite , colloidal suspensions  @xcite , and the structural and rheological behavior of biological membranes  @xcite . for many of these complex systems",
    "mentioned above , the electrostatic interactions play a vital role behind the key phenomena and dynamical processes .",
    "the inclusion of electrostatic interactions in dpd simulations is important to capture the long - range interactions at mesoscopic level of material description for many systems such as the conformational properties of polyelectrolyte brushes  @xcite and the formation of membrane - dna complexes in biological systems  @xcite .    however ,",
    "when electrostatic interactions are incorporated in dpd method , the mesoscopic dpd particles carrying opposite charges tend to form artificial aggregates due to the soft nature of the conservative interactions ( forces ) in dpd simulations . in order to avoid a collapse of oppositely charged particles onto each other , groot  @xcite smeared out the local point charge into grids around each dpd particle .",
    "he adopted a variant of particle - particle particle - mesh ( pppm ) approach , which was originally introduced for systems with electrostatic heterogeneities  @xcite , to treat separately the near and far field interactions between charge distributions .",
    "as the charge density distributions in the simulated system are affected by hydrodynamic flow  @xcite , this method provides a natural coupling between electrostatics and fluid motion .",
    "simulation results  @xcite demonstrated that this method is reasonably efficient in capturing important features of electrostatic interactions at mesoscopic level .    in an alternative approach , gonzlez - melchor  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite adopted traditional ewald summation method and slater - type charge density distribution in dpd simulations .",
    "this method allows a standard approach to calculate electrostatic energy and force of charge density distributions .",
    "although the inclusion of charge density distribution does not directly increase the computational cost in the ewald summation itself , this method becomes computationally more demanding than the one adopted by groot  @xcite .    in order to improve the efficiency and accuracy in treating electrostatic interactions ,",
    "we suggest here an alternative approach that allows fast calculation of electrostatic energy and force in dpd simulations .",
    "the enuf method , an abbreviation for the ewald summation using non - uniform fft ( fast fourier transform ) ( nfft ) technique , was recently suggested in our group  @xcite and showed excellent computational efficiency in atomistic md simulations . in our current work",

    "<S> the enuf method , _ i.e. _ , ewald summation based on the non - uniform fft technique ( nfft ) , is implemented in dissipative particle dynamics ( dpd ) simulation scheme to fast and accurately calculate the electrostatic interactions at mesoscopic level . in a simple model electrolyte system , the suitable enuf - dpd parameters , including the convergence parameter @xmath0 , the nfft approximation parameter @xmath1 , and the cut - offs for real and reciprocal space contributions , are carefully determined . with these optimized parameters , the enuf - dpd method shows excellent efficiency and scales as @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the enuf - dpd method is further validated by investigating the effects of charge fraction of polyelectrolyte , ionic strength and counterion valency of added salts on polyelectrolyte conformations . </S>",
    "<S> the simulations in this paper , together with a separately published work of dendrimer - membrane complexes , show that the enuf - dpd method is very robust and can be used to study charged complex systems at mesoscopic level .    ,    </S>",
