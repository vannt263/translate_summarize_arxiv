    "a lot of various resonant tunnelling structures ( rts ) are being investigated widely now .",
    "interesting results have been obtained with the use of rts s in combination with other semiconductor structures . in this paper",
    ", we consider a combination of two structures  a resonant tunnelling structure and a schottky barrier ( sb ) .",
    "such a proposal for embedding a rts inside the decay or depletion region of a barrier may be found in the literature . it may be noted that it is not too demanding for the fabrication processes , as well .",
    "such a barrier is often used as a convenient instrument for studying the characteristics of various electrical systems , including different types of rts s . @xcite",
    "have studied the effects associated with the electron reflection at the semiconductor - metal interface of a schottky collector .",
    "resonant - tunnelling spectroscopy of quantum dots has been performed in some works , e.g. , refs .",
    "besides , the sb s may be used for other purposes , as well . for example , the effect of replacing the usual collector of a standard double barrier resonant tunnelling diode ( dbrtd ) by a schottky layer has been studied @xcite .",
    "it was shown in these works that this could improve the frequency characteristics of the rts s . in the case considered in this paper ,",
    "however , the presence of the sb plays a fundamentally more important role in the electronic processes under study . in keeping with the current practice in studying device physics ,",
    "the quantum mechanical phase of the carrier wave function and the thermal ( phonon ) broadening of the resonances have not been considered in the calculations below , on the assumption that their effects are small enough .",
    "we have shown that an sb may work like a blocking barrier for the resonant tunnelling current in a system consisting of a metal and a semiconductor with a double - barrier rts ( dbrts ) placed in the space - charge ( or , the depletion ) region . as a result ,",
    "in some cases one may observe a very sharp ( jump - like ) increase , and in some other cases , a similarly sharp jump - like decrease in the total current through the structure .",
    "thus , we would like to point out that , besides the usual drop in current that is inherent in such a structure [ 3 ] , we focus our attention here to the additional possibility of realizing a steep nonlinearity in its current - voltage characteristics ( ivc ) .",
    "it should be clear from what follows that , depending on the parameters of the problem , the indicated nonlinearity may be manifested in both the forward and the reverse branches of the ivc .",
    "thus , the sb plays here a role akin to a regulator of the electronic processes in the structure and , in particular , it influences the observed shape of the @xmath0 curves .        we choose a symmetric double - barrier rts as the tunnelling structure , and insert it in the depletion region of a schottky contact . in the sequel",
    ", we refer to this as a rtsc ( resonant tunnelling schottky contact ) .",
    "the choice of the double - barrier structure is not fundamental .",
    "what is important is that only the following conditions be met : ( i ) the rts chosen must have at least one resonance level ( @xmath1 ) to serve as a channel for the current flow , and ( ii ) the size of the rts must be considerably smaller than the width of the schottky layer .",
    "then the magnitude of the @xmath0 response of the rts must depend substantially on its starting parameters , e.g. , the supposed position of the resonance level @xmath1 in relation to the top of the sb at the zero voltage bias @xmath2 ; @xmath3 ( see fig .  [ fig:1 ] ) . if @xmath4 and @xmath5 , then the difference between the indicated levels increases monotonically , and the ivc has the usual exponentially increasing form .",
    "a qualitatively different situation arises when @xmath6 and @xmath5 . in that case",
    ", the resonance channel for the current flow ( that of the rts ) is initially blocked by the sb ; and the current is governed by the non - resonant tunnelling of electrons and the flow component above the barrier .",
    "as @xmath2 is increased , the difference @xmath7 decreases , and at a certain voltage @xmath8 , a turning of the resonant channel of current passage occurs . this turning - on of the channel is accompanied by an exceedingly sharp rise of the current , and that is reflected in the shape of the ivc .",
    "thus , there is a substantial difference in the functioning of a standard dbrts and the system considered here . in the standard system , which is initially ( i.e. , for @xmath5 ) a symmetric structure , it is fundamentally impossible to have the conditions for a resonant tunnelling current .",
    "but , the rtsc is an asymmetric structure under an external voltage ( e.g. , @xmath9 ) and a tunnelling current arises naturally .",
    "we point out some additional differences reflected in the ivc between a standard dbrts and the structure investigated here .",
    "first , the collector and the emitter regions function somewhat differently .",
    "for example , in a standard dbrts , the collector plays the role of a reservoir capable of accepting electrons with any energy ( which come from the emitter ) . in a rtsc ( under a forward bias , @xmath9 )",
    ", the emitter is a bulk semiconductor region , while the collector is the contact electrode , which can receive only an energy - restricted fraction of the electrons due to the existence of the schottky barrier .",
    "next , one notes that the main electron emission in a standard dbrts takes place in the energy interval @xmath10 $ ] .",
    "but , in the rtsc structure , electrons driven at high energies ( due to the external field ) reach the collector .",
    "thus , the _ working _ energy interval corresponds , in a certain comparative sense , to _ hot _ electrons .",
    "ultimately , these differences give rise to some interesting features in the ivc of the resonant tunnelling structures .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to demonstrate the possibility of obtaining some extraordinarily steep ivc in a modern semiconductor structure .",
    "so , for simplicity , we have omitted from our considerations , such factors as the accumulation of charge ( coulomb effects ) , roughness of the surface , non - parabolicity of the dispersion relation , etc .",
    ", which should not influence the effect under study in a qualitative way .",
    "we should also point out that the results obtained in this study are valid in cases when the resonant tunnelling current exceeds the forward tunnelling current and the current at energies above the barrier .",
    "our comparison of these currents shows that the stated condition is well satisfied for a wide spectrum of parameters of the problem .",
    "we calculate the current density with the formula , normally used for structures such as the rtsc s , namely , @xmath11}{1+\\exp\\left [ { \\left ( { e_f -e - eu } \\right)/k_b t } \\right]},\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the planck constant , @xmath15 is the charge of the carrier ( an electron here ) , @xmath16 is its effective mass , @xmath17 is its energy , @xmath18 is the temperature , @xmath19 is the fermi level , @xmath2 is the external potential ( bias ) , and @xmath20 is the energy - dependent transmission rate . the quantity @xmath20 is expressed via the rates of transparency for the depletion region , @xmath21 , and that for the dbrts , @xmath22 . if the tunnellings through the dbrts and the sb are incoherent ( i.e. , statistically uncorrelated ) , @xmath20 is equal to the product @xmath23 .",
    "this approximation is correct when the mean free path of an electron ( @xmath24 in the semiconductor is less than the width of the depletion region .",
    "we note here the fact that the electrons with resonant energies @xmath25ev only , take part in tunnelling in the structure considered .",
    "these are energies of the order of the lowest resonant level in the dbrts for typical parameters .",
    "the dependence of the mean free path ( @xmath26 ) on the concentration ( @xmath27 ) of doped shallow impurities , at @xmath28 , are shown in the fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "this dependence is calculated using the data on the electron mobility for various @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the width of the depletion region @xmath30 on @xmath27 , @xmath31 is also shown in this figure using typical values of the dielectric permittivity , @xmath32 ( gaas ) , and the height of the potential barrier at the interface @xmath33ev .",

    "quantitative characteristics of this process are strongly dependent on the details of the potential structure given",
    ". we should emphasize here that the schottky approximation , widely used for the description of the potential profile ( homogeneously smeared positive charges with concentration @xmath27 ) , is improper for @xmath37 , because the width of the schottky layer becomes comparable with the distances between the impurity centres , @xmath38 .",
    "for this reason , we have justified the model description of a potential in a depletion region , based on the solution of the poisson equation , @xmath39 with the boundary conditions :    [ eq : bc ] @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the height of the potential in the depletion region at zero bias ( @xmath5 ) and @xmath42 is the surface defined by the eq .  .",
