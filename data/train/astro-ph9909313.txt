    "ngc 4527 is a nearby spiral galaxy ( table 1 ) , and has been classified as a starburst galaxy because of it s abundant molecular gas ( @xmath3 ) and high _ star formation rate _ ( young & devereux 1991 ) .",
    "however , young & devereux ( 1991 ) pointed out that the star formation rate per unit gas mass indicated by @xmath4 , the _ star formation efficiency _ , of ngc 4527 is very low compared with their starburst sample .",
    "what controls the star formation properties in the central region of ngc 4527 ? in order to address the relationship between the physical conditions of molecular gas and star formation , we have performed high resolution multiple molecular emission observations in the central a few kpc region of ngc 4527 with the nobeyama millimeter array ( nma ) .",

    "the co(1 - 0 ) map in figure 1 shows two outstanding features .",
    "one is the strong concentration of co emission toward the nucleus ( r @xmath5 5@xmath6 or 350 pc ) with a slight elongation along the major axis of the galaxy ( p.a .",
    "= 64@xmath7 ) .",
    "another feature is two offset ridges of co emission extends over r @xmath5 27@xmath6 ( 1800 pc ) along p.a . of 64@xmath7 .",
    "the overall distribution of the co in ngc 4527 is very similar to that of barred spiral galaxies , which shows two offset ridges at the leading edges of a bar with a central concentration of gas ( e.g. , kenney et al . 1992 ) , although the optical morphology can not make clear whether the presence of the bar ( table 1 ) .",
    "our co(1 - 0 ) map recovers about 80 % of a single dish flux ( young et al . 1995 ) .",
    "molecular gas mass estimated from the observed co flux is about @xmath8 @xmath9 , and the peak molecular gas surface density , @xmath10 , at the center is @xmath11 @xmath9 pc@xmath12 adopting a galactic co - to - h@xmath13 conversion factor ( @xmath14@xmath15 ) .",
    "this velocity width ( full width of zero intensity ) of 500 km s@xmath16 is the same as that of the single - dish line profiles obtained with the fcrao 14 m ( young et al . 1995 ) and nrao 12 m ( helfer & blitz 1993 ) .",
    "the distribution of the co(2 - 1 ) emission resembles the co(1 - 0 ) map , although the extended ridges seen in co(1 - 0 ) map ( r @xmath5 27@xmath6 or 1800 pc ) do not appear in this co(2 - 1 ) map .",
    "it is probably due to insufficient sensitivity of co(2 - 1 ) observations , and also the lack of short spacing .",
    "the summary of co observations are listed in table 2 .",
    "hcn(1 - 0 ) and hco@xmath0(1 - 0 ) emission concentrated toward the center have been detected .",
    "extended components correspond to the co ridges may be also seen in the maps , although the s / n ratios are insufficient to make detail comparisons .",
    "we assumed almost all the single dish flux is recovered in both hcn and hco@xmath0 maps , and the previous observations of hcn emission seems to support the validity of this assumption ( see helfer & blitz 1997 and kohno et al .",
    "we summarize hcn and hco@xmath0 observations in table 2 .",
    "the co(2 - 1 ) to co(1 - 0 ) integrated intensity ratio , @xmath17 , is a measure of dense gas fraction to the total molecular gas ( e.g. , sakamoto et al .",
    "1994 ) , and sensitive in a density range of about 10@xmath18 - 10@xmath19 @xmath20 .",
    "we convolved the co(1 - 0 ) map to the same beam size as that of the co(2 - 1 ) to calculate @xmath21 values .",
    "the peak @xmath17 of about 0.6 at the center of ngc 4527 is somewhat smaller than @xmath17 values(@xmath22 ) in the central regions of spiral galaxies ( braine & combes 1992 ) , suggesting a presence of a large amount of low density molecular gas in this region .",
    "note the observed @xmath17 could contain considerable error due to lack of single dish co(2 - 1 ) measurements , however .",
    "a radial decrease of @xmath17 may be apparent ; the ratio is about 0.6 at the center , while the ratio decreases to 0.5 at r = 6@xmath6 ( 400 pc ) .",
    "the hcn(1 - 0 ) to co(1 - 0 ) integrated intensity ratio , @xmath23 , is another measure of dense gas fraction to the total molecular gas ( e.g. , kohno et al .",
    "1999 ) , and sensitive in a density range of about 10@xmath24 - 10@xmath25 @xmath20 .",
    "the observed peak @xmath23 of 0.06 is significantly smaller than a @xmath23 values in starburst galaxies such as ngc 253 ( 0.2 @xmath26 ; e.g. , paglione et al . 1997 ; sorai 1997 ) and m82 ( @xmath27 ; shen & lo 1995 ) , and is similar to those in `` normal '' galaxies such as the galactic center ( @xmath28 ; paglione et al .",
    "1998 ) .      because stars are formed from dense cores of molecular clouds rather than their diffuse envelopes(e.g .",
    "lada 1992 ) , study of dense molecular gas is essential to understand star formation in galaxies . in fact , good spatial coincidence between hcn and h@xmath29 emission has been reported in nearby starburst galaxies ( e.g. paglione et al .",
    "1997 ; kohno et al 1999 ) .",
    "both @xmath17 and @xmath23 suggest that the fraction of dense molecular clouds to the total molecular gas in the center of ngc 4527 is smaller than that of prototypical starburst galaxies such as ngc 253 and m82 .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the fraction of dense molecular gas measured with the @xmath23 correlates with the star formation efficiency ( solomon et al .",
    "1992 ) , which is indicated by @xmath30 .    considering these results , we suggest that the small dense gas fraction is responsible for the low star formation efficiency in the center of ngc 4527 .",
    "but the star formation rate of ngc 4527 would be enhanced existence of rich gas in central region .",
