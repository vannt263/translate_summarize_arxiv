    "a number of galaxy clusters are sources of diffuse radio emission that can be classified as either radio halos or radio relics ( e.g. , feretti et al . 2012 , and references therein ) .",

    "it is possible that the extension of the radio emission seen towards the north of the cluster may be due in part to an unresolved cluster relic ; however , given the low significance of this protrusion we do not try to separate these features .",

    "these sources were used to solve for direction dependent calibration solutions before being subtracted from the visibility dataset . at the frequencies of our observations ,",

    "they might include atmospheric effects , pointing errors or dish deformation .",
    "a large variety of solvers have been developed to tackle these kinds of calibration issues .",
    "here we do not attempt to physically characterize the ddes but instead use a jones - based solver .",
    "this type of solver constitutes the most widely used family of algorithms for direction dependent calibration , and aims at estimating the _ apparent _ net product of the various effects mentioned above .",
    "recently , algorithms have been developed ( see e.g. yatawatta et  al .",

    "2010 ) , that estimate a jones matrix per time - frequency bin per antenna , per direction .",
    "the well known problems associated with this type of technique are ( i ) ill - conditioning and ( ii ) computational cost , both being due to the larger number of degrees of freedom used to solve the problem ( compared to the direction - independent case ) .",
    "the first of these issues can affect the scientific signal by suppressing un - modelled flux , while the cubic computational cost with the number of degrees of freedom can put strong limitations on the affordable number of direction - dependent parameters .    the jones - based solver utilized here ( tasse et  al .",
    "2014 ) is a dde variant of the stefcal approach ( salvini et  al .",
    "it operates using the concept of iteratively solving for linear systems in a similar manner to traditional non - linear least - squares solvers , but by using an alternative iteration scheme , significantly improving convergence speed and robustness .    for the data presented here , in order to increase the signal in each direction , we clustered the sources in 5 direction - based groups by using a voronoi tessellation algorithm and computed a scalar direction dependent jones matrix every 15 minutes .",
    "we verified that this strategy was not driving suppression of the unmodelled flux by using incomplete sky models .",
    "following direction - dependent calibration , point sources above a significance of 7.5@xmath6 were then subtracted directly from the visibility data .",
