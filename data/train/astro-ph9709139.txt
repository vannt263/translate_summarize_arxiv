    "spectra of the @xmath3 quasar pks 2126158 have been obtained at the eso ntt telescope in the range @xmath4   with a resolution @xmath5 and an average @xmath6 ratio @xmath7 per resolution element .",
    "12 metal systems have been identified , two of which were previously unknown . an enlarged sample of c  iv absorptions ( 71 doublets ) has been used to analyze the statistical properties of this class of absorbers . a full report on the data and an extended version of the discussion can be found in the paper @xcite .",
    "we have adopted as a statistical tool the two - point correlation function ( tpcf ) computed in the velocity space .",
    "the reference poissonian distribution of pairs is obtained by averaging 5000 numerical simulations of the observed number of redshifts , randomly generated in the same redshift range as the data , according to the cosmological distribution @xmath8 where @xmath9 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the tpcf for the c  iv clouds , in the range @xmath10 shows a strong clustering signal at small velocity separations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : corr2 ] ) while , at larger scales no significant signal is found . in the velocity interval @xmath11 km s@xmath1 ,",
    "66 pairs are observed , while @xmath12 are predicted for a homogeneous distribution , @xmath13 .",
    "similar results , with a significant correlation on scales up to @xmath14 km s@xmath1 , have been obtained in the works by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , carried out at comparable resolution .",
    "degrading the resolution to that of previous works based on larger samples ( @xcite ; @xcite ) a compatible result is obtained .",
    "correlations between total equivalent widths and number of components and between total equivalent widths and velocity spread of the individual c  iv systems are observed .",
    "the tpcf for lower column density c  iv absorption systems shows a weaker signal than the present data ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these three pieces of evidence suggest a trend of decreasing clustering amplitude with decreasing column density .",
    "an analogous behaviour has been observed for ly@xmath2  lines by @xcite .",
