    "detailed production values are obtained at the microeconomic level from precise bookkeeping required for taxation .",
    "they are integrated to the macroeconomic national level , carefully corrected for inflation , reduced to per capita values , and published in the national statistical reports .",
    "we use them of course .",
    "unfortunately there is no such method for quantifying the user side .",
    "its values are personal , partially emotional , and can not be added to the national level because they overlap in content and user time .",
    "this absolute problem of economics explains why the equilibrium between demand and supply could still not be quantified .",
    "there exists not even a compatible set of variables for both sides .",
    "these deficits allowed the growth fetishism and uncontrolled monetarism that caused the banking disaster of 2008 and the largest gap between public debt and private fortunes of all times .",
    "the other fundamental problems of macroeconomic theory are due to the fact that its conceptual frame was also derived from microeconomics .",
    "it began in 1776 with adam smith s invention of an `` invisible hand '' for achieving macroeconomic equilibrium [ 1 ] , and in 1803 with jean - baptiste say s unidirectional claim that every product creates its market [ 2 ] .",
    "the most elaborate frame was based on robert m. solow s neoclassical exponential growth theory of 1956 [ 3 ] .",
    "robert j. barro and xavier sala - i - martin presented a comprehensive quantitative analysis of neoclassical production functions and medium - term growth patterns [ 4 ] .",
    "it leads directly to the central issue for our physical theory .",
    "the neoclassical approximation uses the mathematical tool of partial derivatives with fractional exponents for optimizing the input variables labor and physical capital ( pc ) , the value of the technical infrastructure .",
    "but the condition sine qua non for using partial derivatives is the independence of the input variables , whereas successful nations can stabilize employment at half the population or about one person per household .",
    "this means macroeconomic employment is not even a variable , and the national value of paid labor can not be independent because the people must be able to buy the annual output called gross domestic product ( gdp ) .",
    "labor is the central quantity for any theory because in the end all economic values consist of labor , including pc and natural resources .",
    "annual working time is the last choice and a good variable for labor since it is nationally normalized across business sectors .",
    "but industrial experience shows that the employee s division of annual working time is designed into every piece of physical capital from ploughs to hospitals according to its operating conditions and the technical state of the art .",
    "this hidden relation between annual working time and physical capital is not only the key to a physically satisfactory theory of economic growth .",
    "simultaneously it will resolve the absolute problem of economics because in the end working time and gdp must depend on the user s demand and the producer s pc .",
    "but the relation s shape could not even be guessed because pc and gdp were too often reset by the civil war of the usa , both world wars , the great depression , oil price shocks , and recently by the financial disaster of 2008 .",
    "the next section shows that these disasters left hardly a trace in the long - term decrease of the working time from 18th century to date .",
    "pc has an effective lifetime against obsolescence and decay of about 25 years so that it needs more than one reproduction cycle for recovery to long - term equilibrium .",
    "the gdp will at first be dominated by this recovery , but thereafter obviously by a second storable quantity that controls the industrial evolution above all national disasters .",
    "identifying this quantity is the central issue for the physical theory .    discovering a hidden relation in a system with two coexisting dynamics but missing variables , parameters , and data for one of them seems difficult . but",
    "a standard method of physics postulates the existence of missing quantities , quantifies their properties and interactions , and confirms them with the agreement between all available data and the entire theoretical frame .",
    "the next section introduces the system s complete set of physical variables , sets up a continuously valid equilibrium condition between them , and specifies their initial and final states .",
    "section 3 quantifies the intrinsic feedback loops for both storable quantities .",
    "section 4 discusses the results .",
    "the physical theory s cultural variables derived and plotted without any adjustable parameter .",
    "the official data for the annual working time @xmath0 in the uk ( points ) and germany ( circles ) are in hours per week . the data for the life expectancy @xmath1 in years and the industrial evolution @xmath2 in 1000 us$ of 1991 p. a. per capita are shown in figure [ fig_4].,width=100 ]    figure [ fig_1 ] shows the official annual working times @xmath0 for the uk and germany from 18th century to date as examples of the first and the most unstable industrial nation , respectively .",
    "even world war ii left hardly a trace .",
    "this confirms the industrial experience that @xmath0 represents the state of the art of the industrial society s leading nations .",
    "it is anti - correlated with the other cultural variables .",
    "they are shown with their data in figure [ fig_4 ] .",
    "the maximum available working time per employee is 16 hours per day for 6 days per week or 96 hours per week .",
    "this was according to figure [ fig_1 ] also the official working time around about 1800 .",
    "since all macroeconomic changes are per year this annual maximum is the natural unit for measuring working time : @xmath3 the user side s natural counterpart of annual working time is annual spare time @xmath4 at home . in economic theory",
    "it does nt turn up because it has no economic value , but g7 affluence would be unbearable without the spare time for enjoying it .",
    "physically it is decisive since there is only one and the same time passing by for the sum of spare and working time : @xmath5 either a nation produces more or has more time to enjoy whatever it produces . in hindsight",
    "it is surprising that it took so long for replacing say s unidirectional theorem with a universal trade - off between both sides of the economy .",
    "the division of paid working time and unpaid homework is within most households on average socially balanced .",
    "the second long - term fact is also observed : decreasing working time means for a nearly constant employment level that an increasing part of pc is automated or operated only parttime .",
    "the gdp @xmath6 is , therefore , proportional to annual working time and the part @xmath7 of pc that is employed in production : @xmath8 this departure from the general rule of not splitting macroeconomic quantities is required for the total value @xmath9 of pc because the post world war ii generation produced an increasing part @xmath10 of pc for better living conditions at home . in the uk and germany",
    "this part contributes now about 40 % to the accumulated pc but after the year of construction little to the annual gdp .",
    "( [ eq_3 ] ) is not yet the required production function because @xmath0 can not be independent when it designed into @xmath7 . on the other hand",
    "there is no reason for assuming any non - linearity because there are no diminishing returns for supervised or operated @xmath7 .",
    "finally the unit chosen with ( [ eq_1 ] ) for measuring working time does not require an adjustable parameter since @xmath11 corresponds to the number of years it would take to produce exclusively @xmath7 with the same productivity of producing the gdp .",
    "the hidden relation between @xmath0 and other variables must be controlled by a second storable quantity that organizes and amplifies spare time for demand like @xmath7 organizes and amplifies @xmath0 for supply .",
    "this new quantity is the natural counterpart of pc .",
    "it was named `` human capacity '' @xmath12 [ 5 ] .",
    "like pc embodies the industrial society s technical knowledge by design , human capacity ( hc ) embodies the general knowledge distributed in every individual by education .",
    "hc includes also the heritable capacities like curiosity , talent , and limited adaptability .",
    "they have no direct economic value since they are provided without extra cost , but they are indestructible and physically as relevant as spare time .",
    "the educated values of hc per capita are also indestructible when education continues in times of war .    in analogy to ( [ eq_3 ] ) the user side",
    "is quantified with @xmath13 where @xmath14 is that part of hc that is actually needed for enjoying but possibly also limiting the useful goods and services of the gdp . improving and maintaining housing and working conditions ,",
    "public order and social security are as important for the existential conditions as classical consumption .",
    "combining ( [ eq_2 ] ) , ( [ eq_3 ] ) , and ( [ eq_4 ] ) yields the industrial society s equilibrium condition @xmath15 the trade - off ( [ eq_2 ] ) between spare and working time causes @xmath0 to appear also on the user side .",
    "this is the hidden relation .",
    "it connects demand with the required work for economic equilibrium , but also supply with the required spare time .    that this dual physical symmetry can not be expressed with production variables alone",
    "explains every problem encountered to date with macroeconomic theory .",
    "but a second asymmetry remains : pc can be duplicated fast just with money and work whereas hc can only be increased slowly because it requires research for new relevant knowledge and time for human adjustment .",
    "it is a simple exercise to generalize ( [ eq_5 ] ) for including the initial state @xmath16 as minimum condition for successful reproduction .",
    "then the generalized form of ( [ eq_5 ] ) reads @xmath17 .",
    "this includes the transition from medieval agriculture to the industrial society . resolving it for the dependent quantities yields @xmath18 and @xmath19",
    "since they are continuously measued the storable quantities follow from resolving ( [ eq_7 ] ) and ( [ eq_8 ] ) for @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath0 is plotted in figure [ fig_1 ] from ( [ eq_3 ] ) with @xmath22 us$ p.a . in us$ of 1991 and with the next section s results for pc and the gdp .",
    "after world war ii it agrees with @xmath23 obtained from the reported data for @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "( [ eq_8 ] ) is a valid production function and without adjustable parameter physically correct .",
    "hc and pc must increase together for increasing the gdp .",
    "the neoclassical phenomenon of diminishing returns does not exist since the amplification of both inputs remains linear .",
    "spare time , @xmath24 , and @xmath6 are just the winners of more pc and hc until hc limits the gdp according to @xmath26 the next section s comparison with educational data yields @xmath27 .",
    "an upper limit to hc per capita is physically inevitable since the human species is not omnipotent .",
    "this has nothing to do with money , global resources , or understanding and using the laws of nature .",
    "the only question is when and how the economy must yield to mankind s generic limit .",
    "it was raised and qualitatively answered in 1930 by john maynard keynes [ 6 ] .",
    "the next section gives the first quantitative answer .",
    "the preceding section quantified the generation of the gdp by amplification of spare and working time with actually required parts of hc and pc .",
    "this section quantifies the opposite processes , the generation of hc and pc from the gdp with parts of annual working time .",
    "this forms a pair of closed feedback loops .",
    "they stabilize peaceful medium and long - term economic growth .",
    "detailed bookkeeping uses the fiscal depreciation rates of pc .",
    "they allow tax - free maintenance of pc and stimulate economic growth because the time for total depreciation is on purpose shorter than the physical lifetime of pc .",
    "for instance , japan allowed writing off the full value of the pc used for research and development within the first year .",
    "economic theory uses the physical decay rate of pc because it means money .",
    "physical theory must use the inverse of the decay rate , the physical lifetime of pc against decay and obsolescence .",
    "storage times cause memory and different time dependencies between the stored content and its charging and discharging flows .",
    "this excludes the exponential function as legitimate growth law : it is the only function that can neither cause nor show these differences because it features unlimited exchangeability between amplitude and time .",
    "the physical lifetime of hc @xmath28 was named evolution constant , the physical lifetime of pc @xmath29 generation constant [ 5 ] .",
    "they are systemic constants of the industrial society and are directly measured with the national time shifts between gdp and pc according to the following theory and their agreement with the data .",
    "these lifetimes yield the parts of the gdp required for maintaining the values of the storable quantities with the maintenance conditions @xmath30 and @xmath31 they define the `` capacity function '' @xmath32 and the `` capital function '' @xmath33 .",
    "figure [ fig_2 ] shows that law and order , @xmath33 , and @xmath32 need over 50% of the gdp just for keeping the economy in operational condition .",
    "the educational data of japan were obtained from the reports of the japanese ministry of education [ 7 ] .",
    "they include every contribution from kindergarten to private schools and universities .",
    "the other data are obtained from the national economic reports .",
    "the law and order data include every relevant expense from the legislative to the military . that they are close to and increase with the capital functions is mainly due to the increasing inequality of the distribution of wealth .",
    "the plots for @xmath33 agree automatically with their data since the latter follow from the data for pc and gdp whose agreement with theory is shown with figures [ fig_3 ] and [ fig_4 ] .",
    "the following solutions apply to the industrial addition to the very small initial agricultural level @xmath34 . since most of the total cost and profit of @xmath35 appear also in its year of construction",

    "china has still one generation gap with comfortable growth rates ahead .",
    "when its demand for energy follows g7 history china will more than double the global annual consumption of fossil reserves until 2040 .",
    "replacement technologies will increasingly challenge the global research community .",
    "as the only alternative it is good to know that s - functions can also control reducing untenable levels of physical capital , especially for nations with decreasing population .    for two generations the g7 enjoyed peace on their soil .",

    "the long - term consequences of the monetary growth fetishism are still too opaque for prediction .",
    "but the total failure of the economically strongest nations to at least stop the saturation of their growth rates by capitalism s toughest experiments , and the cultural variable s immunity even to world wars , suggest that the process stabilizing and limiting the industrial evolution may be credited to the inherited component of human capacity",

    "otherwise the constancy of @xmath66 , of the related @xmath36 and @xmath95 , and of the related @xmath82 and @xmath58 over centuries and orders of magnitude in the gdp per capita would indeed require adam smith s invisible hand .",
    "the constituting property of the simple s - function ( 26 ) is the proportionality of its growth rate to the remaining part of its entire path .",
    "the proportionality constant is its growth parameter .",
    "it is the constant rate of decay of the inverse s - function to a minimum level of `` incapacity '' .",
    "a zero level would mean human omnipotence and unlimited exponential growth .",
    "but a system knowing according to ( 26 ) by its current growth rate continuously where it stands with respect to its initial and final state may be a priori programmed like reproducing life .",
    "this simple fact allowed life insurers predicting the life expectancy after birth better than any other long - term process could be predicted .",
    "so far they could only assume that both the biologic and the economic trend are stable and closely related .",
    "both processes have not only the same constituting property but also the same growth parameter and the theoretically expected precedence of the life expectancy .",
    "although the physical theory describes and predicts the peaceful economic growth without adjustable parameter the future of the industrial society is not as deterministic as individual life . the theory shows how mankind can use its long - term choice between producing more affluence with work and physical capital or pursuing happiness with spare time and human capacity .",
