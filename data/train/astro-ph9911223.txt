    "in the last 25 years , a large number of rotation curves were derived for spiral ( sp ) and dwarf irregular ( dirr ) galaxies from 2d kinematics obtained with synthesis instruments such as the westerbork ( wsrt ) array , the very large array ( vla ) , and the australia telescope ( at ) ( for a good review of the first 20 years , see e.g. ashman 1992 ) . in many galaxies , especially late  type spirals and dwarf irregulars ,",
    "the extends much further out than the optical and thus than the emission .",
    "an argument often used is that , since the rotation curve probes the gravitational potential in the dark matter dominated region , it is best suited to derive the parameters of the mass distribution and especially of the dark matter halo .",
    "however , as will be shown , the parameters of the mass models ( and especially of the dark matter distribution ) are very sensitive not only to the flat part of the rotation curve ( best probed by the observations ) but also to the rising inner part , which can by derived with greater precision using 2d h@xmath0observations ( see e.g. amram et al . 1992 , 1994 , 1995 , 1996 ) .",
    "this is also well illustrated by swaters ( 1999 ) who clearly shows the impact of varying the position of the first few velocity points ( within the uncertainties due to beam smearing ) on the parameters of the mass models even in the dark matter dominated dwarfs .",
    "what is now regarded as the classical method to study the mass distribution ( van albada et al .",
    "1985 , carignan & freeman 1985 ) is illustrated in fig.[fig : hi]a , which shows the analysis of the mass distribution of ngc 5585 using its rotation curve ( ct , carignan , & sancisi 1991 ) .",
    "see also begeman 1987 , broeils 1992 and ct 1995 for many more examples .",
    "first , the rotation curve is obtained by fitting a `` tilted  ring '' model to the velocity field in order to represent the warp of the disk , which is almost always present .",
    "the accuracy of the model representation is then checked by looking at the residual ( data @xmath4 model ) map ( warner 1973 , sancisi & allen 1979 ) .",
    "then the luminosity profile in the reddest band available to probe the mass dominant population is transformed into a mass distribution for the stellar disk , assuming a constant value of ( /l@xmath1)@xmath2(casertano 1983 , carignan 1985 ) .",
    "for the contribution of the gaseous component , the radial profile scaled by 1.33 is used to account for he .",
    "the difference between the observed rotation curve and the computed contribution to the curve of the luminous ( stars & gas ) component is thus the contribution of the dark component , which can be represented by an isothermal halo ( carignan 1985 ) or some other functional form ( e.g. lake & feinswog 1989 ) .",
    "the model of fig.[fig : hi]a allows us to study the dark  to  luminous mass ratio as a function of radius , as shown in fig.[fig : hi]b . naturally , this is for standard gravity .",
    "some alternative models , such as mond , have also been explored ( milgrom 1983 , sanders 1996 , mcgaugh & de blok 1998 ) .",
    "the example of ngc 5585 shows the importance of an accurate determination of the rising part of the rotation curve , since this is the part that mainly constrains the values of two of the three free parameters of the mass model ; namely , the mass  to  light ratio of the luminous stellar disk ( /l@xmath1)@xmath2and the core radius r@xmath5 .",
    "the third parameter , the one dimensional velocity dispersion @xmath6 of the dark isothermal halo is mainly constrained by the outer part of the rotation curve .",
    "the observations , often optimized for maximum sensitivity in the outer parts , have in most of the published studies a resolution of only 2045 ( higher resolution is naturally possible by adding longer baselines when there is sufficient flux ) .",
    "attempts have been made to correct for the effect of `` beam smearing '' , which can be very important in the inner parts because of the strong velocity gradient ( sometimes combined with a strong radial distribution gradient ) across the large beam .",
    "this is examined using as an example the sc galaxy ngc 3198 .",
    "another point that needs to be stressed is that full 2d kinematical data are necessary for this work and that 1d long  slit spectroscopy is not sufficient .",
    "this is due to the fact that the photometric parameters ( we are mainly concerned with the position angle pa and photometric center in this case ) used to position the slits on the galaxies can sometime be quite different from the kinematical parameters .",
    "naturally , if the slit is positioned with a slightly wrong pa , the velocities will necessarily be underestimated .",
    "this is well illustrated for the case of the rotation curves of galaxies in clusters ( whitmore , forbes & rubin 1988 for the 1d long - slit , and amram et al . 1996 for 2d fabry ",
    "perot ) .",
    "the importance of the rising part of the rotation curve on the parameters for both the luminous and dark matter distributions is illustrated by two examples in section 2 .",
    "section 3 describes the new cfht fabry ",
    "perot ( fp ) observations and data reduction of the ngc 5585 data .",
    "the kinematics and the optical rotation curve are discussed in section 4 , while the mass models and the parameters of the mass distribution are given in section 5 .",
    "finally , section 6 gives a summary of the results and draws general conclusions from this study .",
    "it has always been thought that the problem of `` beam smearing '' was important mainly in early  type spirals , where the strong gradient due to the presence of the bulge was attenuated in low resolution data and where it was obvious that higher resolution data were necessary to see the true kinematics resulting from the centrally concentrated luminous mass distribution . in what follows",
    ", it will be shown that , while the effect of beam smearing in late  type spirals may be less dramatic , it can nevertheless have a significant impact on the derived parameters of both the luminous and the dark mass distributions .      to show the importance of the first few points of the rotation curve in a galaxy such as ngc 5585",
    ", a model was constructed giving no weight to the first two points of the curve ( fig.[fig : hi-2first]a ) .",
    "this model mimics a difference of less than 10   with the real position of the first two points , a very plausible effect of the large radio beams . in this model ,",
    "the ( /l@xmath1)@xmath2of the stellar disk goes from 0.3 ( fig.[fig : hi]a ) to 1.0 ( fig.[fig : hi-2first]a ) , with the result that the mass of the stellar disk goes from @xmath720% of the gaseous disk to a comparable mass .",
    "more importantly is that the dark matter halo is less centrally concentrated with a dark  to  luminous mass ratio going from 9.5 ( fig.[fig : hi]b ) to 6.3 ( fig.[fig : hi-2first]b ) at the last measured point of the rotation curve .",
    "this is a difference of more than 30% in the dark  to  luminous mass ratio for a difference of less than 10 in the position of the first two points of the curve . as illustrated in fig.[fig : hi]b & fig.[fig : hi-2first]b , the global distribution of the dark component is also totally different .",
    "this is why we think that the ideal rotation curve to study the mass distribution in galaxies should combine the high resolution of h@xmath0fp observations in the inner parts to the high sensitivity of the low resolution observations in the outer parts .",
    "begeman ( 1989 ) published a westerbork rotation curve of ngc 3198 , where he attempted to correct for the effect of beam  smearing .",
    "theoretically , one should be able to calculate this effect by convolving the rapidly dropping hi density profile and the rising rotation curve inside the width of the beam . in the inner parts , his rotation velocities are systematically larger ( up to 26 kms@xmath8at 30 ) than the values derived in a previous study by bosma ( 1981 ) .",
    "if the corrections are accurate , one would expect that there should be very little gain in using high resolution h@xmath0data .",
    "fig.[fig:3198beg ] and table  [ tab : mod3198 ] show the best ",
    "fit model using the beam  smearing corrected data .",
    "it can be seen that for r  @xmath9  3  kpc and r  @xmath10  15  kpc , the model gives a good representation of the data .",
    "however , around 4 kpc , the model velocity is larger by @xmath11 kms@xmath8compared to the measured velocity .    a best - fit model ( fig.[fig:3198beg+cor ] )",
    "was obtained by combining begeman s data with the fp h@xmath0kinematical data of corradi et al .",
    "we see that while the agreement between the two sets of data appears good over all , the optical velocities are somewhat smaller in the steep rising part of the rotation curve .",
    "as can be seen in table  [ tab : mod3198 ] , the dark  to  luminous mass ratio at the last measured point has changed very little between the two models ( 2.9 @xmath12 3.0 ) , but the shape of the halo has changed substantially , becoming more centrally concentrated with r@xmath5 going from 17.2 to 11.7 kpc , again a change of more than 30% . the apparently small difference in velocity ( @xmath13 kms@xmath8 ) results in an increase of the dark halo central density @xmath14 by nearly a factor of 2 ( 0.004 @xmath12 0.008 ) .",
    "this suggests that begeman ( 1989 ) may have overestimated his beam  smearing corrections .",
    "it is instructive also to compare this result with the earlier bosma data , which were not corrected for beam  smearing , as is the case for most data .",
    "ngc 3198 is an sc galaxy , in which the velocity gradient is much smaller than in sa or sb galaxies and one would have thought that the effect of beam  smearing should not be that dramatic .",
    "fig.[fig:3198bos ] shows the best fit model using that data set .",
    "we see that the mass distribution is completely different , with a much smaller disk and a dark halo that dominates completely for r  @xmath15  kpc .",
    "the result is that , with differences @xmath16 kms@xmath8for @xmath17  kpc , the dark component has nearly 10 times higher central density , which results in an increase of the dark  to  luminous mass ratio from @xmath18 to @xmath19",
    ".    many more examples could be discussed , but we think that the examples above show clearly that high resolution h@xmath0data are necessary to compute accurately the parameters of both the luminous and dark mass distributions .",
    "table  [ tab : opt5585 ] gives the optical parameters of ngc 5585 and table  [ tab : fp5585 ] lists the complete observing parameters .",
    "the fp observations of the h@xmath0emission line were obtained in february 1994 at the canada  france ",
    "hawaii telescope ( cfht ) .",
    "the fp etalon ( cfht1 ) was installed in the cfht s multi  object spectrograph ( mos ) . a narrow  band filter ( @xmath20 = 10 ) , centered at @xmath21 = 6570 ( nearly at the systemic velocity of ngc 5585 , v@xmath22 kms@xmath8 ) , was placed in front of the etalon .",
    "the available field with no vignetting was @xmath23 8.5@xmath24 8.5 , with 0.34 pix @xmath8 .",
    "the free spectral range of 5.66 ( 258 kms@xmath8 ) was scanned in 27 ( + 1 overlapping ) channels , giving a sampling of 0.2 ( 9.2 kms@xmath8 ) per channel .",
    "eight minutes integration was spent at each channel position .      following normal de  biasing and flat  fielding with standard iraf procedures , a robust 3-d cosmic  ray removal routine , that tracks cosmic rays by spatial ( pixel  to  pixel ) and spectral ( frame  to  frame ) analysis , was applied .",
    "since fp systems have multiple optical surfaces , some defocalised ghost reflections can be present ( bland - hawthorn 1995 ) , especially since the etalon was not tilted .",
    "to get rid of these reflections we composed a `` ghost image '' by using the ghost reflection of a bright star in the field ( figure [ fig : reflex ] ) and numerically simulating a similar but scaled reflection for every pixel in the field .",
    "this image was then subtracted from the original .",
    "this procedure removes very efficiently all the reflected continuum and adequately but not perfectly ( @xmath780% ) the monochromatic emission .",
    "the presence of strong night sky lines combined with photometric variations ( transparency , seeing ) from one exposure to another led us to proceed to a first background subtraction on each of the 27 non - redundant frames ( now assembled in a 3-d cube ) .",
    "this background includes continuous , diffuse light and monochromatic emission from atmospheric oh radicals and from geocoronal h@xmath0 .",
    "all these background vary both spatially and temporally . using the radial symmetry of the fp ,",
    "the sky was evaluated by azimuthally summing rings of constant phase where the galaxy signal had been masked .",
    "the computed background was then removed in each ring .    a neon calibration lamp ( @xmath256598.95  )",
    "was used to fix the zero point at each pixel . to be totally device independent , the theoretical position of a sky emission line was then used to fine - tuned the phase ( wavelength origin ) at each pixel in order to get a particular wavelength on an exact x - y plane . due to limited free spectral range , this telluric line is a composite of geocoronal h@xmath0(@xmath256562.74 or 517 kms@xmath8 ) and an oh line ( @xmath256568.78 or 532 kms@xmath8 ) .",
    "since there is no way to determine the relative contribution of each line , we are left with some uncertainties on the systemic velocity of the galaxy , but this does not affect the relative velocities and the rotation curve .    in order to get sufficient signal  to  noise throughout the image , two different gaussian smoothings ( @xmath6=2.5 and 3.5 pixels ) were performed on the cube using the adhoc package ( boulesteix 1993 ) .",
    "velocity maps were then obtained using the intensity weighted means of the h@xmath0 peaks to determine the radial velocity for each pixel .",
    "a final variable resolution velocity map was constructed ( figure [ fig : vit+mono ] ) using higher resolution for regions with originally higher signal - to - noise .",
    "the rotation curve has been obtained from the velocity field following two different methods .",
    "the first estimate was made using the task rocur ( begeman 1987 , cot et al .",
    "1991 ) in the aips package , where annuli in the plane of the galaxy ( ellipses in the plane of sky ) are fitted to the velocity field , minimizing the dispersion inside each ring . in this way , the center , systemic velocity , position angle and inclination are evaluated .",
    "secondly , the adhoc package was used to fine  tune these parameters by direct visualization and comparison with a residual velocity field .",
    "the optical rotation curve at 5  resolution is given in table  [ tab : rc5585 ] and figure  [ fig : rc_ha ] . note that there are two common ways to represent the errors on a rotation curve : the error on the mean ( @xmath26 ) and the velocity difference of the receding and approaching side weighted by the number of points on each side , a method often used for hi rotation curve . to be conservative",
    ", we took the maximum of the two values .    at intermediate radii ,",
    "the approaching side of the galaxy is still affected by residual sky emission .",
    "this is caused by the lack of regions with pure sky signal in the most central rings , making the measurement of the sky emission lines less accurate and only partially subtracted .",
    "the final effect here is to lower the rotation velocities between 2 and 4 kpc in radius .",
    "as we will see , this is in the region where it is possible to rely with confidence on the data , because of the shallower fall of density and the slower rise of the rotation curve that make beam smearing negligible .",
    "the models used are described in carignan ( 1985 ) .",
    "however , instead of being `` maximum disk '' models , they are `` best  fit '' models .",
    "a @xmath27 minimization technique is used in the three  parameter space of the model .",
    "namely , those parameters are : ( /l@xmath1)@xmath2of the stellar disk , the core radius r@xmath5 and the one  dimensional velocity dispersion @xmath6 of the dark isothermal halo .",
    "alternatively , one can use the central density @xmath28 .",
    "the surface photometry and the kinematics are from ct , carignan , & sancisi 1991 .      the best  fit mass model for the h@xmath0rotation curve at 5 resolution is shown in fig.[fig : ha ] .",
    "it can be seen that there is a clear sign of the disk mass in the rotation curve , which is well fitted .",
    "in fact , the best ",
    "fit model is essentially a maximum disk model .",
    "the mass  to  light ratio of the stellar disk goes from 0.3 using the data to 1.0 using the h@xmath0data , which causes the halo to become less centrally concentrated . for the dark halo ,",
    "the parameters are r@xmath5 = 4.1 kpc , @xmath14 = 0.023 @xmath29pc@xmath30 and @xmath6 = 49.1 kms@xmath8 , which represent a decrease of @xmath14 of more than 50% .",
    "interestingly , the h@xmath0rotation curve provides a much better fit to the mond model ( @xmath31 , m@xmath32/l@xmath1 = 0.5 ) than the curve alone ( see figure 1 of sanders 1996 ) .",
    "however , the little kink seen at radius @xmath331 kpc could indicate the transition between the disk dominated region and the halo dominated region , which would exclude alternative gravitational theories based on luminous matter only",
    ". this feature could also be the dynamical signature of an inner bar , but the 2-d velocity field does not show evidence of non - circular motion .",
    "it is interesting to look at the shape of the different components as a function of radius for this h@xmath0rotation curve , derived out to @xmath71.3 r@xmath34 ( herein defined as rc3 d@xmath34/2 ) or @xmath35@xmath36 kpc . in massive spirals",
    ", the stellar disk usually dominates the mass distribution for r @xmath9 r@xmath34 .",
    "typical @xmath37/@xmath38 are between 0.5 to 1.0 at that radius .",
    "this is certainly not the case here with @xmath37/@xmath38 @xmath39 at the last measured point of the rotation curve .",
    "moreover , at the last point , there is almost as much luminous mass in gas as in stars .",
    "so , for a dwarf spiral such as ngc 5585 , the mass distribution is much more reminiscent of what is seen in dirr ( e.g. ddo 154 : carignan & freeman 1988 , carignan & beaulieu 1989 ; ddo 170 : lake , shommer , & van gorkom 1990 ) than in massive sp galaxies ( e.g. ngc 6946 : carignan et al .",
    "1990 ; ngc 3198 : van albada et al .",
    "other late  type sp such as ic 2574 ( martimbeau et al .",
    "1994 ) and ngc 3109 ( jobin & carignan 1990 ) , both of type sm , also have a strong contribution from dark matter even in the inner parts but show solid - body rotation curves .",
    "table  [ tab : mod5585 ] gives the parameters of the mass models constructed using only the rotation curve , only the h@xmath0curve , and the combined & h@xmath0curve . for our adopted mass model of ngc 5585 , we combine the high resolution of the h@xmath0data in the inner parts with the high sensitivity of the data in the outer parts . since we are making a best  fit model , one has to understand that , because of the higher resolution , there are more data points than data points .",
    "this means that the optical data would tend to have a higher weight than the radio data .",
    "since optical velocities are derived from high s / n data out to a radius of 120 and since fig .",
    "9 of ct , carignan & sancisi ( 1991 ) shows that this is the region where the parameters are not well defined , we decided to use for the final model the h@xmath0data for r  @xmath9  120 and the data for r  @xmath10  120 .",
    "this adopted model is shown in fig.[fig : hi+ha ] .",
    "the parameters of the model are : ( /l@xmath1)@xmath2= 1.0 , r@xmath5 = 4.5 kpc , @xmath14 = 0.024 @xmath29pc@xmath30 and @xmath6 = 53.6 kms@xmath8 .",
    "as expected , @xmath6 is very similar in the combined & h@xmath0curve as in the rotation curve .",
    "this is the case because this parameter is a measure of the maximum amplitude of the rotation curve , which is mainly defined by the data in the outer parts .",
    "however , the two other parameters ( /l@xmath1)@xmath2for the stellar disk and @xmath14 of the dark halo ( which are coupled ) have nearly the same values as those derived with the h@xmath0curve . again",
    ", this is because ( /l@xmath1)@xmath2of the luminous stellar disk , and hence the scaling parameter of the dark halo r@xmath5 , is mainly constrained by the data in the inner parts . interestingly , because this newly derived central density is significantly lower , this means that this late - type galaxy s dark halo is even less concentrated ; therefore this exacerbates the discrepancy between observed rotation curves and those predicted by standard cdm halo simulations , which are already too concentrated for late - type and dwarf galaxies ( see , e.g. , navarro 1996 but also kravtsov et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the importance of an accurate determination of the rising part of a rotation curve using full 2d high resolution fp observations is well illustrated by the example of ngc 5585 .",
    "the principal conclusions follow .",
    "the parameters of the mass distribution of both the dark and the luminous components are very sensitive to the rising part of the rotation curve ( the first few velocity points ) not only in early - type spirals , where the velocity gradient is large in the inner parts , but also in late - type spirals , which have a much shallower gradient .",
    "the sensitivity is especially important when the contributions of dark and luminous matter are comparable .      \\3 .",
    "full 3-d spectroscopy , obtained with fabry - perot spectroscopy , is to be preferred to long - slit spectroscopy in order to derive properly the orientation parameters ( namely , the rotation center and the position angle ) and hence not underestimate the rotational velocities .",
    "\\4 . combining new h@xmath0cfht fp data with westerbork hi data reduced the ratio @xmath37/@xmath38 by @xmath33 30% via a decrease of the central density by nearly a factor of 3 for the late - type spiral ngc 5585 .",
    "if such large errors are common , one could imagine that it could mask any physical correlation between the parameters of the dark and the luminous matter .",
    "\\5 . finally , the optimal rotation curve is clearly a combination of 2d high resolution spectroscopy for the inner part of spiral galaxies and high sensitivity radio observations for the outer regions .",
    "we would like to thank the staff of the cfht for their support during the fp data acquisition and daniel durand from dao who helped with data acquisition .",
    "we also warmly thank jacques boulesteix for fuitfull discussion on fabry - perot reduction and anthony f.j .",
