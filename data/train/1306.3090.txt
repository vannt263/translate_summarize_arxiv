    "the understanding of compact stars requires the study of strongly interacting matter at low temperatures and high chemical potentials .",
    "however , this portion of the qcd phase diagram can not be addressed by current lattice - qcd methods so that studies of this phase region must rely on less fundamental models .",
    "most investigations suggest that there is a first - order chiral phase transition which , for @xmath9 , sets in at baryon densities several times that of the nuclear saturation density , @xmath10 .",
    "the expected phase transition will have significant implications for the possible existence of quark stars and the possibilities depend on the dynamics of the phase conversion as well as on the time scales involved @xcite .",
    "when the phase diagram of bulk matter exhibits a first - order phase transition , the two phases , associated with a high and a low density value ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) , may coexist in mutual thermodynamic equilibrium and , consequently , when brought into physical contact a mechanically stable interface will develop between them .",
    "the associated surface tension @xmath13 depends on the temperature @xmath14 ; it has its largest magnitude at @xmath15 approaching zero as @xmath14 is increased to the critical end point temperature , @xmath16 , where the first order transition line terminates .",
    "the surface tension plays a key role in the phase conversion process and it is related to various characteristic quantities such as the nucleation rate , the critical bubble radius , and the favored scale of the blobs generated by the spinodal instabilities @xcite . for our present purposes",
    "it is important to remark that a small surface tension would facilitate various structures in compact stars , including the presence of mixed phases in a hybrid star @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , despite its central importance , the surface tension of quark matter is rather poorly known . at vanishing temperatures ,",
    "some early estimates fall within a wide range , typically @xmath17 @xcite and values of @xmath18 have been considered for studying the effect of quark matter nucleation on the evolution of proto - neutron stars @xcite .",
    "but the authors in ref .",
    "@xcite , taking into account the effects from charge screening and structured mixed phases , estimate @xmath19 , without excluding smaller values , and even a higher value , @xmath20 , was found on the basis of dimensional analysis of the minimal interface between a color - flavor locked phase and nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "more recently , the surface tension for two - flavor quark matter was evaluated , in ref .",
    "@xcite , within the the quark meson model ( qm ) , in the framework of the thin - wall approximation for bubble nucleation .",
    "the predicted values cover the @xmath21 range , depending on the inclusion of vacuum and/or thermal corrections . in principle",
    ", this range makes nucleation of quark matter possible during the early post - bounce stage of core - collapse supernovae and it is thus a rather important result .",
    "the nambu  jona - lasinio model ( njl ) with two and three flavors was subsequently considered in the evaluation of @xmath13 @xcite via a geometrical approach introduced by randrup in ref .",
    "this method makes it possible to express the surface tension for any subcritical temperature in terms of the free energy density for uniform matter in the unstable density range . in practice ,",
    "the procedure is rather simple to implement and it provides an estimate for the surface tension that is consistent with the equation of state ( eos ) implied by the adopted model , with its specific approximations and parametrizations .",
    "the results obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite predict that , at zero temperature , @xmath22 depending on the chosen parameters .",
    "very recently , the polyakov quark meson model ( pqm ) with three flavors has been considered @xcite in the context of the thin wall approximation extending the work of ref .",
    "@xcite with confinement and strangeness . depending on the adopted parametrization , the numerical results obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite are within the @xmath23 range .",
    "the authors have confirmed that the inclusion of the strange sector , which was originally done in ref .",
    "@xcite , does not change appreciably the dynamics of the transition at low temperatures and high chemical potentials as neither does the inclusion of the polyakov loop . regarding the possibility of phase conversion taking place , within compact stellar objects , it is important to remark that all these three recent evaluations @xcite predict values for the surface tension which are low enough so that , in principle , the phase conversion phenomenon could take place . at the sam e time , these three estimates , of low values , favor the appearance of a mixed phase within a hybrid star .",
    "one should also recall that very high magnetic fields can be present in magnetars reaching up to @xmath2 ( @xmath24 ) , or higher , at the core of the star @xcite . in many applications this type of compact stellar objects",
    "are modeled as a hybrid star which has a core of quark matter surrounded by hadronic matter @xcite and if the surface tension between the two phases is small enough , as predicted by refs .",
    "@xcite , the transition occurs via a mixed phase ( gibbs construction ) . on the other hand , if @xmath13 has a high value , as predicted by refs .",
    "@xcite , it occurs at a sharp interface ( maxwell construction ) @xcite . therefore , the value of the surface tension in the presence of high magnetic fields may be an important ingredient for investigations related to quark and hybrid stars . since this type of evaluation does not seem to have been carried out before we intend to perform such a calculation here by extending the work of ref .",
    "@xcite so as to account for the presenc e of high magnetic fields .",
    "the coexistence region associated with the first order transition of strongly interacting magnetized matter has been recently investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite which predicts , as one of its main results , that the value of @xmath11 oscillates around the @xmath4 value for @xmath25 and then grows for higher values . taking into account that @xmath13 depends on the difference between @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xcite one",
    "may then expect to find a similar behavior here .",
    "indeed , as we will demonstrate , when a magnetic field is present the surface tension value oscillates very mildly for @xmath26 before decreasing in a significant way between @xmath27 . then , after reaching a minimum at @xmath28 it starts to increase continuously reaching the @xmath4 value at @xmath29 which allows to conclude that the existence of a mixed phase remains possible within this range of magnetic fields . for @xmath30 values",
    "higher than @xmath31 this quantity increases rapidly with the magnetic field disfavoring the presence of a mixed phase within hybrid stars .",
    "we also show how the temperature affects @xmath32 by decreasing its value towards zero which is achieved at @xmath33 , as already emphasized .    the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we review the method for extracting the surface tension from the equation of state . in sec .",
    "[ models ] we present the eos for the magnetized two flavor njl .",
    "then , in sec .  [ results ] , we present our numerical results .",
    "the conclusions and final remarks are presented in sec .",
    "[ conclude ] .",
    "to make this work self contained let us review , in this section , the geometric approach to the surface tension evaluation which was originally proposed in ref .",
    "we first assume that the material at hand , strongly interacting matter , may appear in two different phases under the same thermodynamic conditions of temperature @xmath14 , chemical potential @xmath34 , and pressure @xmath35 .",
    "these two coexisting phases have different values of other relevant quantities , such as the energy density @xmath36 , the net quark number density @xmath37 , and the entropy density @xmath38 . under such circumstances",
    ", the two phases will develop a mechanically stable interface if placed in physical contact .",
    "an interface tension , @xmath13 , is then associated to this interface .",
    "the two - phase feature appears for all temperatures below the critical value , @xmath16 .",
    "thus , for any subcritical temperature , @xmath39 , hadronic matter at the density @xmath40 has the same chemical potential and pressure as quark matter at the ( larger ) density @xmath41 . as @xmath14 is increased from zero to @xmath16 , the coexistence phase points @xmath42 and @xmath43 trace out the lower and higher branches of the phase coexistence boundary , respectively , gradually approaching each other and finally coinciding for @xmath33 .",
    "any @xmath44 phase point outside of this boundary corresponds to thermodynamically stable uniform matter , whereas uniform matter prepared with a density and temperature corresponding to a phase point inside the phase coexistence boundary is thermodynamically unstable and prefers to separate into two coexisting thermodynamically stable phases separated by a mechanically stable interface .",
    "because such a two - phase configuration is in global thermodynamic equilibrium , the local values of @xmath14 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 remain unchanged as one moves from the interior of one phase through the interface region and into the interior of the partner phase , as the local density @xmath37 increases steadily from the lower coexistence value @xmath12 to the corresponding higher coexistence value @xmath11 .",
    "it is convenient to work in the canonical framework where the control parameters are temperature and density .",
    "the basic thermodynamic function is thus @xmath45 , the free energy density as a function of the ( net ) quark number density @xmath37 for the specified temperature @xmath14 .",
    "the chemical potential can then be recovered as @xmath46 , and the entropy density as @xmath47 , so the energy density is @xmath48 , while the pressure is @xmath49 .    for single - phase systems @xmath45",
    "is convex , _",
    "i.e. _  its second derivative @xmath50 is positive , while the appearance of a concavity in @xmath45 signals the occurrence of phase coexistence , at that temperature .",
    "this is easily understood because when @xmath45 has a local concave anomaly then there exist a pair of densities , @xmath12 and @xmath11 , for which the tangents to @xmath45 are common .",
    "therefore @xmath45 has the same slope at those two densities , so the corresponding chemical potentials are equal , @xmath51 .",
    "furthermore , because a linear extrapolation of @xmath45 leads from one of the touching points to the other , also the two pressures are equal , @xmath52",
    ". so uniform matter at the density @xmath12 has the same temperature , chemical potential , and pressure as uniform matter at the density @xmath11 .",
    "the common tangent between the two coexistence points corresponds to the familiar maxwell construction and shall here be denoted as @xmath53 .",
    "obviously , @xmath45 and @xmath53 coincide at the two coexistence densities and , furthermore , @xmath45 exceeds @xmath53 for intermediate densities",
    ". therefore we have @xmath54 .    for a given ( subcritical ) temperature @xmath14",
    ", we now consider a configuration in which the two coexisting bulk phases are placed in physical contact along a planar interface .",
    "the associated equilibrium profile density is denoted by @xmath55 where @xmath56 denotes the location in the direction normal to the interface . in the diffuse interface region",
    ", the corresponding local free energy density , @xmath57 , differs from what it would be for the corresponding maxwell system , _",
    "i.e. _  a mathematical mix of the two coexisting bulk phases with the mixing ratio adjusted to yield an average density equal to the local value @xmath58 .",
    "this local deficit amounts to @xmath59 where @xmath60 is either one of the two coexistence densities .",
    "the function @xmath61 is smooth and it tends quickly to zero away from the interface where @xmath55 rapidly approaches @xmath60 and @xmath57 rapidly approaches @xmath62 . the interface tension @xmath13 is the total deficit in free energy per unit area of planar interface , @xmath63    as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , when a gradient term used to take account of finite - range effects , the tension associated with the interface between the two phases can be expressed without explicit knowledge about the profile functions but exclusively in terms of the equation of state for uniform ( albeit unstable ) matter , @xmath64^{1/2 } \\frac { d \\rho}{\\rho^g}\\ , \\label{gamma}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is a characteristic value of the density and @xmath66 is a characteristic value of the energy density , while the parameter @xmath67 is an effective interaction range related to the strength of the gradient term , @xmath68 .",
    "we choose the characteristic phase point to be in the middle of the coexistence region , @xmath69 and @xmath70/2 $ ] , where @xmath71 is energy density at @xmath72 , while @xmath73 is energy density at the critical point @xmath74 .",
    "the length @xmath67 is a somewhat adjustable parameter governing the width of the interface region and the magnitude of the tension @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite this parameter was set to @xmath75 which , also , is approximately the value found in an application of the thomas - fermi approximation to the njl model @xcite .",
    "therefore , we shall adopt the value @xmath76 throughout the present work .",
    "with these parameters fixed ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the interface tension can be calculated once the free energy density @xmath45 is known for uniform matter in the unstable phase region , @xmath77 .",

    "then , a stronger coupling should produce a higher surface tension which is indeed the case , as demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath4 .",
    "for example , taking @xmath195 , @xmath196 , and @xmath197 the critical point occurs at @xmath198 and @xmath199 while the effective quark mass value is @xmath200 ( compare with our values in table i ) . with this parametrization ,",
    "one obtains @xmath201 which is much smaller than our value , @xmath202 . on the other hand ,",
    "the surface tension value is expected to increase by taking a higher coupling but one should also remember that the effective quark mass grows with @xmath90 and , with the set adopted here , we already have @xmath203 which can be considered high enough is about one third of the baryonic mass ( @xmath204 ) . ] .",
    "so , as far as the parametrization is concerned , our predictions could be lo wered by adopting coupling values which predict smaller values for the effective quark mass .",
    "next , let us point out that the presence of a repulsive vector channel may play an important role when treating the njl at finite densities and , in this case , an interaction of the form @xmath205 is usually added to the lagrangian density describing the model @xcite . then , regarding the phase diagram , it has been established that the net effect of a repulsive vector contribution , parametrized by the coupling @xmath206 , is to add a term @xmath207 to the pressure weakening the first order transition @xcite . in this case , the first order transition line shrinks , forcing the cp to appear at smaller temperatures , while the first order transition occurs at higher coexistence chemical potential values as @xmath206 increases . in this case , the coexistence region decreases ( this situation will not be affected by the presence of a magnetic field @xcite ) and should produce an even smaller value for the surface tension .",
    "with respect to the mfa adopted here we believe that further improvements will only reduce the surface tension since evaluations performed with the nonperturbative optimized perturbation theory ( opt ) , at @xmath208 , have shown @xcite that already at the first non trivial order the free energy receives contributions from two loop terms which are @xmath209 suppressed .",
    "it turns out that these exchange ( fock ) type of terms , which do not contribute at the large-@xmath210 ( or mfa ) level , produce a net effect similar to the one observed with the mfa at @xmath211 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the opt pressure displays a term of the form @xmath212 where @xmath213 is the usual scalar coupling so that a vector like contribution can be generated by quantum corrections even when @xmath208 at the lagrangian ( tree ) level .",
    "the relation between the mfa ( at @xmath211 ) and the opt ( at @xmath208 ) and their consequences for the first order phase transition has been recently analyzed in g reat detail @xcite .",
    "based on this result one concludes that , in principle , the inclusion of corrections beyond the mean field level may contribute to further decrease the value of @xmath13 .    in stellar modeling ,",
    "the structure of the star depends on the assumed eos built with appropriate models while the true ground state of matter remains a source of speculation .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that _ strange quark matter _ ( sqm ) is the true ground state of all matter and this hypothesis is known as the bodmer - witten conjecture .",
    "hence , the interior of neutron stars should be composed predominantly of @xmath214 quarks ( plus leptons if one wants to ensure charge neutrality ) .",
    "the question of how strangeness affects @xmath183 was originally addressed in ref .",
    "@xcite where the three flavor njl was considered yielding the value @xmath215 which is still within the lower end of estimated values .",
    "moreover , in their application to the three flavor polyakov quark meson model , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite have confirmed that the presence of strangeness should not affect the surface tension in a drastic way .",
    "another important issue , tread in ref .",
    "@xcite , concerns confinement which has been considered by means of the polyakov loop .",
    "also , in this case the main outcome is that the surface tension value is not too much affected when the quark model is extended by the polyakov loop .    together",
    ", all these remarks indicate that our ( low end ) estimates for @xmath13 are basically stable to the inclusion of more refinements ( such as strangeness and confinement ) and can even be further lowered ( e.g. , by going beyond the mean field level and/or by including a repulsive vector channel ) .",
    "in this work we have evaluated the surface tension related to the first - order chiral phase transition for two flavor magnetized quark matter by considering the njl model in the mfa . to obtain this quantity",
    "we have used the prescription presented in ref .",
    "@xcite which is straightforward once the uniform - matter equation of state is available for the unstable regions of the phase diagram .",
    "the surface tension determined in the present fashion is entirely consistent with the employed model , including the approximations and parametrizations adopted . in practice one only needs to consider _ all _ the solutions to the gap equation ( stable , metastable and unstable ) when generating the corresponding eos .",
    "this method was previously employed to obtain the surface tension for the njl in the absence of magnetic fields yielding @xmath216 which lies within the low end of available estimates ( @xmath0 ) and is in agreement with other recent predictions which employ effective quark models @xcite .",
    "the importance of this result concerns , for example , the possibility of a mixed phase occurring in hybrid stars since the existence of such a phase is possible when the surface tension has a low value @xcite .",
    "our results have shown that , when a magnetic field is present , the surface tension value presents a small oscillation around the @xmath4 value , for @xmath26 .",
    "then , it decreases for @xmath27 reaching a minimum at @xmath28 where the value is about @xmath217 smaller than the @xmath4 result .",
    "after this point it starts to increase continuously reaching the @xmath4 value at @xmath29 .",
    "this result allows to conclude that the existence of a mixed phase remains possible within this range of magnetic fields and can even be favored at the core of magnetars if @xmath218 ( or , equivalently , @xmath219 ) . at about twice this field intensity",
    "the surface tension starts to increase rapidly with the magnetic field disfavoring the presence of a mixed phase within hybrid stars .",
    "the origin of this behavior can be traced back to the oscillations present in the coexistence region which is a quantity of central importance in the evaluation of @xmath13 .",
    "we have also shown how the temperature affects this quantity by decreasing its value towards zero which is achieved at @xmath33 , as e xpected . other issues such as strangeness , the presence of a repulsive vector interaction , confinement , corrections to the mfa , as well as different parametrizations have also been discussed .",
    "we have argued that our surface tension values , which already rank at the low end of the available wide range of predictions , will be little affected by strangeness and confinement and will be even lowered by the presence of a repulsive vector term and/or by the inclusion of corrections beyond the mean field level so that a mixed phase within hybrid stars will be further favored by these improvements . on the other hand , with the adopted model , the surface tension value could grow if one chooses a parametrization with a coupling greater than ours which in turn would lead to very high effective quark masses .",
