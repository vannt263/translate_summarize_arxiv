    "in this article we investigate , via the use of _ dualities _ , two - dimensional ( @xmath3 ) classical systems , such as the xy and clock models @xcite , that display berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt)-type transitions @xcite . bkt transitions , notably characterized by essential singularities in the free energy , emerge in many physical situations including screening in coulomb gases @xcite , surface roughening @xcite , melting in @xmath3 solids @xcite , and many other classical and quantum problems , such as deconfinement in @xmath4 lattice gauge theories @xcite .",
    "we study these models by invoking a _ bond - algebraic _ approach that we have recently developed @xcite . within our duality - based method ,",
    "one relates singularities in the free energy at one temperature ( or coupling constants ) to those at a dual temperature ( or dual coupling constants ) .    specifically , we investigate exact dualities of the @xmath3 xy and @xmath0-clock models , and exploit those dualities to unravel their phase structures .",
    "those transformations are exact even for finite systems after appropriate boundary terms are included .",
    "it is noteworthy that unlike nearly all of the analytical work done to date , our dualities do not rely on the approximation scheme of villain @xcite , yet they can be related to the exact dualities of the villain model in appropriate limits . furthermore , our analysis leads to exact dualities for general @xmath0-clock models and yields a better understanding of the appearance of two transitions in systems with @xmath5 states ( the xy model with only one transition is recovered in the @xmath6 limit ) . by fusing our duality results with the _ peierls argument _ , we will be able to ( 1 ) prove that @xmath7 clock systems can be made to be self - dual ; ( 2 ) prove by a peierls argument that there exists a lower ordering temperature @xmath8 , associated to domain - wall excitations , below which the global @xmath9 symmetry is broken ; ( 3 ) demonstrate that a second transition occurs at a temperature @xmath10 when @xmath1 ( in the self - dual case , it follows that if @xmath11 is not the self - dual temperature @xmath12 , then there must necessarily be a second phase transition at @xmath13 of an identical character ) ; and ( 4 ) characterize the nature of the topological excitations , and further explain that at @xmath14 a new type of topological excitation , with an associated discrete winding number , appears .",
    "our considerations suggest that these _ discrete vortices _ may proliferate above the temperature @xmath13 .",
    "we will also ( 5 ) determine an analytic expression for the self - dual temperature @xmath12 , which relates and clarifies temperature scales discussed in @xcite , and most importantly , ( 6 ) establish the non - abelian polyhedral symmetry group @xmath15 of the @xmath0-clock and related models , and explicitly unveil the u(1 ) continuous symmetry that _ emerges _ when @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , the latter is intimately tied to the existence of the bkt transition . finally , ( 7 ) we derive a correlation inequality to prove that the intermediate phase , appearing for @xmath16 , is critical ( massless ) with decaying power - law correlations .    despite several analytic @xcite and numerical calculations @xcite ,",
    "the precise nature of the two phase transitions ( @xmath1 ) is not completely understood .",
    "it was proven @xcite that for large enough @xmath0 , clock models exhibit a bkt - type transition ( actually , it has only been proved that there exists an intermediate critical phase with power - law correlations ) . the question whether that still holds when @xmath14 remains open @xcite . by",
    "relying on exact results , we shed light on the character of the bkt transitions in these systems .",
    "we will relate the bkt transition to a continuous u(1 ) emergent symmetry of an usual type .",
    "although bkt transitions are often discussed in terms of specific anomalous exponents and jumps in the helicity modulus , we will not address such non - universal issues .",

    "that relies on the transfer matrix or operator formalism @xcite .",

    "however , it was discovered in refs .",
    "@xcite that low - temperature(strong coupling)/high - temperature(weak coupling ) dualities correspond to a unitary equivalence of transfer matrices or operators , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , @xmath28 with @xmath29 a unitary operator .",
    "this observation is extremely insightful because there is a simple and systematic way to look for unitary equivalences between physical operators , based on the notion of _ bond algebra _ , or algebra of interactions @xcite .",
    "the outline of this article is as follows . in section [ revxy ]",
    "we define the classical xy model , and then in [ transferxy ] _ establish its transfer operator_. in section [ hamiltonianxy ] we discuss the form of the exact one - dimensional quantum analogue whose partition function is that of the @xmath3 classical xy model with coupling constants @xmath30 and @xmath31 . in the limit of large coupling @xmath32 along columns , the quantum model is the o(2 ) quantum rotor model . in section [ xytoints ] , we establish the duality of the @xmath3 xy model to a solid - on - solid - like and also to a lattice coulomb gas - like models and , moreover , determine the disorder variables . these dualities do not rely on the villain approximation scheme but are _ exact dualities _ obtained by our bond - algebraic method @xcite .",

    "we present an analytic expression for the self - dual temperature @xmath12 , an important scale in the problem , and advance a peierls argument .",
    "we also introduce a topological invariant , that we call the discrete winding number @xmath36 , to unravel the nature of the topological excitations .",
    "starting at @xmath1 a new type of topological excitation appears with a non - zero value of @xmath36 that one may call discrete vortex , and which is responsible for the phase transition to a disordered state .",
    "domain - wall topological excitations are key at low - temperatures and their energy cost depends on @xmath0 , and on the relative spin configurations ( except for @xmath37 ) . by using both duality and energy - versus - entropy balance considerations we show that the transition from the critical to the disordered phase scales as @xmath38 , while the one from the broken @xmath9 symmetry to the critical phase goes as @xmath39 for large @xmath0 . we derive a correlation inequality , i.e. , show that the two - point correlation function @xmath40 is a monotonically decreasing function of temperature , allowing us to prove that , for @xmath1 , the intermediate phase is critical ( massless ) with decaying power - law correlations .",
