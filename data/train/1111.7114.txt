    "the recent breakthrough in creating ultracold diatomic polar molecules in the ground ro - vibrational state @xcite and cooling them towards quantum degeneracy @xcite has opened fascinating prospects for the observation of novel quantum phases @xcite .",
    "a serious problem in this direction is related to ultracold chemical reactions , such as krb+krb@xmath7k@xmath8+rb@xmath8 observed in the jila experiments with krb molecules @xcite , which places severe limitations on the achievable density in three - dimensional samples . in order to suppress chemical reactions and perform evaporative cooling ,",
    "it has been proposed to induce a strong dipole - dipole repulsion between the molecules by confining them to a ( quasi)two - dimensional ( 2d ) geometry and orienting their dipole moments ( by a strong electric field ) perpendicularly to the plane of the 2d translational motion @xcite .",
    "the suppression of chemical reactions by nearly two orders of magnitude in the quasi2d geometry has been demonstrated in the recent jila experiment @xcite . at the same time",
    ", not all polar molecules of alkali atoms , on which experimental efforts are presently focused , may undergo these chemical reactions @xcite .",
    "in particular , they are energetically unfavorable for rbcs bosonic molecules obtained in innsbruck @xcite , or for nak and kcs molecules which are now being actively studied by several experimental groups ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is thus expected that future experimental studies of many - body physics will deal with non - reactive polar molecules or with molecules strongly confined to the 2d regime .",
    "therefore , the 2d system of fermionic polar molecules attracts a great deal of interest , in particular when they are in the same internal state .",
    "various aspects have been discussed regarding this system in literature , in particular the emergence and beyond mean field description of the topological @xmath9 phase for microwave - dressed polar molecules @xcite , interlayer superfluids in bilayer and multilayer systems @xcite , the emergence of density - wave phases for tilted dipoles @xcite .",
    "the case of superfluid pairing for tilted dipoles in the quasi2d geometry beyond the simple bcs approach has been discussed in ref .",
    "the fermi liquid behavior of this system has been addressed by using the fourier transform of the dipole - dipole interaction potential @xcite and then employing various types of mean field approaches , such as the hartree - fock approximation @xcite or variational approaches @xcite .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the short - range physics can become important for the interaction between such polar molecules , since in combination with the long - range behavior it introduces a peculiar momentum dependence of the scattering amplitude @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , there is a subtle question of many - body ( beyond mean field ) effects in the fermi liquid behavior of 2d polar molecules , and it can be examined in ultracold molecule experiments . for the case of atomic fermions , a milestone in this direction",
    "is the recent result at ens , where the experiment demonstrated the many - body correction to the ground state energy of a short - range interacting two - species fermionic dilute gas @xcite .",
    "this correction was originally calculated by huang , lee , and yang @xcite by using a rather tedious procedure .",
    "later , it was found by abrikosov and khalatnikov @xcite in an elegant way based on the landau fermi liquid theory @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study a weakly interacting 2d gas of fermionic polar molecules which are all in the same internal state .",
    "it is assumed that each molecule has an average dipole moment @xmath0 which is perpendicular to the plane of the translational motion , so that the molecule - molecule interaction at large separations @xmath2 is @xmath10 where @xmath5 is the characteristic dipole - dipole distance , and @xmath6 is the molecule mass .",
    "the value of @xmath0 depends on the external electric field . at ultralow temperatures that are much smaller than the fermi energy , characteristic momenta of particles",
    "are of the order of the fermi momentum @xmath4 , and the criterion of the weakly interacting regime is : @xmath11    as a consequence , the fermi liquid properties of this system , such as the ground state energy , compressibility , effective mass , can be written as a series of expansion in the small parameter @xmath3 .",
    "we obtain explicit expressions of these quantities up to the second order in @xmath3 , which requires us to reveal the role of the short - range physics in the scattering properties and develop a theory beyond the mean field .",
    "our analysis shows that only many - body ( beyond mean field ) effects provide the existence of undamped zero sound in the collisionless regime .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we analyze the low - energy 2d scattering of the polar molecules due to the dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "we obtain the scattering amplitude for all scattering channels with odd orbital angular momenta .",
    "the leading part of the amplitude comes from the so - called anomalous scattering , that is the scattering related to the interaction between particles at distances of the order of their de broglie wavelength .",
    "this part of the amplitude corresponds to the first born approximation and , due to the long - range @xmath1 character of the dipole - dipole interaction , it is proportional to the relative momentum @xmath12 of colliding particles for any orbital angular momentum @xmath13 .",
    "we then take into account the second born correction , which gives a contribution proportional to @xmath14 .",
    "for the @xmath15-wave scattering channel it is necessary to include the short - range contribution , which together with the second born correction leads to the term behaving as @xmath16 . in section iii , after reviewing the landau fermi liquid theory for 2d systems , we specify two - body ( mean field ) and many - body ( beyond mean field ) contributions to the ground state energy for 2d fermionic polar molecules in the weakly interacting regime .",
    "we then calculate the interaction function of quasiparticles on the fermi surface and , following the idea of abrikosov - khalatnikov @xcite , obtain the compressibility , ground state energy , and effective mass of quasiparticles . in section",
    "iv we calculate the zero sound velocity and stress that the many - body contribution to the interaction function of quasiparticles is necessary for finding the undamped zero sound .",
    "we conclude in section v , emphasizing that the 2d gas of fermionic polar molecules represents a novel fermi liquid , which is promising for revealing many - body effects .",
    "moreover , we show that with present facilities it is feasible to obtain this system in both collisionless and hydrodynamic regimes .",
    "we first discuss low - energy two - body scattering of identical fermionic polar molecules undergoing the 2d translational motion and interacting with each other at large separations via the potential @xmath17 ( [ vo ] ) .",
    "the term low - energy means that their momenta satisfy the inequality @xmath18 . in order to develop many - body theory for a weakly interacting gas of such molecules , we need to know the off - shell scattering amplitude defined as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the true wavefunction of the relative motion with momentum @xmath21 .",

    "another way is to achieve the values of @xmath3 approaching unity and still discriminate between @xmath335 and @xmath458 in the measurement of the sound velocity .",
    "for example , in the case of dipoles perpendicular to the plane of their translational motion the two velocities are different from each other by about @xmath431 at @xmath460 .",
    "these values of @xmath3 are possible if the 2d gas of dipoles still satisfies the pomeranchuk criteria of stability .",
    "these criteria require that the energy of the ground state corresponding to the occupation of all quasiparticle states inside the fermi sphere , remains the minimum energy under an arbitrarily small deformation of the fermi sphere .",
    "the generalization of the pomeranchuk stability criteria to the case of the 2d single - component fermi liquid with dipoles perpendicular to the plane of their translational motion reads : @xmath461 and this inequality should be satisfied for any integer @xmath202 . as has been found in ref .",
    "@xcite , the pomeranchuk stability criteria ( [ pom ] ) are satisfied for @xmath3 approaching unity from below if the interaction function of quasiparticles contains only the first term of eq .",
    "( [ tildef1 ] ) , which is the leading mean field term .",
    "we have checked that the situation with the pomeranchuk stability does not change when we include the full expression for the interaction function , @xmath462 , following from eqs .",
    "( [ tildef1 ] ) , ( [ tildef12 ] ) , and ( [ tildef22 ] ) .",
    "thus , achieving @xmath3 approaching unity looks feasible . for krb molecules with the ( oriented ) dipole moment of @xmath463",
    "d the value @xmath464 requires densities @xmath465 @xmath453 .",
    "finally , we would like to emphasize once more that our results are applicable equally well for the quasi2d regime , where the dipole - dipole length @xmath311 is of the order of or smaller than the confinement length @xmath466 , with @xmath467 being the frequency of the tight confinement .",
    "the behavior at distances @xmath67 is contained in the coefficient @xmath60 defined in eq .",
    "( [ short ] ) .",
    "therefore , the results for the velocity of zero sound which is independent of @xmath60 , are universal in the sense that they remain unchanged when going from @xmath468 to @xmath63 .",
    "the only requirement is the inequality @xmath469 .",
    "it is , however , instructive to examine the ratio @xmath470 that can be obtained in experiments with ultracold polar molecules .",
    "already in the jila experiments using the tight confinement of krb molecules with frequency @xmath471 khz and achieving the average dipole moment @xmath448 d in electric fields of @xmath449 kv / cm , we have @xmath472 nm and @xmath473 nm so that @xmath474 . a decrease of the confinement frequency to @xmath449 khz and a simultaneous decrease of the dipole moment by a factor of 2 leads to @xmath475 . on the other hand , for @xmath0 close to @xmath432 ( which is feasible to obtain for other molecules ) one can make the ratio @xmath470 close to @xmath476 at the same confinement length .",
