    "among the major quests in investigating the properties of compact - star matter , is the underlying equation of state . in particular , exotic phases ( the so - called pasta phases )",
    "are predicted in the outer crust of neutron stars as well as in the inner core of exploding supernovae . in this latter physical situation matter",
    "attains temperatures of several mev @xcite , and the possible existence of such dishomogeneous structures is known to have some relevance for hydrodynamic properties of stellar matter and neutrino transport @xcite .",
    "the interplay between the short - range nuclear force and the long - range non - saturating coulomb interaction is responsible for the existence of such phases .",
    "first calculations of the composition of the stellar crust were done using the liquid drop model or in the thomas - fermi approximation @xcite with an a - priori assumption on the different species constituting the matter @xcite , or on the shape of the pasta structures @xcite : the preferred shape was essentially determined by the balance between surface and coulomb energies . in these studies , as well as in more recent ones along the same lines",
    "@xcite , charge neutrality is imposed only globally while charge fluctuations are allowed on any ( small ) scale , meaning that the effect of the electron background is neglected",
    ". then the problem reduces @xcite to a simple application of gibbs phase - coexistence conditions in multi - fluid systems @xcite . as a consequence , the transition from the homogeneous outer core to the pasta phase(s )",
    "is systematically considered as first order in all these works .    however , the conditions to define a thermodynamic limit in systems involving non - saturating forces are not trivial and phase transitions may have specific properties analogous to those discussed for finite systems @xcite . in this paper we show that the suppression of one thermodynamic degree of freedom due to the divergence of the coulomb energy - density for any net charge at the thermodynamic limit implies the disappearance of phase transitions or a modification of their order .",
    "specifically , we show that the crust - core transition is not first order but continuous .",
    "another limitation of the first seminal works on the phase structure of stellar matter is that most calculations were done in the mean - field approximation , which is known to be especially poor in describing phase transitions .",
    "recent calculations with semiclassical models beyond the mean field @xcite naturally include thermal fluctuations and allow the rearrangement of the proton distribution due to the coulomb field under the explicit constraint of charge neutrality .",
    "the inclusion of such fluctuations was expected to lead to an increased matter opacity to neutrino scattering with important consequences on the supernova cooling dynamics @xcite .",
    "such a coherent neutrino - matter scattering is not only expected at low temperature , where the pasta - core transition was supposed to be first order , but even more in the case of the occurrence of a critical point in the post - bounce supernova dynamics with the associated phenomenon of critical opalescence @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , the expected increase in the static form factor is not observed in finite - temperature molecular - dynamics calculations @xcite , indicating a fluctuation suppression respect to the simplistic scenario of a first - order phase transition .    on the basis of simple scaling arguments ,",
    "we show in this paper that critical behaviors can survive up to the thermodynamic limit only if the particle - density fluctuations associated with the mixed pasta phases do not correspond , close to the critical point , to charge - density fluctuations . in turn , this would imply a strong increase with temperature of free - proton drip or , alternatively , a very strong polarization of the electron field , leading to a complete charge screening of the pasta structures .",
    "since both effects are likely to be unphysical , critical fluctuations and the associated critical opalescence are expected to be quenched .",
    "let us consider the dense matter in neutron - star crusts and supernova cores formed of electrons ( @xmath0 ) , neutrons ( @xmath1 ) and protons ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the microscopic hamiltonian reads @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the nuclear strong interaction including the nucleon kinetic energy , @xmath5 is the electron kinetic term and @xmath6 is the coulomb interaction between different types of particles ( @xmath7 ) : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the fine - structure constant and @xmath10 is the local density of the particle of type @xmath11 and charge @xmath12 .    since the coulomb field is a long - range interaction , the existence of a thermodynamics , i.e. the convergence of a thermodynamic limit and the equivalence between statistical ensembles ,",
    "is not guaranteed @xcite .",
    "let us first consider the canonical ensemble with densities @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the volume containing a number @xmath15 of particles @xmath16 , @xmath2 or @xmath0 . if the net charge density @xmath17 is not strictly zero at the thermodynamic limit , the coulomb energy per unit volume @xmath18 diverges .",
    "the strict charge neutrality demanded by the thermodynamic limit guarantees the additivity of thermodynamic potentials as well as ensemble equivalence .",
    "indeed , the monopole contribution to the coulomb energy between two separated neutral systems is identically zero .",
    "the longer - range multipole interaction is the dipole - dipole term @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the dipole moment in each subsystem .",
    "this moment is proportional to @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the localized charge number and @xmath23 the maximum size of the actual dipole . to avoid the divergence of the coulomb - energy density",
    ", @xmath22 must scale at maximum proportionally to @xmath24 indicating the convergence of the dipole part of the inter - system energy density , and the additivity of the two subsystems at the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this reasoning can be extended to all multipole - multipole interactions .",
    "the coulomb interaction between neutral systems then behaves like short - range interactions @xcite , leading to ensemble equivalence according to the standard demonstration of the van hove theorem .",
    "it is important to remark that the strict neutrality constraint discussed above is very different from the trivial condition of global charge neutrality of the stellar object , which is universally recognized .",
    "we have just argued that neutrality is a necessary thermodynamic condition : this means that charge dishomogeneities can appear only at the microscopic level and no locally charged domain can exist at a macroscopic scale , even if this scale is small compared to the size of the star . from a practical point of view , this means that in hydrodynamical calculations the condition @xmath25 has to be imposed at every location @xmath26 , and that this neutrality constraint must be explicitly applied at the scale of the wigner seitz cell in neutron - star crusts .",
    "this can have important effects on the phase structure of matter even if the electron background is assumed to be uniform , as we develop in great detail in the next sections .",
    "the important consequence of the charge - neutrality constraint is that the canonical free - energy density @xmath27 is defined only for @xmath28 .",
    "hence @xmath29 with @xmath30 and the chemical potential associated with @xmath31 can not be defined since the free energy is not differentiable in the total - charge direction .",
    "we can notice that this can also be deduced in a grand - canonical treatment .",
    "indeed the divergence of the coulomb - energy density for @xmath32 forces the grand - canonical partitions to fulfill the constraint @xmath33 exactly for all couples of chemical potentials @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "if the chemical potentials associated with @xmath31 and @xmath36 are introduced in the form @xmath37 and @xmath38 respectively , the grand potential per unit volume @xmath39 results independent of @xmath40 , so that @xmath41 .",
    "indeed , densities are grand - potential derivatives : the condition on the total charge @xmath42 then corresponds to a flat grand - potential in the chemical - potential direction @xmath43 .",
    "this suppression of one degree of freedom arises from the thermodynamic limit and should not be confused with an additional constraint as it is often done in the literature , where the two conditions of charge neutrality ( expressed as @xmath44 ) and @xmath45 equilibrium ( expressed as @xmath46 ) are treated on the same footing @xcite or confused @xcite .",
    "additional constraints , such as constant particle fraction or chemical ( @xmath45 ) equilibrium , may or may not be realized in the supernova evolution ; they are restrictions of the accessible states and do not affect the thermodynamical properties , which are state functions .",
    "conversely , charge neutrality has to be fulfilled for each ( macroscopic ) physical state .",
    "this changes the the number of degrees of freedom of the thermodynamic potentials , which directly affects the thermodynamics .",
    "in particular , phase coexistence can occur only between two neutral phases .",
    "the practical consequences of this thermodynamic requirement are detailed in the next sections .",
    "mev in the mean - field approximation , obtained with the sly230a interaction . without coulomb interaction : nnm ( neutral nuclear matter ) .",

    "dotted line : nuclear matter with electrons at t = 0 . ]",
    "these considerations are especially relevant when phase transitions are concerned .",
    "phase transitions should be analyzed by looking at the derivative and curvature properties of @xmath27 in the three - dimensional state - variable space @xmath47 in particular , a first - order phase transition at a given temperature identifies with the linear behavior of the free - energy density @xmath27 between at least two points @xmath48 and @xmath49 , meaning that all intensive parameters in @xmath50 and @xmath51 are equal @xcite",
    ". however , since the chemical potential associated with the total charge is not a thermodynamic variable , the condition @xmath52 does not imply as it is often assumed in the literature @xcite that the chemical potentials @xmath34 and @xmath53 are both identical in the two phases ( @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) .",
    "the difference in the chemical potential of charged particles is counterbalanced by the coulomb force : as some electrons move from one phase to the other driven by the chemical - potential difference , the coulomb force reacts forbidding a macroscopic charge to appear . to illustrate this point",
    ", we consider a mean - field approximation , where the free energy of the system is defined as the sum of independent baryon @xmath56 and electron @xmath57 free energies , @xmath58 to spot a phase transition we can study the convexity anomalies of @xmath27 looking at the curvature matrix @xmath59 where we have introduced the chemical potentials @xmath60 @xmath61 , @xmath62 @xmath63 and @xmath64 @xmath65 .",
    "the additional term @xmath66 in the matrix modifies the stability conditions with respect to the nuclear - matter part , i.e. to the curvature of @xmath56 . in general",
    ", we can expect a quenching of the instability : since the electron susceptibility @xmath67 is always positive , the instability conditions corresponding to @xmath68 or @xmath69 are more difficult to fulfill . moreover , due to their very small mass , electrons are almost always a relativistic degenerate fermi gas : @xmath70 since @xmath67 is large at subsaturation densities , the quenching is expected to be strong .",
    "a quantitative application is shown in fig.1 , which displays the minimal eigenvalue of the free - energy curvature matrix eq.([curvature ] ) as a function of the isospin asymmetry @xmath71 , evaluated with the effective sly230a skyrme interaction @xcite .    at the thermodynamic limit , the nuclear free - energy density appearing in eq.([free_energy",

    "@xmath83 : @xmath84 all averages are thermal averages over the modified single - particle fermi distribution @xmath85    from figure 1 we can see that ordinary neutral nuclear matter ( nnm ) shows a wide unstable ( spinodal ) region characterized by a direction of negative convexity of the free energy . in this region ,",
    "any density fluctuation of homogeneous matter is spontaneously amplified , and leads to phase separation .",
    "this result is drastically modified considering charged nuclear matter neutralized by an electron gas ( cnm+e ) : the free energy is everywhere convex , and this stays true at zero temperature ( dashed line ) . since the extension of the spinodal region monotonically decreases with increasing temperatures , this latter result implies that stellar matter does not present any thermodynamic instability in this model .",
    "this quenching is due to the fact that matter dishomogeneities cause charge dishomogeneities , which can not be fully screened by the electron gas because of its high incompressibility , and are thus forbidden at any ( macroscopic ) scale . as a consequence ,",
    "the different structures in the stellar crust ( free nucleons and nuclei , bubbles or pasta ) have to be considered as intrinsically microscopic objects , and can not be treated as different phases in coexistence , obeying standard phase equilibrium rules , as it is often done in the literature @xcite .",
    "we will see in section [ subsec : pasta - ext ] that such microscopic charge fluctuations naturally appear beyond the mean field , and they indeed dominate the density region between the liquid core and the gazeous outer crust .",
    "such structures are however associated to an important energetic cost , which , as we will demonstrate , leads to an expansion of the dishomogeneous phase .",
    "if the qualitative effect of electron quenching of the instability is independent of the model , the net quantitative effect on the spinodal zone depends on the parameters of the nuclear interaction : the different skyrme forces we have analyzed @xcite all lead to a complete instability suppression , while a small spinodal region still subsists at zero temperature in nl3 rmf stellar matter calculations @xcite .      in order to expose how the charge - neutrality constraint affects the thermodynamics of star matter , we now study the core - crust transition in two different approaches .",
    "one corresponds to the physical situation , for which electro - neutrality has to be ensured by the correlation between proton and electron density distributions .",
    "for the other approach , we consider a model system where each charged particle species is independently neutralized by a uniform background of opposite charge .",
    "the modified hamiltonian reads @xmath86 where the interaction with the opposite background charge has been subtracted to the various coulomb terms @xmath87 with @xmath88 this system does not present any divergence so that the free energy @xmath89 can always be defined . when @xmath90 the introduced backgrounds cancel out exactly . in this case , the canonical ensemble of our initial stellar problem is equivalent to the canonical ensemble of the modified coulomb system along the @xmath33 surface : @xmath91 the two pressures are connected by the relation @xmath92 where the chemical potentials @xmath93 of the different species @xmath94 @xmath95 @xmath96 are linked to the physical chemical potentials by the relations @xmath97 , @xmath98 .",
    "let us however notice that this equivalence breaks down in phase coexistence , since a phase mixture in the neutralized model belongs to the physical model only if @xmath99 in each phase separately .    in the neutralized coulomb system ,",
    "all chemical potentials and densities are allowed .",
    "this model may present phase transitions according to the usual phenomenology of multifluid systems @xcite .",
    "in particular , first - order phase transitions are characterized by the equality of all intensive parameters between two points @xmath100 and @xmath101 of the particle - density space : @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "the linear behavior of @xmath104 between @xmath100 and @xmath101 corresponds to a single point in the intensive - parameter space @xmath105 with different densities ( i.e. pressure derivatives ) on both sides .",
    "an illustration of this approach is given by figures 2 and 3 , presenting mean - field calculations of such neutralized model , where nuclear and electron contributions are treated independently .",
    "the strong hamiltonian is parametrized by the skyrme sly230a interaction @xcite and the nuclear - matter thermodynamics is evaluated within the mean - field approximation , as in the previous section @xcite .",
    "until a critical temperature , nuclear matter ( nnm ) presents a first - order liquid - gas phase transition .",
    "electrons , conversely , are treated as a single homogeneous fermi gas .",
    "this results in a violation of the relation @xmath106 in each phase , since we have @xmath107 in the dense ( dilute ) phase .",
    "in other words , @xmath108 is an order parameter of the phase coexistence .",
    "this is permitted within the neutralized model where proton and electron charge are independently cancelled in each phase according to eq.([eq : fluct ] ) , suppressing the coulomb contribution .     as a function of the proton and electron chemical potential for a neutralized coulomb system at fixed temperature and neutron chemical potential , with the sly230a effective interaction .",

    "figure 2 emphasizes the role of @xmath31 as an order parameter for a phase coexistence occurring in the neutralized model . in the neutron - star phenomenology",
    ", this neutralized system corresponds to nuclear - matter calculations @xcite which do not explicitly impose the neutrality constraint on the scale of the wigner - seitz cell .",
    "the high - density phase represents the homogeneous liquid core , while the low - density one is the unbound vapor .",

    "the corresponding path is represented on figure 3 as a projection in the chemical - potential plane ( @xmath112,@xmath111 ) , for different values of the neutron chemical potential @xmath114 .",
    "starting from a high - density homogeneous system , and decreasing the density , the liquid - gas phase coexistence is reached at point @xmath115 .",
    "afterwards , the global requirement @xmath99 has to be fulfilled by phase coexistence between two phases for which @xmath116 .",

    "similar features are found for any fixed under - critical temperature .",
    "however , this does not correspond to the physical situation , where electro - neutrality imposes @xmath99 at any macroscopic scale .",
    "let us consider the line @xmath99 represented on figure 2 . in the neutralized model ,",
    "this path crosses a coexistence region ( n - l portion ) . turning to the physical system",
    ", the states of this region can not be described in terms of phase coexistence , as discussed previously : they instead consist in microscopic fluctuations constituting a single dishomogeneous phase . in this restrained @xmath99 subspace ,",
    "the grand - potential derivatives remains continuous ( _ e.g. _ proton density evolves continuously ) : the physical free energy does not present a linear behavior , which means that the phase transition is no more of first order .",
    "however , the path @xmath99 is non - analytical when it enters the region of @xmath31 discontinuity ( points @xmath115 and @xmath119 on figure 2 ) .",
    "the pressure is non - analytical at such points , which trace continuous transitions in the physical system .    to summarize , as the neutralized - model system enters the coexistence region and undergoes a first order phase transition , the physical system restrained to the subspace @xmath99 turns into a dishomogeneous phase _ via _ a continuous transition .",
    "the only way to keep a first - order phase transition in the physical system would be to have no @xmath120 discontinuity at the phase transition in the neutralized system , which could be realized only if the electron distribution followed closely the proton distribution leading to a complete screening .    in the neutron - star phenomenology ,",
    "the mixed phase consists in a coulomb lattice of neutron - rich nuclei at zero temperature , or the pasta phase(s ) at finite temperature .",
    "most calculations presented in literature treat the electron dynamics at the mean - field level either by considering electrons as a uniform background @xcite , or allowing for a slight polarization of the electron gas , leading to a screening length of some tens of fm @xcite .",
    "an explicit calculation of the electron screening in the rmf coupled to the electric field @xcite confirms this assumption . in this condition ,",
    "the clusters ( nuclei or pasta ) show a net positive charge at their ( microscopic ) scale , meaning that the total charge is an order parameter for the transition in the model neutralized system . as a result",
    ", the physical crust matter can not be described as a phase coexistence : the core - crust transition occurs between uniform matter and a mixed phase presenting microscopic dishomogeneities .",
    "this transition is necessarily continuous , contrary to what is almost universally assumed in the literature @xcite . of course",
    ", for such dishomogeneous structures to emerge , calculations beyond the mean field are necessary , as will be discussed in the next section . in this case",
    "the phase diagram can be more complicated and present other bifurcations if the different pasta structures , here represented by a single coexistence region , correspond to different phases as suggested by molecular - dynamics calculations @xcite .",

    "the right and left parts of the figure give two different ways of fixing the critical exponents .",
    "none of them gives a coherent scaling of all the quantities . ]    turning now to the mixed - phase phenomenology of high - temperature supernova cores , it is interesting to remark that long - range coulomb interactions also strongly affect critical behaviors .",
    "indeed , the coulomb - energy density can be expressed as a function of charge fluctuations as @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the charge - density fluctuation , and translational and rotational invariance imposes @xmath125 . if the electron screening is a small effect even at high temperature , i.e. if @xmath31 keeps being an order parameter up to the critical point , then @xmath126 is expected to scale as @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the space dimensionality and @xmath129 is a critical exponent which turns out to be close to zero in most physical systems ( @xmath130 for the liquid - gas universality class ) . a critical point",
    "would then correspond to a divergent coulomb energy .",
    "hence , only three behaviors are allowed .",
    "either the critical temperature goes to infinity , or the order parameter becomes independent of the total charge or the phase transition in the neutralized system ends at a first - order point . the corresponding second - order point in the physical system",
    "can not then be a critical point , and critical opalescence is suppressed .",
    "concerning supernova cores , the presence of critical opalescence may have important consequences on the opacity to neutrino scattering @xcite , and neutrino transport is crucial for simulation studies of supernova explosions @xcite . according to this qualitative argument , we do not expect a strong increase of matter opacity to neutrino scattering . to have some quantitative estimation , it is clear that calculations of stellar phase structure going beyond the mean - field approximation are necessary .",

    "even if at the ending point of the coexistence region the correlation length may not diverge as discussed in the previous section , we can still expect that it will be characterized by large correlated structures . as we infer from eq.([eq : fluct ] ) and eq.([crit ] ) , in the neutralized system the coulomb energy will be minimized in homogeneous partitions corresponding to pure phases , and it will be maximal in clusterized partitions .",
    "this increase of the energy difference between the pure phases and the mixed phase results in an extension of the coexistence region , _",

    "fig.5 shows that this is not true once the phase diagram is numerically calculated from the exact hamiltonian without any mean - field approximation .",
    "the limiting temperature decreases with the lattice size for nnm fulfilling finite - size scaling with standard 3d - ising exponents @xcite , while it is almost completely independent of @xmath115 when coulomb is accounted for , reflecting the finite correlation lenght at the limiting point and criticality quenching discussed in the previous section .",
    "more important , the limiting temperature is increased for increasing strenght of the coulomb field ( about 6% for the proton fraction @xmath175 considered in fig.5 ) .",
    "this expansion of the coexistence region is due to the energy cost of fragmented inhomogeneous configurations at @xmath176 respect to the the largely uniform proton - charge distribution in pure phases , whose coulomb energy is almost exactly compensated by the electron background .",

    ", the coexistence - region expansion is specific of the stellar problem , while other physical systems subject to coulomb frustration exhibit the opposite behavior .",
    "this is notably the case of frustrated ising ferromagnets , as well as of finite atomic nuclei . in such cases",
    "the coulomb repulsion is known to reduce the limiting temperature @xcite .",
    "this reduction is also a usual expectation in the astrophysical context @xcite .",
    "an amplification of the mixed - phase region at zero temperature has already been reported in ref.@xcite . in this work a consistent treatment of the proton - density rearrangement effect due to the coulomb field under the constraint of strict charge neutrality in the wigner seitz cell is seen to de - favour , at each given total density , the formation of large charged structures ( rods respect to droplets , bubbles respect to tubes ) .",
    "the net effect is a density amplification of the mixed phase .",
    "our results imply that this effect should persist at finite temperature .",
    "an increase of the maximum temperature for the coexistence region might be expected , and the mixed - phase phenomenology may be relevant for the proto - neutron - star structure in a wider temperature range than usually expected @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have shown that long - range coulomb forces in dense stellar matter require a non - trivial discussion on the definition of the thermodynamic limit .",
    "when the constraint of total charge is not strictly zero , the divergence of the coulomb energy implies that the chemical potential associated with the total charge loses its thermodynamic meaning .",
    "hence , the grand potential , i.e. the system pressure , and its derivatives , i.e. the particle densities , result independent of the charge chemical potential .",
    "the suppression of a thermodynamic degree of freedom strongly affects the thermodynamics of the charged system and the phase - transition phenomenology . in general",
    ", the coulomb field modifies the non - analytical properties of the partition sums and changes the order of the transitions : the first - order core - crust transition obtained when the coulomb energy is disregarded , turns into a continuous transition from the homogeneous core phase to a mixed phase ( the so called pasta phases ) , when the coulomb energy is accounted for",
    ". a critical point can be found at finite temperature if and only if the net charge does not present fluctuations . only in this case ,",
    "critical opalescence in stellar matter can be compatible with the long - range coulomb force .      ,",
