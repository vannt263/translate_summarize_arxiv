    "in this note , we will show that a metric of the homogeneous riemannian manifold @xmath0 with strictly positive curvature is deformed to a metric with some negative sectional curvature by the ricci flow .",
    "this result has been announced by bhm and wilking [ bw ] in which they assert that this can be proved using a method similar to the one they used to show that a metric of positive sectional curvature on @xmath1 can be flowed to one with some negative ricci curvature .",
    "we use a different and simpler approach to prove this result .",
    "we will show that if we initiate the ricci flow at a metric on the boundary of the metrics with positive sectional then the derivative of the flow of sectional curvature at a plane of zero curvature is negative for the all of the examples in [ w ] .",
    "we also show that for all the examples in [ w ] ( dimension 6,12,24 ) the ricci flow can cause the ricci tensor to go from positive definite to signature @xmath2 ( @xmath3 . in the concluding remarks to the paper we give a simple variant of valiev s necessary and sufficient condition for a homogeneous metric on one of the spaces to have strictly positive sectional curvature .",
    "we would like to thank lei ni for suggesting that we look at the curvature transition of the @xmath4 dimensional space in [ w ] under the ricci flow and for his patience as we were trying to understand the subtleties of the argument in [ bw ] for the twelve dimensional example .",
    "in this section , we will set up the notation for the main calculations and establish the ricci flow equations in terms of the metric parameters .",
    "set @xmath5 or compact @xmath6 and let @xmath7 be respectively a maximal torus , @xmath8 , of @xmath9 , @xmath10 in @xmath11 or @xmath12 in compact @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath13 be the lie algebra of @xmath14 , @xmath15 be the lie algebra of a @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath16 be the @xmath17invariant complement to @xmath15 in @xmath13 .",
    "then @xmath16 can be decomposes into a direct sum of three irreducible inequivalent @xmath7-invariant subspaces @xmath18 .",
    "consider the ad@xmath19-invariant inner product @xmath20 re tr@xmath21 on @xmath13 for the first two examples and in the case of @xmath22 the unique @xmath23-invariant inner product that agrees with our choice for the imbedded @xmath11 that is compatible with the decompositions .",
    "the dimensions of the real vector spaces @xmath24 are the same in each case and are respectively @xmath25or @xmath26 in each case we may identify the spaces @xmath24 with the fields over @xmath27 : @xmath28 , @xmath29(the quaternions ) , @xmath30(the octonions ) such that the inner product is @xmath31 . if @xmath32 then @xmath33\\in v_{3}$ ] and under our identification corresponds to @xmath34 in @xmath35similarly with sign changes as in the cross - product @xmath36\\in v_{k}$ ] if @xmath37 are distinct ..",
    "schur s lemma implies that any @xmath7-invariant inner product on @xmath38 is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 are positive constants .",
    "let @xmath41 be the riemannian structure on @xmath42 corresponding to @xmath43 .",
    "we will write @xmath44 . in [ aw ]",
    "it was proved that if @xmath45 then for all examples above the sectional curvature is strictly positive if @xmath46 or @xmath47 .",
    "we note    if @xmath48 then the sectional curvature is is strictly positive if @xmath49 or @xmath50 and there is some strictly negative curvature if @xmath51 .",
    "we need only prove the assertion about negative curvature .",
    "we may assume that @xmath52we consider the embedding of @xmath9 into @xmath14 so that @xmath8 imbeds in @xmath7 and the the imbedding of the complement to @xmath53 in @xmath54 , @xmath55 , imbeds in @xmath38 as @xmath28 imbeds in @xmath29 or @xmath30 .",
    "we note that if @xmath56 @xmath55 then the formula in lemma 7.3 of [ w ] reduces the calculation to the case of @xmath57we compute a specific curvature @xmath58{ccc}0 & u_{1 } & u_{2}\\\\ -u_{1 } & 0 & u_{3}\\\\ -u_{2 } & -u_{3 } & 0 \\end{array } \\right ]   , v=\\left [ \\begin{array } [ c]{ccc}0 & v_{1 } & v_{2}\\\\ -v_{1 } & 0 & v_{3}\\\\ -v_{2 } & -v_{3 } & 0 \\end{array } \\right]\\ ] ] with @xmath59 with @xmath60 . then with @xmath61@xmath62 so if @xmath63 with @xmath64 and @xmath65 then the curvature corresponding to the two plane @xmath66 is negative .",
    "this shows that the there is negative gaussian curvature for any @xmath67 so my condition is necessary and sufficient .",
    "we also note that schur s lemma implies that the ricci curvature of @xmath41 , denoted ric@xmath68 , is given by @xmath69 using the ( first ) lemma 7.1 in [ w ] it is easily seen that @xmath70 is given by @xmath71 where @xmath72    we note that the ricci flow preserves left invariant metrics on the spaces @xmath73 and hence can be considered to be the ordinary differential equation@xmath74 in particular we see that the set of metrics with @xmath75 for some @xmath76 is preserved by the ricci flow .",
    "also , permutation of the indices of the @xmath77 preserves the solutions .",
    "in this section we will prove that the ricci flow deforms some metric @xmath41 with strictly positive curvature into metric with some negative sectional curvature . to start with",
    ", we investigate the metric @xmath78 which , in light of lemma 2.1 is of nonnegative sectional curvature and @xmath79 , @xmath80 has some strictly negative curvature . using the symmetric invariance of the system ( 2.4 )",
    "we note that if we start with @xmath81 under the ricci flow the metric @xmath82 satisfies @xmath83 .",
    "our strategy to prove that some curvature turns negative is to show that @xmath84 this will say that there exists @xmath85 such that @xmath86 with @xmath87 and @xmath88 with @xmath89 , so lemma 2.1 implies our assertion .",
    "we now carry out the calculation.@xmath90 so ( 2.4 ) implies that@xmath91 in the three cases ( @xmath92 ) we have @xmath93 .",
    "we have proved    on the three examples of [ w ] the ricci flow deforms certain positively curved metrics into metrics with mixed sectional curvatures .",
    "we note that this result for the @xmath94 dimensional example follows from [ bw ] .",
    "we first indicate why the method of the last section does nt work for ricci curvature .",
    "we consider the case when @xmath48 and calculate @xmath95 we therefor see in ( light of ( 3.2 ) ) that if @xmath96 then @xmath97 . so if we started the ricci flow with a ( positive curvature ) initial condition @xmath98 then @xmath99 is decreasing .",
    "if initially @xmath100 then under the flow we would have @xmath101 .",
    "if @xmath102 then @xmath103 thus @xmath104 is a repelling ( i.e unstable fixed point ) and @xmath105  @xmath106 is an attractor .",
    "the upshot is that if the initial condition is @xmath48 and the sectional curvature is positive then @xmath107 for the entire ricci flow . on the other hand the ricci tensor for @xmath48",
    "is given by@xmath108 thus if we begin the ricci flow with a metric of positive curvature and @xmath48 then @xmath109 which implies that@xmath110 and @xmath111 this indicates how delicate the methods of [ bw ] must be .",
    "we observe that if the initial condition satisfies @xmath112 then the flow will stay among the homogeneous metrics satisfying this condition .",
    "since ricci curvature is invariant under constant scalar multiples of the metric we may assume that our initial metric corresponds to @xmath113 and @xmath114 ( notice that lemma 2.1 implies that if @xmath114 is fixed and @xmath115 is sufficiently small then the metric has positive sectional curvature ) .",
    "we also note that ( 2.3 ) implies that if @xmath113 then the coefficients of the ricci curvature are given by@xmath116@xmath117 and@xmath118 thus if @xmath114 and @xmath119 then @xmath120 and @xmath121 are strictly positive .",
    "if we solve the quadratic equation for @xmath122 then we have for the cases @xmath92",
    "respectively@xmath123@xmath124 and@xmath125 we note that if we substitute these values of @xmath115 into the above coefficients of the ricci tensor then  we find that if @xmath114 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "so if we show that if we take our initial condition at such a value @xmath128 we will have shown that the ricci flow transitions from positive definite to signature @xmath2 ( @xmath129 negatives ) .",
    "we therefore study@xmath130 at these values we find that if @xmath131 then this expression is negative for @xmath132 @xmath133 for @xmath134 the expression is negative for @xmath135 @xmath136 @xmath137 and for @xmath138 the expression is negative for@xmath139 ( @xmath140this proves    for all the examples in [ w ] ( i.e. the manifold of flags in the two  dimensional projective space over @xmath28 , @xmath29 or @xmath30)the ricci flow of a metric with positive definite ricci tensor can flow to one with signature @xmath2 .",
    "in this section we will give a necessary and sufficient condition that the metric corresponding to @xmath43 have positive curvature for the three types of examples that we have been studying .",
    "we compare this condition to what is necessary for positive ricci curvature and one , thereby , gets a better understanding of the result in [ bw ] .",
    "we first observe that the permutation action of the symmetric group permutes the @xmath43 that correspond to strictly positive curvature among themselves .",
    "we have also completely described the @xmath43 with some pair @xmath75 with @xmath141 .",
    "thus we are left with the cases where @xmath142 using the action of the symmetric group just described we may assume that @xmath143 ( we chose this order to be consistent with the results of [ bw ] . since a multiplication by a positive scalar does nt change the sign of curvature",
    "we may assume that @xmath144 and @xmath145 with @xmath146 and @xmath147the following result follows directly from theorem 3 a ) in [ v ] .",
    "the axes are horizontal , @xmath151 , and vertical , @xmath115 , the set points under each curve represent the @xmath115 values for each @xmath151 value such that @xmath152 with @xmath146 and @xmath149 respectively satisfies the necessary condition above ( lowest curve , blue ) , the necessary and sufficient condition for positive ricci curvature for the @xmath4 ( second curve , red ) , @xmath153(third curve , yellow ) and @xmath154 ( top curve , green ) dimensional examples .",
    "we note that to get the full set of metrics with strictly positive curvature satisfying the inequalities @xmath155 one must allow the points @xmath156 , @xmath149 and @xmath157 with @xmath158 ( that is add the the original set given in [ aw ] ) .    in the argument in [ bw ]",
    "they start their ricci flow at a metric corresponding to @xmath43 such that @xmath159 ( in our notation ) and @xmath146 , @xmath149 ( the reason for our strange condition ) . in light of the above @xmath160",
    "must be below the blue curve in the graph above . in the ricci flow ( normalized or not )",
    "the set @xmath112 is preserved .",
    "if @xmath161 is a point in the flow  and @xmath162 then their the curve @xmath163 starts at @xmath164 under the lowest ( blue ) curve ( so as to have positive curvature ) and it must eventually cross the yellow ( second highest ) curve in order to have some negative ricci curvature ."
