    "an important problem in knot theory is that of determining all incompressible surfaces in a given knot complement . the purpose of this paper is to give a characterization of all @xmath5-knots which admit a closed meridionally incompressible surface in their complement .",
    "the family of @xmath5-knots is an interesting class of knots which has received considerable attention recently ( see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "recall that @xmath4 is a @xmath5-knot if there is a standard torus @xmath6 in @xmath1 such that @xmath4 is of 1-bridge with respect to @xmath6 , that is , @xmath4 intersects @xmath6 in two points , which divide @xmath4 into two arcs which are parallel to arcs lying on @xmath6 .",
    "the family of @xmath5-knots contains the torus knots , 2-bridge knots , and is contained in the class of tunnel number one knots .",
    "recall that a knot @xmath4 has tunnel number one if there exists an arc @xmath7 embedded in @xmath1 , with @xmath8 , such that @xmath9 is a genus 2-handlebody .",
    "some results are known about incompressible surfaces in complements of tunnel number one knots , and in particular about @xmath5-knots .",
    "it is known that the complement of a tunnel number one knot does not contain any essential meridional planar surface , i.e a planar surface which is incompressible , @xmath10-incompressible and whose boundary consists of meridians of the knot @xcite .",
    "there are tunnel number one knots whose complement contains an essential torus ; such knots have been classified by k. morimoto and m. sakuma @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , and it turns out that all of them are @xmath5-knots . the author constructed for any @xmath11 , infinitely many tunnel number one knots whose complement contains a closed incompressible and meridionally incompressible surface of genus @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "many of these knots are @xmath5-knots .",
    "the construction given in @xcite is roughly as follows ( see section 2 for more details ) :    take @xmath13 parallel tori @xmath14 , standardly embedded in @xmath1 , and take an essential curve @xmath15 in each one of the tori . take @xmath16 straight arcs @xmath17 joining consecutive curves .",
    "the union of the curves and the arcs form a graph @xmath18 , which we call a toroidal graph .",
    "note that @xmath19 is a handlebody of genus @xmath13 .",
    "if the curves @xmath15 satisfy certain natural conditions then @xmath20 is incompressible in @xmath21 .",
    "let @xmath22 be a neighborhood of @xmath15 in the torus @xmath23 , this is an annulus .",
    "now let @xmath4 be a knot in level position with respect to @xmath18 ; by this we mean that @xmath24 , such that @xmath25 consists of two arcs for @xmath26 , @xmath25 is one arc for @xmath27 , and @xmath28 consists of two straight arcs .",
    "it follows that @xmath4 is a @xmath5-knot , and if @xmath4 is well wrapped in @xmath19 , then @xmath29 is incompressible in @xmath30 .    in section 3 we show that if @xmath4 is a @xmath5-knot and @xmath29 is a closed meridionally incompressible surface in its complement , then @xmath4 and @xmath29 come from the above construction . to do that , consider first the following equivalent definition of @xmath5-knots",
    "let @xmath31 , where @xmath32 $ ] , and @xmath6 is an standard torus .",
    "a knot @xmath4 is a @xmath5-knot if and only if @xmath4 lies in @xmath33 , so that @xmath34 is an arc , @xmath35 is an arc , and @xmath36 consists of two straight arcs , i.e. , arcs which cross transversely every torus @xmath37 .",
    "let @xmath4 be a knot in such a position and let @xmath29 be a closed meridionally incompressible surface in the complement of @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath29 can be isotoped , keeping @xmath4 fixed , so that most of @xmath29 lie in the product @xmath33 .",
    "now put @xmath29 in morse position in the product @xmath33 . by analyzing the singular points of the surface",
    "we show that it can be positioned so that it looks like @xmath38 for a certain toroidal graph @xmath18 , and that @xmath4 is in level position with respect to @xmath18 .",
    "the class of @xmath5-knots can be defined for any manifold @xmath0 having a heegaard decomposition of genus 1 , that is , it can be defined for @xmath39 or a lens space @xmath3 .",
    "the definition is the same , where @xmath6 is supposed to be a heegaard torus .",
    "our results are also valid for @xmath5-knots in these manifolds .",
    "our results imply that if in the complement of a @xmath5-knot @xmath4 in @xmath0 there is a closed meridionally incompressible surface , then the surface bounds a handlebody in @xmath0 in which @xmath4 lies . in general the knots constructed in section 6 of @xcite",
    "do not have this property .",
    "so we can construct for any such @xmath0 , many tunnel number one knots which are not @xmath5-knots .",
    "see corollary 1 in section 2 .",
    "let @xmath0 be a compact orientable 3-manifold , and let @xmath40 be a compact orientable surface in @xmath0 , either properly embedded or contained in @xmath41 .",
    "let @xmath4 be a knot in @xmath0 disjoint from @xmath29 .",
    "we say that @xmath29 is meridionally compressible if there is an embedded disk @xmath42 in @xmath0 , with @xmath43 , which is a nontrivial curve in @xmath29 , and so that @xmath4 intersects @xmath42 at most in one point . otherwise @xmath29 is called meridionally incompressible .",
    "in particular , if @xmath29 is meridionally incompressible then it is incompressible in @xmath44 .",
    "if the surface @xmath29 is a 2-sphere , then @xmath29 is usually defined to be incompressible if it is not the boundary of a 3-ball ; similarly we define it to be meridionally incompressible if it is incompressible .    in what follows @xmath0",
    "is @xmath45 , or a lens space @xmath3 .",
    "if @xmath4 is a @xmath5-knot in @xmath0 ( or in general , a tunnel number one knot ) , and @xmath29 is an incompressible sphere in @xmath44 , then it can be proved that @xmath4 is a trivial knot , i.e. , @xmath4 is the boundary of a disk .",
    "so there are two cases of @xmath5-knots which contain an incompressible sphere : 1 ) @xmath46 , or @xmath3 , @xmath4 a trivial knot , and @xmath29 a sphere in @xmath0 bounding a ball in which @xmath4 lies .",
    "2 ) @xmath46 , @xmath4 a trivial knot , and @xmath29 a non - separating sphere in @xmath44 . from now on we will assume that we are not in this situation , that is , we assume that all our surfaces are of genus @xmath47 . if @xmath29 is a closed non - separating surface in the complement of a tunnel number one knot @xmath4 in @xmath0 , then by doing an argument similar to that in @xcite , @xcite , or @xcite , and applied to our situation , it follows that either the knot is trivial or there is a closed non - separating surface in the complement of @xmath4 disjoint from an unknotting tunnel , which is clearly impossible .",
    "so assume in what follows that all surfaces are separating .    in @xcite some constructions",
    "are given of tunnel number one knots whose complements contain a closed meridionally incompressible surface .",
    "the simplest of those knots are also @xmath5-knots .",
    "we describe this construction .",
    "let @xmath6 be a heegaard torus in @xmath0 , and let @xmath32 $ ] .",
    "consider @xmath48 .",
    "@xmath49 bounds a solid torus @xmath50 , and @xmath51 bounds a solid torus @xmath52 , such that @xmath53 .",
    "choose @xmath13 distinct points on @xmath54 , @xmath55 , so that @xmath56 , for all @xmath57 .",
    "consider the tori @xmath58 ( so @xmath59 , @xmath60 ) .",
    "there is a natural projection of each of these tori into @xmath61 .",
    "a slope in @xmath6 is a class of isotopy of essential simple closed curves .",
    "slopes in @xmath37 are in one to one correspondence with slopes in @xmath62 , for any @xmath63 , so comparing curves on different tori is accomplished via this isotopy .",
    "if @xmath64 and @xmath65 are two slopes on @xmath6 , @xmath66 denotes , as usual , their minimal geometric intersection number .",
    "denote by @xmath67 the essential simple closed curve on @xmath68 which bounds a meridional disk in @xmath52 , and denote by @xmath69 the essential simple closed curve on @xmath61 which bounds a disk in @xmath50 .",
    "so @xmath70 if @xmath71 , @xmath72 if @xmath46 , and @xmath73 if @xmath74 .",
    "by a straight arc in a product @xmath75 $ ] we mean a properly embedded arc which is transverse to every torus @xmath37 in the product .",
    "let @xmath15 be a simple closed essential curve embedded in the torus @xmath58 .",
    "let @xmath17 , for @xmath76 , be a straight arc in @xmath77 $ ] , joining @xmath15 and @xmath78 , and assume that @xmath79 if @xmath80 .",
    "let @xmath18 be the 1-complex consisting of the union of all the curves @xmath15 and the arcs @xmath81 .",
    "so @xmath18 is a trivalent graph embedded in @xmath0 .",
    "we say that @xmath18 is a toroidal graph of type @xmath13 , @xmath82 , if it satisfies the following :    1 .",
    "@xmath83 , that is , @xmath84 is not homotopic to the core of the solid torus @xmath50 .",
    "2 .   @xmath85 , for all @xmath57 .",
    "3 .   @xmath86 , that is , @xmath87 is not homotopic to the core of the solid torus @xmath52 .",
    "we define @xmath18 to be a toroidal graph of type 1 , if it consists of a single curve @xmath84 in @xmath61 , such that @xmath83 and @xmath88 .",
    "see figure 1 for an example of a toroidal graph of type 2 in @xmath1 .",
    "figure 1    let @xmath19 be a regular neighborhood of @xmath18 .",
    "this is a genus @xmath13 handlebody .",
    "we can assume that @xmath19 is made of the union of @xmath13 solid tori @xmath89 , which are joined by @xmath90 1-handles @xmath91 .",
    "note that there are disks @xmath92 , properly embedded in @xmath19 , with @xmath93 contained in @xmath91 and intersecting @xmath81 once .",
    "these disks cut @xmath19 into @xmath13 solid tori .",
    "let @xmath18 be a toroidal graph in @xmath0 .",
    "then @xmath20 is incompressible in @xmath94 .",
    "this is proved in theorem 4.1 of @xcite for the case @xmath71 ; the proof in the general case is essentially the same .",
    "note that if any of the conditions for a toroidal graph fails , then @xmath29 will be compressible .",
    "let @xmath95 be a toroidal graph of type @xmath13 , with @xmath82 . denote by @xmath22 a regular neighborhood of @xmath15 in the torus @xmath58 , this is an annulus , we can assume that @xmath96 .",
    "a knot @xmath4 contained in @xmath33 is level with respect to @xmath18 if it satisfies the following :    1 .",
    "@xmath97 consists of one arc contained in @xmath98 .",
    "@xmath99 consists of two arcs contained in @xmath100 , for @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath101 consists of one arc contained in @xmath102 .",
    "@xmath103 consists of two straight arcs contained in @xmath104 , for @xmath105 .    in the special case of a toroidal graph of type 1",
    ", we say that @xmath4 is level with respect to @xmath18 if : ( 1 ) @xmath106 is a single arc contained in @xmath107 , and ( 2 ) @xmath108)$ ] is a single arc which can be projected to an arc on @xmath107 .",
    "so if a knot @xmath4 is level with respect to a toroidal graph of type 1 , it is either a torus knot , or a satellite of a torus knot .",
    "it is not difficult to see that if @xmath4 is level with respect to a toroidal graph @xmath18 then @xmath4 is a @xmath5-knot ; to see this , just isotope @xmath4",
    "so that @xmath36 consists of two straight arcs . by construction , if @xmath4 is level with respect to a toroidal graph @xmath18 , then @xmath4 lies in @xmath19 , and @xmath4 intersects each disk @xmath109 twice . by cutting @xmath4 along the disks @xmath109 , and then joining its endpoints with an arc on @xmath109 , we get @xmath13 knots @xmath110 embedded in @xmath111 respectively .",
    "we say that @xmath4 is well wrapped in @xmath19 if the wrapping number of each @xmath112 in @xmath113 is @xmath114 .",
    "see figure 2 for an example of a knot which is level with respect to the toroidal graph in figure 1 .",
    "figure 2    let @xmath4 be a knot which is level with respect to a toroidal graph @xmath18 of type @xmath13 . assume also that @xmath4 is well wrapped in @xmath19 .",
    "then the closed surface @xmath20 is meridionally incompressible in @xmath44 .",
    "this is proved in theorem 5.1 of @xcite .",
    "it is not difficult to see that if @xmath4 is level with respect to @xmath18 , but it is not well wrapped in @xmath19 then @xmath29 is compressible in @xmath30 .    in this paper",
    "we prove the following ,    let @xmath4 be a @xmath5-knot in @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath29 be a closed meridionally incompressible surface in @xmath44 .",
    "then there is a toroidal graph @xmath18 , so that @xmath20 , and @xmath4 is level with respect to @xmath18 .    in the special case that the surface @xmath29 is a torus ,",
    "this result has been previously proved in @xcite , where all the @xmath5-knots which contain an incompressible torus are determined . in the case that @xmath71 , this result follows from @xcite and @xcite , for in those papers all tunnel number one knots in @xmath1 which contain an essential torus",
    "are determined , and all of them turn out to be @xmath5-knots ( see 4.8 in @xcite ) .",
    "an important problem about @xmath5-knots and meridionally incompressible surfaces that remains open is : _ is it possible for a @xmath5-knot to have two nonisotopic closed meridionally incompressible surfaces ? _ it would be natural to conjecture a negative answer for this question .",
    "such a conjecture has been verified for satellite @xmath5-knots in @xmath1 @xcite . in paticular",
    "this implies that if a @xmath5-knot in @xmath1 contains a closed meridionally incompressible surface of genus @xmath114 in its complement , then it is a hyperbolic knot .",
    "we remark that there are @xmath5-knots which contain closed incompressible , but meridionally compressible surfaces . if a knot contains such a surface @xmath29 , then by doing meridional compressions one gets an incompressible meridional surface @xmath115 , i.e. , a surface which intersects the knot in meridians .",
    "if enough meridional compressions are done then the surface @xmath115 will be meridionally incompressible , that is , if @xmath42 is a disk with @xmath116 , and which intersects @xmath4 in one point , then @xmath117 is parallel in @xmath115 to a boundary component of @xmath115 .",
    "it can be proved that for given integers @xmath118 ( @xmath119 ) , there exist @xmath5-knots in @xmath1 ( @xmath2 or @xmath3 ) which contain a meridionally incompressible surface of genus @xmath12 with @xmath120 punctures @xcite . a similar result for tunnel number one",
    "knots in @xmath1 was proved previously in @xcite , but those knots do not seem to be @xmath5-knots .",
    "this contrasts with the main result of @xcite , which shows that if a tunnel number one knot contains an incompressible meridional surface of genus @xmath121 then @xmath0 has a @xmath2 or @xmath3 summand .",
    "given a tunnel number one knot @xmath4 , it is a difficult problem to determine if @xmath4 is a @xmath5-knot .",
    "a method for determining this for knots in @xmath1 is done in @xcite , by using some computations coming from quantum invariants , and some explicit examples are given .",
    "another approach is given in @xcite , where the existence of such knots is proved , but no explicit example is given .",
    "we can give more examples of such phenomena .",
    "theorem 3 implies that if a @xmath5-knot @xmath4 contains a closed , meridionally incompressible surface , then the surface bounds a handlebody in @xmath0 in which @xmath4 lies .",
    "but in general , the knots constructed in section 6 of @xcite do not have this property .",
    "that construction was done for knots in @xmath1 , but it is not difficult to see that it works with the obvious modifications for knots in @xmath2 or in a lens space @xmath3 .",
    "in particular we have ,    let @xmath4 be a knot as in theorem 2 .",
    "let @xmath122 be an iterate of @xmath4 as in theorem 6.4 of @xcite .",
    "then @xmath122 is a tunnel number one knot which is not a @xmath5-knot .",
    "this shows that there exists tunnel number one knots in @xmath2 or in a lens space @xmath3 which are not @xmath5-knots , and explicit examples are easy to construct .",
    "those seem to be the first examples of that phenomenon .",
    "consider @xmath123 , where @xmath6 is a heegaard torus for @xmath0 , and let @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath50 , @xmath52 be as in section 2 .",
    "let @xmath4 be a @xmath5-knot , and assume that @xmath4 lies in @xmath33 , such that @xmath34 is an arc , @xmath35 is an arc , and @xmath36 consists of two straight arcs .",
    "let @xmath129 be the height function , where we choose @xmath121 to be the highest point , and @xmath130 the lowest .",
    "we may assume that the height function on @xmath115 is a morse function .",
    "so there is a finite set of different points @xmath131 in @xmath54 , so that @xmath115 is tangent to @xmath132 at exactly one point , and this singularity can be a local maximum , a local minimum , or a simple saddle . for any @xmath133 , @xmath134 intersects @xmath115 transversely , so for any such @xmath135 , @xmath136 consists of a finite collection of simple closed curves called level curves , and at a saddle point @xmath137 , either one level curve of @xmath115 splits into two level curves , or two level curves are fused into one curve .",
    "define the complexity of @xmath29 by the pair @xmath138 ( where @xmath139 denotes the number of points if @xmath140 is a finite set , and the number of connected components if it is a surface ; give to such pairs the lexicographical order ) .",
    "assume that @xmath29 has been isotoped so that @xmath141 is minimal .",
    "suppose one of the surfaces is compressible , say @xmath115 , and let @xmath42 be a compression disk , which has to be disjoint from @xmath4 .",
    "then @xmath117 is essential in @xmath115 but inessential in @xmath29 . by cutting @xmath29 along @xmath42",
    "we get a surface @xmath145 and a sphere @xmath146 .",
    "note that @xmath29 and @xmath145 are isotopic in @xmath44 ( this could fail if @xmath147 , but if it fails then there would be an incompressible sphere in @xmath44 , and then @xmath4 would be a trivial knot and @xmath29 a sphere ) . for @xmath145 we can similarly define the surfaces @xmath148 , @xmath149 and @xmath150 . note that @xmath151 , @xmath152 , so either @xmath153 or @xmath154 , for @xmath146 intersects at least one of @xmath50 , @xmath52 .",
    "also @xmath155 , so @xmath156 , but this contradicts the choice of @xmath29 .",
    "this implies that @xmath142 is a collection of trivial disks , meridian disks and essential annuli in @xmath50 .",
    "if a component of @xmath142 is a trivial disk @xmath146 , then @xmath157 bounds a disk on @xmath124 which contains @xmath158 , for otherwise @xmath159 could be reduced .",
    "if a component of @xmath142 is an essential annulus @xmath160 , then @xmath160 is parallel to an annulus @xmath161 , and @xmath162 must contain @xmath158 , for otherwise @xmath159 could be reduced .",
    "this also implies that the slope of @xmath163 can not consist of one longitude and several meridians of the solid torus @xmath50 , for in this case @xmath160 would also be parallel to @xmath164 , and then @xmath165 could be reduced .",
    "it also implies that @xmath142 can not contain both essential annuli and meridian disks .",
    "a similar thing can be said for @xmath143 .",
    "suppose @xmath115 does have a maximum .",
    "it will be shown that @xmath115 has a component which is either a disk , an annulus , a once punctured annulus , or a once punctured torus which is parallel to a subsurface in @xmath125 .",
    "choose the maximum at lowest level , say at level @xmath166 , so that there are no other maxima between @xmath166 and 1 .",
    "so @xmath167 consists of a point and a collection of simple closed curves . just below the level @xmath166 , the surface @xmath115 intersects the level tori in simple closed curves , so below the maximum",
    ", a disk @xmath168 is being formed ; if @xmath166 is the last singular point then the disk @xmath169 will be parallel to a disk on @xmath125 .",
    "look at the next singular level @xmath170 , @xmath171 .",
    "if this is a local minimum , or a saddle whose level curves are disjoint from the boundary curve of @xmath169 , then we can interchange the singularities . if it is a saddle point involving the curve @xmath172 and another curve",
    ", then both singular points cancel each other .",
    "if it is a saddle formed by an autointersection of the curve @xmath172 , then the disk @xmath169 below the maximum transforms into an annulus @xmath173 , which must be parallel to an annulus in some @xmath62 , for otherwise the annulus @xmath173 would be compressible in @xmath174 $ ] , and then either @xmath115 would be compressible or could be isotoped to reduce the number of singular points .",
    "for any @xmath135 just below @xmath175 , @xmath176 consists of two parallel curves @xmath177 and @xmath178 .",
    "if @xmath177 is a trivial curve on @xmath179 which bounds a disk disjoint from @xmath4 , then by cutting @xmath115 with such disk , we get a surface @xmath145 isotopic to @xmath29 , but with @xmath180 , for @xmath145 has less singular points than @xmath29 . if @xmath177 bounds a disk which intersects @xmath4 once , then @xmath29 would be meridionally compressible .",
    "so there remain two possibilities , either @xmath177 and @xmath178 are essential curves on @xmath179 or @xmath177 bounds a disk which intersects @xmath4 twice .",
    "look at the next singular level @xmath181 .",
    "if it is a local minimum or a saddle whose level curves are disjoint from the annulus @xmath173 , then again we can interchange the singularities ( note that these curves can not be inside the solid torus bounded by @xmath173 and an annulus in @xmath182 , for there would be a maximum in there ) . if it is a saddle joining the annulus @xmath173 with another curve , then by pushing @xmath173 down the singular point @xmath181 is eliminated .",
    "so this singular point has to be of the annulus with itself , and then a new surface @xmath183 is formed .",
    "the surface @xmath183 has to be a once punctured torus or a once punctured annulus , which is parallel to some @xmath184 , for otherwise @xmath115 would be compressible or could be isotoped to reduce the number of singular points .",
    "if there is one more singular point of @xmath183 with itself , then the surface @xmath185 which will be formed would be compressible , for a component of its boundary would bound a disk in some @xmath186 disjoint from @xmath4 .",
    "we conclude that either @xmath115 is compressible , the number of singular points is not minimal , or a component of @xmath115 , say @xmath187 , it is parallel to a surface in @xmath125 . in the latter case",
    "the surface @xmath187 is disjoint from @xmath188 , and then it can be pushed to @xmath52 , reducing @xmath141 .    at a nonsingular level @xmath135 , @xmath189 consists of simple closed curves . if such a curve @xmath65 is trivial in @xmath134 , then it bounds a disk in that torus .",
    "if such a disk is disjoint from @xmath4 , then by the incompressibility of @xmath115 , @xmath65 bounds a disk in @xmath115 , which give rise to a single maximum or minimum , contradicting claim 2 .",
    "such a disk can not intersect @xmath4 once , for @xmath29 is meridionally incompressible , so @xmath65 bounds a disk which intersects @xmath4 twice .        at a saddle ,",
    "either one level curve of @xmath115 splits into two level curves , or two level curves are joined into one level curve .",
    "if a level curve is trivial in the corresponding level torus and at a saddle the curve joins with itself , then the result must be two essential simple closed curves , for if the curves obtained are trivial , then @xmath115 would be compressible or meridionally compressible .",
    "if in a level there are nontrivial curves of intersection , then there is an even number of them , for @xmath29 is separating .",
    "so if a curve is nontrivial and at the saddle joins with itself , then the result is a curve with the same slope as the original and a trivial curve , for the saddle must join points on the same side of the curve . if two trivial level curves are joined into one , then because the curves must be concentric , the surface @xmath29 would be compressible .",
    "so only the following types of saddle points are possible :    1 .   a saddle changing a trivial simple closed curve into two essential simple closed curves .",
    "2 .   a saddle changing two parallel essential curves into a trivial curve .",
    "3 .   a saddle changing an essential curve @xmath65 into a curve with the same slope as @xmath65 , and a trivial curve .",
    "4 .   a saddle changing an essential curve @xmath65 and a trivial curve into an essential curve with the same slope as @xmath65 .",
    "we want to show that only saddles of types 1 and 2 are possible .",
    "look at two consecutive saddle points .",
    "we note that in many cases @xmath115 can be isotoped so that two consecutive singular points can be put in the same level , and in that case a compression disk for @xmath115 can be found .",
    "namely ,    1 .",
    "a type 3 is followed by a type 1 , see figure 3(a ) .",
    "2 .   a type 3 followed by a type 2 , see figure 3(b ) .",
    "a type 1 is followed by a type 4 , see figure 3(c ) .",
    "a type 2 followed by a type 4 , see figure 3(d ) .",
    "a type 3 followed by a type 4 , see figure 3(e ) and 3(f ) .",
    "the dots in figure 3 indicate the points of intersection between @xmath4 and some @xmath134 , and the dotted line indicates the path followed by the second saddle point .",
    "note that in all the other cases it may not be possible to put the two saddles points in the same level .",
    "suppose there are singularities of type 3 , and take the lowest one , say at level @xmath190 .",
    "if there is a singularity at level @xmath191 , then it is of type 1 , 2 , or 4 , which contradicts the previous observation .",
    "so @xmath190 is in fact the last singularity .",
    "then @xmath143 consists of at least a disk , and at least one annulus or a meridian disk .",
    "isotope @xmath29 so that the saddle at @xmath190 is pushed into @xmath52 , this can be done without moving @xmath188 .",
    "if @xmath143 contained a meridian disk and a trivial disk , which joined in @xmath190 , then now there is just one meridian disk , reducing @xmath141 by 2 .",
    "if @xmath143 contained an annulus and a disk , which joined in the singularity , then now there is just one annulus , reducing @xmath141 by 2 .",
    "if there is a saddle of type 4 , then take the highest one .",
    "if it is not a level @xmath192 , then it is preceded by a singularity of type 1 , 2 , or 3 , which is a contradiction .",
    "so it is a level @xmath192 .",
    "push the singularity to @xmath50 . doing an argument as in the previous case",
    "we get a contradiction .",
    "suppose @xmath142 contains meridian disks , and possibly some trivial disks .",
    "if @xmath115 has no singular points , then it would be a collection of annuli , and @xmath29 would be a sphere ; suppose then that there are some singularities on @xmath115 .",
    "the first saddle is of type 1 or 2 , as in claim 3 .",
    "if it is of type 1 , then a trivial disk joins to itself .",
    "this singularity can be pushed to @xmath142 , so now there is an annulus in @xmath142 of meridional slope , but this shows that @xmath29 is compressible . if the first singularity is of type 2 , then two of the meridian disks are joined by a saddle .",
    "push this singularity to @xmath50 , possibly moving the arc @xmath158 .",
    "then the two disks are transformed into a trivial disk .",
    "the arc @xmath158 is in the ball bounded by such trivial disk and a disk in @xmath124 , so @xmath158 can be rearranged to be level .",
    "this reduces @xmath159 by one .",
    "if @xmath143 contains meridian disks a similar argument can be done .",
    "suppose @xmath142 contains a trivial disk .",
    "look at the first singularity of @xmath115 . if it is of type 2 , then there is an annulus in @xmath142 , and its boundary components are joined in the saddle .",
    "so just after the saddle there is a disk @xmath146 contained in a level torus whose boundary is a nontrivial curve on @xmath115 ; this disk intersects @xmath4 , but because @xmath142 contains a trivial disk , @xmath146 can be pushed above this trivial disk to avoid intersections with @xmath29 or @xmath4 , so it would be a compression disk for @xmath29 .",
    "see figure 4(a ) .",
    "so the first singularity has to be of type 1 , and a trivial disk touches with itself .",
    "push the singularity to @xmath50 , so instead of the disk we have now an annulus , this leaves @xmath165 unchanged , but reduces @xmath193 by one .",
    "note that if the first singularity is of type 2 , and @xmath142 does not contain any disk , then the path followed by the singularity may be quite complicated , as shown in figure 4(b ) , and then a disk as the one found in figure 4(a ) is not a compression disk for @xmath29 , for it intersects @xmath4 .",
    "suppose @xmath142 consists of @xmath194 annuli , @xmath195 .",
    "these annuli are nested , with the innermost one , say @xmath148 , cobounding with an annulus in @xmath124 a solid torus with interior disjoint from @xmath29 and containing an arc of @xmath4 . as @xmath142",
    "consists only of annuli , the first saddle is of type 2 , and it has to join the two boundary curves of the innermost annuli @xmath148",
    ". the next singularity must be also of type 2 , joining now the curves of the second innermost annuli , for if the next singularity is of type 1 , then it is not difficult to see that there is a compression disk for @xmath115 .",
    "so the first @xmath194 singularities are of type 2 . at a level just after the first @xmath194 singularities , the intersection of @xmath115 with that level torus consists of @xmath194 nested trivial curves , the innermost one bounding a disk which intersects @xmath4 in two points .",
    "the next singularity must be of type 1 , and joins the outermost of such curves with itself .",
    "the next @xmath196 singularities are also of type 1 , for otherwise there would be a compression disk for @xmath115 . at a level just after these singularities , the intersection of @xmath29 with that level consists of @xmath197 essential curves .",
    "two of these curves bound an annulus in the level torus which intersects @xmath4 in two points ; note that these curves are in the same component of @xmath115 as the boundary curves of @xmath148 .",
    "this shows that if @xmath142 consists of @xmath194 annuli , then the first @xmath194 singularities are of type 2 , which are followed by @xmath194 singularities of type 1 , and then are followed by @xmath194 singularities of type 2 , and so on .",
    "this implies in particular that @xmath198 consists of @xmath194 connected components .",
    "note that the component which contains the annulus @xmath148 remains always being innermost , that is , at each level torus , its curves of intersection with that torus bound an annulus or a disk which intersects @xmath4 in two points .",
    "then in @xmath125 , this component bound an annulus which contains an arc of @xmath4 .",
    "this implies that in @xmath52 there is an annulus component of @xmath143 , say @xmath149 , having these curves as its boundary components , that is , @xmath149 is an innermost annulus in @xmath52 , so @xmath199 is a connected component of @xmath29 , which contradicts the fact that @xmath29 were connected .",
    "so we conclude that @xmath142 is just one annulus , similarly @xmath143 .      as @xmath142 and @xmath143",
    "are annuli , and @xmath115 has no singular points , it follows that @xmath29 is a torus .",
    "then @xmath142 and @xmath143 determine the same slope in @xmath124 and @xmath125 respectively , so @xmath201 , where @xmath84 is a curve in @xmath124 lying in the annulus parallel to @xmath142 .",
    "it follows from the definitions that @xmath4 is level with respect to @xmath84 .",
    "@xmath115 has an even number of saddle points .",
    "the sequence of saddle points can be written as @xmath203 , where @xmath204 is a saddle of type 2 , and @xmath205 is a saddle of type 1 .",
    "so in a level @xmath206 , @xmath207 consists of a trivial curve on @xmath208 , and in levels @xmath209 , @xmath210 and @xmath211 , @xmath212 consists of two essential curves on @xmath213 , say of slope @xmath214 .",
    "choose nonsingular levels @xmath216 , so that @xmath217 , @xmath218 , and @xmath219 .",
    "so @xmath220 consists of two simple closed essential curves of slope @xmath214 .",
    "these curves bound an annulus in @xmath221 which intersects @xmath4 in two points .",
    "let @xmath15 be an essential curve in the interior of this annulus .",
    "let @xmath17 be an straight arc in @xmath226 $ ] , joining @xmath15 and @xmath78 , and which is disjoint from @xmath115 .",
    "let @xmath18 be the 1-complex consisting of the union of all the curves @xmath15 and the arcs @xmath81 .",
    "so @xmath18 is a trivalent graph embedded in @xmath0 .",
    "do a level preserving ambient isotopy in @xmath33 , keeping @xmath18 fixed and disjoint form @xmath115 , so that at a level @xmath227 , the disk @xmath109 is isotoped to a tiny neighborhood of the point @xmath228 , and at a level @xmath229 , the two curves in @xmath230 bound an annulus which is a tiny neighborhood of the curve @xmath15 . between the levels @xmath227 and @xmath231 , the surface @xmath115 and the disks @xmath109 and @xmath232 bound a solid torus @xmath233 , which is foliated by disks , annuli and two singular disks ; it is foliated by disks between the levels @xmath227 and @xmath205 , and between @xmath234 and @xmath231 , it is foliated by annuli between the levels @xmath205 and @xmath234 , and there are singular disks at the levels @xmath205 and @xmath234 . at the top of @xmath233",
    "is the disk @xmath109 , at the bottom the disk @xmath232 , and at a middle level the annulus @xmath22 .",
    "it follows that @xmath29 is in fact the boundary of a regular neighborhood of @xmath18 .",
    "the slopes of the curves @xmath235 must satisfy @xmath236 , for otherwise the surface @xmath29 would be compressible . then @xmath18 is a toroidal graph of type @xmath237 .    when doing the isotopy the knot @xmath4 is also modified , but because the isotopy is level preserving , the arcs @xmath238 are still straight arcs . note that @xmath239 consists of two straight arcs with endpoints in @xmath109 and @xmath232 , so each of these arcs intersects each surface in the foliation of @xmath233 exactly once .",
    "so @xmath239 is like a 2-braid in @xmath233 .",
    "@xmath240 is a straight arc with one endpoint in @xmath109 and the other in @xmath15 , and @xmath241 is a straight arc with one endpoint in @xmath232 and the other in @xmath15 .",
    "now @xmath239 can be isotoped , keeping its endpoints in @xmath109 and @xmath232 , so that @xmath242 and @xmath243 both consist of two straight arcs , and @xmath25 consists of two arcs .    above the level @xmath244 , the annulus @xmath142 , the surface @xmath115 and the disk @xmath245 bound a solid torus @xmath246 .",
    "@xmath247 consists of two straight arcs going from @xmath245 to @xmath248 , and an arc lying in @xmath249 .",
