    "the @xmath0-dimensional _ rigid transformation ( or euclidean ) _ group @xmath1 consists of transformations of @xmath2 which preserves the standard metric .",
    "this group serves as an essential mathematical backend for many applications ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it is well - known ( see @xcite , for example ) that any element of @xmath1 can be written as a composition of a rotation , a reflection , and a translation , and hence , it is represented by @xmath3-homogeneous matrix ; @xmath4 here , we adopt the convention that a matrix acts on a ( column ) vector by the multiplication from the left . @xmath1 has two connected components .",
    "the identity component @xmath5 consists of those without reflection .",
    "more precisely , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the _ special orthogonal group _ composed of @xmath0-dimensional rotations .",
    "the group @xmath5 is widely used in computer graphics such as for expressing motion and attitude , displacement ( @xcite ) , deformation ( @xcite ) , skinning ( @xcite ) , and camera control ( @xcite ) . in some cases , the matrix representation of the group @xmath5 is not convenient . in particular",
    ", a linear combination of two matrices in @xmath5 does not necessarily belong to @xmath5 and it causes the notorious _ candy - wrapper _ defect in skinning . when @xmath8 , another representation of @xmath9 using the _ dual quaternion numbers _ ( dqn , for short ) is considered in @xcite to solve the candy - wrapper defect . in this paper",
    ", we consider the @xmath10-dimensional case .",
    "of course , 2d case can be handled by regarding the plane embedded in @xmath11 and using dqn , but instead , we introduce the _ anti - commutative dual complex numbers _ ( dcn , for short ) , which is specific to 2d with much more concise and faster implementation ( @xcite ) . to summarise , our dcn has the following advantages :    * any number of rigid transformations can be blended / interpolated easily using its algebraic structure with no degeneration defects such as the candy - wrapper defect ( see  [ blend ] ) * it is efficient in terms of both memory and cpu usage ( see  [ implementation ] ) .",
    "we believe that our dcn offers a choice for representing the 2d rigid transformation in certain applications which requires the above properties .",
    "let @xmath12 denote one of the fields @xmath13 , or @xmath14 , where @xmath14 is the quaternion numbers .",
    "first , we recall the standard construction of the _ dual numbers _ over @xmath12 .",
    "the ring of dual numbers @xmath15 is the quotient ring defined by @xmath16/(\\varepsilon^2 ) =   \\ { p_0 + p_1 \\varepsilon \\mid p_0,p_1\\in \\mathbb{k } \\}.\\ ] ] we often denote an element in @xmath15 by a symbol with hat such as @xmath17 .",
    "the addition and the multiplication of two dual numbers are given as @xmath18    the following involution is considered to be the dual version of conjugation @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the usual conjugation of @xmath21 in @xmath12 .",
    "( note that in some literatures @xmath22 is denoted by @xmath23 . )",
    "the _ unit dual numbers _ are of special importance .",
    "let @xmath24 for @xmath25 .",
    "the unit dual numbers is defined as @xmath26 @xmath27 acts on @xmath15 by conjugation action @xmath28 where @xmath29 .",
    "the unit dual quaternion @xmath30 is successfully used for skinning in @xcite ; a vector @xmath31 is identified with @xmath32 and the conjugation action of @xmath30 preserves the embedded @xmath11 and its euclidean metric .",
    "in fact , the conjugation action induces the double cover @xmath33 .    on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath34 or @xmath35 , the conjugation action is trivial since the corresponding dual numbers are commutative .",
    "therefore , we define the _ anti - commutative dual complex numbers _ ( dcn , for short ) @xmath36 by modifying the multiplication of @xmath37 .",
    "that is , @xmath38 as a set , and the algebraic operations are replaced by latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned } ( p_0 + p_1 \\varepsilon ) ( q_0 + q_1 \\varepsilon ) & = & ( p_0q_0 ) + ( p_1\\tilde{q}_0 + p_0q_1 ) \\varepsilon , \\\\ \\widetilde{p_0 + p_1 \\varepsilon } & = & \\tilde{p}_0 + p_1\\varepsilon , \\\\    conjugation action are kept unchanged . then ,    @xmath36 satisfies distributive and associative laws , and hence , has a ( non - commutative ) ring structure .    similarly to the unit dual quaternion numbers , the unit anti - commutative complex numbers are of particular importance : @xmath40 it forms a group with inverse @xmath41 we define an action of @xmath42 on @xmath36 by the conjugation .",
    "now , we regard @xmath43 as usual . identifying @xmath44 with @xmath45",
    ", we see that @xmath42 acts on @xmath35 as rigid transformation .",
    "in the previous section , we constructed the unit anti - commutative dual complex numbers @xmath42 and its action on @xmath43 as rigid transformation . recall that @xmath47 acts on @xmath48 by @xmath49 that is , @xmath50 maps to @xmath51 .",
    "for example , when @xmath52 , @xmath48 is mapped to @xmath53 , which is the rotation around the origin of degree @xmath54 since @xmath55 . on the other hand , when @xmath56 , the action corresponds to the translation by @xmath57 . in general",
    ", we have @xmath58 where @xmath59 ( respectively , @xmath60 ) is the real ( respectively , imaginary ) part of @xmath61 .",
    "note that this gives a surjective group homomorphism @xmath62 whose kernel is @xmath63 .",
    "that is , the preimage of any 2d rigid transformation consists of exactly two unit dcn s with opposite signs .",
    "we compute the dcn s @xmath64 which represent @xmath65-rotation around @xmath48 .",
    "it is the composition of the following three rigid transformations : @xmath66-translation , @xmath65-rotation around the origin , and @xmath50-translation .",
    "thus , we have @xmath67",
    "the following ring homomorphism @xmath68 is compatible with the involution and the conjugation , and preserves the norm .",
    "furthermore , if we identify @xmath69 with @xmath70 , the above map commutes with the action . from this point of view , dcn is nothing but a sub - ring of dqn .",
    "note also that @xmath36 can be embedded in the ring of the @xmath71-complex matrices by @xmath72 then @xmath73    we thus have various equivalent presentations of dcn . however , our presentation of @xmath36 as the anti - commutative dual numbers is easier to implement and more efficient .",
    "first , recall that for the positive real numbers @xmath74 , there are two typical interpolation methods : @xmath75 and @xmath76    the first method can be generalized to dqn as the _ dual quaternion linear blending _ in @xcite . similarly",
    ", a dcn version of _ dual number linear blending ( dlb , for short ) _ is given as follows :    for @xmath77 , we define @xmath78 where @xmath79 .",
    "note that the denominator can become @xmath80 and for those set of @xmath81 s and @xmath82 s dlb can not be defined .",
    "a significant feature of dlb is that it is distributive ( it is called _ bi - invariant _ in some literatures ) .",
    "that is , the following holds : @xmath83 this property is particularly important when transformations are given in a certain hierarchy such as in the case of skinning ; if the transformation assigned to the root joint is modified , the skin associated to lower nodes is deformed consistently .",
    "next , we consider the interpolation of the second type . for this , we need the exponential and the logarithm maps for dcn .    for @xmath84 ,",
    "we define @xmath85    when @xmath86 , we can write @xmath87 for some @xmath88 , and @xmath89 for @xmath90 , we define @xmath91 as usual , we have @xmath92 and @xmath93 . note that this gives the following _ lie correspondence _ ( see @xcite ) @xmath94 where @xmath95 .",
    "we have the following commutative diagram : @xmath96^{d\\varphi } \\ar[d]^{\\exp } & { \\mathfrak{se}}(2 ) \\ar[d]^\\exp",
    "\\ar[r]^\\varphi & { \\mathrm{se}}(2 ) , } \\ ] ] where @xmath97 is an isomorphism of @xmath98-vector spaces .",
    "the following is a dcn version of slerp @xcite .",
    "slerp interpolation from @xmath99 to @xmath100 is given by @xmath101 where @xmath102 .",
    "this gives a uniform angular velocity interpolation of two dcn s , while dlb can blend three or more dcn s without the uniform angular velocity property .",
    "we compare the following four methods for 2d rigid transformation : our dcn , the unit dual quaternion numbers ( see  [ dan ] ) , the @xmath103-real ( homogeneous ) matrix representation of @xmath46 , and the @xmath71-complex matrices described below .",
    "we list the computational cost in terms of the number of floating point operations for    * transforming a point * composing two transformations * converting a transformation to the standard @xmath103-real matrix representation ( except for the @xmath103-real matrix case where it shows the computational cost to convert to dcn representation ) .",
    "we also give the memory usage for each presentation in terms of the number of floating point units necessary to store a transformation .",
    ".comparison of computational cost [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     note that when a particular application requires to apply a single transformation to a lot of points , it is faster to first convert the dcn to a @xmath103-real matrix .",
    "we implemented our dcn in a form of c++ library .",
    "though it is written in c++ , it should be easy to translate to any language .",
    "you can download the mit - licensed source code at @xcite .",
    "we also developed a small demo application called the 2d probe - based deformer ( @xcite ) for tablet devices running opengl es ( opengl for embedded systems ) .",
    "thanks to the efficiency of dcn and touch interface , it offers interactive and intuitive operation .",
    "although we did not try , we believe dcn works well with 2d skinning just as dqn does with 3d skinning .",
    "+      here we briefly discuss the algorithm of the application .",
    "one can place an arbitrary number of _ probes _",
    "@xmath104 on a target image .",
    "the target image is represented by a textured square mesh with vertices @xmath105 .",
    "the weight @xmath106 of @xmath107 s effect on @xmath108 is painted by user or automatically calculated from the distance between @xmath108 and @xmath107 .",
    "when the probes are rotated or translated by the user s touch gesture , the dcn @xmath82 is computed which maps the initial state of @xmath107 to its current state .",
    "the vertex @xmath108 is transformed by @xmath109 ( see equations ( [ action ] ) and ( [ eq : dlb ] ) respectively for the definition of the action @xmath110 and dlb . )",
