    "studies of the hot matter formed in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions , such as those produced at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) , require experimental probes , like heavy quarks ( charm and bottom ) , that are produced during the collisions .",
    "the temperature of the matter produced in @xmath10@xmath0@xmath10 collisions  @xcite is much less than the heavy quark masses ( @xmath11@xmath51.3  gev , m@xmath12 @xmath5 4.2gev ) .",

    "indeed , a large suppression of high transverse momentum ( @xmath7 ) electrons from semi - leptonic heavy flavor decays was discovered in au@xmath0au collisions at @xmath13 200gev relative to @xmath2@xmath0@xmath2 collisions  @xcite in contrast to the predicted reduced suppression for heavy quarks related to light quarks due to the  dead - cone ",
    "effect  @xcite .",
    "it is most pronounced in central collisions , i.e. collisions with small impact parameters , and disappears in more peripheral events .",
    "the suppression of heavy flavor at high @xmath7 was widely interpreted as evidence that heavy flavor quarks lose a significant amount of energy as they traverse hot matter  @xcite .",
    "many effects have been taken into account in various theoretical calculations  @xcite and the data presented here will provide significant additional constraints .",
    "there are many processes that occur in nuclear collisions which can alter the kinematic distributions of observed particles .",
    "modifications of the parton distributions in bound nucleons will affect the production rates of particles  @xcite .",
    "initial - state parton scattering and energy loss in the nucleus will also affect the observed particle spectra  @xcite .    until recently",
    ", the study of @xmath2@xmath0@xmath10 and @xmath14@xmath0@xmath10 collisions was considered the best way to investigate and quantify these nuclear effects , known generally as cold - nuclear - matter effects .",
    "this assumption is now challenged by recent results obtained in @xmath2@xmath0pb and @xmath14@xmath0au collisions pointing to additional phenomena that may be of hydrodynamic origin  @xcite .",
    "therefore , careful comparison of results from @xmath2@xmath0@xmath2 , @xmath2@xmath0@xmath10 , @xmath14@xmath0@xmath10 , and @xmath10@xmath0@xmath10 , collisions is likely needed to isolate an unambiguous signature of hot nuclear matter .",
    "evidence for such nuclear effects was shown by phenix in data from @xmath14+au collisions at @xmath13 200gev , where an enhancement of electrons from heavy flavor decays was observed relative to @xmath2@xmath0@xmath2 collisions  @xcite between @xmath15gev .",
    "the enhancement depends on centrality ; as the collisions become more central the enhancement becomes more and more pronounced , in contrast to the increasing suppression observed in au@xmath0au collisions at the same @xmath16 .",
    "given these results , it is interesting to measure how this enhancement changes over to suppression as the system becomes larger .",
    "the system size can be varied by changing the colliding nuclei .    at rhic ,",

    "charged tracks are reconstructed radially outside of an axial magnetic field using layers of drift chambers and pad chambers .",
    "electrons are identified by hits in the ring imaging erenkov counter ( rich ) and by requiring a match between an energy deposit in the electromagnetic calorimeter ( emcal ) and the track s momentum . the rich uses co@xmath24 gas at atmospheric pressure as the erenkov radiator . electrons and pions begin to radiate in the rich at @xmath25mev / c and @xmath26gev/@xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the emcal comprises four sectors in each arm .",

    "a bag filled with he gas at atmospheric pressure is placed between the beam pipe and drift chamber ( dc ) entrance window to minimize photon conversions .",
    "detailed descriptions of the phenix detector subsystems can be found in  @xcite .        for this analysis two",
    "different event samples were used .",
    "the first sample was obtained with a minimum - bias ( mb ) trigger , which registers all cu@xmath0cu collisions with a coincidence of at least one particle detected in each of the two beam - beam counters ( bbc ) .",
    "the bbcs are located at @xmath201.44 m ( @xmath33 ) and comprise 64 erenkov counter modules .",
    "only events with a vertex position within@xmath2020 cm of the nominal z=0 collision point are kept , giving a sample of 5.08 x 10@xmath34 events .",
    "a second sample was collected with an additional trigger condition requiring the detection of an electron candidate in the event .",
    "this electron trigger ( ert ) requires a coincidence between the emcal and rich detectors and provides an additional 3.3 x 10@xmath35 events . for the ert trigger",
    ", a threshold on the emcal energy was set at approximately 1.2gev . in our analysis",
    "we only use electron candidates from this sample above @xmath6gev/@xmath3 , well beyond the point where the trigger reaches its maximium efficiency .",
    "the ert trigger efficiency for electrons over all emcal sectors was determined to be 67%@xmath203% .",
    "the largest source of inefficiency comes from dead trigger tiles .",
    "centrality is determined by monte carlo calculation of the glauber model  @xcite using the measured charge deposited in the bbc .",
    "the mb collisions correspond to 0%94% of the inelastic cross section .",
    "it is divided into centrality classes covering 0%10% , 0%20% , 20%40% , 40%60% , and 60%94% of the centrality range ( see table  [ tab : ncoll ] ) .",
    "the analysis method used here , with some differences , is described in detail in  @xcite .",
    "electron candidates start with charged tracks reconstructed by the drift chambers and pad chambers .",
    "these tracks are then identified as electrons by passing a set of electron identification cuts .",
    "first the track is projected to the rich and at least 5 pmts containing one registered signal are required in a disc ( r=11 cm ) , with an angular size of 0.044rad , centered at the projection point .",
    "this analysis uses a disc to reduce sensitivity to any possible mirror misalignment .",
    "the use of a tight rich cut ensures a negligible contamination of hadrons with above the rich radiator threshold through the range ( @xmath367gev/@xmath3 ) of this analysis .",
    "the track is then projected to the emcal and a three sigma cut is made on the difference between the projection and the center of the energy deposition .    a cut is also made on the shape of the emcal shower , called prob , calculated from the deviation between the actual tower energy distribution and the expected distribution for an electromagnetic shower and normalized to be between 0 and 1 .",
    "we require prob@xmath370.01 which has a 99% efficiency for an electromagnetic shower while rejecting a large fraction of hadrons .",
    "finally a cut is made on the ratio of the energy deposited in the emcal to the momentum determined by the dc , represented by e / p .",
    "an electron deposits most of its energy in the emcal and because its mass is so small , e@xmath38p and e / p for an electron will be close to 1 .",
    "the e / p cut is made symmetrically around 1 ( between 0.8 and 1.2 ) .",
    "though the electron i d cuts give a good sample of electrons , in a high multiplicity environment overlap in the detectors can cause hadrons to be misidentified as electrons .",
    "the number and properties of those fake tracks reconstructed by random association can be obtained by exchanging , in software , the north and south halves of the rich .",
    "for example , dc tracks from the south are matched with the rich north and vice versa .",
    "after the swap , there can not be any actual tracks , and all reconstructed ones are , by definition , fake tracks .",
    "the active area of the north and south rich detectors are identical within @xmath381% . in peripheral collisions ,",
    "3% of all tracks are mismatches , and in the central collisions that fraction rises to 22% .",
    "a geant simulation of the full phenix detector was used to determine the extrapolation to full azimuthal acceptance and correction for electron detection efficiency .",
    "the same eid and fiducial cuts are made on the simulation output and the data .",
    "the simulated electrons were generated flat in to give sufficient statistics at high momentum , and then weighted with a realistic distribution to account for momentum smearing effects due to the finite momentum resolution of the drift chamber .",
    "the inclusive single electron spectrum has contributions from a multitude of sources of which heavy flavor decays is only one .",
    "most of the electrons come from decays of light mesons ( dominated by the neutral pion dalitz decay , @xmath39 )  @xcite .",
    "electrons from conversions of decay photons are also significant .",
    "however , the low material design of the phenix detector minimizes this contribution to less than half of that from dalitz decays .",
    "direct photons can also be a significant contribution to the inclusive electron spectrum , either through conversions of real photons in material or manifestations of virtual photons as an @xmath40 pair .",
    "this group of electrons is collectively known as `` photonic '' electrons , due to their origins with either a real or virtual direct or decay photon .    the other class of electrons , known as `` nonphotonic '' ,",
    "is dominated by the decays of open heavy flavor hadrons .",
    "the dielectron decays of the @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 mesons contribute to the inclusive electron sample at the few percent level .",
    "decays of quarkonia , dominated by @xmath44  @xcite , are a significant source of nonphotonic electrons at moderate .",
    "misreconstructed electron tracks from kaon @xmath45 decays away from the collision vertex are @xmath510% of the inclusive electrons at @xmath46gev/@xmath3 , but are negligible at higher .",
    "electron pairs produced via the drell - yan process contribute a negligibly small background to the heavy flavor signal . to isolate the contribution of open heavy flavor decays to the inclusive electron spectrum",
    ", these backgrounds must be determined and removed from the inclusive electron sample .",
    "the methods for isolating the open heavy flavor electron yield used in this measurement are described in detail in  @xcite , and are summarized here for completeness .",
    "the first method calculates a cocktail of electrons from the nonheavy flavor sources . because the phenix experiment is a multipurpose detector , most of the dominant sources of single electrons have previously been measured in the same experiment .",
    "the largest background source comes from the neutral pion , both the dalitz decay and the conversion of photons from the @xmath47@xmath48@xmath49 decay . using a parametrization of the measured @xmath47 spectra  @xcite in a monte carlo decay generator ,",
    "the spectrum of daughter electrons is determined .",
    "the spectra of the other light mesons that contribute to the cocktail ( @xmath50 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath50 , and @xmath43 ) are derived from the @xmath47 spectrum by @xmath51 scaling ( replacing in the parametrization with @xmath52 ) and then normalizing to the measured meson to pion ratios at high . at intermediate the contribution from j/@xmath53",
    "decays becomes significant and the measured spectra  @xcite are fit and used as the parent spectra in the decay generator .",
    "the cocktail of nonheavy flavor electrons is subtracted from the inclusive electron sample to isolate the contribution from open heavy flavor electrons .",
    "this method works well at larger where the heavy flavor contribution is significant , but suffers from large systematic uncertainties at low electron , where the ratio of open heavy flavor electrons to all electrons is low .",
    "the second method of isolating the open heavy flavor yield uses a `` converter '' to deliberately increase the photonic background by a well defined amount . in the standard phenix configuration",
    ", the number of inclusive electrons in a given range @xmath54 can be expressed as    @xmath55    where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the number of photonic and nonphotonic electrons in that bin , respectively .",
    "the converter is a sheet of brass , 0.25 mm thick , which has a radiation length determined to a precision of @xmath200.25% . for a portion of 2005 running ,",
    "the converter was wrapped around the beam pipe .",
    "this extra material increases the real photonic electron background by an amount @xmath58 , and reduces the nonphotonic electrons by a factor @xmath59 , giving an inclusive electron yield in the converter configuration @xmath60 of    @xmath61    where the factors @xmath58 and @xmath62 are determined through simulation .",
    "@xmath58 has a slight dependence that is prevalent in the low region and plateaus at a value of 2.4 , and @xmath63@xmath200.005 .",
    "the uncertainties on these quantities are found by varying the radiation length of the converter material in simulation by the uncertainty in the measured converter thickness .    a simultaneous solution of eqs .  [ eqn : conv_out ] and  [ eqn : conv_in ]",
    "gives the quantity of interest @xmath57 .",
    "the remaining nonphotonic background electrons are subtracted following the cocktail method previously described to isolate the open heavy flavor electron contribution .",
    "because the converter produces an undesirable background for other measurements at phenix , it is only installed for a relatively short amount of time .",
    "therefore the converter method of background determination is limited by the statistics of the data sample taken with the converter installed . however",
    ", at low where statistical uncertainties are relatively small , the converter method provides meaningful results .",
    "because this region is where the cocktail method is limited by systematic uncertainties , and high is where the converter method is limited by statistics , the open heavy flavor electron results are determined by the converter method at @xmath64gev/@xmath3 , and by the cocktail method elsewhere .    as a stringent cross - check of the methods described here , the ratio of nonphotonic electrons to photonic electrons , @xmath65 are compared for the two methods ( shown in fig .

    "the systematic uncertainties on the resulting heavy flavor electron yield come from the determination of the inclusive electron yield and the uncertainty on the cocktail ( converter ) method .",
    "the uncertainties are explained in detail in  @xcite and are summarized here .    the systematic uncertainty on the inclusive yield is a combination of three parts : the uncertainty on the run group correction , electron identification , and geometric matching . for the ert data set",
    "there is an additional uncertainty that comes from determining the trigger efficiency .",
    "the run group correction uncertainty comes from the fluctuation of the average number of electrons per event ( @xmath67 ) for each run ( where a run is defined as the data taken between successive starts of the phenix data acquisition system ) .",
    "the uncertainty on @xmath67 was found to be 1% and is assigned as the run - group - correction fluctuation .",
    "the uncertainty on identifying electrons comes from the inability to perfectly model the detector in simulation .",
    "it is estimated by repeating the acceptance@xmath68efficiency calculation for tighter and looser cuts which are then applied to inclusive yields made with the same cuts .",
    "the ratio between the standard and tight or loose cuts is found to be 6% and is taken as the systematic uncertainty .",
    "mismatching in the detector acceptance between simulation and data is an additional uncertainty and was found to be 4% .",
    "the ert data set is only used in the high region where the trigger efficiency is at the plateau value and so the only uncertainty is due to the determination of the trigger plateau , 2% . the total systematic uncertainty on the inclusive mb ( ert ) yield is the quadrature sum of the previously discussed uncertainties and is found to be 7.3 ( 7.5)% .    the dominant systematic uncertainty on the cocktail comes from the uncertainty on the 2005 cu@xmath0cu neutral pion data  @xcite that is used as the input parent spectra for all of the light mesons .",
    "the pion data are moved up and down by their systematic uncertainties and refit .",
    "these new fits are then input into the decay generator and the output decay spectra become the upper and lower spread of the systematic uncertainties .",
    "the systematic uncertainty on the j/@xmath53 spectra is done in the same manner as the pions .",
    "the rest of the light mesons are moved up and down by the uncertainty on the meson/@xmath47 ratios at high .",

    "the systematic uncertainty on the cocktail is dependent on and centrality but has an average value of @xmath512% for mb collisions .",

    "the average value of the nuclear modification factor for @xmath95gev/@xmath3 and @xmath96gev/@xmath3 for the three collision species is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : raa_vs_ncoll ] and [ fig : raa_vs_npart ] , as a function of @xmath81 and @xmath94 , respectively . with the exception of the most peripheral au@xmath0au bin in the higher range",
    ", a trend of increasing enhancement followed by suppression is seen among the three distinct systems , with cu@xmath0cu showing evidence of both .",
    "this common trend suggests that the enhancement and suppression effects are dependent on the size of the colliding system and the produced medium .",
    "the heavy quark data from cu@xmath0cu collisions display enhancement and suppression features similar to those found in both @xmath8au and au@xmath0au collisions , respectively . the enhancement seen for heavy flavor electrons in central @xmath8au is larger than what is observed for pions and kaons at the same collision energy  @xcite . in central @xmath14+au collisions ,",
    "a mass - dependent enhancement is observed for identified pions , kaons , and protons  @xcite .",
    "the proton spectra show the largest enhancement and reach an @xmath93 of @xmath51.5 at @xmath973gev/@xmath3 in mb @xmath14+au collisions .",
    "this hardening of hadron spectra in nuclear collisions compared to @xmath2@xmath0@xmath2 collisions is known as the `` cronin effect ''  @xcite and is used generically for @xmath371 observations .",
    "early explanations of the mechanism behind the cronin effect relied on @xmath98 boosts to partons via scattering in the nucleus before the hard scattering and subsequent fragmentation  @xcite ; however , this hypothesis does not explain the observed mass dependence , because the @xmath98 transverse momentum kicks in the nucleus presumably occur before hadronization and therefore could not preferentially boost protons more than pions .",
    "an alternative scenario involving recombination of soft partons in the hadronization process naturally gives a difference between meson and baryon enhancement  @xcite , but it is not immediately clear what effect this has on heavy flavor electrons , which are from a mixture of charm and bottom meson and baryon decays ( though most are from mesons ) . the baryon enhancement observed in @xmath14+au and @xmath10@xmath0@xmath10 collisions at rhic can also suppress @xmath79 production at moderate , because charmed baryons have a smaller branching ratio to electrons than charmed mesons  @xcite ; however , currently no measurements of charmed baryons at rhic energies exist to confirm any changes in the charmed hadron chemistry .",
    "charm and bottom production at midrapidity is dominated by gluon fusion and samples nuclear @xmath99-values of @xmath510@xmath88 , where modification of the gluon pdf may be significant in central collisions . because the observed enhancement occurs in peripheral cu@xmath0cu collisions with a large average impact parameter , where the spatially - dependent nuclear pdf is expected to have minimal changes from the free - nucleon pdf  @xcite",
    ", this may suggest that gluon modification is not the dominant effect at midrapidity .",
    "parton energy loss in the nucleus may also affect heavy flavor production in nuclear collisions  @xcite .",
    "these effects are also expected to occur in the initial stages of central nuclear collisions , prior to the formation of the hot nuclear medium .",
    "the observed enhancement is theoretically unexplained .",
    "several mechanisms have been put forth to explain the large @xmath79 suppression in au@xmath0au collisions ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rcuraa ] ) when it was found that radiative energy loss alone was not sufficient to reproduce the suppression  @xcite .",
    "recent models involving collisional energy loss and energy loss through in - medium dissociation of heavy flavor mesons in addition to gluon radiation have proven more successful at describing the au@xmath0au data  @xcite .",
    "fragmentation and dissociation have recently been used to describe the suppression of the quarkonia yield in au@xmath0au collisions and could also be applied to the heavy - light bound states of the d and b meson  @xcite .",
    "these effects are sensitive to the formation times of the mesons and the hot nuclear medium .",
    "it was originally thought that heavy quarks would exhibit less suppression than light quarks in a deconfined medium , due to a suppression of small - angle gluon radiation known as the `` dead cone '' effect  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath79 and @xmath47 @xmath82 for central cu@xmath0cu collisions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : raa_pi0 ] . the heavy flavor electrons seem to approach the level of suppression of the neutral pions , though the electron range is limited .",
    "while this may suggest a difference in energy loss for light and heavy quarks , the peripheral @xmath47 data show none of the enhancement that is present for heavy flavor . because the nuclear effects are expected to be present in the initial state of central collisions , the different level of suppression for @xmath79 and @xmath47",
    "may indicate that the initial state effects on light and heavy quarks are different .",
    "a similar difference is also observed in @xmath8au collisions , where the @xmath79 show significant enhancement while the @xmath47 does not .",
    "previous phenix measurements at forward rapidity ( @xmath100 ) showed a significant suppression of heavy flavor muons ( @xmath101 ) in central cu@xmath0cu collisions  @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of this suppression at forward rapidity in cu@xmath0cu ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cucu_raa_vitev ] ) is comparable to the suppression of @xmath79 in central au@xmath0au collisions at midrapidity .",
    "this observation is difficult to reconcile with explanations of heavy flavor suppression that depend solely on energy loss in the hot nuclear medium , because the energy density of the matter created in central au@xmath0au collisions is expected to be larger than in cu@xmath0cu collisions  @xcite .",
    "because open heavy flavor is significantly more suppressed at forward rapidity than at midrapidity in cu@xmath0cu , additional nuclear effects , such as gluon shadowing at low @xmath99 or partonic energy loss in the nucleus , may be significant .",
    "suppression through shadowing effects may also be relevant to heavy flavor production at midrapidity at the large hadron collider  @xcite , because the @xmath16 is higher than at rhic and probes a lower @xmath99-range within the nucleus at midrapidity .",
    "the heavy flavor electrons and muons are compared in fig .",
    "[ fig : cucu_raa_vitev ] to a theoretical prediction that combines the effects of partonic energy loss , energy loss from fragmentation and dissociation , and includes nuclear matter effects such as shadowing and cronin enhancement due to parton scattering in the nucleus  @xcite . while consistent within uncertainties , the model predicts more suppression for heavy flavor electrons than seen in the data .",
    "the b mesons are heavier and so dissociation is the dominant contribution to the energy loss for the entire range at rhic in this model . on the other hand , with its lighter mass ,",
    "the d meson transitions at @xmath55gev to the traditional partonic energy loss .",
    "however , it is critical to test models against the full range of system sizes to have confidence in the underlying model physics and so calculations are needed for @xmath14+au and peripheral cu@xmath0cu .",
    "the cu@xmath0cu data presented here build a bridge between the enhancement observed in @xmath8au collisions and the suppression found in au@xmath0au .",
    "we find that for electrons between 1 and 3gev/@xmath3 the variation in @xmath82 is common as a function of or in @xmath14+au , cu@xmath0cu , and au@xmath0au . for electrons between 35gev/@xmath3",
    "this relation also holds with the exception of the most peripheral au@xmath0au .",
    "peripheral collisions of cu nuclei display an enhancement of open heavy flavor at moderate that is consistent with the enhancement observed in @xmath14+au collisions at similar values of @xmath81 and @xmath94 , which suggests significant effects on heavy quark production are present in the initial state of heavy ion collisions .",
    "in central cu@xmath0cu collisions , open heavy flavor at midrapidity is moderately suppressed when compared to a superposition of independent @xmath2@xmath0@xmath2 collisions , and significantly suppressed compared to peripheral cu@xmath0cu collisions .",
    "the nuclear modification factor @xmath82 displays a suppression that is consistent with that seen in semi - peripheral au@xmath0au collisions with a similar system size , suggesting that the suppressing effects from hot nuclear matter are becoming dominant .",
    "while partonic energy loss in medium alone does not describe either the cu@xmath0cu or au@xmath0au @xmath79 data , a model which incorporates initial state gluon shadowing , parton scattering and energy loss in nuclear matter , followed by dissociative energy loss in the hot medium , gives a reasonable description of central cu@xmath0cu open heavy flavor data at both midrapidity and forward rapidity .",
    "models that describe central au@xmath0au should also be tested against the cu@xmath0cu and @xmath14+au data .",
    "a number of different effects must be balanced to describe the data , which demonstrates the complicated interplay of effects from nuclear matter and those from the hot medium in heavy ion collisions .",
