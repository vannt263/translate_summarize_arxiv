    "@xcite investigated electron  only devices based on fullerene derivatives and a variety of their bisadducts blended with poly(3-hexylthiophene ) by current  voltage measurements . the lower currents of the devices with bisadducts were attributed to shallow trapping .",
    "this conclusion was supported by device simulations introducing a distribution of traps , which enabled to fit the current  voltage curves .",
    "although , trap states can have a significant influence on the performance of organic solar cells , as they can act as recombination centers , lower the mobility and disturb the internal field distribution , direct identification of the trap states in methanofullerene films has not been performed so far .    in this paper",

    "[ fig : tstop]b , the activation energy obtained with the t@xmath17 method ( circles ) remains nearly constant for @xmath13 @xmath27 40  k. this constant value of about 86  mev is caused by the fact that at low @xmath13 the temperature of the tsc peak maximum does not change , since the dominant traps are not affected by the prerelease , as already mentioned above .",
    "hence , the activation energies obtained by the t@xmath17 method are overestimated with respect to those from the initial rise method ( squares ) , as the latter are dominated by the shallowest occupied traps . for @xmath13",
    "@xmath14 40  k , the activation energy obtained from the t@xmath17 method rises due to the emptying of the prominent traps and the enhanced contribution of the remaining deeper traps .",
    "the difference between both methods diminishes .    by applying equation  ( [ eq : tmax ] ) to a standard ( non - fractional ) tsc scan one gets the activation energy of the most prominent traps .",

    "the shoulder on the high temperature side of the bispc@xmath0bm tsc peak indicates the presence of a significant amount of even deeper traps .",
    "the high activation energies might originate from the mixture of isomers in bispc@xmath0bm .",
    "the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energies for the different isomers range from -3.71  ev to -3.54  ev  @xcite , introducing a higher energetic disorder  where the lowest lying states may act as traps .",
    "furthermore , due to the additional side chains a close packing of the buckyballs is inhibited , which may result in a higher spatial disorder , also introducing additional traps .",
    "pc@xmath1bm yields two distinct peaks in the tsc spectrum .",
    "the one at lower temperatures with an activation energy of about 95  mev is quite similar to the main trap of pc@xmath0bm .",
    "the second one yields high trap activation energies of about 223  mev .",
    "similar to bispc@xmath0bm , pc@xmath1bm also consists of multiple isomers ( one major and two minor isomers )  @xcite which might be the origin of the deep traps .",
    "furthermore , the pc@xmath1bm batch has a lower purity grade ( @xmath1499  % ) compared to pc@xmath0bm ( @xmath3099.5  % ) and therefore a higher impurity concentration which can lead to a higher trap density .",
    "another explanation for the higher trap density and the deeper traps compared to pc@xmath0bm might be a higher disorder in pc@xmath1bm films , due to the spatial anisotropy of c@xmath32 .",
    "the shapes of the tsc spectra ( the shoulders in addition to the main peak ) of the three investigated methanofullerenes indicate that the trap distribution of each of the fullerene derivatives consists of at least three peaks .",
    "this is affirmed by the fractional tsc measurements on pc@xmath0bm yielding a quasi - continuous trap distribution between 15  mev and 270  mev .",
    "the tsc peaks of pc@xmath1bm and bispc@xmath0bm are even broader compared to pc@xmath0bm , which is in agreement with the reported higher energetic disorder of bispc@xmath0bm  @xcite .",

    "this has also been observed before @xcite and was attributed to trapping .",
    "however direct measurements of the traps were missing so far .",
    "due to the high trap densities in the investigated methanofullerenes in the order of @xmath2  m@xmath3 , which is in the range of charge carrier densities of operating solar cells  @xcite , a strong influence on the solar cell performance can be expected .",
    "although , bispc@xmath0bm has successfully been used in p3ht : fullerene photovoltaic devices , a reduced photocurrent was observed compared to solar cells using pc@xmath0bm as acceptor  @xcite .",
    "thereby , the reduced photocurrent is not due to a lower free polaron generation yield ( as might be assumed because of the lower electron affinity of bispc@xmath0bm compared to pc@xmath0bm ) .",
    "even a higher charge photogeneration efficiency in the p3ht : bispc@xmath0bm blend was demonstrated by transient absorption spectroscopy  @xcite . instead",
    ", the loss in short circuit current was attributed to the significantly lower ( about one order of magnitude ) electron mobility in bispc@xmath0bm compared to pc@xmath0bm  @xcite .",
    "this increases the recombination probability during charge extraction and therefore reduces the photocurrent .",
    "the lower mobility of bispc@xmath0bm is in agreement with our measurements , showing a higher trap density and deeper trap states in bispc@xmath0bm compared to pc@xmath0bm .",
    "furthermore , a slower decay of transient absorption intensity was observed in the blends with bispc@xmath0bm @xcite .",
    "this was attributed to trapping and detrapping events resulting in a delay in the bimolecular recombination of charges .",
    "our measurements reveal the presence of deeper trap states in bispc@xmath0bm , leading to a slower release of trapped charges , which is in agreement with the reported reduced recombination dynamics .",
    "protracted charge carrier decay dynamics , with a charge carrier density dependence larger than order of two , are often reported in organic solar cells @xcite and are attributed to trapping of charges . due to the high trap densities in the methanofullerenes , which are even higher than the reported trap density of pristine p3ht @xcite",
    ", the recombination dynamics should be also significantly influenced by the acceptor , not only by the donor polymer . because of the higher trap densities and deeper traps in bispc@xmath0bm and pc@xmath1bm we expect even stronger dependences of the charge carrier decay on the charge carrier density in blends with bispc@xmath0bm and pc@xmath1bm than in those with pc@xmath0bm .",
    "we investigated the trap states in pc@xmath0bm , pc@xmath1bm and bispc@xmath0bm by thermally stimulated current measurements .",

    "<S> thereby , the lower limit of the trap densities for all studied methanofullerenes exhibits values in the order of @xmath2  m@xmath3 with the highest trap density in bispc@xmath0bm and the lowest in pc@xmath0bm . </S>",
    "<S> fractional tsc measurements on pc@xmath0bm reveal a broad trap distribution instead of discrete trap levels with activation energies ranging from 15  mev to 270  mev and the maximum at about 75  mev . </S>",
    "<S> the activation energies of the most prominent traps in the other two fullerene derivatives are significantly higher , being at 96  mev and 223  mev for pc@xmath1bm and 184  mev for bispc@xmath0bm , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the influence of these findings on the performance of organic solar cells is discussed . </S>",
