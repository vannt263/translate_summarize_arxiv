    "while a country suffers financial problems when its gdp does not increase fast enough , even more serious trouble begins when its debt increases faster than its gdp . while national gdp has been the topic of many studies on economic growth @xcite , the empirical analysis of public debt has lagged due to lack of comprehensive data .",
