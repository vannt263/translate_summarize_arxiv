    "theoretically a neutron star ( ns ) can be formed in three different ways : core - collapse supernova ( ccsn ) of a massive star , electron capture supernova ( ecsn ) of an intermediate - mass star , and accretion - induced collapse ( aic ) of a massive white dwarf ( wd ) ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "aic may occur either through rapid mass transfer onto an onemg wd in a binary from a non - degenerate companion star , or through merger of two wds in a compact binary , and the evolutionary processes are similar to those in the single and double degenerate scenarios for type ia supernovae , respectively . in the former case the onemg",
    "wd may retain the transferred h- and/or he - rich material by stable nuclear burning and grow to the chandrasekhar mass @xcite .",
    "electrons are then captured by mg and ne , heating the surroundings . however , the energy released by the o+ne deflagration is too small to cause an explosion of the tightly bound core @xcite .",
    "further electron capture eventually leads to gravitational core collapse to form an ns without an sn @xcite .",
    "aic has been proposed as an alternative channel to form millisecond pulsars ( msps ) besides the standard recycling scenario with core - collapse nss @xcite .",
    "msps are old radio pulsars with spin periods less than 20 ms .",
    "most of them are found in binary systems , and their magnetic fields ( @xmath4 g ) are significantly lower than those ( @xmath5 g ) of ordinary pulsars @xcite . in the standard recycling model ,",
    "msps are thought to be the descendants of low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , in which nss have accreted sufficient mass and angular momentum from the companion star via roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) , and been spun up to millisecond periods ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for reviews ) .",
    "a longstanding problem for the recycling scenario is the discrepancy between the birth rates of galactic lmxbs and msps , as first noticed by @xcite .",
    "this problem has been tackled by many authors both observationally and theoretically ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "most recent works on the galactic msp population show that the birth rate problem is still present @xcite .",
    "the advantage of the aic scenario is that it might maintain a sufficiently high formation rate to account for msps ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , msps formed via aic are actually difficult to distinguish from those evolved from lmxbs , since the subsequent mass transfer after the aic event proceeds in a way similar as in the recycling scenario @xcite . the aic scenario is especially favored for the pulsars in globular clusters which have characteristic ages significantly less than the ages of the clusters , suggesting that they were formed very recently with a very small kick imparted on the newly born ns @xcite .",
    "aic is also invoked to explain the strong - field pulsars with a he wd companion ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or strong - field accreting nss in lmxbs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which seem to have experienced extensive mass accretion , and should have very weak fields according to the recycling scenario .    in a recent work",
    ", @xcite investigated the binary evolution leading to aic to examine if nss formed in this way can subsequently be recycled to form msps .",
    "it was found that this scenario is possible for systems with companion stars that are either main - sequence ( ms ) stars , giants stars , or he stars .",
    "the first type of companion stars lead to fully recycled msps with he wd companions , whereas the other two types of donors lead to more mildly recycled pulsars with mainly co wd companions . for msp",
    "/ he wd binaries the orbital periods are predicted to lie between about 10 days and about 60 days , consistent with @xcite . since observations of msps reveal an orbital period range between a few hours and up to 1000 days , one needs to know whether msps with shorter orbital periods can also be formed via aic .    in this paper",
    "we explore a supplementary aic channel to the msp formation taking into account the influence of irradiation - excited wind in accreting wd binaries @xcite .",
    "our study is similar to @xcite , but the evolutionary processes are considerably different . in particular our calculations can reproduce msp / he wd binaries with relatively short orbital periods ( less than a few days ) , and the lmxbs containing a strong - field ns like 4u 1822@xmath137 .",
    "we also show that the evolutions can lead to the formation of redbacks .",
    "this paper is arranged as follows .",
    "we describe the model assumptions in section 2 .",
    "our calculated results of pre- and post - aic evolution are shown section 3 , which are also compared with observations of binary msps .",
    "we discuss the possible implications of our results and conclude in section 4 .",
    "the growth of the wd mass in a binary requires that the accreted material can be stably burned on the surface of the wd , and this usually occurs when the companion star , if it is an ms star , is more massive than the wd , so that mass transfer can proceed on a thermal timescale @xcite . in this case",
    "the accreting wd often appears as a supersoft x - ray sources ( ssss , * ? ? ?",
    ". however , the observational properties of some ssss including rx j0439.8@xmath16809 , 1e0035.4@xmath17230 , rx j0537.7@xmath17034 , and cal 87 @xcite , as well as the recurrent nova t pyxidis @xcite , seem not to fit in the classical picture .",
    "most of them have orbital periods of a few hours , smaller than expected for thermal timescale mass transfer @xcite , and the companion stars are therefore less massive than the wds , but can still maintain a high mass transfer rate .",
    "another challenge comes from the dipping lmxb 4u 1822@xmath137 @xcite .",
    "the companion star in 4u 1822@xmath137 is of low mass ( @xmath6 ) @xcite .",
    "x - ray and optical light curves indicate an orbital period @xmath7 hr @xcite .",
    "recent _ suzaku _ observation detected a cyclotron resonance scattering feature at an energy of @xmath8 kev , implying that the ns in this source has a strong magnetic field of @xmath9 g @xcite .",
    "since the ns must have accreted at least a few tenths @xmath10 matter from its companion , which would significantly reduce the field as in typical lmxbs , an aic model seems to be the most likely explanation for its current strong field . in this model",
    "the renewed mass transfer should not have lasted long time , so that the companion star and the orbit have not changed considerably since the aic , but the short orbital period and small companion mass are both inconsistent with the traditional sss expectation .    a possible solution to the above puzzles",
    "is the self - excited wind model suggested by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they argue that perhaps in all wd binaries the soft x - ray radiation from an accreting wd may lead to a strong stellar wind from the heated side of the companion star .",
    "if the wind takes away the specific angular momentum of the companion from the binary , mass transfer will be driven at a rate comparable with the wind loss rate .",
    "the relation between the mass transfer rate @xmath11 and the wind loss rate @xmath12 obeys @xmath13 for @xmath14 ; and @xmath15 for @xmath16 . here",
    "@xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are the wd mass , the companion mass , and the total mass , respectively ; @xmath20 measures the efficiency of the wd s spectrum in producing ionizing photons normalized to the case of supersoft x - ray temperatures with a magnitude of @xmath21 k , @xmath22 measures the luminosity per gram of matter accreted relative to the value for h shell burning , and @xmath23 is an efficiency factor parameterizing the fraction of the companion s irradiated face and the fraction of the wind mass escaping the system .",
    "considering the irradiation - excited winds from the companion star and its effect on the binary evolution , we investigate the mass transfer processes of a binary consisting of an onemg wd and an ms companion star with an updated version of eggleton s stellar evolution code @xcite . in addition ,",
    "angular momentum loss caused by gravitational wave radiation @xcite and magnetic braking @xcite is also included in the calculation .",
    "we explore the parameter space of the initial binaries for aic , and , if nss are formed in this way , the properties of the resultant binaries .    during accretion the growth of the wd mass",
    "is associated with the accumulation efficiencies of h- and he - rich matter , @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 represent the fraction of the transferred h- and he - rich matter from the companion that eventually burns into he- and c - rich matter and stays on the wd , respectively .",
    "here we fit the numerical results of @xcite and @xcite for the h mass accumulation efficiency @xmath25 , and adopt the prescriptions in @xcite for the he mass accumulation efficiency @xmath27 .",
    "if the wd mass reaches the chandrasekhar limit ( @xmath28 ) , we assume that the wd collapses to be a ns with a gravitational mass of @xmath29 ( termed as the chandrasekhar model ) . during this process @xmath30 mass",
    "is assumed to convert into the binding energy .",
    "the sudden mass loss makes the orbit wider and the temporary detachment of the rl .",
    "the relation between the orbital separations ( @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) just before and after the collapse is @xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the ns mass .",
    "we also assume that there is no kick received by the newborn ns .",
    "investigations by @xcite and @xcite have shown that including a kick velocity with a dispersion of 50 kms@xmath35 does not seriously affect the final results .",
    "the observed super - luminous sne ia hint that there may be super - chandrasekhar mass wd progenitors @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that rapid rotation allows a massive wd to continue accreting when the accretion rate @xmath36 , and there would not be the central c ignition even if its mass exceeds @xmath37 .",
    "we accordingly assume that a super - chandrasekhar mass wd can exist and it undergoes a collapses when @xmath38 so that there is no differential rotation to support the wd ( termed as the super - chandrasekhar model ) .",
    "after aic the companion star will refill its rl due to angular momentum loss or nuclear / thermal evolution .",
    "mass transfer is then resumed , and the post - aic binary evolves as an lmxb .",
    "the interplay between angular momentum loss and nuclear expansion of the donor leads to the so - called bifurcation periods ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "lmxbs with orbital periods shorter or longer than @xmath39 will form converging or diverging systems , respectively @xcite .",
    "following @xcite we assume that the mass transfer is nonconservative and eddington limited .",
    "the ns accretion rate is described by the following equation , @xmath40)\\cdot e_{\\rm a}\\cdot k_{\\rm d},\\ ] ] where @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) is the eddington accretion rate , @xmath43 is the fraction of the transferred matter that remains on the ns , and @xmath44 is a factor denoting the ratio of gravitational mass to rest mass of the accreted matter . in this paper we take @xmath45 .",
    "we have performed numerical calculation of the evolution of a grid of binaries consisting of an onemg wd of initial mass @xmath46 and an ms companion star of initial mass @xmath47 with both pop i and ii compositions under the irradiation - excited wind - driven model .",
    "the detailed calculated results are described as follows .",
    "figure 1 shows the distribution of the initial companion s mass @xmath48 versus the initial orbital period @xmath49 , in which the binaries can evolve to aic .",
    "the left , middle , and right panels correspond to the chandrasekhar model with metallicities @xmath50 and 0.001 , and the super - chandrasekhar model with @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "it is seen from the left and middle panels that , while the upper limit of the donor mass is about @xmath51 , similar to that in the standard sss model , the lower limit can go down to @xmath52 .",
    "the initial orbital periods range from about @xmath53 to about @xmath54 . compared with the results without the wind considered @xcite in which the lower limit of the donor mass @xmath55",
    ", the donor mass extends to smaller mass ( @xmath56 ) , and the orbital period distribution becomes narrower .",
    "the reason is that here the mass transfer is mainly driven by the excited wind when @xmath18 is less than @xmath17 , rather than the thermal evolution of the companion star .",
    "meanwhile , the wind can somewhat stabilize the mass transfer when @xmath18 is larger than @xmath17 . outside the confined regions",
    "either the mass transfer becomes dynamically unstable , or the wd can never reach the chandrasekhar limit because of relatively low mass transfer rate . in the right panel , the wd is assumed to rotate rapidly and continue accreting matter when its mass exceeds the chandrasekhar limit .",
    "when the mass transfer rate becomes below @xmath57 , it slows down and begins to collapse . in this case , systems that can successfully evolve to aic have companions of initial masses @xmath58 , and initial orbital periods @xmath59 days . the parameter space is smaller than in the former two cases because generally more massive donors are required to sustain sufficient matter to form a super - chandrasekhar wd . in the figure",
    "the red lines divide the final evolutionary products of the binaries .",
    "systems above the red line will evolve to become ns / wd binaries .",
    "the companion stars in the regions below the red line are of low mass and in short orbits after aic , and they stay in the ms phase within the hubble time . in figure 2 , we show the distribution of the companion mass @xmath60 versus the orbital period @xmath61 at the moment of aic .",
    "the left , middle , and right panels correspond to those in fig .  1 , respectively .",
    "the most striking feature is that the orbital periods occupy in a small range @xmath62 days , and the companion mass goes down to @xmath63 for the chandrasekhar model .",
    "the low mass of the companion star and the short orbital period mainly originate from the mass and angular momentum loss related to the irradiation - excited wind .",
    "the wd accretes more mass from the donor in the super - chandrasekhar model .",
    "therefore , the range of the companion mass ( @xmath64 ) when aic occurs is smaller , but the orbital period range ( @xmath65 days ) is a bit larger .",
    "figures 3 and 4 display four examples of the evolution of the mass transfer rate , the orbital period , the companion mass , and the wd / ns mass for binaries with different initial parameters in the pre- and post - aic phases , respectively . here",
    "we adopt the chandrasekhar model with @xmath50 .    in the top panel of fig .",
    "3 we take @xmath66 and @xmath67 days . in such a binary",
    "the traditional thermal - timescale mass transfer is not rapid enough for stable h burning .",
    "however , its rate is enhanced by the irradiation - excited wind up to a few @xmath68 , thus the wd can grow in mass to @xmath37 .",
    "the orbital period decreases along with the mass transfer . in the second panel",
    "we take @xmath69 and @xmath70 days .",
    "since the donor mass is considerably larger than the wd mass , although the irradiation - excited wind also works , the mass transfer actually proceeds on a thermal timescale , similar as in typical ssss . in the third panel",
    "we take @xmath71 and @xmath72 day .",
    "the binary evolution seems to be similar to that in the top panel before aic , but differs after aic as shown in fig .",
    "4 . in the bottom panel",
    "we take @xmath73 and @xmath74 day , which are below the red line in fig .  1 .",
    "this binary will evolve towards to an very compact system after aic .",
    "figure 4 shows the post - aic mass transfer processes in the four binaries discussed above .",
    "the binaries evolve in a similar way as low- and intermediate - mass x - ray binaries . in the first one ( in the top panel ) ,",
    "the mass transfer initiates when the orbital period @xmath75 day and the companion mass @xmath76 .",
    "these values are roughly in accord with the donor mass and the orbital period of the lmxb 4u 1822@xmath137 . hence if the newborn ns possesses a strong magnetic field ( @xmath77 g ) , the evolutionary sequence in the top panels of figs .",
    "3 and 4 provides a possible formation path of 4u 1822@xmath137 .",
    "the orbital period increases with mass transfer to @xmath78 days when the donor loses its envelope and leaves a he wd . about @xmath79 mass",
    "is accreted by the ns , which should be recycled to be an msp . in the second case ,",
    "the mass transfer begins at a longer orbital period ( @xmath80 days ) .",
    "the orbital period increases to @xmath81 days when the donor evolves to become a wd .",
    "the ns accretes a large amount of mass ( @xmath82 ) , and a significant decay of its magnetic field is also expected . in the third panel",
    "the mass transfer initiates when the orbital period @xmath83 day .",
    "that is very close to @xmath84 so the final orbital period does not change much .",
    "the companion star finally becomes a @xmath85 he wd , and the ns is recycled by accreting about @xmath86 mass .",
    "the last binary evolves all the way to be a very compact x - ray binary .",
    "the ns continues accreting mass when the donor star keeps on the ms , and the orbital period decreases down to @xmath87 day when the donor mass is lower than @xmath88 .",
    "the fate of the binary may be a black widow system .    in table 1",
    "we list the calculated parameters of selected binary evolutionary sequences . in most cases",
    "the nss can accrete @xmath89 mass during the post - aic mass transfer phase , which seems to be sufficient to reduce the ns fields to @xmath90 g and accelerate the ns spin periods to @xmath91 ms .",
    "however , this is strongly dependent on the ( unknown ) mass transfer efficiency , and there is mounting evidence that nss may accrete a small fraction of the transferred mass in the evolution of lmxbs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "figure 5 shows the the distribution of the produced ns / wd binaries in the orbital period ( @xmath92 ) vs. the wd mass ( @xmath93 ) diagram .",
    "the solid , dotted and dashed lines represent the results of the chandrasekhar model with @xmath50 and 0.001 , and of the super - chandrasekhar model with @xmath50 , respectively . the observed binary pulsars with a wd companion",
    "are also plotted in dots , with different colors denoting the range of the pulsar magnetic fields ( data are taken from the atnf pulsar catalogue ) : red , blue , and green colors are for @xmath94 g , @xmath95 g @xmath96 g , and @xmath97 g , respectively . they roughly correspond to recycled , mildly recycled , and non - recycled pulsars , respectively .",
    "it is seen that the predicted orbital periods of ns / wd binaries are distributed between @xmath2 day and @xmath3 days , and the wd masses are between @xmath98 and @xmath99 , compatible with a large fraction of the known msp / he wd binaries and a pulsar mass of @xmath100 .",
    "we do not plot the error bars for the clarity of the figure . ] .",
    "however , it is still unable to account for some peculiar systems like psr 1831@xmath100 , which has a strong ( @xmath101 g ) magnetic field , a short ( 1.81 days ) orbit , and a very low - mass ( @xmath102 ) wd companion @xcite .",
    "with population synthesis calculations , @xcite suggested that , while both the ccsn and aic channels lead to populations of x - ray binaries and binary msps at the end of the accretion phase , the birthrates of binary msps via aic are comparable to or even exceed those for ccsne , and it appears to be the major channel for the pulsars in long - period ( @xmath103 a few days ) systems with he wd companions under certain model assumptions .",
    "these conclusions are further confirmed by @xcite with detailed evolutionary calculations .",
    "they showed that msps formed via aic and which have he wd companions generally have @xmath61 between 10 and 60 days .",
    "however , as pointed out by @xcite , both the aic and ccsn channels have a problem producing the observed binary msps with 0.1 day @xmath104 days .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the formation of msp / he wd binaries with an aic origin , taking into account the effect of the irradiation - excited wind . because of the angular momentum loss associated with the wind mass loss , the initial orbital periods of successful systems are always within a few days .",
    "the resultant msp / he wd binaries are inclined to have orbital periods between @xmath2 day and @xmath3 days , and he wds with masses between @xmath98 and @xmath105 .",
    "if we combine the results of @xcite and @xcite with this work , it seems that the aic channel can at least cover the majority of the orbital period range of the observed msp / wd binaries .    the predicted orbital period and wd mass distributions of the binary pulsar systems depicted in fig .",
    "5 are also in broad agreement with those in previous investigations on l / imxbs @xcite .",
    "for binaries with low - mass he wds , lower metallicities tend to result in shorter orbital periods , similar as in @xcite .",
    "however , since msps with he wd companions in very compact binaries can also be accounted for by lmxb evolution if the progenitor binary experienced very late case a mass transfer @xcite , it is difficult to distinguish the formation channels for msps only from their currently measured parameters . besides ( partially ) alleviating the birth rate discrepancy between msps and lmxbs , the aic channel under wind - driven evolution may be preferred for the formation of the strong - field nss in  old \" binaries with short orbital periods .",
    "the ns in 4u 1822@xmath137 as mentioned before is one example .",
    "the binary radio pulsar psr b1718@xmath119 in the globular cluster ngc 6342 @xcite could be another example .",
    "it is a young , long - spin period ( @xmath106 s ) pulsar , with a characteristic age of 10 myr and a magnetic field of @xmath107 g. the origin of such apparent young objects in very old systems has not been understood . if psr b1718@xmath119 was formed through aic recently ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , its 6.2 hr orbital period can be accounted for by the irradiation - excited wind during the previous mass transfer phase .",
    "the magnetic field of a newborn ns after aic depends on the property and the accretion history of the wd , as well as the complicated field decay / generation mechanisms ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , so that it is difficult to precisely predict the field distribution .",
    "if the wd originally has a very weak field , the ns may be born with rapid rotation ( milliseconds in periods ) and a low field ( @xmath108 g ) , if we assume the magnetic flux is conserved . during the aic some baryonic mass",
    "is abruptly lost to its binding energy so that the orbit expands and the companion star is detached from its rl .",
    "the mass transfer terminates and the ns appears as an msp , which may be able to ablate / evaporate the companion with its high - energy radiation and particles , leading to the redback - like systems ( see * ? ? ? * for a review on redbacks ) .",
    "this turning - on of an msp activity was previously assumed to occur during the lmxb evolution when the mass transfer rate is temporarily decreased @xcite . the aic scenario for the redback formation",
    "was recently proposed by @xcite .",
    "they showed that the subsequent evolution is determined by orbital angular momentum loss owing to gravitational radiation and magnetic braking and ablation of the companion star at a rate of @xcite @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the msp s spin - down luminosity ( taken a typical value of @xmath111 ergs@xmath35 ) , @xmath112 an efficiency parameter denoting the fraction of the psr s luminosity that is used to ablate the companion , @xmath113 the escape velocity of a thermal wind from the surface of the companion , @xmath114 the companion s radius , and @xmath32 the binary separation .",
    "it was shown that if @xmath115 , ablation is strong enough to overcome the pull of magnetic braking immediately after aic and the systems evolve to longer orbital periods without the occurrence of a second rlof . in @xcite ,",
    "all the initial systems have a @xmath116 wd and a @xmath117 donor with a 0.3 day orbital period .",
    "however , it has been already known that the evolution of such a binary can not lead to the formation of a chandrasekhar - mass wd , because the mass transfer driven by magnetic braking is too low to allow stable h and he burning ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "aided with an irradiation - excited wind it is able to evolve to aic as shown in this work .",
    "we have calculated the binary evolution after aic assuming that the nss are born as msps . in fig .",
    "6 we illustrate the evolutionary tracks for six example binary pulsars . here",
    "the green , black , and red lines are for the cases with @xmath118 , 0.45 , and 0.8 , respectively .",
    "the blue triangles show the positions of known redbacks .",
    "figure 6 confirms that it is possible to account for redbacks at both small and large companion masses by changing the value of @xmath112 ( or @xmath110 ) within a proper range .",
    "finally it should be noted that the conditions for the wind - driven evolution are not well understood , so the birthrate of msps via wind - driven aic currently can not be confidently estimated . although there is evidence that there is or has been rapid mass transfer in short - period wd binaries with a low - mass companion star , most of the known such wd binaries are ordinary cataclysmic variables , suggesting that the wind - driven case might not be popular , and its occurrence requires some special conditions ( see * ? ? ? * for a discussion ) .",
    "obviously a thorough investigation on this subject will be of great value not only for aic and sne ia , but also for the overall evolution of cataclysmic variables .",

    "<S> accretion - induced collapse of massive white dwarfs ( wds ) has been proposed to be an important channel to form binary millisecond pulsars ( msps ) . </S>",

    "<S> we calculate the evolution of wd binaries taking into account the excited wind from the companion star induced by x - ray irradiation of the accreting wd , which may drive rapid mass transfer even when the companion star is less massive than the wd . </S>",
    "<S> this scenario can naturally explain the formation of the strong - field neutron star in the low - mass x - ray binary 4u 1822@xmath137 . </S>",
    "<S> after aic the mass transfer resumes when the companion star refills its roche lobe , and the neutron star is recycled due to mass accretion . </S>",
    "<S> a large fraction of the binaries will evolve to become binary msps with a he wd companion , with the orbital periods distributed between @xmath2 day and @xmath3 days , while some of them may follow the cataclysmic variable - like evolution towards very short orbits . </S>",
    "<S> if we instead assume that the newborn neutron star appears as an msp and part of its rotational energy is used to ablate its companion star , the binaries may also evolve to be the redback - like systems . </S>"
