    "quite a number of observations of type i and ii superluminous supernovae ( slsne , slsne - i , and slsne - ii ) have appeared during the last few years @xcite .",
    "the definitions of slsn - i , slsn - ii , and other relevant material are reviewed in  @xcite .",
    "there are signs that these objects have been observed even at high redshifts , @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the mechanism of the explosion for such bright and long lasting events is still not fully understood .",
    "one can consider either an unusually energetic explosion through which a huge amount of @xmath6niis produced @xcite , or an additional energy source , like a millisecond magnetar , that somehow transforms its rotation energy into the energy of the sn ejecta @xcite , or an interaction of the ejecta with an extended and dense circumstellar ( cs ) envelope , which we focus on in this paper .",
    "@xcite have shown that the width of the sn light curve depends on the mass through which the shock wave breaks out .",
    "if an exploding star possesses just a standard hydrostatic envelope , like an atmosphere of a supergiant star , the broadening of its light curve can not be extremely large .",
    "however , sometimes the star , especially the massive one , can be surrounded by rather dense and extended envelope originated from slow wind , preexplosions , or stellar mergers . in section  [ sec : summary ]",
    "we will discuss several possible ways to form such an envelope in a little more detail .",
    "the idea of producing large radiative flux during the interaction of the gas ejected in two subsequent explosions was suggested by @xcite for the explanation of sne  iin .",
    "@xcite successfully applied this model to the explanation of spectral and light curve features of type iin sn  1994w .",
    "a physical mechanism for those multiple explosions ( pulsational pair instability ) was proposed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite used this model to explain type ii superluminous sn  2006gy as a moderately energetic explosion ( @xmath7  ergs ) without any radioactive material .",
    "sn light curves for the interacting model have been constructed analytically in a number of papers .",
    "@xcite compared the light curves for optically thin vs. optically thick cases .",
    "@xcite found a good agreement of analytical interacting models with the light curves of slsne  iin .",
    "@xcite present several semi - analytical models of the slsn light curves for three feasible power inputs mentioned above and their combinations .",
    "they found that the ejecta - csm interaction model provided a better fit to the light curves of most of the observed hydrogen - rich events ( slsne - ii ) they investigated , and they suggested that the same mechanism can be applied to hydrogen - poor events ( slsne - i ) .",
    "numerically , the interaction model for slsne is the most difficult for calculation among all the possibilities under consideration .",
    "the cause of difficulties is the complicated hydrodynamical structure of the model .",
    "most of the gas is gathered into a thin and dense layer behind the radiation dominated shock wave , which can lead to thermal and hydrodynamical instabilities .",
    "there are only a very few numerical codes in the world that are able to cope with this problem .",
    "a few papers have been published in which slsne - ii were modeled @xcite .",
    "the shock interaction with csm is generally considered the most probable explanation for the high luminosity of slsne - ii . in this paper , we will focus on another type of slsne : hydrogen - poor slsne - i .",
    "the work was started in @xcite , where we followed @xcite who calculated light curves for the explosion caused by a carbon - oxygen ( co ) white dwarf merger .",
    "after the explosion , the model is hydrodynamically similar to the interacting slsn model : the explosion also happens inside a dense ( but probably a bit less extended ) envelope . in @xcite , we show that in principle superluminous sn  2010gx can also be explained by the interaction model with moderate values for the explosion parameters . after that work ,",
    "we have improved our radiation hydrodynamics numerical code stella @xcite in order to make it more appropriate to solve the slsn problem . in the current paper",
    ", we demonstrate a few more carbon - oxygen and helium interacting models for sn  2010gx and ptf09cnd , which are among supernovae with the narrowest and broadest light curves , respectively , known for slsne - i .",
    "both models require moderate explosion energy and a reasonable radius of the extended envelope , though the mass of carbon in the envelope must be quite large to reproduce the broad light curve .",
    "we briefly discuss some possibilities to create such a system through stellar evolution in the last section of the paper .",
    "if these systems really exist this would allow us to claim that the bulk of slsne might have a similar origin and that most of their radiation might be produced during an interaction of sn ejecta with extended envelopes or detached shells .",
    "the differences between slsne - i can be explained by different cs envelope structures .",
    "this does not relate to some very exotic objects , like asassn15lh @xcite , which stands apart from the bulk of slsne - i due to its extremely high luminosity , and origin of which is still questionable .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : presn ]",
    "we describe the models we use .",
    "section  [ sec : simul ] explains how we have carried out simulations of sn light curves . in sections  [ sec : hydroprofiles ] and [ sec :",
    "lcsp ] we present the results of our calculations and compare them to the observed broad band light curves of sn  2010gx and ptf09cnd . in section  [ sec : summary ]",

    "all presupernova models for this work have been constructed in the same way as we described in many papers @xcite . a  quasi - polytropic structure in mechanical equilibrium",

    "the temperature is related to the density as @xmath8 .",
    "this part has mass @xmath9 and radius @xmath10 , which is equal to 10  for all models in this work .",
    "@xmath9 can be much less than the total mass of the collapsing core and the condition of the mechanical equilibrium is not necessary ; it is just a convenient form of parameterizing the models .    to make an interacting model , we surround the ejecta with a rather dense envelope with the mass @xmath11 extended to the radius @xmath12 .",
    "for all of our models , the outer radius of the cs envelope is about @xmath13  , or @xmath14  cm . for most of the models ,",
    "the envelope adjoins the ejecta without any jump in density between the ejecta and the envelope and has a power - law density distribution @xmath15 , which simulates the envelope or the wind that surrounds the exploding star .",
    "we will refer to this structure as the `` extended envelope . '' for a steady wind , @xmath16 , but in the very last stages of the evolution of a presupernova star the wind may not be steady . for our models , we vary @xmath17 in the range between 1.5 and  3.5 .",
    "we also tried another kind of density distribution in the cs envelope : we construct a model with the envelope concentrated within a shell detached from the ejecta by a region of lower density .",
    "the density falls down and raises up still with power - law behavior , but the slope of its distribution for this kind of model is steeper than in the windy - like models we described above .",
    "we will call this structure `` a detached shell . ''",
    "the density distributions for a couple of typical models are shown in figure  [ fig : init.density ] in order to illustrate these two kinds of structures .",
    "no attempt is done to keep equilibrium in the cs envelope , but its dynamical time scale is so large that no appreciable motion has developed during the time of the light curve simulation .",
    "we calculate light curves for sne exploding within these envelopes .",
    "a shock wave forms at the border between the ejecta and the envelope .",
    "it very efficiently converts the energy of the ordered motion of expanding gas to that of the chaotic thermal motion of particles , which can be easily emitted . as a result",
    ", we expect to derive light curves bright enough to explain at least part of slsne - i without an assumption of unusually high explosion energy .",
    "chemical elements in all but one of our models are distributed uniformly .",
    "typically , we use co models with different c to o ratios or helium models .",
    "we always add some elements with higher atomic numbers ( usually , 2% of the total mass ) with the abundances in solar proportion .",
    "the models do not contain any radioactive elements since the goal of the current work is to check the effect of pure ejecta - csm interaction .",
    "we will show the influence of radioactive @xmath6ni  to the light curve in the next paper ( a.tolstov et al .",
    "2016 , in preparation ) .",
    "all models initially have @xmath18  k in the envelope .",
    "higher envelope temperatures produce a spurious flash of light emitted by the huge envelope during its cooling @xcite .",
    "the main parameters of the best models for sn  2010gx and ptf09cnd are shown in the table  [ table : models ] .",
    "the models starting with `` n '' ( i.e. , narrow ) are able to reproduce the light curve of sn  2010gx , those starting with `` b '' ( broad ) are constructed for ptf09cnd .",
    "models n0 and b0 provide the best fits , all other models also have light curves close to the observations . we use them to demonstrate some dependences on model parameters .",
    "co5 , co7 , and co9 in the column `` composition '' mean that the model contains roughly 50% , 70% , and 90% of carbon and 50% , 30% , and 10% of oxygen , respectively .",
    "the only model with non - uniform composition is b6 .",
    "we used it to check how much the mixing of helium with carbon and oxygen could affect slsn light curves .",
    "the inner 4  of the ejecta in this model is the co mixture with the proportion @xmath19 , as in the model b0 .",
    "then in the outer parts of ejecta some amount of helium appears and grows up to about 50% in the outermost layer of ejecta .",

    "we discuss some feasible ways of the formation of these dense cs envelopes in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "we calculate the synthetic light curves using our multi - group radiation hydrodynamic code stella in its standard setup @xcite .",
    "the code simulates spherically symmetric hydrodynamic flows coupled with multi - group radiative transfer .",
    "standard runs use 300 radial lagrangean mesh zones . when compared to 500 mesh zones ,",
    "the results do not change significantly .",
    "the opacity routine takes into account electron scattering , free - free , and bound - free processes .",
    "contribution of spectral lines ( i.e. bound - bound processes ) is treated in approximation of `` expansion '' opacity .",
    "various approaches to the expansion opacity are described in detail by @xcite .",
    "we use the method suggested by @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "all runs employed 100 frequency groups in the transport solver and a relatively short spectral line list ( @xmath25  lines ) in the opacity routine .",
    "stella in its standard version calculates variable eddington factors in a static approximation once per every 50 hydrodynamic steps .",
    "we checked some runs with the results of the rada code , which computes full time - dependent radiative transfer for intensity and uses more reliable eddington factors @xcite .",
    "the comparison with stella runs shows that the difference is not large ( see the discussion below ) .",
    "the explosions have been simulated as a `` thermal bomb '' with variable energy @xmath26 ( see table  [ table : models ] ) .",
    "the burst duration is 10  seconds in the innermost layers of ejecta with @xmath27 .",
    "figures  [ fig : hydron0 ] and [ fig : hydrob0 ] show how the profiles of density , velocity , temperature , and rosseland mean optical depth evolve over time for models n0 and b0 .",
    "the left panels correspond to the evolution before maximum of the light curve ( which happens on day 22 after the explosion for n0 and on day 66 for b0 as we will show later ) , the right panels show the evolution after maximum .    at the very beginning , when the shock wave structure starts to form due to a collision between the ejecta and the csm , the envelope is cool and transparent ( upper left plots on the figures  [ fig : hydron0 ] and  [ fig : hydrob0 ] ) .",
    "then the emission from the shock front heats the gas in the envelope , thus making it opaque , and the photosphere moves to the outermost layers rather quickly .",
    "when the photospheric radius reaches its maximum , one can observe maximal emission from the supernova .",
    "the speed of the growth of the photospheric radius depends on the mass of the envelope , since more photons must be emitted from the shock to heat larger mass envelopes .",
    "this is why the photosphere moves to the outermost layers in model n0 faster than in model b0 ( the plots on the left - hand side of figures  [ fig : hydron0 ] and [ fig : hydrob0 ] ) .",
    "another parameter that impacts the initial growth of the photospheric radius is the chemical composition of the envelope . in figure",
    "[ fig : opahe_co9 ] we compare the opacities of pure helium and mixture of carbon ( 90% ) and oxygen ( 10% ) for the same density @xmath28  g/@xmath29 .",
    "the left plot shows opacities at the temperature 7  000  k. at this temperature , helium still remains transparent , so the photosphere is deep inside the envelope .",
    "the opacity for the co mixture under the same conditions is six orders of magnitude higher . the optical depth at 7  000  k is large ,",
    "so one can see only the outermost layers of the co envelope . at 11  000  k ( right plot )",
    "the helium opacity rises up and becomes similar to the co one . in this case",
    ", the photospheric radii for both compositions must also be similar .",
    "thus , we predict that the light curve rises faster for a co envelope than for a he one because a lower temperature is needed to reach high opacity in a co mixture . this light curve behavior can help set the composition for some observed slsne .",
    "the plots on the right - hand side of figures  [ fig : hydron0 ] and [ fig : hydrob0 ] show the stages when the photosphere slowly moves back to the center , and the envelope and the ejecta finally become fully transparent . at the beginning of this post - maximum stage ,",
    "all gas in the envelope is already heated by the photons , which came from the shock region and diffused through the envelope to the outer edge , and the whole system ( ejecta and envelope ) becomes almost isothermal . the shock becomes weaker with time and emits fewer photons that can heat up the envelope , so the temperature of the still unshocked envelope falls down .",
    "the shocked material is gathered into a thin , dense layer , which finally contains almost all the mass in the system .",
    "the formation of this layer leads to numerical difficulties , which significantly limit the time step of the calculation . due to the fixed lagrangean grid ,",
    "most of the spacial bins in the layer have very similar radii , but their densities and temperatures are a bit different .",
    "thus , gas does not cool down identically in each bin , and counter motions develop in the dense layer when the pressure of neighboring spacial bins flattens out .",
    "this can lead to the overlapping of some bins if the time step of the calculation is too large .",
    "short time steps are required to avoid this overlapping .",
    "the use of an adaptive spacial grid might help , but stella has no such possibility .",
    "another problem can also take place due to the thin layer formation : a thin , dense shell with a very large radius would most probably be unstable and can fragment into smaller clumps .",

    "it evolves very quickly to the standard two - shock ( forward and reverse ) picture .",
    "this does not depend on the initial velocity profile in the envelope .",
    "the interaction of the ejecta with an expanding ( model n0 ) or static ( model b0 ) envelope leads to similar final velocity structures .",
    "it looks like a self - similar behavior analogous to the solution by @xcite , but with radiation .",
    "we have chosen two type i slsne to model  sn  2010gx ( @xmath31  ptf10cwr ) and ptf09cnd .",
    "both were described among the ptf set of slsne in @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "sn  2010gx and ptf09cnd have some of the narrowest and the broadest light curves , respectively , among all slsn - i .",
    "our goal is to model both of them by the interaction of the ejecta with the surrounding envelope in order to understand if most slsn - i can be explained by the same mechanism with different parameters of either explosion , or csm .",
    "we are interested in studying a pure effect of interaction with csm for the slsn light curve , thus we do not add @xmath6nior any other additional energy source inside our models .",
    "all of the emission comes from the transformation of ordered particle motion into a chaotic state when gas passes through a shock wave .",
    "when the shock reaches the outer edge of the extended envelope and no material remains in front of the shock anymore , no source of energy remains .",
    "the gas looses its thermal energy through radiation and cools down very quickly .",
    "it corresponds to a sharp drop in flux in all spectral bands .",
    "this drop is a typical feature of the light curves for the interacting models , though it must not necessarily be seen on the observed slsne since it happens a few months after maximum ( if the envelope is extended enough )",
    ". the supernova may be unobservable or a second energy source may become dominant by this phase .",
    "one clearly needs a very large radius envelope to produce an extremely bright and long - lasting event for a model without a huge explosion energy .",
    "one also needs high densities for strong production of light by the shock .",
    "however , when the density is too high , the mass of the envelope and the optical depth of the shell become too large .",
    "this would make the supernova appear red and would not match with observations of slsne - i , which tend to be blue ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "thus , an enhanced envelope mass must be accompanied by an enhanced explosion energy , which will lead to the formation of a stronger and hotter shock .",
    "we have run tens of different models , varying many parameters .",
    "we will provide a detailed discussion on the wide set of models and analyze the influence of the model parameters on the bolometric and broad band light curves in a future paper ( e.sorokina et al .",
    "2016 , in preparation ) . here",

    "we present models that better reproduce the light curves of sn  2010gx .",
    "so far , no numerical calculations except for ours were presented for the broad band light curves of slsne - i in the ejecta - csm interaction scenario .",

    "this corresponds to the distance modulus 40.28 .",
    "model n0 seems to provide the best match to sn  2010gx ( figure  [ pic : best10gx ] ) .",
    "the maximum emission and the slopes of the light curves after the maximum are in excellent agreement , though the light curve in the _ u _ band is a bit too bright .",
    "however , the opacity is large in the u - band and it is possible that the observed flux has been absorbed in this band along the line of sight .",
    "we thus do not take the brighter model predictions as necessarily inconsistent with the data . if extinction in _ u _ along the line of sight",
    "is not sufficient to put the model into agreement with observations , then we have to change the composition for those elements in the model that can influence mostly the _ u _ band .",
    "deviation from the observed light curves in _ g _ and _ r _ bands 2 months after the maximum may be caused by a more complicated structure of the envelope than we use in the models . we do not attempt to fit every detail of the light curves , since there are many numerical uncertainties .",
    "for example , switching to a more realistic velocity gradient in the expansion opacity calculations could affect fluxes in the bands with a large number of strong lines . moving to a 3d calculation",
    "would introduce a viewing angle dependence in the observed flux .",
    "we will discuss some uncertainties in the last section of this paper .",
    "study of the influence of model parameters on the details of the slsn light curves is very important for better understanding of the nature of these objects and useful in the modeling of any future slsne .",

    "_ the mass of the envelope has been changed by the variation of the envelope density within the given radius .",
    "the emission of the higher mass model n0 is produced by gas with higher density , and the model is thus brighter .",
    "the shock wave needs more time to pass through the denser envelope , so it lives longer and the light curve tail lasts longer until the shock reaches the edge of the envelope .",
    "_ explosion energy .",
    "_ the main effect of increasing the explosion energy is to shorten the light curve tail : the shock is stronger and passes through the envelope faster .",
    "one can also expect an increase of brightness for the more energetic model , but the envelope is essentially diffusive , the shock is deep inside the photospheric radius , and photons that come from the level of the photosphere are not much hotter than in the less energetic case .",

    "the second row plot on the right hand side of figure  [ pic:10gx_parameters ] compares the light curves for the cases of static and expanding detached shells ( models n7 and n6 ) .",

    "we compare different slopes @xmath17 in density distribution ( models n1 and n2 ) as well as monotonic and shell - like distribution ( models n4 and n8 ) . as we can see from the plots , variation in the density distribution can help to reproduce features of the observed light curves during the fading stage",

    "the maximum itself is a little brighter than for sn  2010gx .",
    "an additional and very important feature of ptf09cnd is that it was caught more than 50  days before maximum , so we have a well - documented rising part of the light curve for theoretical modeling .",
    "we have no other photometric data for ptf09cnd except for the ptf data , so we compare only the flux in _ r _ and _ b _ bands provided by ptf observations . in the plots for the observed magnitude vs. observed time , we have taken into account the redshift of ptf09cnd ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "there are two features of the ptf09cnd light curve that limit us most of all in choosing the composition of the envelope .",
    "the first one is the fact that maximum magnitudes in _",
    "r _ and _ b _ bands are very similar . the second is its long rising time .      for the models with massive envelopes , the rising time is determined by the diffusion time of the photons from the shock wave and by the movement of the photosphere to the outermost edge of the envelope .",
    "we have already seen in figures  [ fig : hydron0 ] and [ fig : hydrob0 ] of section  [ sec : hydroprofiles ] that the envelope is cool at early times .",
    "it is transparent for optical photons and the photosphere is deep in the innermost part of the envelope .",
    "however , the radiation dominated shock forms rather quickly .",
    "its radiation ionizes gas in the envelope , the envelope becomes opaque , and the photosphere moves to the outer layers . if the envelope is extended enough and the shock wave propagating through the envelope is strong enough , the photospheric radius can grow by a few orders of magnitude , which corresponds to the rising part of the light curve .",
    "time needed for this rise depends on the chemical composition of the envelope ( see figure  [ fig : opahe_co9 ] and explanation in section  [ sec : hydroprofiles ] ) .    in figure  [ pic:09cnd_composition ]",
    "we present the light curves for models b3 , b4 , and b5 , which do not satisfactorily fit the observations of ptf09cnd .",
    "they are just through - passage models on the way to constructing a successful model , but these models illustrate quite well the reasons of choosing chemical composition for the most successful models shown in figures  [ pic:2zrbobs_09cnd_b0b6 ] and  [ pic:3zrbobs_09cnd ] .",
    "the only difference between models b3 , b4 , and b5 is their chemical composition .",
    "all three models contain about 20  in total , and the explosion energy is @xmath44  ergs .",
    "we started from the model with c and o in equal proportion ( model b4 ; middle plot ) .",
    "this is also the standard proportion for the models from our paper @xcite .",
    "for this composition and mass , the light curve is too fast in the rising part , which is quite typical for a co mixture , and it is also too blue at maximum .",
    "the problem of short rising time can be solved with taking he instead of a co mixture ( left plot in figure  [ pic:09cnd_composition ] ) . in this case , the light curve rises to maximum in a suitable time , but it still remains too blue .",
    "changing the proportion between carbon and oxygen in favor of carbon , on the contrary , removes the blue excess , but preserves the short rising time ( right plot in figure  [ pic:09cnd_composition ] ) .",
    "since co models are more preferable from the observational point of view ( helium lines are not typically observed in slsn - i spectra ) , we have choosen the co model with an enhanced amount of c as the main model for ptf09cnd . in order to make the rise time longer",

    "the c to o ratio for the best model is @xmath47 .",
    "the light curves for this model are shown in figure  [ pic:2zrbobs_09cnd_b0b6 ] with solid lines .",
    "dashed lines in the plot demonstrate the light curves for the model b6 , which is identical to b0 in the structure , but different in the composition : its cs envelope contains about 25  he and 25  co mixture instead of almost 50  of pure co ( see section  [ sec : presn ] ) .",
    "the changes of the light curve are only minimal : it becomes a little wider with helium .",
    "this is quite natural , because we replace half of the well - absorptive material with an almost non - absorptive one ( see figure  [ fig : opahe_co9 ] ) , so the temperature rises more slowly , the gas remains transparent for longer time , the photosphere shifts outwards more slowly , and the light curve rises to its maximum also more slowly .    since the differences of the light curves for these two models are small , it is difficult to judge which amount of helium is more suitable for observational data from a photometric point of view only , unless helium becomes the most abundant element in the cs envelope and gas emission is not dominated by carbon , oxygen , and heavier elements .",

    "we have already seen in figure  [ pic:10gx_parameters ] that the envelope expansion made the light curve more narrow .",
    "here the situation is the same .",
    "the width of the light curve for model b0 with a static envelope ( solid line in figure  [ pic:3zrbobs_09cnd ] ) more or less corresponds to observations , while the fluxes from models b1 ( dashed line ) and b2 ( dashed - dotted line ) with expanding envelopes decline too fast .",
    "the integral expansion energy of the envelopes is not very high : @xmath49 and @xmath50  ergs for b1 and b2 , respectively .",
    "the velocity is distributed over the envelope so that the inner layers do not move at all , the velocity grows up toward the outer edge and has a maximum at the outer layers .",

    "_ rapidly expanding separated shell from pre - explosion .",
    "_ the pulsational pair - instability explosion mechanism results in a ( multi-)shell structure with the velocity gradient in the shell larger than we checked with our models ( see , for instance , the velocity distribution for a successful model of sn  2006gy in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the use of such a separated shell would solve two problems at once : the interacting region would remain inside the low velocity gas for a long time , that would provide a sufficient width of the light curve , while the broad spectral features would be formed in the outermost high - velocity layers .",
    "the main difference of the latter model from our models b1 and b2 must be in the velocity distribution .",
    "inner parts of the envelope must have zero or very low velocity up to a rather large radius .",
    "velocity must start growing far from the contact discontinuity , and the velocity gradient must be so high that the outermost layers would expand with the velocity , which would correspond to the observations , of about 10,000  km  s@xmath39 .",

    "must be combined with detailed modeling of some lines , which show p  cyg profiles .",
    "the correct computation of ionization and excitation of the rapidly expanding region requires the nlte approach , which is beyond the scope of the current paper .",
    "we hope to pursue this subject in the future .    _ radioactive material .",
    "_ another solution of the problem of getting both wide light curve and wide spectral lines from high - velocity gas is adding some amount of radioactive material in the slsn - i model .",
    "if @xmath6ni  is generated during the explosion inside an extended envelope , then the maximum of the light curve can be explained by the interaction , while the tail is defined by the radioactive decay of @xmath6nito @xmath6coto @xmath6fe , and the width of the light curve does not depend on the expansion of the envelope .",
    "bolometric light curves are easier for theoretical modeling than colored ones , since less uncertainties are involved in the opacity calculation .",
    "observers , on the contrary , must make some theoretical assumptions to derive a bolometric light curve from their observations , which typically span only a limited wavelength range .",
    "therefore , a comparison of observational and theoretical light curves can not be fully consistent : a given discrepancy might indicate a problem converting the observations to bolometric values instead of indicating a problem with the theoretical model .",
    "this is why we do not compare the numerically calculated bolometric light curves with the observations , but demonstrate them alone .",
    "we have integrated the calculated spectra ( 1   50  000   ) to yield bolometric light curves for the models n0 and b0 .",
    "they are shown with black lines in figure  [ pic : lbol ] : left plot is for the model n0 , right plot for b0 . with green solid lines , we plot `` quasi - bolometric '' light curves , which include integral flux in the wavelength range of _ ubvri _ bands ( 3250     8900   )",
    "this is the range where observational flux can be directly obtained for the local sne without applying any additional theoretical assumption about energy distribution in the sn spectrum .    since all slsne observed so far",
    "are noticeably red - shifted , their observations correspond to somewhat bluer rest frame emission .",
    "we have checked the typical rest frame spectral range and found that slsn spectra are known roughly in the range of 2300     8000   . the flux for models n0 and b0 integrated in this range is shown with the green dotted lines .",
    "the lines of other colors show the remaining modeled flux , which was not included in the quasi - bolometric range : the blue lines show the integrated flux bluer than the short wavelength edge of the observable interval discussed above , while the red lines show the flux redder than the long wavelength limit .",
    "the figure confirms that the very massive model b0 is much more diffusive around the light curve maximum : the luminosity in the extremal uv range is very close to the `` visible '' ( _ ubvri _ ) value , especially when we take into account the typical redshift of slsne and shift a part of the uv flux into the observable range ( dotted lines ) . in the latter case ,",
    "the observers are able to measure almost all emission from slsn .",
    "a large part of the emission from less diffusive slsne with narrower light curves still remains in the uv range near maximum light .",
    "even when the observed range is shifted to the blue in accordance with the typical sn redshift , more than half of the emission still remains in the extreme uv range and is unobservable from the ground near the light curve maximum .",
    "this means that there is a good chance to observe such slsne at even higher redshifts . only after about 40 days after the explosion ( about 20 days after maximum light )",
    ", when the shock wave becomes weaker and the temperature within the envelope - ejecta system falls down ( see figure  [ fig : hydron0 ] ) , does the visible wavelength range carry most of the emitted radiation .",
    "an estimation of the eddington factors is rather crude in stella , and time delay effects are not taken into account .",
    "to check whether the radiation transfer and time delay effect could affect the light curve , we performed a simulation for one of the models for ptf09cnd using the rada code @xcite . in comparison to stella ,",
    "rada calculates exact eddington factors at each time step and takes into account time delay effects more accurately .",
    "the bolometric light curve ( figure  [ pic : lbolstellarada ] ) does not reveal significant deviations from stella results up to 100  days after an explosion , until the system becomes more transparent and the shock becomes directly visible .",
    "deviations grow only when the slsn luminosity weakens by 1.5 orders of magnitude , a phase when typical slsne become almost unobservable .",
    "this means that more accurate modeling of the radiation transfer is not so important for similar models at least near the stage of the maximum light , while the envelope is essentially optically thick .",
    "we have shown in sections  [ sec : res10gx ] and [ sec:09cnd ] that the broad band light curves of sn  2010gx and ptf09cnd are all in good agreement with the interacting model with strongly different csm mass .",
    "an even more difficult problem is to get a good fit to the slsn spectra .",
    "stella typically uses a grid of only 100 frequency bins , so we are not able to reproduce all spectral details .",
    "lines are all averaged within the bins of some hundred angstrm width .",
    "so we can compare the observed spectra only with stella s crude spectral - energy distribution .",
    "figure  [ fig : sp10gx_09cnd ] provides this comparison .",
    "time evolution of the spectra for our best models n0 and b0 are shown in figure  [ fig : animspn0b0 ] .",
    "along with the fast photometric evolution of sn 2010gx comes relatively fast spectroscopic evolution .",
    "we compare a spectrum of sn  2010gx from @xcite with the age estimated as @xmath51 days after maximum with our modeled spectrum in figure  [ fig : sp10gx_09cnd ] .",
    "we find the best fit to this spectrum for model n0 at @xmath52 days after the maximum in the _ b _ band . at @xmath51 days ,",
    "the model spectrum was a bit too hot : the uv emission exceeds the observations .",
    "nevertheless , we find the 5-day phase difference to be negligible , especially when including the potential error in the observed date of maximum .",
    "thus , we consider the model and observed spectra to be in good agreement .",
    "our model calculation shows that the cut - off wavelength of the uv emission shifts rather fast during the evolution of the object after the maximum light ( figure  [ fig : animspn0b0 ] ) .",
    "comparison of a few observed and modeled spectra within a couple of weeks during the fading phase would be very useful for examining a model in the future .",
    "ptf09cnd has a wide light curve and the observers were able to get its spectrum well before the maximum .",
    "the spectrum shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig : sp10gx_09cnd ] was taken 20 days before maximum @xcite . at this stage ,",
    "the emitting gas is much hotter than that from the fading stage on the left panel and the drop - off wavelength is still out of the measured range .",
    "however , the slopes of the observed and model b0 spectra at the same age , @xmath53 days , coincide well .",
    "the good agreement in observed and modeled spectra supports the ejecta - csm interaction as an explanation for the wide range of non - hydrogen slsne .",
    "the aim of the current work is to test the role of shock interaction in producing light in the non - hydrogen cs envelopes around slsne - i and to see if the bulk of slsne - i can originate from this kind of system .",
    "our calculations indicate that if this envelope structure forms in nature , then it can indeed give rise to extremely bright and long - lived supernova light curves .",
    "there have been no detailed numerical simulations of the broad band light curves of slsne - i except for @xcite and @xcite . in the current paper , we succeeded in reproducing the narrow light curves of slsne - i as well as the broad ones .",
    "we got the correct duration of the light curves and correct fluxes in different bands .",
    "we also get very good agreement in reproducing continuum spectral - energy distributions for both cases .",
    "we show that the details of the light curves over the fading stage depend on the structure of the cs envelope .",
    "both sn  2010gx and ptf09cnd can be explained with moderate explosion energies @xmath0  ergs for an envelope extending up to @xmath54 cm with an almost flat density profile .",
    "energetics is one of the main advantages of the interacting mechanism of slsne compared to pair - instability or magnetar - powered slsne : the shock wave is very effective in producing thermal energy , so models with csm require explosion energies only a little higher than that of `` normal '' sne , while in all other mechanisms the energetics must be at least an order of magnitude higher than normal",
    ".    the mass of the surrounding envelope must be high enough for the effective transformation of kinetic energy of the ejecta into observed light .",
    "the main difference between models with narrow and broad light curves is their masses .",
    "models for sn  2010gx require 5 to 10  of carbon and oxygen in the envelope , which is right in line with the ejected masses expected for pre - explosion from the pulsational pair instability mechanism , though the possibility of loosing all hydrogen and even helium long before the explosion is controversial . a much more massive c+o envelope with @xmath55 55",
    "is needed to reproduce the broad band light curves of ptf09cnd .",
    "there are predictions , however , for stars in the last stages of stellar evolution with the requisite large helium and carbon - oxygen core masses @xcite .",
    "models with an extended envelope contiguous to the ejecta fit sn  2010gx and ptf09cnd better , but a detached shell or another feature in the envelope s density distribution might also be a good possibility to reproduce features on the light curve for some other slsne .",
    "models with detached shells can change the light curve shape during the fading stage .",
    "we encounter two kinds of problems in simulating slsne with the shock interaction mechanism , physical and numerical , which limit either the applicability of the model to the observed slsne or the applicability of the numerical code to the problem .",
    "_ mass of hydrogen - poor envelope .",
    "_ one of the obvious physical limitations of the interaction models is provided by the duration of the light curve tail .",

    "for example , the model b0 for ptf09cnd contains almost 50  of c and o in the extended envelope .",
    "if slsne - i with longer light curve tails are discovered , the interaction scenario would require even higher envelope masses , which may not be very realistic .",
    "the solution of the problem may require including an appreciable amount of radioactive material to the shock interaction model .",
    "pure pair instability sn models are too diffusive and have a rise time to maximum that is too long @xcite , though the amount of @xmath6ni  they contain can easily explain the slsne - i tails .",
    "the shock interaction models can help to solve the problem of rising time @xcite .",
    "thus , the combined models of shock plus radioactivity may provide the best solution for the problem .",
    "then the shock will be responsible for the maximum of the light curve , while the radioactivity will determine the behavior of the tail",
    ". this may be most relevant to slsne with long tails of constant decline .",
    "_ high velocities . _ the combined model ( radioactivity plus interaction ) can also help to explain the high velocities observed in slsne - i .",
    "another type of shock interaction supernovae , sne  iin , clearly demonstrates narrow emission lines produced in the shells .",
    "not so in slsne - i : narrow circumstellar lines are not seen @xcite .",
    "there is no easily excited hydrogen in this type of sne , and the most abundant elements ( probably , carbon and oxygen ) should present as c  ii and o  ii ions in the envelope .",
    "these ions do not have many strong lines in visible light .",
    "it is not easy to identify c and o lines in the photospheric stage in sne  i @xcite , and for slsne they should be excited even in the absence of the radioactive material .",
    "thus , one has to look for weak lines in noisy spectra .",
    "this problem certainly deserves further investigation to account for different conditions of ionization / excitation of shells under the shock radiation .",
    "shock interaction models with fast expansion of the envelope produce rather narrow light curves . for the slsne - i with the broadest light curves",
    "we again encounter the problem that , under the assumption of an expanding cs envelope , extremely high envelope masses are required to fit the light curves .",
    "computation of the shock - interacting models on a fine grid is often time consuming . in some cases , semianalytic models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "currently , we see discrepancies in some parameters of our models with the models from @xcite for the same slsne .",
    "the fits to slsn fluxes in individual filters are not yet perfect in our simulations .",
    "this is natural : we have taken quite arbitrary and primitive chemical compositions , density distributions , etc .",

    "moreover , it is negative on the shock front , with @xmath58 during several months , while the shock passes through the envelope . the influence of the expansion on the opacity in this region must be stronger than in the isotropic case .",

    "the attempts on multi - d treatment of sn ejecta evolution are rather old @xcite , more recent results and references may be found in @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite for the case of sn  2006gy , but without real treatment of radiative transfer .",

    "for example , @xcite are successful in reproducing the spectra of sn  1994w in a set of atmospheric models , though their method is applicable only to monotonic velocity structures , not to shocked shells .",
    "moreover , one should be cautioned about the relation of the `` photospheric '' radius found by @xcite , which shrinks , and the radius of the shocked shell in sne  iin , which grows . this has already been explained by @xcite .        in our numerical modeling , we take into account a lot of physical processes and examine their effects on the light curves . to demonstrate that this would be a challenging task in the analytical approach , we calculated the light curves for sn  2010gx by adopting the same model parameters as in the analytical model by @xcite for sn  2010gx in the interaction scenario : @xmath60 , @xmath61  cm , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64  ergs , @xmath65  cm .",
    "@xcite provided the results for two models of the interaction scenario with a different density distribution in the cs envelope .",
    "we chose the model with @xmath66 because it is more similar to the density distribution in our models .",
    "the results of our numerical run of the model with the parameters listed above are shown by the dashed lines ( chat13 ) in figure  [ pic : analyt ] .",
    "for comparison , the light curves for our model n0 , which are in good agreement with broad - band fluxes from sn  2010gx , are shown by the solid curves ( sor16 ) .",
    "our numerical light curves chat13 are noticeably different from the analytic model by @xcite .",
    "the light curves chat13 are less luminous and much shorter than the analytical formula predicts ( figure  4 of @xcite ) .",
    "most probably , the difference in brightness is explained by an order of magnitude smaller radius of the sc envelope in chat13 model , while the difference in the duration is due to a smaller diffusion time as a consequence of a smaller cs envelope mass .",
    "such a difference in light curves is very similar to that found in the comparison between the analytic and numerical models for type ii slsn 2006gy ( figure  14 of @xcite ) .",
    "further details will be presented in the forthcoming paper .",
    "our best models for sn  2010gx and ptf09cnd require circumstellar envelopes of 5 to 50  , which consist of 7090% carbon and 3010% oxygen and must be formed before the explosion .",
    "stellar evolution theory tells us that it is difficult to create a star with almost all helium lost well before the sn explosion and such a huge amount of almost pure carbon and oxygen lost a few months before the explosion .",
    "our modeling excludes the possibility of a purely helium cs envelope because it demonstrates wrong colors near the maximum . in order to make a more evolutionary plausible model",
    ", we implemented one chemically non - uniform model for ptf09cnd : the cs envelope of model b6 consists of 25  helium , 22  carbon , and 3  oxygen , while the ejecta is mostly co. this model confirmed our prediction that unless helium is overwhelmingly abundant , the calculated light curve is changed only slightly .",
    "a larger amount of helium may reduce the envelope mass needed to reproduce the slow rise time of the slsn , because the rise time is longer for a pure helium envelope of the same mass .",
    "on the other hand , the pure helium envelope makes the sn model bluer than the observed sn near maximum , as seen in model b3 for ptf09cnd ( figure  [ pic:09cnd_composition ] ) .",
    "thus , more detailed work related to the dependence of the light curve shape on the chemical composition is still necessary .    until recently",
    ", there was no sign of helium in slsn - i spectra , but the observations of @xcite changed the situation .",
    "not only helium , but even hydrogen is observed in the late ( about a year after the explosion ) specta of iptf13ehe and some other slsne - i , which means that the cs envelope in the interacting scenario must be non - homogeneous , and its outermost layers contain he and h. such systems are easier to understand from the point of view of stellar evolution .",
    "this clearly demonstrates that chemically uniform models from our current work are a bit idealized . in the future we plan to investigate more complicated kinds of models with stratified co",
    " he  h layers as well as models with different mixtures of co@xmath24he .",
    "both of them look more natural than the current models , which are still very good as a first approach to numerical modeling of slsne - i in the interaction scenario .",
    "our first approach to the mixed co@xmath24he models shows that the light curve is not much affected unless the amount of helium would become sufficiently large , because the rising time must be determined by a more opaque element .",
    "only colors are changed a little .",
    "here we agree with the conclusion of @xcite that the total helium mass of stripped envelope sne is difficult to be measured from simple light curve modeling .",
    "future research must answer two main question regarding the mixed models : put more definite upper limit to the mass fraction of helium in the cs envelopes and estimate how much cs envelope mass can be reduced for the most abundant he models .",
    "the stratified models can possibly provide us with some interesting features on the light curve when the photospheric radius would stumble upon the borders between different element layers .",
    "spectroscopically , models with and without helium can also look very similar .",
    "for example , @xcite argue that he features can easily be hidden in the spectra .",
    "they described a model for type ic supernova with 30% surface helium mass fraction , and found that he i lines were always absent in the visible light .",
    "there is no source of the excitation of helium if radioactive material is not mixed toward the surface .",
    "only a weak 10 830    line is present . in our models , we normally have a rather low color temperature ( see figure  [ fig : animspn0b0 ] ) .",
    "for early times , it may reach @xmath67  k , so some thermal excitation of he may be expected as in b - stars , but the presence of large amounts of c may hide it , like in @xcite .",

    "this is again similar to our models of the dense cs envelope .",
    "the difference is in the mass involved in the interaction : they estimate that the total amount of interacting gas is about 3  , while we need 50  for our most massive model .",
    "the estimations of the parameters of the h- and he - poor envelope around sn  2010 mb by  @xcite are in agreement with the masses and compositions of some models of pulsational pair - instability sne @xcite",
    ".      the main question , which remains unclear , is the origin of the extended and dense cs envelope , either carbon - oxygen , helium , or a mixture of both .",
    "what is the time scale of the formation of the envelope ? how far can the envelope extend ? what is the density profile and the temperature of matter before the core explosion ?",
    "these questions deserve further investigation .",
    "the theory of stellar evolution suggests several possible scenarios , which can result in such a system with a cs envelope .",
    "one of them is an explosion through the pulsational pair - instability mechanism as a means to form a detached cs shell .",
    "for instance , in the models of @xcite ejected masses and energies of preexplosions for the stars with helium core masses of about 50  are similar to those needed to form the cs envelope with the parameters we use in our calculations .",
    "evolutionary calculations of helium cores of the most massive stars in @xcite also lead to the loss of several tens of solar masses of the gas before the final explosion . a major part of the lost material is helium and oxygen in their calculation .",
    "the fact that slsne - i are typically observed in low - metallicity , star - forming galaxies favors the explosion of stars with very high initial masses , which are able to retain a large part of their mass during the evolution and loose a large amount of mass just before the explosion .",
    "evolutionary calculations of very massive stars ( a few hundreds of solar masses ) of different metallicities show that most of the hydrogen burns into helium during the main sequence evolution of such stars , before the stage of an intensive mass loss @xcite .",
    "this happens due to convective cores of such stars that extend up to outer layers of stars . in the very later phase of evolution , helium shell burning produces a substantial amount of carbon ( more than oxygen ) in the helium shell .",
    "in addition , the rotation of a star forms a meridional circulation , which also helps most of the hydrogen burn into helium ( and , possibly , some part of helium into c@xmath24o ) even at the surface .",
    "the combination of the formation of such a hydrogen - poor star with a powerful blowout from it as a wind in the latest stages of evolution , or with the ejection due to the pulsational pair - instability , can lead to the formation of a system required in this paper as an initial model for slsn - i .",
    "the pulsational pair - instability mechanism is more preferable because the explosive processes can more easily produce very high velocities of the cs envelope , of the order of 10,000  km / s , observed in the slsn - i spectra .",
    "these velocities are too high to have originated from a wind",
    ".    one can also speculate about the merger ( or even multiple mergers ) of a co core from an evolved wr star with another hydrogen - deficient star , like a neutron star , a white dwarf , or another wr star @xcite .",
    "a rich variety of probable binary pre - slsn evolution is considered in @xcite .",
    "these events are very probable in close binary systems and in the central regions of young stellar clusters ( like the ejection of the common envelope in pre - sn  ia binaries considered by @xcite ) .",
    "the merging can lead to a moderate explosion with energy of a few percent of @xmath23  ergs which forms a relatively large cloud of matter around the combined core .",
    "the size of this envelope can be enough to provide a long - living shock wave when the central core collapses within a few years after the merger .",
    "such an extended envelope would produce a very bright supernova , though the envelope expansion velocity would doubtfully be high enough .",
    "more detailed numerical calculations of merging systems are needed .    analyzing all the possibilities above",
    ", we can not choose one of them with certainty .",
    "however , with the current state of knowledge , the most plausible progenitor of slsne - i is a very massive star ( maybe with fast rotation ) , in which all of the hydrogen and a large part of the helium is burned out or expelled ( or lost ) during presupernova evolution and which is still massive enough to pass through the pulsational pair - instability stage .",
    "this scenario can explain both chemical composition and high envelope velocities in the interaction model for slsn .",
    "we conclude that , provided the formation of rather dense and extended circumstellar envelopes by any pre - sn scenario , extremely powerful events , like sn  2010gx and ptf09cnd , can be explained with moderate explosion energies without invoking any radioactive material . in principle , this mechanism can be the same for all slsne - i observed so far .",
    "sb is thankful to victor utrobin and to takashi moriya for discussions on bright sn  i spectra , light curves , and on numerical modeling of radiation dominated shocks with our code stella .",
    "kn and at would like to thank raphael hirschi for a discussion on the evolution of very massive stars and the formation of dense csm during his stay at kavli ipmu as an affiliate member .",
