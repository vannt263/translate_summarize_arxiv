    "in this paper we consider a simple tool to extract complex systems from a family of chaotic discrete dynamical system .",
    "we will employ a technique  _ memory _ based rule analysis @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , of using past history of a system to construct its present state and to manipulate its future .",
    "we focus on one - dimensional ca .",
    "ca are well known computational substrates for studying emergent collective behaviour , complexity , randomness and interaction between order and chaos .",
    "a number of efforts have been made to classify ca functions on their space - time dynamics and to predict behaviour of any given function .",
    "examples include mechanical computation , @xmath0 and @xmath1-parameters , mean field theory , differential equations and number conserving features .",
    "we aim to base ca classification on their behaviour in a historical mode , i.e. as _ ca with memory _ @xcite .",
    "we study elementary ca ( eca ) where each function evaluates a central cell with their two neighbourhoods ( left and right ) and every cell takes a value of its binary alphabet .",
    "eca are introduced and extensively studied by @xcite , @xcite . in eca",
    "there is a set of functions determining global chaotic behaviour where global configurations are chaotic , many configurations have many ancestors , and attractors are dense @xcite .",
    "eca is a one - dimensional array of finite automata , each automaton takes two states and updates its state in discrete time depending on its own state and states of its two closest neighbours , all cells update their state synchronously .",
    "a general classification of eca was introduced in @xcite , as follows :    class i. ca evolving to a homogeneous state .",
    "ca evolving periodically .",
    "class iii .",
    "ca evolving chaotically .",
    "include all previous cases , as well known as class of _ complex rules_.    in this classification class iv is of particular interest because the rules of the class exhibit non - trivial behaviour with rich diversity of patterns emerging and non - trivial interactions between travelling localizations , or gliders , e.g. eca rule 54 @xcite .",
    "in present paper we aim to transform a chaotic evolution rule to a complex system by using memory    chaotic eca @xmath2 complex eca    and derive a new classes of ca functions with historic evolution .",
    "we believe that by employing historic evolution we are able to explore hidden properties of chaotic systems , and select chaotic rules with homogeneous dynamics .",
    "one - dimensional ca is represented by an array of _ cells _",
    "@xmath3 where @xmath4 ( integer set ) and each @xmath5 takes a value from a finite alphabet @xmath6 .",
    "thus , a sequence of cells \\{@xmath3 } of finite length @xmath7 represents a string or _ global configuration _",
    "@xmath8 on @xmath6 .",
    "this way , the set of finite configurations will be represented as @xmath9 . an evolution is represented by a sequence of configurations @xmath10 given by the mapping @xmath11 ; thus their global relation is following    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is time steps and every global state of @xmath8 is defined by a sequence of cell states .",
    "also the cell states in configuration @xmath14 are updated at the next configuration @xmath15 simultaneously by a local function @xmath16 as follows    @xmath17    following @xcite , @xcite one can represents any ca with two parameters @xmath18 . where @xmath19 is a number of states , and",
    "@xmath20 is a radius of neighbourhood .",
    "thus eca are defined by parameters @xmath21 .",
    "there are @xmath9 different neighbourhoods ( where @xmath22 ) and @xmath23 different evolution rules .    in computer experiments we are using automata with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "conventional cellular automata are ahistoric ( memoryless )",
    ". a new state of a cell depends on the neighbourhood configuration solely at the preceding time step of @xmath16 ( see eq .  [ localfunction ] ) .",
    "ca with _ memory _ extends standard framework of ca by allowing every cell @xmath3 to remember some period of its previous evolution @xcite .",
    "thus to implement a memory we design a memory function @xmath24 , as follows :    @xmath25    such that @xmath26 determines the degree of memory backwards and each cell @xmath27 is a state function of the series of states of the cell @xmath3 with memory up to time - step . to execute the evolution we apply the original rule as follows :    @xmath28    in ca with memory ,",
    "while the mapping @xmath16 remains unaltered , historic memory of all past iterations is retained by featuring each cell as a summary of its past states from @xmath24 . therefore cells _",
    "canalize _ memory to the map @xmath16 .        for example ,",
    "let us consider memory function @xmath24 as a _ majority memory _ :",
    "@xmath29    where in case of a tie given by @xmath30 in @xmath24 , we shall take the last value @xmath3 .",
    "so @xmath31 represents the classic majority function for three variables @xcite , hence we have :    @xmath32    on cells @xmath33 and define a temporal ring before calculating the next global configuration @xmath8 .",
    "the representation of a eca with memory @xcite is given as follows :    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is a decimal notation of a particular eca rule and @xmath36 the kind of memory given with a specific value of @xmath37 .",
    "thus the majority memory ( @xmath38 ) working in eca rule 86 checking tree cells ( @xmath39 ) of history is simply denoted as : @xmath40 .",
    "figure  [ memevol ] depicts in detail the memory effect working on eca .",
    "note that memory is a simple function but its global behaviour @xmath41 can be predicted from its local function @xmath24 and @xmath16 .",
    "mean field theory is a proven technique for discovering general statistical properties of ca without analyzing evolution spaces of individual rules @xcite .",
    "the method assumes that elements of the set of states @xmath6 are independent , uncorrelated between each other in the rule s evolution space @xmath16 .",
    "therefore we can study probabilities of states in neighbourhood in terms of probability of a single state ( the state in which the neighbourhood evolves ) , thus probability of a neighbourhood is the product of the probabilities of each cell in the neighbourhood .    in this way",
    ", it was proposed to explain wolfram s classes by a mixture of probability theory and de bruijn diagrams in @xcite , resulting in a classification based on mean field theory curve :    class i : monotonic , entirely on one side of diagonal ;    class ii : horizontal tangency , never reaches diagonal ;    class iv : horizontal plus diagonal tangency , no crossing ;    class iii : no tangencies , curve crosses diagonal .",
    "thus for one dimension all cell neighbourhoods must be considered as :    @xmath42    such that @xmath43 is a number of relations from neighbourhoods and @xmath44 represent of cells @xmath45 . thus @xmath7 represents the number of cells in neighborhood , @xmath46 indicates how often state one occurs in the neighborhood , @xmath47 shows how often state zero occurs in the neighborhood , @xmath48 is a probability of cell being in state one , @xmath49 is a probability of cell being in state zero ( such that @xmath50 ) .",
    "let us consider two cases of classic eca with chaotic behaviour to demonstrate our results : the evolution rules 86 and 101 .",
    "we need to provide their mean filed approximation to verify that both function have a chaotic global behaviour before selecting the memory .",
    "the local rule @xmath16 corresponding to rule 86 is following :    @xmath51    initially @xmath52 has produces states zero and one with the same probability .",
    "there is an equilibrium of states in @xmath41 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath52 determines a surjective correspondence and therefore every configuration has at least one ancestor and no garden of eden configurations [ amoroso & cooper , 1970 ] .",
    "of course this rule is the reflection of well - known eca rule 30 @xcite .",
    "the local function for rule 101 is following :    @xmath53    in this case , @xmath54 has the same probability as @xmath52 to produce states one and zero .",
    "however @xmath54 is not a surjective rule and therefore has the garden of eden configurations , i.e. , not all configurations have ancestors .    to classify global behaviour properly of @xmath52 and @xmath54",
    "we should calculate their mean field polynomials .",
    "mean field polynomial for @xmath52 is :    @xmath55    and for @xmath54 we have :    @xmath56    the polynomial for @xmath52 satisfies the mean field classification ( sect .  3 ) . where rules in ca class iii do not have tangencies and therefore the curve crosses the identity .",
    "consequently , @xmath52 evolves with a chaotic global behaviour ( see fig .  [ meanfield](a ) ) .",
    "this mean field polynomial has an stable fixed point when eq .",
    "[ eqr86 ] is @xmath57 .",
    "this value relate the existence of densities where the population of cells in state one is preserved with few changes .",
    "also such fixed point confirm its initial probability since @xmath52 .",
    "of course , if there are extreme densities of zeros and ones then next time the configuration will be filled of states zeros only , a homogeneous global state",
    ".    mean field curve for @xmath54 ( see fig .",
    "[ meanfield](b ) ) presents another characteristic .",
    "again the curve does not cross the identity and its global behaviour @xmath41 should then be chaotic .",
    "its stable fixed point @xmath57 relates to the initial probability estimated since @xmath54 .",
    "the curve displays what would happen if some initial configuration @xmath58 is dominated by state one , at the next step will be dominated by states zero and therefore this behaviour should repeat periodically .",
    "such phenomenon also is balanced with its 50% of density to each step .    finally fig .",
    "[ chaoseca ] displays two evolutions with typical chaotic behaviour in eca .",
    "first evolution ( a ) displays the chaotic global evolution of @xmath52 since a random initial condition with a 50% of density .",
    "that confirm an evolution without some order or pattern defined .",
    "second evolution ( b ) displays the chaotic global behaviour for @xmath54 with the same parameters .",
    "now we will select a kind of memory and uncover `` hidden '' properties of chaotic eca s .",
    "filters selected in ca are a useful tool for understand `` hidden '' properties of ca .",
    "this tool was amply developed by wuensche in a context of automatic classification of ca .",
    "the filters were derived from mechanical computation techniques @xcite and analysis of cell - state frequencies @xcite .",
    "others derivations deducing filters relate as tiling , were reported for eca rule 110 @xcite , and rule 54 @xcite .",
    "however in general such filters are not widely exploited in ca studies .",
    "we consider the tile representation to identify filters as block of cells in one or two dimensions .",
    "we explain each tile filtering @xmath52 and @xmath54 in the sec .",
    "4.3 .",
    "firstly we should consider a kind of memory , in this case the majority memory @xmath31 ( see eq .  [ eq - majmem ] ) and then a value for @xmath37 .",
    "this value represents the number of cells backward to consider in the memory ( as we saw in sec .",
    "2.2 ) .    implementing the majority memory @xmath31 we can select some eca and experimentally explore its effect .",
    "figures  [ majmem86 ] and  [ majmem101 ] show outcomes of selecting memory @xmath37 working on @xmath52 and @xmath54 respectively .",
    "the result is a new family of eca but now with majority memory , they are the rules : @xmath59 , and @xmath60 .    as a characteristic while the memory is working on @xmath61 and @xmath62 a periodic background was more evident and it can be represented as a tile .",
    "these filters work as well on the original rules @xmath16 , see fig .",
    "[ majmem86 ] and  [ majmem101 ] .",
    "the memory effect produces an emergency of patterns .",
    "the patterns interact quickly ( in time - scale of ca development ) with each other .",
    "in fact , for @xmath61 and some values of @xmath37 the original behaviour changes its dynamics dramatically .",
    "following our previous findings @xcite , in press ] we consider only even values that offer better global dynamics .",
    "thus the new rule @xmath63 displays particles travelling in different velocities on a periodic background ( see fig .",
    "[ majmem86 ] ) .",
    "the second case @xmath62 displays more attractive result .",
    "these three rules support stationary and mobile particles , travelling and colliding , some collisions can be interpreted as solitonic reaction @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ majmem101 ] ) .    also on all evolutions a filter was selected to clarify evolutions and patterns .",
    "filters really are useful to recognize periodic dominant patterns of objects moving into such local universes .",
    "the first two - dimensional tile working in @xmath61 is represented as @xmath64 .",
    "also this tile works on the original evolution rule as shows the fig .",
    "[ majmem86 ] .",
    "tile reported for @xmath62 is determined for the two - dimensional tile @xmath65 .",
    "so this filter works on the original evolution rule as well as shows the fig .",
    "[ majmem101 ] .",
    "the effect of memory producing new evolution rules is preserved in some way .",
    "initially the existence of a filter that can evolve on all different function , that is not rare because the memory only read the history and process the new generation with the original rule .",
    "patterns as particles and non - trivial behaviour emerging in these new ca with memory @xmath61 and @xmath62 , naturally conduce to well - know problems as self - organization .",
    "emerging and living in @xmath66.,width=336 ]    considering the evolution rule @xmath66 , we have done a classification of particles in this local universe ( see fig .",
    "[ particles ] ) .",
    "the universe is not bigger compared with other complex rules .",
    "however that all particles in @xmath66 can be produced from other particles in binary collisions . such self - organization by structure formation @xcite is demonstrated in the following set of reactions between particles :    @xmath67    such that @xmath68 and @xmath69@xmath70 .",
    "figure  [ selforganizationr101 ] presents the set of reactions necessary to produce every particle :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 .",

    "ca evolution is filtered.,width=336 ]    of course , they are not all possibilities to get every particle and a organization of several particles could be produce even more complex behaviour imitating physical , biological , chemical or computational phenomena : wave propagation , reaction - diffusion , morphogenesis , particle collision , fluid - dynamics , ( tissue ) grown , pattern formation , self - reproduction , self - assembly , artificial life , synthetic constructions ( engineering ) , tessellation , differential equations , soliton solutions , formal languages , or unconventional computing @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .      .",
    "these patterns exhibit unlimited growth.,width=268 ]        figure  [ streamparticlesr86 ] shows the evolution of ca from a single cell in state 1 , the automaton is governed by rule @xmath63 .",
    "a fuse pattern is organized by stream of gliders ( left ) emitted periodically every 62 steps and a fixed periodic pattern ( right ) growing with a velocity of @xmath77 .",
    "the above examples of ca with memory are just two simple cases showing the memory effect on traditional chaotic functions .",
    "another cases were developed for the eca rules 30 and 126 in @xcite .",
    "we can employ the particles codification to represent solutions of some basic computing functions .",
    "let us consider the rule @xmath63 .",
    "we want to implement a simple substitution function addtohead working on two strings @xmath78 and @xmath79 , where @xmath80 .",
    "for example , if @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 then the addtohead(@xmath84 ) will yield : @xmath85 ( see schematic diagram of fig .  [ substitutiondiagram ] ) .    to implement such function in @xmath63 we must represent every data ` quantum ' as a particle .",
    "gliders @xmath86 and @xmath87 are coded to reproduce a soliton reaction . , because eca rule 86 is the reflection of rule 30 , and consequently their gliders emerging with memory can be coded in a similar way @xcite . ]",
    "another problem is synchronize several gliders and obtain the same result with multiple collisions .",
    "the codification is not sophisticated however a systematic analysis of reactions is required .",
    "we known than a periodic gap and one fixed phase between particles is sufficient to reproduce the addtohead function for any string @xmath88 .",
    "to head of the list @xmath89.,width=192 ]    figure  [ substitution ] shows fragments of evolutions of @xmath63 from an initial condition coded by gliders , representing the string @xmath90 . using function addtohead we produce the final string @xmath91 after 6,888 generations .",
    "the first snapshot in fig .  [ substitution ] shows its initial configuration and the first 400 steps , the middle snapshot mainly presents how the string @xmath92 across the string @xmath93 preserving the information ( soliton reaction ) , and the third snapshot shows the final global configuration so given the string @xmath94 processed in parallel with @xmath63 .",
    "we have demonstrated that elementary cellular automata ( eca ) with memory offer a powerful approach to discovering complex dynamics based on particles and non - trivial reactions between the particles .",
    "such problem has been substantiated by a number of different techniques , e.g. number - conservation @xcite , @xcite , exhaustive search @xcite , tiling @xcite , @xcite , de bruijn diagrams @xcite , @xmath1-parameter @xcite , genetic algorithms @xcite , mean field theory @xcite or from a differential equations point view @xcite .",
    "thus the memory function @xmath24 offers a more easy way to get similar and , in some cases , more strong results reporting new complex rules in eca with memory .    we have enriched some classic chaotic eca rules with majority memory and demonstrated that by applying certain filtering procedures we can extract rich dynamics of travelling localizations . therefore , we can deduce a relation on chaotic systems decomposed in complex dynamics as a self - contained set .",
    "generally a relation of sets of complex dynamics can be self - contained describing @xmath41 as attractors , like a set diagram ( fig .",
    "[ classes ] @xcite ) .        this way , the most bigger set in fig .  [ classes ]",
    "` all orbits ' corresponds to complex dynamics and the ` unstable ' set represents the chaotic systems .",
    "indeed there is a number of properties between orbits and characteristics that can not be inferred directly .",
    "however the memory plays a role of a powerful tool to discover such properties .",
