    "one of the main issues of the ongoing heavy - ion program is the investigation of deconfined hadronic matter . despite asymptotic freedom of the strong interaction ,",
    "this quark - gluon plasma is characterized by a large coupling in the regimes of physical interest , so nonperturbative approaches are required to describe this many - particle system reliably .",
    "recently , within the framework of an equilibrium description of the qcd plasma , the calculation of thermodynamical quantities by resumming hard - thermal - loop ( htl ) propagators was proposed . in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "nonperturbative expressions were given for the thermodynamical potential which , however , are detracted from inconsistencies : the expressions do not reproduce , in the weak - coupling limit , the perturbative results at leading order @xmath1 and they are , with uncompensated medium - dependent divergences , not satisfactory from a formal point of view . these problems were claimed to be solved only in a fully resummed calculation . in ref .",
    "@xcite , instead , a consistent approximation of the entropy was derived from htl propagators .",
    "this approach in principle resolves the problem of a leading order thermodynamical resummation since , up to an integration constant , the thermodynamical potential can be reconstructed from the entropy @xcite .    nonetheless , a direct calculation of the thermodynamical potential , the quantity containing the full thermodynamical information , is instructive , in particular since an approach to derive macroscopic properties , which are sensitive to hard momenta , from htl propagators ( as a soft - momentum approximation ) is , a priori , far from obvious .",
    "on the other hand , being explicitly gauge independent and respecting for arbitrary momenta the fundamental sum rules resulting from the commutator relations , the htl propagators are a favorable basis for calculating physical quantities from approximate dressed green s functions , yielding ( mostly ) analytical nonperturbative results .",
    "these points are addressed in the present note where , starting from the luttinger - ward representation of the thermodynamical potential @xcite , the hot qed plasma is studied .",
    "this case is particularly simple to analyze but at the same time also representative for systems with an equal htl structure as , e.g. , the quark - gluon plasma at finite temperature and density .",
    "as an exact relation , the thermodynamical potential can be expressed in terms of fully dressed green s functions by the ( generalized ) luttinger - ward representation @xcite @xmath2 - \\tilde\\omega[s ] + \\phi[d , s ] \\ , .",

    "in particular , the loop expansion of @xmath0 can be truncated at a certain order , which is , in terms of the perturbative expansion in free green s functions , equivalent to a partial resummation avoiding the problem of double counting of diagrams .",

    "is violated since the traces are dominated by hard momenta .",
    "the resulting ambiguity is even of order @xmath36 , namely @xmath67 hence , the htl contribution to @xmath0 can not be obtained by naively replacing the leading loop quantities in @xmath33 , as given above , by their htl approximation .",
    "instead , the htl contribution @xmath68 can be conceived by analyzing how the @xmath36 discrepancy arises . denoting the photon momentum in 0.7 mm  by @xmath69 and the fermion momenta by @xmath70 , this diagram ( with bare propagators for the @xmath36 contribution )",
    "can be represented as a double integral - sum over an expression with a numerator @xmath71 . closing the external legs of the boson self - energy in the htl approximation amounts to neglecting the term @xmath72 in @xmath73 .",
    "tracing over the negative of the fermion htl self - energy , on the other hand , neglects one of the @xmath74 terms in @xmath73 .",
    "thus , all terms are accounted for twice in the sum over all three possibilities to approximate one of the momenta as soft .",
    "accordingly , the representation @xmath75 reproduces @xmath33 perturbatively to order @xmath36 .",

    ". moreover , the perturbative limit of the thermodynamical potential is reproduced by the representation ( [ omegastar ] ) . separating the free contributions , e.g. , for the boson part by @xmath77 , and using the expansion @xmath78 ,",
    "the leading order correction to the interaction - free limit @xmath79 is @xmath80 as in the htl calculations @xcite of the qcd entropy , the leading order term originates entirely from the behavior of the thermodynamically relevant excitations at the hard momentum scale @xmath16 , which _ a posteriori _ justifies the present approach .",
    "however , in contrast to the entropy calculations @xcite where the results are manifestly ultraviolet - finite , the cancelation of the thermal divergences is in the present approach directly related to the fact that the perturbative result is reproduced . it is emphasized that this aspect makes the representation ( [ omegastar ] ) of @xmath81 unique ; any linear combination , apart from ( [ phistar ] ) , of closed self - energy diagrams for the @xmath0-contribution would result in either uncompensated thermal divergences or an incorrect perturbative limit .",
    "the next - to - leading order term of the perturbative result @xmath82 , on the other hand , can not be expected to be reproduced in the present approximation : in an equivalent approach for the scalar @xmath83 theory , where the complete leading loop luttinger - ward resummation of the thermodynamical potential can be derived @xcite , the corresponding @xmath84 correction takes its correct value only after the resummation of the self - energy , while the expressions ( [ se - htl ] ) are calculated with bare propagators .",
    "accordingly , the contribution of order @xmath85 , which arises from the static longitudinal parts of ( [ omegastar ] ) , @xmath86 is found to underestimate the perturbative result @xmath87 by a factor of 1/4 . as observed in @xcite for qcd",
    ", the next - to - leading order term of @xmath88 agrees with the perturbative result but is overcompensated by the @xmath89 contribution , which is to be interpreted by a systematic next - to - leading order calculation .",
    "the generalized luttinger - ward representation of the thermodynamical potential is a suitable framework to derive consistently resummed approximations for relativistic gauge theories , with the propagators approximated by their htl contributions . while the formalism is particularly simple to analyze in the case of the hot qed plasma , which is exemplified here , the application to other systems ( including the qcd plasma ) with the same htl structure is evident . as a direct result of the htl approximation , the resummed thermodynamical potential ( [ omegastar ] ) is gauge independent .",
    "all medium - dependent divergences cancel , hence the approximation is explicitly renormalization - scale independent . the resummed expression ( [ omegastar ] ) enjoys the anticipated behavior of a nonperturbative approximation .",
    "as shown in figure 1 , it yields a smooth extrapolation to the large - coupling regime , where it is inclosed by the perturbative results which are known to fluctuate with increasing order . in the weak - coupling limit ,",
    "on the other hand , the perturbative result is recovered .",
    "this demonstrates that to leading order the resummed thermodynamical potential can entirely be expressed in terms of htl propagators .",
    "the applications of the formalism to the hot and dense quark - gluon plasma are straightforward and promising , in particular with regard to the suggestion @xcite to extrapolate finite - temperature lattice data to non - zero chemical potential .",
    "the reliability of the leading order htl resummation of the thermodynamical potential in the large coupling regime , however , remains to be justified by a systematic next - to - leading order calculation .",
