    "the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) is currently the most valuable tool to study the origin of the universe .",
    "this radiation was emitted @xmath0 years after the big  bang and is the most ancient electromagnetic radiation that we can observe .",
    "it offers us information about the conditions in which it was emitted , soon after the recombination of the atoms that made the universe transparent to photons .",
    "the most accepted theory of the early universe is the standard inflationary scenario .",
    "the cmb presents small temperature anisotropies . according to the standard model ,",
    "these anisotropies represent a homogeneous and isotropic gaussian random field on the celestial sphere . however , non - standard inflation ( bartolo et al . 2004 ) and topological defect models ( turok & spergel 1990 and durrer 1999 ) predict different non - gaussian features in the cmb sky .    the most precise all  sky measurement of the cmb is up to date the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap , bennett et al .",
    "the analysis of the wmap team did not find any evidence of deviations from gaussianity of the cosmological signal in the 1year data ( komatsu et al .",
    "nevertheless in the last years many scientists studied the gaussianity of these data and found non ",

    "also upcoming analyses with new tools , such as scalar statistics on the sphere , ( montesern et al . 2005 ) , or steerable filters , ( wiaux et al . 2005 ) may find some more non  gaussian features .",
    "in this paper we focus on the gaussianity studies provided by vielva et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and cruz et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , hereafter v04 and c05 .",
    "these are based on the spherical mexican hat wavelet ( smhw ) technique which allows us to perform a multiscale analysis and to localise the non ",
    "gaussian signatures . in v04",
    "an excess of kurtosis was detected convolving the data with the smhw at scales between @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the deviation from gaussianity presented an upper tail probability of 0.38% considering all the sky and 0.11% in the southern hemisphere , analysing both galactic hemispheres independently . performing an analysis of the spots",
    ", c05 found that this deviation was due exclusively to a cold spot at galactic coordinates ( @xmath3 ) , called _ the spot _ ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : spot ] ) . assuming the gaussian hypothesis , the upper tail probability of having such a spot at a wavelet scale of @xmath2 is 0.18% .",
    "these detections were confirmed by other papers , also based on wavelets .",
    "mukherjee & wang ( 2004 ) and mcewen et al .",
    "( 2005 ) recalculated the kurtosis analysis of v04 obtaining similar results .",
    "cayn , jin & treaster ( 2005 ) applied higher criticism statistics to maps in wavelet space .",
    "they detect a deviation from gaussianity , finding that some pixels of _ the spot _ are responsible for it .",
    "one of the aims of this paper is to re  analyse carefully the robustness of v04 results . in this paper 15",
    "different wavelet scales and two estimators , kurtosis and skewness were considered .",
    "could it be that looking at that many estimators , the deviation from gaussianity just happened by chance ?",
    "anyway , the origin of non - gaussian signatures is in general still not clear and controversial .",
    "many scientists just believe that their findings are due to a deficient subtraction of the galactic foreground emissions , ( e.g. chiang & naselsky 2004 and tojeiro et al . 2005 ) .",
    "some others ( e.g. eriksen et al . 2005 ) argue that foregrounds are unlikely to explain their results .    considering the non  gaussianity in wavelet space and",
    "related to the very big and cold spot , several possibilities were discussed in v04 and c05 , namely systematics , galactic foregrounds , thermal sunyaev ",
    "zeldovich effect ( sunyaev & zeldovich 1970 , hereafter sz effect ) , topological defects or gravitational effects ( rees & sciama 1968 , martnez  gonzlez et al .",
    "1990a , b ) .    a better knowledge of _ the spot _",
    "s shape can help us to find out its origin .",
    "for example , _ the spot _ could be explained by considering topological defect models , as suggested in c05 . in this context , if _ the spot _ presents circular symmetry , it could have been generated by a texture .",
    "finding out the shape of _ the spot _ , can also inform us about a hypothetical gravitational potential that could be generating the non - gaussian emission .",
    "tomita ( 2005 ) suggests a local second  order gravitational effect as a possible origin of _ the spot_. these possibilities will be discussed in future papers .    the easiest explanation assuming the widely accepted gaussian hypothesis would be a bad foreground subtraction of the data .",
    "hence it should be the first one to be tested .",
    "v04 and c05 performed several tests to discard the foregrounds as a cause of the detection .",
    "the most important test is the frequency dependence of _ the spot _ , since the galactic foregrounds have a strong frequency dependence .",
    "the amplitude and the number of pixels of _ the spot _ have been shown to have a constant frequency dependence , as expected from a cosmological origin .",
    "nevertheless , some recent works seem to contradict these conclusions .",
    "recently , liu & zang ( 2005 ) analysed the non  gaussianity results obtained with spherical wavelets , concluding that the most possible source of the non ",
    "gaussian departures , are residual foregrounds",
    ". these conclusions do not agree with the results presented in v04 and c05 .",
    "also coles ( 2005 ) suggest that galactic foregrounds could be behind our and other non - gaussian features .",
    "other different explanations are suggested for the large scale asymmetries and the non - gaussian behaviour found in wavelet space .",
    "jaffe et al . ( 2005a ) assume an anisotropic cosmological model , namely the bianchi type vii@xmath4 .",
    "the best fit bianchi model introduces an additional cmb component , which presents a swirl pattern .",
    "looking at this pattern , a hot and a cold spot can be seen close to the center of the swirl .",
    "the cold spot of the best fit model matches _ the spot_. subtracting the swirl pattern , the significance of the kurtosis deviation and other large scale anomalies are largely reduced .",
    "nevertheless a later work , jaffe et al .",
    "( 2005b ) , seems to indicate the incompatibility of the wmap data with extended bianchi models including a dark energy term .",
    "freeman et al .",
    "( 2005 ) points out a possible incorrect dipole correction as a plausible explanation for some of the observed asymmetries .",
    "this hypothesis is under examination but since _ the spot _ has a much lower scale than the dipole , we do not expect to be able to explain it in this way .",
    "considering the relevance of the issue and the present controversial debate , the main part of this work is dedicated to investigate the origin of non  gaussianity found in wavelet space and , in particular a possible foreground contribution to _",
    "the spot_. different techniques of foreground subtraction are taken into account .",
    "summarising , first we will describe shortly the data and simulations in section @xmath52 ; the study of the robustness of the non  gaussian detection in wavelet space will be discussed in section @xmath53 ; the morphology of _ the spot _ in section @xmath54 ; the foreground tests are presented in @xmath55 , and our conclusions in section @xmath56 .",
    "we will use the 1-year wmap data , available in the legacy archive for microwave background data analysis ( lambda ) web page .",
    "the wmap data are given at five frequency - bands , namely k  band ( 22.8 ghz , one receiver ) , ka  band ( 33.0 ghz , one receiver ) , q  band ( 40.7 ghz , two receivers ) , v  band ( 60.8 ghz , two receivers ) and w  band ( 93.5 ghz , four receivers ) .",
    "also the foreground cleaned maps for the q , v , and w channels are available .",
    "the main analysis in v04 and c05 was performed using the combined , foreground cleaned q  v  w map ( hereafter wcm ; see bennett et al .",
    "the use of this map is recommended by the wmap - team .",
    "it is a noise weighted linear combination of the receivers at frequencies where cmb is the dominant signal .",
    "however some other foreground cleaned maps have been suggested by ( bennett et al .",
    "2003b ) , tegmark et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , eriksen et al .",
    "( 2004c ) or patanchon et al .",
    "in section @xmath55 we will describe in more detail some of the different available foreground cleaned maps .    in order to test the gaussianity of the data",
    ", we use the 10000 gaussian simulations described in v04 and c05 .    the hierarchical , equal area and iso - latitude pixelization ( healpix , grski et al . 2005 ) with resolution parameter @xmath6 , is used in all maps . in order to mask the contaminated galactic region ,",
    "we apply the kp0 mask ( bennett et al .",
    "2003b ) plus some extended masks for the convolution with wavelets ( see v04 ) .",
    "it is not trivial at all to determine how significant the non ",
    "gaussian detections are .",
    "almost all analyses define _ the spot _ as a highly significant deviation from gaussianity , but the given significance differs .",
    "our aim in this section is to find the probability of obtaining our observation by chance , assuming that the gaussian hypothesis is true .",
    "this probability is called @xmath7value and will give us the robustness of our findings .",
    "the @xmath7value should not be confused with the upper tail probability , which is the cumulated probability above the observed value . before entering in the discussion ,",
    "let us summarise the obtained results in previous works .    in the first work ,",
    "v04 compared the skewness and the kurtosis of the data with 10000 gaussian simulations , at 15 wavelet scales , between 13.7 and 1050 arcmin .",
    "the deviation of the kurtosis with respect to the gaussian hypothesis was found to have an upper tail probability of @xmath8 at wavelet scale @xmath9 .",
    "considering the galactic hemispheres separately , the lowest upper tail probability appears in the southern one and is @xmath10 at scale @xmath11 , whereas the northern hemisphere is compatible with gaussianity .",
    "afterwards c05 performed a spot analysis using the same scales and simulations as in v04 .",
    "the considered estimators were : number of spots , number of maxima and minima , and number of pixels above or below a given threshold ( hot or cold area ) .",
    "at the same scales where the kurtosis excess was found in v04 and at high thresholds , the cold area shows up very low upper tail probabilities and the number of cold spots was just one .",
    "the lowest probability , @xmath12 , was obtained at scale @xmath13 . in this way the cold spot located at ( @xmath3 ) was discovered to be the one responsible for the non-gaussian detection .",
    "c05 compared the area of _ the spot _ to the biggest spot of each simulation , but only for scales @xmath14 and @xmath15 . at these scales",
    "all the calculated probabilities were lower than @xmath16 ( see table 2 of c05 ) , being the lowest one @xmath12 at scale @xmath15 .",
    "all these upper tail probabilities have been calculated counting how many simulations have higher or equal values of our estimator than the data at _ one particular scale_. since several scales and estimators were considered , these upper tail probabilities do not tell us the @xmath7value , i.e. probability of obtaining our observation by chance assuming that the gaussian hypothesis is true .",
    "we have to bear in mind that considering a large enough number of estimators and scales , the probability of finding non  gaussian features in any gaussian simulation would increase significantly .",
    "we should therefore review our calculations . as for the area of _ the spot _",
    "only two scales were considered , one could think that this would be the best estimator to calculate the @xmath7value . in all other cases we considered 15 scales and several estimators however in the analyses after the detection of the non - zero kurtosis ,",
    "the choice of the scales was conditioned by this first finding .",
    "c05 considered only two scales for the area of _ the spot _ because there the kurtosis deviation was the largest .",
    "hence we have to test the robustness with the first detection , the deviation of the kurtosis .",
    "this deviation occurs mainly at 3 scales considering all the sky , and at 4 scales considering only the southern hemisphere .",
    "mcewen et al .",
    "( 2005 ) calculated the @xmath7value for the all  sky case , using a very conservative approach .",
    "they search through 1000 gaussian simulations to determine the number of maps that have an equivalent or greater deviation than the maximum deviation found in the data .",
    "the obtained @xmath7value was @xmath17 .",
    "this approach does not take into account that the deviation from gaussianity occurs at several consecutive scales . as already mentioned , in the all  sky case scales @xmath18 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 present a significant deviation from gaussianity .",
    "the highest upper tail probability of these three scales is @xmath19 .    in order to know",
    "how likely it is to find such a detection by chance , we have to answer the following question : how many of the 10000 gaussian simulations , show up a higher or equal deviation in any three consecutive scales , and in any of the two estimators , kurtosis and skewness ?",
    "this number will give us the @xmath7value .",
    "in other words , we have to find how many simulations show skewness or kurtosis values with upper or lower tail probabilities lower than @xmath19 in any three consecutive scales .",
    "the @xmath7value we obtain is much lower than the previous one and turns out to be @xmath20 .",
    "anyway the most significant upper tail probability of the kurtosis was not obtained in the all  sky case .",
    "considering the northern and southern hemispheres separately the deviation is highly significant at 4 scales , namely @xmath21 , @xmath18 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the highest upper tail probability of these four scales is @xmath22 .",
    "now we search through the gaussian simulations to find how many simulations show skewness or kurtosis values with upper or lower tail probabilities lower than @xmath22 in any four consecutive scales and in any of the two hemispheres .",
    "the @xmath7value is now @xmath23 proving that the kurtosis deviation from gaussianity is robust .    dividing the sky into two hemispheres",
    "the significance is higher , since the deviation in the kurtosis is due to a localised spot .",
    "anyway we can not continue dividing the sky in an unlimited number of regions , as the sample variance increases . in our case",
    "we are still far away from this limit because each hemisphere contains a large enough number of pixels .",
    "however we should remind that calculating the exact significance of any non - gaussian analysis is not easy . in our present approach",
    "the calculation is more rigorous but with an a - posteriori interpretation , i.e. given the fact that the data deviate from gaussianity at three consecutive scales , we calculate the probability of obtaining a similar deviation in the simulations .",
    "the most important conclusion is that _ the spot _ remains statistically robust , independently of the chosen significance test .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table : area2 ]",
    "in this paper we address the issue of the origin of non  gaussian behaviours observed in the wmap data .",
    "in particular , a non ",
    "zero kurtosis in the distribution of wavelet coefficients was detected by v04 at angular scales ranging from @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "this non  gaussian signal is mainly generated by the presence of a very cold spot in the southern hemisphere , at galactic coordinates @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( v04 , c05 ) .",
    "its dimension ( @xmath26 ) and temperature in wavelet space makes this spot quite exceptional compared to gaussian cmb simulations : less than @xmath27 of the simulations have spots with similar characteristics .    as a first step ,",
    "we have verified the robustness of the deviation from gaussianity in the kurtosis .",
    "we have performed a test taking into account the estimators used in that detection ( skewness and kurtosis ) and the number of consecutive wavelet scales presenting a significant deviation from gaussianity , namely 4 considering only the southern hemisphere .",
    "the significance for the non  gaussian detection remains still high : we obtained that only @xmath23 of the simulations have equal or higher deviation of skewness or kurtosis at any four consecutive scales and in any of the galactic hemispheres .",
    "afterwards we studied the morphology of _ the spot _ using elliptical mexican hat wavelets on the sphere .",
    "we observed that the maximum amplification of _ the spot _ temperature is obtained for almost isotropic mexican hat wavelets , meaning that the shape of the underlying signal is essentially circular .",
    "this result does not discard for instance topological defects like textures or a gravitational potential with a circular shape as possible explanations .",
    "finally , we focus on the possible foreground contamination of _ the spot _ region in the clean wmap maps , considering the sz effect or bad  subtracted galactic foregrounds . the sz effect is clearly discarded by the flat frequency dependence of _ the spot _ temperature .",
    "the galactic foregrounds case requires a more detailed analysis , since a hypothetical foreground mixing could provide a flat foreground contribution .",
    "in wavelet space , the contribution of galactic foregrounds in the region of _ the spot _ is extremely low , at least one order of magnitude less than cmb at the q , v and w bands .",
    "the dominating foreground is the free  free emission at all wmap frequencies except at the w band where free  free is at the same level as dust emission and below the noise level .",
    "if the non  gaussian analysis is affected by unsubtracted galactic foregrounds , we would expect that the non  gaussian detection is more significant at frequencies where the foreground emission is more relevant .",
    "but neither the kurtosis nor the area and amplitude of _ the spot _ are more significant at the q band , i.e. the band where the galactic contribution is higher respect to the v and w bands .",
    "in addition we obtain very similar results from cmb maps produced by completely independent foregrounds subtraction techniques ( e.g. wcm and tcm ) .    because of the large uncertainties in galactic emission at microwave frequencies , we have even considered the possibility that our templates provide an important underestimate of foregrounds .",
    "nevertheless , the possibility of having a strong and frequency independent foreground residue , which could explain the non - gaussian nature of _ the spot _ , is very unlikely .    according to our knowledge on galactic emissions",
    ", we can conclude that there is no evidence for a relevant contribution of unsubtracted foregrounds in the region of the sky which is responsible for the non  gaussian detection in wavelet space .",

    "<S> the shape of _ the spot _ is found to be almost circular . </S>",

    "<S> zeldovich effect . based on our present knowledge of galactic foreground emissions </S>",
    "<S> , we conclude that the significance of our detection is not affected by galactic residues in the region of _ the spot_. considering different galactic foreground estimates , the probability of finding such a big cold spot in gaussian simulations is always below 1% .    = = = = = = = =    # 1 # 1 # 1 # 1 @mathgroup@group @mathgroup@normal@groupeurmn @mathgroup@bold@groupeurbn @mathgroup@group @mathgroup@normal@groupmsamn @mathgroup@bold@groupmsamn =  019 =  016 =  040 =  336 =  33e = = = = = = = =    # 1 # 1 # 1 # 1 = = = = = = = =    methods : data analysis - cosmic microwave background </S>"
