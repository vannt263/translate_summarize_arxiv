    "type ia supernovae are an exciting tool for cosmology .",
    "they are likely to be good standard candles , and can be observed down to @xmath2 .",
    "residual systematic effects , like reddening , @xmath3-correction , and intrinsic differences in the light curve , can be removed by suitable techniques , so that their intrinsic peak magnitude can be estimated with an error of less than half a magnitude down to @xmath4 , where different cosmological models begin to be distinguishable .",
    "recent work by perlmutter et al .",
    "( 1999 , hereinafter p99 ) and riess et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have shown that sne ia are indeed a powerful test of world models .",
    "the most striking results so far , obtained with 42 deep redshift sne , and 18 low redshift sne ( p99 ; see also garnavich et al .",
    "1998 ) are that a zero-@xmath1 flat universe is ruled out to an extremely high confidence level ( c.l . ) , and that the best - fit flat universe is @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "an open , zero-@xmath1 model is also ruled out , at 99% c.l .. these results are particularly important because an @xmath7 around 0.3 is in agreement with a number of independent observations , especially concerning the mass of clusters .",
    "the observed sne at high redshift are roughly half a magnitude fainter than what a flat matter - dominated universe predicts .",
    "such a relatively small difference , and the crucial result that depends on it , deserves close examination ( see for instance an alternative physical explanation in goodwin et al . 1999 , and a phenomenological one in drell et al . 1999 ) . in this paper",
    "we investigate whether a slow time dependence of some fundamental constant can affect the result .",
    "the reason for such an investigation is intuitive : if the peak luminosity @xmath8 of sne ia depends on , say , the gravitational constant @xmath0 , then a relation @xmath9 will show up as a @xmath10 thereby modifying the assumption of standard candles .",
    "in particular , suppose @xmath0 _ increases _ by @xmath11 at a certain look - back time @xmath12 .",
    "suppose then that @xmath13 ( see below ) ; then the predicted apparent magnitude will be fainter by @xmath14 let us call such an effect @xmath0-correction",
    ". if @xmath15 is of order unity , and @xmath0 at @xmath16 , where most deep redshift sne are , was , say , 50% higher than the present value , then the @xmath0-correction would be half a magnitude , and could reconcile the sn observations with a zero-@xmath1 cosmology .",
    "naturally , we are thinking that @xmath0 increases monotonically with look - back time , so that the low redshift sne , as well as the light curve calibration , remain unaffected by the @xmath0-correction .",
    "sne ia are expected to be standard candles because the explosion occurs when a white dwarf accretes matter from a companion and reaches the chandrasekhar mass @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the mass per electron , independently of the progenitor status and of the accretion history ( at least in the standard model , see e.g. woosley & weaver 1986 ) .",
    "it is then very likely that some relation between the peak luminosity and the chandrasekhar mass exists , whatever the precise explosion mechanism is ( see e.g. arnett 1982 ) .",
    "it seems therefore reasonable to test the hypothesis @xmath19 with @xmath20 of order unity .    actually , any dependence of @xmath21 on a fundamental constant , like the nucleon mass , can give an effect similar to the @xmath0-correction .",
    "in fact , a field theory with a coupling of a brans - dicke field to gravity can always be transformed into a mathematically equivalent theory in which the field couples explicitely to the matter fields , rather than to gravity , and therefore the masses are field - dependent . in the following , for definiteness , we focus however on the gravitational constant .",
    "let us then formulate more precisely the effect we are testing .",
    "there are several models which predict a time dependence of @xmath0 , generally based on a brans - dicke coupling .",
    "most of them can be simply parameterized as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the present gravitational constant , @xmath12 is the look - back time , and @xmath24 is the present hubble length for @xmath25 ( see e.g. amendola 1999a ) . the constraints on @xmath26 can be expressed as follows @xmath27 therefore we can assume @xmath28 the value of @xmath29 is of the order of 0.1 - 0.01 , depending on the assumptions ( see e.g. guenther et al .",
    "the relation between the look - back time @xmath30 in units of @xmath31 and the redshift is @xmath32 ^{-1/2}.   \\label{tz}\\ ] ] we can write then @xmath33 and obtain a @xmath0-correction @xmath34,\\ ] ] where @xmath35 .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath36 is of course crucial to our argument .",
    "however , it is difficult to determine it with some certainty , especially because the sne ia mechanism is still matter of controversy .",
    "it is probably safe to assume @xmath37 , which implies @xmath38 .",
    "if the stronger constraint on @xmath39 holds , then the @xmath0-correction is probably unable to alter the conclusions of p99 and garnavich et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . however , there are at least two possibilities to weaken the constraints on @xmath36 .",
    "first , the dependence of @xmath21 on @xmath0 can be stronger than @xmath37 .",
    "second , the @xmath40 relation can be different from the simple power - law ( [ pl ] ) : for instance , @xmath0 could be an oscillating function of time , as was proposed by morikawa ( 1991 ) to explain the periodicity in the pencil - beam galaxy distribution . in this case , tuning the oscillating phase and choosing a period of the order of @xmath41 , one can have @xmath42 very small at present , and larger in the past , so as to escape the present constraints .",
    "an oscillating @xmath40 would be naturally produced if the brans - dicke scalar field oscillates around its potential minimum .",
    "for such a behavior , our power law approximation is supposed to hold approximately around @xmath43 .    for these reasons , and because in this paper we are interested in testing to what extent a time dependence of the fundamental constants affects the sn results , we allow @xmath36 to vary even beyond 0.1 . actually , the sne ia measures can be employed also to estimate @xmath36 itself , as an additional parameter to @xmath44 , as we will show .",
    "there is actually a small inconsistency with eq .",
    "( [ tz ] ) and in the luminosity distance : since we are assuming @xmath0 to be time - dependent , we should use the brans - dicke equation , or some variants of a scalar - tensor theory , in place of the friedmann equation . or ,",
    "equivalently , if we leave @xmath0 constant , and vary one of the other fundamental constants , say the nucleon mass , we should insert an explicit coupling between matter and the scalar field , and this would change the dependence of the matter density with time in the friedmann equation ( see e.g. wetterich 1995 , amendola 1999b ) .",
    "however , the tight constraint on @xmath45 implies that the deviation from the friedmann equation is minimal , so that we make only a small error in using it .",
    "there is also the possibility that the non - minimally coupled field is itself a dynamical cosmological constant , as in quintessence models ( caldwell et al .",
    "1998 , uzan 1999 , chen & kamionkowsky 1999 , baccigalupi et al . 1999 ,",
    "amendola 1999c ) . in these models ,",
    "a new parameter is needed , the scalar field effective equation of state @xmath46 , and the calculations should take into account explicitely this . such models will be investigated in another paper .",
    "once the @xmath0-correction is added to the expected apparent magnitude , we obtain the following relation @xmath47 where we use the notation of p99 , in which @xmath48 is the hubble - constant - free magnitude zero - point , and @xmath49 the hubble - constant - free luminosity distance . in fig .",
    "1 we show @xmath50 for various choices of the parameters , fixing @xmath48 to its best fit value .",
    "values of @xmath36 of the order of 0.5 or larger seem to explain the data even for @xmath51 . to be quantitative",
    ", we form as in p99 a gaussian likelihood function @xmath52 for the four parameters to be estimated . with respect",
    "to p99 we adopt two simplifications .",
    "first , we neglect the dependence on a fifth parameter , called @xmath53 in p99 , the slope of the width - luminosity relation , and assume throughout the p99 best value , @xmath54 .",
    "as stated in p99 , the dependence on @xmath53 has anyway a small effect on the hubble diagram .",
    "the result we get for @xmath55 , extremely close to the original p99 results , confirm that this is indeed an acceptable approximation .",
    "the second approximation is to neglect the correlations among the photometric uncertainties for the high - redshift sne ; as explained in p99 , they are small and , again , the comparison between our results and the original ones confirms that this approximation is not harmful .    as in p99 , we marginalize the likelihood function over the parameter @xmath56 ( that is , we integrate it over )",
    ", we assume the prior condition @xmath57 and , finally , we use the catalog of sne ia published in p99 , excluding the six sne rejected for the fit c. we are left then with 16 low - redshift and 38 high - redshift sne .",
    "we first study how the confidence regions for @xmath58 depend on @xmath59 in fig . 2 and 3 we show the confidence regions for @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "for @xmath55 we recover the best fit of p99 , @xmath62 , while for @xmath63 we obtain @xmath64 .",
    "for a flat universe , the best fit goes from @xmath65 when @xmath55 to @xmath66 for @xmath63 .",
    "while a zero-@xmath1 flat universe is still very unlikely even for @xmath63 , now a zero-@xmath1 open universe with @xmath67 is within the 90% c.l .",
    ", with @xmath68 the best - fit zero-@xmath1 universe",
    ". already for @xmath69 , an open @xmath70 model with enough matter to account for the cluster masses , @xmath71 , is within the 90% c.l .    in fig .",
    "4 we try instead to estimate the maximum likelihood value for @xmath72 , constraining the universe to be flat , @xmath73 the confidence regions are elongated along the degeneracy line @xmath74 . here",
    "we see that to reconcile sne ia with flatness and @xmath51 one needs @xmath75 , which seems quite difficult to achieve .",
    "the best estimate is @xmath76 but the maximum is extremely flat along the degeneracy line . imposing both the constraint of a flat universe and @xmath77",
    ", we find that @xmath36 has to be larger than -0.4 ( 90% c.l . ) .",
    "the inclusion of time dependence in the fundamental constants that determine the sne ia peak luminosity can modify in a significant way the best - fit cosmological model .",
    "here we considered the gravitational constant time dependence , but other fundamental constants can be used as well .",
    "modeling both the time dependence of @xmath0 and the peak luminosity dependence on @xmath0 as power laws , the effect on the sne peak magnitude is proportional to the product @xmath36 of the power law exponents .",
    "the maximum allowed value of @xmath78 is not very well constrained , since it depends on the precise mechanism that powers sne ia . moreover , an oscillating function @xmath40 could escape the local constraints .",
    "we can summarize our results as follows :    * in a flat universe , @xmath79 if @xmath77 . * for @xmath80",
    "there is no significant departure from the standard results ; * for @xmath81 , the p99 confidence regions move by 1@xmath82 or more toward smaller @xmath1 , and a zero-@xmath1 open universe with @xmath71 is within the 90% c.l . * for @xmath83",
    "a zero-@xmath1 open universe with @xmath84 is within the 67% c.l .",
    "region , * for @xmath85 , a flat cosmology without cosmological constant would be reconciled with the sne ia observations .",
