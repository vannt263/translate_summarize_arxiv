    "ionic liquids ( ils ) are promissing candidates for novel applications , including the use as solvents and co@xmath0 absorbers  @xcite .",
    "their special physico - chemical properties are determined by the nanoscopic structure and dynamics , which are governed mainly by strong coulomb forces between the ions .",
    "for example , the ion pair lifetime can be linked directly to transport properties as shown by zhang and maginn  @xcite .",
    "there also exist directional hydrogen bond ( hb ) interactions between ions of opposite charge within a wide range of hb strengths  @xcite .",
    "although being much weaker compared to coulomb interactions , they impact macroscopic properties decisively .",
    "a prominent example is the reduction of the viscosity by the presence of hbs as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "experimentally , hb interactions are accessible by far infrared ( fir ) spectroscopy , as was discussed in detail by fumino _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , as an extra blue - shifted band if compared with the effect of dispersion interaction .",
    "furthermore , in the mid - infrared ( mir ) region the h - bonded nh- or ch - stretching vibrations are red - shifted with respect to their non - h - bonded counterparts  @xcite .",
    "the signatures of h - bonding and fermi resonance interactions can be investigated in detail using nonlinear spectroscopic techniques , which are capable to unravel different phase and energy relaxation rates  @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations can be used to support the various spectroscopic evidences for the existence of hb interactions .",
    "thereby , one can distinguish between cluster and bulk liquid setups .",
    "although these systems are rather different at first glance , gas phase spectroscopy of ils in dependence on cluster size has revealed local motifs that give rise to bulk like spectra @xcite .",
    "structural similarities have also been found in simulations and were assigned to the dominance of strong short - range coulomb interactions  @xcite .",
    "cluster models are particularly well - suited for a normal mode analysis , corresponding to a minimum structure at zero kelvin .",
    "the resulting frequencies are commonly scaled by a method - dependent factor and the spectra are artificially broadened to fit the experimental line shapes .",
    "still , the pronounced anharmonicity of hb dynamics might require to calculate explicit potential energy surfaces  @xcite .",
    "in addition , there exist trajectory - based normal modes approaches that can account for temperature effects  @xcite , which also have been applied to ils  @xcite .",
    "however , the standard approach especially for bulk simulations makes use of linear response theory , _",
    "i.e. _ the ir spectrum is calculated by fourier transformation of the dipole autocorrelation function  @xcite .",
    "the latter is obtained by sampling md trajectories from a canonical ensemble  @xcite .",
    "of course , the quality of the spectra depends strongly on the underlying potential energy surface driving the dynamics .",
    "classical md simulations use many body interactions parametrized via force fields .",
    "there are many applications to structural and dynamical properties of ils @xcite , discovering , for example , mesoscopic segregation behavior  @xcite .",
    "concerning ir spectroscopy and in particular signatures of hb dynamics the use of force fields is problematic , since the parametrization of the latter is often targeted to thermodynamic quantities , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", dft - based _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics ( aimd ) provides the proper frame for more accurate simulations  @xcite .",
    "for instance , the structure and hb dynamics of methylammonium nitrate was investigated in detail by zahn _",
    "_ using car - parinello md @xcite . employing radial , angle and spatial distribution functions ,",
    "preferred ion orientations and hb properties were investigated and the behavior of ion caging was observed .",
    "the latter has been discussed as a general feature of il dynamics  @xcite . for small",
    "system sizes it is in principle possible to obtain aimd trajectories long enough to calculate the power spectra @xcite through velocity autocorrelation functions or , in combination with a charge localization scheme , ir spectra via dipole autocorrelation functions @xcite .",
    "density functional - based tight - binding ( dftb ) is a computationally less demanding alternative , thus allowing for larger system sizes @xcite .",
    "dftb does nt require empirical input and provides self - consistent mulliken charges , which account for polarization effects .",
    "it has been successfully applied to a large class of problems , including biological systems @xcite , as well as to study structural properties of ils  @xcite .    in this contribution",
    "we address the performance of dftb with respect to its description of hb dynamics and ir spectra .",
    "this is done for the test system ethylammonium nitrate ( ean ) , [ ( c@xmath0h@xmath1)nh@xmath2^+$][no@xmath2 ^ -$ ] , which is a prototypical protic ionic liquid ( pil ) .",
    "the reliability of the results will be judged against data obtained by dft / blyp aimd simulations . to facilitate the aimd calculations",
    "the system is restricted to a hexamer cluster of six ion pairs .",
    "previously , dft and force field calculations have been compared for ean clusters of various sizes by bodo _",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "these authors put a special emphasis on hb geometries of _ energy optimized structures_. in dft structures they found asymmetric hb networks with only two out of three possible hb formed .",
    "in contrast force field simulations yielded more symmetric structures and saturated hbs .",
    "furthermore , they compared a harmonic normal mode spectrum against raman measurements and concluded on signals from nh - stretching vibrations involved in hbs of different strength .",
    "the force field itself had been parametrized by song _",
    "et al . _ by combining various parameter sets with additional _ ab initio _ data  @xcite .",
    "radial distribution functions from md simulations were found in reasonable agreement with high - energy x - ray diffraction data .",
    "interestingly , oh - distances and hb angles in force field md simulations are substantially larger than the dft ones from energy optimized structures  @xcite and from later aim simulations  @xcite .",
    "dftb has been compared to force field simulations for the related pil triethylammonium nitrate in our previous work  @xcite .",
    "preceding bulk simulations , geometric hb correlations for a hexamer cluster have been compared for dftb and dft trajectories .",
    "this gave support for the reliability of the dftb method , which then was used to quantify geometric correlations and to obtain ir spectra for the liquid phase .",
    "in particular for the fir range , where experimental data are available , dftb yielded excellent results whereas the force field failed to reproduce the experiments .",
    "alkylammonium cations provide the means to tune the network of hbs formed between cations and anions via the number of alkyl chains  @xcite .",
    "whereas triethylammonium nitrate is capable of forming a single hb only , the present system , ean , in principle facilitates the formation of three hbs . in the following the hb geometries and ir signatures of ean",
    "will be investigated using cluster md simulations .",
    "thereby , dftb and dft trajectory data will be compared , which will lend support for dftb as an efficient yet accurate method for simulation of the hb network in pils such as ean .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section a brief overview on the used theoretical methods and computational setups is given .",
    "results are presented in section [ sec : results ] , focussing on geometries , ir spectra , and charge distributions .",
    "finally , a conclusion is provided in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "a cluster consisting of 90 atoms ( six ion pairs ) with similar initial structure as the hexamer cluster studied by bodo _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , is used for the following dftb and aimd simulations . in a first step",
    "the cluster has been geometry - optimized using dft with the blyp exchange correlation functional and the 6 - 31+g * basis set .",
    "further , grimme s d3 dispersion correction has been employed @xcite .",
    "starting from the minimum structure , langevin dynamics was performed with the target temperature being 300  k and a langevin damping time of 1  ps .",
    "the stochastic perturbations introduced by the langevin thermostat are small enough to yield spectra equivalent to the ones from the standard approach ( microcanonical trajectories sampled from an canonical ensemble ) @xcite .",
    "the total nvt trajectory length has been 60  ps and the time step 0.4  fs . for calculating the ir spectrum ,",
    "it is split into trajectories of 10  ps length .",
    "the dft aimd simulations , in the following called blyp , were performed with terachem , version 1.5k  @xcite .",
    "starting from the same initial blyp geometry , dftb simulations were done using third - order density expansion  @xcite and the 3-ob slater - koster parameter set  @xcite .",
    "the dftb simulations are carried out using the dftb+ software , version 1.2  @xcite .",
    "first , a canonical ensemble was simulated for 5  ps employng the nos - hoover thermostat with target temperature 300  k. this was followed by an energy optimization .",
    "subsequently , the optimized structure is used to initiate a canonical ensemble run for 100  ps . from this trajectory starting geometries for seven microcanonical ( nve ) trajectories were sampled randomly .",
    "the microcanonical trajectories had a length of 10  ps and a time step of 0.4  fs .",
    "dft and dftb trajectories were analyzed with respect to the presence of hbs . here",
    ", a hb was defined between the nitrogen - bound hydrogen and its closest oxygen atom , without a distance cutoff . this way",
    "each of the six cations were assigned three hb partner oxygens from the anions .",
    "the meaningfulness of this choice is analyzed below .",
    "the ir spectrum , @xmath3 , is obtained by fourier transformation of the dipole moment trajectory , ( t ) , using a kaiser window function , @xmath4 , with kaiser parameter 10 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath5 here , the average is taken with respect to the canonical ensemble .",
    "the window function ensures that the dipole fluctuations are damped to zero at the integration boundaries .",
    "the kaiser parameter controls the time scale of the decay and is chosen large enough to ensure that the spectra are not artificially broadened .",
    "all spectra plotted are the moving averages of 21 steps to smooth the curves . in blyp",
    "the total cluster dipole is calculated directly from the wave function , whereas in dftb the mulliken charges are used to calculate the total dipole trajectories of the cluster . note that the dipole in an ionic systems is not uniquely defined , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the context of ir",
    "spectroscopy the center of mass of the cluster is a plausible reference , as this point is fixed for all vibrational normal modes @xcite .",
    "in addition to the total cluster dipole , the contribution of the @xmath6 group atoms to the total dipole are extracted from dftb mulliken charges .    for comparison vibrational normal modes",
    "are calculated for both methods . in case of dft",
    "the turbomole software package has been used  @xcite .      as compared to standard force fields",
    "dftb has the advantage of delivering atom - centered point charges ( mulliken charges ) , which are not only determined self - consistently , but they are polarizable in the sense that they adopt to the actual environment of the atom  @xcite .    in general the partial charge of an atom @xmath7 with atomic number @xmath8 is defined by @xmath9 depending on the method used the partial charges can vary because the atomic densities , @xmath10 , can be defined in different ways .",
    "a simple approach to obtain partial charges is the mulliken population analysis . here",
    ", the total electron density , @xmath11 , is written in terms of the density matrix elements , @xmath12 , and the atomic basis functions , which after integration over space gives the total number of electrons @xmath13 where @xmath14 is overlap matrix element and the indices @xmath15 and @xmath16 refer to atomic basis functions .",
    "the mulliken population @xmath17 of an atom @xmath7 is defined as @xmath18 to gain insight into the charge distribution within the hb , mulliken analyses are performed for the respective n , o , and h atoms using a set of methods , including dftb , dft , and coupled cluster theory ( ccsd(t ) ) ; turbomole is used for the ccsd(t ) calculations @xcite .",
    "the radial pair distribution functions , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 have been calculated from the distances between the anionic o to the cationic n , the h bound to it , and the alkyl c atoms , respectively .",
    "dftb and blyp results are compared in fig .",
    "[ fig : rdf ] .",
    "the convergence with respect to the trajectory length was checked for the dftb simulations .",
    "note that due to the cluster structure , @xmath22 approaches zero for larger distances . in general",
    "these pair correlation functions are rather similar for dftb and dft clusters .",
    "the largest difference between dftb and dft is visible for @xmath20 around 2.5  @xmath23 , which is due to slightly different orientations of the @xmath24 molecules with respect to the n - h bond , bringing a second o atom closer to the n - h bond ( for values of first peak , see tab .",
    "[ tab : rdfpeaks ] ) .",
    "hbs can be detected as distinct peaks at small distances between two atoms involved in hb .",
    "indeed , @xmath25 and @xmath26 show maxima at short distances , but there is no such contribution in @xmath27 .",
    "thus hbs only develop via the cationic nitrogen atom to the anion , and not via the alkyl chains .",
    ".comparison of position of the first peak ( in  ) in the radial pair distribution function of the hexamer cluster as calculated with different methods . for comparison",
    "bulk neutron diffraction  @xcite , dftb  @xcite , force field md  @xcite , and car - parrinello ( bp86 ) aimd  @xcite results are given as well .",
    "in the right - most column one finds the average hb angle . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in particular we will be interested in the distributions of mulliken charges on the n , o , and h atom of all hbs in the cluster with respect to the internal hb coordinates @xmath28 and @xmath29 . in order to estimate the accuracy of dftb in this respect ,",
    "gas phase calculations of mulliken charges for a single ion pair have been performed using different methods , i.e. dftb , blyp , and ccsd(t ) ( for basis sets , see figure ) .",
    "the resulting charges upon hb elongation are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : charges_gas ] . taking ccsd(t ) as a reference we notice that dftb reasonably reproduces the ccsd(t ) behaviour in case of the n atom , i.e. sign and slope match . for the o atom the sign matches as does the slope for short hb distances .",
    "the strongest deviation in slope is seen for the h atom . as far as blyp is concerned",
    ", it is interesting to note that it fails to give the correct sign of the charge at the n atom .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : charges ] we present the changes of mulliken charges with respect to the average values sampled from the dftb trajectory .",
    "the following trends can be observed : the charge at the o atom shows a broad distribution with respect to both coordinates , but no obvious correlation . in contrast , for the h and n atom the distributions are narrower and at the same time a coordinate dependence is clearly visible . the h atom s charge increases ( i.e.  less electron density ) towards smaller absolut @xmath28 and smaller @xmath29 , values , and at the same time the charge of the n atom decreases . as far as the h atom is concerned it can be anticipated , based on fig .  [",
    "fig : charges_gas ] that the actual change should be even more pronounced .",
    "molecular dynamics simulations of a hexamer cluster of the protic ionic liquid ean were performed with the goal being a critical assessment of the validity of the dftb approach . to this",
    "end a comparison with dft / blyp as well as ccsd(t ) results has been made . averaged hb geometries agreed quantitatively for dftb and blyp and are in line with earlier experimental and theoretical publications .",
    "with respect to the linearity of the hb blyp predicts a slightly less flexible structure .",
    "hb coordinate correlations are rather similar for dftb and blyp , both being in the range of weak correlations .",
    "the ir spectra calculated from the cluster dipole trajectories show considerable differences between the two methods . in the far ir region",
    "the spectral features due to h - bonding are similar and close to available bulk experimental data . in the stretching region ,",
    "dftb yields a somewhat broader spectrum pointing to a larger flexibility of the cluster .",
    "most critical is the fingerprint region , where dftb clearly fails to give reasonable frequencies and intensities for the no@xmath30-related vibrations .",
