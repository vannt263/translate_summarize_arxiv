    "in refs . @xcite we have discussed the cosmological properties of light neutralinos ( _ i.e. _ neutralinos with a mass in the range 6 gev @xmath0 50 gev ) , which originate in supersymmetric schemes where gaugino - mass unification is not assumed . actually , the most remarkable features occur for neutralinos in the mass range : 7 gev @xmath0 25 gev .",
    "namely , for relic neutralinos with these masses , direct and indirect detection rates are considerably high , and at the level of present experimental sensitivities .",
    "furthermore , the range of the predicted values for the rates is quite narrow , at variance with what happens for neutralinos of higher masses , where the expected rates are spread over decades .",
    "the properties of light neutralinos with respect to wimp direct measurements were analyzed in refs .",
    "since then , some new results and/or analyses of previous data from experiments of wimp direct searches have appeared @xcite . in the present paper",
    ", we examine whether these new data put some constraints on the relic neutralinos of light masses .",
    "let us recall that the differential event rate @xmath1 ( @xmath2 being the nuclear recoil energy ) measured in wimp direct searches is a convolution of the wimp - nucleus cross section with the wimp phase - space distribution function of wimps , evaluated at the earth location . by assuming that : i ) in this phase - space distribution function , spatial and velocity dependence factorize , and 2 ) coherent interactions dominate over incoherent ones in the wimp - nucleus scattering ( which is usually the case for relic neutralinos ) , one recovers the expression :    @xmath3    where : @xmath4 in the previous formulae , notations are : @xmath5 is the number of target nuclei per unit mass",
    ", @xmath6 is the wimp mass , @xmath7 is the nucleus mass , @xmath8 is the wimp_nucleon _ reduced mass , @xmath9 the nuclear mass number , @xmath10 is the wimp  nucleon coherent cross section , @xmath11 is the nuclear form factor , @xmath12 is the fraction of the mass density of the wimp in terms of the total local density for non - baryonic dark matter @xmath13 ( _ i.e. _ : @xmath14 ) , @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote the velocity distribution function ( df ) and wimp velocity in the earth frame , respectively ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "it is natural to define the velocity distribution function in the galactic rest frame @xmath18 , where @xmath19 , @xmath20 being the earth velocity in the galactic rest frame .",
    "the earth frame velocity df is then obtained by means of the transformation : @xmath21 .",
    "it is implicitly understood that the velocity df @xmath22 is truncated at a maximal escape velocity @xmath23 , since the gravitational field of the galaxy can not bound arbitrarily fast wimps .",
    "the value we adopt here is : @xmath24 km sec@xmath25 @xcite , although we will comment on the effect of a lower value , which we will set at @xmath26",

    "we refer to ref .",
    "here we just remind that for each model we calculate , either analytically ( when possible ) or numerically , the velocity df which accompanies a given matter density distribution . for the spherically symmetric and isotropic models of class a",

    "axisymmetric models of class c allow the presence of a definite angular momentum . we choose them as a direct generalization of some of the models of class a :",
    "for these models , analytical solutions to the relevant generalized eddington equation may be found . in this case , we also allow for a maximal co  rotation or counter  rotation of the galactic halo .",
    "finally , class d presents a specific triaxial model .",
    "each halo model is constrained by a number of observational inputs @xcite : i ) properties of the galactic rotational curve , namely the range of the allowed values for the local rotational velocity , @xmath43 @xcite , and the amount of flatness of the rotational curve at large distances from the galactic center , and ii ) the maximal amount of non  halo components in the galaxy , @xmath44 ( _ i.e. _ the disk , the bulge , etc . ) .",
    "these constraints determine first of all the value of the local dark matter density @xmath13 , which is a relevant parameter in the direct detection rate . depending on whether one allows for a maximal halo ( _ i.e. _ the contribution of the non - halo components is minimized ) or , the other way around ,",
    "the contribution of the halo to the rotational curve is minimized , the value of @xmath13 is either increased or reduced , respectively .",
    "this is discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite and is manifest also in table [ tab : intervals ] , where values of @xmath13 for each halo model and for the three representative values of @xmath34 are shown .",
    "the difference in the values of @xmath13 depending on the assumption of a minimal or a maximal halo contribution is given in ref .",
    "for instance , for the isothermal sphere @xmath13 falls in the range @xmath45 for @xmath46 , @xmath47 for @xmath48 , and @xmath49 for @xmath50 .",
    "we therefore expect a significant variability in the extracted upper limits in direct detection experiments also for the simple and generally used isothermal sphere model .",
    "we notice that the standard reference choice of @xmath51 for @xmath52 refers to the case of a minimal halo .    the choice we make here for the values of @xmath13 associated to each representative value of @xmath34 is the following : for @xmath53 ( which correspond to its 95% c.l .",
    "lower bound ) we adopt the case of a minimal halo , in order to determine the set of less constraining upper  limits on @xmath54 , as is clear from eq .",

    "limits on @xmath54 . in the case of the central ( and reference )",
    "value @xmath56 , we adopt a minimal halo , which reproduces the standard choice @xmath57 for the isothermal sphere .",
    "these considerations apply to all models of class a and b. for the models of class c and d , for which we can rely only on analytical solutions for the velocity df , we are forced to use always the case of a maximal halo : in fact , analytical solutions of class c and d are actually obtained only for a maximal halo contribution @xcite .",
    "let us turn now to the direct effect of the velocity df on the detection rate , which is studied here in terms of the relevant function @xmath32 of eq .",

    "this can be analytically understood by remembering that for a pure isothermal sphere and a maximal halo the velocity distribution function is just an isotropic maxwellian with velocity dispersion given by @xmath34 : @xmath59^{-3/2 } \\exp(-v^2/v_0 ^ 2)\\ , ; \\label{eq : fa}\\ ] ] in this case the function @xmath32 reads ( in the limit @xmath60 ) @xcite : @xmath61\\ , , \\label{eq : ivmina}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 and @xmath63 . from eq.([eq : ivmina ] ) we see that for small values of @xmath39 the larger @xmath32 occurs for smaller @xmath34 because of the inverse law dependence .    on the contrary , for large values of @xmath39 , the almost  exponential tail in @xmath32",
    "is more severe when @xmath34 is small , and therefore the behaviour of @xmath32 with respect to @xmath34 is the opposite .",

    "( [ eq : ivminalim ] ) but nevertheless it follows the same behaviour .    also the value of the escape velocity is relevant in the large @xmath39 tail of the function @xmath32 .",
    "the results presented so far in fig . [ fig : ivmin_isothermal ] are obtained for a value of the escape velocity ( in the galactic frame ) @xmath68 .",

    ", the detection rate for such light wimps will be mostly determined by the almost  exponential tail in the function @xmath32 discussed above .",
    "on the contrary , heavy wimps can produce recoil in the same tens of kev range by possessing much lower velocities : they will be therefore more sensitive also to the low @xmath39 part of the function @xmath32 . the quantitative connection between @xmath27 and @xmath2 for a ge nucleus and different wimp masses is given in fig .",
