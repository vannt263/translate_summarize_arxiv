    "discovery of charge migration in dna molecules has opened new avenues to investigate various possibilities ranging from its role in the dna oxidative damage and repair @xcite to application of dna in nanoelectronic device developments @xcite .",
    "in fact , dna - based molecular electronic devices are expected to operate within the picoseconds range @xcite that can exceed the potential of the present solid state devices .",
    "quite expectedly , the dna molecule has become a subject of intense research activities both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .    from all these studies of charge migration in the dna molecule",
    "reported as yet , it is clear that there are two mechanisms for transfer of charge depending on the dna structure and transfer parameters : a superexchange charge transfer and the incoherent hopping @xcite .",
    "the charge migration leads to the geometry changes in the nucleotides and the surrounding environment , which significantly contribute to the charge migration process . due to the interaction of the @xmath0 orbitals of the nearest neighbor duplexes and insignificant ip difference between them",
    ", hole can be distributed over several sites in the ( a - t)@xmath1 and ( g - c)@xmath1 oligomers .",
    "this significantly changes the magnitudes of the geometry relaxation of the nucleobases  inner - sphere component and environment contribution ",
    "outer - sphere component .",
    "however , the investigation of the transfer parameters , such as orbital overlapping @xcite and activation energy for charge migration i.e. the ip and the reorganization energy @xcite , have been performed mostly for the nucleobases or / and base pairs .",
    "the main purpose of our work is to estimate the electronic coupling between the two nearest nucleobases , their charge distribution and inner - sphere reorganization energy , when they are placed within the ( a - t)@xmath1 and ( g - c)@xmath1 oligomer duplexes .",
    "all these computations have been performed using accurate quantum - chemical methods .",
    "the relatively small reaction free energy in the dna molecule makes the dna hole transfer mechanism qualitatively different from that in most proteins @xcite .",
    "the electron transfer in the dna molecule was found to be strongly dependent on the details of the donor and acceptor energies and deviation of their geometries @xcite .",
    "the charge transfer in a dna molecule occurs due to the overlapping between the @xmath0-electrons of the carbon and the nitrogen atoms that forms the @xmath4 orbitals between the parallel nucleobases .",
    "charge migration in the molecular systems with weakly interacting donors and acceptors , such as between the base pairs in the dna molecule , is described by the standard high - temperature nonadiabatic electron - transfer rate @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the electronic donor - acceptor matrix element , and fc is the franck - condon factor .",
    "the electronic donor - acceptor matrix element @xmath6 is defined by the coupling of the orbitals of the donor and the acceptor and depends on the structure of the dna molecule . for the ( a - t)@xmath1 and ( g - c)@xmath1 oligomers the simple expressions for the deviation of the electronic coupling on the sequence number @xmath2",
    "have been generated @xcite . according to these expressions , the value of the electronic coupling decreases with elongation of the oligomers @xcite . in sect .",
    "iii a , we simulate the electronic coupling of the nucleobases within the ( a - t)@xmath1 and ( g - c)@xmath1 oligomers using the quantum chemistry methods with the jaguar 6.5 program @xcite . according to the koopmans theorem ,",
    "the electronic coupling can be estimated as half of the adiabatic state splitting between the homo and the homo-1 of the closed shell neutral system , determined in a hartree - fock self - consistent field .",
    "therefore , the rhf/6 - 31@xmath7g@xmath8 have been applied for the electronic coupling calculations .",
    "the 6 - 31@xmath7g@xmath8 basis set is appropriate for our purposes .",
    "previous investigations indicated that any further extension has little influence on the electron coupling @xcite .",
    "the geometries of the separated dna base pairs have been optimized with the rhf/6 - 31@xmath7g@xmath8 bases and in the following , the optimized geometries of the base pairs have been stacked with a twist angle 36@xmath9 and a distance of 3.38 .",
    "the stacking of the preliminary optimized geometries allows us to consider the same nucleobases to be ` in resonance ' @xcite within the structures of the ( a - t)@xmath1 and ( g - c)@xmath1 oligomers .",
    "the fc factor deals with the influence of the vibronic interaction on the charge propagation and can be expressed as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the free energy of the reaction , and @xmath12 is the reorganization energy .",
    "the interaction of the molecule with the solvent environment is included in the outer - sphere reorganization energy @xmath13 , while the relaxation of the acceptor , the donor and the molecular bridge geometries are included in the inner - sphere reorganization energy @xmath14 .     for adding one electron to the positive ion and ( b ) the reorganization energy @xmath15 for removing one electron from the neutral geometry , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the hole donor and the hole acceptor .",
    "]    the inner - sphere reorganization energy accounts for the low - frequency inter - molecular modes and can be estimated within the quantum chemical approach as @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the energy of the neutral state in a neutral geometry , @xmath20 is the energy of the neutral state in an ionic geometry , @xmath21 is the energy of the ionic state in an ionic geometry , and @xmath22 is the energy of the ionic state in a neutral geometry . the reorganization energy @xmath15 is the energy to remove an electron from the hole acceptor @xmath17 , while the reorganization energy @xmath23 is the energy to add an electron to the hole donor @xmath24 .",
    "the scheme for calculation of the reorganization energy is presented in figure  [ fig : fig1 ] . clearly , the vibronic interactions stabilize the geometry of the donor and the acceptor from a non - equilibrium state ( @xmath25 ) to the equilibrium state ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "the vertical ionization potential is determined as @xmath27 and differ from the adiabatic @xmath28 by the inner - sphere reorganization energy .",
    "the inner - sphere reorganization energy has been evaluated within the unrestricted becke3p86/6 - 311@xmath7g@xmath8 approximation of the dft method .",
    "the dft theory was found to be reasonable for this purpose based on a comparison of the results of ref .",
    "these results show that the dft theory predicts the magnitude of the inner - sphere reorganization energy with a minimum error when compared to the experimental data @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we have also tested the application of the hf method and the dft theory for the vertical ionization potential ( vip ) calculations and have found significant qualitative and quantitative disagreement of the hf with the experimental data @xcite , while the becke3p86 approximation is appropriate for this purpose .",
    "at first we consider the system of two stacked duplexes .",
    "the results for the highest occupied base orbital ( hobo ) are presented in table  [ tab : table2 ] . in the case",
    "when the pyrimidine / pyrimidine and purine / purine bases are stacked in one strands , the hobos of the adenine and guanine bases have lowest energy in comparison to the pyrimidine / purine configurations .",
    "for the ( a - t)@xmath29 and ( g - c)@xmath29 oligomers the hobos are delocalized over the two intrastrand nucleobases , and therefore , it produces a significant coupling between the @xmath0 orbitals of the stacked pyrimidine / pyrimidine and purine / purine bases . for oligomers where the pyrimidine and the purine bases are stacked in the same strand ( a - t / t - a , g - c / c - g , a - t / c - c ) or in the mixed structures ( a - t / g - c and g - c / a - t ) , for some cases the @xmath0 orbitals are delocalized , but electronic coupling is weak . for others",
    "the @xmath0 orbitals are localized mostly on one nucleobase , and we can consider the weak intrastrand and interstrand coupling between the nucleobases as well . the low interstrand coupling for the cases a - t / t - a and g - c /",
    "c - g has been observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     further , the hydrogen bonds are the channels for charge transfer between the nucleobases . in the oxidized state",
    "the hydrogen bonds participate in the charge transfer between the nucleobases to bring the pairs from the nonequilibrum state , where the charge is localized only on the nucleobase with a lower ip , to the equilibrium state , where the charge is spread over the base pair @xcite .",
    "we consider the a - t and g - c base pairs as a single state for the following calculations of @xmath14 .",
    "the stacking of the base pairs into the ( g - c)@xmath1 and ( a - t)@xmath1 oligomers leads to a decrease of the inner - sphere reorganization energy @xmath30 and a decrease of the vip as well .",
    "the results are presented in figure  [ fig : fig2 ] , where the decrease of @xmath14 is seen to occur due to the contribution of the rotation and translation of the base pairs relative to each other and to the spreading of the charge between the pairs . according to our data , with elongation of",
    "the ( a - t)@xmath1 and ( g - c)@xmath1 oligomers the twist of the base pairs mostly contributes to the decrease of the geometry relaxation of each nucleobase and in a reduction of the @xmath30 .",
    "the decrease of the energies of the adiabatic ip ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig5 ] ) and the inner - sphere reorganization energy ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig2 ] ) provide the decrease of the vip , which is the sum of above two components .     and",
    "the vip values versus the number of pairs in a dna duplex oligomers ( a - t)@xmath1 and ( g - c)@xmath1 performed with ub3p86/6 - 311@xmath7g@xmath8 ]    as we mentioned above , @xmath30 depends on the charge distribution over the chain .",
    "the electrostatic potential distribution in the ( g - c)@xmath1 and ( a - t)@xmath1 oligomers and respectively the residence of the homo in the oligomer centers provides the localization of the charge on the central guanines and adenines in the oxidized state .",
    "we have calculated the charge distribution as the difference between oxidized @xmath32 and neutral states @xmath33 with mulliken population analysis @xcite . in the ( g - c)@xmath1 and ( a - t)@xmath1 sequences the charge is distributed along the chain and is characterized by the low charge density at the dna molecule sides .",
    "for example , the density of the atomic partial charge localized on the @xmath2=1 site is lower than that at the chain center by 0.06 coul for the ( a - t)@xmath1 and by 0.25 coul for the ( g - c)@xmath1 sequences .",
    "for the ( g - c)@xmath34 sequence our results are in agreement with the data in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "therefore , the charge accumulation in the oligomer centers in the oxidized state produces the maximum geometry relaxation in the center of the dna chain .",
    "we have performed an estimation of the geometry relaxation of the separated base pairs @xmath35 within the optimized geometries of the ( a - t)@xmath1 and ( g - c)@xmath1 oligomers , where @xmath36 .",
    "the simulation results of @xmath35 for @xmath2=3 and @xmath2=5 are presented in figure  [ fig : fig3 ] . clearly , for the ( g - c)@xmath1 sequences the difference of the structure relaxation at the sides of the chain and in the center is significant than that for the ( a - t)@xmath1 sequences .",
    "the behavior of these curves repeats primarily the charge distribution in the ( a - t)@xmath1 and ( g - c)@xmath1 sequences .",
    "corresponding to the single base pairs within the ( a - t)@xmath1 and the ( g - c)@xmath1 oligomers , where @xmath37 and @xmath2=5 are calculated with ub3p86/6 - 311@xmath7g@xmath8 . ]",
    "the difference between the inner - sphere reorganization energy of the ( a - t)@xmath1 and ( g - c)@xmath1 oligomers should provides the larger magnitude of the vibrational coupling constant for the g - c pairs than that for the a - t pairs , and larger for the guanine than that for the adenine ( see table  [ tab : table1 ] ) .",
    "we have performed accurate quantum - chemical calculations to determine the electron coupling and the inner - sphere reorganization energy for the ( a - t)@xmath1 and ( g - c)@xmath1 dna oligomers , where @xmath36 .",
    "the electronic coupling between the two neighbor nucleobases within the same strand decreases exponentially with increasing of the base pairs number @xmath2 participating in the chain formation .",
    "the @xmath384 is the sequence number required for an accurate evaluation of the electron coupling in the dna molecule . the orbital distribution in oligomers with the hobo residing on the central nucleobase",
    "have been found to be the main reason for charge accumulation on the base pair located close to the chain center .",
    "the charge distribution in the chain determines degree of the the geometry relaxation of the base pair during the oxidation process in dependence on their location within the oligomer .",
    "therefore , the base pairs in the chain center have stronger geometry distortion during the oxidation process .",
    "such results are in good agreement with the theory of polaron formation in the dna molecule , where the maximum structure distortion occurs in the polaron center @xcite .",
