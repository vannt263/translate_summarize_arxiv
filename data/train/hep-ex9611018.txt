    "the standard model of electroweak interactions ( sm ) has taken a very prominent position in today s description of experimental results .",
    "perhaps the most compelling reason for this state of affairs is that the experimental results have reached a level of precision which require a comparison with theory beyond the born calculations , which the @xmath3 is able to provide .",
    "it is widely anticipated , though , that the @xmath3 is just an approximate theory and should eventually be replaced by a more complete and fundamental description of the underlying forces in nature . since the highest center of mass energies are reached at the tevatron , the measurements at this accelerator provide natural tools to probe the @xmath3 at the highest energy scale",
    ".    in this summary the most recent electroweak results from the tevatron will be described , with the emphasis on results from the collider experiments cdf and 0 .",
    "the cdf and 0 detectors are large multi - purpose detectors operating at the fermilab tevatron collider @xcite .",
    "the 0 detector has a non - magnetic inner tracking system , compact , hermetic , uranium liquid - argon calorimetry and an extensive muon system .",
    "the cdf detector has a magnetic central detector , scintillator based calorimetry and a central muon system . during the 1992 - 1993 run ,",
    "generally called run  1a , the cdf and 0 experiments have collected @xmath420  pb@xmath5 and @xmath415  pb@xmath5 of data , respectively . for the 1994 - 1995 run ( run  1b )",
    "both experiments have collected @xmath490  pb@xmath5 of data .",
    "the ccfr experiment at fermilab studies @xmath6-nucleon interactions .",
    "the measurement of the ratio of charged and neutral current cross sections provides a direct measurement of the weak mixing angle .",
    "results on the @xmath2 and @xmath7 production cross sections , the @xmath2-width , @xmath2-charge asymmetry and the mass of the @xmath2-boson are presented . in the last section moments of the gauge boson",
    "are discussed .",
    "in collisions intermediate vector bosons are produced predominantly by quark - antiquark annihilation . in approximately 80% of the interactions",
    "a valence quark is involved .",
    "sea - sea interactions contribute @xmath820% to the total cross section .",
    "the leptonic decay modes of the @xmath2 and @xmath7-bosons are easily detected because of their characteristic decay signatures : for a @xmath2 decay a high @xmath9 lepton accompanied by large missing transverse energy ( @xmath10 ) , indicating the presence of a neutrino , and two high @xmath9 leptons for @xmath7-decays .",
    "the measurement of the @xmath2 and @xmath7 production cross sections probes the @xmath3 of electroweak and strong interactions and provides insight in the structure of the proton . with the large increase in integrated luminosity",
    "the new measurements have a significantly improved precision .",
    "a persistent uncertainty on any cross section measurement at a collider , however , is the large uncertainty on the integrated luminosity due to the uncertainty on the effective total cross section seen by the detectors .",
    "this uncertainty cancels completely in the ratio of the @xmath2 and @xmath7 production cross sections , a quantity that can be used to extract the width of the @xmath2-boson , @xmath11 .",
    "the event selection is thus geared towards maximizing the cancellation of the different uncertainties in the ratio of the two cross section measurements .",
    ".analysis results for the @xmath2 and @xmath7-production cross section measurement for cdf and 0 .",
    "a@xmath12 , @xmath13 and bkg stand for acceptance , detection efficiency and bkg , respectively , for vector boson @xmath14 .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the 0 experiment has recently performed a new analysis looking for the decay @xmath15 .",
    "this channel has previously been studied only in @xmath16-collisions  @xcite .",
    "sensitivity to anomalous couplings in this channel is much higher than in the di - lepton decay modes due to the higher decay rate into neutrinos and the absence of radiative @xmath7 decay background .",
    "the overall background , however , is still extremely high , leading to very stringent event selection criteria . to reduce",
    "the background from @xmath2+jet events with the electron or jet being misidentified as a photon the @xmath17 and were required to exceed 40  gev . in addition , events with at least one jet with @xmath18  gev were rejected .",
    "the remaining background was dominated by cosmic rays and muons from beam halo which radiated in the calorimeter .",
    "this background was suppressed by rejecting events with a reconstructed muon or a minimum ionizing trace in the calorimeter close to the photon cluster .",
    "the residual background , which had roughly equal contributions from @xmath19 decays and muon bremsstrahlung , was derived from data .",
    "four candidate events are observed on an expected background of @xmath20 events and a @xmath3 prediction of @xmath21 events . although the signal - to - background ratio is less than one , the sensitivity to anomalous couplings is still high , since the background is concentrated at low @xmath17 while the anomalous coupling contribution is almost flat in @xmath17 up to the kinematic threshold of the reaction .",
    "limits on anomalous couplings were set at 95% cl by a fit to the @xmath17 spectrum and gives @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "this represents a factor of two improvement compared to the combined 0 run  1a limits from the di - lepton analysis , based on the same luminosity  @xcite .",
    "a summary of all the limits is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : zg_limits ]  @xcite .",
    "the l3 contour has a different orientation because of the different subprocess center of mass energy at which the events are produced .",
    "a wide variety of properties of the @xmath2 and @xmath7-bosons are now being studied at hadron colliders with ever increasing precision , at the highest energy scales achievable .",
    "all results , including the results from @xmath24 colliders  @xcite , are in good agreement with the @xmath3 .",
    "it is widely anticipated , though , that the @xmath3 is just an approximate theory and should eventually be replaced by a more complete and fundamental description of the underlying forces in nature . with the new data from lep  2 , sld and the tevatron , and with the planned upgrades of the accelerators as well as the experiments , the projected uncertainties  @xcite on some fundamental parameters",
    "should provide the tools to take another ever more critical look at the @xmath3 , without any theoretical prejudice .",
