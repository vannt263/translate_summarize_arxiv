    "in a secure two - party computation , two parties or players want to compute a particular function of their inputs keeping the inputs secret from each other .",
    "they are only allowed to obtain the output of the function preserving some security notions under certain adversarial model .",
    "the secure two - party computation is a special case of ` secure multi - party computation ' ( smc ) . in classical domain",
    ", the smc problem has been studied extensively .",
    "the security of classical smc comes from some computational hardness assumptions and thus is conditional . on the other hand , in quantum domain the adversary",
    "is always assumed to have unbounded power of computation and the security of a protocol comes from the laws of physics .",
    "this is why many researchers have tried to exploit the quantum mechanical effect  @xcite to solve the problems of smc  @xcite .    in  @xcite , it is pointed out that there are some functions which can not be securely evaluated in quantum domain for two - sided  @xcite two party setting .",
    "later , ben -or et al .",
    "@xcite generalized it by showing an impossibility result for @xmath0 players , when there are @xmath1 or more faulty players . since the work of  @xcite in 1997 , in case of two - party quantum computation , some additional assumptions , such as the semi - honest third party etc .",
    ", have been introduced to obtain the secure private comparison  @xcite .",
    "yao s millionaires problem  @xcite is one of the examples of the secure two - party computation .",
    "yao s millionaires problem  @xcite , or more precisely , the ` greater than ' function deals with two millionaires , alice and bob , who are interested in finding who amongst them is richer , without revealing their actual wealth to each other .",
    "much effort has been given to solve this problem in quantum domain  @xcite , all of which analyzed the security issues against several eavesdropping strategies .",
    "jia et al .",
    "@xcite dealt the problem with semi - honest party . in  @xcite",
    ", the millionaires problem is studied considering continuous variable .",
    "he  @xcite exploited the idea of quantum key distribution to solve the problem .",
    "tseng et al .",
    "@xcite proposed the use of bell state to solve this problem .",
    "their protocol also exploits a third party to assist the players .",
    "yang et al .",
    "@xcite showed the vulnerability of their protocol if the third party is disloyal .",
    "however , none of these works  @xcite analyze the security issues considering malicious players .    in classical domain the subsequent work by gordon et al .",
    "@xcite showed that any function over polynomial - size domains which does not contain an  embedded xor \" can be converted into the greater than function or more specifically into the millionaires problem .",
    "hence , millionaires problem covers all functions without embedded xor .",
    "gordon et al .",
    "also studied a function which has an embedded xor  @xcite , namely , a function that simply checks whether the inputs chosen by two players ( from a specified domain ) are equal or not .",
    "exploiting the idea of gordon et al . , we for the first time design two quantum protocols for these two distinct sets of functions and analyze the security issues when players are malicious unlike the existing quantum protocols  @xcite .",
    "further , we analyze our new quantum protocols considering rational players and this is the first work on secure multi - party quantum computation in rational setting .",
    "rational players are neither ` good ' nor ` malicious ' , they are utility maximizing .",
    "each rational party wishes to learn the output while allowing as few others as possible to learn the output .",
    "thus , each rational party chooses to abort to maximize its utility .",
    "this rationality concept comes from game theory .",
    "recently , significant effort has been given towards bridging the gap between two apparently unrelated domains , namely , cryptography and game theory  @xcite .",
    "cryptography deals with the worst case scenario , making the protocols secure against malicious behaviour of a party .",
    "however , in game theoretic perspective , a protocol is designed against the rational deviation of a party .",
    "very recently , brunner and linden  @xcite showed a deep link between quantum physics and game theory . by bringing quantum mechanics into a class of games , known as bayesian games",
    ", they showed that players who can use quantum resources , such as entangled quantum particles , can outperform classical players . in quantum domain , the concept of rational players in secret sharing has been first introduced in  @xcite . in this paper , we identify that fairness in secure two - party computation in non - rational setting does not imply fairness in rational setting . in rational setting , we modify the protocols to achieve both fairness as well as strict nash equilibrium  @xcite .      below we summarize our contributions in this work .    1 .   for the first time in quantum domain",
    ", we identify that for non - simultaneous channel model , there exist some functions which can be computed in two - party setting with complete fairness when one of the parties acts maliciously .",
    "we consider two sets of functions .",
    "one set consists of the functions without embedded xor , whereas the other set deals with a specific function having an embedded xor .",
    "we also consider rational adversaries and modify our protocols accordingly to achieve both fairness and strict nash equilibrium . to our knowledge ,",
    "ours is the first work on secure multi - party quantum computation in the rational setting .",
    "our protocols are secure against both byzantine as well as fail - stop adversaries in both non - rational and rational settings .      here",
    "we highlight the key differences of our protocols from the existing quantum protocols for secure two and multi - party computation .    1 .",
    "lo  @xcite showed that , there are certain functions for which two - sided secure two - party quantum computation is impossible if one of them is malicious .",
    "ben -or et al .",
    "@xcite proved that assuming pairwise quantum channels and classical broadcast channels among the @xmath0 players , a universally composable , statistically secure multi - party quantum computation is possible for less than @xmath1 faulty players . on the other hand",
    ", we identify that in non - simultaneous channel model , both the millionaires and the embedded xor problem can be solved in quantum domain with complete fairness when one of the parties is malicious",
    "our protocols differ from the existing quantum protocols for private comparison  @xcite in the sense that all these protocols analyze the security issues against several eavesdropping strategies .",
    "none of those consider malicious players .",
    "contrary to this , we analyze the security of our protocols considering malicious behaviour of the players . in our protocols",
    "there are no external adversary .",
    "in this section we explain what is meant by functionality , two - party computation , ideal and real world model , security of a protocol , byzantine and fail - stop adversary used in this work .",
    "we also define fairness in non - rational as well as rational settings .",
    "we identify that when we move from one model to another , the definition of fairness changes .",
    "further , we define strict nash equilibrium for two players game in the rational setting .      in classical domain and in two - party setting , a functionality @xmath2 is a sequence of randomized processes , where @xmath3 is the security parameter and @xmath4 maps pairs of inputs to pairs of outputs ( one for each party ) .",
    "explicitly , we can write @xmath5 , where @xmath6 ( resp .",
    "@xmath7 ) represents the output of the first party , say @xmath8 ( resp .",
    "output of the second party , say @xmath9 ) .",
    "the domain of @xmath4 is @xmath10 , where @xmath11 ( resp .",
    "@xmath12 ) denotes the possible inputs of the first ( resp .",
    "second ) party .",
    "if the domain sizes @xmath13 and @xmath14 are polynomial in @xmath3 , then we say that @xmath15 is defined over polynomial size domains .",
    "if each @xmath4 is deterministic we say that each @xmath4 as well as the collection @xmath15 is a function .      in classical domain ,",
    "the two - party computation of a functionality @xmath16 is defined as follows .",
    "if a party @xmath8 is holding @xmath17 and a input @xmath18 and a party @xmath9 is holding @xmath17 and a input @xmath19 , then the joint distribution of the outputs of the parties is statistically close to @xmath20 .      in _ ideal world model",
    "_ we assume that there is an incorruptible trusted third party who computes the function in behaves of @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath9 send their inputs to the ttp who computes the functionality and returns the value to each party . on the other hand , in _ real world model _",
    "there is no trusted party to compute the functionality , rather a protocol is executed to compute the functionality .    here , along the same line as  @xcite",
    ", we assume a _ hybrid world model _ , where there is a trusted third party who computes the function like in the ideal world and distributes the shares of the function s output like a dealer in secret sharing  @xcite between the players .",
    "the players construct the output by exchanging their shares . in our hybrid world model",
    "we call the ttp as a _ dealer_.    the security of a protocol depends upon what an adversary can do during the real protocol execution . in ideal world , as there is an incorruptible trusted third party who computes the function and sends the output to the participants the computation is secure by definition . however , in real world model there is no trusted party .",
    "if the adversary who exists in the real model can do no more harm than the ideal scenario , then we say that the protocol is secure .      in the fail - stop setting ,",
    "each party follows the protocol as directed except that it may choose to abort at any time  @xcite and a party is assumed not to change its input when running the protocol . on the other hand ,",
    "in byzantine setting , a deviating party may behave arbitrarily .",
    "it may change the inputs or may choose to abort . since byzantine adversary covers all the characteristics of a fail - stop adversary , it is very natural to consider only byzantine setting .",
    "if a protocol is secure against a byzantine adversary , it must be secure against a fail - stop adversary .",
    "hence , throughout the paper we analyze the security issues against byzantine adversary only .      in non - rational setting",
    ", the move of a player is decided by his adversarial nature not by his utility function ; whereas in rational setting every move of a player is guided by his utility .",
    "for fairness in non - rational setting , we need to introduce some terminologies .",
    "let us assume that @xmath8 begins by holding an input @xmath21 and @xmath9 begins by holding an input @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the auxiliary input of the adversary .",
    "let @xmath24 represent a pair of two random variables denoted by @xmath25 and @xmath26 , where @xmath27 represents the output of the party who is corrupted by the adversary @xmath28 and @xmath29 represents the output of the honest party in the ideal world .",
    "thus , we can write @xmath30 similarly , let @xmath31 represents a pair of two random variables , namely @xmath32 and @xmath33 , where @xmath32 denotes the random variable in real world consisting of the view of the player corrupted by the adversary @xmath34 and @xmath33 represents the random variable consisting of the output of the honest party in the real world  @xcite .",
    "( fairness ) a protocol @xmath35 is said to securely compute a functionality @xmath36 with complete fairness if for every adversary @xmath37 , having unbounded power of computation in the real model , there exits an adversary , @xmath28 , with same computational complexity in the ideal model such that @xmath38    note that , here we do not require a security parameter @xmath3 as we consider our adversary has unbounded power of computation .    in our hybrid model ,",
    "the fairness condition is as follows .",
    "( fairness ) a protocol @xmath35 is said to securely compute a functionality @xmath36 with complete fairness if for every adversary @xmath37 , having unbounded power of computation in the hybrid model , there exits an adversary , @xmath28 , with same computational complexity in the ideal model such that @xmath39    here , @xmath40 is replaced by @xmath41 which is the random variable consisting of the view ( @xmath25 ) of the adversary and the output ( @xmath26 ) of the honest party in the hybrid world in the same manner as above .",
    "we define a _ function reconstruction protocol with rational players _ to be a pair @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the game ( i.e. , specification of allowable actions ) and @xmath44=@xmath45 denotes the strategies followed by @xmath0 number of players .",
    "we use the notations @xmath46 and @xmath47 respectively for @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the outcome of the game is denoted by @xmath50=@xmath51 .",
    "the set of possible outcomes with respect to a party @xmath52 is as follows .",
    "1 ) @xmath52 correctly computes @xmath53 , while others do not ; 2 ) everybody correctly computes @xmath53 ; 3 ) nobody computes @xmath53 ; 4 ) others computes @xmath53 correctly , while @xmath52 does not . the output that no function is computed is denoted by @xmath54 ( i.e.",
    ", _ null _ as in  @xcite ) .",
    "the utility function @xmath55 of each party @xmath52 is defined over the set of possible outcomes of the game .",
    "the outcomes and corresponding utilities for two parties are described in table  [ table : outcomesrss ] .",
    "we here assume that the utility values are real .",
    ".outcomes and utilities for @xmath56 rational function reconstruction [ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]     thus , the expected utility of @xmath8 in this case is @xmath57 & = & ( 1-\\gamma)\\big(\\frac{1}{2}u_1^{tt } + \\frac{1}{2}u_1^{nt}\\big ) + \\gamma \\big(u_1^{tt}\\big)\\\\ & = & \\frac{(1+\\gamma)}{2}\\big(u_1^{tt}\\big ) + \\frac{(1-\\gamma)}{2}\\big(u_1^{nt}\\big).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    now , combining all two subcases , we get @xmath58\\\\ & = & e[u_1 | ( x_1,y_1)]\\cdot \\pr(y = y_1 ) + e[u_1 | ( x_1,y_2)]\\cdot \\pr(y = y_2)\\\\ & = &   \\big[\\frac{(1+\\gamma)}{2}\\big(u_1^{tn}\\big ) + \\frac{(1-\\gamma)}{2}\\big(u_1^{nn}\\big)\\big]\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}\\\\ & & + \\big[\\frac{(1+\\gamma)}{2}\\big(u_1^{tt}\\big ) + \\frac{(1-\\gamma)}{2}\\big(u_1^{nt}\\big)\\big]\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}\\\\ & = & \\frac{(1+\\gamma)}{4}\\big(u_1^{tn}+u_1^{tt}\\big )   + \\frac{(1-\\gamma)}{4}\\big(u_1^{nn}+u_1^{nt}\\big).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if the above expression is greater than or equal to @xmath59 , @xmath8 chooses abort .",
    "thus , for fairness , we need to ensure that @xmath60 , i.e. , @xmath61    * case 2 : @xmath62*. the analysis is similar and we obtain the same expression for @xmath63 $ ] .",
    "more specifically , we have the following observation .",
    "* subcase 2(a ) : * @xmath64 .",
    "the analysis is exactly identical to subcase 1(b ) .    *",
    "subcase 2(b ) : * @xmath65 .",
    "the analysis is exactly identical to subcase 1(a ) .",
    "* case 3 : @xmath66*. when @xmath66 , @xmath8 will abort as he knows the output with certainty . in this case",
    ", he needs no help from @xmath9 to compute the function .",
    "however , when @xmath8 chooses to abort , @xmath9 outputs @xmath67 .",
    "thus , for @xmath68 , both get the correct output of the function .",
    "the utility for both the player is @xmath69 , @xmath70 .",
    "hence , the fairness condition in rational setting is always maintained .",
    "from the above analysis , we can state the following result .",
    "[ fairxor_unequal ] provided @xmath71 ( section  [ pre ] ) , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 the protocol @xmath74 achieves fairness .",
    "the proof follows from equations  .",
    "the additional condition @xmath75 follows from the fact that for @xmath76 to be meaningful , the numerator @xmath77 must be @xmath78 .",
    "further , from the condition @xmath79 , it is easy to see that the natural restriction @xmath80 always holds .    in equation",
    ", all the three terms within the parentheses are non - negative according to @xmath71 .      combining the above results",
    ", we can state the following .",
    "provided @xmath81 for @xmath82 , @xmath71 ( section  [ pre ] ) , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 the protocol @xmath74 achieve strict nash equilibrium .    from theorem  [ forgexor ] , we get that provided @xmath81 for @xmath82 , no player has any incentive to cheat as he can not increase his payoff by cheating . in case of early abort , @xmath9 can not maximize his utility , as early abort of @xmath9 will terminate the protocol and in that case either no one gets the correct output ( @xmath83 ) or both get the correct output ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "so @xmath9 never achieves @xmath85 by aborting early .",
    "however , it is @xmath8 who can achieve @xmath86 by aborting early , as @xmath8 always computes the output first followed by @xmath9 .",
    "but in theorem  [ fairxor_unequal ] , we proved that provided @xmath71 ( section  [ pre ] ) , @xmath72 , and @xmath87 @xmath8 has no incentive to abort early .",
    "thus , we can say that for every player @xmath52 , @xmath70 , @xmath88 holds and hence no one deviates from the suggested strategy .",
    "in 1997 , lo  @xcite showed the impossibility of secure two - party quantum computation of certain functions , when one of the parties is malicious . in this direction , we obtain a positive result for two types of functions .",
    "this does not contradict with the generalized impossibility results of  @xcite in broadcast channel model , since we show our results in non - simultaneous channel model .",
    "further , for the first time , we introduce the idea of secure two - party quantum computation with rational players .",
    "when one moves from the non - rational domain to a rational one , the definition for fairness changes .",
    "thus , we modify the protocols to achieve fairness in rational setting . in addition , we prove strict nash equilibrium for our proposed protocols in rational setting .",
    "we have shown that secure two - party quantum computation is possible for any function without an embedded xor and for a particular function with an embedded xor .",
    "thus , it remains an open question whether secure two - party quantum computation is possible for any function with an embedded xor .",
    "moreover , generalization of the two - party protocols to @xmath0-party scenario would be an interesting future work , particularly , in the non - simultaneous channel model ."
