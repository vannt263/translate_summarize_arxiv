    "since the discovery of the higgs boson at the lhc by the atlas and cms collaborations  @xcite , experimental measurements have been focusing on the determination of its consistency with standard model ( sm ) expectation . within the current experimental and theoretical uncertainties ,",
    "the discovered higgs boson is in agreement with the predictions for a sm higgs boson considering its spin zero property  @xcite .",
    "the measurement of higgs coupling to fermions through @xmath11  @xcite , @xmath12  @xcite , @xmath4  @xcite and to gauge bosons through @xmath13  @xcite , @xmath14  @xcite have also been performed with current lhc data and will be measured more precisely in the future run . the measurement of higgs self - coupling is also necessary to reconstruct the scalar potential of the higgs doublet field , while due to the smallness of the signal and large qcd backgrounds the probing of the higgs self - coupling has to await for a high - luminosity lhc ( hl - lhc ) , 33 tev , or 100 tev @xmath3 collider  @xcite .",
    "it is important to stress that so far all experimental determinations of the higgs @xmath2 properties have been obtained from the higgs to vector boson couplings with lepton final states . the hypothesis that higgs boson being a pure pseudoscalar state has been excluded by the present data since the @xmath15 and @xmath16 signals from @xmath17",
    "@xcite and @xmath14  @xcite decays have been observed . in particular ,",
    "the angular distributions of the lepton pairs in the @xmath18 channel are sensitive to the spin - parity of the higgs boson .",
    "although the present lhc data strongly prefer that @xmath0 is a @xmath19 state , it is not yet excluded that the higgs boson has a pseudoscalar component  @xcite . using the present measured signal strengths in various higgs search channels , theoretical studies on the higgs @xmath2 properties",
    "have been performed , and constraints on the mixing angle of the @xmath2-even and @xmath2-odd component are given model dependently  @xcite .",
    "there are also investigations on how and to what extent to pin down the higgs @xmath2 mixing angle via other higgs decay channels at the lhc and future linear collider  @xcite .    among all the higgs production channels , the investigation of the @xmath4 process plays a complementary role in higgs characterization in the sense that it is very sensitive to the relative magnitudes of the @xmath2-even and @xmath2-odd top - higgs yukawa coupling coefficients .",
    "although the @xmath4 production cross section is only around 1/200 of the inclusive higgs production for @xmath20 with a mass of @xmath21 gev at run i lhc and suffers from large multiplicity of the objects in the final state from top pair decays , the hl - lhc and proposed future hadron colliders with higher collision energy , the high energy lhc ( he - lhc ) , sppc , etc . ,",
    "are capable of enhancing the @xmath4 event rates . in this paper",
    ", we will revisit certain operators defined from the momenta of the @xmath4 process , which are sensitive to the coefficients of different @xmath2-mixed states .",
    "we choose two particular higgs decay modes @xmath22 and @xmath11 for clearness of signal and the wealth of event rates respectively , and study the behaviour of weighted moments at the lhc and the future hadron colliders .",
    "we find that these operators for the corresponding @xmath10 and @xmath7 processes have a good discrimination power for a @xmath2-even higgs from a @xmath2-mixed state .",
    "to accommodate possible deviations of higgs to top quark @xmath4 coupling in both strength and @xmath2 properties , we parametrize the @xmath4 coupling in the following form @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of higgs field , and @xmath25 and @xmath26 corresponds to the @xmath2-even and @xmath2-odd coupling coefficient respectively . in particular , the sm higgs boson has @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the angle @xmath29 is an indication of the degree of mixture @xmath2 in the physical higgs @xmath0 .",
    "this form of higgs fermion interaction will be assumed also for other fermions in our discussions .",
    "the dominant higgs couplings to vector gauge bosons , @xmath30 and @xmath31 will come from the @xmath2-even component of @xmath0 in the following form@xmath32    the main production channel of higgs boson at the lhc is via gluon fusion process .",

    "@xmath53 is from @xmath30 boson loop contribution with @xmath54",
    "deviations of higgs boson coupling to top quark from sm one can show up in different ways .",
    "we study how to identify such deviations using @xmath55 with the higgs boson identified by @xmath56 and @xmath57 since the former has the largest branching ratio and the latter has clearer signals compared with other decay modes .",
    "both atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite have performed experimental searches on the @xmath4 production process , with @xmath0 decays into @xmath22 and @xmath11 separately . for the @xmath7 process , collecting the @xmath58 tev data final state are categorized according to their jet and @xmath59-tagged jet multiplicities .",
    "the observed cross section upper bound is @xmath60  @xcite , and @xmath61  @xcite . for the @xmath10 process ,",
    "the observed upper limit on cross section is @xmath62  @xcite .",
    "we still need to wait for more accurate data to draw conclusions about the production cross section .",
    "the interaction in eq.([htt ] ) can cause deviation in @xmath4 cross section from sm prediction and in the higgs decays .",
    "we have evaluated the @xmath4 cross sections using madgraph5 particularly heft model where the higgs effective theory is included  @xcite with a mild rapidity cuts on the top and antitop quarks @xmath63 .",
    "the results with the parameter @xmath27 and range of @xmath29 from 0 to @xmath64 and collision energy @xmath65 13 tev , 14 tev , 33 tev and 100 tev with @xmath66 gev are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : strength ] .",
    "here we would like to point out that one should consistently take the high - order correction to the cross section into account . for @xmath4 process",
    ", the nlo prediction for a higgs boson mass of 125 gev has cross section around 86 fb , 130 fb , 611 fb and 33700 fb  @xcite at @xmath67 tev , 8 tev , 14 tev and 100 tev . estimated using cteq6.6 , the nlo corrections are positive .",
    "this is higher than that obtained with the cross section of about 72 fb , 107 fb , 476 fb and 24010 fb using the lo results .",
    "a @xmath68-factor of 1.19 - 1.40  @xcite should be applied when we use the values shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : strength ] .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     if we further include the @xmath69 pair decay , a total factor of the change on the cross section @xmath8 and discrimination power @xmath70 can be estimated by the corresponding decay branching ratios .",
    "we choose top quark decays semileptonically and antitop quark decays hadronically in order for the identification of @xmath1 and @xmath71 and also the reconstruction of the transverse momentum of @xmath1 and @xmath71 .",
    "therefore , the decay products from top pair will be @xmath72-jet @xmath73 , the reduced signal cross section can be estimated by @xmath74 with @xmath75 for @xmath10 process .",
    "while for @xmath7 cross section , an additional suppression factor from @xmath59-tagging efficiency ( @xmath76 ) should be included leading to @xmath77 .",
    "consequently , by including top pair decay the value of @xmath70 will be affected by a total suppression factor of @xmath78 0.42 ( 0.25 ) for @xmath10 ( @xmath7 ) from eq.([eq : d ] ) .",
    "given @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and background event number @xmath83 , it is straightforward to compute the required signal event number @xmath84 for a sm - like higgs to achieve certain value of @xmath70 .",
    "for example , if one wants to discriminate @xmath4 coupling of @xmath85 from @xmath86 at the @xmath87 statistical level , the prediction from @xmath10 and @xmath7 are different .",
    "the @xmath10 background event number is @xmath88 ( 2280 ) at @xmath89 ( 100 ) tev , estimated from the operator with the largest discrimination power @xmath90 we find that @xmath91 requires signal event number to be around @xmath92 ( 1950 ) .",
    "the simulated value for lo signal rates are about 160 ( 9870 ) .",
    "therefore , using @xmath10 channel it is difficult to discriminate the @xmath4 of @xmath85 coupling from a @xmath86 mixed coupling at @xmath87 statistical level at 13 tev .",
    "however , a future @xmath3 collider at 100 tev can produce enough signal events to achieve the discrimination at larger than @xmath87 level .",
    "the situation is better in @xmath7 channel .",
    "the sm @xmath7 background has a event number of around @xmath93 ( 7.8@xmath94 ) at @xmath89 ( 100 ) tev , estimated from the operator with largest discrimination power @xmath95 we find that @xmath91 requests signal events number to be @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "the real lo signal event number is around @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) , which is significantly lager than required .",
    "consequently , from the @xmath7 process , one is able to discriminate the @xmath4 coupling with @xmath85 from a @xmath86 @xmath2-mixed state at more than @xmath87 statistical level with any collision energy larger than 13 tev at @xmath3 collider .",
    "the figures  [ fig : d_ttrr ] and  [ fig : d_ttbb ] show the corresponding @xmath70 values for @xmath10 and @xmath7 final state after including the above decay and @xmath59-tagging efficiencies with the @xmath2 mixing angle running from @xmath100 to @xmath64 with collision energy at 13 tev , 14 tev , 33 tev and 100 tev . for both processes ,",
    "the number of events are obtained with integrated luminosity assumed to be @xmath101 and an enhancing factor of @xmath102 on @xmath70 will appear if we consider the hl - lhc with @xmath1033 ab@xmath104 .",
    "comparison between each two operators shows that @xmath105 , and @xmath95 are most useful balancing the sensitivity and errors , among which @xmath90 probably performs the best .",
    "@xmath90 is also easy to be constructed which is irrelevant to the @xmath106-component of top and antitop momentum @xmath107 .",
    "the results shown in fig .  [ fig : d_ttrr ] tell that for @xmath10 process at @xmath108= 13 tev and 14 tev the discrimination powers for operators @xmath109-@xmath95 are generally less than three in the allowed @xmath2 mixing region . when the integrated luminosity is increased to be 3 ab@xmath104 at hl - lhc",
    ", @xmath110 can be reached in the region @xmath111 for all operators .",
    "it is much more optimistic at @xmath112 tev and @xmath113 tev , which shows that all the operators can give large enough statistical significance in the region @xmath114 .",
    "the operator @xmath90 gives the best discrimination power irrelevant of the collision energy and @xmath2 mixing angle .",
    "all the operators reach maximal discrimination power at @xmath115 .    comparing the @xmath7 process with @xmath10 , we want to emphasize , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : d_ttbb ] , that @xmath56 decay modes shows better discrimination powers due to the large event rate of the higgs to @xmath11 decay branching ratio . for @xmath7 process",
    ", the operator @xmath90 and @xmath95 give the best discrimination powers .",
    "note that if we make full analysis considering final state jets and leptons from top quark decay , and impose further cuts on the jet multiplicities , the value of discrimination power @xmath70 will appear even better than present numbers .",
    "the higgs boson @xmath0 has the largest coupling to the top quark @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath4 interaction can be sensitive to the investigation of new physics beyond sm . in this work ,",
    "we have studied the potential of determining higgs boson @xmath2 properties at the lhc and future 33 tev and 100 tev @xmath3 coliders by analysing various operators formed from final states variables in @xmath4 production .",
    "a @xmath2 violating higgs coupling to top quark can cause significant deviations from sm predictions for @xmath116 .",
    "we have evaluated the @xmath4 cross sections using madgraph5 particularly heft model .",
    "we find that the cross sections become considerably smaller than those of the sm predictions when cp violating component gets bigger .",
    "this fact may be used to distinguish the sm @xmath4 coupling with that from a beyond sm . but this may be caused by an overall scaling factor to the coupling . to further identify the relative magnitudes of the @xmath2-even and @xmath2-odd interactions in @xmath117 , certain sensitive weighted moments in @xmath118 process can help to achieve this .",
    "we obtained results for discrimination power for several operators with the higgs boson identified by @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "for an integrated luminosity is 300 @xmath9 , we find that , with @xmath119 , the discrimination power will be below 3@xmath8 at the lhc , while for 33 tev and 100 tev colliders , more than 3@xmath8 sensitivity can be reached .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath120 process can provide more than 3@xmath8 discrimination power in a wide range of allowed higgs to top couplings for the lhc , the 33 tev and 100 tev colliders .",
