    "the thermal noise of the cantilever in one quadrature of the motion was observed to be reduced below the equilibrium value .",
    "it has been shown that _ quantum _ squeezing @xcite of the motion of a nanomechanical resonator , analogous to the single - mode squeezing of light in a degenerate parametric amplifier ( dpa ) below threshold @xcite , is feasible using a similar approach .",
    "however , the detection of such states is problematic .",
    "a number of schemes have been proposed for generating squeezed states of nanoresonators .",

    "other proposals are based on quantum non - demolition measurement and feedback @xcite , via either a coupled single electron transistor @xcite or coupled microwave cavity @xcite . however , these schemes require truly quantum - limited measurement in order to achieve the required feedback and squeezing .",
    "our scheme facilitates the generation and detection of a squeezed mechanical state without detection at the single photon level , a task that would be feasible in optomechanical systems but is not feasible in electromechanical systems .        in our proposal ,",
    "the nanoresonator is driven parametrically via a coupled capacitor plate . a coupled microwave cavity , in the form of a superconducting coplanar waveguide , functions as a transducer for the nanoresonator motion . a schematic",

    "significantly , this driving condition is compatible with the goal of ground - state cooling of the nanoresonator .",
    "a quadrature of the output microwave field is measured by homodyne detection after amplification and one may infer quantum squeezing of the field , and hence of the nanoresonator motion , in a manner similar to that used for the josephson parametric amplifier @xcite .",

    "one may use non - markovian correlation functions to describe the input noise , though in the limit @xmath47 ( the mechanical damping rate ) , the input noise operators become delta - correlated in time @xcite and the use of a quantum optics master equation suffices .",
