    "typical physical models of fluid flow rely on the assumption that the cauchy stress is an explicit function of the symmetric part of the velocity gradient of the fluid .",
    "this constitutive hypothesis then leads to the navier  stokes system and its nonlinear generalizations , such as various electro - rheological flow models .",
    "it is known however that the framework of classical continuum mechanics , built upon the notions of current and reference configuration and an explicit constitutive equation for the cauchy stress , is too narrow for the accurate description of inelastic behavior of solid - like materials or viscoelastic properties of materials .",
    "our starting point in this paper is therefore a generalization of the classical framework of continuum mechanics , referred to as implicit constitutive theory , which was proposed recently in a series of papers by rajagopal and collaborators ; see , for example , @xcite .",
    "the underlying principle of implicit constitutive theory in the context of viscous flows is the following : instead of demanding that the cauchy stress is an explicit function of the symmetric part of the velocity gradient , one may allow an implicit and not necessarily continuous relationship between these quantities .",
    "this then leads to a general theory , which admits fluid flow models with implicit and possibly discontinuous power - law - like rheology ; see , @xcite . very recently",

    "fusco lipschitz truncation @xcite was used in order to prove the existence of a weak solution . in @xcite , using a variety of weak compactness techniques , we showed that a subsequence of the sequence of finite element solutions converges weakly to a weak solution of the problem as the finite element discretization parameter @xmath4 tends to @xmath5 . a key new technical tool in the analysis presented in @xcite was a finite element counterpart of the acerbi ",

    "however , in the case of velocity approximations that are not exactly divergence - free the convergence theory developed there was restricted to the range @xmath1 .",
    "the focus of the present paper is on the adaptive finite element approximation of implicitly constituted power - law - like models for viscous incompressible fluids . as in @xcite ,",
    "the implicit constitutive relation between the stress and the symmetric part of the velocity gradient is approximated by an explicit ( smooth ) constitutive law .",
    "the resulting steady non - newtonian flow problem is then discretized by a mixed finite element method .",
    "guided by an a posteriori error analysis , we propose a numerical method with competing adaptive strategies for the mesh refinement and the approximation of the implicit constitutive law , and we present a rigorous convergence proof generalizing the ideas in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "more precisely , we show that a subsequence of the adaptively generated sequence of discrete approximations converges , in the weak topology of the ambient function space , to a weak solution of the model when @xmath1 .",
    "in contrast with @xcite , stimulated by ideas from @xcite we shall be able to avoid resorting to the theory of young measures .",

    "we conclude the paper by discussing concrete graph approximations for certain problems of practical relevance .",
    "while the emphasis in this paper is on the mathematical analysis of adaptive finite elements algorithms for implicitly constituted fluid flow models , the ideas developed herein may be of more general interest in the convergence analysis of adaptive finite element methods for other nonlinear problems in continuum mechanics with possibly nonunique weak solutions .",
