    "( 2006 ) suggests that [ oii ] emission is a poor indicator of star formation activity in many galaxies .",

    "absolute flux calibration and slit throughput corrections for the cl1604 deimos and nirspec data were obtained in a manner nearly identical to that of lemaux et al .  ( 2009 ) and lem10 , respectively . the nirspec calibration involved comparing observations of the standard star hd203856 with a scaled flux calibrated spectrum of @xmath1lyr ( colina , bohline , & castelli 1996 ) . following the analysis of lem10 , an internal extinction of @xmath18 = 0.3 was adopted for all galaxies in our sample and corrected for using the calzetti et al .",

    "this suggests the dominant source of ionizing flux in these galaxies is agn - related emission and not radiation from young stellar populations .",

    "the two galaxies that fall below the kewley et al .",
    "maximum are sources x0 , the star - forming spiral host previously discussed , and source x3 .",
    "this latter source is the only cl1604 agn in which the highly ionized [ nev ] emission line is visible .",
    "the strength of the [ oii ] line is predicted and observed to decrease in high - ionization agns ( ho et al .",
    "1993 ) , which likely explains the lack of [ oii ] contamination in this galaxy .    to determine the degree to which current star formation activity would be overestimated in the galaxies showing excess [ oii ] emission , we calculated the star formation rate ( sfr ) of each host using the relations of kennicutt ( 1998 ) and the observed [ oii ] and h@xmath1 line luminosities . in figure [ fig - cl1604_bpt2 ]",
    "we compare the sfr derived from the extinction - corrected h@xmath1 line to that of the extinction - corrected [ oii ] line using a constant @xmath30 . in the four agn hosts where [ oii ] is elevated relative to h@xmath1 , the sfr would , on average , be overestimated by a factor of five .",
    "even if we make no correction for extinction , which attenuates [ oii ] more than h@xmath1 , the [ oii]-derived sfrs in these galaxies would be over twice the rate derived from h@xmath1 .",
    "our finding that the [ oii ] line can be significantly contaminated bolster the results of koc09a , who reported that a large fraction of the agns in the cl1604 supercluster appear to be associated with recently quenched hosts .",
    "a major caveat in that study was the assumption that the observed [ oii ] emission in the spectra of these galaxies was due to agn activity and not ongoing star formation .",
    "we have now demonstrated conclusively that this assumption is supported by our new observations .",
    "this finding provides significant insight into the nature of these systems . in the absence of substantial star formation",
    ", the properties of these galaxies generally agree with agn feedback scenarios in which agn - driven outflows rapidly suppress the star formation activity of their hosts .",
    "for example , the high incidence of balmer lines in the spectra of the cl1604 hosts implies that the last major episode of star formation in many of these galaxies was truncated within the last @xmath31 gyr .",
    "furthermore , these galaxies have optical colors that place them between the red sequence of early - type galaxies and the blue cloud of star - forming objects , while their morphologies show tell - tale signs of interactions in the recent past , including fading tidal features and multiple nuclei . in most regards ,",
    "these galaxies resemble a transition population within the cl1604 structure that have been caught in the process of transforming from actively star - forming galaxies to passively evolving systems . the fact that a large fraction of agns within the cl1604 supercluster show such signatures , coupled with recent findings that high - redshift agns are more common in denser environments than they are in the field ( gilli et al 2003 ; cappelluti et al 2005 ; eastman et al .",
    "2007 ; kocevski et al .",
    "2009b ) , suggests that agn - related feedback may play an important role in accelerating galaxy evolution in large - scale structures at high redshift .",
    "we have used emission - line ratios measured from deimos and nirspec spectroscopy to determine the origin of the [ oii ] emission line observed in six agn hosts at @xmath0 .",
    "these six galaxies are a subsample of nine agns detected in the cl1604 supercluster that exhibit strong balmer absorption lines in their spectra .",
    "if not for the presence of the [ oii ] line , many of these galaxies would be classified as post - starburst or post - quenched systems .",
    "examining the flux ratio of the [ nii ] to h@xmath1 lines , we find that in five of the six agn hosts the dominant source of ionizing flux is agn continuum emission and not radiation from young stellar populations .",
    "furthermore , we find that four of the six galaxies have , on average , over twice the [ oii ] line luminosity that could be generated by star formation processes alone given their h@xmath1 line luminosities .",
    "this strongly suggests that agn excited narrow - line emission is contaminating the [ oii ] line flux .",
    "a comparison of sfrs calculated from the [ oii ] and h@xmath1 line luminosities indicates that the former yields a five - fold overestimate of the star formation activity of these galaxies .",

    "this has important ramifications on the study of post - starburst and recently quenched agn hosts at high redshifts .",
