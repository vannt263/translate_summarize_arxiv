    "<S> the finite nuclear - size effect on the leading bound - electron @xmath0 factor and the one - loop qed corrections to the bound - electron @xmath0 factor is investigated for the ground state of hydrogen - like ions . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation is performed to all orders in the nuclear binding strength parameter @xmath1 ( where @xmath2 is the nuclear charge and @xmath3 is the fine structure constant ) and for the fermi model of the nuclear charge distribution . in the result , </S>",
    "<S> theoretical predictions for the isotope shift of the @xmath4 bound - electron @xmath0 factor are obtained , which can be used for the determination of the difference of nuclear charge radii from experimental values of the bound - electron @xmath0 factors for different isotopes .    </S>",
    "<S> significant progress has been achieved during the last two decades in the experimental determination of the bound - electron @xmath0 factor in hydrogen - like ( and lithium - like ) ions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the current experimental precision is on the level of few parts in @xmath5 and is likely to be improved further in the future . </S>",
    "<S> comparison between the experimental and theoretical results constituted a highly sensitive test of bound - state qed theory @xcite and led to an accurate determination of the electron mass @xcite . in future , such experiments </S>",
    "<S> can also provide us with a new method of determination of other important parameters , in particular , the fine - structure constant @xcite and nuclear magnetic moments @xcite .    in the present work , </S>",
    "<S> we investigate one of the possibilities opened by the high - precision @xmath0 factor experiments , namely , a possibility to determine the nuclear charge radius or the difference of the nuclear charge radii of two isotopes . </S>",
    "<S> a proof - of - the - principle determination of the charge radius of @xmath6si has already been reported in the recent @xmath0-factor measurement @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the nuclear charge distribution effect will play a much more significant role when the planned extension of the @xmath0-factor measurements to higher-@xmath2 systems @xcite takes place .    at the present level of theory , </S>",
    "<S> the direct determination of the nuclear charge radius is restricted by the theoretical uncertainty due to the two - loop qed effects @xcite . in order to avoid this restriction </S>",
    "<S> , it might be advantageous to study the isotopic difference of the bound - electron @xmath0 factor values . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical description of the isotope shift of the @xmath0 factors is much simpler than that of the @xmath0 factor itself , as many corrections ( in particular , the dominant part of the two - loop qed effects ) do not depend on nuclear properties and cancel in the difference . </S>",
    "<S> the first experimental determination of the isotopic shift of the bound - electron @xmath0 factor is currently underway for a calcium ion @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the goal of the present work is to perform a detailed investigation of the finite nuclear - size effect on the leading bound - electron @xmath0 factor and on the one - loop qed corrections to the @xmath0 factor . </S>",
    "<S> the results obtained , combined with the previously reported data on the nuclear recoil correction , allow one to deduce accurate values for the nuclear - dependent part of the @xmath4 bound - electron @xmath0 factor and , therefore , the isotope shift of the @xmath0 factor .    the remaining paper is organized as follows . in the next section , we discuss the nuclear - size correction to the leading - order bound - electron @xmath0 factor . in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sec:2 ] , we calculate the nuclear - size effect on the self - energy and vacuum - polarization corrections to the @xmath0 factor . numerical results and experimental consequences are summarized and discussed in sec .  </S>",
