    "the conventional sketch of galaxy formation has its roots in classic papers of the late 70s and early 80s , with initial discussions of collapse and cooling criteria by @xcite and @xcite , the addition of dark matter halos by @xcite , and the disk formation model of @xcite . according to this sketch , gas falling into a dark matter potential",
    "well is shock heated to approximately the halo virial temperature , @xmath6 , putting it in quasi - hydrostatic equilibrium with the dark matter .",
    "gas in the dense , inner regions of this shock heated halo radiates its thermal energy , loses its pressure support , settles into a centrifugally supported disk , and forms stars .",
    "mergers of disks can scatter stars onto disordered orbits , producing spheroidal systems , which may regrow disks if they experience subsequent gas accretion . over the last decade ,",
    "the ideas of these seminal papers have been updated and extended into a powerful `` semi - analytic '' framework for galaxy formation calculations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the geometry seen in n - body and hydrodynamic cosmological simulations , where the densest structures often form at the nodes of a filamentary network , is clearly more complicated than the spherical geometry underlying semi - analytic calculations .",
    "nonetheless , a substantial fraction of the gas in these simulations does shock heat to @xmath7 , and some of this gas does cool and settle into galaxies .",
    "the approximate agreement between semi - analytic models and smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) calculations of galaxy masses ( e.g. , @xcite ) has therefore been taken as evidence that the conventional sketch , while idealised , captures most of the essential physics . in this paper , we use sph simulations of cosmological volumes to argue that this sketch requires an important revision : roughly half of the gas accreted by the simulated galaxies is never shock heated close to the halo virial temperature ( @xmath0 for a milky way type galaxy ) but instead radiates its acquired gravitational energy from @xmath8 ( often @xmath9 ) .",
    "this `` cold mode '' of gas accretion dominates for lower mass galaxies ( baryon mass @xmath10 ) , while the conventional , `` hot mode '' of gas accretion dominates the growth of high mass systems . as a result",
    ", `` cold mode '' accretion dominates at high redshift ( @xmath11 ) and in low density environments today , while `` hot mode '' accretion dominates in group and cluster environments at low redshift .",
    "there is , in fact , a long history of results suggesting that cold accretion could be an important element of galaxy formation .",
    "binney ( 1977 ) , using analytic models of proto - galaxy collapse , argued that the amount of shock heating could be small for plausible physical conditions , with only a fraction of the gas reaching temperatures @xmath12 . in the first sph simulations of forming galaxies ( katz & gunn 1991 ) , which had idealised initial conditions but included small scale power leading to hierarchical formation",
    ", most of the gas never heated above @xmath13 , with much of the cooling radiation therefore emerging in the ly@xmath14 line . @xcite and @xcite showed the importance of filamentary structures as channels for gas accretion in simulations with cold dark matter ( cdm ) initial conditions .",
    "recent studies based on sph simulations of cosmological volumes reveal the situation even more starkly .",
    "fardal et al .",
    "( 2001 ) showed that most of the cooling radiation in their simulations comes from gas with @xmath15 , again implying that a significant fraction emerges in the ly@xmath14 line .",
    "since gas starting at @xmath16 _ must _ radiate 90% of its thermal energy by the time it cools to @xmath17 , @xcite concluded that the majority of the gas entering galaxies ( indeed , the majority of the gas experiencing any significant cooling ) must not be heated to the virial temperature of any dark matter halo resolved by the simulation .",
    "kay et al .  ( 2000 ) directly tracked the temperature histories of particles that ended up in their simulated galaxies and found that only 11% of these particles were ever heated to a temperature above @xmath18 .",
    "motivated by these results , we here investigate the temperature histories of accreted gas particles as a function of galaxy mass , redshift , and environment , thoroughly quantifying the relative importance of the cold and hot modes of gas accretion in our sph simulations .",
    "we use several simulations to demonstrate the insensitivity of our primary conclusions to numerical resolution over a wide dynamic range .",
    "we reported initial results from our study in @xcite . @xcite",
    "have investigated similar issues with a complementary approach based on high resolution , spherically symmetric collapse calculations .",
    "they find that a virial shock fails to develop if the gas cooling time is shorter than the local dynamical time , so in these cases gas shells fall far inside the halo virial radius without ever being heated to high temperature .",
    "@xcite show that the cooling time condition corresponds approximately to a threshold in the galaxy s halo mass , with little dependence on redshift .",
    "as we will show in  [ sec : results ] below , our results are in quite good agreement with birnboim & dekel s , despite the radically different approaches .",
    "traditional semi - analytic models also distinguish between halos with rapid post - shock cooling and halos with slow post - shock cooling ( e.g. , @xcite ) , though the distinction has received relatively little attention in discussions of these models , and heating to the virial temperature is assumed in either case . in quantitative terms , we find that cold accretion plays a much larger role in our simulations than rapid - cooling accretion plays in standard semi - analytic calculations ( see  [ sec : disc_sf ] and the appendix ) .",
    "in addition to being an important aspect of the physics of galaxy formation , the existence of distinct cold and hot modes of gas accretion could have interesting observational implications .",
    "@xcite emphasised one of these implications : cold accretion allows much of the cooling radiation associated with galaxy formation to emerge in the ly@xmath14  line instead of the x - ray continuum ( see also @xcite ) . a reduced role for",
    "hot accretion might help explain why diffuse x - ray emission from late - type galaxy halos is well below the predictions of standard semi - analytic calculations @xcite .",
    "a second class of implications relates to the cosmic star formation history .",
    "murali et al .",
    "( @xcite ; hereafter mkhwd ) show that galaxies in sph simulations , like the ones analysed here , gain most of their mass through smooth accretion of gas , not through mergers with pre - existing galaxies ( at least not galaxies above the simulation s resolution limit ) .",
    "they further find that the global history of star formation tracks the global history of gas accretion rather than the merger history . in subsequent analysis",
    ", we have found that these generalisations hold fairly well on a galaxy - by - galaxy basis ( maller et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "thus , understanding gas accretion is nearly tantamount to understanding the history of star formation , at least in the simulations .",
    "the cosmic star formation history inferred from near - uv luminosity functions declines sharply between @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "while semi - analytic models and hydrodynamic simulations both predict a drop in the global star formation rate ( sfr ) over this redshift interval , it is difficult to explain the full order - of - magnitude reduction implied by the data @xcite . without an _ ad hoc _ fix",
    ", semi - analytic and numerical calculations also predict continuing gas accretion and star formation in old , massive galaxies , so they have difficulty reproducing the `` red envelope '' of the observed galaxy population as a function of redshift ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "of course , partitioning the accretion into cold and hot modes does not , in itself , change the simulation predictions , but it may illuminate the physics behind the predicted drop in the sfr and explain differences between numerical and semi - analytic results .",
    "the declining sfr is frequently attributed to the longer cooling times in the hotter , lower density halos that prevail at low redshift ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but the efficiency of cold accretion could be strongly affected by other factors .",
    "furthermore , stellar or agn feedback , or heat conduction , could have different effects on the cold and hot accretion modes , since the incoming gas has different geometry and density .",
    "allowing for such a difference in theoretical models could have interesting observational consequences , since the relative importance of cold and hot accretion depends on redshift , environment , and galaxy mass .",
    "the sensitivity of cold and hot accretion rates to environment could also play a role in explaining the well known morphology - density relation ( e.g. , @xcite ) and the associated correlation between galaxy sfr and local density ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "mergers , ram pressure stripping , @xcite , galaxy `` harassment '' by weak perturbations in clusters @xcite , truncation of gas supplies @xcite , and longer cooling times in hotter environments @xcite may all contribute to the origin of these correlations .",
    "however , environmental effects that shut off cold accretion flows could suppress star formation and disk growth , and they might explain why transitions in galaxy properties appear to start well beyond the virial radii of groups and clusters @xcite .",
    "@xcite find a clear transition in galaxy properties at a baryonic mass @xmath21 , with lower mass galaxies having active star formation , low surface mass density , and a disk morphology while higher mass galaxies have old stellar populations , high surface mass density , and a bulge - dominated morphology .",
    "the transition that we find between galaxies dominated by cold accretion and galaxies dominated by hot accretion occurs at a similar mass scale and could be connected to this broader transition in galaxy properties .",
    "after briefly describing our simulations and analysis methods in  [ sec : methods ] , we present our basic results on the global significance and mass dependence of cold and hot accretion in  [ sec : results ] .",
    "we assess the numerical robustness of these results in  [ sec : numerical ] , in particular comparing different simulations to show that cold mode gas accretion is found in simulations with a large dynamic range in mass resolution .",
    "we investigate the dependence of the cold and hot accretion rates and the corresponding star formation rates on galaxy environment in  [ sec : environment ] , including a comparison of the predicted correlations between sfr and environment to the @xcite observations . in ",
    "[ sec : discussion ] we describe our current physical understanding of the cold and hot accretion modes and discuss some of the potential implications mentioned above .",
    "we summarise our conclusions in  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we adopt an inflationary cold dark matter model dominated by a cosmological constant , @xmath22cdm , with @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and a primordial power spectrum index @xmath26 . for the amplitude of mass fluctuations we use @xmath27 ,",
    "which for our adopted parameters is consistent both with cobe normalisation using cmbfast @xcite and with the observed abundance of rich clusters @xcite . for the baryonic density",
    "we adopt @xmath28 , a value consistent both with the deuterium abundance in high redshift lyman limit systems @xcite and the value derived from cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy measurements @xcite .",
    "our values of @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 are close to those inferred by recent joint analysis of cmb anisotropy measurements from wmap ( @xcite ) and galaxy clustering data from the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ; @xcite ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) , while our assumed @xmath32 is higher by about @xmath33 .",
    "we have recently repeated one of our runs using the parameter values implied by the wmap analysis of @xcite , and preliminary investigation shows results similar to those reported here .",
    "our primary results are derived from a simulation that models a 22.222@xmath34 comoving periodic cube using @xmath35 dark matter particles and @xmath35 gas particles .",
    "gravitational forces are softened using a cubic spline kernel of comoving radius @xmath36 , approximately equivalent to a plummer force softening of @xmath37 .",
    "our baryonic mass threshold for resolved galaxies ( see  [ sec : skid ] ) is @xmath38 , the mass of 64 gas particles , and there are 1120 galaxies in the box above this threshold at @xmath20 . to approximately match our galaxy mass scale to an observed luminosity scale , we note that the @xcite @xmath39-band luminosity function yields a space density of @xmath40 for galaxies brighter than the characteristic luminosity @xmath41 of a @xcite function fit .",
    "the baryonic mass threshold that yields the same space density in our simulation is @xmath42 , so if we identify this mass with @xmath41 and assume that luminosity is approximately proportional to mass , our resolution threshold corresponds roughly to @xmath43 .",
    "we draw on six additional simulations to investigate the influence of mass resolution and the presence of a uv background field on our results .",
    "parameters of all the simulations are listed in table  [ tbl : sims ] .",
    "a simulation of comoving box length @xmath44 and @xmath45 particles is designated l@xmath46 ; thus , our primary simulation is l22/128 .",
    "most of the simulations were run with a photoionizing uv background ( see below ) ; those that were not are designated `` nb '' for `` no background . ''",
    "the full suite of simulations  l50/144nb , l22/128 , l22/64nb , l11/64 , l11/64nb , l11/128 , l5.5/128  spans a factor of 512 in mass resolution .",
    "however , the highest resolution simulations ( l11/128 and l5.5/128 ) have been evolved only to @xmath47 , and the lowest resolution simulations have no uv background .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we conclude that the finite time resolution in our analysis may cause errors of @xmath48 in our estimates of global cold and hot accretion fractions .",
    "this weak dependence on time resolution makes sense if we ask how far inside a halo a particle needs to be to get shock heated and cool before the next output redshift , and thus be misidentified as cold accretion .",
    "our regular analysis interval is @xmath49gyr at low redshifts and @xmath50gyr at high redshifts .",
    "table  2 lists the time required for gas to cool from @xmath51 or @xmath52 ( typical halo virial temperatures ) down to @xmath18 , at various redshifts and overdensities .",
    "we compute these times by integrating over the actual cooling function . for our standard time interval ,",
    "a particle heated to @xmath52 can not cool to @xmath53 between two redshift outputs unless its overdensity is greater than 500 , corresponding to less than 1/3 of the virial radius for an isothermal halo . for a particle heated to @xmath54",
    "the cooling time at overdensity 500 is comparable to our standard time interval , which means that the cooling time at the virial radius is much longer than the time interval between our simulation outputs . for our finer time interval",
    ", a shock heated particle would only cool between two outputs for an overdensity of several thousand , requiring it to be very close to the galaxy s cold baryon component .",
    "= 0.8    the most serious numerical concern is that our basic result , the existence of a cold accretion mode that makes a major contribution to galaxy formation , is somehow an artifact of the simulations finite mass resolution .",
    "for example , numerical broadening of shocks might allow gas to radiate energy while it is passing through the shock , instead of first heating and then cooling @xcite .",
    "we can address this issue by comparing simulations with different mass resolution to check the stability of the results .",
    "the top panels of figure  [ fig : resolution ] compare the @xmath55 distributions of gas accreted at @xmath47 and @xmath56 in the l22/128 simulation and the higher resolution , l11/128 simulation .",
    "in l11/128 , we only consider the accretion onto galaxies above the @xmath38 resolution limit of l22/128 .",
    "these objects are resolved by at least 512 gas and star particles in l11/128 . despite the factor of eight difference in mass resolution ,",
    "the two histograms agree nearly perfectly at @xmath56 , and they show only modest differences at @xmath47 .",
    "since the simulation volumes are also different , we expect some differences between these simulations just because of the different structures they contain .",
    "the lower panels of figure  [ fig : resolution ] compare the l11/128 and l11/64 simulations , which have identical initial conditions ( except for the additional high frequency modes in l11/128 ) and differ only in mass resolution .",
    "the change of simulation volume slightly improves the agreement at @xmath47 , but it appears that most of the difference between l22/128 and l11/128 is an effect of resolution rather than simulation volume .",
    "higher resolution lowers the overall gas accretion rate by @xmath57 .",
    "some of the gas accreted in the lower resolution simulation is converted into stars within galaxies below the resolution limit of the lower resolution simulation , but that are resolved in the higher resolution simulation , before it is accreted onto a galaxy above the 512-particle threshold .",
    "this can explain a significant part of the differences in the cold mode accretion rates .",
    "however , numerical resolution effects on the gas cooling are probably responsible for most of the differences in the hot mode accretion rates and the remaining cold mode differences .",
    "these numerical effects must depend on the galactic mass , since at @xmath56 , where galaxies are significantly smaller on average , the differences are smaller . since the difference between l22/128 and l11/128 is fairly small and mainly attributable to mass resolution , we conclude that the volume of the l22/128 simulation is large enough to give reasonably accurate statistics on the cold and hot accretion fractions , at least at @xmath47 .",
    "= 1.0    our most powerful test of numerical convergence comes from examining the galaxy mass dependence of the cold accretion fraction , as shown for the l22/128 simulation in figure  [ fig : mass_ratio ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : big_galaxy]a repeats the @xmath47 panel of figure  [ fig : mass_ratio ] , and figure  [ fig : big_galaxy]b shows the same result for the l11/128 simulation .",
    "while the higher resolution simulation contains few high mass galaxies because of its small volume , the transition between cold and hot mode domination occurs at @xmath58 , close to the transition in l22/128 .",
    "our highest resolution simulation , l5.5/128 , contains only nine galaxies above the l22/128 mass resolution limit at @xmath47 ( and only one at @xmath56 ) , so a comparison of similar form is not very useful .",
    "however , we can check the mass dependence of the cold accretion fraction by following the largest ( and thus best resolved ) galaxy in the simulation volume .",
    "figure  [ fig : big_galaxy]c plots the cold and hot accretion fractions of this largest galaxy as it grows from @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) at @xmath61 to @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) at @xmath47 , the redshift of our last simulation output .",
    "the transition between hot and cold mode dominance occurs close to the @xmath56 output , when the galaxy mass is @xmath58 .",
    "this agrees well with the transition mass at @xmath47 found in l11/128 and l22/128 ( and agrees even better with the @xmath56 transition mass , which is @xmath64 for l22/128 ) .",
    "the second most massive galaxy in l5.5/128 does not reach the cold / hot transition mass until @xmath47 , the final output , so it is not useful for this test .",
    "the agreement in transition mass over simulations that span a factor of 64 in mass resolution is the strongest single piece of evidence that the importance of cold accretion in our simulations is not an artifact of limited resolution .",
    "figure  [ fig : uv_nouv]a illustrates the impact of the uv background on @xmath55 distributions , comparing results from l11/64 and l11/64nb at @xmath47 .",
    "the no - background simulation shows a somewhat reduced hot mode , and the cold accretion is sharply peaked at @xmath65 .",
    "the uv background is the only difference between these two simulations .",
    "the different amplitude and shape of the histogram at low @xmath55 is therefore driven by the difference in input physics , most likely the fact that photoionization reduces the strength of the collisional line peak in the cooling curve at moderate overdensity ( see kwh , fig .  2 ) .",
    "the transition mass at which cold and hot accretion rates are equal is consistently higher in simulations with no uv background , increasing the global contribution of cold accretion .",
    "l22/128 is the highest resolution simulation we have evolved to @xmath20 .",
    "all of our lower resolution simulations have been evolved without a uv background , because photoionization at low mass resolution spuriously suppresses galaxy formation @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : uv_nouv]b compares the @xmath20 @xmath55 histograms from l22/128 , l22/64nb , and l50/144nb .",
    "we now consider only the accretion onto galaxies above the 64-particle threshold of the lower resolution simulations , @xmath66 , which is higher than the cold / hot transition mass of @xmath67 found for l22/128 at @xmath20 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : mass_ratio ] ) . as a result of this higher threshold mass ,",
    "the low temperature end of the @xmath55 histogram for l22/128 is strongly suppressed relative to the corresponding histogram in figure  [ fig : diff_acc_ns ] .",
    "the no - background simulations , by contrast , show a significant amount of cold accretion , with @xmath55 values peaked just above @xmath68 .",
    "although the simulations differ in both numerical parameters and input physics , the similarity to figure  [ fig : uv_nouv]a implies that the uv background is the cause of this difference .",
    "the l22/64nb and l50/144nb simulations also show significantly more hot accretion at @xmath20 than l22/128 ; a similar effect is seen at @xmath47 ( not plotted ) . here",
    "we suspect that the coarse resolution of the no - background simulations is to blame , since photoionization has minimal effect on cooling at high temperatures and the differences are similar to those seen in figures  [ fig : resolution]a and  [ fig : resolution]c ( at @xmath47 ) .",
    "finally , we note that the reasonably good agreement between l22/64nb and l50/144nb suggests that the @xmath69 box is large enough to give representative statistics for the cold / hot fraction even at @xmath20 , except perhaps at very large @xmath55 .",
    "= 0.8      within our own set of simulations , we find that the existence of an important cold accretion mode is insensitive to mass resolution or simulation volume , though the specifics of the @xmath55 distribution are significantly affected by the presence of a uv background .",
    "sph simulations of the formation of individual galaxies achieve still higher resolution , with thousands of particles in the central object , and they also show a large fraction of cold accretion @xcite .",
    "further evidence of the robustness of the result comes from simulations of volumes like those considered here performed with entirely independent sph codes .",
    "@xcite , studying a @xmath70 particle simulation of a @xmath71 box performed by the virgo consortium , find that only @xmath72 of the gas accreted by their simulated galaxies by @xmath20 was ever hotter than @xmath18 .",
    "we have recently analysed a simulation , kindly provided by l.  hernquist and v.  springel , that uses springel & hernquist s ( @xcite ) entropy conserving formulation of sph , which makes the numerical treatment of shock heating significantly different from that in our code .",
    "this simulation , run q3 of @xcite , represents a @xmath71 box with @xmath73 particles , and is evolved to @xmath74 .",
    "the simulation also includes strong feedback from stellar winds , using the methods described by @xcite . despite these differences in numerical method and input physics",
    ", the @xcite simulation produces a @xmath55 histogram at high redshifts that closely resembles those shown in figure  [ fig : diff_acc_ns ] , with a large fraction of gas accretion occurring at low temperatures .",
    "the transition between cold mode dominance and hot mode dominance occurs at a halo mass similar to that found in figure  [ fig : mass_ratio_halo ] .",
    "however , the strong feedback makes galaxy baryonic masses significantly smaller in the @xcite simulation than in our simulation ( numerical differences may also play a role ) , so the baryonic mass at which this transition occurs is lower than that in figure  [ fig : mass_ratio ] by a factor @xmath75 . in sum ,",
    "galaxy masses and the amount of accretion are lower in the @xcite simulation , but the existence of a cold accretion mode and the relative amounts of cold and hot accretion at a given halo mass appear entirely consistent with our results .",
    "these internal and external comparisons strongly suggest that the bimodal @xmath55 histogram is a genuine physical result , at least given the physical assumptions of these simulations .",
    "since the results quoted above are all based on sph simulations , albeit with different numerical implementations , it would be desirable to confirm the result with eulerian grid or adaptive mesh hydro simulations , which typically use shock capturing methods instead of artificial viscosity to implement shock heating .",

    "a. kravstov ( private communication ) , in adaptive mesh simulations of individual forming galaxies , finds that much of the gas penetrates along cold filaments far inside the virial radius without being shock heated .",
    "these simulations can not presently measure the @xmath55 histogram itself because they do not track gas from cell to cell and therefore do not record the history of gas that ends up in galaxies , but this measurement can be carried out in the future by adding a population of `` tracer '' particles that follows the gas flow ( kravtsov , private communication ) .",

    ", galaxies that gain most of their mass via mergers do exist in the simulation , but the growth of the typical galaxy is dominated by smooth accretion .",

    "the two curves are offset by @xmath78 gyr , reflecting the average time that it takes gas to be converted into stars after it is accreted by a galaxy .",
    "however , with our observationally motivated assumption ( e.g. , @xcite ) that the star formation rate is an increasing function of gas density , any steadily accreting galaxy will form stars , and mergers are not needed as triggering events . indeed , the global star formation rate must roughly track the global accretion rate for any star formation model in which galaxies do not build up large , quiescent gas supplies .",
    "mergers could play a role in causing rapid bursts of star formation by driving galactic gas to higher densities , and our simulations may underestimate this effect because of their limited resolution .",
    "however , such merger - induced acceleration would have little effect on the globally averaged sfr because the merging galaxies simply consume the same amount of gas on a somewhat shorter timescale .",
    "if our input physics is approximately correct , then understanding the redshift and environmental dependence of the cold and hot accretion rates is tantamount to understanding the redshift and environmental dependence of galactic scale star formation . in this section",

    "these trends can be largely explained by the galaxy mass dependence of the cold / hot accretion fraction : low density regions are populated by lower mass galaxies , which tend to have more cold accretion . however , when we examine the trends separately for low and high mass galaxies , we find that there is also a direct environmental effect , in that low mass galaxies are often hot mode dominated in high density environments , while they are always cold mode dominated in low density environments .",

    ". some of the difference between low and high mass halos could be numerical in origin , but we believe that it primarily reflects a more isotropic nature of cold accretion in low mass systems .",
    "= 0.8    from these clues , we can build the following picture of cold accretion . as argued by @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "accreting gas with short cooling times does not form a classic virial shock  its effective equation of state is too soft , and it passes through the virial radius essentially in free fall . in the spherically symmetric models of @xcite , there is a sharp transition between low mass halos that do not have a virial shock and high mass halos that do , with the approximate condition being that a virial shock arises if the post - shock cooling time would be larger than the dynamical time .",
    "the important new ingredient highlighted by the simulations is the filamentary nature of cold accretion .",
    "departures from spherical symmetry allow galaxies to have a mix of cold and hot accretion at one time , so the sharp transition of the @xcite models is replaced by a steady change from cold mode domination at low mass to hot mode domination at high mass .",
    "a low mass galaxy has no virial shock anywhere , so it can accrete cold gas quasi - spherically , though filaments still channel much of the flow .",
    "an intermediate mass galaxy has a virial shock everywhere except at the points where dense filaments of cold gas penetrate the virial radius .",
    "these galaxies have a mix of cold , filamentary accretion and hot , quasi - spherical accretion .",
    "gas in denser regions of the igm is more likely to join a filament before accreting onto a galaxy , explaining the difference of density histories in figure  [ fig : avgrhot ] .",
    "finally , high mass galaxies have a virial shock everywhere and have only hot accretion .",
    "the characteristic halo mass at which we find equal cold and hot accretion rates , @xmath138 , is a factor @xmath139 larger than the transition mass calculated by @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite show that the derived transition mass depends on the precise criterion they use , in particular the radius at which they require a shock to form . for low metallicity gas",
    ", they find a transition mass @xmath140 for a shock at @xmath141 and @xmath142 for a shock at @xmath94 , though the addition of a uv background ( as used here ) would lower cooling rates and probably reduce these masses .",
    "given the radical difference in calculational methods , the agreement between the sph simulations and the spherically symmetric models is remarkably good , pointing to similar underlying physics .",
    "semi - analytic models of galaxy formation distinguish between accretion with long post - shock cooling times , in which the cooling radius is smaller than the halo virial radius , and accretion with rapid post - shock cooling , in which the cooling radius exceeds the virial radius @xcite . in both cases , the cooling time is calculated assuming shock heating to the virial temperature , but in the latter case",
    "the gas is assumed to accrete onto the central galaxy at the free - fall rate instead of first forming a hot atmosphere in quasi - hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "we have calculated the halo mass that marks the transition between these two cases for our adopted cosmology and cooling function , including the effects of the uv background .",
    "we calculate cooling radii assuming that halo gas follows an nfw density profile @xcite reduced by @xmath143 , and we take typical concentrations as a function of redshift from @xcite .",
    "if we define the cooling radius to be the radius at which the cooling time equals @xmath144 , the age of the universe at redshift @xmath145 , then we find a transition mass @xmath146 at @xmath147 , roughly 2 to 4 times lower than the transition mass found in our simulations .",
    "at @xmath148 there is no transition mass at all ; in the presence of a uv background , the cooling radius never exceeds the virial radius at the lower densities that prevail in low redshift halos .",
    "if we use either the freefall time or average dynamical time of the halo to define the cooling radius then the transition mass at high redshift is reduced by another factor of two to four , and there is no transition mass at @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "thus , while the cooling radius transition in existing semi - analytic models bears a qualitative resemblance to the cold - hot transition identified in this paper , a standard calculation of this transition yields a result that is quantitatively different and underestimates the significance of cold accretion ( see the appendix for details of our calculation ) .",
    "the transition mass goes up if one ignores the uv background ( thus raising the cooling rates ) or assumes an @xmath151 gas density profile ( thus raising the density at the virial radius ) , but the first of these assumptions ignores a physical process present in the simulation , and dark matter profiles , at least , are much better described by nfw profiles than by isothermal spheres .",
    "the cooling radius approach also fails to capture the filamentary nature of cold accretion , and because the cooling radius is calculated assuming virial temperature gas , it implicitly predicts that most of the emission from even rapidly cooling gas will be at the x - ray wavelengths characteristic of these temperatures , while in the simulations this gas radiates much of its energy in atomic line transitions , hydrogen ly@xmath14 in particular @xcite .",
    "the exact amount of radiated ly@xmath14 emission , however , needs further investigation , since it could be partially affected by the numerical broadening of shocks .",
    "one question remains : how does cold mode gas actually enter a galaxy ?",
    "our ability to answer this question is limited because our simulations do not have good enough resolution at the relevant scales , but we know that gravitational infall to galaxy mass potential wells produces typical inflow velocities of @xmath152 , and something must happen to the corresponding kinetic energy .",
    "( the simulation code conserves energy , so it can not be lost to numerical effects . )",
    "we can identify three possibilities , all of which may operate to some degree .",
    "first , gas could penetrate inside the virial radius but be stopped by a strong shock close to the galaxy disk , heating to the virial temperature and converting its infall energy to thermal energy .",
    "the post - shock cooling time is then very short because the gas density near the disk is high . some particles in our simulations exhibit exactly this behaviour , and a. kravtsov s adaptive mesh simulations also show shock heating far inside the virial radius at the terminations of cold filamentary flows ( a.  kravtsov , private communication ) .",
    "the lower left panel of figure  [ fig : filament ] shows some examples of such particles , with temperatures near @xmath110 in a quasi- spherical region of several kpc around the central galaxy .",
    "we formally count such particles as hot mode accretion , since they have a high @xmath55 , but physically they are more analogous to cold mode particles , since they do not shock heat near the virial radius . because of our finite time resolution , we miss the heating events for some of these particles and actually count them as cold mode .",
    "however , we think it is unlikely that _ most _ of the particles we identify as cold mode experience this kind of strong shock heating near the galaxy disk , in part because improving the time resolution makes only a small difference to the fraction of cold mode particles (  [ sec : tint ] ) and in part because of the cooling radiation arguments of @xcite : the total amount of energy radiated by accreting gas is of order the gravitational binding energy , and a large fraction of this energy emerges from low temperature gas . however , it is possible that high density accretion shocks near the forming disk are more common in the real universe and are missed in our simulations because of their finite spatial resolution .",
    "a second possibility is that cold mode gas smoothly merges onto the galaxy disk like a stream of cars entering an expressway , converting its infall velocity to rotational velocity .",
    "this idea may seem outlandish at first , but the disk acquires its angular momentum from the accreting gas , so the required alignment of the disk with the accretion flow may arise naturally .",
    "the large scale filamentary structure around galaxies persists for long periods of time , especially at high redshifts where the galaxies are highly biased with respect to the dark matter . a close examination of galaxies in our highest resolution simulation provides some evidence for this expressway mechanism , as one can see visually in the lower left panel of figure  [ fig : filament ] , but further analysis will be needed to assess its overall importance . in any event",
    ", the virial theorem suggests that this mechanism could provide only part of the energetic solution , since the galaxy s rotational energy should be smaller than its gravitational binding energy .",
    "( note , however , that the virial theorem can not be applied with precision to non - isolated , time - dependent systems like forming galaxies , and the bookkeeping is further complicated by the fact that dark matter dominates the gravitational potential . )    the third possibility is that infalling cold mode gas is slowed either adiabatically ( i.e. , by pressure gradients ) or in a series of shocks that are individually too weak to cause strong heating .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig : velocities ] plots the average radial infall velocity of cold mode gas , scaled to the halo circular velocity , as a function of @xmath153 .",
    "we only consider cold mode gas that will be accreted onto the central galaxies by the next indicated redshift .",
    "we define the central galaxy as the most massive galaxy in the halo , which is almost always the galaxy closest to the halo center .",
    "we show results at @xmath47 ( dashed line , accreted by @xmath119 ) , @xmath119 ( solid line , accreted by @xmath154 ) and @xmath154 ( dotted line , accreted by @xmath20 ) . near the virial radius ,",
    "the average infall velocity is similar to the halo circular velocity , but starting at @xmath155 the gas decelerates smoothly , and by @xmath156 the average infall velocity is only 10 - 20% of the circular velocity . the mean infall pattern is similar at all three redshifts , with the trend that the normalised velocities are lower at lower redshifts .",
    "there is a large scatter about the mean velocity , so some accreting particles must either shock heat near the disk or join the rotational flow as discussed above . however , based on figure  [ fig : velocities ] , we tentatively conclude that deceleration by pressure gradients or weak shocks is the primary mechanism by which cold mode gas loses its infall velocity , at least in the simulations , radiating its dissipated energy as it slows .",
    "artificial cooling of gas in numerically broadened shocks ( see  [ sec : numconv ] ) could have some effect on this result , at least in its quantitative details .",
    "= 0.8    in contrast , the right panel of figure  [ fig : velocities ] shows the situation for hot mode particles .",
    "we see that hot mode accretion more closely resembles the standard picture where the gas slows rapidly at a shock near the virial radius however , the zone where the gas slows down is significantly inside the virial radius at @xmath47 ( at about 0.6@xmath94 ) and moves steadily towards @xmath94 by @xmath20 .",
    "furthermore , this zone is fairly broad , and the post - shock gas still has a mean radial velocity that is a significant fraction of @xmath157 , especially at high @xmath145 .",
    "these complications reflect the departures from spherical symmetry and equilibrium discussed in  [ sec : disc_hot ] .",
    "although hot accretion shows no significant filamentary signal in fig  [ fig : scalar_product ] , from visual inspection we see that even in some of the biggest halos at high redshift a large fraction of the accreted gas comes from filaments .",
    "filaments in these halos are hot ( with temperatures well above the cold mode limit ) but with temperatures much lower than @xmath110 .",
    "these filaments and mergers can deliver hot gas ( as well as cold ) well inside @xmath94 , with significant radial velocity .",
    "halos at low redshift have better developed virial shocks and clearer separations from their filamentary surroundings , and the standard picture becomes a better approximation .",
    "further numerical investigations should significantly improve our physical understanding of cold accretion . @xcite and",

    "[ fig : history ] we see that both the cold and hot accretion rates decline at @xmath159 , with the cold mode decrease starting earlier and occurring more rapidly . as already discussed in ",
    "[ sec : results ] , the transition in the global accretion rate from cold mode dominated at high redshift to hot mode dominated at low redshift simply reflects the increasing mass scale of galaxies and halos , since low mass systems are cold mode dominated and high mass systems are hot mode dominated at every redshift .",

    "most of the decline in cold mode accretion must therefore be driven by the declining accretion rate per galaxy , as shown directly in figure  [ fig : rates ] , which plots the average gas accretion rate onto the central galaxy in halos of different masses as a function of redshift . for halos in the mass range @xmath161 , which is cold mode dominated at every redshift , the mean accretion rate per galaxy drops by a factor of @xmath162 between @xmath119 and @xmath20 , accounting for the drop in the global cold mode accretion rate .",

    "at high redshifts the analytical model underpredicts the accretion rate by a factor @xmath115 , for at least two reasons .",
    "first , much of the accretion is filamentary , allowing halos to draw material from beyond the virial radius and accrete more efficiently than a spherical model predicts .",
    "second , halos in this mass range are only @xmath115 times our resolution limit , and we are biased towards including halos that have higher accretion rates because we only count halos that have already formed a resolved central galaxy .",
    "this effect operates at all redshifts , but it is more important at high redshifts when galaxies have had less time to grow , causing us to omit lower @xmath169 galaxies from our average .",
    "in addition , our limited mass resolution may play some role in overestimating accretion rates .",
    "when we repeat the @xmath169 analysis for the higher resolution , l11/128 simulation at @xmath47 and @xmath56 , the mean accretion rate is lower and agrees even better with the analytical model , though the rate is still higher by @xmath170 at @xmath47 and @xmath171 at @xmath56 .",
    "crosses connected by dotted and dashed lines in figure  [ fig : rates ] show the mean accretion rates for the central objects of more massive halos , with @xmath172 and @xmath173 , respectively .",
    "halos of @xmath174 are dominated by hot mode accretion at all of the plotted redshifts , and halos of @xmath175 are dominated by hot mode at all but the highest redshifts ( see figure  [ fig : mass_ratio_halo ] ) .",
    "unmarked lines show the corresponding predictions of the infall model described above ; these correspond to the @xmath176 model curve ( solid line ) multiplied by factors of 10 and 100 . in these higher mass halos ,",
    "gas must cool before it can accrete onto the central galaxies , so it is not surprising that the pure infall model now overpredicts the galaxy accretion rates .",
    "however , the infall model still captures the redshift dependence of these rates remarkably well , especially if one ignores the highest redshifts , where the number of @xmath174 halos is small and the @xmath175 halos have a significant cold mode contribution .",
    "it is as if cooling just places a constant `` tax '' on the newly available halo gas , allowing an almost redshift independent fraction of the gas to cool at a given halo mass .",
    "this fraction decreases from @xmath177 for @xmath178 halos to @xmath179 for @xmath180 halos , as one might expect given the higher virial temperatures and correspondingly longer cooling times in more massive halos .",
    "= 1.0    to model the cooling effects in simpler terms , we have followed an analytical prescription along the lines of @xcite , assuming spherical halos with isothermal density and temperature profiles .",
    "we suppose that all gas that is able to cool accretes instantaneously onto the central galaxy .",
    "the accretion rate is , therefore , @xmath181 , where @xmath182 is the gas density at cooling radius and the cooling radius , @xmath183 , is the radius where @xmath184 and @xmath185 is the hubble time .",
    "therefore , the increase of the cooling radius in time defines the accretion rate .",
    "this model predicts accretion rates about 30%-60% lower than we find for @xmath186 and @xmath174 halos , but it reproduces the evolution of these rates fairly well .",
    "at least part of the difference in magnitude of accretion rates may be a result of our limited numerical resolution .",
    "@xcite find that the accretion rates can be overestimated in formulations of sph like those that we use here when there are not enough gas particles in the galaxy halo .",
    "we have repeated the above analysis for the l11/128 and l5.5/128 simulations ( at @xmath47 and @xmath56 ) and find that the accretion rates drop by 40%-50% for @xmath175 halos . however , each of these simulations has only one halo in this mass range , so this result is only suggestive .",
    "further work using simulations with higher dynamic range will be needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms that drive the evolution of hot mode accretion .    with these results in mind",
    ", we can build the following interpretation of the accretion rate evolution in figure  [ fig : history ] , and consequently of the evolution of the cosmic sfr in the simulations .",
    "the accretion rate climbs very rapidly starting at @xmath187 as more galaxies form above the resolution threshold  if we had higher resolution and a lower threshold , the accretion rate at these redshifts would be higher and would evolve more slowly .",
    "the number of galaxies in the low mass regime where cold accretion dominates reaches a maximum at @xmath160 and declines slowly thereafter . the rapid drop in the global cold accretion rate , starting at @xmath188 , is driven mainly by the decreasing accretion rate per galaxy shown in figure  [ fig : rates ] , which reflects the increasing infall timescale in a lower density universe .",
    "the mass threshold for hot accretion is higher , so the hot accretion starts to climb later and peaks at a lower redshift , @xmath160 .",
    "furthermore , the number density of hot mode halos stays roughly constant at @xmath159 , and the average mass of these halos increases with time .",
    "( note that higher mass halos always have higher mean accretion rates in both the simulation and the analytic model , even though the `` cooling tax '' makes the increase slower than @xmath189 . ) .",
    "the drop in global hot accretion is , therefore , also a consequence of the fast drop in the accretion rate per galaxy .",
    "this drop is slightly slower than for the cold mode owing to an increase in the characteristic mass of hot mode halos with time and to a slight increase in their number density .    in broader terms",
    ", most accreting galaxies at high redshift are low mass , do not have virial shocks , and connect directly to their large scale environment by filamentary `` umbilical cords . '' at intermediate redshifts , the galaxies experiencing the most accretion are intermediate mass systems with virial shocks penetrated by cool filaments , accreting in a mix of hot and cold mode . at low redshift , there are many high mass galaxies with no cold accretion , and many low mass galaxies reside in high mass halos where they experience primarily hot accretion . the filamentary structures that play such a vital role in cold mode accretion grow in scale as the universe evolves , particularly around high density regions .",
    "they eventually become too large to feed individual galaxies and instead channel their flows into the hot igm of groups and clusters .",
    "the combination of galaxy mass scales and large scale structure geometry drives the predicted dependence of the sfr on environment , allowing it to extend beyond the virial radii of large groups and clusters .",
    "one of the most striking features of the galaxy population to emerge from the sdss is a rapid transition in typical galaxy properties at a stellar mass @xmath190 @xcite .",
    "galaxies below this mass tend to be actively star forming with lower surface densities , high gas fractions , and late type morphologies , while galaxies above this mass tend to have old stellar populations , high surface density , low gas fraction , and early type morphology .",
    "the observed transition mass is remarkably close to the one at which we find a transition from cold mode domination to hot mode domination , so it is tempting to see the two as connected .",
    "it is not clear just how the second transition would bring about the first .",
    "however , if a galaxy accretes much of its mass along filamentary structures , this process is bound to influence its angular momentum , perhaps radically modifying the traditional picture of disk formation in which the disk s specific angular momentum distribution is closely related to that of its parent dark matter halo @xcite . in particular",
    ", cold accretion might be crucial to disk formation , with hot accretion contributing mainly to spheroid growth .",
    "the lower efficiency of hot accretion will also cause high mass galaxies to have less star formation and older stellar populations , though it is not clear that this effect in itself will produce a transition as strong as the observed one . if , as we speculate in the next section , hot accretion is suppressed in the real universe by physical processes not represented in our simulations",
    ", then the transition would be much sharper .",
    "furthermore , galaxies substantially above the cold - to - hot transition mass would then have to be built by mergers , explaining their predominantly elliptical morphology .",
    "a tight connection between cold accretion and disk formation would also help explain the observed morphology - density relation , since the cold accretion fraction depends strongly on environment . for the moment , these remarks are largely speculation , but we hope that future investigations of higher resolution simulations will deepen our understanding of the cold and hot accretion processes and their connection to galaxy morphologies and stellar populations .    when the baryons within a dark matter halo cool to form the central galaxy in the standard hot mode picture , the dark matter density near the galaxy increases through adiabatic contraction @xcite .",
    "this results in an increase in the galaxy s circular velocity , which can lead to conflicts with observations .",
    "for example , it is difficult for models to simultaneously match the galaxy luminosity function and the zero - point of the tully - fisher relation ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , if the galaxy assembles through cold mode accretion , adiabatic contraction might not occur or be greatly reduced since the dark matter and baryonic components assemble nearly simultaneously .",
    "this might help alleviate some of the tension with observations , especially since most disk galaxies should be cold mode dominated given that on average they have lower masses ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the most direct observational tests of cold accretion would come from detecting the cooling radiation associated with gas infall onto galaxies .",
    "as emphasised by @xcite , the existence of an important cold accretion mode allows a significant fraction of the gravitational energy acquired by accreting gas to emerge in the ly@xmath14  line , producing luminosities that are detectable with large telescopes .",
    "the main challenge to this test is separating the contribution of cooling radiation from the contribution of star formation , since galaxies with high accretion rates should also have high star formation rates . because the ly@xmath14  photons from cooling radiation",
    "are generally produced at larger galactocentric radii , it should be possible to distinguish the two contributions , but accurate predictions of the angular and frequency distribution of ly@xmath14  cooling radiation require radiative transfer calculations that have not yet been applied to 3-d simulations .",
    "filamentary gas flows that penetrate close to the galaxy disk and then shock should produce x - ray `` hot spots '' in the inner regions of some galaxy halos .",
    "further investigation will be required to assess the observability of this phenomenon .",
    "high column densities of neutral hydrogen near the disk might absorb much of the x - ray emission and re - radiate it in ly@xmath14@xcite .",
    "although our simulations appear reasonably consistent with the observationally inferred history of cosmic star formation ( fardal et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , they overpredict the @xmath20 baryonic mass function relative to the observational estimates of , e.g. , @xcite or @xcite . globally",
    ", the predicted fraction of baryons in the form of stars and cold gas exceeds the observationally inferred fraction by a factor @xmath139 .",
    "of course , the integral of the mean cosmic star formation rate must equal the mean stellar mass density ( when corrected for the stellar mass loss and recycling of this gas ) , so the agreement with one and disagreement with the other implies that at least some of the observational estimates of these quantities are themselves in conflict .",
    "however , the sfr estimates have substantial systematic uncertainties , while the stellar mass densities appear reasonably secure _ if _ the assumed stellar imfs are correct , so we think it more likely that the simulations are indeed producing overly massive galaxies .",
    "a related problem is that the simulations predict ongoing accretion and star formation in high mass galaxies , while in the real universe these systems are predominantly ellipticals exhibiting little or no recent star formation .",
    "similar difficulties with the luminosities and colours of high mass galaxies appear in semi - analytic models of galaxy formation , unless they are specifically modified to suppress them ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "simply distinguishing between hot and cold accretion does not , of course , change the simulation predictions .",
    "however , the conflicts mentioned above suggest that these simulations are still missing some physical processes that play a significant role in galaxy formation , and these processes might have different effects on hot and cold accretion .",
    "one can imagine , for instance , that hot mode accretion might be more easily suppressed by some forms of feedback because the hot mode gas is lower density and more isotropically distributed . in the local universe",
    ", at least , it appears that hot accretion _ is _ suppressed in groups and clusters , where x - ray emissivities imply short cooling times but x - ray spectra show that the predicted gas at @xmath191 kev is not present @xcite . the leading hypothesis for explaining",
    "this conflict is that the central regions of the intracluster medium are heated by recurrent agn activity , thermal conduction from the outer regions , or both ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the same processes might operate in lower mass halos at moderate redshifts .",
    "@xcite argue that a proper , multi - phase treatment of hot halo gas reduces predicted accretion rates by a substantial factor , even without conduction or extra feedback , because the cooling gas forms dense clouds and the remaining gas has lower densities and longer cooling times .",
    "this effect is omitted in standard analytic treatments and would be missed by simulations ( like ours ) that do not resolve the @xmath192 scale of clouds formed by thermal instability .",
    "whatever the mechanism , preferential suppression of hot mode accretion would lead to a sharper cutoff at the high end of the luminosity function , a more rapid decline in the cosmic sfr at @xmath193 , and older stellar populations in massive galaxies .",
    "all of these changes would improve the agreement between our sph simulations and observations , and they would also improve the agreement for most semi - analytic models .",
    "@xcite has made similar points , drawing on our preliminary results @xcite and the 1-d calculations of @xcite and @xcite for theoretical motivation ( see also @xcite ) .    in our simulations , supernova feedback has little impact on galaxy masses because the supernova energy is usually deposited in a dense medium , where it radiates away before it can drive a galactic wind .",
    "simple models of a multi - phase interstellar medium do not change this result @xcite , but collective effects may allow real galaxies to drive winds more easily , and a number of groups have added _ ad hoc _ wind models to simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the interplay of supernova - driven winds with accretion modes might be different from that of conduction or agn feedback , because once a wind is launched the main challenge is getting it out of the galaxy halo , so that the gas does not simply return and form stars on a short timescale . in a galaxy fed by filamentary cold accretion , supernova - driven gas might encounter little resistance because there is no surrounding halo medium ( see left panels of fig  [ fig : filament ] ) . in a galaxy dominated by hot accretion ,",
    "on the other hand , the disk and bulge are surrounded by a shock - heated gas halo , and a wind may be trapped at small radius .",
    "thus , one can easily imagine that expulsion of cooled gas by supernova feedback , in contrast to the suppression of cooling by agn feedback or conduction , might operate more efficiently in low mass galaxies .",
    "this might provide a way of reducing the masses of low mass galaxies and flattening the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function , which would again improve agreement between the simulations and data .",
    "the conventional understanding of supernova feedback also suggests that it will be more effective in low mass systems because gas is more easily driven out of shallow potential wells @xcite .",
    "we have focused instead on the role of the surrounding hot gas , which we suspect is even more important , since simulations of the feedback process show that only low mass galaxies ( @xmath194 ) blow out significant amounts of gas if they are surrounded by conventional hot halos @xcite .",
    "the form of the observed mass - metallicity relation can be understood if supernova - driven winds are efficient below @xmath195 and inefficient at higher masses @xcite .",
    "this transition mass is close to the mass where cold accretion gives way to hot accretion in our simulated galaxies , so it might emerge naturally if trapping by the hot gas halo is the correct explanation for it .",
    "the simulation predictions would also change in interesting ways if we assumed that cold accretion is associated with the conventional stellar imf ( e.g. , @xcite ) but that hot accretion is associated with _ either _ a bottom - heavy imf rich in brown dwarfs _ or _ a top - heavy imf truncated below @xmath196 . in the first case",
    ", massive galaxies would have high stellar mass - to - light ratios and therefore lower luminosities . in the second case",
    ", the massive galaxies would have lower stellar masses ( assuming that much of the recycled gas from evolved stars is driven from the galaxy ) , and they would have higher uv luminosities during their star - forming phases . allowing imf variations introduces a frightening level of freedom in galaxy formation models , but with two physically distinct accretion processes one should at least consider the possibility that the associated star formation is different .    for the moment , these proposals are largely speculation .",
    "we are carrying out further investigations to see how the predicted properties of the galaxy population would change if we assume preferential suppression of hot mode accretion or different stellar imfs for the two modes .",
    "such adjustments may make distinctive observational predictions that could compensate for the extra freedom they introduce , and their physical underpinnings can be investigated with higher resolution simulations focused on these questions .",
    "given the variety of possible assumptions , semi - analytic calculations might be a sensible approach to exploring models that treat cold and hot accretion differently .",
    "in sph simulations of galaxy formation , a substantial fraction of the gas accreted by galaxies is never heated close to the virial temperature of the galaxy potential wells .",
    "the importance of this cold accretion mode , relative to the hot accretion mode envisioned in the traditional picture of galaxy formation , depends strongly on galaxy mass .",
    "most galaxies below a baryonic mass @xmath197 or dark halo mass @xmath198 accrete primarily in cold mode , while more massive galaxies accrete primarily in hot mode .",
    "since high mass galaxies are built from lower mass systems , even galaxies at the top end of the luminosity function today acquired a significant fraction of their mass via cold accretion .",
    "globally , the increasing mass scale of galaxies means that cold accretion dominates at high redshift and hot accretion at low redshift .",
    "the ratio of cold to hot accretion is also environment dependent , mostly because higher mass galaxies are more common in dense environments , and partly because low mass systems in dense environments have a larger hot accretion fraction than their isolated counterparts .",
    "hot mode accretion is quasi - spherical , but cold mode accretion is often directed along filamentary channels , increasing its efficiency .",
    "a number of arguments suggest that these are physical results , not numerical artifacts .",
    "a quantitatively important cold mode appears in simulations covering a factor of 512 in mass resolution , though the lowest resolution simulations do not include a photoionizing uv background and therefore predict a noticeably different temperature distribution for cold mode gas .",
    "the transition mass of @xmath197 is stable in simulations covering a factor of 64 in mass resolution .",
    "cold accretion is seen in other sph simulations , including one with a substantially different implementation of shock heating .",
    "cold filamentary flows are found in adaptive mesh simulations , though these can not yet test whether gas gets into galaxies without experiencing strong shock heating .",
    "finally , the transition mass in our simulations agrees ( to within a factor of @xmath139 ) with that found by @xcite using entirely independent analytic methods and high - resolution 1-d calculations .",
    "despite this litany of tests , we can not rule out the possibility that cold accretion is an artifact of finite resolution of shocks in sph simulations .",
    "confirmation with still higher resolution simulations and with hydrodynamic methods that directly impose shock jump conditions at velocity discontinuities is therefore desirable .",
    "the transition mass separating hot and cold accretion is quantitatively different from the transition mass separating rapid and slow post - shock cooling in semi - analytic models of galaxy formation , at least as calculated by our implementation , which we believe to be the standard one ( see  [ sec : disc_cold ] and the appendix ) .",
    "however , semi - analytic models could be easily revised to incorporate a cold mode of gas accretion calibrated on hydrodynamic simulations like those analyzed here .",
    "cold accretion could have important implications for the cosmic star formation history and for the correlations of galaxy star formation rates , stellar populations , and morphology with environment .",
    "if cold and hot accretion are affected differently by stellar or agn feedback , or if they are associated with different stellar imfs , then the simulation predictions would change in interesting ways , perhaps resolving conflicts with the observed colours of ellipticals and with the observationally inferred galaxy baryonic mass function .",
    "our predicted transition mass is close to the observed transition mass at which typical galaxy properties change markedly @xcite , and we have speculated on possible connections between the two . in particular , if agn feedback , multi - phase cloud production , or some other mechanism strongly suppresses hot accretion in the real universe , then galaxies above the transition mass would have little recent accretion and star formation , and they would have to be built by mergers of lower mass systems , which would produce spheroidal morphologies .",
    "many questions remain about both the underlying physics and the observational implications of cold accretion , but we hope that higher resolution simulations and comparisons to data will answer these questions over the next few years and solidify our understanding of how galaxies get their gas .",

    "semi - analytic models of galaxy formation , which trace back to the formalism introduced by @xcite , calculate the growth of galaxies fed by the accretion of gas cooling within dark matter halos . while cooling rates are calculated assuming that the gas initially heats to the halo virial temperature",
    ", these calculations do distinguish between a regime of slow cooling , in which accretion from a quasi - hydrostatic gas halo is regulated by the cooling rate , and a regime of rapid cooling , in which no quasi - hydrostatic atmosphere forms and gas accretion is regulated by the infall rate .",
    "given the qualitative resemblance of this criterion to the one introduced by @xcite , it is interesting to ask whether the predicted transition between infall and cooling dominated accretion is quantitatively similar to the transition between cold and hot accretion found in our simulations . in this appendix",
    ", we describe our calculation of the infall - cooling transition mass , discussed earlier in  [ sec : disc_cold ] .",
    "we assume that galaxy halos initially contain the universal baryonic fraction of gas , @xmath143 , with a constant gas temperature equal to @xmath110 .",
    "we model the initial gas density distribution as an nfw profile @xcite , and , for simplicity , assume a constant concentration for the nfw profiles , which is typical for @xmath199 halos @xcite : @xmath200 .",
    "@xmath94 is the virial radius and @xmath201 is the scale radius of the nfw halo . for a given halo virial mass , @xmath202 , @xmath94",
    "is defined as the radius within which the enclosed density equals @xmath203 times the mean mass density of the universe at that redshift , i.e. @xmath204 here we use the approximation for @xmath203 from @xcite , which gives similar results to @xcite . for comparison",
    "we also consider an alternative model where the gas density follows that of a singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) with @xmath205 .",
    "following @xcite , we define the local cooling time of the halo gas , @xmath206 , as @xmath207 where @xmath208 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath209 is mean  molecular \" weight , which we assume to be that of a fully ionized gas , @xmath164 is the fraction of halo gas available for cooling , @xmath210 is the proton mass , @xmath211 is the hydrogen density , @xmath212 is the total gas density , and @xmath213 is the cooling function . like in the simulation , we assume that the gas is primordial with a hydrogen mass fraction of 0.76 . the cooling time determines the cooling radius @xmath214 at which gas can radiate its thermal energy in a specified amount of time . @xcite",
    "define the cooling radius by setting @xmath215 equal to the hubble time @xmath144 , the age of the universe at redshift @xmath145 .",
    "however , different groups use different characteristic times in their semi - analytic calculations .",
    "therefore , to cover a range of possibilities we compare the cooling time to three time scales : the hubble time @xmath144 , the dynamical time defined as @xmath216 where @xmath217 is the average enclosed density , and the free fall time , which is @xmath218 . therefore , the cooling radius is defined as the radius where @xmath219 , @xmath220 , or @xmath221 . in @xcite , infall dominated accretion takes place when @xmath222 , and cooling dominated accretion takes place when @xmath222 .",
    "the transition halo mass between the two regimes is thus the halo mass for which @xmath223 .    to fairly compare this mass with the transition mass between cold and hot mode accretion in our simulations",
    ", we use the same cosmology ( see   [ sec : param ] ) and the same cooling function ( see kwh96 ) as in our simulations , neglecting only inverse compton cooling . since some gas has already transformed into stars , the fraction of the gas available for cooling , @xmath164 , is less than one and decreases with redshift .",
    "we approximate @xmath224 , which roughly matches the global fraction of the baryons in the simulation that are not in stars or cold galactic gas at a given redshift .",
    "the uv background affects gas cooling in our simulations after @xmath61 , so to make a fair comparison it is necessary to include it in our calculation .",
    "as mentioned in   [ sec : uv ] , for typical densities at the virial radius , the uv background can significantly alter the hydrogen and helium line cooling peaks in the cooling function , making the cooling times at the virial radius significantly longer .    in figure  [",
    "fig : append ] , solid lines show the transition mass between infall and cooling dominated accretion for an nfw density profile in the presence of the uv background .",
    "squares correspond to a definition of @xmath214 with @xmath225 , triangles to @xmath226 , and the star to @xmath227 . for direct comparison",
    "we plot the mass where the transition between cold and hot mode occurs in our simulations as the dot - dashed line with circles . at @xmath228 the transition mass in the simulation",
    "is a factor of @xmath229 higher than the highest of the semi - analytic transition masses , defined for @xmath230 . at @xmath231 ,",
    "there is no halo mass for which @xmath232 , so the semi - analytic calculation predicts no infall dominated halos at all .",
    "if we define the transition with respect to @xmath233 or @xmath234 , the semi - analytic transition mass drops by another factor of @xmath90 at high redshift , and infall dominated halos disappear after @xmath235 ( @xmath233 ) or @xmath47 ( @xmath234 ) .",
    "the long - dashed curve in figure  [ fig : append ] shows the effect of omitting the uv background , which increases cooling rates and therefore increases the transition mass . with no uv background ,",
    "there are infall dominated halos all the way to @xmath20 , though the transition mass is still lower than the cold / hot transition mass in our simulations with a uv background .",
    "furthermore , as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : uv ] , the increased cooling in the absence of a uv background leads to a substantially higher transition mass in our simulations themselves .",
    "since our simulations without a uv background are lower resolution or run only to @xmath47 , we do not have a very accurate measurement of this increase , but it appears to be at least a factor of four . the dotted curve in figure  [ fig : append ]",
    "shows the effect of assuming an sis gas profile instead of an nfw profile , again with no uv background .",
    "since an sis profile has a higher gas density at the virial radius than an nfw profile , the transition mass increases .",
    "however , while gas and dark matter profiles inside halos will generally be different to some degree , the nfw assumption seems likely to be more realistic near the virial radius . for comparison",
    "we also plot the model of @xcite(zero metallicity line from the upper panel of their figure 11 ) , which is motivated by their 1d simulations .",
    "their cosmology is different from ours , but the baryonic mass fraction , one of the main factors determining the transition mass , is similar .",
    "@xcite do not include a uv background in their calculations , and their model agrees fairly well with the `` nfw without uv '' line in figure  [ fig : append ] , though the redshift dependence is somewhat different .",
    "@xcite discuss the dependence of the derived transition mass on details of the calculational assumptions , gas metallicity , and cosmological parameters .",
    "we conclude that the conventional definition of the transition between infall and cooling dominated accretion does not correspond quantitatively to the transition between cold and hot mode accretion found in our simulations , if one makes the same physical assumptions in the semi - analytic calculation .",
    "however , it may be possible to alter the semi - analytic calculation , for example by defining the transition at some fraction of the virial radius instead of at @xmath94 itself , so that the correspondence is better",
    ". it would be particularly interesting to see whether a definition of transition mass calibrated to match hydrodynamic simulations for one set of cosmological parameters and cooling rates then reproduces the results of simulations that assume different parameters or different cooling rates ( e.g. , because of different metallicity or a change of the uv background ) .",
    "a successful analytic model of this sort would provide physical insight into the distinction between cold and hot accretion , and it would be a useful practical tool for investigating the effects of parameter variations ."
