    "the low - energy properties of multilayer graphene@xcite depend crucially on the stacking order of the constituent graphene layers@xcite . in the case of trilayer graphene , there are two stable stacking orders : ( i ) aba or bernard stacking and ( ii ) abc or chiral stacking . recent advances in sample fabrication methods have resulted in high - quality trilayer samples which can be used to probe many of the theoretical predictions@xcite .",
    "abc stacked trilayer graphene appears to be particularly exciting because it is expected to host a wealth of interesting phenomena , such as chiral quasiparticles with berry phase @xmath3@xcite , a lifshitz transition of electronic bands due to trigonal warping@xcite , band - gap opening in an external electric field@xcite , and broken symmetry phases at low electron densities@xcite , to name a few .",
    "although there are a number of theoretical@xcite and experimental@xcite studies on the electronic properties of aba and abc stacked trilayer graphene , the spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) in these systems has received much less attention .",
    "aba trilayer graphene was considered in ref .   within a framework of an effective low - energy theory , whereas the case abc stacking was only briefly mentioned in ref .  .",
    "the understanding of spin - orbit interaction would be important to study other interesting and experimentally relevant phenomena such as spin relaxation@xcite , weak - localization@xcite or even spin - hall effect@xcite in trilayer graphene .",
    "the recent report of ref .",
    "on the fabrication of high mobility double gated abc trilayer graphene may open very promising new avenues for trilayer graphene spintronics as well , similarly to the monolayer case where highly efficient spin transport has recently been reported@xcite , but with the additional advantage that external gates can open a band gap in abc trilayer graphene .",
    "in this paper we aim to make the first steps towards a detailed understanding of the spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) in chirally stacked trilayer graphene .",
    "we start by investigating the case when the system has inversion symmetry , i.e. in the absence of external electric fields , adatoms or a substrate .",
    "this is the case of _ intrinsic _ soc .",
    "the intrinsic soc opens a band - gap at the band - degeneracy points without introducing spin polarization .",
    "ab initio _",
    "calculations on monolayer@xcite and bilayer@xcite graphene provided strong evidence that the key to the understanding the soc in _ flat _",
    "graphene systems is to take into account the ( nominally unoccupied ) @xmath0 orbitals in the description of electronic bands .",
    "here we take the same view and by generalizing the work of ref .",
    "derive the intrinsic soc hamiltonian for abc trilayer graphene .",
    "it turns out that the most important @xmath0 orbitals to take into account are the @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath1 orbitals . while the former two have been considered in ref .   in the context of monolayer graphene ,",
    "the latter one is important to understand the soc in ab and abc graphene .",
    "we obtain explicit expressions for the soc constants in terms of slater - koster@xcite hopping parameters .",
    "we also rederive the intrinsic so hamiltonian for bilayer graphene@xcite . through the comparison of our trilayer and bilayer analytical results with the recent _ ab initio _ calculations of ref .",
    "we are able to make predictions for the actual values of the soc parameters in abc trilayer graphene .",
    "the theory involves electronic bands which are far from the fermi energy @xmath6 but are coupled to the physically important low - energy bands close to @xmath6 and hence complicate the description of the electronic properties .",
    "therefore , we derive an effective low - energy hamiltonian and calculate its spectrum .",
    "this helps us to understand how soc lifts certain degeneracies of the electronic bands .    generally speaking , due to the low atomic number of carbon , the intrinsic soc in single and multilayer graphene is weak ( according to our prediction , the soc parameters are of the order of @xmath7 in abc trilayer , the same as in monolayer@xcite and bilayer@xcite graphene ) .",
    "recently however , there have been exciting theoretical proposals to enhance the strength of soc in monolayer graphene and hence , e.g. , make the quantum spin hall state@xcite observable .",
    "these proposals suggest deposition of indium or thallium atoms@xcite or to bring graphene into proximity with topological insulators@xcite .",
    "indeed , very recently the combined experimental and theoretical work of ref .   has provided evidence of a large ( @xmath8 ) spin - orbit gap in monolayer graphene on nickel substrate with intercalated gold atoms .",
    "motivated by these studies we also discuss what might be a minimal model to describe the case where the the soc is strongly enhanced in only one of the layers of bilayer and abc trilayer graphene .    our work is organized as follows . in sect .",

    "we repeat this calculation for bilayer graphene in sect .  [",
    "sec : bilayer ] so that in sect .",
    "[ sec : so - abc - sl ] we can make predictions for the actual values of the soc parameters .",
    "next , in section [ sec : eff_so_ham ] , using @xmath9 theory and the schrieffer - wolff transformation@xcite , we derive an effective low - energy soc hamiltonian which is valid for wave - vectors around the @xmath2 ( @xmath10 ) point . finally , in sect .",

    "these hoppings can be obtained by e.g. fitting the numerically calculated band structure with a tb model@xcite .",

    "it was shown in ref .   that in the case of monolayer graphene the main contribution to the intrinsic soc comes from the admixture of @xmath11 orbitals with some of the ( nominally unoccupied ) @xmath0 orbitals , namely , with the @xmath4 and @xmath5 orbitals .",
    "the other @xmath0 orbitals , @xmath1 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 play no role due to the fact that they are symmetric with respect to the mirror reflection @xmath44 to the plane of the graphene layer , whereas @xmath11 is antisymmetric .",

    "therefore , from a symmetry point of view , in an approach similar to ref .  , all @xmath0 orbitals need to be taken into account . to derive a tb model one should therefore use as basis set the bloch wavefunctions @xmath48 where the wavevector @xmath49 is measured from the @xmath15 point of the bz ( see fig .

    "if , in addition to the @xmath11 orbitals , we include also the @xmath0 orbitals into our basis , there will be six basis functions @xmath94 centered on each of the six carbon atoms in the unit cell and hence the tb hamiltonian @xmath95 , which is straightforward to calculate in the sk parametrization , is a @xmath96 matrix . by e.g. numerically diagonalizing this matrix one would find that the @xmath11 orbitals hybridize with some of the @xmath0 orbitals and one could see how the low energy and the split - off states , obtained in the first instance by neglecting the @xmath0 orbitals , are modified . according to band theory",
    "each state at the @xmath2 point should belong to one of the irreducible representations of the small group of the @xmath2 point@xcite , which is @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) in this case .",
