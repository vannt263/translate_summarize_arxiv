    "the paper is organized as follows . in sections  [ grpol ] and [ cgra ] , we review basic notation and in particular describe the cayley graph @xmath3 associated with a given graph @xmath0 .",
    "then , in section  [ hedron ] , we define the graphicahedron @xmath12 , establish that it is an abstract polytope , and prove that its @xmath6-skeleton is the cayley graph @xmath3 . in section  [ group ] , we find the structure of the automorphism group of @xmath12 and then enumerate the graphicahedra that are regular polytopes . finally , in section  [ examples ] , we describe in more detail the geometric structure of the graphicahedra when @xmath0 is a path , a cycle , a star graph , or a small graph with up to four edges .",

[ theo1 ]",
    "let @xmath0 be a connected @xmath17-graph .",

    "the polytope @xmath12 of theorem  [ theo1 ] is called the _ graphicahedron associated with _ @xmath0 , or simply the _ @xmath0-graphicahedron_.",

    "we already know that @xmath4 can be viewed as a subgroup of @xmath266 acting by right multiplication on the second component of the faces of @xmath12 .",

    "first note that a graph automorphism of a connected graph is completely determined by its effect on the vertices of valency at least @xmath100 and their neighbors of valency @xmath6 .",
    "thus we may ignore vertices of @xmath0 of valency @xmath6 , since we know the effect on the edges that contain them .",

    "the key for the final step is to remember that @xmath305 was derived from the above polytope automorphism @xmath272 of the underlying graphicahedron @xmath12 .",
    "we know that the face structure of @xmath12 is completely determined by the structure of @xmath0 .",
    "for example , the @xmath100-face @xmath316 of @xmath12 is a hexagon or square , depending on whether or not @xmath317 are edges of @xmath0 with a common vertex ; note here that @xmath318 or @xmath319 , according as @xmath273 and @xmath320 share a vertex or not . on the other hand , polytope automorphisms",
    "preserve isomorphism types of faces , so @xmath272 must necessarily map square @xmath100-faces to square @xmath100-faces and hexagonal @xmath100-faces to hexagonal @xmath100-faces ; in particular , @xmath321 . hence , the edges @xmath273 and @xmath320 of @xmath0 share a common vertex in @xmath0 if and only if their images @xmath322 and @xmath323 share a common vertex in @xmath0 .",
    "finally , then , let @xmath26 be any vertex of @xmath0 of valency @xmath324 , and let @xmath312 be as above . when @xmath325 we are done by the previous argument ; in fact , if @xmath273 and @xmath320 are the two edges of @xmath312 ( sharing vertex @xmath26 ) , then @xmath322 and @xmath323 also share a vertex , @xmath314 , and @xmath326 .",
    "suppose @xmath327 .",
    "we now consider @xmath102-faces of @xmath12 .",
    "if @xmath328 are any edges in @xmath312 ( all sharing the vertex @xmath26 ) , then we must have @xmath329 ; in fact , if @xmath330 ( say ) are the end vertices of @xmath328 distinct from @xmath26 , respectively , then @xmath331 and these transpositions generate all permutations of @xmath332 .",
    "in particular , the @xmath102-face @xmath333 of @xmath12 must have @xmath334 vertices , so the same must be true for its image @xmath335 under @xmath272 . hence @xmath336 must also have order @xmath334 . since we already know from our previous considerations that any two of @xmath337 share a common vertex in @xmath0 ,",
    "this now forces all three to have a vertex in common ( otherwise we would only obtain a subgroup @xmath338 ) .",
    "it follows that @xmath305 maps any three edges @xmath328 in @xmath312 to three concurrent edges .",
    "however , if any three edges in @xmath312 are mapped to three concurrent edges , then the entire set @xmath312 is mapped to a set of edges of @xmath0 all sharing a common vertex , @xmath314 .",
    "thus @xmath326 , and the proof is complete .",
    "note that theorem  [ graphsaut ] fails if @xmath0 is a connected graph with only one edge .",
    "in fact , in this case @xmath12 is a @xmath6-polytope with automorphism group @xmath339 , while @xmath267 also has order @xmath100 ( but has a trivial action on the edge set of @xmath0 ) .",
    "the following theorem characterizes the graphicahedra which are regular polytopes . by @xmath105 and @xmath340 , respectively , we denote the path or cycle of length @xmath8 ( with @xmath8 edges ) , and by @xmath341 the star graph with @xmath8 edges emanating from a central vertex .",

    "hence @xmath12 is regular if and only if @xmath267 has order @xmath346 .",
    "since graph automorphisms are completely determined by their effect on the edges of the graph , the latter is equivalent to saying that @xmath347 , or , that every permutation of edges of @xmath0 arises from a graph automorphism of @xmath0 .",

    "but then @xmath355 and hence @xmath356 , since the two cycles share all but one edge ( double edges are not permitted ) .",

    "if @xmath0 has only vertices of valency at most @xmath100 , then @xmath0 is the path of length @xmath2 . since the automorphism group of a path of any length has order @xmath100 , this forces @xmath104 , that is , @xmath361 .",
    "now suppose @xmath0 has a vertex @xmath26 ( say ) of valency at least @xmath102 .",
    "let @xmath328 be edges of @xmath0 containing @xmath26 .",

    "thus every edge of @xmath0 contains the vertex @xmath26 of @xmath0 .",
    "it follows that @xmath345 .    in summary",

    "in this section we discuss in more detail the geometric structure of the graphicahedron @xmath12 for some specific choices of @xmath17-graph @xmath0 .",
    "recall that @xmath0 must be connected .",
    "we begin with the path @xmath365 of length @xmath8 , for which @xmath366 and @xmath367 .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the graphicahedron associated with a given graph @xmath0 generalizes the permutahedron @xmath7 .",
    "the following theorem shows that @xmath368 is in fact isomorphic to @xmath7 if @xmath365 .",
    "if we knew that @xmath369 could be realized as a convex @xmath8-polytope in some euclidean space , then , bearing in mind lemma  [ isopermu ] and theorem  [ theo2 ] , we could simply appeal to the well - known fact that a simple convex polytope of a given dimension is uniquely determined up to isomorphism by its @xmath6-skeleton ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , we do not a priori have such a realization and must proceed in a different manner .",
    "we outline the proof .",
    "we use some basic coxeter group theory for the symmetric group @xmath11 , or , equivalently , the symmetry group of the regular @xmath8-simplex .",
    "the permutahedron @xmath370 was defined earlier as the convex hull of the @xmath371 points ( in a hyperplane ) in @xmath9 obtained from @xmath10 by permuting the coordinates in all possible ways .",
    "however , @xmath370 has other equivalent realizations .",
    "in fact , @xmath370 can also be obtained from wythoff s construction applied to an interior point @xmath372 of the standard fundamental simplex for the symmetry group @xmath11 of the regular @xmath8-simplex ( see coxeter  @xcite ) ; in other words , @xmath370 is the convex hull of all images of @xmath372 under this group . since the ( interior )",
    "walls of the fundamental simplex are in one - to - one correspondence with the standard generating system of adjacent transpositions @xmath373 of @xmath11 , it is immediately clear that the @xmath6-skeleton of @xmath370 is the cayley graph of @xmath11 . in the notation of @xcite , @xmath370",
    "may be represented by a coxeter diagram @xmath374 in which all nodes are ringed , and the structure of its faces can be read off this diagram .",
    "combinatorially , the boundary complex of @xmath370 is the dual of the barycentric subdivision of the boundary complex of the regular @xmath8-simplex .",
    "comparison with the graphicahedron @xmath369 then shows that the faces of @xmath370 may be viewed as geometric realizations of those of @xmath369 .",
    "in particular , a @xmath128-face @xmath129 of @xmath12 corresponds to the vertex @xmath375 of @xmath370 , and , more generally , a face @xmath125 of @xmath12 corresponds ( via the coset @xmath376 ) to the convex hull of the images of @xmath375 under the subgroup @xmath72 of the symmetry group @xmath11 .",
    "thus the graphicahedron @xmath369 is isomorphic to the face - lattice of @xmath370 .      for the @xmath8-cycle @xmath340 with @xmath377 or @xmath378",
    "it is not hard to verify directly that @xmath379 is a vertex - transitive tessellation of the @xmath100-torus or @xmath102-torus , respectively . in particular , by corollary  [ allsq ] , @xmath380 is a regular @xmath102-polytope isomorphic to the toroidal map @xmath381 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the structure of @xmath379 for general @xmath8 will be analyzed in the forthcoming paper @xcite ; in fact , @xmath379 is always a tessellation on the @xmath382-torus .",

    "these are the only graphicahedra which are regular polytopes .    when @xmath377 we obtain the toroidal regular map @xmath386 .",
    "this occurs as the facet type of the regular @xmath378-polytope @xmath387 . in particular",

    "isomorphism of @xmath387 with the universal polytope follows from that fact that both polytopes have groups of the same order ; here , the semi - direct @xmath392 actually also is a direct product @xmath389 ( however , with different factors ) .",

    "clearly , a connected @xmath396-graph must necessarily be isomorphic to @xmath397 , @xmath360 or @xmath398 , so there are no graphicahedra of rank @xmath102 other than those already mentioned .",
    "this completely settles the case @xmath359 . on the other hand , when @xmath399 there are two connected @xmath400-graphs in addition to @xmath401 , @xmath402 or @xmath403 ( see figure  [ graph4 ] ) .",
