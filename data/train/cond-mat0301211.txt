    "investigations on the electronic structures of strongly correlated materials such as @xmath4 and @xmath0 electron systems have been very active lately.@xcite one of the perhaps oldest problems in this category is the origin of the @xmath5 phase transition of ce metal and its compounds , which has been studied for more than 50 years but still remains controversial.@xcite photoemission spectroscopy , among various experimental techniques , is a very powerful tool that can directly probe the electronic structures of solids . indeed in the case of ce problem as well , the study of 4@xmath0 spectral weights of various ce compounds using resonant photoelectron spectroscopy ( rpes ) technique at the ce 4@xmath4-edge contributed decisively to the understanding of this famous phase transition .",
    "this technique is necessary to enhance the 4@xmath0 electron emissions and separate them from contributions of other conduction electrons,@xcite and utilizes the following process    @xmath6    the conventional wisdom that came out of these studies , at least until early 1990 s , was as follows ; the major factor distinguishing between @xmath7 and @xmath8 phases of ce and its compounds is the strength of the hybridization between ce 4@xmath0 level and the conduction bands , and the disappearance of the local magnetic moment in the @xmath7 phase results from the kondo phenomenon of the singlet formation due to the hybridization of a localized 4@xmath0 electron with conduction electrons , and not from the promotion of the 4@xmath0 electron to the empty state above the fermi level.@xcite    after the high resolution rpes was developed in the early 1990 s , however , some groups questioned this conventional wisdom and proposed a new interpretation of the 4@xmath0 spectral weights of ce compounds.@xcite the main point of those groups was that the temperature or the material dependence of the 4@xmath0 spectral weights of ce compounds near the fermi level , which had been interpreted as the tail of the kondo resonance,@xcite did not follow the kondo scenario which stipulates that the kondo temperature is the universal controlling parameter that determines the strength of the kondo resonance near the fermi level in different materials or at different measuring temperatures .",
    "this controversy generated many more careful studies on the 4@xmath0 spectral weights of various ce compounds by several research groups , @xcite some utilizing rpes technique and others using ordinary ultraviolet photoemission ( ups ) technique with he@xmath9 ( h@xmath10 = 21.2 ev ) and he@xmath11 ( h@xmath10 = 40.8 ev ) sources .",
    "most of these later studies also supported kondo resonance scenario , but one important issue which has not been settled so far is the surface effect and how to separate the surface from the bulk contributions.@xcite since the electron kinetic energy at the ce @xmath12-edge rpes is about 120ev , and the electron mean free path at this kinetic energy is only about 5,@xcite the surface contribution in the 4@xmath0 spectral weights obtained with @xmath12-edge rpes technique is expected to be very much significant , even larger than the bulk in some cases .",
    "the situation with the ordinary ups data with he@xmath9 ( h@xmath10 = 21.2 ev ) and he@xmath11 ( h@xmath10 = 40.8 ev ) sources is not much different . hence to compare quantitatively the experimental photoemission spectra with those expected from the kondo temperature of bulk materials , it is imperative to be able to extract the bulk contributions from the experimental data .",
    "many approaches have been tried with the ce @xmath12-edge rpes or ordinary ups data,@xcite but the results were not conclusive enough since each method has its own drawbacks and uncertainties .",
    "recently a powerful new method to extract reliable bulk ce 4@xmath0 spectral weights has become possible thanks to the advent of the new beamline at spring-8 , japan.@xcite it has been well - known that we can reduce the surface contribution in photoemission spectra by using high energy photon source .",
    "for example , if around 880ev photon source is used in rpes , the electron mean free path of the photoelectrons from ce 4@xmath0 levels will be about 20 .@xcite since those 880ev photon energies can excite a ce @xmath2 core - electron to an empty 4@xmath0 level ( ce 3@xmath4 absorption edge ) , the 4@xmath0 spectral weight is also enhanced due to the resonance phenomenon as in the case of ce 4@xmath4-edge rpes .",
    "hence we can obtain much more bulk - sensitive ce 4@xmath0 spectral weights by using those high photon energies in this so - called ce 3@xmath4-edge rpes technique .",
    "in fact , this technique had been already tried more than 10 years ago,@xcite but the energy resolution in the ce 3@xmath4-edge rpes at that time was not good enough to give conclusive results .",
    "recently , sekiyama _ et al . _ succeeded to obtain the total energy resolution including energy analyser at the ce @xmath2 edge photon source less than 100mev with high photon flux in the undulator beamline of spring-8 and study high - resolution bulk - sensitive ce spectral weights in ceru@xmath1.@xcite this opened up a new possibility to extract reliable bulk - sensitive spectral weights in many interesting ce compounds , and several papers have already appeared utilizing this ce 3@xmath4-edge rpes technique.@xcite    however , in the course of this study , we realized that the experimental photoemission data depends sensitively on the exact incident photon energy near the ce 3@xmath4-edge , and the difference of spectral lineshape is significant enough to affect data interpretation . also the new",
    "ce 3@xmath4-edge rpes data were found to be not completely consistent with the old data taken in early 1990 s , even after the difference of the energy resolutions is taken into account .",
    "to derive reliable conclusions from the ce 3@xmath4-edge rpes data , therefore , it is necessary to understand the origin of these differences and changes .",
    "this paper is an attempt to understand the origin of these phenomena by systematically studying ce 3@xmath4-edge rpes of several ce compounds .",
    "we will show in this paper data on cefe@xmath1 , ceni@xmath1 , and cesi@xmath1 only , although we studied many more ce compounds which gave fully consistent results with the conclusion of this paper .",
    "the three ce compounds to be discussed here have various kondo temperature , the universal parameter which controls many physical properties of ce compounds in the kondo resonance scenario .",
    "the kondo temperatures of intermetallic compounds cefe@xmath1 and ceni@xmath1 are larger than about 500 k , and that of cesi@xmath1 compound is about 45 k.@xcite this paper will mainly focus on the general phenomena of the ce 3@xmath4-edge rpes , and the electronic structures of individual compounds will be discussed in separate publications.@xcite",
    "polycrystalline samples of cefe@xmath1 , ceni@xmath1 , and cesi@xmath1 were made by the arc melting method under ar gas environment with constituent elements ce , fe , ni , and si whose purity was better than 99.9 % .",
    "the homogeneity of samples was checked after annealing with x - ray diffraction .",
    "resonant photoemission spectra of the valence bands at various photon energies near the ce @xmath2-edge ( h@xmath13 880 ev ) along with the ce @xmath2-edge x - ray absorption spectrum ( xas ) were obtained at the beamline bl25su in the spring-8 of japan.@xcite the base pressure of an analysis chamber was about 3 @xmath14 10@xmath15 mbar or better .",
    "the samples were scraped with a diamond file to get clean surfaces , and every time the cleanness of sample surface was checked with the o @xmath16 core - level spectrum .",
    "if the oxygen contamination peak was found noticeable in o @xmath16 core - level spectrum , the samples were scraped again with the diamond file .",
    "all spectra were measured at the temperature of 20 k , and the scraping was also done at 20 k. the xas measurements were done by the total electron yield mode , and the energy resolution was about 80 mev .",
    "scienta 200 analyzer was used for the electron energy analysis for pes measurements , and the total resolution of the pes spectra was better than 100 mev .",
    "1 shows the ce m@xmath17 xas data representing @xmath18 transition for cefe@xmath1 , ceni@xmath1 , and cesi@xmath1 compounds .",
    "the @xmath19 xas of fig . 1 consists of the main peak structure near @xmath20 = 882 ev , and the satellite peak near @xmath21 = 887 ev .",
    "the main peak structure comes from @xmath22 transition , and the satellite peak @xmath23 transition.@xcite the mark of `` '' means approximate interpretation , since the complete eigenstate of each peak is composed of many body configurations .",
    "the lineshape of the main peak near 882 ev is primarily determined by the multiplet structures of the @xmath24 electronic configuration , where the underline represents a hole . at the bottom of the figure",
    "is shown the theoretically expected xas line spectrum , which is calculated by considering all the multiplets of the @xmath3 electronic configuration along with the appropriate transition probability from the ground state.@xcite we can see that the theoretical calculation compares favorably with the experimental xas data , especially for the case of cesi@xmath1 , although we can also notice that the details of the main peak lineshape and the satellite peak intensity near 887ev change somewhat depending on the compounds .",
    "we will deal with this phenomenon and its implication on the electronic structures systematically in a separate publication.@xcite in this figure , the symbols a to g designate the incident photon energies used to obtain the @xmath25 spectral weights with the ce @xmath2-edge rpes to be shown in subsequent figures .",
    "2 represents rpes spectra near the fermi level of cefe@xmath1 obtained with various incident photon energies corresponding to the symbols from a to g in fig .",
    "all through these photon energies the ce 4@xmath0 spectral weights are resonantly enhanced by the following process .",
    "@xmath26 since the contribution from the ce 4@xmath0 emissions is at least ten times larger than those from other conduction electrons at these resonance energies , we can safely neglect the other conduction electron contributions and consider the spectra of fig .",
    "2 as the ce 4@xmath0 spectral weights near the fermi level , as in the case of ce 4@xmath4-edge rpes.@xcite however , the bulk contribution of ce 4@xmath0 spectral weights of fig . 2 is much larger than that of @xmath12 edge rpes , since the electron mean free path at @xmath27 transition energies is much longer.@xcite    the spectra in fig",
    ". 2 consist of a peak near the fermi level and a shoulder at about 2ev .",
    "the shoulder near 2ev comes from the @xmath28 transition , whereas the peak near the fermi level comes from @xmath29 transition ( means the hole in the conduction band ) which corresponds to the tail of the kondo resonance peak.@xcite the detailed analysis on those peaks and their relation to the electronic structures of cefe@xmath1 have been dealt with in other papers.@xcite here we focus on the change of the 4@xmath0 spectral lineshapes depending on the incident photon energy .",
    "we clearly see that as the photon energy is increased from a ( 881.76ev ) to f ( 882.48ev ) , which is only 0.72ev apart , the width of the peak near the fermi level is significantly broadened . to see these changes of spectral weights more quantitatively , we subtracted the spectrum at a from data taken at higher photon energies after normalizing each spectrum at its maximum intensity .",
    "the resulting difference spectra at various photon energies are shown in fig.3 .",
    "we find two noticeable features in every difference spectrum of fig.3  a broad peak below the fermi level e@xmath30 and a sharp dip at e@xmath30 . the maximum of the broad peak moves to the high binding energy side as the incident photon energy is increased .",
    "in fact , we note that the binding energy of the maximum position is exactly the same as the difference of two incident energies , which is indicated by the arrows .",
    "this tells us the kinetic energy of the broad peak remains the same regardless of the incident photon energy , a telltale signature of auger emission .",
    "hence , we can conclude that this broad peak results from the auger transition , and that the apparent change of the spectral lineshapes depending on the incident photon energy is due to these auger emissions overlapping the resonant 4@xmath0 photoemissions .",
    "this auger process must be the coster - kronig type between different multiplets of the @xmath31 configuration in the intermediate state of rpes .    to obtain genuine ce 4@xmath0 spectral weights from rpes data , therefore",
    ", it is necessary to avoid the contribution from these overlapping auger emissions . the best way to achieve",
    "this is probably to take the spectrum at the incident photon energy corresponding to the lowest multiplet of the intermediate state .",
    "indeed , we can see in the figure that the difference spectrum between b and a is nearly flat , implying that the spectral shape is nearly identical for data taken near the lowest multiplet .",
    "we have also confirmed that the spectra taken at incident photon energies slightly below a remain identical in lineshapes as that of a. this fact gives us an important lesson in extracting bulk - sensitive ce 4@xmath0 spectral weights using the 3@xmath4-edge rpes technique  that is , it is dangerous to use the incident photon energy which simply gives maximum resonance effect ( such as peak e in fig.1 ) , since at that energy the spectra might be contaminated with overlapping auger emissions .",
    "it is instead best to choose the incident photon energy as low as possible which still gives appreciable resonance effect . some of the previous ce 3@xmath4-edge rpes experiments may have been performed at the photon energy of maximum resonance , in which case the data have to be interpreted with caution .",
    "this interpretation on the origin of the lineshape change with the incident photon energy can also explain the dip structure near e@xmath30 shown in fig.3 .",
    "because of the auger transition between multiplets , the intensity of the kondo resonance peak near e@xmath30 will be reduced while some intensities move to higher binding energy side .",
    "therefore if each spectrum is normalized to its maximum height before subtraction , as we did in our case , a dip will show up near the fermi level with negative intensity in the difference spectra .",
    "this phenomenon of overlapping auger emissions in the ce 3@xmath4-edge rpes spectra is not limited to the particular case of cefe@xmath1 . in fig . 4 and fig .",
    "5 are shown the ce 3@xmath4-edge rpes data for ceni@xmath1 and cesi@xmath1 , respectively , taken at various incident photon energies .",
    "again , we see that they both show changes of spectral shapes depending on the photon energy , similar to the case of cefe@xmath1 . the two spectra of ceni@xmath1 in fig.4 are obtained with the incident photon energy of 882.34ev ( e ) and 881.54ev ( a ) , which are very close to each other and roughly corresponds to two maximum points of @xmath19 xas spectrum of ceni@xmath1 in fig . 1 .",
    "but these two 4@xmath0 spectral weights have appreciably different shapes in that the spectrum at photon energy e shows a fairly strong peak around 0.8ev binding energy , which becomes very weak or absent in the spectrum a. to understand the origin of this change of spectral shape , we again took the difference spectrum of the two and showed it at the bottom of fig .",
    "4 . we can see in this difference spectrum a broad peak with its maximum around 0.8ev binding energy , which is exactly the difference of the photon energy and therefore corresponds to the constant kinetic energy feature .",
    "this tells us that in this case of ceni@xmath1 as well the origin of this phenomenon is the same as the case of cefe@xmath1 discussed earlier , and the overlapping auger emissions between different multiplets of @xmath31 intermediate state contribute to the lineshape change with the incident photon energy .",
    "the cesi@xmath1 spectra shown in fig .",
    "5 gives the same story , although the phenomenon does not look as pronounced as in the case of ceni@xmath1 .",
    "in the newly - developed ce 3@xmath4-edge resonance photoemission technique for the study of bulk electronic structures of ce compounds , the spectral shapes were found to depend sensitively on the incident photon energy . by analyzing ce 3@xmath4-edge rpes valence band spectra of cefe@xmath1 , ceni@xmath1 , and cesi@xmath1 compounds",
    "systematically , we showed that this phenomenon originated from the auger transition between different multiplet structures of @xmath32 electronic configuration in the intermediate state of the resonance process .",
    "although we only showed the data on cefe@xmath1 , ceni@xmath1 , and cesi@xmath1 in this paper , we found similar results for other ce compounds as well , and expect this phenomenon to be universal for any ce compounds .",
    "hence , when the ce @xmath0 spectral weights are obtained with the ce @xmath2-edge rpes technique , it is very important to avoid these overlapping auger emissions contributing to the spectra .",
    "the most logical choice of the incident photon energy must be that corresponding to the lowest multiplet of the 3@xmath4-edge x - ray absorption spectra .",
