    "wilson and fisher  @xcite have proposed a way to overcome this difficulty by expanding the feynman diagrams of renormalized perturbation theory in double series of @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( as regards just the critical surface ) . from this the famous @xmath6expansion of critical exponents",

    "in such a way , the number of possible constructions is increased insignificantly if non skeleton diagrams of the @xmath78th order are included .",
    "so , factor @xmath583 is corrected only slightly . for a more accurate estimation this factor",
    "is replaced by @xmath589 , which allows to conclude that the number of diagrams of the @xmath78th order in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ee ] ) increases with @xmath78 like @xmath590 , where @xmath217 is a constant .",
    "note that the diagrams of  ( [ eq : ee ] ) are obtained from the actually discussed coupled skeleton diagrams by breaking a waved line , replacing this line by a ( broken ) dashed line .",

    "( [ eq : ee ] ) , i.  e. , the @xmath120th diagram among those of the @xmath78th order . calculation of the sum over wave vectors and order  parameter ",
    "components for such a diagram is analogous to finding of the statistical sum of a random lattice formed by the lines of this diagram .",
    "two conditions must be fulfilled : first , the sum of the wave vectors coming into any of the kinks is zero , the wave vectors of the outer lines being fixed ( @xmath592 and @xmath593 ) , and , second , the same order ",
    "component is related to solid lines of a closed loop .",

    "besides , each line has his ownw `` energy '' .",
    "if normalized to @xmath14 , this energy is equal to minus logarithm of the absolute value of the factor related to the corresponding line in the diagram notation .",
    "this analogy can be used in calculation of @xmath595 . in a typical case of large @xmath78",
    "this yields @xmath596 , where @xmath597 with @xmath219 represents the absolute value and @xmath598  the sign of this term .",
    "this result remains true ( with new value of @xmath221 ) if the combinatorial factor is included , since the latter is @xmath599 for any random diagram having no symmetry elements ( see sect .  [",
    "sec : notation ] ) .      for convenience",
    ", here we consider the one  component case @xmath468 , since the specific ( natural ) value of @xmath8 is irrelevant in the present scaling analysis .",
    "the hamiltonian of the considered model @xmath600 d { \\bf x } \\eqno(b1)\\ ] ] in the fourier representation is @xmath601 summation in eq .",
    "( b2 ) is performed within @xmath602 ( here @xmath603 ) .",
    "points in the @xmath3space are separated by a distance @xmath604 , where @xmath501 is the linear size of the system with volume @xmath605 at @xmath2 . by a formal change of variables @xmath606 , @xmath607 , @xmath608 , and @xmath609 , where @xmath610 we obtain @xmath611 where @xmath612 with @xmath613 .",
    "( b3 ) the summation is performed within @xmath614 .",
    "points are separated by a distance @xmath615 . according to equations  ( b2 ) and ( b3 ) ,",
    "we have ( fluctuation modes with @xmath616 are excluded ) @xmath617 where , at a fixed @xmath305 and @xmath618 , @xmath619 is a function of the given arguments only .",
    "the latter is true since the only parameters contained in hamiltonian  ( b3 ) are @xmath620 , @xmath621 , and @xmath622 .",
    "for the same reason , the critical value of @xmath621 depends merely on @xmath620 , and the correlation function at the critical point is @xmath623 it follows from eq .",
    "( b5 ) that the width of the critical region for @xmath207 is @xmath624 where @xmath625 is a single  argument function . here",
    "both @xmath305 and the accuracy parameter @xmath253 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : kcr ] ) are considered as fixed quantities . according to the relation between @xmath626 and @xmath3 , we have @xmath627 , which yields @xmath628 similarly , by using eq .",
    "( b5 ) we obtain an exact scaling relation for the asymptotic expansion at @xmath10 , i.  e. , @xmath629 where @xmath630 and terms with @xmath144 are corrections to scaling with the amplitudes represented in the scaled form @xmath631 it is evident from eq .",
    "( b6 ) that @xmath632 can exponentially ( like @xmath633 with @xmath634 ) tend to zero at @xmath143 only if the function @xmath625 decreases exponentially at @xmath635 .",
    "let us now consider the behavior of @xmath632 at @xmath636 at fixed @xmath69 and @xmath102 .",
    "we conclude immediately : if @xmath632 decreases exponentially at @xmath143 , then this quantity behaves in the same way at @xmath636 .",
    "physically , this means that the width of the critical region is strongly affected by short ",
    "wave fluctuations and the effect dramatically ( exponentially ) increases with shortening of the wavelength .",
    "the latter is rather unphysical , since the critical behavior is well known to be governed by long  wave fluctuations .",
    "thus , @xmath632 can not decrease exponentially ( or , in general , faster than @xmath637 at any @xmath638 ) at @xmath143 , which means that @xmath639 holds at large enough @xmath259 . based on eq .",
