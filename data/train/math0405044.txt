    "in the analysis of contingency tables using log - linear models , the maximum likelihood estimate ( mle ) of the underlying parameters ( or equivalently of the expectations of the cell counts ) plays a fundamental role for computation , the assessment of model fit , and model interpretation .",
    "in particular , the existence of the mle is crucial for the determination of degrees of freedom of traditional @xmath0 large sample approximations ( see , for example , * ? ? ? * ) and for exact or approximate techniques for computing @xmath1-values . if the mle does not exist , then the standard procedures and their approximations require alteration .",
    "the characterizations of the conditions for the existence of the mle developed in the statistical literature are non - constructive , in the sense that they do not directly lead to a numerical implementation ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix  b ) . as a result ,",
    "the possibility of the nonexistence of the mle is rarely considered by practitioners and the only available indication of it is a lack of convergence of the iterative algorithms used to approximate the mle .",
    "the problem of nonexistence has long been known to relate to the presence of zero cell counts in the table , e.g. , see @xcite .",
    "zero counts arise frequently in large sparse tables where the total sample size is small relative to the number of cells in the table , e.g. , see @xcite .",
    "thus for small contingency tables with a large sample size , the nonexistence of the mle is a relatively infrequent problem .",
    "this is because for small contingency tables ( nearly ) all of the cell entries in the table will be positive , which , as we will see , guarantees the existence of the mle .",
    "however , the nonexistence of the mle is a potentially common problem in applications in the biological , medical , and social sciences , where the contingency tables which arise are large and sparse .",
    "unfortunately , in many such applications researchers  collapse \" large sparse tables to form one of smaller dimension and/or size . as @xcite and @xcite make clear , such collapsing can lead to erroneous statistical inferences about associations among the variables displayed in the table .",
    "the goals of this paper are two - fold .",
    "first , we show that the nonexistence of the mle is equivalent to the margins of the observed contingency table lying on a facet of the marginal cone of the underlying hierarchical log - linear model .",
    "this polyhedral reinterpretation of the problem immediately leads to easily implementable algorithms for determining whether or not the mle exists given an observed contingency table and , in event the mle does not exist , for identifying those zero cell counts that cause the non - existence problem .",
    "we discuss these algorithms in section [ sec : exist ] . from the practical standpoint",
    ", this characterization gives a simple way to check whether or not the mle exists before using numerical methods to estimate the mle .    the second goal of this paper is to alert the mathematical reader to a rich source of combinatorial problems that arise from statistical applications .",
    "the polyhedral cones we are concerned with have received attention in various guises ( e.g. , the `` correlation polytope '' in @xcite and the `` marginal polytope '' in @xcite ) .",
    "thus our particular problem of deciding if a point in this cone is on a facet is a new variation on an old theme . given recent computational advances , this also suggests the problem of developing efficient algorithms for computing the convex hulls of highly symmetric polyhedra .",
    "we discuss these issues in section [ sec : three ] .",
    "the outline for this paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : hier ]",
    "we define hierarchical models and the mle , and we show that the mle exists if and only if the observed margins belong to the relative interior of a polyhedron . in section",
    "[ sec : exist ] we use this fact to describe an algorithm for checking the existence of the mle .",
    "the algorithm uses linear programming and runs in polynomial time if the tree width of the model is bounded . section  [ sec : three ] focuses on the study of the complexity of the problem for 3-way tables .",
    "in particular , we consider the collapsing operation that preserves some combinatorial properties of a contingency table .",
    "in this section , we introduce hierarchical models and the maximum likelihood estimate and we show that the maximum likelihood estimate exists if and only if certain polyhedral conditions are satisfied . for this and the remaining sections",
    ", we assume the reader is familiar with the basics of polyhedral geometry . two standard references are @xcite for basics on polyhedra and @xcite for algorithmic aspects including linear programming . our polyhedral condition is a reformulation of a result of @xcite .",
    "contingency tables are collections of non - negative integers arising from cross - classifying a set of objects into categories or cells indexed by a set of labels @xmath2 corresponding to variables of interest ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "more precisely , we get a @xmath3-way contingency table @xmath4 by taking a sample of independent and identically distributed observations on a vector of @xmath3 discrete random variables @xmath5 .",

    "the statistical analysis of tables using log - linear models focuses on inference about parameters in a model or equivalently on inferences about the mean vector @xmath15 of the observed table under the assumption that @xmath16 , so that @xmath17 is well defined .",
    "there are interesting extensions of the ideas in this paper to situations where we know a priori that some entries of @xmath18are zero ( c.f . , @xcite ) .",
    "log - linear models arise from assuming @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is a @xmath1-dimensional linear subspace @xmath21 such that @xmath22 .",
    "a common way of obtaining @xmath20 is by specifying a hierarchical model . a hierarchical model is determined by a simplicial complex @xmath23 on @xmath3 vertices from which a 0 - 1 matrix @xmath24 is constructed whose rows span @xmath20 in the following way",
    ". let @xmath25 be the facets of @xmath23 and , for each @xmath26 and @xmath27 , let @xmath28 $ ] and @xmath29 be the restriction of @xmath30 to @xmath31 .",
    "let @xmath32 be the set of functions on @xmath2 that depends on @xmath30 only through @xmath29 .",
    "that is , @xmath33 then the linear subspace @xmath20 corresponding to the hierarchical log - linear model @xmath23 takes the form @xmath34 let @xmath24 be a 0 - 1 matrix having dimension @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the cardinality of this index set . each row of @xmath24",
    "is indexed by the pair @xmath38 and is equal to the indicator function @xmath39 , a vector in @xmath40 which is 1 on coordinates @xmath41 and 0 otherwise .",
    "then the rows of @xmath24 span @xmath42 , so a hierarchical model can be identified by a collection of @xmath3 levels @xmath43 and a simplicial complex @xmath23 on @xmath3 nodes .",
    "data displayed in the form of contingency tables arise from various sampling schemes involving the observations on the random variables ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". the results that follow are valid for the following three schemes :    poisson sampling . : :    the total number @xmath44 of counts is random ,    where , for a non - negative vector @xmath45 ,    @xmath46 , and the counts are in fact independent poisson    random variables .",

    "for each    @xmath49 , the number of counts @xmath50 is    fixed by design . here , we assume , as is commonly done in the    statistical literature , that @xmath51 is always a    face of @xmath23 .",
    "given a table @xmath4 on the fixed set of levels @xmath43 and a simplicial complex @xmath23 , the maximum likelihood estimate of @xmath52 is the point @xmath53 such that @xmath54 best approximates the unknown mean @xmath55 in the sense that it maximizes the probability of observing the actual table @xmath4 , i.e. , joint distribution of the counts @xmath4 as a function of the mean vector @xmath18 .",
    "this probability is also known as the likelihood function when we express it as a function of the parameters @xmath18 given the data @xmath4 .",
    "the log - likelihood function @xmath56 is the logarithm of the likelihood function .    for",
    "a given observed table @xmath4 , we can write the log - likelihood as : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the logarithm of the normalization constant and depends only on @xmath59 and the particular sampling scheme . for a hierarchical model @xmath23 , we can reparametrize the log - likelihood as : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the projection matrix onto @xmath62 .",
    "the _ maximum likelihood estimate _ of @xmath52 is then the vector @xmath53 such that : @xmath63 if the supremum is not attained , then the mle is not defined .",
    "the log - likelihood depends on the observed table @xmath4 only through @xmath64 or , equivalently , since the rows of @xmath24 span @xmath62 , the vector @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , in order to establish the existence and find the numerical value of the mle , we need only observe @xmath66 , the vector of margins of the observed table ; these are known as the _ minimal sufficient statistics _ for the model .",
    "surprisingly , the study of the conditions of existence of the mle has received only limited attention in the statistical literature .",
    "essentially all available results are variations of the following theorem due to @xcite :    [ thm : hab ] under any of the three sampling schemes described above , a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of the mle is that there exists @xmath67 such that @xmath68 .    for a strengthening of theorem [ thm : hab ]",
    "see @xcite . for a given log - linear model @xmath23 ,",
    "define the marginal cone @xmath69 to be the set of minimal sufficient margins , @xmath70 , where , for any matrix @xmath71 , @xmath72 indicates the cone generated by its columns .",
    "let @xmath73 denote the relative interior of @xmath74 , defined as the interior of @xmath74 with respect to its embedding into the smallest linear hull containing it .",
    "then , the following corollary provides a polyhedral reinterpretation of the conditions for the existence of the mle :    [ thm : mle ] under any of the three sampling schemes , the mle for the mean vector @xmath18 exists if and only if the margins @xmath75 belong to @xmath76 .",
    "a vector of margins @xmath77 lies in the relative interior of the polyhedral cone @xmath74 if and only if there is a table @xmath78 with strictly positive cells such that @xmath79 .",
    "theorem  [ thm : hab ] then implies that the mle exists if and only if @xmath80 .",
    "in this section , we describe algorithms for determining whether the mle for a given table @xmath59 and model @xmath23 exists . to make the mathematical statements in this section concise , we assume that @xmath81 contains extra rows determined by the faces of @xmath23 in addition to those rows determined by the facets of @xmath23 . since this over - parameterization does not change the row span @xmath42",
    ", the matrix @xmath81 describes the same hierarchical log - linear model . to implement the algorithms we describe",
    ", one can relax this condition on @xmath81 .    by corollary  [ thm : mle ] , the maximum likelihood estimate does not exist if and only if the vector of observed margins @xmath82 lies on a facet of @xmath74 .",
    "hence , we want to show that there is a nontrivial vector @xmath83 in the dual cone of @xmath74 which attains its maximum value at @xmath84 but does not attain its maximum value at some other point of @xmath74 .",
    "the existence of such a @xmath83 implies that @xmath84 lies on a facet of @xmath74 .",
    "however , this can be decided by determining if the polyhedral cone @xmath85 contains only those vectors orthogonal to the linear hull of @xmath74 .",
    "note that this linear system involves exponentially many inequalities in the number of random variables @xmath3 .",
    "we show , however , that if the model @xmath23 satisfies certain nice complexity properties , the linear system ( [ eqn : lin ] ) there is an equivalent formulation using only polynomially many inequalities . since we can solve linear programs in polynomial time ( e.g. , * ?",
    "* ) , this implies the following result :    [ thm : treewidth ] there is an algorithm for deciding the triviality of the linear program ( [ eqn : lin ] ) which runs in polynomial time in the size of the input data and the number of levels of each random variable whenever the simplicial complex @xmath23 has bounded tree width .",

    "for instance , the tree width of the @xmath3-cycle , @xmath98[23]\\cdots[(k-1)k][1k]$ ] , is always 2 since a @xmath3-cycle does not have tree width 1 ( i.e. , it is not a tree ) , and the simplicial complex @xmath99[134]\\cdots[1(k-1)k]$ ] is a decomposable complex that triangulates the @xmath3-cycle .",
    "we study the @xmath3-cycle in more detail in example  [ ex : cycle ] below .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ thm : treewidth ] follows from a series of results relating the system of linear inequalities to systems of inequalities for chordal triangulations .",

    "modulo the lineality space of @xmath104 , the extreme rays of @xmath104 are precisely the facet defining inequalities of @xmath74 on which @xmath84 lies . to show the claim",

    "this is because the set on the left of the @xmath144 projects onto @xmath103 and the set on the right of the @xmath144 is the pullback of the linear conditions which are forced in lemma  [ lem : cap ] .",
    "the statement about the complexity of the description of ( [ eqn : big ] ) follows from the fact that each of the sets @xmath145 has a description in terms of polynomially many facets since the cardinality of @xmath146 is bounded .",
    "the number of inequalities needed to describe the object on the left hand side of the @xmath144 is just the union of @xmath147 ( which is a polynomial in the number of random variables ) sets of inequalities which is each only polynomial in size .",

    "the results of our computations are displayed in table 1 .",
    "it is an interesting computational problem to use this very large symmetry group to better compute the convex hull .",
    "the set of symmetry classes of facets is small , and many of these classes come from collapsing from a smaller table .",
    "thus many of the facets are known `` for free '' and this information should be used to compute the other facets .",
    "also , the symmetry group is transitive on the extreme rays of the cone , so in principle one could hope to compute all the facets incident to a single extreme ray , and then use symmetry to recover the entire cone .    given proposition  [ prop:2pq ] , a natural conjecture is that all facets are obtained by collapsing to binary tables .",
    "unfortunately , our computations show that the situation is remarkably more complicated , and not all facets of @xmath175 for general @xmath224 are obtained by collapsing .",

    "this follows by noting that in a facet not obtained by collapsing , no two slices can have the same @xmath192 pattern . since for fixed @xmath1 and @xmath228",
    "there are only finitely many patterns , the statement follows .",
    "conjecture [ conj : col ] merely asserts that the minimal such @xmath229 is @xmath228 .",

    "the computational implementation of this description in principle allows statisticians to explore for the first time the implication of patterns of zeros in large sparse tables that lead to nonexistence and thus to recast the estimation problem in terms of extended log - linear models for a corresponding incomplete contingency table ( c.f . , @xcite ) .",
