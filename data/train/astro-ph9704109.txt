    "gravitational lensing provides a method of measuring hubble s constant at cosmological distances independently of the traditional distance ladder . in a multiply - imaged source the difference in geometrical path length and gravitational potential along each light ray results in a time delay which can be measured if the source is variable .",
    "this time delay is inversely proportional to @xmath3 with the constant of proportionality that depends on the mass distribution in the lens ( refsdal 1964 ) .    though simple in principle",
    ", refsdal s method has been difficult to implement , because of demanding observations required to determine the time delays . in the double quasar",
    "0957 + 561a , b ( walsh , carswell , & weymann 1979 ) , there has been a long controversy over the correct value of the delay ( haarsma et  al .",
    "1997 and references therein ) that was only recently resolved by kundi et  al .",
    "( 1995 , 1996 ) . combined with the lens model of grogin & narayan ( 1996 ) , the galaxy velocity dispersion of falco et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) , and the cluster mass model of fischer et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) , this time delay yields @xmath4 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 .",
    "the second lens with a known time delay is the quadruple quasar pg  1115 + 080 ( schechter et  al .",
    "1997 , bar - kana 1997 ) .",
    "this system consists of four images of a @xmath5 quasar ( weymann et  al .  1980",
    ") lensed by a foreground group of galaxies at @xmath6 ( henry & heasley 1986 ; angonin - willaime , hammer , & rigaut 1993 ) .",
    "hst imaging of pg  1115 + 080 established the relative positions of the four quasar images with an uncertainty of 5 mas and the centroid of the lensing galaxy with an uncertainty of 50 mas ( kristian et  al .",
    "1993 ) . a schematic diagram of the system is shown in fig .  1 of keeton & kochanek ( 1996 , hereafter kk96 ) .",
    "we adopt their galaxy designations ( based on young et  al .  1981 ) , in which the primary lens is named g , and the nearby group members are named g1 , g2 , and g3 .",
    "the goals of this paper are ( 1 ) to provide an accurate redshift for the primary lensing galaxy and thus reduce the uncertainty in the derived value of @xmath3 , ( 2 ) to establish that g , g1 , g2 , and g3 belong to the same group of galaxies , and ( 3 ) to estimate the velocity dispersion of this group .",
    "optical spectra of pg  1115 + 080 were obtained on two nights , 1997 february 7 and 1997 march 2 , with the low resolution imaging spectrometer ( oke et  al .",
    "1995 ) at the keck ii 10-m telescope .",
    "table  1 lists the relevant observing parameters .",
    "the first two exposures were taken with the 300 line / mm grating and the 0.7@xmath7 slit , and the other three with the 600 line / mm grating and the 1.0@xmath7 slit .",
    "the resulting spectral resolution , as measured from unresolved sky lines , was approximately 7   in the low - resolution spectra and 4.5   in the high - resolution spectra .",
    "the seeing was @xmath8 in exposures 1 and 2 , and @xmath9 in exposures 35 .",
    "the spectra were reduced in a standard fashion using the `` longslit '' and `` apextract '' packages in iraf . in the case of the main lensing galaxy g",
    ", we had to subtract the contaminating quasar light from the galaxy spectrum .",
    "galaxy g is located approximately halfway between images a and c , which are separated by about 2 arcseconds . in the @xmath10 band , where the spectrograph is most sensitive ,",
    "image a is @xmath114 magnitudes brighter than g , and image c is @xmath12 magnitudes brighter .",
    "we thus proceeded by first extracting the image a spectrum and then shifting the trace by 1 and 2 arcseconds to extract the spectra of galaxy g and image c. the contribution of image a to the galaxy aperture was then subtracted using an aperture on the opposite side of the image a center .",
    "the same was repeated for image c. the resulting galaxy spectrum is shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ acg.fig ] , while the spectra of quasar images a and c are shown in the top two panels .",
    "note that no correction for galaxy contamination was made to the quasar fluxes . some of the stronger galaxy absorption lines can thus be seen in the image c spectrum .    for each spectrum",
    "the wavelength solution was derived using sky emission lines identified in the atlas of osterbrock et  al.(1996 ) . after fitting a 4th order legendre polynomial to 1020 strong , isolated lines ,",
    "the rms residuals were typically @xmath13  . in order to minimize systematic errors ,",
    "the sky spectra were extracted on both sides of each galaxy spectrum , independently calibrated and averaged for the final wavelength solution .",
    "the shift between the two calibrations was in all cases smaller than 0.5  .",
    "approximate redshifts of the lensing galaxies were first estimated from strong absorption features in the spectra , particularly the ca ii h and k lines and the g band .",
    "these features , along with the balmer series lines and the mg ib triplet , are marked with dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ g123.fig ] .",
    "accurate redshifts were then determined by cross - correlating the galaxy spectra with stellar templates of jones ( 1996 ) available on the aas cd - rom 7 ( leitherer et  al.1997 ) .",
    "only g and k giants were used , since they provide the closest match to the spectral characteristics of the early type galaxies in the lensing group .",
    "the results of the cross - correlation analysis are summarized in table  2 .",
    "the errors listed in the table were calculated from the width of the cross - correlation peak ( tonry & davis 1979 ) and an estimate of the systematic error in wavelength calibration .",
    "our results are consistent with the previous measurement of the g1 and g2 redshifts by henry & heasley ( 1986 ) , and marginally consistent ( at 3@xmath14 ) with the g redshift reported by angonin - willaime et  al .",
    "the spectra of g , g1 , g2 , and g3 clearly show that they belong to a single group of galaxies at the redshift of @xmath0 ( fig .",
    "[ g123.fig ] ) .",
    "the rest frame line - of - sight velocity dispersion of this group is @xmath15 km s@xmath2 , where the formal error includes only the uncertainty in the individual galaxy redshifts .",
    "because of the small number of galaxies used to derive @xmath16 , the velocity dispersion of the mass associated with the lensing group could be substantially larger ( ramella et  al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "properties of the lensing group in pg  1115 + 080 are very similar to those of hickson s compact groups ( hcgs ) of galaxies ( hickson 1982 , hickson et  al .",
    "the median projected separation of galaxies in the lensing group is 35 @xmath17 kpc ( for @xmath18 ) , as compared to @xmath19 @xmath17 kpc for hcgs ( we quote the median with upper and lower quartiles ) .",
    "the one - dimensional velocity dispersion of 270 km s@xmath2 is also within the range of @xmath20 km s@xmath2 characteristic of hcgs .",
    "the absolute magnitudes of the lensing galaxies are less certain , but if we adopt @xmath21 for the primary lens ( kk96 ) , the range of magnitudes in the lensing group , @xmath22 , is compatible with @xmath23 .",
    "the gravitational potential associated with the group is crucial for the models of pg  1115 + 080 , because it provides an independent source of shear required to obtain a statistically acceptable fit to the observables ( kk96 ; keeton , kochanek , & seljak 1996 ) . as in the case of q0957 + 561",
    ", however , the presence of an extended perturber introduces a degeneracy into the models ( falco , gorenstein , & shapiro 1985 ) that can only be removed if the mass of the primary lens or the perturbing group are independently measured .",
    "these estimates can be obtained from the line - of - sight velocity dispersions of the galaxy and the group .",
    "the former requires high signal - to - noise , moderate ( @xmath24  ) resolution spectroscopy of the lensing galaxy ( e.g. falco et  al.1997 ) , a challenging observation because of the proximity of bright quasar images .",
    "the velocity dispersion of the group can be improved from our current estimate if additional galaxies associated with the group are found in the vicinity of the lens ( ramella et  al .",
    "1994 ) . a deeper spectroscopic survey of the field would thus be highly desirable .",
    "in the expression for the gravitational lens time delay , it is common to separate the lens model dependence from the cosmological scale factor ( e.g. blandford & narayan 1992 ) : @xmath25 \\quad , \\ ] ] where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the image and source positions ; @xmath28 is the scaled surface potential ; and @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 are the angular diameter distances observer  lens , observer  source , and lens  source . in a given lens model specified by @xmath28 ,",
    "the value of the hubble constant derived from the differential time delays , @xmath32 , is inversely proportional to @xmath33 .",
    "this factor @xmath34 also depends on the source and lens redshifts , and the choice of cosmological parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 .    for the source redshift of @xmath37 and the lens redshift of @xmath38 , the cosmological scale factor",
    "@xmath34 takes the values of 31.3 , 33.7 , 32.6 , and 32.7 @xmath17 days arcsec@xmath39 when @xmath40 = @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 respectively . in the @xmath45 = @xmath41 cosmology , the lens model of kk96 then implies @xmath1 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 .",
    "this value is approximately 3% higher than the one quoted by kk96 who use @xmath46 .",
    "it is worth noting that @xmath34 is much less sensitive to @xmath35 and @xmath36 than the angular diameter distances involved , making the derived value of @xmath3 robust with respect to the choice of the world model ( blandford & kochanek 1987 , blandford & kundi 1997 ) .",
    "for the same reason , the time delay method is not an effective way to constrain @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "in this paper we demonstrate that the main lensing galaxy in the gravitational lens system pg  1115 + 080 and its three neighbors belong to a single group at @xmath47 . with its velocity dispersion of @xmath48",
    "km s@xmath2 and median projected galaxy separation of 35 @xmath17 kpc , this group is very similar to hickson s compact groups of galaxies discovered at lower redshifts .",
    "the presence of the group is important for the models of the system , because it provides an additional source of shear required to explain the observed image configuration .",
    "such a two  shear model has been constructed by kk96 . using bar - kana s ( 1997 ) analysis of schechter et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) light curves , the kk96 model implies @xmath1 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 in an einstein - desitter universe .",
