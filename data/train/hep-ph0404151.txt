    "core collapse supernovae are a huge source of all flavor neutrinos .",
    "neutrino astrophysics entered a new phase with the detection of neutrinos from the supernova sn1987a in the large magellanic cloud by the kamiokande and imb detectors @xcite . in spite of these fundamental neutrino observations ,",
    "the 19 events observed are not statistically significant enough to obtain precise quantitative information on the neutrino spectrum . currently running neutrino detectors like superkamiokande @xcite or sno @xcite have the capabilities to provide high statistics information about supernova and neutrino properties if a supernova collapse were to take place in the near future .",
    "the flavor composition , energy spectrum and time structure of the neutrino burst from a galactic supernova can give information about the explosion mechanism and the mechanisms of proto neutron star cooling .    the neutrino signal from a galactic supernova",
    "can also give information about the flavor oscillation of neutrinos .",
    "although new data from solar , atmospheric , reactor and accelerator neutrinos @xcite have contributed to the understanding of the neutrino properties , still the neutrino mixing angle 13 and the nature of the mass hierarchy , i.e. , normal or inverted , remain unknown .",
    "only an upper limit on the mixing angle is available dominated by negative measurements from reactor experiments @xcite .",
    "these parameters can be probed by the observation of supernovae neutrino bursts , since neutrinos will travel long distances before reaching the earth and will , as they travel through the exploding star , in addition traverse regions of different matter densities where matter enhanced oscillations @xcite will take place . in the case of the 13 angle ,",
    "matter enhancement has the striking feature that very small mixing angles , beyond any value detectable by next generation accelerators , could in fact alter significantly the neutrino spectrum .",
    "hence , supernova neutrinos provide indeed a complementary tool to study the 13 angle .",
    "the main question of course is to understand to which extend can the supernova and the neutrino physics be decoupled in the observation of a single supernova . on one hand , the understanding of the supernova explosion mechanism",
    "is still plagued by uncertainties which have an impact on the precision with which one can predict time , energy and flavor - dependent neutrino fluxes .",
    "on the other hand , the intrinsic neutrino properties are not fully known , since the type of mass hierarchy and the value of the 13 angle are unknown .    the total event rates and the energy spectra of the detected supernova neutrinos depend on the neutrino flavor and on the 13 mixing angle and the type of mass hierarchy .",
    "however , it is not a priori easy to separate neutrino and supernova physics .",
    "different solutions to this problem have been proposed .",
    "global fits of data ( @xcite ) and analyses considering qualitative features of the supernova neutrino fluxes ( @xcite ) have been performed for the case of erenkov detectors .",
    "the potential of liquid scintillator detectors has also be investigated ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have already qualitatively illustrated in our paper @xcite that four independent channels are a priori accessible with a liquid argon tpc : elastic scattering on electrons , @xmath0  charged current absorption on argon , @xmath1  charged current absorption on argon and neutral current interactions on argon .",
    "they have different sensitivities to electron - neutrino , anti - electron - neutrino and other neutrino flavors ( muon and tau ( anti)neutrinos ) .",
    "these events being sensitive to different combinations of neutrino and antineutrino flavors can be combined to over - constrain the features of the supernova fluxes that are at the moment not well constrained by theory and the mixing parameters and allow neutrino and supernova physics effects to be disentangled .    in the present paper",
    "we study quantitatively the capability of lar tpc detectors to simultaneously measure the supernova and oscillation parameters , performing a global fit to the event energy distribution for elastic and charged current events and to the rate for the neutral current events .",
    "this study is motivated by the 3 kton lar icarus experiment @xcite that was proposed at the gran sasso laboratory , and by ideas for a very large liquid argon tpc with a mass in the range of 100 ktons ( see @xcite and independently @xcite ) .",
    "we briefly summarize in this section the neutrino features relevant for this analysis .",
    "we essentially follow the general framework already described in our previous paper @xcite .      at the end of the life of a massive star with a core mass greater than the chandrasekhar mass , the energy generation in the core stops , and the star undergoes a fast gravitational collapse . within a duration of tens of milliseconds",
    ", this collapse compresses the inner core beyond nuclear matter densities . during this",
    "stage electron neutrinos are produced via neutronisation processes .",
    "while the electron neutrinos produced could escape the star during the first period ( producing the `` neutrino burst '' ) , the very dense core becomes opaque to neutrinos which remain captured within the supernova core producing the so - called inner core rebound .",
    "this generates a shock wave which propagates radially outward through the star remnants , supplying the `` explosion '' mechanism . during the shock phase , thermal neutrinos and antineutrinos of all flavors",
    "are produced due to high temperatures .",
    "it is believed that the 99% of the total binding energy of the star ,  @xmath2 3 @xmath3 10@xmath4 ergs , is emitted in the form of neutrinos .",
    "these neutrinos are in equilibrium with their surrounding matter density and their energy spectra can be described by a function close to a fermi - dirac distribution .",
    "the flux of a neutrino @xmath5 emitted can then be written as @xcite :    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the luminosity of the flavor @xmath5",
    "(= @xmath8 ) , @xmath9 is the distance to the supernova , @xmath10 is the energy of the @xmath5 neutrino , @xmath11 is the neutrino temperature inside the neutrinosphere and @xmath12 is the `` pinching '' factor .",
    "we have taken @xmath12 = 0 and hence no deviations in the high energy tail are considered .",
    "the neutrino average energy @xmath13 depends on both @xmath11 and @xmath12 . for @xmath12 = 0 , @xmath14 @xmath2 3.15 @xmath11 .",
    "the normalization factor in absence of pinching is equal to @xmath15 5.68 .",
    "the original @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18  and @xmath19  fluxes are approximately equal and therefore we treat them as @xmath20 . out of all neutrinos ,",
    "muon and tau neutrinos and their antiparticles interact with matter through neutral currents only , whereas electron neutrinos and their antiparticles feel both charged and neutral currents .",
    "therefore , muon and tau flavors should decouple first and hence have the largest temperatures .",
    "this energy hierarchy between the different neutrino flavors is generally believed to hold and imply @xmath21 , due to the different strength of neutrino interactions with the surrounding matter .",
    "however , the specific neutrino spectra remain a matter of detailed calculations .",
    "in particular , the simulations of raffelt et al .",
    "@xcite seem to indicate that the energy differences between flavors could be very small .",
    "we use a range of typical values of the neutrino average energies and relative luminosities provided by several simulations in the following intervals @xcite : @xmath22 @xmath23 in practice , we will consider two specific scenarios ( i & ii ) in order to understand the effects of a hierarchical versus non - hierarchical distribution of energies on our results , see below , and take luminosity equipartition . some detailed simulations",
    "may also give rise to cases where the electron luminosities of the neutrinos vary between ( 0.52 ) times the muon and tau luminosities .",
    "we did not explicitly consider this case , even though our calculations could be extended to such a case . we will be later concerned on how well one can determine the energies and the relative luminosities of the neutrinos through the detection of a single supernova collapse .",
    "we consider core collapse supernovae at a distance @xmath9 of 10 kpc ( galactic supernovae ) .",
    "we assume that in the actual event of a supernova , this distance will be precisely estimated by independent astronomical observations and we hence take this value as precisely known in our discussion .    in order to parameterize the supernova physics ,",
