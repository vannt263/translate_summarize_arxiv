    "cold atoms in optical lattices currently constitute one of the most flexible and , hence , most promising ways to investigate areas of many - particle physics for which no established knowledge prevails .",
    "one such area is that of strongly correlated systems , for which neither the ground - state nor excited states can be easily described and for which no generic analytic tools with predictive power are presently available .",
    "the situation is even more difficult for non - equilibrium processes , where , in general , a full knowledge of the eigenstates of the system is needed in order to properly describe its dynamics out of equilibrium .",
    "recent experimental work has succeeded in producing one of the hallmarks of strong correlations , namely , a mott insulator @xcite . remarkably , this was achieved with bosons , a situation not easily encountered in condensed matter physics .",
    "even the limit of very strong interactions , where the bosons can be considered to be impenetrable particles ( hard - core bosons or a tonks - girardeau gas @xcite ) could be reached experimentally @xcite .",
    "such a limit is attainable in elongated traps for large positive three - dimensional scattering lengths , at low densities , or with very strong transversal confinement @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the study of the non - equilibrium dynamics of quantum gases was instrumental for understanding their properties @xcite .",
    "more recently , a controlled study of the evolution of one - dimensional bose gases prepared initially out of equilibrium was performed @xcite , opening up the possibility of investigating the role of integrability in the relaxation dynamics of a many - body system @xcite . in the case of hard - core bosons in one dimension",
    ", the evolution of a system with an arbitrary initial state can be described theoretically in an exact way @xcite via an exact mapping onto free fermions , the jordan - wigner transformation @xcite .",
    "we concentrate here on the out - of - equilibrium evolution of a one - dimensional bose gas with strong interactions whose initial state is a mott insulator .",
    "it was previously shown that , in the hard - core limit , an initial fock state develops quasi - long - range correlations when the bosons are allowed to evolve freely on a lattice @xcite . in particular , the momentum distribution function @xmath2 develops sharp peaks at momenta @xmath3 , where @xmath1 is the lattice constant .",
    "an examination of the one - particle density matrix shows that , after the formation of the peaks in @xmath4 , it decays as @xmath5 at long distances , as it does for hard - core bosons in equilibrium @xcite , demonstrating that , in fact , the peaks in @xmath4 signal the emergence of quasi - coherence at a finite wavevector .",
    "a detailed picture of the ( quasi-)coherent part is obtained by examining the lowest natural orbital ( no ) , i.e. , the eigenvector of the one - particle density matrix corresponding to the largest eigenvalue .",
    "once the peaks in @xmath4 form , the no evolve at a constant velocity @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the nearest neighbor hopping amplitude , without appreciable change in their form .",
    "these are the maximal group velocities on a lattice with a dispersion @xmath8 .",
    "the process of formation of the quasi - condensate is also characterized by a power law .",
    "the population of the quasi - condensate increases in a universal way as @xmath9 , as a function of the evolution time @xmath10 , independently of the initial number of particles in the fock state .",
    "the time @xmath11 at which the maximal occupation of the no is reached depends linearly on the number of particles @xmath12 in the initial fock state , and is given by @xmath13 .",
    "the appearance of quasi - condensates at @xmath3 can be understood on the basis of total energy conservation .",
    "given the dispersion relation of hard - core bosons on a lattice , since the initial fock state has a flat momentum distribution function , its total energy is @xmath14 .",
    "if all the particles were to condense into one state , it would be to the one with an energy @xmath15 .",
    "taking into account the dispersion relation @xmath16 , @xmath17 corresponds to @xmath3 .",
    "actually , since there is only quasi - condensation in the one - dimensional case , the argument above applies only in that the occupation of a given state is maximized .",
    "in addition , the minimum in the density of states at these quasi - momenta strengthens the quasi - condensation into a single momentum state .    since",
    "hard - core bosons can be treated exactly @xcite , they are extremely well - suited for a theoretical study of nonequilibrium dynamics because large systems ( with hundreds to thousands of bosons ) can be examined over long times .",
    "however , the experimental investigation is hampered by the quite stringent requirements for the realization of such systems .",
    "we therefore consider here the case of finite interactions , modeled by the one - dimensional hubbard model @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are bosonic creation and annihilation operators , respectively , and @xmath21 is the density operator .",
    "the hard - core limit corresponds to @xmath22 .",
    "the value at which the mott insulator appears has been estimated as @xmath23 in one dimension for a commensurate density @xmath24 @xcite . hence , all the cases considered here correspond to @xmath25 .    as in the hard - core case , we start with bosons in a mott - insulating state spread over several lattice sites and monitor the free expansion on a lattice . for the time evolution of the system",
    ", it is , in principle , necessary to treat the whole hilbert space of the system , restricting exact treatments to extremely small systems . instead of fully diagonalizing the hamiltonian matrix , efficient iterative eigensolvers such as the lanczos or the jacobi - davidson procedure",
    "are commonly used @xcite , enabling one to treat somewhat larger systems .",
    "unfortunately , the lanczos method is limited by the exponential growth of the hilbert space as a function of the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "therefore , a more efficient way of representing the relevant subspaces for the time evolution is needed .",
    "recent progress in this direction was achieved by extending the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method @xcite to treat the time evolution of correlated systems @xcite , leading to the so - called t - dmrg .    here",
    "we apply the t - dmrg to study the expansion of soft - core bosons out of a mott insulator and compare it to the hard - core case .",
    "it will be shown that the essential features obtained with hard - core bosons are preserved , while new control possibilities are opened by tuning the strength of the interaction @xmath26 .",
    "we will also show that further control of the momentum of the emerging quasi - condensates can be achieved by introducing a superlattice , which is obtained by superimposing an extra periodic potential onto an already existing lattice potential .",
    "such systems have been recently realized experimentally with ultracold gases trapped on optical lattices @xcite , and have been studied theoretically by various mean field approaches @xcite , quantum - monte carlo simulations @xcite , and exact diagonalization @xcite .    in sec .  [",

    "[ sec : superlattice ] , we study how the introduction of a superlattice allows further control of the emerging quasi - condensates . for these systems",

    "the general solution of the schrdinger equation for a many - body system can only be given in a formal way , that for a time - independent hamiltonian is @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the hamiltonian determining the evolution over a time @xmath10 from some initial time @xmath31 .",
    "for sufficiently small systems , full diagonalization of @xmath30 is possible , and a knowledge of all the eigenvalues and eigenstates allows for an exact determination of the evolved state .",
    "however , for a general many - body system , the size of the hilbert space grows exponentially with the number of degrees of freedom , restricting the system size essentially to tens of atoms .",
    "more efficient ways of determining the time evolution are discussed in the following subsections .",
    "here we focus on the lanczos procedure , which can be generalized in a straightforward way so that the time evolution of the system can be computed without calculating all eigenstates .",
    "the basic idea is to expand the time - evolution operator , @xmath32 and to focus on the set of states @xmath33 , which spans the so - called krylov subspace .",
    "the key idea of the lanczos method is to obtain a basis by orthogonalizing the vectors of the krylov subspace only with respect to the previous two elements of the set , leading to the recursion relation @xmath34 for the vectors @xmath35 of the lanczos basis .",
    "the projection of the hamiltonian onto this basis set leads to a tridiagonal matrix @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is a rectangular matrix containing the lanczos vectors as column vectors . in this way",
    ", the hamiltonian @xmath38 can be efficiently diagonalized .    using this approach ,",
    "an approximation for the time evolution of a given state @xmath39 at time @xmath10 over a small time interval @xmath40 can be given .",
    "for a time - independent hamiltonian it reads @xmath41 remarkably , an exact bound can be given for the error in the approximation @xcite : @xmath42 \\left(\\frac{e \\rho \\delta \\tau}{4 m } \\right)^m,\\ ] ] valid for @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the width of the spectrum of @xmath30 and @xmath45 is the dimension of the krylov subspace . for @xmath46 and @xmath45 sufficiently large ( of the order of 10 )",
    ", the formula above shows almost exponential convergence .",
    "the basic idea of the density - matrix renormalization group method is to represent one or more pure states of a finite system approximately by dividing the system in two and retaining only the @xmath45 most highly weighted eigenstates of the reduced density matrix of the partial system . in combination with the numerical renormalization group approach ( nrg ) developed by wilson @xcite and the superblock algorithms developed by white and noack @xcite",
    ", this leads to a very powerful and efficient tool for the investigation of one - dimensional strongly correlated quantum systems on a lattice .",
    "here we only give a rough sketch of the method and refer to recent reviews @xcite for a detailed description .        as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : dmrg_flowchart ] , the key steps are to _ increase _ the number of degrees of freedom of the partial system by adding sites , then to _ decrease _ the number of degrees freedom by retaining states below a cutoff . in this way , the method carries out a renormalization group procedure closely related to wilson s nrg .    in the first step of the algorithm ,",
    "a site is added to one of the subsystems , with its hamiltonian _ exactly _ represented .",
    "the hamiltonian of the subsystem is usually represented in an _ efficient _ reduced basis built up from the @xmath45 most important eigenstates of its reduced density matrix .",
    "note that the basis is incomplete due to the truncation .",
    "a measure of the error @xmath47 introduced by the cutoff is the _ discarded weight _ , which measures the total weight of the discarded states @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the @xmath50 eigenvalue of the reduced density matrix .",
    "after convergence is reached , one typically obtains values @xmath51 with @xmath52 .",
    "although one is only retaining a tiny fraction of the total hilbert space of the system ( which already for small systems can reach a dimension of several million ) , the desired observables can thus be obtained with high accuracy .    in the second step of the iteration",
    ", the states one is interested in are obtained .",
    "these states are called `` target states '' . in the original ground - state algorithm ,",
    "these are the ground state and the few lowest lying excited states of the system , which are obtained by diagonalizing the hamiltonian of the _ total _ system , e.g. , by carrying out the lanczos diagonalization algorithm described in the introduction",
    ". however , states other than the eigenstates of the hamiltonian may be obtained in this step .",
    "this flexibility is crucial for the time - evolution algorithms , in which the time - evolved state is obtained by other means than solving an eigenvalue problem .    in the third step ,",
    "the new effective basis is obtained by diagonalizing the reduced density matrix of the extended subsystem , given by @xmath53 where the sum goes over all target states . in step four",
    ", only the @xmath45 eigenstates with the largest eigenvalues are kept .",
    "the operators needed to represent the hamiltonian of the subsystem , to form the pieces of the hamiltonian connecting subsystems , and to calculate observables are transformed into this new reduced basis .",
    "this effective hamiltonian of the subsystem is now the starting point for step one of the next iteration . in this way",
    ", every step improves the accuracy of the obtained eigenstates and energies by improving the reduced basis used for the representation of the target states .",
    "dmrg iteration schemes are usually divided into two classes . in the",
    "so - called _ infinite - system _ algorithm , the system grows at each step .",
    "this can be used to build up the system up to a desired lattice size . in the _ finite - system _ algorithm ,",
    "the size of the lattice is fixed , and the `` dividing bond '' , i.e. , the position at which the system is cut in two parts , is moved from the right end of the lattice to the left end and back ( other variations are possible ) .",
    "this is called a `` sweep '' . in order to obtain the ground state ( and optionally the lowest lying excited states ) with a high accuracy , the sweeps are iterated until convergence is reached .",
    "the calculation can be significantly sped up if the diagonalization in step 2 of the dmrg procedure is started with a good initial guess for the wave function .",
    "such an initial guess can be constructed using the so - called `` wave function transformation '' , which approximately transforms the wave function obtained from the previous finite - system step into the basis of the current superblock configuration .",
    "as we will see next , the wave function transformation also plays a key role in the adaptive t - dmrg schemes .    the main difficulty in calculating the time evolution using the dmrg is that the restricted basis determined at the beginning of the time evolution is not able , in general , to represent the state well at later times @xcite because it covers a subspace of the total hilbert space which is not appropriate to properly represent the state at the next time step . since both the hamiltonian and the wave function @xmath54 at time @xmath10",
    "are represented in an incomplete basis , the result for the next time step @xmath55 will have additional errors because the reduced basis is not an optimum representation for this state . in order to minimize these errors",
    ", it is necessary to form a density matrix whose @xmath45 most important eigenvectors are `` optimal '' for the representation of the state @xmath56 , as well as for @xmath57 in the reduced hilbert space .",
    "the most straightforward approach is to mix _ all _ time steps @xmath58 into the density matrix @xcite .",
    "however , this can be extremely costly computationally .",
    "a more efficient way is to _ adapt _ the density matrix at each time step .",
    "an approach for adaptive time evolution based on the trotter - suzuki @xcite decomposition of the time - evolution operator was developed in refs .",
    "the idea is to split up the time - evolution operator in _ local _ time - evolution operators @xmath59 acting only on the _ bond _ @xmath60 . for lattice hamiltonians containing only terms connecting nearest - neighbor sites ,",
    "this is easily obtained using the trotter - suzuki decomposition , which in second order is given by @xmath61 here @xmath62 and @xmath63 is the part of the hamiltonian containing terms on even and odd bonds , respectively . since each bond term @xmath64 within @xmath62 or @xmath63 commutes , @xmath65 can then be factorized into terms acting on individual bonds . as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : dmrg_flowchart ] , in the dmrg procedure usually two sites are treated exactly , i.e. , the entire hilbert space of the two sites is included . the trotter variant of the t - dmrg exploits this feature by applying @xmath66 at the bond given by the two `` exact '' sites . in this way",
    ", the time - evolution operator has no further approximations other than the error introduced by the trotter decomposition .",
    "in particular , the error introduced by the cutoff is avoided .",
    "the wave function of the lattice is then updated by performing one complete sweep over the lattice and applying @xmath59 at the `` dividing bond '' . in this way",
    ", only one wave function must be retained and it is possible to work with the density matrix for a pure state . the flowchart is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : tdmrg ] .",
    "however , the method is restricted to systems with local or nearest - neighbor terms in the hamiltonian .",
    "a more general basis adaption scheme aims at adapting the density matrix basis by approximating the density matrix for a time interval @xcite , @xmath67 $ ] . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the intermediate time steps are obtained using a runge - kutta integration scheme and using 4 or 10 intermediate time steps . here",
    "we instead obtain the intermediate time steps using the lanczos method described in sec .",
    "[ sec : lanczos ] .",
    "this can be done easily because the hamiltonian of the system is usually constructed anyway in the dmrg scheme . within the restricted basis , the lanczos iteration , eq .",
    "( [ eq : lanczos ] ) , can then be performed , leading to the desired intermediate time steps computed using eq .",
    "( [ eq : lanczos_evolution ] ) . using this approach , we find that , if the time step is small enough , it is sufficient to retain only the target state @xmath68 , so that one can work with a pure - state density matrix like in the trotter approach . for larger time steps , it is important to mix at least the states @xmath69 and @xmath70 into the density matrix .",
    "we find that it is sufficient to perform only one half - sweep in order to adapt the restricted basis , which is the minimum requirement for updating the basis on the complete lattice .",
    "the flowchart of this approach is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : tdmrg ] . with this approach ,",
    "it is , in principle , possible to treat more general hamiltonians , as long as they can be treated accurately using the dmrg .",
    "however , due to the fact that , in general , one can not work with a pure state density matrix , the dimension @xmath45 of the restricted basis needed to obtain a certain discarded weight during the time evolution is larger compared to the trotter approach described above , making this variant slower .",
    "the errors in both adaptive schemes for intermediate and long times are comparable . for the problem at hand",
    ", we therefore choose the trotter variant ( in second order ) of the adaptive time - dependent dmrg .    in this work ,",
    "we control the error during the time evolution by fixing the discarded weight and varying the number of basis states kept . by keeping a maximum of @xmath71 density matrix eigenstates ,",
    "we obtain discarded weights smaller than @xmath72 during the time evolution .",

    "in this work , we have presented non - trivial generalizations of a nonequilibrium phenomenon originally found in systems of hard - core bosons that expand out of strongly correlated mott - insulating states .",
    "first , we have shown that the emergence of coherent matter waves at finite momenta persists away from the hard - core limit , i.e. , to finite values of the on - site repulsion @xmath26 which range down to the critical values , as long as a mott - insulating state is attainable for the initial state .",
    "the accurate treatment of this complicated many - body problem has been made possible by the advent of the t - dmrg . by comparing to exact results in the hard - core case",

    "nevertheless , after the mott region melts , the momentum distribution functions of both systems become nearly identical . _",
    "( ii ) _ as the strength of the interaction is reduced , a shift of the momentum of the coherent matter wave to values smaller than @xmath146 is observed .",
    "the appearance of a power law in the spatial decay of the one - particle density matrix demonstrates explicitly the ( quasi-)coherent nature of the resulting matter wave .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that a coherent matter wave can be also obtained in the presence of superlattice potentials given an adequate selection of the initial insulating state . in the latter case ,",
    "the emerging quasi - condensates have a more complicated structure in momentum space , with a number of dominating momenta whose locations depend on the superlattice used .",
    "the results of this work show that it is possible to engineer atom lasers with a high degree of control .",
    "the momentum of the coherent matter wave can first be regulated by setting the wavelength of the underlying optical lattice and further fine - tuned by regulating the depth of the potentials in the lattice , i.e. , the intensity of the corresponding laser beam .",
    "a further finite shift of the momentum can be achieved by superimposing another laser beam with a commensurate wavelength , giving rise to a superlattice , which leads to the emergence of a matter wave with two ( or more ) dominating momenta .",
