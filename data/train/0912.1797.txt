    "mass aggregation is a fundamental process that appears in a large range of applications , such as formation of aerosols , polymerization , clustering of stars or ballistic aggregation , see for instance @xcite . in all these applications , certain types of particles form clusters that are characterized by their size or mass @xmath5 .",
    "@xcite classical mesoscopic mean - field description of irreversible aggregation processes describes the evolution of the number density @xmath6 of clusters of size @xmath5 per unit volume at time @xmath7 .",
    "clusters of size @xmath5 and @xmath8 can coalesce by binary collisions to form clusters of size @xmath9 at a rate given by a kernel @xmath10 , such that the dynamics of @xmath11 is given by @xmath12 an issue of fundamental interest in the mathematical analysis of coagulation processes is the phenomenon of dynamic scaling for homogeneous kernels .",
    "this means that for initial data from a certain class the solution to converges to a certain self - similar solution .",
    "unfortunately , except for some special kernels such as the constant one , this question is still only poorly understood ( see e.g. @xcite for an overview ) . while it has been common belief in the applied literature that self - similar solutions are unique , it has recently been shown for some special kernels @xcite that there is a whole one - parameter family of self - similar solutions .",
    "these solutions can be distinguished by their tail behavior , and their respective domains of attraction are characterized by the tail behavior of the initial data .",
    "in contrast to this , very little is known for other homogeneous kernels .",
    "the existence of fast - decaying self - similar solutions for a range of kernels is established in @xcite , but both the existence of solutions with algebraic tail and the uniqueness of solutions are still open problems . in general ,",
    "unless explicit methods such as the laplace transform work , just proving existence of self - similar solutions to a coagulation equation can be a formidable task .",
    "thus , despite their fundamental role , many properties of mean - field models for coagulation processes , in particular with respect to dynamic scaling , are not well understood .",
    "motivated by an application of elasto - capillary coalescence of wetted polyester lamellas @xcite , we investigate this question for a special singular coagulation kernel @xmath13 .",
    "this kernel allows only those clusters to coagulate that can form clusters of a given maximal size . to our knowledge this is the first mathematical analysis for such type of kernels . even though tails of the size distribution do not play a role here , we find that self - similar solutions are still not unique and the analysis of the long - time behavior turns out to be delicate .    in model considered here , two particles can coagulate only if the sum of their sizes is equal to @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is a given increasing function of time .",
    "this means that at time @xmath7 only particles of size @xmath14 are emerging and the amount of particles of all smaller sizes is decreasing .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath16 , where @xmath17 denotes the delta - distribution in @xmath18 and the factor of proportionality may depend on time .",
    "as above , we denote the number density of particles of size @xmath5 at time @xmath7 by @xmath6 .",
    "the total number of particles per unit volume at time @xmath7 is then @xmath19 . at time @xmath7 , the density of particles of any size @xmath20 is decreasing at a rate proportional to the probability density of a particle of size @xmath5 meeting a particle of size @xmath21 . the coagulation process can hence be described by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a rate function proportional to the expected number of coagulation events per unit time . motivated by @xcite we make the ansatz @xmath24 , where @xmath0 is a constant of proportionality that depends on the particular physical process .",
    "the above equation hence reads @xmath25 the coagulation process described above neither creates nor destroys mass , which is expressed by the mass conservation equation @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a constant . from ( [ eq : gen0 ] ) and ( [ eq : gen0a ] ) we will derive an equivalent condition for @xmath28 , see equation ( [ eq : gen3 ] ) below .    for @xmath29 , @xmath6 is not changing since particles of size greater than @xmath14 can not form a particle of size @xmath14 by coagulation .",
    "hence @xmath30 for @xmath29 .",
    "we are normally interested in processes where the value of @xmath15 at the starting time is greater than the size of all particles existing initially , and hence we also assume @xmath31 for @xmath29 .",
    "an important feature of equation ( [ eq : gen0 ] ) is its invariance under reparametrization of time . as a consequence @xmath14",
    "is not determined by the initial data but can be prescribed to be an arbitrary increasing function of time ( see also @xcite , where such an invariance has been crucial in the analysis of a model for min - driven clustering ) . in the following",
    "we choose @xmath32 and also normalize the mass by setting @xmath33 .",
    "consequently , in what follows we study the system of equations @xmath34 with @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the first aim of this article is to establish well - posedness of the initial value problem and to study the long time behavior of solutions to . to this end",
    ", we prove global existence and uniqueness of mild solutions in section [ sec : geu ] , theorem [ theo.existence.mild.solutions ] by rewriting as a fixed point equation .",
    "in contrast to coagulation equations with more regular kernels , for which well - posedness can often be proved in the space of probability measures @xcite , here we need to work with functions that are continuous up to the points @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the reason that the fixed - point argument is not quite straightforward is that at any time there is an influx of particles of the largest size @xmath14 that leads to a nontrivial boundary condition .    in section [ sec : sss ]",
    "we study the existence of self - similar solutions . combining rigorous arguments with numerical simulations ,",
    "we identify @xmath4 as a critical value : for @xmath2 no self - similar solutions exist but for @xmath1 we find two self - similar solutions which have different shape and stability properties .",
    "section [ sec : ltb ] is devoted to numerical simulations of initial value problems .",
    "our results for @xmath1 suggest that , after a suitable rescaling , each solution converges to the second self - similar solution . for @xmath2",
    ", however , @xmath11 converges to a steady state @xmath39 , @xmath40 , whose shape depends strongly on the initial data .",
    "we finally prove this assertion in proposition [ t.main ] for @xmath41 .",
    "in this section we derive a notion of mild solutions to that relies on an appropritate reformulation of the mass constraint @xmath42 .",
    "we then use banachs s contraction mapping theorem to prove the local existence and uniqueness of mild solutions , and finally employ some a priori estimates to show that these mild solutions exist globally in time .      to reformulate the mass constraint @xmath43",
    "we suppose that a piecewise smooth solution @xmath6 to @xmath44 and @xmath45 is given .",
    "we then have @xmath46 and due to @xmath44 we obtain @xmath47 moreover , substituting @xmath48 we find @xmath49 so ( [ eq : btw1 ] ) implies @xmath50 this condition is equivalent to @xmath43 provided that @xmath6 solves @xmath44 , and for the ease of notation we introduce the operator @xmath51 $ ] by @xmath52(t)&:=&\\frac{{k_0}}{2n(t)}\\int_0^tg(t , x)g(t , t - x)dx,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 depends on @xmath11 via @xmath45 .    in what follows",
