    "climate change is known to greatly modify the spatial ",
    "distribution of species at large spatial scale  ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "after the last glaciers retreated , for instance , many species started to expand their range into newly emerging suitable habitats  @xcite .",
    "more recently , some species have started moving their range in response to their climatic niches shifting as a result of global warming  @xcite .",
    "these processes of range shifts and range expansion in response to climate change and , in particular , mechanisms underpinning the dynamics have been analysed from both empirical to theoretical perspectives  @xcite .",
    "however , less is known about the spatial genetic consequences of range shifts induced by climate change  @xcite .",
    "range shifts are frequent during climate change  @xcite .",
    "they arise from colonisation of newly emerging suitable habitat that coincides with extirpation from areas that have become unsuitable  @xcite .",
    "colonisation at the leading edge of the range is well known to modify the patterns of neutral genetic diversity through the mechanism of gene surfing , in which neutral variants can rise to high frequency at the wavefront and propagate at the leading edge  @xcite .",
    "surfing results from strong genetic drift taking place on the edge of the population wave  @xcite because the growth rate at low density regions at the edge of the expanding population is typically higher than the growth rate for the bulk of the population  @xcite .",
    "the existence of surfing events can thus lead to a reduction in the genetic diversity of the newly colonised areas  @xcite . in the context of biological invasion or colonisation without climate change , theoretical  @xcite as well as empirical  @xcite studies",
    "have shown that these expansion processes generally erode the neutral genetic diversity at the leading edge of the colonisation or invasion wave .    range shifts or range expansions under climate change are different from colonisation or invasions into favourable environments .",
    "spatial variations in climate constrains the range of many species  @xcite , producing range boundaries and defining climate envelopes within which species can survive .",
    "thus , during range shifts or range expansions under climate change , the presence of moving climate envelopes can constrain the leading edge of the population in its expansion relative to the core of the population and may thus reduce its spreading speed . under climate change , the population s spreading speed will depend on the climate velocity as well as phenotypic characteristics of the population , such as dispersal ability and intrinsic growth rate , which define its _ potential spreading speed_its spreading speed of colonisation if there were no climate constraint .",
    "the presence of climatic envelope is also known to modify the genetic drift on the edge of the species range  @xcite . using a stochastic simulation model , @xcite and @xcite",
    "have numerically analysed the surfing phenomenon in presence of climate constraints . more precisely , using a coalescent model with a backward - time approach , they analysed the distribution of the time to common ancestry for individuals sampled along the expansion wave to derive the position of successful surfers in the wave .",
    "significant differences in the diversity patterns were found between populations that experience range expansion under climate change and populations that expand their range freely . combining their stochastic approach with the framework of reaction - diffusion equations",
    ", they were able to connect their numerical findings to analytical formulae . among other things",
    ", they concluded that surfing is possible in deterministic reaction - diffusion equations with shifting heterogeneous media .",
    "our goal is to investigate how the climate constraint determines genetic diversity in expanding or shifting range and to do so in a context that is broader than the surfing phenomenon .    during a range shift",
    ", there is also range retraction at the rear edge to consider .",
    "this process can threaten both the survival of the species  @xcite and its neutral genetic diversity  @xcite .",
    "for instance , rapid climate change can cause extinction if the species can not track the moving climate envelope because of limited dispersal  @xcite .",
    "this paper investigates how the interplay between a population , the climate velocity , and the climate envelope size determines neutral genetic diversity patterns during a climate change .",
    "it hinges on the question as to how genetic fractions evolve inside a one  dimensional wave travelling in response to climate change .",
    "clearly , the fraction at the leading edge of the wave should have a higher probability of surviving and surfing on the wave  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", this fraction may not survive if it travels too far forward into inhospitable habitat .",
    "this would enhance the predominance of remaining genetic fractions from the bulk of the wave as they emerge at the leading edge of the wave .",
    "we show that this loss into inhospitable habitat promotes genetic diversity at the leading edge of the wave .",
    "the climate velocity also plays an important role in the balance between population spread and loss . in the range shift scenario ,",
    "extirpation at the rear edge of the wave can also play a role causing loss of genetic fractions  @xcite , thus eroding genetic diversity .    following the framework provided in  @xcite ,",
    "we focus on the deterministic one - dimensional heterogeneous reaction  diffusion equations with forced speed of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 represents the population density ( of genes or haploid individuals ) at time @xmath2 and location @xmath3 . this density changes in time under the joint effects of local dispersal , accounted for by the diffusion term with diffusivity @xmath4 , and local reproduction , described by the growth function @xmath5 . since the climate conditions are not uniform in space , some regions are more favourable than others for the species .",
    "the growth function is therefore heterogeneous in space , and the term @xmath6 expresses the suitability profile of this environment . in the absence of climate change ,",
    "we assume that this environment is composed of a bounded climate envelope of a suitable habitat , surrounded by unfavourable regions where the population tends to go extinct .",
    "moreover , we only assume negative density dependence in the climate envelope , i.e. , we do not take any allee effect into account .",
    "the growth function is essentially logistic and the precise assumption on the growth term @xmath5 is described in the next section .",
    "we reflect climate change in our model by assuming that the climate envelope moves rightward in space at a constant speed @xmath7  ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : environment ] ) .",
    "described by   and composed of seven fractions , travelling to the right to track the climate envelope @xmath8 shifting with a constant speed @xmath9 in a one - dimensional environment .",
    "each neutral fraction is depicted with a different colour and with a thickness corresponding , at each position @xmath3 , to the density @xmath10 of the fraction.,width=487 ]    since skellam s work  @xcite , these models have commonly been used to explore population range expansions . on the other hand ,",
    "@xcite have also used these models to describe the change of allele frequencies in population with varying density and dispersal .",
    "the mathematical modelling novelty of this current paper , comes from combining these two approaches to describe the evolution of the inside structure of wave - like solutions associated with a shifting climate envelope . from a mathematical view point ,",
    "our analysis extend the early work of  @xcite to more realistic landscape which evolves in space and time .",
    "the solutions @xmath11 to the initial value problem for   converge to a travelling wave solution under reasonable assumptions ( to be given later ) on the function @xmath5 , the speed @xmath9 , the diffusivity @xmath12 , and the initial population density @xmath13  @xcite . in the context of climate change , these solutions describe a population that shifts its range at the same speed @xmath9 as the climate envelope and with a constant density profile @xmath14 .",
    "thus , the population density is of the form @xmath15 .",
    "following the pioneering works of  @xcite , we assume that the population wave is initially composed of several spatially distinct neutral fractions .",
    "we provide a mathematical analysis of the spatio - temporal dynamics of these fractions , i.e. , we analyse how the density of each fraction develops over time at each position in the travelling wave .",
    "this analysis contrasts with classical approaches on reaction  diffuion with heterogeneous environment which mainly focus on the dynamics of the total waves rather than the dynamics of the neutral fractions  ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) . in this paper",
    ", we provide mathematical insights into the following theoretical issues :    ( q1 ) : :    how do the densities of the various fractions evolve in a travelling    wave generated by a reaction  diffusion model with an environment that    changes with time and space ? are these travelling waves solutions of    heterogeneous reaction  diffusion pulled or pushed ? ; ( q2 ) : :    how does the presence of climate change modify the fraction densities    inside a travelling wave ? does it enhance or reduce the genetic    diversity in a colonisation front ? ( q3 ) : :    how do the species spreading potential , the climate velocity , and    the climate envelope size modify the genetic patterns inside a range    shifting in response to climate change ?",
    "we assume that the population @xmath11 is composed of several spatially distinct neutral fractions @xmath10 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : environment ] ) . to analyse the dynamics of these fractions ,",
    "we extend the mathematical notion of  _ inside dynamics _ of a solution , introduced in  @xcite and described in what follow . at time",
    "@xmath16 @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the number of fractions .",
    "we assume that the genes ( or individuals ) in each fraction differ only by their positions and their alleles ( or their labels ) , while their dispersal and growth capabilities are the same as those for the entire population @xmath11 .",
    "more precisely , the fraction density @xmath19 grows according to @xmath6 rescaled by the fraction frequency or allele frequency @xmath20 .",
    "each density @xmath10 therefore satisfies the following equations : @xmath21              \\upsilon^i(0,x )   =   \\upsilon_0^i(x ) , \\ x\\in\\r .",
    "\\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] as expected , it follows from the uniqueness of the solution to the initial value problem associated with   that the sum of the fraction densities @xmath10 is equal to the population density @xmath11 .",
    "our decomposition approach gives a conceptual framework for describing and analysing the diversity dynamics of a population that is shifting its range due to climate change .",
    "more precisely , for each @xmath22 we denote the frequency of fraction @xmath23 in the population @xmath11 by @xmath24 .",
    "we can define at each location @xmath25 and time @xmath26 a family of diversity measures @xmath27 in terms of @xmath28 , where @xmath29 $ ] ; see  @xcite .",
    "these indices quantify the local diversity according to the fraction frequency @xmath28 and the sensitivity parameter @xmath30 .",

    "for example , at one extreme @xmath32 , the index @xmath33 corresponds to species richness , attaching as much significance to rare fractions as to common ones . at the other extreme @xmath34 , the index of  @xcite depends only on the most frequent fraction ,",
    "rarer fractions being ignored altogether .",
    "the exponential of the shannon index  @xcite , corresponding to @xmath35 , quantifies the entropy ( or uncertainty ) in predicting the fraction identity of a gene chosen at random from a location @xmath3 at time @xmath2 .",
    "the inverse of the simpson index  @xcite , corresponding to @xmath36 , describes the probability that two individuals sampled randomly at location @xmath3 and time @xmath2 belong to the same fraction . for any @xmath30 ,",
    "a high index of diversity of order @xmath30 indicates high diversity or a true evenness in the population : @xmath37 is maximal when all the fraction frequencies are equal , i.e. , when @xmath38 .",
    "we consider a one - dimensional environment @xmath39 composed of one climate envelope , surrounded by unfavourable habitat .",
    "due to climate change , the advantageous patch moves with fixed speed @xmath40 to the right . in the favourable habitat , the population can reproduce , while in the unfavourable regions there is no reproduction and the population dies at a rate @xmath41 .",
    "we focus on two scenarios .",
    "[ [ scenario1-range - expansion - under - climate - change . ] ] scenario  1 : range expansion under climate change .",

    "we are only interested in the colonisation part and we neglect the possible retraction at the rear edge of the range .",
    "thus the climate envelope size is infinite ( @xmath42 ) and the growth function is defined by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the intrinsic growth rate of the population . in the favourable region , we only take into account negative density dependence where @xmath45 describes the carrying capacity of the climate envelope .",
    "thus the per capita growth rate @xmath46 is a decreasing function of @xmath11 at location @xmath3 inside the climate envelope .",

    "we see that the profile @xmath14 of the travelling wave solves the elliptic equation @xmath52 these travelling waves propagate in the direction of the climate change ( from left to right ) . in the range expansion scenario , they take the form of a decreasing wave describing the invasion into an environment where the species is not yet present with a constant speed @xmath9 and a constant density profile @xmath53 in the range shift scenario they move with a shifting climate envelope and so the profile @xmath14 is bell  shaped because there is expansion at the leading edge of the climate envelope and contraction at the rear edge ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : environment ] ) .",
    "one can note that increasing contraction constraint tends to flatten the trailing edge slope of the profile ( see fig .",

    ", the density @xmath11 converges to the travelling wave solution of  .     as a function of the size of the climate envelope @xmath54 and the potential spreading speed @xmath64 .",
    "only a population in a wide climate envelope or with a high potential spreading speed can survive climate change.,width=487 ]",
    "henceforth , we assume that the entire population @xmath11 satisfies @xmath51 with @xmath14 solving  .",
    "thus , the population has already attained its asymptotic travelling wave profile .",
    "we consider the population @xmath11 to be composed of @xmath18 neutral fractions , the @xmath23th fraction having density @xmath10 satisfying  , and study the dynamics of each neutral fraction density @xmath19 and of the associated diversity measures @xmath27 .      for both scenarios ,",
    "we consider an arbitrary fraction density @xmath10 satisfying   and , for simplicity , refer to it as @xmath65 henceforth .",
    "the density of this fraction therefore satisfies @xmath66 moreover , at time @xmath16 , the entire population satisfies @xmath67 and the fraction @xmath68 corresponds to a portion of the quantity @xmath69 .",
    "thus , @xmath70 for all @xmath25 . from a biological perspective",
    ", this means that we consider the spatio - temporal dynamics of the neutral genetic diversity in an ongoing range shift or range expansion due to climate change .    using properties of the population dispersal ability @xmath12 , the speed @xmath9 of the climate envelope , and the characteristics of the profile @xmath14 , we are able to describe the dynamics of the fraction density @xmath65 in the whole wave of propagation .",
    "[ theo : pushed ] for any initial condition @xmath71 , the density @xmath65 of the fraction converges uniformly in space ( as @xmath72 ) to a proportion @xmath73 of the total population @xmath74 , that is , @xmath75 uniformly on compact sets as @xmath72 .",
    "the proportion @xmath73 can be computed explicitly as follows : @xmath76    result  [ theo : pushed ] , proved in section  [ sec : proof ] , describes the large time dynamics of the fractions inside the travelling wave generated by a reaction  diffusion model with an environment that changes with time and space .",
    "more precisely , it shows that in each scenario , any fraction initially represented in the population @xmath11",
    "( i.e. , having initial density @xmath77 ) can follow the population and the climate envelope .",
    "the formula   has practical significance because it provides a precise information regarding the contribution of the ancestral population and the origin of the individuals that compose the wave at large time .",
    "indeed , we have shown that , in the moving frame having speed @xmath9 , the profile @xmath78 of any fraction tends to resemble the profile @xmath14 of the entire population with a scaling factor @xmath73 that depends only on the initial density @xmath71 .",
    "this factor @xmath73 represents the contribution of the fraction @xmath65 at large time which is by definition the reproductive value of this fraction  @xcite .",
    "our result  [ theo : pushed ] also shows that any fraction is represented at the leading edge and contribute to push the wave forward .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite have shown that this inside dynamics characterised the pushed wave , a notion introduced by  @xcite .",
    "the travelling wave solution of the heterogeneous reaction  diffusion model   is thus _ pushed _ in this sense . from a mathematical perspective , this result generalises the notion of pulled / pushed waves to a broader class of equations .",
    "in addition , it shows how the presence of spatial heterogeneity not only modifies the spreading speed of travelling wave solution of reaction  diffusion model but changes the dynamics within the wave itself .",
    "the pushed nature of this travelling wave sharply contrasts with the pulled behaviour exhibited by inside dynamics of travelling wave in a favourable homogeneous environment .",
    "for example , if we extend the good habitat to the entire environment , the growth function @xmath5 is then defined by @xmath79 for all @xmath80 . in this case , travelling wave solutions of the homogeneous equation @xmath81 are _ pulled _ in the sense that only the fraction initially well represented at the leading edge of the travelling wave are present in the wave of expansion as @xmath82  @xcite . from an ecological and genetic perspective , this points out a major difference between expansion under climate change and expansion without climate constraint .",
    "thus , we can expect that the genetic diversity patterns induced by an expansion caused by climate change will be very different than patterns induced by biological invasion without any climate constraint .",
    "we see that genetic diversity can be preserved in a range expansion in response to climate change  ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is instructive to consider a fraction starting with an initial position @xmath83 on the wave , @xmath84 , for some @xmath85 and @xmath86 the dirac mass at location @xmath87 the reproductive value of this fraction , @xmath88 , which describes the relative contribution to the wave of the individuals with an initial position @xmath83 on the wave , can be computed by the formula @xmath89 in the context of an expanding population facing an allee effect , a similar formula , replacing @xmath14 with the solution of stochastic model , has provided a good fit for the probability of gene surfing in these models  @xcite .",
    "the presence of an allee effect is known to enhance genetic diversity along colonisation waves  @xcite .",
    "our results reveals an influence of the climate envelope that is analogous to that of an allee effect on the genetic diversity inside a colonisation wave .",
    "this analogy will be discussed in section  [ sec : discusion ] .     in our model , the travelling profile",
    "@xmath14 only depends on the carrying capacity @xmath45 by a scaling factor @xmath90 thus we can deduce from formula   that the carrying capacity has no influence on the relative contribution of the fractions .",
    "this result sheds a new light on the limited influence of carrying capacity on gene fractions .",
    "indeed , by way of contrast  @xcite have shown that decreased carrying capacity reduces genetic diversity along the colonisation front because it decreases the population density clines at the leading edge of the travelling waves .",
    "the formula   enhances the idea that the relative contributions of the fractions and thus the genetic diversity of the travelling wave depend only on the population density clines at climate envelope frontier , that is the steepness of the travelling wave profile @xmath53    from an ecological perspective , our result shows that genetic richness , corresponding to the number of genetic fractions with positive density at location @xmath3 and time @xmath2 , can be preserved during climate change .",
    "for instance , if the population @xmath11 is composed of @xmath18 fractions whose densities @xmath10 satisfy   and @xmath91 for all @xmath25 , result  [ theo : pushed ] and the maximum principle imply that the densities @xmath10 remain positive everywhere for all time @xmath26 . therefore , the genetic richness remains uniformly equal to @xmath18 , the number of fractions initially present inside the population .",
    "however , the evenness of the gene population is modified by climate change , since over time the densities @xmath10 approach an asymptotic value of @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is defined by  .",
    "moreover , the proportions @xmath94 depend crucially on the speed @xmath9 of the climate shift and the profile @xmath14 of the travelling wave .",
    "therefore , both climate change and the response of the entire population affect evenness of the genetic diversity .",
    "we initially focus on the expansion phenomena which corresponds to scenario  1 and we compare the effects of range expansion on genetic diversity with and without climatic change .",
    "we consider a biological invasion spreading into a homogeneous environment without climate change as a baseline case . here , the population density is represented by the model   and it spreads at its potential spreading speed , @xmath95 .",
    "secondly , we focus on range expansion under climate change ( scenario  1 ) where the rate of habitat expansion is @xmath96 so as to be able to compare outcomes , we assume the population s diffusivity @xmath12 and growth rate @xmath55 in the climate envelope to be fixed the same as the invasion case .",
    "our investigation employs numerical computations , as described in the next section .",
    "this allow us to explore whether the analytical result  [ theo : pushed ] continues to hold even when the initial condition @xmath97 does not correspond to an already established travelling wave .",

    "each fraction density @xmath10 corresponds to a different colour .",
    "for each fraction , the diffusivity is equal to @xmath111 and the per capita growth rate is equal to @xmath112 , so the potential spreading speed is @xmath113 . in any case",
    ", we observed that the solution @xmath74 rapidly converges to a travelling wave profile ( dashed curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : vi_1d ] ) .      fig .",
    "[ fig : vi_1d_ue ] shows the evolution of the spatial structure of the solution @xmath74 to   without climate change .",
    "as described in  @xcite , only the fraction at the leading edge of the front follows the population expansion to the right .",
    "this indicates that range expansion leads to a strong erosion of diversity , caused by the demographic advantage of isolated individuals ahead of the colonisation front .",
    "in addition , we observe that genetic diversity has a vertical spatial pattern that indicates that the population is highly structured .      in the presence of range expansion under climate change ( scenario  1 ) ,",
    "the situation is very different .",
    "we observe from fig .",
    "[ fig : vi_1d](c),(d ) that range boundary induced by climate change promotes diversity within at the leading edge of the travelling wave of colonisation .",
    "even if the rightmost fraction remains well represented , any fraction initially presented inside the bulk of the population is conserved at the leading edge of the colonisation wave .",
    "however , the faster the climate change is , the less fractions situated deep in the core of the population contribute to the wave .",
    "this indicates that fast range expansion due to fast climate change or biological invasion leads to a more uneven distribution of the fractions than slow range expansion in response to slow climate change .",
    "our previous results have shown that an increase in the climate velocity tends to reduce genetic diversity .",
    "we now investigate the range shift scenario  2 , which combines colonisation of newly available habitat and extirpation at newly unsuitable habitat .",
    "we show that the intensity of erosion induced by fast climate change depends crucially on the ratio between the size of the climate envelope and the potential spreading speed of the species .",
    "since these factors play an important role in the survival of the population ( see fig .  [",

    "fig : survival_lstar ] ) .",
    "the growth rate in the climate envelope was set to @xmath123 .",
    "then , using the asymptotic abundances @xmath124 defined in   result  1 , we computed the asymptotic diversity measures , @xmath125 associated to the travelling wave @xmath14 and its particular initial fraction decomposition @xmath126 it is defined by @xmath127    we first notice from fig .",

    "diversity reduces as climate velocity increases.,title=\"fig:\",width=491 ] +    when the potential spreading speed is low and the size of the climate envelope is large , only the fractions from the leading edge invade the travelling wave ( note that orange and green fractions mainly invade in fig .",

    "gene surfing may occur .",

    "fig : vi_1d ] ) , genetic diversity is better conserved at the leading edge of the colonisation wave and all the fractions in the bulk of the population significantly contribute to the wave ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : divq ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : vi_1d_rs](b ) ) .",
    "however , a population with a very high potential spreading speed @xmath61 can face strong erosion in a small climate envelope ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : divq ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : vi_1d_rs](c ) ) . in this case",
    ", the population range is much wider than the climate envelope .",
    "thus the fractions outside the climate envelope have more weight than the fraction in the bulk of the population .",
    "since climate change promotes gene mixing as mentioned above , the fractions at the leading edge and the trailing edge will thus mainly contribute to the wave , which tends to give an uneven distribution of fractions and decreases the genetic diversity measure ( note that green and brown fractions invade in fig .",
    "[ fig : vi_1d_rs](c ) ) .",
    "fraction densities @xmath10 inside a population @xmath132 described by   with  , which follows a climate envelope of finite size @xmath54 , shifting at a slow velocity @xmath133 we compare the genetic structure of three scenarios from fig .",
    "[ fig : divq](b ) : ( a ) low spreading speed @xmath134 and large envelope @xmath135 ( b ) high spreading speed @xmath136 and large envelope @xmath137 and ( c ) high spreading speed @xmath134 and small envelope @xmath138 starting with the initial spatial structure ( d ) .",
    "the dashed black curves represent the corresponding travelling wave @xmath53 , width=525 ]",
    "using a deterministic mathematical model , recognised as a robust descriptor of colonisation waves  @xcite as well as a good predictor of allele dynamics inside a population  @xcite , we first showed that range expansion under climate change ( scenario  1 ) modifies the genetic diversity of the colonisation front . under climate change , all the fractions of the population are preserved in the colonisation wave , even though the distribution of the proportions may change . in the absence of climate change ,",
    "only the fractions initially ahead of the population , eventually remain in the colonisation front , indicating a strong erosion of diversity due to demographic advantage of isolated populations at the leading edge of the colonisation front  @xcite .",
    "we also showed that the neutral genetic dynamics of a population shifting its range due to climate change ( scenario  2 ) depends crucially on the climate velocity , the size of the climate envelope as well as on its dispersal or spreading ability .",
    "while an increase in the climate velocity tends to reduce diversity , the intensity of erosion depends crucially on the ratio between the size of the climate envelope and the potential spreading speed of the species . using diversity indices",
    ", we showed that a species whose potential spreading speed is greater than the climate velocity , but not too much greater , can avoid both extinction and erosion of diversity amid climate change .",
    "our result modifies and extends the commonly held perspective that expansion processes generally erode the neutral genetic diversity along the colonisation front .",
    "it reveals that two typical examples of range expansion , biological invasions by alien organisms and the movement of species in response to climate change , should induce different effects on genetic diversity of the population . in the context of biological invasions ,",
    "the alien organism spreads into a newly suitable habitat without any environmental or climate constraints , so it expands its range in a favourable homogeneous habitat . in this case ,",
    "an erosion of diversity occurs at the leading edge of the colonisation front  ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , we show that a colonisation or recolonisation driven by climate change could promote diversity along the travelling wave of colonisation  ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this result also reveals the important role played by climate envelopes , arising from climate conditions , in the preservation of genetic diversity .",
    "they represent the climate constraints imposed on migration .",
    "ahead of the envelope , the growth rate of individuals is negative , reducing the speed of propagation of the species and allowing a diversity of genes from the centre or the trailing edge of the range to reach the leading edge , as shown in result  [ theo : pushed ] .",
    "this effect of climate envelopes has already been observed in the empirical literature .",
    "for instance ,  @xcite investigated the genetic diversity of a population of european larch whose spread behind a retreating glacier showed a high level of genetic diversity at the leading edge of the range .",
    "the reduction of the growth rate ahead of the climate envelope , where the population density is low , is conceptually similar to the sink produced by an allee effect , which is also known to promote diversity in a travelling wave of colonisation  @xcite . in that sense ,",
    "our results generalise the idea that any mechanism that either provides a population sink ahead of a moving population or constraint the expansion should help the population to maintain its initial genetic diversity .    behind the envelope , the growth rate is also negative , providing a contraction constraint on the species range .",
    "intuitively , increasing contraction constraint enlarges the species range region located behind the climate envelope .",
    "thus , the fractions from the rear edge of the travelling wave are pushed to survive and invade the leading edge of the wave when the contraction constraint is high ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : vi_1d_rs](c ) ) .",
    "the beneficial effect of such a contraction constraint on preservation of initial level of diversity has also been investigated by others  @xcite .",
    "overall , the mixing process induced by the climate envelope is a defining characteristic of _ pushed _ travelling waves  @xcite . in that sense ,",
    "our results extend the idea that any process that create pushed travelling waves should allow the population to spatially promote its initial genetic diversity .",
    "genetic drift is not explicitly modelled in our forward approach , and this is an important difference between this study and  @xcite . in their study",
    ", the critical role of random genetic drift eventually leads to the fixation of a single allele in the travelling wave , causing a total loss of genetic diversity .",
    "however , consistent results are obtained from their backward stochastic approach .",
    "moreover , recent study  @xcite has shown that the coalescent stochastic model used in  @xcite is well represented by our deterministic model in which random genetic drift disappears because it has been averaged when the local population size is large enough .",
    "dispersal ability is fundamental in determining genetic diversity responses to climate change .",
    "however , recent evidence has shown that climate change can also impact species dispersal during range shifts , either directly or indirectly  @xcite .",
    "theoretical evolutionary studies predict increased dispersal at expanding range margins , matching observations made for various species  @xcite .",
    "however , few mathematical studies have investigated the evolution of species dispersal and its impact on the spatial structure of a species range when expansions occur across environmental gradients  @xcite .",
    "our analysis suggests that increased dispersal ability during range shifts or range expansion due to changing climate envelopes increases potential spreading speed of the species and may enhance genetic diversity . as already pointed out by pioneering works of  @xcite and  @xcite",
    ", we will need to integrate ecology and evolution in order to understand the complex , intertwined effects of dispersal and climate change on genetic diversity .",
    "our study provides tools that project genetic diversity measure from the climate velocity , the potential spreading speed of the species , and the size of the climate envelope data .",
    "the last ipcc report  @xcite predicts a climate velocity of @xmath139 on average under the worst climate change scenario ( rcp 8.5 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the mean potential spreading speed of several terrestrial and freshwater species range from @xmath140 , for some trees and herbaceous plants to @xmath141 for artiodactyls .",
    "moreover , their average range size varies widely from @xmath142 for fish and vascular plants to @xmath143 for birds and mammals  @xcite , although there is a high degree of variation around these means .",
    "we can thus see from our results in fig .",
    "[ fig : divq ] which species may be in danger of extinction and loss of genetic diversity .    from a mathematical standpoint",
    ", our study contributes a new insight on the extensively studied topic of travelling wave solutions of reaction  diffusion equations in heterogeneous environments .",
    "following the recent approach developed by  @xcite to characterise the pulled ",
    "pushed nature of travelling wave , we focus on the dynamics of the inside structure of travelling waves , conversely to classical approaches analysing the dynamics of the total waves .",
    "our result generalises techniques developed in  @xcite to a large class of equations and shows that travelling wave solutions of reaction ",
    "diffusion with a spatial heterogeneous environment developing in time are pushed in the sense of  @xcite .",
    "these flexible and intuitive mathematical techniques could be used to more complex models that do not necessarily admit travelling wave solutions .",
    "for instance , in a two - dimensional environment , species expanding their range in response to climate change can face absolute boundaries to dispersal because of external environmental factors .",
    "consequently , not only the position but also the shape and size of the climate envelope can change with time . in this case , travelling wave solutions may not exists but the mathematical techniques can still apply .",
    "first of all , using the substitution @xmath144 , we can assume that the diffusion coefficient @xmath12 is equal to @xmath145 .",
    "now , in the moving frame having speed @xmath9 , the fraction density @xmath65 can be written @xmath146 and the time dependence of the reaction term vanishes .",
    "we can use the liouville transform @xmath147 to remove the advection terms .",
    "thus , the function @xmath148 satisfies the linear equation @xmath149 ( in which advection and time dependence are absent ) with the initial condition @xmath150 .",
    "we show that @xmath148 can be decomposed as the sum of a stationary function and a function that converges to @xmath151 exponentially as @xmath72 .",
    "note that @xmath152 is a positive eigenfunction of the operator that appears in the right - hand side of   and that the associated eigenvalue is @xmath151 . on the one hand ,",
    "if @xmath5 satisfies   then since @xmath14 satisfies  , one can check that @xmath153 as @xmath154 , where @xmath155 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath5 satisfies   we have @xmath156 as @xmath157 and @xmath158 as @xmath159 in both cases , sturm  liouville theory implies that @xmath151 is the largest eigenvalue of this operator , the remainder of the spectrum being located to the left of some negative constant @xmath160 .",
    "thus , we can write @xmath161 where @xmath162 and @xmath163 is orthogonal to @xmath164 in the sense that @xmath165 for each @xmath166 . and @xmath167 for some constant @xmath168",
    ". setting @xmath169 in the expression in  , multiplying by @xmath164 , and then integrating , we get the expression in   for @xmath170 .",
    "finally , we have @xmath171 , so @xmath172 for all @xmath25 .",
    "it follows that @xmath173 uniformly on compacts as @xmath82 and even uniformly in any interval of the type @xmath174 with @xmath175 in addition , if @xmath5 verifies  , we get @xmath176 for some constant @xmath177 .",
    "thus , @xmath178 , so @xmath179 for all @xmath25 . since @xmath180 , this shows that the fraction density @xmath65 converges to the proportion @xmath170 of the total population @xmath181 uniformly in @xmath182 as @xmath72 .",
