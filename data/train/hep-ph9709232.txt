    "inflationary cosmology has come of age . from its beginnings as a solution to purely theoretical problems such as the horizon , flatness and monopole problems@xcite , it has grown into the main contender for the source of primordial fluctuations giving rise to large scale structure@xcite .",
    "there is evidence from the measurements of temperature anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) that the scale invariant power spectrum predicted by generic inflationary models is at least consistent with observations@xcite and we can expect further and more exacting tests of the inflationary power spectrum when the map and planck missions are flown . in particular , if the fluctuations that are responsible for the temperature anisotropies of the cmb truly originate from quantum fluctuations during inflation , determinations of the spectrum of scalar and tensor perturbations will constrain inflationary models based on particle physics scenarios and probably will validate or rule out specific proposals@xcite .",
    "already current bounds on the spectrum of scalar density perturbations seem to rule out some versions of ` extended ' inflation@xcite .",
    "the tasks for inflationary universe enthusiasts are then two - fold .",
    "first , models of inflation must be constructed that have a well - defined rationale in terms of coming from a reasonable particle physics model .",
    "this is in contrast to the current situation where most , if not all acceptable inflationary models are ad - hoc in nature , with fields and potentials put in for the sole purpose of generating an inflationary epoch .",
    "second , and equally important , we must be sure that the quantum dynamics of inflation is well understood .",
    "this is extremely important , especially in light of the fact that it is _ exactly _ this quantum behavior that is supposed to give rise to the primordial metric perturbations which presumably have imprinted themselves in the cmbr .",
    "this latter problem is the focus of this paper .",
    "the inflaton must be treated as a _ non - equilibrium _ quantum field . the simplest way to see this comes from the requirement of having small enough metric perturbation amplitudes which in turn requires that the quartic self coupling @xmath2 of the inflaton be extremely small , typically of order @xmath3 .",
    "such a small coupling can not establish local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) for _ all _ field modes ; near a phase transition the long wavelength modes will respond too slowly to be able to enter lte .",
    "in fact , the superhorizon sized modes will be out of the region of causal contact and can not thermalize .",
    "we see then that if we want to gain a deeper understanding of inflation , non - equilibrium tools must be developed .",
    "such tools exist and have now been developed to the point that they can give quantitative answers to these questions in cosmology@xcite .",
    "these methods permit us to follow the * dynamics * of quantum fields in situations where the energy density is non - perturbatively large ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "that is , they allow the computation of the time evolution of non - stationary states and of non - thermal density matrices .    our approach is to apply non - equilibrium quantum field theory techniques to the situation of a scalar field coupled to _",
    "gravity , where the source of the gravitational field is the expectation value of the stress energy tensor in the relevant , dynamically changing , quantum state . in this way we can go beyond the standard analyses@xcite which treat the background as fixed .",
    "we will mainly deal with ` new inflation ' scenarios , where a scalar field @xmath5 evolves under the action of a typical symmetry breaking potential .",
    "the initial conditions will be taken so that the initial value of the order parameter ( the field expectation value ) is near the top of the potential ( the disordered state ) with essentially zero time derivative .",
    "what we find is that the existence of spinodal instabilities , i.e. the fact that eventually ( in an expanding universe ) all modes will act as if they have a _ negative _ mass squared , drives the quantum fluctuations to grow _ non - perturbatively _ large .",
    "we have the picture of an initial wave - function or density matrix peaked near the unstable state and then spreading until it samples the stable vacua . since these vacua are non - perturbatively far from the initial state ( typically @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the mass scale of the field and @xmath8 the quartic self - coupling ) , the spinodal instabilities will persist until the quantum fluctuations , as encoded in the equal time two - point function @xmath9 , grow to @xmath10 ) .",
    "this growth eventually shuts off the inflationary behavior of the scale factor as well as the growth of the quantum fluctuations ( this last also happens in minkowski spacetime @xcite ) .",
    "the scenario envisaged here is that of a quenched or supercooled phase transition where the order parameter is zero or very small .",
    "therefore one is led to ask :    \\a ) what is rolling down ? .",
    "\\b ) since the quantum fluctuations are non - perturbatively large ( @xmath11 ) , will not they modify drastically the frw dynamics ? .",
    "\\c ) how can one extract ( small ? ) metric perturbations from non - perturbatively large field fluctuations ?",
    "we address the questions a)-c ) as well as other issues below .",
    "our program consists of finding ways to incorporate the non - equilibrium behavior of the quantum fields involved in inflation into a framework that treats gravity self consistently , at least in some approximation .",
    "we do this via the use of semiclassical gravity@xcite where we say that the metric is classical , at least to first approximation , whose source is the expectation value of the stress energy tensor @xmath12 where this expectation value is taken in the dynamically determined state described by the density matrix @xmath13 .",
    "this dynamical problem can be described schematically as follows :    1 .",
    "the dynamics of the scale factor @xmath14 is driven by the semiclassical einstein equations + @xmath15 + here @xmath16 are the renormalized values of newton s constant and the cosmological constant , respectively and @xmath17 is the einstein tensor .",
    "the higher curvature terms must be included to absorb divergences .",
    "2 .   on the other hand",
    ", the density matrix @xmath13 that determines @xmath18 obeys the liouville equation + @xmath19,\\ ] ] + where @xmath20 is the evolution hamiltonian , which is dependent on the scale factor , @xmath14 .",
    "it is this set of equations we must try to solve ; it is clear that initial conditions must be appended to these equations for us to be able to arrive at unique solutions to them .",
    "let us discuss some aspects of the initial state of the field theory first .",
    "as we mentioned above , the situation we consider is one in which the theory admits a symmetry breaking potential and in which the field expectation value starts its evolution near the unstable point .",
    "there is an issue as to how the field got to have an expectation value near the unstable point ( typically at @xmath21 ) as well as an issue concerning the initial state of the non - zero momentum modes .",
    "the issue of initial conditions is present in any formulation of inflation but chaotic .    since our background is an frw spacetime , it is spatially homogeneous and we can choose our state @xmath13 to respect this symmetry . starting from the full quantum field @xmath22",
    "we can extract a part that has a natural interpretation as the zero momentum , c - number part of the field by writing :    @xmath23\\equiv \\langle \\phi(\\vec{x } , t ) ) \\rangle.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the quantity @xmath24 represents the quantum fluctuations about the zero mode @xmath25 and clearly satisfies @xmath26 .",
    "we need to choose a basis to represent the density matrix .",
    "a natural choice consistent with the translational invariance of our quantum state is that given by the fourier modes , in _ comoving _ momentum space , of the quantum fluctuations @xmath24 :    @xmath27    in this language we can state our ansatz for the initial condition of the quantum state as follows .",
    "we take the zero mode @xmath28 , where @xmath29 will typically be very near the origin , while the initial conditions on the the nonzero modes @xmath30 will be chosen such that the initial density matrix @xmath31 describes a vacuum state ( i.e. an initial state in local thermal equilibrium at a temperature @xmath32 ) .",
    "there are some subtleties involved in this choice .",
    "first , as explained in @xcite , in order for the density matrix to commute with the initial hamiltonian , we must choose the modes to be initially in the conformal adiabatic vacuum ( these statements will be made more precise below ) .",
    "this choice has the added benefit of allowing for time independent renormalization counterterms to be used in renormalizing the theory .",
    "we are making the assumption of an initial vacuum state in order to be able to proceed with the calculation",
    ". it would be interesting to understand what forms of the density matrix can be used for other , perhaps more reasonable , initial conditions .",
    "the assumptions of an initial equilibrium vacuum state are essentially the same used by linde@xcite , vilenkin@xcite , as well as by guth and pi@xcite in their analyses of the quantum mechanics of inflation in a fixed de sitter background .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , if we start from such an initial state , spinodal instabilities will drive the growth of non - perturbatively large quantum fluctuations . in order to deal with these ,",
    "we need to be able to perform calculations that take these large fluctuations into account .",
    "although the quantitative features of the dynamics will depend on the initial state , the qualitative features associated with spinodal instabilities will be fairly robust for a wide choice of initial states that describes a phase transition with a spinodal region in field space .",
    "having recognized the non - perturbative dynamics of the long wavelength fluctuations , we need to study the dynamics within a non - perturbative framework .",
    "that is , a framework allowing calculations for non - perturbatively large energy densities .",
    "we require that such a framework be : i ) renormalizable , ii ) covariant energy conserving , iii ) numerically implementable .",
    "there are very few schemes that fulfill all of these criteria : the hartree and the large @xmath1 approximation@xcite .",
    "whereas the hartree approximation is basically a gaussian variational approximation@xcite that in general can not be consistently improved upon , the large @xmath1 approximation can be consistently implemented beyond leading order@xcite and in our case it has the added bonus of providing many light fields ( associated with goldstone modes ) that will permit the study of the effects of other fields which are lighter than the inflaton on the dynamics .",
    "thus we will study the inflationary dynamics of a quenched phase transition within the framework of the large @xmath1 limit of a scalar theory in the vector representation of @xmath33 .",
    "we assume that the universe is spatially flat with a metric given by @xmath34 the matter action and lagrangian density are given by @xmath35 \\label{action}\\ ] ] @xmath36 @xmath37 where we have included the coupling of @xmath38 to the scalar curvature @xmath39 since it will arise as a consequence of renormalization@xcite .",
    "the gravitational sector includes the usual einstein term in addition to a higher order curvature term and a cosmological constant term which are necessary to renormalize the theory .",
    "the action for the gravitational sector is therefore : @xmath40.\\ ] ] with k being the cosmological constant ( we use @xmath41 rather than the conventional @xmath42 to distinguish the cosmological constant from the ultraviolet cutoff @xmath43 we introduce to regularize the theory ; see section iv ) . in principle",

    "the variation of the action @xmath47 with respect to the metric @xmath48 gives us einstein s equation @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the einstein tensor given by the variation of @xmath51 , @xmath52 is the higher order curvature term given by the variation of @xmath53 , and @xmath54 is the contribution from the matter lagrangian . with the metric ( [ frw ] )",
    ", the various components of the curvature tensors in terms of the scale factor are : @xmath55 eventually , when we have fully renormalized the theory , we will set @xmath56 and keep as our only contribution to @xmath57 a piece related to the matter fields which we shall incorporate into @xmath54 .      to obtain the proper large @xmath58 limit ,",
    "the vector field is written as @xmath59 with @xmath60 an @xmath61-plet , and we write @xmath62 to implement the large @xmath58 limit in a consistent manner , one may introduce an auxiliary field as in@xcite .",
    "however , the leading order contribution can be obtained equivalently by invoking the factorization@xcite :    @xmath63    to obtain a large @xmath58 limit , we define@xcite @xmath64 where the large @xmath58 limit is implemented by the requirement that @xmath65 the leading contribution is obtained by neglecting the @xmath66 terms in the formal limit .",
    "the resulting lagrangian density is quadratic , with linear terms in @xmath67 and @xmath60 .",
    "the equations of motion are obtained by imposing the tadpole conditions @xmath68 and @xmath69 which in this case are tantamount to requiring that the linear terms in @xmath67 and @xmath60 in the lagrangian density vanish .",

    "it proves illuminating to pass to conformal time variables in terms of the conformally rescaled fields ( see @xcite and section ix for a discussion ) in which the mode functions obey an equation which is very similar to that of harmonic oscillators with time dependent frequencies in minkowski space - time .",
    "it has been realized that different initial conditions on the mode functions lead to different renormalization counterterms@xcite ; in particular imposing initial conditions in comoving time leads to counterterms that depend on these initial conditions .",

    "we will make our subtractions using an ultraviolet cutoff , @xmath95 , constant in _ physical coordinates_. this guarantees that the counterterms will be time independent .",
    "the renormalization then proceeds much in the same manner as in reference@xcite ; the quadratic divergences renormalize the mass and the logarithmic terms renormalize the quartic coupling and the coupling to the ricci scalar .",
    "in addition , there is a quartic divergence which renormalizes the cosmological constant while the leading renormalizations of newton s constant and the higher order curvature coupling are quadratic and logarithmic respectively .",

    "the logarithmic subtractions can be neglected because of the coupling @xmath100 . using the planck scale as the cutoff and the inflaton mass @xmath101 as a renormalization point , these terms are of order @xmath102 \\leq 10^{-10}$ ] , for @xmath103 .",
    "an equivalent statement is that for these values of the coupling and inflaton masses , the landau pole is well beyond the physical cutoff @xmath104 .",
    "our relative error in the numerical analysis is of order @xmath105 , therefore our numerical study is insensitive to the logarithmic corrections . though these corrections are fundamentally important , numerically they can be neglected .",

    "this remarkable feature of zero mode assembly of long - wavelength , spinodally unstable modes is a consequence of the presence of the horizon .",
    "it also explains why , despite the fact that asymptotically the fluctuations sample the broken symmetry state , the equation of state is that of matter . since the excitations in the broken symmetry state are massless goldstone bosons one would expect radiation domination .",
    "however , the assembly phenomenon , i.e. the redshifting of the wave vectors , makes these modes behave exactly like zero momentum modes that give an equation of state of matter ( upon averaging over the small oscillations around the minimum ) .",
    "subhorizon modes at the end of inflation with @xmath245 do not participate in the zero mode assembly .",
    "the behavior of such modes do depend on @xmath191 after the end of inflation .",
    "notice that these modes have extremely large comoving @xmath191 since @xmath246 .",
    "as discussed in ref.@xcite such modes decrease with time after inflation as @xmath247 .",
    "having recognized the effective classical variable that can be interpreted as the component of the field that drives the frw background and rolls down the classical potential hill , we want to recognize unambiguously the small fluctuations .",
    "we have argued above that after horizon crossing , all of the mode functions evolve proportionally to the zero mode , and the question arises : which modes are assembled into the effective zero mode whose dynamics drives the evolution of the frw scale factor and which modes are treated as perturbations ? in principle every @xmath248 mode provides some spatial inhomogeneity , and assembling these into an effective homogeneous zero mode seems in principle to do away with the very inhomogeneities that one wants to study .",
    "however , scales of cosmological importance today first crossed the horizon during the last 60 or so e - folds of inflation .",
    "recently grishchuk@xcite has argued that the sensitivity of the measurements of @xmath249 probe inhomogeneities on scales @xmath250 times the size of the present horizon .",
    "therefore scales that are larger than these and that have first crossed the horizon much earlier than the last 60 e - folds of inflation are unobservable today and can be treated as an effective homogeneous component , whereas the scales that can be probed experimentally via the cmb inhomogeneities today must be treated separately as part of the inhomogeneous perturbations of the cmb .",
    "thus a consistent description of the dynamics in terms of an effective zero mode plus ` small ' quantum fluctuations can be given provided the following requirements are met : a ) the total number of e - folds @xmath251 , b ) all the modes that have crossed the horizon _ before _",
    "the last 60 - 65 e - folds are assembled into an effective _ classical _ zero mode via @xmath252^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ ] , c ) the modes that cross the horizon during the last 6065 e - folds are accounted as ` small ' perturbations .",
    "the reason for the requirement a ) is that in the separation @xmath253 one requires that @xmath254 . as argued above , after the modes cross the horizon , the ratio of amplitudes of the mode functions remains constant and given by @xmath255 with @xmath256 being the number of e - folds between the crossing of the smaller @xmath257 and the crossing of the larger @xmath257 .",
    "then for @xmath258 to be much smaller than the effective zero mode , it must be that the fourier components of @xmath259 correspond to very large @xmath82 s at the beginning of inflation , so that the effective zero mode can grow for a long time before the components of @xmath259 begin to grow under the spinodal instabilities .",

    "analytical and numerical estimates have been provided that establish the regime of validity of the classical approach .",
    "we find that these superhorizon modes re - assemble into an effective zero mode and unambiguously identify the composite field that can be used as an effective expectation value of the inflaton field whose _ classical _ dynamics drives the evolution of the scale factor .",
    "this identification also provides the initial condition for this effective zero mode .",
    "a consistent criterion is provided to extract `` small '' fluctuations that will contribute to cosmological perturbations from `` large '' non - perturbative spinodal fluctuations .",
    "this is an important ingredient for a consistent calculation and interpretation of cosmological perturbations .",
    "this criterion requires that the model must provide many more than 60 e - folds to identify the ` small perturbations ' that give rise to scalar metric ( curvature ) perturbations .",
    "we then use this criterion combined with the gauge invariant approach to obtain the dynamics of the bardeen variable and the spectrum for scalar perturbations .",
    "we find that during the inflationary epoch , superhorizon modes of the bardeen potential grow exponentially in time reflecting the spinodal instabilities .",
    "these long - wavelength instabilities are manifest in the spectrum of scalar density perturbations and result in an index that is less than one , i.e. a `` red '' power spectrum , providing more power at long wavelength .",
    "we argue that this ` red ' spectrum is a robust feature of potentials that lead to spinodal instabilities in the region in field space associated with inflation and can be interpreted as an `` imprint '' of the phase transition on the cosmological background .",
    "tensor perturbations on the other hand , are not modified by these features , they have much smaller amplitude and a harrison - zeldovich spectrum .",
    "we made contact with the reconstruction program and validated the results for these type of models based on the slow - roll assumption , despite the fact that our study does not involve such an approximation and is non - perturbative .",
    "finally we have studied the quantum to classical crossover and decoherence of quantum fluctuations by studying the full evolution of the density matrix , thus making contact with the concept of `` decoherence without decoherence''@xcite which is generalized to the interacting case . in the case under consideration decoherence and classicalization",
