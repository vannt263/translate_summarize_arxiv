    "one of the important discoveries made with the rossi x  ray timing explorer ( rxte ) satellite is that of the kilohertz quasi  periodic oscillations ( qpos ) in the power spectra of @xmath220 accreting neutron star low  mass x  ray binaries ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "kilohertz qpos are caused by the motion of matter in regions of spacetime within a few kilometres of the surface of accreting neutron stars , where strong  field gravity is required to describe such motion .",
    "they potentially allow one to detect strong  field effects and to constrain the neutron star mass  radius relation .",
    "although there is as yet no agreement about the precise physical mechanism underlying kilohertz qpos , most models agree that the frequency of one of the observed kilohertz qpos reflects the frequency of orbital motion at the inner edge of the accretion disc .",
    "the basic phenomenology of kilohertz qpos consists of two kilohertz qpo peaks , which are separated by @xmath6=200360hz and which move in frequency by up to 700hz in general correlation with mass accretion rate indicators ( again see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the highest observed frequency is @xmath21330hz ( @xcite ) , corresponding in the case of a 1.4m@xmath7 neutron star to an orbital radius as tight as 15 km .",
    "some of these sources also show x  ray bursts , in which burst oscillations are seen which last for a few seconds and have frequencies between 270 and 620hz ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "these oscillations usually drift by 1 - 2hz but are near the neutron star spin frequency in each source ( @xcite ) . in the millisecond pulsar sax  j1808.43658 @xmath8",
    "has been found to be equal to half the spin frequency , which disproves spin  orbit beat frequency models ( @xcite ) and suggests instead that the neutron star spin induces resonances in the disk flow , perhaps involving the general relativistic epicyclic frequencies ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "after extensive searches for additional kilohertz qpo peaks at theoretically predicted frequencies which remained unsuccesful ( e.g.  in sco  x1 ; @xcite ) , @xcite discovered sidebands at a frequency 5065 hz above the lower kilohertz qpo in 4u  160852 , 4u  172834 , and 4u  163653 .",
    "magnetospheric modulation of the lower kilohertz qpo , a beat phenomenon taking place inside the marginally stable orbit as well as lense - thirring precession are possible explanations for these sidebands ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the hydrodynamic disk mode model ( @xcite ) naturally produces a sideband at a frequency near that observed plus several other , as yet unobserved peaks ; no other models have so far been able to explicitly accommodate the sideband .",
    "the 5065-hz frequency difference between the lower kilohertz qpo and the sideband frequency , the sideband separation @xmath9 , is different in each source and not identical to any of the other qpo frequencies simultaneously observed in the 10100 hz frequency range ( @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we find evidence for symmetric sidebands to the lower kilohertz qpo in the atoll source 4u  163653 .",
    "we used all the proportional counter array ( pca ) data from rxte observations of 4u  163653 available to us at the beginning of 2004 .",
    "hence , we included the data used by @xcite .",
    "the analysis we performed was the same as that done by @xcite .",
    "below , a condensed description of the analysis steps is given ; more details can be found in @xcite .    using 128  s  long segments of high time resolution pca data ( 122@xmath10s resolution ) , we calculated power spectra up to a nyquist frequency of 4096  hz in an energy band of 260 kev .",
    "the power spectra were searched for lower kilohertz qpos which are narrow ( full  width at half maximum , fwhm , less than @xmath210 hz ) and detected in 128  s at a significance larger than 2@xmath3 .",
    "this resulted in a selection of 244  ksec of data .",
    "the lower kilohertz qpo was traced using a dynamical power spectrum ( e.g.  see plate 1 in @xcite ) to visualise the time evolution of the qpo frequency . for each power spectrum",
    "the lower kilohertz qpo peak was fitted in a range of 200  hz centred on the traced frequency using a function consisting of a constant plus a lorentzian .",
    "this provides us with a lower kilohertz qpo frequency measurement for each 128  s power spectrum .",
    "we used the shift  and  add technique described by @xcite to shift each lower kilohertz qpo to a reference frequency .",
    "next , the shifted , aligned , power spectra were averaged .",
    "the average power spectrum was finally fitted in the range 5122048 hz so as to exclude the edges which are distorted due to the shifting .",
    "the fit function consisted of a constant to fit the noise and three or four lorentzians representing the qpos .",
    "the fitted average power spectrum is displayed in figure  [ sideb ] .",
    "errors on the fit parameters were calculated using @xmath11 ( 1@xmath3 single parameter ) .",
    "we clearly detected the two kilohertz qpos and the sideband to the lower kilohertz qpo .",
    "the sideband was detected at a significance of 6@xmath3 , confirming our previous @xmath12 detection of the sideband in 4u  163653 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the frequency difference between the frequency of the lower kilohertz qpo and that of the sideband , @xmath13  hz . the average kilohertz qpo frequency separation , @xmath14 , is 283@xmath05  hz .",
    "the fwhm of the sideband , the lower kilohertz qpo and the upper kilohertz qpo is 12.7@xmath02.7  hz , 4.86@xmath00.04  hz , and 130@xmath011  hz , respectively . due to the fact that we have combined data with either 3 , 4 , or 5 active proportional counter units ( pcus ) we can not determine the fractional rms amplitude of the qpo peaks from the combined data",
    "therefore , we selected data where only 3 , 4 , or 5 pcus were active , we fitted those data sets separately . in those separate fits we fixed the fwhm and the frequency of the qpos to the values found using the complete data set .",
    "the fractional rms amplitude of the sideband is consistent with what was found before ( see table  [ side ] and @xcite ) .    in order to search for changes in the sideband separation frequency @xmath15 we averaged shifted power spectra based on the unshifted frequency of the lower kilohertz qpo in three frequency bands ; a lower kilohertz qpo frequency between 700800 hz , 800850 hz , and above 850 hz .",
    "interestingly , the average power spectrum in the lower kilohertz qpo frequency interval 800 - 850  hz showed evidence for two sidebands located symmetrically around the lower kilohertz qpo peak ( see figure  [ twosideb ] ) .",
    "the results of fits to these averaged power spectra are given in table  [ side ] .",

    "+    adding more data with respect to the analysis performed by @xcite , we now find a qpo at low frequencies ( @xmath243 hz , see figure  [ lowfreq ] ) . in order to compare the properties of this low  frequency qpo with that of the kilohertz qpos and the kilohertz qpo separation frequencies we fitted the average unshifted power spectrum in the frequency range from 1/16256 hz in the three lower kilohertz qpo frequency intervals as shown in table  [ side ] . in the frequency range",

    "ray binaries 4u  160852 , 4u  172834 , and",
    "4u  163653 we obtained additional data with the rxte satellite of 4u  163653 with the goal to study in detail the properties of this third kilohertz qpo , also known as the sideband to the lower kilohertz qpo .",
    "we selected 4u  163653 since in that source there is evidence for the presence of two sidebands located symmetrically around the lower kilohertz qpo peak frequency .",
    "we confirm the presence of a sideband at a frequency 55.5@xmath18  hz higher than that of the lower kilohertz qpo frequency in 4u  163653 at a 6 @xmath3 significance level .",
    "furthermore , the addition of the extra data allowed us to investigate the sideband(s ) as a function of the lower kilohertz qpo frequency .",
    "we found that when the lower kilohertz qpo has a frequency in the range 800850  hz there is significant evidence ( 3.5@xmath3 , single trial ) for the presence of a sideband at the lower frequency side of the lower kilohertz qpo . selecting lower kilohertz qpo frequencies @xmath4850 hz and when combining all the data , the rms amplitude of the lower sideband is significantly less than that of the upper sideband . for the frequency range 700800 hz",
    "the upper limit is consistent with the rms amplitude of the upper sideband .    in the framework of the sonic  point and spin  resonance model of @xcite ,",
    "the sideband is unlikely to be caused by lense ",
    "thirring precession at the radius where the spin  resonance occurs ( near the orbital radius with a kepler frequency of @xmath19 ) , since for neutron star spin frequencies such as those considered here , the lense  thirring precession frequency at that radius is @xmath202 hz , this is much too low .",
    "it is possible though that the radiation pattern responsible for the upper kilohertz qpo is modulated by the lense  thirring precession at the sonic  point radius , this modulation would then in turn modulate the formation of the lower kilohertz qpo . in such a scenario",
    "the upper kilohertz qpo should also display sidebands .",
    "the fact that these have not yet been detected can be explained by the large fwhm of the upper kilohertz qpo , which precludes the detection of such sidebands .",
    "the skewed shape of the upper kilohertz qpo in the average power spectrum ( see e.g.  fig  [ sideb ] ) can be explained by the fact that the upper kilohertz qpo rms amplitude and @xmath6 change as a function of kilohertz qpo frequency ( e.g.  @xcite , table  [ side ] ) .    .",
    "the full line is the quadratic relation between @xmath9 and the lower kilohertz qpo assuming the lower kilohertz qpo reflects the keplerian frequency and assuming the sideband is formed due to a modulation caused by lense - thirring precession at that radius . _",
    "right panel : _ same as the left panel but for the upper kilohertz qpo.,width=302 ]    if lense ",
    "thirring precession is responsible for the production of the sideband , and if the sideband separation frequency @xmath9 , reflects the lense  thirring precession frequency , @xmath9 would be expected to change as the keplerian frequency squared ( @xmath21 ) . in figure  [ lense ]",
    "we plotted @xmath9 as a function of the lower ( _ left panel _ ) and upper kilohertz qpo ( _ right panel _ ) , respectively .",
    "the sideband separation frequency @xmath9 is consistent with being constant when the lower / upper kilohertz qpo frequency changed by @xmath22/@xmath23  hz , respectively .",
    "the best fitting quadratic relation that would be appropriat assuming the lower / upper kilohertz qpo reflects the keplerian motion at a preferred radius in the disc and @xmath9 the lense  thirring precession frequency at that same radius is also shown .",
    "the normalisation of the quadratic curve is given by @xmath24 ( @xmath25 is the lense  thirring precession frequency , i the moment of inertia of the neutron star , @xmath26 the spin frequency of the star which is @xmath2581  hz in case of 4u  163653 from @xcite , @xmath27 the speed of light , and @xmath28 the mass of the neutron star ) .",
    "the curve in the left panel requires i@xmath29/m to be 3.05@xmath00.07 , that in the right panel 0.17@xmath00.01 , where i@xmath29 and m are in units of 10@xmath30 g @xmath31 and m@xmath7 , respectively ; the expected range of this quantity is between 0.5 and 2 ( @xcite ) .",
    "recently , a model explaining the kilohertz qpos has been proposed that invokes the existence of a non  linear resonance between the vertical and radial epicyclic frequencies in an accretion disc around a neutron star ( @xcite ) .",
    "some versions of this model also include a resonance of these frequencies with the spin frequency of the neutron star ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the resonance model has been introduced as a way to explain the existence of preferred values in the distribution of qpo frequency ratios ( @xcite ; but see @xcite ) as well as the commensurability of the neutron star spin and the kilohertz qpo frequency separation .",
    "so far it has not been explored whether a resonance mechanism could also explain the sidebands to the kilohertz qpos .",
    "for instance , it may be possible that the lense  thirring precession at the radius at which the main resonance between the vertical and radial epicyclic frequencies occurs produces a modulation of the amplitude of the kilohertz qpos . in principle , this modulation should produce equally strong sidebands , and should also produce sidebands on both qpos . alternatively , since for a rotating neutron star the azimuthal ( keplerian ) frequency is larger than the vertical frequency , the sideband could be due to a resonance involving the azimuthal frequency at a radius at which a resonance between the vertical and radial epicyclic frequencies produce the upper and lower kilohertz qpos . for instance , in this scenario a resonance between the azimuthal and radial frequencies would produce a qpo at a frequency slightly higher than that of the upper kilohertz qpo .",
    "the advantage of this mechanism compared to an amplitude modulation is that it could in principle explain the fact that the upper sideband is stronger than the lower sideband .",
    "however , it remains unclear how a qpo at a frequency @xmath32  hz higher than that of the lower kilohertz qpo would appear in this scenario .",
    "previously , 4u",
    "163653 was the only source out of the three sources where a sideband to the lower kilohertz qpo that showed no low  frequency qpo ( @xcite ) .",
    "now , with the additional rxte data , we could identify a low  frequency qpo at a frequency of @xmath243  hz , similar to the one found in 4u  172834 and 4u  160853 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the probable reason why this low  frequency qpo was not observed before is that the source did not sample the states where this qpo is present often .",
    "much of the new data were obtained in the state showing the low ",
    "frequency qpo . from table  [ side ] it can be seen that the lower kilohertz qpo frequency has to be below 850 hz for the low ",
    "frequency qpo to be detected . comparing the observed frequency distributions of the data set used by @xcite ( figure  [ distri ] shaded area _ top panel _ ) with that used in this work ( figure  [ distri ] overall grey line _ top panel _ )",
    "it is clear that besides an increase in the amount of data , the lower kilohertz qpo frequencies in the range 700850 hz are much better sampled in the new dataset .",
    "a likely explanation for the fact that the distribution of the observed lower kilohertz qpo frequencies is different during the new rxte observations from that observed in the data set used by @xcite , is that the x  ray flux of 4u  163653 has been decreasing over the last few years ( see fig .",
    "[ distri ] _ bottom panel _ ) , allowing many of the additional new observations to be obtained at flux levels and at lower kilohertz qpo frequencies which were sparsely observed before in 4u  163653 with rxte    51590 .",
