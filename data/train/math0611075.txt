    "the `` andrews squeezing system '' was first described by giles in @xcite and further studied in @xcite . it is a planar multibody system whose topology consists of closed kinematic loops ( see figure [ fig : angles ] ) .",
    "the andrews system was promoted in @xcite as a benchmark problem to compare different multibody solvers .",
    "nowadays it is a well - known benchmark problem @xcite for numerical integration of differential - algebraic equations as well .",
    "the equations are of the lagrangian form ( or descriptor form , see also @xcite ) @xmath0 where the function @xmath1 describes the dynamical equations and @xmath2 gives the ( holonomic ) constraints . here",
    "@xmath3 are the ( generalized ) position coordinates , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the first and second derivatives , respectively , and @xmath6 is the lagrange multiplier .    it is well known that singularities of any kind hinder solving equations numerically @xcite . intuitively , a singularity is where the ( generic ) number of degrees of freedom of the system changes .",
    "mathematically these are the points where the rank of the jacobian of @xmath2 drops .",
    "hence in this paper we will not consider the actual dynamical equations and analyse only the constraints given by @xmath2 .",
    "most differential equation solvers include a possibility to monitor singularities , and usually when proximity of a singularity is detected , the computation is best to be interrupted .",
    "but this kind of monitoring is local only , that is , it does not tell us a priori where the singularities lie but only alert us when it is too late to fix things , so to speak . also , the monitoring is often a non - negligible part of computational cost .",
    "therefore , it would be highly useful to know _ a priori _ where the singularities are , or to make sure that there are no singularities , or perhaps even remove them ( for the latter approach , see @xcite ) .",
    "locating singularities has been studied also in @xcite . if we can not avoid or remove the singularities , at least knowing where they are encountered is helpful ( indeed , necessary ) when planning the computation without interruptions .",
    "one can then tune the chosen integration algorithm such that the disturbing effect of the singularities is diminished , for example by compensating the singularity of the kepler problem by a local change of variables as in @xcite within the computation .",
    "further techniques on compensating singularities in multibody systems are gathered and concisely compared in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we present the situation in detail and formulate the constraint equations in polynomial form .",
    "section [ sec : algebra ] gathers the necessary algebraic tools .",
    "section [ sec : analysis ] contains the actual analysis where we show that the mechanism indeed has singularities for certain parameter values . in section",
    "[ sec : examples ] there are some numerical examples of singular configurations , and in section [ sec : discuss ] we summarize and discuss the results , and address possible future work .",
    "the squeezing mechanism is given by the following equations .",
    "@xmath7 compared to the original articles mentioned above , we have chosen the following notation for the parameters and angles : @xmath8 so the positions in cartesian coordinates of the fixed nodes @xmath9 and @xmath10 are given by @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and the lengths of the rods by @xmath13 , see figures [ fig : angles ] and [ fig : lengths ] .    fixing the parameters @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16",
    ", we have a map @xmath17 .",
    "hence the set of possible configurations , which is the zeroset @xmath18 , is in general a curve ( or possibly empty ) .",
    "our task is to analyse the singularities of @xmath19 , so let us state more precisely what is meant by a singularity . as mentioned before , in a singularity the number of degrees of freedom changes .",
    "it is well known @xcite that this corresponds to the situation where the rank of jacobian drops .",
    "let @xmath20 be any smooth map where @xmath21 and let @xmath22 be its jacobian matrix .",
    "let @xmath23 be the zeroset of @xmath1 .",
    "a point @xmath24 is a _ singular point _ of @xmath25 , if @xmath22 does not have maximal rank at @xmath26",
    ".    what in fact geometrically `` happens '' at a singular point may be quite complicated to determine .",
    "typically the tangent space to @xmath25 does not change continuously in the neighbourhood of a singular point , or possibly @xmath25 intersects itself there . however , in all cases numerical problems occur , so it is important to try to find all singular points .",
    "note that the constraint equations ( and hence the elements of its jacobian matrix ) are _ not _ polynomials , yet our algebraic approach works only in a polynomial setting .",
    "however , this problem is circumvented by reformulating @xmath27 as polynomials in the sines and cosines of @xmath28 by using the trigonometric identities @xmath29 setting @xmath30 we get the equations @xmath31 we have 13 polynomial equations ( @xmath32 ) , 11 parameters ( @xmath33 ) and 14 variables ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "note that each @xmath35 is of degree two in @xmath36 .",
    "the equations @xmath37 correspond directly to the 6 original equations @xmath38 with the simple substitutions above ( for example @xmath39 ) and the equations @xmath40 are the extra identities due to `` forgetting '' the angle variables @xmath28 .",
    "note that this reformulation of the constraints as algebraic equations is not just a trick which happens to work in this special case ; indeed most constraints appearing in the simulation of multibody systems are of this type .",
    "now the above equations define @xmath41 as a map @xmath42 .",
    "hence we expect that the zeroset @xmath43 is a curve ( or possibly empty ) .",
    "singularities are then the points of this curve where the rank of @xmath44 is not maximal . to find these points we need now to introduce some tools from commutative algebra .",
    "in this section we present briefly the necessary definitions from commutative algebra and algebraic geometry .",
    "more details can be found in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "these are roughly in the order of increasing difficulty , @xcite being the most accessible , but unfortunately not containing the necessary material on the fitting ideals .",
    "let @xmath45 be an algebraic field and let @xmath46 $ ] be the ring of polynomials in @xmath47 , with coefficients in @xmath45 .",
    "a subset @xmath48 $ ] is an _ ideal _ if it satisfies    1 .",
    "2 .   if @xmath50 , then @xmath51 .",
    "3 .   if @xmath52 and @xmath53 $ ] , then @xmath54 .",
    "ideals are often given by _",
    "generators_. let @xmath55 $ ] .",
    "then the set @xmath56 \\right\\}\\ ] ] is an _ ideal generated by _",
    "any set of generators is called a _",
    "basis_.    ideals are purely algebraic objects .",
    "the geometrical counterpart of an ideal is its locus , or variety .",
    "let @xmath58 be an ideal in @xmath59 $ ] .",
    "its corresponding _ variety _ is @xmath60 where @xmath61 is some field extension of @xmath45 .",
    "note that it is often natural to choose @xmath61 different from @xmath45 .",
    "if the field is clear from context we will sometimes write simply @xmath62 .",
    "now different ideals may have the same variety .",
    "however , if one is interested mainly in the variety then it is useful to define @xmath63\\,|\\ , f^n\\in i \\textrm{\\ \\",
    "for\\ some\\ \\ } n\\ge 1\\big\\}.\\ ] ] if @xmath58 is an ideal , then @xmath64 is the _ radical _ of @xmath58 ; it is the biggest ideal that has the same variety as @xmath58 and all ideals having the same variety have the same radical .",
    "also , always @xmath65 and if @xmath66 we say that @xmath58 is a _",
    "radical ideal_. some rudimentary properties among ideals and their varieties are in the following    let @xmath58 and @xmath67 be ideals",
    ". then    1 .",
    "2 .   @xmath69 .",
    "@xmath70 if and only if @xmath71 .",
    "next we have to express the rank condition algebraically . to this end",
    "we need    if @xmath72 , its _ fitting ideal _",
    "@xmath73 is the ideal generated by all maximal minors of the jacobian matrix of @xmath74 .",
    "now @xmath75 corresponds to the points where the rank is not maximal .",
    "however , the points are required also to be on @xmath62 .",
    "hence we conclude that the set of singular points , @xmath76 , is given by @xmath77 in analysing varieties it is often helpful to decompose them to simpler parts .",
    "similarly one may try to decompose a given ideal to simpler parts .",
    "this leads to following notions .",
    "a variety @xmath78 is _ irreducible _ if @xmath79 implies @xmath80 or @xmath81 .",
    "+ an ideal @xmath58 is _ prime _ if @xmath82 $ ] and @xmath83 imply that either @xmath84 or @xmath85 .",
    "there is a very close connection between prime ideals and irreducible varieties .",
    "the precise nature of this depends on the chosen field .",
    "however , for our purposes the following is sufficient .    if @xmath58 is prime , then @xmath62 is irreducible .",
    "+ any radical ideal can be written uniquely as a finite intersection of prime ideals , @xmath86 where @xmath87 for @xmath88 .",
    "this is known as the _ prime decomposition of @xmath89 _ and the @xmath90 s are called the minimal associated primes of @xmath58 .",
    "the above lemma then immediately gives :    @xmath91 where all @xmath92 are irreducible .",
    "hence our strategy in analysing varieties is to compute the minimal associated primes of the relevant ideal , and then examine each irreducible component separately .",
    "an essential thing is that all the operations above , especially finding the radical and the prime decomposition can be computed _ algorithmically _ using the given generators of @xmath58 . to do this we need to compute special bases for ideals , called grbner bases .",
    "we will only briefly indicate the relevant ideas and refer to @xcite and @xcite for more details .",
    "first we need to introduce _",
    "monomial orderings_. all the algorithms handling the ideals are based on some orderings among the terms of the generators of the ideal .",
    "intuitively , an ordering @xmath93 is such that given a set of monomials ( e.g. terms of a given polynomial ) , @xmath93 puts them in order of importance : given any two monomials @xmath94 and @xmath95 , where @xmath96 are different multi - indices , then either @xmath97 or @xmath98 .",
    "a common choice is to use _ degree reversed lexicographic _ ordering @xcite . in our analysis",
    "we shall frequently need _ product orders _",
    ", which are formed as follows : if @xmath99 and @xmath100 are two orderings , we shall divide the variables @xmath101 into two subsets , and use @xmath99 on the first subset and @xmath100 on the second .",
    "this is indicated with the following notation : @xmath102.\\ ] ] this is the same set as @xmath103 $ ] but now the parenthesis indicate that we will use @xmath99 among the variables @xmath104 , and @xmath100 among the variables @xmath105 , and moreover all monomials where variables of the first group appear are always bigger than monomials where there are only variables of the second group .",
    "we will see later why this is useful .",
    "finally , the aforementioned grbner basis is a special kind of generating set , with respect to some ordering . given any set of generators and an ordering , the corresponding grbner basis exists and",
    "can be computed .",
    "the relevant algorithm is usually called the _",
    "buchberger algorithm_. the drawback of this algorithm is that it has a very high complexity in the worst case , and in practice the complexity depends quite much on the chosen ordering .",
    "anyway grbner bases have proved to be very useful in many different applications .",
    "nowadays there exist many different implementations and improvements of the buchberger algorithm .",
    "we chose to use the well - known program singular @xcite , @xcite in all the computations in this paper .",
    "now getting back to our system we see that we can take the components of @xmath41 to be elements of @xmath106 $ ] where @xmath107 is the field of rational functions of @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 .",
    "hence we have an ideal @xmath108 $ ] and the corresponding fitting ideal @xmath109 .",
    "on the other hand we may view the `` parameters '' @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 also as variables since they appear polynomially in the equations ; hence we could also consider @xmath110 $ ] .",
    "taking this point of view we can give an intuitive description of what kind of situations we can expect .",
    "@xmath111\\\\        v_{{\\mathbb{r } } } ( j)\\subset { \\mathbb{r}}^{25}.     \\end{cases}\\ ] ] in this way @xmath112 should be 12 dimensional ( recall @xmath67 is generated by 13 equations ) , i.e. a curve depending on 11 parameters . on the other hand if we fix parameters @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 we get a curve in @xmath113 which will be denoted by @xmath114 . in the same way we can view @xmath115 as a variety in @xmath116 , and fixing the parameters we get the singular points @xmath117 . obviously @xmath118 .",
    "then what kind of variety should @xmath119 be ?",
    "since the jacobian of @xmath41 is of size @xmath120 , _ generically _ we expect to get 2 independent conditions in order the rank to drop .",
    "that is , augmenting @xmath67 with @xmath109 should bring in 2 more equations .",
    "hence we expect that @xmath119 is 10 dimensional ; in other words we expect that if 11 parameters are chosen independently then @xmath117 should be empty . on the other hand",
    "if a single condition among parameters is satisfied , then @xmath117 should consist of isolated points .",
    "further , if there are 2 conditions among parameters ( i.e. 9 parameters freely chosen ) , then it would be possible that @xmath117 were one dimensional .",
    "but then our original constraint equations would be redundant , i.e. there would be more than one degree of freedom .",
    "below we will in fact observe that if a certain condition on parameters is satisfied , @xmath117 is indeed a finite set of points .",
    "to study @xmath119 we could in principle use grbner basis theory in a straightforward manner .",
    "let @xmath121 be the grbner basis of @xmath122 using the product order @xmath123 $ ] .",
    "let us denote by @xmath124 the elements of @xmath121 which do not depend on @xmath125 and @xmath126 .    let @xmath127 ; then we say that @xmath128 is the singular variety associated to @xmath67 .",
    "it follows from the grbner basis theory that @xmath114 can have singularities _ only if _ @xmath129 .",
    "hence theoretically , we could now find the singularities of the andrews system in a straightforward manner by calculating the grbner basis of @xmath130 .",
    "but this is an enormous task , due to @xmath109 being generated by high degree polynomials , not to mention including the 11 parameters @xmath131 .",
    "we could not get the solution in a finite time using our work station with 64 gb memory .    instead , something else needs to be done .",
    "luckily there is another approach : noting that @xmath132 have common terms , as well as @xmath133 , gives us motivation to study two subsystems .",
    "one spanned by @xmath134 and @xmath135 , the other one spanned by @xmath136 and @xmath137 ( along with the relevant trigonometric identities from @xmath138 ) .",
    "these subsystems are handleable and give useful information for the whole system as well . proceeding in this way",
    "we could at least determine that the singular variety is not empty and we could compute some subvarieties of it .",
    "intuitively , the nodes and bars 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 formulate a subsystem , see figures [ fig : angles ] and [ fig : lengths ] .",
    "we suspect that when the lengths @xmath139 are such that the `` 4567 '' system is able to become one - dimensional , hence in some sense degenerated , there should be a singularity in the whole system ( see also the net example in @xcite ) .",
    "we will shortly see that this is indeed the case .",
    "define @xmath140 note that @xmath141 contain only angles @xmath142 , @xmath143 and parameters @xmath144 for @xmath145 .",
    "that is why we do not need the other @xmath35 s .",
    "let @xmath146 be the ideal spanned by @xmath147 .",
    "hence we have @xmath148\\ ] ] where we have indicated the relevant product order .",
    "the grbner basis @xmath121 for @xmath149 with respect to this ordering contains 191 elements ( denoted by @xmath150 ) , out of which 3 are especially enlightening : @xmath151 since @xmath152 is the only generator which does not contain any variables @xmath142 and @xmath143 we conclude that    [ thm : t_i ] the singular variety of @xmath146 is @xmath153    note that the factorization of @xmath152 gives us the prime decomposition of @xmath154 and hence decomposition of @xmath155 into 8 linear irreducible varieties .",
    "our next task is to show that at least some points of the singular variety extend to actual ( physically relevant ) singularities of the whole system .",
    "recall that each generator @xmath156 corresponds to an equation @xmath157 . since @xmath158 in physically relevant cases ,",
    "generators @xmath159 and @xmath160 imply that all the singularities of @xmath146 have necessarily @xmath161 ( conditions for the angles @xmath162 and @xmath163 ) .",
    "in other words , in ideal - theoretic language , we can as well study the ideal @xmath164 now the prime decomposition of @xmath165 has 16 components : @xmath166 inspecting the generators of each of @xmath167 , it is noticed that every @xmath167 contains the @xmath168 s or @xmath144 s .",
    "recall that a generator @xmath144 in an ideal corresponds in the variety to a condition @xmath169 which is non - physical .",
    "moreover , @xmath170 is now a non - physical condition contradicting @xmath171 . hence we discard ( as in @xcite ) those ideals which have a non - physical generator that would imply @xmath172 for some @xmath173 , and we are left with 7 ideals , whose generators are : @xmath174",
    "especially , we see that @xmath175 , @xmath176 , @xmath177 , and @xmath178 .",
    "now we are ready to continue with the original system @xmath179 .",
    "[ rem : t_i_physical ] mathematically speaking the analyses of all cases @xmath180 are completely similar . however ,",
    "on physical grounds the cases @xmath181 , @xmath182 , @xmath183 and @xmath184 are not so interesting .",
    "indeed , in these cases the length of one of the rods corresponding to @xmath185 , @xmath186 , @xmath187 and @xmath188 is equal to the sum of the lengths of three others .",
    "hence all four rods could be modelled as a single rod which would make the whole model significantly simpler . in the remaining cases",
    "no such reduction can be done , and we chose to examine the ideal @xmath189 in detail . see also remark [ rem : all_ti_same_q ] .",
    "the case @xmath189 gives us conditions @xmath190 , @xmath191 , @xmath192 , @xmath193 , and @xmath194 which we substitute into the original system . next we will show that the resulting system has real solutions .",
    "these will be the required singular points .",
    "the above substitutions simplify the generators of @xmath122 so that we get the following ideal : @xmath195 in @xmath196 we have 4 equations for 4 unknowns @xmath197 , @xmath198 , @xmath199 , and @xmath200 ; hence it appears reasonable that we can get a finite number of solutions .",
    "then we can substitute the computed values to @xmath201 which then becomes also a system of 4 equations for 4 unknowns @xmath202 , @xmath203 , @xmath204 , and @xmath205 . by the same reasoning",
    "we again expect that it is possible to get some solutions for appropriate parameter values .",
    "we could numerically solve the variables from these equations ( and , indeed , we will , in the numerical examples ) , but to analyze the situation in more detail we need to study these further .    then starting with the system",
    "@xmath196 we solve the angles 3 and 7 by the following trick .",
    "first we inspect the ideal generated by @xmath196 in the ring @xmath206.\\ ] ] calculating the grbner basis @xmath207 of @xmath208 with respect to the lexicographic ordering we get 4 generators : @xmath209 where the auxiliary expressions @xmath210 are lengthy combinations of the parameters @xmath211 ( see the appendix ) .",
    "but we have simplified these by hand . also @xcite could be used to automatically factorize into products but would involve some more elaborate programming . ]    now @xmath212 contains only @xmath200 and parameters .",
    "note that @xmath213 if and only if @xmath214 .",
    "assuming @xmath215 the equation @xmath216 is a polynomial in @xmath200 of degree 2 , hence in order to have real solutions we need to impose the condition @xmath217 this condition can easily be checked when the parameters @xmath131 have been given numerical values .",
    "once @xmath200 is known , @xmath218 can be solved from the linear equations of @xmath207 , provided @xmath215 and @xmath219 .",
    "the cases @xmath220 and/or @xmath214 can be summarized as follows :    * if @xmath220 but @xmath215 , we still get equations similar to @xmath221 , but now @xmath198 has a quadratic equation instead of @xmath200 . *",
    "if @xmath214 , the system typically does not have solutions .",
    "at least , a further condition among parameters , namely @xmath222 , arises .",
    "we shall not elaborate this nongeneric behaviour further . in section [ sec : a4_is_a5 ] we consider an example of this situation .",
    "in general , when the inequality in is strict , @xmath200 has 2 possible values .",
    "therefore , the tuples @xmath223 have in general 2 possible values because the other ones in the tuple are determined uniquely from @xmath200 .",
    "the only thing left to be done , in this @xmath146 subsystem case , is to solve @xmath224 .",
    "this is done with the ideal @xmath225 given in .",
    "[ rem : all_ti_same_q ] had we used any other @xmath180 instead of @xmath189 above , we would have ended up with this same ideal @xmath225 .",

    "we again use lexicographic ordering and get 4 generators @xmath229 .",
    "analogously to @xmath200 above , now for @xmath205 we get the second degree polynomial equation @xmath230 where @xmath231 and linear equations for @xmath232 : @xmath233 where the auxiliary expressions @xmath234 are certain known ( but lengthy ) functions of @xmath235 , apart from @xmath236 which depends on @xmath237 as well .",

    "the case @xmath245 , @xmath250 does not essentially change the situation : we still have a quadratic equation for @xmath205 , and linear ones for the others , with a different coefficient for @xmath202 .    the remaining case @xmath245 , @xmath251 corresponds to the situation where the centre node coincides with the origin .",
    "this gives another singularity ( the angle @xmath252 remains arbitrary ) but is a rather special case and will not be pursued further here .",
    "[ thm:1 ] let us suppose that the parameters @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 satisfy the following conditions : @xmath215 and @xmath253 then @xmath114 contains at least 2 singular points .",

    "it may appear that we also have at most 4 singular points .",
