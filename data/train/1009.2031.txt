    "@xcite proposed a family of two - parameter distributions to model failure time due to fatigue under cyclic loading and the assumption that failure follows from the development and growth of a dominant crack .",
    "this distribution is known as the two - parameter birnbaum ",
    "saunders ( @xmath0 ) distribution or as the fatigue life distribution .",
    "the @xmath0 distribution is an attractive alternative to the weibull , gamma , and log - normal models , since its derivation considers the basic characteristics of the fatigue process .",
    "a more general derivation was provided by @xcite based on a biological model and relaxing several of the assumptions made by @xcite .",
    "@xcite investigated the relationship between the @xmath0 distribution and the inverse gaussian distribution and demonstrated that the @xmath0 distribution is an equal - weight mixture of an inverse gaussian distribution and its complementary reciprocal ; see also @xcite .",
    "the random variable @xmath1 is said to have a @xmath0 distribution with parameters @xmath2 , say @xmath3 , if its cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the standard normal distribution function , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are shape and scale parameters , respectively .",
    "also , @xmath9 is the median of the distribution : @xmath10 . for any constant @xmath11",
    ", it follows that @xmath12 .",
    "it is noteworthy that the reciprocal property holds for the @xmath0 distribution : @xmath13 ; see @xcite . the probability density and hazard ratio functions corresponding to ( [ cdf ] )",
    "are given by @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the expected value , variance , skewness and kurtosis are , respectively , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "a general expression to obtain the moments of  ( [ pdf ] ) was derived by @xcite and is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes the modified bessel function of the third kind and order @xmath24 . as noted before , if @xmath25 , then @xmath13 .",
    "it then follows that @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the @xmath0 distribution is positively skewed and the asymmetry of the distribution decreases with @xmath8 .",

    "@xcite discussed the shape of the hazard function of the @xmath0 distribution .",
    "improved frequentist inference for the @xmath0 distribution is discussed in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , while estimation using reference prior is presented in @xcite .",
    "extensions of the @xmath0 distribution are proposed in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "also , @xcite introduced the @xmath0 autoregressive conditional duration model and @xcite developed various acceptance sampling schemes based on the truncated life tests .",
    "little work has been published on the analysis of censored data for the @xmath0 distribution although censoring is common in reliability and survival studies .",
    "@xcite considered parametric estimation for the @xmath0 distribution based on type - ii censored samples .",
    "@xcite explored and compared different procedures to compute confidence intervals for the parameters and quantiles of the @xmath0 distribution for complete and type - i censored data .",
    "@xcite and @xcite discussed the maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters of the @xmath0 distribution and proposed a simple bias - reduction method to reduce the bias of the maximum likelihood estimators ( mles ) based on type - ii censored samples and random censoring , respectively . also , @xcite discussed the estimation of the parameters of the @xmath0 distribution under censored samples .",
    "a particularly useful censoring mechanism is the type - ii ( right ) censoring , which occurs when @xmath29 items are placed on test and the experiment is terminated when the first @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) items fail .",
    "since life testing is often time consuming and expensive , type - ii censoring may be used to reduce testing time and costs . this paper focus on testing inference for the @xmath0 distribution under type - ii censored samples .",
    "a commonly used test procedure is the likelihood ratio test .",
    "a new criterion for testing hypotheses , referred to as the _ gradient test _ , was proposed by @xcite .",
    "its statistic shares the same first order asymptotic properties with the likelihood ratio statistic . like the likelihood ratio statistic and unlike the score and the wald statistics , the gradient statistic does not require computation of the information matrix , neither observed nor expected , which is an advantage in problems involving censored samples .",
    "the chief goal of our paper is to present monte carlo simulations in order to evaluate and compare the performance of the likelihood ratio and gradient tests for the @xmath0 distribution under type - ii right censored samples .",
    "the other two tests will be briefly taken into account in our simulation study . to the best of our knowledge",

    "the limiting distribution of @xmath45 and @xmath46 is @xmath58 under @xmath47 and @xmath59 , i.e.  a noncentral chi - square distribution with @xmath37 degrees of freedom and an appropriate noncentrality parameter @xmath60 , under @xmath48 .",
    "the null hypothesis is rejected for a given nominal level , @xmath61 say , if the test statistic exceeds the upper @xmath62 quantile of the @xmath63 distribution .",
    "@xcite points out that the gradient statistic `` is not transparently non - negative , even though it must be so asymptotically . ''",
    "his theorem 2 implies that if the log - likelihood function is concave and is differentiable at @xmath64 , then @xmath65 .",
    "recently , @xcite derived the nonnull asymptotic expansion of the distribution of the gradient test statistic for a composite hypothesis under a sequence of local alternative hypotheses converging to the null hypothesis at rate @xmath66 .",
    "the authors also compared the local powers of the gradient , likelihood ratio , wald and score tests . in general",
    ", no test is uniformly better than the others as far as local power is concerned .",
    "@xcite obtained the nonnull asymptotic expansions of the likelihood ratio , wald , score and gradient statistics in birnbaum ",
    "saunders regression models when no censoring is present .",
    "an interesting finding is that , up to an error of order @xmath67 , the four tests have the same local power in this class of models .",
    "their simulation study evidenced that the score and the gradient tests perform better than the likelihood ratio and wald tests in small and moderate - sized samples .",
    "let @xmath68 be an ordered type - ii right censored random sample obtained from @xmath29 units placed on a life - testing experiment wherein each unit has its lifetime following the @xmath0 distribution , with the largest @xmath69 lifetimes having been censored .",
    "let @xmath70 be the parameter vector .",
    "for notational convenience , let @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the standard normal density function .",
    "the likelihood function can be written as @xcite @xmath73 where @xmath74 .",
    "thus , the log - likelihood function , except for a constant term , is given by @xmath75 by taking partial derivatives of the log - likelihood function with respect to @xmath8 and @xmath9 we obtain the components of the score vector , @xmath76 : @xmath77 @xmath78 setting @xmath79 and @xmath80 equal to zero yields the mle @xmath81 of @xmath82 .",
    "these equations can not be solved analytically and statistical software can be used to solve them numerically via iterative methods . the bfgs method ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with analytical derivatives has been used for maximizing the log - likelihood function @xmath32 .",
    "we now consider hypothesis testing on the parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 based on the likelihood ratio and gradient statistics .",
    "the interest lies in testing the null hypotheses @xmath83 which are tested against @xmath84 and @xmath85 , respectively . here",
    "@xmath86 and @xmath87 are positive known scalars . for testing @xmath88 , the likelihood ratio and gradient statistics are given by @xmath89 where @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the unrestricted mles obtained from the maximization of @xmath32 under the alternative hypotheses , @xmath92 is the restricted mle obtained from the maximization of @xmath32 under @xmath88 and @xmath93 .",

    "the limiting distribution of these statistics is @xmath98 under the respective null hypothesis . in both cases ,",
    "the null hypothesis is rejected if the chosen test statistic exceeds the upper @xmath62 quantile of the @xmath99 distribution .",
    "theorem 3 in @xcite points out an important feature of the gradient test .",
    "it suggests that we can , in general , improve the approximation of the distribution of the gradient statistic by a chi - square distribution under the null hypothesis by using a less biased estimator .",
    "on the other hand , theorem 2 in @xcite indicates that if the estimate used in the gradient statistic is not the maximum likelihood , the non - negativity of the gradient statistic is not guaranteed .",
    "a bias - corrected estimator for @xmath8 was derived in @xcite and is given by @xmath100\\biggr\\}^{-1}.\\ ] ] the authors showed through monte carlo simulations that @xmath101 is less biased than the original mle , @xmath90 , of @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , based on this estimator , we can define the adjusted gradient statistic @xmath102 for testing the null hypothesis @xmath103 .",
    "the limiting distribution of @xmath104 is also @xmath98 under @xmath88 .",
    "it is expected that the gradient test that uses the statistic @xmath104 have better size performance than the gradient test based on the original gradient statistic @xmath105 .",
    "a disadvantage of the adjusted gradient statistic @xmath104 is that it can take on negative values .",
    "however , in order to avoid negative values we shall redefine @xmath104 as @xmath106 an adjusted gradient statistic for testing the null hypothesis @xmath107 is not considered here because a bias - corrected estimator for @xmath9 is not available . in the next section , we shall present an extensive monte carlo study in order to evaluate and compare the performance of the tests presented in this section .",
    "in this section we shall present an extensive monte carlo simulation study in which we evaluate and compare the finite sample performance of the likelihood ratio and gradient tests for testing hypotheses on the parameters of the @xmath0 distribution under type - ii right censored samples .",
    "we set the degree of censoring ( d.o.c . ) at @xmath108 , the sample size at @xmath109 and 40 , and the shape parameter at @xmath110 and 1.0 . without loss of generality ,",

    "a natural question at this point is why the wald and the rao score tests were not included in the previous simulation experiments .",

    "a common practice in such a case is to use the observed information in the place of the expected information .",
    "we followed this approach and ran various simulation experiments including the wald and the score tests .",
    "our general conclusion is that these tests can not be recommended for the following reasons .",
    "first , the wald and score tests were markedly oversized .",
    "for example , for @xmath115 , @xmath124 and @xmath139 , the null rejection rates of the wald and score tests for testing the null hypothesis @xmath121 are , respectively , 13.79% and 15.61% for d.o.c .",

    "= 30% and 19.02% and 13.70% for d.o.c .",
    "second , in our simulations the inverse of the observed information matrix frequently produced negative standard errors in censored samples .    in summary ,",
    "the best performing test for @xmath8 is the adjusted gradient test , i.e.  the one that uses the bias - corrected estimator of @xmath8 .",
    "as far as hypothesis testing on @xmath9 is concerned , the gradient test performs better than the likelihood ratio test and should be preferred .",
    "in this section , we shall illustrate the use of the likelihood ratio and gradient tests in three real data sets .",
    "the first data set , collected by members of the instrument development unit of the physical research staff , boeing airplane company , are the number of cycles - to - failure of 101 strips of 6061-t6 aluminum sheeting , cut parallel to the direction of rolling .",
    "each had been subjected to periodic loading with a frequency of 18 cycles per second , and maximum stress of 31 kpsi .",
    "the data were taken from table 8 of @xcite .",
    "suppose we are interested in testing @xmath140 against @xmath141 and @xmath142 against @xmath143 .",
    "these hypotheses were considered in @xcite .",

    "note that for complete data without censoring ( @xmath144 ) and when @xmath145 , at the 5% significance level , the likelihood ratio test does not reject the null hypothesis @xmath88 unlike the gradient tests .",
    "for the other values of @xmath30 , the likelihood ratio and the gradient tests lead to the same conclusion . in all cases ,",
    "the gradient tests provide stronger evidence against the null hypothesis ( smaller @xmath39-values than the likelihood test ) . for testing the null hypothesis @xmath94",
    ", the same decision is reached by the likelihood ratio and gradient tests , i.e.  the null hypothesis @xmath94 is rejected at any usual significance level .",

    "we considered the likelihood ratio and a recently proposed test , the gradient test .",
    "as evidenced by our simulation results , in general the likelihood ratio test is oversized ( liberal ) , whereas the gradient test is undersized ( conservative ) and less size distorted than the likelihood ratio test .",
