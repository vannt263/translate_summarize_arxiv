    "singer was the first to observe that if a function has a negative schwarzian derivative then this property is preserved under iteration and moreover that this property puts restrictions on the type and number of periodic orbits the function can have @xcite .",
    "these properties , as well as those results derived from them , essentially rely on the global structure functions with a negative schwarzian derivative have . for a full list of such properties",
    "see @xcite .",
    "later it was found that such functions also possess local properties useful in establishing certain distortion bounds . for the most part these properties",
    "are concerned with the way in which functions with a negative schwarzian derivative increase cross ratios .",
    "because of these special properties some results are known only in the case where a function has a negative schwarzian derivative .",
    "an exception , however , to this is the result by kozlovski @xcite where it was shown that the assumption of a negative schwarzian derivative is superfluous in the case of any @xmath0 unimodal map with nonflat critical point . for such functions",
    "there is always some interval around their critical value on which the first return map has a negative schwarzian derivative .",
    "that is locally all such @xmath0 maps behave as maps with a negative schwarzian derivative .",
    "more recently using the same technique van strien and vargas have generalized this result to multimodal functions @xcite .",
    "also graczyk , sands and swiatek have shown that any @xmath0 unimodal map with only repelling periodic points is analytically conjugate to a map with a negative schwarzian derivative @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of these results is to relate functions without a negative schwarzian derivative to functions with this property .",
    "in this paper we consider those @xmath1 functions on a finite interval of the real line having some iterate with a negative schwarzian derivative .",
    "this class , which we call functions with an _ eventual negative schwarzian derivative _ , was originally introduced by l. bunimovich ( 2007 , personal communication ) in an attempt to describe some one - dimensional maps which appear in neuroscience @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy that this class of functions is broader than those previously considered in the study of unimodal and multimodal maps related to functions with a negative schwarzian derivative ( see for example @xcite ) . to demonstrate this we will present examples of such functions and further examples",
    "can also be found in @xcite . moreover , as having an eventual negative schwarzian derivative is not an asymptotic condition , verifying whether a function has this property can often be done by direct computation .",
    "hence , the concept of an eventual negative schwarzian derivative has potential to be very useful in applications .",
    "since this class contains functions with a negative schwarzian derivative as a subset we do not attempt to prove stronger results then have already been proved for this smaller class of functions . with this in mind the large majority of the results we will present",
    "will simply be restatements of those already known with the modification that only some iterate of our function need have a negative schwarzian derivative .",
    "we note that this by no means is meant to be an exhaustive list of such results as the purpose of this paper is to give further evidence that the useful properties possessed by functions with negative schwarzian derivative are not limited to this family of functions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in the next section we formally introduce the class of functions we are considering and present our main results .",
    "section 3 presents the proof of those results that are topological in nature . specifically , we prove an analogue of singer s theorem in @xcite and mention some important concepts and corollaries that will be useful in what follows .",
    "section 4 is comprised of those proofs which are more measure theoretic . specifically , we generalize the main results in @xcite to this larger class of functions . in section 5",
    "we give a partial characterization of functions that have an eventual negative schwarzian derivative as well as some examples .",
    "the next section is devoted to an application of these results to a one - parameter family of maps that model the electrical activity in a neuronal cell near the transition to bursting @xcite .",
    "section 7 contains some concluding remarks .",
    "in this paper we consider only @xmath1 functions @xmath2 on some nontrivial compact interval @xmath3 of real numbers having a nonempty but finite set of critical points @xmath4 and use the notation @xmath5 to denote the derivative with respect to the spacial variable .",
    "a @xmath1 function @xmath2 is said to have a _ negative schwarzian derivative _ if on any open interval @xmath6 , not containing critical points of @xmath7 , @xmath8 is strictly convex on @xmath9 .",
    "if @xmath2 is @xmath0 then its _ schwarzian derivative _ is defined off of @xmath4 by @xmath10 if @xmath11 is strictly negative on open intervals not containing critical points of @xmath7 then @xmath12 is strictly convex on these sets or @xmath7 has a negative schwarzian derivative .",
    "however , the converse does not always hold .",
    "we say a @xmath1 function @xmath2 has an _ eventual negative schwarzian derivative _ if there exists @xmath13 such that @xmath14 has a negative schwarzian derivative .",
    "the smallest such number @xmath15 is said to be the _ order _ of the derivative .",
    "a @xmath1 map @xmath2 is called _ s - multimodal _ if : + ( i ) @xmath4 is nonempty and finite . + ( ii ) for every @xmath16 , @xmath17 is _",

    "we will make use of the following standard terminology .",
