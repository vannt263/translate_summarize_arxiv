    "the realization that string theory gives rise to a landscape of vacua opened the possibility that our universe may be one of many nucleating bubbles expanding in an eternally inflating false vacuum @xcite .",
    "the resulting picture poses a number of novel , conceptual problems : it is difficult to consistently define probabilities in eternal inflation ( the cosmological measure problem ) while the richness of the string landscape may pose an intrinsically insurmountable obstacle to phenomenological studies traceable to complexity theory @xcite .",
    "this paper follows a suggestion of @xcite to study one aspect of eternal inflation that is not afflicted by these difficulties , namely the topology formed by the nucleating bubbles .",
    "one such study was carried out in @xcite , whose authors considered the topology and physics arising from a toy landscape containing two vacua , called white and black .",
    "this paper explores the effects of including more realistic , richer landscapes on the resulting multiverse topologies .",
    "classifying multiverses by topology is worthwhile for several reasons .",
    "first , it is well defined : i will be looking at topologies formed by nucleating and expanding bubbles on global spacelike slices of an inflating geometry , but as shown in @xcite , these topologies are independent of the choice of slicing",
    ". second , topology allows one to study the global picture of eternal inflation without tackling the cosmological measure problem first .",
    "third , it is robust in that it is not sensitive to details of bubble wall dynamics , collisions or other modeling peculiarities .",
    "consequently , one can reliably resort to simplified models ; in what follows i shall employ a discrete toy model due to mandelbrot @xcite , which has beeen utilized previously in studies of eternal inflation , notably in @xcite .",
    "finally , the different topological phases of eternal inflation are characterized by different physics , much of which has not yet been fully understood . in sec .",
    "[ prelim ] i will briefly review the results of @xcite , who gave a physical characterization of the topological phases arising from a two - vacuum landscape .",
    "it is important to understand which of their findings carry over to more realistic , richer landscapes . as a first step in this direction , the present paper classifies the topologies arising from a landscape consisting of three vacua ( called white , grey and black ) and discusses the many - vacuum limit qualitatively .",
    "topological phases of eternal inflation are differentiated by the existence of crossing curves and crossing surfaces @xcite .",
    "roughly , the system is said to possess white crossing curves if at arbitrarily late times , any two arbitrarily far regions are connected by a curve wholly surrounded by the white vacuum .",
    "the definition of white crossing surfaces pertains to the existence at arbitrarily late times of surfaces entirely contained in the white region , whose boundary is arbitrarily large .",
    "of course , the definitions for grey and black crossing curves and surfaces are analogous .",
    "below i consistently use abbreviations wxc ( white x - ing curves ) and wxs ( white x - ing surfaces ) and their analogues for grey and black regions .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the existence of crossing curves and surfaces is independent of the choice of time slicing .",
    "topological phases are defined over a parameter space , whose natural coordinates are the dimensionless nucleation rates of the bubbles of various colors , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the hubble volume .    the main results of this paper are phase diagrams , which describe how multiverse topology varies over the space of landscape parameters .",
    "i consider explicitly a landscape containing three vacua and comment on the general case in the discussion . in finding the phase diagrams ,",
    "i employ the following strategy :    1 .",
    "reduce the problem to its discrete version , a three - vacuum analogue of the mandelbrot model @xcite .",

    "though one can not lift it to continuous eternal inflation on a quantitative level , its qualitative lessons are robust and generalizable to more realistic landscapes .",
    "they suggest that rich landscapes generically give rise to a grainy phase , in which the geometry is packed with a hodgepodge of bubbles of various colors .",
    "other topological phases arise on the scale of several generations of nucleations .",
    "more details are given in the discussion .",
    "consider a toy landscape consisting of three vacua : a false vacuum labeled white , an intermediate vacuum labeled grey , and a true vacuum labeled black .",
    "assume that each vacuum has a non - negative cosmological constant .",
    "start in an initial all - white universe .",
    "bubbles of grey or black vacuum will form in the white region @xcite with rates @xmath2 and @xmath3 and further , inside the nucleated grey regions , bubbles of black vacuum will appear with the rate @xmath4 .",
    "i assume that all transitions are irreversible ( e.g. @xmath5 ) , but otherwise the nucleation rates are not subject to any constraints .",
    "the @xmath6 s compete with the rates of expansion of the parent white and grey vacua : when @xmath7 , the nucleated regions take over the geometry , but when this condition is not satisfied , the white ( or grey ) region persists indefinitely , giving rise to eternal inflation .",
    "the present paper seeks to understand the connectivity of grey and black regions on spatial slices of this system at late times , as functions of the dimensionless nucleation rates @xmath8 and their analogues @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "@xcite showed that this question is well defined , because the topology of the regions filled with descendant vacua is independent of the choice of time slicing .      ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) studied the analogous problem for a landscape consisting of two vacua .",
    "they found four topological phases , distinguished by the presence or absence of white crossing surfaces ( wxs ) , white crossing curves ( wxc ) and their black analogues ( bxs and bxc ) .",
    "formally , these objects are defined as follows .",
    "consider a three - dimensional ball of constant comoving radius in the multiverse , and select two disjoint open sets on the sphere surrounding it .",
    "if at arbitrarily late times the ball possesses a curve entirely contained in regions of one vacuum ( definite color , henceforth ` monochromatic ' ) that connects the two open sets , then we say that the multiverse contains crossing curves of that color . likewise ,",
    "if at arbitrarily late times the ball contains a monochromatic surface that bisects it and screens the two open sets from one another , then we say that the multiverse contains crossing surfaces of that color .",
    "the four topological phases identified by @xcite are :    1 .   * the black island phase * , which contains wxs but no bxc or bxs .",
    "the white regions inflate eternally .",
    "the black regions are isolated cdl bubbles filled with open frw universes",
    ". they will occassionally collide with other similar bubbles so that their boundary will be a surface whose genus increases in time .",
    "the tubular phase * , which contains crossing curves of both colors , but no crossing surfaces of either color .",
    "it is separated from the black island phase by a percolation transition studied in @xcite .",
    "the genus of the boundary of the black region becomes infinite in finite time .",
    "the white island phase * contains bxs but no wxc or wxs .",
    "it is characterized by a phenomenon , which @xcite called ` cracking , ' whereby the white regions become disconnected .",
    "the analysis of @xcite indicates that this leads to a formation of singularities in black regions , which may be mimicked by kruskal - schwarzschild black holes .",
    "thus , an observer in a black region does not see all the disconnected boundaries , but rather a finite number of boundaries demarcating white regions and a finite number of black hole horizons , each sized no larger than roughly the hubble scale of the ancestor vacuum",
    ". a likely final fate of this geometry is a big crunch .",
    "* the aborted phase * is the phase in which the black vacuum entirely takes over the geometry while the white regions disappear .",
    "this takes place when @xmath11 .",
    "part of the motivation of this work is to check to what degree these findings extend to more general scenarios . as a first step toward that goal",
    ", i classify the phases of the three - vacuum mandelbrot model by their topology , leaving their observational or theoretical characterization to future work .      ref .",
    "@xcite motivated and illustrated their findings with a discrete model of eternal inflation .",
    "variants of the same model were also used in prior studies of eternal inflation @xcite . because the present paper deals with a more complex situation , it is useful to carefully derive the correspondence between eternal inflation and its discrete analogue .",
    "the interesting topology of eternal inflation arises from collisions between bubbles .",
    "a bubble of a descendant vacuum grows with a speed approaching the speed of light @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the surrounding parent vacuum expands with a rate determined by its hubble scale .",
    "thus , in comoving coordinates of the parent vacuum , the bubble approaches a finite size given by the hubble scale of the parent at the time of nucleation .",
    "consequently , in cosmologies characterized by an accelerated expansion such as de sitter , younger bubbles are smaller _ when expressed in coming coordinates_. this is represented on the left of fig .",

    "]    the goal is to study this system using a discrete model . how to discretize the left of fig .",
    "[ discretizing ] ?",
    "the first step is to chop the spatial slices of the geometry into discrete cells .",
    "the optimal cell size is the hubble scale of the ancestor vacuum . with this choice",
    ", a nucleation event can be represented by filling the cell with the color of the nucleated vacuum .",
    "this is consistent , because each bubble quickly attains the parent hubble size , though it never outgrows it .",
    "furthermore , two bubbles are expected to collide if their nucleations are separated by distances smaller than the parent hubble distance ; otherwise their growth does not catch up with the expansion of the surrounding vacuum and they remain disconnected .",
    "this rule , which determines the connectivity of the bubbles , is naturally captured by setting the spatial unit cell to be hubble sized .",
    "the hubble length in comoving coordinates is given by @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the scale factor .",
    "if the expansion of the parent vacuum accelerates , @xmath12 is a decreasing function of time , which means that the hubble length , when expressed in comoving coordinates , decreases .",
    "thus , our unit spatial cells must in time be subdvided into smaller units . if one splits time into @xmath14 intervals , each unit cell must be subdivided into @xmath15 subunits in each linear dimension .",
    "thus , in three spatial dimensions , one subdivides each unit cell into @xmath16 sub - cells while in two dimensions the subdivision is into @xmath17 subunits . to take advantage of the convenience of a discrete model",
    ", one should select @xmath14 so that @xmath18 is a natural number . in de sitter",
    ", this corresponds to setting @xmath14 to be an order unity multiple of the hubble time .",
    "the resulting model is known as the mandelbrot model @xcite .",
    "it remains to find a discrete analogue for the nucleation rate @xmath6 , which defines the probability with which bubbles nucleate in a given four - volume .",
    "our time intervals and spatial cells select a discrete unit of four - volume @xmath19 and , by extension , a dimensionless quantity @xmath20 .",
    "the probability with which the cells of the discrete model are colored black ( or grey ) must be a function of this quantity : @xmath21 setting @xmath22 is natural , but it is not the only reasonable choice .",
    "for example , the frequency of bubble nucleations in a given four - volume is given by the poisson distribution ; from that point of view , _ not coloring _ a discrete cell should happen with probability @xmath23 .",
    "the ambiguity in defining @xmath24 shows that one should not attempt to derive quantitative results about eternal inflation from the mandelbrot model .",

    "there is a black island phase ( which contains wxs and no bxc ) , a tubular phase ( which has crossing curves of both colors but no crossing surfaces ) , a white island phase ( which contains bxs and no wxc ) , and the aborted phase ( all black ) .",
    "the crossover value between the black island phase and the tubular phase is denoted @xmath33 : after infinitely many iterations , bxc appear and wxs are eliminated if and only if @xmath34 . in the tubular phase",
    "white and black regions each form connected networks of infinite genus .",
    "the critical value separating the tubular and the white island phase is @xmath35 : after infinitely many iterations bxs appear and wxc are eliminated if and only if @xmath36 . the phase transitions at @xmath37 are first order .",

    "consequently , the threshold values for the existence of white and grey crossing curves and surfaces , as well as for the white and grey regions to be empty , are different from one another . for this reason ,",
    "i use superscripts to distinguish the critical probabilities governing the behavior of white and grey regions .",
    "for example , the probability of finding a wxs after infinitely many iterations vanishes if and only if @xmath45 , but an analogous statement for grey regions , whatever its exact form , must depend on @xmath46 and not @xmath47 .",
    "note that the parameter space of the three - vacuum mandelbrot model is a product of a 1-simplex ( @xmath48 ) and a 2-simplex ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "i do not consider variations of @xmath43 and @xmath44 explicitly , because their effect is captured by shifting the phase boundaries @xmath50 .    in all figures in this section , phase divisions that are known exactly ( as functions of @xmath51 , etc .",

    "the different regimes are separated by downward - sloping 45@xmath53 lines intersecting the @xmath28 axis at the critical values .",
    "the logic is that from the viewpoint of the white region , nucleations of the grey and black types are indistinguishable , so the boundary of the region containing wxs must be a level set of @xmath54 .",
    "for example , since @xmath55 marks the two - vacuum cross - over from the black island ( including wxs ) to the tubular ( including wxc ) phase , the line @xmath56 demarcates the presence and absence of wxs .",

    "therefore , a phase boundary at constant @xmath61 initially curves towards the diagonal @xmath63 , but becomes a straight line in the region @xmath64 , because in the white - aborted phase and in the absence of grey@xmath62black transitions the relative abundance of grey and black can only depend on the ratio @xmath65 .",
    "2 .   consider the boundary between the phases containing black islands and bxc as @xmath31 increases .",

    "if @xmath68 , then every grey region eventually becomes black and @xmath54 is again the relevant quantity for studying the topology of black .",
    "point  3 of grey regions extends this conclusion to @xmath69 ( for bxc and bxs , respectively ) .",
    "4 .   finally for the aborted phase , in addition to the condition inherited from the two - vacuum system , @xmath70 , for positive @xmath27 one must also impose @xmath68 to ensure that all the nucleating grey regions eventually become black .",

    "this expression can not vanish unless both terms in the numerator go to zero individually , which is equivalent to the condition stated above .",
    "physically , the requirement on @xmath54 is necessary because when it is violated , white regions continue to nucleate grey bubbles forever , which therefore persist arbitrarily late despite the fact that each individual grey bubble eventually turns entirely black .",
    "3 .   consider the regime @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",

    "only the last possibility represents an obstruction to gxc , which shows that on @xmath76 and @xmath77 , the boundary of the grey - tubular phase is @xmath67 . when @xmath80 , one obtains a grey tubular network of infinite genus forming gxc , which is percolated by a black tubular network of infinite genus containing bxc .",
    "this confirms the statement anticipated in point  3 of black regions  that bxc exist so long as @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",

    "in contrast , the three - vacuum model contains three new , monochromatic tubular phases as well as a democratic tubular phase , which contains crossing curves of all three colors .",
    "the latter phase has an analogue for any number of vacua : the sequence of transition probabilities @xmath91 ( with all other @xmath92 set to zero ) leads to a series of tubular networks , which are contained in one another in the order in which they nucleate .",
    "this note determines the phase structure of the three - vacuum mandelbrot model , which is a natural discrete toy model for studying the topology of three - vacuum eternal inflation .",
    "the model differs from those studied in @xcite in that it was not designed in order to reveal quantitative results for a specific scenario .",
    "instead , it illustrates the wealth of behaviors , which can arise in a complex landscape containing many disorderly arranged minima : already with three vacua , the model has fourteen topological phases .",
    "some of them are qualitatively novel , especially the all - tubular phase containing crossing curves of all colors , one inside another .",
    "these new phases are not artifacts of the discreteness of the model or of limiting the landscape to three vacua . on the contrary ,",
    "their emergence is a good starting point for imagining the phase structure of realistic eternal inflation .",
    "it is useful to focus first on the three monochromatic tubular phases , which contain crossing curves of only one color .",
    "it is natural to conjecture that with four vacua , the three - dimensional mandelbrot model develops a grainy phase devoid of any crossing curves .",
    "( indeed , such a phase exists in the three - vacuum mandelbrot model in two dimensions . )",
    "this phase should have an analogue in realistic eternal inflation , at least when the number of vacua is large enough .",
    "furthermore , it is clear that as the number of vacua grows , the grainy phase takes up more and more volume of the phase diagram .",
    "this is because additional vacua take up space , so it is increasingly difficult to sustain extended structures of any color . at the same time , the conditions for the existence of crossing curves and surfaces become increasingly limiting : if a vacuum @xmath93 decays to @xmath94 descendants , crossing curves or surfaces require the smalless of a sum of @xmath94 transition rates .",
    "thus , one is led to the conclusion that as the number of vacua grows , the system is increasingly likely to find itself in the grainy phase , in which isolated bubbles of different vacua fill the geometry without forming crossing curves or surfaces . of course , this statement relies on the landscape being so large as to be essentially random ; the grainy phase is generic in the ensemble of all large landscapes .",
    "the grainy phase is physically interesting .",
    "it is characterized by continuous cracking : a process in which the boundary of the parent vacuum region becomes disconnected .",
    "@xcite concluded that in the two - vacuum model cracking leads to a formation of singularities in the surrounding descendant vacuum . in the many - vacuum case , however , every connected component of the parent vacuum region is surrounded by a collection of bubbles , each filled with a different vacuum .",

    "one example of this is shown in fig .  [ hierarchy ] : the range of parameters in the shaded region of the phase diagram gives rise to an arrangement containing grey islands , each of which is percolated by a black tubular network that could be called an intrabubble bxc",
    ". the right panel of fig .",
    "[ hierarchy ] presents a cartoon of the resulting geometry .",
    "the emerging picture is the following . on a global slice",
    "the grainy phase is generic .",
    "the global geometry becomes partitioned into randomly colored solids , which do not form crossing curves .",
    "however , particular spheres can contain interesting topologies such as intrabubble crossing curves described in the last paragraph , or intrabubble crossing surfaces .",
    "moreover , from sec .",
    "[ 3ddiag ] we know that crossing curves can in principle be nested inside one another ad infinitum .",
    "overall , the topological phases studied in the present paper and in @xcite are also generic in eternal inflation .",
    "their appearance , however , is likely limited to a scale of several generations , beyond which the multiverse finds itself in the grainy phase .",
    "it would be extremely interesting to derive this picture of eternal inflation from a theoretical framework such as @xcite .",
