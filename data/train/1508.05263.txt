    "<S> we study the thermal transport occurring in the system of solar captured dark matter ( dm ) and explore its impact on the dm indirect search signal . </S>",
    "<S> we particularly focus on the scenario of self - interacting dm ( sidm ) . </S>",
    "<S> the flows of energies in and out of the system are caused by solar captures via dm - nucleon and dm - dm scatterings , the energy dissipation via dm annihilation , and the heat exchange between dm and solar nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> we examine the dm temperature evolution and demonstrate that the dm temperature can be higher than the core temperature of the sun if the dm - nucleon cross section is sufficiently small such that the energy flow due to dm self - interaction becomes relatively important . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the correct dm temperature should be used for accurately predicting the dm annihilation rate , which is relevant to the dm indirect detection .    </S>",
    "<S> dark matter ( dm ) composes about 25% of the energy density of in the universe and plays an important role in the structure formation . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown that if the galactic halo is constituted by weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) , there is a high possibility that these wimps are captured by the sun  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in general there are thermal energy flows between the captured dms and the nuclei in the sun . </S>",
    "<S> microscopically , such flows are caused by particle scatterings . </S>",
    "<S> for collisionless cold dark matter ( ccdm ) , the scatterings are only between the dm and solar nuclei . regarding the huge difference in abundance between the two , it is reasonable to take the dm temperature to be identical to the core temperature of the sun . </S>",
    "<S> however , the scenario of sidm can change the picture dramatically . </S>",
    "<S> in such a scenario , the energy transports via dm self - capture and dm - nucleus scattering compete with each other . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> if dm - nucleus interaction is much weaker than expected , the thermal exchange between dms and nuclei would be much less efficient . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the dm temperature can be distinct from the solar core temperature .    </S>",
    "<S> it is worth mentioning that the dm abundance is not much affected with a suppressed dm - nucleon cross section @xmath0 provided sidm is considered  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the accumulated dm abundance is determined by the balance among the capture , the evaporation , and the annihilation rates . </S>",
    "<S> earlier works on such processes only consider dm - nucleon interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the new effects from dm self - interaction are investigated recently  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the consideration of sidm comes from the discrepancies between the numerical n - body simulations using the hypothesis of ccdm and the astrophysical observations on the small structure of the universe  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ccdm simulations  @xcite predict cuspy profiles in the center regions of galaxies , which conflict with flatten cores found in our milky way ( mw )  @xcite , other nearby dwarfs  @xcite , and low luminous galaxies  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there are additional puzzles concerning the sizes of subhalos . </S>",
    "<S> the observed mw satellites are hosted by much less massive subhalos compared to sizes of the most massive subhalos arising from simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the absence of such massive dm subhalos is referred to as the `` too big to fail '' problem in the galaxy formation . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of sidm ( in particular those involving the characteristic velocity - dependence cross sections  @xcite ) is one of the solutions to alleviate these inconsistencies .         in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate the thermal energy transport between the trapped dm and the nuclei in the sun , as well as the energy flows due to dm captures . with dm self - interactions taken into account </S>",
    "<S> , the dm number trapped in the sun evolves according to @xmath1 while the energy flows in and out of the system of trapped dm in the sun are governed by @xmath2 the coefficients @xmath3 are referred to as the dm capture rates due to dm - nucleon scattering cross section @xmath0 and dm - dm scattering cross section @xmath4 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the coefficient @xmath5 is related to dm annihilation rate in the sun . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we shall focus on the self - interaction dominant scenario with @xmath6  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the left hand side of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ thermaltransport ] ) is the total kinetic energy of the trapped dm with @xmath7 the average kinetic energy of an individual dm . </S>",
    "<S> the factors @xmath8 are thermal transport coefficients corresponding to coefficients @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the coefficient @xmath12 describes the heat exchange between trapped dm and the nuclei in the sun . </S>",
    "<S> we do not concern the mass range where dm evaporation rate is significant . in this case , the dm abundance in the sun is severely reduced so that the signal strength of dm annihilation is suppressed .    </S>",
    "<S> since we aim at studying the temperature evolution of the trapped dm , it is important to compare mean collision time between a pair of trapped dms and that between a trapped dm and nucleus in the sun . </S>",
    "<S> we make the comparison for the cases of spin - independent ( si ) and spin - dependent ( sd ) dm - nuclei scattering cross sections , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we first note that the mean collision time between two dms in the sun is @xmath13 while the mean collision time between dm and nucleus in the sun is @xmath14 for the case of spin - independent cross section with @xmath15 the solar volume , @xmath16 the average velocity of trapped dms , @xmath17 the number of nucleus @xmath18 in the sun , and @xmath19 the spin - independent dm - nucleus scattering cross section . </S>",
    "<S> we neglect possible numerical factors on the right hand side of eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ collision : dm_dm ] ) and ( [ collision : dm_nuclei ] ) for this order of magnitude estimation . </S>",
    "<S> the time scale @xmath20 for dms in the sun to reach thermal equilibrium can be estimated by the condition @xmath21 . to solve this approximated equation , we first assume that @xmath22 is still far from the maximal value of @xmath23 and verify this assumption later . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , one can show that @xmath24 for @xmath6 . with this input , we obtain @xmath25 .    for further discussions , we shall take @xmath26 gev as a benchmark . </S>",
    "<S> for such a dm mass , we have @xmath27 by assuming isospin invariant dm - nucleon couplings . </S>",
    "<S> hence we may write @xmath28 . to simplify this relation further </S>",
    "<S> , we note that the average mass density of hydrogen in the sun is roughly @xmath29 g/@xmath30 . in other words , @xmath31 given the volume of the sun approximately at @xmath32 @xmath30 . using this value of @xmath33 and the relation @xmath34 with @xmath35 and @xmath36 km / s , </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> we are interested in the parameter range that gives @xmath38 , i.e. , @xmath39 . in this case , the trapped dms reach to the thermal equilibrium among themselves before the energy exchange between the trapped dms and the surrounding nuclei becoming efficient . besides the condition @xmath38 , we need to ensure the ratio @xmath40 is much greater than unity for the consistency of our argument . </S>",
    "<S> the cross section combination @xmath41 is an example of satisfying both @xmath38 and @xmath42 . with these parameters </S>",
    "<S> , we have @xmath43 s , which is much shorter than the age of the sun , @xmath44 s. for spin - dependent cross section , we found @xmath45 and @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath47 , the slightly different cross section combination @xmath48 gives the same @xmath20 as the previous spin - independent case .    </S>",
    "<S> the above discussions justify the thermal equilibrium state of dm in the early stage of capture for certain combinations of @xmath0 and @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we can write @xmath49 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ thermaltransport ] ) where @xmath50 is the degree of freedom of each dm . </S>",
    "<S> we recapitulate the meaning of various coefficients in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ thermaltransport ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the coefficient @xmath51 describes the energy flow due to dm capture caused by dm - nucleus scattering , @xmath52 describes the energy exchange between dms and nuclei , @xmath53 is related to the energy flow due to dm capture caused by dm self - interaction , and @xmath54 is related to the energy dissipation due to dm annihilation . </S>",
    "<S> all the quantities are positive except @xmath52 which depends on the difference between the solar core temperature @xmath55 and the dm temperature @xmath56 . in particular , @xmath57 when @xmath58 .    </S>",
    "<S> when the sun sweeps across the mw halo , there are collisions between dm and the solar nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> if the dm velocity is smaller than the solar escape velocity after the collision , the dm will be gravitationally bounded within the sun . </S>",
    "<S> the velocity of an infalling dm at the shell with radius @xmath59 inside the sun is @xmath60 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath61 is the dm velocity in the halo and @xmath62 is the solar escape velocity at such shell . the kinetic energy of the trapped dm with an average over the energy loss in the capture process is given by @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the dm mass and @xmath65 is the mass of nuclei a. we have @xmath66 if it is due to dm - dm scattering , i.e. , @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the collisions among dms redistribute the dm kinetic energies such that the average dm kinetic energy becomes @xmath7 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ thermaltransport ] ) when the thermal equilibrium is reached . </S>",
    "<S> the relation between @xmath68 and @xmath7 will be discussed later . the energy flow per shell volume is @xmath69\\bar{e}du~,\\label{eq : dlc / dv}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the nuclei number density and the dm - nuclei cross section , respectively . the dm velocity in the halo </S>",
    "<S> is assumed to follow maxwell - boltzmann distribution , i.e. , @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 with @xmath75 the dm dispersion velocity in the halo and @xmath76 the relative velocity between the sun and the mw . </S>",
    "<S> the density @xmath77 is the dm local density taken to be @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> the dm capture by sun s nuclei gives @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the number fraction of nuclei @xmath81 in the sun and @xmath82 is the average gravitational potential square contributed by nuclei a. the quantity @xmath83 is given by @xmath84 similarly , the energy flow due to self - capture @xmath53 can be derived by making the replacements @xmath85 and @xmath86 ( @xmath87 is the dm number density in the sun ) . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath88 since dms are populated within a spherical region with a radius @xmath89 , we can take @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the average gravitational potential of the dm .    </S>",
    "<S> the energy of captured dm could be dissipated due to annihilation . </S>",
    "<S> the energy flow due to this process is @xmath92 with @xmath93 the thermally - averaged dm annihilation cross section . </S>",
    "<S> numerically , we have @xmath94 where @xmath50 is the degree of freedom of each dm </S>",
    "<S> . we shall take @xmath95 for the numerical analysis later .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , the captured dms continuously exchange energies with the solar nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> the energy transport due to collisions between single dm and the surrounding nuclei in the sun is given by  @xcite @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the core density of the sun , @xmath98 is the mass fraction of nuclei a. we note that the above relation is derived by taking @xmath95 .        </S>",
    "<S> we have numerically solved eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : n_evol ] ) and ( [ thermaltransport ] ) . both equations run from @xmath99 s , which is roughly the time scale for dms in the sun to thermalize according to our earlier arguments . as a first approximation </S>",
    "<S> , the initial condition for @xmath7 at @xmath99 s is taken to be @xmath68 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ebar ] ) with @xmath100 and @xmath59 averaged . </S>",
    "<S> we point out that @xmath68 is the dm average kinetic energy before the thermalization . when dms reach to the thermal equilibrium , they are populated more closely to the solar core . </S>",
    "<S> hence one expects @xmath101 by the conservation of mechanical energy , since the gravitational potential energy of the thermalized dm is in general smaller than that of dm before thermalization . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless @xmath102 and @xmath68 differ within a factor of two , and in fact the dm temperature in the current epoch is independent of @xmath102 as we shall argue later .    </S>",
    "<S> the evolutions of dm number and dm temperature are presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ temperature ] . </S>",
    "<S> we take @xmath103 and @xmath104 for @xmath105 gev , respectively as the benchmark points . </S>",
    "<S> it is clearly seen that @xmath23 at @xmath106 s is indeed far below the maximal @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> this justifies our assumption earlier for deriving @xmath107 . </S>",
    "<S> we also see that the dm accumulation is enhanced by dm self interactions . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the @xmath108 enhancement is more significant for smaller @xmath64 and it is very sensitive to the ratio @xmath109 .    </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ temperature ] shows that dm temperature is higher than the temperature of solar core in the early stage for different dm masses . the dm temperature @xmath110 drops with time due to energy flow from dms to solar nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> however , @xmath110 is not always approaching to @xmath111 . </S>",
    "<S> those cases with @xmath112 show such a behavior . </S>",
    "<S> particularly , @xmath113 for @xmath114 and @xmath115 gev in the current epoch . </S>",
    "<S> we note that @xmath116 caused by the dm annihilation does not affect the dm temperature . </S>",
    "<S> hence dm temperature evolution is controlled by parameters @xmath117 , @xmath9 , @xmath118 , @xmath10 and @xmath12 . however , as @xmath23 accumulates , the effect by @xmath117 and @xmath9 become negligible . </S>",
    "<S> we thus have @xmath119 we observe that @xmath7 or @xmath120 approaches to a constant value when the right hand side of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dm_temp ] ) vanishes . </S>",
    "<S> this implies @xmath121 , i.e. , @xmath122 , if the self - interaction induced coefficients @xmath118 and @xmath10 are negligible . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , @xmath56 does not approach to @xmath111 if dm self - interaction can not be neglected . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the gap between @xmath56 and @xmath111 increases for heavier dm . </S>",
    "<S> this is because @xmath12 scales as @xmath123for heavy dm . </S>",
    "<S> thus , to balance @xmath124 , @xmath125 must be enhanced to compensate the @xmath123 suppression in @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the dm temperature @xmath56 in the current epoch is fixed once the values for @xmath4 , @xmath0 and @xmath64 are given . essentially , @xmath126 is the solution to @xmath127 with @xmath12 the function of @xmath0 , @xmath64 and @xmath7 , and both @xmath118 and @xmath10 the functions of @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> clearly the initial condition @xmath102 does not affect @xmath126 . </S>",
    "<S> indeed we have varied @xmath102 within a reasonable range in our numerical analysis and found that @xmath7 ( @xmath120 ) approaches to the same fixed point .    </S>",
    "<S> we remark that the thermal equilibrium time scale @xmath20 , which we choose as @xmath128 , is obtained by a rough estimation . to study the effect from such an uncertainty </S>",
    "<S> , we also solve eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : n_evol ] ) and ( [ thermaltransport ] ) with @xmath129 s. we find that @xmath126 remains the same .    </S>",
    "<S> it is important to note that @xmath23 depends on the dm temperature @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the dependence of @xmath23 on @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> hence the indirect detection signal could also be sensitive to @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the annihilate rate @xmath130 calculated with precise @xmath56 with that computed with the assumption @xmath131 . </S>",
    "<S> the result is presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ annihilation ] . </S>",
    "<S> dm temperature affects both @xmath23 and @xmath11 in @xmath132 . with @xmath133 </S>",
    "<S> , we have @xmath134 because @xmath135 @xcite . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , we can easily see that @xmath136 from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : n_evol ] ) . as long as the enhancement on @xmath137 can overwhelm the suppression on @xmath11 , the annihilation rate @xmath132 </S>",
    "<S> would be enhanced by adopting the precise dm temperature @xmath56 . in the limit @xmath6 , @xmath138 when @xmath23 in the sun reaches to the maximum . </S>",
    "<S> one has @xmath139 as a result . </S>",
    "<S> this is seen from the right panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ annihilation ] with @xmath112 and @xmath114 . </S>",
    "<S> however , with @xmath140 and @xmath0 kept the same , @xmath23 is still growing , i.e. , @xmath141 . </S>",
    "<S> hence @xmath142 , which implies @xmath143 . </S>",
    "<S> we presented such a scenario in the right panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ annihilation ] as well .    </S>",
    "<S> we have taken the sun as an example to illustrate the possible temperature difference between dms and their surrounding medium . </S>",
    "<S> we stress that the derivation in this paper is generally applicable to other massive celestial objects . </S>",
    "<S> the only required information is the dm dispersion velocity , the dm local density , and physical properties of the celestial object . in summary , we have derived and solved the thermal transport equation for dms trapped in the sun for the first time . in the sidm scenario , the dm temperature and the core temperature of the sun could be different . we have shown that dm annihilation rate is sensitive to the dm temperature . hence it is imperative to adopt the precise dm temperature to calculate the indirect dm event rates . </S>"
