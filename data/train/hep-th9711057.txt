    "the low - lying eigenvalues of the qcd dirac operator are of great importance for the understanding of the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in qcd . in euclidean space",
    ", the dirac operator reads @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the coupling constant , @xmath2 are the generators of su(@xmath3)-color , and @xmath4 are the gauge fields .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalue equation is @xmath5 with real eigenvalues @xmath6 . because the dirac operator anticommutes with @xmath7",
    ", the eigenvalues either occur in pairs @xmath8 or are zero .",
    "let @xmath9 be the eigenvalue density of the dirac operator averaged over gauge field configurations .",
    "the banks - casher formula , @xmath10 @xcite , relates the order parameter of chiral symmetry breaking , @xmath11 , to the density of eigenvalues of the dirac operator near zero virtuality .",
    "here , it is essential that the thermodynamic limit be taken before the chiral limit .",
    "note also that @xmath12 is normalized to the space - time volume @xmath13 . in the real world",
    "chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken and @xmath14 .",
    "this implies that the low - lying dirac eigenvalues must be spaced like @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , it is natural to magnify this region of the spectrum by a factor of @xmath13 .",
    "this was first suggested by shuryak and verbaarschot @xcite who introduced the so - called microscopic spectral density defined by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the absolute value of the chiral condensate . based on an analysis of sum rules derived by leutwyler and smilga @xcite for the inverse powers of the dirac eigenvalues in a finite volume , shuryak and verbaarschot conjectured that the microscopic spectral density should be a universal quantity which depends only on global symmetries , the number of flavors @xmath18 , and the topological charge @xmath19 .",
    "what is the meaning of universality in this statement ? in principle , one could compute @xmath20 directly from full qcd . in practice ,",
    "of course , the complexity of the qcd lagrangian makes this impossible .",
    "however , if @xmath20 is universal , one can try to compute it in another theory which is simpler than qcd but has the same symmetries . the simplest theory in which such a calculation is possible is random - matrix theory ( rmt ) . whether the results obtained in rmt correctly describe the microscopic spectrum of full qcd is a question that can only be answered by empirical evidence , most importantly by large - scale lattice qcd simulations .",
    "let us briefly recall how a chiral random - matrix model is constructed . in a chiral basis in euclidean space , the dirac operator has a block structure since it only couples states of opposite chirality . in rmt ,",
    "the matrix of the dirac operator is replaced by a random matrix @xmath21 with suitable symmetry properties , @xmath22\\to    \\left[\\matrix{im&w\\cr w^\\dagger&im}\\right]\\:,\\ ] ] where we have also added a quark mass @xmath23 .",
    "if @xmath21 has @xmath24 rows and @xmath3 columns , then the dirac matrix in ( [ eq1.2 ] ) ( without the mass term ) has @xmath3 positive and @xmath3 negative eigenvalues , respectively , and @xmath19 zero modes ( we assume @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) .",
    "we can identify @xmath19 with the topological charge and @xmath27 with the volume @xmath13 . in full qcd with @xmath18 flavors , the weight function used in averaging over gauge field configurations contains the gluonic action in the form @xmath28 and @xmath18 fermion determinants . in the random - matrix model , the gluonic part of the weight function is replaced by a convenient distribution of the random matrix @xmath21 , usually a gaussian distribution of the individual matrix elements ( which are uncorrelated ) . since the fermion determinants can be expressed as products over the dirac eigenvalues they can also be taken into account in the random - matrix model .",
    "the symmetries of @xmath21 are determined by the anti - unitary symmetries of the dirac operator .",
    "they were classified by verbaarschot in ref .",
    "@xcite . depending on the number of colors and the representation of the fermions the matrix elements of @xmath21 are real , complex , or quaternion real .",
    "the corresponding random - matrix ensembles are called chiral gaussian orthogonal ( chgoe ) , unitary ( chgue ) , and symplectic ( chgse ) ensemble , respectively .",
    "the microscopic spectral density has been computed analytically in all three ensembles for all @xmath18 and @xmath19 in the chiral limit @xcite .",
    "evidence in support of the conjecture that @xmath20 is a universal function has been accumulated in a number of recent studies which we list here .",
    "the moments of @xmath20 generate the leutwyler - smilga sum rules @xcite .",
    "the result for @xmath20 is insensitive to the probability distribution of the random matrix @xcite .",
    "lattice data for the valence quark mass dependence of the chiral condensate could be understood using the analytical expression for @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the functional form of @xmath20 does not change at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "the analytical result for @xmath20 is found in the hofstadter model for universal conductance fluctuations @xcite .",
    "for an instanton liquid , @xmath20 shows quite good agreement with the random - matrix result @xcite .",
    "recently , a high - statistics lattice calculation directly demonstrated agreement between the random - matrix results and lattice data , not only for @xmath20 but also for the distribution of the smallest eigenvalue and for the microscopic spectral two - point correlator @xcite .",
    "( this study was done for gauge group su(2 ) with staggered fermions in the quenched approximation . )",
    "we believe that the universality of @xmath20 is now firmly established .",
    "one of the most interesting and most important problems of present - day lattice simulations is the inclusion of dynamical fermions .",
    "this is essential for a realistic description of hadronic properties .",
    "unfortunately , it is computationally expensive to include the fermion determinants in a monte - carlo simulation .",
    "moreover , the computational cost increases with lower quark mass , thus it is extremely difficult to take the chiral limit on the lattice . any analytical insight into the distribution of the dirac eigenvalues in the presence of massive dynamical quarks",
    "will therefore be helpful .",
    "it is the purpose of this work to extend the random - matrix results obtained in the chiral limit to the general case of massive quarks to be able to compare with actual lattice calculations .",
    "this issue was first discussed in ref .",
    "the most interesting case of qcd with 3 colors and fermions in the fundamental representation corresponds to the chgue of rmt on which we concentrate here . in what range of the quark mass",
    "can we expect the random - matrix results to be in agreement with full qcd ?",
    "gasser and leutwyler @xcite have shown that in the range @xmath29 the dependence of the finite - volume qcd partition function on the quark mass @xmath23 is determined solely by global symmetries ( @xmath30 is a typical hadronic scale , @xmath31 is the linear size of the euclidean box , and @xmath32 is the pion mass ) . the partition function was computed for equal quark masses using an effective lagrangian in ref .",
    "@xcite and for the general case of different quark masses in the framework of chiral rmt in ref .",
    "the condition @xmath33 sets an upper limit of @xmath34 on the quark mass .",
    "a lower limit of @xmath35 on the quark mass is set by the requirement that the chiral condensate be non - zero in a finite volume . to obtain non - trivial results for the dependence of the various quantities we compute on @xmath23 ,",
    "the quark mass has to be rescaled by the same factor @xmath36 as the eigenvalues , cf .",

    "apart from a gaussian , this distribution contains @xmath18 fermionic determinants .",
    "eventually , we are mainly interested in the microscopic limit .",
    "hence , it suffices to take into account a gaussian in the total distribution ( [ pdf ] ) since various authors @xcite have given proofs of universality in related problems . note that even for nonzero topological charge @xmath19 it is sufficient to consider only square matrices @xmath21 in the calculation because of the duality between topology and flavor @xcite .",

    "we have computed the microscopic spectrum of the massive qcd dirac operator , including the microscopic spectral density and the distribution of the smallest eigenvalue , for an arbitrary number of flavors , arbitrary quark masses , and arbitrary topological charge .",
    "our results generalize the previously known results for the microscopic correlations in the chiral limit @xcite .",
    "the distribution of the smallest eigenvalue was previously known only in the quenched approximation . wherever there is an overlap",
    ", our results agree with those obtained in the recent preprint by damgaard and nishigaki @xcite . it would be very interesting to obtain the result ( [ darmnij ] ) using the supersymmetry method as in refs .",
    "work in this direction is in progress .",
    "the quantities we have computed in this paper are conjectured to be universal , i.e. , identical to those of qcd , for quark masses of the order of @xmath196 .",
    "this conjecture can be verified straightforwardly in lattice calculations .",
    "one computes the eigenvalues of the dirac matrix and constructs the microscopic spectral density and the distribution of the smallest eigenvalue by averaging over a sufficient number of independent gauge field configurations .",
    "the lattice data can then be compared to the analytical predictions of rmt . for pure su(2 ) gauge theory without dynamical quarks ,",
    "this was already done in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the agreement was excellent .",
    "our present calculation applies to full qcd with 3 colors in the continuum limit . in the context of lattice qcd",
    ", it applies to su(3 ) with dynamical staggered fermions .",
    "the necessary lattice algorithms are available , e.g. , the hybrid monte - carlo algorithm for generating unquenched configurations and the lanczos algorithm for computing eigenvalues of large sparse matrices .",
    "therefore , we are confident that the results obtained in this paper will be verified in the very near future .    given that the analytical results obtained in this paper really describe qcd , one may ask what their relevance is in practice .",
    "we list here a few possible applications .",
    "( i ) the parameter which appears in the microscopic quantities contains the absolute value of the chiral condensate , @xmath17 . as we have already seen in quenched su(2 ) @xcite , the analytical information available from rmt can be used to determine @xmath17 and to extract its thermodynamic limit from very small lattices .",
    "since otherwise one would have to perform an extrapolation , this seems to offer an interesting technological advantage .",
    "( ii ) lattice simulations with light dynamical quarks are very expensive , and extrapolations to the chiral limit are difficult . in rmt , we have computed exact analytical expressions which apply for very small quark masses , and the chiral limit can be taken analytically . one would , therefore , hope that lattice practitioners can use the analytical information in their extrapolations to the chiral limit for those quantities that depend on the small eigenvalues .",
    "( iii ) a very interesting issue is topology .",
    "as one approaches the continuum limit on the lattice , one expects zero modes to appear which give rise to non - zero topological charge @xmath19 .",
    "the microscopic quantities we consider are sensitive to topology , and we have computed them for arbitrary @xmath19 . hence , one can analyze lattice results in different sectors of topological charge .",
    "whether or not topology is seen on present - day lattices is still a somewhat controversial issue , and for quenched su(2 ) the lattice results of ref .",
    "@xcite were consistent with @xmath161 .",
    "we hope that our results will prove useful in future analyses of topology .",
    "( iv ) the performance of many lattice algorithms depends on the magnitude of the smallest eigenvalue .",
    "while rmt can not predict this magnitude , it predicts the distribution of @xmath185 over the ensemble of gauge field configurations . it would be interesting to see if experts in algorithm development can make use of the analytical information available from rmt",
