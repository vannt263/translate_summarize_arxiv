    "smooth convex billiards , in which a point particle moves uniformly until it undergoes abrupt elastic collisions with a smooth strictly convex hypersurface @xmath5 , are one of the typical examples of conservative systems with both regular and chaotic dynamics .",
    "the 2d case ( @xmath6 ) was introduced by birkhoff@xcite and there is an extensive literature about it .",
    "the high - dimensional case remains much less studied , although we highlight two known results .",
    "first , there exists a nekhoroshev - like theorem for billiards .",
    "@xcite second , there are some general lower bounds on the number of periodic billiard trajectories .",
    "@xcite of course , these lower bounds are not informative for integrable systems , where periodic trajectories are organized in continuous families .",
    "ellipsoids are the only known examples of smooth strictly convex closed hypersurfaces of the euclidean space @xmath7 that give rise to integrable billiards .",
    "there is a larger class of integrable billiards , called _ liouville billiard tables _ , but in none of the new integrable billiards the point particle follows straight lines between two consecutive impacts ; instead it moves on the geodesics of some smooth compact connected riemannian manifold with boundary.@xcite    in fact , an old conjecture atributed to birkhoff states : ellipsoids are the only smooth strictly convex closed hypersurfaces of @xmath0 that give rise to integrable billiards .",
    "the conjecture remains still unproven , but berger@xcite and gruber@xcite proved that only ellipsoids have smooth caustics when @xmath8 , which is a powerful argument for the conjecture .",
    "a smooth _ caustic _ is a smooth hypersurface with the property that a billiard trajectory , once tangent to it , stays tangent after every reflection .",
    "periodic trajectories ( pts ) are the most distinctive trajectories , so their study is the first task .",
    "there exist two remarkable results about pts inside ellipsoids : _ poncelet theorem _ and _ cayley conditions_. poncelet@xcite showed that if a billiard trajectory inside an ellipse is periodic , then all the trajectories sharing its conic caustic are also periodic .",
    "cayley@xcite gave some algebraic conditions for determining conic caustics whose trajectories are periodic .",
    "later on , both results were generalized to any dimension .",
    "@xcite    almost all papers on billiards inside ellipsoids follow an algebro - geometric approach to the problem.@xcite a more dynamical approach to billiards inside ellipsoids has recently been considered in refs .  .",
    "we follow that approach , in which the description of the dynamics is more important than the obtaining of explicit formulae . indeed ,",
    "this paper is a natural continuation of the study on ( minimal ) periodic trajectories carried out in ref .  .",
    "in the framework of smooth convex billiards the minimal period is always two .",
    "nevertheless , since all two - periodic billiard trajectories inside ellipsoids are singular in the sense that some of their caustics are singular elements of a family of confocal quadrics , two questions arise : which is the minimal period among nonsingular billiard trajectories ? which ellipsoids display such trajectories ?",
    "the authors settled both questions in ref .  .",
    "we say that an ellipsoid of @xmath0 whose @xmath9 axis have different lengths ( i.e. , an ellipsoid without any symmetry of revolution ) is _",
    "nondegenerate_. our current goal is to classify nonsingular symmetric periodic trajectories ( spts ) inside nondegenerate ellipsoids .",
    "we also look for minimal spts representatives of each class with the smallest possible period .",
    "the relevance of the spts relies in three facts .",
    "first , they persist under small enough symmetric perturbations of a nondegenerate ellipsoid .",
    "second , each perturbed spt can be computed by solving a nonlinear equation for which the corresponding unperturbed spt is a good initial approximation .",
    "third , this nonlinear equation is @xmath10-dimensional , not @xmath11-dimensional .",
    "that is , the dimension of the problem can be halved .",
    "these properties greatly simplify the numerical computation of spts inside symmetrically perturbed ellipsoids , which is our next aim . to be more precise",
    ", we plan to study the stability and bifurcations of perturbed spts , as a way to gain some insight into the transition from integrability to chaos in high - dimensional smooth convex billiard problems .    roughly speaking , a symmetric trajectory ( st ) inside @xmath12 is a billiard trajectory invariant under a orthogonal reflection , with respect to some of the @xmath13 coordinate proper subspaces of the euclidean space @xmath0 .",
    "for instance , the left trajectory in fig .",
    "[ fig : twoamazingspts_3d ] is invariant under the @xmath14-axial and @xmath15-specular reflections , whereas the right one is invariant under the @xmath16-axial reflection . there are twice as many `` billiard symmetries '' as coordinate proper subspaces of @xmath17 .",
    "this is easily understood by means of the following example .",
    "we can associate two different kinds of spts to any coordinate axis of @xmath17 ; namely , the ones with an impact point on the axis and the ones with a segment parallel to the axis .",
    "note that the left spt in fig .",
    "[ fig : twoamazingspts_3d ] has an impact point on the @xmath14-axis and so , it is invariant under the @xmath14-axial reflection , but also has a segment parallel to the @xmath16-axis and so , it is invariant under the @xmath15-specular reflection . we will check that this kind of double symmetry is the norm among spts , not the exception .    in view of the above arguments it is easy to guess that there is a rich casuistry of spts inside nondegenerate ellipsoids of @xmath17 , so much so that there is no simple way to describe them . for simplicity ,",
    "let us briefly consider the 3d case : @xmath18 .",
    "then , any billiard trajectory inside @xmath19 has two caustics of the form @xmath20 let us assume that @xmath21 .",
    "we restrict our attention to nonsingular trajectories .",
    "that is , trajectories whose caustics are ellipsoids : @xmath22 ; 1-sheet hyperboloids : @xmath23 ; or 2-sheet hyperboloids : @xmath24 .",
    "the singular values @xmath25 , are discarded .",
    "it is known that there are only four types of couples of nonsingular caustics : eh1 , h1h1 , eh2 , and h1h2 .",
    "the notation is self - explanatory .",
    "it is also known that each caustic type gives rise to a different billiard dynamics .",
    "for instance , only trajectories with eh2-caustics rotate around the @xmath26-axis . the left trajectory in fig .",
    "[ fig : twoamazingspts_3d ] is a sample .",
    "coming back to the general case , its billiard trajectories present @xmath27 different caustic types , which describe how trajectories fold in @xmath17 ; see ref .  .",
    "then , we classify spts inside nondegenerate ellipsoids of @xmath17 by their caustic types and their symmetries .",
    "that is , two spts with the same symmetries , but different caustic type , are in different classes . on the one hand ,",
    "not every symmetry takes place among spts of a given caustic type , but only @xmath28 . on the other hand ,",
    "all spts are , in some sense , doubly symmetric , which rise to @xmath29 classes we may encounter with a given caustic type .",
    "consequently , we know that there are at most @xmath30 classes of spts . finally , by means of an argument involving _ winding numbers _ , we establish the existence of spts for all those classes .",
    "that concludes the analytical part of the work . we have also implemented a numerical algorithm to find minimal spts of each of the 12 classes in the 2d case , and each of the 112 classes in the 3d case .",
    "they have periods 3 , 4 or 6 in the 2d case ; and 4 , 5 , 6 , 8 or 10 in the 3d case .",
    "we depict all 2d minimal spts in table  [ tab : spts_2d ] , and just a gallery ( for brevity of exposition ) of 3d minimal spts in sec .",
    "[ sec:3d ] .",
    "for instance , we show in fig .  [",
    "fig : twoamazingspts_3d ] two minimal spts of period 6 , but with only 5 and 4 different impact points .",
    "only the second phenomena can take place in the 2d case .",
    "this has to do with the fact that , from a generic point on the ellipsoid , we can trace four lines tangent to a fixed couple of caustics . on the contrary , we can trace just two in the 2d case .",
    "some of the ideas used in this paper were first introduced by kook and meiss,@xcite to classify symmetric periodic orbits of some standard - like reversible @xmath31-dimensional symplectic maps .",
    "the technical details of our problem are harder there are more symmetries , caustic types play a role , and the classification does not depend only on the evenness or oddness of some integers , but the main arguments do not change .    some of our billiard spts could be considered as discrete versions of the closed geodesics on triaxial ellipsoids found in ref .  .",
    "for instance , it is interesting to compare the spt on the left side of fig .",
    "[ fig : twoamazingspts_3d ] with the symmetric closed geodesic shown in fig .",
    "4 of that paper .",

    "in this section we state the concept of symmetric periodic orbit for a map .",
    "a map is reversible if each orbit is related to its time reverse orbit by a symmetry transformation .",
    "reversible maps can be characterized as maps that factorize as the composition of two involutions .",
    "symmetric orbits must have points on certain symmetry sets ; namely , the fixed sets of the involutions ( reversors ) which factorize the original map",
    ". a reversible map can have different factorizations and , therefore , its symmetric orbits can be classified according to the symmetry sets they intersect .",

    "[ rem : symmetryreversor]the composition of a symmetry and a reversor ( provided both commute ) is another reversor .    if @xmath41 is a reversor , we denote by @xmath42 its set of fixed points , which is called the symmetry set of the reversor .",
    "an orbit of the map @xmath34 is a sequence @xmath43 such that @xmath44 .",
    "an orbit @xmath45 of a @xmath41-reversible map @xmath34 is called @xmath41-symmetric when @xmath46 .",
    "the following characterization of reversible maps goes back to g. d. birkhoff .",
    "[ lem : reversiblemaps]a map @xmath34 is reversible if and only if it can be factorized as the composition of two involutions , in which case both of them are reversors of @xmath34 .",

    "nevertheless , these new factorizations do not provide new symmetric orbits , because @xmath62 , i.e. , an orbit is invariant under @xmath47 ( or @xmath56 ) if and only if it is invariant under all the reversors @xmath63 and @xmath64 . on the contrary , the existence of a symmetry @xmath38 commuting with the reversors @xmath47 and @xmath56 is more promising , because then @xmath65 is a new factorization , which could give rise to new kinds of symmetric orbits .",
