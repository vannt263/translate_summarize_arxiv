    "a motion of @xmath1 robots is a one - parameter family of @xmath1-tuples in a graph @xmath3 that are pairwise distinct , that is , a path in the configuration space of @xmath3 which is the complement of diagonals in the @xmath1-fold product @xmath4 .",
    "the graph @xmath1-braid group over @xmath3 is , roughly speaking , the group of these motions under concatenation , and is more precisely the fundamental group of the ( unordered ) configuration space .    on the other hand , a _",
    "right - angled artin group _ is a group that has a finite presentation each of whose relators is a commutator of generators .",
    "it was sometimes called a _ graph group _ since its presentation can be defined via a graph whose vertices are generators and each of whose edges gives a relator that is the commutator of two ends . the survey article @xcite by charney contains a good overview .",
    "graph braid groups that can be computed directly by hand usually have presentations whose relators are all in the form of a commutator that is not however necessarily a commutator of generators . in fact , all of graph braid groups were presumed to be right - angled artin groups until it was known by abrams and ghrist in @xcite that the pure 2-braid groups of the complete graph @xmath5 and the complete bipartite graph @xmath6 are surface groups so they are not right - angled artin groups . since then , it was a reasonable conjecture that every planar - graph braid group is a right - angled artin group .",
    "connelly and doig in @xcite proved that every linear - tree braid group is a right - angled artin group where a tree is linear if it does not contain @xmath7 in figure  [ fig1](a ) .",
    "meanwhile , crisp and wiest in @xcite proved that every graph braid group embeds in a right - angled artin group .",
    "conversely , sabalka in @xcite proved that every right - angled artin group can be realized as a subgroup of a graph braid group .",
    "farley and sabalka in @xcite described an efficient method to obtain a presentation for any graph braid group using the discrete morse theory .",
    "recently , farley and sabalka in @xcite characterized trees whose braid groups are right - angled artin groups .",
    "they proved that for braid indices 2 or 3 , tree braid groups are always right - angled artin groups , and for braid index @xmath8 , a braid group over a given tree is a right - angled artin group if and only if the tree does not contain @xmath7 . in this article , this result is generalized to arbitrary graphs for braid index @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , we will prove the following two theorems :    if a graph @xmath3 contains neither @xmath7 nor @xmath9 in figure  [ fig1 ] , then the graph @xmath1-braid group @xmath10 is a right - angled artin group for braid index @xmath11 .",
    "if a graph @xmath3 contains @xmath7 or @xmath9 in figure  [ fig1 ] , then the graph @xmath1-braid group @xmath10 is not a right - angled artin group for braid index @xmath11 .",
    "[ fig1 ]    this paper is organized as follows . in  2 ,",
    "we explain how to simplify configuration spaces using the discrete morse theory .",
    "basic constructions and notations introduced will be used throughout the article . as applications ,",
    "we obtain a presentation of @xmath10 for any graph @xmath3 containing neither @xmath7 nor @xmath9 and prove theorem  a.    for graphs @xmath3 and @xmath12 and @xmath13 , suppose that there is an embedding @xmath14 of graphs that induces a surjection @xmath15 of cohomology algebras whose kernel is generated by homogeneous classes of degree 1 and 2 , and moreover , suppose that @xmath16 is not a right - angled artin group . then by combining results by charney - davis @xcite and by farley - sabalka @xcite , one can conclude that @xmath10 is not a right - angled artin group either .",
    "this argument was introduced by farley and sabalka in @xcite to show that an @xmath1-braid group over a tree containing @xmath7 is not a right - angled artin group for @xmath17 .",
    "one of hypotheses of this argument does not hold if there is no embedding @xmath14 inducing an injection @xmath18 . furthermore",
    ", if @xmath12 has no vertices of valency 1 , there is no room to accommodate extra punctures when we construct an embedding @xmath14 to obtain some result for @xmath10 for all braid index @xmath11 . in  3 , we circumvent these difficulties by dividing the class of graphs containing @xmath7 but not @xmath9 into smaller classes , for each of which the above argument is applicable .",
    "so theorem  b is proved for a graph @xmath3 that contains @xmath7 but not @xmath9 .    given a finite presentation of a group @xmath19 ,",
    "let @xmath20 be the free group over generators and @xmath21 be the normal subgroup generated by relators .",
    "suppose @xmath22 $ ] .",
    "then the inclusion induces a homomorphism @xmath23\\to [ f , f]/[f,[f , f]]$ ] which can be regarded as the dual of the cup product @xmath24 according to matei - suciu @xcite . in  4 ,",
    "we derive and use a number of necessary conditions  for @xmath19 to be a right - angled artin group .",
    "for example , if @xmath19 is a right - angled artin group , @xmath25 is injective , which we employ for showing that @xmath26 and @xmath27 are not a right - angled artin group where @xmath28 is the graph of the figurative shape @xmath28 .",
    "if @xmath19 is a right - angled artin group , the cohomology ring @xmath29 is completely determined by @xmath25 and @xmath30 , and this fact also provides a useful obstruction for @xmath19 to be a right - angled artin group .",
    "a more sophisticated application of this idea is to consider homomorphism @xmath31\\to r/[f , r]$ ] and @xmath32/[f',[f',f']]\\to [ f , f]/[f,[f , f]]$ ] induced from an embedding @xmath33 .",
    "here we assume that @xmath22 $ ] and @xmath34 $ ] for @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "if we can directly show from their configuration spaces that @xmath37 is not injective and @xmath38 is injective , then the commutativity @xmath39 implies that @xmath40 is not injective and so @xmath10 is not a right - angled artin group . using this argument , we prove theorem  b for a planar graph @xmath3 containing @xmath9 .",
    "for non - planar graphs , we prove theorem  b by showing that the first homology of its braid group has a 2-torsion .",
    "we conclude the paper with four conjectures .",
    "two of them are about extending our main results in this paper to graph braid groups of braid index @xmath2 .",
    "the other two conjectures are characterizations of planar graphs via graph braid groups .",
    "one is that graph braid groups of planar graphs are commutator - related and the other is that the first homology groups of their graph braid groups are torsion - free . as mentioned above , a given graph must be planar if the first homology of its graph braid group is torsion - free .",
    "finally we prove the converse when the braid index is 2 .",

    "we study the following alternative .",
    "we now regard a graph @xmath3 as a 1-dimensional cw complex .",
    "then the @xmath1-fold cartesian product @xmath4 of @xmath3 has a cw complex structure and a cell in @xmath4 has the form @xmath47 where each @xmath48 is either a vertex or an edge of @xmath3 .",

    "abrams conjectured the version that there are at least @xmath58 edges in the condition ( 1 ) instead of @xmath57 edges .",
    "he also observed that the statement is false if there are fewer than @xmath58 edges .",
    "for the sake of completeness , we will prove the conjecture in theorem  [ thm : homotopy equiv ] .",
