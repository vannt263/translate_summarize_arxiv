    "minimal kinetic models for the boltzmann equation , i.e. lattice boltzmann equation formulations , are evolving towards as alternative physically - inspired computational techniques for various fluid mechanics and other problems .",
    "originally developed as an improved variant of the lattice gas automata  @xcite to eliminate statistical noise  @xcite , the lattice boltzmann method ( lbm ) has undergone a series of major refinements , in terms of its underlying physical models as well as numerical solution schemes for various applications over the last two decades  @xcite . in particular , its rigorous connection to the kinetic theory  @xcite has resulted in a number of recent developments , including models that are more physically consistent for multiphase  @xcite and multicomponent flows  @xcite , models for non - equilibrium phenomena beyond the navier - stokes - fourier representation  @xcite and an asymptotic analysis approach to establish consistency of the lbm from a numerical point of view  @xcite .",
    "the stream - and - collide procedure of the lbm can be considered as a dramatically simplified discrete representation of the continuous boltzmann equation . here",
    ", the streaming step represents the advection of the distribution of particle populations along discrete directions , which are designed from symmetry considerations , between successive collisions .",
    "much of the physical effects being modeled are represented in terms of the collision step , which also significantly influences the numerical stability of the lbm .",
    "most of the major developments until recently were associated with the single - relaxation - time ( srt ) model  @xcite based on the bgk approximation  @xcite , and enjoys its popularity owing , mainly , to its simplicity .",
    "however , it is prone to numerical instability .",
    "moreover , it is inadequate in its representation of certain physical aspects , such as independently adjustable transport properties of thermal transport and viscoelastic phenomena .",
    "these limitations have been significantly addressed in the multiple - relaxation - time ( mrt ) collision model  @xcite .",
    "this , in a sense , represents a simplified form of the relaxation lbm proposed earlier  @xcite , with an important characteristic difference in that the collision process is carried out in moment space  @xcite instead of in the usual velocity space . by separating the relaxation time scales of different moments , obtained by using a linear fourier stability analysis ,",
    "its numerical stability can be significantly improved  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has resulted in significant advantages over the srt - lbm for computation of various classes of fluid flow problems , including multiphase systems  @xcite , turbulent flows  @xcite and magnetohydrodynamics  @xcite .",
    "it may be noted that recently a different form of mrt model based on the orthogonal hermite polynomial projections of the distribution functions , which is independent of any underlying lattice structure , allowing representation of higher order non - equilibrium effects has been proposed  @xcite .",
    "the stabilization of the lbm using a single relaxation time has been addressed from a different perspective by enforcing the h - theorem locally in the collision step  @xcite . by using the attractors of the distribution function based on the minimization of a lyapunov - type functional , non - linear stability of the lbm",
    "is achieved in this entropic lbm .",
    "this approach has recently been significantly extended to incorporate multiple relaxation times with efficient implementation strategies  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , systematic procedures for different types of higher - order lbm have been developed  @xcite .",
    "an important element is the construction of higher - order lattices based on symmetry considerations which have been analyzed using group theory  @xcite .",
    "further progress , from a numerical aspect , is that based on the consistency analysis  @xcite and a notion of structural stability  @xcite ( shown related to the onsager - like relation in non - equilibrium thermodynamics  @xcite ) , convergence of the lbm to the navier - stokes equations has rigorously been shown  @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "it is important to clearly understand in what sense the lattice boltzmann equation ( lbe ) , which is generally considered as a mesoscopic approach , inherits or maintains the various physical invariance properties of the continuous full boltzmann equation ( which it represents as a much simplified model ) and the navier - stokes equations ( which it represents numerically ) .",
    "careful considerations of these aspects play an important role in ensuring the general applicability of the approach for various , especially challenging , problems . in this regard , and to put the present work in perspective , it should be noted that the continuum mechanics description as well as the microscopic statistical ( continuous boltzmann ) description of fluid motion generally satisfy a larger invariance group , with inertial frame invariance being just an important special case .",
    "the most general form among these is the so - called the principal of material frame indifference , also known as the objectivity principle  @xcite . according to this , the constitutive equations should have the same forms in _ all _ frames of reference , whether inertial or not .",
    "while this is considered as an important axiom based on which the continuum mechanics is formulated  @xcite , its role from continuous kinetic theory point of view was the subject of considerable analysis for sometime  @xcite .",
    "the following are the main outcomes of these studies : the continuous full boltzmann equation ( i ) is material frame indifferent in a _ strong approximate sense _",
    ", when there is a large scale separation between the collision times and the macroscopic flow times  @xcite ( thus providing a strong support to the axiomatic principle generally used in the continuum description ) , ( ii ) satisfies both the inertial frame or galilean invariance as well as the extended galilean invariance ( i.e. invariance under arbitrary translational accelerations of the reference frame ) _ exactly _  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it was shown that the standard procedures ( e.g. chapman - enskog expansion , maxwellian iteration ) lead to frame dependent higher order contributions for the constitutive equations in non - inertial frames in the continuum limit , while the continuous kinetic theory itself can be frame independent  @xcite . careful considerations of these principles could guide in the development of more generally applicable models and numerical schemes for complex problems .",
    "for example , material frame indifference ( point ( i ) ) is generally used as an important constraint for the constitutive equations for complex fluids ( e.g. beyond newtonian constitutive description such as polymeric fluids ) and in the development of turbulence models in continuum mechanics .",
    "as mentioned above , this property is satisfied in a strong approximate sense by the continuous boltzmann equation , but not necessarily by the tools that relate the microscopic and macroscopic descriptions(point iii ) .",
    "this aspects are pertinent in the construction of complex models from the continuous boltzmann equation ( e.g.  @xcite ) . in this work , however , we limit our discussion to an association of the properties mentioned in a part of the point ( ii ) for the lbe , i.e. for the exact invariance group  the galilean or inertial frame invariance .    in this regard , as a discrete approximation to the continuous full boltzmann equation , the development of the lbe consists of simplifications at different levels .",
    "thus , its various elements should be analyzed carefully to ascertain and quantify as to how well it satisfies galilean invariance .",
    "first , in contrast to continuous kinetic theory , due to the choice of finite lattice velocity sets and associated symmetries , it introduces linear dependencies of higher order moments with those of lower order moments that are supported by the lattice set  @xcite .",
    "such degeneracies can in turn lead to negative dependence of viscosity on fluid velocity .",
    "it generally causes the galilean invariance to be broken by the presence of terms that are cubic in velocity for the standard lattice configurations ( with symmetries of square in 2d and cube in 3d ) and also leads to numerical instability , especially at higher mach numbers .",
    "this issue can be alleviated by the use of extended lattice velocity sets , which then relegates the degeneracies among moments to even higher orders .",
    "second , the collision step including the forcing terms of the lbe should be carefully constructed in such a way that they recover correct physics which is inertial frame independent , i.e. the navier - stokes equations . here",
    ", the use of independent set of _ central _ moments for a chosen lattice provides a natural approach to maintain galilean invariance that can be constructed by invoking elements directly from kinetic theory .",
    "this is the main goal of the present work ( see below ) .",
    "a rational means to more efficiently account for both the above aspects is discussed in the last section of this paper . and , third , the streaming step of the lbe is generally constructed as a discrete lagrangian process . in the standard implementation , this couples the particle velocity and configurations spaces , which in turn , constrains the numerical accuracy of the lbe in the representation of the navier - stokes equations . as a result ,",
    "the galilean invariance of the lbe is limited by its overall numerical accuracy .",
    "however , it is known that such coupling between physical and lattice symmetries is not necessary in the discretization of the streaming operator .",
    "in fact , it can be discretized using classical schemes such as finite - difference or finite - element methods that alleviate this issue  @xcite . specifically , exploiting higher order discretization and time integration schemes ( e.g.  @xcite ) for the streaming operator could further improve the order of accuracy ( and hence the galilean invariance ) of the lbe . furthermore",
    ", the use of implicit schemes could enhance the computational efficiency in this regard .",
    "focusing on the second aspect mentioned above , a different type of collision operator and forcing can be devised that can maintain galilean invariance for a chosen lattice velocity set and a discretization scheme for the streaming step .",
    "specifically , central moments are relaxed in a moving frame of reference during collision step  @xcite , originally proposed to improve numerical stability , but emphasized here for its better physical coherence .",
    "the use of central moments , which are obtained by shifting the particle velocity with the local fluid velocity  @xcite , rigorously enforces galilean invariance .",
    "in particular , while other previous approaches are generally galilean invariant for up to second - order moments , the central moment based approach provides a higher order frame invariance as permitted by the discrete lattice velocity set .",
    "this approach was examined based on the concept of generalized local equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "in addition , to further improve physical coherence , the attractors for the higher order central moments were constructed as products of the lower order central moments , leading to the factorized central moment method  @xcite .",
    "recently , a new approach to incorporate source terms using central moments in the lbm that are galilean invariant by construction , which are important for computation of various physical problems , was developed  @xcite .",
    "the consistency of this technique to the navier - stokes equations was shown by means of the chapman - enskog analysis  @xcite and its numerical accuracy was established .",
    "furthermore , the method was also extended in three - dimensions for various lattice velocity sets and validated for a class of canonical problems  @xcite . as clarified in  @xcite , numerical stability of the central moment approach",
    "can be enhanced , when it is executed in a multiple relaxation time formulation , similar to the standard or raw moment based approaches .",
    "interestingly , it has been shown recently that when some classical schemes for flow simulation are made to satisfy galilean invariance more rigorously , they led to more robust implementations ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "turbulence remains as among the most challenging classes of flows for which considerable effort has been focused on the development of theory and applications using the lbm .",
    "since its roots can be traced to kinetic theory , the lbm has been analyzed for the development of turbulence models from a fundamental point of view  @xcite .",
    "it has been employed for computation of reynolds - averaged description of turbulent flows  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has found applications for large eddy simulation ( les ) using lbm formulations with srt  @xcite , and mrt  @xcite with multiblock approach for efficient implementation  @xcite .",
    "recently , dynamic subgrid scale ( sgs ) models for les were incorporated into the lbm framework that resulted in reduced empiricism for description at such scales  @xcite . moreover ,",
    "an improved inertial - range consistent sgs model was also proposed  @xcite .",
    "a theoretical formulation for a sgs model based on an approximate deconvolution method  @xcite that does not rely on the common eddy - viscosity concept for application with the lbm was also devised recently  @xcite .",
    "lastly , the closure modeling issues of kinetic and continuum turbulence effects were reconciled in a unified statistical / filtered description using a modified kinetic equation  @xcite .",
    "effectively , this allows the use of macroscopic turbulence models involving divergence of the reynolds stress in the forcing term of the kinetic equation .",
    "an important physical consideration for any description of turbulent flow is that it should be invariant for all inertial frames of reference . in other words , for general applicability ,",
    "representation of turbulence for all or any subset of its scales should be galilean invariant .",
    "thus , in particular , all sgs models , and associated numerical schemes for turbulence computation , should be frame invariant .",
    "an insightful analysis of various turbulence models was carried out from this viewpoint in  @xcite . a method to achieve galilean invariance by means of certain redefinition of turbulent stresses",
    "was discussed in  @xcite .",
    "a recent review on this subject is reported in  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it should be noted that concepts based on central moments have played an important role in the development of theoretical foundation of turbulence physics  such as for statistical turbulence theory  @xcite and turbulence modeling  @xcite .",
    "thus , in this paper , we develop a lattice boltzmann equation based on central moments for galilean invariant representation of turbulent flows .",
    "specifically , it allows frame - independent incorporation of general models for turbulent reynolds stresses in a statistical / filter averaged formulation using lbm for turbulence simulation .",
    "furthermore , in a general setting , it maintains the forces and stresses to be independent of any inertial frame of reference and could also improve numerical stability in computations . in  @xcite",
    ", we developed a forcing scheme based on a particular ansatz involving the local maxwell distribution .",
    "here , we develop a general forcing based on central moments by a direct examination of the continuous full boltzmann equation itself , which unlike  @xcite could also self - consistently account for non - equilibrium effects in higher order terms . in this regard ,",
    "the central moments of the resulting source terms of the continuous and discrete counterparts are matched successively at different orders leading to a cascaded structure .",
    "in essence , this approach can be considered as a galilean invariant minimal discrete model for the full boltzmann equation including forcing terms .",
    "the attractors for higher order central moments in the collision step of this computational model is based on the factorization in terms of those at lower orders by including such general forcing terms .",
    "in addition , we further develop this approach with reduced compressibility effects for improved representation of turbulent flow physics in the incompressible limit .",
    "the forcing formulation developed here for incorporating turbulence models in a statistical / filtered formulation can be extended to other problems , such as , for example , galilean invariant representation of forces or stresses in complex fluids .",

    "<S> we present a systematic derivation of a model based on the central moment lattice boltzmann equation that rigorously maintains galilean invariance of forces to simulate inertial frame independent flow fields . in this regard , the central moments , i.e. moments shifted by the local fluid velocity , of the discrete source terms of the lattice boltzmann equation are obtained by matching those of the continuous full boltzmann equation of various orders . </S>",
    "<S> this results in an exact hierarchical identity between the central moments of the source terms of a given order and the components of the central moments of the distribution functions and sources of lower orders . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding source terms in velocity space are then obtained from an exact inverse transformation due to a suitable choice of orthogonal basis for moments . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , such a central moment based kinetic model is further extended by incorporating reduced compressibility effects to represent incompressible flow . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the description and simulation of fluid turbulence for full or any subset of scales or their averaged behavior should remain independent of any inertial frame of reference . thus , based on the above formulation , a new approach in lattice boltzmann framework to incorporate turbulence models for simulation of galilean invariant statistical averaged or filtered turbulent fluid motion is discussed . </S>"
