    "supernova remnants ( snrs ) have long been considered to be likely acceleration sites of cosmic - ray particles below the energy of the _ knee _ , @xmath3 .",
    "the energy supply to explain the energy density of comic rays is satisfied if @xmath410% of the energy of each supernova is transferred to accelerated particles . also , the well developed theory of diffusive shock acceleration nicely explains the universal power - law spectrum of cosmic rays ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "although synchrotron emission detected in the radio band supports this idea observationally , no evidence of acceleration to tev energy had been observed until recently . during the last decade , such evidence was revealed through observations of x - rays and tev gamma rays from several shell - type snrs .",
    "@xcite discovered synchrotron x - rays from the shell of sn  1006 , which indicates electrons are accelerated up to multi - tev energies .",
    "this finding was followed by detections of synchrotron x - rays from other snrs , including rx  j1713.7@xmath03946 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "further evidence for multi - tev particles ( electrons and/or protons ) has been provided by discovery of tev gamma rays from some snrs , such as cassiopeia  a @xcite or rx  j1713.7@xmath03946 @xcite , although their spectral parameters and morphologies were not well determined due to the limited sensitivity of tev observatories .",
    "subsequently , high quality morphological and spectral studies have been performed by h.e.s.s .",
    "( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these pioneering measurements by the h.e.s.s .",
    "telescope , together with the high resolution x - ray data , have enabled direct comparison of x - ray and tev gamma - ray data .",
    "the shell - type snr rx  j1713.7@xmath03946 ( also known as g347.3@xmath00.5 ) , is one of the best - studied snrs from which both non - thermal x - rays and tev gamma rays are detected .",
    "this snr was discovered in soft x - rays during the _ rosat _ all - sky survey @xcite .",
    "the _ asca _ satellite , with wider energy coverage than that of _ rosat _ , revealed that the x - ray spectrum is featureless and can be best interpreted as synchrotron emission from very high energy electrons in the tev regime @xcite .",
    "the x - ray spectrum was well fitted with a power - law function of photon index @xmath5@xmath6 and interstellar absorption column density @xmath7@xmath8 without any observable evidence for a thermal emission component .",
    "subsequent observations by _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ have unveiled structure with a complex network of bright filaments and knots , in the western part of the snr @xcite .    tev gamma - ray emission from rx  j1713.7@xmath03946",
    "was first reported by the cangaroo collaboration in 1998 @xcite , and confirmed by the subsequent observations with cangaroo - ii in 2000 and 2001 @xcite .",
    "later , the h.e.s.s .",
    "collaboration obtained a resolved image of the source in tev gamma rays @xcite showing that the gamma - ray emission from rx  j1713.7@xmath03946 arises mainly in the shell .",
    "these observations revealed a striking correlation between the x - ray and the gamma - ray images , which indicates a strong connection between the physical processes responsible for x - ray and tev gamma - ray emission components @xcite .",
    "based on the spectral and morphological information , they discussed two possible gamma - ray emission scenarios , one where gamma rays are generated by inverse compton scattering of accelerated electrons with diffuse radiation fields ( the so - called leptonic scenario ) and the other where the decay of secondary @xmath9-mesons is responsible for gamma rays ( hadronic scenario ) .",
    "the later observations with h.e.s.s . revealed that the flux extends to 30  tev and , likely , beyond , which implies particle acceleration up to energies well above 100  tev for either model @xcite .",
    "most recently , our x - ray observations using _ chandra _ and _ suzaku _ have provided important clues for understanding the acceleration process in the snr . from a series of observations of the northwest part of the snr with _",
    "chandra _ in 2000 , 2005 and 2006 , we discovered that compact regions of the northwest ( nw ) shell are variable in flux on a one - year time scale @xcite .",
    "the fast variability was interpreted as one - year scale acceleration and synchrotron cooling of electrons with amplified magnetic fields of order of 1  mg .",
    "such a large magnetic field in compact regions strongly favors @xmath10-decay emission as the origin of tev gamma rays .",
    "also , thanks to the wide - band coverage of _ suzaku _ and its low background level , we were able to measure a hard x - ray spectrum up to 40  kev from the southwest portion of rx  j1713.7@xmath03946 with a clear indication of a high - energy cutoff in the synchrotron spectrum ( @xcite , hereafter paper i ) .",
    "combined with the upper limit on a shock speed of @xmath11 placed by _",
    ", the cutoff energy determined by the _ suzaku _ observation of the southwest part indicates that particle acceleration within the snr shock is so efficient that it approaches the theoretical limit corresponding to the so - called bohm diffusion regime ( e.g. @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    ", we present results of mapping observations of rx  j1713.7@xmath03946 with _ suzaku _ , which covers about two - thirds of the snr region with 11 pointings .",
    "the low background level of the hard x - ray detector ( hxd ) enables us to detect hard x - ray emission up to @xmath1 from each of the pointings . at the same time",
    ", its small field - of - view ( fov ) of @xmath12 fwhm gives us information about the spatial distribution of hard x - ray emission and spectral differences from region to region .",
    "thanks to its low instrumental background and large effective area , the other detector system aboard _ suzaku _",
    ", the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ) , also uncovers new observational facts , such as spectral features below 10  kev and the morphology of relatively dim regions left unclear in previous studies by _ asca _ , _ chandra _ , and _ xmm - newton_. by combining the xis and hxd spectra summed over the data from all the pointings , we show a wide - band x - ray spectrum ( 0.440  kev ) with quite high statistics , with which we investigate not only the existence of a cutoff , but also its shape .",
    "we then compare the cutoff shape obtained with theoretical predictions .    in section 2",
    ", we describe our _ suzaku _ observations and the data reduction procedures .",
    "analysis and results of hxd and xis data are shown in  3.1 and  3.2 , respectively .",
    "we present the wide - band spectrum by connecting the xis and the hxd data in  3.3 . a detailed study regarding the cutoff structure",
    "is also given there .",
    "section 4 is devoted to multi - wavelength spectral and morphological studies .",
    "the results obtained are discussed in the following section , and the results are finally summarized . throughout this paper , we assume that the distance to rx  j1713.7@xmath03946 is close to 1  kpc as proposed by @xcite based on the @xmath13 value .",
    "a similar distance has been claimed based on the nanten co data @xcite .",
    "the typical age of the remnant for such a distance is estimated of order of 1000  yr , which can be an indication of association of rx  j1713.7@xmath03946 with an explosion in a.d .",
    "393 as proposed by @xcite .",
    "the _ suzaku _ observatory @xcite is the fifth japanese x - ray astronomy satellite , jointly developed by japan and the us .",
    "its scientific payload consists of two co - aligned detector systems , the xis @xcite and the hxd @xcite .",
    "the xis consists of four x - ray ccd cameras which are located in the foci of x - ray telescopes ( xrt ; @xcite ) .",
    "three of the xis sensors are front - illuminated ( fi ; 0.412  kev ) ccds and the other is back - illuminated ( bi 0.212  kev ) .",
    "the non - imaging , collimated hard x - ray instrument , the hxd , covers the 10600  kev bandpass .",
    "two main detector units , silicon pin diodes and gso scintillators , are buried at the bottom of well - type active shield of bgo .",
    "the former covers the lower energy band of 1060  kev , while the latter detects higher energy photons of 40600  kev .",
    "we performed 11 pointing observations of rx  j1713.7@xmath03946 with _",
    "suzaku_. the observation log is summarized in table  1 , and the pointing position of each observation is shown in figure  [ fig : obs_fov ] . the southwest part of the snr , labeled as pointing 0 , was observed in 2005 during the performance verification phase , while the other ten observations were performed in 2006 during the _ suzaku _ ao1 phase . since the snr is located on the galacic plane , it is of importance to check the hard x - ray background associated with the milky way .",
    "we therefore observed two nearby background regions containing no bright x - ray point sources .",
    "the pointing positions of these `` off '' observations are shown with red squares in figure  [ fig : obs_fov ] .",
    "the xis was operated in the normal full - frame clocking mode without spaced - row charge injection during all the observations . since the results from pointing 0 , together with those from the off observations ,",

    "we used data products from the pipeline processing version 1.2 . for the xis analysis",
    ", we retrieved `` cleaned event files '' which are screened using standard event selection criteria .",

    "`` uncleaned event files '' were screened using standard event screening criteria .",

    "october 4 , the bias voltage of 16 more pin diodes ( the pin diodes in the well - counter units of w10w13 ; w1 ) was reduced to 400  v for the same reason .",
    "the reduction of the pin diode bias voltage leads to a decrease of their effective area and also affects their energy response .",

    "as already reported in paper i , the xis data reveal a cutoff below 10  kev in the spectrum of the sw rim .",

    "we extracted spectra from the regions shown in figure  [ fig : xis_mosaic_image ] with the green squares .",
    "the region labeled as  1 ( region 1 ) is the same one that we used for the spectral analysis in paper i. the background spectrum needs to be accumulated from nearby regions since rx  j1713.7@xmath03946 is located almost on the galactic plane .",
    "the off observation data can not be used for background estimation other than for region 1 .",

    "this model yields acceptable fits for most of the spectra .",
    "however , the fits to the spectra of region 1 , 2 , and 6 are not acceptable even at the 99% confidence level .",
    "we show the spectrum of region 2 with the best - fit power - law and the residuals in figure  [ fig : xis_spec_reg2 ] .",
    "although not so drastic as region 1 which is shown in paper i , a correlated pattern to the residuals can be seen for the region 2 .",
    "a similar pattern is also seen in the data of region 6 .",
    "we the fitted all the spectra with a cutoff power law .",
    "this function gives acceptable fits for all regions , and consistently gives better values of @xmath74 .",
    "in figure  [ fig : xis_spec_reg2 ] , we plot the residuals for the spectrum of region 2 . these results , together with the steeper spectra detected with hxd ,",
    "indicate the existence of a cutoff somewhere between the bandpasses of the xis and hxd .",
    "although statistically rejected for some regions , the results obtained with the power - law fits are consistent with previous studies with _ asca _ , _ chandra _ , and _ xmm - newton _ @xcite . the results with _ suzaku",
    "_ suggest that the photon index is larger and the absorption is smaller for the inner regions than for the outer regions .",

    "note that the escape of electrons through convection has strong impact only on low energy electrons ; because of fast synchrotron cooling , the effect of escape is negligible for multi - tev electrons .",
    "a significant quantity of low - energy electrons can escape from the shell of the snr before emitting radio photons .",
    "therefore , the radio flux can be reduced while the x - ray flux will remain unchanged .    for calculations shown in figure  [ fig : sed ] ,",
    "the total energy of electrons is estimated as @xmath243 , and the energy for protons as @xmath244 . in the case of harder energy spectra with power - law index",
    "@xmath242 corresponding to figure  [ fig : sed_17 ] , one has @xmath245 , and @xmath246 , respectively .",
    "the proton / electron ratio in either case is very small , @xmath247 .",
    "this value is significantly smaller than that for directly observed local cosmic rays ( @xmath248 ) , unless a large ambient matter density of @xmath249 is assumed .",
    "@xcite and @xcite argued that the hadronic scenario for this snr has difficulties because the @xmath250 value should be consistent with local cosmic rays and other snrs .",
    "however , the @xmath250 value of one snr at a fixed age does not necessarily need to agree with the local cosmic ray value .",
    "the low - energy electrons are likely produced in later stages of snr evolution , when the @xmath250 value can be different from the present value .",
    "a comparison with other snrs should be performed with care , as well .",
    "cutoff energy in the gamma - ray spectrum should give an important hint whether snrs are sources of cosmic rays below the _ knee _ , if gamma rays observed by h.e.s.s . have hadronic origins .",
    "@xcite argued that the cutoff energy of the h.e.s.s .",
    "spectrum of rx  j1713@xmath03946 is around 18  tev , which can be translated to proton energy more than 10 times below the energy of the _ knee_. indeed our multi - wavelength study requires a cutoff in the proton spectrum around 100  tev or even less for hard acceleration spectra of protons .",
    "however , one should take into account that even in the case of effective acceleration the highest energy protons beyond 100 tev escape the source in a quite short time scales , and hence do not contribute to the gamma - ray production at the present epoch @xcite .    a unique feature of rx  j 1713.7 - 3946 is the lack of thermal x - ray emission .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite interpreted this fact as an argument against the hadronic model for tev gamma rays .",
    "generally it is true that plasma in young supernova remnants is heated to high temperatures observed via thermal x - ray emission of hot electrons .",
    "however , one should take into account that we deal with a unique object , and the lack of thermal x - ray emission can not _ a priori _ be invoked as an argument against the hadronic origin of the observed tev gamma rays .",
    "it is important to note that in snr shocks the formation of high plasma temperatures with @xmath251 is relevant only to protons ( ions ) , and that a high ion temperature does not automatically ( from first principles ) mean a high electron temperature .",
    "in fact , the only known heating process of thermal electrons is coulomb collisions between electrons and protons ( ions ) , which , however , has too long time scale to establish electron - proton equipartition . on the other hand , we do know from x - ray observations that the electrons in young snrs are heated to kev temperatures .",
    "this can be explained by assuming that a hypothetical mechanism , most likely related to the energy exchange through excited plasma waves , is responsible for effective electron heating in snrs .",
    "as long as the nature of this mechanism in collisionless shocks remains unknown , one can not predict , even qualitatively , the specifics of its operation on a source by source basis .",
    "we indeed deal with two interesting facts .",
    "first , many young snrs , like tycho and cassiopeia a , with intense thermal x - ray emission and intense nonthermal radio emission emit little ( or do not emit at all ) tev gamma rays . on the other hand , rx  j1713.7@xmath03946 , with lack of ( or rather very low ) thermal x - ray emission and with relatively weak nonthermal radio emission , is a source of powerful tev radiation .",
    "these two facts can be treated as a hint for low efficiency of establishing equipartition in the thermal plasma in very effective tev particle accelerators like rx  j1713.7@xmath03946 .",
    "it is interesting to note in this regard , that such a tendency is found also for another effective tev accelerator  sn 1006 @xcite .",
    "whether the reduction of the exchange rate between different particle species in thermal plasma has a link to the particle acceleration in high mach number shocks , as proposed by @xcite , is a very interesting question to be explored in future deep theoretical and phenomenological studies . in this regard ,",
    "rx  j1713.7@xmath03946 can serve as a key `` template '' source for such studies .",
    "@xcite also discussed low electron temperature based on _ chandra _ observations of a young snr in the small magellanic could , 1e  0102.2@xmath07219 .",
    "they measured a blast - wave velocity of @xmath252 from the expansion rate and predicted the electron temperature of @xmath253 by considering coulomb heating .",
    "however , the electron temperature derived from their spectral analysis is 0.5  kev , which is far below the prediction . according to their discussion , not only electron heating but also ion heating is suppressed and substantial fraction of energy",
    "may be going into cosmic - ray production due to the non - linear effects in the shock .",
    "the nonlinear shock acceleration in this object can convert a significant , up to @xmath254 fraction of the kinetic energy of explosion into relativistic particles .",
    "correspondingly the fraction of available energy which goes to the heating of the ambient plasma will be reduced @xmath255 . yet",
    ", conservative estimates show that plasma in rx  j1713.7@xmath03946 can be heated to quite high temperatures even the heating of electrons and protons proceeds only through the coulomb exchange .",
    "this question recently has studied by @xcite for a standard snr of age @xmath256  yr and energy @xmath257  erg . in particular",
    ", it has been shown that in the case of effective diffusive shock acceleration and the plasma density @xmath258 , the ratio of synchrotron luminosity to thermal ( bremsstrahlung ) luminosity can be as large as 100 .",
    "this implies that in the case of rx  j1713.7@xmath03946 , from which thermal x - ray emission is not observed , the plasma density can not significantly exceed @xmath259 ( the luminosity of thermal bremsstrahlung is proportional to @xmath260 ) .",
    "the low density of order of @xmath259 reduces the parameter space for hadronic models but does not exclude it . indeed , as mentioned above , the tev gamma - ray flux of rx  j1713.7@xmath03946 can be explained by interactions of protons if the parameter @xmath261 exceeds 1.5 to 3 , depending on the spectrum of protons . assuming that more than @xmath262 of the explosion energy of this snr is released in accelerated protons , and that the plasma in the gamma - ray production region is compressed by a factor of few , we find that the located of the source at a distance of about 1 kpc would marginally support the hadronic model . while closer location of the source would make the model requirements quite viable and flexible , the location of the source beyond 1",
    "kpc hardly can be accommodated within a standard shock acceleration scenario .",
    "if the snr is closer , the distance of @xmath263 seems reasonable considering the upper limit on the shock speed of @xmath264 by @xcite .",
    "finally we should mention the model suggested by @xcite which can naturally explain both the low synchrotron flux at radio frequencies and lack of thermal x - ray emission of rx  j1713.7@xmath03946 .",
    "the standard scenarios of gamma - ray production in snrs assume that radiation is produced in downstream where the density of both relativistic particles and thermal plasma is higher than in upstream .",
    "however , in the cases when the shock is expanding into a low - density wind bubble and approaching cold dense material , e.g. swept - up shell or surrounding molecular clouds , the gamma - radiation is contributed predominantly from upstream .",
    "while the energy distribution of accelerated particles downstream is coordinate - independent in both linear and nonlinear regimes , the particle distribution upstream is coordinate - dependent . because of energy - dependent diffusion coefficient , the high - energy particles diffuse ahead of low - energy particles , thus a dense material adjacent upstream will `` see '' relativistic particles ( protons and electrons ) with low - energy exponential cutoff , @xmath265 , which depends on the location of the dense regions .",
    "this implies that the effective production of tev gamma - rays ( from _ p - p _ interactions ) and x - rays ( from synchrotron radiation of tev electrons ) will be not accompanied by low energy ( gev ) gamma - rays and synchrotron radio emission . obviously , this model is not constraint by lack of thermal emission .",
    "in addition to the spectral information , the comparison of x - ray and tev gamma - ray images presented in figure  [ fig : plot_kev_vs_tev ] helps us to draw the physical picture of rx  j1713.7@xmath03946 .",
    "let us first discuss the tight correlation observed in most parts of the remnant . within the hypothesis of hadronic origin of gamma - rays ,",
    "the gamma - ray flux is proportional to the number densities of the ambient matter and relativistic protons , while the x - ray flux is proportional to number density of electrons . if the matter distribution significantly varies throughout the snr , we need fine parameter tuning among the matter distribution , the electron injection rate , and the proton injection rate , in order to produce the tight correlation . therefore , more natural explanation is that the matter density is uniform and the injection rate of the electrons and that of the protons are proportional to each other .",
    "the x - ray flux excess along the nw and sw rims provides a unique probe of recent acceleration activity .",
    "let us consider a `` toy '' model and compare its predictions with the observational results . in the toy model ,",
    "the injection rate of electrons and protons keeps constant but increases by a factor of 1.5 in the last 10  yr only at the nw and sw rims .",
    "what is important here is the difference of cooling time between electrons and protons .",
    "the synchrotron cooling time of an electron emitting synchrotron photons with energy of @xmath266 is given as equation ( [ eq : sync_cooling_time ] ) , while the cooling time of protons due to @xmath267-@xmath267 interactions is expressed as @xmath268 and is almost energy - independent .",
    "for the magnetic field @xmath269 , the cooling times of electrons emitting 2  kev and 5  kev x - rays are @xmath270 and @xmath271 , respectively . for any reasonable density of ambient gas , the cooling time of protons",
    "is much longer than the lifetime of this snr . while the synchrotron x - rays we observe at present are emitted by electrons accelerated during the last @xmath272 .",
    "the flux of @xmath10-decay gamma rays is provided by protons accelerated throughout the lifetime of the snr .",
    "figure  [ fig : plot_kev_vs_tev_toymodel ] shows the scatter plot of @xmath220 and @xmath221 expected from the toy model , which shows a similar distribution to the observational results in figure  [ fig : plot_kev_vs_tev ] .",
    "the recent active acceleration increases the x - ray flux while keeping the gamma - ray flux almost unchanged .",
    "we observed snr rx  j1713.7@xmath03946 with the _ suzaku _ observatory .",
    "hard x - rays up to @xmath1 are detected from each of the 11 pointings .",
    "the hard x - ray morphology estimated by the hxd pin data is generally consistent with an extrapolation of that in the energy region below 10  kev .",
    "when the hxd spectra are fitted with a power law , the photon indices are larger than those obtained from the xis data .",
    "the difference of photon indices between the xis and the hxd varies from region to region . although this may suggest a variation of spectral shape or cutoff energy , the fov of the hxd pin is not small enough to allow detailed imaging spectroscopy .",
    "such studies will become possible with upcoming missions with hard x - ray mirrors like _ next _ , _ nustar _ , or _",
    "simbol - x_. moreover these missions will extend the effective studies up to 100 kev .",
    "if the tev gamma - ray emission of rx  j1713.7@xmath03946 is of hadronic origin , this should allow detection and study of synchrotron x - ray emission of electrons produced in proton - proton interactions via decays of secondary charged pions @xcite .",
    "in this regard , the above mentioned missions can provide very effective tools for deep ( at the level as low as @xmath273 ) probes of hadronic processes in snrs in the @xmath274 tev energy regime with unprecedented ( subarcmin ) angular resolution .",
    "using the xis and hxd data , we obtained a synchrotron spectrum in the energy range of two decades ( 0.440  kev ) , which means we can probe the parent electron distribution in the energy range of one decade regardless of the magnetic field strength .",
    "the wide - band coverage enables us to see a clear high - energy cutoff in the synchrotron spectrum , and for the first time allows detailed studies of the cutoff shape and derivation of the spectrum of the parent electrons . the spectral shape in the cutoff region was quantitatively evaluated , which revealed that the cutoff shape is compatible with a theoretical prediction by @xcite .",
    "based on their model , the cutoff energy is obtained as @xmath275 .",
    "this result , together with upper limit of the shock velocity from _ chandra _ @xcite , indicates that acceleration efficiency in this remnant approaches the bohm limit .",
    "we modeled the multi - wavelength spectrum of rx  j1713.7@xmath03946 within both the leptonic and hadronic gamma - ray production scenarios .",
    "the hadronic model nicely fits the data while it seems difficult to explain all observational data with a simple leptonic model .",
    "the major problem with leptonic models is related to the requirement of low magnetic field , @xmath276 which does not agree with the recent discovery of variability of local regions of the shell on year timescales .",
    "the hadronic models recently have be criticized based on the lack of thermal emission and low radio flux .",
    "however , these fact can be accommodated within a standard shock acceleration model in a young snr with magnetic field as large as @xmath236 , plasma density @xmath277 , and distance to the source @xmath278 , assuming that more than 30% of energy of explosion is released in relativistic protons with spectrum as hard as @xmath237 and exponential cutoff around 100  tev .",
    "finally , besides the general strong correlation between x - ray and tev gamma - ray emission , we found an excess x - ray emission compared to gamma - ray emission in the brightest regions of the remnant .",
    "this excess can be explained by recent activity accompanied by effective acceleration of electrons in localised reagions of the shell .",
