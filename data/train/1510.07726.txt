    "<S> we use toponogov s triangle comparison theorem from riemannian geometry along with quantitative scale oriented variants of classical propagation of singularities arguments to obtain logarithmic improvements of the kakeya - nikodym norms introduced in @xcite for manifolds of nonpositive sectional curvature . using these and results from our paper @xcite we are able to obtain log - improvements of @xmath0 estimates for such manifolds when @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> these in turn imply @xmath2 , @xmath3 , improved lower bounds for @xmath4-norms of eigenfunctions of the estimates of the second author and zelditch  @xcite , and using a result from hezari and the second author  @xcite , under this curvature assumption , we are able to improve the lower bounds for the size of nodal sets of colding and minicozzi  @xcite by a factor of @xmath5 for any @xmath6 , if @xmath7 .          the purpose of this paper is to show that if @xmath8 is a compact riemannian manifold of dimension @xmath9 then one obtains logarithmically improved kakeya - nikodym bounds of eigenfunctions and appropriate eigenfunctions in all dimensions , as well as log - improved restriction estimates in two - dimensions . using results from a companion paper @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we deduce that we have improved @xmath0 estimates for the range @xmath1 . these imply log - improvements of the @xmath10 bounds of the second author and zelditch  @xcite , which in turn imply log - improvements ( assuming nonpositive curvature ) of the lower bounds of colding and minicozzi  @xcite for the size of nodal sets . </S>",
    "<S> the assumption of nonpositive curvature is needed since , except for the last estimate regarding nodal sets , all of the estimates are saturated by the highest weight spherical harmonics , on @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> they also are saturated by the gaussian beams constructed by ralston  @xcite , which can not exist on manifolds of nonpositive curvature .    </S>",
    "<S> we shall consider @xmath14-normalized eigenfunctions on a riemannian manifold @xmath8 of dimension @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> so we are considering functions satisfying @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 of course are the laplace - beltrami operator and volume element associated with the metric @xmath18 on @xmath19 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> so in our case @xmath20 is the frequency of the eigenvalue , and also @xmath21 is an eigenfunction with eigenvalue @xmath20 of @xmath22 .    in what follows , </S>",
    "<S> we let @xmath23 denote the space of all geodesic segments of length one , assuming that @xmath24 , where @xmath25 denotes the injectivity radius of @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise , we shall modify things so that the geodesics in @xmath23 are of length @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> this slight ambiguity is caused by the fact that we shall want to assume eventually that the sectional curvatures of @xmath8 are pinched below by @xmath27 to simplify the statement of the cone comparison result that we shall employ , which play a critical role in our analysis .    </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath28 , @xmath29 denotes a geodesic tube of width @xmath30 about @xmath28 , then the kakeya - nikodym norm of our eigenfunctions defined by @xmath31 were introduced by one of us in @xcite , following earlier related work of bourgain  @xcite , as a way of controlling the @xmath0 norms of eigenfunctions . </S>",
    "<S> although not explicitly stated , the inequalities proved in @xcite yield @xmath32 and hence improvements over the trivial estimate @xmath33 would yield improvements over the second author s earlier bounds @xcite @xmath34 ( saturated on @xmath35 ) . by interpolating with the @xmath36 estimate there , one would also get improvements for the full range @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> the trivial kakeya - nikodym bounds were improved by the second author and zelditch in @xcite , who showed that , in two dimensions , one has @xmath38 , and , as a result , the improvement @xmath39 , under the assumption of nonpositive curvature . </S>",
    "<S> these sorts of results were extended to higher dimensions by the authors in @xcite . in all cases , </S>",
    "<S> though , even though we could show that the various norms were relatively small as @xmath40 , there was no control on the rate of decay of the kakeya - nikodym norms or on the way that the constants in the @xmath41 improvements over the ones in @xcite go to zero as @xmath40 .    </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of this paper is to establish that there are improvements in turns of powers of @xmath42 for all of these things . </S>",
    "<S> our main result , which along with estimates in a companion paper , yields these improved bounds .    [ mainthm ] suppose @xmath8 has nonpositive sectional curvatures . </S>",
    "<S> then @xmath43 for @xmath44 with @xmath45 moreover , if @xmath46 , we have @xmath47 the above estimates hold as well when @xmath48 is replaced by a quasi - mode satisfying @xmath49    the estimate is stronger than when @xmath46 . moreover , it represents a logarithmic improvement over the two - dimensional restriction estimates of burq , grard and tzvetkov  @xcite . as we pointed out in @xcite in higher dimensions , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath50 , restriction estimates , as opposed to the kakeya - nikodym tube estimates as in , are too singular to control @xmath41 norms . in these dimensions </S>",
    "<S> they are saturated by eigenfunctions matching the profile of zonal spherical harmonics , rather than highest weight spherical harmonics which saturate the kakeya - nikodym norms in . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , it is also a bit more straightforward to obtain logarithmic improvements over the geodesic restriction estimates in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this was done by chen  @xcite when @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> chen and one of us @xcite also showed that when @xmath52 one could improve on the universal bounds ( saturated in this case by both zonal harmonics and highest weight spherical harmonics ) assuming that @xmath8 is of constant nonpositive curvature . whether one can get logarithmic improvements for either constant or variable nonpositive curvature is an interesting open problem in this dimension .    </S>",
    "<S> the proof of these results will follow closely the general scheme introduced in @xcite and @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the new ingredient is that we are using classical triangle comparison theorems from riemannian geometry to make tighter pseudo - differential cutoffs allowing us to use the time - averaging method over logarithmic time intervals ( as opposed to large ones basically not depending on @xmath20 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we use the universal cover of @xmath8 to break up the operators that we use to obtain our estimates into a number of pieces . </S>",
    "<S> we use quantitative and scale oriented variants of classical propagation of singularities arguments ( i.e. , integration by parts ) to handle what turn out to be the small , but numerous , `` error '' terms which arise from terms associated with a portion of the universal cover not contained in a natural cone of small apeture about the geodesic . </S>",
    "<S> we can handle the relatively few remaining `` local terms '' in standard ways .    </S>",
    "<S> before we turn to the proof of theorem let us state a couple of corollaries of our main theorem and results from our companion paper @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the first concerns logarithmically improved @xmath41 norms of eigenfunctions and appropriate quasi - modes .    </S>",
    "<S> [ lpcorr ] assume , as above , that @xmath8 is a compact @xmath53 dimensional manifold with nonpositive sectional curvatures . </S>",
    "<S> then for any @xmath1 there is a number @xmath54 so that @xmath55 furthermore , if @xmath56 , one can take @xmath57 the above estimates hold as well when @xmath21 is replaced by a quasi - mode satisfying .    </S>",
    "<S> let us show how we can obtain these @xmath41 norms for eigenfunctions and postpone the discussion of quasi - modes for a bit . </S>",
    "<S> to prove we shall use and the following estimate from our companion paper @xcite , @xmath58 using this estimate and our kakeya - nikodym bounds we immediately get for the range @xmath59 , and the estimates from the remaining range @xmath60 follow from interpolation with the trivial bound @xmath61 .    using these estimates we can in turn get improvements for lower bounds of the @xmath4 norms of eigenfunctions and the size of their nodal sets under our curvature assumptions :    assume that @xmath8 is as above . then @xmath62 for any @xmath63 with @xmath64 consequently , if @xmath21 is a real - valued eigenfunction and @xmath65 denotes the @xmath66-dimensional hausdorff measure of its nodal set , @xmath67 , we have @xmath68 when @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , when @xmath52 , @xmath69 for all @xmath70 .    </S>",
    "<S> the lower bound of @xmath71 is due to colding and minicozzi  @xcite and it is the best known lower bound for general @xmath72 manifolds . an alternate proof of this lower bound was later found by the author and zelditch  @xcite . in the real analytic case </S>",
    "<S> donnelly and fefferman  @xcite showed that @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> earlier yau  @xcite had conjectured this bound for general smooth riemannian manifolds .    to prove , we first notice that , by hlder s inequality @xmath74 and so @xmath75 to get we plug the estimates into this inequality and realize that the resulting lower bounds improve as @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> the power @xmath77 represents what we would obtain if were valid at the endpoint , which thus gives us . </S>",
    "<S> to prove we just use the lower bound of hezari and the second author  @xcite , @xmath78 which was proved using ideas from an earlier work of the second author and zelditch  @xcite .    in a recent work , </S>",
    "<S> hezari and rivire  @xcite were able to obtain log - improvements for @xmath41-norms of a subsequence of eigenfunctions of density one assuming that the sectional curvatures of @xmath8 are strictly negative . </S>",
    "<S> our results relax the latter condition to our assumption that the curvatures be nonpositive , but , more significantly , we are able to handle all eigenfunctions and not just ones corresponding to a density one subsequence of eigenvalues . the results of hezari and rivire  @xcite are based on obtaining non - trivial log - improvements of @xmath14-norms of eigenfunctions over shrinking balls ( which had also been obtained earlier and independently by han  @xcite ) and then using an estimate that relates such estimates to @xmath41-norms ( see also @xcite for the latter ) . over the years , there have been many works on improving @xmath41-norms for relatively large exponents @xmath79 , including @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hassell and tacy  @xcite extended brard s sup - norm estimate , implicit in @xcite , by showing that there are @xmath80 improvements over the bounds of @xcite under the assumption of nonpositive curvature for all @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> the endpoint case where @xmath81 is the remaining case where general results concerning improvements for the full sequence of eigenfunctions under natural geometric assumptions remains open .      </S>",
    "<S> to prove , we shall use the fact that if @xmath82 satisfies @xmath83,\\ ] ] then @xmath84 consequently , we would have the estimate for eigenfunctions if we could show that we have @xmath85 where the constants involved are independent of @xmath28 .    </S>",
    "<S> let us also see why implies that also holds for quasi - modes satisfying . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath86 denote an orthonormal basis of eigenfunctions with eigenvalues @xmath87 and let @xmath88 denote the projection onto the @xmath89th eigenspace . then since @xmath90 and since @xmath91 </S>",

    "<S> ( see @xcite for similar arguments . )    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath41 estimates for quasi - modes are proved by a similar argument . </S>",
    "<S> theorem 1.1 in @xcite shows that for @xmath96 as above @xmath97 if we combine this with , we deduce that for exponents such exponents we have @xmath98 since @xmath99 and @xmath90 , this in turn implies that @xmath100 } \\ , </S>",

    "<S> there is no loss of generality in assuming , as we shall , that they satisfy @xmath108 and we also recall that we are assuming that they are everywhere nonpositive </S>",
    "<S> .    we shall then use quantitative microlocal analysis bounds and the following geometric fact , which is a consequence of toponogov s triangle comparison theorem , to prove theorem  [ mainthm ] .    </S>",
    "<S> [ topprop ] equip @xmath109 with a metric @xmath110 of nonpositive curvature and assume that the sectional curvatures , @xmath111 , of @xmath112 also satisfy @xmath113 let @xmath114 , @xmath115 , be a geodesic with @xmath116 . given @xmath117 , </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath118 , @xmath119 , denote the set of points @xmath120 which lie on a geodesic though @xmath121 which intersects @xmath122 of angle @xmath123 . </S>",

    "<S> then if @xmath127 we have that @xmath128    * remark : * to simplify the notation we are assuming throughout that the nonpositive curvature is pinched below by @xmath27 . if we assumed the nonpositive sectional curvatures were bounded below by @xmath129 , then the proof of proposition  [ topprop ] which we shall present also gives that @xmath130 sending @xmath131 , despite being slightly weaker , one essentially recovers the familiar `` sine equals opposite over hypothesis '' in euclidean geometry .    </S>",
    "<S> the other main tool that we shall use , as in our earlier related works @xcite , @xcite , is a scale oriented microlocalization about the unit cosphere bundle @xmath132 associated with our @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> we may work in local coordinates so that @xmath133 is just @xmath134 fix then @xmath135 satisfying @xmath136 for @xmath137 and @xmath138 for @xmath139 and define compound symbols @xmath140 where @xmath141 is assumed to satisfy @xmath142 , \\quad \\upsilon(s)=0 , \\ , \\ , s\\notin[\\tfrac{c_0}2 , 2c_0^{-1}],\\ ] ] with @xmath143 a small but fixed number to be specified later . </S>",

    "<S> we shall take @xmath146 for some @xmath147 to also be specified later . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath148 from this and a simple integration by parts argument we deduce that we have the uniform bounds for such @xmath125 and @xmath44 @xmath149 consequently , we have the uniform bounds @xmath150    we then shall use the following local result which is valid for _ all compact riemannian manifolds _ , which also does not require the support assumptions in . </S>",

    "<S> moreover , when @xmath46 and @xmath143 is sufficiently small , we have , for any @xmath158 , @xmath159 with @xmath160 denoting the norm taken with respect to arc length measure over our @xmath28 . for a given @xmath161 , </S>",
    "<S> the constants in and also only depend on the size of finitely many derivatives of @xmath162 .    </S>",
    "<S> the two - dimensional estimate is related to estimates of greenleaf and seeger  @xcite for fourier integral operators associated to one - sided folding canonical relations and trace estimates for the wave equation of tataru  @xcite .      </S>",
    "<S> we shall postpone the proof of the two propositions until after this section . now let us show how they imply our kakeya - nikodym estimates .    </S>",
    "<S> let us split up our operators @xmath163 into two pieces . </S>",
    "<S> the first , @xmath164 denotes the microlocalization near the geodesic , which should be thought of as the `` main '' term , while the `` remainder '' , @xmath165 , is given by @xmath166 using it is very easy to handle the remainder on _ any _ manifold . </S>",
    "<S> no curvature assumptions are needed . </S>",
    "<S> choose @xmath167 so that @xmath168 . </S>",
    "<S> then since @xmath169 maps @xmath170 to itself with norm 1 , implies that we have the uniform bounds @xmath171 since , in view of the left side is zero if @xmath172 , if we sum over these bounds we deduce that @xmath173    we shall always assume that @xmath174 which we can achieve by taking the @xmath175 in the proposition  [ tatprop ] to be close to @xmath176 . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , if we assume that @xmath177 in is small enough we get @xmath178 which is much better than the bounds posited in . </S>",
    "<S> we note here that , in addition to making no curvature assumptions , we are not requiring the support assumptions in .    on account of , we would have if we could show that @xmath179 where @xmath107 will be a small constant , chosen , for instance , so that the @xmath180 in is small . </S>",
    "<S> also , the first part of means that we assume that the operators satisfy the bounds when , as in , we assume that the functions are supported in @xmath152 . since @xmath181 has a smooth kernel with @xmath182 bounds on all derivatives independent of @xmath183 , to prove , by euler s formula , it suffices to show that @xmath184 where @xmath185    we have switched from @xmath186 to @xmath187 so that we can use the hadamard parametrix and the cartan - hadamard theorem to lift the calculations that will be needed for up to the universal cover @xmath112 of @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the approach that was used in @xcite and @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath188 denotes the group of deck transformations preserving the associated covering map @xmath189 coming from the exponential map from @xmath190 associated with the metric @xmath18 on @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> the metric @xmath110 then is its pullback via @xmath191 . </S>",
    "<S> choose also a dirichlet fundamental domain , @xmath192 , for @xmath19 centered at the lift @xmath193 of @xmath190 . </S>",
    "<S> we shall let @xmath114 , @xmath115 , denote the lift of the geodesic @xmath194 , @xmath115 , containing the unit segment @xmath194 , @xmath195 around which our tube is centered . </S>",
    "<S> we shall work in geodesic normal coordinates vanishing at @xmath193 and we may assume that @xmath196    let @xmath197 be all those deck transformations for which @xmath198 here @xmath199 denotes the @xmath200-tube about the geodesic in @xmath112 , and , since @xmath201 is a dirichlet domain @xmath202 we measure distances in @xmath112 using its riemannian distance function @xmath203 . the distance function on @xmath8 is similarly denoted by @xmath204 .    </S>",
    "<S> following @xcite , we recall also that if @xmath205 denotes the lift of @xmath206 to @xmath201 , then we have the following formula @xmath207 consequently , @xmath208 where @xmath209 is the operator with kernel @xmath210 , where @xmath211 \\right)(\\tilde x , \\tilde y).\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    if we let @xmath212 denote the kernel of the operator in the square brackets , i.e. , @xmath213 then , as we shall show , one can use the hadamard parametrix to obtain the uniform bounds @xmath214 with @xmath107 sufficiently small . </S>",
    "<S> the estimates also hold when @xmath215 , but we shall need this for now .    </S>",
    "<S> we claim that these size estimates along with young s inequality and imply that we have the uniform bounds @xmath216 when @xmath217 , and a slightly different argument will be needed to show that the bounds also hold for @xmath218 </S>",
    "<S> . we shall postpone the simple proof of until after we introduce the hadamard parametrix .    </S>",
    "<S> recall that , by construction , the kernel @xmath219 vanishes if the distance from either @xmath220 or @xmath221 to @xmath222 is larger than @xmath223 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , and , for @xmath224 , we have @xmath225 due to our assumption . </S>",
    "<S> this and the @xmath4 estimates for the kernel of @xmath144 account for the first inequality here , and the second follows from the fact that @xmath226 , if @xmath227 , due to our assumptions about @xmath25 . by using the above estimate and young s inequality , one obtains .    to show it is valid for @xmath218 , choose @xmath228 satisfying @xmath229 , @xmath230 and @xmath231 , @xmath232 </S>",
    "<S> . then we can write @xmath233 where @xmath234 since @xmath235 if @xmath236 , due to huygens principle and our assumptions about @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> the operator with kernel equal to the first term in the formula for @xmath212 is obviously bounded from @xmath170 to itself with norm @xmath237 since @xmath187 has norm one . </S>",
    "<S> later we shall show , also using the hadamard parametrix , that @xmath238 with @xmath107 sufficiently small . </S>",
    "<S> using these facts and the fact that @xmath239 ( by ) , one deduces that also must hold for @xmath218 , which completes its proof ( apart from showing that and are valid as we shall do later ) .    </S>",
    "<S> since there are only @xmath240 , `` translates , '' @xmath241 , of @xmath201 that intersect any geodesic ball with arbitrary center of radius @xmath200 ( which was fixed earlier ) , are isometric , the volume , @xmath242 , of @xmath201 agrees with that of any @xmath241 , @xmath243 . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , if @xmath244 denotes the diameter of our dirichlet domain @xmath201 , then @xmath241 has the same diameter . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath245 denote the geodesic ball of radius @xmath200 about some point @xmath121 . </S>",
    "<S> then if @xmath246 , it follows from the triangle inequality that @xmath247 . </S>",
    "<S> as the @xmath241 are disjoint , the number of such domains intersecting the ball is therefore bounded from above by @xmath248 . since volume comparison theorems ( see , e.g. @xcite ) and our curvature assumptions imply that @xmath249 is bounded by the the volume of balls with this radius in hyperbolic space , @xmath250 , the assertion follows . ] </S>",

    "<S> , since all the calculations will be done in @xmath112 .    </S>",
    "<S> since there are @xmath258 nonzero @xmath209 for some fixed @xmath259 , we deduce that we would finish matters and obtain if we could choose the constant @xmath260 in definition of @xmath96 so that for large enough @xmath20 we have . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath261    we shall need to finally use toponogov s theorem to do this . </S>",
