    "giant flares are the most spectacular manifestations of soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) . their time histories are characterized by a very rapid ( @xmath1 1 ms ) rise to an intense peak lasting several hundred milliseconds , followed by a weaker , oscillatory phase which exhibits the period of the neutron star .",
    "the spectrum of the peak is very hard and extends to mev energies .",
    "the most energetic giant flare to date is that of 2004 december 27 from sgr1806 - 20 , with an isotropic energy of well over 10@xmath2 erg .",

    "the energetics of giant flares make it a virtual certainty that such events can be detected in distant galaxies , but recognizing them and demonstrating their origin beyond a reasonable doubt remain difficult tasks .",
    "predictions of the rates of extragalactic giant flares , and the percentage of short cosmic bursts which might actually be giant flares , vary widely ( from a few to @xmath3 15% - lazzati et al .",

    "however , they generally agree that the rate is small enough that the majority of short bursts are indeed not due to sgr giant flares . on the other hand , the rate is not expected to be zero , so it is important to examine all possible cases exhaustively . in this paper",

    "2004 ) in low - earth orbit ; the burst was outside the coded fields of view of swift - bat and the hete - ii imaging instruments , and was therefore not localized by them .",
    "it was also observed by integral spi - acs ( rau et al . 2005 ) at 0.5 light - seconds from earth , konus - wind ( aptekar et al . 1995 ) at 4.5 light - seconds from earth , and by mars odyssey ( hend and grs experiments , hurley et al .",

    "the rhessi time history of grb 051103 is shown in the top panel of figure 2 .",
    "a distinctive signature of all three previously observed giant sgr flares within our galaxy and the lmc to date is the periodic extended component following the initial short - duration peak . among these three events ,",
    "the periods of this extended tail have clustered around a narrow range of 58 seconds and also have a relatively narrow range of total isotropic energy releases of @xmath8 erg .",
    "this signal lasts for many minutes following the bursts but falls off rapidly after a few hundred seconds . while extended emission is frequently detected following cosmological short - hard bursts , such emission is not periodic",
    ". therefore detection of a periodic component of emission would be considered a strong confirmation of an sgr origin .",
    "none of the ipn light curves shows obvious evidence for extended emission ( pulsed or otherwise ) following the burst .",
    "however , it is conceivable that a marginally detected signal could be present within the noise . to search for such a component , we acquired swift - bat data for grb 051103 ( binned at 64 ms ) and used the lomb ( 1976 ) periodogram to calculate the relative power in the signal following the burst at periods up to about 20 seconds .",
    "we created periodograms for all of the four bat energy channels , which cover the energy range 15 to 350 kev ( and for combinations of channel sums ) and for various time ranges following the emission ( ranging from the first 60  s to the first 300  s. ) to assess the significance of any peaks in the power spectrum , we performed a monte carlo analysis by repeatedly randomizing the order of the 64 ms time bins for each data set over the range of interest and measuring the rate of occurrence of independent peaks above various power levels .",
    "we identified no peaks with greater than 98% significance in any channel or time range .",
    "this non - detection is expected . to assess the general detectability of periodic post - flare emission from extragalactic giant magnetar flares",
    ", we also acquired the swift - bat light curve of the the 2004 december 27th flare from sgr 1806 - 20 .",
    "we then scaled the signal down by a factor of @xmath9 and added it to the light curve of grb 051103 ( both scrambled and unscrambled ) .",
    "no signal is detected in the periodogram at the known periodicity of 7.56 seconds at the distance of m81/82 ( @xmath10 kpc ) .",
    "the maximum distance for detecting periodicity with our analysis greater than 3 sigma is only about @xmath11 kpc ( if a distance of @xmath12 kpc to sgr 1806 - 20 is assumed , or to 130 kpc if the 8.7 kpc distance of bibby et al .",
    "2008 is assumed ) , less than the distance even to m31 .",
    "this limit may not be exact : both sgr1806 - 20 and grb 051103 were detected off - axis by bat and the comparative satellite sensitivity will depend on the specifics of the off - axis angle . for the giant flare from 1806 - 20",
    ", bat was pointing 105away , and slewed to 61away starting around 38 s after the peak .",
    "for 051103 , bat was pointing 122from the source .",
    "however , as the expected signal from a december 27-like event at the distance of m81/m82 would be only 0.01 sigma assuming similar sensitivities for the two events , we consider it extremely unlikely that any possible angle outside the bat fov would lead to a detection unless the periodic component were several orders of magnitude stronger than that observed in the three galactic / lmc events to date .",
    "a key signature of the spectra of the three sgr giant flares observed to date is a very hard energy spectrum for the initial , several hundred millisecond long burst , and a dramatic spectral evolution to a soft spectrum for the subsequent pulsating component .",
    "as these bursts were observed by various instruments , with different temporal resolutions , spectral resolutions , and energy ranges , and all of them were in some degree of saturation at the peak , a precise description of the spectra is impossible .",
    "nevertheless , all of them can be characterized as very hard spectra at the peak , sometimes consistent with a very high temperature blackbody ( e.g. mazets et al .",

    "accordingly , we have analyzed the time - resolved energy spectra of grb 051103 .",
    "rhessi , konus , and suzaku obtained energy spectra for grb 051103 over a wide energy range , with good statistics , although with different time resolutions .",
    "( due to the off - axis arrival angles at swift and hete - ii , the detector response matrices are not well known , and we have not used these data . ) because the finest time resolution can be obtained from the rhessi data , we have analyzed the rhessi spectra both separately , to obtain the best time resolution , limited only by counting statistics , and combined with the konus and suzaku data , to obtain the best statistics , albeit at the cost of temporal resolution .",
    "rhessi uses nine unshielded coaxial germanium detectors to observe a broad energy band ( 30  kev17  mev ) with excellent energy ( 15  kev ) and time resolution ( 1 binary @xmath13s ) and moderate effective area ( @xmath3150  @xmath14 ) .",
    "the data are recorded event - by - event , which provides great flexibility in choosing analysis intervals .    to determine rhessi s spectral response to grb 051103",
    ", we used the monte carlo package mgeant ( sturner et al . 2000 ) .",

    "we fit a polynomial background and extracted the burst data in solarsoftware - idl routine .",
    "because of radiation damage to some of the detectors , we used only data from rear segments 1 , 4 , 6 , 7 , and 8 .",
    "spectral fitting was conducted with isis v1.4.9 ( houck 2000 ) . in general , the full 30  kev17  mev energy band was employed , except when sufficient counts could not be accumulated at high energies .",

    "this yielded three intervals , to which a fourth tail interval of s / n @xmath27 12 was added .",

    "the wam fluence is a factor of @xmath35 lower than the rhessi fluence ; this deficit appears to be a result of data lost due to deadtime during the intense peak of emission .",

    "( 2004 ) over the much wider konus energy range , of the 109 spectra which could be characterized by an e@xmath26 , none exceeded 2.53 mev .",
    "the peak energy of grb 051103 is approximately 3 mev ( table 1 ) .",
    "thus if grb 051103 is an sgrb rather than an sgr giant flare , it is a fairly extreme case .",
    "we compared the fluence of this burst to other sgrbs observed by the _",
    "swift _ satellite .",
    "table 3 provides the data of sgrb with fluences in the band 15 - 150kev and late optical observations , obtained from the relevant gcns , and measured optical afterglows in the r band , approximately 3 days after each burst . for two of the bursts it was necessary to estimate the fluence in the correct energy band using the same method as with grb 051103",
    "this is not a complete sample of sgrbs , as there are a number with a relatively low gamma - ray fluence that were either not observed optically , were not observed for longer than a few hours , or did not have a detected optical afterglow .",
    "we chose this sample so we did not have to rely on the assumption that we can extrapolate the light curve to later epochs and because they are of a similar gamma - ray fluence to grb 051103 .",
    "we compared the sgrbs in table 3 to grb 051103 and predict the optical afterglow would have an r band magnitude of @xmath51 as it is at the higher end of the fluence distribution .",
    "this is within the limiting magnitude of the kpno and cfhtls images used , but would have been unobservable in the images obtained by @xcite . as no afterglow was observed , this rules out most typical sgrbs in the region of the error ellipse covered by our imaging .",
    "however , there are cases of sgrbs with extremely faint optical afterglows , for example grb 080503 , which had a similar fluence to grb 051103 and an r band magnitude of 25.90@xmath290.23 at 3 days @xcite .",
    "so the observations can not rule out an unusually faint sgrb in this region similar to grb 080503 .",
    "additionally , grb 051103 could be a classical sgrb in the part of the error ellipse not studied in this paper .",
    "conversely , grb 051103 could be an sgr giant flare in m81 with similar energy to the giant flare from sgr 1806 - 20 @xcite and a very faint optical afterglow @xcite .",
    "using observations of the giant flare from sgr 1806 - 20 , we can predict the apparent optical magnitude of an sgr in m81 .",
    "the distance to sgr 1806 - 20 has proven difficult to determine ; the distance modulus adopted by many authors is 15.8 @xcite , although @xcite recently obtained a revised distance modulus estimate of 14.7@xmath290.35mag .",
    "here we continue to use the larger distance modulus as this will provide an approximate upper limit on the absolute magnitude .",
    "the giant flare from sgr 1806 - 20 had an observed radio afterglow and this has been used by @xcite to make predictions of the apparent r band magnitude of the afterglow .",
    "their analysis suggests that the giant flare would have had an apparent magnitude of @xmath52 at 3 days , and hence an absolute magnitude of @xmath53 . taking this as the absolute magnitude of any afterglow of grb 051103",
    "if it is an sgr giant flare , and using the distance modulus to m81 of 27.8 @xcite , we conclude the afterglow would be expected to have an apparent magnitude of @xmath54 . despite the many uncertainties involved in this calculation , we can have some confidence that such an afterglow would not be detectable with the data available . for future reference ,",
    "it is important to note that with more accurate positions and rapid follow up observations it may be possible to observe the optical afterglows of extragalactic giant flares . for example , if there were a second potential giant flare in m81 we predict the optical afterglow would have a peak apparent k band magnitude of @xmath320 at 86s after the giant flare and would fall to @xmath326 at 1 hour .",
    "this is observable with current and upcoming facilities , for example the european extremely large telescope ( e - elt ) .",
    "however , these predictions are based upon the theoretical models of sgr giant flares being similar to the blast wave model used to describe classical grbs .",
    "@xcite use the blast wave model and radio observations of the giant flare from sgr 1806 - 20 to extrapolate the optical afterglow .",
    "sgrs have been observed during periods of activity using rotse - i @xcite and _ swift _",
    "( for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and ir observations have been obtained for sgr 1900 + 14 4.1 days after outburst detecting no variability @xcite . these have provided upper limits on the optical afterglows from the softer spectrum , shorter , and weaker bursts seen during active phases of sgrs but it is important to note that there have been no reported rapid optical follow up observations of galactic sgr giant flares , which have a significantly higher fluence and are spectrally harder than these bursts .",
    "therefore , we are completely reliant on theoretical predictions and future observations may show discrepancies with these predictions .",
    "indeed , our observations with a limiting magnitude of 24.5 , giving an absolute magnitude -3.3 assuming it is at a distance of 3.6 mpc , constitute one of the deepest absolute magnitude searches for an afterglow from a possible sgr giant flare .",
    "this absolute magnitude is only exceeded by the search for an afterglow from grb 070201 , which is a candidate sgr giant flare in m31 , corresponding to an absolute magnitude of -7.4 obtained 10.6 hours after the burst @xcite .",
    "however , as we discuss later , it is unlikely that both of these events were sgr giant flares @xcite .    from the _ galex _ uv imaging @xcite",
    ", there is evidence that the error ellipse does contain star forming regions in the outer disk of m81 .",
    "the two brightest uv sources are marked on figure 6 @xcite .",
    "these young stellar regions in m81 could host an sgr which could emit a giant flare .",
    "similarly , these uv regions could be the locations of massive star clusters , and sgrs 1900 + 14 and 1806 - 20 have been associated with massive star clusters @xcite .",
    "however , if grb 051103 is an sgr giant flare in m81 , we might also expect to find a young ( up to @xmath55 years old , @xcite ) snr in the nearby region , although this association is still being debated @xcite .",
    "when an sgr is formed , it is theoretically possible that it is given a kick of up to @xmath56 km  s@xmath57 or more @xcite and therefore could have traveled a distance of @xmath5810pc from the snr .",
    "however , this is only equivalent to an angular separation of @xmath59arcsec at a distance of 3.6mpc @xcite .",
    "hence , an accompanying snr would still be expected to fall within the error ellipse . of the known snr in m81 @xcite , there are none within the error ellipse",

    "sgrs are well known to be quiescent soft x - ray emitters and @xcite have measured the soft x - ray flux of sgr 1806 - 20 to be approximately @xmath64erg  @xmath50  s@xmath57 .",
    "@xcite determined that the _ chandra observatory _ would be unable to observe directly the persistent x - ray flux from an sgr like sgr 1806 - 20 in m81 .",
    "an alternative method of searching for snr is to use h@xmath24 and oiii narrow band observations .",
    "the isaac newton telescope ( int ) has been used to search for planetary nebulae in m81 by @xcite and they have found 171 potential candidates , some of which are in the nearby region of the refined error ellipse .",
    "their criteria for differentiating between an snr and a planetary nebula is that planetary nebulae can not be spatially resolved and snr are . a young snr , as required for an sgr ,",
    "could be misidentified as a planetary nebula by this criterion , since a one arcsecond region corresponds to a physical size of @xmath65pc .",
    "young snrs may well be significantly smaller than this , since an expansion velocity of a few thousand km s@xmath57 over a magnetar lifetime of @xmath66 years leads to sizes of @xmath67 pc .",
    "indeed , many snrs in m82 appear ( based on radio maps ) to be fairly compact @xcite . however , the nearest is still @xmath323 arcsec from the error ellipse , and we showed earlier that an sgr in m81 would only be able to travel @xmath30.6 arcsec from its birthplace .",
    "the h@xmath24 luminosity of snrs in nearby disk galaxies tends to be greater than @xmath68 erg s@xmath57 @xcite and the work by @xcite had a limiting h@xmath24 flux of less than @xmath69 erg @xmath50 s@xmath57 which corresponds to a limiting luminosity of @xmath70 erg s@xmath57 .",
    "therefore , we would expect their survey to find a candidate snr .",
    "we used the recently published h@xmath24 and oiii images from the int wide field camera imaging survey @xcite , with a limiting luminosity of @xmath71 erg s@xmath57 at the distance of m81 as these are the same images as used by @xcite , and compared them with 21 cm radio images from things @xcite and chandra x - ray source positions @xcite to search for previously unidentified snrs within the error ellipse .",

    "the mechanisms underlying aic are poorly understood , and the physical characteristics and detectability of such remnants are not clear . therefore a sgr produced through this channel could be formed in an old stellar population within the outer disk or halo , and the non - detection of an snr within the region does not place constraints on this model .",
    "if the progenitor was an sgr giant flare , then there might be significant similarities in the light curve and spectrum of grb 051103 to the giant flare from sgr 1806 - 20 .",
    "@xcite noted that the light curve of these two events were consistent , i.e. the light curve of grb 051103 is similar to what would be expected from an extragalactic version of the giant flare from sgr 1806 - 20 . in table 1 , we have shown , for the joint rhessi + kw fits , that initially @xmath72 and softens to @xmath73 .",
    "although this is unusually hard for a grb , it is consistent with the photon index of the giant flare from sgr 1806 - 20 , @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "the peak luminosity of grb 051103 , assuming it was from an sgr in m81 , is approximately @xmath75 erg s @xmath57 .",
    "this is a factor of 10 brighter than the peak luminosity of the giant flare from sgr 1806 - 20 , which is @xmath76 erg s@xmath57 assuming it is at a distance of 15kpc @xcite . with the revised distance estimate from @xcite ,",
    "the peak luminosity of the giant flare from sgr 1806 - 20 would be @xmath77 erg s @xmath57 , suggesting that a much smaller percentage of sgrbs are sgr giant flares .",
    "this value is 30 times fainter than the peak luminosity of grb 051103 if it was from an sgr giant flare in m81 and in this case grb 051103 would be the most luminous sgr giant flare observed . in comparison ,",
    "the peak luminosity of grb 070201 is @xmath78 erg s @xmath57 assuming it was in m31 @xcite , which is an order of magnitude fainter than grb 051103 and comparable to the giant flare from sgr 1806 - 20 .",
    "it is important to note however , that there is currently no theoretical upper limit for the energy of a giant flare .",
    "@xcite showed that the total energy available is given by @xmath79 where @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , the magnetic dipole ( b ) of sgr 1806 - 20 would only need to increase by a factor of @xmath35 to produce a giant flare with an energy that is 30 times greater than the one from sgr 1806 - 20 .",
    "although the gamma - ray data suggest that grb 051103 may be an extragalactic sgr giant flare , it is important to note that sgr giant flares are rare events . considering plausible luminosity functions , @xcite calculated the probability that the ipn would observe a giant flare , with energy greater than the energy emitted by the giant flare from sgr 1806 - 20 , in the region surveyed during the 17 years it has operated . for one giant flare , they calculated the probability to be 10% .",
    "however , as we discussed in the introduction , there are four potential candidates for extragalactic sgr giant flares , including grb 070201 near m31 which has been identified as an sgr giant flare by @xcite .",
    "the probablility that the ipn has detected two sgr giant flares , with energy greater than the giant flare from sgr 1806 - 20 , is 0.6% @xcite .",
    "recently , several new sgr candidates have been identified including 0501 + 4516 , 1550 - 5418 and possibly 0623 - 0006 @xcite , which may imply that the number of sgrs in the milky way is higher than previously thought . in this case , the luminosity of the giant flare from sgr 1806 - 20 would have to be at the peak of the luminosity function of sgr giant flares and therefore giant flares of this luminosity must be extremely rare events .",
    "this argues that grb 051103 is unlikely to be a second sgr giant flare in the nearby universe .",
    "grb 051103 illustrates the difficulties of identifying a short burst as an extragalactic giant magnetar flare beyond a reasonable doubt . even setting aside the questions of detecting and localizing such events , and establishing their associations with nearby galaxies ,",
    "their interpretation is problematic . on the one hand ,",
    "the localization , short duration , and hard energy spectra of grb 051103 suggest that it is a giant flare from m81 .",
    "however , a deeper analysis of its time history demonstrates that the periodic component , which is a key signature of giant flares , is unlikely to ever be detected at great distances by the ipn if all giant flares are similar to the three observed to date .",
    "the energy spectrum at the peak of the emission is very hard ( e@xmath813 mev ) , and is detected to 7 mev at the 3@xmath4 level , with marginal emission up to 17 mev .",
    "yet it is not inconceivable that a short duration grb could have these properties .",
    "although the e@xmath26 of grb 051103 evolves from hard to soft , the evolution to a very soft spectrum , which is expected during the oscillatory phase of an sgr giant flare , is undetectable , as is the oscillatory phase itself .",
    "thus evidence for an extragalactic giant flare origin of grb 051103 remains tantalizing , but inconclusive . on a more positive note ,",
    "if an extragalactic magnetar flare occured within the swift - bat field of view , so that the xrt could begin observing within a minute or so , the periodic component would be detectable at low energies to at least 10 mpc ( hurley et al . 2005 ) .",
    "we have presented new optical observations of grb 051103 and have determined that there is no r band optical afterglow with a limiting magnitude of @xmath82 ( for an afterglow overlapping a host galaxy , the limiting magnitude is @xmath83 ) in the region of the error ellipse covered by our observations .",
    "comparison of the prompt emission of grb 051103 with a sample of other sgrbs leads us to conclude that if it was a classical sgrb we would expect to have located an optical afterglow in our observations .",
    "in contrast , if grb 051103 were an sgr giant flare in m81 , non - detection of an afterglow would not be surprising as the expectations for optical afterglow emission lie significantly below the limits obtained here , or the limits likely to be attained via current technology .",
    "the case for an sgr origin would be strengthened if there were an accompanying snr within the error ellipse , but there is no evidence of this .",
    "an sgr produced via accretion induced collapse of a wd @xcite would , however , remove the requirement for an snr .",
    "additionally , the luminosity of grb 051103 , assuming it is from an sgr giant flare in m81 , is significantly higher than known sgr giant flares but still attainable with current theoretical models .",
    "giant flares with luminosity similar to the giant flare from sgr 1806 - 20 are extremely rare and it is unlikely that grb 051103 and grb 070201 are both extragalactic sgr giant flares .",
    "although we have not considered this option in detail , it is possible that the progenitor of grb 051103 was a compact binary merger in m81 . in this case",
    ", it would just be within the reach of current gravitational wave searches .",
    "this scenario was ruled out at @xmath5899% confidence for grb 070201 in m31 using the laser interferometer gravitational - wave observatory ( ligo ) observations , and distances out to 3.5 mpc were ruled out to 90% confidence @xcite .",
    "the ligo scientific collaboration is currently considering a search for gravitational - wave signals in the data surrounding grb 051103 ( g. jones and p. sutton , private communication ) .",
