    "the effect of electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) is a nonlinear optical phenomenon which renders an opaque medium transparent at a certain frequency by exciting it with an electromagnetic field @xcite .",
    "this effect can occur generally in a 3-level atomic system , where the atomic states are coherently prepared by external laser fields .",
    "for example , in a @xmath0-type system ( see fig.1 ) , there are two dipole - allowed transitions @xmath1 and @xmath2 which are excited by a weak probing field , and a strong coupling field , respectively .",
    "when eit occurs , destructive interference among different transition pathways suppresses the transition probability between @xmath1 , leading to a spectrally sharp dip in the absorption spectrum . the corresponding steep dispersion within the transparency window results in a large reduction in the group velocity of light .",
    "as the steepness depends on the intensity of coupling field , eit thus provides an effective and convenient mechanism for slowing down the light in a controllable fashion .",
    "the slow light ( sl ) arising from the eit effect greatly enhances the nonlinear susceptibility and makes the low - light level nonlinear optics possible @xcite .",
    "the first experimental demonstration of sl produced by eit was made with high - power pulsed lasers interacting with a sr vapor @xcite . in 1999 , a dramatic reduction of the group velocity down  to 17 m/s was demonstrated by hau _ et al _ . by using a bose - einstein condensate of na atoms @xcite .",
    "an ultraslow group velocity of 8 m/s were later observed in a buffer - gas cell of hot rb atoms by budke _",
    "et al _ . @xcite .",
    "in a lossless , passive sample , the reduction of the propagation velocity implies a temporary transfer of electromagnetic excitations into the medium . with eit",
    ", the light pulse can even be completely stopped and stored in the medium by adiabatically switching off the coupling field and subsequently retrieved from the medium by the reverse process while the probe pulse is entirely within the sample making its way through marangos , bukder , fleischhauer , phillips .",
    "such storage and retrieval of photonic information are essentially reversible as they are resulted by the coherent transfer of the quantum state of light into the quantum coherence of the two ground states @xmath3and @xmath4 . the light storage ( ls )",
    "was experimentally demonstrated by several groups with various schemes liu , phillips , kocharovskaya , turukhin , which promises to be applied in the processing of quantum information , especially in the implementation of quantum storage devices , logical gates and generation of photonic qubits @xcite .",
    "so far , except only a few experiments were demonstrated in atomic bose - einstein condensates at nearly zero temperature @xcite , most experimental studies for eit were carried out at finite temperatures , using either hot atoms at room temperatures @xcite or laser - cooled atoms at temperatures about a few hundreds of microkelvin @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that at finite temperatures , the doppler - broadened medium inevitably imposes a serious limit since the doppler shifts caused by the atomic motion introduce a randomization in the effective laser detunings over the ensemble of atoms in the sample @xcite .",
    "experimental evidences indicate that even in the laser - cooled atoms , the decoherence due to the atomic motion still can not be ignored readily , especially when the applied external fields are in a counter - propagating geometry lin , peters .",
    "phenomenologically , the effect of doppler broadening can be addressed by including a relaxation term in the motion equation of @xmath5 . here",
    "@xmath6 denotes the off - diagonal element of the density operator which describes the quantum coherence of the two ground states @xmath7and @xmath8 . accordingly",
    ", a decay constant @xmath9 is thus introduced to account for the relaxation of ground - state coherence .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath9 is by no means a universal constant which depends on the temperature as well as on the experimental parameters such as the amplitudes of the driving fields and the particle density of the medium .",
    "normally , @xmath9 can only be determined by numerically fitting upon the experimental data .",
    "thus one has to recompute the numerical value of @xmath9 once the experimental parameters are altered in the new runs of experiment . in order to determine the dynamical properties of the system without introducing @xmath9 , it is desirable to develop a numerical scheme which is tractable and accessible to both theorists and experimentalists , and in this paper we address such an issue .",
    "in general , the atomic dynamics of the eit medium can be approached by employing the formalism of master equation in the linblad form , @xmath10+\\mathcal{d}\\left ( \\hat{\\rho}\\left ( t\\right ) \\right ) \\label{linblad}\\]]where @xmath11 is the density matrix of the 3-level atom , @xmath12 is the total hamiltonian , and @xmath13 is the dissipator of the master equation through which the relevant decaying processes such as the spontaneous emission and absorption can be specified .",
    "essentially , the medium is envisaged as a single , huge and stationary , 3-level atom , so that only the internal atomic degrees of freedom are considered in the last equation . to include the effects of nonrelativistic thermal random motion of atoms ,",
    "a plausible way is to add a doppler energy term @xmath14 directly to the hamiltonian in eq.(@xmath15 ) , where @xmath16 is the wave vector of the applied laser field , and @xmath17 is the relative velocity between the atom and the light source . on account of the thermal motion of atoms ,",
    "@xmath18 is randomized , and therefore the final solution of eq.(@xmath19 ) has to be determined _",
    "statistically_. denoting @xmath20 as the solution of eq.(@xmath15 ) with a given @xmath17 , then the desired density matrix can be obtained by taking average over all possible velocities which are typically described by maxwell - boltzmann distribution when the gas is at thermal equilibrium .",
    "it is expected that such an averaging process smears the atomic coherence and thus contributes to the overall effect of decoherence _ _  _ _ @xcite .",
    "we note that , for taking the effect of doppler shift into account the above formula is valid only when the atom  is stationary or , equivalently , when the frame of reference is fixed on the atom .",
    "as we aim to obtain the statistically averaged density matrix over an ensemble of identical eit systems moving with different velocities , a particular frame of reference must be specified in which each @xmath21 can be solved and properly  weighted on the common ground .",
    "this would involve the transformation of motion equations under the principle of galilean relativity .",
    "however , in the presence of driving fields , the atoms are by no means in constant motion as they do exchange momenta with the light fields by absorbing or emitting photons from time to time .",
    "furthermore , the atoms are liable to couple to vacuum via spontaneous emission of photons to all directions , giving rise to the random recoil of the atoms .",
    "these circumstances suggests that the moving atoms do not serve as an ideal frame of reference in our scheme .",
    "alternatively , we may seek to solve the matrix elements of all @xmath22 and carry out the ensemble average in the laboratory frame @xcite .",
    "in doing so , we might have to consider the sample gas as a lump of medium rather than a single atom .",
    "accordingly , it is more convenient to work in the framework of schrdinger equation instead of the master equation .",
    "there are two reasons : the gauge invariance of schrdinger equation under the galilean transformation are well understood .",
    "second , the kinetic energy can be naturally included in the schrdinger equation , so that the motional coupling , namely , the coupling between the external degrees of freedom and the internal degrees of freedom , can be restored and properly dealt with , although they are normally overwhelmed by the light - atom interaction .",
    "the details of the derivation of the motion equations will be described later .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we derive the general forms of the motion equations of the atomic medium under arbitrary galilean transformation boosted along the @xmath23-direction . the numerical results are presented in sec .",
    "comparison with experimental data are made . finally , some concluding remarks are given in sec .",
    "we consider a medium consisting of @xmath24-type 3-level atoms with two metastable ground states as shown in fig .",
    "1 . the atoms in this medium are all noninteracting and excited by two laser fields .",
    "the probe pulse , which drives the @xmath25 @xmath26 transition is characterized by a central frequency @xmath27 and a wave vector @xmath28 . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath29 @xmath30 transition is driven by another laser field with frequency @xmath31 and wave vector @xmath32 .",
    "for all practical purposes , the probe and couple fields can be applied with different relative orientation , depending on the experimental applications . for simplicity",
    ", we shall assume in the following derivations that the probe field propagates along the @xmath23 direction and the coupling field propagates with an angle @xmath33 with respect to the @xmath23-axis and the 3-level atoms are in a cigar - shaped trap which can be considered as an one dimensional system .",

    "we have ignored the transverse motion of the atoms in the @xmath54-plane since the gaussian probe pulse propagates along the @xmath23-direction only .",
    "it is convenient to describe the atomic properties by means of the local density operator @xmath55 whose matrix elements are defined as bilinear products of atomic fields , i.e. , @xmath56 .",
    "accordingly , the @xmath57-th diagonal matrix element corresponds to the density of atoms in the state @xmath42 . in the absence of any decaying process",
    ", the total density may be normalized to @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is total particle number and @xmath60 is the length of the system .",
    "the quantum coherence between the states @xmath61 and @xmath62 is represented by the off - diagonal matrix element @xmath63",
    ". in particular , the matrix element , @xmath6 , is of central importance in the current problem , which dominates the dynamics of the storage and retrieval of the probe light pulse .",
    "additionally , the coherence between @xmath64 and @xmath30 determines the propagation of the probe field inside the medium . in the slowly varying envelope approximation @xcite , the dynamics of the probe field",

    "note that eqs.(@xmath71)-(@xmath72 ) can be interpreted as the governing equations of a moving continuous medium seen by a co - moving observer , although they take the form of coupled schrdinger equations . in the nonrelativistic quantum mechanics",
    ", the galilean relativity ensures that the schrdinger equation is form - invariant under the galilean transformation , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , for any two frames of reference that are in relative uniform translational motion with a velocity @xmath17 @xcite . to be specific ,",
    "let us assume that the boosted system moves with a velocity @xmath75 relative to the laboratory frame .",

    "finally , we give a brief account for the numerical method which we have employed to integrate eqs.(@xmath115)-(@xmath116 ) .",
    "since we have used very high resolution to resolve the fine structures of the wave functions and the light pulse during their time evolutions , the commonly used second - order crank - nicolson method turns out to be inefficient in the current problem despite that it is unconditionally stable . owing to its implicitness in time",
    ", the crank - nicolson method would require an exceedingly large resultant matrix for the four coupled equations , eqs.(@xmath115)-(@xmath117 ) , when a high spatial resolution is demanded . with this regard ,",
    "explicit methods are more efficient for the current problem . here",
    "we use the method of lines with spatial discretization by highly accurate fourier pseudospectral method and time integration by adaptive runge - kutta method of orders 2 and 3 ( rk23 ) , such that the accuracy in time is at least of second order , and the accuracy in space is of exponential order . in the following numerical computations , we will first determine @xmath118 by numerical integration .",
    "having obtained all @xmath119 , we then calculate @xmath120 to determine the profile of @xmath121 at the instant @xmath122 .",
    "in this section , we apply the aforementioned scheme to simulate the effect of doppler broadening for both sl and ls , and compare the numerical results with the experimental data . before we present the results ,",
    "some remarks are given . to begin with ,",
    "let us consider the limiting case with @xmath123 and @xmath124 , where the shift @xmath125 in the right - hand - side of eq.(@xmath126 ) can be exactly cancelled out , indicating that the eit dynamics can be robust against the effect of doppler broadening when probe and couple are co - propagating .",
    "however , we note that in most experiments , @xmath127 differs from @xmath128 in the transition scheme , or a small @xmath33 is required to separate the weak probe and strong coupling fields in the detection scheme .",
    "this suggests that the effects of doppler broadening is inevitable in practical applications , despite that they are essentially small in the co - propagating situation . on the contrary , setting @xmath129 and @xmath130 , @xmath125 is maximized for all @xmath87 and can not be eliminated in any case and thus a substantial loss of ground - state coherence is expected in the counter - propagating geometry .",
    "regarding the fact that the decoherence is much pronounced in the latter case , plus that the counter - propagating eit is the central mechanism for generating stationary light pulses @xcite , here we restrict our attention on the counter - propagating eit .",
    "as a matter of fact , in our co - propagating eit experiment in which the effect of the thermal motion of the cold atoms is minimized , the decoherence rate is found to be less than @xmath131 ( @xmath132 mhz ) , indicating that the relaxations caused by some intrinsic effects , such as the stray magnetic field , collisions , and linewidth and frequency fluctuation of the laser fields , etc .",
    ", are very small which add up to give a decoherence rate less than * *  * * @xmath133**. * * such a small decoherence rate suggests that the decay of the output probe fields in our counter - propagating experiment are mainly from the thermal motion .",
    "in fact , adding such small decoherence rate in our calculation changes the numerical outcome very little and therefore we shall not consider the intrinsic decoherence in the numerical simulations .",
    "the comparisons between experimental data and numerical results of sl are made in fig.2 for three different experiments .",
    "we carried out the measurements in a cigar - shaped cloud of laser - cooled rb atoms @xcite in which the probe pulse and coupling field are counter - propagating along the major axis of the cloud .",
    "the rabi frequency @xmath44 and the optical density @xmath134 for the three samples are estimated to be @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 , @xmath140 respectively",
    ". both @xmath37 and @xmath141 are estimated by the method described in @xcite and have an uncertainty of about @xmath142 the probe pulses used in the experiment are sufficiently weak such that the corresponding rabi frequency in the calculation does not affect the prediction of the output probe pulse . in the numerical simulations with @xmath143 velocity groups , we set @xmath144 , @xmath136 , @xmath145 @xmath146k , @xmath147 * * , * * @xmath148 * * , * * @xmath149 * *  * * @xmath146k and @xmath150 * * , * * @xmath140 * * , * * @xmath151 * *  * * @xmath146k  to get the best fit for the three experiments of sl shown in fig.2(a)-2(c ) , respectively",
    ". it should be mentioned that the temperature of the sl experiment in fig.2(a ) * *  * * has been determined by another different numerical method to give the value of @xmath152 @xmath146k @xcite , which is very close to our prediction .",
    "the experimental data and numerical results of storage and retrieval of a light pulse are shown in fig.3 . in the simulations of fig.3",
    ", we only adjust the temperature to @xmath153 @xmath146k while keep the values of @xmath44 and @xmath141 in fig.2(a ) unchanged to get the best fit .",
    "the discrepancies in the temperatures obtained from the numerical simulations in fig.2(a ) and fig.3 are very reasonable as compared with the expected temperature and fluctuations of the laser - cooled rb atoms , yet @xmath44 and @xmath141 so obtained are in good agreement with the experimental parameters .",
    "therefore , we have quantitatively demonstrated the validity and accuracy of the numerical method presented in this work .",
    "in addition , we find this method can be used to determine the temperature along the major axis of the cigar - shaped atom cloud which we were not able to measure previously .",
    "the influence of the thermal effect is readily revealed by the considerably diminished intensity of the output probe beam . in fig.4(a ) , the intensity profiles of the output probe pulse at various temperatures are shown for sl .",
    "as expected , the output intensity decreases when the temperature increases .",
    "a simple explanation for this is that the higher the temperature , the broader the velocity distribution is .",

    "although @xmath165 can not be measured directly , its magnitude determines the intensity of the retrieved probe pulse when the coupling field is turned off .",

    "now let us consider the case of the storage time of @xmath170 @xmath146s for various temperatures @xmath171 @xmath146k .",
    "in the calculation , the probe pulse enters the medium under @xmath157 and @xmath172 both of which do not affect the decay behavior during the storage ; the input probe pulse and the timing of switching off the coupling field are the same as those shown in fig.3 .",
    "for such a storage time and atom temperatures the atomic thermal motion is expected to well smear the quantum memory of the probe pulse which is stored as the ground - state coherence . because eq.(@xmath173 ) is a function of @xmath23 and @xmath122 and the time - dependence only comes from the gaussian function , to eliminate the @xmath23 dependence of the ground - state coherence , we plot the function @xmath174 in fig.5 .",

    "furthermore , we have verified that @xmath178 , and the close agreement with the theoretical predictions of eq.(@xmath173 ) are also shown in fig.5 . since the thermal motion would randomize the spatial profile of the ground - state coherence during the storage , the intensity of the retrieved probe pulse is thus much smaller than the stored one as shown in fig.3 .",
    "the ground - state coherence for sl can be studied in a similar manner .",
    "it is expected that the ground - state coherence decays more slowly in sl than in ls , since the continuous optical excitations from the coupling field can retard the loss of atomic coherence led by the randomization of atoms thermal motion .",
    "we simulate the process of sl with @xmath179 @xmath180 , and @xmath181 at various temperatures .",

    ", we shall assume that the eit transparency bandwidth is much larger than the frequency bandwidth of the probe pulse , such that the decay of the probe pulse or the ground - state coherence is mainly determined by the absorption in the center of the transparency window of the eit spectrum . because all decoherence mechanisms other than the atomic thermal motion are neglected , the steady - state solution of @xmath109 of a rest eit medium is given by @xcite     @xmath162 , @xmath136 , @xmath163 @xmath155k for ls .",
