    "<S> we report on magnetization , c - axis and ab - plane resistivity , critical current , elec-    troni band structure and superconducting gap properties . </S>",
    "<S> bulk measurements and    photoemission data were taken on similar samples .    </S>",
    "<S> resistivity ; band structure ; superconducting gap ; symmetry .    </S>",
    "<S> i have two purposes in writing this report . </S>",
    "<S> one is to provide experimental data that has been reproduced in different laboratories , and so can be viewed as reliable , to serve as the basis for theoretical models . </S>",
    "<S> the other is to argue that there is a close connection between changes observed in the superconducting properties ( gap size and temperature dependence , critical current , magnetic field dependence ) and normal state properties ( symmetry of electronic states , topology of fermi surface , c - axis resistivity ) .    in our studies , </S>",
    "<S> we have found c - axis resistivity data versus oxygen content that are consistent with and extend earlier reports.[1 - 4 ] note that the c - axis resistivity is reduced by a factor of as much as @xmath0 for overdoped compared to underdoped samples . </S>",
    "<S> however , neither we nor our colleagues [ 1 - 4 ] have yet incorporated sufficient oxygen to observe fully metallic @xmath1 behavior for all temperatures down to the superconducting transition temperature ( @xmath2 ) , as has been observed for ybco-123.[5 ] the significant point to these measurements is that there is a marked change in the c - axis resistivity , and hence interlayer coupling , with oxygen stoichiometry .    for the same samples for which we measured c - axis resistivity </S>",
    "<S> , we also performed angle - resolved photoemission measurements of the normal state.[4 ] the issue was to determine whether samples that exhibited the change in c - axis resistivity also exhibited any differences in their fermi surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> we have reported elsewhere [ 6 ] that there is a finite interlayer coupling between the adjacent @xmath3 planes of the bilayer . </S>",
    "<S> we chose pb - doped bscco-2212 samples . by performing careful tem measurements,[4 ] </S>",
    "<S> we determined that the overdoped and underdoped samples were isostructural in the @xmath3 ( ab-)planes . the only structural difference is a change in the periodicity of the superlattice modulation , with the overdoped samples exhibiting a larger period . </S>",
    "<S> we found that there is a change of symmetry in the normal state quasiparticle band states as the amount of oxygen is changed . specifically , the electronic states that comprise the fermi surface in the @xmath4 directions exhibited a change in symmetry with oxygen stoichiometry , while the symmetry of the states in the @xmath5 and @xmath6 directions was unaffected by the oxygen stoichiometry . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate one of two possibilities . </S>",
    "<S> one is that the c - axis ( interlayer coupling ) affects the symmetry of the electronic states . </S>",
    "<S> the other possibility is that the electronic states arise due to many - body effects.[7 ] if the electronic states are interpreted as many - body states,[7 ] preliminary calculations indicate that interactions beyond the nearest - neighbor must be included to explain the data.[7 ]    in addition to the symmetry of the normal state electronic states , our data indicate two other important points about the   fermi  surface </S>",
    "<S> . we   find    @xmath7that there is an   extended   van hove   singularity,[8 ] consistent with other reports.[9 - 11 ] the extent of the singularity is reduced for overdoped samples.[4 ] a pocket , absent for underdoped samples , develops around the @xmath8 point for overdoped samples,[4,8 ] consistent with earlier work by c. olson and colleagues.[12,13 ] further , it is noteworthy that p. aebi and colleagues have used our samples to study the presence and strength of the shadow bands they reported earlier.[14 ] in their previous work,[14 ] they reported observing shadow bands only on samples that were particularly flat and well - ordered ( to reduce scattering that averages over the brillouin zone ) . using our samples , they find such shadow bands , and find that the shadow bands are weaker , but present , for the overdoped samples ( @xmath2 = 75 k ) compared to the underdoped samples ( @xmath2 = 80 k).[15 ] these data indicate that both the symmetry of the fermi surface electronic states , and the topology of the fermi surface , change with oxygen doping .    </S>",
    "<S> note that we have found results consistent with other investigators for those measurements where consistency is expected . </S>",
    "<S> for that reason , our results as to the symmetry and topology of the fermi surface electronic states appear representative of samples in different laboratories . as an additional check of our samples </S>",
    "<S> , we have studied the current versus voltage measurements for supercurrent along the c - axis and applied magnetic field in the ab - plane.[16 ] the issue is whether the change in c - axis resistivity , and fermi surface electronic states , both normal state properties , are related to superconducting state properties .    </S>",
    "<S> we found that for our samples , the @xmath3 planes are stacked very close to parallel , with an ab - plane misalignment below 0.02 degrees . </S>",
    "<S> this allowed us to orient the applied magnetic field parallel to the ab - plane with high accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> the results at lower magnetic fields ( below 1 tesla ) reproduce earlier work by kleiner et.al.[17,18 ] for underdoped samples , the data indicate a s - i - s josephson junction stacking of planes along the c - axis . for overdoped samples , the critical current density increases between @xmath9 and the stacking </S>",
    "<S> is s - n(s)-s . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate a marked increase in critical current density for overdoped samples , the same samples that exhibit the changes in normal state properties .    </S>",
    "<S> however , neither our results [ 16 ] nor those of our colleagues , [ 17,18 ] conclusively establish whether the c - axis coupling in overdoped samples is josephson - junction or three dimensional . </S>",
    "<S> one new , and pertinent , result is that overdoped samples obey the kim - stevens relation,[19 ] as do three- dimensional superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> we found @xmath10 is already 14 tesla only 4 k below @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> [ 16 ]    in magnetization studies of cuprate superconductors , much has been made of the `` fishtail '' behavior,[20 - 22 ] a region of applied magnetic field for which the magnetization increases with increasing applied field . using samples similar to those used in photoemission studies , x.y . </S>",
    "<S> cai _ et al._[22 ] reported that the fishtail exists for both underdoped and overdoped samples , although such samples exhibit very different quantitative magnetization response . </S>",
    "<S> the data were interpreted as indicating that there are always stronger and weaker superconducting regions . </S>",
    "<S> these are the same sample types described above . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the fact that all samples exhibit the fishtail behavior indicates that all samples exhibit both stronger and weaker superconducting regions .    </S>",

    "<S> * photoemission spectra in the normal state along the @xmath12 direction for he - annealed , pb - doped sample ( gap = 0 - 2 mev ) and oxygen - annealed , overdoped sample ( gap = 10 - 12 mev).[27 ]    for the same sample types , we also conducted angle - resolved photoemission measurements of the size of the superconducting gap for two high - symmetry directions , @xmath5 ( cu - o - cu bond axis in real space ) and @xmath13 ( bi - o - bi bond axis perpendicular to superlattice modulation).[23,24 ] figure one illustrates the results . </S>",
    "<S> we found that for samples with less oxygen , particularly if underdoped , the gap along @xmath13 is indistinguishable from zero ( @xmath14 mev ) , consistent with earlier reports by b.o . </S>",
    "<S> wells and z .- x . </S>",
    "<S> shen.[25,26 ] however , for overdoped samples , the data indicate unambiguously that the superconducting gap in the @xmath13 direction is non - zero.[27 ] observing a non - zero gap in the @xmath13 direction has also been reported earlier by several research groups.[28 - 31 ] </S>",
    "<S> one significant point is that this study is the first to directly connect the size of the superconducting gap and the bulk critical current and magnetization properties of a cuprate superconductor system .    </S>",

    "<S> 2 . </S>",
    "<S> * superconducting gap ( in mev ) versus temperature for @xmath5 direction ( diamonds ) and @xmath13 direction ( squares).[32 ]    these results can be regarded as solid , because they either reproduce earlier work or have been independently confirmed by other investigators , including other investigators using our samples.[15 ] the last experimental result that we wish to report is the temperature and momentum - resolved study of the superconducting gap for oxygen overdoped samples.[32 ] we studied the variation of the superconducting gap with temperature for two brillouin zone directions , @xmath5 and @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> figure two illustrates the results . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the temperature dependence of the superconducting gap along the two symmetry directions is qualitatively different . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the gap along the @xmath13 direction becomes indistinguishable from zero at @xmath15 , while along @xmath5 the gap remains at 90 - 100% of its value at @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> some parts of the data in fig . 2 have been independently confirmed . </S>",
    "<S> the rapid , non - bcs , increase of the gap with decreasing temperature in the @xmath5 direction has been confirmed by j.c . </S>",
    "<S> campuzano and colleagues.[33 ] the non - zero gap in the @xmath13 direction at lower temperatures has been reported earlier.[28 - 31 ]    what inferences can be drawn that are based strictly on data reproduced in different laboratories ? </S>",
    "<S> i am confident of the following :    * saying that the symmetry of the order parameter ( gap ) remains identical for all stoichiometry has been ruled out;[27 - 29,31 - 34 ] * there is a marked increase in interlayer coupling for overdoped samples , as reflected in bulk measurements [ 1 - 4,16 - 18 ] and the symmetry of the normal state electronic states;[6 ] * the shadow bands reported earlier by p. aebi et.al . </S>",
    "<S> [ 14 ] are observed for samples from different laboratories , and exist well into the overdoped regime;[15 ] * the gap increases more rapidly for temperatures below @xmath2 than a would a bcs superconductor.[32,33 ]    in addition , if all the results of of ref . </S>",
    "<S> 32 are confirmed by independent work , these results indicate that , for overdoped samples , just below @xmath2 there may be only d - wave pairing , while at lower temperatures a more complicated pairing interaction exists . however , for underdoped samples , the small value of the gap along the @xmath13 direction ( at @xmath16 ) indicates that a predominant d - wave pairing extends to lower temperature .    </S>",
    "<S> various parts of the work reported were performed in collaboration with , above all , my students and postdocs , jian ma , ronald kelley and christoph quitmann , as well as with other colleagues , including cai xueyu , yi feng , david larbalestier , philippe almeras , helmut berger , and giorgio margaritondo . </S>",
