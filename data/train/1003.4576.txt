    "the exponential increase of density of states is well known in nuclear physics ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "similar problem in atomic physics has not been considered so far .",
    "it is well - known that the density of the rydberg levels ( with one excited electron ) tends to infinity at ionization limit .",
    "however , there are also compound states with several excited electrons . as we will see below , the density of such states increases exponentially with the excitation energy",
    ".    the concept of the density of states @xmath0 can be especially useful for the cases of the dense and complicated spectrum .",
    "this takes place for practically any many - electron atom at sufficiently high excitation energies , in particular at energies close or above the ionization limit .",
    "in the latter case we speak about density of feshbach resonances corresponding to the quasi - stationary compound states with several excited electrons . for atoms with open @xmath1 or @xmath2 shells",
    "the spectrum is complicated even at low energies .",
    "experimental data for highly excited states are often absent .",
    "accurate calculations using specific atomic states in the area of dense spectrum is very difficult if not impossible .",
    "even identification of such states is often problematic . on the other hand , statistical approaches , which use functions obtained by averaging over large number of states ,",
    "can be very useful .",
    "an interesting case was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite where properties of excited states of cerium atom were studied using statistical analysis .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the ce atom is an example of quantum chaotic system in which highly excited states are similar to compound states of heavy nuclei .",
    "density of states @xmath3 is used in the criteria for the chaos to take place : @xmath4 . here",
    "@xmath5 is the off - diagonal matrix element of the effective hamiltonian between many - electron states @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is the energy interval between the states which can be mixed by @xmath5 .",
    "statistical theory based on the properties of chaotic eigenstates @xcite allows one to calculate average orbital occupation numbers , matrix elements and amplitudes between chaotic states , enhancement of weak interactions and increase of entropy .",
    "another important example is the effect of atomic electrons on nuclear transitions , which will be considered below .",
    "the concept of the density of states is also needed to estimate a number of states missed in experimental spectra . in this paper",
    "we present simple analytical estimates explaining exponential increase of density of states containing several excited electrons .",
    "then we perform numerical calculations of density of compound states using thorium as an example due to its importance for the construction of nuclear clock .",
    "the proposed clock  @xcite utilizes the use of the nuclear transition between a metastable isomeric state and the ground state of @xmath9th .",
    "the frequency of this transition is unusually low , about 7 ev , and can be accessed by lasers .",
    "additional interest is due to the fact that this transition must be very sensitive to the time - variation of the fine structure constant  @xcite .",
    "the effect of electrons on the nuclear transition in th ii and th iv ions , also known as _ electronic bridge _ process , was considered in refs .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in this process",
    "the nuclear transition is accompanied by an electron transition from the ground state to an exited state followed by emission of the photon .",
    "the electronic bridge process may have significant effect on the performance of the nuclear clock in the case of resonance between nuclear and atomic transitions .",
    "however , neither nuclear frequency nor electron spectrum are known sufficiently well to make reliable estimations",
    ". the measured values for the frequency of the nuclear transition varies form @xmath10 ev  @xcite to @xmath11  @xcite",
    ". electron spectrum of th  ii is also not known at energies around 7.6 ev . in this situation instead of calculating the value of the electronic bridge process one can consider estimation of the probability for the result to be within some range of values .",
    "this can be done if density of electron states as a function of the energy is known .",
    "knowledge of the electron spectrum density in th  ii is also needed for the accurate measurements of the nuclear transition frequency .",
    "e. peik and collaborators  @xcite plan to use laser excitation of a th  ii electron state which may transfer part of the excitation energy to induce the nuclear transition .",
    "let us consider an open ground electron shell containing @xmath12 electrons and @xmath13 single - electron states ; usually @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the orbital angular momentum of a single - electron state within this shell .",
    "a total number of many - body states within this shell is equal to the binomial coefficient , @xmath16}}{\\sqrt{(2 \\pi n ) } }   .\\ ] ] in the last expression we assumed @xmath17 and used the stirling formula @xmath18 which gives an excellent accuracy even for @xmath19 ( the correction is @xmath20 ) .",
    "assume for simplicity that all these many - body states have approximately the same energy .",
    "let us now consider next electron shell which is separated from the ground state shell by a single - particle energy interval @xmath21 and has @xmath22 single - electron states . if a total excitation energy of a many - electron state is equal to @xmath23 , we may transfer @xmath24 electrons from the ground shell to the next shell .",
    "now we have a total number of many - electron states @xmath25 here the first factor @xmath26 gives the number of ways to select @xmath27 excited electrons from the available @xmath12 electrons , the second factor gives the number of many - body states in the ground shell and the last factor gives the number of many - body states in the next shell . for @xmath28 @xmath29 } } { 2      \\pi k}\\right ) \\\\ & = & n_0 + \\frac{a}{e}\\exp{(be ) } \\ , , \\label{eq : exp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 } } } { 2 \\pi \\sqrt{(2 \\pi n)}}\\ ] ] @xmath31}+2}{\\omega}\\ ] ] this rough estimate shows that the number of compound states increases exponentially with the number of electrons in the open shell @xmath12 and with the number of excited electrons @xmath24 .",
    "inclusion of the electron excitations to higher shells and the rydberg spectrum of the single - electron excitations will only make the number of states larger .",
    "the derivation of formula ( [ eq : exp ] ) assumes that the number of electrons @xmath12 in the open shell is large .",
    "we will see below that the exponential increase of the density of states takes place even for @xmath12 as small as three .",
    ".number of states of even parity and total momentum @xmath32=1.5 in 10000  @xmath33 energy intervals in th ii .",
    "[ cols=\">,^ , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     the density of states must go to infinity when energy is approaching ionization potential .",
    "this is due to the infinite number of rydberg states which all have about the same energy , close to the ionization potential .",
    "in contrast , the number of calculated states goes down at large energies .",
    "this is the cut - off effect of the single - electron basis . adding more highly excited orbitals into the basis increases the number of many - electron states at high energy ( see table  [ t : nos ] ) .",
    "ionization potential of th  i is 50867  @xmath33 = 0.23  a.u .",
    "@xcite while the one for th  ii is about 96000  @xmath33 = 0.44  a.u .  @xcite . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ f : tro ] the fitting works very well for the energies very close to the ionization potentials of th  ii and th  i. at higher energies more basis states must be included .",
    "now we can use the density function to estimate the probability of the electronic bridge process in th  ii . according to ref .",
    "@xcite the ratio @xmath34 of the electron bridge width to the width of the direct nuclear transition ( the electron enhancement factor ) is @xmath35 where @xmath12 is the resonance electron state , @xmath21 is the photon frequency , @xmath36 is the frequency of the nuclear transition , @xmath37 is the total angular momentum of the resonance state , @xmath38 is the total angular momentum of the ground state ( @xmath39=1.5 in our case ) , @xmath40 is the combination of the electron matrix elements for electric dipole and hyperfine transitions between atomic ground state , resonance state @xmath12 and some odd - parity low lying final atomic state , @xmath41 is the frequency of the electron transition from the ground to the resonance state , @xmath36 is the frequency of the nuclear transition .",
    "resonance corresponds to the condition @xmath42 .",
    "as it was discussed in the introduction the exact value for the nuclear frequency is not known and the experimental values range from 3 ev to 8  ev .",
    "estimation of the effect for 3.5 and 5.5 ev were performed in ref .",
    "the effect for higher @xmath36 was not presented since the electron spectra are not known for such energies .",
    "here we perform the estimation for the latest measured value @xmath36 = 7.6  ev = 0.28  a.u .",
    "using formula ( [ eq : e1 ] ) and the data from table  [ t : fit ] we find that the average energy interval between the relevant electron states is @xmath43  a.u at this energy .",
    "the energy denominator in ( [ eq : g1 ] ) is at least two times smaller .",
    "therefore , the electron enhancement factor is @xmath44 here we use the root mean square value for @xmath40 which is @xmath45  a.u . for the energies above 7  ev  @xcite . an interesting effect",
    "may take place for neutral thorium if the frequency of the nuclear transition is smaller than the ionization potential of the atom .",
    "the density of states of th  i is huge and the resonance situation is highly probable .",
    "this can be used to excite the nucleus in a two - step process in which a resonance electron state is excited first , then it gives its energy to excite the nucleus .",
