    "the past twenty years have seen a tremendous revolution in how we study the origin and evolution of our universe . on the one hand developments in theoretical particle physics",
    "have lead to a proliferation of ideas on how high energy physics might have an observable effect on the large scale structure of our universe . on the other hand",
    "the increasing quality of astrophysical data has led to firm constraints on what physics is allowed in the early universe .",
    "probably the most impressive example of such an interplay is how the cobe detection @xcite has affected the most popular and theoretically explored theory of structure formation , the standard cold dark matter model ( scdm ) .",
    "the scdm model brings together the idea of inflation @xcite and the picture of large scale gravitational collapse @xcite .",
    "a period of superluminal expansion of the universe would have led to the amplification of subhorizon vacuum fluctuations to superhorizon scales .",
    "the net result would be a set of scale invariant , gaussian perturbations which would evolve , through gravitational collapse , into the structures we see today .",
    "the relic radiation bears an imprint of these fluctuations from when the universe recombined .",
    "the distribution of galaxies and clusters of galaxies should reflect these fluctuations today .",
    "it has been found however that the scdm model can not successfully accommodate the data observed on all scales . matching its predictions to cobe measurements ( on large scales ) of the microwave background , one finds that the amplitude of fluctuations on @xmath9h@xmath10mpc scales ( where h is the hubble constant today in units of @xmath11km / s / mpc ) do not match those observed@xcite . to be more specific , if we define the amplitude of mass fluctuations in a sphere of radius @xmath9h@xmath10mpc , @xmath12 , then cobe normalized scdm predicts @xmath13 while the measured value ( through cluster abundances ) is @xmath14 , a discrepancy by a factor of 2 .",
    "further not only the amplitude but also the _ scale dependence _ of the scdm model differs from the one measured @xcite , and there are also a number of problems with the non - linear evolution of baryons and velocities on small scales .    these failings of scdm have led to attempts to modify it , while keeping its basic features intact . the latter ( a simple choice of background cosmological parameters with @xmath6 and quantum generation of fluctuations ) are associated with its theoretical motivation from inflation .",
    "the most prominent candidate theories of structure formation of this type are now a universe with a cosmological constant ( @xmath15cdm ) @xcite and a universe with a fifth of its dark matter component in two families of massive neutrinos ( mdm)@xcite .",
    "models of structure formation in an open universe ( ocdm ) , for which there is considerable evidence , have also been extensively studied @xcite .",
    "all these models , once cobe normalized , predict the approximately correct distribution of mass fluctuations . over the past few years other flat models have been constructed which , like mdm , are more related to our understanding of fundamental particle physics .",
    "this is the case of decaying cosmological constant models @xcite and decaying massive particles @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , unlike the scdm scenario , all these models involve a tuning of parameters which is unnatural from the point of view of particle physics , simply because one is using super - gev physics to explain sub - ev observations .",
    "just as is the case of @xmath15cdm ( which involves tuning the cosmological constant to be relevant only at present epochs ) this tuning does not provide a reason to discard these models , but is a very unattractive feature of them .",
    "both the cosmology of weakly coupled scalar fields and their theoretical motivation have been much studied since the advent of the idea of inflation . in most of the theoretical particle physics extensions of the standard model ( e.g. supersymmetry and supergravity ) weakly coupled scalar fields of various kinds are ubiquitous .",
    "unfortunately there is as yet no experimental evidence for the existence of any fundamental scalar field at all , in particular the higgs particle of the standard model remains to date undetected .",
    "however the theoretical motivation for such scalar fields is sufficiently compelling that it is certainly worthwhile considering what consequences their existence might have for cosmology beyond the confines of inflation .",
    "an example of this is given by the main alternative of structure formation - defect theories - which usually involve the existence of some scalar field e.g. the ` texture ' theory @xcite relies on the existence of a scalar field invariant under a global non - abelian symmetry broken at the gut scale , with associated goldstone particles which are unobservably weakly coupled to ordinary matter .",
    "the role that a weakly coupled scalar field might play in late time cosmology if it contributes a component to the homogeneous background energy density of the universe has also been investigated . in @xcite",
    "the authors considered in general terms the idea that a significant contribution to the energy density from a homogeneous scalar field could have an important effect on structure formation , and applied the idea to a baryonic universe with a initial spectrum of perturbations with power law behaviour . after some general analysis of the homogeneous dynamics , the model singled out for a detailed treatment was that of a scalar field in a negative power law potential which comes to dominate at late times , producing behaviour very similar to that associated with a cosmological constant .",
    "another kind of model which has been developed in detail , for the case of a cold dark matter dominated cosmology , in @xcite involves a cosine potential with a combination of planck and sub @xmath16 physics .",
    "this provides a specific realisation of a ` decaying cosmological constant ' , in which the field initially behaves like a cosmological constant and then rolls so that it scales asymptotically like matter .",
    "all these models have an energy density in the scalar field which comes to dominate at late times , as have two more recent very detailed studies @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the case of a scalar field which scales slower than matter is described more generically in terms of its equation of state , and in @xcite the specific cases of late time dominance realized in both cosine and exponential potentials .    in this paper we present in detail the results which have been reported in @xcite .",
    "the model we study is scdm with the addition of a scalar field @xmath0 with a simple exponential potential @xmath1 where @xmath17gev is the reduced planck mass , and @xmath3 . in this specific case",
    "there is a very special and interesting solution for matter and radiation coupled through gravity to this field , in which the scalar field energy follows that of the dominant component , contributing a fixed fraction of the total energy density determined by @xmath5 .",
    "the existence of this homogeneous solution was shown in @xcite . because the scalar field can contribute at most a small fraction of the total energy density at nucleosynthesis",
    ", its potential interest in the context of the problem of structure formation has been overlooked .",
    "this constraint suggests _ prima facie _ that the field in such an attractor can have little effect on cosmology at late time . as we shall see , this is incorrect , for the simple reason that a small contribution acting over a long time can have as big an effect as a large contribution entering only at late times .",
    "the particular merit of the model is related to the fact that the cosmological solution is an attractor for the scalar field : because of this , there is no tuning of the type involved in _ all _ other proposed modifications of scdm .",
    "the only parameter additional to scdm is @xmath5 , and the value @xmath18 which gives a best fit to structure formation , is of the order naturally expected in the particle physics models in which the potential arises . as a cosmology it resembles mdm much more than any of the scalar field models which have been studied in the literature .",
    "some comment is perhaps necessary at the outset regarding the assumption that the universe is flat and dominated by a component scaling as matter , as there is mounting observational evidence that this is not the case .",
    "the most advertised is the age problem , that is , the fact that we see objects which are older than the age of the universe if we assume a flat matter dominated universe with the currently observed hubble constant of @xmath19kms@xmath10mpc@xmath10 .",
    "several of the modifications we have discussed ( in particular the cosmological constant model and some of the scalar field models ) avoid this problem since the dominant component at the present epoch is not matter .",
    "the recent measurements of the hipparcos satellite @xcite seem to indicate that the age of these objects have been overestimated by around 10@xmath20 and a re - analysis of the uncertainties in the estimates seem to indicate that a flat matter dominated universe with @xmath21kms@xmath10mpc@xmath10 is compatible with the current age estimates .",
    "another argument for a low density universe comes from the analysis of large scale flows . in @xcite",
    "it has been argued that @xmath22 from the analysis of the mark iii data and comparison with the iras surveys .",
    "however there is concern with the self consistency of the velocity data and another group @xcite indicates that the the flows are consistent with a universe with @xmath23 .",
    "small scale observations also seem to indicate that there are problems with a high density universe .",
    "in particular the baryon fraction in clusters is difficult to reconcile with the bbn limits unless one considers a low density universe @xcite .",
    "again there are uncertainties in such an analysis ; they rely on elaborate numerical simulations which are at the limit of current computational power .",
    "it is conceivable that some physics ( such as cooling of the cluster medium ) is being overlooked .",
    "the same can be said for the cold velocity dispersion which is measured on few mpc scales @xcite .",
    "although all these observations together begin to make a strong case for an open universe , the uncertainties and inconsistencies are sufficiently large for us to still consider a high density , matter dominated universe . it may be that in the next few years the evidence is sufficiently compelling to rule out these models , but this is definitely not the case yet .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section [ pp ]",
    "we first discuss the homogeneous modes of scalar fields in a universe with matter and radiation in general terms , and explain how the case of a simple exponential with its attractor solutions for @xmath24 is a special one .",
    "we discuss briefly the possible origin of exponential potentials in fundamental theories .",
    "we then discuss the initial conditions on this scalar field in the early universe , and when these lead the attractor to be established . in typical inflationary theories",
    "we argue that the attractor describes the homogeneous cosmology well before nucleosynthesis , while in an alternative theory of reheating which can be realised with the same exponential field the scalar field may still be negligible at nucleosynthesis for natural parameter values . in section [ pert ]",
    "we analyse the evolution of perturbations in our scenario .",
    "we describe the complete set of equations which govern their evolution and analyse the asymptotic behaviour in the interesting regimes . the similarities with evolution of density fluctuations in an mdm universe lead us to pursue the comparison in some detail and we come to the conclusion that scalar field is more effective at suppressing perturbations than hot dark matter .",
    "we also consider the effect on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and deconstruct the different effects it has on the angular power spectrum of the cmb . in section [ data ] we compare the predictions of linear perturbation theory ( using the full boltzmann - einstein equations ) with some observations .",
    "in particular we compare it to the cobe data and then use this comparison to normalize the theory and compare to the peacock and dodds data . as a byproduct we derive a fit to @xmath12 for our models",
    "and we quantify the amount of structure on small scales and high redshift , comparing with constraints derived from lyman-@xmath8 systems . in [ conc ] we summarise our findings and draw some conclusions about future prospects for our model and other issues related to it which might be further investigated .",
    "in this section we describe in detail the homogeneous attractor solutions which specify the zero - order cosmology , about which we treat perturbations fully in the subsequent part of the paper .",
    "we explain the very special feature of this model which contrasts it with other scalar field cosmologies which have been treated in the literature : _ no special energy scale characteristic of late time cosmology need be invoked to produce the required solution_. we will show that for a very wide and natural range of initial conditions on the scalar field in the very early universe , the attractor will be attained as early as assumed in the rest of the paper .",
    "we begin with a general discussion of homogeneous frw cosmology in which there is , in addition to the usual matter and radiation content , a contribution to the energy momentum coming from a scalar field @xmath0 with a potential @xmath25 . in the rest of the paper we use the notation @xmath26 , where @xmath27 denotes the perturbation about the homogeneous solution @xmath28 . working for the moment in comoving coordinates",
    "in which the metric is @xmath29 ( where @xmath30 is the scale factor ) , the contribution to the energy - momentum tensor from the scalar field is @xmath31 \\qquad p_{\\phi}=\\left [ { 1 \\over 2 } { \\dot \\phi}^2- v(\\phi)\\right ] . \\label{background1}\\ ] ] the equations of motion for the scalar field are then @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the energy density in radiation ( @xmath34 ) or non - relativistic matter ( @xmath35 ) , @xmath36 is the hubble expansion rate of the universe , dots are derivatives with respect to time , primes derivatives with respect to the field @xmath28 , and @xmath37gev is the reduced planck mass .",
    "the scalar field is assumed to be coupled to ordinary matter only through gravity . multiplying ( [ eq : potleoma ] ) by @xmath38 and integrating , one obtains @xmath39",
    "it follows from this that , given the range of possible values @xmath40 ( assuming @xmath41 is positive ) , the energy density of a scalar field has the range of scaling behaviours @xmath42 how the energy in a homogeneous mode of a scalar field scales is thus determined by the ratio of the potential to the kinetic energy . alternatively one can phrase the statement in terms of the equation of state obeyed by the mode : from ( [ background1 ] ) we have @xmath43 where @xmath44 , and @xmath45 ( for constant @xmath46 ) in ( [ eq : scaling ] ) .",
    "these statements are true independent of any specific assumption about @xmath47 i.e. about what dominates the energy density of the universe .",
    "when the potential energy dominates over kinetic energy , we have @xmath48 and therefore @xmath49 i.e. an energy density which behaves like a cosmological constant ( and @xmath50 ) ; in the opposite limit of @xmath51 i.e. a kinetic energy dominated mode , we have an energy density with @xmath52 i.e. red - shifting faster than radiation or matter ( and @xmath53 ) .",
    "inflation occurs when the former type of mode also dominates the energy density ; the opposite limit , when the universe is dominated by the kinetic energy of a scalar field ( which , following @xcite , we refer to as _ kination _ ) gives a sub - luminal expansion with @xmath54 .",
    "we now consider more specifically what sorts of potentials give rise to these different types of scaling .",
    "one simple case to analyse is that in which a field rolls about the minimum of a potential . in such an oscillatory phase",
    "the approximate scaling of the energy density can be extracted from ( [ eq : scaling ] ) by replacing @xmath55 by its average value over an oscillation . for a potential which is power law about its minimum with @xmath56",
    "the result @xcite is that @xmath57 reproducing the well known result that a coherent mode oscillating in a quadratic potential gives the same scaling as matter , and a @xmath58 potential that of radiation . for @xmath59",
    "one obtains modes scaling faster than radiation .    again",
    "this statement does not depend on what component dominates the energy density , and the same scaling applies to the mode irrespective of whether the universe has @xmath60 , or is matter or radiation dominated .",
    "the case of a field rolling down a potential ( before it reaches its minimum , or if it has no minimum ) is quite different .",
    "the equation of motion ( [ eq : potleoma ] ) is just a damped roll with the energy content determining the damping through ( [ eq : potleomb ] ) .",
    "the scaling obtained for a given potential depends on what components are present , because what determines the scaling is the balance between the increase in kinetic energy relative to potential energy as the field rolls down the potential , and the decrease of the same quantity due to the damping .",
    "the criterion for a particular scaling is therefore a requirement of the ` steepness ' of the potential . that the simple exponential potential @xmath61 provides the appropriate yard - stick in the case of scalar field domination",
    "is indicated by the existence of a family of solutions for this potential to ( [ eq : potleoma])-([eq : potleomb ] ) with @xmath60 @xcite @xmath62 for @xmath63 , and @xmath64 can always be chosen to be zero by redefining the origin of @xmath28 , in which case @xmath65 .",
    "these solutions , which are attractors ) and ( [ eq : potleomb ] ) that homogeneous perturbations about the solution decay as @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "] were written down @xcite in the context of power - law inflation @xcite , associated with the superluminal growth of the scale - factor for @xmath68 .",
    "for @xmath69 there is not a single attractor with a finite value of @xmath70 , but every solution has @xmath51 asymptotically and @xmath71 .",
    "as @xmath5 increases from zero we obtain the entire range of possible scaling behaviours ( [ possible - scaling ] ) for the energy in a scalar field . by comparison with this potential",
    "we can infer how scalar modes will scale : the ` slow - roll ' conditions ( @xmath72 , @xmath73 ) for inflation , for example , could be stated as the requirement that the first two derivatives of a potential be smaller than those of an exponential with @xmath74 .",
    "an analagous ` fast - roll ' condition for ` kination ' can clearly be provided by comparison with an exponential with @xmath75 e.g. a potential @xmath76 will have such modes for sufficiently large @xmath28 .",
    "these statements apply only to the case of scalar field dominance since we took @xmath60 .",
    "what interests us in the present context is how the scalar energy behaves in the presence of matter and radiation i.e. with @xmath77 .",
    "there are two quite distinct cases which can be immediately distinguished according to their behaviour when @xmath60 : those potentials in which the energy density scales slower than @xmath78 ( i.e. @xmath79 ) , and those in which it scales faster ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "when @xmath77 these two types of potential will show very different behaviour for the following reason : adding a component increases the damping term in ( [ eq : potleoma ] ) , and it follows that the scaling with @xmath30 of the energy density in the scalar field is always _ slower _",
    "i.e. @xmath81 with @xmath82 . for @xmath79",
    "the scalar energy will still red - shift slower than the other component and it will always come to dominate asymptotically , approaching the attractor ( [ eq : jhsoln ] ) .",
    "for @xmath80 , however , the scalar field energy can not always scale as in the case @xmath60 . by doing",
    "so it would become arbitrarily sub - dominant relative to the component @xmath33 , and thus arbitrarily strongly damped .",
    "eventually this damping must reduce its kinetic energy so that it will then scale slowly ( since @xmath48 ) and begin to catch up again with the @xmath33 component .",
    "it is not surprising then to find that there are in fact , for @xmath77 , a quite different set of solutions to ( [ eq : potleoma])-([eq : potleomc ] ) for the exponential potential@xcite , in which the energy in the scalar field mimics that of the dominant component , contributing a fixed fraction of the energy density determined by @xmath5 given by @xmath83 this solution is also an attractor @xcite , with @xmath28 again evolving logarithmically in time as given by ( [ eq : jhsoln ] ) ( with only @xmath64 differing ) .",
    "fig [ transient ] illustrates the evolution towards the attractor starting from initial conditions with the scalar field energy very dominant ( obtained by a numerical evolution of the homogeneous equations of motion for the exponential scalar field with @xmath84 and components of radiation and matter which are equal at @xmath85 ) .",
    "the scalar field energy first scales rapidly , approximately as @xmath86 as indicated by the solution ( [ eq : jhsoln ] ) , until it has undershot the energy density in the radiation .",
    "it then turns around and starts scaling much slower than radiation or matter until it again catches up with them in the matter dominated regime , and then settles down at the fraction given by ( [ attractor ] ) with @xmath35 . as anticipated above the main feature - the turn around in the scaling - can be understood to arise from the increase in damping as the radiation / matter becomes dominant .",
    "one can easily see quantitatively how this comes about :",
    "the energy scaling as @xmath86 scaling occurs while the @xmath87 term in ( [ eq : potleoma ] ) is very subdominant and we have then @xmath88 . if the dominant component on the rhs of ( [ eq : potleoma ] ) is radiation / matter one then obtains the evolution of the field @xmath89 in contrast to the case of the logarithmic dependence on time of the attractors , the potential term evolves in either case more slowly than the first two terms in ( [ eq : potleoma ] ) .",
    "this results in a slow - down in the scaling of the scalar energy which drives it back eventually towards the dominant component .",
    "we will discuss in greater detail below what determines the duration of this transient period in which the scalar energy is very sub - dominant .",
    "we will also see below that the re - entry in this example in the matter - dominated epoch is just a result of the inital conditions . for @xmath24",
    "the attractor exists both in the radiation and matter dominated epochs . given that the relative contribution of the scalar field energy and the dominant component differs so little in the two epochs ( by a factor of @xmath90 ) one would anticipate that the scalar field , if established in the attractor in the radiation dominated epoch will match tightly onto its asymptotic value in the matter dominated epoch . that this is    indeed the case can be seen from fig [ scalfam ] , which shows the evolution of the fractional contribution to the energy density for a range of values of @xmath5 ( with the scalar field prepared in the attractor at the beginning of the evolution ) .",
    "the conclusion from this discussion is that , in the presence of matter or radiation , a scalar potential which is flatter than a simple exponential with @xmath91 will support modes with energy scaling slower than matter , and always asymptotically dominate .",
    "simple exponentials with @xmath92 have attractors in the radiation and matter dominated epoch given by ( [ attractor ] ) , and those with @xmath93 in the matter dominated epoch only",
    ". a scalar field rolling down a potential steeper than these simple exponential e.g. @xmath76 will clearly always decay away asymptotically relative to radiation / matter .",
    "we also saw that oscillating modes scale in a way which is independent of what other component is present , and there are no attractor solutions .",
    "the attractor solutions for the exponential scalar field are therefore a special case . before embarking on the full treatment of the cosmology in which the attractor ( [ attractor ] ) describes the unperturbed limit , we discuss further why this attractor solution is particularly interesting from a cosmological point of view : by virtue of its being an attractor",
    ", it avoids the tuning problems which are inevitably a feature of all other scalar field cosmologies which have been proposed .",
    "first , however , we discuss briefly another attractive aspect of the required potentials .",
    "scalar fields with simple exponential potentials occur in fact quite generically in certain kinds of particle physics theories .",
    "because of the existence of the power - law inflationary solutions ( [ eq : jhsoln ] ) such theories have been studied in some detail by various authors , with attention focussed on models and parameters which lead to inflation .",
    "we will not carry out any detailed analysis here of particular theories which would produce the exact parameters required for the present case , but limit ourselves to a brief review of such theories and the observation that the parameter values which we require are quite reasonable in the context of such theories .",
    "the first are kaluza - klein theories in which the fundamental theory has extra dimensions , which are compactified to produce the four dimensional world we observe . in the effective four dimensional theory",
    "scalar fields arise which correspond to the dynamical degree of freedom @xmath94 associated with the ` stretching ' of the internal dimensions .",
    "the potential is generically exponential because the kinetic term has the form @xmath95 , while the potential ` stretching energy ' is polynomial in @xmath94 .",
    "a simple example @xcite is a six - dimensional einstein - maxwell theory where the two extra dimensions are compactified to @xmath96 with radius @xmath94 . defining a field @xmath0 @xmath97 results simply in four - dimensional einstein gravity",
    "minimally coupled to this field which then has the potential @xmath98 ^ 2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the regime of large @xmath0 we have @xmath99 i.e. effectively a simple exponential potential with @xmath100 .",
    "another example studied in detail in @xcite is the case of a pure gravitational theory with higher derivative terms in an arbitrary number of dimensions , @xmath101 , where spontaneous compactification arises because of the higher derivative terms .",
    "the effective four dimensional theory is in this case considerably more complicated , but again includes a scalar field @xmath0 defined as the logarithm of the `` radius '' of the compactified d - dimensions which gives , in certain regimes , a potential driving the dynamics of the zero mode of the field of the form of ( [ eq : potleoma ] ) with @xmath102 .",
    "another set of models in which such potentials appear is in supergravity and superstring theories @xcite .",
    "one of the most studied is the salam - sezgin model with , @xmath103 supergravity coupled to matter in six dimensions .",
    "it predicts @xcite the existence of two scalar fields @xmath0 and @xmath104 with a potential of the form @xmath105 for @xmath106 it corresponds to a potential of the required form we want , with @xmath107 .",
    "further examples relevant to inflation are given by the authors of @xcite , who find two scalar fields with @xmath107 and @xmath108 in and @xmath103 model , as well as in an @xmath109 ten - dimensional model with gaugino condensation @xcite .",
    "a further class of theories in which such fields arise is in higher order gravity .",
    "there is a conformal equivalence ( see @xcite , and references therein ) between pure gravity described by a lagrangian which is an analytic function of the scalar curvature @xmath110 and general relativity plus a scalar field with a determined potential , and in the presence of matter the metric associated with the latter description is the physical one @xcite .",
    "for example @xcite in @xmath111 dimensions the potential in the case of a lagrangian quadratic in @xmath110 is @xmath112 ^ 2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and , for @xmath113 and a polynomial lagrangian of the form @xmath114 , it is @xmath115^n\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath116 are rational coefficients determined by the @xmath117 . as @xmath118 we have @xmath119 $ ] .",
    "all previous analysis of the cosmological consequences of the existence of such scalar fields has focussed on inflation , which is realized in the case of the simple exponential for @xmath120 .",
    "the fact that many of these models can at best give @xmath121 rather than the considerably flatter potentials needed for inflation ( to naturally give a large number of e - foldings and a nearly flat spectrum of perturbations ) meant that these theories provided a general motivation rather than a realistic model . in @xcite , for example , an extra ad hoc damping term was introduced to produce a more satisfactory model from supergravity motivated models . in the present context",
    "this is not the case : we will see that the most interesting range for structure formation is @xmath122 $ ] in the matter era which approximately corresponds to the range @xmath123 $ ] .",
    "although these values are a little larger than in the simplest models we have reviewed , some of the models above clearly can lead to parameters in this range , and , for example , the number of compactified dimensions required to give these values in the first type of theory we reviewed is certainly not unreasonable in the context of superstring theory . in terms of the theoretical origin of the potential we study therefore , it is not just the form of the potential which is one which arises naturally , but it may also be that the precise value of the single free parameter in this potential is a natural one .",
    "clearly further analysis of such models would be required to make a stronger statement than this , and to see if the cosmological effect of these fields which we study in this paper might ultimately be used to give us specific hints about fundamental particle physics .      in considering the possibility that some significant fraction of the energy density of the universe may be in a homogeneous mode of a scalar field ,",
    "the earliest constraint comes from nucleosynthesis .",
    "such a contribution from a weakly coupled scalar field enters in determining the outcome of nucleosynthesis ( the primordial densities of the light nuclei ) only through the expansion rate . adding a component increases the expansion rate at a given temperature .",
    "the dominant effect of such a change is in its effect on the ratio of neutrons to protons when the weak interactions keeping them in equilibrium freeze - out at a temperature of @xmath124mev .",
    "the range of expansion rates at this temperature compatible with observations is usually translated into a bound on the number of effective relativistic degrees of freedom at @xmath125 . taking @xmath126 to be the maximum number of such degrees of freedom additional to those of the standard model ( with three massless neutrinos ) the equivalent bound on the contribution from a scalar field is @xmath127 ( where @xmath128 is number of effective degrees of freedom in the standard model ) . a wide range of values for the upper bounds on @xmath126 exists in the literature , the variation being due both to the data taken into account and the methods of analysis used .",
    "we will not attempt here to review all the issues involved and accept one or other bound as definitive ( see , for example , @xcite for a full discussion ) .",
    "the tendency in the last few years has been towards less restrictive bounds than were generally thought correct previously . a typical value now used",
    "is a bound of @xmath129 which is given by various authors @xcite , or even a more conservative one of @xmath130 by others @xcite .",
    "this range corresponds here to @xmath131 this is the range of values we will take when we discuss nucleosynthesis in the rest of the paper .",
    "the result for more restrictive nucleosynthesis analyses can be read off from ( [ nucleo - one ] ) .",
    "note also that we have assumed here that the standard model number of relativistic degrees of freedom at @xmath132mev .",
    "the strict experimental lower bound on this number is in fact @xmath133 , given that the upper bound on the mass of the @xmath134 neutrino is @xmath135 mev @xcite . in the case",
    "that the @xmath134 neutrino is non - relativistic ( and decays before nucleosynthesis ) the bound ( [ nucleo - two ] ) is changed to @xmath136 .      in modifications of standard inflationary flat cosmologies @xcite involving a contribution from a scalar field which have been considered to date",
    ", attention has been focussed exclusively on the case that the scalar field contributes significantly only at recent epochs , at the earliest well after the transition to matter domination .",
    "the main reason for this is that one of the motivations for many models has been to produce a contribution at late times which scales slower than matter and dominates asymptotically , producing effects very similar to that of a cosmological constant . in this case",
    "there is unavoidably the same sort of tuning as involved in the cosmological constant model : one requires an initial energy density in the scalar field which is characterised by the energy density in the universe at recent epochs .",
    "another kind of model which has been considered is that in which the energy density in the scalar field scales like matter asymptotically , implemented in an oscillating mode of a sinusoidal potential .",
    "if the field lies initially away from the minimum , it becomes important once the curvature of the potential is comparable to the expansion rate and initially behave like a cosmological constant before rolling down the potential and scaling asymptotically like matter .",
    "this model also involves the same sort of tuning , since a small energy scale must be introduced to single out this late time at which the scalar field becomes dynamically important .",
    "it has been argued in @xcite that there are particle physics motivations for the introduction of such a potential with such a characteristic scale , and that there is nothing ` unnatural ' about models of this type .",
    "the special case we have discussed of the attractor in the exponential potential is quite different , simply because it is an attractor .",
    "in contrast the only attractor in the case of a field asymptotically scaling slower than matter is the pure scalar field dominated cosmology , and the tuning referred to is just that required to make the coupled system of scalar field and matter approach this attractor just at the present epoch . for the models with an oscillating mode there is no attractor , and the tuning consists in fixing the energy density in the scalar field to be comparable to that in matter when it starts scaling like matter . with the attractor for matter and radiation in the present case , the scalar field plus matter / radiation will always end up in this solution asymptotically . in this paper we will take this solution to apply from the beginning of our simulation of structure formation , deep in the radiation era at a red - shift of @xmath137 when the temperature is @xmath138 .",
    "we now address the question as to what range of initial conditions on the scalar field in the early universe will give rise to this behaviour .",
    "in the course of this analysis we will also determine what sorts of initial conditions are compatible with the late entry ( in the matter era at a red - shift of @xmath139 ) to the attractor discussed in @xcite .",
    "the assessment of what are ` natural ' initial conditions for a scalar field in the early universe requires of course a particular framework within which to address the question . what we need to determine is essentially just the kinetic and potential energy in the scalar field at some early time relative to that in radiation ( and therefore matter ) .",
    "given that we are working in the context of inflation - motivated flat homogeneous cosmologies ( and will assume gaussian adiabatic perturbations of the type produced by inflation ) we assess the question within this framework .",
    "the energy density in radiation is then determined by how the universe is reheated after inflation .",
    "we consider both the usual scenario for reheating by decay of the inflaton and then an alternative scenario introduced in @xcite .",
    "the reason for our detailed analysis of this second non - standard case will become clear below .    first consider the standard reheating scenario .",
    "we suppose there is an inflaton field and the scalar field with an exponential potential @xmath140 with @xmath141 ( i.e. with the attractor in the radiation / matter epochs which we will consider ) .",
    "let us consider a typical inflationary model e.g. chaotic inflation .",
    "the simplest and most natural assumption for the relative energy densities at the onset of inflation is @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the energy density in the inflaton .",
    "we make the latter assumption since it is required for the onset of inflation .",
    "the dynamics of the two fields are then described by the equations ( [ eq : potleoma])-([eq : potleomc ] ) , but with @xmath33 now the total energy of the inflaton and @xmath144 a function of the inflaton @xmath145 , where @xmath146 is the ratio of the potential energy of the inflaton to its total energy . for the same reasons as in the case discussed above when @xmath33 describes matter or radiation , there is an attractor solution given by ( [ attractor ] ) with @xmath145 ( assuming @xmath144 changes slowly which is the case for slow - roll inflation ) .",
    "the energy in the scalar field scales so slowly because its roll is strongly damped by the inflaton , with ( [ attractor ] ) specifying the exact ratio of energies at which the damping slows the roll to give precisely the same scaling as for the inflaton . in inflation driven by an exactly constant energy density , this ratio is zero and just represents the asymptotically approached solution in which the scalar field rolls away to an arbitrarily large values of the field after an arbitrarily long time . in any realistic model of inflation however the inflaton must roll in a non - trivial potential in order to exit from inflation and @xmath147 . for example , in chaotic inflation in a potential @xmath148 , one has , in the slow - roll inflationary regime , @xmath149 .",
    "once inflation commences , say at @xmath150 , the energy in the scalar field will be driven towards @xmath151 where @xmath152 is the fraction of the energy density in the attractor in the matter era , and @xmath153 is the number of e - foldings of inflation .",
    "as the inflaton rolls down the potential @xmath144 increases and the fraction of energy in the attractor grows .",
    "starting from initial conditions like ( [ bcs - inflation ] ) the roll of the scalar field is very rapidly over - damped due to the rapid red - shifting of its initial energy density .",
    "it will always then scale much slower than it would in the absence of the inflaton , with @xmath154 . in the next section",
    "we will see that this is enough to ensure that its energy density relative to the inflaton will never drop substantially below that in the attractor .",
    "( the transient with sub - dominance we observe in that case results from the field having initially evolved without the @xmath33 component playing any role for a long period ) . without analysing in detail",
    "how precisely the energy density can track the ( growing ) attractor value during inflation , we thus conclude that the fraction of the energy in the scalar field at the end of inflation will be bounded below by @xmath155 as given by ( [ inflation - fraction ] ) .    from fig [ inflation ] ( and our previous discussion of fig [ transient ] )",
    "we see that this conclusion is enough to establish that , after inflation , the attractor for the scalar field in the radiation dominated epoch is approached within a few expansion times of the end of inflation . when the inflaton starts oscillating and/or decays it begins to scale like matter or radiation , while the scalar field remains overdamped and its energy almost constant until the attractor is attained . in fig",
    "[ inflation ] we assume an abrupt transition from inflation with essentially constant energy to radiation type scaling at scale factor @xmath85 , and take the initial fraction of the energy in the scalar field to be @xmath156 .",
    "the energy density approaches that in the attractor by @xmath157 , and then oscillates about it as it approaches it asymptotically . without further detailed analysis it is clear that for a typical inflationary model , in which the reheat temperature is at most a few orders of magnitude below the gut scale , the attractor will be approached to great accuracy not only by the time scales relevant to structure formation , as we assume below , but also long before nucleosynthesis .",
    "late entry into the attractor for the scalar field , in particular late in the matter dominated epoch as assumed in the case of this type treated in @xcite , is therefore certainly not what one would expect from typical inflationary models with the usual method of reheating .",
    "inflation is however not embodied in a specific model or set of models , and it would certainly be possible ( and easy to see how ) to devise a model in which the energy density in the scalar field at the end of inflation could be tuned to any required value .    given that the attractor solution is typically established by nucleosynthesis , one must satisfy the constraint discussed above . converting ( [ nucleo - two ] ) to one on the contribution from the scalar field at late times ( in the matter dominated epoch )",
    "gives @xmath158 it is because this quantity would seem to be too small to play any important cosmological role that this kind of attractor solution has been disregarded by the authors who have noted these solutions , rather than being constant , decreases between nucleosynthesis and late times . ] . that this is not in fact the case we will see in greater detail in the later part of this paper . because the contribution is important for a long time it can have just as significant an effect as a larger contribution which plays a role only at late times .",
    "the initial motivation for our detailed study of this model was not , however , the realization that the attractor might consistently be established by nucleosynthesis for cosmologically relevant cases . rather our starting point was the observation that there are interesting and viable cosmologies in which scalar field energy in a rapidly scaling mode could dominate over radiation in the very early universe , and that in the case that this field is an exponential of the type relevant to late time cosmology , there may be , as shown in fig [ transient ] a transient period between the two epochs ( of domination by the scalar field , and the late time attractor ) lasting many expansion times in which the scalar field energy is negligible .",
    "if this transient period includes nucleosynthesis the constraint ( [ nucleo - constraint ] ) would not apply .",
    "we now discuss this model and examine how the time of entry into the attractor depends on the parameters in the model .      an epoch dominated by a scalar field in a mode scaling faster than radiation ( or _ kination _",
    "@xcite ) ) comes about by construction in an alternative theory of reheating suggested in @xcite .",
    "instead of rolling down to the minimum of a potential , oscillating and decaying , as envisaged in the standard reheating scenario , the inflaton field can roll into a steeper potential supporting a mode scaling faster than radiation ( i.e. an exponential with @xmath24 or steeper ) .",
    "rather than being , as is often stated , completely ` cold and empty ' at the end of inflation , the universe contains a component of radiation created simply by the expansion of the universe ( with energy density @xmath159 ) .",
    "although initially very sub - dominant relative to the energy @xmath160 in the scalar field ( @xmath161 ) a transition to a radiation dominated cosmology will take place at some subsequent time since the radiation red - shifts away slower than the energy in the scalar field .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case that the relevant field is the simple exponential with @xmath3 ( i.e. @xmath162 ) .",
    "we evolve the system of scalar field plus radiation and matter forward in time from the end of inflation , at which time we take the initial conditions to be specified by @xmath163 where @xmath164 is the expansion rate at the end of inflation .",
    "the initial condition assumes an abrupt end to slow - roll inflation i.e. when the inflaton begins rolling in the region in which the potential is exponential , the potential energy is still dominant .",
    "the choice @xmath165 corresponds to the simplest estimate of the initial radiation density , taking it to be dominated by the radiation at the horizon scale at the end of inflation ( with ` temperature ' @xmath166 @xcite , see @xcite for a more detailed discussion ) .",
    "we will see below that the results we are interested in here are not very sensitive to these choices .    in this model with the exponential potential",
    "there are then just two parameters : @xmath164 , the expansion rate at the end of inflation , and @xmath5 ( or , equivalently , @xmath167 in the attractor in matter domination ) .",
    "these entirely specify the post - inflationary homogeneous cosmology , which evolves , as illustrated in fig [ transient ] , from the scalar field dominated phase through a transient into the late time attractor .",
    "what we want to determine here is the time at which the attractor is approached as a function of @xmath164 , and the range of parameters for which the model is compatible with nucleosynthesis .",
    "the results , which are summarized in fig [ hvsomega ] , can be understood after some closer examination of the solutions .",
    "the first feature to note is that the nucleosynthesis constraint , denoted by the hatched region , allows a range of @xmath164 at given @xmath4 which is ( i ) only bounded below for @xmath168 , ( ii ) bounded above and below for @xmath169 in a range which pinches off as @xmath170 , so that for larger values of @xmath4 there is no parameter space in the model compatible with nucleosynthesis .",
    "this can be understood as follows .",
    "the lower bound comes from the requirement that the initial regime of scalar field dominance end sufficiently long before nucleosynthesis . in its initial phase",
    "the scalar field approaches rapidly a mode in which it scales approximately as @xmath86 for @xmath171 ( or as given by ( [ eq : jhsoln ] ) for @xmath171 ( @xmath172 ) ) . in order that the radiation @xmath173 come to dominate by the time its temperature ( @xmath174 ) corresponds to that at nucleosynthesis ( @xmath175 mev ) , this means ( from ( [ initial ] ) ) that @xmath176 where @xmath177 is defined as the temperature at which the scalar field energy becomes equal to that in the radiation , and we took @xmath178 mev to obtain the numerical value .",
    "the higher value of the lower bound in fig [ hvsomega ] results from the fact , since our initial conditions are still inflationary , the scalar field takes a short time to attain the rapidly scaling behaviour assumed in deriving ( [ lower - bound ] ) .",
    "the increase of the lower bound with @xmath4 is explained in the same way - the transition to the @xmath86 scaling takes longer as the potential flattens ( as @xmath5 decreases ) . from (",
    "[ lower - bound ] ) we also can see quantitatively the weak dependence on @xmath179 .    as we observed in fig [ transient ] the scalar field dominance",
    "is followed by a transient period in which it is very sub - dominant , before approaching the late - time attractor .",
    "the upper bound on @xmath164 which appears at @xmath180 is just the requirement that , for @xmath169 ( using the weaker limit of the bound in ( [ nucleo - two ] ) ) , this period lasts until after nucleosynthesis .",
    "this gives an upper bound because the transient ends earlier according as the first phase of scalar field dominance does . in fig [ transfam ]",
    "we see the evolution of the fraction of the energy density as a function of temperature for various different @xmath164 . for @xmath181",
    "gev the nucleosynthesis bound is violated because we enter the attractor too early ; for @xmath182 it is violated because we exit the first phase too late . why the allowed range of @xmath164 ` pinches off ' as we go to @xmath183 is that the duration of the transient decreases as we approach this value .",
    "this can be seen clearly from fig [ temp ] which show , for @xmath184 ( left panel ) and @xmath185 ( right panel ) the temperature @xmath177 ( when the scalar field energy first equals that in the radiation ) and at @xmath186 , when the attractor is established .",
    "this behaviour can be understood by looking back to the attractor solutions ( [ eq : jhsoln ] ) . in the late time",
    "attractor the parameter @xmath187 must reach a certain determined value ; as indicated by ( [ eq : jhsoln ] ) the value @xmath108 separates two quite distinct regions in which @xmath70 behaves quite differently . for @xmath188",
    "the @xmath60 attractor tends to a finite value ; in the steeper potential with @xmath172 the potential energy ` runs away ' faster and @xmath70 decreases rapidly towards zero .",
    "as long as @xmath189 the scalar energy continues to scale away as @xmath86 , and it may take a long time for the kinetic energy to catch up again on the potential energy ( which essentially stops decreasing once the field s roll is damped by the radiation or matter ) .",
    "the large ` undershoot ' and long period of sub - dominance of the scalar energy thus results from the fact that the exponential field with @xmath172 evolves for a long time damped only by its own energy density , which allows the field to run away so fast that the potential energy decreases enormously . on the other hand for @xmath190 ( @xmath191 ) the scalar field in the first phase",
    "follows the @xmath60 attractor ( [ eq : jhsoln ] ) with @xmath192 , and only a little adjustment is needed to find the late time radiation dominated attractor with @xmath193 .",
    "the nucleosynthesis constraint is therefore never satisfied in this case .    also shown in fig [ hvsomega ] are the curves corresponding to ` entry ' to the attractor at different temperatures - at @xmath11ev ( solid line ) , at matter - radiation equality ( dash - dot line ) and today ( dotted line ) .",
    "the undashed region lying to the right of the first of these lines corresponds to the parameter space ( for this model ) we will consider in the rest of this paper , which is consistent with nucleosynthesis and with our assumption of the validity of the attractor with ( [ attractor ] ) as our homogeneous solution",
    ". the line corresponding to re - entry at nucleosynthesis is not given , but one can infer that it would mark out a substantial part of this region ( bounded by the solid line ) , which corresponds to entry into the the attractor after nucleosynthesis but prior to @xmath194 . there is also a region , bounded by the first and third line , which we do not describe and which might be of relevance to late time cosmology .",
    "the region to the left of the dotted line corresponds to regions where the scalar field would still be irrelevant today , and therefore the existence of the exponential field has no implications for late time cosmology .",
    "one can also determine from fig [ hvsomega ] that , for entry in the matter dominated epoch , the largest possible value of @xmath4 in this model is approximately @xmath195 .",
    "this places an upper bound on what contribution to the energy density might be expected to come from this type of solution , if one is not to use the sort of tuning which , as we have emphasised , the model has the merit of being able to avoid .",
    "( in particular we note that we can not obtain the case @xmath196 of @xcite . )",
    "is there a ` natural ' value for @xmath164 within the allowed range ?",
    "@xmath164 is related to the inflaton energy at the end of inflation by @xmath197 , and the range @xmath198$]gev corresponds approximately to @xmath199$]gev . with a more developed model with a full ansatz for the part of the potential which supports inflation",
    ", one can relate @xmath164 to the amplitude of density perturbations , and require that they match those observed in the cmbr by cobe . the simplest calculation ( for a very flat inflaton potential )",
    "would give @xmath200 gev , or @xmath201gev .",
    "however the result is not model independent . in @xcite a particular model",
    "is constructed in which @xmath164 can be as low as the value at which the phase of scalar dominance ends just before nucleosynthesis .",
    "this parameter range for the model has the particular interest that it leads to quite radical modifications of physics at the electroweak scale , since the expansion rate can be up to five order of magnitude greater than in the radiation dominated case at @xmath202 .",
    "in the rest of this paper we study only cosmology starting from @xmath203",
    ". we will assume the existence of the simple exponential , and take the homogenous cosmology about which we perturb to be given exactly by the attractor at this initial time .",
    "@xmath5 is thus the sole adjustable parameter additional to those of scdm . to allow the simplest direct comparison of structure formation in our model with scdm we take the fiducial value @xmath204 for the baryon fraction . in the present study we will not consider the effect of varying this parameter . if we were to do so we would have to be more definite about our assumptions about nucleosynthesis , since the allowed range of @xmath205 ( or equivalently baryon to photon ratio @xmath206 ) depends on the expansion rate at nucleosynthesis . the canonically quoted range , which corresponds to that consistent with observations for the case @xmath207 , narrows as the expansion rate at freeze - out increases ( since the fraction of helium produced increases as the expansion rate does ) .",
    "as the expansion rate reaches its upper bound , the @xmath206 required for consistency with observations is pushed towards its lower bound . having used the constraints of structure formation to determine the best value of @xmath4 in our model , we will comment again in our conclusions on the consistency of entry to the attractor prior to nucleosynthesis .",
    "we now analyse the evolution of perturbations in this cosmology .",
    "the structure of this section is as follows .",

    "perturbations of a given wave number @xmath293 are damped while @xmath294 , but as soon as @xmath295 becomes small enough they behave like perturbations in pressureless matter and grow .",
    "so perturbations in an intermediate range of wavenumbers , despite suppression during a finite period of time , catch up on the pressureless matter perturbations and contribute to gravitational collapse .",
    "this effect can be seen when we compare @xmath282 for both these scenarios for @xmath296mpc ( i.e. a mode that comes into the horizon at radiation - matter equality ) . in fig [ neffnu.1 ]",
    "we see that , while in the @xmath28cdm case @xmath297 , in the mdm case , perturbations in massive neutrinos start to grow as pressureless matter and @xmath298 .",
    "a further subtle difference between the two scenarios can be seen at the transition between super- and subhorizon behaviour in the radiation era . as shown above",

    "indeed from the equations we see that the transition should happen when @xmath302 ( where @xmath303 ) .",
    "a simple way of seeing this is by looking at the source term for the @xmath249 in the radiation era , @xmath304 .",
    "on superhorizon scales @xmath305 , and the time when this quantity starts to deviate from a constant indicates the transition from super- to subhorizon behaviour .",
    "we have @xmath306 in the mdm scenario where we have grouped the massless and massive neutrinos together , and we have @xmath307 in the @xmath308 case . in fig .",
    "[ sourcerad ] we look at the time evolution of a mode with @xmath309h mpc@xmath10 and see that transition to subhorizon evolution occurs earlier in the scalar field scenario than in the mdm scenario . as a result @xmath249 stops growing earlier and",
    "there is an additional small , but non - negligable suppression factor in the radiation era .    in fig .",

    "we shall present a simplified version , in the synchronous gauge and use it to understand the effect @xmath4 will have on the @xmath313s . to a reasonable approximation",

    "in fig [ celles ] we plot the angular power spectrum of the cmb for a few values of @xmath313 .",
    "comparing to a scdm @xmath313 we see two effects .",
    "firstly , for @xmath318 we see that the peaks are slightly shifted to smaller scales . in @xcite",
    "a clear analysis was presented which explains the location of the peaks in the mdm model scenario , and we will now see that the same effect is present here , _ albeit in the opposite direction_. the anisotropies at these scales are generated primarily at @xmath317 and for the purpose of this discussion we can assume that the first term in ( [ cmbana ] ) dominates .",
    "as shown in @xcite the peak structure of this term is given by @xmath319 where @xmath320 is the sound horizon in the baryon - photon fluid , @xmath321}$ ] .",
    "now one of the effects described in @xcite and which we see here is that for a given redshift ( during a period of time which contains the time of recombination ) , @xmath320 is different in the presence of the scalar field than in it absence .",
    "this is to be expected as deep in the radiation era we now have three components contributing , the radiation ( whose energy density is set by @xmath322 , the massless neutrinos ( whose energy density is set by @xmath323 ) and the scalar field whose energy density is a constant fraction of the total energy density .",
    "therefore , for a given redshift , the total energy density in the presence of the scalar field is larger than the total energy density in the absence of the scalar field . as a consequence",
    "the expansion rate will be larger and the conformal horizon will be smaller . in fig .",
    "[ sound ] we plot the ratio of energy densities and the ratio of comoving horizons as a function of scale factor . at recombination",
    "( @xmath324 ) , the conformal horizon ( and consequently the sound horizon ) is smaller , and as seen in fig .",
    "[ celles ] the peaks are shifted to the right .    finally , the other effect @xmath4 has on the peaks is to boost their amplitude .",
    "let us assume @xmath325 , i.e. we are deep in the radiation era .",
    "as shown in the section [ pertdens ] we can write @xmath326 so the acoustic oscillations are sourced by @xmath327 .",
    "one finds that this source is larger in the presence of the scalar field than in its absence ( see fig .",
    "[ ddotc ] ) .",
    "the increase in the amplitude of this driving term will increase the amplitude in @xmath328 and lead to the increase by a few percent of the acoustic peaks of the angular power spectrum .",
    "in the previous section we have discussed in some detail the evolution of density perturbations and temperature anisotropies in the @xmath28cdm cosmology .",
    "this approximate analysis indicated that results should be similar to those in the mdm model , except that there should be additional suppression of power in @xmath329 on small scales . using the full results of our numerical evolution we now compare our model with the observational constraints which measure fluctuations on a wide range of scales .",
    "we first compare the @xmath313s to the cobe data and calculate the normalization of the perturbations model for different @xmath4 .",
    "for completeness we plot a selection of @xmath313 compared to a compilation of data sets and other candidate theories .",
    "we then compare @xmath329 with the observational @xmath329 rendered in @xcite from a compilation of surveys . for this section",
    "we define @xmath28cdm@xmath330 to be a universe with @xmath331 , @xmath332kms@xmath10mpc@xmath10 and @xmath28cdm@xmath333 to be a universe with @xmath334 , @xmath335kms@xmath10mpc@xmath10 .",
    "the past five years has seen a tremendous growth in experimental physics of the cmb . over twenty experimental groups",
    "have reported detections of fluctuations in the cmb and a rough picture is emerging of the angular power spectrum .",
    "it is fair to say that the most uncontroversial and useful measurement that we have is that of cobe , which tells us that on scales larger than @xmath336 the fluctuation are approximately scale invariant with a @xmath337 .",
    "measurements on smaller scales seem to indicate a rise in the power spectrum , but a convincing constraint is still lacking . in fig [ dtfull ]",
    "we present a compilation of measurements of @xcite as compared to two @xmath28cdm models and a few candidate rival models .",
    "clearly there is still is a large spread although an overall shape is emerging .    in the previous section we described the effect that @xmath4 would have on the @xmath313s . for small @xmath338s the dominant effect to note",
    "is the increase in power of the acoustic peaks relative to the large - scale , scale - invariant plateau .",
    "the larger ia @xmath4 , the larger is the boost and therefore the smaller the @xmath338s which are affected . in practice",
    "it introduces an effective `` tilt '' in the large angle power spectrum as can be seen in fig [ larga ] .",
    "it is useful to quantify how good a fit @xmath28cdm @xmath313s are to the cobe data .",
    "the correct framework to work with is maximum likelihood analysis . in @xcite",
    "the authors have supplied us with an efficient way of evaluating the likelihood of a given mode relative to purely scale invariant fluctuations . on the left panel",
    "we plot the likelihood of the best fit model as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "there are two important things to note .",
    "firstly the well known fact that , if one includes the quadrupole , the cobe data favours more tilted models and therefore a larger @xmath4 . secondly",
    ", the likelihood function for @xmath4 should be very flat ; indeed the dependence of the tilt on @xmath4 is very weak . as explained in the previous section",
    "the effect of @xmath4 on the @xmath313s is of order a few percent and concentrated at large @xmath338s .",
    "there will be little variation on cobe scales .",
    "one of the key observational constraints for any class of models is the mass variance per unit interval in @xmath272 as defined in eq .",
    "[ delta ] .",
    "this quantifies the amount of clustering over a range of scales . in @xcite",
    "the authors compiled a series of surveys and attempted to extract what they believe to be the underlying @xmath329 of the linear density field .",
    "this involved a series of corrections : firstly , the assumption that the different samples were biased in different ways with respect to the underlying density field ; secondly , that there are redshift distortions in the observed structures ; and finally , that some of the structures have undergone non - linear collapse .",
    "this final correction is model dependent and in principal great care should be taken in making definitive comparisons between our theoretical @xmath329 and that presented in @xcite .",
    "in practice we shall assume that possible corrections are small and compare them .",
    "in a future publication we shall analyse the non - linear features of this theory .    in fig .",
    "[ deltaphis ] we plot a family of cobe normalized @xmath329 with @xmath339 and @xmath204 .",
    "we clearly see the features described in [ eqpert ] , i.e. the larger the @xmath4 , the smaller the @xmath293 for which @xmath329 departs from scale invariance . in the other panel",
    "we can also see how it differs from a mdm model with the same background cosmological parameters .",
    "for the same energy density in exotic matter component ( i.e. @xmath28 or massive @xmath340 ) there is more suppression in the @xmath28cdm case .",
    "finally we see how it compares to the data of @xcite .",
    "we find that , for @xmath4 in the range @xmath341 we can match the data with as good agreement as the mdm model and some other candidate models .",
    "this is displayed in fig [ pdfig ] . in the following table",
    "we tabulate the @xmath342 values ( with 15 degrees of freedom ) of these models , in increasing goodness of fit .",
    "@xmath308 is competetive with the best fit model of mdm .",
    "[ table1 ]    [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     one can fit @xmath329 for these models ( to 10@xmath20 in the range @xmath343 ) with : @xmath344 where @xmath345 is the cobe normalized cdm mass variance , and contains all the dependence on remaining cosmological parameters such as @xmath346 and @xmath347 @xcite .",
    "a useful quantity to work with is that characterising the mass fluctuations on @xmath110h@xmath10mpc scales @xmath348 in particular it has become the norm to compare this quantity at @xmath9h@xmath10mpc with the abundances of rich clusters .",
    "it is premature to use this constraint with the our current understanding of @xmath28cdm .",
    "the best measurements of such abundances involve an estimate of the number density of x ray clusters of a given surface temperature . to relate these temperatures to masses in an accurate way one has to rely on n - body simulations of clusters .",
    "this has been done for a few cosmologies and we can use the results they use as a rough guide but care should be taken with using such results at face value . the fact that we can fit @xmath329 to the data of @xcite is already strong indication that we are on the right track .",
    "if we use the values of @xcite we have @xmath349 .",
    "a good fit to @xmath12 is @xmath350 where @xmath351 is the cobe normalized scdm @xmath12 .",
    "as would be expected , for the range of values for which we get a good agreement with @xcite , we also match the cluster abundance constraints .",
    "finally it is desirable to make a comparison with some measure of small scale clustering at early times . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors used a simple analytic estimate of the fraction of collapsed objects at redshift @xmath352 and @xmath353 to show that for @xmath354 , mdm models predict too little structure as compared to that inferred from the lyman-@xmath8 measurements @xcite .",
    "more recently in @xcite , the authors considered a larger range of cosmological parameters and found that constraints from the lyman-@xmath8 systems could be sufficiently restrictive to rule out a large range of models . from fig [ pdfig ]",
    "we can see that @xmath28cdm should fare better than mdm on very small scales .",
    "this is easy to understand : we argued in section [ pert ] that effectiveness of @xmath28cdm was mainly due to the fact that the scalar field free - streaming scale grows with time while the massive neutrino free streaming scale decays with time .",
    "we then need a larger amount of massive neutrinos to fit both cobe and the cluster abundances in the mdm model than the amount of scalar field in @xmath28cdm . on much smaller scales (",
    "the scales probed by lyman-@xmath8 systems ) i.e. scales smaller than the massive neutrino free streaming scale , perturbations in mdm should be more supressed than in @xmath28cdm .",
    "this means @xmath28cdm should fare better than mdm with regards to the lyman-@xmath8 constraints .",
    "a preliminary check on our model can be done using the technique of @xcite . in brief",
    "one can make a conservative estimate that a fraction @xmath355 of matter is in gas at that time and set bounds on the amount of objects with masses greater than @xmath356 . using the press - schecter formalism one can then derive a bound : @xmath357 where erfc is the complementary error function and @xmath358mpc . for @xmath28cdm in the range of @xmath359 and @xmath4 that we have been considering",
    "we find that if @xmath360 , these models are consistent with this constraint .",
    "note that the mdm model already has serious problems with this conservative constraint .",
    "if we consider a less a conservative constraint and take @xmath361 as seems to be indicated by hydrodynamical studies , than @xmath28cdm is inconsistent with these measurements .",
    "more detailed observations and modeling of lyman-@xmath8 systems will supply us with a very strong constraint on this class of models .",
    "in the first part of this paper we gave the motivation for considering the particular scalar field cosmology we have now studied in detail : the addition made to the standard scdm model does not involve any tuning of the type involved in other modifications , in that no energy scale characteristic of the universe at recent epochs is invoked .",
    "the form of the required potential is one which arises in many particle physics models , with values of the single free parameter of the order required .",
    "having analysed the model and determined the best fit to structure formation , we now first comment on these aspects of the model .",
    "in section [ ics ] we argued that , in typical inflationary models with the usual mechanism of reheating , one would expect the attractor solution to be established well prior to nucleosynthesis . in this case",
    "we should therefore compare our best fit to the constraint from the latter , as given in ( [ nucleo - constraint ] ) , which is satisfied ( clearly for the conservative bound , and marginally for the tighter one ) .",
    "further , in this case we need to check that the value @xmath362 which is equivalent to the baryon to photon ratio @xmath363 ( in units of @xmath364 ) is within the allowed range at the corresponding expansion rate .",
    "this is not a question which is easy to answer simply because most nucleosynthesis calculations give results only in terms of the range of @xmath365 allowed at the standard model expansion rate , or the maximum additonal number degree of freedom allowed . for the conservative criteria @xcite which gave the weaker upper bound in ( [ nucleo - constraint ] ) the allowed range narrows from @xmath366 $ ] at @xmath367 to the lower bound @xmath368 at @xmath180 . extrapolating the use of these criteria for a more restrictive case for which the required data is given in @xcite ( i.e. the allowed range of @xmath365 is given as a function of the energy density in an extra component ) the value @xmath363 would appear to be in the allowed range at @xmath278 . for a more restrictive set of nucleosynthesis constraints a slightly lower value of @xmath205 might be required for consistency .    in an alternative model of reheating ( which is by construction associated with the existence of this same type of potential )",
    ", we saw that the time of re - entry to the attractor could be after nucleosynthesis , at a time which depends on both @xmath4 and the other parameter in this model @xmath164 , the expansion rate at the end of inflation . by making the assumption that the attractor is established prior to nucleosynthesis we restricted ourselves to a ( large ) part of parameter space . from fig [ hvsomega ]",
    "we can read off that this corresponds , for @xmath369 , to @xmath370gev or @xmath371 gev . as we noted at the end of section",
    "this is consistent with what would guess would be the most natural range of these parameters in this model . on the other hand ,",
    "it is inconsistent with models in which the phase of scalar field domination continues until just before nucleosynthesis ( with the consequences described in @xcite ) since they correspond to the line defining the lower bound from nucleosynthesis in fig [ hvsomega ] .",
    "for entry to the attractor before today , it can be see from fig [ hvsomega ] that one requires in this case @xmath372 .",
    "it would be interesting to analyse the effect on structure formation in these models , and indeed in all of the parameter space for this model excluded by us in our present analysis .    in terms of @xmath5",
    "our best - fit corresponds to the range @xmath373 $ ] . as we discussed in section [ exptls ]",
    "this value is certainly of the order observed in the fundamental particle physical theories of which they have been observed to be a generic feature , and may even be in the precise range found in certain theories .",
    "this suggests the exciting possibility of ultimately linking the cosmological features which would provide a signature for these fields to details of physics at the planck scale .",
    "from the point of view of particle physics motivated model - building it would be particularly interesting also to look at models where the simple exponential potential represents the asymptotic behaviour of a potential which can support inflation in another region , since this would be likely to produce a very constrained model ( with reheating as discussed ) .    in section [ pert ] we analysed in detail the evolution of perturbations in @xmath28cdm .",
    "we found that perturbations in the scalar field on subhorizon scales decayed , leading to a suppression of power on small scales . the similarities with mdm led us to pursue the comparison in more detail .",
    "we found that the contribution from the scalar field was more efficient at suppressing perturbations in the cdm than massive neutrinos .",
    "we showed that this was due to a simple difference in the evolution of the `` free - streaming '' scale in the two theories : in @xmath28cdm the free streaming scale grows with the horizon while in mdm the freestreaming scale decays as @xmath374 .",
    "this means that perturbations in the scalar field _",
    "never _ grow once they come into the horizon , in contrast to perturbations in the massive neutrino which end up clumping after some finite time .",
    "we analysed the effect the scalar field would have on the cmb and found it to be small but distinctly different from that of mdm .",
    "in section [ data ] we used the results of a boltzmann - einstein solver to test how well this class of models fared when compared to various astrophysical data . because of the weak effect the scalar field has on the cmb , the angular power spectrum is effectively ( with the current accuracy of experiments ) as in scdm . using the cobe data we normalized these theories and compared the mass variance per logarithmic interval in @xmath293 to the one estimated in @xcite .",
    "our models fared as well , or better , than competing flat universe models .",
    "a comparison with an estimate of the mass variance at @xmath9h@xmath10mpc from the abundances of rich clusters gave the same results .",
    "we finally compared the amount of structure at high redshift our model predicts , as compared to that infered from lyman-@xmath8 systems .",
    "this has proven to be a serious problem for mdm models .",
    "we saw that our model is consistent , albeit marginally , with these constraints .",
    "\\(i ) we assumed an initial flat adiabatic spectrum of perturbations , in line with the most generic type of inflation . within the context of inflation",
    "one can of course have different spectra etc . , and within the context of some very well motivated form for the inflationary part of the potential in the alternative reheating model , it would be interesting to look at the combined effect on structure formation . in more general ,",
    "an interesting feature of the exponential which would be worth investigating is the fact that the attractor is also an attractor for isocurvature fluctuations , and hence the assumption of adiabatic initial conditions might have a much more general motivation than the standard inflationary one .",
    "\\(ii ) inflation was assumed simply because it is the paradigmatic model .",
    "the existence of the exponential scalar field might of course have an effect on any cosmology . in an open cosmology ,",
    "for example , the analagous attractor also exists in the curvature dominated regime and the asymptotic state has a scalar field energy scaling as @xmath375 .",
    "\\(iii ) we have shown that the effect of the exponential scalar field on the angular power spectrum of the cmb is quite small , much like the case of mdm .",
    "however , recent high precision analysis of parameter estimation from the cmb ( as one would expect from the satellite missions ) indicates that one may achieve a precision of @xmath376=0.04 or better .",
    "this opens up the interesting possibility of actually trying to constrain @xmath4 with the cmb .",
    "\\(iv ) besides the issue of consistency with entry into the attractor prior to nucleosynthesis which would motivate the study of the dependence on @xmath205 away from the scdm value we assumed , there are further observational reasons for doing so .",
    "the recent measurements of @xcite indicate that one may have a higher baryon content than previously expected .",
    "since a higher baryon content leads to less structure on smaller scales , a best fit to large scale stucture constraints would be obtained with a smaller value of @xmath4 . the effect on the lyman-@xmath8 constraints",
    "might be more dramatic , since there would be a competition between the suppression of power and the increase in the amount of gas simply due to the fact that there are more baryons around .",
    "that the result is not immediately evident can be seen from the analysis of mdm in @xcite .",
    "further , to determine whether entry to the attractor prior to nucleosynthesis is consistent in this case , one would have to determine whether this decrease in @xmath4 would broaden the allowed range in @xmath206 sufficiently .",
    "\\(v ) one of the main problems for the mdm model is the overwhelming evidence for structure at high redshift .",
    "critical universe models with massive neutrinos typically underproduce structure as probed by lyman-@xmath8 systems and high redshift cluster abundances @xcite .",
    "this problem is somewhat alleviated in the case of @xmath28cdm : the different evolution of the free - streaming scale in @xmath28cdm leads to more power on small scales ( and consequently high redshifts ) relative to mdm .",
    "this certainly provides strong motivation for further study of the evolution of perturbations on small scales and high redshift in these models .    from the point of view of structure formation",
    "we have described a new model which has the same qualitative features as mdm .",
    "unlike other scalar field cosmologies , which affect the local expansion rate ( up to redshift of a few ) , our background evolution is exactly matter dominated , the modification arising at the perturbation level .",
    "given the wealth of current data on small scales , at recent redshifts , this raises the question of whether this is the right approach to the construction models of structure formation : the existence of structure at high redshift combined with the small scale velocity dispersion today at 1h@xmath10mpc seems to argue for a strong modification of the growth rate of perturbations in the last few redshifts .",
    "this would point towards a low density universe .",
    "however , until we have a more detailed understanding of the non - linear evolution of perturbations in models such as @xmath28cdm ( on scales between @xmath377 and @xmath378h@xmath10mpc ) , these models should not be ruled out .",
    "we are currently analysing the non - linear regime of @xmath28cdm using an n - body code .",

    "<S> a weakly coupled scalar field @xmath0 with a simple exponential potential @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the reduced planck mass , and @xmath3 , has an attractor solution in a radiation or matter dominated universe in which it mimics the scaling of the dominant component , contributing a fixed fraction @xmath4 ( determined by @xmath5 ) to the energy density . </S>",
    "<S> such fields arise generically in particle physics theories involving compactified dimensions , with values of @xmath5 which give a cosmologically relevant @xmath4 . for natural initial conditions on the scalar field in the early universe the attractor solution </S>",
    "<S> is established long before the epoch of structure formation , and in contrast to the solutions used in other scalar field cosmologies , it is one which does not involve an energy scale for the scalar field characteristic of late times . </S>",
    "<S> we study in some detail the evolution of matter and radiation perturbations in a standard inflation - motivated @xmath6 dark - matter dominated cosmology with this extra field . using a full einstein - boltzmann calculation </S>",
    "<S> we compare observable quantities with current data . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , for @xmath7 , these models are consistent with large angle cosmic microwave background anisotropies as detected by cobe , the linear mass variance as compiled from galaxy surveys , big bang nucleosynthesis , the abundance of rich clusters and constraints from the lyman-@xmath8 systems at high redshift . </S>",
    "<S> given the simplicity of the model , its theoretical motivation and its success in matching observations , we argue that it should be taken on a par with other currently viable models of structure formation    # 1to 0pt#1 </S>"
