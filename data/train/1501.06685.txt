    "recently , a train of pulses , whose repetition intervals are synchronized with the classical rotational period of the molecules , have been shown to be efficient for the rotational excitation of diatomic molecules @xcite . at present , because of the development of terahertz - wave technology @xcite , molecular orientation by rotationally resonant terahertz pulses has also been studied @xcite . the elemental technology employed to create a train of pulses in the terahertz region has already been reported @xcite .",
    "an experiment involving molecular orientation using a train of rotationally resonant pulses will be performed in the near future .    using a train of optical pulses",
    ", we can impart the isotope selectivity in rotational excitation , because the classical rotational period depends on the mass of the molecules @xcite .",
    "the isotope selective population displacement of rotationally resonant terahertz pulses by the train is particularly considered to be practical @xcite . because the consecutive rotational population transfer by the train of pulses simultaneously starts from all the rotational states in the molecule , the principle of isotope selection still works well even if the initial rotational energies of the molecular ensemble are thermally distributed , specifically at high temperatures . however , there are still many problems with the practical application of isotope separation of optical pulses in the terahertz region by the train .",
    "further theoretical studies and development of elemental technologies are required .    in real diatomic molecules ,",
    "the consecutive rotational excitation by the pulse train has a certain upper boundary even if the interval of pulses is synchronized with the rotational period @xcite . for a single pulse excitation ,",
    "the limitation ordinarily comes from the spectral bandwidth of the pulse . for a multi - pulse scheme ,",
    "two additional mechanisms induce the localization of rotational distribution ; centrifugal distortion and mismatching of the pulse interval .",
    "figure 1 shows an example of the time - evolution of the rotational probability distribution of diatomic molecules in a periodic train of pulses . for the isotope in a synchronized pulse train ( fig . [ fig_exp](a ) ) , the wave packet of rotational probability is reflected at a certain limit , and repeatedly excited and de - excited inside the region .",
    "this phenomenon is localization by centrifugal distortion , called bloch oscillation by flo _",

    "the one - photon pure rotational transition frequencies of the diatomic molecules are also evenly spaced .",
    "isotope selectivity in rotational excitation originates from the agreement of the peak frequencies between the optical frequency comb and the molecular rotational transitions .",
    "mismatching of @xmath6 removes the comb s peak frequencies from the resonance , and the consecutive resonant transitions are immediately prevented .",
    "the effect of centrifugal distortion can be ignored around the ground state ; however , this effect becomes critical in the rotationally excited states .",
    "the centrifugal distortion shifts the transition frequency in proportion to @xmath8 .",
    "such a shift can not be compensated by the optical frequency comb as long as only fourier - transform - limited pulses are used .",
    "a quantitative evaluation of the region of localization of rotational distribution is important in the planning of experiments .",
    "this evaluation can be conducted by calculating the evolution of the time - dependent schrdinger equation system ; however , the dependence of the region of localization on the intensity of the pulses is odd and quite unclear .",

    "the reason we could obtain approximate information from the coefficient probably relates to the characteristics of the spectral decomposition . in the spectral decomposition , the hamiltonian matrix , which depends on quantum paths , is expanded into repeating diagonal interactions with a basis transformation at the beginning and the end . in the case without localization , the approximate time - evolution can be calculated using the same analytical method by ignoring the dependence on quantum paths @xcite . in the case with localization",
    ", we probably have to obtain a first - order approximation as a coefficient that can be related to the approximate probability amplitude .",

    "the unified parameter is still usable because the component of the parameter is not directly related to the matrix of the transition moment . almost the same mathematical treatment can be applied because the transition moment matrix ( eq.[eq_v ] ) can be always numerically diagonalized . at high @xmath26",

    "in this study , we derived a unified parameter to predict the range of localization of the rotational distribution of diatomic molecules in a train of optical pulses .",
    "the validity of the obtained parameter was evaluated by comparison with numerical simulations .",
    "although the theoretical treatment was partly tentative , the obtained parameter can almost completely explain the localization induced by both interval mismatch and centrifugal distortion , known as anderson localization and bloch oscillation , respectively . the odd dependence on the intensity of the pulses was also explained .",
    "because the unified parameter comprises molecular energies and simple experimental parameters , the parameter is useful for the planning of experiments and development . in this study",
    ", we only deal with the resonant pulses in the terahertz region ; however , our method can be extended to non - resonant pulses .",

    "<S> we obtained a simple theoretical unified parameter for the characterization of rotational population propagation of diatomic molecules in a periodic train of resonant optical pulses . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter comprises the peak intensity and interval between the pulses , and the level energies of the initial and final rotational states of the molecule . using the unified parameter </S>",
    "<S> , we can predict the upper and lower boundaries of probability localization on the rotational level network , including the effect of centrifugal distortion . </S>",
    "<S> the unified parameter was tentatively derived from an analytical expression obtained by performing rotating - wave approximation and spectral decomposition of the time - dependent schrdinger equation under an assumption of time - order invariance . </S>",
    "<S> the validity of the parameter was confirmed by comparison with numerical simulations for isotope - selective rotational excitation of kcl molecules . </S>"
