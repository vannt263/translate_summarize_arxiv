    "one of the major motivations of the lhc experiments is to search for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is a favored candidate in this search .",
    "however , susy must be broken so that the masses of super particles exceed those of their sm partners .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) does not incorporate susy breaking and has 124 free parameters .",
    "susy breaking can be achieved by introducing a hidden sector .",
    "the mediation of the breaking from the hidden sector to the observable mssm sector is enabled by different mechanisms such as msugra , gauge - mediated susy breaking ( gmsb ) and amsb through gravity , gauge or anomalous interactions . through this mediation ,",
    "the number of free parameters is significantly reduced .",
    "we have investigated neutralino pair production at the lhc at a center of mass energy of @xmath3 = 10 within the framework of a gmsb scenario  @xcite .",
    "a distinctive phenomenological feature of the gmsb model is the presence of neutral dibosons ( @xmath7 or @xmath8 ) plus missing transverse energy ( @xmath9 ) in the final state .",
    "this note reports on the sensitivity of the atlas detector at @xmath3 = 10 for the process @xmath1 , where @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath10  in this process is a higgsino - like neutralino , which is the next - to - lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) in the model considered here  @xcite .",
    "it decays to a neutral vector boson ( @xmath7 or @xmath8 ) and a gravitino ( @xmath11 ) , the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) , which escapes detection resulting in large @xmath9 .      in gmsb models , susy , which is broken at a scale in a hidden sector ,",
    "is propagated down to the mssm observable sector via new chiral supermultiplets , called messengers , that couple indirectly to the mssm particles through the ordinary @xmath12 gauge boson and gaugino interactions .",
    "the main advantage of gmsb models is the automatic creation of identical soft susy breaking masses for scalars with the same gauge quantum numbers but different flavors .",
    "therefore , there are no problems with flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) or cp violation constraints .    within the minimal version of the gmsb framework ( mgmsb ) , the couplings , branching ratios , decay widths and sparticles masses are determined by the parameters : @xmath13 @xmath14 is the susy breaking energy scale , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is a vacuum expectation value of an auxiliary field that determines the magnitude of supersymmetry breaking in the vacuum state .",
    "@xmath17 is the size of the messenger mass scale , @xmath18 . for electroweak scale superpartners",
    ", @xmath14 is @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 is the number of generations of messenger fields , @xmath21 is the ratio of the mssm higgs vacuum expectation values ( @xmath22 ) , @xmath23 is the sign of the higgs sector mixing parameter and @xmath24 is the ratio of the messenger sector susy breaking order parameter to the intrinsic susy breaking order parameter , which controls the coupling to the gravitino .    in gmsb , @xmath11 is the lsp ( usually , ) .",
    "the @xmath11 has a derivative coupling to each particle and its superpartner with an interaction strength that is inversely proportional to @xmath25 .",
    "because of this coupling , the next - to - lightest superpartner is unstable and decays to its lighter partner through @xmath11 emission . as a result , the nature of the nlsp defines the phenomenology of the gmsb model . depending on the region in parameter space , either the neutralino(@xmath10 ) or the @xmath26 arise as the nlsp .",
    "the nlsp decay length , which depends on @xmath25 , can be divided into three ranges : ( 1 ) the nlsp decays promptly , ( 2 ) the nlsp decays inside the detector away from the collision point ( @xmath27 ) , and ( 3 ) the nlsp decays outside the detector ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "we consider only the case where the nlsp is the @xmath10 , which decays promptly , corresponding to @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath10 is a mixture of gaugino ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) and higgsino ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) eigenstates , and therefore @xmath10  decays to a @xmath8 , @xmath7 , or higgs ( h ) .",
    "if @xmath10  is gaugino - like , it decays mostly to @xmath34 , leading to the @xmath35 signature ( with r - parity conservation , supersymmetric particles are produced in pairs ) .",
    "if the @xmath10  is higgsino - like , it decays to @xmath36 .",
    "in addition , since the longitudinal component of the @xmath7 boson mixes with the goldstone mode of the higgs field , a higgsino - like neutralino also decays to @xmath37 . because of a strong phase space suppression of the h and @xmath7 final states , decay to a @xmath8 can also be important for higgsino - like neutralinos , which are not very much heavier than the @xmath7 boson .",
    "consequently , a pair of higgsino - like neutralinos produced in a collider can give rise to the diboson final states  @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we consider the possibility of a higgsino - like @xmath10 nlsp , where one neutralino decays to @xmath38 and the other decays to @xmath37 , leading to the @xmath39 signature .",
    "to study the @xmath39 signature in the gmsb framework , we generated a sample of @xmath40 events , where @xmath2 , using a ( non - minimal gmsb ) higgsino - like neutralino model ( model line e ) , described in  @xcite .",
    "this model is characterized by the following parameters : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the gaugino mass and yields 225.4 .",
    "unlike in the mgmsb , where the absolute value of @xmath43 is set by the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) radiative conditions as shown in equation [ 3 ] , @xmath43 is set to 0.75@xmath42 in this approach , which gives rise to a large higgsino fraction in the neutralino .",
    "@xmath44    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "[ tab : sig ]    for an integrated luminosity of 1 fb@xmath4 , 5.4 @xmath45 0.06 and 3.4 @xmath45 0.05 signal events ( @xmath46 ) with 2.05 @xmath45 0.6 and 1.0 @xmath45 0.35 background events ( @xmath47 ) are expected for the muon and electron samples , respectively .",
    "the detection significance , defined as the probability from a poisson distribution with mean @xmath47 to observe equal or greater than @xmath48 events , converted in equivalent number of sigmas ( standard deviations ) of a gaussian distribution is 2.7@xmath5 for the 2@xmath43 sample and 1.8@xmath5 for the 2@xmath49 sample , assuming 20@xmath6 systematic uncertainty ( table  [ tab : sig ] ) .",

    "this note presents a study of a gmsb search at atlas with a @xmath39 final state where the @xmath7 is reconstructed using @xmath51 or @xmath52 based on fully simulated mc events .",
    "the study has been performed within the gmsb model line e with @xmath14=80  , using 50k fully simulated signal events of @xmath50  that are characterized by two high @xmath53 leptons plus an energetic @xmath8 with @xmath54 .",
    "the results show that a significance of 5.6@xmath5 , assuming 20@xmath6 systematic uncertainty , can be attained with an integrated luminosity of 3 fb@xmath4 in the combination of the @xmath55@xmath56@xmath57and @xmath55@xmath58@xmath57final states using a cut - based method after taking into account the background contributions from sm @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 .",
