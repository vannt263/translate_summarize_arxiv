    "since pioneering works by andreev and lifshitz@xcite , chester@xcite , leggett@xcite and others , supersolids have been dreamt up as a kind of bose - einstein condensation of defects , vacancies or interstitials .",
    "they would achieve a coherent state that could allow a matter flow trough the crystal .",
    "although the quest for a supersolid state over the last 40 years has failed@xcite , the context has totally changed with the recent experiments by kim and chan@xcite . in these experiments ,",
    "solid helium@xmath0 fills a torsional oscillator under small oscillations and the rotational frequency is measured .",
    "surprisingly , the rotational inertia shows a drop below few tenths of kelvin . this non - classical rotational inertia ( ncri )",
    "is believed to be the signature of the transition of a fraction of the solid into a supersolid state .",
    "the situation has become puzzling as other experiments have been performed .",
    "thus , although the drop of the moment of inertia has been confirmed , crystal annealing was shown to lower dramatically the amplitude of this ncri @xcite . similarly ,",
    "solid helium submitted to pressure gradient could not flow except when large grain boundaries where present in the sample @xcite .",
    "moreover , the responses of solid @xmath0he to a localized pressure jump presented no evidence of superflow in the solid@xcite .the experimental context presents thus apparent contradictions between ncri measurements and pressure driven flows with the role of disorder ( through vacancies , grain boundaries ... ) to be elucidated . on the other hand the theoretical framework for describing supersolids presents also fundamental puzzles ( see the recent review of prokofev@xcite where",
    "the influence of the disorder is particularly discussed ) . beside penrose and onsager argument@xcite ,",
    "monte - carlo models claim that a perfect crystal can not exhibit supersolid behavior@xcite .",
    "however , the account for exchange processes between neighboring atoms @xcite , the densities and the role of the vacancies in the dynamics raise still fundamental questions on the existence and the nature of the supersolidity ( see @xcite for instance ) .",
    "an alternative issue consists of using the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) model@xcite to describe the dynamics of a quantum solid , as proposed in 1994 by pomeau and rica@xcite .",
    "the original gp equation@xcite is used , with a roton minimun in the dispersion relation , where the ground state exhibits a first order phase transition to a crystalline state . however , the assumptions underlying the gp equation are not strictly speaking valid for helium although this equation is believed to give a good qualitative description of superfluid helium . therefore this model ,",
    "even crude in its basic structure , is at least a good testbed for theories of supersolids , that are still in a state of uncertainty . in ref .",
    "@xcite , two of us have developped the theory for the long wave perturbations of this model of supersolid and we have shown that this model was able to conciliate the apparent experimental contradiction discussed above . in the present paper , we study the one - dimensional ( 1d ) version of this model . beside the simplicity of the 1d approach , which then allows precise determination of the crystal structure , the 1d limit is particularly interesting since it can model to some extent an annular geometry .",
    "the starting point is the original gp equation@xcite for the complex wavefunction @xmath1 in one space dimension : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the two body potential depending on the relative distance .",
    "the potential @xmath3 should satisfy @xmath4 for stability and its fourier transform : @xmath5 has to be bounded for all @xmath6 .",
    "moreover , as we will see later , we shall require also that the fourier transform @xmath7 becomes negative at some @xmath8 to allow roton crystallization .",
    "this dynamics conserves the hamiltonian ( or the energy , following @xmath9 ) @xmath10 the number of particles @xmath11 and the linear momentum @xmath12 according to the energy , the ground - state solution is real since any non uniform phase increases its energy .",
    "the dynamics exhibits indeed an homogenous and stationnary solution @xmath13 , with @xmath14 the mean 1d density and @xmath15 .",
    "this solution is stable and can also be the ground state for small enough @xmath14 as suggested by the bogoliubov spectrum of the perturbations@xcite ( see below ) : @xmath16    assuming that the potential scales like @xmath17 and possesses a single length scale @xmath18 , the spectrum depends then only on a single dimensionless parameter@xcite : @xmath19 with @xmath20 . for some analytical results and for the numerics later on , we choose the soft core interaction , with no loss of generalities : @xmath21 with @xmath22 the heaviside function .",
    "the fourier transform of this special interaction potential is @xmath23    it should also be noticed that the special choice of the potential ( [ u0 ] ) is purely of practical interest because it is easy to implement in some numerical schemes and can be easily used for variational estimates",
    ". other functions whose fourier transform would be negative for a wavenumber domain ( strictly bigger than zero ) , would show similar properties . among them are the classical two bodies atomic potential with strong repulsion at short scale and a slight attraction for large scale or a potential @xmath7 choosen in such a way that the bogoliubov dispersion relation matches the landau spectrum with the right values of the speed of sound @xmath24 , and the three roton parameters@xcite .    with @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 ,",
    "the dimensionless gp equation for the heaviside interaction ( we drop the primes hereafter ) reads : @xmath28    finally , we emphasize that an annular geometry can be simplified into a 1d system by considering periodic boundary condition @xmath29 ( @xmath30 is dimensionless ) and by assuming that the transverse structure of the solid can be neglected .",
    "we then define the energy and number of particles densities : @xmath31",
    "as shown in @xcite , for low @xmath32 the ground state is a superfluid ( without positional order ) . however above a critical value ,",
    "@xmath33 the ground state shows a periodic modulation of the density in space .",
    "although in two and three space dimensions the transition is first order as @xmath32 increases , it is supercritical ( second order ) in one space dimension ) the critical value is @xmath34 .",
    "the periodic structure arising from the instability can be analytically estimated through a variational approach for a fixed wavelength @xmath35 at least in two regimes : close to the transition and for large @xmath32 .",
    "if @xmath36 , a weak amplitude developement of wanumber @xmath6 and normalized to unity reads : @xmath37 minimizing the energy of such solution gives :    @xmath38    and the following wave - number selection @xmath39 .",
    "the amplitude for this wave number @xmath8 follows @xmath40 while for @xmath41 , @xmath42 .    in the large @xmath32 limit",
    ", the density exhibits strongly nonlinear strucures since the potential energy in ( [ densenergy ] ) requires small @xmath43 while the mass normalization ( [ density ] ) forbids @xmath43 to be small every - where .",
    "therefore the energy minimization leads to a periodic structure with zones where @xmath44 balancing zones where @xmath45 in the @xmath46 limit , ref .",
    "@xcite showed that @xmath47 only in a small zone @xmath48 of the whole period @xmath49 . the euler - lagrange condition deduced from ( [ densenergy ] ) together with ( [ density ] ) leads to the hemholtz equation in the domain @xmath50 : @xmath51 .",
    "finally the minimization of the energy gives @xmath52 and the wave number @xmath35 of the periodic structure .",
    "following this approach , we sketch now an estimate of the ground state for finite @xmath53 .",
    "we use the trial function for a single period : @xmath54 in @xmath55 $ ] and zero elsewhere , that satisfies exactly the normalization condition ( [ density ] ) . introducing this trial function into the energy ( [ densenergy ] )",
    ", we obtain : @xmath56 with the kinetic energy @xmath57 the self interaction of a pulse with itself @xmath58 and the nontrivial interaction of a pulse with its two near neighbors @xmath59 this energy @xmath60 is not zero only if @xmath61 ( and naturally , we have @xmath62 ) .",
    "the energy @xmath63 may be understood as a function of @xmath52 and of the periodicity length @xmath35 .",
    "then , the variation of total energy in the @xmath64 plane shows the existence of a global minimum and a saddle for large enough @xmath32 . as @xmath32 decreases , the saddle and the global minimum collide , and we obtain a pure monotonic energy landscape in the @xmath64 plane , leading to both @xmath35 and @xmath52 to infinity as minimizer .",
    "on the other hand , when @xmath65 the global minimum moves to @xmath66 .",
    "this selection mechanism holds for an infinite domain where the wavelength @xmath35 can vary continuously . in a finite domain",
    ", @xmath67 can only take discrete values related to the number @xmath68 of unitary cells , @xmath69 .",
    "numerical simulations suggest also the existence of a large energy barrier between minimizers with different number of cells @xmath68 for large @xmath32 .",
    "thus , for a given domain size @xmath30 , the energy , as function of @xmath64 , is now described by a discrete set of energy functions of @xmath52 for each available @xmath35 satisfying @xmath69 .",
    "one has now to minimize each energy with respect to @xmath52 . for small @xmath32 ( typically smaller than @xmath70 ) none of these functions",
    "have minima . for large @xmath32 on the other hand",
    ", there is a finite band of @xmath35 for which the energy admitts a minimum as @xmath52 varies .",
    "the minimization of this energy respect to @xmath52 provides relations among @xmath52 and @xmath32 with the wavelength @xmath35 as a fixed parameter . to determine the global minimum and to avoid further algebraic difficulties , we introduce the new variable : @xmath71 where @xmath72 for our problem ( in particular , @xmath73 means that the peaks do not interact one with another ) . minimizing the energy gives a relation for @xmath74 : @xmath75 fig . [ deltavslambda ]",
    "shows @xmath52 versus @xmath32 for different values of @xmath35 .",
    "the analytical curves are shown together with the results of direct numerical simulations described below .",

    "the curves correspond to formula ( [ lambda1 ] ) while the points come from numerical simulations .",
    "the total size of the system is @xmath77 units and the range of the interaction is @xmath78 .",
    "the system displays a number of cells varying from 44 to 48 ( identified at the right hand side of the figure ) .",
    "the respectives @xmath35 vary thus from @xmath79 to @xmath80.,width=302 ]    finally , an exponential  boundary layer \" correction developps near @xmath81 where the nonlinear term in eq .",
    "( [ nls1 ] ) can not be neglected , as noticed by @xcite . in the limit of large @xmath32 , where similarly @xmath82 , the nonlinear term of eq .",
    "( [ nls1 ] ) gives near @xmath83 :    @xmath84    the ground state is thus modified into @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the trial function ( [ trial2 ] ) , and @xmath87 satisfies a linear schrdinger equation : @xmath88 where the first nontrivial term for the potential reads @xmath89 . the solution may be computed directly in term of bessel functions : @xmath90 where the constant @xmath91 results from the matching of the exponentially small boundary layer and the trial function .",
    "one can also expand this solution _ via _ a wkb approxomation @xmath92 with @xmath93 .",
    "we obtain then @xmath94 and @xmath95 and therefore @xmath96 with @xmath97 .",
    "the precise estimation of the ground state is in fact crucial to describe the supersolid features of the model . indeed , we have obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite , using the homogenization technique @xcite , an expression for the effective or superfluid density matrix @xmath98 deduced from the density profile of the crystal",
    ".    we shall in fact explore the low excited states around the ground state , described by the knowledge of the crystal density @xmath99 .",
    "the change of energy for phase variations gives : @xmath100    and @xmath101 is determined by minimizing @xmath102 , that correspo , the euler - lagrange condition : @xmath103 under the appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "as shown by leggett @xcite , for a periodic @xmath99 under rotation , @xmath104 is lower than that of a rigid solid rotation , which indicates that superfluidity is present .    in refs .",
    "@xcite we have obtained an expression for the energy variation in three space dimensions @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the effective or superfluid density matrix . it can be explicitely expressed using a solution of a partial differential equation in the unit cell @xmath107 of the solid , following :    @xmath108    the vector @xmath109 is a periodic function in the unit cell @xmath107 that is solution of @xmath110 .    in one space dimension , we can in fact deduce the density @xmath111 exactly . indeed the formula ( [ varrhomatrix ] ) simplifies then into one term @xmath112 where @xmath113 is a periodic function in the interval @xmath114 $ ] solution of @xmath115 .",
    "thus @xmath116 where @xmath24 is an integration constant .",
    "the periodic boundary condition @xmath117 gives @xmath118 .",
    "finally , we find that in one dimension , the superfluid density writes : @xmath119    thus , the theory of homogenization provides us an exact result for the special case of one space dimension , and the effective density ( scalar in 1d ) is then a kind of  harmonic \" average of the density @xcite .    from this formula ,",
    "the non classical rotational inertia fraction ( ncrif ) @xmath120 corresponds exactly to the upperbound quotient @xmath121 proposed by leggett @xcite , who also established the equivalence for 1d systems more recently @xcite .",
    "therefore , the ncrif at low speed ( @xmath122 ) reads : @xmath123    * _ remarks . _",
    "*    \\1 . the schwartz inegality ] and",
    "@xmath124 gives @xmath125    \\2 .",
    "for finite energy , if the ground state vanishes at some point , the non - classical rotational inertia does as well . indeed , if at some point @xmath126 we have @xmath127 with @xmath128 , then @xmath129 and @xmath130 therefore if @xmath131 , @xmath121 remains finite with @xmath132 .",
    "however , as we have seen above , such a ground state would require an infinite amount of energy .",
    "the ncrif in the limit of weak modulation may be computed directly from the trial function ( [ trial1 ] ) : @xmath133 where @xmath134 is evaluated at @xmath135 . as @xmath136 , the quotient @xmath121 vanishes , because the wavefunction ( [ trial1 ] ) vanishes at some point .      for large @xmath32 , since the ground state @xmath99 decays exponentially , the contribution to the ncrif ( [ rhoss ] ) mainly comes from the large contribution of @xmath138 in @xmath139 $ ] .",

    "first , the ground state is determined .",
    "then , one can compute directly the ncri by imposing a rotation to this ground state .",
    "on the other hand , the value of @xmath121 can be calculated from the ground state solution @xmath99 .",
    "numerical results are obtained by minimizing the energy ( [ densenergy ] ) under the number of particles condition ( [ density ] ) .",
    "we use therefore the ginzburg - landau version of the dynamics which can be interprated as the integration of the gp equation for imaginary time @xmath144 : @xmath145 @xmath146 is the lagrangian multiplier introduced to satisfy the number of particles condition . imposing a rotational frequency @xmath147 in a 1d annular system amounts to consider a drift of the system at constant velocity @xmath148 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the ground state of such a system is obtained by minimizing : @xmath149 , where @xmath150 consequently , a direct computation of the ncrif can be performed numerically : @xmath151 fig .",

    "as expected , the ncrif decreases as @xmath142 increases . for large value of the parameter @xmath142 ,",
    "the ncrif first become negatives and then show large fluctuations , indicating that complex structures are present , such as @xmath154 phase jumps for instance ( similar to vortices in higher dimensions ) .",
    "moreover , numerical instabilities are also enhanced by the rotation so that only moderate @xmath32 ( up to @xmath155 ) values could be achieved with full confidence .",
    "the low speed limit : @xmath156 is then shown on fig . [",
    "ncrif1da](b ) as function of @xmath32 and compared with the analytical quotient ( [ rhossweak ] ) of the weak amplitude modulations , showing an excellent agreement .    on the other hand ,",
    "as explained above , the @xmath122 can be calculated directly from the numerical solution @xmath99 , by computing the leggett quotient @xmath121 ( [ rhoss ] ) . since",
    "the ground state solution is numerically more stable to obtain than the minimization of the rotating system , we are able to compute a satisfactory good estimates for @xmath121 up to @xmath157 of the order of @xmath158 , as shown on fig . [ ncrifq](a ) .",
    "remarkably @xmath121 does not depend on the wavelength of the periodic structure @xmath35 , since all the numerical data for different @xmath35 gather on a single curve .",
    "this is a consequence that the main contribution to the quotient @xmath121 comes from the wide region with small values of @xmath99 . on the other hand ,",
    "only poor agreement is found with the asymptotic behavior ( [ q0as ] ) .    in fig .",
