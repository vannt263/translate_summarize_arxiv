    "theoretical research on electronic properties in mesoscopic condensed matter systems has focussed primarily on the charge degrees of freedom of the electron , while its spin degrees of freedom have not yet received the same attention .",
    "however , an increasing number of spin - related experiments  @xcite show that the spin of the electron offers unique possibilities for finding novel mechanisms for information processing and information transmission  most notably in quantum - confined nanostructures with unusually long spin dephasing times  @xcite approaching microseconds , as well as long distances of up to @xmath0  @xcite over which spins can be transported phase - coherently . besides the intrinsic interest in spin - related phenomena , there are two main areas which hold promises for future applications : spin - based devices in conventional  @xcite as well as in quantum computer hardware  @xcite . in conventional computers , the electron spin can be expected to enhance the performance of quantum electronic devices , examples being spin - transistors ( based on spin - currents and spin injection ) , non - volatile memories , single spin as the ultimate limit of information storage etc .",
    "@xcite . on the one hand , none of these devices exist yet , and experimental progress as well as theoretical investigations are needed to provide guidance and support in the search for realizable implementations . on the other hand ,",
    "the emerging field of quantum computing  @xcite and quantum communication  @xcite requires a radically new approach to the design of the necessary hardware . as first pointed out in ref .",
    ", the spin of the electron is a most natural candidate for the qubit  the fundamental unit of quantum information .",
    "we have shown  @xcite that these spin qubits , when located in quantum - confined structures such as semiconductor quantum dots or atoms or molecules , satisfy all requirements needed for a scalable quantum computer . moreover , such spin - qubits  being attached to an electron with orbital degrees of freedom  can be transported along conducting wires between different subunits in a quantum network  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "spin - entangled electrons can be created in coupled quantum dots and  as mobile einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) pairs  @xcite  provide then the necessary resources for quantum communication .    for both spin - related areas  conventional computers and quantum computers ",
    "similar and sometimes identical physical concepts and tools are needed , the common short - term goal being to find ways to control the coherent dynamics of electron spins in quantum - confined nanostructures .",
    "it is this common goal that makes research on the electron spin in nanostructures ",
    "spintronics  a highly attractive area .",
    "while we advance our basic knowledge about spin physics in many - body systems , we gain insights that promise to be useful for future technologies .",
    "we have remarked earlier  @xcite that there have been almost as many proposals for solid state implementations of quantum computers as all the other proposals put together .",
    "a clear reason for this is that solid state physics is a most versatile branch of physics , in that almost any phenomenon possible in physics can be embodied in an appropriately designed condensed matter system .",
    "a related reason is that solid state physics , being so closely allied with computer technology , has exhibited great versatility in the creation of artificial structures and devices .",
    "this has been exploited to produce ever more capable computational devices .",
    "it appears natural to expect that this versatility will extend to the creation of solid state quantum computers as well ; the plethora of proposals would indicate that this is indeed true , although only time can tell whether any of these proposals will actually provide a successful route to a quantum computer .    in the following we will review the current status of our theoretical efforts towards the goal of implementing quantum computation and quantum communication with electron spins in quantum - confined nanostructures .",
    "most of the results presented here have been discussed at various places in the literature to which we refer the interested reader for more details .",
    "the long - term goal of our investigations is quantum information processing with electron spins .",
    "thus , a brief description of this emerging research field and its goals are in order .",
    "quantum computing has attracted much interest recently as it opens up the possibility of outperforming classical computation through new and more powerful quantum algorithms such as the ones discovered by shor  @xcite and by grover  @xcite .",
    "there is now a growing list of quantum tasks  @xcite such as cryptography , error correcting schemes , quantum teleportation , etc . that have indicated even more the desirability of experimental implementations of quantum computing . in a quantum computer each quantum bit ( qubit ) is allowed to be in any state of a quantum two - level system .",
    "all quantum algorithms can be implemented by concatenating one- and two - qubit gates .",
    "there is a growing number of proposed physical implementations of qubits and quantum gates .",
    "a few examples are : trapped ions  @xcite , cavity qed  @xcite , nuclear spins  @xcite , superconducting devices  @xcite , and our qubit proposal  @xcite based on the spin of the electron in quantum - confined nanostructures .    coupled quantum dots provide a powerful source of deterministic entanglement between qubits of localized but also of delocalized electrons  @xcite .",
    "e.g. , with such quantum gates it is possible to create a singlet state out of two electrons and subsequently separate ( by electronic transport ) the two electrons spatially with the spins of the two electrons still being entangled  the prototype of an epr pair .",
    "this opens up the possibility to study a new class of quantum phenomena in electronic nanostructures  @xcite such as the entanglement and non - locality of electronic epr pairs , tests of bell inequalities , quantum teleportation  @xcite , and quantum cryptography  @xcite which promises secure information transmission .      in the present work ,",
    "quantum dots play a central role and thus we shall make some general remarks about these systems here .",
    "semiconductor quantum dots are structures where charge carriers are confined in all three spatial dimensions , the dot size being of the order of the fermi wavelength in the host material , typically between @xmath1 and @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "the confinement is usually achieved by electrical gating of a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) , possibly combined with etching techniques , see fig .",
    "[ figarray ] .",
    "precise control of the number of electrons in the    2    conduction band of a quantum dot ( starting from zero ) has been achieved in gaas heterostructures  @xcite .",
    "the electronic spectrum of typical quantum dots can vary strongly when an external magnetic field is applied  @xcite , since the magnetic length corresponding to typical laboratory fields @xmath3 is comparable to typical dot sizes . in coupled quantum dots",
    "coulomb blockade effects  @xcite , tunneling between neighboring dots  @xcite , and magnetization  @xcite have been observed as well as the formation of a delocalized single - particle state  @xcite .",
    "a fundamental problem in quantum physics is the issue of the decoherence of quantum systems and the transition between quantum and classical behavior .",
    "of course , a lot of attention has been devoted in fundamental mesoscopic research to characterizing and understanding the decoherence of electrons in small structures .",
    "we remind the reader , however , that most of what has been probed ( say in weak localization studies or the aharonov - bohm effect ) is the _",
    "orbital _ coherence of electron states , that is , the preservation of the relative phase of superpositions of spatial states of the electron ( e.g. , in the upper and lower arm of an aharonov - bohm ring ) .",
    "the coherence times seen in these investigations are almost completely irrelevant to the _ spin _ coherence times which are important in our quantum computer proposal .",
    "there is some relation between the two if there are strong spin - orbit effects , but our intention is that conditions and materials should be chosen such that these effects are weak .    under these circumstances",
    "the spin coherence times ( the time over which the phase of a superposition of spin - up and spin - down states is well - defined ) can be completely different from the charge coherence times ( a few nanoseconds ) , and in fact it is known that they can be orders of magnitude longer ( see below ) .",
    "this was actually one of our prime motivations for proposing spin  @xcite rather than charge as the qubit in these structures .",
    "the experimental measurement of this kind of coherence ( i.e.  for spins ) is not so familiar in mesoscopic physics , and thus it is worth describing it briefly here .    in recent magneto - optical experiments , based on time - resolved faraday rotation measurements ,",
    "long spin coherence times were found in doped gaas in the bulk and a 2deg@xcite . at vanishing magnetic field and @xmath4 , a transverse spin lifetime ( decoherence time ) @xmath5 exceeding @xmath6 was measured , with experimental indications that this time is a single - spin effect@xcite . since this number still includes inhomogeneous effects ",
    "g - factor variations in the material , leading to spins rotating with slightly different frequencies and thus reducing the total magnetization ",
    "it represents only a lower bound of the transverse lifetime of a _ single _ spin , @xmath7 , which is relevant for using spins as qubits . using the same pump - probe technique , spin lifetimes in semiconductor quantum dots",
    "have been measured  @xcite , with at most one spin per dot . the relatively small @xmath5 decoherence times",
    "( a few ns at vanishing magnetic field ) , which have been seen in these experiments , probably originate from a large inhomogeneous broadening due to a strong variation of g - factors  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the fact that many coherent oscillations were observed   provides strong experimental support to the idea of using electron spin as qubits .",
    "since none of the experiments have been done on an actual quantum computing structure as we envision it ( see below ) , the existing results can not be viewed as conclusive . because of sensitivity to details , theory can only give general guidance about the mechanisms and dependencies to be looked for , but can not make reliable _ a priori _ predictions of the decoherence times .",
    "in fact there are further complications  @xcite : we know theoretically that decoherence is not actually fully characterized by a single rate ; in fact , a whole set of numbers is needed to fully characterize the decoherence process ( 12 in principle for individual qubits ) , and no experiment has been set up yet to completely measure this set of parameters , although the theory of these measurements is available .",
    "even worse , decoherence effects will in principle be modified by the act of performing quantum computation ( during gate operation , decoherence is occurring in a coupled qubit system@xcite ) .",
    "we believe that the full characterization of decoherence will involve ongoing iteration between theory and experiment , and will thus be inseparable from the act of building a reliable quantum computer .",
    "still , we should mention that recent calculations  @xcite including spin - orbit interaction lead to unusually low phonon - assisted spin - flip rates in quantum dots , which indicates long spin - decoherence times . we will discuss spin - qubit errors due to nuclear spins  @xcite below in sec .",
    "[ ssecnuc ] .      for the implementation of realistic calculations on a quantum computer",
    ", a large number of qubits will be necessary ( on the order of @xmath8 ) .",
    "for this it is essential that the underlying concept can be scaled up to a large number of qubits , which then can be operated in parallel ( parallelism is required in known error correction schemes , see sec .  [ ssecerror ] ) .",
    "this scaling requirement is well achievable with spin - based qubits confined in quantum dots , since producing arrays of quantum dots  @xcite is feasible with state - of - the - art techniques of defining nanostructures in semiconductors .",
    "of course , the actual implementation of such arrays including all the needed circuits poses experimental challenges , but at least we are not aware of physical restrictions which would exclude such an upscaling for spin - qubits .      as we discuss in sec .",
    "[ sec2bit ] and  [ secsspinrot ] , quantum gate operations will be controlled through an effective hamiltonian @xmath9 which is switched via external control fields @xmath10 .",
    "note that in the following the exchange coupling is local , i.e.  @xmath11 is finite only for neighboring qubits .",
    "however , in cavity - qed systems , there is also a long - range coupling of qubits as some of us have described in ref .",
    "but even if the exchange coupling is only local , operations on non - neighboring qubits can still be performed . since one can swap the state of two qubits with the help of the exchange interaction only , as we will show in sec .",
    "[ sec2bit ] , the qubits can be moved around in an array of quantum dots .",
    "thus , a qubit can be transported to a place where it can be coupled with a desired second qubit , where single - qubit operations can be performed , or where it can be measured .",
    "the gating mechanisms described in sec .  [ sec2bit ] and  [ secsspinrot ] do not depend on the shape of @xmath12 , where @xmath13 stands for the exchange coupling @xmath14 or the zeeman interaction . only the time integral @xmath15 needs to assume a certain value ( modulo @xmath16 ) . the exchange interaction @xmath17 should be switched adiabatically , i.e.  such that @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the energy scale on which excitations may occur . here",
    ", @xmath19 should be taken as the energy - level separation of a single dot ( if spin is conserved ) .",
    "a rectangular pulse leads to excitation of higher levels , whereas an adiabatic pulse with amplitude @xmath20 is e.g.  given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 controls the width of the pulse .",
    "we need to use a switching time @xmath23 , such that @xmath24 becomes vanishingly small .",
    "we then have @xmath25 , so we need @xmath26 for adiabatic switching .",
    "the fourier transform @xmath27 has the same shape as @xmath10 but width @xmath28 .",
    "in particular , @xmath29 decays exponentially in the frequency @xmath30 , whereas it decays only with @xmath31 for a rectangular pulse .",
    "single qubit operations can be performed for example in g - factor - modulated materials , as proposed in sec .",
    "[ secsspinrot ] .",
    "a spin can be rotated by a relative angle of @xmath32 through changing the effective g - factor by @xmath33 for a time @xmath34 .",
    "thus , a typical switching time for an angle @xmath35 , a field @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is @xmath38 .",
    "if slower operations are required , they are easily implemented by choosing a smaller @xmath33 , reducing the magnitude of the field @xmath39 , or by replacing @xmath40 by @xmath41 with integer @xmath42 , thus `` overrotating '' the spin .",
    "next we consider two exchange - coupled spins , which perform a square - root - of - swap gate for the integrated pulse @xmath43 , as described in sec .",
    "[ sec2bit ] .",
    "we apply a pulse ( see sec .",
    "[ ssecpulse ] ) @xmath44 with @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "again , we calculate a switching time @xmath47 , while the adiabaticity criterion is @xmath48 .",
    "once more , the switching time can be easily increased by adding @xmath49 with integer @xmath42 to the integrated pulse @xmath50 , i.e.  by `` overswapping '' the two spins .",
    "this increased switching time allows a slower switching of @xmath17 if required .",
    "further , we note that the total time consumed by an algorithm can be optimized considerably by simultaneously switching different parameters of the hamiltonian , i.e.  producing parallel instead of serial pulses . as an example",
    ", we have shown that for an error - correcting algorithm using only three qubits , a speed - up of a factor of two can be achieved  @xcite . for algorithms handling a larger number of qubits , a more drastic optimization can be expected .",
    "one of the main goals in quantum computation is the realization of a reliable error - correction scheme  @xcite , which requires gate operations with an error rate not larger than one part in @xmath51 . taking the ratio of the dephasing time from sec .",
    "[ sseccoherence ] , @xmath52 , and the switching times from sec .",
    "[ ssecgatetime ] , @xmath53 , we see that the targeted error rate seems not to be out of reach in the near future . from there on , an arbitrary upscaling of a quantum computer becomes feasible and is no further limited by decoherence and lacking gate precision , at least when systems with a scalable number of qubits are considered .",
    "we note that a larger number of qubits also requires a larger total number of gate operations to be performed , in order to implement the error - correction schemes .",
    "therefore it is inevitable to perform these operations in parallel ; otherwise the pursued gain in computational power is used up for error correction .",
    "hence , one favors concepts where a localized control of the gates can be realized such that operations can be performed in parallel .",
    "however , since there are still many milestones to reach before sophisticated error - correction schemes can be applied , one should by no means disregard setups where gate operations are performed in a serial way .",
    "quantum computation is not only spoiled by decoherence , but also by a limited precision of the gates , i.e.  by the limited precision of the hamiltonian . in order for error correcting schemes to work",
    ", the ( time integrated ) exchange and zeeman interaction need to be controlled again in about one part in @xmath51 . while this requirement is present in all quantum computer proposals",
    ", it emphasizes the importance of gates with fine control .",
    "after a gate operation was performed on two qubits , one should be able to turn off the coupling between these qubits very efficiently , e.g.  exponentially in the external fields , such that errors resulting from the remaining coupling can be reduced efficiently ( if there is still a remaining coupling this can easily result in correlated errors ; however , such correlated errors would pose new problems since known error correction schemes explicitly exclude them ) .",
    "the exchange coupling between two quantum dots can be indeed suppressed exponentially , as we will describe below in sec .",
    "[ sec2bit ] . a further possible source of errors are fluctuating charges in the environment ( e.g.  moving charges in the leads attached to the gates ) since they can lead to unknown shifts of the electrostatic potentials raised and lowered for switching .",
    "however , it is known from experiments on single quantum dots that such charge fluctuations can be controlled on the scale of hours @xcite which is sufficiently long on the time - scale set by the spin decoherence time which can be on the order of @xmath54 secs .",
    "still , the ability to suppress 1/f noise will be very important for well - controlled switching in quantum computation .",
    "finally , we note that uncontrolled charge switching is not nearly so great a problem for spin qubits as for charge qubits , since this switching does not couple directly to the spin degree of freedom .",
    "it turns out that a serious source of possible qubit errors using semiconductors such as gaas is the hyperfine coupling between electron spin ( qubit ) and nuclear spins in the quantum dot  @xcite . in gaas semiconductors , both ga and as possess a nuclear spin @xmath55 , and no ga / as isotopes are available with zero nuclear spin",
    "this is in contrast to si - based structures which would be more advantageous from this aspect .",
    "however , in si the control over nanostructures such as quantum dots is not as advanced as in gaas yet , but this might be just a question of time .",
    "anyway , we shall now see that such decoherence effects can also be controlled by creating an overhauser field  @xcite .",
    "the hyperfine coupling between the electron spin @xmath56 and the nuclear spins @xmath57 , is given by @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the hyperfine coupling constant . due to this coupling ,",
    "a flip of the electron spin with a concomitant change of one nuclear spin may occur , causing an error in the quantum computation .",
    "we have analyzed this error in the presence of a magnetic field  @xmath60  @xcite , and find in time - dependent perturbation theory that the total probability for a flip of the electron spin oscillates in time .",
    "the amplitude of these oscillations is @xmath61 where @xmath39 is defined below and @xmath62 is the maximal magnitude of the effective nuclear field ( overhauser field ) . in typical quantum dots we have @xmath63 . if @xmath64 and with a polarization @xmath65 , @xmath66 of the nuclear spins , an effective nuclear field @xmath67 is produced and the transition probability becomes suppressed with @xmath68 .",
    "such a polarization @xmath69 can be established by dynamically spin - polarizing the nuclear spins , e.g.   by optical pumping  @xcite or by spin - polarized currents at the edge of a 2deg  @xcite .",
    "for these methods , nuclear overhauser fields are reported as large as @xmath70 in gaas ( corresponding to @xmath71 )  @xcite and which can have a lifetime on the order of minutes  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , for unpolarized nuclei , the amplitude of @xmath72 can be suppressed by an external field @xmath73 [ eq .  ( [ eqnprobflip ] ) ] .",
    "thus , the decoherence of an electron spin due to hyperfine interaction can be suppressed drastically , either by dynamically polarizing the nuclear spins in the host material or by applying an external magnetic field .",
    "it would be highly desirable to test this prediction by measuring the electron - spin @xmath74 time with and without overhauser field .      at the beginning of most algorithms for quantum computers as well as",
    "an input for error correcting schemes , initialized qubits are required , i.e.  qubits in a well defined state such as spin up , @xmath75 .",
    "single spins can be polarized by exposing them to a large magnetic field @xmath76 and letting them relax to the ground state .",
    "such a magnetic field could be applied locally or realized by forcing the electrons ( via external gates ) into a magnetized layer , into a layer with a different effective g - factor  @xcite or into a layer with polarized nuclear spins ( overhauser effect )  @xcite etc .",
    ", see also fig .  [ figarray ] and sec .",
    "[ secsspinrot ] .",
    "if a spin - polarized current can be produced , such as by spin - polarizing materials  @xcite or by spin - filtering with the help of another dot  @xcite ( see sec .  [ ssecspinfilter ] ) , polarized electrons can be injected into an empty quantum dot , i.e.  the dot is filled with an already initialized spin .    for some algorithms",
    ", it is favorable to start with a given initial state , such as @xmath77 , instead of a ground state @xmath78 .",
    "this can be readily implemented with spins as qubits using standard electron spin resonance ( esr ) techniques  @xcite : we start with a ground state @xmath78 .",
    "then we produce a zeeman splitting by applying a static local magnetic field for these spins , which should be initialized into state @xmath79 .",
    "an ac magnetic field is then applied perpendicularly to the first field with a resonant frequency that matches the larmor frequency @xmath80 . due to paramagnetic resonance  @xcite ,",
    "this causes spin - flips in the quantum dots with the corresponding zeeman splitting , thus producing the desired state .",
    "we note that since we do not want to affect the other spins ( having a different zeeman splitting ) the amplitude of the ac field must be switched adiabatically , see sec .",
    "[ ssecpulse ] . of course ,",
    "spin precession can also be used to perform single - spin rotations ( see sec .  [ secsspinrot ] ) .",
    "the main component for every computer concept is a multi-(qu)bit gate , which eventually allows calculations through combination of several ( qu)bits . since two - qubit gates are ( in combination with single - qubit operations ) sufficient for quantum computation  @xcite  they form a universal set  we now focus on a mechanism that couples pairs of spin - qubits .",
    "such a mechanism exists in coupled quantum dots , resulting from the combined action of the coulomb interaction and the pauli exclusion principle . two coupled electrons in absence of a magnetic field have a spin - singlet ground state , while the first excited state in the presence of strong coulomb repulsion is a spin triplet .",
    "higher excited states are separated from these two lowest states by an energy gap , given either by the coulomb repulsion or the single - particle confinement .",
    "the low - energy dynamics of such a system can be described by the effective heisenberg spin hamiltonian @xmath81 where @xmath17 denotes the exchange coupling between the two spins @xmath82 and @xmath83 , i.e.  the energy difference between the triplet and the singlet . after a pulse of @xmath17 with @xmath84 ( mod @xmath16 )",
    ", the time evolution @xmath85 corresponds to the `` swap '' operator @xmath86 , whose application leads to an interchange of the states in qubit  1 and  2  @xcite . while @xmath86 is not sufficient for quantum computation , any of its square roots @xmath87 , say @xmath88 , turns out to be a _ universal _ quantum gate .",
    "thus , it can be used , together with single - qubit rotations , to assemble any quantum algorithm .",
    "this is shown by constructing the known universal gate xor  @xcite , through combination of @xmath87 and single - qubit operations @xmath89 , applied in the sequence  @xcite , @xmath90    with these universal gates at hand , we can reduce the study of general quantum computation to the study of single - spin rotations ( see sec .  [ secsspinrot ] ) and the _ exchange mechanism _ ,",
    "in particular how @xmath17 can be controlled experimentally .",
    "the central idea is that @xmath17 can be switched by raising or lowering the tunneling barrier between the dots . in the following",
    ", we shall review our detailed calculations to describe such a mechanism .",
    "we note that the same principles can also be applied to other spin systems in quantum - confined structures , such as coupled atoms in a crystal , supramolecular structures , and overlapping shallow donors in semiconductors  @xcite etc . , using similar methods as explained below .",
    "we point out that , beyond the mechanisms described in sec .",
    "[ ssecldots ] and sec .",
    "[ ssecvdots ] , spins in quantum dots can also be coupled on a long distance scale by using a cavity - qed scheme  @xcite or by using superconducting leads to which the quantum dots are attached  @xcite , see sec .",

    "we consider a system of two coupled quantum dots in a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) , containing one ( excess ) electron each , as described in sec .",
    "[ ssecqd ] .",
    "the dots are arranged in a plane , at a sufficiently small distance @xmath91 , such that the electrons can tunnel between the dots ( for a lowered barrier ) and an exchange interaction @xmath14 between the two spins is produced .",
    "we model this system of coupled dots with the hamiltonian @xmath92 , where the single - electron dynamics in the 2deg ( @xmath93-plane ) is described through @xmath94 with @xmath95 being the effective mass and @xmath96 the confinement potential as given below .",
    "a magnetic field @xmath97 is applied along the @xmath98-axis , which couples to the electron spin through the zeeman interaction @xmath99 and to the charge through the vector potential @xmath100 . in almost depleted regions , like few - electron quantum dots",
    ", the screening length @xmath101 can be expected to be much larger than the screening length in bulk 2deg regions ( where it is @xmath102 for gaas ) .",

    "this is motivated by the experimental evidence that the low - energy spectrum of single dots is well described by a parabolic confinement potential  @xcite .",

    "a requirement for quantum computing is the possibility to perform one - qubit operations , which translates in the context of spins into single - spin rotations .",

    "when we consider the injection of entangled electrons into a fermi sea , we must keep in mind that there is always coulomb interaction present with all the other electrons in the leads .",

    "thus , if we now consider a two - electron state , we expect antibunching for the triplet states , since they have an antisymmetric orbital wave function , whereas the orbital wave function associated with the spin singlet state is symmetric , and so we expect a bunching behavior .",
    "this leads to an observable decrease or increase in noise for electrons , depending on their common spin state , as we shall discuss next  @xcite .",

    "a beam splitter is inserted in order to create two - particle interference effects in the sense that there is an equal probability amplitude for incoming electrons ( from lead 1 or 2 ) to leave into lead 3 or 4 ( note that the electrons in a fermi liquid wire hardly interact which each other ; the role of the beam splitter is thus to simulate direct and exchange coulomb processes ) .",

    "for this process , either a spin - down electron tunnels first  @xmath301 from the lower dot into the right lead and then  @xmath302 the spin - up electron from the left lead tunnels into the lower dot . or the upper dot participates via  @xmath303 and  @xmath304 , but now the state @xmath166 is involved , thus if the initial state on the double dot is a singlet , the transition amplitudes for upper and lower path acquire opposite signs , whereas there is no sign change if we started out from a triplet ( as shown for @xmath237 in fig .",
    "[ figddot ] ) .",
    "therefore , we can write the transition amplitudes @xmath305 for the lower path and @xmath306 for the upper path , where the upper / lower sign stands for a triplet / singlet initial state on the double - dot .",
    "this leads to a total transition amplitude of @xmath307 , and a current @xmath308 .",
    "note that the transition @xmath309 is inelastic whereas @xmath310 is not .",
    "for an initial singlet state on the double - dot , the other inelastic processes @xmath311 also yield a current proportional to @xmath312 , while the current from the elastic process @xmath313 is proportional to @xmath314 .",
    "similarly , starting with a triplet , the sign of the @xmath315 term is negative for an inelastic process , while it is positive for an elastic one . note that there is only one inelastic process @xmath316 , whereas there are more elastic processes allowed for @xmath317 .",
    "the total current is obtained by summing over all terms , yielding @xmath318 , where the upper sign stands for an initial triplet state and the lower sign for a singlet , in agreement with eq .",
    "( [ eqnidd ] ) .",
    "we finally emphasize that for the singlet @xmath319 and for the triplet @xmath237 the double - dot state is entangled , i.e.   a correlated two - particle state , and thus the proposed setup probes a genuine two - particle interference effect via the aharonov - bohm oscillations in the current ( noise ) . note also that we can continuously transmute the statistics from fermionic to bosonic ( like for anyons ) : the symmetric orbital part of @xmath319 goes into an antisymmetric one at half a flux quantum , and vice versa for @xmath237 .",
    "we have evaluated the noise also for finite frequencies  @xcite , and found that again @xmath320 , and , moreover , that the odd part of @xmath321 leads to slowly decaying oscillations of the noise in real time , @xmath322 , @xmath323 , which can be ascribed to a charge imbalance on the double dot during an uncertainty time @xmath324 .",
    "we finally note that the three triplets can be further distinguished by an orientationally inhomogeneous magnetic field which results in a spin - berry phase  @xcite that leads to left , right or no phase - shift in the aharonov - bohm oscillations of the current ( noise ) .",
    "we have considered a further scenario of double - dots  @xcite , where the dots are aligned in parallel between the leads , as in sec .",
    "[ ssecddot ] , but now no direct coupling is assumed between them .",
    "however , they are coupled with a tunneling amplitude @xmath290 to two superconducting leads .",
    "the s - wave superconductor favors an entangled singlet - state on the dots ( like in a cooper pair ) and further provides a mechanism for detecting the spin state via the josephson current .",
    "it turns out that in leading order @xmath325 the spin coupling is again described by a heisenberg hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath326 where @xmath327 , and the energy of the dot is @xmath328 below the lead fermi energy . here",
    ", @xmath329 is the average phase difference across the superconductor  double - dot  superconductor ( s - dd - s ) junction .",
    "we can modify the exchange coupling between the spins by tuning the external control parameters @xmath290 and @xmath329 .",
    "thus , we have presented here another implementation of a two - qubit quantum gate ( see sec .  [ sec2bit ] ) or an  entangler \" for epr transport ( see sec .",
    "[ ssecenoise ] ) . furthermore",
    ", the spin state on the dot can be probed if the superconducting leads are joined with one additional ( ordinary ) josephson junction with coupling @xmath330 and phase difference @xmath331 into a squid - ring .",
    "the supercurrent @xmath332 through this ring is given by  @xcite @xmath333 where @xmath334 .",
    "measurement of the spin- and flux - dependent critical current @xmath335 probes the spin state of the double dot .",
    "this is realized by biasing the system with a dc current @xmath336 until a finite voltage @xmath337 appears for @xmath338  @xcite .",
    "we have described a concept for a quantum computer based on electron spins in quantum - confined nanostructures , in particular quantum dots , and presented theoretical proposals for manipulation , coupling and detection of spins in such structures .",
    "we have discussed the requirements for initialization , read - in , gate operations , read - out , coherence , switching times and precision and their actual realization . by putting it all together ,",
    "we have illustrated how a scalable , all - electronically controlled quantum computer can be envisioned .",
    "we have shown that there is a fruitful link between mesoscopic transport phenomena and quantum communication that is based on production , detection and transport of electronic epr pairs .",
    "we have proposed and analyzed a variety of experimental setups which would probe novel spin - based phenomena in open and closed mesoscopic nanostructures .",
    "the involved physics , which is based on strong correlations and spin phase - coherence of electrons , is of fundamental interest in its own right ",
    "quite apart from future applications .    finally , by implementing the ideas proposed here , experimental evidence could be gained to demonstrate controlled entanglement and coherence of electron spins in nanostructures .",
    "this would be a first step in showing that the proposed scheme of spin - based qubits is indeed suitable for quantum computing and quantum communication .",
