    "in the local universe , powerful double - lobed radio sources are almost always associated with elliptical galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this association is consistent with leading galaxy formation models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it has long been postulated that elliptical galaxies form through the mergers of smaller galaxies @xcite .",
    "the merger of two gas - rich galaxies generates both star - formation and agn ( active galactic nucleus ) activity .",
    "the merger triggers a powerful nuclear starburst ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which generates strong starburst - driven winds , @xcite .",
    "these winds will eventually blow away the enshrouding dust and lay bare the quasar core , depleting the dust and gas to form an elliptical galaxy @xcite . although there are both starburst and quasar driven winds , quasar driven winds tend to occur at a later merger stage ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "at the same time , the merger fuels a pre - existing quiescent black hole ( i.e. radiatively efficient  quasar - mode  accretion , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "a good example of this process in action is the ulirg f00183 - 7111 @xcite where a radio - loud agn has turned on , but the star - formation is still ongoing .",
    "this activity ceases when the fuel supply to the central regions is exhausted , and most of the remaining gas is expelled , starving both the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) and the star - forming activity .",
    "thereafter , the black hole is being fed more slowly ( i.e. radiatively inefficient `` radio - mode '' accretion ) .",
    "that is to say , the merger of two gas - rich spiral forms an elliptical galaxy whilst launching radio - loud jets from the central agn ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "the kpc - scale double - lobed sources associated with agn are typically l@xmath9@xmath1010@xmath1whz@xmath2 .",
    "it is not uncommon for spiral galaxies with agn to host low - power ( l@xmath1110@xmath12whz@xmath2 ) radio jets , as in seyfert galaxies .",
    "however the majority of these radio sources are sub - kpc - scale , and confined within the optical galaxy ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although accretion of matter on to a central black hole can produce an agn , a merger may be required to launch kpc - scale jets @xcite .",
    "the process theorised to account for kpc - scale double - lobed radio sources requires the merger of two gas - rich galaxies , which eventually forms an elliptical .",
    "this model does not result in a gas - rich spiral hosting a powerful radio - emitting agn .",
    "powerful radio sources that are hosted by spiral and disk - dominated galaxies are known to exist at low - redshift , although to - date there are only a few tens of examples ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , most of which are hosted by disk - dominated or lenticular galaxies ( e.g. ngc612 , * ? ? ?",
    "the few examples of these have been studied in detail .",
    "table [ spirals ] gives a complete - to - date list of _ spiral _ galaxies that host large double - lobed radio sources .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     figure [ radec ] plots the spatial location of the 64 galaxies that are within @xmath13z = 0.003 ( @xmath13cz = 900kms@xmath2 ) of j1649 + 2635 .",
    "there is a hint of a velocity gradient across the field , with the closest galaxies ( blue larger open circles ) predominately north of j1649 + 2635 , and the more - distant galaxies ( red smaller open circles ) predominately south - west of j1649 + 2635",
    ". this may be further evidence for an unrelaxed system of galaxies .",
    "perhaps the system is a group of groups , similar to the environment surrounding 0313 - 192 .",
    "groups contain higher fractions of disk galaxies than clusters ( * ? ? ?",
    "figure [ dct ] shows the dct image with the galaxies that are at the same redshift circled in black .",
    "all of these galaxies show evidence for disk - like structure .",
    "in contrast , the morphologies of cluster members are often ellipticals .",
    "this is further evidence that this system is lower density than a classical cluster of galaxies .",
    "however , the large optical halo around j1649 + 2635 is more reminiscent of a cluster environment .        using the 1d projected velocity dispersion of the system ( figure [ hist ] ) , and following the relation from @xcite ,",
    "we compute the dynamical mass of the system to be m@xmath14m@xmath6 , where the errors are due to galaxy membership within the aperture used .",
    "further , @xcite note that due to the difficulty in relating the projected velocity dispersion to the true 3d velocity dispersion , the systematic error may be up to a factor of @xmath72 higher at low redshift .",
    "consequently we estimate the dynamical mass of the system to be m@xmath8m@xmath6 .",
    "this is consistent with the virial masses of groups of galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we have examined archival _",
    "rosat _ all - sky survey ( rass ) data , and have found no detection towards j1649 + 2635 .",
    "this implies an upper limit to the x - ray luminosity of @xmath15ergs@xmath2hz@xmath2 @xcite , and indicates an upper limit to the mass of @xmath16m@xmath6 @xcite , consistent with the value obtained using the velocity dispersion .",
    "we also note that j1649 + 2635 ( m@xmath17 = 15.5 ) is one of the two brightest galaxies in this system .",
    "the other bright galaxy , sdss j164933.52 + 265052.0 is at z = 0.0551 and is @xmath71mpc away .",
    "it is possible that this galaxy is the cd galaxy for a group or cluster that is in the process of interacting with a group or cluster that j1649 + 2635 resides in .",
    "there is no evidence for a larger - than - usual diffuse optical halo around the other bright galaxy .     z @xmath18 0.065 .",
    "the g - band magnitude of j1649 + 2635 is 15.5 . ]",
    "given the disk - like morphologies of the galaxies in the vicinity of j1649 + 2635 , and the dynamical mass estimate , we find the environment of j1649 + 2635 is more like a group of galaxies , than a cluster .",
    "this is also consistent with j1649 + 2635 being a red spiral , as red spirals are usually found in intermediate density environments .",
    "j1649 + 2635 is clearly `` hybrid '' in nature ; it is a star - forming spiral galaxy that has large - scale radio lobes .",
    "although this is generally unseen in the local universe , hybrid sources may be much more prevalent in the early universe ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "consequently , understanding the formation of sources such as j1649 + 2635 provides us with an excellent probe for the higher - redshift universe .",
    "here we offer three possible causes for the unusual association of a spiral galaxy with large - scale double - lobed radio emission .    *",
    "perhaps j1649 + 2635 is in the unique position of having undergone a planar minor merger that would not introduce angular momentum perpendicular to the plane , so as to not disrupt the spiral structure too much @xcite .",
    "the merger would have to dump sufficient matter ( @xmath19m@xmath6year@xmath2 , assuming 0.1 efficiency ) onto the central black hole so as to trigger radio lobes from the agn ( perhaps the black hole spins very rapidly similar to the @xcite model ) , and it is perhaps this process that quenches the star - formation giving this source its red colour over a few gyr .",
    "the presence of the large diffuse optical halo makes this process appear unlikely as the diffuse halo suggests multiple mergers have occurred , whereupon a spiral structure can not be sustained ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* alternatively , j1649 + 2635 may be a `` normal '' elliptical galaxy that has undergone some event ( such as a merger ) that has caused it to grow spiral arms .",
    "however , spiral arms require large reservoirs of gas to maintain .",
    "the red colour of this galaxy suggests that the gas supply has been cut - off , thus the spiral arms may decay quite quickly .",
    "* we offer one final possible explanation for this unique source .",
    "seyfert galaxies are known to harbour agn , and yet are predominately disk or spiral galaxies .",
    "seyfert galaxies are also predominately found in the field . what happens if a seyfert galaxy is in a dense environment ?",
    "could the igm support large - scale radio lobes ?",
    "in this paper we have presented the best example to date of a grand - design spiral hosting a kpc - scale double - lobed radio source .    in many ways , j1649 +",
    "2635 is a `` normal '' red spiral galaxy .",
    "it has clearly visible spiral arms and infrared data from wise and nuv data from galex both suggest that there is ongoing star - formation with sfr@xmath7 0.26  2.6m@xmath6year@xmath2 .",
    "j1649 + 2635 appears to reside in a group environment ( m@xmath8m@xmath6 ) , which is consistent with red spirals .    on the other hand , j1649 + 2635 hosts a @xmath20kpc double - lobed radio source .",
    "the association of large double - lobed radio sources with spiral galaxies is exceedingly rare in the local universe .",
    "moreover , the galaxy hosts a @xmath796kpc diffuse optical halo whose integrated surface brightness is comparable to that of the spiral disk . the halo is similar to those found around the centrally dominant cd galaxies in massive clusters .",
    "this is the first instance of a grand - design spiral hosting a large diffuse optical halo .",
    "the presence of a large and diffuse optical halo and the overdensity of galaxies detected by sdss implies that j1649 + 2635 sits in a group - sized gravitational halo .",
    "the non - gaussian redshift histogram supports the theory that the environment is unrelaxed , hinting at a merging system or unvirialised group .",
    "the black hole mass that we estimate for this source , m@xmath3 37 @xmath4 10@xmath5m@xmath6 , is consistent with the galaxy having perhaps undergone a merger .",
    "we considered three possible causes for the unusual association of a spiral galaxy with large - scale double - lobed radio emission .",
    "we suggested a planar merger may be responsible for the red colour and black - hole mass .",
    "however , if the diffuse halo is indicative of multiple mergers , this theory seems unlikely .",
    "we considered whether j1649 + 2635 is a `` normal '' elliptical galaxy that is undergoing a merger and serendipitously appears spiral for a brief period of time .",
    "finally , we speculate whether j1649 + 2635 may be a seyfert galaxy that is in a denser - than - normal environment .",
    "further observations are required to test these predictions .",
    "for example , long - slit or integrated field spectroscopic data over the source would enable us to determine the stellar population in the spiral arms .",
    "if large velocity dispersions are observed , this may be evidence for a recent merger .",
    "multi - object spectroscopy over the field would provide us the larger - scale clustering environment .",
    "observations of the hi-21 cm line in the system would enable us to determine the atomic gas mass and kinematics of this source and hence deduce if the hi properties are similar to other spiral galaxies .",
    "high - resolution radio imaging of the agn will enable us to probe the parsec - scale structure at the black hole and gain insight into the agn activity .",
    "finally , to determine whether the large - scale diffuse radio emission from j1649 + 2635 is consistent with a re - activated radio source , similar to speca and j2345 + 0449 , observations of the diffuse radio emission are required .    with the advent of citizen science projects such as galaxy zoo and radio galaxy zoo , perhaps many more of these enigmatic objects may be discovered . with this in mind , we propose calling these sources spiral dragns , the dragns acronym deriving from double - lobed radio sources associated with galactic nuclei @xcite .",
