    "the dynamics of few - body systems remains a robust field of research with many practical applications .",
    "a number of theoretical advances , coupled with increased computational resources , have lead to significant advances in both the understanding of few - body processes and in the number of physical systems that can be successfully treated with existing , well - tested methodologies ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we are , for example , currently developing public source code and a graphical user interface for scientists interested in solving faddeev equations numerically for a wide array of potential three - body applications .",
    "challenging computations that have been accessible to only a small group of specialists will soon become elementary and well characterized tools used by a large number of practitioners in different fields .",
    "solving the two - body schrdinger equation numerically is an elementary exercise in the case of smooth central potentials .",
    "typically , the power of modern computers makes it possible to use even the simplest numerical approaches to perform quite accurate calculations of the low - energy part of the two - body spectrum .",
    "three - or - more - body calculations , however , usually require greater attention to the details of numerical technique , as the required computer resources usually scale geometrically with the growth of dimensionality of the problem , and optimizing any aspect of the solution representation leads to substantial computational savings .    when solving bound state or scattering problems for few - body systems it is important to treat the states of two - body subsystems carefully , as such states represent the asymptotic boundary conditions for the corresponding few - body states .",
    "it is also important to minimize the computational cost of reproducing every asymptote of the few - body calculations .",
    "the key feature of the faddeev approach to few - body problem is the asymptotic factorability of the solutions , so that grids constructed for the efficient solution of the two - body problem can be immediately employed with considerable numerical advantage . in previous calculations",
    "@xcite this optimization has been performed manually .",
    "the procedure , however , is very time consuming and difficult for an inexperienced user or a student .",
    "therefore , we needed an automatic procedure of constructing an effective grid representation of the two - body subsystems .    methods of refining grids automatically are often used in solving various nonlinear evolution equations ( hydrodynamical equations , for example ) to reproduce discontinuities and other singular features of the solutions .",
    "in contrast , our goal is to create a software package specifically designed to solve the quantum - mechanical few - body problem , fully exploiting the features intrinsic to the physical problem and the numerical techniques to achieve high - performance of the resulting code .",
    "we therefore needed a solution which is on the one hand more specific to our problem , and on the other hand allows us to construct the grids on the base of some clearly understood physical and mathematical principles , with particular emphasis on reproducing the low - energy part of the two - body schrdinger operator for subsequent use in more complex few - body calculations .",
    "in this paper we describe and implement a practical nonuniform grid suitable for reproducing the low - energy part of the schrdinger operator for two - body systems .",
    "when applied to systems of more than two particles , this grid permits a several - fold reduction in the number of grid points required for a desired level of numerical accuracy .",
    "equally important , the procedure of constructing the grid is automatic and requires only minimal interference from a user .",
    "we are solving the schrdinger equation for a two - body system with central potentials using @xmath0 or @xmath1 hermite splines and collocations at gaussian points .",
    "we are constructing a nonuniform grid from the requirement of uniformity of the numerical error over the entire range where the solution is constructed .",
    "let us start from the radial schrdinger equation in atomic units ( a.u . ) chosen so that @xmath2 @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the reduced mass of the two - body system , subject to the dirichlet boundary conditions @xmath5 the right boundary of the interval @xmath6 is assumed to be chosen so that its influence can be neglected .",
    "let @xmath7 be a grid constructed over the interval @xmath8 $ ] consisting of @xmath9 intervals , @xmath10 is the map used to construct the nonuniform grid from a uniform grid .",
    "particularly , @xmath11 .",
    "the map @xmath12\\rightarrow[0,1]$ ] is a smooth function growing monotonically over the interval @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "the criterion we choose for constructing @xmath10 is the uniformity of numerical error over the whole interval @xmath14 $ ] .",
    "an approximate solution constructed with @xmath9 points deviates from the exact solution by @xmath15 at each sub - interval @xmath16 $ ] the residue norm can be estimated as @xmath17 where @xmath18 $ ] and @xmath19 is the order of the spline @xcite .",
    "the factors @xmath20 are determined by the properties of the equation and the chosen numerical scheme .",
    "we can optimize the distribution of the grid points so that the error @xmath21 has the same order of magnitude throughout the whole interval .",
    "it is useful to treat the length @xmath22 of the @xmath23-th interval as a continuous function @xmath24 . the function @xmath24 is naturally related to the derivative of the map @xmath25 @xmath26 and @xmath27 so , for sufficiently dense grids the _ i_-th grid step is determined by the slope of the mapping function .    if @xmath28 is some non - negative function , termed the `` grading function '' , that characterizes the local approximation error , then the integral @xmath29 provides a monotonic map connecting the non - uniform grid with a uniform one .",
    "@xmath25 is referred to herein as the `` mapping function '' . if the grading function is chosen so that it peaks in the regions that are the most difficult to reproduce numerically , the inverse of the mapping function @xmath30 will grow the most rapidly in the corresponding regions .",
    "the mapping function , therefore , will have smaller derivative .",
    "it will make the nonuniform grid denser where the function is more difficult to reproduce . characterizing the difficulty of representing the object function , the grading function can be linked to some derivative of the function being interpolated .",
    "for example , if using a linear interpolant , the error of approximation will be of the order of the second derivative of the interpolated function . a quantitative characterization of the error and optimal properties of the grading functions have been studied in ref .",
    "we shall use the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite for constructing an optimal map for solving eq .",
    "[ eq : schroedinger ] .",
    "suppose we have a sample function @xmath31 for which we seek a piece - wise polynomial approximant @xmath32 .",
    "it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that in order to minimize the @xmath33-norm of the error function @xmath34 the grading function @xmath28 should be chosen as @xmath35 where @xmath19 is the order of the polynomial approximant . according to @xcite this grading function provides an asymptotically @xmath33-optimal grid for a sufficiently large n , when the @xmath36 term in the equation ( [ eq : h_chi ] ) can be neglected .",
    "there are a few complications with implementing this approach directly .",
    "the exact sample function @xmath31 is unknown .",
    "moreover , our goal is an accurate approximation of an invariant subspace of the two - body hamiltonian which is characterized by several functions that are the eigenvectors of the hamiltonian .",
    "those complications , however , are not critical .    if we redefine the norm to be optimized for a vector function composed of a set of eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian @xmath37 , the optimal grading function takes the form @xmath38 although the explicit form of the functions @xmath39 is generally unknown , for our purpose we can use numerical approximation of these functions obtained on non - optimal grids .",
    "the resulting suboptimal estimates can be refined iteratively .    in the following sections we shall provide a few examples of how this approach can be realized in practice .",
    "before describing the grid construction algorithm itself , we shall briefly outline the discretization procedure for the simplest case of zero angular momentum @xmath40 .",
    "for discretization we use the orthogonal collocation scheme @xcite with the @xmath1 splines @xcite .",
    "we shall seek for a solution of eq .",

    "splines @xmath56 .",
    "following the strategy we described in the previous section , first we discretize the two - body hamiltonian using some non - optimal grid @xmath57 .",
    "a cubic mapping @xmath58 is , usually , a good starting point .",
    "next , we construct a sequence of grids @xmath59 and the corresponding approximations to the lowest @xmath60 eigenfunction @xmath61 .",
    "each subsequent grid @xmath62 is constructed using equations ( [ eq : chidef ] ) and ( [ eq : gradfun ] ) with approximate functions @xmath63 obtained at the previous step .",
    "we repeat the process several times until the grading function is stabilized .",
    "straightforward implementation of this approach , however , may look unrealistic .",
    "indeed , we seek a solution in terms of piecewise polynomial functions of 5-th order .",
    "evaluation of the grading function , however , requires evaluation of the 6-th order derivative of the solution .",
    "we , therefore , can not differentiate the spline expansion of the solution directly .",
    "instead , we apply the discrete analog of the second derivative operator @xmath64 three times .",
    "each application projects the corresponding derivative function back into the spline basis and this way an approximate 6-th derivative of the solution can be obtained .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : grading - functions ] we show an example of the sequence of the grading functions and the corresponding mappings @xmath65 for the lm2m2 ( he - he ) potential @xcite and ne - ne potential ( av5z+(3321 ) fit ) @xcite for @xmath0 splines ( for @xmath40 angular momentum ) . in both cases",
    "we have chosen the number of states @xmath60 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gradfun ] ) as the number of bound states supported by the potential plus one , so that the grid is optimized to reproduce all the bound states plus the continuum state closest to the threshold that satisfies the boundary conditions ( [ eq : bc ] ) .",
    "( the he - he potential supports one s - wave bound state and the ne - ne potential supports three . )    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     in table  [ tab : optimality - check - ne_2 ] we report the speeds of convergence for the energies of the s - wave bound states of the ne@xmath66 dimer .",
    "we have optimized the grid to reproduce the three bound states of the dimer and one state from the continuum .",
    "the speed of convergence coefficient for the near - threshold state clearly reaches its minimum at the theoretically optimal value of @xmath19 , which confirms the practicality of our approach .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the practical value of optimizing the grids for two - body states lies in their application to more complex few - body calculations . in this case",
    ", reducing the number of points needed to achieve the required accuracy is critical for saving computational time .",
    "the direct use of the two - body optimized grids described in the previous section is especially appropriate in the faddeev ( three - body)@xcite or faddeev - yakubovsky ( four - body )  @xcite formalism .",
    "when solving the faddeev equations , as we shall briefly discuss below , it is natural to represent the grid as a direct product of the grid supporting the two - body bound states , and grids describing other coordinates in the configuration space of the three - body system .",
    "we shall demonstrate , that optimizing the grid even in one of the coordinates can improve the accuracy of the three - body calculations substantially .    here , for simplicity",
    ", we shall discuss only the three - body calculations below the three - body threshold , which physically means that we restrict our attention to three - body bound states or scattering with only two clusters in the initial and the final states of the system . within the faddeev approach the wave function of such states resolves into a sum of three components @xmath67 that correspond to different partitionings of the three - body system into an interacting two - body subsystem and the free third particle .",
    "@xmath68 and @xmath69 are the jacobi coordinates for the @xmath23-th partitioning : @xmath68 connects the particles in the @xmath70 pair , @xmath69 points to the remaining particle from the @xmath23-th pair center of mass .",
    "the asymptotic properties of the components @xmath71 below the three - body threshold are very simple : at large distances between the @xmath23-th particle and the center of mass of the corresponding two - body cluster ( @xmath72 ) , the faddeev components factorize . in the very simplest case of one single s - wave bound state in the pair",
    "the components @xmath71 behave as @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the wave function of the two - body subsystem and @xmath75 describes the free motion of the third particle .",
    "when solving the faddeev equation numerically , we , therefore , need to be able to reproduce the behavior of the two - body clusters accurately . for this purpose",
    "we use the grid optimization procedure described above . in principle",
    ", it is also possible to develop some simple criteria for optimizing grids in the reaction coordinates @xmath76 .",
    "this problem , however , is beyond the goals of this paper and we shall discuss it elsewhere .    in order to demonstrate the importance of using optimized two - body grids in three - body calculations we have performed a series of calculations of he@xmath77 ground and excited states with both optimized and non - optimized grids using a different number of points in the cluster coordinates . the number of points as well as the grid shape in the reaction coordinate @xmath76 has been fixed for all sets of calculations .",
    "we used 100 grid points with @xmath1 splines in the @xmath76 coordinate , the cutoff radius has been set to @xmath78  a.u . and",
    "@xmath79 mapping has been used to construct the non - uniform grid .",
    "as our three - body calculations here are only for purposes of demonstration , we used the simplest possible grid consisting of one single interval in the angular coordinate ( which is the cosine of the angle between the direction to the third particle and the axis of the he@xmath80 cluster ) .",
    "we used @xmath1 splines in the angular coordinate . in this case the angular basis reduces to polynomials of 5-th degree .",
    "the angular symmetry of the system has not been taken into account explicitly , and , effectively , such angular basis corresponds to taking into account two first virtual rotational excitations ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "more details on the method we use to solve faddeev equations can be found in @xcite .",
    "the results are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : threebodys32 ] and [ fig : threebodys53 ] , where we have plotted the energies of the trimer bound states calculated using @xmath0 ( fig .",

    "[ fig : threebodys53 ] ) as functions of the ( appropriately scaled ) number of grid points in the cluster coordinate . in both cases we observe much faster convergence and much smaller variation of the numerical results when using the optimized grids in cluster coordinates .",

    "we have presented an approach to constructing an optimized nonuniform grid for use in quantum few - body calculations .",
    "the approach is based on the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , where a grading function which asymptotically minimizes the @xmath96 norm of the interpolation error is introduced .",
    "we have slightly modified the optimization criterion to have several low - lying eigenstates of the two - body hamiltonian interpolated well .",

    "the optimized grids , even being only asymptotically optimal , demonstrate convergence properties superior to other choices of non - uniform grids routinely employed in few - body calculations .",
    "as far as rotational excitations of a two - body system can be taken into account perturbatively , it is sufficient to optimize the grids to reproduce the s - wave only and there is no need to optimize the grid for all the rotational excitations .",

    "all the states that contribute to the long - range asymptote of the few - body system must be included into the grading function . including some extra states",
