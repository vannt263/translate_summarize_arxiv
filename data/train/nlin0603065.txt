    "sawtooth oscillations @xcite , commonly observed in current carrying , magnetically confined plasmas , are believed to be the result of resistive internal kink mode i.e. @xmath0 oscillation .",
    "these oscillations are characterized by a relatively slow rise of the electron temperature in the central region of the plasma column followed by a rapid drop ( the crash ) .",
    "this is a typical nature of a _ stick - slip _ or _ relaxation _",
    "oscillation @xcite , where the stress is slowly built up and then suddenly released after a certain threshold , observed in many other dynamical systems e.g. portevin - le chatelier effect @xcite , a matter of interest in material science .",
    "in this work , we propose a _ minimal _",
    "( low - dimensional ) dynamical model for sawtooth oscillation in tokamaks , based on a transport catastrophe due to a thermal instability @xcite . low - dimensional or low - order dynamical system i.e. a system of coupled ordinary differential equations , has several advantages over a detailed physical model of the actual system in the understanding of the global behaviour of the system .",
    "these models become powerful as they are supported by well developed mathematical theories which can be used to gain insight into the qualitative behaviour of the system such as bifurcation and stability @xcite .",
    "several examples of these models can be found in the context of understanding the behaviour of fusion plasmas ranging from the edge localized modes ( elm ) @xcite to plasma turbulence @xcite .    in spite of a great deal of experimental and theoretical research ,",
    "the sawteeth in tokamaks continue to be a subject of exploration . for example , though numerical simulations @xcite and some experimental results @xcite suggest total reconnection within the safety factor @xmath1 surface during a sawtooth crash , there are also experimental evidences @xcite , which indicate that @xmath2 remains well below unity during a sawtooth cycle .",
    "apparently , there have been several important contributions to the understanding of the sawtooth dynamics e.g. sawteeth with partial reconnection , based on turbulent transport @xcite . a taylor relaxation model of the sawteeth",
    "has also been considered by gimblett and hastie @xcite .    here , we primarily focus on the dynamics of sawtooth oscillations based on a low - dimensional dynamical model .",
    "we rigorously prove that this dynamical model of the sawteeth based on thermal instability , besides capturing the important physical aspects , does exhibit well defined , isolated limit cycle oscillations , characteristics of self - excited relaxation phenomena like the sawteeth .",
    "alternatively , several authors have proposed hamiltonian models @xcite , which however can have infinite number of periodic solutions depending on the starting points of the evolution with the same set of physical parameters , which is rather inconsistent with the universal nature of sawteeth for similar experimental conditions .",
    "these models , despite having dissipation , possess a conserved quantity much like the hamiltonian of a conjugate system .    in section",
    "ii , we formulate the minimal dynamical model . in section iii , we analyse the bifurcation and stability of the system , pointing out the existence of an isolated and unique limit cycle and its global stability .",
    "we complete this section by proving the uniqueness of the limit cycle where we demonstrate the existence of an algebraic equation for the limit cycle .",
    "next , in section iv , we address the issue of relaxation oscillation and explore the parameter regime where the limit cycle exhibits sawtooth - like oscillations . in section",
    "v , with the help of a renormalization group method , we prove that the invariant manifold of the dynamical system is indeed the slow manifold of the relaxation oscillation . in the appendix",
    ", we outline the hamiltonian approach to this dynamical model .",
    "typical sawtooth oscillations in small tokamaks @xmath3 exhibit linear growth of central temperature with few milliseconds of duration and rapid crash time of @xmath4 several microseconds , in the ohmic heating phase @xcite .",
    "although there are several other exotic cases viz .",
    "giant and monster sawteeth @xcite , we shall limit our discussion to the simpler type of sawteeth with a linear rise of the electron temperature .",
    "the dynamical system , controlling the sawtooth oscillations of the central electron temperature , then can be written as @xcite@xmath5 where @xmath6 is the central electron temperature expressed in energy units , @xmath7 is the amplitude of the oscillation , @xmath8 is the rate of temperature redistribution , and @xmath9 is the growth rate of the relevant mode . the collisional parallel conductivity @xmath10 . in the above equations , the particle density @xmath11 remains nearly constant during the sawtooth cycle , which is consistent with experimental observations .",
    "we further note that in the cases of sawtooth oscillations , we are going to consider , the classical diffusion time @xcite for the plasma current within the @xmath12 volume , @xmath13 ( where @xmath14 is the radius of the @xmath1 surface , @xmath15 is the plasma skin depth , and @xmath16 is the electron - ion collision frequency ) , is one order of magnitude higher than the sawtooth repetition time . for example , in the alcator c - mod ( mit ) machine , typically , @xmath17-@xmath18 for ohmic regimes @xcite , whereas the sawtooth period ( crash time being negligibly smaller than the period ) @xmath19",
    ". therefore it can be safely assumed that the current redistribution does not play any significant role and the corresponding @xmath20 remains constant .",
    "we further assume that the pressure redistribution parameter @xmath8 can be expressed with simple power laws i.e. @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are arbitrary constants .    with these considerations",
    ", we note that the second term in eq.(1 ) is responsible for the sawtooth crash .",
    "however , in absence of this term the general solution of eq.(1 ) is explosive . in particular",
    ", it should include a loss term , which takes into account all other losses e.g. radiation loss , electron thermal diffusion @xcite , and neoclassical loss @xcite etc . with a diffusive loss term , eq.(1 )",
    "can be rewritten as@xmath24 where @xmath25 is the overall plasma energy confinement time inside the @xmath1 surface and @xmath26 is a proportionality constant .",
    "in fact , the presence of the diffusive loss term can be understood from the usual pressure gradient equation without taking into account the instability which causes the ejection of plasma energy due to sawtooth crashes,@xmath27 where @xmath28 is the plasma pressure , @xmath29 is the ohmic source term i.e. the heating power density per unit volume , and @xmath30 is the plasma thermal conductivity perpendicular to the magnetic field . attributing all other losses to this diffusive term , we can write @xcite@xmath31 considering the fact that the plasma confinement time @xmath25 scales as @xmath32 , @xmath33 being the minor radius of the torus and @xmath34 , a diffusion coefficient which obeys bohm - like diffusion , i.e. @xmath35 , where @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the ion gyro - radius , and @xmath38 is the ambient toroidal magnetic filed . assuming that @xmath39 , the last term in eq.(3 ) can be shown to scale as @xmath40 and eq.(3 ) becomes@xmath41 where @xmath42 is a constant of proportionality . note that the above relation of electron temperature evolution closely resembles the corresponding equation of sawtooth model by kubota et .",
    "@xcite , based on transport bifurcation .",
    "we now consider eq.(2 ) which controls the amplitude evolution of the mode . during one sawtooth cycle of the profile shown in fig.1 , observed in the alcator c - mod machine at mit @xcite .",
    "since the sawtooth crash time is much smaller than the sawtooth growth time , the mode amplitude can be considered to have a ` spike - like ' behavior . in the limiting case ,",
    "the spike becomes a singularity and can be represented by a @xmath43 function,@xmath44 centered around @xmath45 .",
    "the corresponding relation for @xmath6 can be found out from eq.(1 ) as@xmath46 where @xmath47 is some constant and @xmath48 is the heaviside step function .",
    "this behavior of @xmath6 shows a perfect sawtooth with a crash occurring at @xmath45 and a discontinuity in @xmath6 . in practice ,",
    "the ` spike - like ' behavior of amplitude @xmath7 can be approximated by an exponential function,@xmath49,\\ ] ] where @xmath50 is some large positive number .",
    "the corresponding @xmath6 is@xmath51 the related differential equation in @xmath7 is , therefore,@xmath52 the coefficient of @xmath7 on the right hand side of the above equation can be viewed as @xmath53 .",
    "so the complete set of dynamical equations can now be written as @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the threshold temperature for the onset of the relevant instability .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the model proposed by haas and thyagaraja @xcite , based on turbulent transport essentially reduces to the above equations when the neoclassical losses are discarded ( they have a exclusive term to take care of the neoclassical loss ) .    at this point , we would like to note that in reality , sawtooth oscillations in magnetically confined plasmas are result of evolution of a ` driven - dissipative ' system . during a sawtooth cycle ,",
    "the plasma is heated by the current through ohmic dissipation which is essentially lost to the environment after the plasma breakdown or the sawtooth crash .",
    "the sawtooth is repeated as the plasma current continues to dissipate energy into the plasma . here",
    ", the plasma current is the driving mechanism of the sawtooth oscillation through which , the energy is being continuously dissipated . however , there is no driving source in eq.(12 ) and the oscillations represented by eqs.(12 - 13 ) appears to be self - sustaining i.e. a `` self heating  dissipating  feedback  heating '' cycle with a positive and negative damping mechanism through the terms @xmath56 .",
    "the justification for eq.(12 ) comes from the fact that we are looking only at the power balance equation for the confined plasma @xcite , not at the full burn - cycle of the plasma confinement .",
    "so , as far as the plasma power balance is concerned , we assume that there is a perpetual source of energy in the form of the plasma current provided externally through the loop voltage , which is the driving mechanism and an infinite sink which drains away the energy dissipated through the sawtooth crash .",
    "as the whole cycle repeats , the power balance equation becomes self - sustaining .",
    "we further note that during the sawtooth ramp phase , there is a definite change in the magnetic configuration , which rearranges itself after the sawtooth crash either through a partial or complete reconnection @xcite .",
    "as this magnetic reorientation causes the electron temperature to drop during the sawtooth crash , we have dynamically modeled this event by the second term @xmath57 , in eq.(12 ) .",
    "in this section , we examine the possibility of existence of periodic orbits of eqs.(12 ) and ( 13 ) , in particular existence of any limit set .",
    "this is to be viewed in contrast to the hamiltonian formalism ( see appendix ) , which always admits periodic solutions , though the solutions are not unique .",
    "we begin by expressing these dynamical equations in a generic dimensionless form .",
    "the electron temperature @xmath6 is normalized by the threshold temperature @xmath55 and define @xmath58 .",
    "we further define the other dimensionless quantities as@xmath59 the quantity @xmath60 denotes the normalized amplitude of the mode and the quantity @xmath29 is the ohmic source term corresponding to the threshold temperature @xmath55,@xmath61 the quantity @xmath62 being the collisional conductivity at @xmath63 . with these definitions , the set of eqs.(12 ) and ( 13 ) can be written in a generic form as @xmath64 where @xmath65 .",
    "note that in writing these equations we have re - scaled the time as @xmath66 . as we shall see shortly that the constant @xmath67 while @xmath68 which is related to the growth rate can be quite large i.e. @xmath69 .",
    "the dots represent the derivatives with respect to the rescaled time @xmath70 .    in order to examine the bifurcation diagram of eqs.(16 ) and",
    "( 17 ) and existence of limit cycle oscillation , it is instructive to construct a phase portrait of the equations , which is shown in fig.2 .",
    "the arrows on the curves show the direction of time .",
    "as can be seen , there are three fixed points , ` a ' , ` b ' , and ` c ' located at @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 , respectively . point ` a ' at the origin is a non - isolated fixed point .",
    "point ` c ' is a saddle point .",
    "the only fixed point of interest is the point ` b ' which is either a stable or unstable point depending on values of @xmath22 and @xmath33 .",
    "we are also interested in this fixed point as this is the only point which is in the positive quadrant as the variables @xmath74 and @xmath60 may take only positive values . in what follows , we shall show that surrounding the fixed point ` b ' , we can construct a positively invariant region @xcite lying entirely in the first quadrant .",
    "consider now , a set of curves @xmath75 given by the equations@xmath76-\\delta,\\\\ f_{4}(x ) & = & \\mathcal{d}(1-x)^{2\\mu+1},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath77 can be a large positive number , @xmath43 is a small positive number , and @xmath78 and @xmath50 are positive arbitrary constants .",
    "the nullclines of the eqs.(16 ) and ( 17 ) are given by the equations@xmath79 if we now span a region ( see fig.3 ) described by the set of curves @xmath75s through the points @xmath80 , @xmath73 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82  the points of intersection of the curves @xmath75 and @xmath83 , @xmath82 being the common point of intersection of @xmath84 and @xmath85 , it can be shown by comparing the slopes of the curves @xmath75s with that of the orbit described by eqs.(16 ) and ( 17 ) , that the flow of the orbit of eqs.(16 ) and ( 17 ) always crosses _ into _ the closed region , anticlockwise @xcite .",
    "thus the flow of the orbit of eqs(16 ) and ( 17 ) is always bounded and the closed region in fig.3 constitutes a positively invariant region for eqs.(16 ) and ( 17 ) .",
    "an example set of parameters for this positively invariant region are @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 , the point @xmath92 .",
    "what needs to shown now is the fact that for the permitted parameter regime , the fixed point ` b ' is an unstable point .",
    "we linearize the set of equations ( 16 ) and ( 17 ) around the fixed point ` b ' @xmath93 and the eigenvalues of the linear part of these equations at @xmath72 are@xmath94 where@xmath95 and the stability of the equilibrium point ` b ' depends on the values of @xmath96 and @xmath97 . as @xmath98 and @xmath67",
    ", we can find that the point ` b ' is an unstable spiral , if@xmath99 the existence of the limit cycle is now evident according to the poincar - bendixson condition @xcite .",
    "the point ` b ' also becomes unstable for @xmath100 provided @xmath101 , however the latter is excluded by our physical conditions . as the growth rate of the instability should be large enough to cause a sawtooth crash , @xmath98 .",
    "this also ensures that the fixed point ` b ' is an unstable spiral . also , we observe that as @xmath102 , @xmath103 .",
    "in fact , at @xmath104 ( for a certain @xmath105 ) , a supercritical hopf bifurcation occurs @xcite . the bifurcation surface for eqs.(16 ) and ( 17 ) is shown in fig.4 .",
    "note the steepening of the surface @xmath106 , given by eq.(23 ) , as @xmath107 and the disappearance of the fixed point ` a'@xmath108 at the bifurcation point .",
    "in fig.5 , we show the limit cycle for a set of parameters @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 . at the birth of the limit cycle after the supercritical hopf bifurcation",
    ", the period of the limit cycle is given by the hopf period,@xmath112          though the phenomena of sawtooth oscillations in magnetically confined plasmas suggests existence of a ` driven - dissipation ' type limit cycle oscillation , experimentally observed sawtooth oscillations are , in general , perturbed by local irregularities and fluctuations .",
    "as limit cycles are usually characterised by a flow field which converges to the cycle everywhere , it is important to classify the _ orbital stability _ of the limit cycle in order to emphasize its response to noise .",
    "the classical method for studying orbital stability of limit cycles involves eigenvalues of the poincar map @xcite .",
    "several other variants also exist in literature , for studying local stability @xcite , among which the most common one is the theory of floquet multipliers or the _ monodromy matrix _ method , where one follows the short - time evolution of a small perturbation @xmath113 along the limit cycle",
    ". another widely applicable method is associated with the direction of _ slowest decay _",
    "@xcite . here ,",
    "we employ a method based on applying a small perturbation @xmath114 to the non - stationary reference solution i.e. limit cycle of the flow @xmath115 and following the directions tangential and transverse to the flow along the perturbed trajectory @xmath116 @xcite .",

    "for a two - variable system like ours [ eqs.(16 - 17)],@xmath125 the stability matrix @xmath126 is given by@xmath127",

    "parameter @xmath129 represents the rate of convergence normal to the flow and @xmath130 represents convergence tangential to the flow , which essentially averages to zero over a full cycle .",
    "the tangential and normal perturbations are only partially coupled as @xmath131 , which means that a tangential perturbation remains tangential whereas a normal perturbation couples to the tangential perturbations ( nonzero @xmath132 ) .",
    "so a perturbation is unstable or stable depending on whether @xmath133 is positive or negative .",
    "the global stability measures can be found out from the lyapunov exponent , which can be obtained by phase averaging the @xmath133s over an orbit with period @xmath134 @xcite,@xmath135 corresponding to a particular perturbation .",
    "a negative @xmath136 would imply global stability . in practice",
    "we use a discretised version of eq.(40),@xmath137    in fig.6 , we show the stability properties of the limit cycle oscillation of eqs.(16 - 17 ) for a set of parameters @xmath138 , and @xmath139 , which produces a relaxation type oscillation ( see fig.8 ) . as one can see that the limit cycle consists of unstable and stable parts corresponding to the normal perturbations .",
    "the limit cycle is globally stable as indicated by the global stability parameter , the lyapunov exponent @xmath140 .",
    "the plot of @xmath141 shows the tangential stability which is essentially due to acceleration and deceleration of the flow showing a relaxation mechanism .",
    "as expected , the average @xmath142 within the computational accuracy .",
    "the coupling matrix element @xmath132 represents the effect of perpendicular perturbation on the oscillator phase . during @xmath143",
    ", the perpendicular perturbation leads to advancement of the phase of the oscillator and @xmath144 indicates a phase delay .      in this subsection , we find out an equation for the limit cycle enclosing the critical point ` b ' in terms of a series expansion . here",
    ", we employ a method due to giacomini and viano @xcite , which is based on the fact that if we consider the partial differential equation@xmath145 corresponding to the two - dimensional dynamical system@xmath146 there exists a unique convergent power series solution of eq.(42 ) in some region @xmath147 containing a non - degenerate critical point @xmath148 of node or focus ( spiral ) type and that this solution satisfies@xmath149 on any limit cycle contained in @xmath147 which encloses @xmath148 . in our case , the equations ( 16 ) and ( 17 ) have an isolated limit cycle enclosing the critical point located at @xmath72 .",
    "we have already seen that subject to the conditions ( 27 ) , the equilibrium point ` b ' is an unstable spiral .",
    "therefore , there exists a unique series solution of eq.(42 ) .",
    "as the cases , where an explicit series solution can be calculated analytically , are limited to polynomial forms for the functions @xmath150 and @xmath151 , we write the eqs.(16,17 ) with a transformation of variable @xmath152 , so that our system of dynamical equations become@xmath153 without loss of any generality , the constant @xmath22 can be set to unity , for which , the right hand sides of eq.(45,46 ) become polynomials in @xmath74 and @xmath60 . following giacomini and viano @xcite",

    "the parameter regime is dictated by the value of variable @xmath33 in eq.(16 ) , which is determined from the experimental parameter to be @xmath223 and @xmath224 in si units , for the shots ( _ a _ ) and ( _ b _ ) .",
    "the values of the index @xmath22 are chosen so as to get the desired relaxation oscillation with a given growth rate @xmath68 . in the cases shown in fig.11 ,",
    "the values of @xmath22 are taken to be 0.42 and 1.1 , respectively with the dimensionless growth rate @xmath225 , in both cases .",
    "in this section , we construct the invariant manifold of eqs.(16 ) and ( 17 ) , using the renormalization - group ( rg ) method @xcite and show that it is indeed the slow manifold which governs the linear rise of the electron temperature in the sawtooth on the limit cycle .",
    "it has been shown elsewhere that the rg method can be applied to continue the unperturbative solutions of evolution equations valid locally around an arbitrary initial value @xmath45 , smoothly to an arbitrary time @xmath70 constructing the envelope of the perturbative solutions @xcite .    with the rescaling of the variables , we write eqs.(16,17 ) as in eqs.(45,46)@xmath226 where we have rescaled the variables @xmath227 and @xmath228 . without loss of any generality",
    "we have assumed that @xmath109 .",
    "we further make a scale transformation@xmath229 where @xmath178 is a small and arbitrary parameter .",
    "the evolution equations now read@xmath230    we now try to construct a perturbative solution @xmath231 of the above equations around some initial time @xmath45,@xmath232 the differential equations at successive orders to be solved are given as@xmath233 corresponding to the zeroth , first , and second orders . in the above equations,@xmath234 with eigenvalues",
    "@xmath235 corresponding to the eigenvectors @xmath236 and @xmath237 .",
    "the zeroth order solution is given by@xmath238 the first and second order solutions are respectively@xmath239u_{2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] finally , the rg equation @xmath240 yields@xmath241 note that we have retained terms only up to the first order in the first of the above equations .",
    "on the limit cycle , we solve the above equations , eqs.(79,80 ) for @xmath242 and with @xmath243 .",
    "thus , from eq.(70 ) , the invariant manifold can be constructed as,@xmath244 with @xmath245 as constants of integration .",
    "so , this invariant manifold in terms of variable @xmath74 and @xmath60 in eqs.(16 ) and ( 17 ) is given by,@xmath246 which essentially is the slow manifold given by eqs.(54 ) and ( 55 ) in sec.iv .",
    "to conclude , we have proposed a minimal dynamical model for the sawtooth oscillations in current carrying plasmas e.g. tokamak plasmas .",
    "this model , based on the assumption that the sawtooth is triggered due to a thermal instability which ejects the plasma , shows relaxation oscillations on an isolated limit cycle .",
    "we have further shown that the invariant manifold of this model is indeed the slow manifold of the relaxation oscillation .",
    "the persistent behaviour of the sawtooth oscillation across different tokamaks indicate that a dynamical model based on limit cycle oscillation is consistent in contrast to the hamiltonian models .",
    "we note that , the hopf bifurcation , which is the key to the limit cycle behavior , around an unstable equilibrium point is based on a linear theory , which does not always predict the behaviour of the corresponding nonlinear model .",
    "however , in this case , numerical simulations seem to be in agreement with the predicted bifurcation analysis .",
    "the authors would like to thank the anonymous referees for suggesting several improvements including addition of subsection covering the stability analysis of the limit cycle .",
    "in this appendix , we review the equivalent hamiltonian approximation of eqs.(16 ) and ( 17 ) @xcite .",
    "as can be shown that , a hamiltonian for eqs.(16 ) and ( 17 ) exist only for @xmath247 and @xmath248 , and the equations become @xmath249 in this case , the hamiltonian of the system can be expressed as@xmath250 with the equivalent hamilton s equations as@xmath251 the equivalent conjugate variables i.e ` position ' and ` momentum ' are , respectively , given by,@xmath252 the hamiltonian formalism ensures periodic orbits described by the family of curves described by the differential equation,@xmath253 which are closed .",
    "however , depending on the initial conditions of evolution , there can be several possible orbits rather than an unique one .",
    "note that the eqs.(83,84 ) are similar in nature to the famous volterra s predator - prey system @xcite .",
