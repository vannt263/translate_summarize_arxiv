    "it has been known for a long time that the line connecting the leading and following portions of a bipolar sunspot group usually tilts with respect to the solar equator @xcite .",
    "the tilt angle has been regarded as an important parameter of the magnetic field since the publication of the solar dynamo models by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the longest available tilt angle data bases are derived from white - light photographic observations taken at mount wilson observatory ( @xmath2 ) in 1917 - 1985 and kodaikanal solar observatory ( @xmath3 ) in 1906 - 1987 @xcite .",
    "the magnetograms available since 1974 also allow the study of tilt angle of active regions @xcite .",
    "numerous characteristics of tilt angles and their changes have been investigated based on these data bases ( e. g. @xcite ) .",
    "several papers have also confirmed that the average tilt angle increases with increasing latitude known as joy s law reported by @xcite at first .",
    "recently new methods and data ( e.g. tilt angles derived from space - based magnetograms ) have been included into the studies .",
    "for example , @xcite initiated the study of cycle - to - cycle dependence of the average tilt angles . @xcite developed a new method to derive tilt angles from mw and soho / mdi magnetograms .",
    "they started to investigate the median tilt angle instead of the mean tilt angle , and they found a persistent asymmetry between the median tilt angles measured in the northern and southern hemispheres in all latitudinal ranges . @xcite also paid attention to the differences between hemispheres and cycles and they suggested a revision of joy s law equations .",
    "it is widely accepted that the tilt angle is primarily due to the coriolis force acting on initially untilted rising magnetic flux tubes ( e.g. @xcite ) but some authors ( @xcite ) have questioned this explanation arguing that the tilt is already established in the source region inside the sun .",
    "@xcite revealed a new dynamo pattern by separating the tilt angles of large and small solar bipoles .",
    "@xcite studied the tilt angle scatter in the framework of babcock - leighton dynamo models by using the @xmath4 data bases .",
    "they concluded that the tilt angle scatter has a significant impact on the variability of the solar cycle strength .",
    "these examples show that a number of new ideas and questions have arisen concerning the tilt angles recently . to reveal more details and answer the open questions ,",
    "the studies need extended homogeneous long - term measurements of tilt angles or cross - calibration of various data sets derived with different methods .",
    "the longest sunspot group tilt angle data set available after the termination of @xmath4 data bases has been derived recently from @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath0 tilt angles can be also compared with the tilt angles derived from the soho / mdi - debrecen data ( @xmath1 ) catalogue with or without considering the magnetic polarity information . in this study , we analyse and compare sunspot group data available in various data bases ( @xmath4 , @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) , and some new data derived for the purpose of comparison presented in this paper .",
    "the aim of this study is to reveal the special characteristics of these data bases and to look for various filters that can be used to decrease the differences between them .",
    "the @xmath0 data ( gyri , baranyi & ludmny 2011 ) are measured on daily white - light full - disk photographic plates , which are mainly taken at debrecen heliophysical observatory and its gyula observing station but , in some cases , the data derived from observations of cooperating ground - based observatories or from space - borne images .",
    "@xmath0 covers the years starting with 1974 with one observation / day time resolution and it contains the position and ( whole and umbral ) area data for all sunspot groups and each spot in them .",
    "these data allow deriving tilt angle data from them . by using the umbral data of @xmath0 , the umbral tilt angle ( @xmath5 ) of the sunspot groups can be determined in a similar way as it was done at @xmath4 after measuring only umbral areas .",
    "in addition , a new type of tilt angle ( @xmath6 ) can be derived from @xmath0 by using the whole spot area ( ws ) of the spots and pores ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the calculation of the tilt angle data follows the traditional way in both cases @xcite :    @xmath7    where @xmath8 / @xmath9 are the area - weighted latitude of the following / leading portion , @xmath10 , @xmath11 are the area - weighted longitude of the following / leading portion , and @xmath12 is the latitude of the centroid of the whole group .",
    "the separation of the leading and following portions can be derived as @xmath13    the @xmath0 does not contain magnetic polarity information on spots but the available magnetograms are frequently taken into account while grouping spots .",
    "thus , the @xmath0 tilt angles based on estimated or measured polarities may be closer to the magnetic tilt data than they would be in the case of automatic grouping based simply on proximity .    the mount wilson solar observatory has taken full - disk broad - band observations called white light directs once per day since 1906 .",
    "the images for 1917 - 1985 were measured to determine the sunspot group tilt angles with the method described by @xcite .",
    "the umbral area and mean position of each spot present within @xmath14 longitude from the central meridian ( lcm ) were measured by measuring the position of two successive vertices of the superposed quadrilateral . in the next step , a program based on their proximity grouped the spots .",
    "a spot was included in a group if its position was within a distance of @xmath15 in latitude or @xmath16 in longitude from another spot in the group .",
    "the area - weighted position of the leading ( following ) portion was derived from the data of umbrae in the portion located to the west ( east ) of the area - weighted centroid of the sunspot group @xcite .",
    "the same measuring method was applied to the white light images of kodaikanal solar observatory @xcite to determine the @xmath3 tilt angles of sunspot groups and their daily changes for the year 1906 - 1987 .",
    "these traditional sources of tilt angle data ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) are available at noaa / ngdc .",
    "the @xmath2 directs was digitized and published in the frame of mt .",
    "wilson solar photographic archive digitization project @xcite .",
    "at present , the @xmath2 photo archive contains scans of white - light observations for the intervals 1917 - 18 and 1961 - 67 overlapping with the @xmath2 tilt angle data base .",
    "these images can be evaluated with the software developed for @xmath0 .",
    "we selected the directs available for 1961 - 67 , and the position and area data of spots were measured with the software of @xmath0 .",
    "the new tilt angle data set ( @xmath19 ) was created by using the umbral data like in the case of @xmath5 .    the mount wilson sunspot polarity drawings ( see e.g. @xcite ) are often available close in time to",
    "the @xmath2 directs .",
    "thus , by comparing the @xmath2 drawings and images , we can usually determine or estimate the polarity of the spots involved in the leading and following portions of the groups in @xmath17 and @xmath19 .    the greenwich photoheliographic results ( @xmath20 ) catalogue ( 1874 - 1976 ) contains position and area data of sunspot groups measured in photographic observations taken at royal observatory of greenwich and at a few other observatories",
    ". it can provide additional information for us on the correct separation of groups and on the nearby sunspot groups within the overlapping interval with the @xmath2 data set .",
    "we used the digital version of @xmath20 available at ngdc .",
    "concerning further details on @xmath20 data and their digital versions see e.g. the paper by @xcite .",
    "for the time interval 1996 - 2010 , some comparisons can be made by using the @xmath1tilt angle data base @xcite derived from soho / mdi quasi - continuum images .",
    "four types of tilt angle can be calculated based on this data set but we used only two of them .",
    "the @xmath21 is the `` traditional '' tilt angle like @xmath5 while in the case of @xmath22 the separation of leading and following portion is based on the polarity information of umbrae derived from mdi magnetograms . in the case of @xmath1 and @xmath0 , the additional selection criterion of @xmath23 was applied because the measurements were confined to this region at @xmath4 .",
    "to reveal the major characteristics of @xmath2 data , we compared two tilt angle data sets ( @xmath19 and @xmath17 ) based on the @xmath2 directs .",
    "we used the @xmath20 to match the data of these two data set . in @xmath19",
    ", we identified the sunspot groups according to @xmath20 .",
    "we also tried to match the sunspot groups in @xmath17 to the groups in @xmath20 by using their heliographic latitude and lcm data corrected to the time difference of observations .",
    "the comparison of the available data after jan . 1",
    ", 1965 revealed that the time of observation of @xmath17 is in ut but the correct date is the next day . before 1965 ,",
    "the date of @xmath17 is correct but the published time has to be subtracted from @xmath24 to derive the correct time of observation in ut . after the needed corrections ,",
    "the data of sunspot groups in @xmath17 and @xmath19 can be matched quite well .",
    "( this is also valid for the @xmath3 data set because of the same measuring method and software . )",
    "identifying the matching cases , we generated the combined data set @xmath25 containing 506 sunspot groups with tilt angles for 1961 - 67 .",
    "this pilot data set together with the directs and polarity drawings allows us to determine such characteristics of the measured sunspot groups which are not published in @xmath17 .",
    "the pilot data are used to extrapolate the result for the whole interval of @xmath17 ( and @xmath18 ) and for the following era .",
    "the correctness of the extrapolation is checked by using @xmath21 in some cases .",
    "the position data of leading and following portions published in @xmath17 allowed us to estimate which spots were measured as members of the given portions in the directs . when we compared these portions in the image with their matching parts in the @xmath2 polarity drawings , the estimation of the magnetic polarities of spots also became available . in this way",
    ", we can determine whether a given portion of a group indicated as leading ( following ) portion published in @xmath17 corresponds to the magnetic portion of a bipolar group correctly .",
    "table 1 shows that in the most cases , the identification of the portions of bipolar groups was correct in @xmath17",
    ".    however , in about 26% of the cases , the measured tilt angles refer to unipolar groups that contain only spots of one polarity , these data necessarily distort the statistics .",
    "the estimated number of these cases based on the @xmath2 observations is about the same as the percentage based on the @xmath1 tilt data derived by comparing the number of the traditional tilt angles and that of the tilts with polarity information .",
    "the percentage of tilt angle of unipolar groups is probably similar in any tilt angle data base in any time interval .",
    "the other source of distorted statistics is the false grouping of spots . in the pilot data set ,",
    "about 14% of the @xmath17 data refers to such groups which are unipolar because of the measuring method . in these cases ,",
    "both the leading and following parts of a group are measured but they are separated and assigned as two independent unipolar groups .",
    "these divisions are caused by the automatic separating algorithm in those cases when the opposite polarity portions have larger distance than the threshold for grouping .",
    "a further possible source of false tilt data may be the accidental close proximity of nearby groups . by examining the studied sample we can estimate that @xmath26 4% of @xmath17 belongs to this type of cases",
    ". the percentage of such cases may be probably smaller in @xmath0 because of the use of magnetograms but a few percent of incorrect grouping can also be estimated both in the case of @xmath5 and @xmath21 mainly in their preliminary versions .",

    "we have compared the traditional tilt angle data bases of mount wilson ( @xmath2 ) , kodaikanal ( @xmath3 ) observatories with the recently published data bases ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) of debrecen observatory in different time intervals by statistical methods and case studies .",
    "new tilt angles have been derived from @xmath2 white - light observations for 196167 by using the software of @xmath0 .",
    "we have compared the positions of the leading and following portions of the @xmath2 tilt angle data base with the positions in the photographic images and with the polarity information on that part of the group in the @xmath2 polarity drawings . based on these data",
    ", we have revealed several differences between the data bases coming from the different measuring methods .",
    "we have tested a few new methods to filter out the majority of incorrect tilt angles and to decrease the deviations because of random errors .",
    "we have calculated the calibration factors between umbral area of @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath20 and @xmath0 .",
    "our results show that there is no systematic deviation between the traditional and new tilt angle data sets .",
    "the filters and calibrations enhance the reliability and homogeneity of the tilt angle data bases .",
    "because of these revisions , improved curves of the joy s law have been obtained by applying various filters on the tilt angle data .",
    "our results show that the applied filters increase the slope of the joy s law ; in addition , the slopes derived from different data sets get closer to each other .",
    "the decrease of the unambiguous tilt data may allow recognizing new types of characteristics of tilt angles .",
    "the most unexpected result based on the new debrecen data is that the curves representing the joy s law exhibit an indication for a conspicuous feature : a plateau in the domain around the mean latitude of the active region belt at @xmath29 .",
    "this may imply a still unknown contributor to the fine structure of the joy s law based on sunspot group tilt angles .",
    "further research is required to provide much clearer evidence or a refutation of the possible significance of this feature but the advantages of the new data may be seen well .",
