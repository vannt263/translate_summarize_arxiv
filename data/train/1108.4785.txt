    "more than a decade ago , small world graphs were proposed @xcite to model networks found in nature and this subsequently led to an explosion of interest in the topic .",
    "the shortest path between two nodes in a small world graph is typically no more than @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the size of the graph .",
    "however , although graphs with these short paths can be constructed , the way in which the path or route to a specified destination node is discovered is another matter .",
    "typical approaches are based on recursively flooding enquires to all neighbours on the graph and this kind of global propagation is the basis of the shortest path algorithms such as dijkstra or bellman - ford .",
    "these approaches suffer from a consequent lack of scalability and indeed routing on the internet uses a hierarchical approach to counteract the problem .",
    "modern peer - to - peer protocols pursue a different approach to avoid the scaling difficulty by having a particular network structure that allows a small number of select queries to efficiently find the required destination .",
    "this paper considers the problem of how to find the shortest path to a given labelled node on a random graph without relying on global propagation .",
    "our approach to the problem relies on two essential ingredients : a simple rule acting on local information at each node and an appropriately chosen random graph structure .",
    "the complication of the peer - to - peer systems which motivate the study are discarded to choose these ingredients in the simplest way that exposes the problem .",
    "firstly we assume that the routing rule greedily attempts to get as close as possible to the destination at each step .",
    "for this to work , the graphs we consider must have a small world like structure , that is , they have short characteristic path length but tend to cluster nodes with similar labels together .",
    "moreover , in order to simplify the analysis by allowing local information to uniquely specify which link to take at intermediate steps , we require that the graphs satisfy a strong version of the triangle inequality determining , not merely bounding , the third side of a triangle in terms of the other two .",
    "these requirements are not satisfied by the random relinking construction of watts and strogatz @xcite , and instead our random graphs are based on a modification the traditional construction of erds and rnyi @xcite that selects links to delete from the fully connected graph according to a probability depending on their metric weight . to encourage clustering of nearby nodes we only consider probability distributions that favour short links .",
    "having mentioned peer - to - peer systems as a motivation , it may be helpful to briefly review aspects of modern distributed hash tables to clarify the relationship to our work .",
    "these systems store data in a distributed setting by associating the data with an integer key ( the hash ) , and place the data on a computer node with integer nodeid close in value to the key .",
    "the essential function that these systems provide is to allow any node to efficiently retrieve the data and this becomes the ability to locate a particular node according to its nodeid .",
    "these nodes abide on a computer network that allows packets to be sent to any node given its computer address .",
    "however the address and the nodeid are distinct entities and nodes only store a table of addresses corresponding to a small fraction of the total number of nodes .",
    "a node , and the data stored on it , is located by a series of queries to other nodes that return the addresses from their own tables that are closest to the desired node .",
    "the queries are first sent to the nodes in the local table that are closest to the nodeid being sought , and then recursively to the addresses returned from the queries .",
    "this process can involve multiple queries at each stage and in the event that a query fails to result in a closer node address , other queries are attempted . through these mechanisms nodes are located successfully and efficiently with overwhelming probability .",
    "two well studied peer - to - peer systems are chord @xcite and kademlia @xcite and the metrics they use to determine the closeness of nodeid s , distance around a circle and xor respectively , are exactly those used as the metrics on the random graphs in this paper .",
    "nodes on peer - to - peer systems use the metric to organise their table of nodeid addresses to contain more addresses of nearby nodeid s than distant nodeid s .",
    "the random graphs in our work can be thought of as being determined by the connectivity implied by these tables , and will have clustering as a consequence .",
    "the degree of a node in the random graph should therefore be determined by the size of the table in the peer - to - peer system .",
    "although this table size appears to be configurable , it must in fact grow according to the log of the maximum number of nodeid s and the degree of a node in the random graph also grows as @xmath2 . however , peer - to - peer systems are dynamic , with nodes continually entering and leaving the system so the nodeid s are sparse and the local tables themselves are frequently updated .",
    "this dynamic aspect is not part of our work where we take the nodes to be labelled contiguously and consider static graphs with randomly generated connectivity .",
    "the series of queries that occur in a node lookup in a peer - to - peer system is replaced in our work by the stepwise deterministic construction of a path along neighbouring links of the random graph towards the desired node .",
    "crucially , in our work we use a greedy algorithm and at each step discard all routes that are not the best , so the path can arrive at a dead end where no neighbour is closer to the final destination . in this case",
    "the search has failed .    in summary ,",
    "the context within which we study this problem is that of a simple greedy algorithm and a rather complex random graph structure .",
    "while peer - to - peer systems motivate this context , the algorithm used is different and their overlay networks are certainly not random graphs .",
    "moreover , in our analysis we are concerned with behaviour in the large graph limit .",
    "we consider the probability of successful search and in particular its asymptotic value as the sought node becomes further and further away .",
    "we also measure statistics for the number of steps in a successful path .",
    "the most interesting observation is that there appears to be a transition in the probability of success as the average connectivity is varied .",
    "this is quite distinct from the percolation transition as all the random graphs we consider will consist of a single connected component .",
    "subsequent sections will discuss the construction of the random graphs in detail and study some of their properties .",
    "the greedy routing algorithm is then introduced and basic equations used to analyse the algorithm are derived .",
    "the analysis itself constitutes the main section and considerable attention is paid to one model that can be solved exactly .",
    "however , although this solution provides clues that are used for approximate analysis , we rely heavily on numerical solution of the equations and also check our results against simulation of the whole system .",
    "we shall consider graphs constructed in a manner similar to traditional erds and rnyi random graphs@xcite ( as opposed to the configuration approach of molloy and reed@xcite ) , by diluting the links of a fully connected metric graph .",
    "first imagine a fully connected graph on @xmath1 nodes labelled @xmath3 in which the link between nodes labelled @xmath4 and @xmath5 has length @xmath6 according to the graphs s metric .",
    "links will be selected to appear in the random graph according to a length dependent probability distribution . in order that the graph be uniform , in the sense that all nodes are statistically equivalent",
    ", the set of link lengths emerging from any node in the fully connected graph must be the same , and for the graphs we consider will take the discrete values @xmath7 .",
    "we shall imagine that each node knows the labels of the neighbouring nodes to which it is directly connected , and nothing else .",
    "specifically it has no knowledge of who its neighbours are connected to .",
    "this avoids undue complexity such as routing updates and complex forwarding tables at each node and radically simplifies the dynamic nature of peer - to - peer networks .",
    "in order that this local information is sufficient to allow the greedy algorithm to determine which link to use to get closest to the eventual goal , we consider metrics having the property that the length of the third side of a triangle is completely determined by the lengths of the other two sides .",
    "two metrics with the necessary properties are the circle and xor metrics .    * circle metric . * the length of a link from node labelled @xmath4 to @xmath5 is : @xmath8 this is simply interpreted as the one way distance around a circle as shown in figure [ fcircle ] .",
    "the metric is not symmetric and the resulting graph is directed .",
    "a triangle with sides length @xmath9 and @xmath10 with @xmath11 has the third side directed from the endpoint of @xmath10 and is of length @xmath12 . where the metric function is now applied to lengths not node indices . in the peer - to - peer context , this metric is used in the chord approach @xcite .",
    "* xor metric . *",
    "the length of a link between node labelled @xmath4 and @xmath5 is : @xmath13 where @xmath14 represents the bitwise xor of the integer arguments . in this case",
    "@xmath1 must be taken to be a power of 2 to preserve the uniformity of the graph .",
    "it is possible to interpret this as the manhattan distance when the nodes are placed on a lattice as is shown for a simple case of 8 nodes in figure [ fxor ] .",
    "a consequence of this metric is that a triangle with sides length @xmath9 and @xmath10 has the third side length @xmath15 . in the peer - to - peer context , this metric is used in the kademlia approach @xcite .",
    "the common structure of the graphs we consider arises from insisting that the probability distribution function @xmath16 that selects for the existence of links of given distance is a strictly decreasing function of distance . at least for the case of the circle metric",
    ", this intuitively gives rise to many short links along the perimeter of the circle and fewer longer links as chords across the circle along the lines of the small world proposal of watts and strogatz@xcite .",
    "we expect significant clustering as a consequence .",
    "the picture is less clear for the xor metric , but again we anticipate some kind of small - world like structure to arise . such structure is desirable for a greedy routing algorithm as discussed in the introduction .",
    "preliminary investigations indicated that exponential decay of the probability distribution , even when appropriately scaled , does not allow enough long links for efficient routing and we have concentrated effort on power law distributions : @xmath17 the bulk of analysis will be for the case @xmath18 but to motivate this choice we retain it as a parameter for the present .",
    "were @xmath19 to be zero , the graph would be an erds and rnyi random graph with average degree @xmath20 , and in general , @xmath21 has a related meaning that scales the average degree . to bound the probability of length 1 links we take @xmath22 , though it would be possible to consider @xmath23 provided short links are automatically present and the probabilistic link selection only applies to longer links .",
    "for example , with the circle metric , @xmath24 causes all nearest neighbours to be connected and routability is guaranteed .",
    "this is not the case for the xor metric which requires some longer links in order to create a giant component .",
    "in contrast to the case of erds and rnyi random graphs , @xmath21 does not scale with @xmath1 ( as @xmath25 in that case ) , and consequently the average degree depends on @xmath1 .      before proceeding to consider routing",
    "let us briefly characterise the @xmath19 and @xmath21 parameter regimes according to some standard graph properties .",
    "we employ the techniques described in @xcite and use the following generating function for the probability of vertex degrees . @xmath26 as follows from the uniform property of the graphs without the need to specify which metric is used , though in the case of the directed circle metric , this only counts either the _ in _ or _ out _ degrees .",
    "the moments of the degree distribution are computed by taking derivatives of the generating function .",
    "for example the first few central moments are : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the generalised harmonic number that in the limit @xmath29 becomes a riemann zeta function @xmath30 .",
    "notice that for @xmath31 the average degree grows as @xmath32 .",
    "the shape of the degree distribution resembles that of a poisson law , but is narrower . even for large graphs with @xmath33 where some of the terms in the expressions above may be dropped",
    ", the moments do not match those of a poisson distribution .",
    "the cluster coefficient @xcite is defined as the ratio of the number of triangles to connected triples , @xmath34 .",
    "the number of connected triples can be obtained from the vertex degree generating function as : @xmath35 using the the uniqueness of lengths and the property of the metric that determines the length of the third side of a triangle in terms of the other two , it is straightforward to compute the probability of selecting links that form a triangle and consequently the number of triangles . @xmath36 the cluster coefficient is always proportional to @xmath21 , but the sum above is unwieldy for general @xmath19 and its value depends on whether the graph is based on the circle or xor metric . for @xmath37",
    "the coefficient has a finite limit for large @xmath1 graphs but this is not generally the case for @xmath38 . at @xmath39",
    "the sum becomes more tractable and for the xor metric we find : @xmath40 the unusual sum appearing in this formula is discussed in the appendix and it approaches a finite limit of approximately @xmath41 in the large @xmath1 limit .",
    "clustering vanishes slowly as @xmath42 for large @xmath1 and simulations confirm the form derived above .    in the case of the circle",
    "metric more care is needed to take account of the directed nature of the links .",
    "this gives rise to some changes in factors but ends in the similar looking formula : @xmath43 here the limiting value of the sum can be expressed as @xmath44 , approximately 2 * 1.202057 .",
    "as a large connected component is a precondition for successfully finding nodes , we want to ensure that the network is above any possible percolation threshold . for @xmath33 the average degree grows with @xmath1 and in contrast to erds and rnyi random graphs , we expect percolation to occur for any value of @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "this is indeed observed in simulation but there is no simple proof since the generating function techniques of @xcite can not be relied upon for this purpose as the existence of links is distance dependent .",
    "we have just seen that for @xmath37 there is finite clustering in the thermodynamic limit and in this range there may be a complex percolation threshold in the @xmath19 , @xmath21 plane . in the case of the circle metric at @xmath33 a rough test",
    "is to compute the probability that a gap with no links crossing it exists in the circle .",
    "this probability goes to zero for any value of @xmath21 , but still there may be finite size effects at small @xmath21 .    in summary :",
    "@xmath37 , : :    @xmath45 does not grow with @xmath1 and    there is finite triangle clustering",
    ". there may not be a giant    component .",
    "@xmath31 , : :    @xmath45 is large and grows with    @xmath1 , but the triangle clustering coefficient decreases to    zero .    as examples",
    ", we have simulated inverse square and inverse square root laws and find the typical behaviour described above .",
    "each regime has disadvantages . to be certain of a giant component",
    "we should avoid @xmath37 , but in the @xmath31 regime @xmath46 grows . to understand why this second issue is a problem we must start to consider routing issues .",
    "the average size of the table needed to keep track of neighbouring nodes is the mean number of links leaving a node , that is , @xmath46 .",
    "for efficiency , the amount of information stored on a node should not grow too quickly with @xmath1 .",
    "the parameter regime with @xmath31 is therefore less appealing .",
    "the most interesting regime occurs at @xmath39 and for the rest of this paper we work at this point .",
    "this leads to slow logarithmic growth of the routing table , but potentially successful search .",
    "moreover , this is precisely the situation motivated by kademlia which also has a table size that grows logarithmically . although we expect a giant component at @xmath39 and see one in simulations , we should beware of potential finite size effects when the parameter @xmath21 is small .",
    "clustering does go to zero for large graphs , but it does so as @xmath42 which is much slower than the @xmath25 expected for erds and rnyi random graphs .",
    "in fact , it is the clustering of nodes with nearby labels that is important in this work rather than the global triangle cluster coefficient , so it may still be legitimate to term these graphs small world .",
    "for the graphs we consider , the only information the greedy routing algorithm requires at a node is the list of nearest neighbours .",
    "this list contains the node indices of the neighbours , and from this information , the special distance metrics we have chosen allow computation of the distance to that node and moreover the remaining distance from the neighbouring node to the final destination . at each step",
    "the greedy algorithm chooses to hop to the neighbouring node that is the closest to the eventual destination .",
    "if there is no neighbour closer than the present node , then routing has failed according to this mechanism . no backtracking is allowed .",
    "note that the length of the hop to the neighbour is not directly relevant to this algorithm except though triangle bounds .    to analyse this algorithm consider the probability of successfully reaching the destination at distance @xmath47 in @xmath48 hops , @xmath49 .",
    "of course the number of hops is limited by the distance @xmath50 as each hop must get closer to the goal . for the case of a single hop",
    ", @xmath51 is merely the probability that a direct link exists . @xmath52",
    "the probability of success in more than one hop can be computed iteratively .",
    "consider figure [ frecurse ] for routing from node @xmath4 to node @xmath5 via node @xmath53 .",
    "@xmath54 where node labels and distances are as in the figure .",
    "the first terms are self evident and the product accounts for the greediness of the algorithm by ensuring that there is no neighbour @xmath55 of @xmath4 closer to @xmath5 than @xmath53 .",
    "note that by virtue of the greediness of the algorithm , @xmath49 is independent of @xmath1 except that it vanishes for @xmath56 .    using the triangle property of the metrics and specialising to the @xmath39 probability distribution ,",
    "this can be written explicitly in terms of the metric function for distances as : @xmath57    to illuminate the routing algorithm and the recursion relation it is helpful to consider @xmath58 .",
    "we shall do this for the xor metric and the reader should have in mind an image of the graph similar to that in figure [ fxor ] .",
    "the resulting probabilities are shown in table [ tqofdkxor ] .",
    "as an example of a two hop path consider @xmath59 .",
    "starting from node 0 there are two paths to the destination node 3 : 013 and 023 and in both cases there is a factor @xmath60 to ensure that there is no direct path .",
    "the preferred path would be 023 as the intermediate point is closer to the destination : the contribution from this path is @xmath61 . for the path 013",
    ", there is an additional factor to exclude the possibility that the preferred path 023 exists and the contribution is @xmath62 . for the three hop case @xmath63 , notice that only one path is possible : 0123 not 0213 , as the step from 2 to 1 would move further from the goal .",
    "the @xmath21 dependence in the table agrees with numerical simulations .",
    "for the circle metric , the table is similar but the factors are not identical .",
    ".values of @xmath49 for xor metric for small values of d [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is convenient to define a generating function for the probabilities @xmath49 . @xmath64 we shall use the recurrence relation that this obeys in analytic work , but numerically it is more appropriate to directly consider quantities measurable in simulation .    by summing over all possible numbers of hops",
    "we obtain the overall probability @xmath65 of routing over a distance @xmath47 . @xmath66",
    "this quantity also obeys a recursion relation following from the relation for @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath67 and @xmath68    in general @xmath65 is a polynomial in @xmath21 of degree @xmath69 .",
    "for very small @xmath47 , the explicit form can be deduced by summing entries from table [ tqofdkxor ] .",
    "the recursion relations are complex , with each new value depending on all previous ones .",
    "we therefore rely heavily on numerical results , though we can throw some analytic light on the system with the circle metric especially at @xmath24 . to numerically solve the recursion relations for @xmath65 , values of @xmath47 up to @xmath70 are accessible in reasonable time on a desktop computer ; while for @xmath49 we can only approach @xmath71 with similar effort .",
    "we have also checked these results and have investigated other properties by directly simulating samples of the graphs and running the greedy routing algorithm on them .",
    "the simulations allow us to investigate properties such as the size of the giant component , the triangle cluster coefficient besides the probability of success and number of hops required for greedy routing . in reasonable time , graphs of sizes up to @xmath72 can be studied with several hundred samples .      for the circle",

    "the numerical data in figure [ frasyfit ] is only able to indicate that the asymptotic constant @xmath76 becomes very small for @xmath21 below the putative transition .",
    "we would like to investigate the asymptotic properties of the equations more closely in order to gain more evidence for a transition . as a model for this",
    "we start by considering the special value @xmath24 where the equations simplify to the extent that progress can be made .",

    "notice that the routing success is below one even for @xmath24 and that the exponent certainly does not behave as @xmath21 so the situation is rather different from that for the circle metric .",
    "the exponent takes a similar value for both the bounds , and we might anticipate that there is a common exponent to describe all values of @xmath47 .",
    "the asymptotic constant @xmath129 takes distinct values for each bound but both curves appear to converge to indicate a transition in the same vicinity .",
    "although the xor metric leads to substantially more fluctuation in the mean number of hops @xmath46 than the circle metric , the overall trend remains logarithmic .",
    "in the two figures [ avkcoeffabxfig ] the coefficients @xmath4 and @xmath5 of a fit to the form @xmath119 are shown .",
    "these curves are less abrupt than for the circle metric but follow the same trend .",
    "notice in particular that the average number of hops required by the xor metric is less than that needed by the circle metric when searching for nodes an equal distance away and moreover that it retains a much more stable value in the region above the transition .",
    "= 1.0    = 1.0",
    "we have considered the problem of efficiently finding a labelled node on a random graph using a simple greedy algorithm that makes decisions of which link to take solely on the basis of the list of labels of neighbouring nodes to which it is directly connected . to enable this ,",
    "the random graph was constrained to have small world like structure , and we proposed and constructed a class of graphs with properties intended to facilitate the search .    in the limit of very large size graphs we have demonstrated that for an appropriate range of parameters , the search for a node arbitrarily far away has a finite probability of success .",
    "moreover , we have strong numerical hints that the system displays a transition between the regime with finite probability of locating a desired node at large @xmath21 to a regime where this is not guaranteed at smaller @xmath21 .",
    "unfortunately , the @xmath2 dependence of many quantities makes it hard for numerical work to accurately predict behaviour in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the existence of the transition for the circle metric has some support from analytic analysis , with both the perturbative and asymptotic analysis matching numerical results at larger @xmath21 , and with the perturbative approach indeed predicting a transition at finite @xmath21 . for the xor metric where analytic work is much harder , the graphs obtained from numerical solution of the equations have similar shape to those for the circle metric , and we expect the same conclusion .    in our work",
    "it seems that the random graphs based on xor metric are less likely to lead to successful routing than those based on the circle .",
    "the reason for this observation is that while the sum of the hop distances is equal to the total distance to the end node on the circle , for the xor metric it is greater , and consequently the probability of such links existing is smaller . on the other hand ,",
    "the number of hops needed to reach the destination is typically fewer for xor than circle metric .",
    "however , kademlia has generally been favoured over chord in existing present day peer - to - peer systems .",
    "this merely emphasises the difference in approach to our work as peer - to - peer systems are dynamic and the list of stored links changes in order to optimise routing which is eventually always successful .",
    "the xor metric is symmetric so the results of any query can be used to update the local table , thus minimising the number of queries needed .",
    "0,5 truecm    * acknowledgment : * i would like to thank m.z .",
    "ahmed and b.  ghita for conversations .",
    "here we examine some unusual sums that involve the xor operator .",
    "the precise value of these sums fluctuates within an envelope , so it is the bounds that are studied .",
    "first it is helpful to investigate .",
    "@xmath130    for @xmath131 and for the range of @xmath9 appearing in the sum ,",
    "it becomes apparent that @xmath132 by considering the binary form of @xmath133 . in this case , @xmath134 and this constitutes the lower bound .",
    "now consider the more elaborate sum that appears in the expression for the triangle clustering coefficient .",
    "@xmath139 note that this obeys the recurrence relation : @xmath140 this allows us to determine the form of the finite size corrections to the asymptotic constant .",
    "@xmath141 the bounds on @xmath142 in ( [ s1bounds ] ) translate into bounds on the parameter @xmath5 , but the main purpose of this exercise is to justify the form of corrections and thus allow accurate numerical determination of the asymptotic constant .",
    "this is necessary because in contrast to the circle case where the recurrence relation can be used the full sum must be performed in numerical work .",
    "this restricts the sizes accessible ."
