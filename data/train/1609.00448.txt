    "the choice of which topics to work on directly affects scientists output .",
    "such choices may be determined primarily by scientists research interests or simply by the hotness of the topics .",
    "it has been found that the scientists tend to trace hot topics both in physics @xcite and in biology and medicine @xcite . ``",
    "the rich get richer '' is a common social phenomenon @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we investigate the degree of hotness tracing in mathematics and economics and perform a comparison between these two fields and physics and biomedical science .",
    "intuitively , it might be expected that mathematicians would be more likely to choose their topics of investigation according to their scientific interests and the scientific value of the questions . here",
    ", we empirically examine whether this is the case .    aside from pure curiosity , such a comparison among various fields might have value in the study of science policy .",
    "for example , we wish to examine the correlation between the impact of papers and their degree of hotness tracing . as researchers",
    ", we would prefer to see that less hotness - driven papers have a greater impact . for science policy makers and the administrators of universities , funding agencies and institutes , such a correlation ,",
    "whether positive or negative , could potentially provide guidance regarding their duties , as one of their goals is to seek strategies to improve the scientific impact of the academic units under their administration .",
    "we would also like to examine whether larger teams tend to produce more value - driven papers or more hotness - driven papers .",
    "an answer to this question might have strategic policy value regarding how large research teams should be supported .    in our previous work ,",
    "using data obtained from the american physical society ( aps ) concerning publications in aps journals , we investigated and confirmed the occurrence of hotness tracing in physics @xcite . in this work",
    ", we extended this analysis to the fields of mathematics , economics and biomedical science based on publications from the datasets of the american mathematical review ( amr ) , the journal of economic literature ( jel ) and pubmed , respectively .",
    "each of these databases uses a field - specific classification scheme ",
    "the physics and astronomy classification scheme ( pacs ) for physics , the mathematics subject classification ( msc ) for mathematics , the jel classification codes ( jel ) for economics and the medical subject headings ( mesh ) for biomedical science  and classifies each paper into one or more categories , which we call fields or subfields .",
    "we test how likely a newly published paper is to be in a hot field , where the hotness of each field is measured simply by the current number of published papers in that field .",
    "further details on our methods and data can be found in  [ section : data ] , where we also define a quantity called the relative contribution ratio , @xmath0 , to describe the extent to which researchers from a given country contribute to fields of size @xmath1 compared with the overall contributions of this country to academia .",
    "the exponent @xmath2 and the relative contribution ratio @xmath0 are the statistics that we analyse throughout the remainder of the paper .",
    "we first consider sets consisting of all papers published in each year in each of the three disciplines , determine the overall degree of hotness tracing in each discipline in each year , and compare the results with the degree of hotness tracing in physics .",
    "we then divide the set of papers in each discipline according to various characteristics of each paper , including whether it was published in a top journal , its country of origin , the number of authors , the number of affiliations and the number of references , and study the correlations between these features and the degree of hotness tracing .      as shown in fig .",
    "[ overall ] , the accumulated distribution function @xmath3 follows a power law , namely , @xmath4 .",
    "all of the power - law exponents @xmath2 are positive , indicating that hotter fields ( those that are larger in size ) do attract more newly published papers . these results are qualitatively consistent with our observations in physics : generally , scientists are more likely to choose to publish in hotter subfields . however , the degrees of hotness tracing are different among the various disciplines ; in particular , the exponent in mathematics is markedly larger than those in the other three fields , as is also shown in fig .",
    "[ exponents ] .",
    "this is surprising and counter - intuitive , as it is widely claimed , at least among mathematicians , that the scientific efforts of mathematicians are more independent and more interest - driven or value - driven rather than hotness - driven .",
    "the reasons for this discrepancy are not yet known to us .",
    "empirical preferential attachment to hot fields for newly published papers .",
    "the cumulative probability functions @xmath5 for the ( a ) physics , ( b ) mathematics , ( c ) economics and ( d ) biomedical science datasets show various values of @xmath2 .",
    "( a ) is similar to fig .",
    "1(a ) in @xcite but for different years . ]",
    "the exponents @xmath2 for different years obtained by least - squares fitting of the curves from @xmath6 to @xmath7 for physics , mathematics and economics and from @xmath6 to @xmath8 for biomedical science ; these fitting ranges were chosen because the curves deviate from straight lines at large @xmath1 because of the rarity of such extreme values .",
    "the standard deviations are smaller than @xmath9 .",
    "the goodness of regressions r2 are larger than @xmath10 . unless otherwise stated , @xmath11 is equal to one year for physics , mathematics and economics and one month for biomedical science .",
    "the results for biomedical science are the average values for the corresponding 12 months . in the year 2000",
    ", there is a significant change for the field of mathematics such that the exponent @xmath2 can not be calculated . ]",
    "we wish to know whether , on average , hotness - tracing papers have less impact on academia as a whole . to this end",
    ", we can investigate the correlation between the exponent @xmath2 and the number of received citations .",
    "doing so reveals no clear - cut pattern , although there is an overall trend of an increasing value of the exponent with an increasing number of received citations .",
    "however , it is generally accepted that papers that are published in top journals have a higher impact .",
    "thus , we compare the degree of hotness tracing among papers published in top journals with that among papers published in other journals .    we classify the papers into two subsets , i.e. , those published in top journals and those published in other journals , and for each subset , we calculate the exponent @xmath2 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ citation ] , overall , the exponents @xmath2 for papers in top journals are smaller than those for papers in other journals in all four disciplines .",
    "this finding indicates that publications in top journals are indeed less hotness - driven .",
    "the values of the exponent @xmath2 , as indicators of the degree of hotness tracing , are @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) in physics , @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) in mathematics , @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) in economics and @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) in biomedical science for top ( other ) journals .",
    "we also apply the two - sample kolmogorov - smirnov test ( ks test ) to the sets consisting of the value of @xmath1 for each paper at the time of its publication for top and other journals , and the results of the ks test indicate that for all these disciplines , it is safe to reject the hypothesis that these two sets of @xmath1 values are drawn from the same underlying distribution",
    ".     comparisons of hotness tracing between top journals and other journals : ( a ) physics , in which the top journal is physical review letters ; ( b ) mathematics , in which the top journals are inventiones mathematicae , annals of mathematics , acta mathematica , and the journal of the american mathematical society ; ( c ) economics , in which the top journals are the american economic review , econometrica , the journal of political economy , the quarterly journal of economics , and the review of economic studies ; and ( d ) biomedical science , in which the top journals are nature , science , the proceedings of the national academy of sciences of the united states of america , cell , the new england journal of medicine and lancet . ]",
    "general public and science policy - makers have great interest in the research performance of various countries . here",
    ", we compare the degrees of hotness tracing among various countries .",
    "we classify the papers into subsets according to the countries that appear in their affiliations .",
    "when the authors are from more than one country , the paper is included in the set corresponding to each country .    in calculating the relative contribution ratio @xmath20 ( defined in @xmath21[section : data ] ) , we regard each paper as one unit of contribution to academia as a whole and use fractional counting , in the sense that a country that occurs @xmath22 times among the @xmath23 affiliations of a paper is counted as a contribution of @xmath24 from that country .",
    "the absolute contribution ratios are listed in table [ acr ] .",
    "note that in economics , the contributions from japan and china are very low . as we will see later , this leads to extremely large fluctuations and , consequently , less reliable observations .    as seen from fig .",
    "[ countries_overall](a - c ) , the exponents calculated for china are consistently larger than those for the other three countries in physics , mathematics and economics .",
    "these results indicate that to some extent , chinese scholars trace hot topics more strongly than scholars in other countries . to further characterize the differences among these countries , we consider the relative contribution ratios @xmath0 .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ countries_overall](d - f ) , in all three of these disciplines , the relative contribution ratio @xmath25 of china is smaller in cold fields ( for small @xmath1 values ) and larger in hot fields ( for large @xmath1 values ) , whereas the opposite is true for the usa .",
    "thus , chinese scholars make more ( fewer ) contributions to hot ( cold ) subfields compared with their average contribution to all subfields .",
    "these results further indicate that chinese scientists are more likely to follow hot topics .",
    "we have not investigated potential institutional reasons for this qualitative difference in behaviour between chinese and us scholars , although we strongly suspect that causes may exist at a systematic level . in our definition of @xmath26 , in principle ,",
    "the numerator @xmath27 should eliminate the influence of the absolute sizes of the fields .",
    "therefore , proportionally speaking , in the absence of any other determining factor , the relative contribution ratio should be approximately constant , as in the case of mathematics in germany and japan , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ countries_overall](e ) .",
    "it should be interesting to investigate the possible reasons behind the observed unevenness of the relative contributions to these fields .",
    "an educated guess is that the early development of a research program may be regarded as a catch - up period , during which it is easier to focus more strongly on hotter topics , resulting in smaller contributions in cold subfields and larger contributions in hot subfields .",
    "if this is the case , then it appears that in the field of economics , research in germany , japan and china is much less developed compared with research in the usa .",
    "this is partially confirmed by the small percentage contributions from germany , japan and china , as seen from table [ acr ] .",

    "( a ) and ( d ) are similar to the corresponding figures in our previous paper @xcite but with a slightly different calculation of each country s contribution . ]      next , we investigate the influence of the numbers of authors , affiliations and references on the degree of tracking hot topics .",
    "we classify the papers into subsets according to the numbers of authors , affiliations and references and calculate the hotness - tracing exponent @xmath2 for each subset .",
    "it has been found that in recent years , the size of teams and the share of multi - university collaborations have been larger than ever , and the work of such teams tends to attract more citations@xcite .",
    "in addition , it has also been claimed that research works with many authors or many affiliations are typically more focused on hot topics@xcite .",
    "we would like to examine the relation between team size and the degree of hotness tracing .",
    "knowing whether work from large teams is more likely to be hotness - driven rather than interest- or value - driven can have policy value with regard to explicit support for the building of large teams .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ author](a ) , @xmath2 , the exponent quantifying the tracing of hot topics , increases with an increasing number of authors , from @xmath29 to @xmath30 in physics , from @xmath31 to @xmath32 in mathematics and from @xmath33 to @xmath14 in economics .",
    "these results indicate that large teams typically focus more on hot topics , which is consistent with the argument that studies with many authors are typically more focused on hot topics @xcite .",
    "therefore , on average , establishing large teams is not necessarily a good strategy for encouraging value - driven research .",
    "however , the exponent @xmath2 does not increase with an increasing number of authors in biomedical science .",
    "this implies that in biomedical science , large teams are not necessary less interest- or value - driven than small teams . in this field",
    ", forming large teams might be a good strategy for encouraging value - driven research .",
    "thus , we see that differences between disciplines lead to differences in good team - building strategies .",
    "influences of ( a ) the number of authors @xmath34 , ( b ) the number of affiliations @xmath35 and ( c ) the number of references @xmath36 on the exponent @xmath2 .",
    "the results are shown as the average values of the exponent @xmath2 for different years , and error bars represent the standard deviations . ]",
    "[ author](b ) shows that the exponent @xmath2 increases with an increasing number of affiliations @xmath35 , from @xmath37 to @xmath38 in physics , from @xmath15 to @xmath39 in mathematics and from @xmath40 to @xmath41 in economics .",
    "thus , the above results indicate that on average , cross - affiliation collaborations are not necessarily a good strategy for encouraging value - driven research .    as seen from fig .",
    "[ author](c ) , the exponent @xmath2 also increases with an increasing number of references @xmath36 , from @xmath42 to @xmath43 in physics and from @xmath30 to @xmath44 mathematics , indicating that papers that cite a larger number of references are more likely to address hot topics .",
    "interestingly , however , in economics , the exponent @xmath2 decreases overall with an increasing number of references , from @xmath13 to @xmath45 , implying that papers with a larger number of references are more likely to focus on value - driven research topics .",
    "the reasons for this exceptional observation regarding the correlation between hotness tracing and the number of references in economics as well as the exceptional correlation between hotness tracing and the number of authors in biomedical science are not yet known to us .",
    "in this paper , we investigate the phenomenon of hotness tracing among scientists from four disciplines , namely , physics , mathematics , economics and biomedical science , all of which have yielded a large number of papers with associated subject classification codes .",
    "it is found that overall , scientists in all four disciplines are more likely to publish in hot fields , but surprisingly , the values of the exponent @xmath2 are larger for mathematicians than for the others . we also compare the degrees of hotness tracing between top journals and other journals and find that in all four disciplines , papers published in top journals are less hotness - driven than those in other journals .",
    "in addition , we find that chinese researchers trace hotness more strongly than us , german and japanese researchers in all these disciplines .",
    "moreover , it seems that large teams and cross - affiliation collaborations are not necessarily beneficial for encouraging the pursuit of value - driven studies ; we find that on average , papers with larger numbers of authors , affiliations and references tend to exhibit larger exponents of hotness tracing , although there are interesting exceptions",
    ". papers with more authors are more hotness - driven in physics , mathematics and economics , whereas in biomedical science , such papers are , in fact , less hotness - driven .",
    "it is found that cross - affiliation collaborations are more likely to choose hot topics in physics , mathematics and economics .",
    "in addition , the degree of hotness tracing increases with an increasing number of references in physics and mathematics , whereas the opposite is true in economics .",
    "it is not surprising that papers with large numbers of references are not particularly value - driven or innovative , so this observation in economics is quite non - trivial .",
    "the nature of the unique characteristics of biomedical science and economics that cause them to be exceptions to the generally observed trends remains an open and interesting question .",
    "the results presented in this paper are based on the available data . in particular , the investigated physics papers are limited to all papers published by aps journals , which is only a subset of all physics journals . in principle , we should collect all papers published in physics journals , but may journals do not use pacs numbers .",
    "moreover , in pubmed datasets , the affiliation information is often inaccurate and the references are not included , and at present , we have not merged pubmed data with web of science ( wos ) data . in this work ,",
    "we regard papers published in top journals as high - impact papers . in principle , however , we should consider other measures of impact , such as normalized measures @xcite or measures based on network analysis@xcite . a corresponding study of technological developments could also be interesting ; for example , one might consider hotness tracing in patents .",
    "* methods . * given a set of new papers published at time @xmath46 during a time window @xmath11 ( @xmath47 $ ] ) , we first assign each paper to one or more corresponding fields and then count how many papers belong to each field .",
    "based on the number of papers in each field at time @xmath46 , we count how many of the newly published papers appear in fields of size @xmath1 , which we denote by @xmath48 . if chosen randomly , this @xmath48 should be proportional to the ratio between the number of fields of size @xmath1 ( @xmath49 ) and the number of all fields ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "thus , to determine the deviation from randomness as a measure of hotness tracing , we define @xmath51 it has been found that this curve is close to a power law@xcite .",
    "we then fit this curve of @xmath52 to a power law @xmath53 and refer to the exponent @xmath2 as the degree of hotness tracing .",
    "in fact , to smooth the curves , we use the integral of @xmath54 over @xmath1 for the fits instead ; we call the resulting function @xmath3 , the accumulated distribution function .",
    "in addition to the degree of hotness tracing @xmath2 , we also define the relative contribution ratio @xmath0 for each individual country @xmath55 .",
    "given a set of papers and the fields to which they belong , we calculate a quantity @xmath56 , which is equal to the number of papers contributed by country @xmath55 in fields of size @xmath1 . using this @xmath56 , we define @xmath57 intuitively , the numerator represents the fraction of the contributions made by country @xmath55 out of all papers in fields of size @xmath1 , whereas the denominator represents the fractional contribution of country @xmath55 to all fields .",

    "we consider @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) papers , @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) msc codes and @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) classification labels for the period of 2000 - 2009 ( 1991 - 1999 ) .",
