    "these two clusters were observed during the same nights , and with the same telescope / instrument combination , as ngc  5286 . to obtain the employed calibration , several different @xcite fields were observed during photometric nights , including pg+0918 , pg+1323 , pg+1525 , pg+1528 , pg+1633 , pg+1657 , and ru  152 .",

    "a correction was applied to minimize this effect , following the procedure described in @xcite .",
    "the resulting cmd is shown in figure  [ reddveri ] . due to the saturation of points in this plot ,",
    "the difference is not so striking in the ms , while the red giant branch ( rgb ) and the blue horizontal branch ( hb ) do appear significantly narrower .",
    "finally , in order to further improve the cmd , stars with too large errors in both @xmath1 and @xmath0 were excluded .",
    "as shown in figure  [ err ] , the applied error cut follows the shape of the lower envelope of the error distribution ( poisson error ) , thus excluding the stars with large errors _ compared _ to the error expected at their respective magnitude levels .",

    ", we note that our cmd is clearly in good qualitative agreement with the ones previously published by @xcite and @xcite , revealing a predominantly blue hb and a moderately steep rgb indicative of an intermediate - to - low metallicity .    to determine the mean ridgelines , we have experimented with several different techniques , but finally decided upon what essentially amounts to an eye fit to the data , similar to the procedure previously followed , for instance , by @xcite and @xcite .",

    "the details of this process depend crucially on the precise abundance profile in the h - burning shell ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in the observed cmds and rgb luminosity functions ( lfs ) of globular star clusters , and as first predicted by @xcite and @xcite , one in fact identifies the so - called _ rgb `` bump '' _ as an observed counterpart of this stellar interior phenomenon ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "the cluster data are from table  5 in f99 . in this figure , the derived position of ngc  5286 is shown as a filled dot with error bar ; as we can see , the position of ngc  5286 in this plane is consistent with our inferred metallicity for the cluster .",
    "we also calculated @xmath180 @xcite , the ratio between the number of rgb stars in the bump region ( @xmath181 ) and the number of rgb stars in the interval @xmath182 .",
