    "while the potential model has its limitations , it gives bound state solutions that have the advantage of providing information such as the size of glueballs , an aspect which is rarely @xcite mentioned in the literature . in sect .",
    "2 , we give the details of model description for low - lying bound states of 2-gluon and 3-gluon glueballs .",

    "( [ rat ] ) to determine @xmath101 , we find that it depends mainly on @xmath66 , but is almost independent of @xmath62 .",
    "this is to be expected since the need for smearing comes from the short distance potential .",
    "with the mass ratio fixed , we find a smaller @xmath66 ( and a greater @xmath62 in general ) can accommodate a larger @xmath101 value , which is reasonable .",
    "the typical value of @xmath101 falls in the range of 2.3 to 4.3 , which ensures that the @xmath6 mass is stable .",

    "these figures illustrate the range of uncertainties within the model .",
    "we find that the masses increase with increasing @xmath62 or decreasing @xmath66 ; however , increasing @xmath62 or decreasing @xmath66 will increase the size of @xmath6 glueball but decrease the size of @xmath2 glueball",
    ". we will give a more detailed discussion on this later .",
    "as mentioned already , the @xmath6 glueball mass is stable and almost independent of @xmath101 for @xmath109 , which holds for all solvable ( @xmath66 , @xmath62 ) parameter space .",
    "hence , taking the @xmath6 glueball mass range of @xmath110 to @xmath111 from fig . 4 and the lattice result of @xmath1=2400 mev , we estimate the effective gluon mass to be @xmath112 gev , which agrees well with the gluon mass @xmath113 0.66 gev needed  @xcite to explain the photon spectrum in radiative @xmath8 decay . with gluon mass @xmath23 determined , the typical size of @xmath6 and @xmath2 glueballs can be read off from fig . 5 , which are in the ranges of @xmath114 fm and @xmath115 fm , respectively , which is in good agreement with the results @xcite obtained on a lattice using the source method .",

    "for these glueballs , all the @xmath91 terms are repulsive , hence their masses are automatically bounded from below , and there is no need to smear the @xmath91 function .",

    "6 , we find that the masses of the three lowest lying 3-gluon glueballs are within @xmath136 ( or 100 mev ) of each other , which holds for any @xmath62 value . in other words , they are nearly degenerate , which we will discuss further in the next section .",
    "we note that the ratio with @xmath6 mass is around 1.53 , almost independent of @xmath62 and @xmath66 , and agrees with naive constituent counting .",
    "scaling from the lattice result of @xmath137 mev the mass range of these glueballs is @xmath7 gev , right in the ballpark of @xmath8 and @xmath9 masses .",
    "their sizes are only slightly larger than the @xmath6 2-gluon glueball , and fall into the range of @xmath138 fm .",
    "we approximated the attractive @xmath91-function by a smearing function @xmath139 in eq .",
    "( [ m38 ] ) . this is physically reasonable since the gluons in a glueball can not have very large relative momentum that corresponds to very short distance separation . through the variational method , besides the constituent terms @xmath140 and @xmath141 , one can check four sources for the glueball mass : kinetic energy , yukawa and delta function potential , and string energy .",
    "it is clear that smaller glueball size implies a greater kinetic energy contribution to its mass .",
    "the yukawa term is always attractive and contributes negatively to the glueball mass .",
    "it is proportional to the adjoint strong coupling constant @xmath66 , eq .",
    "( [ lam ] ) , and becomes more negative for smaller glueball size .",
    "the delta - function term , replaced by the smearing function @xmath139 of eq .",
    "( [ m38 ] ) , is also proportional to @xmath66 , and becomes stronger for smaller glueball size . as for string energy term",
    ", a bigger glueball can store more energy hence a larger glueball mass . a greater string tension @xmath62 also stores more energy in the string . knowing about these four sources",
    ", we can see how the mass and size of a glueball comes about .",
    "let us first consider masses . for the @xmath6 glueball , the kinetic energy is relatively small due to its rather large size compared to the @xmath2 glueball . on the other hand",
    ", there is a cancellation between @xmath66-dependent attractive yukawa potential and repulsive delta - function terms .",
    "the resulting value is always negative , and will further cancel against the kinetic energy term .",
    "hence the main contribution to the mass comes from the string energy , and the stronger the string tension @xmath62 , the heavier the mass . for fixed string tension",
    ", a larger @xmath66 value gives a stronger cancellation between the remnant of short distance potential and the kinetic energy , resulting in a smaller contribution to the glueball mass .",
    "in other words , the @xmath6 glueball mass increases with increasing @xmath62 or decreasing @xmath66 , as can be seen in fig .",
    "4 .    for the @xmath2 glueball ,",
    "the kinetic enengy term is relatively large because of the small size , which in turn is brought about by the attractive @xmath91 function , and there is strong cancellation between these two terms .",
    "since we have fixed the mass ratio with @xmath6 , it turns out that the kinetic energy overcomes the attractive @xmath91 function , and subsequently cancels against the attractive yukawa term",
    ". the net result could be positive or negative depending on smaller or larger @xmath66 value .",
    "the main contribution still comes from the string term but it can not be as strong as in the case of @xmath6 because of the small size .",
    "we stress again that in fig .",
    "4 we have held the @xmath6 and @xmath2 ratios fixed according to eq .",
    "( [ rat ] ) .",
    "we turn to the consideration of sizes , _",
    "i.e. _ understanding fig .",
    "we find that the glueball size increases with mass for @xmath6 glueball .",
    "this is easily understood in terms of a repulsive @xmath91 and the dominance of string energy . for @xmath2 glueball ,",
    "its size is sensitive to @xmath66 , which can be understood as coming indirectly from smearing . as a consequence of imposing eq .",
    "( [ rat ] ) , the value for @xmath101 depends mainly on @xmath66 and can become larger for lower @xmath66 . for larger @xmath101 ,",
    "the smearing function @xmath139 approaches the delta function and is more attractive .",
    "thus , paradoxially , a smaller @xmath66 (  less attractive \" ) is more able to  pull in \" the glueball , leading to decrease in size .",
    "however , the size of the @xmath2 glueball is almost @xmath62 independent precisely because of its small size , hence insensitive to the string energy .",
    "we note that the smallness of the @xmath2 glueball stretches the applicability of our relativistic expansion .",
    "it is therefore amusing that figs .",
    "4 and 5 are in rather good agreement with the findings of ref .",

    "all the @xmath91 terms in the potential are repulsive , hence no smearing is needed .",
    "there is a @xmath66-dependent cancellation between the yukawa and delta - function terms .",
    "interestingly , both terms become stronger for larger total spin ( or @xmath129 ) , and the cancellation hides the spin effect , resulting in the masses being nearly degenerate .",
    "in other words , their masses and sizes are almost @xmath66-independent and depend basically on @xmath62 , just like @xmath6 case .",
    "it is rather intriguing that the mass difference of the three glueballs are within 100 mev of each other .",
    "but as we have mentioned earlier , the @xmath3 state would become heavier via mixing with the @xmath144 two - gluon state .",
    "comparing figs . 4 and 6 , we note that the 3-gluon glueball masses are about 1.5 times larger than @xmath6 , largely independent of @xmath62 and @xmath66 .",
    "taking @xmath1 between @xmath145 mev  @xcite and @xmath146 mev  @xcite , one finds @xmath147 in the range of @xmath148 gev , close to the @xmath9 mass of 3686 mev .",
    "we note that the proximity of the @xmath4 glueball to @xmath9 may be called for from comparsion of @xmath8 and @xmath9 two body hadronic decays  @xcite .",

    "@xcite , which should also be brought up to date .    in conclusion ,",
    "we investigate the bound states of two and three massive gluons with a schrdinger equation .",
    "we calculate the short distance potential from one gluon exchange , and give arguments for the long distance confining potential .",
    "we calculate glueball masses and sizes using variational method . by considering the effect of smearing of the gluon fields , we find that the size of @xmath2 glueball could be rather small compared with others .",
    "the other glueball masses are stable with respect to such smearing . using the converging experimental and lattice results for @xmath2 and @xmath6 glueballs , we estimate the effective gluon mass to be 0.6 to 0.7 gev , in agreement with phenomenological results . the typical size of @xmath6 and @xmath2 are of order 1 fm and 0.1 to 0.2 fm , respectively .",

    "<S> we estimate the masses and in particular the _ sizes _ of low - lying bound states with no orbital angular momentum . by considering quantum - mechanical smearing of the gluon fields and normalizing to lattice results on @xmath0 and @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the @xmath2 glueball is rather small in size compared with the others . </S>",
    "<S> the fitted gluon mass is of order 600 to 700 mev , which is reasonable . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 three gluon glueball states are nearly degenerate , and their mass ratio with @xmath6 is largely independent of all parameters and consistent with lattice calculations . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the mass of the @xmath4 glueball to be around @xmath7  gev , which is close to the mass of @xmath8 and @xmath9 . </S>"
