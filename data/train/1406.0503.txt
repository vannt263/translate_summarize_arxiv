    "both semiclassical frequencies are quite close to the exact result .",
    "we also note that strictly speaking , when the order is incommensurate , the number of bands crossing the fermi energy is infinite . even in the presence of commensurate order , but with a long period , the tangle of bands is quite dense . for this reason",
    ", we find it more convenient to plot the spectral function in the full brillouin zone as it clearly shows the bands that carry the highest spectral weight .",
    "moreover , the features highlighted by the spectral function are reflected quantitatively in the quantum oscillations observed in our computations . as the strength of the incommensurate order",
    "is increased , it has been argued @xcite that the incommensurate nature will play a more significant role in disrupting the oscillations .",
    "let us stress that previous treatments of the oscillations in the cuprates were restricted to charge modulations with commensuration periods of 3 - 4 lattice spacing , whereas the experimental bdw is incommensurate .",

    "although there are theoretical models @xcite predicting that the bond order wavevector is tied to the geometry of the fermi surface , connecting special points called hot spots where the fermi surface intersects the magnetic brillouin zone , it is unclear if the experimentally obtained wavevector is identical to this wavevector across different families of the cuprates . in this work ,",

    "we also find that the size of the hole pocket decreases with doping , and we observe a corresponding change in the oscillation frequency.while this very small pocket is a rather natural and almost unavoidable consequence of this reconstruction scheme , the detection of corresponding quantum oscillations is challenging",
    ". in particular , it may be difficult to distinguish them from the interference between electron pocket oscillations due to bilayer splitting .",
    "moreover , its location closer to the antinodal region leaves it more exposed to enhanced scattering and superconducting fluctuations , and this could suppress the amplitude of oscillations beyond detection .",
    "there are however indications of its existence in the recent work of ref .  .",
    "the reconstruction scheme used so far assumes a bidirectional bond density wave with equal amplitude on both wavevectors @xmath34 and @xmath35 , a so called checkerboard order . as there is some experimental evidence @xcite",

    "the second wavevector causes the opening of further gaps , and the creation of one electron pocket ( in red ) and two inequivalent hole pockets ( blue and green ) , which are smoothly connected to the ones present in the isotropic case .",

    "let us now give an intuitive picture for what is causing the arcs .",
    "the damping of the superconducting order , combined with the @xmath89wave form factor , leads to enhanced scattering of the fermionic excitations close to the anti - nodes .",
    "what is left in the form of an arc are essentially the nodal quasiparticles which have survived as sharp excitations . as temperature increases ,",
    "a larger region around the nodes survives the effect of scattering by superconducting fluctuations .",
    "this is consistent with the observations of kanigel et al .",
    "@xcite , who also observed an increase in the arc length as a function of increasing temperature .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that @xmath89wave bond order fluctuations would also cause enhanced scattering around points of the fermi surface that are nested by the bdw wavevector .",
    "however , the correlation length of the bond order is much shorter than the superconducting one , by merit of our choice of the parameters @xmath46 and @xmath70 , and hence this phenomenon is not visible in fig .",
    "[ akwevolution ] .",
    "in general , for correlation lengths of order a few lattice spacings , as seen in experiment , the effect of bond order fluctuations on the spectral function is negligible .    if , however , the correlation length is enhanced , for example by setting @xmath90 , such that we have a fully isotropic o(6 ) model , then bond order fluctuations have a distinct effect , as shown in fig .",
    "[ cdwshad ] . at the lowest temperature the original fermi surface breaks up into an arc - like feature close to the nodes and a number of shadow - like features similar to those discussed earlier in connection to long - range bond order . in spite of the bond order correlations being short - ranged and fluctuating ,",
    "the shadows arise purely from the real part of the self - energy .",
    "in addition to the observations made above , here we have the additional effect that superconducting fluctuations somewhat suppress the shadows near the antinodes .",
    "it would be interesting to look for signatures of these features in future experiments in high quality samples .",
    "interestingly , more recent experiments carried out using a different protocol seem to suggest that the arc length stays constant over a wide range of temperature and eventually undergoes a collapse at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "this was presented as evidence for the bdw fluctuations playing a more prominent role in giving rise to the arcs . however , within our setup , the density wave fluctuations with a correlation length of even up to 10 lattice spacings do nt play any significant role in the arc phenomenology . furthermore , in the presence of purely density wave fluctuations , the energy gap is centered above the fermi energy for points situated between the antinodes and regions that are nested by the density wave wavevector @xcite .",
    "this has been confirmed in arpes experiments @xcite .",
    "let us now discuss the properties of @xmath91 as a function of frequency for @xmath92 points on the bare fermi surface @xmath93 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ cutsakw ] , at the lowest temperature @xmath94 , a well - defined gap is present at the antinodes . moving towards the node ( from the blue to the red scans ) , the gap closes at a @xmath92 point which we identify with the tip of the arc .",
    "as temperature increases the gap closes and the full fermi surface is recovered at sufficiently high temperatures .",
    "we note in passing that the location of the peak at the antinode at @xmath95 is shifted away from @xmath96 due to a renormalization of the bare dispersion by @xmath97 .",
    "[ cutsw ] displays the quasiparticle dispersion along the black dashed lines labelled 1 - 4 in fig.[akwevolution ] as a function of temperature . for the first cut , at the antinode ,",
    "there is a well - defined gap in the quasiparticle spectrum at the fermi surface , which closes as temperature increases .",
    "the overall scale of the gap is set by the magnitudes of @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "a similar behavior is seen for the second and third cut , albeit with a smaller gap that closes at a lower temperature .",
    "the fourth cut is a scan across the nodes and the dispersion remains gapless since neither the sc nor the bdw fluctuations affect the nodal quasiparticles .    as noted above , for our specific choice of parameters ,",
    "the bdw fluctuations are subdominant to the sc fluctuations in the photoemission spectrum .",
    "in particular , the dispersions and the gap structure in the normal state obtained from this analysis are approximately particle - hole symmetric ( as evident from figs .",
    "[ cutsakw ] and  [ cutsw ] ) .",
    "however , recent experiments have seen evidence for particle - hole asymmetry at the tips of the fermi - arcs and in the antinodes @xcite .",
    "such an asymmetry arises naturally in the presence of more pronounced bdw fluctuations ( as compared to the superconducting fluctuations ) .",
    "our formalism can reproduce some of these features in the presence of fluctuating bdw with longer correlation lengths and stronger coupling to the fermions .",
    "finally , we reiterate the statement in the introduction that the present computation is expected to apply at the intermediate temperatures where charge order fluctuations are appreciable . a more complex model also including antiferromagnetism is likely needed at higher temperatures , which we do not discuss here .",
    "we have analyzed the influence of incommensurate density wave order on quantum oscillations and the combined effect of pairing and density wave fluctuations on photoemission in the underdoped cuprates . in combination with other recent results @xcite",
    ", such a model appears to provide a satisfactory description of the underdoped cuprates in current high - field @xcite , photoemission @xcite , nmr @xcite , stm @xcite , and x - ray @xcite experiments .",
    "it can also be subjected to further tests by experiments at higher fields , in cleaner samples , or with higher precision .",
    "however , our analysis does not strongly constrain the nature of the high temperature pseudogap , where we need sharper experimental tests of the distinction between the two categories of models described in the introduction . on this issue , a recent work @xcite has argued that the wavevector of the @xmath12-form factor bdw supports the spin liquid models in the first category .",
    "we suggest that unravelling the nature of the quantum - critical point apparent in recent experiments near optimal doping @xcite , and deciphering the nature of the strange metal , may be the route to resolving these long - standing and difficult questions .",
    "quantum oscillations are a manifestation of landau quantization .",
    "as the magnetic field varies , landau levels are brought across the fermi energy one after the other , causing the density of states to peak periodically , with consequent oscillations in thermodynamic and transport quantities .",
    "we now briefly derive landau quantization for free electrons on a lattice at the semiclassical level . the derivation",

    "<S> the central puzzle of the cuprate superconductors at low hole density is the nature of the pseudogap regime . </S>",
    "<S> it has a number of seemingly distinct experimental signatures : a suppression of the paramagnetic spin susceptibility at high temperatures , low energy electronic excitations that extend over arcs in the brillouin zone , x - ray detection of charge density wave order at intermediate temperatures , and quantum oscillations at high magnetic fields and low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> we show that a model of competing charge density wave and superconducting orders provides a unified description of the intermediate and low temperature regimes . </S>",
    "<S> we treat quantum oscillations at high field beyond semiclassical approximations , and find clear and robust signatures of an electron pocket compatible with existing observations ; we also predict oscillations due to additional hole pockets . in the zero field and intermediate temperature regime , </S>",
    "<S> we compute the electronic spectrum in the presence of thermally fluctuating charge density and superconducting orders . </S>",
    "<S> our results are compatible with experimental trends .    </S>",
    "<S> the suppression of the paramagnetic spin susceptibility of the cuprate superconductors at a high temperature @xcite ( often denoted @xmath0 ) implies the growth of antiferromagnetic spin correlations , and a gap - like decrease in the electronic density of states at the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> it is useful to separate existing theoretical models of the resulting pseudogap regime into two broad categories .    in the first category , </S>",
    "<S> the antiferromagnetic correlations signal the onset of a quantum spin liquid @xcite , which in turn could be unstable to other symmetry - broken phases at lower temperatures . for this to be a useful characterization , there should be remnants of the topological order of the spin liquid at high temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> one possibility is the presence of closed fermi pockets which violate the luttinger theorem constraining the total area enclosed by the fermi surface @xcite , but so far photoemission spectra only show intensity on open arcs in the brillouin zone .    in the second category @xcite , the antiferromagnetic correlations are precursors to the appearance of antiferromagnetism , superconductivity , charge density wave , and possibly other conventional orders at low temperatures . in the pseudogap regime , we then have primarily thermal and classical , rather than quantum , fluctuations of these orders . in the recent work of hayward _ </S>",
    "<S> et al._@xcite , it was shown that the unusual temperature dependence of the x - ray scattering signal of the charge density wave order @xcite is obtained naturally from an effective classical model of angular thermal fluctuations of the charge - density wave and superconducting orders alone . </S>",
    "<S> the same model has also been connected to diamagnetism measurements over the same temperature range @xcite . within this framework , in the intermediate temperature range over which the charge order correlations have been observed , antiferromagnetic correlations need not be included explicitly , but can be absorbed into the phenomenological parameters of the classical model of charge and superconducting orders .    in the underdoped regime , quantum oscillations </S>",
    "<S> have been observed in two different families of the cuprates at high - fields and low temperatures @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the results seem to indicate that the phase at high - fields has fermi - liquid like properties , albeit with a fermi - surface that occupies only a tiny fraction of the brillouin zone . </S>",
    "<S> harrison and sebastian propose @xcite that these can be understood as a consequence of a bidirectional charge density wave order : they argue that with the fermi surface topology of the hole - doped cuprates , such an order leads to oscillations from a single electron pocket , and that this is compatible with all important observed features . </S>",
    "<S> their analysis is based upon a computation in zero field , followed by a semiclassical account of the influence of the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> however , since incommensurate charge order induces a complex fermi surface reconstruction , it is not a priori evident that this particular electron pocket would dominate the oscillations .    in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that a model of charge - density wave and superconducting orders provides a unified description of the high - field , low - temperature quantum - oscillations , and of certain features of the zero - field photoemission results at intermediate temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> while this model fits naturally into the second category of theories of the pseudogap summarized above , it may also be accommodated by the symmetry breaking instabilities of the spin liquid models in the first category . </S>",
    "<S> first , we present a fully quantum mechanical analysis of the oscillations , carried out in a model which includes the lattice potential , charge order , and the magnetic field . we do indeed find signatures of the electron pocket in the quantum oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> we also find clear oscillations from smaller hole pockets , which should be detectable in experiments . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis includes a description of the crossover in the oscillations from bidirectional ( checkerboard ) to unidirectional ( stripe - like ) density wave order . </S>",
    "<S> second , we turn to photoemission experiments @xcite at intermediate temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> we couple electrons to the thermally fluctuating charge and superconducting orders described by the angular fluctuation model of hayward _ </S>",
    "<S> et al._@xcite , and compute the electron spectral function as a function of momentum and energy . </S>",
    "<S> our results are in good agreement with some of the observed trends . </S>"
