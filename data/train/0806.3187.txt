    "superconducting quantum interference devices ( squids ) are the most sensitive magnetic flux sensors known today .",
    "studying and improving squid properties has been a major research field in the last few decades @xcite .",
    "most high @xmath0 squids are fabricated on strontium titanate ( sto ) substrates .",
    "it has been seen that large dielectric constant of sto strongly affects the performance of high @xmath0 dc squids by causing transmission line resonances to appear in their current - voltage characteristics @xcite .",
    "this was pointed out for instance , by lee et al who experimentally showed that their hairpin shaped squid loop could be treated as a quarter wave microwave resonator in order to predict the voltage at which the resonance appeared in their measurements @xcite .",
    "enpuku et al used a theoretical approach to predict the effect of the resonances based upon a transformation of the distributed resonator structure of the squid loop into a series of lumped element resonators @xcite .",
    "this enabled them to calculate the current - voltage characteristics of the squid and later , the voltage - flux curves for other devices .",
    "however , it was necessary for them to solve the resulting differential equations numerically . in this paper , we develop an analytic approach to investigate the effects of transmission line resonances on dc squid resonance characteristics .",
    "we are able to obtain good agreement between experiment and theory for devices in the literature @xcite .",
    "we find that the resonance positions are mainly controlled by the product of the junction critical current @xmath4 and junction normal state resistance @xmath5 as well as the dielectric constant of the substrate @xmath6 .",
    "we also investigate the effects of introducing asymmetry in junction parameters .",
    "we find that the resonance positions are not very sensitive to the asymmetry .",
    "the actual magnitude of the current - voltage curve and @xmath7 curves are however sensitive to the degree of asymmetry introduced .",
    "we ignore the effects of thermal noise in performing our calculations .",
    "noise analysis can be performed perturbatively as in @xcite . in such calculations ,",
    "the lowest order result is the noise free case where our analysis will be useful .",
    "we begin with a brief outline of relevant previous work in the study of the effect of transmission line resonances on squid characteristics in section 2 . in section 3 ,",
    "we derive the power balance relation in terms of squid parameters , which involves deriving an expression for the circulating current through the squid inductance .",
    "section 4 discusses current - voltage @xmath1 curves for symmetric squids whereas in section 5 , effects of introducing asymmetry on @xmath1 , voltage - flux @xmath2 curves and squid modulation - current @xmath8 curves are discussed .",
    "the paper ends with a discussion of results obtained in section 6 .",
    "the geometry of the squid washer that we have used is shown in fig.([geometry]a ) .",
    "this is a geometry commonly used to manufacture squids @xcite and is the geometry enpuku et al used to numerically investigate the effects of large dielectric constant of strontium titanate ( sto ) on the characteristics of high @xmath0 dc squids @xcite .",

    "the squid slit behaves as a transmission line with distributed inductance @xmath21 and distributed capacitance @xmath22 .",
    "the impedance @xmath23 of the slit seen from terminals a and b is given by @xcite : [ impedance ] z_ab = iz_0(l ) + il_pr where @xmath24 is the characteristic impedance of the slit transmission line , @xmath25 is the angular frequency of measurement and @xmath26 is the junction parasitic inductance .",
    "the first term arises because the hairpin shaped slit can be treated as a shorted transmission line of length @xmath9 .",

    "this transformation to an equivalent circuit has the advantage that it allows us to consider loss in the transmission line . in the lossy case",

    "@xmath9 is the squid slit length .",
    "this expression allows us to express the impedance @xmath23 by the series of l - c - r resonant circuits as shown in fig.([geometry]b ) .",
    "we will now show derivations of various quantities in the lossless limit and then quote the results obtained for the lossy case which can be derived analogously .",
    "the circuit equations can be easily derived by the application of kirchhoff s laws . in fig.([geometry]b ) , current entering point c should equal current leaving point c. we are assuming the most general case in which the squid is made up of junctions which are asymmetric @xcite .",

    "in reference @xcite , enpuku et al derive the squid power balance equation in the absence of transmission line resonances . by allowing the slit length to tend to zero , hence treating the squid inductance as a lumped inductance instead of a distributed parameter ,",
    "we retrieve enpuku s expression for the power balance relation : + [ enpuku ] i_b v_dc = 2 v_dc^2 + i^2 ( 1 + ( 2 ) ) 2 ( 1 + _",

    "then it again increases for higher bias current values .",
    "the complete flattening of the @xmath90 curve or @xmath94 going to zero indicates a resonance position . with the introduction of current asymmetry ( fig.([vphi1 ] ) ) , the voltage values are less than the corresponding ones in the absence of asymmetry for a particular bias current ; for instance , for @xmath95 , maximum @xmath91 in the absence of asymmetry is around 1.62 whereas for the same bias current the maximum voltage decreases to around 1.45 in the presence of current asymmetry .",
    "both fig.([vphi2]a ) , where only resistance asymmetry is considered and fig.([vphi2]b ) , where both resistance and current asymmetries are considered exhibit skewed @xmath90 curves .",
    "beyer et al @xcite found that @xmath90 curves got skewed on introduction of asymmetry in squid parameters .",
    "we find that complete flattening of @xmath90 curves is absent when resistance asymmetry is introduced i.e. the minima in the curves do not go to zero . from lee s experimental data ( for example see fig.([leezerohalf]a , b ) )",
    "we find , that at @xmath96 , the voltage values for @xmath97 and @xmath98 are almost the same .",
    "this indicates a resonance position .",
    "thus we expect flattening of the voltage - flux curves at this position .",
    "this indicates that even though some current asymmetry may be present in the squid ( see fig.([vphi1]b ) ) , resistance asymmetry is probably absent .",
    "fig.([deltav ] ) shows the comparison between voltage modulation @xmath99 where both @xmath92 and @xmath100 are in normalized units in cases where no asymmetry is considered and when various asymmetries are introduced .",
    "we find that the resonance position is almost unaffected when just current asymmetry is introduced .",
    "however , the magnitude of @xmath92 decreases by around 20% . on introduction of just resistance asymmetry on the other hand , the magnitude of @xmath92 increases , by almost 100% for the first peak and by around 20% for the next couple of peaks .",
    "the resonance position also seems to shift towards the left ( towards smaller current values ) . on introduction of both current and resistance asymmetries ,",
    "the resonances get rather flattened and there is a general decrease in magnitude of @xmath92 in keeping with the observation for just current asymmetry and the resonance position , especially the first peak shifts a little leftward in keeping with the observation for just resistance asymmetry .",
    "the other peaks do not show any significant shift .",
    "in this paper , we analytically investigated the effects of transmission line resonances on dc squid characteristics . we obtain a closed form expression for the @xmath101 characteristics of the squid .",
    "we use squid parameters used by lee et al @xcite and compare our theoretical simulations with their experimental data .",

    "the actual magnitude of the current - voltage curve and @xmath7 curves are however sensitive to the degree of asymmetry introduced .",
    "our analytical solution may provide us with a method of theoretically determining the value of the dielectric constant of the substrate if we use that as a fit parameter between experimental and theoretical graphs . in an earlier work ,",
