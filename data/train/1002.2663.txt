    "in our recent letter @xcite we predicted nanoscale field patterns ( _ stratification _ ) emerging in one - dimensional ( 1d ) arrays and two - dimensional ( 2d ) lattices of strongly interacting atoms , driven by a radiation nearly resonant to the atomic transition .",
    "we predicted excitation of so called _ locsitons _ and a host of related effects .",
    "a general formulation of the problem and a more detailed theory for 1d arrays was presented in our most recent paper @xcite .",
    "the present paper is an extension of @xcite toward the theory of _",
    "2d lattices _ of resonant atoms , which produce a much richer set of effects .",
    "we construct here a detailed theory of interactions in the system by developing different 2d versions of the nearest - neighbor approximation ( nna ) , including the `` near - ring '' approximation ( nra ) .",
    "we also derive dispersion relations for various lattice - polarization configurations for all locsiton wave vectors within the corresponding first brillouin zones .",
    "our theory predicts such phenomena as subwavelength multicell patterns , including multivortex locsiton excitations , and locsitons localized near lattice defects .",
    "further on , we predict `` magic shapes '' of nanosize groups of atoms , which reverse the effect of a resonant locsiton suppression present in all but few configurations .",
    "the simplest magic configuration which can be cut out of a triangular lattice is a six - point star with an atom at its center , which makes the lowest `` magic number '' of atoms to be 13",
    ".    the predicted effects would be totally unexpected within the standard theory of local fields @xcite going back to the works of lorentz @xcite and lorenz @xcite .",
    "that celebrated theory asserts that the microscopic electric field @xmath0 acting upon any given atom in a medium  the _ local _ field ( lf)differs from the macroscopic field @xmath1 of the electromagnetic wave , because electric dipoles induced in neighboring atoms produce extra field to supplement the field of the incident wave .",
    "this difference is significant in dense media , where the interatomic interactions are sufficiently strong . under such conditions , typical interatomic distances",
    "are much shorter than the optical wavelength , and the dipole - dipole interactions between atoms can be treated as quasistatic .",
    "the major point of the lorentz - lorenz theory ( llt ) of local fields is that the llt contains a fundamental assumption ( which often remains implicit and unspoken in the literature ) that the lf varies very insignificantly between neighboring atoms , much like the applied optical field on the subwavelength scale .",
    "unsurprisingly , that theory results in the lf being proportional to the macroscopic electric field , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the dielectric constant of the medium .    as we have shown in @xcite , this assumption of the lf uniformity",
    "is not universally applicable ; moreover , it completely falls apart when the uniformity of the atomic lattice is disturbed by impurities , boundaries , etc .",
    "indeed , when the interatomic interactions are sufficiently strong and the system is not very large , highly nonuniform lf distributions emerge , resulting in a strong stratification of the lf and atomic excitations .",
    "this effect is best manifested in small - scale ordered arrays and lattices of atoms at near - resonance conditions , which allow to attain high interaction strength between neighboring atoms and to easily control it by tuning the laser frequency .",
    "we have shown @xcite that when the interaction with neighboring atoms becomes comparable to that with the external field , so that the interaction strength exceeds some critical value , the system will support lf excitations , which we call _ locsitons_. in finite - size arrays and lattices , standing waves of locsitons may form nanoscale strata and complex patterns in the lf ( and hence , in the induced atomic dipoles ) .",
    "a typical spacing between atoms in the arrays and lattices exhibiting the lf stratification is a few orders of magnitude shorter than the wavelength of light , so the quasistatic approximation of the standard llt can still be used .",
    "it is worth noting that locsitons are basically a linear phenomenon and can be excited by a weak incident field .",
    "we want to stress that locsitons , i.e. , spatially nonuniform solutions , are not new stable - state alternatives to a presumably unstable uniform lorentz solution at certain interaction parameters ; the stability or instability of the solution is not an issue here .",
    "the emergence of locsitons is determined by the boundary conditions in a _ finite structure _ , so a locsiton is essentially _ the only _ physical solution , which thus replaces the uniform lorentz solution .",
    "absorption plays an important role here , as it directly affects spatial attenuation of locsitons and thus the maximum distance to a boundary , defect , or other inhomogeneity where locsitons can appear .",
    "in particular , as we have shown in @xcite , the size of an array that can support well pronounced locsitons is directly related to the characteristic absorption length .",
    "locsitons vanish in the bulk of a crystal sufficiently far away from boundaries or defects .",
    "due to recent advances in fabricating nanoscale structures , the observation and practical applications of the lf nanostratification are becoming a reality .",
    "theoretically , strongly interacting resonant particles discussed in @xcite do not have to be atoms , but may also be quantum dots , molecules , clusters , etc .",
    "however , one has to remember that one of the major conditions for the structure to support the locsitons is that the interaction strength has to exceed a critical value . since this strength is proportional to the square of an individual dipole momentum and inversely proportional to the cube of the interparticle spacing and the linewidth of the particle resonance ( see below )",
    ", the atoms may become preferred candidates .",
    "a very high finesse of atomic resonances ( i.e. , their narrow linewidth ) , compared , for example , to plasmons ( see below ) , also contributes greatly to the phenomenon , allowing one to see high - order locsiton resonances .",
    "to observe locsitons , one have to create conditions to couple them efficiently to an optical or some other kind of a probe . in @xcite",
    "we suggested a few promising methods of locsiton detection .",
    "in particular , locsitons could be observed via size - related resonances in a scattering of laser radiation or via x - ray or electron - energy - loss spectroscopy .",
    "there are many potential applications of locsitons ; here we will mention two of them which were discussed in @xcite .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that in the presence of a sufficiently strong optical field ( i.e. , in the nonlinear case ) , the lf in 1d arrays of strongly coupled dipoles can exhibit optical bistability , which could be used to design nanoscale all - dielectric logic elements and switches .",
    "such devices might complement currently used semiconductor - based electronic circuits .",
    "another potential application of locsitons could be based on the extreme sensitivity of size - related locsiton resonances to the size and shape of the system . at the exact atomic resonance ,",
    "the field is normally `` pushed out '' of the atomic system , unless it has a certain `` magic shape '' @xcite .",
    "consequently , such `` magic structures '' of atoms could find applications in designing nanoscale biosensors .",
    "removing the assumption of the llt that the dipoles in the medium oscillate in lockstep with the incident electromagnetic wave is a substantial paradigm shift in the theory of light - matter interaction .",
    "locsitons predicted within our broader approach are a new phenomenon , although we can provide some incomplete but illustrative analogies from other areas of physics .",
    "for example , short- and long - wavelength strata in @xcite are reminiscent of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic arrangements of static magnetic dipoles in the ising model .",
    "the llt is , on the other hand , more similar to the mean - field approach of the curie - weiss theory for magnetic media @xcite .",
    "the ising model is known to have richer consequences than the curie - weiss theory .",
    "our case is , however , substantially different and most of all , more versatile than the ising model .",
    "indeed , instead of being static , as in the ising model , the atomic dipoles are induced by the applied optical field and can oscillate with arbitrary amplitude and phase . by their nature",
    ", locsitons may be classified as frenkel excitons @xcite , because there is no charge transfer between atoms and the dipole interaction is due to bound electrons .",
    "some of the locsiton effects , first of all , wave resonances , may be viewed as analogues of other types of oscillations and waves in condensed matter , like plasmons and phonons @xcite , as well as low - dimensional effects , like surface plasmons @xcite , size - related resonances in thin metal films @xcite or long organic molecules @xcite , `` quantum carpets '' @xcite , arrays of pendulums or electronic circuits @xcite , etc .",
    "approaching from another perspective , one can view the formation of a locsiton band as a rabi broadening of the atomic resonance due to strong interatomic interactions , which is essentially similar to the band formation in solid - state theory .",
    "however , although all waves and oscillations may be said to have something in common , locsitons form a distinct new class of phenomena because of the nonconductive , dielectric , nature of their optical response and a strong coupling between atoms , which is needed for attaining dramatic size - related resonances , magic configurations , and other interesting effects .",
    "a separate issue outside of the scope of this paper is how the structures can be fabricated or arranged .",
    "one can envision placing the atoms in a controlled way on the surface of suitable dielectric materials ; recent developments in the atomic- and ion - traps technology allow for arranging atoms in vacuum as 1d arrays and 2d `` crystals '' in the so called wire traps @xcite .",
    "our paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec - general ] we outline our problem and present some general formulas ; for more details the reader should refer to our recent paper @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec - in - plane ] we describe locsitons in infinite , unbounded , 2d lattices of resonant atoms in the case when the incident field is polarized in the lattice plane .",
    "the equations for the lf and the dispersion relations for the locsitons are first obtained in the nra and then in the more precise nna . in sec .",
    "[ sec - finite ] we discuss effects that arise in finite 2d lattices , in particular , formation of 2d patterns of the lf , due to size - related locsiton resonances , and the `` magic '' cancellation of the resonant lf suppression . in sec .",
    "[ sec - normal ] we describe 2d locsitons in the case when the incident field is normal to the lattice plane .",
    "[ sec - conclusions ] summarizes main results of our paper .",
    "let us consider a 2d lattice of strongly resonant identical particles , which we will further call `` atoms '' .",
    "we will assume that , for the incident laser frequency @xmath4 near their resonant frequency @xmath5 , these atoms can be described by a two - level model with the transition dipole moment @xmath6 .",
    "in the linear case , i.e. , when the laser intensity is significantly lower than the saturation intensity , the results for the two - level model coincide exactly with those for the classical harmonic oscillator , see @xcite .",
    "we further only consider lattices of atoms interacting via quasistatic near - field dipole forces .",
    "in general , this assumption is valid if , on one hand , the minimum separation @xmath7 between atoms is not too small , so that their atomic orbitals do not overlap , and , on the other hand , the lattice is finite and its overall dimensions are smaller than the laser wavelength @xmath8 .",
    "however , in most cases , in particular within the nna , which is the most common one and used throughout this paper , the sufficient condition is much less restrictive , only requiring that the interatomic separation @xmath9 , which is the same limit as in the standard llt @xcite .",
    "the lf acting upon a given atom located at a point @xmath10 is a superposition of the incident ( `` external '' ) field @xmath11 and the sum of the fields @xmath12 from surrounding dipoles at all other lattice positions @xmath13 over the entire lattice : @xmath14 where the near fields of the surrounding atomic dipoles @xmath15 are dominated by the non - radiative ( quasi - static ) components @xcite , @xmath16 - { \\mathbf{p}}({\\mathbf{r } } ' ) }        { \\epsilon |{\\mathbf{r } } ' - { \\mathbf{r}}|^3}. \\label{eq - lf-2}\\ ] ] here @xmath17 is a unit vector along the line connecting the two atoms , @xmath3 is the background dielectric constant ( @xmath18 in vacuum and @xmath19 if a host medium is present ) .",
    "the atomic dipoles @xmath15 are , in turn , induced by the lf acting upon them . in the case of linear optical response of a two - level atom ,",
    "its induced dipole moment is @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a dimensionless laser frequency detuning and @xmath22 is the transverse relaxation time of the atom with a resonant homogeneous linewidth @xmath23 .",
    "the condition that the electron orbitals of neighboring atoms do not overlap implies that @xmath24 and justifies our use of a semiclassical approach .",
    "nonlinear effects in systems of resonant atoms could be included into this picture via the saturation nonlinearity of the two - level system .",
    "as we have recently demonstrated @xcite , the nonlinearity enables interesting effects with promising applications , like the optical bistability and hysteresis . in the present paper",

    "more details on the general lf model that we use in this paper , including some quantitative estimates of @xmath32 for realistic systems , can be found in our recent publication @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we restrict our considerations to the _ nearest - neighbor approximation _ ( nna ) , in which only interactions between the closest atoms are taken into account in eq .",
    "( [ eq - lf ] ) .",
    "as we demonstrated in @xcite , this approximation leads to qualitatively similar results compared to the full solution , that takes into account interactions between all pairs of atoms in the system .",
    "the nna allows us to derive simpler analytic expressions and undertake numerical simulations for reasonably large lattices .",
    "in this section we consider the emergence and properties of locsitons in infinite unbounded planar lattices of atoms . here",
    "we aim at studying locsitons in their `` simplest '' form , without the system boundaries complicating the picture . at the same time",
    ", we will continue to assume the near - field character of the interatomic interaction , because our ultimate goal is to study systems that are much smaller than @xmath8 . for the same reason",
    ", we will assume the incident field to be uniform throughout the lattice , @xmath33 , although our formalism is not limited to this case .",
    "as we have proven in @xcite for linear ( 1d ) systems of interacting atoms , such an approach is indeed of a great help for understanding the locsitons behavior .",
    "we consider an equilateral triangular lattice ( also known as a hexagonal lattice ) of atoms , which has a six - fold rotation symmetry and belongs to the plane symmetry group ( wallpaper group ) _",

    "each atom in the lattice has six neighbors at the distances of @xmath7 .",
    "the `` second layer '' of neighbors is removed by @xmath34 or @xmath35 ; considering the fast decrease of the dipole - dipole interaction force with the distance ( @xmath36 ) , the nna which ignores interaction with the second and further layers of neighbors is expected to work well .    as in the case of 1d arrays of atoms @xcite",
    ", two major cases can be studied separately , where the incident laser field @xmath11 lies _ in plane _ ( the `` @xmath37 '' case ) or is _ normal _ to the plane of the lattice ( the `` @xmath38 '' case ) . the linear optical response in the case of any other incident polarization",
    "can be obtained using a superposition of these two configurations .",
    "of the two major cases , the `` @xmath37 '' configuration is by far more interesting , exhibiting richer locsiton behavior and differing significantly from the 1d case due to the crucial in - plane anisotropy of the dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "it is also easier to implement , as the laser beam may be incident at the normal to the lattice of atoms , with the incident field being virtually uniform on a scale of many wavelengths .",
    "the `` @xmath38 '' configuration presents a much closer analogy to the 1d problems considered in @xcite , although some details inevitably differ .",
    "we will discuss it below in sec .",
    "[ sec - normal ] .",
    "further in this section , we only consider the `` @xmath37 '' case , where both @xmath11 and @xmath0 lie in the lattice plain",
    ".      optical response of a triangular lattice of atoms is , in general , anisotropic : it depends on the orientation of @xmath11 in the lattice plane with respect to the symmetry directions of the lattice .",
    "we have demonstrated , however , that one can use the near - ring approximation ( nra ) to describe the behavior of long - wavelength locsitons in the lattice @xcite in an isotropic fashion . in this approximation , the contribution from the surrounding dipoles to the lf @xmath0 [ the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq - lf-1 ] ) ] is substituted with a field from an effective dipole ring with the radius @xmath7 , such that the polarizability of the nearest six atoms is evenly redistributed along the ring .",
    "the nra is thus a further simplification of the nna , making the model isotropic in the lattice plane . within the nra",
