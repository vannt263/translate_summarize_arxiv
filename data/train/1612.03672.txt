    "the determination of accurate chemical abundances in planetary nebulae ( pne ) is very important , since these objects can contribute to studies regarding stellar evolution as well as the chemical evolution of galaxies .",
    "recently , new hei emissivities have become available in the literature through the work of porter et al .",
    "( 2012 ) and subsequently corrected by porter et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , hereafter pfsd13 .",
    "these are the most recent hei emissivities , and collisional effects are already included in the emissivities calculation . in this work the emissivities of pfsd13 are adopted in order to calculate the hei abundances and provide accurate hei abundances . usually , the spectral range of the observations is not sufficient to observe all the necessary lines of a given ion , and it is not possible to calculate the total abundance of a particular element by the direct sum of the ionic abundances of all the ions present in a nebula .",
    "instead , it must be calculated by means of the ionization correction factors ( icfs ) .",
    "one of most frequently used icfs in the literature are those from kingsburgh & barlow ( 1994 ) , hereafter kb94 . however , recently delgado - inglada et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , hereafter dms14 , have published new icfs formulae based on a grid of photoionization models and they have computed analytical expressions for the icfs of he , o , n , ne , s , ar , cl and c. these new icfs incorporate more recent physics and are derived using a wider range of parameters of photoionization models than the previous icfs from kb94 .",
    "another advantage of the new icfs provided by dms14 is the possibility to compute the errors in the elemental abundances introduced by the adopted icf approximation .",
    "they provide analytical formulae to estimate error bars associated with the icfs , something not possible until their work . according to dms14",
    ", the oxygen abundances are not expected to be very different from those calculated with the icfs of kb94 .",
    "on the other hand , the abundances of n , s , ar , ne calculated with the new icfs show significant differences . however , a direct comparison between the abundances of n , s , ar and ne calculated with both icfs is missing in dms14 .",
    "the aim of this work is to use these icfs and new emissivities to derive chemical abundances of a pne sample located in the galactic bulge and also near the galactic centre ( gc ) .",
    "the new emissivities and icfs were used to recalculate the elemental abundances of pne located in the galactic bulge from cavichia et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , hereafter ccm10 .",
    "we followed the same procedures described in ccm10 , nonetheless using the new emissivities from pfsd13 and icfs from dms14 .",
    "the h@xmath0 emissivities are from aver et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and heii emissivities are from osterbrock & ferland ( 2006 ) . also , in 2009 we started an observational program aimed at carrying out a spectroscopic follow - up of high - extinction gbpne located within 2 degrees of the gc from the catalogue of jacoby & van de steene ( 2004 ) .",
    "the goodman spectrograph at the 4.1 m soar telescope at cerro pachn ( chile ) was used to perform spectroscopic follow - up of 33 objects located within 2 degrees of the gc , in a region of a very high - level of reddening . from those objects ,",
    "15 had spectra with acceptable quality to derive physical parameters and chemical abundances .",
    "the optical spectra of the gbpne near the gc suffer for high - level of extinction caused by the material near the galactic plane and also in the central regions of the galaxy . as a result , important diagnostic lines as [ oiii ]",
    "@xmath14363   and [ nii ] @xmath15755   do not have enough s / n ratio to obtain the electron temperature from the temperature diagnostic diagrams .",
    "other important temperature - sensitive lines are those from s@xmath2 . in order to observe the nir [ siii ] lines",
    ", we started an observational program in 2012 at the observatrio pico dos dias ( opd ) of national laboratory for astrophysics ( lna , brazil ) with the 1.6 m perkin - elmer telescope and a cassegrain boller & chivens spectrograph was used .",
    "the details of the observations , data reduction , abundances determinations and results can be seen in cavichia et al .",

    "will be used to analyze the differences in the icfs .",

    "most of the abundances are compatible , however for a few objects the n abundance is higher than the one obtained by using the previous icf .",
