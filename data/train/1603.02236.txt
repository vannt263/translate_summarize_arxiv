    "the first approach based on the application of the quantum theory to describe the universe was presented in the later 1960s by wheeler @xcite and dewitt @xcite . at that time",
    ", they proposed a quantum gravity equation to describe the wave function of the universe and its evolution , which is known as the wheeler - dewitt ( wdw ) equation @xcite .",
    "this equation is analogous to a zero - energy schrdinger equation of which the hamiltonian could contain the gravitational field as well as nongravitational fields , as for example , scalar fields . if these fields are present in the hamiltonian , the dynamical variables are the scale factor and the scalar field as well as their respective conjugate momenta .    in the case in which only the gravitational field is present , the solutions of the wdw equation defined in the minisuperspace depend just on a unique parameter , namely , the scale factor , and thus the properties of the wave functions",
    "will be characterized exclusively on this parameter .",
    "it is worth calling attention to the fact that the wdw equation leads us to stationary wave functions , due to the fact that it does not contain any classical parameter which can be identified with this quantity .    from that time up to now",
    ", this equation has inspired a lot of investigations in quantum cosmology @xcite , in which context the evolution of the universe is determined by the quantum states which obey the wdw equation @xcite , in such a way that in the appropriate classical limit the friedmann solutions are recovered . along this line of research , some results using different approaches have been obtained @xcite .",
    "especially , we emphasize the line of research which uses the wdw equation as a fundamental tool to formulate the so - called loop quantum gravity @xcite .    in spite of all problems present in the original formulation of the wdw equation , such as the breaking of relativistic covariance , the absence of a time variable , and others @xcite , nowadays",
    ", it is considered a fundamental tool to elaborate some models to explain the quantum properties of the gravitational phenomena , taking together quantum mechanics and general relativity @xcite and for this reason the work on quantum cosmology based on the wdw equation is going on .    the wdw equation does not provide the best way to describe the quantum gravity scenario , but it has opened up a route to describe a theory of quantum gravity and for this reason constitutes a powerful conceptual element to construct a theory in which the quantum dynamics of the gravitational phenomena can be explained consistently @xcite .",
    "thus , it is certainly important to find solutions of this equation and use these to learn about the possibility to construct a consistent theory that takes into account the quantum features of our universe .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , the wdw equation is presented . in sec .",
    "iii , we obtain its solution for a universe filled with matter . sections iv and v present the solution for the three possible geometries and a universe filled out with radiation and vacuum energy , respectively . in sec .",
    "vi , the conclusions are presented .",
    "the wdw equation was derived originally in the minisuperspace approximation for closed and empty universes @xcite .",
    "but it is important to consider different geometries as well as the possibility to have a presence of matter and radiation @xcite and others forms of energy .",
    "let us assume that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic and therefore can be described using the minisuperspace model @xcite with one fundamental parameter , the scale factor @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) of the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe .    in the case of the frw universe",

    ", we get the following result : @xmath6 the classical evolution of the universe at different stages can be obtained by solving this equation , which can be used to conclude that the hamiltonian @xmath7 , written in terms of the momentum , @xmath8 , @xmath9 \\equiv 0\\ , \\label{eq : hamiltonian_wdw}\\ ] ] is identically zero .",
    "now , in order to obtain the wdw equation in the minisuperspace approximation , we make the replacement @xmath10 and impose that @xmath11 .",
    "thus , we get the wdw equation in a suitable minisuperspace by substituting the dynamical variable and its conjugate by corresponding operators .",

    "on the other hand , for arbitrary values of @xmath0 , the potential is not so simple , and as a consequence , the solutions of the wdw equation are more complicated and given in terms of heun functions @xcite as we will show in the next sections , in which we will obtain the analytical solutions of eq .",
