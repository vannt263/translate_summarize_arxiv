    "the determination of the nucleon s polarized gluon density is a major goal of current experiments with longitudinally polarized protons at rhic  @xcite .",
    "it can be accessed through measurement of the spin asymmetries @xmath4 for high transverse momentum ( @xmath3 ) reactions such as @xmath5 , jet@xmath6 , @xmath7 . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : asydef ] ) , @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) denotes the cross section for scattering of two protons with same ( opposite ) helicities .",
    "high @xmath3 implies large momentum transfer , and the cross sections for such reactions may be factorized into long - distance pieces that contain the desired information on the ( spin ) structure of the nucleon , and short - distance parts that describe the hard interactions of the partons and are amenable to qcd perturbation theory ( pqcd ) .",
    "all of the reactions listed above have partonic born cross sections involving gluons in the initial state and may therefore serve to examine the gluon content of the scattering longitudinally polarized protons .    in this paper , we will consider the spin asymmetry @xmath0 for high-@xmath3 @xmath1 production , for which very recently the collaboration has presented first preliminary data  @xcite at center - of - mass ( c.m.s . )",
    "energy @xmath10  gev and central rapidity .",
    "the data are consistent with a sizable ( up to a few per cent ) negative @xmath0 in the region @xmath11  gev . even though the experimental uncertainties are still large and leave room for a different behavior of @xmath0 , the new data motivate us to entertain the unexpected possibility of @xmath0 being negative .",
    "to our knowledge , there have been no predictions of a substantially negative @xmath0 in the literature .",
    "this is in itself interesting , also because at moderate @xmath12 the spin asymmetry @xmath0 is expected to be particularly sensitive to gluon polarization .",
    "we may write the polarized high-@xmath12 cross section as @xmath13 & \\times & \\frac{\\d\\delta \\hat{\\sigma}_{ab}^{c } ( p_\\perp , \\eta , x_a , x_b , z_c , \\mu ) } { \\d p_\\perp \\d \\eta}\\ , d_c^{\\pi}(z_c,\\mu ) \\",

    "the @xmath15 are the polarized parton densities ; for instance , @xmath16 ( the sign referring to the gluon helicity in a proton of positive helicity ) is the polarized gluon distribution .",
    "the sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq : crosec ] ) is over all partonic channels @xmath17 , with their associated polarized cross sections @xmath18 .",
    "these start at @xmath19 in the strong coupling with the qcd tree - level scatterings : ( i )  @xmath20 , ( ii )  @xmath21 , ( iii )  @xmath22 , ( iv )  @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "the transition of parton @xmath28 into the observed @xmath1 is described by the ( spin - independent ) fragmentation function @xmath29 .",
    "the functions in eq .",
    "( [ eq : crosec ] ) are tied together by their dependence on the factorization / renormalization scale @xmath30 which is of the order of the hard scale @xmath12 , but not further specified .",
    "all next - to - leading order [ nlo , @xmath31 qcd contributions to polarized parton scattering are known @xcite .",
    "corrections to eq .",
    "( [ eq : crosec ] ) itself are down by inverse powers of @xmath12 and are thus expected to become relevant if @xmath12 is not much bigger than typical hadronic mass scales .",
    "we neglect such contributions for now , but will briefly return to them later .    to set the stage for our further considerations , fig .",
    "[ fig : all ] shows nlo predictions for @xmath0 , for various gluon polarizations @xmath32 , all proposed within the framework of the analysis of data from polarized deeply - inelastic scattering ( dis ) in  @xcite . despite the fact that the @xmath32 s used in fig .",
    "[ fig : all ] are all very different from one another , none of the resulting @xmath0 is negative in the @xmath3 region we display .",
    "as a first step in our more detailed analysis of @xmath0 we discuss the various ingredients to eq .",
    "( [ eq : crosec ] ) , other than the unknown @xmath32 that one hopes to probe : the @xmath33 and @xmath34 distributions , the calculated partonic cross sections , and the fragmentation functions @xmath29 .",
    "they all jointly determine the analyzing power for @xmath32 provided by @xmath0 .    to a first approximation , the @xmath33 , @xmath34",
    "may be treated as `` known '' .",
    "@xmath35 has been probed extensively in polarized dis .",
    "there certainly remains much room for improvement in our knowledge about them , but this does not affect @xmath0 too strongly . to give one example : for @xmath1 production the @xmath36 channel depends on the sum @xmath37 , so that uncertainties relating to the su(2 ) flavor structure of the polarized sea are not relevant .",
    "we now turn to the partonic cross sections and fragmentation functions .",
    "we focus on the lowest order ( lo ) which is expected to capture the qualitatively important points . among the reactions ( i)-(iii ) listed above",
    "that have gluons in the initial state , process ( ii ) has a negative _ partonic _ spin asymmetry @xmath38 , while ( i ) and ( iii ) both have @xmath39  @xcite . also , for the @xmath3 region of interest , one has an average @xmath40 , where quarks are more favored than gluons to fragment into pions .",
    "a first guess is , then , to attribute a negative @xmath0 to the negative @xmath41 cross section .",
    "however , this expectation is refuted by the numerical hierarchy in the partonic cross sections : at @xmath42 in the partonic c.m.s . , which is most relevant for the data , channel ( i ) is ( in absolute magnitude ) larger than ( ii ) by a factor of about 160 .",
    "therefore , if one wanted to suppress the ( positive ) @xmath43 contribution , one would effectively have to switch off the gluon - to - pion fragmentation function @xmath44 . even though our knowledge of @xmath44 is incomplete",
    ", this does not appear to be a sensible solution , for two reasons .",
    "first , data from @xmath45 collisions , in particular analyses of hadron production in @xmath46 plus ( mostly gluon ) jet final states @xcite , do constrain @xmath44 significantly , even at fairly large @xmath47 .",
    "for example , the @xmath44 s in the sets of  @xcite and  @xcite are in reasonable agreement with these data , with the one of  @xcite arguably setting a lower bound on @xmath44 .",
    "second , elimination of the @xmath43 channel would also strongly affect the unpolarized cross section and reduce it by up to an order of magnitude at rhic energies .",
    "however , previous measurements @xcite of the unpolarized cross section for @xmath48 at @xmath49 were found to be in excellent agreement with nlo calculations employing the @xmath29 of  @xcite .",
    "we therefore exclude that the @xmath41 channel is instrumental in making @xmath0 negative , and we thus have to investigate possibilities within @xmath32 itself , and its involvement in @xmath43 and @xmath50 scattering .",
    "given that the polarized scattering cross sections for these reactions are both positive , and that the first process comes roughly with the square of @xmath32 , it is immediately clear that a sizable negative asymmetry will not be easily obtained .",
    "in the next section , we will demonstrate this for the particularly instructive case of rapidity integrated cross sections .",
    "we consider the lo cross section integrated over all rapidities @xmath14 .",
    "this is not immediately relevant for comparison to experiment , but it does capture the main point we want to make . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : crosec ] ) , one obtains : @xmath52 where @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",
    "it is then convenient to take mellin moments in @xmath55 of the cross section , @xmath56 one obtains ( we suppress the scale @xmath30 from now on ) : @xmath57 where the @xmath58 are the @xmath59-moments of the partonic cross sections and , as usual , @xmath60 for the parton distribution and fragmentation functions .",
    "we now rewrite eq .",
    "( [ crosec2 ] ) in a form that makes the dependence on the moments @xmath61 explicit : @xmath62 here , @xmath63 represents the contributions from @xmath43 and @xmath41 , @xmath64 the ones from @xmath50 , and @xmath65 those from the ( anti)quark scatterings ( iv ) above ; in each case , the appropriate combinations of @xmath33 , @xmath34 distributions and fragmentation functions are included .    being a quadratic form in @xmath66 , @xmath67 possesses an extremum , given by the condition @xmath68 we note in passing that the same equation may also be derived directly from eq .",
    "( [ crosec1 ] ) by regarding the cross section as a functional of @xmath32 , using a variational approach , and taking mellin moments of the resulting stationarity condition . in the following we neglect the contribution from the @xmath41 channel which",
    ", as we discussed above , is much smaller than that from @xmath43 for the @xmath3 we are interested in .",
    "the coefficient @xmath63 is then positive , and eq .",
    "( [ dgmin ] ) describes a minimum of @xmath67 , with value @xmath69 it is then straightforward to perform a numerical mellin inversion of this minimal cross section : @xmath70 where @xmath71 denotes a suitable contour in complex-@xmath72 space .    for the numerical evaluation we use the lo @xmath33 , @xmath34 of grsv  @xcite , the @xmath29 of  @xcite , and a fixed scale @xmath73  gev .",
    "we find that the minimal asymmetry resulting from this exercise is negative indeed , but very small : in the range @xmath11  gev its absolute value does not exceed @xmath74 .",
    "the @xmath32 in eq .",
    "( [ dgmin ] ) that minimizes the asymmetry is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dg ] , compared to @xmath32 of the grsv lo `` standard '' set @xcite .",
    "one can see that it has a node and is generally much smaller than the grsv one , except at large @xmath75 .",
    "the node makes it possible to probe the two gluon densities in the @xmath76 term at values of @xmath77 , @xmath78 where they have different sign , which helps in decreasing @xmath0 .    even though we have made some approximations in deriving the bound in eq .",
    "( [ inverse ] ) , we do believe that it exhibits the basic difficulty with a sizable negative @xmath0 at moderate @xmath12 : the fact that the cross section is a quadratic form in @xmath32 effectively means that it is bounded from below .",
    "note that this bound does not _",
    "always _ imply that a negative @xmath0 is small : at higher @xmath3 it does allow a fairly large @xmath0 .    in its details",
    ", the qualitative picture drawn by our study is of course subject to a number of corrections .",
    "first of all , we have integrated the cross section over all rapidities , whereas for the data @xmath79 .",
    "it is instructive to investigate the qualitative differences associated with this .",
    "figure  [ fig : x1x2 ] shows the polarized lo cross section at @xmath80  gev versus the `` distance '' @xmath81 in parton momentum fractions in eq .",
    "( [ eq : crosec ] ) , for integration over all @xmath14 and for @xmath82 . here",
    "we have used the grsv polarized parton densities .",
    "the larger the rapidity range probed , the more likely become collisions of partons with rather different momentum fractions .",
    "indeed , the distribution for @xmath82 is steeper , implying that a node in @xmath83 will now be somewhat less efficient in promoting negative values for the asymmetry .    in a more realistic calculation",
    "one would also prefer @xmath84 to a fixed @xmath30 .",
    "furthermore , since the @xmath33 and @xmath34 are coupled to @xmath32 via evolution , any change of @xmath32 will require a re - tuning of the @xmath33 , @xmath34 densities , so that the agreement with the polarized dis data remains intact .",
    "inclusion of the nlo corrections is important as well .",
    "all these points can be thoroughly addressed only in a `` global '' nlo analysis of the data , taking into account the results from polarized dis as well .",
    "we will now report on such an analysis .",
    "given that the data are still preliminary , this may seem premature .",
    "our primary goal , however , is to investigate whether the findings of our somewhat idealized case , as summarized by eqs .",
    "( [ crsecmin ] ) and ( [ inverse ] ) , hold true in general .",
    "the main technical difficulty in a full global nlo analysis of polarized dis and @xmath85 data is the numerical complexity of the evaluation of the nlo corrections for the latter cross section . a convenient way to alleviate this problem",
    "was presented in @xcite .",
    "starting from eq .",
    "( [ eq : crosec ] ) , one expresses the @xmath86 , @xmath87 by their mellin inverses , e.g. , @xmath88 after interchange of integrations one obtains @xmath89 & \\times & \\rho_{ab}^{\\pi } ( n ,",
    "m , p_\\perp , \\eta , \\mu)\\ ; , \\label{eq8}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath90 contain the partonic cross sections , the fragmentation functions , and all integrations over momentum fractions , with the factors @xmath91 and @xmath92 as complex `` dummy '' parton distributions according to eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) .",
    "the strength of this approach is that there is no dependence of @xmath90 on the moments @xmath93 , @xmath94 of the true parton densities .",
    "this means that the @xmath90 can be pre - calculated _ prior _ to the analysis on a specific array of the two mellin variables @xmath72 and @xmath95 .",
    "one chooses a convenient functional form for the parton distributions , depending on a set of free parameters .",
    "the latter are then determined from a @xmath96 minimization procedure .",
    "the double inverse mellin transformation which finally links the parton distributions with the pre - calculated @xmath90 of course still needs to be performed in each step of the fitting procedure , but becomes extremely fast by choosing the values for @xmath97 on the contours @xmath98 , @xmath99 simply as the supports for a gaussian integration .    following these lines ,",
    "we have performed a simultaneous analysis of all data from polarized dis and of the preliminary data for @xmath85 .",
    "we have used several different functional forms for the polarized gluon density , in particular allowing it to have a node .",
    "the quark densities were allowed to vary as well .",
    "we have artificially decreased the error bars of the data points for @xmath0 in order to see whether the fit can be forced to reproduce a negative @xmath0 of about @xmath100 in the region @xmath2 .",
    "we have also slightly shifted individual data points to study the response of the fit . in no case",
    "have we been able to find a fit that yielded a negative @xmath0 with absolute value larger than a few times @xmath74 .",
    "even those fits , however , gave a negative @xmath0 only at the higher end of the @xmath12 interval , and invariably they led to a polarized gluon density that had a node and tended to violate positivity @xmath101 in certain ranges of @xmath75 .",
    "the `` global '' analysis thus confirms our qualitative finding above that any negative @xmath0 is also very small .",
    "our analysis demonstrates that pqcd at _ leading power _ in @xmath3 predicts that @xmath0 is bounded from below by @xmath102 in the region @xmath103 .",
    "the observation relies on collinear factorization and on exploring the physically acceptable ranges of parton distribution and fragmentation functions .    for now ,",
    "the data @xcite do not allow a compelling conclusion on whether the bound is violated or not . what should one conclude if future , more precise , data will indeed confirm a sizable negative @xmath0 ?",
    "as indicated earlier , corrections to eq .",
    "( [ eq : crosec ] ) are associated with power - suppressed contributions to the cross section .",
    "since @xmath12 is not too large , such contributions might well be significant .",
    "on the other hand , comparisons of unpolarized @xmath1 spectra measured at colliders with nlo qcd calculations do not exhibit any compelling trace of non - leading power effects even down to fairly low @xmath104 , within the uncertainties of the calculation .",
    "it is conceivable that the spin - dependent cross section with its fairly tedious cancelations has larger power - suppressed contributions than the unpolarized one .",
    "one may attempt to model the effects by implementing an `` intrinsic '' transverse - momentum ( @xmath105 ) smearing for the initial partons which generically leads to corrections by powers of @xmath106 , with @xmath107 an average @xmath105 .",
    "such effects were shown to have indeed some potential impact on @xmath0 at @xmath108  gev  @xcite .",
    "a negative @xmath0 would open up a quite unexpected window on aspects of nucleon structure and limitations of pqcd so far little explored .",
