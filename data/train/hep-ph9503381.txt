    "our objective in this paper is to derive a new evolution equation describing the behavior of large partonic densities .",
    "the fact that parton densities increase as the bjorken scaling variable @xmath0 decreases follows directly from linear evolutions equations such as the glap @xcite or bfkl @xcite equation , and has been experimentally observed by both hera collaborations @xcite .",
    "they observe a powerlike behavior of the deep inelastic structure function [ one ] f_2 ( x_b , q^2 ) ~x^- _ 0_b , with @xmath7 .",
    "this behavior is predicted by the bfkl equation and is not inconsistent with the glap equation .",
    "( such powerlike growth at small @xmath8 can be imitated by a solution of the glap equation with a distribution that is constant in @xmath8 at a low initial scale @xmath9 . )    from a physical point of view such behavior is inconsistent with unitarity .",
    "this fact necessitates a change in the evolution equation in the region of small @xmath0 .",
    "the first attempt , more than ten years old , to write down a new equation led to the nonlinear glr equation @xcite . see @xcite for a more extensive review .",
    "we will explain in this paper that the glr equation only includes two - gluon correlations in the parton cascade .",
    "multigluon correlations should be essential to solving the small @xmath0 problem , at least theoretically @xcite .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to take such correlations into account .    in section 2",
    "we derive and explain the limitations of the glr equation .",
    "we consider multigluon correlations in section 3 by employing the relation between these correlations and high twist contributions to the deep - inelastic structure function . in section 4",
    "we suggest the evolution equation which takes these correlations into account . some particular solutions and a comparison with the glr equation",
    "are discussed in section 5 , while we discuss the general solution of the new evolution equation in section 6 .",
    "we summarize and conclude in section 7 .",
    "in the region of small @xmath0 and large @xmath10 we face a system of partons at mutually small distances ( thus the qcd coupling @xmath1 is still small ) , but dense enough that the usual perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) methods can not be applied .",
    "the physics that governs this region is nonperturbative , but of a different nature than the one associated with large distances .",
    "the latter corresponds to the confinement region , and is usually analyzed using lattice field theory or qcd sum rules .",
    "in contrast , we encounter here a situation where new methods must be devised to analyze such a dense relativistic system of partons in a non - equilibrium state .",
    "we need , in fact , new quantum statistical methods to describe the behavior of such a system and to chart this unknown region .",
    "we are unfortunately only at the beginning of this exploration .    on the upside , we can approach this kinematical region in theory from the pqcd region , and assume that in a transition region between pqcd and high density qcd ( hdqcd ) we can study such a dense system in some detail . to illustrate what new physics one might anticipate in this transition region",
    "let us look at deep - inelastic scattering and compare with the pqcd results for this process .",
    "we can expect the following phenomena in the transition region :    \\(i ) as @xmath0 decreases the total cross section @xmath11 grows and , near the border with the hdqcd domain , becomes even comparable with the geometrical size of the nucleon @xmath12 . here",
    "the cross section should be a smooth function of @xmath13 .",
    "\\(ii ) although the parton language can be used to discuss the main properties of the process , interactions between partons become important , especially the annihilation process .",
    "this interaction induces screening ( a.k.a .",
    "shadowing ) corrections .",
    "\\(iii ) in this particular kinematical region such screening corrections are fortunately under theoretical control .",
    "they modify however the pqcd linear evolution equation .",
    "the correct evolution equation now becomes nonlinear .",
    "first some nomenclature . in this paper we will only deal with the gluon density in the nucleon , @xmath14 , which can be measured fairly directly at small @xmath0 in e.g experiments on diffraction dissociation or heavy quark production in deeply inelastic processes or even directly from the deep - inelastic structure function @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "we will thus also refer to it as the gluon structure function .    we will now give a simple derivation of this nonlinear equation , based on physical concepts .",
    "as we stated , the main new processes that we must consider at high density are parton - parton interactions . to incorporate these in our physical descriptions we must identify a new small parameter that controls the accuracy of calculations involving these interactions .",
    "such a parameter is [ w ] w= , where @xmath16 is the gluon density in the transverse plane = . here",
    "@xmath17 characterizes the area of a hadron which the gluons populate . it is the correlation length of gluons inside a hadron .",
    "naturally , this radius must be smaller than the radius of a hadron ( proton ) .",
    "since this paper is mostly devoted to the discussion of purely theoretical questions we will not specify further the value of @xmath17 .",
    "however it should be stressed that @xmath17 is nonperturbative in nature : all physics that occurs at distance scales larger than @xmath17 is nonperturbative .",
    "the first factor in ( [ w ] ) is the cross section for gluon absorption by a parton in the hadron .",
    "hence @xmath18 has the simple physical meaning of being the probability of parton ( mainly gluon ) recombination in the parton cascade .",
    "the unitarity constraint mentioned in the introduction can be represented as @xcite w1 .",
    "thus @xmath18 is indeed the small parameter sought .",
    "the parton cascade can be expressed as a perturbation expansion in this parameter .",
    "this perturbative series can in fact be resummed @xcite and the result understood by considering the structure of the qcd cascade in a fast hadron .",
    "there are two elementary processes in the cascade that impact on the number of partons .",
    "( 12 ) ; probability _ s ; @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the size of the parton produced in the annihilation process . in the case of deep - inelastic scatterinq @xmath21 .    when @xmath0 is not too small only the splitting of one parton into two counts because @xmath16 is small .",
    "however as @xmath22 annihilation comes into play as @xmath16 increases .",
    "this simple picture allows us to write an equation for the change in the parton density in a ` phase space ' cell of volume @xmath23 : [ evphys ] = -^2 , where @xmath24 is the number of colors . in terms of the gluon structure function [ glr ] = x_b g ( x_b , q^2 ) - ( x_b g ( x_b , q^2 ) ) ^2",
    "this is the so - called glr equation @xcite . to determine the value of @xmath25 and",
    "the understand the kinematical range of validity of ( [ glr ] ) this simple physical description does not suffice ; rather one must analyze the process carefully in @xmath18-perturbation theory @xcite @xcite .",
    "the result for @xmath25 was found to be @xcite @xmath26 we would like to emphasize that the main assumption in the above derivation was that [ rhosq ] p^(2 ) ~^2 , where @xmath27 denotes the probability for two gluons in the parton cascade to have the same fraction of energy @xmath8 and tranverse momentum ( characterized by @xmath28 ) .    by assuming ( [ rhosq ] ) we neglect all correlations between the two gluons other than the fact that they are distributed in the hadron disc of radius @xmath17 . in the large @xmath0 region",
    "this assumption is plausible because the correlations are power suppressed , and the densities involved are small . in the small @xmath0 region we can not justify ( [ rhosq ] ) , even when it holds for large @xmath0 .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that the problem is oversimplified when one assumes that the probability of annihilation is simply proportional to @xmath29 in deriving the glr equation .",
    "it was found that e^ , where @xmath9 is the initial virtuality in the parton cascade .",
    "this ratio increases with decreasing @xmath0 .",
    "consequently we must take dynamical correlations into account , which could change the glr equation crucially .",
    "the key to the calculation of parton correlations was suggested by ellis , furmanski and petronzio in @xcite , and was developed further in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that gluonic correlations are directly related to higher twist contributions in the wilson operator product expansion ( ope ) arising from so called quasi partonic operators . according to the ope",
    ", the gluon structure function can be written as [ htser ] x_b g ( x_b , q^2 ) & = x_b g^(1 ) ( x_b ,",
    "q^2)+ x^2_b g^(2)(x_b.q^2 ) + & ... + ...",
    "x^n_b g^(n ) ( x_b , q^2 ) ... where the @xmath30th term results from the twist @xmath31 quasi - partonic operator .",
    "the probability density @xmath32 to find @xmath30 gluons in the cascade with the same @xmath8 and @xmath10 can be directly expressed through the @xmath30th term in the above expansion ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "we recently determined the anomalous dimensions @xmath34 of these high twist operators @xcite to next - to - leading order in the number of colors @xmath24 .",
    "this was done by reducing the complicated problem of gluon - gluon interactions to rescattering of colorless gluon ` ladders ' ( pomerons ) in the @xmath35-channel . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that this approach works for the case of the anomalous dimension of the twist 4 operator .",
    "the fact that there is no pomeron ` creation ' or ` absorption ' in the @xmath35-channel means that we are dealing with a quantum mechanical problem ( not a field theoretical one ) in the calculation of the @xmath34 anomalous dimension .",
    "the problem then amounts to calculating the ground state energy of an @xmath30-particle system with an attractive interaction given by a four - particle contact term ( see fig.1 ) of strength @xmath36 .",
    "its value can be calculated to be = 4 , where @xmath37 if one only takes color singlet ladders into account .",
    "including the other color states renormalizes @xmath38 to @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "this effective theory is two - dimensional ( the two dimensions corresponding to @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) and is known as the nonlinear schrodinger equation .",
    "it is well known that this model is exactly solvable .",
    "translating the ground state energy of this model into the value of the anomalous dimension led to @xcite [ andim ] _",
    "2n = 1 + ( n^2 - 1 ) , where @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 being the mellin - conjugate variable to @xmath0 [ mellin ] f(n ) = _ 0 ^ 1 dx_b x_b^n-1f(x_b ) f ( ) = _ 0^dy e^-y[x_bf(x_b ) ] , where @xmath45 is an arbitrary function and @xmath46 .    the answer ( [ andim ] ) is only reliable when @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "thus to check selfconsistency we must first generalize the glr equation based on ( [ andim ] ) and understand what value of @xmath30 is important for the deep - inelastic structure function .",
    "if the answer is inconsistent with the condition @xmath47 we must try and find the expression for the anomalous dimension valid for any @xmath30 .",
    "let us note that if we neglect the term proportional @xmath48 in ( [ andim ] ) we can estimate @xmath49 via the inverse mellin transform [ eik ] x^n_b g^(n)(x_b , q^2)=_c de^(y + _ 2n ( ) r ) m^(n ) ( , q^2=q^2_0 ) , where @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath9 being the initial virtuality in the parton cascade .",
    "the contour is to the right of all singularities in m as well as to the right of the saddle point ( @xmath52 ) which is given by [ saddle ] \\{y+_2nr}|_= _ s=0 .",
    "thus in the saddle point approximation for @xmath53 x^n_b g^(n)(x_b , q^2 ) ~ [ x_b g ( x_b , q^2)]^n , in particular @xmath54 .",
    "we also assume here the factorization of the matrix element @xmath55 ; this expresses the physical assumption that there are no correlations between gluons other than the fact that they are distributed in a disc of radius @xmath17 .",
    "we will comment more about this assumption further on . in this sense",
    "the glr equation is only the lowest order approximation in @xmath48 even if we assume the factorization of the matrix element and thus , strictly speaking , is valid only in the limit of a large number of colors .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath48 in ( [ andim ] ) is clearly responsible for induced gluon correlations and we take it seriously in this paper . in next section we will therefore generalize the glr equation .",
    "the first step in such a generalization is to make an _ ansatz _ for @xmath32 using the same approach as for the glr equation , viz . the competition of two processes in the parton cascade .",
    "thus , in analogy to the derivation of ( [ evphys ] ) we write [ genglr ] = c_2n p^(n)(x_b , q^2)-np^(n + 1)(x_b , q^2 ) , where @xmath56 .",
    "the factor @xmath30 in front of the second term on the right hand side of ( [ genglr ] ) reflects the fact that in the born approximation @xmath57 gluons annihilate in @xmath30 gluons through the subprocess @xmath58 , which corresponds to the @xmath59 transition with the strength of the triple ladder vertex @xmath25 .",
    "there are @xmath30 such possibilities due to the time ordering of gluon emission .",
    "note that the infinitely recursive set of equations can be cut off at any level by imposing e.g. @xmath60 .",
    "the glr equation is the case @xmath61 .",
    "since we operate under the assumption that high twists are essential for small enough @xmath0 we must however consider the whole series in ( [ htser ] ) , which we now do using eqs .",
    "( [ genglr ] ) .",
    "let us introduce the generating function [ gexp ] g(x_b , q^2 , ) = ^ _ n = 1 e^n g^(n ) , where @xmath62 . comparing with ( [ htser ] ) we see that for the full structure function [ g ] x_b g(x_b , q^2 ) = q^2 r_n^2 g ( x_b , q^2 , = - ( q^2 r_n^2 ) ) .",
    "the recursive set of equations ( [ genglr ] ) can be summarized in one equation for @xmath63 : [ genglrpar ] = |_s + ( - ) - _",
    "s^2 e^- ( q^2 r_n^2 ) e^ - ( -g ) .",
    "to solve this linear , 4th order partial differential equation in three variables , we must impose some boundary and initial conditions , on the @xmath10 and @xmath0 behavior respectively .",
    "the boundary condition is straightforward , ( ) ; g ( x_b , q^2 , ) e^ g_lla ( x_b , q^2 ) , where @xmath64 is the solution of the standard glap evolution equation for the leading twist gluon density in leading @xmath13 approximation .",
    "the initial condition is much more difficult , because we need @xmath65 for solving ( [ genglrpar ] ) , whereas experimentally we can only measure the structure function , which is at fixed @xmath66 . in other words ,",
    "we need detailed information on the gluon distribution in a hadron at large @xmath0 .",
    "we can make the following suggestion ( although others are possible ) [ efor ] g ( x_b^0,q^2,)= @xmath67^n \\,=\\ , 1- \\exp ( - e^{\\eta } g_{lla } ( x_b^0,q^2)\\,).\\ ] ] this can be recognized as the usual eikonal approximation for the virtual gluon - hadron interaction @xcite .",
    "the virtues of this expression lie in the fact that it is simple , and that it has the transparent physical meaning of reflecting the assumption that there are no correlations between gluons with @xmath68 other than that they are distributed in a hadron disc of radius @xmath17 .",
    "if one replaces the hadron with a nucleus , one can prove such an approach , which corresponds to the so - called glauber theory of shadowing corrections .",
    "in the deep - inelastic scattering case an expression of this type was discussed by a. mueller in @xcite .    to summarize this section ,",
    "we have proposed a new evolution equation which has two new features over and above the glr equation :    \\(i ) it includes induced multigluon correlations .",
    "\\(ii ) it allows an arbitrary initial condition not necessarily an eikonal one , unlike the case of the glr equation .",
    "we recall that the glr equation has been proven only under the assumption of the factorization property of the matrix elements , which corresponds to an eikonal initial condition @xcite . by including all twists in our evolution equation we overcome the need for a reductive initial condition , such as ( [ efor ] ) .",
    "one could e.g. try to solve ( [ genglrpar ] ) using an initial condition with correlated gluons at large @xmath8 and study the consequences of its evolution , with or without @xmath38 . because such initial correlations must be very small , and because our main interest lies in comparing with the glr equation , we do not pursue this line of inquiry here .",
    "in the next section we will discuss the general solution to . here",
    "we will give approximate solutions for various special cases .",
    "in particular we try to answer the following questions : how does the nonlinear glr equation follow from our present linear equation ; what value of @xmath30 is typically relevant in the sum ( [ gexp ] ) and how do the corrections to the ordinary glap evolution due to ( [ genglr ] ) differ from those due to the glr equation ?",
    "the first question that arises is how the nonlinear glr equation is contained in the linear equation ( [ genglr ] ) if we neglect the term proportional to @xmath48 .",
    "specifically , we would like to establish the equivalence of [ simpleex ] = |_s -_s^2e^- ( q^2 r_n^2 ) e^ - ( -g ) , to the nonlinear glr equation .",
    "let us parametrize the solution in the form g ( x_b , q^2,)= ( e^ f(y =- x_b , r = ( q^2 r_n^2 ) ) ) .",
    "because we dropped the gluon - correlation term from ( [ genglr ] ) we can impose the ` no - correlation ' initial condition at @xmath69 .",
    "this is the only initial condition the glr equation allows @xcite . in the set of `` fan '' diagrams ( fig.3 ) that the glr equation sums the initial distribution has the form [ fanin ] g(x_b^0,q^2,)=^_n = 1 e^n ( - 1 ) ^n ^n , which gives [ fifun ] ( t ) = .",
    "the absence of the @xmath70 in the above equation compared with ( [ efor ] ) is explained as follows .",
    "the @xmath70 in ( [ efor ] ) enforces the correct time ordering of the produced partons in the parton cascade , related to diagrams of production of @xmath30 parton shadows ( see fig.4 which shows a case in which three parton shadows are produced ) . in the fan diagram of fig.3",
    "we do not have to enforce the correct time ordering because it is already included via the vertex @xmath25 .",
    "was calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite using the agk cutting rules @xcite , which are equivalent to time - ordering . ]",
    "thus the initial condition of just corresponds to the sum of  fan \" diagrams , of which fig.3 is the lowest order example , with the assumption that there are no correlations between gluons inside the proton .",
    "we will see in section 6 that the main properties of the full solution of do not depend on the form of the initial condition .",
    "the reduction to the glr equation does however .    with ( [ fifun ] )",
    "it is now straightforward to check that reduces to the glr equation to first order in @xmath71 ( recall that finally we must put @xmath72 ) , with @xmath73 .",
    "here we try to follow the recipe mentioned below eq .",
    "( [ mellin ] ) : to see if our approach is consistent we must determine what values of @xmath30 are relevant in the solution to ( [ genglrpar ] ) .",
    "should those values not be consistent with @xmath47 then we must generalize the expression ( [ andim ] ) for @xmath34 such that it is valid for all @xmath30 .",
    "if they are consistent we can maintain ( [ andim ] ) and thus ( [ genglrpar ] ) .    however , to determine the relevant @xmath30 s we need the general solution to eq .",
    "( [ genglrpar ] ) , which is presented in section 6 . here",
    "we will perform some rough estimates .",
    "let us first take a ` worst case ' scenario by letting the term proportional to @xmath48 dominate , and by dropping the first term and last term on the rhs of ( [ genglrpar ] ) : @xmath74 to solve this equation we perform a laplace transform in the variable @xmath66 g(x_b , q^2,p ) _ -^0 d e^p g(x_b , q^2 , ) .",
    "then [ lapdelta ] = p^2(p^2 - 1)g ( y , r , p ) , where @xmath75 . the solution to ( [ lapdelta ] ) is the bessel function @xmath76 .",
    "the most general solution is then [ solu ] g ( y , r,)=_c e^- p ( p ) i_0 ( 2 ) , where the contour @xmath77 runs to the right of all singularities in @xmath78 .",
    "the function @xmath79 is fixed by imposing an initial condition ( e.g. ( [ efor ] ) ) g",
    "( 0,r , ) = _ c dp e^-p ( p ) .",
    "one may write the solution in fact directly in terms of the initial condition : [ sltn ] g ( y , r,)= ^0_- d ",

    "( - ) i_0 ( 2 ) . from eq .",
    "( [ gexp ] ) we see that large typical @xmath30 corresponds to small typical @xmath66 , which in turn by ( [ solu ] ) corresponds to large typical @xmath78 ( `` @xmath80 '' ) .",
    "thus we must find @xmath81 to trust eq .",
    "( [ andim ] ) .",
    "let us investigate ( [ sltn ] ) to find the most relevant values of @xmath82 .",
    "the function @xmath83 falls down monotonously for @xmath84 ( the first term in ( [ gexp ] ) dominates ) where it behaves as @xmath85 .",
    "next , we can show that the function @xmath86 has a maximum at @xmath87 whose width is of the order of @xmath88 . to see this , evaluate ( [ greenfun ] ) using the asymptotic form for @xmath89 .",
    "( [ greenfun ] ) then becomes ( neglecting the unimportant non - exponential prefactor ) in the asymptotic form [ saddledelta ] g ( y , r,- )= d p e^- p ( - ) + 2 . the equation that determines the saddle point @xmath90 here is - ( - )",
    "+ = 0 or 2 + = . in the dangerous case that @xmath90 is large this leads to [ typp ] p_s = . with ( [ saddledelta ] )",
    "this becomes g ( y , r,- )= ( 8)^-1/2 e^- .",
    "thus , in summary , either or both the regions @xmath91 and @xmath92 give dominant contributions in ( [ greenfun ] ) .",
    "for @xmath93 we have @xmath94 while for @xmath92 @xmath95 the first of these can dominate the second only for a restricted range in @xmath66 , namely[etaest ] || < 8 , which implies , with ( [ typp ] ) p_s 2 . outside of the range ( [ etaest ] )",
    "the typical value of @xmath96 is at large @xmath66 of order @xmath97 , yielding p_s ~1 yr1 .",
    "we conclude , based on the simplified model equation ( [ simpleex ] ) that typical values of @xmath78 , and thus @xmath30 , are small , and therefore we should be able to use eq .",
    "( [ andim ] ) .",
    "we will see that this conclusion holds when we consider the full solution in section 6 .      in this subsection",
    "we want to estimate the possible size of corrections to the glr equation .",

    "( [ pert ] ) can be neglected for two reasons : ( i ) at @xmath107 this term is suppressed and ( ii ) the difference in brackets is small in both the semicassical and the ekl @xcite approach .",

    "thus we try to find the solution to the glr equation in the form : @xmath131 for @xmath132 we can write the equation : = |f_glr -f^2_glap the solution is f_glr = - ^y_0 d y e^y+ fr , where @xmath133 is the laplace image of function @xmath134 . again using ( [ eklans ] )",
    "we get f_glr=- a^2_g ^y_0 dy e^2 _ 0 y [ e^2 ( = _ 0 ) -e^ ( = _ 0 ) ] assuming that the second term in the above equation is much smaller than the first we have f_glr =- f^2_glap finally , we can get for the ratio = ^2 which gives a value of the order of 0.04 if @xmath135 . we will return to a discussion of the corrections to the glr equation in the next section where we will consider the general solution to the new equation at fixed @xmath102 .",
    "the above estimates seem in contradiction with the estimates in @xcite , where a large contribution from multigluon correlations was found .",
    "the method we use here is however quite diffent from the one in @xcite .",
    "there the effect of including the new ( pole ) singularity in @xmath45 ( the laplace conjugate variable to @xmath112 ) that results from the resummation of bubbles associated with the 4-pomeron coupling was contrasted with the contribution from the two pomeron cut at the level of the green functions . although the location of the singularities is quite close , their nature and residues are very different .",
    "this led to a large ratio of the contributions of these singularities to the green functions . in the present case we include in our estimates the two - gluon source ,",
    "i.e. the initial gluon distribution , and renormalize it in both cases to the same physical initial condition ( here the ekl ansatz ) , thus absorbing the residues . as was remarked in @xcite",
    ", one can absorb the residues alternatively in @xmath17 .",
    "further , in closing the contours involved in performing the inverse laplace transforms we closed on the singularities of the initial condition ( being the rightmost singularities ) , and not on the propagator poles .",
    "therefore our renormalized @xmath136 has no extra dependence on @xmath40 .",
    "we believe that our method is in the above sense more physical .      in this subsection we will solve eq .",
    "( [ pertcor ] ) numerically .",
    "the method we use goes as follows .",
    "we first perform a laplace transform with respect to @xmath111 on ( [ pertcor ] ) , which leads to [ glrdfom ] = f(,r ) - f^2(,r ) . using various _ anstze _ for @xmath137 we solve this equation using numerov s method , and perform finally the inverse laplace transform with respect to @xmath116 . for the various _ anstze _ we fit a parametrized form to @xmath115 of which the laplace transform can be taken analytically .",
    "we will investigate three cases .",
    "the first is the ekl ansatz from the previous subsection [ ekl2 ] f(y , r ) = a_g e^_0 y + f_0 r , where we take @xmath123 , @xmath138 , and @xmath139 . to correspond with the numbers given in the previous subsection we put @xmath140 .",
    "we will use this case to check the accuracy of the estimate given earlier , and drop for this check the requirement @xmath141 .",
    "let us denote the numerical answer by @xmath142 .",
    "then for the pole answer we find [ eklpole ] f^ekl(pole ) = r e^2_0 y + 2_0 r , and for the leading term of the saddle point contribution [ eklsaddle ] f^ekl(saddle ) e^4 where @xmath143 .",
    "note that both contributions vanish as @xmath144 . in table 1",
    "we list these three contributions for various @xmath8 at a fixed @xmath145 @xmath146 .",
    "it is clear from this table that @xmath147 is a very good approximation to @xmath142 , in fact better than one might expect from @xmath148 .",
    "next we treat a more realistic case .",
    "we now use for @xmath137 alternatively the mrsd0 and mrsd- @xcite gluon distribution functions , which are , at the starting scale @xmath9 , constant as function of @xmath8 , and behave as @xmath149 respectively .",
    "they are both parametrized by [ mrspar ] x g(x , q^2 ) = a_g x^_g ( 1-x)^_g ( 1+_g x ) , with the coefficients @xmath150 and @xmath151 given at @xmath152 in @xcite .",
    "we kept this parametrization up until @xmath145 @xmath146 , but refitted the coefficients for every step in the numerov procedure .",
    "the laplace transform of this parametrization is easily determined . following the methods described in the above we determine @xmath153 .",
    "we checked that @xmath154 vanishes for small @xmath111 .",
    "furthermore was solved under the condition @xmath155 .",
    "similarly to the previous subsection we determined at @xmath145 @xmath146 for values of @xmath0 from 0.01 down to the @xmath156 value of @xmath157 the ratios [ rat1 ] = and [ rat2 ] = .",
    "these ratios are given in table 2 .",
    "we infer from this table that corrections to the gluon structure function from multigluon correlations beyond the next - to - leading twist are small , at most 5% at small @xmath8 .",
    "we see that the mrsd- distribution leads to larger corrections than the mrsd0 one . as a fraction of the glr correction both _",
    "anstze _ are small , about 10% for the mrsd- case and 10 - 30% for the mrsd0 case .",
    "thus we confirm here the rough estimates from the previous section .",
    "however we note that estimates of the gluon correlation radius @xmath17 range from @xmath158 fm to @xmath159 fm . the numbers in table 2 are accordingly easily adjusted .",
    "in this section we will discuss the general solution to and its consequences for the gluon structure function .",
    "we start by noting that the equation ( [ genglr ] ) can be written , at fixed @xmath102 , as [ xigen ] = c_2nx_b^n g^(n ) ( x_b , r + _ 0 ) & - & + n^2 e^-(r+_0 ) & x_b^(n+1 ) g^(n + 1 ) ( y , r + _ 0 ) , & where we used the fact that that @xmath160 only depends on @xmath161 with an arbitrary @xmath9 . the above form of the equation reflects the choice @xmath162 .",
    "we focus now on the hypersurface @xmath163 .",
    "the evolution equation ( see ) can then be written in the form : [ genglrparxi ] = |_s + ( - ) - _",
    "s^2 e^- ( -g ) , where @xmath164 .",
    "the advantage of this form is that all explicit @xmath66 dependence such as @xmath165 has been removed .",
    "we can find @xmath166 using a double laplace transform with respect to @xmath111 and @xmath66 , namely [ doublemel ] g ( y , , ) = e^y+p g ( , p , ) .",
    "the function @xmath167 obeys the equation [ xieq ] = \\ {    ) = g ( , p ) e^(p^2 + p^2 ( p + 1 ) ( p - 1 ) ) + ( p - 1 ) ( e^--1 ) the function @xmath168 must be determined from the initial condition , , for @xmath169 , @xmath170 and @xmath171 where the solution looks as follows : [ incon ] g ( y = 0 , r , ) = g(,p)e^",
    "p e^ ( r + ) ( p ) + ( p-1 ) ( e^-r--1 ) , where @xmath172 we now assert that [ omp ] g ( , p ) = ( - f ( p ) ) e^ satisfies the initial condition of with @xmath173 at @xmath174 = 0 . here",
    "@xmath175 and @xmath176 is the euler gamma function .",
    "we will prove this shortly .",
    "thus , finally , the solution to looks as follows : [ finsol ] g ( y , , ) = ( - f ( p ) ) e^f(p)+ ( p - 1 ) e^--pr+y or changing the integration from @xmath78 to @xmath45 , [ finsolf ] g ( , p , ) = ( - f ) e^f+ ( p(f ) - 1 ) e^--p(f)r + y , where @xmath177 is determined by [ fp ] f = p ( f)+ ( p(f ) ) .",
    "the contour of integration over @xmath45 is defined in a such a way that all singularities in @xmath178 except the one at @xmath179 are located to the right of the contour .",
    "we can now verify the claim made in . at @xmath180 , @xmath181 , @xmath182",
    "we have [ checkinit1 ] g(y_0,r , ) e^y_0 ( -f ) e^-r p(f ) + f. we now close the @xmath45 contour in the right half plane . neglecting the @xmath48 term we have @xmath183 , and we get indeed [ checkinit2 ] g(y_0,r , ) _",
    "n=1^ e^n e^y_0 + the structure function can be found from putting @xmath184 ( see ) .",
    "we obtain [ strsol ] g(y , = 0,r ) = ( - f ) e^ ( p(f ) - 1 ) -p(f)r + y. implies that @xmath185 .",
    "therefore we can close the contour in @xmath45 over the singularities of @xmath186 .",
    "next we must integrate over @xmath116 .",
    "we evaluate this integral using the method of steepest descent and the large @xmath45 approximation for @xmath187 . neglecting terms proportional to @xmath102 in the exponent",
    "we find the saddlepoint @xmath188 where @xmath189 .",
    "then @xmath190 where @xmath191 is a pre - exponential , smooth factor .",
    "the above series clearly converges and the typical value of @xmath30 in this series is of the order of unity .",
    "we thus confirm the estimates from the previous section , and see that we could trust our calculations of the anomalous dimension @xmath34 .",
    "we note that this series has an infinite radius of convergence .",
    "thus for the simplified model we consider and for the case of an eikonal initial condition we conclude that there is no analogy to a renormalon in the wilson operator product expansion .",
    "now we wish to consider the solution near @xmath192 , to understand under which circumstances it suffices to take only this singularity into account .",
    "note that this corresponds to the leading twist case , with glap evolution .",
    "in this region we can rewrite the solution in the following form . substituting @xmath193",
    "we obtain : [ solf1 ] g(y , = 0,r ) = e^ where [ psi ] = y - r+r+tr\\{+-1 } from this form of the exponent we see that for @xmath116 smaller than @xmath194 where [ omcr ] _ cr = 2|(1+)\\{1 + } ^0_cr\\ { 1 + } we can not close the contour in @xmath35 over singularities at positive @xmath35 .",
    "( here we introduce the parameter @xmath195 in order to separate the effects of @xmath25 and @xmath38 . ) for such @xmath116 one would need all singularities in @xmath45 . to understand what happens in this region",
    "let us expand @xmath196 by writing @xmath197 : [ psi2 ] = _ cry - r+r+(y -r - ) integration over @xmath198 and use steepest descent .",
    "] gives rise to the delta function @xmath199 $ ] where [ to ] t_0=[^2_cry-|r ] carrying out the integration gives [ solfinf1 ] g(y , = 0,r ) = e^_cry- r+r let us define the `` critical line '' @xcite by [ crline ] y_cr = r - r the gluon structure function is on this critical line [ strfuncrline ] x_b g ( x_b , q^2 ) = r_n^2q^2 [ + ] ^-1 for @xmath200 this becomes [ strfundo ] x_b g ( x_b , q^2 ) = r_n^2q^2 . note that this is similar to the solution of the glr equation with running coupling @xcite , but not quite the same .",
    "thus , the structure of the solution to the new evolution equation with the initial condition looks as follows . in the kinematic region to the right of the critical line we can in fact solve the linear glap equation , but with the new initial condition on the critical line . to the left of the critical line we need the solution to the full equation .",
    "note that if we would change the initial condition of the full evolution equation the value of the structure function on the critical line would also change .",
    "we have thus achieved a new understanding of the role of the initial condition in the problem . in particular , we conclude that the solution on the critical line depends only on the initial condition in the region of @xmath201 , i.e. it depends only on the initial condition for the glap equation .",
    "implicitly we have used here the assumption , expressed in our initial condition ( [ efor ] ) , that the multigluon correlations are sufficiently small at large @xmath8 .",
    "we recall that the original derivation of the glr equation was based on this same assumption .",
    "we are not restricted to such an assumption for our equation .",
    "clearly , if there were strong correlations between gluons at large @xmath8 it would change the explicit form of the solution of our evolution equation .",
    "nevetheless , the line of reasoning followed in this section would continue to hold .",
    "for @xmath202 we have two different situations . in the first",
    ", for @xmath203 the solution on the critical line is the same as in .",
    "i.e. the only change that occurs in the solution of the case @xmath200 is that there is a new equation for the critical line , .",
    "note that the hera experiments correspond to this situation .    at very large values of @xmath112 ( @xmath204 ) ,",
    "when @xmath205 the solution on the critical line looks as follows : [ strfundneqo ] x_b g ( x_b , q^2 ) = r_n^2q^2 in this case we must solve the glap equation using as the boundary condition .",
    "the main result of the paper is the new evolution equation ( [ genglrpar ] ) .",
    "it allows us to penetrate deeper into the region of high density qcd because we incorporate multigluon correlations into the evolution , and to answer questions which could not be answered before .",
    "for example one could now investigate the question of how well the glauber theory for shadowing corrections in deep - inelastic scattering with a heavy nucleus works .",
    "this present equation solves two theoretical problems which arise in the region of high parton density : ( i ) it takes induced multigluon correlations into account , which originate from parton - parton ( mainly gluon - gluon ) interactions at high enegy and can be calculated in the framework of perturbative qcd , and ( ii ) it allows for an arbitrary initial gluon distribution , which is nonperturbative in nature .",
    "our numerical estimates show that the effect of multigluon correlations is rather small in the accessible region of energy .",
    "we have seen evidence for this by using approximate methods and the general solution to the new equation .",
    "we have shown that the general solution confirms the strategy developed for the glr equation : we have calculated the new critical line for the generalized equation and shown that to the right of this critical line we can solve the linear glap equation with a new boundary condition on this line .",
    "we found this boundary condition taking into account the multigluon correlations .",
    "this approach , developed in this paper simplifies also the solution to the glr equation and allows us to understand how solutions to the glr equation depend on the initial conditions .",
    "this is essentially a consequence of the linearization of the glr equation in [ genglrpar ] .",
    "we have not discussed here the behaviour of the solution in the region to the left of the critical line , where multigluon correlations should come more forcefully into play .",
    "we plan to do this in later publication .",
    "we hope that the solution in the latter kinematic region will have a significant impact on understanding the scale of the shadowing correction and the importance of multigluon correlations in the so - called regge domain .",
    "this must be understood in order to provide a matching between soft and hard processes .    *",
