    "water models are of fundamental importance in many fields of physics , chemistry , biology and engineering . for example",

    "computer simulations are an important tool to study such phenomena . nevertheless , the computational cost for full - atom simulations of large - scale biological systems with explicit water for experimentally - relevant time - scales is often prohibitive",
    ". therefore , it is necessary to explore alternative approaches that could allow us to access mesoscopic scales and time - scales of the order of seconds .",
    "a possible solution is to develop coarse - grain models of water that could greatly reduce the simulation cost for the solvent preserving its main physical properties .    despite the importance of water in many aspects of life , there are still open questions concerning its complex nature",
    ". water exhibits more than 60 anomalies @xcite , like the existence of a density maximum in the liquid phase at ambient pressure and temperature @xmath0c or the anomalous increase of the specific heat @xmath1 , isothermal compressibility @xmath2 , and absolute value of the thermal expansivity @xmath3 upon cooling liquid water toward the melting line and below it , in the supercooled liquid state @xcite .",
    "a common understanding is that all these peculiar properties of water are related to its hydrogen bonds ( hbs ) forming a network that orders following tetrahedral patterns at low @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "a large number of classical atomistic water models have been proposed in the last decades with some performing better than others @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , there is still no atomistic model able to fit all the water properties @xcite .",
    "one possible reason for it is that pair - additive potentials do not capture the effective many - body interactions due to quantum effects and polarizability @xcite .",
    "consistent with this view , the effect of these many - body interactions are stronger where the water anomalies are more evident @xcite .    the origin of anomalous properties of water has been largely debated since the 80 s @xcite and a series of thermodynamic scenarios have been proposed @xcite . in particular , poole et al .",
    ", based on molecular dynamic simulations , proposed a liquid - liquid second critical point ( llcp ) in the supercooled region @xcite . according to this scenario , the llcp is located at the end of a first order phase transition separating two liquid metastable phases of water with different density , structure and energy @xcite .",
    "extrapolations from experimental data @xcite , based on the hypothesis of such a critical point , show that the maxima in response functions should be much stronger and at lower temperature than those predicted by the classical model used in ref .",
    "however , equilibrate classical models at very low @xmath4 is extremely computationally demanding , making difficult to settle the disagreement between the simulations and the extrapolated experimental data .",

    "we show that the bulk model exhibits a liquid - liquid phase transition ( llpt ) in the supercooled region , as the monolayer .",
    "we find a relevant difference between the results for the response functions in the the bulk model and those in the monolayer .",
    "in both cases we observe a line of weak maxima and a line of strong maxima for the response functions in the pressure - temperature phase diagram , however the @xmath1 weak maxima in bulk water are observable only at negative pressure , at variance with the monolayer case .",

    "we set @xmath11 and consider the case of a homogeneous fluid , in such a way that each cell is occupied by one water molecule .",

    "hence , only 1/6 of the entire range of values @xmath32 $ ] for this angle is associated to a bonding state .",
    "we account for this constrain introducing a bonding variable @xmath33 $ ] of molecule @xmath19 with each of the six nearest molecules @xmath20 and setting @xmath34 to account correctly for @xmath35 the contribution to the hb energy via the @xmath36 if @xmath37 , 0 otherwise , and @xmath38 the entropy variation due to the hb formation and breaking .",
    "we set @xmath39 , consistent with the proportion between the van der waals interaction and the directional ( covalent ) part of the hb interaction .",
    "the last term in the hamiltonian accounts for the cooperativity of the hbs and is an effective many - body interaction between hbs due the o  o  o correlation that locally leads the molecules toward an ordered ( tetrahedral ) configuration @xmath40 where the sum is over the six bonding indices of the molecules @xmath19 with the molecules @xmath41 and @xmath42 , both near @xmath19 . by setting @xmath43 , with @xmath44 , we guarantee that this term is relevant only at those temperatures below which the molecule @xmath19 has already formed ( non - tetrahedral ) hbs with the molecules @xmath41 and @xmath42 , implying an effective many - body interaction of molecule @xmath19 with the four bounded molecules in its hydration shell .",
    "a consequence of the formation of a network of tetrahedral hbs is the increase of proper volume associated to each molecule .",
    "the model takes this effect into account on average by adding a small increase of volume @xmath45 per bond , consistent with the average volume increase between high-@xmath46 ices vi and viii and low-@xmath46 ( tetrahedral ) ice ih .",
    "therefore , the total volume of the system with @xmath27 hbs is @xmath47 the tetrahedral local rearrangement does not change the average water - water distance , therefore the distance @xmath48 in eq.([lennard_jones ] ) is not affected by the change in eq.([v_hb ] ) .",

    "therefore , the strong maxima are due to the cooperative rearrangement of the hb network .",
    "on the other hand , the weak maxima at higher temperatures are due to weak volume fluctuations associated to the formation of single hbs , coinciding with the largest variation of @xmath27 , as already seen for the water monolayer case @xcite .    the resulting phase diagram ( fig .",

    "below the tmd line we find weak extrema at higher @xmath4 and strong extrema at lower @xmath4 for the response functions , @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 . while the loci of weak extrema are @xmath6-dependent and merge at high @xmath6 , the loci of strong extrema are @xmath6-independent and overlap .",

    "as demonstrated by finite size scaling for the case of a monolayer @xcite , this finding is consistent with the occurrence of a llpt ending in a liquid - liquid critical point .",
    "our analysis shows that the bulk many - body water model reproduces the fluid properties of water in a wide range of pressures and temperatures . below the liquid gas phase transition and above the liquid - to - gas spinodal in the stretched liquid state at @xmath81",
    ", we find the tmd line and , at much lower @xmath4 , the tmind line .",
    "the first at atmospheric pressure , corresponding to @xmath91 in our model , occurs at 277  k , while the second is estimated at a @xmath92  k @xcite .",
    "therefore , the phase diagram we present here goes from the gas to the deep supercooled region of liquid water .    below the tmd line , we find @xmath6-dependent extrema of the response functions @xmath1 , @xmath3 and @xmath2 . while @xmath3 has extrema at all the investigated @xmath6 , @xmath1 displays @xmath6-dependent maxima only at negative @xmath6 , while @xmath2 only at @xmath82 . in particular ,",
    "the maxima of @xmath2 converge toward minima for @xmath6 approaching 0 and these minima cross the turning point of the tmd line as expected @xcite , showing that our results are thermodynamically consistent and similar to those of atomistic models for water @xcite .",
    "however , our model allows us to simulate in an efficient way supercooled liquid water even at temperatures below the tmind line , an extremely demanding task for atomistic models as a consequence of the glassy slowing down of the dynamics @xcite .",
    "thanks to this peculiar property we find that at @xmath93 , below the loci of the @xmath6-dependent maxima , all the response functions have sharp maxima that have almost no @xmath6 dependence up to @xmath80 .",

    "are observed also for @xmath82 , while for the bulk case they are overshadowed by the strong maxima at @xmath82 .",
    "this difference between monolayer and bulk water is consistent with the fact that in the latter the total number of accessible states is much larger . in the case of the monolayer",
    "each molecule has four bonding variables with @xmath94 accessible configurations @xcite .",
    "instead , for the bulk each molecule has six bonding variables with @xmath95 accessible configurations .",
    "therefore , the entropy loss due to the formation of the hb network is much greater for the bulk with respect to the monolayer , consistent with a @xmath1 with broader maxima that dominate over the weak maxima .",
    "it is worth noticing that although our prediction of strong and weak maxima for the response functions has not been directly tested in atomistic models , it is perfectly consistent , qualitatively , with the results of atomistic simulations and at the same time with the experimental results @xcite .",
    "furthermore , several atomistic models give hints of more than one maxima in @xmath1 , showing the line of @xmath6-dependent @xmath1 maxima converging toward the line of @xmath1 minima when crossing the point where the tmd line meets the tmind line @xcite .",
    "this convergence of loci of @xmath1 maxima , tmd , tmind and @xmath1 minima is consistent with the results for the water monolayer @xcite and possibly also with the present results for bulk water .",
    "we find that all the maxima of response functions merge and diverge at @xmath80 and @xmath96 .",
    "therefore we estimate the occurrence of a llcp at these approximate values . a finite - size analysis , as the one performed for the monolayer case @xcite ,",
    "would be necessary to estimate with larger confidence the llcp .",
    "this analysis could also allows us to study the universality class of the llcp in bulk",

    "we find that the maxima of the response functions decrease and occur at lower @xmath4 , consistent with a llpt with negative slope in the @xmath6-@xmath4 plane and ending in the llcp , as found for the water monolayer @xcite .    in conclusion ,",

    "furthermore , we find properties consistent with those demonstrated in a rigorous way for the many - body water monolayer , including the occurrence of strong and weak maxima for the response functions @xcite .",
    "therefore , we can argue that these properties do not originate in the low - dimensionality of the monolayer system , but they are an intrinsic property of the model due to the cooperative contribution to the hb interactions . because the cooperativity in water is a necessary implication of its peculiar properties @xcite , we argue that our results are relevant for real water .",

    "<S> many - body interactions can play a relevant role in water properties . here </S>",
    "<S> we study by monte carlo simulations a coarse - grained model for bulk water that includes many - body interactions associated to water cooperativity . </S>",
    "<S> the model is efficient and allows us to equilibrate water at extreme low temperatures in a wide range of pressures . </S>",
    "<S> we find the line of temperatures of maximum density at constant pressure and , at low temperature and high pressure , a phase transition between high - density liquid and low - density liquid phases . </S>",
    "<S> the liquid - liquid phase transition ends in a critical point . in the supercritical liquid region </S>",
    "<S> we find for each thermodynamic response function a locus of weak maxima at high temperature and a locus of strong maxima at low temperature , with both loci converging at the liquid - liquid critical point where they diverge . </S>",
    "<S> comparing our results with previous works for the phase diagram of a many - body water monolayer , we observe that the weak maxima of the specific heat are less evident in bulk and appear only at negative pressures , while we find those of compressibility and thermal expansion coefficient also at positive pressures in bulk . </S>",
    "<S> however , the strong maxima of compressibility and thermal expansion coefficient are very sharp for the bulk case . </S>",
    "<S> our results clarify fundamental properties of bulk water , possibly difficult to detect with atomistic models not accounting for many - body interactions . </S>"
