    "in the past two decades , ultra - cold atomic systems have emerged as ideal playgrounds for the controlled simulation and manipulation of textbook models from many - body physics @xcite . using the full armory of developed tools",
    "the parameters of the underlying hamiltonian can be tuned with an unprecedented precision allowing for the exploration of phase diagrams synonymous with condensed matter physics .",
    "in addition , the high degree of isolation , tunability and long coherent time scales associated with ensembles of ultra - cold atoms allow for excellent time resolution of quantum dynamics @xcite .    for a long time studies of integrable systems",
    "were considered a purely academic pursuit , but by now can be created in the laboratory with ensembles of cold atoms . by applying the appropriate lasers to bose - einstein condensates , one dimensional arrays of atoms may be formed @xcite . in the limit of strong interactions these arrays",
    "were observed to be in a fermionised state known as the tonks - girardeau gas @xcite , a prototypical integrable system .    in this work",
    "we will focus on the tonks - girardeau gas in a particularly interesting configuration which admits critical point . if a weak periodic potential is applied along the axial direction of a one - dimensional ultra - cold quantum gas it is possible to generate an atomic simulation of the sine - gordon model @xcite . when the interactions between the particles in the gas are sufficiently repulsive and the lattice is commensurate with the particle density ( one particle per lattice well ) this model has a quantum phase transition ( at @xmath0 ) where atoms become pinned to the mott insulator state .",
    "in contrast to the well known superfluid - mott insulator transition , pinning to the mott phase occurs for an infinitesimally weak lattice potential @xcite .",
    "a spectacular recent experiment demonstrated this transition for ensembles of one dimensional ultra - cold gases @xcite .    in general , a quantum many - body system which undergoes a quantum phase transition",
    "may be written as @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the driving parameter and the hamiltonian driving the quantum phase transition ( qpt ) respectively .",
    "a feature of a phase transition is that if the parameter @xmath2 is varied across the critical point , the energy spectrum undergoes a dramatic change i.e. , the ground states of @xmath4 and @xmath5 will significantly differ . as a consequence",
    "the overlap of the ground states is expected to be sensitive to a qpt @xcite . according to @xcite , the tonks - girardeau gas has a pinning quantum phase transition at @xmath6 when the driving hamiltonian ( @xmath3 ) includes an optical lattice @xmath7 commensurate with atomic density where the amplitude of the lattice is the parameter driving qpt i.e. , @xmath8 . in this paper",
    "we shall denote @xmath9 as the hamiltonian of tg gas in a trapping potential @xmath10 and @xmath11 as the hamiltonian of tg gas in @xmath12 potential .",
    "we denote the ground state of @xmath13 as @xmath14 and ground state of @xmath15 as @xmath16 .",
    "we expect that the overlap of ground states @xmath17 will be sensitive even to infinitesimally weak optical lattice if lattice periodicity is commensurate with atomic density @xcite . in quantum information theory ,",
    "the square modulus of the overlap is known as fidelity @xcite and is a central concept in state characterisation .",
    "the ground state fidelity is defined as @xmath18    in this work we use this fidelity to study pinning quantum phase transition in the tonks - girardeau gas .",
    "we find , as expected , that gsf decreases with the increase of the lattice amplitude and size of the system .",
    "we emphasize that in the thermodynamic limit the gsf can unequivocally determine the pinning quantum phase transition for an infinitesimally small lattice amplitude .",
    "nevertheless , the auxiliary trapping potential and finite size effects are important for experimentally relevant numbers of particles .",
    "we find that the gsf is in agreement with recent experiments on the pinning quantum phase transition ( qpt ) for a luttinger liquid of strongly interacting bosons @xcite .",
    "all of the observed properties of ground state fidelity are also reflected in the dynamical evolution of the system i.e in survival probability or the loschmidt echo @xcite ( for a review see e.g. @xcite ) . the average value of the loschmidt echo decreases for lower value of ground state fidelity ; that is a general observation . details of loschmidt echo dynamics , such as the dominant frequency of revivals ,",
    "depend on the particular trapping potential .",
    "we find that for the tg gas in an infinitely deep box potential oscillations of the loschmidt echo are large and occur with smaller frequency in the critical region than in rest of parameter space . in the harmonic oscillator potential ,",
    "the frequency of the loschmidt echo revivals is constant until we reach a critical number of particles @xmath19 , and after @xmath19 the oscillations become irregular .",
    "consider a gas of bosons confined in a tight waveguide at @xmath0 temperature with tight transverse trapping frequencies such that @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the chemical potential . in this regime",
    "we may describe the many - body system by an effective one dimensional hamiltonian , @xmath22\\hat{\\psi}(x)+\\frac{g}{2}\\int dx \\hat{\\psi}^{\\dagger}(x ) \\hat{\\psi}^{\\dagger}(x ) \\hat{\\psi}(x ) \\hat{\\psi}(x),\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is an arbitrary one dimensional longitudinal external potential and @xmath23 describes the strength of a short ranged interaction .",
    "in such one dimensional systems it is typical to introduce the following dimensionless parameter , @xmath24 , which is the ratio of the kinetic energy to the interaction energy ( @xmath25 is the linear density ) . in the spatially uniform case",
    "the spectrum is gapless for all @xmath26 and described by a luttinger liquid of bosons .",
    "let us assume a one dimensional optical lattice @xmath27 is applied along the longitudinal direction of the waveguide in addition to already existing trapping potential @xmath10 , in this case @xmath28 is the strength of the applied lattice and we introduce wave vector @xmath29 .",
    "when interactions are weak , @xmath30 , and the lattice strength is much larger than the recoil energy @xmath31 , eq .",
    "may be mapped on to the bose - hubbard model in the tight binding approximation @xcite . in this model",
    ", there is a phase transition as one changes the ratio of tunneling to atom - atom interactions , between a superfluid state where the atoms are free to tunnel between the wells coherently and a mott state with an excitation gap and fixed number of particles per lattice site .",
    "interestingly , in the opposite case when the strength of the applied lattice is much smaller than the recoil energy @xmath32 , the bose - hubbard model is not applicable as the bosons now occupy several vibrational states in each well . in this case",
    "it was shown by bchler _",
    "et al _ that the system maybe mapped to the famous sine - gordon model @xcite , an effective low energy theory has been extensively studied in the literature as a rare example of an exactly solvable quantum field theory .",
    "et al _ showed that when the gas is in strongly interacting tonks girardeau limit , @xmath33 , and the lattice is commensurate with the density then the system will be pinned to the mott insulator state for an arbitrary weak lattice @xcite .",
    "the pinning phase transition is quite straightforward to understand in the tonks - girardeau limit of strong repulsive interactions , @xmath34 , in which this work will focus on .",
    "physically , one may understand the pinning phase transition in this limit as the competition between the average inter - particle distance due to the strong interactions and the period of the potential . in this limit",
    "the hard core interactions play the role of the pauli exclusion principle and the fermi - bose mapping theorem of girardeau applies @xcite .",
    "this theorem proves that the wavefunction of the system defined by a hamiltonian such as eq .   with @xmath34",
    "is equivalent to the properly symmetrised wavefunction of a gas of noninteracting fermions in the same trapping potential @xmath10 .",
    "as is customary for non - interacting fermions with periodic boundary conditions , an applied commensurate lattice @xmath35 leads to the opening of a single particle band gap of width @xmath36 .",
    "this is the mott insulating phase .    as we will focus on the pinning transition in the tonks girardeau limit ,",
    "let us briefly review the fermi - bose mapping theorem .",
    "the essential idea is that one can treat the interaction term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) by replacing it with a boundary condition on the allowed manybody bosonic wave - function @xmath37 for @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "this is a hard core constraint meaning no probability exists for two particles ever to be at the same point in space .",
    "this constraint is automatically fulfilled by the corresponding noninteracting fermionic system using a slater determinant such that @xmath40\\ ; , \\label{eq : psif}\\ ] ] where the @xmath41 are the single particle eigenstates of the noninteracting system in trapping potential @xmath10 .",
    "this , however , leads to a fermionic rather than bosonic symmetry , which can be corrected by a multiplication with the appropriate unit antisymmetric function @xcite @xmath42 the power of the mapping theorem is that certain important many - body quantities of the tonks - girardeau gas in an arbitrary external potential , can now be calculated using single particle states .",
    "the analytic nature of the many - body states of the gas in this limit are convenient to explore the properties of the pinning transition .",
    "a feature of the pinning quantum phase transition is that even a weak lattice can change the energy spectrum dramatically and the overlap of two ground states decreases . using fb mapping ,",
    "the ground state fidelity can be expressed via single particle basis @xcite @xmath43 where elements of matrix @xmath44 are @xmath45 if the system is in the ground state @xmath14 and we suddenly turn on optical lattice @xmath35 , the probability that we will excite the system away from the initial ground state is conveniently related to the ground state fidelity @xcite @xmath46 in section [ sec : loschmidt ] we explore non - equilibrium dynamics after a sudden quench of lattice amplitude .",
    "the fidelity of the tg gas is formally equivalent to a gas of non - interacting spin polarized fermions @xcite .",
    "in this section we apply the concept of ground state fidelity ( gsf ) [ eqs .",
    "( [ ftg ] ) and ( [ matrixa ] ) ] to study the pinning quantum phase transition for a tg gas in an infinitely deep box potential , @xmath47 the lattice potential is defined as @xmath48 .",
    "the periodicity of the lattice corresponds to the length of the box , @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is an integer .",
    "thus , for @xmath51 we have exactly @xmath50 wells within the box , and we expect to see the signature of the pinning transition at @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the number of particles .",
    "for the the other phases @xmath54 there are @xmath55 well defined wells , and two half - wells at the edges of the box . in the thermodynamic limit the differences due to boundary effects will disappear ( or become irrelevant ) , however in our simulations we will investigate these finite size effects which can be relevant for experiments .",
