    "optical frequency combs have revolutionized precision laser frequency measurements @xcite . these combs make it possible to determine absolute laser frequencies across the visible @xcite , infrared @xcite , and ultraviolet wavelength ranges @xcite with an accuracy limited only by laboratory frequency standards @xcite . under ideal circumstances , the laser metrology is stable enough that relative fractional frequency instabilities as low as @xmath2 can be reliably measured @xcite .",
    "the accuracy is great enough that frequency - comb based measurements of atomic transitions are being considered for the re - definition of the second @xcite .",
    "laser metrology methods based on frequency combs is more reliable than those based on wavelength measurements @xcite .",
    "this is due in part to the fact that time and frequency can be measured in the laboratory with greater reliability than distance .",
    "it is also due to the fact that frequency measurements are free from geometric distortions and phase shifts associated with wavelength measurements .    in this paper",
    "we report a measurement of the yb @xmath0 transition frequency at 399 nm using an optical frequency comb .",
    "we verify the accuracy of our laser metrology by measuring the frequencies of several well - known transitions in rb and cs .",
    "we show how hyperfine interactions systematically shift the transition frequencies in the odd yb isotopes , an effect not previously accounted for in yb frequency measurements .",
    "our measurements agree with the less accurate results of refs .",
    "our frequency comb measurements disagree with the value reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , as discussed in the following section .",
    "a determination of the yb @xmath0 transition frequency was reported in ref .",
    "this measurement was based on a wavelength comparison between two lasers using an optical cavity .",
    "one laser at 798 nm was frequency doubled and used to probe the yb transition .",
    "the other laser at 780 nm was stabilized to saturated absorption in rb .",
    "optical cavities have been used to compare the wavelengths of widely separated laser lines with good accuracy .",
    "this technique requires a careful measurement of the cavity s free spectral range as well as its phase relation with wavelength ( see , for example @xcite and @xcite footnote 14 ) . in its most successful implementation , this method has produced sub - mhz accuracy with results that have been reproduced by different research groups @xcite .    the optical cavity method used in ref .",
    "@xcite differs from previous work in that a bow - tie cavity was used instead of a linear one .",
    "this method has produced good measurement results when the transition frequency was previously known with high enough accuracy .",
    "for example , a recent measurement of the cs-133 d1 transitions by this group has reproduced the results of earlier high - accuracy frequency comb measurements @xcite .    however , when the transition frequency is not well known , the method of ref .",
    "@xcite produces unreliable results @xcite .",
    "the k-39 d1 and d2 hyperfine - free transitions published by this group disagree strongly with frequency comb measurements by 478 mhz and 592 mhz , respectively @xcite , even though the uncertainties were estimated to be 0.05 and 0.1 mhz .",
    "the authors of the frequency comb work concluded that the initial frequency used in the optical cavity method were `` not sufficiently precise to unambiguously determine the d lines frequencies . ''",
    "@xcite    even when the transition frequencies are known well enough to give reliable laser metrology , the spectroscopic methods used by this group have systematic errors larger than anticipated .",
    "for example , the li-6 d2 @xmath3 transition frequency measured by this group disagrees with the frequency comb measurements of ref .",
    "@xcite by 1.85 mhz and the li-7 @xmath4 transition by 0.65 mhz even though the uncertainties were though to be only 0.060 and 0.040 mhz , respectively ( 31 and 16 standard deviations ) . in these measurements ,",
    "the influence of the hyperfine interaction and the variation in the apparent transition frequency with laser polarization was not considered .",
    "this omission alone leads to mhz - level systematic errors @xcite .",
    "similarly , mhz - level discrepancies with the rb d1 transitions from this group are found when they are compared with the frequency comb work of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "previous to the measurements in ref .",
    "@xcite , only the nist atomic spectra database data was available for the absolute frequency of the yb i 399 nm transition @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties related to these data are perhaps @xmath5 mhz , although the uncertainties are not well characterized @xcite . for the reasons given above , the measurements of this yb transition in ref .",
    "@xcite must be considered with caution .",
    "somewhat more recently , two other measurements of the 399 nm transition have been published .",
    "the measurement in ref .",
    "@xcite used a wavemeter to determine the absolute transition frequency in yb-176 .",
    "the accuracy of the measurement was limited by the 600 mhz absolute accuracy of the wavemeter .",
    "another measurement in ref .",
    "@xcite used an optical cavity to span a 41 thz optical frequency gap between a known laser frequency and a probe laser .",
    "this method is similar to that used by ref .",
    "@xcite , and the estimated uncertainty is 100 mhz . given these data and the unreliability of the measurement in ref .",
    "@xcite , a new determination of the yb i 399 nm transition frequency is warranted .",
    "a schematic diagram of the laser system is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : layout ] @xcite .",
    "the frequency comb is generated by a femtosecond laser oscillator ( laser quantum gigajet ) with a repetition rate @xmath6 984 mhz .",
    "the repetition rate is measured using a high - speed photodiode . by mixing the photodiode signal down to 9 mhz using a stable rf synthesizer",
    ", we measure @xmath7 with a precision of 0.1 hz .",
    "schematic diagram of the laser system .",
    "the frequency comb is a femtosecond laser with a 984 mhz repetition rate .",
    "the reference laser is a diode laser locked to the rb d2 @xmath8 crossover transition .",
    "the beatnote frequency @xmath9 between the reference laser and the frequency comb is stabilized using a microwave interferometer and feedback control .",
    "the scanning laser is a ti : sapphire laser .",
    "the beatnote frequency @xmath10 between the scanning laser and comb is also stabilized .",
    "the accuracy of the offset - locking scheme is evaluated by measuring transition frequencies in cs and rb using saturated absorption ( sat .",
    "pd = photodiode , sa = spectrum analyzer , lpf = low pass filter , rf1,2,3 = radio frequency synthesizers , mwi = microwave interferometer , fb = feedback control , wp = waveplate . ]",
    "the reference laser in fig .",
    "[ fig : layout ] is a diode laser ( vescent photonics dfb laser module ) that is locked to the rb-87 d2 @xmath11 crossover transition near 780 nm .",
    "the beatnote between the reference laser and the nearest comb mode is locked to a particular value using a microwave interferometer and feedback control .",
    "the beatnote frequency @xmath9 , which is measured directly using a spectrum analyzer , is combined with a stable rf signal and mixed down to 20 mhz .",
    "this filtered and amplified signal is sent to the microwave interferometer consisting of a power splitter , a delay line , a frequency mixer , and a low - pass filter .",
    "the output of the interferometer is a low - noise dispersion - like dc - signal that we use to offset - lock the nearest comb mode to the reference laser .",
    "this signal feeds back to the frequency comb s cavity length @xcite .",
    "therefore , the frequency of one mode of the comb is well - known , provided that the saturated absorption lock in the reference laser is accurate.counting @xmath7 then gives us the absolute frequencies of all of the other modes in the comb .    the scanning laser in fig .",
    "[ fig : layout ] is a ti : sapphire laser ( m - squared lasers solstis ) .",
    "a portion of the laser beam is split off and referenced to the frequency comb in a manner that is similar to the reference laser , producing the beatnote @xmath10 .",
    "the only difference is that the rf synthesizer ( rf3 in fig .",
    "[ fig : layout ] ) is controlled by a computer .",
    "the frequency interval , @xmath12 , between the reference laser and the scanning laser is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is an integer .",
    "the ambiguity of the signs in eq .",
    "[ eqn : df ] is resolved by experimentally observing how the magnitudes of the beatnote frequencies change as the entire comb shifts up and down in frequency .",
    "this shift is accomplished by varying the frequency comb cavity length slightly .",
    "the absolute frequency of the scanning laser , @xmath15 is then given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the frequency of the rb-87 d2 @xmath18 crossover transition @xcite .",
    "the integer @xmath14 in eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : df ] ) and ( [ eqn : fscan ] ) is reduced to @xmath19 by measuring the wavelength of the scanning laser .",
    "we use a toptica high finesse wa-6 wavemeter with an absolute accuracy of 600 mhz .",
    "the final ambiguity in @xmath14 is eliminated by measuring the yb transition frequency for different values of @xmath7 .",
    "accuracy issues generally divide into two categories .",
    "one is laser metrology , or the ability to measure laser frequencies correctly . in our experiment ,",
    "the frequency counters , general counting errors in the beatnotes , reference laser lock errors , and frequency comb errors contribute to this category .",
    "the second category is atomic spectroscopy , or the ability to accurately interrogate the atomic transitions .",
    "these issues include zeeman shifts , hyperfine and laser polarization shifts , laser - power related errors including stark shifts , cell shifts , line - shape errors , and first - order doppler shifts .",
    ".[tab : rbtransitions ] transitions in the rb-87 d2 array used to determine the value of the reference laser offset lock .",
    "the known transition frequencies @xmath20 were taken from ref . @xcite and the convenient tables of ref .",
    "the number in parenthesis in column 2 indicate the 1@xmath21 standard deviation in repeated measurements of the transition frequency .",
    "these transitions were chosen because they are relatively insensitive to variations in laser power and polarization @xcite . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we present a measurement of the yb @xmath22 transition at 399 nm and compare to values from the literature .",
    "our frequency comb measurements agree well with the measurements of refs . @xcite and @xcite but disagree with the measurements of ref .",
    "we show that discrepancies between other frequency measurements by this group and the more accurate values of frequency comb based measurements are similar to the discrepancy observed here .",
    "we also show that hyperfine effects shift the apparent transition frequency in the odd - isotopes , an effect that is not addressed in previous measurements in yb or measured in any other divalent atom .",
