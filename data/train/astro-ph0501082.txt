    "bd+25 4655 ( sao 90153 , hip108578 , is peg ) is an interesting object known today as a variable o subdwarf , suspected binary and spectrophotometric standard at the same time .",
    "it was mentioned as an sdo star in greenstein ( 1960 ) already .",
    "first detail analysis of this star using lte approach was accomplished by peterson ( 1970 ) .",
    "he derived the following basic parameters : @xmath0 ( see also richter 1971 ) .",
    "greenstein & sargent ( 1974 ) list equivalent widths of some lines and @xmath1 .",
    "some spectroscopic data were published also in an atlas of spectra of he - rich stars of kaufmann & theil ( 1980 ) covering 3700 - 4600 .",
    "bartolini et al .",
    "( 1982 ) searched for variability in hydrogen poor stars and although they failed to find regular periodicities for this star they did find variations in ubv with a period of @xmath2 and amplitude of @xmath3 in two nights . at the same time , they suggested long term variations on a time scale of several months and amplitude of @xmath4 .",
    "dworetsky et al .",
    "( 1982 ) measured the star in ubv system and obtained : v=9.69 , b - v=-0.26 , u - b=-1.16 , e(b - v)=0.06 .",
    "they classified it as o4 : .",
    "later on colina & bohlin ( 1994 ) obtained v=9.656 , b - v=-0.305 .",
    "tobin ( 1985 ) obtained uvby@xmath5 photometry .",
    "bartkevicius & lazauskaite ( 1996 ) classified the star in the vilnius photometric system as : sdo6 , he , and estimated @xmath6 .",
    "diplas & savage ( 1994 ) set an upper limit for interstellar hi column number density in front of the star : @xmath7 per @xmath8 . the star is a hst optical and uv spectrophotometric standard and oke ( 1990 ) measured its absolute spectral energy distribution in the range 3200 - 9200    while bohlin et al .",
    "( 1990 ) obtained absolute uv flux from iue data .",
    "hipparcos gives the parallax @xmath9 mas ( esa 1997 ) and labels the star as constant . above",
    "parallax corresponds to the distance of 111 pc .",
    "elkin ( 1998 ) attempted to measure the magnetic field but could set only an upper limit of about 300 g and concluded that there is no field within the precision of his measurements .",
    "ulla & thejll ( 1998 ) did ir photometry and obtained : @xmath10 .",
    "they found an excess in jhk fluxes of about @xmath11 and interpreted it as due to the binary companion of the sp .",
    "type earlier than b8 .",
    "they also put the following upper limit for the reddening @xmath12 .",
    "main aim of the paper is to present a preliminary analysis of this star based on high resolution , high signal to noise spectra using pure nlte h - he model atmospheres as well as to compile other available data from the literature for a more elaborated study .",
    "similar nlte analysis of sdo stars were recently carried by lanz et al .",
    "( 1997 ) ( using line blanketed nlte models ) and thejll et al . ( 1994 ) .",
    "recent review on sdo stars can be found in heber ( 1992 ) .",
    "the high resolution spectra were obtained at 6-m telescope of sao ras using main stellar spectrograph located in nasmith 2 platform of the telescope .",
    "spectral resolution of spectra obtained in blue and red regions are 0.3   and 0.45  , respectively . for both observations and subsequent data reduction we used midas package and",
    "also dech20 code ( galazutginov 1992 ) .",
    "the low resolution spectra were obtained at 1-m telescope with uags spectrograph .",
    "spectral resolution of this spectrum is about 6  . here",
    "the data reduction were done using the software written by vlasyuk ( 1993 ) and dech20 of galazutginov ( 1992 ) .",
    ".log of observations : spectrum identifier , date [ ddmmyyyy ] , time [ hhmm ] , exposure [ m ] , jd-2400000 of the middle of the exposure , wavelength interval covered [  ] , resolution [  ] , heliocentric correction [ km / s ] and radial velocity [ km / s ] . note : the second spectrum is not suitable for rv measurements and first spectrum has rather large error . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ t3 ]    similar effects of a two component model atmosphere could be expected if there is a convection resulting in some kind of solar like granulation with hotter granules and cooler inter - granules",
    ". however , groth et al . ( 1985 ) found that convection - when present - is a very ineffective energy transport mechanism in the atmospheres of such type of stars .    from absolute fluxes and parallax",
    "we can determine stellar parameters of the star as well .",
    "the slope of the paschen continuum or b - v color index are not very sensitive to the temperature of such hot stars because they are in the rayleigh - jeans region of the planck function and @xmath13 .",
    "absolute flux observed on the earth is @xmath14 and one could determine reliable radius r of the star if he knows the distance d and compares absolute and theoretical fluxes @xmath15 . as @xmath16 @xmath17 generally a 10% error in @xmath18 results in about 5% error in the stellar",
    "radius and parallax puts most severe constraints on the precision of this method ( muthsam & weiss 1978 ) .",
    "we tried to fit the observed absolute data in fig.[f5 ] with our preliminary model and found @xmath19 . assuming @xmath20 pc it results in @xmath21 .",
    "now , assuming @xmath22 we get an extremely low mass , @xmath23 this mass is lower than the lower limit for the core he burning , @xmath24 ( heber 1992 ) .",
    "nevertheless it is easily possible that the gravity is higher(lower ) by a factor of 2 - 3 due to above mentioned uncertainties in determining @xmath25 from h and he line profiles .",
    "the actual luminosity of the star is : @xmath26 consequently , absolute bolometric and visual magnitudes of the star are : @xmath27 @xmath28- 1)=+4.43^{m}\\ ] ]    finally , high resolution spectra enabled us to set a rather low limit on the rotation of the star . assuming zero microturbulence and gaussian instrumental profile with fwhm=0.3   we obtained @xmath29 . on the other hand microturbulence",
    "itself can not be higher than the same value .",
    "we can conclude that h - he nlte model can not provide a satisfactory description of the complex spectral features of this star . despite of this fact some parameters of the star and its atmosphere such as its radius are rather insensitive to the uncertainty in the effective temperature and could be estimated .",
    "another parameters , for instance , gravity , seems quite different from the value mentioned in the literature .",
