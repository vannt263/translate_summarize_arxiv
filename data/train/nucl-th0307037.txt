    "baym and kadanoff showed that a self - consistent solution of the above equation guarantees the fulfillment of the principal conservation laws  @xcite .      in the following we are interested in describing the coupling of sp motion to ph and pp(hh ) collective excitations of the system .",
    "all the relevant information regarding the latter are included in the lehmann representations of the polarization propagator @xmath20 that describes the excited states in the system with @xmath13 particles , and of the two - particle propagator that is relevant for the @xmath21 excitations @xmath22    in the calculation of sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] , these quantities have been evaluated by solving the dressed tda / rpa ( dtda / drpa ) equations  @xcite for the ph and pp case , respectively .",
    "the fact that a dressed sp propagator is used brings in to the calculation the effects of the strength distribution for particle and hole fragments .",
    "one must notice that the propagators  ( [ eq : pi ] ) and  ( [ eq : g2 ] ) are in fact the solution of more general bethe - salpeter equations , that also include correlations beyond the rpa level .",

    "the details of the formalism employed in this calculation have been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite and will not be shown here .",
    "for the present discussion it is sufficient to note that this approach computes the motion of three - quasiparticle excitations in the same way it is normally done to solve the three - body problem .",
    "this allows to include the effects of ph and pp(hh ) motion not only at the tda level but also with more collective rpa phonons and beyond .",
    "such excitations are coupled to each other by the faddeev equations , generating an infinite series of diagrams like the one shown in fig .",

    "in the calculations described below , the dyson equation was solved within a model space consisting of harmonic oscillator sp states .",
    "an oscillator parameter @xmath24 1.76  fm was chosen ( corresponding to @xmath25 13.4  mev ) and all the first four major shells ( from @xmath26 to @xmath27 ) plus the @xmath28 where included . inside this model space ,",
    "the interaction used was a brueckner g - matrix  @xcite derived from the bonn - c potential  @xcite .",
    "the results of refs .",
    "@xcite , suggest that this model space is large enough to properly account for the low - energy collective states in which we are mainly interested in , the src being accounted for through the g - matrix effective interaction .",
    "we note that energy dependence of the g - matrix also contributes to the normalization of the spectral strength . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that this accounts for the extra depletion of spectroscopic factors that is induced by src , at least for the normally occupied shells in the ipm .",
    "we mention that the solution of rpa equations may lead to collective instabilities whenever the iteration becomes too attractive .",
    "a particular sensitivity to the strength of the g - matrix interaction was found in the calculation of  @xcite , only for the lowest isoscalar @xmath29 solution .",
    "for this reason it was chosen to artificially shift its eigenvalue to the experimental energy of first excited state , 6.05  mev , during the successive iterations .",
    "note that the screening due the redistribution of the sp strength tends to reduce the instability problem in drpa .",

    "( [ eq : g1 ] ) , while the residual strength is collected in a effective pole  @xcite .",
    "as shown in table  [ tab : spectfact ] , only a few iterations are required to reach convergence . the converged distribution of one - hole strength is compared in with the experimental one in fig .",
    "[ fig : p+sd_hsf ] . the main difference between these results and",
    "the one obtained by using an ipm input is the appearance of a second smaller @xmath33 fragment at -26.3  mev .",
    "this peak arises in the first two iterations and appears to become stable in the last one , with a spectroscopic factor of 2.6% .",
    "this can be interpreted as a peak that describes the fragments seen experimentally at slightly higher missing energy .",
    "this is the first time that such a fragment is obtained in calculations of the spectral strength .",
    "further insight into the appearance of this strength is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : hsf_vs_o16 ] .",
    "a second effect of including fragmentation in the construction of the rpa phonons is to increase the strength of the main hole peaks .",
    "the @xmath32 strength increases from the 0.745 obtained with ipm input to 0.776 , essentially canceling the improvement gained by the introduction of rpa correlations over the tda ones .",
    "the main peak of the @xmath33 remains at 0.722 but the appearance of the secondary fragment slightly increases the overall strength at low energy as well .",
    "this behavior is due to the fact that redistribution of the strength ( and principally , the reduction of the main spectroscopic factors ) tends to screen the nuclear interaction , with respect to the ipm case .",
    "obviously , this makes the disagreement with experiments a little worse and additional work is needed to resolve the disagreement with the data .",
    "nevertheless it is clear that fragmentation is a relevant feature of nuclear systems and that it has to be properly taken into account .    together with the main fragments , the dyson equation produces also a large number of solutions with small spectroscopic factors .",
    "this strength extends down to about -130  mev for the one - hole spectral function and up to about 100  mev for the one - particle case .",
    "this background represents the strength that is removed from the main peaks and shifted up to medium missing energies .",
    "another 10% of strength is moved to very high energies due to src  @xcite .",
    "its location can not be explicitly calculated in the present approach but the effects on the reduction of spectroscopic factors at low energy is accounted through the energy dependence of the g - matrix . accordingly",
    "the total number of nucleons deduced from the fully self - consistent spectral function is about a 10% lower than @xmath40  16 , as reported in table  [ tab : spectfact ] .",
    "we note that the present approach gives predictions also for the strength distribution of quasiparticle excitations .",
    "although little experimental information is available for the addition of a nucleon ( as well as for the removal of a neutron ) .",
    "recently , knockout and nucleon transfer reactions , employing nuclear probes , have been applied to measure the hole spectroscopic factors of both stable and exotic nuclei  @xcite .",
    "these tools can now reach better accuracies than in the past and may , in principle , be used to extract information on the one - particle spectral distribution .      a deeper insight into the mechanisms that generate the fragmentation pattern can be gained by investigating directly the connection between the spectral function and some specific collective states . to clarify this point we repeated the third iteration using exactly the same input but without keeping the troublesome ph @xmath29 state at its experimental energy , it was discarded instead .",
    "the resulting @xmath5 hole spectral function is shown in the lower - left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : p+sd_hsf ] . in this calculation",
    "no breaking of the @xmath33 strength is obtained but only a single peak is found with a spectroscopic factor equal to 0.75 , which is the sum of the two fragments that are obtained when the @xmath42 state is taken into account .",
    "this result can be interpreted by considering the @xmath33 fragments as a hole in the ground state and in the first excited @xmath29 state of the @xmath0 core , respectively .",
    "the correct fragmentation pattern can be reproduced only when latter two levels are close enough , in energy , to one another .",
    "the other two low - lying states of @xmath0 that may be of some relevance are the isoscalar @xmath43 and @xmath41 .",
    "these excitations are reproduced reasonably well by rpa type calculations  @xcite but are typically found at @xmath443  mev above the experimental results .",
    "the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : p+sd_hsf ] show the results for the even parity spectral functions that are obtained when both the @xmath41 and the @xmath43 ph - drpa solutions are shifted to match their experimental values . in this case , a @xmath36 hole peak is obtained at a missing energy -17.7  mev , in agreement with experiment , and with a spectroscopic strength of  0.5% .",
    "it should be noted that many _ weak _ fragments ( i.e. relative to the addition or knockout for a nucleon with a small spectroscopic factor ) are seen throughout the nuclear table of isotopes .",
    "most of these have no direct explanation in terms of mean - field sp states and contain more complicated components , involving 2p1h/2h1p configurations and beyond .",
    "jennings and escher have shown that different definitions of the overlap wave function can be given that completely describe the sp motion inside the nuclear medium .",
    "although , each of them sample the pauli correlations in a different way , resulting in very different normalizations of the amplitudes of weak states  @xcite .",
    "this may have important consequences for the reliability of spectroscopic factors extracted from proton emission and pick - up / stripping reactions  @xcite .",
    "the above results suggest that the main impediment for further improvements of the description of the experimental spectral strength is associated with the deficiencies of the rpa ( drpa ) description of the excited states .",
    "one important problem is the appearance of at most one collective phonon for a given @xmath45 combination while several low - lying isoscalar @xmath29 and @xmath46 excited states are observed at low energy in @xmath0 , as well as additional @xmath41 and @xmath43 states .",
    "a possible way to proceed would be to first concentrate on an improved description of the collective phonons by extending the rpa to explicitly include the coupling to two - particle@xmath47two - hole ( 2p2h ) states .",
    "such an extended rpa procedure has been applied in heavier nuclei with considerable success  @xcite . in order to be relevant for @xmath0 ,",
    "this approach requires an extension in which the coherence of the 2p2h states is included in the form of the presence of two - phonon excitations  @xcite .",
    "this correspond to adding two - phonon configurations to the kernel of the bse for the ph propagator  ( [ eq : pi ] ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2pierpa ]  @xcite .",
    "we note that there has been a tremendous progress in recent years in the microscopic description of _ p _ shell nuclei using green s function monte carlo and no - core shell model methods  @xcite .",
    "a possible application of the no - core shell model to @xmath48 would properly include the 4p4h effects relevant for describing the spectrum of @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "however the description of spectroscopic factors will require the construction of effective operators to include the effects of short - range correlations on these quantities whereas they are automatically included in the scgf method .",
    "whence the interest in studying the spectrum of @xmath0 with the present method .",
    "the formalism to include two - phonon configurations has been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it is referred as two - phonon extended rpa ( erpa ) . in this work",
    "the ph - drpa equation has been solved first , using the self - consistent sp propagator derived in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] .",
    "the lowest drpa solutions for both the @xmath29 , @xmath41 and @xmath43 channels were shifted down to their relative experimental energies and then they were employed to generate the two - phonon contributions for the erpa calculation .",
    "the spectrum obtained for @xmath0 is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig:2pierpa_3 g ] and table  [ tab:2pierpa_3 g ] together the total ph strength @xmath49 of each state , @xmath50 table  [ tab:2pierpa_3 g ] also reposts the relative occupation of ph and two - phonon admixtures in the wave function for each solution of the erpa equation .",
    "the results yield an isoscalar @xmath29 state with a predominant ph character at @xmath4417  mev , as it was found in drpa .",
    "although this solution is now characterized by a partial mixing with two - phonon configurations .",
    "table  [ tab:2pierpa_3 g ] shows that this is the result of mixing with the lowest solution in the same channel , which ends up at @xmath4411  mev .",
    "the latter is predominately a two - phonon state .",
    "it is also seen that in both cases the relevant configuration comes from the coupling of two @xmath29 phonons themselves . the calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite have shown that the bulk of the 4p4h contributions to the first excited state of @xmath48 may come from the coupling of four different phonons with negative parity ( @xmath41 and @xmath43 ) .",
    "however , the self - consistent role of coupling positive parity states was not considered in that work .",
    "both this effect , the rpa correlations and the inclusion of the nuclear fragmentation allow for the at least partial inclusion of configurations beyond the 2p2h case even when no more than two - phonon coupling is considered , as in this paper .",
    "a study of the importance of three- and four - phonon configurations will be addressed in the future .",
    "the low - lying negative parity isoscalar states ( @xmath41 and @xmath43 ) are only slightly affected by two - phonon contributions and remain substantially above the experimental energy at 9.23 and 10.90  mev , respectively , and more correlations will be needed in order to lower their energy .",
    "we note that these wave functions contain a two - phonon admixture obtained by coupling the low - lying @xmath29 excitation to either the @xmath41 or @xmath43 phonons .",
    "according to the above interpretation of the first @xmath29 excited state this corresponds to the inclusion of 3p3h and beyond . at the same time two additional negative parity solutions , with two - phonon character , are found at higher energy in accordance with experiment .",
