    "it is widely known that an observer measuring the speed of an object passing by , measures not its actual linear velocity by the angular one .",
    "for example , if we stay not far away from a railroad , watching a train approaching us from far away at a constant speed , we first perceive the train not moving at all , when it is really far , but when the train comes closer , it appears to us moving faster and faster , and when it actually passes us , its visual speed is maximized .",
    "this observation is the first building block of our proof of innocence . to make this proof rigorous",
    ", we first consider the relationship between the linear and angular speeds of an object in the toy example where the object moves at a constant linear speed .",
    "we then proceed to analyzing a picture reflecting what really happened in the considered case , that is , the case where the linear speed of an object is not constant , but what is constant instead is the deceleration and subsequent acceleration of the object coming to a complete stop at a point located closest to the observer on the object s linear trajectory .",
    "finally , in the last section , we consider what happens if at that critical moment the observer s view is briefly obstructed by another external object .",

    "specifically , @xmath0 , instead of moving at constant linear speed  @xmath26 , first decelerates at constant deceleration  @xmath29 , then comes to a complete stop at  @xmath4 , and finally accelerates with the same constant acceleration  @xmath29 .    in this case ,",
