    "pattern formation is one of the recurrent research themes which covers both classical and quantum systems . on the side of classical systems",
    ", it extends over a wide set of topics such as thermal convection in fluids , taylor - couette flows , emergence of patterns in solidification fronts , chemical reactions and excitable biological media , to name only the most prominent examples ( see @xcite for a detailed review ) , while on the side of quantum systems , one of the most important research directions concerns ultracold quantum gases .",
    "there is a long list of recent developments on the emergence and dynamics of nonlinear wave - forms in ultracold quantum gases both from the theoretical @xcite and experimental perspective ( see @xcite respectively for a comprehensive treatment of the subject ) , of which we mention the experiments on faraday waves in @xmath0rb bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) @xcite and @xmath1he cells @xcite , and those on the collective modes of a @xmath2li bec and its subsequent granulation @xcite .",
    "these experiments paved the way for a series of theoretical investigations dedicated to the emergence of density waves ( e.g. , faraday and resonant ) in condensates with short - range @xcite and dipolar @xcite interactions , in collisionally inhomogeneous condensates @xcite , fermi - bose mixtures , superfluid fermi gases @xcite , etc .",
    ", as well as the suppression of faraday waves and density excitations in general by means of space- and time - modulated potentials @xcite .",
    "the effects of disorder @xcite and interplay with quantum fluctuations @xcite still remain to be explored .",
    "to understand the appeal that pattern - forming modulational instabilities and the ensuing density waves have exerted in the ultracold gases community , one has to contrast the almost unprecedented level of experimental control seen in ultracold gases with that commonly seen in classical fluids . in a way",
    ", ultracold gases in general and becs in particular , have become the ideal testbed for nonlinear waves due to the control over the geometry of the experimental setup ( through various magnetic and/or optical traps ) , the tunability of the effective nonlinearity of the system ( using the magnetic and optical feshbach resonances detailed below ) and the accuracy of the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) which describes the dynamics of the condensate at zero temperature .",
    "thanks to the experimental development of techniques for magnetic and optical feshbach resonances , it was possible to probe the so - called collisionally inhomogeneous regime ( a term coined in @xcite ) , which is characterised by spatial variations in the strength of the two - body interactions .",
    "magnetic feshbach resonances have a longer history than their optical siblings , with significant experimental results on the formation of ultracold molecules , the bec - bcs crossover , and the production of efimov trimer states . despite these results , this method is not particularly useful to reach the collisionally inhomogeneous regime because the length scale for application of the feshbach field is usually larger than the characteristic size of the condensate .",
    "optical feshbach resonances have been shown , however , to generate spatial variations of the scattering length on the scale of hundred nanometers ( see , for instance , @xcite ) and are , therefore , the preferred method of choice . among the numerous experimental protocols used to reach the collisionally inhomogeneous regime ,",
    "we refer to that described in @xcite where it was shown that under specific experimental conditions , a gaussian optical field can impart a similar spatial profile to the two - body interaction .    in this paper",
    "we focus on pattern - forming modulational instabilities in binary cigar - shaped collisionally - inhomogeneous bose - einstein condensates and show by extensive numerical calculations that , as the binary collisions get localised at the centre of the underlying magnetic trap , the system reaches an effectively linear regime .",
    "the two non - miscible configurations typical for binary cigar - shaped condensates ( namely the segregated and the symbiotic ) now turn into a miscible configuration in which the two components overlap with each other and the individual wave functions are close to two gaussians .",
    "moreover , the excitation of density waves of faraday and resonant type by means of periodic modulation of the radial component strength of the magnetic trap is substantially slowed down , as one can easily see from the instability onset times . due to the complex structure of the wave function",
    ", we observe that the usual variational approach provides very limited analytical insight into the dynamics of the system and therefore report only numerical results obtained from the gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "the rest of the manuscript is structured as follows : in section [ numerics ] we present the numerical treatment of the gross - pitaevskii equation , in section [ statics ] we show the stationary configurations of the system and the transition to a miscible configuration , while in section [ dynamics ] we present in detail the dynamics of the condensate .",
    "finally , in section [ conclusions ] we gather our concluding remarks .",
    "many of the theoretical investigations into the properties of becs mentioned in the previous section rely on an accurate numerical treatment of the mean - field gpe . for the ground state of a two - component bec system",
    ", it reads @xmath3 while the dynamics is determined by @xmath4 where @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is the fixed number of atoms in the component @xmath7 .",
    "the number of atoms is fixed in equations by introducing the lagrange multipliers @xmath8 , which represent the nonlinear analogues of the eigenenergies . for simplicity",
    ", we use natural units @xmath9 in all equations shown throughout the paper , and the component wavefunction normalisation is taken to be @xmath10 the strength of the nonlinearities @xmath11 and @xmath12 are proportional to the corresponding intra- and inter - component @xmath13wave scattering lengths , which can be engineered to be spatially inhomogeneous using optical feshbach resonances ( as was demonstrated in @xcite ) .    in this paper , we consider two hyperfine states of @xmath0rb ( referred here as states a and b ) in an external harmonic trapping potential of the form @xmath14 where @xmath15 , such that the system and component wave functions are cylindrically symmetric , i.e. , @xmath16 we also assume that the system is strongly confined in radial direction , i.e. , @xmath17 and that the scattering length is spatially modulated only in the radial direction , such that the nonlinear interactions have the form @xmath18 @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 represent the constant @xmath22-wave scattering lengths for intra- and inter - component collisions respectively along the @xmath23-axis , and @xmath24 is the length scale of the spatial modulation of the scattering length in the radial direction . here",
    ", we use the experimentally observed values for the scattering lengths from @xcite : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the bohr radius .",
    "the numerical treatment of the gpe gradually developed into a research direction in its own right and now fast and accurate numerical algorithms exist for calculation of the ground and excited states of becs using imaginary - time propagation @xcite , as well as explicit finite - difference scheme @xcite , time - splitting spectral methods @xcite , methods based on expansion of the condensate wave function in terms of the solutions of the harmonic oscillator which characterises the magnetic trap @xcite , symplectic shooting method @xcite , etc . a popular package of codes ( available in fortran and c @xcite programming languages , including parallelised versions in mpi and cuda ) has proven to be particularly useful , as it provides the stationary states and the nonlinear dynamics of one- , two- and three - dimensional becs .",
    "the c codes , in particular , are openmp - parallelised such that the execution time decreases substantially ( typically by an order of magnitude ) compared to serial ones , even on a modern desktop computer , when all available cpu cores are used by the programme .    in our _ in silico _",
    "experiments , we use the adapted codes from @xcite for a system with @xmath27 atoms in the state a and @xmath28 atoms in the state b , loaded into a quasi - one - dimensional magnetic trap with frequencies @xmath29 hz and @xmath30 hz . the ground state of the system is computed numerically using the method of imaginary - time propagation considering the scattering lengths given in equation ( [ scval ] ) .",
    "this method relies on the change of variable @xmath31 , which transforms the gpe into a nonlinear diffusion equation . using the standard renormalisation of wavefunctions to unity after each time step , which is necessary",
    "since the imaginary - time propagation does not conserve unitarity , we converge to a ground state of the system whose energy is a local minimum .    at first",
    ", we determine the ground state of a single condensate component with the constant @xmath22-wave scattering length @xmath32 , and calculate its radial width . for this quantity",
    ", we obtain the value @xmath33 @xmath34 , which then serves as a reference length scale for expressing the value of the inhomogeneity parameter @xmath24 in equations ( [ sclena ] ) and ( [ sclenb ] ) .",
    "afterwards , we turn to the full two - component system with the interaction parameters specified in equation ( [ scval ] ) , calculate its ground state and study the dynamics for various values of the inhomogeneity parameter @xmath24 . for each configuration under consideration , we numerically observe the dynamics of the condensate subject to the parametric modulation of the radial trap frequency @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 represent the modulation amplitude and the corresponding frequency .",
    "two - component bec systems with short - range contact interactions can be either miscible or non - miscible , depending on the relationship between their intra- and inter - component scattering lengths .",
    "in general , if the condition @xmath38 is satisfied , the system turns to be non - miscible , with the two components clearly separated @xcite . otherwise , the system is miscible , and the components have a significant overlap .",
    "this is possible only when the inter - component interaction is smaller than the intra - component ones , which means that mixing of the components is energetically favoured . in our case ,",
    "the above condition is satisfied , and the system is expected to be non - miscible .",
    "when such a system is loaded into a quasi - one - dimensional trap , it can exhibit one of two possible types of stationary non - miscible configurations @xcite : a segregated one , in which the two components face each other , and a symbiotic one , in which one component effectively traps the other , forming a structure akin to a bright - dark soliton molecule . depending on the interaction strengths and their relationship ,",
    "one of these configurations is a ground state , and the other is an excited state . for the system we are considering",
    ", the symbiotic pair represents a ground state , and the segregated state is an excited state . using various initial conditions and the methods described above , we are able to numerically compute both",
    "the above mentioned non - miscible configurations .    moreover , as we will see in this section , our numerical results show that for a two - body scattering length modulated spatially , the aforementioned non - miscible configurations can change their character and become miscible .",
    "in particular , as the scattering length gets localised around the centre of the underlying magnetic trap , the two components of the condensate start to have significant overlap and eventually reach a miscible state ( in which the wavefunctions of both components are very close to a gaussian ) when the spatial profile of the scattering length reaches a delta - function - like profile . to understand this transition to miscibility",
    ", we should recall that as the scattering length gets more and more localised , i.e. , the parameter @xmath24 decreases , the effective nonlinearity of the system decreases as well .",
    "this is transparent from the expressions for the effective nonlinearities : @xmath39 @xmath40 please note that the effective nonlinear interaction depends quadratically on @xmath24 .",
    "this means that for smaller values of @xmath24 , the nonlinear effect fades out and the condensate reaches an effective linear regime .",

    "we observe that in the symbiotic state , the maximal densities of both components are larger for the weak inhomogeneity ( large @xmath24 ) than for the strong inhomogeneity ( small @xmath24 ) .",

    "as the inhomogeneity increases , the components become more miscible , the amount of effective available physical space per component increases , and the maximal densities become smaller . in the case of segregated stationary state , we observe a reversal of the above phenomenon that can be attributed to a different shape of the two components and the squeezing due to the increasing inhomogeneity ( smaller @xmath24 ) , which in this case makes the effective available physical space smaller as the inhomogeneity increases .",

    "as can be seen in figure [ 250-segws - vis ] , the emergence time of the faraday waves again varies as the inhomogeneity is changed . for weak collisional inhomogeneity ,",
    "the faraday waves are visible after around 150 - 200  ms , i.e. , twice as much than for the resonant modulation . in the case of strong collisional inhomogeneity ,",
    "the faraday waves emerge after 200 - 250  ms , which represents only a slight increase , due to a same reason as in the resonant case .",
    "finally , figure [ 250-seg ] shows the spatial period of faraday waves as a function of the inhomogeneity control parameter @xmath24 .",
    "if we compare figures [ 160-period ] , [ 250-period ] and figures [ 160-seg ] , [ 250-seg ] , we see that the spatial period of density waves in both components are quite similar for weak spatial inhomogeneity for both symbiotic and segregated states , respectively .",
    "summing up , we have shown through extensive numerical simulations that binary condensates in the so - called collisionally inhomogeneous regime can reach an effectively linear regime in which nonlinear effects fade out as the collisions become localised at the centre of the magnetic trap .",
    "this behaviour is independent of their intrinsic configuration ( i.e. , either symbiotic or segregated ) and can be most easily seen in the increase of the instability onset times of faraday and resonant waves , and the transition to miscibility .",
    "moreover , we have observed that , in addition to longer instability onset times , the spatial periods of resonant and faraday waves decrease as the inhomogeneity becomes stronger . to excite resonant waves we used a driving frequency equal to the radial frequency of the trap , while for faraday waves we used an off - resonance driving frequency which is in - between the radial frequency of trap and its first harmonic .",
    "we stress that in reaching the aforementioned effectively linear regime , the two topologically different configurations , the segregated and the symbiotic ones , exhibit some quantitative differences .",
    "the changes in the spatial structure of the two - body interactions impact more significantly the symbiotic states than the segregated ones . inspecting figures [ 160-ws - vis ] , [ 250-ws - vis ] , [ 160-segws - vis ] , and [ 250-segws - vis ] , one notices that , close to the linear regime , both the faraday and the resonant waves emerge slower for symbiotic states than for segregated ones due to a longer instability onset time and stronger fluctuations in the pattern visibility function .",
    "this should be contrasted with the regime of homogeneous nonlinearity in which the two types of waves have very similar instability onset times .",
    "we also observe that both stationary immiscible configurations typical for binary cigar - shaped condensates with constant short - range interactions gradually turn into a perfectly miscible configuration as the spatial profile of the scattering length gets closer to a delta - function , with the wave functions of the two components reaching an almost gaussian - like functions .",
    "this suggests that the inhomogeneity of the binary collisions can be used experimentally as an efficient tool to control the level of miscibility in the configurations of two - species becs .",

    "all presented numerical results were obtained by solving the corresponding coupled gross - pitaevskii equations in three spatial dimensions , which effectively reduce to a two - dimensional problem due to cylindrical symmetry of the system .",

    "the stability of all numerical results was carefully checked and these discretization parameters were found to be sufficiently small to ensure full reliability and reproducibility of the obtained results .    using the numerically obtained results for the radially integrated density profiles during the real - time evolution of the system with harmonically modulated radial trapping frequency , we have calculated spatial periods of resonant and faraday density patterns approximately 50  ms after their emergence .",
    "since driving of the system eventually destroys it due to continual pumping of the energy into it , the presented results for spatial periods correspond to behaviour of the system during experimentally relevant 100 - 200  ms after the onset of density patterns . due to violent dynamics in the resonant case ,",
    "numerically calculated spatial periods of density patterns in such a way may be valid in a shorter time - frame .",
