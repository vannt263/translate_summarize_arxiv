    "we only consider one- and two - body mean values , so the general form of such an inequality is @xmath138 where @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "we now restrict ourselves to bell inequalities which are symmetric under exchange of parties , i.e. @xmath141 and @xmath142 . after defining the symmetrized correlators @xmath143",
    "symmetric inequalities can be expressed as @xmath144    we are interested in cases for which the coefficients are @xmath15 ( @xmath145 ) and @xmath146 .",

    "we prove the claim above .",
    "one of the most important properties of a local theory is its equivalence to a mixture of deterministic local theory .",
    "that is why , by considering only deterministic theories , there is no loss of generality .",
    "we can therefore assume that a measurement @xmath10 will lead to an outcome @xmath149 with probability @xmath150 , i.e. @xmath151 . the two - body correlators @xmath152 can thus be expressed as @xmath153 . by also taking the antisymmetry of @xmath58 into account , and introducing the quantities @xmath154 ^ 2 \\ , .",

    ". therefore we introduce variables counting the strategies chosen by the parties . because there are @xmath9 measurements with binary outcomes ,",
    "the number of possible strategies per party is @xmath156 .",
    "we define the following @xmath156 variables : @xmath157 where @xmath30 denotes the set cardinality . for example",

    "@xmath160 is the number of parties following the opposite strategy .",
    "variables with @xmath36 indices thus correspond to a strategy for which either exactly @xmath36 of the @xmath9 outcomes are @xmath35 or exactly @xmath36 of the outcomes are @xmath45 , i.e. @xmath36 outcomes differ from the rest .",
    "note that the conjugate variables in the case of @xmath62 indices are set to zero for the case of even @xmath9 in order to prevent strategies from being counted twice .",
    "since every party has to choose one strategy , the variables sum up to @xmath4 , i.e. @xmath161    note that @xmath162 can be expressed in terms of the strategy variables as follows : @xmath163      equation results in the following representation of @xmath37 : @xmath166 clearly , a variable only appears in this expression if @xmath167 , i.e. if the strategy is such that the outcome of the @xmath168 measurement differs from the @xmath169 .",
    "this , for example , can not be the case if the number of indices is zero , i.e. if all measurement outcomes are the same .",
    "so @xmath75 and @xmath170 do not show up in @xmath37 . with the help of the introduced strategy variables",

    "we thus have @xmath178 assume now that the above inequality is violated , i.e. @xmath179 .    @xmath180 for @xmath179 values of @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath181 the strategy @xmath182 has @xmath183 differing outcomes .",
    "this is a contradiction to the definition of the strategy .",

    "<S> we start by deriving multipartite bell inequalities involving an arbitrary number of measurement settings , two outcomes per party and one- and two - body correlators only . based on these inequalities , </S>",
    "<S> we then build up improved witnesses able to detect bell - correlated states in many - body systems using two collective measurements only . </S>",
    "<S> these witnesses can potentially detect bell correlations in states with an arbitrarily low amount of spin squeezing . </S>",
    "<S> we then establish an upper bound on the statistics needed to convincingly conclude that a measured state is bell - correlated .    </S>",
    "<S> [ [ introduction ] ] introduction  </S>",
    "<S> + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    physics research fundamentally relies on the proper analysis of finite experimental data . in this exercise , </S>",
    "<S> assumptions play a subtle but crucial role . on the one hand </S>",
    "<S> , they are needed in order to reach a conclusion ; even device - independent assessments rely on assumptions  @xcite . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , they open the door for undesirable effects ranging from a reduction of the conclusion s scope , when more assumptions are used than strictly needed , to biased results when relying on unmet assumptions . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to popular belief , such cases are frequent in science , even for common assumptions  @xcite . relying on fewer hypotheses , when possible , is thus desirable to obtain more general , accurate and trustworthy conclusions  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> bell nonlocality , as revealed by the violation of a bell inequality , constitutes one of the strongest forms of non - classicality known today . </S>",
    "<S> however , its demonstration has long been restricted to systems involving few particles  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , the discovery of multipartite bell inequalities that only rely on one- and two - body correlators opened up new possibilities  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although these inequalities have not yet lead to the realization of a multipartite bell test , they can be used to derive witnesses able to detect bell correlated states , i.e. states capable of violating a bell inequality .    </S>",
    "<S> using such a witness , an experiment recently detected the presence of bell correlations in a many - body system under the assumption of gaussian statistics  @xcite . while this demonstration uses spin squeezed states , the detection of bell correlations in other systems was also recently investigated  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> the witness used in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite involves one- and two - body correlation functions and takes the form @xmath0 , where the inequality is satisfied by measurements on states that are not bell - correlated . </S>",
    "<S> observation of a negative value for @xmath1 then leads to the conclusion that the measured system is bell - correlated . </S>",
    "<S> however , due to the statistics loophole  @xcite , reaching such a conclusion in the presence of finite statistics requires special care . in particular , an assessment of the probability with which a non - bell - correlated state could be responsible for the observed data is required before concluding about the presence of bell correlations without further assumptions .    concretely , the witness of refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite has the property of admitting a quantum violation lower - bounded by a constant @xmath2 , while the largest possible value @xmath3 is achievable by a product state and increases linearly with the size of the system @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> these properties imply that a small number of measurements on a state of the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 is small , is likely to produce a negative estimate of @xmath1 , even though the state is not detected by the witness in the limit of infinitely many measurement rounds  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this state thus imposes a lower bound on the number of measurements required to exclude , through such witnesses , all non - bell - correlated states with high confidence . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to other assessments , this lower bound increases with the number of particles involved in the many - body system . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is not captured by the standard deviation of one- and two - body correlation functions ( which on the contrary decreases as the number of particles increases ) .    </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noting that states of the form   put similar bounds on the number of measurements required to perform any hypothesis tests in a many - body system satisfying the conditions above . </S>",
    "<S> this includes in particular tests of entanglement  @xcite based on the entanglement witnesses of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    in this article </S>",
    "<S> , we address this statistical problem in the case of bell correlation detection by providing a number of measurement rounds sufficient to exclude non - bell - correlated states from an observed witness violation . </S>",
    "<S> let us mention that in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the statistics loophole is circumvented by the addition of an assumption on the set of local states being tested . </S>",
    "<S> this has the effect of reducing the scope of the conclusion : the data reported in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , are only able to exclude a subset of all non - bell - correlated states ( as pointed out in the reference ) . here </S>",
    "<S> , we show that such additional assumptions are not required in experiments on many - body systems , and thus argue that they should be avoided in the future .    in order to minimize the amount of statistics required to reach our conclusion , we start by investingating improved bell correlation witnesses . for this </S>",
    "<S> , we first derive bell inequalities with two - body correlators and an arbitrary number of settings . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to obtain bell - correlation witnesses that are more resistant to noise compared to the one known to date  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we then analyse the statistical properties of these witnesses and provide an upper bound on the number of measurement rounds needed to rule out all local states in a many - body system . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this upper bound is linear in the number of particles , hence making the detection of bell correlations free of the statistical loophole possible in systems with a large number of particles .    </S>",

    "<S> , it is clear that a variable with @xmath36 indices only appears in the difference @xmath37 if @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> but the corresponding strategy only has @xmath36 differing outcomes and each correlator in this term only appears once , so a variable with @xmath36 indices appears in at most @xmath36 of these differences . moreover , if it appears , it does so with a factor @xmath39 . </S>",
