    "@xcite have recently discovered two new satellites of pluto , s/2005 p1 ( hereafter p1 ) and s/2005 p2 ( hereafter p2 ) , from images taken with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) .",
    "these are the first new satellites of pluto since the discovery of charon in 1978 @xcite .",
    "the new satellites are much fainter and hence much smaller than charon ( whose diameter @xmath2 ; e.g. , @xcite ) , with the diameter of p1 @xmath3@xmath4 km depending on the geometric albedo , and p2 about @xmath5 smaller than p1 .",
    "since the discovery data consist of only two epochs separated by three days in may 2005 , @xcite were unable to determine the orbits of p2 and p1 , but the data are consistent with the orbits of p2 and p1 being nearly circular and nearly coplanar with that of pluto - charon , with orbital periods of @xmath6days for p2 and @xmath7days for p1 .",
    "@xcite have used the same hst observations to place constraints on the existence of any additional satellites of pluto .",
    "prior to the discovery of p2 and p1 , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter bgyys ) have obtained hst images of the pluto system in a series of 12 visits from june 2002 to june 2003 for the purpose of producing an albedo map of pluto .",
    "bgyys were able to detect charon in individual frames and p2 and p1 by stacking the images taken during each visit .",
    "bgyys fit this data , together with the data for charon from @xcite and the data for p2 and p1 from @xcite , by assuming that all three satellites are on unperturbed keplerian orbits .",
    "the best - fit keplerian orbital parameters found by bgyys and their 1-@xmath8 errors are reproduced in table [ table1 ] .",
    "the best - fit orbit of charon relative to pluto is consistent with zero eccentricity , and bgyys pointed out that the nonzero eccentricity reported by @xcite is probably due to the use of an imprecise center of body of pluto in the earlier paper .",
    "the parameters in table [ table1 ] show that the orbits of p2 and p1 are indeed nearly circular and nearly coplanar with that of pluto - charon .",
    "because p2 and p1 are much smaller than pluto and charon , they orbit about a point that is very close to the center of mass of pluto and charon .",
    "thus one of the fitting parameters is the mass ratio of charon - pluto , and bgyys found @xmath9 .",
    "two results from the orbit - fitting suggest that unperturbed keplerian orbits are not good assumptions for the orbits of p2 and p1 .",
    "the orbital period @xmath10 and semimajor axis @xmath11 of each orbit are independent parameters in the fits by bgyys .",
    "if we assume that kepler s third law is valid for all of the orbits , each orbit yields an independent measurement of the total mass of pluto - charon .",
    "bgyys found @xmath12 kg from charon s orbit , @xmath13 kg from p2 s orbit , and @xmath14 kg from p1 s orbit . instead of @xmath15 in converting from @xmath16 to @xmath17 .",
    "] the values of @xmath17 from p2 and p1 disagree with that from charon at the 2.1-@xmath8 and 3.2-@xmath8 levels , respectively .",
    "as we shall see , the discrepancies are in fact due to the deviation from kepler s third law for p2 and p1 . because of the rather large mass ratio of charon - pluto , the deviations of the gravitational potential from that of a point mass and , consequently , of the orbits of p2 and p1 from keplerian orbits",
    "are nontrivial , even if p2 and p1 can be treated as test particles .",
    "the second result from the orbit - fitting that suggests non - keplerian orbits for p2 and p1 is the confirmation of the result of @xcite that the orbital periods of charon , p2 , and p1 are nearly in the ratio 1:4:6 .",
    "this means that the orbits of p2 and p1 could be strongly affected by resonant or near - resonant interactions .",
    "as we shall see , the strongest effects come from the proximity of p2 and p1 to the 3:2 mean - motion commensurability , which is the lowest order commensurability among the satellites , even though p2 and p1 are much smaller than charon",
    ".    in section 2 we present an analytic theory for the orbits of p2 and p1 that is valid in the limit that the satellites have negligible masses and can be treated as test particles .",
    "it shows that the motion can be represented by the superposition of the circular motion of a guiding center , the forced oscillations due to the non - axisymmetric components of the potential rotating at the mean motion of pluto - charon , the epicyclic motion , and the vertical motion .",
    "it also gives analytic results for the deviation from kepler s third law and the periapse and nodal precession rates . in section 3",
    "we present direct numerical orbit integrations with different assumed masses for p2 and p1 within the ranges allowed by the uncertainties in the albedos .",
    "the numerical results are compared to the analytic theory in section 2 , and the increasing importance of the proximity to the 3:2 commensurability with increasing masses is examined .",
    "in fact , for the maximum masses corresponding to the lowest expected albedos , p2 and p1 may be in the 3:2 mean - motion resonance , with the resonance variable involving the periapse longitude of p1 librating . in section 4",
    "we summarize our results and discuss the prospects for detecting non - keplerian behaviors and putting constraints on the masses of p2 and p1 with existing and future observations .",
    "in this section we develop an analytic theory for the orbits of the satellites p2 and",
    "p1 that is valid in the limit that the satellites have negligible masses and can be treated as test particles .",
    "the latest orbital fit show that the orbit of charon relative to pluto is consistent with zero eccentricity ( see table [ table1 ] ) .",
    "thus we assume that the orbit of charon relative to pluto is keplerian and circular , with semimajor axis @xmath18 and mean motion ( or circular frequency ) @xmath19^{1/2}$ ] , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the masses of pluto and charon , respectively . in a cylindrical coordinate system with the origin at the center of mass of the pluto - charon system and the @xmath22 plane being the orbital plane of pluto - charon ,",

    "( bgyys included in their unperturbed keplerian fits the discovery data for p2 and p1 from @xcite , which were taken two years after the last observation of bgyys , but the discovery data have larger errors and may not be useful in constraining parameters other than the orbital periods . )",
    "if the albedos of p2 and p1 are high and of order of that of charon , the masses of p2 and p1 are sufficiently low that their orbits are well described by the analytic theory .",

    "thus , there is at present no evidence that p2 has any significant epicyclic eccentricity , and it is likely that the periapse precession of p2 would be difficult to measure . on the other hand , the orbit of p1 has a significant epicyclic eccentricity . over the 1-year time span of the existing data , the prograde precession of @xmath220 with a period of @xmath1days ( fig .",

    "there are no apparent effects due to the respective proximity of p2 and p1 to the high - order 4:1 and 6:1 mean - motion commensurabilities with charon .",
    "however , @xcite have proposed that p2 and p1 may have been trapped in the corotation resonances at these commensurabilities ( i.e. , those associated with the resonance variable @xmath255 for p2 and @xmath256 for p1 ) during the tidal expansion of charon s orbit , if charon formed with large orbital eccentricity from a giant impact on pluto .",
    "p2 and p1 escaped from the corotation resonances when charon s orbital eccentricity was tidally damped to very small value .",
