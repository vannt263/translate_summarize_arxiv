    "the search for the higgs boson is one of the primary objectives of present and future colliders .",
    "once the higgs boson has been discovered , it will be important to measure its couplings to fermions and to gauge bosons .",
    "these couplings are completely determined in the standard model and the process @xmath4 provides a direct mechanism for measuring the @xmath5 yukawa coupling . since this coupling can be significantly different in a supersymmetric model from that in the standard model , the measurement would provide a means of discriminating between different models .",
    "the associated production of a higgs boson with a top quark pair in @xmath2 collisions has a small rate , around @xmath6 for @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "however , the signature , @xmath9 is distinctive and a precise measurement may be possible .",
    "a similar reaction in the @xmath10 quark system , @xmath11 , is suppressed in the standard model due to the smallness of the @xmath12 yukawa coupling . in a supersymmetric model , however , this coupling can be enhanced for large values of the parameter @xmath13 .",
    "in addition , a supersymmetric model contains resonant contributions not present in the standard model such as , for example , the process @xmath14 .    in order to extract the yukawa couplings , precise predictions for the rates , including qcd corrections , are necessary .",
    "the qcd corrections to the associated production of a higgs boson with a heavy quark pair have been computed by two groups@xcite and are the subject of this note .",
    "the standard model cross section for @xmath15 occurs through both @xmath16 channel photon and @xmath16 channel @xmath17 exchange.@xcite .",
    "the most relevant contributions are those in which the higgs boson is emitted from a top quark leg , which are directly proportional to the @xmath18 yukawa coupling .",
    "the contribution when the higgs boson is emitted from the @xmath17 boson is always less than a few per cent at @xmath19  gev and can safely be neglected .",
    "in addition , at @xmath7 , the photon exchange contribution provides the bulk of the cross section .",
    "the @xmath3 inclusive cross section for @xmath20 receives contributions from real gluon emission from the final quark legs ,    e^+ e^-t t hg , and also from virtual gluon contributions to the lowest order process .",
    "the real gluon emission is separated into a hard and a soft contribution by introducing an arbitary cutoff on the gluon momentum , @xmath21 .",
    "the infrared divergences in the soft gluon emission are then regulated by the introduction of a small gluon mass , @xmath22 . when the one - loop virtual and the real contributions are combined , the final result is finite and independent of both @xmath21 and @xmath22 . in fig .",
    "[ sig500fig ] , we show the various contributions to the total cross section .",
    "@xmath23 is the complete @xmath3 corrected rate , _ 1=_0+_virt+_hard+_soft .",
    "the counterterms are included in @xmath24 .",
    "the combination @xmath25 is independent of the gluon mass , but retains a dependence on @xmath21 which is cancelled by @xmath26 . at @xmath19  gev ,",
    "the corrections are large and positive , significantly increasing the rate .",
    "the corrections are smaller at @xmath27  tev , with large cancellations between the hard and the virtual plus soft contributions .",
    "= 3.5 in    the size of the qcd corrections can be described by a @xmath28 factor ,    k ( ) , [ kdef ]    which is shown in fig .",
    "[ kfac500fig ] .",
    "note that after the cancellation of the ultraviolet divergences , the only @xmath29 dependence is in @xmath30 .",
    "if @xmath31 , then @xmath32 is reduced to @xmath33 from the value @xmath34 obtained with @xmath35 for @xmath7 .",
    "in the minimal supersymmetric model , a top quark pair can be produced in association with either of the neutral higgs bosons , @xmath36 , or with the pseudoscalar , @xmath37 .",
    "the production of the pseudoscalar is highly suppressed and the rate for @xmath38 is less than @xmath39 at @xmath7 for all values of @xmath13 and @xmath40 . the rate for either @xmath41 or @xmath42 is greater than @xmath43 throughout most of the @xmath44 plane and we show this in fig .",
    "[ scanfig ] .",
    "we see that this region includes much of the parameter space .",
    "the results shown in fig .",
    "3 are relatively insensitive to changing the squark masses or the mixing parameters of the supersymmetric sector .",
    "in the standard model , it will be difficult to extract the bottom quark - higgs yukawa coupling from a measurement of @xmath45 , since the coupling itself is tiny and the @xmath17 contribution is important , so that there is a significant dependence on the @xmath46 coupling . in the minimal supersymmetric model , however , there are @xmath47 higgs bosons , @xmath48 , so that additional processes not present in the standard model may be useful to pin down the fermion - higgs boson yukawa couplings@xcite . in addition , for certain values of @xmath13 , the @xmath49 yukawa couplings receive significant enhancements and so the processes @xmath50 may be larger than in the standard model .",
    "the physics for @xmath51 production is significantly different from that of higgs production with a @xmath0 pair . in the case of the @xmath10 quark",
    ", there is a large resonant contribution from the process , @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "this enhancement occurs when @xmath54 and so is relevant for @xmath40 below about @xmath55  gev for @xmath56 .",
    "[ fig : bb_lh_tb40 ] shows the different contributions to the process @xmath57 for @xmath58 at @xmath59  gev .",
    "the curve labelled `` @xmath60 '' is the narrow width approximation to the @xmath37 resonance , while the curve labelled `` @xmath61 '' is only the contribution from the square of the resonant diagram . at small @xmath40 ( @xmath62  gev ) , the narrow width approximation is an excellent approximation to the total rate for this value of @xmath13 . for smaller @xmath13 ,",
    "the narrow width approximation becomes increasingly inaccurate , since the @xmath17 exchange contribution becomes more and more relevant . at large @xmath40 ,",
    "the rate is given predominantly by the @xmath17 boson exchange contribution and is typically between @xmath47 and @xmath63  fb .",
    "= 3.5 in    in the narrow width approximation , the qcd corrections to the rate are trivially included by including the qcd corrections to the pseudo - scalar width .",
    "away from the pseudoscalar resonance , ( large @xmath40 ) , inclusion of the qcd corrections would require a complete calculation , which we do not include in the present analysis since the interesting region is near the resonance where the rate is enhanced .    for heavy higgs production , @xmath64 , the narrow width approximation is an excellent approximation for all values of @xmath13 so the qcd corrections can be accurately included everywhere . for @xmath65 ,",
    "the cross section is larger than @xmath66  fb even for @xmath67  gev . for @xmath68 ,",
    "the rate is greater than @xmath66  fb for @xmath69  gev , as shown in fig .",
    "5 . this process can potentially be used to probe the couplings of the heavier neutral higgs boson and to obtain a precise measurement of the product of the higgs couplings , @xmath70 .",
    "= 3.5 in    we can safely work in the narrow width approximation also for the case of @xmath71 production .",
    "in fact , in this case the contributions of the @xmath72 resonances are completely dominant and the exact cross section can be distinguished from the one obtained using the narrow width approximation only at very high values of @xmath13 . the case @xmath73 is illustrated in fig .   [ fig : bba_tb40 ] .",
    "unlike @xmath74 production , the process @xmath71 is not suppressed relative to @xmath75 production . for @xmath76 ,",
    "the cross secion is aways greater than @xmath77 .",
    "we have computed the @xmath3 corrected rate for @xmath78 . at @xmath19  gev , the corrections are large and positive and this process can be used to measure the @xmath79 yukawa couplings , both in the standard model and over much of the parameter space of the minimal supersymmetric model . in a supersymmetric model ,",
    "the rates for @xmath80 can be enhanced for large values of @xmath13 and relatively small values of @xmath40 . in such models",
    ", the qcd corrections can be accurately included using the narrow width approximation in the region where the scalar or pseudoscalar resonance dominates .",
