    "the orbit of pluto has a number of unusual features . it has the highest eccentricity ( @xmath2 ) and inclination ( @xmath3 ) of any planet in the solar system .",
    "it crosses neptune s orbit and hence is susceptible to strong perturbations during close encounters with that planet .",
    "however , close encounters do not occur because pluto is locked into a 3:2 orbital resonance with neptune , which ensures that conjunctions occur near pluto s aphelion ( @xcite ) .",
    "more precisely , the critical argument @xmath4 librates around @xmath5 with a period of @xmath6 yr and an amplitude of @xmath7 ; here @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the mean longitudes of pluto and neptune and @xmath10 is pluto s longitude of perihelion .",
    "other resonances are present with longer periods : for example , pluto s argument of perihelion librates with an amplitude of @xmath11 and a period of 3.8 myr . in part because of its rich set of resonances , pluto s orbit is chaotic , although it exhibits no large - scale irregular behavior over gyr timescales ( see @xcite for a comprehensive review of pluto s orbit ) . for reference ,",
    "pluto s semimajor axis and orbital period are @xmath12 and @xmath13 yr .",
    "the most compelling explanation for pluto s remarkable orbit was given by malhotra ( 1993 , 1995 ) .",
    "malhotra argues that pluto formed in a low - eccentricity , low - inclination orbit in the protoplanetary disk beyond neptune .",
    "subsequent gravitational scattering and ejection of planetesimals in the disk by all four giant planets caused neptune s orbit to migrate outwards ( @xcite ) . as its orbit expands , neptune s",
    "orbital resonances sweep through the disk , first capturing pluto into the 3:2 resonance and then pumping up its eccentricity .",
    "if pluto s orbit was circular before capture , its present eccentricity implies that it was captured when neptune s semimajor axis was 0.814 times its current value or @xmath14 ( eq . [ eq : renu ] ) . this process may also excite pluto s inclination although the details are less certain ( @xcite ) .",
    "malhotra s argument predicts that most kuiper belt objects with @xmath15 should also be captured  and presently located  in neptune resonances ( @xcite ) .",
    "this prediction has proved to be correct : of the @xmath16 kuiper belt objects with reliable orbits as of 1999 january 1 , over 30% have semimajor axes within 1% of the 3:2 resonance ( although this number is exaggerated by observational selection effects ) .",
    "these objects have come to be called plutinos , since they share the 3:2 resonance with pluto ( see @xcite for a recent review of the kuiper belt ) .",
    "almost all studies of the dynamics of the kuiper belt so far have neglected the gravitational influence of pluto , because of its small mass ( @xmath17 for the pluto - charon system , @xcite ) .",
    "however , like the trojan asteroids and jupiter , or the saturn coorbital satellites janus and epimetheus , pluto and the plutinos share a common semimajor axis and hence even the weak gravitational force from pluto can have a substantial influence on the longitude of a plutino relative to pluto . a crude illustration of the importance of pluto s gravity is to note that the half - width of the 3:2 resonance , @xmath18 for @xmath19 ( the maximum fractional amplitude of stable libration in semi - major axis , @xcite ) , is only a few times larger than the hill radius of pluto , @xmath20 .",
    "the goal of this paper is to explore the dynamical interactions between pluto and plutinos and their consequences for the present structure of the kuiper belt .",
    "section 2 provides an approximate analytical description of the interactions ,  3 describes the results of numerical orbit integrations , and  4 contains a discussion .",
    "we examine a simplified model solar system containing only the sun and neptune , with masses @xmath21 and @xmath22 ; we assume that neptune s orbit is circular and neglect all orbital inclinations .",
    "we describe the motion of the plutino using the canonical variables @xmath23,\\qquad & & y_2=-\\varpi , \\label{eq : canvar}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the semi - major axis and eccentricity , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the mean longitude and longitude of perihelion .",
    "the same variables for neptune or pluto are denoted by adding a subscript `` n '' or `` p '' .    we consider only the resonant perturbations exerted by neptune , which can only depend on angles as an even function of the combination @xmath28 .",
    "thus the hamiltonian of a plutino may be written h_0(,,t)=h_k(x_1)+a(,3y_1 - 2y_n1+y_2)+b(,,t ) , where @xmath29 is the kepler hamiltonian , @xmath30 is the resonant potential from neptune , and @xmath31 is the potential from pluto .",
    "the same hamiltonian describes the motion of pluto if we set @xmath32 .",
    "now impose a canonical transformation to new variables @xmath33 defined by the generating function s(,,t)=j_1(3y_1 - 2y_n1+y_2)+j_2(y_2-y_p2 ) .",
    "thus @xmath34 , @xmath35 , while @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and the new hamiltonian is h(,,t)=h_0+st= h_k(3j_1)-2y_n1j_1-y_p2j_2+a(3j_1,j_1+j_2,w_1)+b , [ eq : ham ] where @xmath38 is the mean motion of neptune and @xmath39 is the apsidal precession rate of pluto .    to proceed",
    "further we make use of the fact that @xmath40 .",
    "thus we can divide the motion of a plutino into `` fast '' and `` slow '' parts .",
    "the fast motion is determined by the kepler hamiltonian @xmath41 and the resonant potential @xmath30 ( this is the opposite of normal usage , where the resonant perturbations from neptune are regarded as `` slow '' compared to non - resonant perturbations ) .",
    "the slow variations are caused by the pluto potential @xmath42 .",
    "first we examine the fast motion .",
    "we drop the potential @xmath42 , so that @xmath43 is ignorable and @xmath44 $ ] is a constant of the motion .",
    "thus if pluto was captured into resonance from a circular orbit with semimajor axis @xmath45 , its present semimajor axis and eccentricity are related by e^2=-(a_i / a)^1/2-(a_i / a ) .",
    "[ eq : renu ]    we write @xmath46 where @xmath47 is chosen to satisfy the resonance condition for the kepler hamiltonian , 2y_n1=3y_1=3 dh_kdx_1 j_1r = x_1r=(gm_)^2/3(18y_n1)^1/3 .",
    "[ eq : chosen ] since @xmath48 we expect @xmath49 , so we can expand @xmath41 to second order in @xmath50 ; dropping unimportant constant terms the fast motion is determined by the hamiltonian @xmath51 the hamiltonian is autonomous and hence has a conserved energy @xmath52 and action @xmath53 .",
    "the motion is along the level surfaces of @xmath54 in the @xmath55 plane and typically consists of either libration ( @xmath56 oscillates between fixed limits ) or circulation ( @xmath56 increases or decreases without reversing ) , just as in the case of the pendulum hamiltonian .",
    "the stable equilibrium solutions ( i.e. zero - amplitude libration ) are given by j_1=a^29(ax_1 + ) , = 0 , < 0 .",
    "[ eq : eq ] the slow motion is determined by averaging the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham ] ) over the fast motion : h_s(j_2,w_2,t)=e_f(j_2)-y_p2j_2+b .",
    "[ eq : hamslow ] here @xmath57 indicates an average over one period of the fast motion .",
    "the fast energy @xmath58 depends on @xmath59 through the constraint that the fast action @xmath60 is adiabatically invariant .",
    "the solutions to the fast and slow equations of motion are particularly simple in the case where the fast libration amplitude is zero for both pluto and the plutino .",
    "this approximation is not particularly realistic ",
    "the libration amplitude of pluto is @xmath7but illustrates the principal features of the plutino motions .    in this case",
    "the fast energy is e_f = a(3j_1r , j_1r+j_2,w_1r ) where @xmath61 is the equilibrium angle given by equation ( [ eq : eq ] ) and we have dropped much smaller terms that are o@xmath62 . for simplicity we shall assume that there is only one stable equilibrium point , that is , one solution to equations ( [ eq : eq ] ) for given @xmath59 . at the equilibrium point the fast action is @xmath63 , and the slow hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamslow ] ) is h_s(j_2,w_2,t)=a(3j_1r , j_1r+j_2,w_1r ) -y_p2j_2 + b(3j_1r , j_1r+j_2,y_1,y_2,t)+(a^2 ) , where @xmath64 . since pluto also is assumed to have zero libration amplitude , @xmath65 .",
    "thus 3(y_p1-y_1)=y_2-y_p2=3w_2 ( 2 ) ; [ eq : resrel ] that is , the difference in longitude of perihelion between pluto and the plutino is three times the difference in mean longitude .",
    "the same result will hold true on average even if the libration amplitudes are non - zero .",
    "now let us assume in addition that the eccentricities of both pluto and the plutino are small .",
    "since their semi - major axes are the same , the gravitational potential from pluto at the plutino may be written b = gm_p(_p|_p|^3 - 1|-_p| ) = gm_pa . using equation ( [ eq : resrel ] )",
    "this simplifies to b = gm_pa(w_2 - 12|w_2| ) .",
    "moreover = ax_2(3j_1r , j_1r+j_p2,w_1r ) + ( a^2 ) ; thus the slow hamiltonian can be rewritten as @xmath66 the interesting behaviour occurs when the actions @xmath59 and @xmath67 are similar ( i.e. the eccentricities of pluto and the plutino are similar ) , so we write @xmath68 and expand @xmath30 to second order in @xmath69 . dropping unimportant constants and terms of o@xmath62 we have h_s(j_2,w_2)=j_2 ^ 2a_22 ( 3j_1r , j_1r+j_p2,w_1r ) + gm_pa(w_2 - 12|w_2| ) .",

    "the torques from the satellite lead to changes in semi - major axis ; for a plutino the semi - major axis is locked to neptune s by the resonance , so torques from pluto lead to changes in the eccentricity instead .",
    "when @xmath74 many of the features of orbits in the slow hamiltonian ( [ eq : tro ] ) follow immediately from the analogy with the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamc ] ) , which has been studied by many authors ( e.g. yoder et al .",

    "the equilibrium solutions correspond to the triangular lagrange points in the coorbital case : @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 ; the eccentricity of the plutino equals the eccentricity of pluto , the mean longitude leads or lags by @xmath78 , and the perihelia are @xmath5 apart",
    ". these solutions are maxima of the potential from pluto . for smaller values of @xmath79 ,",

    "the maximum and minimum values of @xmath85 occur at @xmath86 , and are given by j_2=^1/2 .",
    "[ eq : sep ] eventually the theory breaks down , when @xmath87 is small enough that adiabatic invariance is no longer a valid approximation .      for quantitative applications we must evaluate the resonant neptune potential @xmath88 . for small eccentricities , the potential can be derived analytically , @xmath89 , \\label{eq : anal } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath90 , @xmath91 , b_1/2^(j)()=1_0 ^ 2 dj(1 - 2+^2)^1/2is a laplace coefficient , neptune is assumed to be on a circular orbit , and inclinations are neglected .",
    "unfortunately , in the present case the high eccentricity of the plutino orbits makes this expansion invalid .",

    "orbits of the first kind are similar to pluto s , although with smaller libration amplitude ( compare fig . 4 of @xcite ) .",
    "orbits of the second kind ( fig .",
    "[ fig : corot0 ] ) were discussed by malhotra ( 1996 ) , who calls them `` perihelion librators '' .",
    "we shall not discuss these further , since they do not appear to form naturally during resonance capture of initially circular orbits ; moreover for @xmath101 they are likely to be unstable , since they cross uranus s orbit and thus are subject to close encounters and collisions with that planet .",

[ eq : sep ] ) and the period of libration of small tadpole orbits is @xmath108 yr ( eq . [ eq : freq ] ) .    for our purposes",
    "it is sufficient to work with the following numerical approximation to the resonant potential : f(,w_1)=-|1 - 4.222ew_1| , [ eq : f ] where @xmath109 $ ] .",
    "this approximation is chosen to match the resonant potential at the resonant semimajor axis @xmath110 ; the dependence on the relative semimajor axes of neptune and the plutino is suppressed since the effects of this potential are only important near resonance .",
    "the logarithmic factor is chosen to reproduce the singularity in the resonant potential near the collision orbits defined approximately by equation ( [ eq : coll ] ) .",
    "the approximation formula also matches the analytic formula ( [ eq : anal ] ) to o@xmath111 at @xmath112 .",
    "figure [ fig : conttwo ]  shows the contour plot analogous to figure [ fig : conttwo ]  for the approximate resonant potential @xmath113 , and the triangles in figure [ fig : approx ]  show @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "the agreement is very good , especially considering that errors are amplified by taking the two derivatives required to generate @xmath114 .",
    "we follow the orbital evolution of pluto and a plutino in a simplified version of the sun - neptune - pluto - plutino four - body system that isolates the resonant potential from neptune .",
    "neptune is assumed to have a circular orbit that migrates outward according to the rule ( @xcite ) a_n(t)=a_f - a(-t/ ) , where @xmath115 is neptune s present semimajor axis , @xmath116 , and @xmath117 myr .",
    "thus neptune s initial semimajor axis is @xmath118 and the initial location of the 3:2 orbital resonance is @xmath119 .",
    "the initial eccentricity of pluto is taken to be zero and its initial semimajor axis is @xmath120 , as required so that its present eccentricity matches the observed value ( eq . [ eq : renu ] ) .",

    "pluto and the test particles feel the resonant potential from neptune , as defined by equations ( [ eq : resdef ] ) and ( [ eq : f ] ) , but no other neptune forces .",
    "the effects of the resonant neptune potential on the orbital elements of pluto and the test particles are followed using lagrange s equations .",
    "the test particles do not influence pluto or one another .",
    "however , they are subject to the gravitational potential from pluto , b(,,t)=-gm_p(1|-_p|-_p|_p|^3 ) ; [ eq : b ] the effects of this potential on the orbital elements of the test particles are followed using gauss s equations .    the evolution of pluto and the test particles is followed for 0.45 gyr or 10% of the age of the solar system .",
    "of the 160 test particles , all but 12 are captured into the 3:2 resonance with neptune , in the sense that their final semimajor axes are close to @xmath125 and their eccentricities are near the prediction of equation ( [ eq : renu ] ) , as shown in figure [ fig : renu ] .",
    "the 12 particles that are not captured lie inside the location of neptune s 3:2 resonance at the start of the calculation , @xmath126 , and would presumably be captured into other resonances if we used the full neptune potential to work out their motion .",
    "we have verified this presumption by conducting shorter integrations ( @xmath127 ) using the same initial conditions but the complete neptune potential . in this case",
    "all but 15 of the 160 particles were captured into the 3:2 resonance ; the remainder were captured into the 4:3 , 5:3 or 7:5 resonances .",
    "the behavior of the test particles in the 3:2 resonance ( henceforth plutinos ) falls into the following broad classes :    * tadpole orbits ( 5 particles ) : these have longitude difference @xmath128 and differences in longitude of perihelion @xmath129 that librate around the leading or trailing lagrange point of pluto ( figure [ fig : tadpole ] ) .",
    "( note that the libration center for the orbit in this figure is @xmath130 , not @xmath78 as implied by the analysis in  2.1 .",
    "this discrepancy arises because pluto has a high eccentricity , while our analysis is only valid for near - circular orbits .",
    "similarly , the perihelion difference librates around @xmath131 , three times the difference in mean longitude as required by eq .",
    "[ eq : resrel ] . )",
    "the tadpoles show no evidence of chaotic behavior or secular evolution over the length of our integration .",
    "the analysis in  2.2 suggests that the maximum eccentricity difference for these orbits is @xmath132 ; this requires in turn that their initial semimajor axes must have been close to pluto s , as is seen to be the case in figure [ fig : renu ] . * horseshoe orbits ( 19 particles ) : the longitude difference oscillates around @xmath5 , with jumps in the plutino eccentricity at the extrema of the longitude oscillation , as predicted by the analysis of  2.1 ( figures [ fig : horseshoe1 ] , [ fig : horseshoe2 ] ) .",
    "the motion appears stable over the length of our integration although there are significant variations in semimajor axis oscillations during the course of the integration , and some horseshoes may evolve into transitional orbits over longer time intervals .",
    "* transitional orbits ( 43 particles ) : these show irregular behavior or transitions between libration and circulation of the longitude difference ( figure [ fig : trans ] ) .",
    "when the longitude difference circulates , the particles are no longer protected from close encounters with pluto . however , the particles remain in the 3:2 neptune resonance in the sense that the resonant angle @xmath56 continues to librate .",
    "* doubly transitional orbits ( 2 particles ) : like transitional orbits , these show libration - circulation transitions in the longitude difference , but in addition they show irregular behavior in the resonant angle @xmath56 , leading eventually to a transition of @xmath56 from libration to circulation ( figure [ fig : dtrans ] ) . although only 2 particles in our simulation exhibit this behavior , a number of others show growing amplitude in the @xmath56 libration and will probably move into this class in less than the age of the solar system .",
    "such orbits are normally short - lived since once @xmath56 circulates , they are no longer protected from close encounters with neptune . * irregular circulating orbits ( 17 particles ) : the longitude difference circulates throughout the integration .",
    "pluto induces irregular behavior ( figure [ fig : unaffect2 ] ) , but the neptune resonance is preserved in the sense that @xmath56 continues to librate , at least over the span of our integration . * regular circulating orbits ( 62 particles ) : the longitude difference circulates throughout the integration , but the orbits appear fairly regular ( figure [ fig : unaffect1 ] ) . generally , the orbits with larger eccentricity differences are more regular , because the encounter velocity with pluto is higher so the perturbations from close encounters are smaller .",
    "these classes represent a sequence in eccentricity difference : the typical eccentricity difference @xmath133 is smallest for tadpoles and largest for orbits unaffected by pluto . because the plutino eccentricity is determined by the semimajor axis at the time of resonant capture ( eq . [ eq : renu ] )",
    ", the classes also reflect the initial semimajor axes of the plutinos : the tadpoles and horseshoes all have initial semimajor axes in the range 32.234.2   ( i.e. close to pluto s initial semimajor axis of 33 ) .",
    "the transitional and irregular circulating plutinos mostly have initial semimajor axes in the range 31.736 , and the regular circulating plutinos have initial semimajor axes concentrated in the range 3539 .",
    "test particles captured into the 3:2 neptune resonance ( plutinos ) have a complex range of dynamical interactions with pluto .",
    "the strength of the interaction depends on the difference in eccentricity between the test particle and pluto , and thus on the difference in initial semi - major axis if the initial orbits were circular and capture occurred through outward migration of neptune .",
    "plutinos are stable only if the eccentricity difference @xmath134 is small ( @xmath135 from figure [ fig : renu ] ) , in which case the plutinos librate on tadpole or horseshoe orbits ; or if the eccentricity difference is large ( @xmath136 ) , in which case the longitude difference circulates but relative velocity at encounter is high enough that pluto has little effect .",
    "unstable orbits at intermediate @xmath137 can be driven out of the 3:2 neptune resonance by interactions with pluto , and thereafter are short - lived because of close encounters with neptune .",
    "thus we expect that the population of plutinos has decayed over time , although determining the survival fraction will require integrations over the lifetime of the solar system using the full neptune potential .",
    "the long - term behavior of orbits in the 3:2 neptune resonance is central to the origin of jupiter - family comets .",
    "the usual explanation is that slow chaotic diffusion and collisional kicks drive plutinos out of the 3:2 resonance , after which they are subjected to close encounters with the giant planets and eventually evolve into jupiter - family comets ( @xcite ) .",
    "our results suggest that pluto - induced evolution of plutinos onto neptune - crossing orbits may contribute to or even dominate the flux of jupiter - family comets .",
    "our results also enhance the motivation to obtain accurate orbits for kuiper - belt objects , and fuel speculation that the formation of the pluto - charon binary may be linked to interactions between pluto and plutinos ."
