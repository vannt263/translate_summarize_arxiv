    "the structure of space - time at short length scales is probably the most challenging problem facing modern physics @xcite .",
    "although there seems to be growing consensus that our notion of space - time at the planck length needs major revision , there seems to be much less consensus on the appropriate description of space - time at these length scales .",
    "one scenario , originally proposed by snyder @xcite , is that of non - commutative space - time . although his motivation for this proposal was an attempt to avoid the infinities encountered in quantum field theories , the notion of non - commutative space - time",
    "has recently been revived by the rather compelling arguments of doplicher et al @xcite and the emergence of non - commutative coordinates in the low energy limit of certain string theories @xcite .    since the energies required to probe the planck length scale only occurred in the very early universe",
    ", we do not have any direct empirical data to guide our search for the structure of space - time at the planck length scale .",
    "possible sources of indirect data are the cosmic micro - wave background radiation ( cmb ) , other cosmological phenomena such as dark matter and dark energy , high energy cosmic radiation and cold , dense astro - physical objects such as neutron stars and white dwarfs .",
    "in particular it has been observed before @xcite that the thermodynamic behaviour of two dimensional fermi gases is drastically altered at high densities and low temperatures . as these computations were performed for two dimensional systems , not",
    "much can be inferred about the behaviour of such real physical objects .",
    "this motivates the current paper in which the thermodynamic behaviour of fermi gases in three dimensional non - commutative space is investigated . to avoid the difficulties related to the breaking of rotational symmetry when",
    "the simplest constant commutation relations are assumed for the coordinates @xcite , we rather adopt here fuzzy sphere commutation relations for the coordinates .",
    "the recent solution for the spectrum of the non - commutative three dimensional fuzzy well @xcite is then used to compute the thermodynamics of these gases , confined to a finite volume , in three dimensions .",
    "particular attention is paid to the behaviour of these gases under conditions where non - commutative effects are expected to be relevant , i.e. at high temperatures and in dense , cold fermi gases .",
    "these computations , based on solving the non - commutative schrdinger equation , are still non - relativistic and certainly not realistic for the ultra - relativistic conditions prevailing at high temperatures and in dense astro - physical objects . however , although the non - relativistic description may affect the quantitative behaviour , one does not expect it to alter the qualitative behaviour , such as incompressibility .",
    "we therefore expect to learn a considerable amount about the qualitative behaviour of such systems in a non - relativistic description , which is considerably simpler than the corresponding more realistic , but also much more difficult , relativistic description , which is as yet still lacking .",
    "we do , however , also compute the non - commutative corrections at low densities and temperatures where the non - relativistic approximation is certainly appropriate .",
    "these corrections may offer useful guidance to attempts to observe these phenomena at low energies and densities .    in this paper",
    "the focus falls on fermi gases , where one expects non - commutative effects to be most prominent .",
    "one can , of course , also study the thermodynamics of bose gases , but as one expects non - commutative phenomena to be less prominent there , we postpone this study to a future paper . furthermore , at low densities these gases are essentially classical or boltzmann , where quantum and statistical effects are unimportant , and the non - commutative corrections computed in this limit should show up regardless of whether we consider a bose or fermi gas .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : section [ section 1 ] reviews the basic formulation of quantum mechanics in fuzzy space and the solutions of the infinite fuzzy well . section [ section 2 ] sets up the formalism to study the thermodynamics of the non - commutative fermi gas .",
    "in particular it is demonstrated that a remarkable infra - red / ultraviolet duality in the spectrum results in a similar duality between the low and high density limits of a non - commutative fermi gas .",
    "section [ section 3 ] focuses on the computation of the central thermodynamic quantities , firstly , in the low density , low temperature as well as low density , high temperature limits .",
    "the low / high density duality is then applied to infer from this the behaviour of these quantities in the high density limit .",
    "both non - rotating and slowly rotating gases are discussed .",
    "section [ section 4 ] discusses a fermi gas confined by gravity and in particular the effect of non - commutativity on the mass - radius relation , density and entropy .",
    "section [ section 5 ] summarises our results and draws conclusions .",
    "we begin by summarizing the formalism of quantum mechanics in non - commutative three - dimensional space , as set out in @xcite .",

    "in this case we want to mimic @xmath5 as a collection of spheres ( an onion structure ) where the squared radii of the spheres are quantised according to the eigenvalues of the @xmath0 casimir . for this @xmath6 must carry a single copy of each su(2 )",
    "irrep . a convenient , concrete realisation of this configuration space is provided by the schwinger construction , which utilises two sets of boson creation and annihilation operators to build a representation of @xmath0 : @xmath7=\\delta_{\\alpha\\beta}\\quad\\mathrm{and}\\quad[\\hat{a}_\\alpha,\\hat{a}_\\beta ] = [ \\hat{a}^\\dagger_\\alpha,\\hat{a}^\\dagger_\\beta]=0\\quad\\mathrm{with}\\quad\\alpha,\\beta=1,2 .",

    "our treatment follows that of section 7 in @xcite .",

    "the two solutions are related by the normal ordering procedure in ( [ eq : radial - def ] ) .",
    "here we only require @xmath32 , which is found to be @xmath35 where @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 is a jacobi polynomial .",

    "can be shown to reduce to the standard commutative result as @xmath39",
    ". an important consequence of ( [ eq : jacobi - poly - free ] ) is that it places an upper bound on the free particle energy @xmath40 .",
    "this can be seen by considering the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath32 as @xmath41 . according to theorems",
    "@xmath42 and @xmath43 in @xcite the limit @xmath44 will diverge if the argument of the jacobi polynomial falls outside the interval @xmath45 $ ] . for @xmath46 to be normalisable with respect to the trace inner product in ( [ eq : definehq ] ) @xmath47 therefore can not exceed two , which translates into an energy upper bound of @xmath48 .",
    "we next consider a spherical well potential in non - commutative space . to this end , consider the operator @xmath49 which projects onto the subspace of @xmath6 spanned by fock states with total particle number greater or equal to @xmath50 . through the relation between @xmath51 and radial distance in ( [ eq : distance - op ] )",
    "this amounts to projecting onto configuration space states which are localised beyond a physical radius of @xmath52 . for a potential well with height @xmath53 and radius @xmath54",
    "the schrdinger equation now reads @xmath55 through ( [ eq : standard - eigenfunctions ] ) this again translates into a difference equation for @xmath32 . in this equation @xmath56",
    "is found to appear naturally as the effective radius of the well .",
    "the solution for @xmath57 is just that of the free particle given in ( [ eq : jacobi - poly - free ] ) , while for @xmath58 it is a linear combination of non - commutative versions of the bessel and neumann functions .",
    "a careful analysis of the matching condition at @xmath59 reveals that in the @xmath60 limit the interior solution @xmath32 must vanish at @xmath61 . according to ( [ eq : jacobi - poly - free ] ) the bound state energies of the infinite well",
    "are therefore determined by the zeroes of the jacobi polynomials . upon using the symmetry relation @xmath62 and the freedom to shift the energies by a constant ( thereby taking @xmath63 to @xmath64 ) the quantization condition reads @xmath65 note",
    "that , due to shifting the energies , the bound states are now arranged symmetrically around @xmath66 .",
    "it follows from ( [ eq : jacobi - pol - inf - well ] ) that for a specific angular momentum @xmath67 there are exactly @xmath68 bound states .",
    "this implies not only a cut - off in energy , but also in angular momentum at @xmath69 . by summing over @xmath67 the total number of single particle states , and therefore the maximum number of spinless fermions the well can accommodate ,",
    "is found to be @xmath70 as a consistency check on ( [ eq : jacobi - pol - inf - well ] ) , we derive this result in an alternative way .",
    "since the infinite well of radius @xmath71 confines particles within this radius , the configuration space is effectively truncated at states with a radius less or equal to @xmath71 and is thus finite dimensional .",
    "the states spanning this finite dimensional subspace of fock space are @xmath72 where @xmath73 . since the quantum hilbert space is spanned by states of the form @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 , the quantum hilbert space is also finite dimensional with dimension @xmath77 , which agrees precisely with ( [ eq : total - particles ] ) .",
    "thus , counting the number of independent solutions of the non - commutative schrdinger equations matches precisely the dimensionality of quantum hilbert space .    in order to study the thermodynamics",
    "we require the density of states , which is related to the density of zeros of the jacobi polynomial @xmath78 .",
    "the latter , in the limit of large @xmath67 and @xmath71 , is @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xcite @xmath81 by definition @xmath82 when @xmath83 .",
    "the thermodynamic density of states , still for a fixed @xmath67 , is then @xmath84 with @xmath85 and where @xmath86 ranges from @xmath87 to @xmath88 .",
    "note that the density of states is symmetric under @xmath89 .",
    "this simple fact will have important implications for the discussion of the high / low density duality in section [ duality ] .",
    "also of interest is the total density of states @xmath90 obtained by summing @xmath91 over @xmath67 .",
