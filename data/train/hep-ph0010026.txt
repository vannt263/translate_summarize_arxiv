    "the grand unification theory ( gut ) is very attractive as a unified description of the fundamental forces in the nature .",
    "especially , the so(10 ) model is the most attractive to us when we take the unification of the quarks and leptons into consideration .",
    "however , in order to reproduce the observed quark and lepton masses and mixings , usually , a lot of higgs scalars are brought into the model .",
    "we think that the nature is simple . what is of the greatest interest to us is to know the minimum number of the higgs scalars which can give the observed fermion mass spectra . a model with one higgs scalar",
    "is obviously ruled out for the description of the realistic quark and lepton mass spectra .",
    "then , how is a model with two different types of higgs scalars ( e.g. , * 10 * and * 126 * scalars ) ?    in the so(10 )",
    "gut scenario , a model with one * 10 * and one * 126 * higgs scalars leads to the relation @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are charged lepton , up - quark and down - quark mass matrices , respectively .",
    "it is widely accepted that there will be almost no solution of @xmath5 and @xmath6 which give the observed fermion mass spectra .",
    "the reason is as follows : we take a basis on which the up - quark mass matrix @xmath3 is diagonal ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "then , the relation ( [ eq82514 ] ) is expressed as @xmath8 considering that @xmath9 is almost diagonal and the mass hierarchy of up - quark sector is much severe than that of down - quark sector , we observe that the contribution to the first and the second generation part of @xmath10 from the up - quark part @xmath11 is negligible so that it is proportional to that of @xmath9 . thus , the relation ( [ eq82514 ] ) which predicts @xmath12 does not reproduce the observed hierarchical structure of the down - quark and charged lepton masses @xcite such as predicted by georgi - jarlskog mass relations @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 at the gut scale @xcite . however , the above conclusion is somewhat impatient one .",
    "( i ) it is too simplified to regard @xmath9 as almost diagonal .",
    "( ii ) we must check a possibility that the mass relations are satisfied with the opposite signs , i.e. , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "( iii ) the mass values at the gut scale which are evaluated from the observed values by using the renormalization group equations show sizable deviations from the georgi - jarskog relations .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to investigate systematically whether there are solutions of @xmath5 and @xmath6 which give the realistic quark and lepton masses or not .",
    "in the so(10 ) gut model with one * 10 * and one * 126 * higgs scalars , the down - quark and down - lepton mass matrices @xmath4 and @xmath2 are given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are mass matrices which are generated by the * 10 * and * 126 * higgs scalars @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "inversely , we obtain @xmath24 on the other hand , the up - quark mass matrix @xmath3 is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 and @xmath28 denote higgs scalar components which couple with up- and down - quark sectors , respectively . therefore , by using the relations eq.([eq82513 ] ) , we obtain the relation @xmath29 where @xmath30    for convenience , first , we investigate the case that the matrices @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath2 are symmetrical matrices at the unification scale because we assume that they are generated by the * 10 * and * 126 * higgs .",
    "then , we can diagonalize those by unitary matrices @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively , as @xmath34 where @xmath11 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are diagonal matrices . since the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix @xmath37 is given by @xmath38 the relation ( [ eq82515 ] )",
    "is re - written as follows : @xmath39 at present , we have almost known the experimental values of @xmath36 , @xmath11 and @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , we obtain the independent three equations :    ' '' ''    ' '' ''    @xmath41 ,   \\label{eq82501}\\\\ { \\rm tr}(d_e d_e^\\dagger)^2 & = & |c_d|^4 \\ , { \\rm tr}\\bigl [ ( ( v d_{d}v^{t}+\\kappa d_u ) ( v d_{d}v^{t}+\\kappa d_u)^\\dagger)^2\\bigr ] ,   \\label{eq82502}\\\\ { \\rm det}d_ed_e^\\dagger & = & |c_d|^6 \\ , { \\rm det } \\bigl[(v d_{d}v^{t}+\\kappa d_u ) ( v d_{d}v^{t}+\\kappa d_u)^\\dagger\\bigr ] , \\label{eq82503}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    ' '' ''    ' '' ''    2 where @xmath42 . by eliminating the parameter @xmath6",
    ", we have two equations for the parameter @xmath43 : @xmath44 where @xmath45 , for instance , means the right - hand side of ( [ eq82501 ] ) to the third power .",
    "let us denote the parameter values of @xmath43 evaluated from ( [ eq82511 ] ) and ( [ eq82512 ] ) as @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "if @xmath46 and @xmath47 coincide with each other , then we have a possibility that the so(10 ) gut model can reproduce the observed quark and lepton mass spectra .",
    "if @xmath46 and @xmath47 do not so , the so(10 ) model with one * 10 * and one * 126 * higgs scalars is ruled out , and we must bring more higgs scalars into the model . of course , in the numerical evaluation , the values @xmath46 and @xmath47 will have sizable errors , because the observed values @xmath36 , @xmath11 , @xmath35 and @xmath37 have experimental errors , and the values at the gut scale also have errors .",
    "the values @xmath48 and @xmath49 are not so sensitive to the renormalization group equation effect ( evolution effect ) , because those are almost determined only by the mass ratios .",
    "( more details will be discussed in the sec .",
    "therefore , we will evaluate @xmath46 and @xmath47 by using the center values at @xmath50 in the sec .",
    "if we find @xmath51 , we will give further detailed numerical study only for the case .",
    "the relations ( 2.13 ) and ( 2.14 ) hold only at the unification scale @xmath52 on the other hand , we know only the experimental values of the fermion masses @xmath53 and ckm matrix parameters @xmath54 at the electroweak scale @xmath50 . for a model which does not have any intermediate energy scales",
    ", we can straightforwardly estimate the values of @xmath53 and @xmath54 at @xmath52 from those at @xmath50 by the one - loop renormalization equation @xmath55 where @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 denote contributions from fermion - loop corrections , vertex corrections due to the gauge bosons and vertex corrections due to the higgs boson(s ) , respectively .",
    "therefore , we can directly check the relations ( 2.13 ) and ( 2.14 ) by substituting the observable quantities @xmath53 and @xmath54 at @xmath52 .",
    "however , for a model which has an intermediate energy scale such as a non - susy model , the values of @xmath53 and @xmath54 at @xmath59 are highly model - dependent , so that the check of eqs .",
    "( 2.13 ) and ( 2.14 ) can not be done so straightforwardly .    in this section",
    ", we will show that we can approximately check eq .",
    "( 2.13 ) and ( 2.14 ) by using the values of @xmath53 and @xmath54 at @xmath50 , without knowing the explicit values of @xmath53 and @xmath54 at @xmath52 , as far as the evolutions of @xmath53 and @xmath54 are not singular .",
    "it is well known that in such a conventional model the evolution effects are approximately described as @xcite @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 ( @xmath63 and @xmath54 ) denote the values at @xmath52 ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "the relations ( 3.2 ) hold only for a model where the yukawa coupling constant of top quark , @xmath64 , satisfies @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "the relations ( 3.2 ) also hold even in a model which has an intermediate energy scale @xmath67 , because , for example , when we denote @xmath68 and @xmath69 as @xmath70@xmath71 and @xmath70@xmath72 , respectively , we can obtain @xmath73 with @xmath74 .    by using the approximate relations ( 3.2 ) the diagonalized up - quark mass matrix @xmath75 at @xmath52",

    "this means that when we find the solution @xmath43 at @xmath50 , the solution at @xmath52 also exists , no matter whether the model is a susy one or a non - susy one .",
    "then , we can obtain the value @xmath106 at @xmath52 from the relation ( 3.9 ) with the solution @xmath43 at @xmath50 .",

    "note that eqs.([eq82511 ] ) and ( [ eq82512 ] ) are realized by gut scale because eq.([eq90102 ] ) is broken at @xmath50 . in the present section , tentatively , we assume that the yukawa coupling constant @xmath107 and @xmath108 at @xmath50 keep their forms symmetrical , so that we can put the observed values @xmath11 , @xmath35 and @xmath37 at @xmath50 into the relations ( [ eq82511 ] ) and ( [ eq82512 ] )",

    "the calculation has been performed allowing all the combinations of the quark mass signatures . here",
    "it should be noted that , since @xmath114 is much smaller than @xmath115 and @xmath116 , the difference of the sign of @xmath114 scarcely makes a change of allowed regions . in this calculation , we have selected @xmath117 and @xmath118 as input parameters and @xmath119 , @xmath6 and @xmath43 as output parameters because the calculation is sensitive to these parameters .",
    "we give the numerical results in fig 1 . here , except for @xmath119 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 , we have adopted the center values of eq.([e060701 ] ) as input values .",
    "moving @xmath117 at intervals of 0.0005 rad and fixing @xmath120 , we search the solutions where @xmath48 and @xmath49 become coincident .",
    "our numerical analysis shows that the solutions exist in the combinations of table [ t-0 ] . in a table",
    "[ tab91601 ] , we show the nearest solution of @xmath119 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 to the center values of eq.([e060701 ] ) .    in the following we perform data fitting for the case of top line of table [ tab91601 ] .",
    "( [ eq82501])-([eq82503 ] ) can constrain only the absolute value of @xmath6 .",
    "the argument of the parameter @xmath6 may be decided by taking neutrino sector into consideration in the future . for the time being , we set @xmath121 so that @xmath122 becomes a real number : @xmath123 in this case , the mass matrices in mev are    ' '' ''    ' '' ''    @xmath124    ' '' ''    ' '' ''    2 here , using the condition @xmath125@xmath126gev , we can get vev s as @xmath127}}{\\sqrt{(|c_0|^2 + 1)+(|c_1|^2 + 1)|\\rho|^2}}\\ ] ] with @xmath128 .",
    "then , the yukawa couplings about * 10 * and * 126 * become @xmath129 we consider that the model should be calculable perturbativly .",
    "we can see that every element of the yukawa coupling constants ( [ eq092701 ] ) is smaller than one if we take a suitable value of @xmath130 .",
    "in the so(10 ) gut scenario , we can also discuss the model with one * 10 * and one * 120 * by the same method .",
    "the yukawa couplings of * 10 * and * 120 * are symmetric and antisymmetric , respectively . if we consider a case that the yukawa coupling constants of * 10 * are real and * 120 * pure imaginary , we can make them hermitian , i.e. , @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "therefore , by considering the real vacuum expectation values @xmath133 and @xmath134 , we can obtain the hermitian mass matrices @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath2 : @xmath135 then , we can diagonalize those by unitary matrices @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 as @xmath136 since the ckm matrix @xmath37 is given by @xmath137 the relation ( [ eq83101 ] ) is re - written as follows : @xmath138 as stated previously , we have almost known the experimental values of @xmath36 , @xmath11 and @xmath139 .",

    "( [ eq82511 ] ) and ( [ eq82512 ] ) . @xmath6 and @xmath43 are real since we have assumed the @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath2 to be hermitian .",

    "it should be worth while noting that the solutions in the latter model are real .",
    "the latter model is very attractive because the origin of the cp violation attributes only to the * 120 * scalar . in the both models",
    ", we can make the magnitudes of all the yukawa coupling constants smaller than one , so that the models are safely calculable under the perturbation theory .    by the way ,",
    "note that the numerical results are very sensitive to the values of @xmath119 and @xmath117 . for numerical fittings , it is favor that the strange quark mass @xmath119 is somewhat smaller than the center value @xmath146 mev which is quoted in ref .",

    ", we can conclude that in the so(10 ) model with two higgs scalars , we can not adopt a model with the texture @xmath149 .    in the present paper",
