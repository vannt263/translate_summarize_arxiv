    "the model of random interlacements was recently introduced by sznitman in  @xcite , and detailed accounts can be found in the survey  @xcite and the recent book  @xcite . loosely speaking , random interlacements in  @xmath0 , @xmath1 , is a stationary poissonian soup of ( transient ) doubly infinite simple random walk trajectories .",
    "the _ level _ of random interlacements is an additional parameter  @xmath3 entering the intensity measure of the poisson process , as the value of  @xmath4 increases , more trajectories are added .",

    "can be done in several ways .",
    "one of the methods which has been popular in last decade is to study random walks in random environments ( rwre ) . in this paper",
    "we aim to do just that by considering the biased random walk on the interlacement set .",
    "this is not the first study of rwre on the interlacement set .",
    "indeed it has been shown in  @xcite that the invariance principle holds for the simple random walk on the interlacement cluster ; by which we mean that `` typical '' displacement of the particle by time  @xmath10 is of order  @xmath11 and that the rescaled process converges to a brownian motion .",
    "this result is similar to what is observed for the simple random walk on the supercritical percolation cluster  @xcite ,  @xcite and  @xcite .    in the context of the biased random on supercritical percolation clusters in  @xmath0",
    ", it has been shown that the walk experiences a phase transition from a positive - speed phase ( for small biases ) to a zero - speed regime for large biases in which the walk moves as  @xmath12 for some  @xmath13 ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "we show that , in the context of biased random walks on the interlacement set of  @xmath14 , the situation is radically different in the sense that the for any biases the walk has zero - speed and actually moves slower than any polynomial in  @xmath10 .      for @xmath15 ,",
    "let @xmath16 be the usual scalar product , and we denote by @xmath17 the unit vectors of the canonical orthonormal basis .",

    "let us denote by  @xmath23 the law of the @xmath24-dimensional simple random walk @xmath25 started from  @xmath21 .",
    "for any @xmath26 let @xmath27 be the hitting time of  @xmath28 , and write @xmath29 for @xmath30 .",
    "we define the harmonic measure @xmath31\\mathbf{1}_a;\\ ] ] the _ capacity _ of  @xmath28 is defined by @xmath32 see e.g.  section  6.5 of  @xcite .",
    "let us give a `` constructive '' description of random interlacements at level  @xmath4 observed on a finite set  @xmath28 .",
    "namely ,    * take a poisson(@xmath33 ) number of particles ; * place these particles on the boundary of  @xmath28 independently , with law @xmath34 ; * let the particles perform independent simple random walks ( by transience , each walk only leaves a finite trace on  @xmath28 ) .    as a consequence of the above ,",

    "now , we define the biased random walk on the interlacement cluster , which is the main object of study of this paper . fix a positive parameter  @xmath37 ( which accounts for the bias ) .",
    "let us define the _ conductances _ on the edges of  @xmath0 in the following way : @xmath38 and we call the collection of all conductances @xmath39 the random environment .",

    "as mentioned in the introduction , this picture is very different from the one we would get by considering the simple random walk on a supercritical percolation cluster in @xmath0 . as will become clear in the course of the proof , the above result is genuinely three - dimensional .",
    "indeed , using the same methods as for our main result , it is possible to show that , in dimensions @xmath50 , _ for large values of the bias _ the walk still has zero speed ( see theorem  [ t_big_d_0speed ] below ) ; but we conjecture that for small values of  @xmath37 the biased random walk should have positive speed just as in the case of the biased random walk on percolation clusters ( see  @xcite ) .",
