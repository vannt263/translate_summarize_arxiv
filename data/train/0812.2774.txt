    "inspired by the fast developments of quantum information @xcite , quantum phase transition ( qpt ) @xcite has renewed much attention in different fields of physics ranging from condensed matter physics to quantum optics @xcite .",
    "it was found that @xcite at the quantum critical point the dynamic evolution of a quantum critical system is so extremely sensitive that it can enhance the quantum decoherence of an external system coupled to it .",
    "this ultra - sensitivity is characterized by the loschmidt echo , which is a well - known concept in quantum chaos @xcite . in this sense ,",
    "the quantum - classical transition from a pure state to a mixed one is induced by the quantum criticality of this surrounding system .",
    "this discovery motivated a new scheme to probe the qpt by exploring the quantum coherence in the external system and its losses @xcite .",
    "moreover , this probing mechanism for quantum criticality was illustrated by a circuit qed architecture @xcite , which was formed by a superconducting josephson junction qubit array interacting with a one - dimensional superconducting transmission line resonator ( tlr ) @xcite .",
    "the superconducting qubit array was modeled as an ising chain in the transverse field ( ictf ) .",
    "this investigation showed that the qpt phenomenon in the superconducting qubit array was evidently revealed by the correlation spectrum of tlr output .",
    "though this mechanism for the circuit qed system has not been experimentally tested , an nmr simulation experiment @xcite has been carried out to demonstrate the qpt - like phenomenon ( energy level crossing ) as predicted in ref.@xcite by exploring the increased sensibility of the quantum system to perturbation when it is close to a critical point .    for the above circuit qed architecture to demonstrate the probing of the qpt",
    ", we notice that with two modes simultaneously coupled to a charge qubit , their squeezing effect was investigated theoretically @xcite . here , we consider the full application of quantum optics approach @xcite in the detection of the qpt by considering the higher order quantum coherence . to this end",
    ", we consider that a josephson junction qubit array modeled as the ictf simultaneously couples to two modes propagating in the tlr . since all quasi - spins homogeneously",
    "interact with the fields , we can obtain the first ( second ) order correlation function of the two fields . according to our calculation ,",
    "the second order quantum coherence is given in terms of the decoherence factor of the ictf .",
    "as proven in the appendix , the norm of the decoherence factor decreases exceptionally when the ictf is at the critical point .",
    "therefore , the photon bunching effect occurs since the second order quantum coherence of the steady state is smaller compared with its initial value . and",
    "these results show genetic characteristics of the quantum spin chain in the vicinity of the critical point .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "the next section describes the ictf formed by a capacitively coupled josephson junction qubit array is coupled to two independent fields propagating in the tlr .",
    "then the detection scheme of the qpt and the correlation functions of two mode fields are given in sec .",
    "a brief summary is concluded in sec .",
    "iv . furthermore ,",
    "in addition to the main body of the paper , appendix [ app : appendix1 ] presents details about the calculation of the decoherence factor .",
    "we consider a circuit qed system illustrated in fig.1 .",
    "@xmath0 cooper pair boxes ( cpbs ) are capacitively coupled one by one . formed by a superconducting island connected with two josephson junctions , each cpb is a direct current superconducting quantum interference device ( dcsquid ) . since the magnetic flux @xmath1 threading the dcsquid is tunable , the effective josephson tunnelling energy can be varied . with proper bias voltage",
    ", the cpb behaves as a qubit near the degeneracy point and then josephson junction qubit array becomes a spin chain with @xmath0 1/2-spins . when the coupling capacitance @xmath2 between two cpbs is much smaller than the total one @xmath3 to each cpb , the high order terms in hamiltonian can be neglected and only the nearest neighbor interaction is considered . then the qubit array can be approximated as an ictf with @xcite @xmath4where @xmath5 and @xmath6 with @xmath7 being the state of @xmath8 extra cooper pair on the superconducting island , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the josephson energy of each cpb with @xmath12 the josephson energy of single junction , @xmath13 the flux quantum .    ) individually transmitted in the tlr .",
    "since the cpbs are located at the antinodes of both modes , i.e , @xmath14 , they only interact with the magnetic fields .",
    ", width=7 ]    in a one dimensional tlr , the electric current and voltage at the position @xmath15 are given as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the creation operator with frequency @xmath18 , @xmath19 the length of tlr , @xmath20 and @xmath21 the induction and capacitance of per unit length of tlr respectively , @xmath22 positive integer .",
    "therefore , a cpb located at the antinode is only coupled to the magnetic field since the electric field vanishes . according to ampere",
    "s circuital law , when a dc squid loop is placed at a distance @xmath23 with respect to the center of the tlr , the quantum magnetic flux that threads it is @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the vacuum magnetic permeability , @xmath26 the area of dc squid loop .",
    "the interaction between the cpbs and the magnetic field is written as @xmath27 in our consideration , two independent modes with frequencies @xmath28 are propagating in the tlr .",
    "all the cpbs are placed the antinodes of the both modes with the positions @xmath29 where @xmath30 @xmath31 and @xmath32 are positive integers , @xmath33 the velocity of the light .",
    "since @xmath34 , under the rotating wave approximation scully , the interaction hamiltonian is approximated to the second order , @xmath35\\sum_{j}\\sigma _ { j}^{x}\\text{,}\\]]where the coupling constants between the two modes and individual spins are @xmath36for realistic parameters , @xmath37 af , @xmath38 af , @xmath39 cm , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 ghz , we have @xmath44 ghz , @xmath45 ghz , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 @xcite .",

    "followed by a series of advances , i.e. , resonance fluorescence , the hanbury - brown - twiss experiment @xcite reopen philosophical debate about photons @xcite and set itself as the milestone in the development of quantum optics .",
    "all these experimental phenomena are associated with the correlation functions of the field . here , we consider it as the method to detect the qpt since the two fields propagating in the tlr interact with the quasi - spins respectively .",
    "first of all , we define an operator @xmath60 the first order correlation function is written as @xmath61 . here , the bracket @xmath62 denotes average over the initial state , with the ising chain in the ground state @xmath59 and the two fields being in arbitrary pure states @xmath63 and @xmath64 respectively . therefore , @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the decoherence factor @xcite which measures the overlap of the ground state evolving under two different hamiltonians .",
    "details about its calculation is presented in appendix [ app : appendix1 ] . in ref.@xcite",
    ", it was discovered that for the same amount of environment dissipation the first order correlation function of the single mode decreased more rapidly in the vicinity of the qpt than in the other region .",
    "moreover , the second order correlation function @xmath67 is analytically written as    @xmath68 \\notag \\\\ & + ic_{m+1}^*c_m d_{n-1}^*d_n\\{(m+n-1)\\sqrt{(m+1)n}+[m\\sqrt{(m+1)n}r^{(m , n-1)}_{m-1,n}+(n-1)\\sqrt{(m+1)n}r^{(m+1,n-2)}_{m , n-1}]e^{i(\\omega_1-\\omega_2)t}\\ } \\notag \\\\ & -ic_{m-1}^*c_m d_{n+1}^*d_n\\{(m+n-1)\\sqrt{m(n+1)}+[(m-1)\\sqrt{m(n+1)}r^{(m-2,n+1)}_{m-1,n}+n\\sqrt{m(n+1)}r^{(m-1,n)}_{m , n-1}]e^{-i(\\omega_1-\\omega_2)t}\\ } \\notag \\\\ & -c_{m+2}^*c_m d_{n-2}^*d_n \\sqrt{(m+2)(m+1)n(n-1)}r^{(m+1,n-2)}_{m , n-1}e^{i(\\omega_1-\\omega_2)t } \\notag \\\\ & -c_{m-2}^*c_m d_{n+2}^*d_n \\sqrt{(m-1)m(n+1)(n+2)}r^{(m-2,n+1)}_{m-1,n}e^{-i(\\omega_1-\\omega_2)t } \\text{.}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    thus , for the fields initially in the state @xmath69 , it is straightforward to obtain @xmath70 \\text{,}\\ ] ] where re@xmath71 means the real part of @xmath72 .",
    "as proven in appendix [ app : appendix1 ] , in the vicinity of the qpt , the square of the norm of @xmath73 decreases more rapidly than exponential , i.e , @xmath74 where @xmath75 , @xmath76 with @xmath77 being the nearest integer to @xmath78 .    it can be seen that there is a vanishing numerator @xmath79 as @xmath80 .",
    "it is doubtful that the exponential decay of @xmath81 closer to the critical point to make the denominator @xmath82 small enough . in that case",
    ", @xmath83 stays as a constant and the @xmath84 decreases exponentially with time . for a real system",
    ", @xmath0 is finite for the demonstration of the qpt . to test the validity of the above analysis",
    ", we resort to numerical simulation . in fig.[r ] , we plot the evolution of @xmath84 according to eq.([r1001 ] ) . it can be seen that despite some oscillations @xmath84 decays exceptionally at the critical point .    according to ref.@xcite ,",
    "the photon bunching and anti - bunching effects are associated with the second order degree of coherence @xmath85 which is the normalized second order correlation function of the fields . for the fields both in the state @xmath86 ,",
    "the second order degree of coherence is simplified as @xmath87 with im@xmath71 being the image part of @xmath72 .",
    "since the norm of the decoherence factor decreases exponentially at the critical point , it is obvious that both the real and image parts of @xmath88 will vanish in that limit . as a consequence",
    ", we expect the second order degree of coherence to be less than unity in the steady state , i.e. , @xmath89 . generally speaking ,",
    "classical fields such as thermal light and coherent light , prefer to distribute themselves in bunches rather than at random .",
    "they exhibit less correlation for time longer than the correlation time .",
    "this is so called bunching effect @xcite . on the contrary , in certain quantum optical systems , fewer quantum photons",
    "are detected close together than further apart . and",
    "the photon antibunching observed in fluorescent light from a two - level atom @xcite is of such kind . here , since the two fields involved are two independent modes , we expect photons to be neither bunching nor antibunching , regardless of quantum mechanical fields or classical fields .",
    "however , as shown in fig.[g2lambda ] , when the ising chain is at the critical point , the two independent fields initially in @xmath90 display the photon bunching effect .",
    "further witness is also demonstrated in fig.[g2n](a - c ) .",
    "it can also be proven that @xmath91 for both fields in the coherent state @xmath92 which is not shown here . in fig.[g2n](d )",
    ", we plot the time evolution of the second order of coherence for this case . here",
    ", we remark that the two initially independent quantum fields display the classical effect due to their common interaction with the quantum critical system . as illustrated in eq.([rr ] ) , two initially identical states evolve under two slightly different hamiltonians .",
    "although the difference between these hamiltonians are tiny , their evolution trajectories are quite distinct in the vicinity of the qpt .",
    "thus , this slight difference leads to the exponential decay of their decoherence factor .",
    "it can be understood as a signature of quantum chaos @xcite .",
    "furthermore , for the parameters mentioned after eq.([eta ] ) and @xmath93 , both the real and imaginary parts of @xmath88 decay with a rate of the order @xmath94 ghz . since the dissipation rate of the first excitation mode is about @xmath95 mhz @xcite , we can neglect the influence due to the dissipation of tlr .",
    "to conclude , we have explored the possibility to probe quantum criticality in the ictf by detecting the higher order quantum coherence of the two modes of cavity fields coupled to the spins .",
    "we suggest a physical implementation of this theoretical scheme based on a circuit qed system where the capacitively coupled cpbs are coupled to the tlr .",
    "situated at the antinodes of both modes propagating in the tlr , cpbs are only coupled to the magnetic fields . in a heuristic way , we show the decoherence factor decays exponentially with time in the vicinity of the critical point .",
    "the second order of coherence is smaller than one at the steady state .",
    "thus , the two initially independent modes demonstrate photon bunching effect .",
    "this can serve as a witness of the qpt .",
    "on the other hand , we have not investigated decoherence originated from the dissipation of the cpbs .",
    "we notice that in a recent work @xcite , the qpt in the dissipative random transverse - field ising chain was investigated .",
    "it was discovered that the quantum critical point was ruined by the interplay between quantum fluctuations and ohmic dissipation .",
    "further exploration may be done when such kind of effect is considered .",
