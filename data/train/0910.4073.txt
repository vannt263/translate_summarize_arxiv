    "in this article we analyse the stability of the hyperboloidal initial value problem for a class of solutions to the vacuum einstein field equations the so - called _ purely radiative vacuum spacetimes_. purely radiative vacuum spacetimes describe gravitational radiation which comes from infinity , interacts with itself in a non - linear way and then disperses to infinity . in order to encode that the spacetime is made only of incoming gravitational radiation",
    ", one assumes that it admits a penrose conformal extension such that the null generators of future and past null infinity ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) are complete and that future and past timelike infinity are represented in the conformal extension by two points @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the points @xmath4 are required to be regular that is , the conformally rescaled unphysical spacetime admits a smooth extension which is regular at @xmath4 .",
    "more precisely , given a vacuum spacetime @xmath5 it will be assumed that there exists a conformally related spacetime @xmath6 such that @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a suitable conformal factor .",
    "null infinity , @xmath9 , is characterised as the set of points for which @xmath10 on the other hand , the points @xmath4 in a purely radiative spacetime are such that @xmath11 it is perhaps worth noting that the corresponding points @xmath4 in a spacetime with a black hole ( say , the schwarzschild spacetime ) do not satisfy these conditions .",
    "it has been know for a long time that the question of the existence of non - trivial examples of purely radiative solutions to the einstein field equations hinges very delicately on the structure of the spacetimes in a neighbourhood of the so - called spatial infinity , @xmath12 see e.g. @xcite . a way of getting around the so - called @xmath12-_problem _ is to consider initial value problems posed on _ hyperboloidal hypersurfaces _ , that is , spacelike hypersurfaces which can be thought of as intersecting null infinity in a transversal manner .",
    "if the initial data prescribed on the hyperboloid is suitably close to a _",
    "canonical _ hyperboloidal data implied by the minkowski spacetime that is , the data is a _ perturbation _ of minkowski data then it has been proved that the resulting development has a conformal structure similar to that of minkowski spacetime @xcite .",
    "more precisely , the future development of initial data admits a conformal compactification such that the locus of points , @xmath0 satisfying the condition ( [ scri : condition ] ) has the topology @xmath13 , and that there is a single point , @xmath2 , satisfying the conditions ( [ i+:condition ] ) where the null generators of null infinity converge . the original proof of this result was carried out using the so - called _ conformal einstein field equations _ discussed in @xcite .",
    "these equations have the property of being regular even at the points where the conformal factor vanishes and are such that a solution to them implies a solution to the vacuum einstein field equations .",
    "a property of the evolution systems implied by these conformal field equations is that it includes the conformal factor as one of the unknowns , and thus any discussion of the structure of the conformal boundary has to be performed _",
    "a posteriori_. the results of @xcite have been generalised to the case of the einstein field equations are coupled to maxwell and yang - mills fields @xcite .",
    "a more general system of conformal field equations has been introduced in @xcite .",
    "this _ extended conformal einstein field equations _ are expressed in terms of so - called _ weyl connections _",
    "torsion free connections ( not necessarily levi - civita ) which preserve the conformal structure .",
    "thus , the field equations contain more gauge freedom . in particular , using the extended conformal equations it is possible to introduce gauges _conformal gaussian gauges_ which are based on certain type of conformal invariants the so - called _ conformal geodesics_. the advantages of these conformal gaussian systems are twofold : combined with the extended conformal field equations , they imply simpler systems of evolution equations ; and , if working in vacuum , they provide an _ a priori _ canonical conformal factor so that the location and properties of the conformal boundary are known and can be adjusted according to need before the propagation equations are solved . in @xcite , the extended conformal einstein field equations and conformal gaussian gauge systems have been used to provide a new version of the proof of the stability results for minkowski and de sitter spacetime . in particular , the analysis of the properties of the conformal boundary of the spacetimes obtained is much simpler and transparent .",
    "the proofs of the stability of perturbations of the minkowski spacetime in @xcite and in @xcite make use of an adaptation of a very general result on the existence and stability of symmetric hyperbolic systems by kato @xcite . the possibility of using these theorems to directly prove the global existence of solutions to the einstein field equations stems from the use of a conformally compactified picture where timelike infinity is at a finite position . as a result ,",
    "kato s theorems allow to provide very compact global existence results which require almost no pde ( partial differential equations ) analysis .",
    "the latter should be contrasted , for example , with the analysis of the non - linear stability of the minkowski spacetime carried out by christodoulou & klainerman @xcite where precise asymptotic estimates of the solution are obtained .    in the present article",
    "we generalise the methods and result of @xcite to reference solutions which are purely radiative spacetimes in the sense discussed in the first paragraphs of this introduction .",
    "a procedure to construct an infinite number of these purely radiative spacetimes has been given in @xcite .",
    "the possibility of generalising the existence and stability results of the minkowski spacetime using this class of solutions has been suggested in @xcite .",
    "this construction depends upon a remarkable connection between stationary solutions to the einstein field equations and spacetimes with vanishing mass .",
    "the reference spacetimes thus obtained are only known in an abstract sense and without much information about their geometry at hand .",
    "it is remarkable that although one has very little explicit information about the reference solutions , it is still possible to use the methods of @xcite to obtain a stability result .",
    "our main result can be summarised in the following form .    given a sequence of multipole moments for a static solution to the einstein vacuum equations subject to a suitable convergence condition",
    ", there exists a hyperboloidal initial data set whose future development is a purely radiative spacetime admitting a conformal compactification with a future null infinity satisfying conditions ( [ scri : condition ] ) and a point representing timelike infinity satisfying conditions ( [ i+:condition ] ) .",
    "a small enough perturbation of the hyperboloidal initial data has a future development whose conformal boundary has the same properties as that of the unperturbed solution .    in order to prove this theorem",
    "one starts by considering the asymptotic end of an initial data set for a vacuum static solution to the einstein field equations .",
    "this asymptotic end can be compactified to a 3-dimensional manifold , @xmath14 , such that the point at infinity corresponds to a certain point @xmath15 .",
    "the subsequent analysis will be restricted to a suitable neighbourhood of this point .",
    "the observations in @xcite allow to construct an initial data set for the conformal einstein field equations which is analytical in a neighbourhood of @xmath15 .",
    "this initial data has the peculiarity of having a vanishing adm mass .",
    "as our analysis is local to @xmath15 the later feature causes no problem .",
    "a local existence for this data follows directly .",
    "our interest is then concentrated to the region in the development which is included in @xmath16 ( the causal past of @xmath15 ) . as a consequence of our conformal setting ,",
    "this region implies the existence a portion of a purely radiative spacetime .",
    "the latter can be regarded as the future development of some data for a purely radiative spacetime prescribed on a fiduciary hyperboloid @xmath17 .",
    "the point @xmath15 in @xmath14 corresponds to the point @xmath2 of the radiative spacetime . in order to prove the existence of the reference radiative",
    "spacetime one employs a conformal gaussian system based on a congruence of conformal geodesics leaving the hypersurface @xmath14 orthogonally .",
    "it should be noted that this congruence will , in general , intersect the fiduciary hyperboloid in a non - orthogonal manner .",
    "this feature hinders a direct application of kato s theorems in order to conclude the stability of the hyperboloidal data .",
    "the reason for this is that in order to make use of kato s theorems one has to make use of a gaussian system in which the conformal geodesics leave the initial hyperboloid with the same angle and orientation as the congruence in the reference solution meets the hyperboloid @xmath17 .",
    "it turns out that the data for such an evolution are not really intrinsic to the initial hyperboloid but contain information along the direction normal to the initial hypersurface .",
    "thus , one needs to show , first , local existence for the perturbed hyperboloidal data using , for example , a congruence of conformal geodesics which is orthogonal to the hyperboloid .",
    "once this local existence has been established , one can construct initial data for the evolution along the _ tilted _ congruence using a lorentz transformation .",
    "from here kato s theorems and the requirement of the perturbed data being close enough to the reference solution yields the required stability result .",
    "we start by setting our conventions in section [ conventions ] and recalling the physical and the conformal vacuum constraints .",
    "as we are working on @xmath18 and subsets thereof , we fix coordinates and vector fields on @xmath18 and briefly review the norm and the extension operator for sobolev spaces associated to @xmath18 . in section [ cefe ]",
    "we discuss the conformal tools , which we will be using later on .",
    "these include conformal geodesic , their associated conformal gaussian gauge and the conformal einstein field equations .",
    "we follow the standard approach by friedrich and derive an evolution system form the field equation by using space spinors . section [ section : reference : radiative : spacetime ] is concerned with the construction of a purely radiative reference spacetime from time symmetric static vacuum data with non - vanishing mass given on a cauchy surface passing through the point @xmath15 at spacelike infinity . in section [ section : hyperboloidal : reference : data ] the resulting radiative spacetime is analysed from the viewpoint of hyperboloidal data on a surface not passing through @xmath15 .",
    "we note at this stage that the initial data on such a hypersurface is not proper hyperboloidal data due to the fact that the conformal geodesic congruence does not intersect the hyperboloid orthogonally .",
    "thus we analyse the relationship between this so named tilted hyperboloidal data and the proper hyperboloidal data .",
    "section [ section : perturbed : radiative : spacetime ] is concerned with the existence and stability result for radiative spacetimes .",
    "the structure of the conformal boundary is analysed prior to the evolution of the data . in section [ section :",
    "stability : result ] we use a modified version of a theorem by t.kato employed in @xcite and @xcite to establish the existence and stability for purely radiative spacetimes in theorems [ katopart2 ] and [ katopart2a ] .",

    "will be denote by @xmath31 .",
    "we will also adapt this notation for all quantities related to the reference spacetime .",
    "we will make use of two types of hyperboloidal data .",
    "_ proper _ hyperboloidal data is given with respect to a frame consisting of three tangent vectors to the hypersurface and its normal , while _ tilted _ hyperboloidal data depends on a frame not intrinsic in the hypersurface . in our setup",
    "this frame will be oriented along the congruence .",
    "we will distinguish between the two frames and the corresponding frame components , by using an underscore for proper hyperboloidal data .",
    "the conformal factor on the spacetime will be denoted by @xmath8 , while @xmath32 is the conformal factor on an initial hypersurface .",
    "let @xmath33 denote a timelike hypersurface of the spacetime @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath34 , @xmath35 denote , respectively , the first and second fundamental forms induced by the metric @xmath21 on @xmath33 ( @xmath36 ) . the vacuum einstein field equations ( [ efe ] )",
    "imply the following constraint equations on @xmath33    @xmath37    where @xmath38 denotes the levi - civita and @xmath39 the ricci scalar of the metric @xmath34 .",
    "the first and second fundamental forms determined by the metrics @xmath24 and @xmath21 on @xmath33 are related by @xmath40 where @xmath41 and the function @xmath42 on @xmath33 denotes the derivative of @xmath8 in the direction of the future directed @xmath43-normal of @xmath33 .",
    "the traces @xmath44 and @xmath45 are related by @xmath46 the hamiltonian and momentum constraints for vacuum , equations ( [ hamiltonian : constraint ] ) and ( [ momentum : constraint ] ) , written in terms of the conformal fields @xmath32 , @xmath42 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 read    @xmath49    where @xmath50 denotes the levi - civita connection and @xmath51 the ricci scalar of the metric @xmath47 . in particular if @xmath52 one has that @xmath53    in the sequel we will consider two different classes of solutions to equations ( [ conformal_hamiltonian ] ) and ( [ conformal_momentum ] ) .",
    "the first class will consist of initial data sets for the einstein vacuum field equations which are _ asymptotically euclidean _ , and thus , the relevant initial hypersurfaces are cauchy hypersurfaces of an asymptotically flat spacetime .",
    "further details will be discussed in section [ asympt : euclidean : regular ] . the second class of solutions to be considered",
    "are hyperboloidal data sets . in this case",
    "the initial hypersurfaces are not cauchy hypersurfaces of a globally hyperbolic spacetimes .",
    "further details will be given in section [ section : hyperboloidal : data ] .",
    "the character of the solutions to the conformal constraint equations ( asymptotically euclidean or hyperboloidal ) is determined through the boundary conditions which supplement equations ( [ conformal_hamiltonian ] ) and ( [ conformal_momentum ] ) .      in the sequel we shall work with conformal spacetimes with time slices diffeomorphic to simply connected subsets of the 3-sphere , @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , it will be important to have a good coordinatisation of @xmath54 and to have a frame which is globally defined over this manifold . following the work in @xcite we regard @xmath54 as a submanifold of @xmath55 : @xmath56 the restrictions of the functions @xmath57 , @xmath58 on @xmath55 to @xmath54",

    "when discussing the existence of solutions to the einstein field equations in terms of conformally rescaled spacetimes , it is convenient to introduce gauges based on conformally invariant structures .",
