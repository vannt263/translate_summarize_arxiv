    "quasicrystals are defined as structures which possess translational order to the extent that their fourier transforms exhibit @xmath0-function bragg peaks , but which have symmetries that are forbidden in a periodic bravais lattice .",
    "a number of alloys have been found experimentally which appear to be true quasicrystals in this sense , such as i(alcufe )  @xcite and i(alpdmn )  @xcite , which both exhibit resolution - limited bragg peaks .",
    "two competing physical scenarios have been advanced to explain the origins of quasiperiodic ordering .",
    "one of them  the ` ideal tiling ' scenario  postulates that the atomic structure of a well - annealed quasicrystalline sample is perfectly quasiperiodic , like the two - dimensional penrose tiling  @xcite or its generalizations . in this scenario",
    "it is hypothesized that the microscopic hamiltonian constrains the local arrangements of atoms in such a way as to implement something akin to penrose s local ` matching rules ' , which force long - range quasiperiodicity .",
    "the alternative to this ideal tiling approach is the ` random tiling ' scenario , which also makes use of local clusters of atoms , with packing rules similar qualitatively to penrose s rules but insufficiently strong to force a unique behavior at long distances .",
    "this gives rise to an ensemble of different ways of packing atoms into the space occupied by the sample .",
    "normally we assume these different configurations to be nearly degenerate in energy . in the actual models",
    "studied , space is assumed to be filled by a finite set of local patterns which we represent by a set of tiles .",
    "such models have a contribution to their entropy arising from the many ways in which the tiles may be packed .",
    "this entropy can reduce the free energy with respect to crystalline structures ( which are expected to be stable at zero temperature ) , offering an alternative explanation of how the quasicrystal state might be stabilized  @xcite . to date",
    ", random - tiling models have been studied in two dimensions with 8-fold  @xcite , 10-fold  @xcite and 12-fold symmetries  @xcite , and in three dimensions with icosahedral symmetry  @xcite .    in principle",
    "it should be possible to construct random - tiling models so that there is a one - to - one mapping of tiling configurations onto real atomic configurations , via deterministic rules that specify how the tiles are to be decorated with atoms .",
    "then the configurational entropy ( and other thermodynamic quantities ) of the atomistic model will be identical to that of the tiling model .",
    "the decoration of random tilings to produce atomic models of the icosahedral phases is discussed in refs .  .",
    "this paper is principally concerned with random tiling models of quasicrystals .",
    "the qualitative predictions of these models and the ideal tiling models are very similar , to the extent that they are known .",
    "in particular both models predict the sharp bragg peaks observed in experiments .",
    "experiments aimed at resolving the differences between the two for real quasicrystals have still not conclusively settled the question one way or the other . however , there are some arguments we can present in favor of the random - tilings .",
    "one important point is that we have some understanding of how interatomic potentials might lead to a random - tiling structure .",
    "the simplest model for such a process is the 2d ` binary tiling ' , in which atoms of two different sizes aggregate in patterns which can be set in one - to - one correspondence with the configurations of a tiling of ` fat ' and ` skinny ' rhombi  @xcite .",
    "more recently , it has been shown in simulations that several 3d models with reasonable pair potentials for simple atoms ( al , mg , li , zn ) will freeze into structures which can be represented as configurations of a random tiling model  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , there is no understanding of how the thermodynamics of a system governed by a microscopic hamiltonian might give rise to the matching rules necessary for the ideal tiling scenario .",
    "in fact , the most promising recent advance in this direction has been achieved at the expense of blurring the distinction between random tilings and ideal quasicrystal models : one assumes an ensemble in which any of a large number of tilings is permitted , but adopts a hamiltonian such that the ground state , and the thermodynamic state if the temperature is not too large , is essentially an ideal quasicrystal  @xcite .",
    "the long - wavelength behavior of random tiling models is described by a sort of landau theory , which has two kinds of parameters : ( i ) the entropy density , and ( ii ) the ` phason strain ' ( see sec .",
    "most of the proposed experimental tests of the random - tiling scenario hinge around the expected variation of the entropy with this phason strain , which produces a kind of elastic term in the free energy .",
    "we describe this in more detail in the next section where we define the ` phason elasticity tensor ' , which measures the strength of this effect .",
    "it is predicted that the smallest eigenvalue of the phason elasticity tensor should decrease with decreasing temperature , producing instabilities of the quasicrystal phase with respect to other structures when the temperature becomes low enough  @xcite .    also , by contrast with the matching rule models , it is predicted that the phason elasticity for a random - tiling should have a gradient - squared form ( see section  ii  a ) .",
    "this leads to diffuse ` wings ' around peaks in the diffraction pattern , and to phason contributions to the debye - waller reduction of the bragg intensities , both of which can in principle be measured experimentally to determine values for the elastic constants .      in this paper",
    ", we build upon results from our previously published work  @xcite , henceforth referred to as paper i , to calculate a variety of properties of a random tiling ensemble based on the ` canonical cell ' model of a quasicrystal .",
    "this model has been described in detail by henley  @xcite .",
    "briefly , it consists of vertices or ` nodes ' which represent icosahedrally - symmetric clusters of atoms .",
    "nearest - neighbor nodes are joined by ` linkages ' of two types .",
    "type @xmath1 linkages run parallel to the axes of two - fold symmetry of the reference icosahedron and are all of the same length which we denote @xmath1 ; type @xmath2 linkages run parallel to the axes of three - fold symmetry , and all have length @xmath3 .",
    "the linkages can form three kinds of polygon which in turn form the faces of four kinds of tiles or ` canonical cells ' @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 into which the entire space is divided .",
    "( these cells were depicted in fig . 1 of paper  i and also fig . 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite . )    in paper  i we gave an algorithm for generating a so - called ` stacking graph ' for a random tiling , which we applied to the particular case of the canonical - cell tiling .",
    "this graph contains information about all possible structures that can be built out of a certain set of tiles with specified periodic boundary conditions . in this paper",
    ", we use this stacking graph as the basis for a transfer matrix calculation of the thermodynamic properties of the ensemble of random tilings of canonical cells , including the random tiling entropy and the phason elasticity  @xcite .",
    "these quantities have been found previously for another icosahedral random tiling , that of the two ammann rhombohedra  @xcite . the canonical - cell model , however , is different in at least two respects :    * it lends itself to the construction of realistic atomic models for icosahedral quasicrystals such as i(alculi )  @xcite , i(almnsi )  @xcite , i(ticrsi )  @xcite , and potentially i(alpdmn ) .",
    "it is possible to construct decorations of the canonical cells which incorporate our understanding of the basic atomic motifs found in these alloys and which contain no points of unrealistically close or loose packing . conversely it has not proved possible to relate the rhombohedron tiling to any good structure model . *",
    "the canonical cell model is , unfortunately , much less tractable technically than the tiling of ammann rhombohedra .",
    "in particular , monte carlo simulation has not been practicable because there is no known move that rearranges tiles locally and satisfies ergodicity .",
    "a possible chain - like or cluster move has been suggested by oxborrow  @xcite , but this move is still not completely understood .",
    "( it has been understood in a two - dimensional toy model , the square - triangle random tiling  @xcite , which shares some features with the canonical - cell tiling . )",
    "since we suspect that this kind of intractability is more generic than the behavior of rhombus and rhombohedron tilings  @xcite , it behooves us to develop appropriate methods for studying less agreeable tilings such as the canonical - cell tiling , even if some other tiling ultimately proves more relevant to real quasicrystalline phases .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we develop the elastic theory of random tiling ensembles , including the special cases that apply to the ensembles we will be studying with our transfer matrix method . in section",
    "iii we define our transfer matrix and explain how it is used to calculate thermodynamic properties of the ensemble as a function of phason strain . in section  iv we describe the calculations we have performed using the canonical - cell tiling , and give our results for the configurational entropy and phason elasticity of the tiling for a variety of system sizes . in section  v we present our conclusions .",
    "in studying icosahedral tilings , it is convenient to use a basis of unit vectors @xmath8 pointing from the center to vertices of the reference icosahedron , i.e. ,  along the fivefold symmetry axes .",
    "it turns out that every type @xmath1 linkage can be written as the sum of four of these basis vectors and every type @xmath2 linkage can be written as the sum of three of them .",
    "thus , having arbitrarily assigned @xmath9 at one node , every other node in a canonical - cell tiling may be represented in the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 are integers .",
    "the @xmath12 are independent over integers so this representation is unique .",
    "we can also define a ` phason ' coordinate for each node @xmath13 the vector @xmath14 lives in a space called ` phason ' space or ` perp ' space . as discussed elsewhere  @xcite , with a proper choice of basis vectors",
    "@xmath15 the perp - space coordinate is well - defined .",
    "we can view equations  ( [ defsr ] ) and  ( [ defsh ] ) together as defining a ` lifting ' of the nodes to points on a six - dimensional hypercubic lattice ; thus an arbitrary tiling configuration may be viewed as the projection of a three - dimensional surface embedded in six - space  @xcite . following the conventions of jari  @xcite",
    ", we write @xmath16 and @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19  @xcite . with these definitions ,",
    "the length of the @xmath1-type linkage is @xmath20 .",
    "we also define a coarse - grained phason coordinate @xmath21 where @xmath22 is an average over a neighborhood of @xmath23 .",
    "the phason strain tensor is then the gradient of @xmath24 in real space : @xmath25      consider an ensemble of tilings , possibly weighted with boltzmann probabilities derived from some hamiltonian @xmath26 .",
    "we hypothesize that the hamiltonian is sufficiently small , or the temperature sufficiently high , that difference in energy between configurations is typically much less than @xmath27 , so that the free energy of the ensemble will be dominated by the entropy .",
    "we further make the assumption that the relative weighting of long - wavelength phason fluctuations ( after coarse - graining ) will be determined by a free energy of the form  @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 @xmath30 is the elasticity tensor ( really a 4-tensor ) and @xmath31 is the system volume . in the case where the hamiltonian @xmath26 is zero for all states in the ensemble",
    ", @xmath32 is equal to minus the entropy per unit volume @xmath33  @xcite .",
    "it is important to be aware that this form for the free energy is just a hypothesis .",
    "we can not prove that @xmath34 must have an analytic minimum at @xmath35 , though it can be shown that , if the linkages in our tiling are uniformly distributed over all orientations equivalent by icosahedral symmetry , then @xmath14 is approximately constant .",
    "in other words , the hypersurface formed by the tiling in six - dimensional space is approximately flat , having only small phason fluctuations at non - zero wavevectors .",
    "thus the phason strain can be thought of as parametrizing the deviation from icosahedral symmetry , making it natural for @xmath36 to have a minimum at @xmath35 if the free energy is dominated by the entropy of the ensemble .",
    "it would in theory be possible for @xmath36 to have a non - analytic minimum at @xmath35 . however , in all models previously studied the analytic form  ( [ freal ] ) as been borne out both by analytic calculations and by simulations  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a random tiling has long - range order ( i.e. ,  bragg peaks exist ) if and only if @xmath37 has finite variance ; this can be shown to follow from the gradient - squared form  ( [ freal ] ) .",
    "it is common to deal with  ( [ freal ] ) by assuming that the net phason strain is zero and then re - expressing  ( [ freal ] ) in terms of fourier components @xmath38 ( this generalizes trivially to the case of any fixed background phason strain  see section  ii  b below ) .",
    "the result is a sum over wavevectors @xmath39 of terms each of which is a quadratic form in the three components of @xmath38 . the coefficients are linear in @xmath40 and quadratic in the components of @xmath39 .",
    "this form is simpler than  ( [ freal ] ) , since we write a quadratic form in three instead of nine quantities ( and , what is more , the different @xmath39 vectors decouple ) , and is appropriate for analyzing fluctuations from monte carlo simulations .",
    "however , the ensemble we will be working with in the present study permits undetermined phason strains with respect to only the ( real space ) @xmath41 direction , and we measure only the elasticities associated with that direction . in this case the fourier analysis is not useful , and we must struggle with the full form of the elastic free energy .    the elastic free energy for icosahedral symmetry can be written  @xcite @xmath42 if the icosahedral phase is to be stable against decomposition into other , possibly periodic phases , the quadratic stationary point in the free energy must be a minimum , rather than a saddle point or maximum .",
    "this requires that @xmath43 be positive definite , and @xmath44 may have either sign but must lie within the range @xmath45 the values of @xmath43 and @xmath44 are one of the main points of contact between quasicrystal experiments and random - tiling theory .",
    "knowing merely the ratio @xmath46 between the two is enough to determine the form of the diffuse scattering from the random tiling .",
    "consider now the case of a tiling with periodic boundary conditions in all three real space directions .",
    "the periodicity of the structure is represented by a set of vectors @xmath47 , which are the displacement in real space from a node to the corresponding node in another periodic repetition of the structure . since the vectors @xmath48 connect nodes",
    ", they can be written in the form  ( [ defsr ] ) , each with a corresponding perp displacement @xmath49 .",
    "the boundary conditions then constrain the system to have a global average phason strain @xmath50 , defined by the linear system of equations @xmath51 it will still be possible to consider fluctuations in the phason strain at finite wavevectors around this state , but when we consider the free energy associated with the phason elasticity , we must allow for the constraint on the long - wavelength phason strain by introducing lagrange multipliers .",
    "we will not follow through the complete analysis here , but merely quote the important results , which are    * the elastic free energy density @xmath36 is shifted by a constant term @xmath52 . *",
    "the quadratic term becomes @xmath53 .",
    "* most significantly , cubic and higher anharmonic terms now give contributions to the new quadratic term . thus the elasticity tensor in the presence of the background phason strain loses its icosahedral symmetry and retains only the symmetry of the bravais lattice defined by the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the deviations , however , will be at most of @xmath54 ( from the cubic terms ) .",
    "such terms in the elasticity were first measured by oxborrow  @xcite .",
    "in most of this paper , we consider a ` tower ' in which periodic boundary conditions are applied in only the @xmath55 and @xmath56 directions ; in the @xmath41 direction the tower can be arbitrarily large .",
    "the towers we will be considering have a square base and , of the icosahedral symmetry operations , only @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath41 reflections will be symmetries of the ensemble of possible configurations of cells in the tower ; in particular , notice that the @xmath55 and @xmath56 axes will be inequivalent , even though the dimensions of the base in the @xmath55 and @xmath56 directions are equal , since the icosahedral point group has no 4-fold axis of symmetry .",
    "for such a tower , only gradients with respect to the real - space @xmath41 coordinate remain free .",
    "gradients with respect to @xmath55 and @xmath56 are fixed by the periodic boundary conditions , giving rise to a background phason strain of the type discussed above .",
    "we define @xmath50 for a tower just as before except that the components @xmath57 are zero . then @xmath58 with @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the order of the approximant , with @xmath61 for the @xmath62 structures , @xmath63 for the @xmath64 , and so forth .",
    "all other components of @xmath50 are zero . for the phason strain tensor @xmath65 ,",
    "the boundary conditions give us just three free components @xmath66 out of the nine .",
    "these three components transform like a vector , which we will call @xmath67 , with @xmath68 we can write the free energy density for the tower in terms of this vector as @xmath69 there are no cross - terms , because of the reflection symmetry , but the linear term shown involving the constant @xmath70 is possible because the @xmath41 reflection symmetry reverses both @xmath71 and @xmath41 .    using equation  ( [ fico ] )",
    ", we can show that the constants in this formula are given by @xmath72 and @xmath73 we will calculate values for @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath70 using a transfer matrix method .",
    "since these quantities are all functions of two elastic constants @xmath77 , there is some redundancy in such a calculation , which allows us a check on the accuracy of our methods .",
    "inaccuracies can be ascribed to either ( i ) finite - size effects or ( ii ) finite-@xmath5 effects ( through the cubic terms in the elasticity theory , which we omitted ) .      the relative frequency with which various types of tiles appear in a random tiling is directly related to the phason strain . for example , in the case of certain extreme phason strains ,",
    "the tiling can be composed entirely of one type of tile . in some random tilings , the number densities of the different tile types",
    "is fixed exactly by the phason strain .",
    "the two - dimensional penrose tiling of rhombi is one such example . in the canonical cell tiling",
    "this is not the case , but there are still things we can say about the relationship of the number density of tiles to the phason strain . these topics were discussed in detail in ref .  .",
    "here , we will just summarize the situation .",
    "in addition to the phason strain , we can define many other macroscopic variables as the density ( per unit volume ) of occurrences of selected local patterns in the tiling .",
    "there are two reasons why we are interested in such patterns :    * when we come to decorate our tilings with real atoms to create possible atomic structures for icosahedral alloys , the simplest choice we can make is to use a single decoration for each type of canonical cell . in some cases a more satisfactory structure can be produced using a `` context - dependent '' rule , in which the decoration of a tile depends on the those of the tiles surrounding it . in either case",
    "the decoration depends on the local patterns in the tiling and the density and stoichiometry of the resulting structure are simple functions of the densities of those patterns . * as discussed below in section  iii  d , iteration of the transfer - matrix always generates an ensemble which maximizes the entropy _ per layer _ , whereas we actually want the ensemble which maximizes the entropy _ per unit volume_. we will be introducing chemical potentials which couple to the densities of local patterns in the tiling . by varying these chemical potentials",
    ", we can vary the relative frequency in the tiling of the various patterns and so generate an ensemble which is closer to the desired one  @xcite .",
    "the simplest and most important of the density variables are the densities of the tiles @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 .",
    "in fact , these densities can be parameterized by just one independent parameter @xmath78 , which is defined as the volume ratio @xmath79 $ ] , where @xmath80 is the total volume occupied by tiles of type @xmath81 .",
    "( this follows because @xmath82 and @xmath83 are unique functions of the phason strain ",
    "see eqs .",
    "( 3.1 ) and  ( 3.6 ) of ref .  .",
    ") this is important not only because @xmath78 determines the stoichiometry and density of simple decoration models , but also because it completely determines the density of nodes , i.e. ,  the frequency of the cluster motif in those models .",
    "furthermore , the bulky @xmath7 cell tends to force its surroundings , so increases in its density tend to decrease the entropy density and increase the volume added per dead - surface ( see sec .",
    "iii  a below ) .",
    "thus , the chemical potential conjugate to @xmath78 is the most important one for approaching the correct ensemble .    we can write a more general form for the free energy @xmath84 which has an absolute maximum at @xmath85 .",
    "( possibly it might depend on additional density parameters also , but for the moment we will stick to this simplest case . )",
    "then the expansion of @xmath36 around this maximum will contain terms such as @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is a new elastic constant .",
    "( cross terms between @xmath88 and @xmath78 are forbidden by symmetry . ) in the present calculations , this extra elastic constant is not physically relevant , for reasons which we discuss in section  iii  d below , so we define the entropy as the maximum @xmath89 $ ] , making it a function only of the phason strain .",
    "in the majority of previous calculations on three - dimensional random tilings , workers have made use of monte carlo methods to study the elastic properties . in two dimensions on the other hand ,",
    "the transfer matrix method has probably been as important as monte carlo simulation  @xcite .",
    "general views of the transfer matrix method as applied to two - dimensional quasicrystals may be found in ref .",
    ", sec .  8.5.1 , and in ref .",
    "transfer matrices provide a potentially exact way to calculate phason elasticity , and are more convenient for calculating entropies , which can be extracted from a monte carlo simulation only after integrating an entropy differential from zero to infinite temperature  @xcite . in the case of the twelve - fold ` square - triangle ' tiling  @xcite , a transfer - matrix formulation has made possible an exact solution with analytic expressions for the entropy density and the elastic constants  @xcite",
    ".    in the case of the canonical cell tiling , the implementation of a monte carlo simulation has , as noted above , been blocked by the lack of an update move .",
    "so instead , we have applied the transfer matrix method , using a new technique , which we now describe .",
    "as described in section  ii  c , we consider an ensemble of all configurations filling a ` tower ' with a given , finite base and having periodic boundary conditions in the transverse ( @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) directions , but unbounded in the @xmath41 direction .",
    "this reduces our three - dimensional problem to one which is essentially one - dimensional , and therefore amenable to a transfer matrix treatment .",
    "we specialize to the ` maximally random ' ensemble of tilings  @xcite , meaning that each tiling configuration has equal weight ( the hamiltonian @xmath26 is zero ) .    in paper",
    "i we demonstrated how our towers can be decomposed into layers , and how the set of all possible towers may be codified in a ` stacking graph ' , which represents all the different ways of stacking these layers one on top of another . in this section",
    "we review this development and then discuss how the stacking graph may be turned into a transfer matrix whose eigenvalues are related to the free energy of the ensemble of tilings .",
    "we will also have to deal with a few technicalities associated with the facts that ( i ) the layers do not have equal volume and ( ii ) we must be able to compute the free energy for any accessible phason strain .      the basis of our transfer - matrix approach is a rule for representing any given tower of cells by a sequence of layers of cells stacked in the @xmath41 direction , with a one - to - one correspondence between possible tilings and sequences of layers . given that we can formulate a rule for dividing our tower of cells into these layers ( possible strategies for doing this are discussed below ) we can then construct a ` stacking graph ' for the complete ensemble of tilings .",
    "the stacking graph consists of vertices joined by arrows ( see fig .  4 of paper  i , for example ) where each vertex represents one kind of layer , and an arrow from one vertex to another represents a possible way in which the first kind of layer can be followed by the second .",
    "any possible structure can then be described by a particular path through the stacking graph .",
    "there are two different approaches to dividing a system into layers . in the first approach , which has been used in all previous transfer matrix studies of random tilings , one slices the structure up into _ slabs _ of cells , which span the entire cross - section of the tower from side to side .",
    "the average number of cells in a slab thus scales with the cross - sectional area . in two dimensions ,",
    "the layers can often be mapped onto rows of sites on some lattice . by interpreting the stacking direction as a ` time ' axis , conditions on the allowed transitions from one layer to the next",
    "can then be interpreted as local rules for the hopping of a conserved set of particles moving in one dimension . making use of this idea for the case of the square - triangle tiling",
    ", a bethe ansatz solution has been found  @xcite , yielding exact analytic values for the entropy and elastic constants  @xcite .",
    "the decomposition of three - dimensional tilings into slabs is much less promising since each layer is itself a 2d random tiling spanning the cross - section of the tower . at every step in the construction of the stacking graph",
    ", we would need to completely enumerate all the possibilities for the next layer , and the number of such possibilities would grow exponentially as a function of the cross - sectional area , making the stacking graph extremely convoluted .",
    "so in paper  i we introduced a different approach , in which towers of canonical cells are divided into layers separated from one another by ` dead surfaces '  @xcite . using this method , we generated the stacking graph and applied it to the production of an exhaustive list of periodic structures on the square ` @xmath90 ' base  @xcite .",
    "the notion of a ` dead surface ' is linked with that of ` forcing ' .",
    "imagine that we build a tower of cells , starting from some initial base , by adding nodes one at a time to the open top surface .",
    "often , the top surface will have certain crevices which _ force _ the addition of a node at a particular place .",
    "the reason for this is that there are a number of linkages leaving each vertex in the surface , and there are only a finite number of different ways in which linkages are allowed to meet at a vertex .",
    "it is possible therefore , and indeed quite common , for the linkages which are already in place to restrict the number of possible choices for the ways in which a vertex can be completed .",
    "thus the addition of a linkage or linkages around that vertex may be ` forced ' , and with these forced linkages come new vertices that sit at their other ends .",
    "these are our forced nodes .    a surface which has _",
    "no _ forced nodes around any of its vertices is called a ` dead surface ' .",
    "we can produce a dead surface by taking a tower of canonical cells and adding all forced nodes to the top until no more additions are forced .",
    "the only choices we have to make in the construction of the tower are the ones we make about which node to add next when we are at a dead surface .",
    "thus , a list of the successive dead surfaces and the choices we made when we got to them are sufficient to specify the tiling uniquely .",
    "the typical number of cells between two successive dead surfaces is relatively small , and approaches a small limit as the cross - sectional area of the tower diverges , so that the work involved in finding a surface does not increase indefinitely with the size of the system . and",
    ", most important , the stacking graph is sparse , in the sense that there only a small number ( usually two ) of possible successors to a given dead surface ( by contrast with the slabs approach , in which there are exponentially many as the area of the slabs becomes large )  @xcite .",
    "the ` dead surface ' and ` slab ' approaches are contrasted in fig .",
    "[ layers ] , using the two - dimensional square - triangle tiling for pedagogical purposes .",
    "if we were simply to generate tilings at random by taking random paths through the stacking graph and reconstructing the towers of cells to which they correspond , we would not generate tilings with the same weights with which they appear in our ensemble . to see this ,",
    "consider a stacking graph in which , say , layer 1 can lead to two different layers , numbered 2 or 3 ; taking a random sequence means we would go to layer 2 or 3 with equal probability .",
    "but in the random - tiling ensemble , it may be that layer 2 is more likely than layer 3 .",
    "that will be the case if layer 2 ultimately leads to a larger number of tilings afterwards than layer 3 does .",
    "if we specify that all tilings should appear with equal weights ( @xmath91 ) , that is not the same as saying that all transitions from one layer to another appear with equal weights .",
    "it is in order to tackle this problem that we introduce the transfer matrix .    as explained in the preceding section , a tiling of @xmath92 layers",
    "is uniquely represented by a sequence of dead surfaces and the choices made to continue growing the tiling at each surface .",
    "we will denote this @xmath93 with @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the label of the @xmath96 dead surface and @xmath97 is the label of the transition @xmath98 in the stacking graph .",
    "( normally there will only be one choice we can make at surface @xmath95 that will lead us to surface @xmath99 .",
    "but occasionally there will be more than one way to make the transition , and in these cases we use the label @xmath97 to distinguish between them . )",
    "we also partition the hamiltonian into terms which each involve just two surfaces and the tiles contained between them : @xmath100 then the partition function can be written as @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the transfer matrix .",
    "the general form for the elements of the transfer matrix is @xmath103 note that @xmath104 is zero if there is no connection @xmath105 in the stacking graph ; for the particular case @xmath91 , @xmath106 is just the number of ways to get from @xmath107 to @xmath108 .",
    "the total weight in the partition function of all configurations of @xmath92 layers starting with layer @xmath107 and ending with layer @xmath108 is then @xmath109 .",
    "it can be seen that , whatever boundary conditions we choose for the first and last layers , the free energy _ per layer",
    "_ in the thermodynamic limit is @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the largest eigenvalue of @xmath102 .",
    "we are interested in computing the free energy for a range of phason strains , and also for a range of values of the parameter @xmath78 ( see section  ii  d ) .",
    "this means we must consider ( i )  how to measure the mean phason strain and density of a given ensemble , and ( ii )  how to generate ensembles with differing phason strain and density .",
    "these are dealt with in the next two subsections .",
    "having found the dominant eigenstate of the transfer matrix , we can extract the expectation of any operator @xmath112 that can be written in the form of a sum over the transitions from one dead surface to the next : @xmath113 if @xmath114 and @xmath115 are the left and right eigenvectors corresponding to @xmath111 , then the expectation of @xmath112 is @xmath116 thus , for example , the expectation of the hamiltonian , which is just the average energy per layer of the random tiling is @xmath117    a number of other useful operators besides the hamiltonian may be written in the form  ( [ operator ] ) . in particular , having designated a representative node on each dead surface , we can define vectors @xmath118 and @xmath119 which are respectively the step in physical space and in perp space from one dead surface to the next .",
    "then the total offset in physical and perp space are given by @xmath120 and @xmath121 in the thermodynamic limit , the phason strain tensor @xmath65 is then given by @xmath122 six of the nine components of @xmath65 take fixed values which we already know ( see section  ii  c ) .",
    "the remaining three we calculate from  ( [ htot ] ) .",
    "we can also write the total number of nodes as @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the number of nodes added between surfaces @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "since the total volume is given by @xmath127_z a^2   \\label{volume}\\ ] ] ( where @xmath128 is the length of the edge of the square base ) , the number density of nodes is given by the ratio @xmath129 .",
    "we wish to investigate ensembles of towers of canonical cells with different mean phason strains , so as to be able to maximize the random tiling entropy as a function of phason strain . in order to vary the average values of the three free phason strain components in our ensemble , we need to introduce terms into our hamiltonian which couple to the phason strain ,",
    "as mentioned briefly in section  ii  d. for example , if we want a particularly large @xmath130 component of phason strain , we should favor those transitions from one surface to another which contribute a large shift in the @xmath55 direction in perp space by comparison with the @xmath41 component of the accompanying real space shift .",
    "the appropriate form for the terms in the hamiltonian to achieve this is @xmath131 , where @xmath67 is the vector introduced in section  ii  c composed of the three free strain components , and @xmath132 is a vector whose components are chemical potentials coupling to the phason strain .",
    "then the entropy per layer @xmath133 is given by legendre transformation : @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the mean phason strain .",
    "physically , we are only interested in the case @xmath91 ; the chemical potentials are added solely as auxiliary fields in order to probe the variation of the entropy with phason strain .",
    "we can similarly introduce a chemical potential @xmath136 coupling to the the parameter @xmath78 , or equivalently to the packing fraction of nodes .",
    "however , we assume that @xmath78 is freely varying , since we do not envisage placing any physical constraint on our ensemble that would fix its value . so the appropriate course of action will always be to choose the value of @xmath136 that maximizes the entropy density  @xcite .    for a system which did have a non - zero hamiltonian ,",
    "the equilibrium value of the internal energy ( where @xmath137 ) would be given by @xmath138 and the equilibrium free energy , which is also the free energy at which the entropy is a maximum , is given by the legendre transform : @xmath139 so we can either look for the maximum of the entropy , or equivalently we can look for the zero of the free energy , to find the equilibrium values of @xmath67 and @xmath78 . in our particular calculations we maximized the entropy .",
    "it is not necessary , as it is in some models , that the maximum entropy occur at the point at which all the chemical potentials are zero .",
    "the zero of the chemical potentials in this model corresponds to the maximum of the entropy _ per layer _ , which has no particular physical significance .",
    "the physically interesting quantity in this case is the entropy _ per unit volume_. this quantity is not trivially related to the entropy per layer , since different layers make different contributions to the volume of the system .",
    "the calculation actually performed involves finding the entropy per layer and then converting it to an entropy density by dividing by the mean volume per layer within the ensemble : @xmath140 where @xmath141 is the @xmath41 component of the ensemble average of the operator @xmath118 .",
    "the mean volume per layer will vary with the chemical potentials as we weight layers of different volumes more or less heavily .",
    "because of the reflection symmetry of the ensemble in the @xmath55 and @xmath56 axes , we do in fact expect the minimum entropy density to fall at @xmath142 , but in general it will not also fall at @xmath143 and so we must probe a range of values of these chemical potentials to find it , calculating the entropy density as shown above .",
    "our calculation proceeds as follows .",
    "we define the transfer matrix @xmath102 as in equation  ( [ defstm ] ) using the list of possible transitions from one dead surface to another for a particular system generated from the stacking graph of paper  i. the systems we have looked at are the square - base canonical cell tilings with base of length @xmath144 , @xmath145 , and @xmath146 ( known as the ` @xmath62 ' , ` @xmath64 ' , and ` @xmath90 ' sizes ) .",
    "although the transfer matrix quickly becomes large as the system size increases ( the @xmath90 system has a transfer matrix some 7000 elements on a side ) it is very sparse , so that matrix multiplication can be performed quickly , in time of order the rank of the matrix rather than the number of elements .",
    "the great advantage of the method we have adopted is that the quantities we are interested can be calculated by evaluating only the largest eigenvalue of the matrix , and its associated left and right eigenvectors .",
    "we can find these by simply multiplying the matrix many times into a trial eigenvector . assuming this trial eigenvector has a non - zero component in the direction of the lowest eigenstate of the matrix",
    ", this will quickly give us the lowest eigenstate , and either one of the left or right eigenvectors of the system .",
    "we then repeat the process to find the other eigenvector , and from these we can evaluate the free energy per layer of our ensemble from equation  ( [ defsg ] ) and the free phason strain components @xmath67 from equation  ( [ htot ] ) as well as the parameter @xmath78 . using these",
    "we can evaluate the entropy density per node from equation  ( [ soverv ] ) .",
    "we then vary the values of the chemical potentials coupling to the phason strain and @xmath78 to find the maximum of the entropy for the ensemble , and the quadratic variation about that maximum to extract the coefficients @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 , and hence the phason elasticities . the most straightforward way to accomplish this turns out to be to repeat the calculation on a grid of values in the space of the three chemical potentials that make up the vector @xmath132 , maximizing always with respect to the remaining potential @xmath136 , as discussed in section  iii  d. then we perform a cubic least - squares fit to the resulting function . the quadratic terms in this fit",
    "give us our elasticities , and the cubic terms give us an estimate of the error involved in calculating second derivatives at the maximum using what is essentially a finite difference method .",
    "for the ` @xmath62 ' system , which has a base of length @xmath144 and a background phason strain of @xmath147 , we find that one of the horizontal components of the phason strain  the one that we call @xmath148can only take one value no matter what sequence of layers we stack one on top of another .",
    "thus the corresponding elasticity parameter , @xmath75 , is infinite .",
    "the other two parameters are finite . for the ` @xmath64 ' system ,",
    "which has a base of length @xmath145 and a background phason strain of @xmath149 , all three @xmath6 parameters have finite values , but the system is still sufficiently constrained that the packing fraction of nodes , or equivalently the parameter @xmath78 , takes only one value independent of the order in which we stack surfaces to construct our tower , so that there is no possibility of allowing this parameter to fluctuate and maximizing the entropy with respect to it .",
    "the first system large enough to exhibit the generic elastic behavior typical of towers of canonical cells with large bases is the ` @xmath90 ' system , which is also the largest system we have tackled . in this system , which has a square base of length @xmath146 on each side and a background phason strain of @xmath150 , all three components of the strain vector @xmath67 are free to fluctuate under the influence of their corresponding chemical potentials , as is the parameter @xmath78 which measures the density of nodes of the tiling .",
    "figure  [ entropy ] shows a contour plot of the entropy surface @xmath151 $ ] as a function of the phason strains @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "the maximum entropy density is @xmath154 , and falls at @xmath155 and at a small non - zero value of @xmath153 ( @xmath156 ) , as predicted .",
    "( it also falls at @xmath157 , though this is not evident from the figure . )",
    "we have also studied the dependence of the entropy on @xmath78 and we find that for a given @xmath65 , it depends very sharply on @xmath78 .",
    "there is a narrow valley in the plot of @xmath84 centered around the plane @xmath158 . in consequence , if we fix @xmath78 , the apparent dependence of @xmath34 on @xmath65 is very sharp .",
    "( note that , for the 2/1 and 3/2 cases , @xmath78 is in fact a function of @xmath88the values of the background phason strain are so high in those cases that the valley has zero width . )",
    "if we just omit ( set to zero ) the @xmath136 parameter , thereby accepting the ensemble which maximizes the entropy _ per layer _ at a given phason strain , then we find an entropy density which differs from the actual value by only about three parts in @xmath159 .",
    "we assume that the difference produced by including terms in the hamiltonian coupling to other densities of local tiling patterns is smaller still , and therefore that we were justified in neglecting them in this calculation .    the value of the parameter @xmath78 at the maximum of the entropy for the @xmath90 ensemble was 0.334 , which is close to the `` magic '' value of @xmath160 obtained at the end of ref .  .",
    "the corresponding packing fraction @xmath161 for spheres of radius @xmath2 placed on the nodes may be determined from formulas given in sec .",

    "the packing fraction at which the maximum entropy occurs can be written roughly as @xmath166 for the @xmath90 case , with virtually no dependence on @xmath152 or @xmath148 .",

    "however , it is possible to make out some trends in the data as the system size increases :    * there is a clear tendency to oscillate between high and low values of the elastic constants from one approximant to the next .",
    "* superimposed on this oscillation , there is also a strong tendency for @xmath169 to decrease with increasing system size .",
    "the first of these trends is to be expected if the errors are caused by the large background phason strain @xmath5 , in view of equation  ( [ bps ] ) .",
    "the same oscillation is seen in the monte carlo simulations of the rhombohedral tiling by shaw  _ et  al .",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "( see , for instance , figure  2 in that paper . )",
    "we suggest that  ( ii ) is also a finite-@xmath5 effect .",
    "the phason strain tensor components define a 9-dimensional space , and there is a domain in this space ( centered on zero ) of allowed phason strains .",
    "the entropy density vanishes with singular derivatives at the boundary of this domain .",
    "when @xmath5 is large , the phason strain tensor is necessarily closer to the boundary of the allowed domain , and the second derivatives of the entropy density ( including the coefficients @xmath169 ) are consequently larger . in addition , the tendency for @xmath33 to be larger for smaller systems also enhances @xmath169 , because increasing the maximum value of a function , while at the same time decreasing the interval over which it must rise from 0 to its maximum and fall back to zero , obviously forces it to have a larger ( negative ) second derivative .",
    "so what can we say about the extrapolation of the data to infinite system sizes ?",
    "the entropy density @xmath33 at least , appears to be far from its asymptotic value in the systems we have studied here .",
    "indeed , on the basis of these data alone , one could not really rule out @xmath170 in the infinite - system limit  @xcite !    for the coefficients @xmath169",
    ", in view of the large values of @xmath75 for the 2/1 and @xmath76 for the 3/2 , we have extrapolated the inverses @xmath171 .",
    "we have assumed the behavior @xmath172 where @xmath173 is the value of @xmath169 measured for the @xmath174 approximant and @xmath5 is background phason strain .",
    "for each @xmath169 , we have extrapolated from the pair @xmath175 and the pair @xmath176 and taken the mean of these as the extrapolated value , writing error bars to span the two independent extrapolations  @xcite .",
    "the results are given in the `` extrap '' column of the table .",
    "we have also performed a slightly different analysis of the @xmath177 system using just the 316 approximants described in paper  i. this calculation is detailed in appendix  a , and in the column marked ",
    "@xmath90 ( f ) in the table .",
    "each of these different estimates give us four quantities @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath70 , but there are only two independent parameters @xmath43 , @xmath44 to fit to them .",
    "this places constraints on the four quantities with which their measured values are not entirely consistent .",
    "however , we can certainly conclude that @xmath178 , and that @xmath44 is negative and fairly large ( possibly close to the instability limit  ( [ stability ] ) ) .",
    "this sign of @xmath44 is opposite to that in the rhombohedral tiling , a fact that we can explain qualitatively by the following argument .    from  ( [ defsc ] )",
    "we have @xmath179 so that @xmath180 if and only if @xmath181 fluctuates more than @xmath182 as one walks along a path in the @xmath41 direction . examining the tiling , we find that the linkages along such a path are dominated by the 2-fold @xmath1 linkage that runs entirely along @xmath41 , and by the 3-fold @xmath2 linkage @xmath183 . in our basis",
    "( [ perp ] ) , these @xmath2 linkages have perp space components only in the @xmath55 directions , making the @xmath55-fluctuations large compared with the @xmath56 ones , which in turn makes @xmath44 negative . on the other hand , the linkage vectors in the rhombohedral tiling are just the basis vectors in  ( [ parallel ] ) ; thus the dominant steps in the direction of the path are @xmath184 which has fluctuations in the @xmath182 direction rather than the @xmath181 direction .",
    "thus for that tiling @xmath185  @xcite .    for applications of random tilings to structural fitting , the parameter of greatest interest is the effective phason debye - waller factor @xmath186 , which corresponds to the extra variance in perp space due to the randomness of the tiling .",
    "the experimental value of @xmath186 is of the order of 1@xmath187 . in appendix",
    "b , using the ensemble of 316 packings  @xcite , we find a crude theoretical estimate of @xmath186 for the canonical - cell random tiling which is somewhat smaller .",
    "finally , we would like to consider whether there is the possibility of performing a calculation for a larger system . probably there is .",
    "it would tax the power of the available computing resources , but it should be possible .",
    "we estimate ( see paper  i ) that the next largest size of system  the @xmath188 system  should have a stacking graph of about one million dead surfaces . given that the average number of nodes added between one dead surface and another tends to a constant as the system becomes large ,",
    "we expect the time taken to construct the graph to scale as the number of dead surfaces , and so we would require about 200 times as much cpu time to perform the calculation as we did for the @xmath90 system . with today",
    "s high - performance computing resources , such a calculation would be just within the bounds of possibility .",
    "using the results of a previously - presented method for breaking down and cataloging three - dimensional random tilings , we have defined a transfer matrix whose eigenstates describe the properties of an ensemble of random - tiling configurations in the shape of towers with a finite area base and infinite extent in the @xmath41 direction .",
    "the ensemble has a mean phason - strain and packing fraction controlled by chemical potentials whose values we can choose .",
    "the transfer matrix is sparse and so can be efficiently multiplied into a trial eigenvector to find the largest eigenvalue .",
    "this gives us the free energy density and thus the entropy density for the ensemble .",
    "maximizing this with respect to the components of phason strain and the packing fraction we can find the equilibrium values of these quantities , and the variation of the entropy density about the maximum , which defines the phason elasticity constants which are related to experimentally measurable quantities such as phason debye - waller factors , and diffuse scattering close to bragg peaks .",
    "we have applied our method to the ` canonical - cell tiling '  @xcite for towers with a square base with sides taking the three smallest non - trivial lengths possible .",
    "for the two smaller of these systems , we find that the systems have additional constraints making their elastic behavior different from the generic behavior expected of large systems .",
    "the largest system we have studied , which we refer to as the ` @xmath90 ' system is the smallest one that exhibits the same elastic behavior as a large system . from this system",
    "we have extracted a value of @xmath154 for the entropy per unit volume .",
    "the two fundamental elastic constants , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , are over - determined by the transfer matrix calculation because elasticities corresponding to the strains in various directions are related by symmetries of the system .",
    "this gives us a way to estimate the ( finite - size ) errors in our calculation , and it turns out that the values for @xmath43 and @xmath44 are not very accurate for this smallest of systems .",
    "our best estimate is that @xmath43 lies in the range 0.8 to 1.1 , and @xmath180 .",
    "in addition , the requirement that the tiling be elastically stable with respect to other phases means that @xmath189 .",
    "it is interesting to compare our results for the canonical - cell tiling with those for the rhombohedral random tiling  @xcite . in doing so",
    ", we must be careful to allow for the different lengths of the linkages making up these tilings .    in the rhombohedral tiling",
    "@xcite the entropy per node @xmath190 is @xmath191 , whereas in the canonical - cell tiling  @xcite it is only @xmath192 .",
    "this is a result of the fact that the canonical - cell tiling is more constrained in the states it can take than the rhombohedral tiling .",
    "this constraint is also responsible for limiting the canonical - cell tiling to only 32 distinct local node environments  @xcite .",
    "by contrast , the node environments of the rhombohedral random tiling are chosen from @xmath193 of different possibilities  @xcite .    to compare the elastic constants of the two tilings , we first define a characteristic unit of phason strain @xmath194 to be the ratio of the perp- and real - space displacements of the fundamental linkage .",
    "@xmath194 is 1 and @xmath195 for the rhombohedral and canonical - cell tilings , respectively .",
    "then a dimensionless measure of the elastic constant @xmath43 is the corresponding decrease in free energy per node for a phason strain of magnitude @xmath194 : @xmath196 where @xmath60 is the packing fraction of nodes . for the rhombohedral tiling , @xmath197 , @xmath198 and @xmath199 , hence @xmath200 ; for the canonical - cell tiling , using the extrapolated values @xmath201 , very similar to the rhombohedral case  @xcite .",
    "although the results for the elastic properties of the small canonical - cell systems show signs of being strongly influenced by finite - size effects , we believe that it should be feasible using modern supercomputing resources to perform a similar calculation for a larger system which should yield a more accurate estimate of the elastic constants for the infinite random canonical - cell tiling .",
    "we also believe that the method we have presented , which is fundamentally different from transfer matrix methods previously used in the study of random tilings , should be applicable to any random - tiling model in any number of dimensions . even if the canonical - cell model does not ultimately turn out to be as good a model of real icosahedral phases as some other ( yet to be proposed ) tiling , we believe this method will prove useful in the calculation of experimentally measurable properties of quasicrystals .",
