    "in this paper we investigate the reduced kronecker product @xmath1_\\bullet\\star[{\\mu}]_\\bullet$ ] which can be viewed roughly as the kronecker product @xmath2[(n-{\\left| { \\mu}\\right|},{\\mu})]$ ] for @xmath3 big enough . here and in the following the kronecker product is the kronecker product of the characters of the symmetric group over the field @xmath5 .",
    "first results about the reduced kronecker product can already be found in murnaghan s work @xcite of the year 1937 .",
    "the reduced kronecker product has , as we will see , some nicer properties than the ordinary kronecker product and there is also a relation to the ordinary outer product of two irreducible characters , involving the famous littlewood richardson coefficients .    in the following",
    "we classify the reduced kronecker products which are multiplicity free and those which contain less than @xmath4 components .",
    "furthermore , we give general lower bounds for the number of constituents and components of a given reduced kronecker product .",
    "we also give a lower bound for the number of pairs of components whose corresponding partitions differ by one box .",
    "we also argue that equality of two reduced kronecker products is only possible in the trivial case that the factors of the product are the same .",
    "we mostly follow the standard notation in @xcite or @xcite .",
    "a partition @xmath6 is a weakly decreasing sequence of non - negative integers where only finitely many of the @xmath7 are positive .",
    "we regard two partitions as the same if they differ only by the number of trailing zeros and call the positive @xmath7 the parts of @xmath8 .",
    "the length is the number of positive parts and we write @xmath9 for the length and @xmath10 for the sum of the parts . for a partition @xmath8",
    "we set @xmath11=(n-{\\left| { \\lambda}\\right|},{\\lambda})$ ] which is again a partition for @xmath12 .",
    "furthermore , we denote by @xmath13 the number of different parts of @xmath8 .",
    "we will use @xmath14 always to refer to the staircase partition : @xmath15    with a partition @xmath8 we associate a diagram , which we also denote by @xmath8 , containing @xmath7 left - justified boxes in the @xmath16-th row and we use matrix - style coordinates to refer to the boxes .",
    "the conjugate @xmath17 of @xmath8 is the diagram which has @xmath7 boxes in the @xmath16-th column .",
    "the partition @xmath18 is obtained from @xmath8 by inserting a column containing @xmath19 boxes .",
    "the partition @xmath20 is obtained from @xmath8 by inserting a row containing @xmath19 boxes .",
    "inserting a row is the conjugate of inserting a column : @xmath21 .",
    "both operation can be generalized to arbitrary partitions : @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "for example we have : @xmath24    we say that a partition @xmath8 is larger than @xmath25 if @xmath8 can be obtained from @xmath25 by repeatedly using the operations @xmath26 with arbitrary partitions in any order .",
    "the irreducible characters @xmath1 $ ] of the symmetric group @xmath27 are naturally labeled by partitions @xmath28 .    since the characters are functions we can define the ordinary product @xmath1[{\\mu}](\\pi)=[{\\lambda}](\\pi)[{\\mu}](\\pi)$ ] which is again a character and called kronecker product .",
    "since it is a character we can write it as a sum of irreducible characters @xmath29[{\\mu}]=\\sum_{\\nu}g({\\lambda},{\\mu},{\\nu } ) [ { \\nu}]\\ ] ] where the @xmath30 are the kronecker coefficients",
    ". the kronecker coefficient stays constant if one permutes the @xmath31 and from multiplication with the sign character it follows : @xmath32    we say that a character @xmath33 $ ] is of cc - type @xmath34 if @xmath35 has @xmath36 components and @xmath37 constituents .",
    "the kronecker product has a nice stabilizing property which we will demonstrate with an example : @xmath38[22]&=[31]\\phantom{+[62]}\\;\\:+\\phantom{2}[21 ^ 2],\\phantom{+[53]+2[521]+[51 ^ 3]+[431]+[421 ^ 2]}\\\\ [ 31 ^ 2][32]&=[41]+[32]+2[31 ^ 2]\\phantom{+[53]}\\;\\:+\\phantom{2}[221]+[21 ^ 3],\\phantom{+[431]+[421 ^ 2]}\\\\ [ 41",

    "we define the sequence @xmath11=(n-{\\left| { \\lambda}\\right|},{\\lambda}_1,{\\lambda}_2,\\ldots)$ ] which is a weak composition of @xmath3 for @xmath39 and a partition of @xmath3 if @xmath40 .",
    "the stabilizing property of the kronecker product then means that for all partitions @xmath0 there is an integer @xmath3 such that for all @xmath41 and all partitions @xmath42 we have : @xmath43,{\\mu}[n],{\\nu}[n ] ) = g({\\lambda}[n+k],{\\mu}[n+k],{\\nu}[n+k]).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    so it makes sense to define the reduced kronecker coefficients @xmath44,{\\mu}[n],{\\nu}[n])\\ ] ] which is by murnaghan s theorem well defined .",
    "there is also a correspondence of the schur functions @xmath45 to the irreducible character @xmath1 $ ] .",
    "it is well known ( see for example @xcite ) that the schur functions can be expressed via the jacobi - trudi determinant @xmath46 which allows to define the schur function @xmath47}$ ] even for the case that @xmath11 $ ] is not a partition .",

    "let @xmath59_\\bullet| { \\lambda}\\textnormal { a partition}\\}$ ] be a basis for a @xmath5 vector space .",

    "this means that the coefficients in @xmath48[{\\mu}[n]]$ ] stabilize for @xmath65 .",
    "this means that we can calculate @xmath1_\\bullet \\star[{\\mu}]_\\bullet$ ] with stembridge s maple package @xcite by calculating @xmath48[{\\mu}[n]]$ ] for @xmath65 .",

    "we have in @xmath128_\\bullet\\star[{\\delta}_n]_\\bullet$ ] the following number of pairs of characters whose diagrams differ by one box ( where type @xmath34 means that one character is labeled @xmath19 and the other @xmath194 ) : @xmath207    the first four numbers are clear since all diagrams labeled @xmath208 or @xmath195 differ from @xmath14 by only one box .",
    "the numbers for type @xmath209 and type @xmath210 are also clear since all diagrams of characters of type @xmath194 differ from one another only by the additional box .",

    "there are @xmath216 places in which we can add a box to @xmath213 to obtain a partition @xmath214 whose corresponding character is of type @xmath195 .",

    "that the pairs of type @xmath209 correspond to pairs of characters whose partitions have as size the sum of the sizes of @xmath130 and @xmath14 .",
