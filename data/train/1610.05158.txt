    "* ) , in our simulations they seem to be mainly due to the choice of the fit interval in the inertial range , which is slightly different for each value of @xmath0 ( note that the break shifts towards larger scales for larger betas and the inertial range gets consequently shorter ) .",

    "[ fig : spectra_together ] .",
    "indeed , @xmath22 is systematically less and less steep increasing the plasma beta , ranging from around @xmath4 for @xmath74 until around @xmath5 for @xmath87 , although we observe a more general power - law spectrum with a constant spectral index @xmath88 for the parallel magnetic fluctuations instead ( see sec .",

    "the fact that the slope increases a little bit again towards @xmath89 for @xmath90 is likely due to numerical effects : the spatial resolution , and consequently @xmath91 , is smaller and fewer particles are employed , so that the noise level at small scales is higher and this slightly affects also the slope .",
    "while the extent of the power - law range at large scales is about a full decade for all the simulations , the one at sub - ion scales is usually smaller , being still between half a decade and a decade in most cases . in this respect ,",
    "it s important to stress that , although fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra_singlebeta ] provides an insight on the whole range of @xmath0 , including the extreme regimes , only the central panel is truly representative of most of the simulations in terms of the extent of power - law ranges .",
    "the other two panels allow appreciating how the method works in the worst cases , i.e. , when the sub - ion range is reduced due to the shift of the break towards smaller scales ( for low betas ) or to the lower resolution ( for large betas ) .",
    "although the extent of the fit intervals at sub - ion scales is not as large as a full decade , we can still identify a power - law behavior rather than an exponential cutoff , which would be typical of resistive effects .",
    "the local spectral index @xmath22 is observed to be reasonably constant , with only very small variations , in the whole fit interval in all the panels of fig .  [",
    "fig : spectra_singlebeta ] , especially in the middle one .",
    "the same result would not hold in the case of an exponential cut - off , since @xmath22 would clearly decrease before starting growing again at small scales due to numerical noise .",
    "alternatively , we also determined the break position by performing the global fits over the two ranges of wavevectrors selected with the method explained above , plotting the straight lines which correspond to the best fit ( blue and red dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra_singlebeta ] , respectively ) and determining the break as the intercept between the two .",
    "we can say a posteriori that the difference between the determination of the break by the two different methods is almost negligible for all the simulations performed .    in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : break_vs_scales ] , we report the computed break scale in terms of @xmath92 ( top panel ) and @xmath93 ( middle panel ) , as a function of @xmath0 , for all the simulations performed . for @xmath94",
    "the points seem to settle towards an asymptotic value which is fixed in terms of @xmath12 . by fitting with a straight line , we get @xmath95 . on the contrary , when the plasma beta decreases to values @xmath96",
    "the points seem to approach a constant value in terms of @xmath6 . by fitting with a straight line , we get an asymptotic value @xmath97 . since the ion inertial length and the ion gyroradius are related by @xmath98 , we find that @xmath99 for @xmath7 and @xmath100 for @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , the break is found to be related to the largest of the two scales in both these separated ranges of values of the plasma beta .",
    "differently , the spectral break does not show any clear correlation with one of the two scales when @xmath10 , meaning that it is likely related to a combination of @xmath6 and @xmath12 when they are comparable .    in the bottom panel of fig .",

    "this fact is corroborated by the polarizations of the fluctuations at small scales ( not shown here , but the particular case with @xmath120 was already presented in @xcite ) , which show a good agreement with the prediction of the kaw linear theory for @xmath121 and are consistent with the fact that @xmath12 is the expected scale for such transition in this regime ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". this would be consistent with the results by @xcite , which observe a dominance of kaw for @xmath121 but not for lower betas .",
    "the dispersive nature of kaw in regulating the break in the magnetic field spectrum is much more problematic when @xmath122 since @xmath6 , the scale we observe in this limit , seems to be relevant for kaw only under special circumstances ( @xmath123 and for @xmath124 ) or in presence of a large component of turbulence in @xmath118 @xcite .",
    "these conditions are not fulfilled in our simulations .",
    "it has been suggested that the ion - scale transition could be mainly due to the dissipation occurring in reconnecting current sheets .",
    "indeed , the scale at which such transition occurs corresponds to the maximum in the current density spectrum , suggesting that most of current structures develops at that scale . as already shown in fig .",
    "2 of @xcite and therein discussed , while turbulence develops many current sheets are generated around and between coherent structures . once formed ,",
    "these are observed to quickly disrupt due to the onset of fast reconnection .",
    "a look at the out - of - plane current density in our simulations seems to qualitatively support this interpretation : the current sheets form and shrink , and their width when reconnection occurs seems to be of the order of @xmath6 in all simulations with @xmath125 and larger when @xmath126 .",
    "if this process was the main responsible for the break , we would expect the associated length scale to be related to the current sheet width .",
    "solar wind observations @xcite indicate that such width , although variable , scales better with @xmath6 for @xmath127 and with @xmath12 for @xmath90 @xcite .",
    "actually , the agreement between our numerical results and @xcite observations also extends to large betas .",
    "this could be a hint that the break might be related to reconnection for all betas .",
    "current sheets and reconnection likely play an important role in plasma turbulence ( cf .",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite pointed out that this scaling is in contradiction with results from previous simulations @xcite and laboratory measurements of reconnection with a large guide field @xcite , where the current sheets thickness in the @xmath7 condition is found to be the sound gyroradius , @xmath128 ( @xmath129 when @xmath130 ) .",
    "however , the definitions of @xmath131 used in the above papers can not be easy exploited in solar wind observations , since they take into account only the reconnecting ( i.e. , in - plane ) magnetic field .    in our simulations ,",
    "the scale at which the magnetic field spectrum breaks is found to be quite well approximated by a single relation , @xmath132 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : breakscale ] ) , being able to recover both the asymptotic behavior in the limits of low ( @xmath133 ) and high beta ( @xmath134 ) and the intermediate - regime scaling ( a combination of the two ) .",
    "this relationship is qualitatively similar to that proposed by @xcite ( basically , a mean of the @xmath6 and @xmath12 ) for values @xmath135 , although here it can not be easily interpreted in terms of a resonant condition . at this level ,",
    "it should be regarded as an empirical relation which can mask either a single process dominating for all betas ( e.g. , the current sheet width ) or different processes , each one dominating at one characteristic ion scale when they are well separated and , instead , mixing in the intermediate regime @xcite , for example kinetic alfvn waves for high @xmath0 and magnetosonic - like for low @xmath0 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the simulation method used in this work has a couple of limitations , i.e. , the lack of electron kinetic processes and the reduced dimensionality . in the hybrid approach electrons are treated as a fluid , thus not capturing processes such as the electron landau damping and electron kinetic instabilities .",
    "although these processes may affect the turbulent dynamics at very small scales , possibly modifying the spectral properties in the sub - ion range , they are not expected to change the transition from large- to small - scale turbulence at ion - scales .",
    "the dissipation at the electron scales is to some extent replaced by using a finite resistivity , @xmath67 . in @xcite",
    ", we qualitatively checked if and how the slope in the sub - ion range is affected by @xmath67 .",
    "we showed that by fine - tuning its value and controlling the scale associated to it , one can be able to separate regimes where the sub - ion spectral behavior reflects a physical cascade from cases where the change in the slope can be ascribed to purely resistive effects .",
    "therefore , in the present work we can be reasonably confident that the sub - ion spectral slopes ( where shown and discussed ) are physically meaningful and indicative of a cascade process . consistently with this , in the series of runs 39 we only vary @xmath0 by keeping the same level of fluctuations , resolution , and resistivity , so we can exclude that steeper slopes for lower betas originate from more and more effective resistive term and claim that the systematic change in @xmath22 with @xmath0 has a physical motivation .",
    "the used 2d geometry allows the very high resolution and the large simulation box size needed to accurately determine the position of the ion - scale break , but the reduced dimensionality might affect the development of the turbulent cascade and of kinetic instabilities .",
    "however , preliminary 3d runs in a similar settings confirm that the perpendicular cascade is not strongly modified ( see also @xcite ) , thus suggesting that 2d simulations represent an adequate tool to investigate the spectral break .    in conclusion , our main findings about the effects of @xmath0 on the magnetic field spectrum are that : i ) the slope of the power law in the sub - ion range depends on @xmath0 , ii ) the shape and position of the ion - scale transition also depend on @xmath0 , and iii ) we inferred an empirical relation for the length corresponding to the ion spectral break , @xmath136 /3 $ ] , that well describes the simulation results for all values of @xmath0 .    further investigation is needed to better clarify the nature of the ion - scale spectral break .",
    "an accurate statistical study about the current sheets thickness ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) would allow to quantitatively investigate its scaling with the plasma beta .",
    "an analysis about the effects of @xmath0 on the ion heating and temperature anisotropy and their correlation with the current density and vorticity @xcite will be also the subject of future work .",
