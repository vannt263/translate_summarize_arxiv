    "the harp experiment  @xcite at the cern ps was designed to make measurements of hadron yields from a large range of nuclear targets from hydrogen to lead and for incident particle momenta from 1.5 to 15  gev / c .",
    "the main motivations are the measurement of pion yields for a quantitative design of the proton driver of a future neutrino factory and a super - beam  @xcite , a substantial improvement in the calculation of the atmospheric neutrino flux  @xcite and the measurement of particle yields as input for the flux calculation in accelerator neutrino experiments  @xcite , such as k2k  @xcite , miniboone  @xcite and sciboone  @xcite .",
    "in addition to these specific aims , the data provided by harp are valuable for validation and tuning of hadron production models used in simulation programs .",
    "the harp experiment is described in more detail below in order to illustrate some common features of modern hadron production experiments .    to provide a large angular and momentum coverage of the produced charged particles the harp experiment makes use of a large - acceptance spectrometer consisting of forward and large - angle detection systems .",
    "a detailed description of the experimental apparatus can be found in ref .",
    "the forward spectrometer  based on large area drift chambers  @xcite and a dipole magnet complemented by a set of detectors for particle identification ( pid ) : a time - of - flight wall  @xcite ( tofw ) , a large cherenkov detector ( che ) and an electromagnetic calorimeter  covers polar angles up to 250  mrad which is well matched to the angular range of interest for the measurement of hadron production to calculate the properties of conventional neutrino beams . the large - angle spectrometer  based on a time projection chamber ( tpc ) located inside a solenoidal magnet  has a large acceptance in the momentum and angular range for the pions relevant to the production of the muons in a neutrino factory .",
    "it covers the large majority of the pions accepted in the focusing system of a typical design .",
    "the neutrino beam of a neutrino factory originates from the decay of muons which are in turn the decay products of pions .",
    "a full set of data collected by the harp experiment with solid thin ( 5% of nuclear interaction length , @xmath0 ) and cryogenic targets have been analyzed and published  @xcite .",
    "those results cover all the physics subjects discussed above .",
    "a detailed description of established experimental techniques for the data analysis in the harp forward spectrometer can be found in refs .  @xcite .",
    "only a brief summary is given here .",
    "the absolutely normalized double - differential cross - section for a process like @xmath1 can be expressed in bins of pion kinematic variables in the laboratory frame ( momentum , @xmath2 , and polar angle , @xmath3 ) , as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the cross - section in @xmath6 for each ( @xmath7 ) bin covered in the analysis ; @xmath8 is the reciprocal of the number density of target nuclei ; @xmath9 is the thickness of the target along the beam direction ; @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the bin sizes in momentum and solid angle ( @xmath12 ) ; @xmath13 is the number of protons on target after event selection cuts ; @xmath14 is the yield of positive pions in bins of true momentum and angle in the laboratory frame .",
    "( [ eq : truexsec ] ) can be generalized to give the inclusive cross - section for a particle of type @xmath15 @xmath16 where reconstructed quantities are marked with a prime and @xmath17 is the inverse of a matrix which fully describes the migrations between bins of true and reconstructed quantities , namely : lab frame momentum , p , lab frame angle , @xmath18 , and particle type , @xmath15 .",
    "there is a background associated with beam protons interacting in materials other than the nuclear target ( parts of the detector , air , etc . ) .",
    "these events are subtracted by using data collected without the nuclear target in place after normalization to the same number of protons on target .",
    "this procedure is referred to as the ` empty target subtraction ' .",
    "the event selection is performed in the following way : a good event is required to have a single , well reconstructed and identified beam particle impinging on the nuclear target .",
    "a downstream trigger in the forward trigger plane ( ftp ) is also required to record the event , necessitating an additional set of unbiased , pre - scaled triggers for absolute normalization of the cross - section .",
    "these pre - scaled triggers ( e.g. 1/64 ) are subject to exactly the same selection criteria for a ` good ' beam particle as the event triggers allowing the efficiencies of the selection to cancel , thus adding no additional systematic uncertainty to the absolute normalization of the result .",
    "secondary track selection criteria have been optimized to ensure the quality of the momentum reconstruction as well as a clean time - of - flight measurement while maintaining high reconstruction and particle identification efficiencies  @xcite .",
    "the first harp physics publication  @xcite reported measurements of the @xmath19 production cross - section from a thin 5%  @xmath0 aluminum target at 12.9  gev / c proton momentum .",
    "this corresponds to the energy of the kek ps and the target material used by the k2k experiment .",
    "the results obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite were subsequently applied to the final k2k neutrino oscillation analysis  @xcite , allowing a significant reduction of the dominant systematic error associated with the calculation of the so - called far - to - near ratio from 5.1% to 2.9% ( see  @xcite and  @xcite for a detailed discussion ) and thus an increased k2k sensitivity to the oscillation signal .",
    "the next harp goal was to contribute to the understanding of the miniboone and sciboone neutrino fluxes .",
    "they are both produced by the booster neutrino beam at fermilab which originates from protons accelerated to 8.9  gev / c by the booster before being collided against a beryllium target .",
    "a fundamental input for the calculation of the resulting @xmath20 flux is the measurement of the @xmath19 cross - sections from a thin 5%  @xmath0 beryllium target at exactly 8.9  gev / c proton momentum .",
    "these double - differential cross - sections were measured in the kinematic range from @xmath21  gev / c and @xmath22  rad , subdivided into 13 momentum and 6 angular bins  @xcite . a typical total uncertainty of 9.8% on the double - differential cross - section values and a 4.9% uncertainty on the total integrated cross - section are obtained .",
    "these harp results have been used for neutrino flux predictions  @xcite in the miniboone  @xcite and sciboone experiments  @xcite .",
    "sanford and wang  @xcite have developed an empirical parametrization for describing the production cross - sections of mesons in proton - nucleus interactions ( e.g. @xmath23 ) .",
    "this sanford - wang ( sw ) parametrization has the functional form : @xmath24 p^{c_{2 } }   ( 1-\\frac{p}{p_{\\hbox{\\footnotesize b } } } ) \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath25 denotes any system of other particles in the final state ; @xmath26 is the proton beam momentum in gev / c ; @xmath27 and @xmath18 are the @xmath19 momentum and angle in units of gev / c and radians , respectively ; @xmath28 is expressed in units of mb/(gev / c  sr ) ; @xmath29 ; and the parameters @xmath30 are obtained from fits to meson production data .",
    "harp data were fitted using this empirical sw parametrization .",
    "this is a useful tool to compare and combine different data sets .",
    "a global sw parametrization for forward production of charged pions as an approximation of all the studied datasets is provided in ref .",
    "it can serve as a tool for quick yields estimates .",
    "the next harp analysis was devoted to the measurement of the double - differential production cross - section of @xmath31 in the collision of 12  gev / c protons ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fw_carbon ] ) and pions with a thin 5%  @xmath0 carbon target  @xcite .",
    "these measurements are important for a precise calculation of the atmospheric neutrino flux  @xcite and for a prediction of the development of extended air showers .",
    "simulations predict that collisions of protons with a carbon target are very similar to proton interactions with air .",
    "this hypothesis could be directly tested with the harp data .",
    "measurements with cryogenic o@xmath32 and n@xmath32 targets  @xcite , also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fw_carbon ] , confirm that p - c data can indeed be used to predict pion production in p - o@xmath32 and p - n@xmath32 interactions .",
    "it is important to emphasize that a systematic campaign of measurements was performed by harp : all thin target data taken with pion beams are analyzed and published now  @xcite .",
    "similar results were also obtained for incoming protons  @xcite . moreover , results on forward proton production in p-@xmath33 and @xmath31-@xmath33 interactions were published recently  @xcite .",
