    "starting with the seminal paper on strong equivalence between logic programs by lifschitz , pearce , and valverde , a new research direction in logic programming under the answer - set semantics has been established .",
    "this is due to fact that strong equivalence between programs @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which holds iff @xmath0 can faithfully be replaced by @xmath1 in any program , is a different concept than deciding whether @xmath0 and @xmath1 have the same answer sets , i.e. ,  whether ( ordinary ) equivalence between @xmath0 and @xmath1 holds .",
    "formally , @xmath0 and @xmath1 are strongly equivalent iff , for each further so - called context program @xmath2 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 possess the same answer sets .",
    "that difference between strong and ordinary equivalence motivated investigations of equivalence notions in between ( see @xcite for an overview ) .",
    "such equivalence notions were obtained in two basic ways , viz .  to bound the actually allowed context programs @xmath2 by ( i ) restricting their syntax ; or ( ii ) restricting their alphabet .    for case  ( i ) , it turned out that any `` reasonable '' ( i.e. ,  where the restriction is defined rule - wise , for instance only allowing context programs with horn rules ) attempt coincides with either ordinary , strong , or uniform equivalence ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . the later notion , uniform equivalence ,",
    "was originally introduced by sagiv   as an approximation for datalog equivalence and has been adapted to answer - set programming by eiter and fink  .",
    "uniform equivalence tests whether , for each set @xmath6 of facts , @xmath7 and @xmath8 possess the same answer sets . case",
    "( ii ) , where the atoms allowed to occur in @xmath2 are from a given alphabet @xmath3 yields in general different concepts for different @xmath3 and thus is known as strong equivalence relative to @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "a combination of both approaches leads to the concept of uniform equivalence relative to @xmath3  @xcite . and",
    "@xmath5 are compared .",
    "this kind of _ projection _ was investigated in  @xcite , but is beyond the scope of this work . ]    in this paper , we propose a framework to define more fine - grained notions of equivalence , such that the aforementioned restrictions are captured simultaneously .",
    "this is accomplished by parameterizing , on the one hand , the atoms which are allowed to occur in the rule heads of the context programs and , on the other hand , the atoms which are allowed to occur in the rule bodies of the context programs .",
    "more formally , the problem we study is as follows , and we will refer to it as @xmath9-equivalence :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ given programs @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and alphabets @xmath10 , @xmath11 , decide whether the answer sets of @xmath4 and @xmath5 coincide for each program @xmath2 , where each rule in @xmath2 has its head atoms from @xmath10 and its body atoms from @xmath11 . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    as we will show , for all such kinds of equivalence it is safe to consider only unary rules ( that are simple rules of the form @xmath12 or @xmath13 ) in context programs @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , instances of @xmath9-equivalence include all previously mentioned equivalence notions . in particular , for @xmath14 , i.e. ,  disallowing any atom to occur in bodies , our notion amounts to uniform equivalence relative to @xmath10 .",
    "moreover , the parameterization @xmath15 amounts to relativized strong equivalence . as a consequence ,",
    "we obtain ( unrelativized ) strong equivalence if @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the universe of atoms , and ( unrelativized ) uniform equivalence if @xmath18 and @xmath14 .",
    "the main contribution of the paper is to provide a general and uniform semantic characterization for the newly introduced framework .",
    "moreover , we show that our characterization includes as special cases prominent ones for strong and uniform equivalence , namely the so - called se - models due to turner  , and respectively , the so - called ue - models due to eiter and fink  , and thus clarifies the differences which have been observed between these known characterizations . as well , the relativized variants of se - models and ue - models @xcite will be shown to be special cases of our new characterization .",
    "finally , we address the computational complexity of the decision problems for the introduced equivalence notions .",
    "the complexity results suggest to implement tests for @xmath9-equivalence via existing dedicated systems for checking ordinary equivalence .",
    "we briefly sketch such a method at the end of the paper .",
    "the benefits of the introduced framework are twofold . on the one hand",
    ", we provide a unified method to decide different notions of equivalence by the same concept .",
    "so far , such methods were conceptually different for strong and uniform equivalence , and thus our results shed new light on the origin of these differences . on the other hand , the introduced equivalence notion allows to precisely specify in which scenarios a program @xmath0 can be replaced by a potential simplification @xmath1 .",
    "for instance , suppose a program @xmath0 is given over atoms @xmath17 and provides an output over atoms @xmath19 .",
    "these output atoms are only used in rule bodies of potential extensions of @xmath0 , whereas all other atoms can be used arbitrarily in such extension . in such a scenario , @xmath1",
    "can faithfully be used as a simplification of @xmath0 , in case @xmath9-equivalence between @xmath0 and @xmath1 with parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 holds .",
    "throughout the paper we assume an arbitrary finite but fixed universe @xmath17 of atoms .",
    "subsets of the universe are either called interpretations or alphabets : we use the latter term to restrict the syntax of programs , while the former is used in the context of semantics for programs . for an interpretation @xmath22 and an alphabet @xmath3",
    ", we write @xmath23 instead of @xmath24 .    a propositional disjunctive logic program ( or simply , a program )",
    "is a finite set of rules of the form @xmath25 ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) , and where all @xmath28 are propositional atoms from @xmath17 and @xmath29 denotes default negation ; for @xmath30 , we usually identify the rule ( [ eq : r ] ) with the atom @xmath31 , and call it a _",
    "fact_. a rule of the form ( [ eq : r ] ) is called a _ constraint _ if @xmath32 ; _ positive _ if @xmath33 ; _ normal _ if @xmath34 ; and _ unary _ if it is either a fact or of the form @xmath13 .",
    "a program is positive ( resp . ,",
    "normal , unary ) iff all its rules are positive ( resp . ,",
    "normal , unary ) .",
    "if all atoms occurring in a program @xmath0 are from a given alphabet @xmath35 of atoms , we say that @xmath0 is a program _ over _ ( alphabet ) @xmath3 . the class of all logic programs ( over the fixed universe @xmath17 ) is denoted by @xmath36 .    for a rule @xmath37 of the form ( [ eq : r ] ) , we identify its head by @xmath38 and its body via @xmath39 and @xmath40",
    ". we shall write rules of the form ( [ eq : r ] ) also as @xmath41 . moreover , we use @xmath42 . finally , for a program @xmath0 and @xmath43 , let @xmath44 .",
    "the relation @xmath45 between an interpretation @xmath22 and a program @xmath37 is defined as usual , i.e. , @xmath45 iff @xmath46 , whenever jointly @xmath47 and @xmath48 hold ; for a program @xmath0 , @xmath49 holds iff for each @xmath50 , @xmath45 .",
    "if @xmath49 holds , @xmath22 is called a _ model _ of @xmath0 . following gelfond and lifschitz",
    ", an interpretation  @xmath22 is an _ answer set _ of a program @xmath0 iff it is a minimal ( w.r.t .  set inclusion ) model of the _ reduct _ @xmath51 of @xmath0 w.r.t .",
    "the set of all answer sets of a program @xmath0 is denoted by @xmath52 .",
    "next , we review some prominent notions of equivalence , which have been studied under the answer - set semantics : programs @xmath53 are _ strongly equivalent _  @xcite , iff , for any program @xmath54 , @xmath55 ; @xmath0 and @xmath1 are _ uniformly equivalent _  @xcite , iff , for any set @xmath56 of facts , @xmath57 .",

    "if @xmath60 , we obtain _ ordinary equivalence _",
    ", i.e. ,  @xmath61 for both strong and uniform equivalence relative to @xmath3 .    in case of strong equivalence",
    "( also in the relativized case ) , it was shown  @xcite that the syntactic class of _ counterexamples _ ,",
    "i.e. ,  programs @xmath2 , such that @xmath62 , can always be restricted to the class of unary programs .",
    "hence , the next result comes without surprise , but additionally provides insight with respect to the alphabets in the rules heads and bodies .",
    "[ lemma:1 ] for any programs @xmath0 , @xmath63 and any interpretation @xmath22 , there exists a positive program @xmath64 such that @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 iff @xmath68 .",
    "recall that @xmath49 iff @xmath69 holds .",
    "moreover , @xmath70 is clear .",
    "thus , @xmath67 iff @xmath71 is obvious . by definition @xmath72",
    "is positive and satisfies @xmath73 , @xmath74 .",
    "thus the claim follows using @xmath75 .",
    "as we will see later , lemma  [ lemma:1 ] can even be strengthened to a unary program @xmath64 . in terms of equivalence checking",
    ", lemma  [ lemma:1 ] has some interesting consequences .",
    "first , observe that if two programs @xmath0 , @xmath1 do not have the same answer sets , the _ common _ rules @xmath2 from @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be significantly simplified , without changing the witnessing answer set @xmath22 .",
    "second , in terms of strong equivalence , the result shows that whenever a counterexample @xmath2 for a strong equivalence problem between @xmath0 and @xmath1 exists , i.e. ,  @xmath76 does not hold , then we can find a simpler , in particular , a positive counterexample @xmath64 , which is given over the same alphabets ( as @xmath2 ) for heads , and respectively , bodies . in other words , for deriving proper different equivalence notions , it turns out that the alphabets of the atoms allowed to occur in rule heads , and respectively , ( positive ) rule bodies of the context programs are the crucial parameters .",
    "we now formally ground these considerations and start by introducing the following classes of logic programs .",
    "[ def : class ] for any alphabets @xmath77 , the class @xmath78 of programs is defined as @xmath79 .    with this concept of program classes at hand , we define equivalence notions which are more fine - grained than the ones previously discussed .",
    "let @xmath77 be alphabets , and @xmath53 be programs .",
    "the _ @xmath9-equivalence problem _ between @xmath0 and @xmath1 , in symbols @xmath80 , is to decide whether , for each @xmath81 , @xmath55 .",
    "if @xmath80 holds , we say that @xmath0 and @xmath1 are _",
    "@xmath9-equivalent_.    the class @xmath78",
    "is also called the _ context _ of an @xmath9-equivalence problem , and a program @xmath82 , such that @xmath83 does not hold , is called a _ counterexample _ to the @xmath9-equivalence problem between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "[ ex:1 ] consider programs @xmath84 it is known that these programs are not strongly equivalent , since adding any @xmath2 which closes the cycle between @xmath85 and @xmath86 yields @xmath62 .",
    "in particular , for @xmath87 , we get @xmath88 , while @xmath89 . however , @xmath0 and @xmath1 are uniformly equivalent . in terms of @xmath9-equivalence",
    "we are able to `` approximate '' equivalence notions which hold between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "it can be shown that , for instance , @xmath90 or @xmath91 holds ( basically since @xmath92 does not occur in any program in @xmath93 , or @xmath94 ) . on the other hand , @xmath95 , and",
    "likewise , @xmath96 , since @xmath97 is contained in the context @xmath98 , resp .",

    "@xmath100    observe that the concept of @xmath9-equivalence captures other equivalence notions as follows : @xmath101-equivalence coincides with strong equivalence relative to @xmath3 ; and , in particular , @xmath102-equivalence coincides with strong equivalence .",
    "we will show that @xmath103-equivalence amounts to uniform equivalence relative to @xmath3 ; and , in particular , @xmath104-equivalence amounts to uniform equivalence .- equivalence with respect to those special cases , see figure  [ fig:1 ] in the conclusion . ]",
    "note that the relation to uniform equivalence is not immediate since @xmath103-equivalence deals with a context containing sets of _ disjunctive _ facts , i.e. ,  rules of the form @xmath105 , rather than sets of ( simple ) facts , i.e. ,  rules of the form @xmath12 .",
    "a central aspect in equivalence checking is the quest for semantical characterizations which are assigned to a _",

    ", we have introduced an equivalence notion parameterized by two alphabets to restrict the atoms allowed to occur in the heads , and respectively , bodies of the context programs .",
    "we showed that our approach captures the most important equivalence notions studied , including strong and uniform equivalence as well as relativized notions thereof .",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ] gives an overview of @xmath9-equivalence and its special cases , i.e. ,   relativized uniform equivalence ( rue ) , relativized strong equivalence ( rse ) , body - relativized equivalence ( bre ) , and head - relativized equivalence ( hre ) .",
    "on the bottom line we have ordinary equivalence , while the top - left corner amounts to uniform equivalence ( ue ) and the top - right corner to strong equivalence ( se ) .",
    "future work includes the study of further properties of @xmath9-equivalence , as well as potential applications , which include relations to open logic programs @xcite and new concepts for program simplification  @xcite .",
    "an extension of @xmath9-equivalence from disjunctive logic programs to theories is a further aspect to be considered . in particular , this requires a reformulation of the concept of @xmath9-models in terms of the logic of here - and - there ( which was used in @xcite to characterize strong equivalence between theories under equilibrium logic , a generalization of the answer - set semantics ) .",
    "we expect that such a generalization of our results can be accomplished in similar manner as this was done for relativized strong and uniform equivalence  @xcite .",
    "also an extension of the framework in the sense of  @xcite , where a further alphabet for answer - set projection is used to specify the atoms which have to coincide in comparing the answer sets is of interest . while eiter et al .",
    "provide a characterization for relativized _ strong _ equivalence with projection , recent work @xcite addresses the problem of relativized _ uniform _ equivalence with projection .",
    "our results may be a basis to provide a common view on these two concepts of program correspondence , as well .",

    "<S> logic programming under the answer - set semantics nowadays deals with numerous different notions of program equivalence . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the fact that equivalence for substitution ( known as strong equivalence ) and ordinary equivalence are different concepts . </S>",
    "<S> the former holds , given programs @xmath0 and @xmath1 , iff @xmath0 can be faithfully replaced by @xmath1 within any context @xmath2 , while the latter holds iff @xmath0 and @xmath1 provide the same output , that is , they have the same answer sets . notions in between strong and ordinary equivalence have been introduced as theoretical tools to compare incomplete programs and are defined by either restricting the syntactic structure of the considered context programs @xmath2 or by bounding the set @xmath3 of atoms allowed to occur in @xmath2 ( relativized equivalence ) . for the latter approach , different @xmath3 yield properly different equivalence notions , in general . for the former approach , however , it turned out that any `` reasonable '' syntactic restriction to @xmath2 coincides with either ordinary , strong , or uniform equivalence ( for uniform equivalence , the context ranges over arbitrary sets of facts , rather than program rules ) . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we propose a parameterization for equivalence notions which takes care of both such kinds of restrictions simultaneously by bounding , on the one hand , the atoms which are allowed to occur in the rule heads of the context and , on the other hand , the atoms which are allowed to occur in the rule bodies of the context . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a general semantical characterization which includes known ones as se - models ( for strong equivalence ) or ue - models ( for uniform equivalence ) as special cases . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we provide complexity bounds for the problem in question and sketch a possible implementation method making use of dedicated systems for checking ordinary equivalence .    </S>",
    "<S> answer - set programming , strong equivalence , relativized equivalence . </S>"
