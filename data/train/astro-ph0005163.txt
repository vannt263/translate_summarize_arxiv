    "a spectrophotometric monitoring program of 5 narrow - line seyfert 1 ( nls1 ) galaxies was conducted at the wise observatory ( wo ) during the summer and fall of 1999 .",
    "the observations were performed with the wo spectrograph , and on separate occasions a ccd camera was used for broad - band photometry .",
    "long - slit spectroscopy was carried out using a 10 \" wide slit for both the target nls1s and nearby comparison stars , which were verified as non - variables by the photometric monitoring .",
    "the prime target of observation was akn 564 , which was under a continuous monitoring campaign , coordinated by the agn watch consortium , from both ground - based observatories and rxte . in figure  [ shemmer_fig_1 ] we present",
    "h@xmath0 and optical continuum ( observed 6950  band ) light curves for akn 564 , observed from wo . from the light curve it is evident that no significant variability was recorded for the object either on long or short time scales . in view of the extreme x - ray variability of nls1s ( preliminary results from the rxte",
    "program show that during the first three months of the optical program , the object varied by over 100% in x - ray flux ) , this behavior is definitely surprising and is atypical of seyfert 1 galaxies with broader emission lines",
    ".    two more nls1s from the sample did not show any significant variability : i zw 1 and ucm 2257 + 2438 , the latter ( in sharp contrast with the former ) showing very weak fe ii bands as opposed to other nls1s ( figure  [ shemmer_fig_2 ] ) .",
    "mrk 335 and ngc 4051 , which were also in our sample , varied on short as well as on long time scales , as already seen in previous monitoring campaigns ."
