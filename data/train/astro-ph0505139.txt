    "it is important to determine the composition of unevolved stars in globular clusters in order to learn the basic composition of the cluster from stars that have not undergone any mixing with the interior layers .",
    "we include as `` unevolved stars '' both main sequence and turn - off stars .",
    "it is well known that there can be large spreads in the abundance of some elements in the giant stars of a given globular cluster ( e.g. kraft 1994 , sneden et al .",
    "most previous high - resolution studies were limited to giant stars , whose atmospheres and interiors are less well modeled than those of dwarf stars .",
    "more extensive studies of the unevolved stars , which have little or no advanced nuclear processing _ in situ _ , are expected to reveal the clusters original composition .",
    "it now seems clear that mixing and evolutionary effects in cluster giants mean that these stars can not be used to probe the original abundance patterns in clusters . the the light elements ( e.g. c , n , o , na , al ) in the giants evince rich intra - cluster differences that makes it impossible to ascertain a universal pattern of light element alterations .",
    "good evidence exists , e.g. , that cno cycling and nena / mgal burning in m13 has a considerable _ in situ _ component ( pilachowski et al .",
    "1996 ; briley & cohen 2001 ) .",
    "conventional wisdom now holds that such abundance modifications can be explained by a combination of @xmath5-capture reactions ( denisenkov & denisenkova 1990 ; langer , hoffman & sneden 1993 ) and some non - standard deep mixing mechanism ( cavallo , sweigart & bell 1996 ) perhaps operating particularly more efficiently in low metallicity clusters owing to smaller stellar interior mean molecular weight gradients .",
    "the most direct means , however , to explore _ in situ _ versus primordial ( or self - enrichment ) mechanisms is to determine the composition of unevolved stars in globular clusters .",
    "more extensive studies of the unevolved stars , which have little or no advanced nuclear processing _ in situ _ , are expected to provide a baseline of clusters red giants original composition(s ) onto which the additions - by other mechanisms - are made .",
    "several groups have begun studying globular cluster stars over a range of evolutionary stages , including turn - off stars at high spectral - resolution ( e.g. gratton et al .",
    "2001 ; cohen & melndez 2005 ) .",
    "these initial efforts , and previous photometric and low - resolution spectroscopic results , have revealed strong evidence that some light element abundance alterations in some clusters are present prior to reaching the red giant branch , thus suggesting the possibilities of primordial variations , self - enrichment mechanisms , or totally unexpected mixing mechanisms .",
    "briley et al .  ( 1994 ) found anti - correlated cn and ch band strength variations at the turnoff of 47 tuc , and suggested that this cluster s cn distribution changes little with evolutionary status ; additionally striking is the existence of na abundance variations on the 47 tuc main - sequence reported by briley et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . utilizing keck data ,",
    "briley & cohen ( 2001 ) find that cno abundances in m71 show little evolution from the main - sequence to bright giants ; moreover , the bimodal and anti - correlated cn and ch distributions of m71 red giants are found to be in place on the main - sequence .",
    "gratton et al .",
    "( 2001 ) find that an o - na ( and mg - al and c - n ) anticorrelation , previously seen only in globular red giants , exists in turn - off stars in ngc 6752 .",
    "ramrez & cohen ( 2002 ) ( hereafter rc02 ) utilized high - resolution keck / hires data to find that an o - na anticorrelation exists in m71 from its turnoff to giants above the red hb level . for an excellent review of globular cluster abundances and abundance variations , see gratton , sneden & carretta ( 2004 ) .",
    "we have embarked on a high spectral - resolution study of turn - off stars in a number of globular clusters .",
    "such stars are faint , so to observe them at high resolution requires long integration times on the largest telescopes .",
    "we have used the keck i 10-m telescope with hires to make observations of @xmath6 turn - off stars in m92 , m71 , m13 , and m5 .",
    "results on m92 have been published on li in boesgaard et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and on fe , na , mg , ca , ti , cr and ba in king et al .",
    "the latter paper found [ fe / h ] = log n(element / h)@xmath7/log n(element / h)@xmath8 = @xmath92.52 for unevolved stars , compared to @xmath92.25 for giants found by sneden et al .",
    "the reason for the dwarf - giant difference remains unclear , but the homogeneous analyses of ngc 6397 and 6752 ( gratton et al .",
    "2001 ) and m71 ( ramrez & cohen 2001 , rc02 ) indicate no difference in [ fe / h ] values ( or fe peak , @xmath10-capture , and @xmath3-element abundances for the m71 cluster ) between turnoff stars and more evolved cluster stars .",
    "king et al .  ( 1998 ) also found large mg depletions and na enhancements compared to hd 140283 , a mildly evolved halo subgiant with similar [ fe / h ] and evolutionary state ; [ ba / fe ] also appeared to be enhanced in the m92 stars compared to hd 140283 .",
    "king et al .",
    "( 1998 ) noted these qualitative patterns were reminiscent of those believed to be due to mgal and nena cycling in red giants .",
    "( see the recent discussion by aikawa et al .",
    "( 2004 ) on the reaction rates in these chains related to observations in red giants in globular clusters . )",
    "additionally , they dedicated considerable discussion to wrestling with the difficulty in understanding how such processing ( whether _ in situ _ or from polluted material processed in a previous stellar generation ) could co - exist without resulting in remarkably depleted li abundances .",
    "bonifacio et al .",
    "( 2002 ) noted a similar `` paradox '' for ngc 6397 , which appears to be analogous to that seen in the metal - poor field ( spite & spite 1986 ) .",
    "bonifacio et al .",
    "( 2002 ) mention preliminary evidence of prominent n enhancements in ngc 6397 subgiants , indicative of cn processing or supernovae in massive stars .",
    "if those enhancements are due to internal processing in their turnoff stars , then how does li remain `` normal '' ?",
    "similarly , thvenin et al .",
    "( 2001 ) note that one of their ngc 6397 turn - off stars demonstrates a relative 0.4 dex na deficiency ; however , this star also evinces unremarkable li .",
    "this summary paints a complex and rich picture of globular cluster abundances  one that will probably only be understood on a cluster - by - cluster ( if not star - by - star ) basis .",
    "here we present observations , analysis , and results from a study of five turn - off stars in m71 .",
    "we have determined abundances for three iron - peak elements ( fe , cr , and ni ) , four alpha - fusion elements ( mg , si , ca , and ti ) , two rare - earth elements ( y and ba ) and na .",
    "the globular cluster m71 is especially interesting for this work because it is very old ( @xmath11 gyr ; grundahl , stetson & andersen 2002 ) , yet relatively metal - rich ( [ fe / h]@xmath12 ) for a globular cluster .",
    "sneden et al .",
    "( 1994 ) ( hereafter sklps ) find [ fe / h ] = @xmath90.79 from 10 red giants .",
    "cohen , behr & briley ( 2001 ) , ramrez et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and rc02 have reported on keck / hires observations of m71 of stars of a variety of evolutionary stages including three stars near the turn - off .",
    "the stars we observed in m71 have the same age , mass , luminosity , and temperature as each other and as the stars in m 92 , but the two clusters differ in metallicity by a factor of @xmath050 .",
    "we have selected m 71 because 1 ) it is a little brighter than m 92 at the turnoff ( @xmath13 versus 18.0 ) ; 2 ) despite considerable reddening ( @xmath14 ) , it has excellent photometry ( hodder et al .",
    "1992 ) ; 3 ) it is a disk globular with relatively high metal content ; 4 ) its space motion indicates that it is probably a member of the thick disk population ( cudworth & hanson 1993 ) .",
    "we report on our four general goals : first , to characterize the abundances of relatively unevolved stars in m71 .",
    "second , to compare these with determinations from both other near - turnoff stars ( rc02 ) and red giants ( sklps , rc02 ) in m71 .",
    "third , to compare our m71 turn - off abundances with those in field halo stars and field disk stars of the same metallicity .",
    "fourth , to search for evidence of photospheric material having suffered @xmath5-capture and deep mixing .",
    "keck / hires spectral observations with respectable signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratios of stars near v = 18 require exposures of several hours .",
    "however , individual intergration times did not exceed 45 - 60 minutes due to the contamination by `` cosmic ray '' events . on the other hand ,",
    "the exposures needed to be long enough to obtain a high enough signal so that individual frames could be co - added reliably at the correct wavelength justification . in metal - poor stars where the spectral lines are weak",
    "this can be problematic .",
    "therefore , we could only make these observations on cloudless nights with good seeing .",
    "the spectra for this project were obtained at the keck 10-m telescope with hires ( vogt et al .",
    "1994 ) over three observing seasons on four observing runs comprising seven nights .",
    "the same settings ( slit dimensions , echelle and cross - disperser angles , filters ) were used on each run .",
    "approximately 2400  were covered from 4430  6880  with some gaps between orders longward of 5000  .",
    "the positions in the color - magnitude diagram of our five stars can be seen in figure 1 .",
    "the fiducial sequence is taken from hodder et al .",
    "( 1992 ) .",
    "the details of the observations for our five stars are shown in table 1 which gives the dates of the observations and the details of the multiple exposures on multiple nights .",
    "the star identifications are those of hodder et al .",
    "the photometric data for v and ( b@xmath9v ) are from hodder et al .",
    "( 1992 ) as is the assumed reddening correction of e(b@xmath9v ) = 0.28 .",
    "this value of the reddening agrees well with that of both zinn ( 1980 ) of 0.27 @xmath20.03 and that of geffert & maintz ( 2000 ) of 0.27 @xmath20.05 .",
    "the final column shows the signal - to - noise ratio of the combined spectra . as can be seen in table 1 , the integration times were 135 - 285 minutes to reach the listed s / n ratios ( per pixel ) of 50 - 60 .",
    "we have also made use of a spectrum of the moon as a solar proxy that we obtained with the same settings on hires as our stellar spectra .",
    "the lunar spectrum was a 30 s exposure obtained on 29 july 1994 with a s / n ratio near 1400 .",
    "standard data reduction procedures were carried out with iraf routines .",
    "individual frames were trimmed , overscan - subtracted , and bias - subtracted ( the median of numerous overscan - subtracted bias frames from each night ) . typically 20 quartz flat - field exposures were obtained each night and these processed frames were combined to form a master nightly flat - field frame .",
    "frames of the stars in m71 were pre - processed in the same fashion and then divided by a normalized flat field , which was produced by fitting a low order spline to the blaze+lamp function .",
    "scattered light was removed by fitting a low - order polynomial to the inter - order regions across the dispersion and smoothing them along the dispersion .",
    "cosmic ray hits were removed interactively .",
    "typically , 29 orders were identified , traced and extracted .",
    "the wavelength scale was found from the positions of many lines in each order of the th - ar comparison spectrum .",
    "the measured spectral resolution is @xmath045,000 .",
    "the dispersion - corrected , extracted 1-dimensional spectra were co - added order - by - order .",
    "the final spectrum of each star was then continuum normalized .    for most of the spectral analysis",
    "the individual orders were smoothed by a 3-pixel boxcar in order to increase the effective s / n ratio with minimal impact upon the spectral resolution .",
    "examples of two spectral regions in the spectra for three of the stars are shown in figures 2 and 3 .",
    "spectral features from several ions are identified in these figures .",
    "the three stars shown all have the same value of ( b@xmath9v ) and the line strengths are clearly similar in all three .",
    "we have made measurements of the equivalent widths of some 200 lines in each of our five stars and 117 in the sun / moon spread throughout the 29 orders of our keck spectra .",
    "the relevant features include those of the : fe - peak elements ( and , and , and ) ; alpha - fusion elements ( , and , , and and ) ; the alkali element na ( ) ; and the neutron - capture elements ( and ) . the splot package in iraf was used to measure the equivalent widths via gaussian profile fitting .",
    "lines that were noticeably blended were not used ; thus , nearly all could be measured using both sides of the line profile .",
    "the measured equivalent widths ranged from 7 to 200 m , but lines used for the parameter and abundance determinations were typically @xmath15  .",
    "table 2 provides the species , wavelengths , lower excitation potentials , oscillator strengths , and equivalent widths for all five stars and the sun . the log gf values in table 2 are from the compilations presented in stephens ( 1999 ) and stephens & boesgaard ( 2002 ) .",
    "we have used the @xmath16 values from hodder et al .",
    "( 1992 ) to determine the stellar effective temperature of each star .",
    "although the reddening of 0.28 is high , the good agreement with the values of zinn ( 1980 ) and geffert & maintz ( 2000 ) suggest that it is rather well - determined .",
    "hodder et al .",
    "give errors in b@xmath9v of 0.01 for stars in this v magnitude range .",
    "we then use the ( b@xmath9v)@xmath17 values to find t@xmath18 for both the carney ( 1983 ) ( c83 ) and the king ( 1993 ) ( k93 ) temperature scales for metal - poor stars , as we have done in earlier work ( e.g.  boesgaard et al .",
    "in addition , we used ( b@xmath9v)@xmath17 and a nominal metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath19 ) to find t@xmath18 values on the irfm scale of alonso et al .",
    "1996 ) ; these temperatures agree almost exactly with those on the c83 scale .",
    "the uncertainty in the temperatures comes from random errors in the photometry ( 0.01 mag ) , the large reddening , and the calibrations .",
    "random errors of @xmath20 mag in both the photometry and reddening estimate both contribute an uncertainty of @xmath21 k. the two calibrations give @xmath22 values that systematically differ by @xmath23 k. we carry through the detailed abundance analysis for both sets of temperatures and their associated parameters :  log g , [ fe / h ] , and microturbulence ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "we have used the newest yale isochrones ( yi et al .",
    "2001 ) to determine log g values using an age of 12 gyr , the median of the age values determined by grundahl , stetson & andersen ( 2002 ) , salaris & weiss ( 1998 ) , and hodder et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , for both temperature scales for metallicities of both @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( and an interpolated value of @xmath27 ) .",
    "armed with a set of initial temperatures , consistent theoretical gravities , and a range of overall metallicities , we constructed model atmospheres characterized by these parameters from the grids of kurucz ( 1993 ) .    utilizing an updated ( 2000 ) version of the lte analysis code moog ( sneden 1973 )",
    ", we computed absolute fe abundances from both our and equivalent width measurements for an array of trial microturbulence values .",
    "for these determinations we used only lines with reduced equivalent width values log ( w/@xmath28)@xmath29 ( generally corresponding to equivalent widths @xmath30 m ) .",
    "for a given log g and [ fe / h ] , we determined the combination of @xmath22 and @xmath24 that resulted in the minimal slopes between fe abundance and a ) lower excitation potential , and b ) reduced equivalent width .",
    "we also tested the effect of varying log g on the agreement between fe abundance as derived from and from .",
    "we adopted model parameters that are given in table 3 .",
    "although we have carried out the abundance analysis throughout on both temperatures scales , we have a preference for the `` cooler '' scale .",
    "( this preference does not imply a preference for the calibration used by c83 over k93 because the large reddening for m71 makes the @xmath31 values are uncertain by about @xmath20.03 . ) with the cooler scale : 1 ) there is better agreement with irfm temperatures , 2 ) the slopes for fe i abundance vs excitation potential are closer to zero with our spectroscopic temperatures , and 3 ) the match with the new evolutionary tracks of yi et al .",
    "( 2001 ) seems better as the tracks do not reach the high turn - off temperatures of the hot stars on the hotter scale .",
    "we employed the updated lte moog code to determine abundances from all our species .",
    "moog s abfind routine was used with the measured equivalent widths in table 2 and the appropriate kurucz model atmosphere characterized by parameters in table 3 .",
    "the final abundances for each species are given in tables 4 ( fe ) , 5 ( na and @xmath3 elements ) , and 6 ( fe - peak : ni and cr , and n - capture : y and ba ) and are discussed below in section 4 .",
    "for a few lines of some species of particular interest we had to violate our practice of only using features with log ( w/@xmath28)@xmath32 ( e.g. @xmath286141 ) , but we stay within that limit for all the stellar and solar lines of , , , and . where abundances were determined from lines from two ionization stages for an element , an average was determined by weighting the results by the numbers of lines measured .    also included in those tables are the results for the sun from our lunar spectrum from keck / hires . for these abundances",
    "we used the kurucz solar atmosphere and the lines for each species that appear in the last column of table 2 .",
    "because the metallicity of the sun is considerably higher than that of the m71 stars , we could not use exactly the same set of lines for the solar abundance determinations .",
    "this means that accurate @xmath33 values might play a role in determining accurate normalized abundances [ x / h]an issue which we explore below .",
    "however , there are a large number of well - determined solar equivalent widths in the set we used for the stars",
    ". the solar abundances also appear in tables 4 , 5 , and 6 .",
    "we have used the solar abundances that we determined from the solar / lunar keck spectrum for consistency in the analysis .",
    "our results are in good agreement with the compilation of grevesse & sauval ( 1998 ) , usually within 0.05 dex . however , our ca and ni abundances are 0.18 and 0.20 dex lower than the respective solar photospheric values of grevesse & sauval .    an abundance summary with abundances normalized to fe is given in table 7 .",
    "the @xmath34 values here represent the error in the mean .",
    "the internal uncertainty , @xmath35 , in the mean abundance for each species in the five individual stars and the sun are given in tables 4 , 5 , and 6 , along with the number of lines utilized in determining the mean abundance ; the former come from the line - to - line scatter for each species .",
    "for those species where only 1 or 2 lines were used , @xmath35 could not be determined . in these cases ,",
    "a conservative value had to be estimated for later use . in table 8 ,",
    "internal uncertainties in the mean cluster abundance ratios ( column 3 ) are estimated from the star - to - star scatter of the prenormalized abundances . in column 4",
    "we give the internal uncertainties in the mean abundance ratios that additionally include contributions from the solar values utilized in the abundance normalizations .",
    "we note that , for elements with multiple species , all these listed uncertainties include contributions from each species weighted in the same fashion as the mean abundances .",
    "table 8 also lists the sensitivities of the [ fe / h ] and [ x / fe ] ratios to the changes in parameter values of t@xmath18 , log g , and @xmath24 given above columns 5 - 7 .",
    "typical errors are @xmath250 k in t@xmath18 , @xmath20.15 in log g , and @xmath20.15 in @xmath24 .",
    "sensitivities include correlations of errors in element x and fe .",
    "we note that all sensitivities take into account any differences arising from utilizing different ions for a given element .",
    "sensitivity contributions from different species of a given element were weighted in the same fashion as for the mean abundance determinations , i.e.  by the number of lines used . based upon the photometric errors and our parameter investigations , we believe that reasonably conservative estimates of random 1@xmath34-level parameter uncertainties are @xmath36 k , @xmath37 dex , and @xmath37 km / s in @xmath22 , log @xmath38 , and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "this means that total uncertainties in the mean abundance ratios are @xmath39 dex except for [ mg / fe ] and [ ba / fe ] ; the latter two ratios have total uncertainties of @xmath400.12 - 0.13 dex .",
    "we investigated the effects of our choice of @xmath33 values by redetermining abundances for each species utilizing only those specific lines for which solar abundances abundances were also calculated .",
    "the abundance differences ( `` new '' minus `` old '' ) are given for each star in the fourth row of each species in table 4 for those species which utilized different line samples for stellar and solar abundance determinations .",
    "for example , had we used only those lines which were also measurable in the sun , our -based mean stellar log n(fe ) value would have been 0.060 dex lower .",
    "given the lower weight assigned to the lines in determining [ fe / h ] , however , this difference effects our final results negligibly .",
    "indeed , none of our abundances is significantly affected by line sample ( and , thus , presumably @xmath33 choice ) except na . table 5 indicates that a truly consistent solar normalization of our lines would have raised our final [ na / fe ] ratio by an additional @xmath41 dex .",
    "whether this systematic change yields a more accurate abundance compared to a value derived from additional lines is , of course , unclear .",
    "however , even the difference for this one element is modest .",
    "the abundances for fe for each star are given in table 4 .",
    "for each ion we give the 1@xmath34 uncertainty and the number of lines used .",
    "the final abundance is the combined result obtained by weights equal to the number of spectral lines that were used for the determination .",
    "for fe we have 79 - 86 fe i lines and 8 - 11 fe ii lines for each star that give the final fe / h .",
    "there are no significant star - to - star variations among the five stars so the mean for the five - the cluster mean - is listed in the final column .",
    "also in table 4 are the results for the sun from our lunar spectrum with the equivalent widths given in table 2 .",
    "we used our solar values , obtained with the same spectrograph , to find [ fe / h ] .",
    "our mean m 71 fe abundance is [ fe / h]@xmath42 dex , where the uncertainty includes internal uncertainties plus those in the parameters .",
    "the final column of table 4 indicates that our -based metallicity ( [ fe / h]@xmath43 ) is in excellent accord with the -based value ( [ fe / h]@xmath44 ) within the internal uncertainties alone ( 0.03 and 0.07 dex respectively ) .",
    "for these five turn - off stars we find @xmath45[fe / h]@xmath46 = @xmath90.80 @xmath20.02 , where the uncertainty is just the error in the mean .",
    "this is in excellent agreement with [ fe / h ] = @xmath90.79 @xmath20.01 from ten red giant stars in m71 of sklps .",
    "these comparisons suggest that any intra - cluster dwarf - giant fe discrepancy is small .",
    "this is in contrast to our previous study of the metal - poor globular m92 ( king et al .",
    "1998 ) , where we found fe abundances to be nearly a factor of two smaller in near - turnoff stars than deduced by others in m92 red giants .",
    "one possible explanation may be the action of nlte effects in the near turnoff stars ( king et al .",
    "thvenin & idiart ( 1999 ) have studied nlte effects on lines in metal - poor stars .",
    "examination of their figure 9 suggests that , at the lte - based fe abundance of m92 determined by king et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ( @xmath47 ) , nlte corrections are indeed 0.3 dex . since these corrections drop to @xmath48 dex at our lte - based m71 fe abundance , concordance with previous giant - based determinations is not remarkable . alternatively , as mentioned by king et al .",
    "1998 , it is possible that the m92 dwarf - giant difference is not real or is due to analysis differences .",
    "indeed , kraft & ivans ( 2003 ) suggest that their analysis of and lines in m92 giants indicates the thvenin & idiart ( 1999 ) nlte corrections are too large .",
    "kraft & ivans ( 2003 ) conclude that the metallicity of m92 red giants is in the range @xmath49 to @xmath50 , consistent with the earlier estimate of @xmath47 by peterson , kurucz & carney ( 1990 ) and the king et al .",
    "1998 turnoff results .",
    "the agreement in [ fe / h ] between the turn - off stars and the red giants in m71 is a confirmation that high quality spectra and model atmospheres can provide the same benchmark abundance of fe for this cluster .",
    "we can now examine the difference in other element ratios in giant vs.  turn - off stars to explore whether nuclear processing and mixing have altered the abundances in the giants .",
    "the abundances of the other elements are given in tables 5 and 6 and the mean cluster abundances and parameter sensitivities are given in tables 7 and 8 .",
    "looking at the abundances of the various species in our five m71 stars , there is no firm evidence for genuine star - to - star differences ; in particular , no star stands out has having consistently deviant abundances given the uncertainties .",
    "depending on the species , we infer that any genuine star - to - star differences must be at a level of @xmath51 dex for the particular elements in our sample of stars .",
    "our first comparison is between our m71 stars and field stars of similar metallicity that have been analyzed by stephens & boesgaard ( 2002 ) ( hereafter sb02 ) because we have used the same line list and the same procedure .",

    "compared to the field halo stars , m71 is high in ca ( but would be in the midst of the halo star points at + 0.14 had we used the grevesse & sauval ( 1998 ) solar ca of 6.36 ) . although the field stars appear to be low in ni , which is discussed by sb02 , the m71 point would fall among them at @xmath90.10 with the grevesse & sauval ( 1998 ) solar ni of 6.25 .",
    "the field stars are also apparently low in na ( see below ) .",
    "edvardsson et al .  (",
    "1993 ) ( hereafter eaglnt ) derived abundances of 13 elements in some 189 field f and g dwarf stars in the galactic disk .",
    "several of these stars have [ fe / h ] values similar to that of m71 .",
    "we have separated out those stars with [ fe / h ] within @xmath20.20 dex of @xmath90.80 to compare with our m71 turn - off mean abundances ; there are 17 such disk stars and their abundances are given in table 9 .",
    "figure 5 is a similar plot to figure 4 with the disk stars as filled circles ; eaglnt did not determine [ cr / fe ] so the lower left panel in figure 5 is [ na / fe ] rather than [ cr / fe ] as in figure 4 .",

    "our near - turnoff [ mg / fe ] ratio of @xmath71 is considerably smaller than the value of the rc02 evolved stars ( @xmath72 ) , which itself should be raised ( or ours lowered ) by 0.04 dex to account for the modest fe difference between our studies . while interesting , the meaning of this difference is unclear since the two turn - off stars from rc02 give [ mg / fe]@xmath73 , in accord with their giant results .",

    "if the @xmath10-capture difference noted above is real and resulted from self - enrichment , then we surmise that polluting material arose in a traditional @xmath4-process environment  though perhaps one providing an unusually large neutron fluence .",
    "we reiterate that mapping any variation of light @xmath4-element variation with evolutionary status in m71 is critical to determining whether such pollution happened before cluster formation or via self - enrichment after star formation in the cluster .",

    "first , the similarity of our turn - off na abundances , as well as those of rc02 , with the values observed in m71 giants ( sklps ; rc02 ) indicates that this @xmath5-capture mechanism is not an _ in situ _ process unless there is a glaring fundamental failure in our basic understanding of stellar structure .",
    "the atmospheres of m71 stars must be polluted by material having undergone such processing elsewhere .",
    "second , the lack of clear evidence for intracluster @xmath3-element variations suggests that this processing was not the result of self - enrichment via explosive nucleosynthesis  a process which could , in principle , also affect the heavy elements if the @xmath70-process came into play .",
    "the m71 [ ba / fe ] ratio suggests that material in m71 stars once was present in an @xmath4-process environment of at least modestly higher neutron fluence compared to nearby field stars of similar [ fe / h ] .",
    "it remains unclear whether the @xmath4-process polluting source acted prior to cluster formation or after ( via self - enrichment ) .",
    "if there is a genuine dwarf - giant y and/or zr difference in m71 , then it would suggest that a source of modest neutron fluence self - polluted m71 ( to produce high light @xmath4 abundances perhaps seen near the turnoff ) in addition to a very high neutron fluence source acting prior to cluster formation ( to produce the high heavy - to - light @xmath4 ratios perhaps seen in the giants ) .",
    "consistent determination of light @xmath4-elements ( rb , sr , y , zr ) in a considerably larger sample of m 71 turn - off , subgiant , and giant stars is needed to address this critical issue ; the possibility of intra - cluster mg variations also merits additional study .    finally , we note the recent work on elemental abundances in the globular clusters m4 ( [ fe / h]@xmath76 ) and m5 ( [ fe / h]@xmath77 ) by ivans et al .",
    "( 1999 , 2001 ) .",
    "ivans et al .",
    "( 2001 ) call attention to the differences in these clusters based upon the morphology of the o - na anticorrelation patterns and hb morphology . in particular , they note the similarity in the light element processing patterns between m4 and m71 , as well as the hb morphology .",
    "indeed , it might be hoped that such an association is a meaningful classification perhaps related to the dominance of _ in situ _ processing versus pollution , or perhaps simply related to metallicity since this parameter affects the molecular weight gradient relevant for deep mixing in stellar interiors as well as serving as the `` first parameter '' controlling hb morphology .",
    "the factor of @xmath78 difference in the m4 and m71 [ ba / fe ] ratios , however , reminds us that the detailed chemical evolution histories of globular clusters are individually unique . as is clear from this investigation ,",
    "unraveling these histories will require continued study on a star - by - star and cluster - by - cluster basis involving determination of abundances in near turnoff stars via high - resolution spectroscopy on current and future generations of large aperture telescopes .",
