    "classical novae are cataclysmic binary stars , wherein a white dwarf ( wd ) accretes a hydrogen - rich envelope from its roche - lobe filling companion , or from the wind of a nearby giant .",
    "theory @xcite and detailed simulations @xcite predict that once the pressure at the base of the accreted envelope of the wd exceeds a critical value , a thermonuclear runaway ( tnr ) will occur in the degenerate layer of accreted hydrogen .",
    "the tnr causes the rapid rise of the wd s luminosity to @xmath2 or more , and the high - speed ejection of the accreted envelope @xcite in a classical nova explosion .",
    "recurrent novae ( rne ) are a subclass of cataclysmic binaries , brightening dramatically for a few weeks at intervals of decades @xcite .",
    "comprehensive photometric histories of all ten known galactic rne are detailed in @xcite .",
    "although rn outbursts are powered by tnrs resembling those of classical novae , the latter have eruptions separated by thousands of years instead of decades @xcite .",
    "the rn t pyxidis , surrounded by well - resolved ejecta , is an important test case for studying the eruptions and ejecta of all classical novae . before 2011 ,",
    "t pyx had five recorded outbursts to its credit ( 1890 , 1902 , 1920 , 1944 , 1966 ) , all of which were very similar photometrically @xcite .",
    "its eruptions every few decades have driven successive blast waves out into the ejecta around the rn and , presumably , the interstellar medium beyond .",
    "successive ejection events must result in collisions and interactions between their ejecta .",
    "simulations show that these collisions lead to rayleigh - taylor instabilities that fragment the ejecta , producing the observed , elongated structures @xcite .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that when two ejected nova shells collide , a primary blast wave propagates outward into the older ejecta , while a reflected reverse shock wave propagates back through the new ejecta .",
    "different spectral lines are emitted in the two zones , and combined , the @xcite model accounts well for the observed line spectrum of the t pyx ejecta .",
    "narrowband ground - based h@xmath0 imaging of t  pyx by @xcite and @xcite revealed a shell with diameter @xmath3@xmath4 surrounding the star .",
    "@xcite obtained deeper ground - based ccd images of t  pyx that revealed a faint extended h@xmath0 + [ n  ii ] halo twice as large as the previously detected shell .",
    "subsequently , @xcite obtained _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) images of t  pyx in narrowband h@xmath0 and [ n  ii ] @xmath56584 filters , demonstrating that ( 1 )  the nebula is resolved into more than two thousand individual knots and ( 2 )  the apparent expansion of knots away from the star is much slower than predicted from the radial velocities of ejecta @xcite .    with a 13-year baseline ,",
    "@xcite were able to detect the slow expansion of t pyx s ejecta .",
    "the fractional expansion of the knots is constant , which implies no significant deceleration of the knots .",
    "they deduced that t  pyx must have undergone an ( unobserved ) classical - nova eruption within @xmath6 years of 1866 , followed by six recurrent - nova outbursts .",
    "as t pyx is the prototype of both short orbital - period and short recurrence - time galactic rne , it is important to independently check the @xcite evolutionary scenario .",
    "this is a key goal of the present paper .    a rare opportunity for rn studies - a direct test of key predictions of the @xcite scenario and the @xcite hydrodynamics model - arose with t pyx s most recent eruption , which began at 2011 april 14.29 = jd 2455665.79 @xcite .",
    "exquisite light curves and spectroscopy of the eruption have been presented by @xcite .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have investigated the three - dimensional geometry of the ejecta . @xcite and",
    "@xcite have presented evidence that the ejecta are best represented by a bipolar model , oriented nearly face - on .",
    "the goal of @xcite was to image light scattered by dust ; while the resulting images were of low s /",
    "n , they demonstrated that t pyx s dust is concentrated in a clumpy ring about @xmath7 in radius - - tilted 30 - 40@xmath8 with respect to the plane of the sky - - with the eastern edge tilted toward the observer .",
    "the delay times between the direct optical light from the central source and the scattering of this light from dust in several clumps with the same foreground distance as the central source yielded a distance to t pyx of @xmath9 kpc . a completely independent distance estimate , based on the high radial velocity component of the mg ii doublet and the galactic rotation curve in the direction of t pyx , yielded an estimate of 5 kpc @xcite .",
    "@xcite measured the period change across t pyx s 2011 eruption , using it to deduce that more than @xmath10 was ejected in that event .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached by @xcite on the basis of the high peak flux densities of t pyx s radio emission , and by @xcite on the basis of the late appearance of supersoft x - rays .",
    "this much ejected mass is usually associated with a classical , rather than a recurrent nova .",
    "t pyx is the only rn with clearly visible ejecta , and hence the only nova likely to illuminate its circumstellar ejecta , during the lifetime of _",
    "we therefore requested director s discretionary time on _ hst _ with its wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) to image the t pyx ejecta through the f656n narrowband h@xmath0 filter .",
    "our expectation was that , as the wave of intense nova illumination swept out into the nebula , hydrogen surrounding the nova would be photoionized and then recombine , brightening dramatically .",
    "the key questions we hoped to address with our observations were :    ( 1 )  is there ( unexpected ) matter outside the boundaries of the ejecta of the claimed 1866 classical nova eruption ?",
    "the presence of significant amounts of such matter , illuminated by the nova flash , would cast significant doubt on the claim that an eruption within 5 years of 1866 was the first in many millennia : the basis of the evolutionary model of t pyx @xcite . in particular , if t pyx has been erupting for thousands of years , instead of just since 1866 , there must be ejected material extending far beyond the boundaries of the knots imaged in @xcite .",
    "( 2 )  can we derive densities , and measure masses of t pyx ejecta _ not in _ the prominent knots discovered by @xcite , from the lengths of time required for any observed flash - ionized material to fade ?",
    "the extremely large measured masses of the 2011 eruption suggest that our previous determinations of ejecta mass , based on low density material emitting forbidden lines of [ ] , may be a significant underestimate .    in section 2",
    "we describe our observations .",
    "we show narrowband h@xmath0 imagery of the material surrounding t pyx in section 3 .",
    "we use these images to test the @xcite scenario , and to demonstrate the presence of much previously invisible ejecta , surrounding t pyx , in section 4 .",
    "we briefly summarize our results in section 5 .",
    "at a given time after the outburst , the illuminated material in the nebula surrounding t pyx lies on a paraboloidal surface , the surface of constant light travel - time delay .",
    "this is strictly true for light scattered off dust .",
    "an emission - line nebular knot , once ionized , will continue to radiate until it has recombined .",
    "thus we only know that it is located between the parabola for which it was first detected and the next closer parabola at which it was not detected .",
    "this means that , for the highest - resolution 3d localization , the observations should be closely spaced in time .",
    "the unique relation between time delay and the 3d position of an illuminated knot in the nebula is illustrated in figure 1 , which assumes a distance to t pyx of 4.8 kpc @xcite .",
    "this figure shows how the paraboloids open up very quickly immediately after the outburst .",
    "it was thus essential to start the observations quickly in order to sample as much of the volume in front of the star as possible .",
    "later observations were more widely spaced in time .",
    "@xmath11 , and whose fainter portions extend out to @xmath3@xmath4 . thus the illumination was expected to sweep through most of the brighter portions by about day 282 , and should have swept through the entire nebula shortly after day 383 ( modulo the actual distance to t  pyx ; longer times for larger distances.),width=576 ]      following its eruption on 2011 april 14.29 , seven separate epochs of h@xmath0 narrowband imagery of the recurrent nova t pyx were obtained with the _ hst _ wfc3 @xcite for observing program go-12446 ( pi m. shara ) .",
    "the camera provides a plate scale of @xmath12 per pixel and a total field - of - view of @xmath13 x @xmath13 .",
    "we used a 1k x 1k subarray of the camera to reduce readout time .",
    "twelve h@xmath0 images , each of 160 seconds duration , provided an effective exposure time of 1920 seconds at each epoch .",
    "images were dithered during each epoch to allow for cosmic ray removal .",
    "the requested timings of the _ hst _ images were chosen based on the geometry of the expected ionization echoes and observational constraints on _ hst _ ( cf figure 1 ) . we were aware that t pyx near maximum light would saturate the ccd detector close to the central source , but nonetheless requested that the first h@xmath0 observation be made 4 days ( 2011 april 18 ) after the outburst began .",
    "this filter - calibration image ( figure 2 ) was intended to help us define the imaging characteristics ( especially the scattered light or",
    " ghosts \" ) within the f656n _ hst _ narrowband filter .",
    "subsequently , images were obtained on 2011 april 30 , 2011 july 08 , 2011 september 05 , 2011 november 15 , 2012 february 22 and 2012 may 01 , corresponding to 16 , 55 , 132 , 183 , 282 and 383 days , respectively , after the beginning of the eruption on 2011 april 14 .",
    "each of these six dates corresponds to an increasingly larger paraboloid in figure 1 .",
    "t pyx was at visual magnitudes of about 7.5 , 7.0 , 8.8 , 11.0 , 11.8 , 13.3 and 13.7 at the seven observation epochs noted above .",
    "the full light curve of t pyx s 2011 eruption , with over 100,000 data points , is available on the american association of variable star observers website .",
    "we used the multidrizzle software package within pyraf to combine the dithered images from each epoch .",
    "our science demanded the best - possible detections of the low surface brightness nebulosities surrounding t pyx .",
    "thus it was critical that the image subtractions we performed matched and removed the bright central pixels centered on t pyx , as well as imaging artifacts ( reflections , ghosts and diffraction spikes ) .",
    "each of the seven epochs images was taken with _ hst _ at a different roll angle , a natural consequence of maintaining _ hst _",
    "s solar panels normal to the sun .",
    "this turned out to be beneficial because the diffraction spikes and artifacts locations remain fixed with respect to the ccd but rotate from epoch to epoch with respect to the sky .",
    "if each epoch s image is rotated to match the alignment of all the other epochs images on the sky , the artifacts and diffraction spikes no longer align with respect to each other ( while stars or nebulosity do align ) .",
    "it is essential to eliminate the diffraction spikes to detect low surface brightness nebulosities near t pyx .",
    "we used epoch 1 ( figure 2 ) as a  master calibration frame \" because no nebulosity is yet visible , while there was a strong signal in the diffraction spikes and other artifacts .",
    "as a first approximation we scaled stars near t pyx in epoch 1 to the fluxes of the same stars in each later epoch for image differencing .    the first five epochs were then processed as follows .",
    "we manually shifted epoch 1 ( 2011 april 18 ) in a grid of 2 by 2 pixels , in 0.1 pixel steps , with respect to the next four epochs images .",
    "we scaled the image of epoch 1 to match the flux of each of the next four epochs , and subtracted each of those epochs from epoch 1 .",
    "the resulting difference image with the smallest residual artifacts was then used as the center of a refined 0.3 by 0.3 pixel grid with 0.01 pixel steps to find the match that again minimized artifacts .",
    "the final shift we used was the one which left the smallest residuals for the diffraction spikes in each of the the difference images .",
    "this subtracted out the other artifacts very well , but not perfectly .",
    "the small residuals that ca nt be removed are due to small optical pathlength variations , a result of the telescope s temperature variations when entering and exiting the shadow of the earth , and jiitter , due to vibrations in _",
    "hst s _ solar panels .",
    "the flux in epochs 6 and 7 was so much lower than in the previous five epochs that the above procedure only added noise to these last two images .",
    "we therefore compared epochs 6 and 7 with each other .",
    "we repeated the process above but , instead of epoch 1 , we used epoch 7 and shifted it in the drizzling process and scaled it to epoch 6 .",
    "we checked that no constant features in epochs 6 and 7 cancelled each other out by performing the same subtraction after shifting the images with respect to each other ( similar to  unsharp masking \" @xcite except that neither image was blurred ) .",
    "except for two knots located 4 arc sec west of t pyx , and noted below , no such features were detected .",
    "the dithered h@xmath0 images of t pyx at each of the six epochs after 2011 april 18 are shown as a mosaic in figure 3 .",
    "not surprisingly , the glare of t pyx and the ghosting in the h@xmath0 filter dominate the images of 2011 april 30 and 2011 july 08 ; no unambiguous indication of nebulosity is seen .",
    "eleven weeks later , on 2011 september 25 , there _ is _ nebular matter clearly detected both north and south of t pyx . this emission was extinguished , and was replaced by emission nebulosity to the northwest and southwest of the star just 51 days later , on 2011 november 15 .",
    "ninety - nine days later ( 2012 february 22 ) almost all traces of nebulosity were gone , and no new nebulosity appeared either then , or 101 days later ( on 2012 may 01 ) .",
    "the psf - subtracted images used to remove much of the glare of t pyx , and the f656n filter ghosting and diffraction spikes , are shown in figures 4 , 5 , and 6 .",
    "the nebulosities of 2011 september 25 ( north and south of t pyx ) and 2011",
    "november 15 ( northwest and southwest of t pyx ) are much more apparent , as is the nearly complete lack of nebular emission on 2012 february 22 and 2012 may 10 .    to locate subtle edges and condensations we created unsharp mask images from our data by shifting and subtracting images from themselves.the f656n unsharp mask images ( figures",
    "7 and 8) emphasize that much ( though not all ) of the newly detected , fluorescing hydrogen is diffuse , rather than being concentrated in knots .",
    "the comparison of the most recent epoch of [ ] f658n images ( from 2007 ) with the 2011 h@xmath0 f656n images , shown in figures 9 and 10 , further emphasizes this difference in spatial distribution of the t pyx ejecta .",
    "the key science question motivating our _ hst _ observations of t pyx is the presence or absence of previously undetected ejecta .",
    "figures 4 , 5 , and 6 make it clear that we have discovered substantial amounts of previously invisible , cold hydrogen ejecta , briefly illuminated and photoionized by the eruption of t pyx .",
    "features in the psf - subtracted images on 2011 april 30 and 2011 july 08 to the north , east and southeast are artifacts - internal reflections - produced by the h@xmath0 filter . however , on 2011 september 25 , there was a dramatic brightening in h@xmath0 emission to the north and south of t pyx .",
    "figure 7 demonstrates that the h@xmath0 emission is much more diffuse and less clumpy than the [ ] emission seen in the same region in 2007 . just as significant",
    ", there is no trace of h@xmath0 emission outside of the region of [ ] emission @xcite .",
    "fifty one days later , on 2011 november 15 , the photoionized h@xmath0 emission to the north and south of t pyx was gone . in its place",
    "there was extensive h@xmath0 emission to the northwest , west and southwest of t pyx .",
    "this h@xmath0 emission overlaps regions of [ ] emission seen in 1997 and 2007 .",
    "there was , again , no trace of h@xmath0 emission outside the regions of [ ] seen in 1997 and 2007 .",
    "the locations of these transient h@xmath0 detections overlap the dusty patches detected ( with low s / n ) in the continuum images of @xcite .",
    "they are consistent with the conclusions of @xcite that t pyx s ejecta are concentrated in a ring about @xmath7 in radius , tilted 30 - 40 degrees with respect to the plane of the sky , with the eastern edge tilted toward the observer , at a distance of @xmath14 kpc .",
    "even more remarkable are the h@xmath0 images of 2012 february 22 and 2012 may 01 .",
    "almost all of the h@xmath0 emission that was so prominently visible on 2011 november 15 has been extinguished .",
    "the only exceptions are two unresolved knots located @xmath15 west of t pyx on 22 feb 2012 , which are still seen on 01 may 2012 .",
    "_ no new h@xmath0 emission appeared outside the regions of [ ] emission _",
    ", even though sufficient time has elapsed for the burst of nova light to photoionize hydrogen twice as far away from t pyx as was detected in 2011",
    "september and november , if it were present in the ring - like geometry suggested by @xcite .",
    "to put limits on the surface brightness of h@xmath0 emission outside the [ ] -dominated ejecta , we have constructed , in figure 10 , a montage of four images ( labeled a , b , c and d ) , with successively fainter artificial nebulosities .",
    "the region outlined with a red rectangle in the figure labeled a encloses the nebula which , appropriately scaled , we transplanted to the region indicated by the blue ellipse .",
    "the centroid of the blue ellipse is ( arbitrarily ) twice as far as the centroid of the red rectangle from t pyx .",
    "the precise position of the blue ellipse is unimportant , as the background surface brightness is constant outside the limits of the t pyx nebulosity . in image",
    "a , the flux in the red rectangle is simply added to the pixels in an identically - sized rectangular region inside the blue ellipse .",
    "this addition has the effect of increasing the noise , which is why the rectangular shape of the synthetic nebulosity can be discerned . in figure",
    "b we reduced the flux from the red rectangle region by a factor of two and again added the synthetic nebulosity to the pixels in the blue ellipse . in figures c and d",
    "we repeated this procedure , after reducing the flux by factors of 4 and 8 , respectively .",
    "reductions by factors of 2 and 4 ( images c and d ) made the synthetic nebulosity fainter , but it remained detectable . in image d",
    "it is clear that the background noise dominates the signal , and the synthetic nebulosity with 1/8 the surface brightness of the original is just at the limits of detectability .",
    "we conclude that there _ is _ a large reservoir of previously undetected , cold hydrogen mixed in with the extensive filamentary [ ] structures first identified in @xcite .",
    "however , no extended reservoir of cold hydrogen , comparable in mass to that which we have now discovered , exists out to roughly twice the distance from t pyx ( near the plane of the sky ) in which [ ] knots and the newly detected h@xmath0 emission are seen .",
    "the lack of such extended hydrogen is strong evidence against the hypothesis that t pyx has been ejecting matter as a rn for many centuries or millennia .",
    "we were previously able to put a hard lower limit on the ejecta mass of t pyx of 1.6 x @xmath16 via the [ ] flux , the upper limit on the knots electron density to allow the forbidden [ ] lines , and the number and size of emitting knots @xcite .",
    "correcting for the larger distance ( 4.8 kpc ) that is now deduced for t pyx ( sec .",
    "1 ) , the lower limit on the mass in [ ] -emitting knots is 1.6 x @xmath17 , consistent with the mass expected from a classical nova eruption .",
    "@xcite demonstrated via simulations that this is still an underestimate , by a factor of roughly 4.4 , because knots are turning on and off as successive generations of ejecta collide with each other and then recombine .",
    "the ejecta mass seen in [ ] is thus about 7 x @xmath17 .",
    "the rapid disappearance of the h@xmath0 emission to the north and south of t pyx that we see in the 51 days between 2011",
    "september 25 and 2011 november 15 allows us , for the first time , to put a lower limit on the density of hydrogen photoionized by the t pyx eruption .",
    "the e - folding time @xmath18 over which electrons recombine in ionized hydrogen is @xmath19/@xmath20 yr , where @xmath20 is the number density of free electrons @xcite .",
    "@xcite note that over a time @xmath18 in recombining hydrogen , @xmath20 falls by a factor of 2.7 , the total flux from a region of gas falls by a factor of 7.4 , corresponding to 2.2 mag .",
    "this is what we measure for the fading of the hydrogen to the north and south of t pyx to within @xmath21 20% .",
    "thus that hydrogen must possess a density of at least 7 x @xmath19 @xmath22 .",
    "this lower limit is an order of magnitude larger than the largest density of nitrogen that is consistent with the strong [ ] lines in the knots of t pyx .",
    "the similar , total disappearance of emitting hydrogen northwest and southwest of t pyx between 2011",
    "november 15 and 2012 february 22 ( a 101 day interval , from 282 to 383 days after eruption ) allows us to place a lower limit of @xmath23 @xmath24 on that material .",
    "a space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) spectrum of the emitting material between @xmath15 and @xmath25 northwest of t pyx was obtained by @xcite on 2011 december 5 ( see their figure 2 ) .",
    "two emission lines are clearly evident : h@xmath0 and [ ] @xmath55007 , with comparable equivalent widths .",
    "the presence of strong [ ] @xmath55007 emission puts an upper limit on the density of 7 x @xmath19 @xmath26 to avoid collisional de - excitation @xcite .",
    "this is similar to the lower limit obtained in the previous paragraph .",
    "it is tempting to suggest that this density , higher by almost an order of magnitude than that which can exist in the [ ] knots , in a surface area similar to that occupied by the knots , represents roughly 10 times more mass than has previously been deduced to exist in t pyx s ejecta , viz .",
    "7 x @xmath27 in total .",
    "the dynamical , radio and x - ray estimates of the mass ejected in the latest outburst ( @xmath10 or larger ) are certainly consistent with our total mass estimate of 7 x @xmath27 .",
    "consistency is maintained if all six observed eruptions ( and the deduced 1866 eruption ) ejected @xmath10 .",
    "this quantity of ejected mass is usually associated with a classical , rather than a recurrent nova .",
    "it is no longer clear that the last six eruptions are different from the first eruption of 1866 .",
    "@xcite predicted that the bright knots seen in [ ] would be connected by a filamentary network of fainter material as a consequence of the growth of rayleigh - taylor instabilities in the colliding ejecta shells .",
    "the flash ionized material reported in this paper has morphology and spatial distribution consistent with their prediction .",
    "however , the input parameters for the ejected mass in the simulations by @xcite were based what was then known about t pyx s distance and the [ ] images . that yielded shell densities two orders of magnitude below the densities derived here , suggesting that further modeling will be needed to make a useful quantitative comparison .",
    "nevertheless , the agreement in morphology lends support to the above suggestion that the ejecta are higher in mass , by an order of magnitude , than previously deduced .",
    "seven epochs of _ hst _ wfc3 f656n narrowband h@xmath0 images of the rn t pyx were obtained during the year following its 2011 eruption .",
    "significant ionization and fluorescence of hydrogen ejecta was seen 132 days and 183 days after outburst , but not earlier or later .",
    "the rapid recombination of the photoionized hydrogen and presence of [ ] @xmath55007 demonstrates densities , and thus probably ejecta masses , an order of magnitude larger than previous estimates .",
    "the morphology of the flash - ionized hydrogen is similar to that predicted by the hydrodynamic models of @xcite , viz . a filamentary network of fainter material connecting the bright [ ] knots , produced by the growth of rayleigh - taylor instabilities in colliding ejecta shells .",
    "the lack of detections of hydrogen later than 183 days after eruption rules out ejecta of similar density and mass to about twice the distance of any currently known material .",
    "the absence of more distant ejecta supports the scenario wherein t pyx has been erupting only in the past 150 years , after many millennia of quiescence .",
