    "<S> we report an angular resolved photoemission study of na@xmath0coo@xmath1 with x@xmath20.73 where it is found that the renormalization of the quasiparticle dispersion changes dramatically upon a rotation from @xmath3 m to @xmath3k . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison of the experimental data to the calculated band structure reveals that the quasiparticle renormalization is most pronounced along the @xmath3k - direction , while it is significantly weaker along the @xmath3m - direction . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the observed anisotropy in terms of multiorbital effects and point out the relevance of magnetic correlations for the band structure of na@xmath0coo@xmath1 with @xmath4 .    </S>",
    "<S> the unconventional behavior of correlated electrons in materials comprised of square lattices has attracted a vast amount of attention @xcite . however , besides strong electronic correlations , the topology of the underlying lattice structure itself constitutes another important ingredient that can produce exotic electronic ground states .    </S>",
    "<S> the coo@xmath5-layers in the na@xmath0coo@xmath1 materials , which are built up from edge - sharing coo@xmath6 octahedra , constitute a realization of a correlated electron system based on a triangular lattice . </S>",
    "<S> more specifically , these compounds possess a layered hexagonal structure , where strongly covalent coo@xmath5- and ionic na - layers ( @xmath7-planes ) alternate along the perpendicular @xmath8-axis @xcite . upon changing the na content @xmath9 </S>",
    "<S> , these materials can be doped with electrons and , in addition , water molecules can be intercalated . </S>",
    "<S> both changing @xmath9 and water intercalation drastically alter the electronic properties of na@xmath0coo@xmath1 , leading most notably to the emergence of superconductivity upon hydration @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we will focus on the non - hydrated compounds with @xmath10 , where an anomalous metallic state with an extremely large and field dependent thermoelectric power as well as a giant field dependent scattering rate was observed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there is also evidence for the seemingly paradoxical coexistence of electron itinerancy and localized magnetic moments , as well as for unusual charge order cdw phenomena in these macroscopically metallic compounds @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the unconventional electronic properties described above strongly motivate the study of the electronic structure of na@xmath0coo@xmath1 by means of angular resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) , which provides direct and unique experimental access to single - particle excitations and , thus , to the many - body effects in these materials . </S>",
    "<S> previous arpes studies on na@xmath0coo@xmath1 @xcite showed pronounced deviations from the electronic structure predicted by lda calculations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , a strongly renormalized heavy qp band , displaying a kink feature was reported @xcite .    in this arpes study </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the momentum ( @xmath11 ) dependent renormalization effects in na@xmath12coo@xmath1 , which is essential to unravel the relevant couplings that govern the low energy physics . </S>",
    "<S> arpes experiments were carried out using a lab - based system equipped with a scienta ses 200 analyser and a gammadata he discharge lamp at an excitation energy @xmath13ev ( energy resolution 30mev , angular resolution 0.3@xmath14 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the high - quality na@xmath12coo@xmath1 single crystals examined in this study were grown by the sodium chloride flux methods as described in ref.@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a typical fermi level ( @xmath15 ) crossing observed at t=25k is shown in fig.1 , where the image on the left hand side shows the photoelectron intensity as a function of momentum @xmath11 and binding energy @xmath16 . a single and well defined qp band , which crosses the fermi energy at @xmath17ev can be observed . on the right hand side of fig.1 an energy distribution curve ( edc ) and a momentum distribution curve ( mdc ) are shown . by mapping the @xmath15 crossings over a large area of @xmath11-space , </S>",
    "<S> a cut through the fermi surface ( fs ) of na@xmath12coo@xmath1 parallel to the coo@xmath5 planes was measured . </S>",
    "<S> the data allows for a precise calibration of the @xmath11-scale , because dispersions from the first into the second brillouin zone were captured . in figs.2(a),(b ) the @xmath11-dependent photoelectron intensity for two fixed binding energies of @xmath17ev and 0.132ev are shown . </S>",
    "<S> focussing on the cut at @xmath17ev in fig.2(a ) , a large hole - pocket centered around the brillouin zone center @xmath3 is observed . </S>",
    "<S> the fs displays a clear hexagonal topology . </S>",
    "<S> the intensity variations along the fs , leading to a seemingly lower symmetry , are caused by matrix element effects . </S>",
    "<S> the size of the observed fs agrees well with the doping level , provided that only one of the two @xmath18-bands ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> fig.2(c ) ) crosses @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> this agrees with the data shown in fig.1 , where a single qp - band crosses @xmath15 .    in accordance with previous studies , </S>",
    "<S> the hole - pockets along @xmath3k are not observed for @xmath17ev . </S>",
    "<S> it can be seen in fig.2(b ) that the corresponding @xmath19-band ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> fig.2(c ) ) lies well below @xmath15 , as reported earlier @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this can also be observed in fig.2(c ) , where the measured band structure along @xmath3k and @xmath3 m is compared to the band structure obtained by lda @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there is a fair agreement of the arpes data and lda at higher binding energies above 1.5ev . </S>",
    "<S> however , close to @xmath15 deviations occur which are particularly pronounced along @xmath3k .    in fig.3 two cuts of the data </S>",
    "<S> set shown in fig.2 along the @xmath3k- ( left ) and @xmath3m - direction ( right ) are shown . </S>",
    "<S> focussing on the cut along @xmath3k , two prominent features can be observed . </S>",
    "<S> first , there is a band crossing @xmath15 that forms the fs . </S>",
    "<S> second , there is another band at higher binding energies , which can be identified as the @xmath19-band . </S>",
    "<S> the data indicates that the top of the @xmath19-band is at about 85mev .    by tracking the maximum of the mdcs for different @xmath16 </S>",
    "<S> , the qp - dispersion ( @xmath20 ) indicated by black symbols is obtained . </S>",
    "<S> close to @xmath15 the dispersion can be well described by a linear behavior , yielding the fermi velocity @xmath21ev along @xmath3k . however , at slightly higher @xmath16 , the measured dispersion is bent and thus deviates from the linear behavior close to @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> we define the energy where this deviation becomes significant as @xmath22 , resulting in @xmath23mev for the @xmath3k - direction . </S>",
    "<S> the second bend in the dispersion around 80mev is related to the crossing of the two bands @xcite . applying the same analysis to the cut along </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 m leads to @xmath24ev and @xmath25mev . clearly , both @xmath26 and @xmath22 depend on the direction in @xmath11-space .    </S>",
    "<S> the observed bending of the dispersion that sets in around @xmath22 could be due to a coupling of the qp to bosonic excitations . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , consistent with this interpretation , we observe an enhanced increase of the scattering rate around @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> it has to be noted , however , that the feature in the dispersion observed here is not as well defined as the kink in the cuprates , for example . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the values of @xmath22 can not be identified straightforwardly with a specific mode energy and , moreover , a coupling to several different bosonic excitations is possible .    in the following </S>",
    "<S> we will focus on @xmath26 , which is a well defined quantity : cuts for different @xmath27-values ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> fig.1(b ) ) were systematically analyzed in the same way as described above . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained variation of @xmath26 as determined from the arpes data is shown in fig.4(a ) . upon rotating the direction of the cut from @xmath3 m to @xmath3k </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath26 decreases by about a factor of 2 . using the function @xmath28 that was determined from the data in fig.2(a ) together with the obtained values of @xmath26 , the variation of the effective mass @xmath29 with @xmath27 can be calculated . </S>",
    "<S> the result is given in fig.4(c ) . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , the qp along the @xmath3k direction is about twice as heavy as the qp along @xmath3 m . </S>",
    "<S> this pronounced anisotropy of @xmath29 is expected to have a strong impact on the in - plane electronic properties of na@xmath12coo@xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> to determine the renormalization effects in na@xmath12coo@xmath1 , we use the lda band structure as a reference and compare the arpes fermi velocities ( @xmath30 ) to the corresponding lda values ( @xmath31 ) . as it can be observed in figs.4(a),(b ) , these two quantities show exactly the opposite behavior : @xmath30 decreases and @xmath31 increases upon rotation from @xmath3 m to @xmath3k . in order to check whether the deviation between arpes and lda is related to a lattice distortion at the surface , lda calculations were performed for structures where the distance between the oxygen and the cobalt layers , i.e. the co  o  co bond angle , was changed . in agreement with previous calculations , we observe that the top of the @xmath19 band is shifted to higher binding energies upon increasing the co  o  co bond angle . at the same time </S>",
    "<S> the anisotropy of @xmath32 is slightly reduced , but unchanged qualitatively . </S>",
    "<S> this strongly suggests that the measured anisotropy of @xmath30 is not caused by a lattice distortion at the surface .    </S>",
    "<S> the comparison of lda and arpes therefore shows that the deviation of the lda bandstructure from the measured qp - dispersion increases dramatically close to the @xmath3k - direction ( cf . inset of fig.3 ) . in the following </S>",
    "<S> we will refer to this deviation as qp - renormalization ( qpr ) . </S>",
    "<S> this qpr can be characterized using a constant @xmath33 defined by @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath27- or , in other words , k - dependence of @xmath33 is shown in fig.4(d ) , revealing the strong anisotropy of the qpr in na@xmath12coo@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we note that , although the photoelectron intensity in fig.2(a ) at @xmath35 is also influenced by matrix element effects , it is always significantly lower in the @xmath3k- than in the @xmath3m - direction , in agreement with enhanced renormalization effects along @xmath3k .    </S>",
    "<S> we find @xmath36 along @xmath3k in the whole energy range up to @xmath37mev ( inset of fig.3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> at the same time it is remarkable that the qpr gets stronger the closer the so - called @xmath19-band gets to the fermi level ( c.f . </S>",
    "<S> fig.2(b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> this points to an effect related to coupling between the @xmath18- and the @xmath19-bands . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , a strong interaction between these bands is manifested by a large hybridization gap at higher binding energies and the polarization dependence along @xmath3k found in a recent arpes study @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the @xmath11-dependent qpr at @xmath15 is most likely caused by multiorbital effects , i.e. interactions between the states of @xmath19 and @xmath18 symmetry . in this case , the qp - states along @xmath3 m and @xmath3k display different properties : along @xmath3 m the qp - states have largely @xmath18 symmetry , while they display pronounced multiorbital properties along @xmath3k . </S>",
    "<S> this is of crucial importance for the many - body effects in these materials , since the coupling of the qp to bosonic excitations depends critically on the symmetry of the qp - states @xcite . to conclude so far , the observed </S>",
    "<S> anisotropies clearly indicate that multiorbital effects play an important role for the qp - dynamics at @xmath15 .    </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , our dft studies details will be provided in a forthcoming publication show that magnetic correlations play an important role for the qp - dynamics as well : according to non - magnetic lda calculations the band structure of na@xmath38coo@xmath1 displays a strong 3d character . in agreement with a previous dft study @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain a sizeable @xmath39-dispersion parallel to the @xmath8-axis that leads to additional caps of the fs as shown in figs.5(a),(b ) . </S>",
    "<S> such a strong 3d character is not in agreement with arpes data : ( i ) in general , the qp peaks at @xmath15 are expected to be considerably broadened in a 3d system , in particular because the short life time of the final states becomes important @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is not the case ( fig.1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) arpes measurements at various excitation energies do not show any evidence for a strong dispersion along @xmath8 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> however , magnetic lsda calculations yield an afm ground state , where ferromagnetic @xmath7-planes are coupled antiferromagnetically along @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> this agrees well with neutron data @xcite . in the afm state , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath39-dispersion is strongly reduced , which removes the aforementioned fs - caps and yields the fs shown in fig.5(c ) . in other words , according to lsda , 3d afm correlations render the electronic structure of na@xmath38coo@xmath1 effectively 2d . </S>",
    "<S> the top of the @xmath19-band at @xmath40mev as well as the topology and size of the fs obtained in lsda are in good agreement with the arpes data as demonstrated in 5(d ) . </S>",
    "<S> the above results together with the neutron data indicate that afm correlations have a strong influence on the electronic structure of na@xmath0coo@xmath1 with @xmath4 .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that the qpr in na@xmath12coo@xmath1 is strongly anisotropic and provided clear evidence for the relevance of multiorbital effects for the qp dynamics in this material . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , detailed dft studies highlight the impact of magnetic correlations on the qp - states near @xmath15 , which is expected to be directly related to the unusual temperature as well as the field dependencies of the thermopower and the qp scattering rates @xcite . hence , </S>",
    "<S> both the interactions between the @xmath18 and @xmath19 states as well as magnetic correlations have to be taken into account in order to obtain a realistic description of these materials .    </S>",
