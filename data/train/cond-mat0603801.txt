    "arches are multi - particle structures encountered in non - sequentially deposited granular beds . in some sense ,",
    "arches are to granular packings what clusters are to colloids : they represent collective structures whose existence and behavior determine many properties of the system as a whole . during the settlement of a granular bed ,",
    "some particles come to rest simultaneously by contacting and supporting each other",
    ". these mutually stabilized sets of particles are called arches or bridges @xcite .",
    "of course , these arches are themselves supported by some of the surrounding particles in the system : the arch bases .",
    "typically , 70% of the particles are part of arches in a granular packing of hard spheres @xcite ; and around 60% in packings of hard disks @xcite .",
    "arch formation is crucial in the jamming of granular flows driven by gravity to1,to2,zuriguel1,zuriguel2 and it has also been proposed as a mechanism for size segregation @xcite .    arching is the collective process associated to the appearance of voids that lower the packing fraction of the sample .",
    "moreover , arching is directly related to the reduction of particle  particle contacts in the assembly , which determines the coordination number @xcite . in 2d , for example , the mean support number @xmath0i.e .",
    ", the coordination number that accounts only for the contacts that serve as support of at least one grain  can be obtained from the arch size distribution @xmath1 as @xcite    @xmath2 .",
    "\\label{eq1}\\ ] ]    here @xmath3 is the total number of particles in the packing and @xmath1 is the number of arches consisting of @xmath4 grains .",
    "the number of particles that do not form part of any arch corresponds to @xmath5 .",
    "this mean support number coincides with the mean coordination number @xmath6 when the packing does not have any non - supporting contacts . in",
    "non - sequentially deposited beds  especially for soft particles  there will be contacts that are not essential to the stability of any of the two touching particles .",
    "a systematic study of arching is particularly complex despite the simplicity associated to the concept of arch .",
    "the typical structural properties of granular materials are mainly connected with the topological complexity of the contact network .",
    "concepts like force chain  and force propagation  have been profusely studied @xcite , but many open questions still remain .",
    "the statistical properties of the arching process could give some insight into these complex problems .",
    "arches form dynamically during non - sequential particle deposition . given a settled granular sample , identifying",
    "if two particles belong to the same arch is often impossible without knowing the history of the deposition process . assuming that we are able to identify ( experimentally ) the contacts of each particle , it is impossible to know which of these contacts are responsible for supporting each particle in place against gravity",
    ". for convex hard particles in 2d , only two of the contacts of a given particle provide its stability ( in 3d this number is three ) .",
    "the supporting contacts are the first two ( three in 3d ) contacts made by the given particle that provide stability against the external force that drives deposition ( e.g. gravity ) .",
    "any contact made afterwards will not provide the essential stability assuming that the already formed supporting contacts persist .",
    "of course , if one removes a supporting contact , it is possible that a non - supporting contact of the particle becomes a supporting contact , hence some non - supporting contacts may provide secondary ( alternative ) stability to the particle .    finding the supporting contacts of a particle is simple in a pseudo dynamics simulation approach since these contacts are the essence of the simulation algorithm @xcite .",
    "however , in a realistic granular simulation as well as in experiments one needs to track the particle collisions and analyze stability at every instant to catch the supporting contacts of every particle in the moment they first appear .    in this work , we report a numerical study on the supporting contacts that are created during the non - sequential deposition of a granular bed .",
    "then , arches are straightforwardly obtained and analyzed .",
    "we use molecular dynamics simulations and restrict ourselves to a 2d system of inelastic particles in order to reduce the computational cost .",
    "we show that our identification of supporting contacts is useful in deciding when the packing has settled , which is a major issue in these type of simulations .",
    "we compare our results with those obtained by pseudo dynamics methods .",
    "we also show that using simple criteria it is possible to identify arches to some degree without knowing the deposition history .",
    "this is of particular interest for experimental studies where tracking particles at high velocities is rather expensive .",
    "we simulate the process of filling a box with grains by using a soft - particle two - dimensional molecular dynamics ( md ) . in this case , the particles ( monosized disk ) are subjected to the action of gravity . particle ",
    "particle interactions are controlled by the particle ",
    "particle overlap @xmath7 and the velocities @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "here , @xmath11 represents the center - to - center vector between particles @xmath12 and @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the particle diameter and @xmath15 is the particle angular velocity .",
    "these forces are introduced in the newton s translational and rotational equations of motion and then numerically integrated by standard methods schafer1 .",
    "the contact interactions involve a normal force @xmath16 and a tangential force @xmath17 . in order to simplify the calculus we use a normal force which involves a linear ( hookean ) interaction between particles .",
    "@xmath18    @xmath19    where    @xmath20    @xmath21    @xmath22    the first term in eq .",
    "( [ normal ] ) corresponds to a restoring force proportional to the superposition @xmath23 of the interacting disks and the stiffness constant @xmath24 .",
    "the second term accounts for the dissipation of energy during the contact and is proportional to the normal component @xmath25 of the relative velocity @xmath26 of the disks .",
    "the restitution coefficient is an exponentially decaying function of the dissipation coefficient @xmath27 @xcite , i.e. , an increase in the dissipation coefficient leads to a nonlinear decline of the restitution coefficient .    equation  ( [ tangent ] ) provides the magnitude of the force in the tangential direction .",
    "it implements the coulomb s criterion with an effective friction following a rule that selects between static or dynamic friction .",
    "dynamic friction is accounted for by the friction coefficient @xmath28 .",
    "the static friction force @xmath29 [ see eq .",
    "( [ contact ] ) ] has an elastic term proportional to the relative shear displacement @xmath30 and a dissipative term proportional to the tangential component @xmath31 of the relative velocity . in eq .",
    "( [ vtan ] ) , @xmath32 is a unit vector normal to @xmath33 .",
    "the elastic and dissipative contributions are characterized by @xmath34 and @xmath35 respectively .",
    "the shear displacement @xmath30 is calculated through eq .",
    "( static ) by integrating @xmath36 from the beginning of the contact ( i.e. , @xmath37 ) .",
    "the tangential interaction behaves like a damped spring which is formed whenever two grains come into contact and is removed when the contact finishes @xcite .",
    "the model presented above includes all features that turned out to be essential in the work here reported . if only dynamic friction forces are used in the tangential direction , these keep changing slightly _ but continuously _ once the disks have been deposited , making it impossible to decide whether the deposition process has definitively finished .",
    "the addition of static friction forces allows the deposit to reach a stable configuration .",
    "furthermore , apart from the energy dissipation on normal contact , the tangential component is also responsible for energy dissipation through the second term in eq .",
    "( [ contact ] ) .",
    "this leads to a fast decay of the total kinetic energy of the system which final value is negligible in comparison with simulations without tangential dissipation .",
    "to identify arches one needs first to identify the two supporting particles of each disk in the packing .",
    "then , arches can be identified in the usual way @xcite : we first find all _ mutually stable particles _ which we define as directly connected and then we find the arches as chains of connected particles .",
    "two disks @xmath12 and @xmath13 are _ mutually stable _",
    "if @xmath12 supports @xmath13 and @xmath13 supports @xmath12 .",
    "regardless of the way grains are deposited , they meet with and split up from other grains until they come to rest . while this process takes place , each time a new contact happens we can check if any of the two touching particles may serve to the stability of the other and save this information .",
    "equally , we can update this data when touching grains come apart .",
    "eventually , when all particles have settled , we should find that every particle has two supporting contacts and that no updates take place any longer .",
    "the algorithm that we follow to detect and update supporting contacts is described below .",
    "we consider that two particles in contact with particle @xmath12 may provide support to it only if the two particles are one at each side of @xmath12 and the center of mass ( @xmath38 ) of particle @xmath12 is above the segment that joins the two contacts .",
    "we call _ contact chord _ to this segment . for a particle and a wall to support particle @xmath12 we just need to take into account that the contact between the wall and @xmath12 has the same @xmath39-coordinate as @xmath12",
    ". a particle in contact with the base is stable per se .",
    "if at any time a particle @xmath12 has a single contact , we consider this contact as a potential first stabilizing contact ( awaiting for the second stabilizing contact to occur ) only if @xmath12 has a higher @xmath39-coordinate than the contacting particle .",
    "a contacting wall can not be considered a first stabilizing contact .",
    "we construct two arrays [ @xmath40 and @xmath41 with @xmath42 that store the indices of the _ right _ and _ left _ supporting particle of all particles in the system . if a particle has an _ undefined support _ the corresponding position in the array is set to @xmath43 .",
    "if one of the supporting contacts is a _ container s wall _ ( or base ) the corresponding position in the array is set to @xmath44 .",
    "initially , all elements of @xmath45 and @xmath46 are set to @xmath43 . after an update of all particle positions in the simulation",

    "for very high tapping amplitudes arches are again broken down partially ; new particle  particle contacts are created and arch - trapped voids are filled up .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] , the arch size distribution @xmath1 is shown for two values of the tapping amplitude .",
    "we can observe that for moderate tapping amplitudes the system has a larger number of large arches whereas for gentle tapping there is a larger amount of disks that do not belong to any arch ( @xmath107 ) .",
    "interestingly , in both cases the distribution can be fitted to a second order polynomial , in a semilogarithmic scale .",

    "[ fig : fig6 ] we show the distributions of the horizontal span of the arches and compare them with a theoretical model @xcite based on a restricted random walk .",
    "the horizontal span is the projection onto the horizontal axis of the segment that joins the centers of the right - end disk and the left - end disk of an arch .",
    "we use the results obtained for arches composed by two , three and four disks obtained for two different tapping amplitudes . at high packing fractions",
    "arch extensions appear discretized .",
    "since the system presents an ordered layered structure , the particles of any arch of @xmath4 disks form a string that connects layers ( or stay in the same layer ) so that the end - to - end horizontal projection of the arch can only be an integer number of on - layer jumps plus an integer number of between - layers jumps ; both jumps have characteristic horizontal projections in the triangular lattice formed by the disks .",
    "we saw above that although @xmath101 undergoes a decrease in its value for intermediate tapping amplitudes , it remains rather high .",
    "for this reason , although horizontal span distributions are more homogeneous , we still find some characteristic peaks for high @xmath92 .",
    "these results do not agree with the prediction of the random walk model where horizontal span distributions are smooth .",

    "the lines correspond to @xmath96 ( dotted ) and @xmath113 ( dashed ) .",
    "the solid lines correspond to the restricted random walk model @xcite ]",
    "in this section we intend to show to what extent an attempt to identify arches from the static structure of a deposited system can yield realistic results .",
    "we test two criteria that select two of the contacting particles of each particle as the supporting pair of the given grain : ( a ) _ random stabilizing pair _ , and ( b ) _ lowest stabilizing pair_. we identify all pairs of contacting particles that may  according to their relative positions and the contact chord criterion ",
    "stabilize a given grain . for criterion ( a ) we",
    "then choose one of these pairs at random as the supporting pair .",
    "for criterion ( b ) we choose the pair that has the lower center of mass . in principle",
    ", we expect that case ( b ) should provide a more reliable identification of supporting contacts since those contacting particles in lower positions may correspond to the  real \" supports , whereas those in higher positions may correspond to contacts made by further deposition of other particles on top of the particle under consideration .",
    "we will see that this is not the case .     comparing the  real \" distribution obtained from simulations ( circles ) with the distributions obtained from the static structure using criteria ( a ) ( up triangles ) and ( b ) ( down triangles ) .",
    "the inset shows the same results for @xmath96 . ]",
    "we have obtained the arch size distribution @xmath1 by applying the static criteria above to packings corresponding to @xmath96 and @xmath83 .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] shows clearly that , for disordered packings ( @xmath97 ) , arches are identified much better by the random criterion .",
    "the lowest supporting pair criterion detects less arches than the realistic dynamic criterion . as we can see  from the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] , for very ordered packings ( @xmath96 ) , both criteria fail . criterion ( a ) overestimates whereas criterion ( b ) underestimates the number of arches beyond @xmath114 .",
    "a detailed analysis of the supporting contacts detected by the static criteria shows that criterion ( a ) tends to find many false mutually stabilizing pair of particles in ordered packings , which leads to the identification of false arches .",
    "on the other hand , criterion ( b ) tends to detect too few of the real mutually stabilizing pairs of particles and for that reason the number of arches detected are fewer than with the dynamic criterion .",
    "we have presented a protocol to dynamically identify arches during the deposition of granular particles carried out through realistic granular dynamics .",
    "we find that simple static criteria can correctly identify arches to some degree for not very ordered packings .",
    "in particular , the criterion we call _ random stabilizing pair _ seems to be the most successful and could be used to identify arches in experimentally generated 2d granular beds @xcite .",
    "however , in ordered packings is very difficult to identify arches from static configurations .",
    "the reason for this is that in an ordered packing the coordination number is rather high and then the number of plausible stabilizing pairs for a given particle is higher than that in disordered packings .",
    "since choosing the correct pair is the essence of the criterion to successfully identify stabilizing contacts , the more pairs we have to chose from , the more likely we make a mistake .",
    "the packings generated by varying the tapping amplitude  quasistatically \" present a low - density disordered regime ( at high tapping amplitudes ) and a high - density , ordered regime ( at low tapping amplitudes ) .",
    "the support number decreases with increasing tapping amplitude except for of the very high tapping amplitudes .",
    "these observations are in contrast with pseudo dynamic simulations @xcite  where @xmath0 increases with @xmath94 ( except at the order  disorder transition ) .",
    "we believe that this is due to the fact that the pseudo dynamics is a good representation for fully inelastic disks that roll without slip and that  fall down \" at constant velocity  a situation that seems to be met by particles carried on a conveyor belt at low velocities @xcite .",
    "the simulations in the present work are rather far from this regime since particles can spring away from an impact and so explore a wider range of position in the box before finding a locally stable configuration .",
    "the form of the arch size distributions is in agreement with pseudo dynamic simulations .",
    "this suggests that the form of @xmath1 is rather insensitive to the deposition algorithm .",
    "the calculated number of arches grows sharply as the density decreases when the tapping amplitude is increased .",
    "however , this tendency is not monotonic and above a transition zone the number of arches decreases whereas the density increases .",
    "this feature highlights the intuitive connection between arches and density fluctuations .",
    "we have to point out here that the criterion we used to decide if two contacts may be the stabilizing contacts for a given particle @xmath12 ( i.e. that the contact chord is below the @xmath38 of @xmath12 ) , rules out the possibility that a particle be supported from  above \" .",
    "this situation does indeed arises occasionally due to static friction .",
    "two contacting particles with @xmath39-coordinates slightly above particle @xmath12 may sustain the particle due to high static friction forces .",
    "we have found that this situation indeed occurs in our simulations .",
    "indeed , some instances can be appreciated in fig .",
    "fig : fig2(b ) . a detailed analysis of these types of arches that are also found in experiments ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) will be presented elsewhere .",
