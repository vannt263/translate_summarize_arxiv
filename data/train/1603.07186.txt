    "a metasurface is a composite material layer , designed and optimized to control and transform electromagnetic waves .",
    "the layer thickness and the unit - cell size are small as compared to the wavelength in the surrounding space .",
    "recently , considerable efforts have been devoted to creation of metasurfaces for shaping reflected and transmitted waves , see e.g. review papers @xcite .",
    "however , nearly always the realized properties of metasurfaces have not perfectly satisfied the design goals . in particular , in most attempts to synthesise metasurfaces for `` perfect refraction '' of plane waves travelling along a certain direction into a plane wave propagating along a different direction , it was either found that the surface must be active @xcite or some reflections are inevitable @xcite .    here",
    "we summarize our recent results on synthesis of perfectly refractive metasurfaces .",
    "based on the general form of the impedance matrix of metasurfaces with the desired response , we identify a number of possible realizations of metasurfaces which exactly perform the desired operation . in the presentation",
    ", we will also discuss the synthesis theory for full and perfect control of reflection .",
    "let us set a goal to design a metasurface which perfectly ( without reflection or absorption ) refracts a plane wave in medium 1 ( wave impedance @xmath0 , wavenumber @xmath1 , and the incidence angle @xmath2 ) into a plane wave travelling in medium 2 ( characterized by parameters @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) in some other direction , specified by the refraction angle @xmath5 .",
    "the tangential field components @xmath6 and @xmath7 on the input side of the metasurface read ( te polarization as an example ) _ e_t1=_e_ie^-jk_1_iz,_n_h_t1= _ e_i1_1_i e^-jk_1_iz[plus ] where @xmath8 is the coordinate along the tangential component of the wavevector of the incident wave , and the unit vector @xmath9 is orthogonal to the metasurface plane , pointing towards the source ( fig .",
    "[ geom ] ) .",
    "the required fields on the other side of the surface are _ e_t2=_e_te^-jk_2_tz+j_t,_n_h_t2= _",
    "e_t1_2_t e^-jk_2_tz+j_t [ minus](@xmath10 is the desired phase change in transmission ) .",
    "the synthesis method is based on the use of the impedance matrix , which relates the tangential fields on the two sides of the metasurface as _ e_t1=z_11 _",
    "n_h_t1 + z_12 ( -_n_h_t2),_e_t2=z_21 _ n_h_t1 + z_22 ( -_n_h_t2)[21 - 22 ]    substituting the required field values , we see that the metasurface will perform the desired operation exactly , if the impedance matrix components satisfy @xmath11 @xmath12 obviously , infinitely many alternative realizations are possible , because we need to satisfy only two complex equations for four complex parameters of the metasurface",
    ". we can impose additional conditions , for example , require some extra functionality or demand that the structure be made only from reciprocal or / and passive elements , etc .",
    "some interesting possible approaches are discussed in the following .",
    "\\1 . * teleportation metasurface . * inspecting ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2a ] ) , we conclude that in general the metasurface should be non - uniform , as the parameters are functions of the coordinate @xmath8 .",
    "however , there is an interesting solution for which all the parameters are constants , and perfect refraction operation can be achieved using a uniform metasurface . indeed , assuming that @xmath13 , both equations are satisfied with z_11=_1_i , z_22=-_2_t in this scenario , the metasurface is formed by a matched absorbing layer ( the input resistance @xmath14 , a perfect electric conductor ( pec ) sheet , and an active layer ( an `` anti - absorber '' @xcite ) on the other side .",
    "the incident plane wave is totally absorbed in the matched absorber .",
    "the negative - resistance sheet ( resistance @xmath15 ) together with the wave impedance of medium  2 forms a self - oscillating system whose stable - generation regime corresponds to generation of a plane wave in the desired direction ( the refraction angle @xmath5 ) : the sum of the wave impedance of plane waves propagating at the angle @xmath5 and the input impedance of the active layer is zero , which is the necessary condition for stable generation .",
    "this structure is similar to the `` teleportation metasurface '' introduced in @xcite for teleportation of waves without changing their propagation direction .",
    "* transmitarray .",
    "* alternatively , we can demand that the metasurface is matched for waves incident from medium  2 at the required refraction angle , which means that @xmath16 . solving ( [ eq2a ] ) with this value of @xmath15",
    ", we find z_21=2 e^-j(k_2_t - k_1_i)z+j _ tfurthermore , we can set @xmath17 and @xmath18 , so that at the incidence angle @xmath2 the metasurface is acting as a matched receiving antenna array .",
    "this nonreciprocal realization obviously corresponds to conventional transmitarrays ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the incident plane wave is first received by a matched antenna array on one side of the surface and the wave is then launched into medium  2 with a transmitting phase array antenna .",
    "* double current sheets .",
    "* one can seek a realization in form of a metasurface which maintains both electric and magnetic surface currents , each subject to the corresponding impedance sheet conditions @xcite _ j_e=_n(_h_t1- _ h_t2)=y_e_e_t = y_e(_e_t1+_e_t2)/ 2 , _",
    "j_m=-_n(_e_t1-_e_t2)=y_m_h_t = y_m(_h_t1 + _ h_t2)/2[jm ] equations ( [ plus ] ) tell that relations ( [ jm ] ) can hold only if the metasurface is symmetric and reciprocal , with @xmath19 and @xmath20 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath21 , @xmath22 , and solution of ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2a ] ) is unique .",
    "however , it gives complex - valued parameters ( * ? ? ?",
    "* suppl .  mat . ) , which means that the perfectly refractive double sheet must be lossy in some areas and active in some other areas of the surface .",
    "purely reactive ( lossless ) parameters are possible only if the impedances seen from the opposite sides are equal , that is , @xmath23 .",
    "this result lead to a conclusion that lossless operation is possible only if there are some reflections @xcite .",
    "\\4 . * perfect metasurfaces formed by lossless elements .",
    "* however , perfect refraction by lossless reciprocal metasurfaces is possible if we allow bianisotropic coupling in the metasurface .",
    "it can be proved simply by solving ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2a ] ) in the assumption that the metasurface is lossless , that is , all @xmath24-parameters are purely imaginary numbers . in this case",
    "the solution is again unique and reads z_11=-j_1_i_t , z_22=-j_2_t_t , z_12=z_21=-j 1_t[x ] where @xmath25 . for the case of zero phase shift ( @xmath26 ) formulas ( [ x ] )",
    "agree with the recent result of @xcite , obtained within the frame of the generalized scattering parameters approach .",
    "bianisotropic metasurfaces with the required properties defined by ( [ x ] ) can be realized as arrays of low - loss particles with appropriate symmetry . for",
    "microwave applications , metallic canonical omega particles or double arrays of patches ( patches on the opposite sides of the substrate must be different to ensure proper magnetoelectric coupling ) can be used . for optical applications , arrays of properly shaped dielectric particles",
    "were introduced as omega - type bianisotropic metasurfaces .",
    "we have introduced a general approach to the synthesis of metasurfaces for arbitrary manipulations of plane waves .",
    "the main ideas of the method have been explained on an example of metasurfaces which perfectly refract plane waves incident at an angle @xmath2 into plane waves propagating in an arbitrary direction defined by the refraction angle @xmath5 .",
    "the general synthesis approach shows a possibility for alternative physical realizations , and we have discussed several possible device realizations : self - oscillating teleportation metasurface , transmitarrays , double current sheets , and metasurfaces formed by only lossless components . the crucial role of omega - type bianisotropy in the design of lossless - component realizations has been revealed . knowing @xmath24-parameters ( [ x ] ) , it is easy to find the unit - cell polarizabilities or surface susceptibilities and optimize the unit - cell dimensions .",
