    "there have been at least five cases in which planetary transits were detected through photometric follow - up of planets already known via their radial velocity ( rv ) discoveries .",
    "the case of hd 17156b ( @xcite ) is of particular interest since it is a 21.2 day period planet which happens to have a large eccentricity ( @xmath0 ) and an argument of periastron which places the periapsis of its orbit in the direction toward the observer and close to parallel to the line of sight , resulting in an increased transit probability .",
    "recent work by @xcite and @xcite showed that higher eccentricities of planetary orbits will increase their transit probabilities and , consequently , expected yield for transit surveys .",
    "we demonstrate the combined effect of the eccentricity , @xmath1 , and argument of periastron , @xmath2 , on transit probability . as shown by @xcite , the place in a planetary orbit where it is possible for a transit to occur ( where the planet passes the star - observer plane perpendicular to the planetary orbit ) is when @xmath3 .",
    "the probability of such a transit occurring , @xmath4 , is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the radii of the planet and star respectively , and @xmath8 is the semi - major axis .",
    "the orbital configuration , especially with regards to the values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , plays a major role in determining the likelihood of a planet transiting the parent star .",
    "as we rotate the semi - major axis of the orbit around the star we can observe how the transit probability varies using equation [ transit_prob ] . this dependence is shown in figure 1 for eccentricities of 0.3 ( dashed line ) and 0.6 ( dotted line ) in comparison with the constant transit probability for a circular orbit ( solid line ) . since the shape of this variation is independent of period , @xmath9 , the y - axes are scaled for both a 4.0 day and 50.0 day period orbits . note that @xmath4 scales linearly with the sum of @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the peak transit probability occurs at @xmath10 , and the corresponding increase in @xmath4 as compared to a circular orbit can be significant ; a factor of 1.5 for @xmath11 and a factor of 2.5 for @xmath12 .",
    "moreover , the fraction of the orbital path which produces a higher value of @xmath4 than the circular orbit with the same period ( corresponding to the fraction of range in @xmath2 for which the dotted or dashed line is above the solid line in figure 1 ) increases with increasing eccentricity .    , for eccentricities of 0.0 , 0.3 , and 0.6 , plotted for periods of 4.0 days ( left ordinate ) and 50.0 days ( right ordinate ) .",
    "stellar and planetary radii are assumed to be a jupiter and solar radius , respectively.,width=340 ]",
    "the current distribution of eccentricities for the known extra - solar planets indicates that orbits within 0.1  au tend to be forced into nearly circular orbits through tidal circularization , whereas longer period orbits can possess a great range of eccentricities ( @xcite ) .",
    "indeed most of the planets beyond 0.1  au have eccentricities in excess of 0.3 .",
    ", as a function of period , for eccentricities of 0.0 , 0.3 , and 0.6.,width=340 ]    in figure 2 we show mean transit probability as a function of period after averaging over @xmath13 , for the period range @xmath14 days",
    ". eccentricities of 0.0 , 0.3 , and 0.6 are shown with solid , dashed , and dotted lines , respectively .",
    "as expected , we see that doubling the eccentricity from 0.3 to 0.6 creates a significant increase in the mean transit probability .",
    "most affected are the longer period planets whose eccentric orbits can raise their likelihood of transit from a negligible value to a statistically viable number for photometric follow - up .",
    "figure 3 shows the transit probability calculated from orbital parameters provided by @xcite for planets with estimates of @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( 203 planets in total ) . for the purposes of comparison ,",
    "we assume a jupiter and solar radius for the values of @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively , and include a solid line which indicates the transit probability for a circular orbit .",
    "in addition , the sub - panel in the plot shows the difference in @xmath4 between the actual orbit and a hypothetical circular one of the same period ( residuals ) .",
    "the mean value of the residuals for all 203 planets is positive but relatively small ( @xmath15 ) , and is dominated by the low transit probability of the long period planets .",
    "the mean residual of planets with @xmath16 days yields an overall increase of @xmath17% in @xmath4 .     between the the actual orbit and a hypothetical circular orbit for each of the planets.,width=340 ]    hd  17156b , a transiting planet with 21.2 day period ,",
    "is shown as a 5-pointed star .",
    "its transit probability is greatly increased by its orbital parameters .",
    "note that the actual @xmath4 of hd  17156b is larger than the 5% shown in figure 3 since the radius of the host star is 1.47 solar radii . at longer periods ,",
    "the planets with the largest residuals are hd  156846b , hd  4113b , and hd  20782b , which have periods of 359.51 , 526.62 , and 585.86 days , respectively .",
    "the probability residuals for these three planets are 0.024 , 0.032 , and 0.025 respectively , the effect of which is to raise their transit probabilities to the same level as hd  17156b if it were in a circular orbit .",
    "the majority of radial velocity planets have been detected around @xmath18 stars .",
    "@xcite showed that 1.0 m class telescopes are ideal instruments to photometrically monitor these targets . by selecting observable targets with well constrained transit windows and high transit probabilities ,",
    "an optimised campaign can be constructed .",
    "we can determine the significance of a hypothetical null result from a photometric follow - up campaign by performing a monte - carlo simulation of the transit probabilities calculated from equation [ transit_prob ] and the tabulated planetary and stellar paramaters of @xcite . performing this calculation @xmath19 times for each star",
    "produces a probability distribution for the number of transiting planets expected from this sample , as shown in figure 4 .",
    "the mean value of @xmath20 transits peaks at @xmath21 with a standard deviation of @xmath22 .",
    "the probability that none of the planets in this sample transit their host star is @xmath23% .",
    "in fact , three of the planets in this sample are known to transit , specifically hd 17156b , gj 436b , and hd 147506b .",
    "hence the current number of transiting planets from this sample is almost 1@xmath24 below the expectation .",
    "this demonstrates that the offset is quantifiable , and that further transit discoveries in this sample are possible or even likely which would lead to further understanding of the respective observational biases of the rv and transit methods ."
