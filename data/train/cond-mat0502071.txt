    "understanding phases with topological order has become an important theme in condensed - matter physics .",
    "well - understood examples of topological fluids include the fractional quantum hall states which arise for electrons in two dimensions moving in large magnetic fields .",
    "the existence of quasiparticles or quasiholes with fractional statistics is a central and striking prediction of the theory of the fractional quantum hall effect and follows directly from the nature of the electronic correlations in this quantum fluid@xcite . in spite of its profound conceptual importance , only this week",
    "has there been a report of experimental confirmation of this startling prediction@xcite .",
    "non - abelian fractional statistics are a fascinating property of some fractional quantum hall states @xcite . here , the wave function depends not only on which particles are braided , but on the order in which they are braided : the states carry a non - abelian ( matrix ) representation of the braid group .",
    "one of the motivations for the current consideration of non - abelian phases is the realization that a physical system in a non - abelian topological phase behaves effectively as a universal quantum computer@xcite .",
    "the topological quantum fluids arising in the fractional quantum hall effect have an effective hydrodynamical description in terms of chern - simons gauge theories@xcite .",
    "pure chern - simons is a topological field theory , meaning that its correlators are independent of the position of the operators and depend only on topological invariants@xcite .",
    "it has a vanishing hamiltonian ; the only non - trivial properties arise from the braiding of its wilson and its polyakov loops . in this paper",
    "we are mainly interested in theories whose _ ground state _ is topological , but whose gapped excitations have non - abelian statistics",
    ".    fractional quantum hall fluids do not have time - reversal symmetry , but topological order occurs in models with unbroken time - reversal invariance as well .",
    "these  spin - liquid \" phases were originally speculated to be responsible for the unusual behavior of the  normal state \" of high temperature superconductors@xcite although , in spite of much effort both theoretical and experimental , there is yet no solid evidence for any spin - liquid state . nevertheless , as a consequence of much ( theoretical ) effort",
    ", we know that topological order occurs in the ground states in certain gapped systems with time - reversal invariance and reasonably - local interactions@xcite , for example in quantum dimer models on non - bipartite lattices@xcite . morally , these topological phases are equivalent ( in the sense of asymptotic low energy theories ) to deconfined phases of an effective gauge theory .",
    "the excitations of these time - reversal invariant phases do exhibit electron fractionalization@xcite , but the statistics is abelian .",
    "non - abelian topological phases are even harder to come by",
    ". such phases with broken time - reversal symmetry do occur in the fermionic pfaffian ( a.k.a .",
    "moore - read ) wave function @xcite for the @xmath1 fractional quantum hall effect , and in the @xmath2 bosonic pfaffian state@xcite .",
    "the former occurs in models of @xmath3-wave superconductors as well @xcite .",
    "field theories with such non - abelian statistics also have been found @xcite . in a number of these cases ,",
    "the long - distance physics can be described by a chern - simons gauge theory , which breaks time - reversal symmetry .",
    "non - abelian topological phases , however , occur in time - reversal - invariant systems as well@xcite .",
    "the resulting effective chern - simons theory is doubled to restore the time - reversal symmetry . to give the theory a gap",
    "while keeping the topological theory as its ground state , one can include the electric - field part of the maxwell term @xmath4 in the hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "hence in these topological phases , the ground - state wave function is a superposition of configurations of wilson loops in two - dimensional space , while the world - lines of the excitations correspond to polyakov loops in the 2 + 1-dimensional field theory @xcite .",
    "for example , the lattice models discussed in detail in refs .   have a continuum description in terms of doubled @xmath5 chern - simons gauge theory .",
    "the resulting configuration space is naturally associated with the temperley - lieb algebra@xcite .",
    "a natural description of the configuration space of models in a topological phase is in terms of loops @xcite .",
    "this holds in both abelian and non - abelian cases .",
    "precisely , each basis state in the hilbert space of the quantum theory is a loop configuration in two dimensions .",
    "quantum dimer models and their generalizations @xcite can also be viewed as quantum loop gases .    in this paper",
    "we reexamine the problem of non - abelian topological phases by starting with the statistics we wish to have , and working backward to construct a model which exhibits them .",
    "we thus first give an algebraic way of characterizing the braiding in both @xmath5 and @xmath6 chern - simons theories .",
    "we show that such a braid matrix of a 2 + 1-dimensional theory is a limit of the @xmath7-matrix of an associated relativistic 1 + 1 dimensional model , and give an intuitive argument as to why this is so .",
    "we then show how to explicitly construct quantum two - dimensional models with these braid relations by utilizing the structure of the factorizable @xmath7-matrices of integrable 1 + 1-dimensional models .",
    "specifically , we embed the 1 + 1-dimensional model in two - dimensional euclidean space , and find a rokhsar - kivelson - type quantum hamiltonian@xcite acting on this two - dimensional space whose ground state has the properties expected of a model with non - abelian statistics . in both cases we discuss in detail , the hilbert space is that of a loop gas : in the @xmath5 case , the loops are self - avoiding and mutually - avoiding@xcite , while in the @xmath6 case , the loops intersect .",
    "the latter are thus more akin to nets than loops@xcite .",
    "both these loop gases are associated with well - known two - dimensional classical statistical mechanical models : in the @xmath5 case , this is the known as the @xmath8 lattice model with @xmath9 , while in the @xmath6 case , this is the @xmath10-state potts model with @xmath11 .",
    "the loop expansion of the former is well known@xcite , but the one we utilize for the potts model does not seem to have been discussed before .    having an explicit lattice construction of the states enables us to construct ( reasonably ) local quantum lattice models with these ground state wave functions . by studying the statistical properties of the absolute value squared of these wave functions",
    ", we can investigate the correlations described by these quantum states , and determine if they describe quantum critical points or massive ( topological ) phases .",
    "both here and in the @xmath12 case@xcite , the result depends on the level @xmath13 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : braids ]",
    "we describe the algebraic approach to non - abelian statistics in both the @xmath5 case and @xmath6 cases . in section [ sec : qlg ] we discuss quantum loop gases and their relation to the @xmath7 matrix of 1 + 1-dimensional integrable field theories . in section",
    "[ sec : examples ] we give an explicit construction of these @xmath7-matrices for @xmath0 and @xmath12 braiding . in section [ sec : field ]",
    "we discuss the corresponding 1 + 1-dimensional field theories . in section [ sec : lattice ]",
    "we discuss lattice models whose ground states are precisely the loop wave functions , both @xmath5 and @xmath6 , with the desired braiding properties .",
    "we give a set of specific criteria that 2 + 1-dimensional quantum hamiltonian ought to satisfy and give an explicit construction . in section [ sec : phase ] we discuss under what circumstances these wave functions are topological and when do they describe quantum critical systems . in appendix",
    "[ app : rsos ] we give a summary of the landau - ginzburg description of the 1 + 1-dimensional theories whose @xmath7 matrix we use .",
    "particle statistics , of course , are the effect on the wave function when particles are adiabatically transported around each other a large distance away .",
    "this picture follows from the familiar concept of adiabatic particle transport , developed in detail in the context of the laughlin states of the fractional quantum hall effect where it follows from the berry phase accumulated during an adiabatic evolution of the state with two quasiparticles@xcite .",
    "adiabatic particle transport can be represented pictorially by drawing the world lines of the particles , which are the paths they trace out in space - time . since the particles stay far apart , we need only study paths which do not cross .",
    "( non - trivial braid statistics always require the assumption that particles have a hard - core short distance repulsion ) .",
    "the world lines of the particles therefore _ braid _ around each other .",
    "formally , the set of all possible braidings is a group , acting on the space of states of the system . different types of statistics correspond to different representations of the braid group . in this paper",
    "we consider two spatial dimensions , where both abelian and non - abelian statistics are possible .",
    "a system whose quasiparticles are associated with a non - abelian representation of the braid group has a degenerate set of states of quasiparticles at fixed positions @xmath14 . call this space of states @xmath15 .",
    "the states in @xmath15 are locally indistinguishable but differ topologically . when a quasiparticle is taken around another , states in this degenerate subspace are rotated into each other . since this is quantum mechanics , it can take a state to a linear combination of other states : adiabatic particle transport can entangle the states .    although we will not require its use , it is useful to note that non - abelian statistics can be implemented in a local field theory by assigning to each quasiparticle a charge and a flux under a non - abelian gauge group . within this picture ,",
    "a quasiparticle carries a representation @xmath16 ( i.e. a ` charge ' ) of the gauge group @xmath17 and a flux @xmath18 .",
    "when quasiparticle @xmath19 is taken around quasiparticle 2 , its internal state @xmath20 is rotated to @xmath21 by the action of the flux @xmath22 which is associated with quasiparticle 2 .",
    "it is worth keeping in mind that this picture is not gauge invariant , and there is , in fact , no local degree of freedom associated with each quasiparticle ( since a gauge transformation can change @xmath23 into any other @xmath24 and can change the flux @xmath25 into any other element of its conjugacy class @xmath26 ) .",
    "studying the statistics of a 2 + 1-dimensional system can effectively be reduced to a two - dimensional problem .",
    "we project the world lines onto the plane ( ignoring boundary conditions ) , and call them _",
    "strands_. when there are @xmath27 particles , we have @xmath27 strands . a braiding in 2 + 1 dimensions results in the crossing of two strands in the two - dimensional picture . in this projection , there are overcrossings and undercrossings . as long as we are only interested in the statistics of the particles , the other details of the projection are not particularly important : we can move the strands around at will as long as we do not remove crossings or create new ones .",
    "it is useful to think of this collection of strands in the plane in a 1 + 1-dimensional fashion .",
    "the degenerate states of the 2 + 1-dimensional system correspond to a set of degenerate multi - particle states in a one - dimensional quantum system . in this 1 + 1-dimensional quantum system , each strand is the world line of a real local degree of freedom .",
    "heuristically , this is the `` gauge - fixed '' version of the model . consider a configuration at @xmath28 ( _ i.e. _ before any of the particles have been braided ) where all the particles are very far from each other ( _ i.e. _ all at spatial infinity ) .",
    "we can thus consider these particles to all be on a circle .",
    "this circle is our one - dimensional space .",
    "we can construct the full configuration by a sequence of adiabatic braidings as the particles move inward .",
    "since we are free to move around the strands as long as we do not add or remove crossings , we can then take all the particles at @xmath29 to lie on a circle as well .",
    "thus we can project all the original 2 + 1-dimensional world - lines onto a two - dimensional annulus .",
    "we can then view the angular direction of the annulus as one - dimensional space , and the radial direction as ( euclidean ) time .",
    "thus , each configuration in the plane can be regarded as an adiabatic evolution in an equivalent 1 + 1-dimensional euclidean field theory in which each strand ( or particle ) belongs to a given hilbert space associated with the species .    to make this more precise ,",
    "let us consider the @xmath27-particle space of states @xmath15 on which the braid group acts .",
    "for now we let this space be the tensor product of @xmath27 copies of the single - particle space of states : @xmath30 .",
    "( later , we will see that the actual space of states is a subspace of @xmath31 . ) in the 1 + 1 dimensional picture , we can think of @xmath31 as the space of particles on a circle .",
    "the elements of the braid group corresponding to overcrossings and undercrossings are denoted @xmath32 and @xmath33 and are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : braid ] .",
    "the subscript @xmath34 means that @xmath32 is describing the crossing between the @xmath34th and the @xmath35th particles , and so acts non - trivially on the space @xmath36 , and with the identity on the other spaces @xmath37 , with @xmath38 .",
    "for example , the braids in fig . [",
    "fig : ybraids ]    are described algebraically as @xmath39 .",
    "the braid - group generators @xmath32 must satisfy the relations @xmath40 these relate configurations which are topologically identical , as can easily be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : ybe ] .",
    "if the matrices @xmath32 are diagonal , then the statistics are abelian . for bosons the @xmath32 matrices are all the identity ; for anyons their entries are phases . in this paper",
    "we are interested in non - abelian representations of the braid group , so that particles obey non - abelian statistics : the wave function changes form depending on the order in which the particles are braided .",
    "one can give explicit matrix representations of the braid group .",
    "however , it is usually much convenient to study the algebra of the matrices involved . in the cases of interest here , the statistics of the particles can be obtained directly from the algebraic relations the matrices obey , without need for their explicit representation .      a famous one - parameter set of non - abelian representations of the braid group arises from utilizing the temperley - lieb algebra @xcite .",
    "these representations give rise to the jones polynomial in knot theory @xcite , and correspond to the braiding of wilson and polyakov loops in @xmath12 chern - simons theory .",
    "the temperley - lieb algebra originally arose as a way of relating the potts models to the six - vertex model .",
    "the transfer matrices of these two models ( and a number of other models ) can be written in terms of different representations of this algebra .",
    "this means that any properties of the model which can be computed from purely algebraic considerations will be the same for any such model .",
    "a generator of the temperley - lieb algebra @xmath41 acts non - trivially on the @xmath34th and @xmath35th particles ; a useful pictorial representation is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : braid ] .",
    "the algebra is @xcite @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a parameter .",
    "these algebraic relations are drawn in fig .",
    "[ fig : tlalg ] .    from the picture",
    ", one can see that @xmath43 can be thought of as the weight of a closed loop .",
    "representations of the braid group can be found from representations of the temperley - lieb algebra by letting @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the identity .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : bie ] .",
    "the @xmath32 defined in this fashion obey the braid - group relation ( [ braid ] ) when @xmath46 it is also easy to check that @xmath47 note that in writing the braid group in this fashion , we have resolved the crossings @xmath48 and @xmath49 in terms of strands which no longer intersect .",
    "these braid relations are those of wilson loops in @xmath5 chern - simons theory when @xcite @xmath50 or equivalently @xmath51 .",
    "the integer @xmath13 is the coefficient of the chern - simons term in the gauge theory , and is known as the level .",
    "it must be an integer to ensure gauge invariance of the chern - simons gauge theory @xcite .",
    "the configuration space of wilson loops on the plane is a very large space and arbitrary superpositions of these states do not obviously describe a topological ground state .",
    "it turns out that in order to enforce the condition that states be purely topological , these ground states must satisfy additional properties which can be enforced by means of a suitable projection operator .",
    "this is known as the jones - wenzl projector , which acts on @xmath52 strands without crossings . for details on its application in this context ,",
    "see refs . .",
    "we will give an algebraic description of this below . by construction , states obtained by means of this projector are topological and do not support local low energy degrees of freedom .",
    "conversely , unprojected states can describe low energy , even massless , degrees of freedom , and are unphysical states in a topological gauge theory such as chern - simons .",
    "however , unprojected states may describe degrees of freedom associated with quantum critical points .      here",
    "we discuss another one - parameter set of non - abelian representations of the braid group .",
    "these describe the braiding in @xmath0 chern - simons theory , instead of @xmath12 .",
    "the algebras are of course the same ; the key distinction is that wilson and polyakov loops in @xmath0 chern - simons occur in only integer - spin representations .",
    "the corresponding representation of the braid group is given in terms of the @xmath0 birman - murakami - wenzl ( bmw ) algebra @xcite , defined below .",
    "this algebra has two non - trivial generators @xmath53 and @xmath54 acting on adjacent strands .",
    "the @xmath0 braid relations can be found by `` fusing '' together two strands obeying the temperley - lieb algebra : the @xmath0 bmw generators @xmath53 and @xmath54 can be written in terms of the temperley - lieb generators @xmath41 .",
    "heuristically , the idea is to exploit the fact that a spin-1 representation of @xmath0 can be found from the tensor product of two spin-@xmath55 representations of @xmath12 .",
    "this statement is still true in the `` quantum - group '' algebra @xmath56 , which is a one - parameter deformation of the ordinary lie algebra @xmath57 .",
    "one can define an action of @xmath56 on the space of states @xmath31 which commutes with the @xmath41 ; see ref . for an extensive discussion of quantum groups in the context of non - abelian statistics (",
    "@xmath58 there is @xmath59 here ) .",
    "in particular , to relate the two algebras , first note that @xmath60 is a projector . in @xmath56 language",
    ", this projects onto the trivial spin-0 representation .",
    "the projector onto the spin-1 representation is therefore @xmath61 so that @xmath62 . the single - particle space of states @xmath63 in the @xmath64 bmw algebra is comprised of two `` fused '' temperley - lieb strands , projected onto the spin-1 representation . in an equation , @xmath65 $ ] .",
    "pictorially , just think of each strand in the @xmath64 theory as the left - hand - side of fig .",
    "[ fig : proj ] .    with this identification",
    ", the @xmath64 bmw algebra follows from the temperley - lieb algebra .",
    "since lines never cross in the latter , they can not cross in the former either .",
    "when two of the fused strands come near each other , there are now three possibilities for what happens , which we display in fig .",
    "[ fig : ixe ] .    from the pictures , we read off that @xmath66 these generators act on the two - particle states in @xmath67 .",
    "it is straightforward to verify using ( [ tlalg ] ) that they obey the @xmath68 bmw algebra .",
    "we have @xmath69 where the parameter @xmath70 .",
    "relations involving generators on adjacent sites ( _ e.g. _ @xmath71 ) are straightforward to work out using the temperley - lieb algebra ; they can be found for example in ref .  .",
    "most become fairly obvious after drawing the appropriate picture .",
    "the relations involving only the @xmath72 are those of the temperley - lieb algebra , but with @xmath43 replaced here by @xmath73 , so that closed isolated loops of `` spin-1 '' particles get a weight @xmath74 .",
    "this factor of @xmath75 is obvious from the pictures ; the @xmath76 comes from the @xmath43 from each loop , and @xmath19 must be subtracted because of the projection onto spin-1 states ( projecting out the singlet ) .",
    "the reason we have done all this work is to give us another representation of the braid group .",
    "namely , defining @xmath77 it is straightforward to check using the @xmath64 bmw relations that the @xmath78 satisfy the braid - group relations ( [ braid ] ) .",
    "@xmath79 is the identity on the projected hilbert space @xmath80 ; on @xmath31 , we have @xmath81 ( see fig.[fig : ixe ] ) .",
    "one can also check that @xmath82 particles with braiding given by @xmath83 arise from @xmath0 chern - simons theory .",
    "this follows from our construction : we basically have restricted the particles to be associated with integer - spin representations of @xmath56 ; this is precisely what one does to go from @xmath12 to @xmath0 .",
    "the jones - wenzl projector is simply expressed in terms the projector @xmath84 onto the representation of spin @xmath85 of @xmath56 : for a given @xmath13 it is simply @xmath86/2)}_j=0 $ ] for all @xmath87 .",
    "this projector involves @xmath52 strands , so this amounts to being able to replace the identity acting on @xmath52 strands with a linear combination of other temperley - lieb or bmw elements .",
    "the necessity of this projection is also apparent from the representation theory of @xmath56 : when @xmath88 , the spin-@xmath89 representation is reducible but is indecomposable ( it can not be written as a direct sum of irreducible representations ) .",
    "performing the projection avoids all sorts of complications such as zero - norm states .",
    "we have already seen one example of such a projector .",
    "the projector @xmath90 is the projector onto the spin-1 representation of the quantum - group algebra , so @xmath91 .",
    "when @xmath92 , the jones - wenzl projector is simply @xmath93 : any spin-1 combination of strands is projected out .",
    "therefore the @xmath0 theory at @xmath94 is trivial .",
    "a case of great interest is @xmath95 , the `` lee - yang '' model .",
    "this is the simplest model of non - abelian statistics , because there is only one type of non - trivial braiding .",
    "the naming arises because the braiding relation for the particle in this model is the same as the fusion rule associated with the lee - yang conformal field theory@xcite .",
    "we have for any @xmath13 in both the @xmath12 and @xmath0 models @xmath96 when @xmath97 , the jones - wenzl projector sets @xmath98 . in the @xmath99 theory , this is a relation involving four strands , while in the @xmath95 theory , this relates two of the fused strands .",
    "this means that in @xmath95 , imposing the jones - wenzl projector allows us to replace any appearance of a generator @xmath53 in favor of @xmath79 and the @xmath54 : we have @xmath100 plugging this back into the braid relation ( [ braidbmw ] ) and remembering that @xmath101 gives @xmath102    note that for this value @xmath97 ( and this value alone ) , the generators @xmath54 obey the same temperley - lieb algebra as the @xmath41 , because @xmath103 .",
    "moreover , @xmath104 here , so the braid generator ( [ braidbmw3 ] ) is equivalent to that in ( [ be ] ) .",
    "we thus are led to an intriguing result : the @xmath105 theory is almost identical to that of @xmath99 .",
    "there is one important difference : in @xmath95 , we have already imposed the jones - wenzl projector , while in @xmath99 this still needs to be imposed .",
    "thus ( locally ) @xmath95 with the jones - wenzl projection imposed is equivalent to @xmath99 _ without _ it imposed .",
    "in the preceding section we discussed some of the marvelous properties of particles with non - abelian statistics . now we discuss how to associate the @xmath7 matrix of a relativistic 1 + 1-dimensional field theory to the type of braiding discussed above .",
    "we argue that knowing the @xmath7 matrix in this 1 + 1-dimensional theory allows us to find a quantum loop gas in _ two space dimensions _ where the quasiparticles should have these braid relations .    a natural place to look for models with non - abelian statistics is in _ quantum loop",
    "gases_. the reason is that if one projects the world lines onto the ( spatial ) plane , one obtains loops : strands can not end .",
    "it is also natural from the point - of - view of field theory : in pure chern - simons theory the only gauge - invariant degrees of freedom are loops . in a 2 + 1-dimensional picture , this means it is a good idea to look for a system where the low - energy degrees of freedom are loops in the plane , a quantum loop gas . in a number of cases it has been argued that quantum loop gases turn into gauge theories with chern - simons theories in the continuum @xcite .",
    "the excitations can be non - abelian in a _",
    "topological phase _",
    ", where the ground state contains a superposition of wilson loops ( loops in the spatial plane ) .",
    "the excited states are polyakov loops , loops which extend in the time direction .",
    "the quasiparticles have non - abelian statistics when the gauge group is non - abelian with level @xmath106 , ref .",
    ".    to understand these loop gases , it is best to first focus on the properties of the ground state .",
    "the types of ground states we are interested in are liquid states , where all local order parameters have vanishing expectation values .",
    "such a ground state is a superposition of different loop configurations .",
    "the basis states @xmath107 of the hilbert space can all be described by some configuration of loops in two dimensions . in these models ,",
    "the wave function @xmath108 of this ground state can be written in the form @xmath109 where @xmath110 turns out to be the action of the _ classical _ two - dimensional loop model for the configuration corresponding to @xmath85 .",
    "@xmath111 is the usual two - dimensional partition function with weight @xmath112 , which is the functional integral over all configurations @xmath85 with weight @xmath113 .",
    "however , just because the loops can be non - local does not mean the action needs to have long - range interactions .",
    "recall , for example , that one can describe all the configurations in the classical two - dimensional ising model in terms of closed loops of arbitrary length , the domain walls . nevertheless , the interactions are still local .",
    "since we are identifying the loops with the quasiparticle world lines , we need to find a quantum loop gas whose ground - state wave function satisfies the appropriate braiding properties . to make this notion precise ,",
    "let us examine the classical loop gas ( _ i.e. _ the one with action @xmath110 ) corresponding to the ground state .",
    "now view this two - dimensional loop gas as a 1 + 1-dimensional quantum system .",
    "the loops then can be thought of as world lines of particles in this 1 + 1-dimensional system .",
    "their wave function is then a vector in the space @xmath31 , just like before .",
    "the braid generators act in the same way as well .    to summarize the arguments so far : we project the world lines of the particles in 2 + 1 dimensions down onto the plane , so that they form loops .",
    "a two - dimensional quantum system possessing such particles is a loop gas , where the degrees of freedom are loops in the plane .",
    "the ground - state wave function of the quantum system is the expressed in terms of the action @xmath110 of the corresponding classical two - dimensional loop gas .",
    "finally , we then identify these loops as the world lines of particles in the corresponding 1 + 1-dimensional problem .",
    "the upshot is that by restricting ourself to considering the ground state , we have reduced a 2 + 1-dimensional problem to a 1 + 1-dimensional one .",
    "theories for which this construction holds are inherently _ holographic _ in that the degrees of freedom can be naturally projected to a boundary .    in the 1 + 1-dimensional theory ,",
    "when two particle world lines cross , the @xmath7 matrix plays the role of the braid matrix .",
    "in other words , it describes what happens to the wave function when the paths of two particles cross .",
    "consider the wave function describing two particles of momentum and position @xmath114 and @xmath115 respectively .",
    "the @xmath7 matrix is a matching condition on the wave functions for @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",

    "this means that the @xmath7 matrix depends only on the relative rapidity @xmath121 : defining @xmath122 and @xmath123 , we have @xmath124 .",

    "when the particle mass is small , one can create particles of any rapidity @xmath138 , and so the rapidity difference @xmath139 will typically be large .    to conclude this section , we note that there are two important additional steps to take in constructing a quantum loop gas having quasiparticles with non - abelian statistics .",

    "the second additional step is to make sure that the excited states have braid relations which are those of the loops in the ground state .",

    "each strand is labeled by the two dual spins to the left and right of it , which must differ by @xmath165 .",
    "the key effect of the restriction is the fact that dual spins only range from @xmath19 to @xmath52 .",
    "this is a consequence of not allowing @xmath52 consecutive strands to have spin @xmath89 .    a useful way of understanding the dual spins comes from treating each strand as being a spin-1/2 representation of @xmath56 , and a dual spin @xmath166 as being a spin-@xmath167 representation .",

    "the domain walls are indeed the objects whose scattering is described by the @xmath7 matrix . in the 1 + 1-dimensional picture ,",
    "the excitations can be thought of as kinks , as discussed in appendix [ app : rsos ] .",
    "of course there are multiple lattice models with the same continuum @xmath7 matrix .",

    "the dense and dilute phases are not dual to each other ; the former has algebraically decaying correlators , while the latter s decay exponentially .",
    "the same statements can be made in the context of the height models describing the perturbed minimal models .",
    "the way of understanding this complication is to remember that in the dilute phase the arguments of section [ sec : qlg ] suggest that @xmath7 matrix really is describing the scattering of the excitations themselves , _",

    "the lesson is that the braiding should indeed be interpreted as that in the dilute phase , even though the topological point is in the dense phase where loops proliferate .      several field theories with the @xmath7 matrix of eq .",
    "were identified and discussed by smirnov @xcite .",
    "the case we will focus on here corresponds to a perturbation of a minimal conformal field theories with central charge of eq .. however , for a given @xmath13 , both the minimal model and the perturbation are different from the @xmath12 case .",
    "this time , we have @xmath222 , and the perturbation is by the @xmath223 operator .",
    "it is convenient to use the much - better - known interpretation of this field theory as the continuum description of the @xmath10-state potts model where @xmath10 is given by @xcite @xmath224 the potts model can defined for all @xmath10 in terms of its high - temperature expansion , where @xmath10 becomes a parameter .",
    "this definition does not have local boltzmann weights for arbitrary @xmath10 , but for our special values with @xmath13 integer , there is a lattice model with the same high - temperature expansion .",

    "the lesson is that when there is a duality , the operator which creates excitations in one phase is the one which gets the expectation value in the dual phase@xcite .    to conclude this section , we recall that there is another model which has an @xmath7 matrix of the form of eq .. this is the tricritical potts model , which in conformal field theory language corresponds to the minimal model with @xmath218 perturbed by the @xmath236 operator .",
    "one could presumably build quantum loop gases based on the tricritical models as well .",
    "since in two dimensions , the tricritical point is unstable to perturbations toward the ordinary critical point , this would presumably hold as well in the 2 + 1-dimensional version .",

    "we study models where the solution of this equation can be written in the form of eq . :",
    "the basis elements of the hilbert space can be thought of as a configuration in a classical two - dimensional lattice model , and the weight of this configuration can be expressed in terms of a local action . a key requirement that we will impose",

    "the strands form closed non - intersecting loops : _ i.e. _ each vertex has either 0 or 2 links with occupied links touching it .",

    "although we have not proven so , we believe that proceeding in this fashion one can define local @xmath243 which result in an ergodic hamiltonian . this should also be possible on other lattices , but presumably be even more complicated , since one must worry about loops which touch at only a point .",
    "obviously , there is no conceivable way such finely - tuned hamiltonians could be realized in nature .",
    "however , the fact that they are local makes it at least possible that there exists a more natural hamiltonian in the same universality class .",
    "since we have identified the classical field theories which describe the ground state of the quantum loop gas , we can determine the phase structure of the latter .",
    "there is a major subtlety in doing so .",
    "so far , we have been discussing properties of the wave function @xmath322 .",
    "however , in determining equal - time correlation functions of the quantum system , the functional integral is weighted by @xmath323 . in terms of the action of the corresponding classical model",
    ", we have from eq . , @xmath324 for a configuration @xmath85 in the classical model .",
    "thus when we are computing for example correlators in the quantum model , we need to _ square _ the boltzmann weights of the classical model . in a model where the loops themselves are the degrees of freedom ( such as those discussed in section [ sec : lattice ] , the ones without the jones - wenzl projector imposed ) , this means the weight per loop must be squared . in particular , this means loops in the @xmath12 model get weight @xmath76 , while isolated loops in the @xmath0 model have weight @xmath325 .",
    "the phase structure depends on the weight per length of the loops .",
    "let us first review what happens in a quantum eight - vertex model @xcite .",
    "there the degrees of freedom in the ground state are arrows on the links of the square lattice obeying the eight - vertex condition ( an even number of arrows pointing in at each vertex ) .",
    "the loops are given by following ( say the up and right - pointing ) arrows around the lattice ; the eight - vertex condition ensures the loops are closed .",
    "one can rewrite these degrees of freedom as ising spins at the center of each plaquette , and the loops then form domain walls around the spins .",
    "the purely topological ( kitaev ) point@xcite , corresponding to our @xmath230 and @xmath326 models , has equal amplitude for all configurations .",
    "this is indeed infinite temperature for the ising spins . by including a weight per length of the loop",
    ", one can move away from the kitaev point . as detailed in ref .",
    ", there is eventually a phase transition to an ordered phase .",
    "the interesting question to answer is if this is a critical point or a first - order phase transition . in the quantum eight - vertex model of ref .  , the transition is second order . in the analogous transition in the @xmath12 case @xcite",
    ", each loop will get a weight @xmath76 , so we can view this as a loop model with @xmath327 .",
    "the @xmath328 model has a critical point only when @xmath329 , so this occurs only for @xmath94 and @xmath330 . only the latter is non - abelian .",
    "the analogous result in the classical potts model is that the phase transition at the self - dual point is second - order if @xmath331 , first - order for @xmath332 .",
    "this result , however , can not instantly be applied to the 2 + 1-dimensional case , because of the weighting by @xmath323 : the phase structure is that of the classical loop gas where each configuration is weighted by @xmath333 .",
    "this loop gas does not seem to have been studied before , so we do not know the answer .",
    "however , we can make a simple conjecture .",
    "the configurations of this squared loop gas are of course the same as those of the potts loop gas ; only the weight per loop has been squared .",
    "one might therefore hope that the phase transition of the squared loop gas is in the same universality class as the potts loop gas at some @xmath334 .",
    "the simplest possibility is to assume that @xmath334 gives isolated loops in the squared loop gas the correct weight @xmath335 .",
    "this amounts to a @xmath334 of @xmath336 the weight per unit length is also changed , but this only changes the location of the critical point , not its type .",
    "thus we conjecture that there will be a critical point in the quantum loop gas if @xmath337 , and a first - order transition otherwise .",
    "if this conjecture is true , critical points occur for @xmath338 in the @xmath0 model ( as noted above , @xmath94 is a trivial theory here ) .",
    "the @xmath97 model has non - abelian statistics . as noted at the end of section [ subsec : jones ] , this `` lee - yang '' model is the simplest model of non - abelian statistics , since it has only one kind of strand .",
    "we have thus shown that in the quantum loop gas which realizes particles with these statistics , there exists a critical point separating the topological phase from an ordered one .",
    "however , there s a catch .",
    "the jones - wenzl projector needs to be imposed separately to the loop models discussed in section [ sec : lattice ] , at least when space is an annulus or a torus .",
    "this presumably amounts to a relevant operator at the critical point @xcite .",
    "thus in the non - abelian case even at @xmath97 , reaching the critical point from the topological phase requires tuning another parameter away .",
    "this is in harmony with some of our early observations .",
    "at the end of section [ subsec : bmw ] we noted that for the @xmath0 model with @xmath97 , one can use the jones - wenzl projector to remove @xmath195 vertex , leaving only self - avoiding loops .",
    "the @xmath95 model with the projection is therefore equivalent ( at least locally ) to the @xmath99 model .",
    "the latter does _ not _ have a critical point , even without the jones - wenzl projector , because @xmath97 in @xmath12 case corresponds to an @xmath328 loop model with @xmath339 .",
    "this is a strong indication that imposing the jones - wenzl results in a relevant perturbation of the critical theory .",

    "in this appendix we explain how the field theories discussed in section [ sec : field ] , and their @xmath7 matrices discussed in section [ sec : examples ] , have a nice description in terms of a landau - ginzburg effective field theory .    as shown in ref .  , a simple landau - ginzburg description of the minimal model of conformal field theory with central charge of eq . is in terms of a single scalar field @xmath340 with potential @xmath341 .",
    "the critical point of the ising model is the @xmath342 case , and the tricritical point is the @xmath343 case , and the corresponding @xmath344 and @xmath345 potentials have long been known .",
    "the critical point of the @xmath5 case ( the continuum limit of the @xmath8 or restricted height models ) has @xmath218 .",
    "the critical point of the @xmath6 case ( the continuum limit of the potts or dilute @xmath346 models ) has @xmath222 .",
    "the primary fields of the conformal field theory also can be described in terms of @xmath340 , so the massive field theories of interest have a landau - ginzburg description as well . for the @xmath5 case , the effective description of the @xmath219 operator is @xmath347 . for the ising model ,",
    "this is indeed the usual @xmath348 mass term .",
    "as is well known , this field theory has a single quasiparticle with @xmath349 . in this case",
    ", @xmath41 must act on a one - dimensional space , and it is just a number ; for @xmath342 , @xmath350 .",
    "this also follows from imposing the jones - wenzl projector : for @xmath94 , one imposes @xmath351 , which indeed gives @xmath352 .",
    "thus the statistics for @xmath230 is abelian @xcite .    for higher values of @xmath3 , perturbing",
    "a @xmath341 potential by @xmath347 seems to induce a flow to the minimal model with @xmath3 decreased by @xmath19 .",
    "this flow is indeed known to occur for perturbations of one sign of @xmath219 , see ref . .",
    "in the @xmath8 language , this perturbation corresponds to flowing into the dense phase . in the models of ref .",
    "this is called regime iv .",
    "this is not what we want ; this is a massless field theory with the problematic @xmath7 matrix .",
    "instead , we want to perturb by the same operator @xmath219 but with the opposite sign ; the perturbations are not the same because there is no symmetry in the conformal field theory ( except in the ising case ) which sends @xmath219 to @xmath353 . with this sign of the perturbation ,",
    "the potential must renormalize to include extra terms . since we know from the exact results@xcite that the lattice models have @xmath354 ground states , we must fine - tune the potential to achieve this .",
    "this is very familiar from the tricritical ising model @xmath343 .",
    "one sign of the perturbation moves the system along its first - order transition line , while the other sign causes a flow to the ordinary ising critical point .",
    "the landau - ginzburg potential along the first - order line indeed consists of a @xmath345 potential tuned to have three degenerate minima .",
    "let us focus on @xmath343 case in more detail .",
    "the landau - ginzburg potential for the tricritical ising model along its first - order transition line along is @xmath355 , with @xmath356 so that there are three degenerate minima at @xmath357 .",
    "with such a potential , the low - energy configurations in the two - dimensional classical model consist of regions of these three vacua .",
    "the loops are domain walls between different vacua . when there are restrictions on which vacua can be adjacent to each other , the allowed domain walls are restricted as well .",
    "what happens here is that the vacuum @xmath358 is not allowed to be next to the vacuum @xmath359 .",
    "hence , there must be a region of vacuum @xmath247 in between .",
    "in the 1 + 1-dimensional description in terms of quasiparticles , the particles are kinks interpolating between adjacent vacua , and the domain walls are their world lines .",
    "one can now count the `` number '' of particles .",
    "say the left end of the system is in the vacuum @xmath247 .",
    "then the space of states for one particle @xmath360 is two - dimensional ; it consists of a kink going from @xmath247 to @xmath358 , and one going from @xmath247 to @xmath359 .",
    "however , the space @xmath361 is also two - dimensional : the reason is this restriction that the two vacua @xmath362 can not be next to each other .",
    "thus , if we have a kink going from @xmath247 to @xmath358 , the next kink can only go back to @xmath247 again .",
    "the dimension of the allowed hilbert space for @xmath27  particles \" , @xmath15 ( with the boundary condition of vacuum 0 at one end ) , is therefore @xmath363}$ ] , where @xmath364 $ ] is the integer part of @xmath365.this reduction of the hilbert space , with respect to the standard free particle fock space , is the hallmark of non - abelian statistics .",
    "using the standard definition of the  number of particles \" as ln(dim@xmath366 , here we find @xmath367 this is indeed the correct value of @xmath43 for @xmath330 , and gives a precise meaning to the statement that @xmath43 , the weight per loop , can be interpreted as counting the  number of particles going around a given loop \" ( albeit this  number \" is @xmath367 ! ) .",
    "thus we see how these restricted kinks in 1 + 1 dimensions go hand - in - hand with non - abelian statistics in 2 + 1 dimensions . in the moore - read theory of the @xmath368 fractional quantum hall effect @xcite , the quasiparticles have non - abelian statistics , and the number of states obeys the same formula @xmath369}$ ] , where @xmath27 here is the number of quasiholes (  non - abelions \" ) @xcite .    for general @xmath5 theories ,",
    "we consider a @xmath370 potential with @xmath52 minima .",
    "( the explicit potential can be written out in terms of chebyshev polynomials if desired . )",
    "the kinks interpolate between adjacent vacua , so that their world lines are domain walls in the two - dimensional picture . to count the `` number '' of such kink configurations for large @xmath27",
    ", one applies the same procedure as above , and obtains @xmath371 . in the read - rezayi generalizations of the moore - read theory of the fractional quantum hall effect @xcite , the statistics and the number of states is the same @xcite .    for the @xmath372 case , the perturbation of the conformal minimal model is different .",
    "the @xmath223 operator is @xmath373 , but the resulting landau - ginzburg description is not as useful .",
    "however , in section [ sec : braids ] we showed how to describe representations of the @xmath0 bmw algebra by fusing together representations of the temperley - lieb algebra , and the analog is possible here .",
    "we can describe the kinks in the potts models as bound states of the kinks of the @xmath8 model , although we believe that in the @xmath7 matrix context this is a formal device without physical significance .",
    "anyway , we consider the same potential with @xmath52 degenerate minima , but the @xmath372 kinks are comprised of two of the @xmath5 kinks . more precisely , we consider all configurations made up of two @xmath5 kinks bound together , and then subtract off the identity .",
    "this procedure yields the correct fusion rules for spin-1 particles , and the correct `` number '' of kinks @xmath75 .",
