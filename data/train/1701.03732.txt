    "bandwidth - intensive mobile applications , such as video streaming , cloud - based services and social media apps , have gained momentum in cellular networks . consequently there is an escalating demand for cellular data service with higher efficiency , larger capacity and better cell coverage .",
    "cellular operators keep upgrading their networks and deploying new equipments to cater for such a growing demand . for example ,",
    "rogers , a major cellular service provider in canada , recently launched their lte - advanced ( lte - a ) service in 12 major canadian markets @xcite .    as high as the traction to expand the lte market",
    ", there is a trend to deploy more base stations for denser coverage in a geographical area .",
    "it is intended to improve signal quality in general , but comes with the cost of increased radio interference between neighbouring cells .",
    "the problem exacerbates when many users locate at the edge , rather than around the center , of a macrocell site @xcite .",
    "furthermore , high frequencies employed by lte leads to quick signal strength degradation during propagation .",
    "the situation further deteriorates with the introduction of mmwave spectrum , which is planned for the upcoming 5 g communication @xcite .",
    "radio signals are more easily attenuated by hills , buildings , foliage and even heavy rain , making cellular communication less reliable in certain outdoor and indoor scenarios @xcite",
    ".    the problem could be alleviated by a heterogeneous network infrastructure ( hetnet ) .",
    "the hetnet is a wireless network exploiting multiple types of access nodes , including macrocells , picocells and femtocells , to to improve coverage in a given area and to offer users better experience .",
    "a macrocell has the widest coverage , and serves as the main pole connecting to distant areas .",
    "femtocells cover a much smaller range , and are typically deployed to enhance signals in compact space .",
    "different access nodes can be deployed in a flexible combination to fit the needs of varying application scenarios such as office buildings , homes , shopping malls and subway stations @xcite .",
    "the hetnet solution is adopted in the lte - a standard , where relay nodes ( rns ) are introduced to provide small cell coverage at cell edges @xcite .",
    "different from current picocells and femtocells that use fibre - based backhauls , rns in lte - a are connected to the macrocell via a radio interface .",
    "it is possible to deploy rns everywhere without installing fibre or broadband infrastructure in advance .",
    "rns hence have the potential of flexibly and substantially improve lte - a cell coverage . due to the use of in - band wireless connection as the backhaul , rns may cause interference with the macrocell . the situation may become worse when a large number of rns and user equipments ( ues ) are served directly by the same donor _ enodeb _ within the macrocell .    a possible solution to the interference problem caused by rns",
    "is time - sharing using a pre - determined , static inter - cell interference coordination scheme @xcite .",
    "however , such static sharing is not flexible and may lead to resource under - utilization under time - varying workload in the rns small cells .",
    "furthermore , rns can be installed by the users themselves , instead of mobile network operators , to improve coverage at user locations such as offices , homes , farms , and stores in large shopping malls .",
    "a coordination based solution may be vulnerable because users have no incentive to provide truthful information to the centralized controller , when falsified information may help selfish users to obtain extra benefits .",
    "compared with static spectrum sharing , auction based dynamic sharing can promptly adapt to network dynamics .",
    "the auction approach is further efficient in allocating resources to where they are most valued .",
    "truthfulness is a key property pursued in auction mechanism design , precluding deceitful bids from strategical bidders driven by their own interests .",
    "the celebrated vickrey - clarke - groves ( vcg ) auction is known to guarantee both truthfulness and economic efficiency in terms of social welfare maximization . however , vcg auctions require solving the underlying winner determination problem ( wdp ) multiple times",
    ". the underlying wdp is proven np - hard in many real world auction scenarios , including the one in this work .",
    "hence the vcg auction is impractical to apply directly , given its computational complexity . in the performance evaluation section , we show that solving the wdp optimally in a hetnet is impossible within in tolerable time , even using a state - of - the - art integer program solver cplex @xcite .    as a result",
    ", we resort to efficient approximation algorithms that run in polynomial time to conduct spectrum allocation in an lte - a hetnet . along with a judiciously designed payment rule",
    ", the approximation allocation algorithm can be converted to a truthful auction .",
    "we focus on two hetnet models in this work , including a relaying base station model and an extended hetnet model . for the former ,",
    "resource blocks are considered as homogeneous .",
    "the latter model considers heterogeneous resource blocks , in which ues and rns experience varying channel quality over different channels .",
    "two approximation algorithms are designed using the primal - dual framework . then",
    "two auctions , aiming at soliciting truthful bids from selfish users , are proposed for the two hetnet models respectively .",
    "we prove that both auctions are truthful and individual rational , and both run in polynomial time . using a primal - dual analysis based on linear programming duality",
    ", we also prove an approximation ratio that guarantees the outcome would be nearly optimal for the relaying base station model .",
    "in particular , in practical scenarios where the total amount of allocated resource is far larger than the amount of resource requested by a single user in a single time slot , the theoretical ratio approaches @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the base of natural logarithm .",
    "extensive simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the proposed auction mechanisms at large system scales .",
    "simulation results exhibit close - to - optimum performance in terms of social welfare for both mechanisms , much better than suggested by the theoretical worst - case bound @xmath0 .",
    "the total throughput and individual throughput are further compared , showing that the proposed mechanisms achieve relatively high system throughput .",
    "for the extended hetnet model , we also compare the proposed auction with alternative schedulers from the literature , revealing that our auction could produce higher social welfare and relatively fair resource sharing .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we discuss background and related work in sec .",

    "an lte system has two major components : the evolved packet core ( epc ) and the evolved nodebs ( _ enodeb _ ) or basestations @xcite . the epc is composed of a range of entities , among which the mobility management entity ( mme ) provides key control functions in the control plane , and the home subscriber server ( hss ) stores user information in its database .",
    "the serving gateway ( sgw ) is connected to the _ enodeb_s , and serves as the end point of e - utran in the data plane . the packet gateway ( pgw )",

    "* resource allocation .",
    "* the minimum allocation unit of radio resource in lte and lte - a is a resource block ( rb ) , whose size is @xmath4 khz in frequency domain and @xmath5 ms in time domain @xcite . in practice ,",
    "rbs are often allocated in a group .",
    "the group size varies depending on the configuration of bandwidth .",
    "for example , for system bandwidth between @xmath6 and @xmath7 mhz , a group of two rbs form an atomic resource allocation unit .",
    "* cqi reporting . * in lte and lte - a , channel quality indicator ( cqi ) reporting plays a critical role in spectrum allocation and transmission scheduling .",
    "the cqi value ranges from @xmath8 to @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "each value indicates a supportable modulation ( qpsk , 16qam , 64qam ) and coding rate .",
    "high cqi values imply high channel quality and high data rates .",
    "a series of recent studies focus on wireless relay networks .",
    "oyman @xcite analyzes the spectrum efficiency of opportunistic scheduling and spectrum reuse algorithms in orthogonal frequency - division multiple - access ( ofdma ) cellular networks with relay stations .",

    "_ @xcite propose mechanisms to determine relay selection as well as relay power allocation in a cooperative communication network .",
    "both works focused on the existence of nash equilibrium of proposed mechanisms , while our work focuses on the dominant - strategy solutions with individual rationality and good approximation ratio in social welfare .",
    "wireless spectrum is a scarce resource ; efficient utilization of spectrum resources is key to the optimization of a wireless communication network .",
    "spectrum auctions represent an efficient solution approach , which have been extensively studied in wireless networks .",
    "@xcite propose two spectrum auctions : an optimal vcg - type auction and a suboptimal truthful auction .",
    "however the former is computationally infeasible while the latter does not provide performance guarantee in terms of approximation ratio .",
    "@xcite design a truthful auction for secondary spectrum markets .",
    "nevertheless their design exploits a packing structure in the underlying problem while our problem is essentially a non - packing problem .",

    "@xcite further extend the randomized auction to an online scenario where user requests arrive on the fly . yet again",
    "both solutions require the underlying wdp to be of packing type .",
    "we consider an lte - a hetnet where the wireless network employs heterogeneous types of access nodes .",
    "the system runs in a time slotted fashion . in each time slot , the hetnet system , whose controller is behind the donor _ enodeb _ and located in the epc , allocates available resource blocks ( rbs ) to the rns as well as the ues , while avoiding interference within the cell . towards efficient rb allocation ,",
    "the system adopts an auction - based allocation approach .",
    "suppose that the downlink in a single donor cell consists of a donor _ enodeb _ and a set @xmath10 of rns with cardinality @xmath11 .",
    "let @xmath12 be the spectrum band the _ enodeb _ is using .",
    "the total number of rbs within a single time slot is @xmath13 .    at each time slot , the controller in the epc acts as the auctioneer , soliciting bids from bidders that include rns as well as ues , as shown in figure [ fig : model ] .          our first model , the relaying bs model , focuses on allocating homogeneous rbs among rns as well as ues based on their submitted bids , while ensuring that a sufficient number of rbs is reserved for the intra - rn communication so that all participants in the system can communicate simultaneously .",

    "each rb can be allocated to at most one bidder in the cell , in order to avoid interference , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath30    another important constraint is that the number of rbs allocated to each relay node for downloading data from the donor _ enodeb _ should be smaller than that reserved for the inner communication between rns and their ues , _",
    "i.e. _ , the system should reserve a sufficient number of rbs for the intra - rn communication in order to achieve seamlessly transmission between ues served by rns and the donor _ enodeb_.    @xmath31    let @xmath32 and @xmath33 be the payment and true valuation of bidder @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "the _ utility _ of @xmath18 is then :     @xmath34    the _ social welfare _ of the hetnet is defined as the summation of all utilities , including the seller and the bidders . under truthful bidding , social welfare equals @xmath35 , since payments cancel themselves .",
    "the winner determination problem ( wdp ) is :    @xmath36 subject to :    @xmath37    the allocation result includes , for each user @xmath38 : which rbs can be used to download data from the donor _ enodeb _ , and which can be used to send data to ues served by rns .",
