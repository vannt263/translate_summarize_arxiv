    "one of the interpretations , the _ stability - limit conjecture _ @xcite , assumes that the limits of stability of the superheated , supercooled and stretched liquid form a single retracing spinodal line in the pressure  temperature ( @xmath6@xmath7 ) plane . this scenario predicts a divergence of the response functions at the supercooled liquid - to - liquid spinodal @xcite .",
