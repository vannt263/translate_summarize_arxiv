    "<S> the study of novel topological phases of matter has become one of the most active fields in condensed matter physics . </S>",
    "<S> these phases are interesting because while deviating qualitatively from the conventional insulating phase , they can not be described by any _ </S>",

    "<S> heuristically , the word ` topological ' implies the presence of some _ global _ property , i.e. , contributed by all electrons in the system , that distinguishes this special phase . </S>",
    "<S> such a property is usually marked by a global observable that takes different values in a topological phase and in the conventional insulating phase ( normal phase ) adiabatically continuable to the atomic limit . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , ` topological ' also implies that this global observable is quantized , or discretized , so that a topological phase can not be adiabatically connected to the normal phase . any quantized global observable characteristic to a topological phase </S>",
    "<S> is called a bulk topological invariant .    to date </S>",
    "<S> , topological phases have been identified in various systems , including those with intrinsic topological order ( fractional quantum hall states)@xcite , topological band insulators@xcite , topological superconductors@xcite and topological semimetals@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the focus of this paper is on topological band insulators , or simply topological insulators ( ti ) . a typical , and first , </S>",
    "<S> example of ti is the integer quantum hall state@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the bulk topological invariant of this state is the quantized hall conductance , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 , and its value remains fixed when magnetic field and gate voltage change within a certain range , resulting in a series of plateaus . </S>",
    "<S> thouless  @xcite showed that the quantized hall conductance is proportional to the chern number ( tknn number ) of a @xmath9 bundle over the 2d magnetic brillouin zone ( bz ) , first time linking a quantized physical quantity to a topological number previously studied in the context of algebraic topology and differential geometry . </S>",
    "<S> it was then realized that since the chern number is well - defined in any translationally invariant insulator regardless of the magnetic field , nonzero quantized hall conductance can also appear _ without _ external magnetic field ( or net magnetic flux ) . </S>",
    "<S> insulators with nonzero chern numbers are later dubbed chern insulators ( or quantum anomalous hall insulators)@xcite . in general , the 2d chern number of a translationally invariant insulator is given by@xcite [ eq : defchern ] c=_n_bz_ij_i_n(k)|_j|u_n(k)^2k , where @xmath10 is the bloch wavefunction of the @xmath1th band at @xmath11 , and integral over bz should be replaced with the one over magnetic bz if there is an external magnetic field . from eq.([eq : defchern ] ) , it is clear that the chern number is a global quantity contributed by all occupied electrons in the system .    if on top of translational symmetry , there is time - reversal symmetry ( trs ) in the system , then one can prove that the chern number defined in eq.([eq : defchern ] ) always vanishes , a case often referred to as trivial . in the absence of nonzero chern number </S>",
    "<S> , the natural question then is : what is the bulk topological invariant for this system , if any ? </S>",
    "<S> the answer is obvious when the @xmath12-component of the total spin , @xmath13 is conserved ( commutes with the hamiltonian ) , because in this case the two spin components are decoupled so that we can define the chern numbers for spin up ( @xmath14 ) and spin down ( @xmath15 ) separately . due to trs , @xmath16 , hence the quantityc_s=(c_-c_)is a nontrivial bulk topological invariant , also known as the spin hall conductance@xcite ( when multiplied by @xmath17 ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , when @xmath18 is not conserved , the definition of the bulk topological invariant is not a simple extension of the chern number . according to fu and kane@xcite , the nontrivial topology in a 2d insulator with translational </S>",
    "<S> symmetry and trs can be characterized by a @xmath19-number , i.e. , a quantity that takes only two values . </S>",
    "<S> the explicit expression of this @xmath19-number is not given here but we point out that it is linked to a quantized physical quantity , namely , the change in the ` time - reversal polarization ' over half of the bz . </S>",

    "<S> , @xmath5 has another physical meaning : it is the coefficient of the axion term of the electrodynamics of the insulator in the compact space ( having periodic boundary conditions in all directions)@xcite , h_axion = p_3,and is in principle measurable with electromagnetic induction experiments . in order for @xmath5 to be a @xmath19-index ( taking only two possible values ) </S>",
    "<S> , it must be quantized by some symmetry . in an insulator with no symmetry </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath5 defined in eq.([eq : defp3 ] ) is an arbitrary number between zero and unity ; but trs quantizes it to either zero or one - half . </S>",
    "<S> nontrivial @xmath19 topological insulators in 2d and 3d have odd number of gapless dirac edge and surface modes respectively , as has been confirmed by experiments@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> other than the linear dispersion around the dirac points , these surface / edge states distinguish themselves by the absence of backscattering@xcite .    from these previous studies </S>",
    "<S> , we can see that symmetries of a system play a key role in the definition of its bulk topological invariants . </S>",
    "<S> trs has a two - fold effect : it on one hand constrains the chern number to be zero , and on the other hand makes possible the definition of a new @xmath19 number . </S>",
    "<S> an interesting question then is : if we consider adding other symmetries to an insulator , will there be new bulk topological invariant(s ) characteristic to the added symmetries ? answering this question on a general ground is not easy , because it takes a detailed study of the homotopy groups of continuous mappings from the @xmath20-dimensional bz to a target space of projectors under the symmetry constraints . </S>",
    "<S> along this line , schnyder   gave a list of all bulk topological invariants for each of the ten classes of hamiltonians in the presence / absence of trs , particle - hole symmetry and chiral symmetry for @xmath21@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> all the three symmetries considered in ref . </S>",
    "<S> are symmetries on internal degrees of freedom , which do not change the position or orbital character of an electron . </S>",
    "<S> topological properties protected by these internal symmetries are in general robust against random factors such as disorder . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the requirement of trs excludes a spectrum of interesting materials that have magnetism while particle - hole symmetry and chiral symmetry are not to be found in realistic normal insulators but only in superconductors or maybe optical lattices . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is desired to extend the study of topological invariants to systems with other symmetries . in condensed matter electronic systems </S>",
    "<S> , it is natural to consider the lattice symmetries in the classification of insulators , because of their universal existence in solids , nonmagnetic and magnetic . along this line , fu first studied possible new @xmath19-index in 3d spinless trs insulators with fourfold rotation symmetry@xcite ; hughes _ _ et al__@xcite and turner__et </S>",
    "<S> al__@xcite independently developed theories for inversion symmetric topological insulators without trs .    in 3d </S>",
    "<S> there are 230 types of lattice symmetries , in which the simplest , yet nontrivial , one is the inversion symmetry , which sends an electron at @xmath22 to @xmath23 leaving its spin invariant . </S>",
    "<S> insulators with inversion symmetry have been previously studied@xcite and it is shown that this symmetry affects the topological properties in two ways . first , its existence places constraints on the values of bulk topological invariants such as the chern number and the @xmath19 number : in ref . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the parity ( even or odd ) of the chern number is determined by the inversion eigenvalues of occupied bands at four inversion invariant @xmath11-points in the bz , regardless of the bloch wavefunction at all other @xmath11-points ; the @xmath19 number of a ti with trs can also be determined by the inversion eigenvalues at all inversion invariant @xmath11-points@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> second , inversion symmetry alone brings about new topological invariants _ without _ trs . </S>",
    "<S> we have mentioned that @xmath5 is quantized to zero and one - half by trs , and ref . </S>",
    "<S> shows that in the absence of trs , @xmath5 is still quantized by inversion symmetry and is equal to , up to an integer , half of the winding number of the inversion sewing matrix ( to be defined in sec.[sec : prelim](b ) ) .    </S>",
    "<S> in this paper , we study topological insulators subject to a more general class of lattice symmetries : crystallographic point group symmetries , or simply point group symmetries ( pgs)@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> insulators with pgs are invariant under a certain set of rotations and reflections that leave at least one point fixed in space . in the language of crystallography , by only considering pgs and lattice translational symmetry , we restrict the discussion to insulators with symmorphic space groups . </S>",
    "<S> simply speaking , in a symmorphic space group , there are only point group operations plus translations by lattice vectors , while the a general space group can contain combined operations of a point group operation followed by a translation of fractions of lattice vectors . </S>",
    "<S> we ask two questions regarding the relation between pgs and bulk topological invariants : ( i ) how does a given pgs constrain the value of a topological invariant such as the chern number ? </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) can a given pgs give us new bulk topological invariants , or quantized global quantities ?    </S>",
    "<S> for 2d insulators , we answer these questions by an exhaustive discussion of all nine nontrivial pgs invariant insulators , divided into two types : those invariant under cyclic pgs @xmath24 and those under dihedral pgs @xmath25 . for @xmath0-invariant insulators , </S>",
    "<S> we first show that the chern number is determined by , or constrained by , the @xmath26 eigenvalues of each occupied single particle band at discrete high - symmetry points in bz , where @xmath27 evenly divides @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> from there we further prove that the chern number modulo @xmath1 is determined by the @xmath0 eigenvalue of the _ many - body _ ground state , or slater determinant in the noninteracting case . for @xmath2-invariant insulators , </S>",
    "<S> we prove that while the chern number is constrained to zero , the electric polarization , or more strictly , the dislocation of the electronic charge center from the nearest lattice point , becomes a bulk topological invariant , the value of which is determined by eigenvalues of @xmath26 .    in 3d , there are in total 31 nontrivial pgs , and instead of exercising an exhaustive study , we focus on establishing a link between the given pgs and the presence / absence of two experimentally interesting topological invariants : nonzero quantized 3d hall conductance and quantized magnetoelectric coefficient @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that only @xmath0 , @xmath3 , @xmath28 pgs are compatible with nonzero hall conductance while all other pgs lead to zero hall conductance in all three components . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we prove that the sufficient and necessary condition for the quantization of @xmath5 ( to zero and one - half ) is that the pgs contains at least one improper rotation , and @xmath29 can be expressed as the winding number of the sewing matrix associated with that improper rotation symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> this excludes the following point groups from having quantized @xmath5 : @xmath0 , @xmath2 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , 11 distinct point groups in total . </S>",
    "<S> these major results are summarized in table [ tab:2d_table ] for 2d and table [ tab:3d_table ] for 3d .            </S>",
    "<S> the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sec : prelim ] , we introduce concepts and basic formulae constantly used throughout the paper , including a brief introduction to hilbert space representations of crystallographic point groups in sec.[sec : prelim](a ) , definition and basic properties of the sewing matrix associated with a pgs operator in sec.[sec : prelim](b ) and the definition of basic properties of path - ordered loop integrals in bz in sec.[sec : prelim](c ) . in sec.[sec : pgs2d ] , we show how the chern numbers in @xmath0-invariant 2d insulators can be determined by eigenvalues of symmetry operators at high - symmetry @xmath11-points in sec.[sec : pgs2d](a ) , and how the chern number in @xmath0-invariant 2d insulators can be determined by the @xmath0 eigenvalue of the slater determinant in sec.[sec : pgs2d](b ) . in sec.[sec : diheral ] , we show that @xmath2-invariant insulators have zero chern number in sec.[sec : diheral](a ) and that the electric polarizations are quantized thus being topological invariants and how to calculate them in sec.[sec : diheral](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> we study 3d insulators with pgs in sec.[sec : pgs3d ] , including the 3d quantum hall effects in sec.[sec : pgs3d](a ) and quantization of 3d magnetoelectric coefficient @xmath5 in sec.[sec : pgs3d](b ) . in sec.[sec : conclusion ] we conclude the work . </S>"
