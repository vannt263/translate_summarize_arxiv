    "m31n 2008 - 12a showed the shortest recorded recurrence period of 1 yr , a very rapid turn - on of the stable supersoft x - ray source ( sss ) phase , and a high effective temperature ( @xmath5 ev ) in the sss phase , all of which indicate a very massive white dwarf ( wd ) .",
    "such massive wds in recurrent novae are considered to be one of the candidates for type ia supernova ( sn  ia ) progenitors @xcite .",
    "sne ia play very important roles in astrophysics as standard candles for measuring cosmological distances and as the main producers of iron group elements in the chemical evolution of galaxies .",
    "however , their immediate progenitors just before sn ia explosions are still unclear .",
    "thus , studies of novae with very short recurrence periods are essential to identify immediate progenitors of sne  ia .",
    "many theoretical works on hydrogen shell flashes have been published . in general ,",
    "short recurrence periods are obtained for very massive wds with high mass accretion rates .",
    "when the mass accretion rate exceeds a certain value , nuclear burning is stable , and no shell flashes occur @xcite .",
    "the border between stable and unstable mass accretion rates is known as the stability line , i.e. , @xmath6 , in the diagram of accretion rate vs. wd mass . for a given wd mass ,",
    "the shortest recurrence period is obtained near the stability line .",
    "however , it is not well known whether this minimum recurrence period approaches a finite value or zero .",
    "@xcite recently obtained numerically the recurrence periods near the stability line for various wd masses and showed that the minimum recurrence period is finite .",
    "however , the theoretical reason for the finite value is still unclear .",
    "moreover , the stability line obtained by @xcite using a time evolution calculation differs slightly from that obtained using a linear stability analysis @xcite . because the stability line is important in binary evolution calculations toward sne  ia",
    ", we examine the stability line of shell flashes and clarify why there is a finite minimum value of the recurrence period .    in the next section ,",
    "we explain the reason for the finite minimum values of the nova recurrence period . in section [ sec_evolution ] , we present calculations of shell flashes on very massive wds and",

    "we first discuss the cycle of shell flashes using hydrostatic envelope models .",
    "we calculated the structures of the hydrogen - rich envelopes on a mass - accreting wd by solving the equations of hydrostatic equilibrium , mass continuity , energy conservation , and energy transfer together with the equation of state for degenerate matter @xcite .",
    "we used the opal radiative opacities @xcite .",
    "the equation of energy conservation includes terms for nuclear burning , gravitational energy release , and radiative loss . for the gravitational energy release",

    ", we plot three mass accretion rates : above the stability line , i.e. , @xmath15 ( thin solid line ) ; somewhat below the stability line , i.e. , @xmath16 ( thick solid line ) ; and much below the stability line , i.e. , @xmath17 ( dotted line ) .",

    "hydrogen shell burning is stable on this branch @xcite .    for the thick solid line ( @xmath16 ) in figure [ flash ]",
    ", a mass - accreting wd begins its evolution from somewhere on the degenerate branch around point a. the envelope mass increases with time because of accretion and moves rightward along the degenerate branch .",
    "after it reaches the turning point of the degenerate branch ( point b ) , the hydrogen shell burning becomes unstable , triggering a shell flash .",
    "the envelope structure changes from a geometrically thin configuration to a very bloated one .",
    "the photosphere expands , and the photospheric temperature rapidly decreases .",
    "this is the onset of a nova outburst .",
    "the envelope mass at point b corresponds to the ignition mass , i.e. , @xmath19 .",
    "after the wd jumps to point c , it moves leftward as the envelope mass decreases owing to wind mass loss and nuclear burning @xcite . this `` stable branch '' corresponds to expanded envelopes in the decay phase of a nova outburst .",
    "the photospheric radius gradually shrinks while the photospheric temperature increases .",
    "the optical brightness decays with time @xcite .",
    "after the optically thick winds stop at point d , the envelope mass continues to decrease owing to nuclear burning .",
    "as the envelope mass decreases , the radius of the envelope continues to decrease , so that the geometry of the envelope gradually changes from a spherically , extended configuration to a thin one . as a result",
    ", @xmath14 decreases with the decreasing envelope mass from point d to e. when the wd reaches a turning point ( point e ) , hydrogen burning becomes inactive because the envelope mass is too small to support high temperatures .",
    "the unstable branch starts at point e. the nuclear burning rate at point e should be the same as that at the stability line , i.e. , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the nuclear burning rate , @xmath22 is the luminosity of hydrogen burning , @xmath23 is the hydrogen mass fraction , and @xmath24  erg  g@xmath2 is the energy generation per unit mass .",
    "the star quickly falls to point a on the degenerate branch . in this way",
    ", a nova follows a limit cycle of points a , b , c , d , e , and then a.    figure [ flash ] also shows two other tracks for lower ( @xmath17 , dotted line ) and higher ( @xmath15 , thin solid line ) mass accretion rates . for the lower mass accretion rate , the degenerate branch is cooler owing to the smaller gravitational energy release , but the position of the unstable branch ( from point e to b ) hardly changes .",
    "for this reason , point b is shifted rightward for the lower accretion rate ; hence , the ignition mass is larger . for the higher mass accretion rate , on the other hand ,",
    "point b moves leftward . as a result ,",
    "the ignition mass is smaller .",
    "the higher the mass accretion rate is , the narrower the limit cycle of nova outbursts is .",
    "the width of this limit cycle @xmath25 is defined for each s - shaped line as @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the envelope masses at turning points b and e , respectively .",
    "we found that the width does not vanish even for very high mass accretion rates above the stability line ( @xmath15 , thin solid line in figure [ flash ] ) .",
    "in other words , the finite @xmath25 is the reason for the finite minimum recurrence period of @xmath29 when the mass accretion rate increases toward the stability line , @xmath30 .",
    "@xcite also presented the stability line in the hr diagram as a locus of minimum envelope masses of accreting wds .",
    "the envelope mass has a minimum value at the knee near the highest temperature on the locus of an accreting wd .",
    "this corresponds to point e in figure [ flash ] .",
    "@xcite wrote that `` the steady - burning solution is unstable along the low luminosity branch . ''",
    "@xcite also discussed the stability change at point e in relation to the change of envelope structure from a spherical configuration ( upper branch ) to a flat configuration ( lower branch ) .",
    "@xcite calculated the minimum envelope masses for various wd masses and chemical compositions ( co / one rich ) using the opal opacities .",
    "they wrote , `` hydrogen burning will continue until the minimum envelope mass and maximum effective temperature are reached ; evolution can not proceed further with stationary hydrogen - burning . ''",
    "thus , hydrogen burning is extinguished , and the envelope enters the cooling phase .",
    "the tracks in figure [ flash ] differ slightly from those of our time - dependent calculations , as will be described in detail in section [ sec_evolution ] .",
    "we will identify the exact stability line using a time - dependent calculation in section [ section_stability ] .",
    "finally , we discuss the case that the mass accretion rate is larger than that of the stability line . for the thin solid line ( @xmath15 ) in figure [ flash ] , the wd accretes hydrogen - rich matter and",
    "reaches turning point b. hydrogen ignites to trigger a shell flash .",
    "after the wd jumps from turning point b to point c , it stays at a point on the stable branch to the right of point e because the mass accretion rate is larger than the nuclear burning rate at point e ; i.e. , @xmath31 .",
    "we emphasize that , after the first shell flash occurs , the wd stays at a point on the stable branch , and the shell flashes never repeat .",
    "we will discuss this in more detail in section [ enforced_novae ] .",
    "in this section , we present and discuss the results of time evolution calculations for part of the nova cycle .",
    "we used a henyey - type evolution code , which is the same as that in @xcite except that a term proportional to @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the specific entropy , is included to follow the evolution .",
    "the chemical composition of the accreting matter and initial hydrogen - rich envelope is assumed to be @xmath34 , and @xmath35 , except for the cases in section [ sec_composition ] .",
    "neither convective overshooting nor diffusion processes are included ; thus , no wd material is mixed into the hydrogen - rich envelope .    as the initial model",
    ", we adopted an equilibrium model ( i.e. ,  the steady - state models  of * ? ? ? * ) , in which an energy balance is already established between heating by mass accretion and nuclear energy generation and cooling by radiative transfer and neutrino energy loss .",
    "this is a good approximation , as we will see later , of the long time - averaged evolution of a mass accreting wd .",
    "thus , starting from such an initial equilibrium state , we expect that the ignition mass estimated on the basis of the first flash is close to the final one .",
    "using this equilibrium model for the initial evolution model is advantageous because , after many flashes , the temperature distribution in the wd interior in a recurrent nova is expected to be similar to that of the equilibrium model accreting at the same rate .",
    "this is a good approximation , in particular , for short - period recurrent novae with very high accretion rates .",
    "we assumed no helium layer between the wd core and hydrogen - rich envelope . in some cases",
    ", we followed several shell flashes to confirm that the equilibrium approximation is adequate .",
    "henyey - type evolution codes are well known to have difficulties in calculating extended envelopes after a shell flash . to continue our calculation",
    ", we assumed large mass loss rates so that the radius does not exceed 0.01 ",
    "0.02  @xmath36 .",
    "the mass loss rate thus determined is artificial and does not represent any physical processes in nova outbursts .",
    "although we adopted the smallest possible mass loss rates , this artificial mass loss would shorten the duration of a flash ( i.e. , the high state ) .",
    "we suppose , however , that it has little effect on the resultant recurrence period because the durations of the flashes are much shorter than the recurrence period .",
    "we obtain the ignition mass for a given wd mass and mass accretion rate as follows : we start our evolution calculation by reducing the envelope mass to half that of the corresponding equilibrium model .",
    "the nuclear luminosity @xmath22 initially decreases because of the reduced envelope mass .",
    "this process corresponds to a falling path from a point on the unstable equilibrium branch toward the degenerate branch in figure [ flash ] . as the envelope mass",
    "is increased by accretion , the wd moves rightward and reaches point b , at which hydrogen burning becomes unstable , and a shell flash occurs .",
    "we define the ignition mass @xmath37 as the envelope mass at the onset of the flash .",
    "the ignition mass obtained in this way depends very little on the process or amount of initial reduction of the envelope mass ; e.g. , no reduction or a 90% reduction yields a similar value of @xmath38 .",
    "figure [ tcmenvm138x70.s ] shows the evolutionary courses of these calculations for a 1.38 @xmath0 wd in the @xmath39 diagram for various mass accretion rates .",
    "the orange dashed line represents the unstable branch in figure [ flash ] . after a steep decrease in @xmath14 ( and hence in the nuclear luminosity @xmath22 )",
    ", the envelope mass @xmath13 increases to the ignition mass @xmath38 , and a shell flash starts . as the shell flash sets in , the temperature @xmath14 and nuclear energy generation rate @xmath22 increase rapidly ,",
    "so the entire envelope expands .",
    "we define the ignition mass as the mass at which the temperature rises steeply in the first flash .",
    "although the ignition mass changes slightly for every flash , as shown for the @xmath40  yr@xmath2 case , the ignition mass at the first flash is sufficiently close to that of the limit cycle .",
    "this is one of the merits of starting from the equilibrium model .",
    "the ignition mass thus determined will be examined in more detail in section [ multi_cycles ] .",
    "we obtained the ignition masses @xmath38 for various sets of mass accretion rates @xmath10 and wd masses @xmath41 .",
    "the results are presented as contours of @xmath38 on the @xmath42 plane in figure [ revised_nomoto_diagram ] . for a given @xmath10 , @xmath38 is smaller for a larger @xmath41 . for a given @xmath41 ,",
    "@xmath38 is smaller for a higher @xmath10 .",
    "all the contours stop at the dashed line because above this line , hydrogen shell burning is stable , and no flashes occur ; in other words , it is the stability line for hydrogen shell burning .",
    "the stability line ( dashed line in figure [ revised_nomoto_diagram ] ) is approximately represented by @xmath43 we will discuss how the stability line is obtained in the next subsection .    the dash - dotted line in figure [ revised_nomoto_diagram ] represents the locus of the critical accretion rate @xmath44 , above which steady models have optically thick winds @xcite .",
    "this relation can be represented as @xmath45      to obtain the stability boundary of the accretion rate , we start the evolution calculations from an equilibrium model whose accretion rate lies well within the stable range .",
    "then , we decrease the accretion rate slowly until a shell flash occurs .",
    "figure[evol_m135 ] depicts examples for @xmath46 .",
    "the initial model has a mass accretion rate of @xmath47  yr@xmath2 . in the top panel , the accretion rate @xmath10",
    "is reduced to @xmath48  yr@xmath2 .",
    "the hydrogen shell burning is still stable at this accretion rate , and the nuclear luminosity @xmath22 remains nearly constant .    in the middle panel",
    ", @xmath10 is decreased to @xmath49  yr@xmath2 .",
    "the nuclear luminosity @xmath22 oscillates , but the amplitude is bounded . if @xmath10 is further decreased to @xmath50  yr@xmath2 , the nuclear luminosity @xmath22 starts decreasing , and after a certain mass is accreted , a shell flash occurs ( bottom panel ) .",
    "the stability of hydrogen shell burning changes at @xmath51  yr@xmath2 for @xmath46 .",
    "we regard this accretion rate as the boundary of stability .",
    "we note that the appearance of oscillations in @xmath22 for the models with accretion rates around the stability limit is consistent with the prediction made by @xcite from a linear stability analysis for a simplified plane - parallel one - zone model .",
    "he found that the eigenvalues of the linear analysis are always complex near the transition from stability to instability because of the similarity between the thermal and nuclear timescales , which means that the temporal variations in the perturbations are oscillatory .",
    "figure [ mmdot_compare ] compares the stability line we obtained ( black solid line ) with those of @xcite ( red dotted line ) and @xcite ( blue dashed line ) . @xcite",
    "obtained the stability line from a linear perturbation analysis of equilibrium models , whereas @xcite obtained it based on their evolution calculations .",
    "the two lines based on time evolution calculations agree well with each other , whereas that based on the linear perturbation analysis lies below them .",
    "the reason for the difference is not clear .",
    "although the linear stability analysis of @xcite includes only thermal effects , and hence only real eigenvalues are expected , @xcite showed that the monotonic thermal stability transition occurs at the same accretion rate as oscillatory instability .",
    "the difference might stem from small differences in the structures between the equilibrium models and time evolution models .",
    "now that we have obtained @xmath38 for various @xmath41 and @xmath10 , we can approximate the recurrence periods of novae . after a nova outburst sets in , the envelope mass of the wd decreases as its surface temperature increases .",
    "hydrogen burning stops at point e in figure [ flash ] when the envelope mass reaches a local minimum , @xmath52 .",
    "this hydrogen - rich matter remains unburnt until the next flash occurs ; during this time , an amount of mass equal to @xmath53 is accreted .",
    "we estimate the recurrence period as @xmath54 because the time after ignition to point e is much shorter than the accretion time .",
    "we show in section [ multi_cycles ] that the recurrence periods determined in this way are consistent with the evolution calculations of several flashes .",
    "figure [ mmdot_rtime ] shows the contours of the recurrence period on the @xmath42 plane .",

    "wolf et al .",
    "( 2013 ) and @xcite also obtained a 1 yr period for @xmath63  yr@xmath64 and ( @xmath65  yr@xmath66 . our values are consistent with these works .    for a given @xmath10 , the recurrence period is shorter for a larger @xmath41 . for a given @xmath41 , the recurrence period is shorter for a higher @xmath10 .",
    "the latter is limited by the stability line , as indicated by the dashed line in figure [ mmdot_rtime ] , which gives a lower bound of the recurrence period for a given @xmath41 .",
    "we should note that for the accretion rates as high as @xmath67  yr@xmath2 encountered here , the accreting c+o wd becomes an sn ia when @xmath41 reaches @xmath12 because carbon deflagration is ignited at the center of the wd @xcite .",
    "if the accreting wd is an o+ne+mg wd , electron capture triggers a collapse when @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the _ shortest _ recurrence period of novae is obtained for the @xmath12 wd with an accretion rate of @xmath69  yr@xmath2 , and is found to be about 2 months ( see figure [ mig_rect_1.38_x7x1 ] below ) .",
    "@xcite calculated the shell flashes for various wd masses and accretion rates . for @xmath70  yr@xmath2 with a core temperature of @xmath14 = @xmath71 k , they obtained the wd mass , accreted mass , and recurrence period as ( @xmath72 , @xmath73 , 83  yr ) , ( @xmath74 , @xmath75 , 19.6  yr ) , and ( @xmath76 , @xmath77 , 0.809  yr ) .",

    "the wd is heated by gravitational energy release due to high mass accretion rates . as a result , the wd radius ( i.e.",
    ", the bottom of the envelope ) should be slightly larger than those of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "thus , our envelope mass is larger than theirs because of the smaller surface gravity of the wd .    near the stability line",
    ", our ignition mass @xmath38 is very consistent with the results of wolf et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , as indicated by the agreement of the two stability lines in figure [ mmdot_compare ] . for high mass accretion rates ,",
    "wolf et al.s models develop a hot helium layer below the accreted hydrogen - rich envelope after the wd experiences several shell flashes .",
    "wolf et al . claimed that the presence of a hot helium layer is essential for nova outbursts of short recurrence periods because it acts as a heat reservoir even if the wd is cool .",
    "our equilibrium model has no helium layer but has a hot wd core , which is heated by compressional heating due to high mass accretion rates .",
    "for example , the maximum temperature of our @xmath72 wd model with @xmath88  yr@xmath2 reaches @xmath89 ( k)=8.07 at the outer part of the wd core , which is comparable with that of wolf et al.s helium layer .",
    "therefore , our models and wolf et al.s have a similar inner boundary condition in view of the heat reservoir at the bottom of the hydrogen - rich envelope , and thus give very consistent results .",
    "although the stability line of shell flashes in figure [ revised_nomoto_diagram ] has long been established @xcite , some numerical calculations showed repeated shell flashes for accretion rates even above the stability line @xcite . in these cases ,",
    "the recurrence period is much shorter than our minimum value , and the light curves show a very high duty cycle .",
    "for example , @xcite reported the calculation of several successive shell flashes on a @xmath76 wd with @xmath90  yr@xmath2 .",
    "the bolometric luminosity varies between @xmath91 and @xmath92 , and the bright stage lasts 10 days , almost half of the recurrence period of 20 days .",
    "@xcite obtained successive nova outbursts for a @xmath72 wd with @xmath93  yr@xmath2 .",
    "the bright stage lasts 6 yr , 60% of the total recurrence period of 10 yr . both of these calculations show a long lasting high - luminosity phase during the relatively short recurrence period",
    ". such light curves do not resemble those of recurrent novae , which show much shorter duty cycles .",
    "the accretion rate of @xmath90  yr@xmath2 corresponds to the region above the stability line in figure [ revised_nomoto_diagram ] , in which hydrogen shell burning should be stable , as discussed in section [ section_limitcycle ] ( figure [ flash ] ) . nevertheless , these papers reported successive nova outbursts .",
    "this is because they stopped accretion during the shell flashes . without a supply of hydrogen ( nuclear fuel ) ,",
    "a nova evolves toward point e in figure [ flash ] , where it immediately falls to point a. these authors then restarted accretion . after some time , the next shell flash begins , and it goes up from point b to point c. in this way , these authors switched mass accretion on and off to run the limit cycle .",
    "in other words , these outbursts are `` enforced novae , '' and it is not known whether such an on / off switch works in nova outbursts or in other accreting binaries .    figure [ evol_m135_novae_3cases ] shows examples of our numerical simulations for such enforced novae for a @xmath81 wd with @xmath94  yr@xmath2 , which is above the stability line .",
    "we show three cases for different on / off switches for mass accretion .",
    "each calculation started with about half of the equilibrium envelope mass ; therefore , the envelope underwent the first shell flash at about 0.45 yr . to avoid numerical difficulty , we assumed an artificial wind mass loss of @xmath95  yr@xmath2 when the photosphere expands greatly ( @xmath96 ) .",

    "we restarted mass accretion after the envelope fell from point e toward point a in figure [ flash ] .",
    "the envelope again underwent a shell flash ( enforced nova ) .",
    "the recurrence period was longer than in the middle panel because we delayed the restart of mass accretion . in this way",
    ", we can control the recurrence period by changing the time at which mass accretion is restarted .",
    "the above three cases clearly show that shell flashes above the stability line are just artifacts that stem from the numerical treatment of the mass accretion on / off switch .",
    "there is some indication that accretion does not stop in real binaries .",
    "when the accretion rate is between the two lines of @xmath44 and @xmath6 in figure [ revised_nomoto_diagram ] , the wd burns hydrogen at the same rate as the accretion rate and stays somewhere between points d and e in figure [ flash ] .",

    "* ) . to avoid a lengthy calculation , as the initial model we adopted the equilibrium model , which is a good approximation of the long time - averaged evolution of wds , as shown in figure [ tcmenvm138x70.s ] and also the discussion below",
    "figure [ mdot_rect_evol_rv ] shows the recurrence periods based on the ignition mass of the first flash ( filled circles ) and obtained from the last shell flash ( open squares ) after several consecutive nova outbursts .",
    "the shell flashes were calculated by assuming mass loss in the expanded stages ( section [ sec_evolution ] ) .",
    "the calculations were continued until the repetition of the flashes became nearly a limit cycle .",
    "the calculations for longer recurrence times are very difficult because the shell flashes are very strong .",
    "for this reason , the recurrence periods obtained from multicycle calculations are limited to about a thousand years .    in the range where two types of recurrence periods are available , the periods agree with each other , as seen in figure[mdot_rect_evol_rv ] .",
    "actually , these two recurrence periods agree within 10% , suggesting that our estimates of the recurrence periods based on the first - cycle ignition mass and the minimum envelope mass given in section [ min_period ] ( figure[mmdot_rtime ] ) are reasonable .",
    "the main results are summarized as follows .",
    "we calculated the ignition masses for various wd masses and mass accretion rates .",
    "we determined that the shortest recurrence period of novae is about two months for a non - rotating @xmath12 wd with a mass accretion rate of @xmath69  yr@xmath2 .",
    ". a 1 yr recurrence period of a nova is possible only for very massive wds ( @xmath110 ) and very high mass accretion rates , e.g. , @xmath111  yr@xmath2 for a @xmath112 wd , @xmath87  yr@xmath2 for a @xmath81 wd , and @xmath113  yr@xmath2 for a @xmath12 wd .",
