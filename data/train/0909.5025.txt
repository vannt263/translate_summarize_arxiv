    "galaxy clusters host an x - ray emitting hot gas with temperature of @xmath2 k , or the intracluster medium ( icm ) , as well as dark matter and galaxies .",
    "it is theoretically believed that icm has been heated up through various magnitude of shock waves caused by successive mergers of galaxies , galaxy groups and galaxy clusters during the hierarchical structure formation ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these shocks are regarded as sources of turbulent motion of icm and sites of particle acceleration .",
    "furthermore , they amplify the intracluster magnetic field and can be sources of non - thermal emission . in this sense , merging galaxy clusters are of great importance as fruitful sites of interesting phenomena of astrophysical plasma ( see @xcite for a review ) .    from an observational point of view , merging galaxy clusters provide lots of information about outskirts of galaxy clusters , because compression and shock heating of icm during merging events increase the x - ray luminosity of icm at the outer parts of galaxy clusters . for example , based on the suzaku xis observation , @xcite reported the detection of fe k emission lines in the linked region of abell 399 and abell 401 , more than @xmath3  mpc apart from the centers of both galaxy clusters , and estimated the metallicity relatively higher than conventionally expected .",
    "their detection is in virtue of the fact that icm in the linked region is significantly compressed , as well as the high sensitivity of the xis detector .",
    "therefore , merging galaxy clusters can be good sites for elucidating physical properties of icm , such as the temperature and metallicity , especially in the peripheral regions of galaxy clusters",
    ".    measurements of physical properties of icm , such as the temperature and metallicity , in x - ray observations , however , usually assume that icm is in the ionization equilibrium state , and that electrons and ions share the same thermal temperature .",
    "it is widely believed that these assumptions are reasonable inside galaxy clusters , because the timescale for collisional ionization equilibrium , @xmath4 ( for e.g. , fexxv and fexxvi in a temperature of several kev ; see also @xcite ) and the timescale for thermal equilibration between electrons and ions through coulomb scattering , @xmath5 ( @xcite ) are usually shorter than the typical dynamical timescale around the central regions of galaxy clusters , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the number density and temperature of electrons , respectively . but these timescales are not short enough compared with the merger timescale , and even longer in the outskirts of galaxy clusters where @xmath8@xmath9 .",
    "consequently , the assumptions of the ionization equilibrium and the thermal equipartition between electrons and ions are no longer justified .",
    "therefore , in measuring the temperature and/or metallicity of icm around shock layers and outskirts of merging galaxy clusters , the deviations from the ionization equilibrium and the thermal equipartition have to be taken into consideration ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "previously , many works were devoted to numerical simulations of merging galaxy clusters under idealized but well - controlled initial conditions @xcite .",
    "but most of them ignored the effects of the non - equilibrium ionization state and the deviation from thermal equipartition between electrons and ions , or the two - temperature structure of icm .",
    "the former effect in the warm  hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) is addressed in cosmological simulations for the first time by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite took into account the latter effect in numerical simulations of merging galaxy clusters for the first time , while @xcite and @xcite investigated it in whim and in outskirts of galaxy clusters , respectively , in cosmological simulations .",
    "recently , @xcite(ay08 ) carried out an n - body / sph simulation of an abell 399 and abell 401 system incorporating these two effects simultaneously and self - consistently , and showed that the non - equilibrium ionization state and the two - temperature structure of icm take place along shock layers at the merging interface .",
    "while ay08 addressed only a particular situation of abell 399 and abell 401 , in this paper , we systematically investigate the non - equilibrium ionization state and the two - temperature structure of icm for various situations of merging galaxy clusters , e.g. , mass ratios , impact parameters , and merging stages , so as to be confronted with future x - ray observations of actual merging galaxy clusters .",
    "in addition to that , we also address the viewing angle dependence of observational signatures of the deviations from the ionization equilibrium and the thermal equipartition .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we describe the numerical methods and the initial conditions of the simulations .",
    "the simulation results are presented in section 3 . in section 4 ,",
    "we summarize our conclusions and discuss future prospects for the detection of the non - equilibrium ionization state and the two - temperature structure of icm . in the case that the cosmological scaling is required , we assume the density parameter @xmath10 , the baryon density parameter @xmath11 , and the hubble constant @xmath12 km s@xmath13 mpc@xmath13 , unless otherwise specified .",
    "we carry out a set of n - body and sph simulations of merging galaxy clusters for various initial conditions . in all simulations , radiative cooling",
    "is ignored , since , in this work , we focus on relatively outer regions rather than the very central regions of galaxy clusters , and the actual cooling timescale in the central regions of the simulated icm is @xmath14  gyr , sufficiently longer than the merging timescale .",
    "simulations are performed using the code developed in the previous papers ( @xcite , @xcite , and ay08 ) , which adopts the entropy conservative formulation of sph by @xcite , and the standard monaghan - gingold artificial viscosity @xcite with balsara limiter ( @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to the standard sph prescription , the time evolution of the two - temperature structure and the non - equilibrium ionization state of icm are incorporated .    for the time evolution of the two - temperature structure ,",
    "only the coulomb scattering is considered as a physical process responsible for the thermal relaxation between electrons and ions . in this picture ,",
    "timescales on which each of electrons and ions achieves the thermal relaxation are much shorter than that between electrons and ions .",
    "therefore , electrons and ions can have different temperatures , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively , just after experiencing shock heating , because nearly all of the kinetic energy of icm is carried by ions at a shock front , and is preferentially converted to the thermal energy of ions in the post - shock regions .",
    "afterward , thermal relaxation between electrons and ions proceeds through coulomb scattering on a timescale described by @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the electron and ion masses , respectively , @xmath20 the number density of ions , @xmath21 the boltzmann constant , and @xmath22 the coulomb logarithm @xcite .    assuming that electrons and ions share the same fluid velocity , and that shock heating",
    "are exclusively contributed to the heating of ions , the energy equations for electrons and ions are given as @xmath23 @xmath24 respectively , where @xmath25 is the gas mass density , @xmath26 the specific thermal energy , @xmath27 the thermal pressure ( quantities with subscript `` e '' and `` i '' denote those of electrons and ions , respectively ) , @xmath28 the shock heating rate per unit volume , and @xmath29 the energy exchange rate per unit volume through coulomb scattering : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the adiabatic index . using equations",
    "( [ eq2energy_e ] ) and ( [ eq2energy_i ] ) , and assuming the constant mean molecular weight , @xmath32 , for almost fully ionized icm , we obtain an ordinary energy equation for mixed fluid with a mean temperature , @xmath33 , and another equation for the time evolution of electron temperature , which can be written as @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the dimensionless temperatures of electrons and ions normalized by the mean temperature , respectively , and @xmath37 . this equation is numerically solved in the same manner described in @xcite as follows .",
    "we first regard the second term on the right hand side as being negligibly small , and integrate the first term implicitly using the method described in @xcite",
    ". then we integrate the second term explicitly , and finally add this contribution to the time evolution of @xmath38 . in each integration",
    ", the time step regulated by the courant condition of sph ensures sufficiently smaller @xmath39 than unity and thus enable us to solve the evolution of @xmath38 with reasonable accuracy .",
    "actually , a possibility is argued that plasma waves are able to attain the thermal relaxation between electrons and ions more quickly than the coulomb collision . in reality",
    ", it is observationally suggested that the electron and ion temperatures are almost the same around the shock front with a mach number of @xmath40 in supernova remnants , indicating that physical processes other than coulomb collision contribute to the quick thermal relaxation between electrons and ions @xcite .",
    "there exists , however , a room for a very slow shock with a mach number of @xmath41 to have significant difference in the temperatures between electrons and ions .",
    "thus , in order to bracket the plausible range of theoretical uncertainties , we present the results both for the two - temperature runs described above and the single - temperature runs , in which thermal energies of electrons and ions are assumed to be instantaneously equilibrated , and electrons and ions share a single temperature .",
    "the time evolution of ionization fractions of ions is computed by solving the rate equation , @xmath42 for each sph particle , where @xmath43 is the index of a particular ionization stage considered , @xmath44 the atomic number , @xmath45 the ionization fraction of an ion @xmath43 , @xmath46 the ionization rate of an ion @xmath43 with the ejection of @xmath47 electrons , and @xmath48 is the recombination rate of an ion @xmath43 .",
    "the ionization processes include collisional , auger , charge - transfer , and photo - ionizations , and recombination processes are composed of radiative and dielectronic recombinations .",
    "the ionization and recombination rates are calculated by utilizing the spex ver 1.10 software package .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : noneq ] ) is integrated implicitly in the same manner described in @xcite , in which ionization fractions of all ionic species are sequentially updated in the order of increasing ionization states rather than being updated simultaneously , and the source terms contributed by the ionization from and recombination to the lower states are evaluated at the advanced time step . in the two - temperature runs ,",
    "the reaction rates are computed using the electron temperature , @xmath7 , calculated from equation  ( [ eq : eq2 t ] ) so as to incorporate the effect of the two - temperature structure . as for the single - temperature runs ,",
    "the reaction rates are computed using the mean temperature , @xmath49 .",
    "we solve the time evolution of the ionization fractions of h , he , c , n , o , ne , mg , si , s , and fe ; total 112 ionization states for each sph particle .",
    "all the ionization states are considered in calculations of the x - ray spectrum and the surface brightness in this paper .",
    "but in the following , we mainly focus on the ionization fraction and the line intensities of fe , because the line emissions of fe are the most prominent in the typical temperature range of icm @xmath2  k.      the initial conditions are setup as follows .",
    "we adopt the nfw density profile @xcite for a dark matter halo , and the @xmath50-model density profile @xcite with @xmath51 for a icm component . the scale radius of the nfw profile is set to @xmath52 , and",
    "the core radius of the @xmath50-model is @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the virial radius defined as the radius within which the mean cluster mass density is 200 times the present cosmic critical density .",
    "the radial profiles of velocity dispersion of dark matter and temperature of icm are computed using jeans equation and the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium , respectively .",
    "the gas and dark matter particles are distributed out to @xmath55 , which enables us to follow the dynamical evolution of icm at outskirts of galaxy clusters .    in this paper , mass ratios of two galaxy clusters",

    "therefore , dark matter halos at @xmath86 have already passed each other .    in the early stage of the merging ( @xmath84  gyr ) ,",
    "the outskirts of the two galaxy clusters interact with each other , and then form the linked regions where icm is compressed due to the collision . at the edges of the linked regions , there exist shock layers with a mach number of 1.52.0 ( white contour in the top panels of figure  [ fig : result1_1 t ] ) .",
    "these shocks are immediately generated at the contact interface of the two clusters when the clusters start to collide , then propagate to outside of each cluster .",
    "the emergence of these shocks at the outskirts of galaxy clusters is also pointed out by ay08 , but not clearly seen in the previous sph simulations ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this is because , in these previous studies , density profiles of icm are truncated in the outside of clusters ( @xmath87 ) , and also because these studies adopt isothermal temperature profiles of icm at the start of the simulations . on the contrary , in the present study , the distributions of icm are extended out to @xmath88 , and the icm temperature decreases toward outside as suggested by recent x - ray observations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the sound speed at the outskirts of galaxy clusters , which is typically @xmath89 for a gas temperature of @xmath90 , is lower than the relative velocity ( @xmath0700800  @xmath91 ) of the two clusters at this stage , resulting in the formation of the shock waves .    at the middle stage of the merging ( @xmath92@xmath93 ) ,",
    "another shock waves with a mach number of 1.52.0 in front of the icm density peaks emerge , because the dense cores of icm are accelerated by the preceding dark matter halos , and they have mach numbers of @xmath034 and 23 at the late stage of the merging ( @xmath94 ) in the case of 1:1 and 4:1 mass ratios , respectively . since the shock waves formed in front of the icm cores are faster than the ones formed in the outskirts at the early stage , the former overtake and merge with the latter , as can be seen in the bottom panels of figure  [ fig : result1_1 t ] .",

    "therefore , in the rest of this work , we mainly focus on the ionization fractions of fexxv and fexxvi to address the degree of the deviation from the ionization equilibrium in icm .",
    "in addition , we introduce the `` ionization temperature '' , @xmath96 , the temperature at which given ionization fractions of fexxv and fexxvi are realized in the ionization equilibrium state to characterize the ionization state of icm .",
    "note that @xmath96 monotonically increases with the ratio of abundances of fexxvi relative to fexxv , and differs from @xmath49 if these ions are not in the ionization equilibrium state .",
    "thus , the difference between @xmath96 and @xmath49 can be used as a measure of the deviation from the ionization equilibrium state .",
    "considering the situation where icm is shock - heated from a few kev to higher temperature , @xmath96 is lower than @xmath49 just after the shock heating since the ionization from fexxv to fexxvi is not quick enough to catch up with the ionization equilibrium .",

    "the over - population of fexxv fraction at the shocks in the outskirts and in front of the icm cores described above can be understood as follows . in these regions ,",
    "the shock heating increases the icm temperature from @xmath105  kev to the higher temperature , so that the fexxv fraction in the post - shock regions declines with time toward the equilibrium fraction because the fexxv fraction is maximum at @xmath106  kev in the ionization equilibrium state ( see figure  [ fig : ionfrac ] ) .",
    "however , the ionization of fexxv toward higher ",
    "ionized states is not quick enough to catch up with the ionization equilibrium state .",

    "since the ionization and recombination rates in equation  ( [ eq : noneq ] ) depend on the electron temperature , the ionization states at the shocks in the two - temperature runs are altered from the results in the single - temperature runs in which the ionization and recombination rates are computed using the mean temperature of icm , @xmath49 .",

    "this excess of the fexxv fraction can be understood by the facts that the ionization processes at the shock layers are not quick enough to achieve the ionization equilibrium instantaneously and that the ionization state there differs from the equilibrium state for a while after experiencing the shock heating .",
    "furthermore , in the two - temperature runs , the electron temperature at the shock layers are remarkably lower than the mean temperature of icm , and thus the deviation from the ionization equilibrium state is more significant than that in the single - temperature runs , because the ionization processes at the shock layers are retarded due to the lower temperature of electrons .    from the observational point of view",
    ", the deviation from the ionization equilibrium can be identified by the difference between intensity ratios of fe k@xmath1 line emissions and that inferred from the icm temperature estimated by the x - ray continuum spectra .",
    "we find that the ratio , @xmath119 , can be a good tracer of such a deviation from the ionization equilibrium .",
    "we also find that the appearance of such observational imprints of the non - equilibrium ionization state is very sensitive to the viewing angle of the merging galaxy clusters to the observers .",
    "@xmath119 is the largest if the merging galaxy clusters are observed along the line of sight perpendicular to the collision plane of the two clusters , because the shock layers are geometrically thin and are parallel to the line of sight . on the other hand ,",
    "the significance of such imprints is weaker in the case of a viewing angle of 30 degrees , and almost negligible in the case of 60 degrees .",
    "it is found that jumps of the spectroscopic - like ( projected ) temperature and the x - ray surface brightness across the shock fronts also depend on the viewing angle , and that the mach numbers estimated from the jumps of the observed temperature could be also underestimated in the case of a finite viewing angle .",
    "while we concentrate only on the ionization state of fe so far , detections of the deviation from the ionization equilibrium of other heavy elements could provide independent information on physical properties of shock waves . among heavy elements other than fe",
    ", si is the most interesting from the observational point of view because the emission lines of sixiii - xiv at a photon energy of @xmath124  kev are relatively prominent .",
    "actually , at the shocks in the outskirts the ionization fraction of sixiv is 1.21.5 and 1.22.0 times larger than that in the ionization equilibrium state in the single- and two - temperature runs , respectively .",
    "since the ionization fraction of si  xiv in the ionization equilibrium is maximum at a temperature of @xmath125  k , and almost fully ionized at higher temperature , the observational signatures of the deviation from the ionization equilibrium could be seen in the outskirts rather than in the central regions of galaxy clusters .    with the current x - ray observational facilities , the separate detection of emission lines of fe  xxv and fe  xxvi , or",
    "the measurement of the ratio @xmath119 is still difficult because of a lack of the spectroscopic resolution of the ccds .",
    "therefore , spectroscopic analyses to estimate the metallicity of icm with the assumption that icm is in the ionization equilibrium state can lead to a biased result .",
    "a good spectroscopic resolution is also crucial to estimate the temperatures of electrons and ions separately , because the ion temperature is only estimated from the detailed line profiles of emission lines , while the electron temperature can be relatively easily estimated from the x - ray continuum spectra .",
    "thus , the precision spectroscopy in x - ray observations is of crucial importance in studying the non - equilibrium ionization state and the two - temperature structure of icm , and can be achieved by x - ray calorimeters on board future satellites such as astro - h and international x - ray observatory .",
