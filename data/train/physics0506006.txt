    "since the pioneering work of e. yablonovitch @xcite and s. john @xcite , research on photonic crystals(pcs ) has enjoyed a nearly exponential increase . the manufacture of pcs at the optical regime has become a reality @xcite .",
    "manufacturing brings with it the practical reality of random errors introduced during the manufacturing process and it is the effect of these random errors on the desirable features of pcs , namely photonic band gaps , that we wish to address in this paper .",
    "bandgaps in pcs depend on two crucial properties : an infinite _ and _ perfect translational symmetry .",
    "clearly , in real life no crystal is infinite in size or perfectly periodic .",
    "when randomness is introduced in the geometry of the pc , one quantity of interest is the size of the bandgaps as the level of randomness is increased , and whether the bandgaps of the bulk perfect pc will survive the randomness .",
    "same considerations apply for a _ finite _ pc .",
    "in fact , even for a perfect but finite pc , one needs to give up the notion of a bandgap and has to be content with severe depressions in transmittance instead . in this paper",
    ", we will consider both finite imperfect pcs by examining the dependence of their transmittance on randomness , and bulk imperfect pcs by determining their density of states ( dos ) under varying degrees of randomness , using the supercell method .",
    "although much has been done @xcite regarding imperfect two- and three - dimensional pcs , we feel that a study of the problem for one - dimensional pcs is warranted because of the inherent simplicity of the geometry and because a variety of extremely accurate mathematical tools are readily available which allow a detailed study of the problem without having to compromise accuracy .",
    "for instance , because the electric field and its first derivative are continuous across the interface , and because of the low dimensionality of the pc , the convergence problem that plagued band structure calculations for many 3d pcs @xcite is essentially non - existent for 1d structures .",
    "thus , we were able to use the old trusted plane wave ( pw ) method to find the band structure and the dos for supercell sizes not even imaginable in three- or even two - dimensional supercell calculations @xcite .",
    "one can obtain better than 0.1% convergence with as few as @xmath130 plane waves per unit cell in the supercell .",
    "the transmission coefficient , too , can be calculated for nearly arbitrary supercell sizes .",
    "finally , one can calculate the band structure and the imaginary part of the wave vector using a semi - analytical approach for very large supercells .",
    "the 1d pc is , in many ways , the  infinite square - well \" problem of photonic crystals .",
    "it contains the essential features of its bigger cousins in two and three dimensions without the mathematical complexities and the accompanying numerical uncertainties @xcite that can sometimes overshadow the essentials .",
    "for example , with 3d face centered cubic structures , it becomes practically impossible , due to convergence problems , to increase the supercell size beyond @xmath2 ( or at most @xmath3 ) conventional cubic unit cells which contain only 32 primitive cells per supercell ( or 108 ) , since typically at least @xmath4 terms per primitive cell are necessary to ensure sufficient convergence for inverse opal structures .",
    "it s not obvious from the start whether a randomness analysis with such small supercell sizes would yield results that are physically meaningful .",
    "artifacts due to the small supercell size are bound to be inextricably intertwined with the physically significant bulk features of the imperfect pc .",
    "it s important to realize that , with the supercell method one still calculates the bands of an infinite _ perfect _ pc .",
    "the randomness is only _ within _ the supercell , but on a global scale , it s still a perfectly periodic structure ! in order to be able to resolve the supercell artifacts from the physical features brought about by randomness , one needs to ensure that the interaction between neighboring supercells , which , to a good approximation , is proportional to the surface area of the supercell , be small compared to the bulk properties of the imperfect pc , which can be taken to be proportional to the volume of the supercell .",
    "hence , on purely dimensional grounds , one can argue that the surface to volume ratio of the supercell @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the linear size of the supercell , should be small compared to the typical length scale of the problem , namely the wavelength of the bandgap .",
    "we allowed the supercell size @xmath7 to vary from @xmath8 to @xmath9 , and one can clearly see the supercell artifacts gradually diminishing while the bulk features become more prominent in the limit as @xmath10 . on the other hand , 1d structures can have features , such as a bandgap for any geometry and any refractive index contrast , that are certainly not shared by 2d or 3d pcs .",
    "the precise distribution of randomness in the geometry of a pc would surely depend on the details of the specific manufacturing process . in the interest of simplicity , we chose the simplest distribution , the uniform distribution , in our study .",
    "as the unit cell , we chose a unit  supercell \" that consisted of up to @xmath11 unit cells .",
    "the thicknesses of the layers were perturbed by a given percent , by adding random numbers chosen from a uniform distribution . as the unperturbed structure , we chose the quarter - wave stack that has , for a given dielectric contrast , the largest relative gap between the first and the second bands , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ gapvsf ] . in",
    "what follows , we will consider this structure with a dielectric contrast of 13 as our perfect pc .    the relative gap width vs the filling ratio @xmath12 for a 1d pc made of slabs of alternating dielectric constant of @xmath13 and @xmath14 . the lowest gap has a maximum for @xmath15 , which is the quarter - wave stack value . for this value of @xmath12 , the even numbered gaps , the 2nd , 4th , etc , which are n general nonzero for an arbitrary value of @xmath12 are all closed.,width=226 ]    for 1d pcs , one further has the luxury of calculating the bandgaps using an analytical method@xcite",
    "this approach also permits the calculation of the imaginary part of the wave vector in the forbidden gap region and allows a reliable assessment of the accuracy of the plane wave method for the problem at hand .",
    "we also investigated the transmission coefficient for a @xmath16 unit cell quarter - wave stack structure .",
    "the transmission coefficient was calculated by simply matching the boundary conditions for the electric and the magnetic fields at each interface between the slabs in the multilayer structure .",
    "maxwell s equations for waves propagating in the @xmath17 direction in a medium with a dielectric constant @xmath18 that depends only on @xmath17 , can be reduced to @xmath19 where @xmath20 is parallel to the slabs . with @xmath18 periodic along @xmath17 with lattice constant @xmath21 , and translationally invariant along @xmath22 and @xmath23 , @xmath24 where @xmath25 , is a reciprocal lattice vector with @xmath26 , and @xmath27",
    "can be written as @xmath28 where @xmath29 . for a given @xmath30 ,",
    "this yields an @xmath31-dimensional generalized eigenproblem @xmath32 or by multiplying both sides from the left by @xmath33 , one obtains the ordinary eigenproblem @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is the inverse of the matrix @xmath38 . for a given value of @xmath30 , a truncation of this @xmath31-dimensional ordinary eigenvalue problem yields , by retaining only the @xmath39-vectors with @xmath40 , the band structure @xmath41 and the modes @xmath42 .",
    "we choose a structure where the dielectric constant alternates between two values @xmath43 and @xmath44 each with thickness @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "the choice of the lattice constant @xmath47 is not unique .",
    "although the choice @xmath47 is the most obvious and the most convenient , the lattice constant can be chosen as any integer multiple of @xmath48 , @xmath49 . with a choice for @xmath50 with @xmath51 , and following the same formalism",
    "one can write @xmath52 and @xmath53 where @xmath54 , with @xmath26 and @xmath55 .",
    "clearly , to get results with the same level of accuracy as before , _",
    "i.e. _ with @xmath56 , one would now need to include @xmath7 times as many plane waves in the expansion , which simply increases the computational burden , both in terms of storage and computing time .        the band structure for @xmath57 and @xmath16",
    "are displayed in fig [ folding ] for a perfect pc .",
    "i the folding of the bands in the first brilloin zone for each @xmath7 , makes the appearance of the bands rather different for each case , although the dos and the eigenfunctions @xmath20 would be independent of the choice of the supercell size .",
    "the frequency is plotted in units of @xmath58 for all cases , so the frequency scale is not affected with the result that the bandgaps are at the same frequency , as would be expected . to calculate the dos",
    ", we choose a uniform mesh in @xmath30-space to calculate the bands and then choose a small frequency window , @xmath59 , and count the number of modes whose frequencies fall within that window .",
    "we add random perturbations to the thicknesses of the layers in the supercell such that @xmath60\\ ] ] where @xmath61 are the unperturbed values of the thicknesses of the layers , _",
    "i.e. _ the quarter - wave stack values , @xmath62 is a uniformly distributed random number in the interval @xmath63 .",
    "we control the amount of disorder by varying the percent randomness parameter @xmath64 between 0 and 1 .",
    "@xmath65 corresponds to perfectly periodic structures , and @xmath66 corresponds to @xmath67 fluctuation where @xmath45 , @xmath46 can range between @xmath68 and twice their unperturbed values .",
    "when disorder is introduced , gaps appear between every fold for @xmath69 .     the upper and lower band edges for the lowest three gaps calculated with a supercell of size @xmath70 , as a function of the disorder parameter @xmath64.,width=264 ]    in fig .",
    "[ gapedgevsp ] we plot the upper and lower limits for the lowest three bandgaps as a function of @xmath64 , the percent randomness with a supercell size of @xmath70 .",
    "note that since for quarter - wave stack structures the even numbered gaps are closed , the bandgaps in this figure are in fact the first , third and the fifth bandgaps of a 1d pc with arbitrary values for the layer thicknesses .",
    "the third gap centered at @xmath71 closes around @xmath72 , the second gap centered at @xmath73 closes around @xmath74 , and the lowest gap centered at @xmath75 closes around @xmath76 .",
    "the ratios of the critical values of randomness @xmath77 agree well with the ratios of the corresponding center gap frequencies , @xmath78 .",
    "this can be understood using the simple argument that when the random fluctuations in the thicknesses of the layers become comparable to the wavelength of the gap center , the bandgap disappears since the destructive interference responsible for the existence of the forbidden band depends on the long range periodicity at that scale .            as discussed in detail in ref@xcite , for @xmath79 dielectric layers with thicknesses @xmath80 , with dieletric constants @xmath81 , for a given @xmath82",

    "the advantage of the exact method is that the supercell size @xmath7 can be increased to values that are practically impossible using the pw method .",
    "while with the pw method , using 30 plane waves per unit cell of the supercell , the memory requirements scale as @xmath96 , and the time requirements scale as @xmath97 , the exact method requires a very small amount of memory .",

    "if the bands are nearly flat , as is the case for very large supercell sizes , then one needs to sample the frequency interval of interest in very tiny increments in @xmath82 in order to  catch \" a propagating mode .",
    "thus the computation time can become very large . also for large values of @xmath7",
    ", the transfer matrix @xmath100 can have very large elements so one requires very high precision in order to calculate the transmission resonance frequencies .",
    "we used quadruple precision ( 128-bit ) floating point variables and functions in the intel fortran compiler in order to be able to resolve the transmission resonances for supercell sizes up to @xmath101 . for large values of @xmath7 , even 128-bit precision is not sufficient , with the result that @xmath99 can not be made to completely vanish due to insufficient precision . nevertheless , the propagating modes appear as sharp cusps in the @xmath99 vs @xmath82 graph which can easily be identified ( fig .",

    "however , compared to compiled code , mathematica is slower by several orders of magnitude , so we had to stop at around @xmath103 .    the dependence of @xmath104 on @xmath7 for different values of the randomness parameter @xmath64 for the center gap frequency of the first gap , @xmath105 .",
    ", width=196 ]    to understand the _ bulk _ features of imperfect pcs using the supercell method , one would need a large supercell , in fact the larger the better .",
    "as the supercell size is increased , small bandgaps begin to appear over regions that used to have propagating modes .",
    "one would normally expect the gaps of the perfect crystal to gradually shrink in size , rather than have _ more _ gaps , so this result seems somewhat puzzling at first sight .",

    "we display the behavior of @xmath99 as @xmath7 is increased . as @xmath7 becomes larger what used to be a photonic bandgap becomes more and more populated with transmission resonances , and the forbidden gap edges gradually approach each other , narrowing the gap .",
    "it s possible that as @xmath106 , the whole bandgap region will be populated , albeit extremely sparsely , and instead of the bandgap , we will have a region where the dos is extremely small  but non - zero nevertheless .",
    "we were able to increase up to @xmath107 and the bandgap was reduced as @xmath7 became larger , although the decrease for very large @xmath7 values was very small . to actually see the gap narrow even more",

    "clearly in the bandgap regions of the perfect pc , the density of these transmission resonances is extremely small , and these regions still appear to be bandgaps with a large , but still finite , supercell .",
    "hence , it seems plausible to conclude that one can not speak of a  true bandgap \" for imperfect pcs , but only of large depressions in the dos , which , in practice , would serve the same purpose as _ bona fide _ bandgaps .",
    "for instance , for a cavity made of an  impurity \" embedded in a pc , localized cavity modes would eventually leak out through the pc  walls \" of finite thickness , regardless of how perfect the pc walls are , bacause of the finite thickness of the walls .",
    "for such an application , what is important is that the lifetime of the cavity mode be much larger than the relevant time scale .",
    "since the lifetime of the cavity mode is a function of the transmittance , for a given value of transmittance , one would simply need to use thicker walls as the random perturbations are increased .",
    "practical applications must necessarily use finite sized pcs , and for such structures , a quantity of more relevance is the transmittance .",
    "we calculate the transmittance by considering a pc of @xmath7 unit cells , and each layer is perturbed as described earlier .",
    "the transmission coefficient is calculated by imposing the boundary conditions for @xmath20 @xmath112 , @xmath113 , and @xmath114 at each layer boundary ( figure [ transfig ] ) .",
    "this yields a set of @xmath115 linear equations for the unknowns @xmath116 . setting the incident field @xmath117 , and assuming vacuum dielectric values for the incident and transmitted fields , @xmath118 , one obtains , @xmath119 and @xmath120 for the reflection and transmission coefficients , respectively .",
    "alternatively , one could also obtain @xmath121 and @xmath122 from the transfer matrix as detailed in ref .",
    "@xcite but with our approach , we can also obtain the @xmath123 within each layer .",
    "for a given frequency in the gap region , the dependence of @xmath104 on the number of layers @xmath7 is approximately linear for all values of the randomness parameter @xmath64 , as is the case @xcite for the perfectly periodic finite crystal ( fig .",
    "[ lntvsn ] ) .",
    "however , depending on the level of randomness @xmath104 can change by many orders of magnitude . in practice",
    ", this would mean that in order to obtain a given value of transmittance using an imperfect pc , one would now have to use a thicker pc .",
    "although there is a strong relationship between the transmittance of a finite imperfect pc , and the modes of the superlattice formed by choosing the same exact finite pc as the unit supercell , this relationship is not perfect in the sense that the existence of a propagating mode does not necessarily imply a large value for @xmath122 .",
    "conversely , the existence of a bandgap does not necessarily imply a low value for the transmittance @xmath122 .",
    "a close examination of the @xmath104 and @xmath99 vs @xmath82 plots in fig [ lntkivsw ] will reveal that , on a large scale , the transmission has a dip where @xmath99 is large , and when @xmath99 is small the transmittance is nearly unity .",
    "however , a closer look at a finer scale in fig .",
    "[ lntkivsw ] , one sees that @xmath104 can still be not as large as what one might expect from @xmath99",
    ".    looking at the plots of @xmath104 vs @xmath99 fig .",
    "[ lntkivsw ] , one could argue that @xmath99 sets an upper limit for @xmath104 .",
    "this upper limit seems to be a linearly decreasing function of @xmath99 . that the actual value of @xmath104 can fluctuate below a particular value for a given @xmath99",
    "can be understood if one considers the coupling of the incident plane wave to the modes inside the pc .",
    "if , owing to the randomness , the propagating mode happens to have a small amplitude near @xmath124 , it will not be transmitted effectively .",
    "similar coupling problems were reported by robertson _",
    "@xcite for 2d pcs .",
    "we studied the behavior of the photonic band gap and the transmittance for an imperfect pc using the supercell method combined with both the plane wave method and the analytical method .",
    "we also studied the transmittance for an imperfect finite 1d photonic crystal and have shown that the results we obtain in all cases are consistent .",
    "the bandgaps of the perfect pc are replaced by a dos that is extremely small to be detected even with extremely large supercells that consist of over 32000 unit cells .",
    "the higher frequency bandgaps disappear first with the lowest gap closing at around a randomness level of @xmath125 .",
