    "detailed understanding of the spectroscopy of orbitally excited heavy mesons containing a @xmath2 or a @xmath3 quark provides important information regarding the underlying theory .",
    "a flavor - spin symmetry arises from the fact that the mass of a heavy quark @xmath4 is large relative to @xmath5 . in this approximation ,",
    "the spin @xmath6 of the heavy quark @xmath4 is conserved in the interactions , independently of the total angular momentum @xmath7 of the light quark @xmath8 .",
    "corrections to this symmetry are a series expansion in @xmath9 , calculable in heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) @xcite .    .",

    "mesons are fully reconstructed in the decay chain @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "high momentum @xmath15 together with short decay lengths are selected to obtain @xmath16 enriched samples whereas b and d meson vertexing is used to select @xmath17 enriched samples .",
    "table  [ tab : ddstar ] shows the results for the  production fractions measured by opal , delphi , and aleph@xcite .",
    "delphi has also presented a new @xmath1 analysis@xcite . in semileptonic events , the decay chain @xmath13 , @xmath18 is fully reconstructed .",
    "the @xmath19 candidates are then combined with opposite sign @xmath20 and the @xmath21 mass , shown in fig .  [",

    "[ fig : ddstarlnu]b ) , allows to extract the following branching fraction @xmath25 where the signal comprises narrow and wide  resonances plus non - resonant @xmath21 combinations .",
    "these results are in agreement with previous lep and cleo measurements .",
    "delphi has recently reported an excess of events in the @xmath26 mass spectrum as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dstarpr]a)@xcite .",
    "the fit yields @xmath27 events , corresponding to a production rate @xmath28 , a mass @xmath29   and a width consistent with the experimental resolution .",
    "this mass value is consistent with predictions of a radial excited  meson .",
    "opal has performed a similar analysis@xcite . the resulting @xmath26 mass spectrum is shown in fig .  [ fig : dstarpr]b ) for data and monte carlo events , where a delphi - like signal has been added in the simulation .",
    "no excess is seen in the data ( @xmath30 at 95 % cl ) corresponding to a limit on the production rate of @xmath31 at 95 % cl , thus not confirming the delphi result .",
    "cleo also has examined their @xmath26 mass spectrum and does not confirm the delphi evidence@xcite .",
    "i wish to thank my colleagues from the other lep collaborations for providing me with the results and the figure files .",
    "i also thank s. goldfarb for his help when preparing this presentation .",
