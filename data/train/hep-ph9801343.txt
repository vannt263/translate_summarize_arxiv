    "_ flavourdynamics _ , the study off the electroweak lagrangian and its implications , is one of the central areas of research in particle physics . for example , in the united kingdom the _ mission statement _ of the particle physics community , as defined by our research council , is to obtain insights into the following three fundamental questions :    * the origin of mass , * the 3 generations of elementary particles and their weak asymmetries , * and * the nature of dark matter .",
    "the second of these topics is flavourdynamics , which is the subject of this lecture course .",
    "i will review the theoretical and experimental work being done in an attempt to determine the parameters of the standard model ( sm ) accurately , to test subtle properties of the sm and to define and search for signatures of _ new physics_. although this primarily involves weak interactions , the major theoretical difficulty in interpreting experimental data on weak hadronic processes is controlling the non - perturbative strong interaction effects necessarily present in these decays .",
    "for this reason any review of flavour physics must contain a discussion also of these qcd effects , and much of the presentation below concerns this subject .    in the next few years much of the effort of the experimental community will be concerned with trying to gain an understanding of @xmath0-violation . indeed , one of the sakharov conditions for generating a matter - antimatter asymmetry in the universe in the big - bang cosmology is the requirement for the existence of @xmath0-violation .",
    "the existence of three generations of quarks and leptons , and hence of a complex phase in the mixing matrix , implies the presence of @xmath0-violation at some level .",
    "very little is known , however , about the value of this phase and hence of the magnitude of @xmath0-violation induced by this mechanism , and also about other possible sources .",
    "it is hoped that the intensive studies , which are about to begin will significantly further our understanding and this will be one of the main topics of discussion towards the end of this lecture course .",
    "the program for the four lectures is as follows :",
    "1 .   the first lecture will be an introduction to weak decays in the standard model . among the topics which will be covered",
    "will be charged and neutral currents , the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix and unitarity triangles , parity and charge conjugation symmetries , effective hamiltonians and operator product expansions and the heavy quark effective theory .",
    "2 .   in the second lecture",
    "i will review the determination of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 matrix elements from semileptonic decays of @xmath3-mesons .",
    "lattice computations , which provide the opportunity to evaluate non - perturbative strong interaction effects in weak decays in general , are introduced in this lecture .",
    "the third lecture will contain a review of @xmath4-@xmath5 and @xmath6-@xmath7 mixing .",
    "finally , in the last lecture i review @xmath0-violation in @xmath3-decays and the subject of inclusive @xmath3-decays .",
    "the theoretical framework introduced in these lectures will be applied to several important physical processes .",
    "it will not be possible , however , to discuss the full range of interesting processes which are providing , or will provide , fundamental physical information . a much larger set of physical quantities is considered in detail in the beautiful review by buras and fleischer  @xcite , to which i refer the student , and from which i will quote extensively .",

    "i briefly introduce the main features of the hqet , which will be used in the following lectures .",
    "consider the propagator of a ( free ) heavy quark :    ( 0,10)(100,50 ) ( 10,50)(70,50)(40,45)[t]@xmath73 ( 80,50)[l]@xmath176 .    if the momentum of the quark @xmath73 is not far from its mass shell , @xmath177 where @xmath178 and @xmath179 is the ( relativistic ) four velocity of the hadron containing the heavy quark ( @xmath180 ) , then    ( 0,10)(100,50 ) ( 10,50)(70,50)(40,45)[t]@xmath73 ( 80,50)[l]@xmath181 .",
    "@xmath182 is a projection operator , projecting out the _ large _ components of the spinors .",
    "this propagator can be obtained from the gauge - invariant action @xmath183 where @xmath184 is the spinor field of the heavy quark  ) . ] .",
    "@xmath185 is independent of @xmath175 , which implies the existence of symmetries relating physical quantities corresponding to different heavy quarks ( in practice the @xmath88 and @xmath74 quarks ) .",
    "the light degrees of freedom are also not sensitive to the spin of the heavy quark , which leads to a spin - symmetry relating physical properties of heavy hadrons of different spins .",
    "consider , for example , the correlation function : @xmath186 where @xmath187 ( @xmath188 ) is an interpolating operator which can create a heavy hadron @xmath189 , which we take to be a pseudoscalar or vector meson .",
    "the hadron is produced at rest , with four velocity @xmath190 .",
    "we can use the interpolating operator @xmath191 for the pseudoscalar meson and @xmath192 ( @xmath193 ) for the vector meson .",
    "this means that the correlation function will be identical in the two cases except for the factor @xmath194 when @xmath189 is a pseudoscalar meson , and @xmath195 when it is a vector meson .",
    "since the correlation functions behave with time as @xmath196 , this implies that the pseudoscalar and vector mesons are degenerate , up to relative corrections of @xmath197 : @xmath198 where @xmath199 and @xmath200 are the masses of the pseudoscalar and vector mesons respectively , or equivalently @xmath201 this relation is reasonably well satisfied experimentally : @xmath202 which is encouraging .",
    "however , i also mention in passing that the light mesons , to which the hqet certainly does not apply , also satisfy these relations numerically : @xmath203    the usefulness of the hqet does not lie in the fact that the _ residual _ momenta @xmath155 are always much smaller than @xmath204 ; indeed this is not true , in qcd one does have hard gluons with arbitrarily large momenta .",
    "however the effects of hard gluons can be evaluated in perturbation theory .",
    "the non - perturbative strong interaction effects are the same in qcd and in the hqet ( up to corrections of @xmath205 , which for the moment we neglect ) , and so the hqet relations , such as that between the decay constants of pseudoscalar and vector mesons , which can be deduced from the above proportionality of correlation functions , are violated only by perturbatively calculable corrections .",
    "the principal application of the hqet is in @xmath88-physics , and to a lesser extent to charm physics . in both cases",
    "the corrections of @xmath205 are significant , and hence one would like to compute these corrections . in practice , this gets progressively more difficult , and it is a much debated point as to whether even the first corrections ( i.e. those of @xmath205 relative to the leading terms ) have been reliably calculated for any interesting quantity .",
    "in this lecture i will discuss exclusive semileptonic decays of @xmath3-mesons , in which the @xmath88-quark decays into a @xmath74- or @xmath68-quark , and from which one can determine the @xmath1 and @xmath2 elements of the ckm - matrix .",

    "i end these lectures by summarising the _ tourist guide _ of buras and fleischer  @xcite to different processes , in which stars are awarded to the processes depending on the level of theoretical uncertainty .    1",
    ".   these are processes in which there are _ no _ theoretical uncertainties i.e. they are particularly small ( less than 2% say ) . among these",
    "is the mixing - induced @xmath0-violating asymmetry in @xmath650 discussed in section  [ subsubsec : cpvneutral ] , from which we expect to determine the angle @xmath24 of the unitarity triangle .",
    "other quantities in this category which i have not had time to discuss include the ratio of ( inclusive ) branching ratios @xmath651 from which one would obtain @xmath652 and the decays @xmath653 ( which would give im@xmath654 ) and @xmath655 ( which would give @xmath656 ) . for the kaon",
    "decays i have explained in section  [ subsubsec : sinthetac ] , that the small mass difference between the quarks in the @xmath70 and @xmath71 mesons implies that the hadronic uncertainties are small .",
    "2 .   the processes in this category have _ small _ hadronic uncertainties , of the order of 5 - 10% say .",
    "they include the evaluation of @xmath1 discussed in sec .",
    "[ subsec : vcb ] , @xmath657 discussed in section  [ subsec : bbar ] ( from which we obtain @xmath652 ) and the mixing - induced @xmath0-asymmetry in @xmath658 ( from which we would obtain the angle @xmath59 ) discussed in section  [ subsubsec : cpvneutral ] . there is a large set of other mixing - induced asymetries in this category , yielding , in principle , all three angles .",
    "being perhaps a little optimistic , the determination of @xmath659 in inclusive decays , also belongs to this category .",
    "3 .   the processes in this category have _ smallish _ hadronic uncertainties , perhaps in the region of 15% or so . of the quantities discussed in this course , @xmath660 , @xmath649 ( section  [ subsec : bbar ] ) and @xmath403 ( section  [ subsubsec : epsilon ] ) belong in this category .",
    "4 .   as we have seen in these lectures , there are also important quantities for which the theoretical uncertainties are too large for the experimental data to give accurate information about the parameters of the standard model ( and hence these quantities are not ascribed any stars ) , but which nevertheless give interesting qualitative information .",
    "these include @xmath370 ( discussed in section  [ subsubsec : deltai12 ] ) and most @xmath0-asymmetries in decays of charged @xmath3 s .",
    "non - leptonic decays of @xmath3-mesons in general belong to this category .",
    "of course it is to be hoped and expected that theoretical progress will continue , and that the interesting physical quantities will gradually acquire more stars .",
    "the theoretical community is working very hard to achieve this .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank the students , lecturers and organisers of this school for providing such a lively and stimulating atmosphere .",
    "it was very thought - provoking and instructive to respond to the many excellent questions from the students without being able to rely on an armoury of theoretical formalism .",
    "i warmly acknowledge my collaborators , particularly , guido martinelli and matthias neubert , with whom i learned many of the topics discussed in these lectures .",
    "i am grateful to giulia de divitiis and luigi del debbio for their comments on the manuscript .",
