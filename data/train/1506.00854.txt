    "the first galaxies are believed to have formed within the first 300 - 400 myr of the universe and great strides have been made towards identifying objects within this era . since the installation of the wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) instrument on the hubble space telescope ( hst ) , an increasing number of candidates have been identified by means of their photometric properties , with @xmath5700 probable galaxies identified at @xmath217 - 8 ( @xcite : see also @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and another 10 - 15 candidates identified even further out at @xmath219 - 11 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "one of the most interesting questions to investigate with these large samples is the build - up and evolution of galaxies .",
    "while these issues have long been explored in the context of fainter galaxies through the evolution of the @xmath22 lf , less progress has been made in the study of the most luminous galaxies due to the large volumes that must be probed to effectively quantify their evolution .",
    "the entire enterprise of finding especially bright galaxies at @xmath9 has been limited by the availability of sufficiently deep , multi - wavelength near - infrared data over wide areas of the sky .",
    "the most noteworthy such data sets are the ukidss uds program ( lawrence et al .",
    "2007 ) , the ultravista program ( mccracken et al .  2012 ) , the 902-orbit candels program from the hubble space telescope ( grogin et al .  2011",
    "; koekemoer et al .  2011 ) , the borg / hippies pure - parallel data set ( trenti et al .  2011 ; yan et al .  2011 ; bradley et al .",

    "2016 , in prep )    of these surveys , arguably the program with the best prospects for probing the bright end of the @xmath4 population would be the wide - area candels program.1 deg@xmath23 ) uds and ultravista programs have great potential to find large numbers of bright @xmath24 sources as demonstrated by the recent bowler et al .",
    "( 2014 ) results ( see also bowler et al .",
    "2015 ) , but may not yet probe deep enough to sample the @xmath25 galaxy population . ] the challenge with candels has been that it is only covered with particularly deep near - infrared observations from 1.2@xmath8 m to 1.6@xmath8 m , but lacks hst - depth @xmath3-band observations at 1.05@xmath8 m over the majority of the area .",
    "deep observations at 1.05@xmath8 m are needed for the determination of photometric redshifts for galaxies in the redshift range @xmath26 to @xmath27 . while this can be partially compensated for by the availability of moderate - depth @xmath28 m observations from various ground - based programs over the candels program , e.g. ,",
    "hugs @xcite , ultravista @xcite , and zfourge ( i. labb et al .",
    "2016 , _ in prep _ ) , such observations are not available over the entire program , making it difficult to consider a search for bright @xmath4 galaxies over the full area .    fortunately , there appears to be one attractive , alternate means for making use of the full candels area to search for bright @xmath4 galaxies . this is to exploit the availability of uniformly deep spitzer / irac observations over the full area ( e.g. , ashby et al .",
    "2013 ) and redshift information present in the [ 3.6]@xmath6[4.5 ] colors of @xmath29 - 8 galaxies .",
    "as demonstrated by many authors ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , the [ 3.6]@xmath6[4.5 ] colors appear to depend on redshift in a particularly well - defined way , a dependence which appears to arise from very strong nebular emission lines , such as h@xmath13 and [ oiii]@xmath305007  , which pass through the irac bands at particular redshifts .",
    "for example , while @xmath216.8 galaxies have very blue [ 3.6]@xmath6[4.5 ] colors likely due to contamination of the [ 3.6 ] filter by [ oiii]+h@xmath7 lines ( and no similar contamination of the [ 4.5 ] band ) , @xmath317 galaxies exhibit much redder [ 3.6]@xmath6[4.5 ] colors , as only the 4.5@xmath8 m band is contaminated by the especially strong [ oiii]+h@xmath7 lines ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    here , we make use of the redshift information in the spitzer / irac observations and apply a consistent set of selection criteria to search for bright @xmath32 galaxies over all 5 candels fields .",
    "a full analysis of the hst + ground - based observations is made in preselecting candidate @xmath24 galaxies , for further consideration with the available spitzer / irac data .",
    "the identification of such bright sources allows us to better map out the bright end of the uv luminosity function ( lf ) at @xmath4 and constrain quantities like the characteristic luminosity @xmath33 or the functional form of the lf at @xmath4 .",
