    "maximization of the critical temperature of dms is of paramount importance from applicational point of view .",
    "one of the known obstacles is the presence of short - range superexchange interactions competing with the charge carrier - mediated rkky interaction supporting the ferromagnetic state in those systems @xcite .",
    "this results in significant reduction of effective magnetic moment and concentration of magnetically active impurity ions , which is observed experimentally . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", such systems are challenging due to the presence of magnetic frustration , positional disorder , and thus appearance of inhomogeneous magnetic orderings .",
    "our aim is to construct a simple model of a disordered system with competing interactions ( capturing some essential features met in dms systems ) and study its mean - field solution , focusing on the critical temperature .",
    "we consider a model site - diluted magnetic system consisting of spin @xmath0 impurity ions , distributed over the @xmath1 fcc lattice sites , with atomic concentration equal to @xmath2 .",
    "this reflects the situation in typical dms systems , where the substitutional ions of magnetic impurities occupy the sites of fcc ( or slightly distorted fcc ) lattice .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model is the following : @xmath3 the site dilution is introduced by the occupation number operators @xmath4 , which take the value of 1 for a lattice site occupied by a magnetic impurity ion and 0 otherwise .",
    "the interaction between the spins is characterized by the exchange integral @xmath5 .",
    "this interaction includes a long - range carrier - mediated rkky coupling ( driving the possible ferromagnetic order in dms ) and as well the antiferromagnetic ( af ) interaction originating from superexchange mechanism , limited to nearest - neighbour ( nn ) magnetic ions @xcite .    in a strongly diluted magnetic system , the dominant ( or at least significant ) number of impurity ions either lacks nn ( single magnetic ions ) or is involved in pairs without nn ( isolated pairs ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , the single magnetic ions experience only the long - range interaction , while the ions in pairs are additionally coupled antiferromagnetically . as a result ,",
    "conditions for inhomogeneity in the magnetic ordering arise in the system .    in order to take this feature into account in the thermodynamic description ,",
    "we develop a modified molecular - field approximation ( mfa ) approach , proceeding along the lines sketched in our work @xcite .",
    "the population of all magnetic impurities is divided into single ions and nn isolated pairs .",
    "the probability that a given impurity is an isolated ion equals to @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , the probability that it belongs to a nn pair reads @xmath7 .",
    "all the clusters of larger size are neglected in the present approach .",
    "let us note that the lattice site occupations by magnetic impurities may not be purely random .",
    "the presence of an impurity in a given lattice site modifies the probability of occupying the nn sites , which then equals to @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is a warren - cowley parameter for nn , fulfilling some necessary inequalities @xcite .",

    "mfa is known to work well in presence of the long - range interactions .",
    "therefore , the density matrices describing the quantum states of single spins are assumed to take the mfa form ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "for the spin of a single ion we use the density matrix @xmath11 depending on the molecular field parameter @xmath12 and yielding the magnetization @xmath13 . here , @xmath14 is the absolute temperature , @xmath15 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath16 is a brillouin function for spin @xmath0 . for the ions belonging to nn pairs",

    "2 presents the example calculations performed for a rather weak af interactions , @xmath46 . for the lower concentration ( corresponding to f - af state ) ,",
    "an interesting feature is that the increase of the temperature causes the appearance of net non - zero magnetization @xmath47 of the ion pairs .",
    "the magnetization of the single ion system @xmath48 vanishes at certain temperature @xmath49 , together with the net magnetization of the pairs @xmath47 and hence the total magnetization of the system @xmath50 .",
    "however , @xmath51 do not vanish itself and the spins of ions in pairs remain antiferromagnetically polarized up to the nel temperature @xmath52 .",
    "the situation is quantitatively different for the larger concentration @xmath2 , corresponding to f - f ground state . as visible in fig .  2 ,",
    "both the single ions and the pairs are ferromagnetically polarized up to the critical temperature @xmath49 and the magnetizations of all the subsystems vanish simultaneously .      for the homogeneous ferromagnetic state ( i.e. for @xmath53 )",
    "we get the reference critical temperature @xmath54 . on the other hand , in the limit of a rather strong superexchange we deal with two completely decoupled systems and then only the single magnetic ions contribute to the ferromagnetic state , leading to the critical temperature of @xmath55 .    , for various relative magnitudes of af coupling @xmath40 and for randomly distributed impurities .",
    "]    the usual procedure of finding the critical temperature within mfa approach relies on the linearization of the relations between magnetization and molecular field parameters resulting from the choice of the density matrices @xcite .",
    "it is tempting to apply this procedure here , however it should be preceded by the careful analysis of the temperature magnetization curves , since the magnetizations of the subsystems in the f - af phase do not vanish simultaneously . as a consequence",
    ", the critical temperature @xmath49 should be determined numerically on the basis of the temperature magnetization curves . as for @xmath56",

    "the plot is prepared for varying relative strength of af interaction , the figure of merit being the ratio of nn antiferromagnetic exchange constant @xmath61 to the ferromagnetic long - range interaction parameter @xmath62 .",

    "the critical temperature increases monotonically with @xmath2 .",
    "increasing the strength of af interaction causes the critical temperature to exhibit a local maximum for certain value of @xmath2 and then significantly drop . on the other hand , for f - f phase , @xmath49 changes almost perfectly linearly with @xmath2 , however its value is reduced over a constant depending on @xmath61 .",
    "it is noticeable that for @xmath63 the critical temperature exhibits a jump with increasing @xmath2 , between f - af and f - f phase ( as shown by the dotted vertical lines ) .",

    "it can be observed that the effect of clustering ( @xmath43 ) limits the @xmath49 value and is similar to the result of increasing the strength of af coupling . on the contrary ,",
    "the tendency of anticlustering ( @xmath44 ) reduces the influence of af interaction , and in the limiting case of @xmath65 ( without nn ) restores the ordinary homogeneous mfa result for @xmath49 .",
    "this indicates the significant importance of the possible non - randomness of the magnetic ions distribution in dms in presence of the superexchange .",
    "it might be instructive to present briefly some results of application of our model to a representative dms system . for this purpose we selected the p - doped zn@xmath66mn@xmath67te , a ii - vi semiconductor exhibiting charge carriers - driven ferromagnetism , which has been subject to experimental and theoretical studies of ferrand _",
    "_ @xcite .    in order to calculate the parameter @xmath68 ,",
    "we make use of the rkky exchange integral in the following form : @xmath69 after the work @xcite , we assume the interaction to be mediated dominantly by the heavy holes of effective mass @xmath70 , therefore @xmath71 is a wavevector for the heavy holes in the valence band .",

    "the dominant af superexchange integral for the nn in ( zn , mn)te equals to @xmath76 k ( after the ref .",
    "however , the same experimental results indicate that the af interaction between mn impurities in this dms is not limited to nn ions .",

    "the experimentally determined concentrations of mn impurities @xmath2 and holes @xmath81 are indicated in the plots . for both samples also",
    "the effective concentration of magnetic impurities was obtained from the low - temperature saturation magnetization , what allowed us to establish the value of @xmath6 and thus calculate the warren - cowley parameter @xmath9 necessary to reproduce @xmath6 for the given concentration @xmath2 .    using the above - mentioned parameters",
    ", we reproduce the experimentally observed critical temperatures using the characteristic damping lengths @xmath75 slightly larger than the lattice constant , as given in the plots .",
    "moreover , the same set of parameters allows us to calculate the characteristic ferromagnetic temperature @xmath82 ( which does not include af superexchange interactions , to conform with the meaning of experimentally determined @xmath79 in the work @xcite ) .",
    "the values of @xmath49 and @xmath79 were calculated numerically as a function of magnetic impurity concentration ( assuming constant @xmath9 ) .    it can be observed that for the sample with lower mn concentration @xmath83 ( fig .",
    "[ figexp](a ) ) , we reproduce well both the value of the critical temperature and the characteristic ferromagnetic temperature within our model . on the other hand , for the sample with higher mn concentration @xmath84 ( fig .",
    "[ figexp](b ) ) , the value of @xmath79 is slightly overestimated .",
    "such a difference might be attributed to the influence of larger clusters of the magnetic ions , which is more pronounced for larger @xmath2 .",
    "especially , the clusters containing odd number of the ions contribute to the ground - state magnetization ( contrary to the af - polarized pairs of ions ) and thus have an impact on the value of @xmath6 extracted from the experimental data .",
    "let us emphasize that in our model we do not make use of the empirically determined characteristic temperature @xmath80 , but we use only the values of superexchange and rkky exchange integrals present in the hamiltonian ( [ eqhamiltonian ] ) .",
    "for our model dms system , it is noticeable that the critical temperature is rather sensitive to the presence and the relative strength of the af interactions between nn as well as to the clustering or anticlustering of the magnetic ions .",
    "application of the model to ( zn , mn)te indicates that the experimental results can be satisfactorily reproduced , especially for low concentrations of magnetic impurities , by constructing the systematic thermodynamic treatment of the system hamiltonian .",
    "the future developments of the model may especially include taking into account the existence of the larger clusters of magnetic ions ( e.g. triples ) , since the relative abundance of such clusters rises rapidly with the concentration of impurities .",
    "it may also be worthwhile to include the af interactions between further neighbors in the magnetic sublattice .",
