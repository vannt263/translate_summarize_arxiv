    "realizing qubits with long coherence time is a basic requirement for quantum information processing .",
    "@xcite a promising strategy to achieve this goal is to make use of quantum error correcting codes , where a single logical qubit is represented by suitable entangled states of a collection of many spins .",
    "this allows to detect and correct a finite number of errors acting on the individual physical spins of the code .",
    "@xcite furthermore , if the quantum code is the ground space of a gapped hamiltonian , errors in the memory lead to excitations in the spin system and they can be suppressed at low temperature . in this respect ,",
    "stabilizer hamiltonians ( given by a sum of mutually commuting pauli operators ) are of special importance @xcite and a particularly interesting class are stabilizer hamiltonians with topological order , where the distance of the code grows as a power of the system size @xmath0 ( see refs . for a rigorous definition of topological quantum order and its consequences on the stability of the ground subspace under local hamiltonian perturbations ) .",
    "models with topological order were already known in the context of lattice gauge theory @xcite and a pioneering example applied to quantum information is the toric code proposed by kitaev .",
    "@xcite    however , several limitations of this type of model appear when put in contact with an external environment.@xcite most importantly , it was shown that at any finite temperature the lifetime of the toric code does not grow with system size .",
    "@xcite this is a generic feature of stabilizer hamiltonians with short - range interactions in one and two dimensions since , while the distance of the code increases with @xmath0 , the energy barrier to perform a logical error is bounded by a constant .",
    "@xcite in the case of the toric code , the excitations of the system can be represented as pairs of classical diffusing anyons and the aforementioned energy barrier is simply the energy cost to create a single anyon pair .",
    "therefore , it is of crucial importance to devise new architectures where such gap is enhanced and the anyon population is exponentially suppressed .",
    "it was recently shown that repulsive long - range interactions among the anyons lead to a large self - consistent mean - field gap which grows with system size and the resulting prolongation of the lifetime was studied in detail .",
    "@xcite the toric code can be realized as a low - energy effective hamiltonian of the kitaev honeycomb model , @xcite and long - range interactions between anyons appear in the presence of a non - local coupling with cavity modes extending over the whole memory .",
    "@xcite in analogy to the spin - electric coupling in molecular magnets , @xcite we consider a modification of the ising couplings of the type @xmath1 . in this paper",
    "we study in detail the effect of such a coupling in the honeycomb model by making use of perturbation theory and show that cavity modes can be useful in several ways , not only to mediate long - range interactions between anyons .",
    "for example , they allow to realize a basic operation such as the read - out of the error syndrome or , in other words , to detect the presence of anyons across the memory . to achieve this ,",
    "it is sufficient to couple locally a single cavity mode to the desired read - out site and to detect its frequency shift , similar to a scheme demonstrated for superconducting qubits . @xcite",
    "as we will see in the next sections , a single cavity mode can also be used to resonantly enhance the anyon gap while , to generate an anyon - anyon interaction of the desired sign , two cavity modes are required .",
    "such a variety of situations corresponds to different specific configurations for the interaction between the cavity modes and the spin model , which we analyze by making use of perturbation theory .",
    "our work is based on the schrieffer - wolff transformation , @xcite which can be easily applied to the kitaev honeycomb model , even in the presence of cavity modes , to obtain explicit expressions for the parameters of the quantum memory .",
