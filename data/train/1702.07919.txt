    "titanium dioxide ( tio@xmath0 ) , also known as titania , has been widely studied as a promising material for many applications because of its low production cost , chemical stability , and non - toxicity @xcite .",
    "titania is useful for , in particular , solar cells @xcite , batteries @xcite , photochemical @xcite and photocatalytic @xcite applications , gas sensing @xcite , and hydrogen storage @xcite .",
    "however , it can only be activated by ultraviolet light due to its large band gap ( @xmath1 ev for the rutile , and @xmath2 ev for the anatase phase ) .",
    "therefore , engineering the band gap of titania in order to increase its photosensitivity for visible light is one of the main targets in photocatalyst studies .",
    "anionic substitution of o in the titania lattice with a nonmetal ( anion doping ) @xcite has been extensively studied in this context , as well as replacing ti with a metal ( cation doping ) @xcite .",
    "many groups have focused on doping with si and sn , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite . on the theoretical side ,",
    "density functional theory ( dft ) has been applied extensively @xcite .",
    "low - dimensional tio@xmath0 nanostructures have been prepared , such as thin films @xcite , nanowires @xcite , nanotubes @xcite , and nanoparticles @xcite . among them , tio@xmath0 nanotube ( tnt ) arrays are very interesting because of their large internal surface and highly ordered geometry @xcite .",
    "titanium dioxide nanotubes have been studied theoretically using the density - functional tight - binding method ( dftb ) @xcite .",
    "the structural properties , the stability and the electronic structure of different tnt structures ( anatase and lepidocrocite ) have been discussed @xcite .",
    "all anatase nanotubes are semiconductors with direct band gaps while the lepidocrocite nanotubes are semiconductors with indirect gaps .",
    "in addition , anatase nanotubes were found to be most stable ; their stability increases with increasing diameter @xcite .",
    "the rolling of an anatase ( 101 ) sheet along the [ @xmath3 and [ @xmath4 directions has been used to build ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) and ( @xmath6 , @xmath5 ) tnts , respectively @xcite . however , doped tnts have scarcely been studied theoretically , except for the work by mowbray et al .",
    "@xcite and , very recently , by one of us @xcite . in the latter work ,",
    "the emphasis was on nonmetal and halogen doping of tnts .    in the present paper ,",
    "after describing the methodology ( section ii ) , we investigate the effect of the mono - dopants ( si , ge , sn , pb ) on the structure and stability of ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) titania nanotubes ( section iii ) .",
    "then we study the electronic structure of doped tnts ( section iv ) , followed by a discussion of the optical properties ( section v ) .",
    "an application of this study is the splitting of water ( section vi ) .",
    "we close our work with a brief summary ( section vii ) .",
    "we apply density functional theory ( dft ) employing the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) and the perdew - burke - ernzerhof functional @xcite as implemented in the siesta package @xcite .",
    "the wave functions are expanded using a local atomic orbitals basis set ; the energy cutoff is @xmath7 ry , and the monkhorst - pack @xmath8-meshes contain @xmath9 points .",
    "structural relaxation is carried out with the conjugate gradient method until the net force on every atom is smaller than @xmath10 ev /  .",
    "as we are interested in the properties of nanotubes , a rectangular supercell @xmath11 is used , where @xmath12 is the length of the nanotube along the z - axis .",
    "the distance between two neighboring tnts , in x and y directions , is set to @xmath13  , which is sufficient to avoid any image interaction .",
    "test calculations , changing the size of the supercell and the number of @xmath8-points , show the convergence of our results .",
    "spin polarized calculations have also been performed for selected systems , but no modifications of the results were found .",
    "+     the total number of the atoms in the unit cell of a tnt is related to the number of atoms in one unit cell ( @xmath14 atoms ) in the surface layer .",
    "we use a supercell including two tnt unit cells to study the effect of changing the doping concentration .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the structure of two unit cells of ( @xmath15 , 0 ) tnt .",
    "the length of the tube is @xmath16  , which is slightly larger than found in a previous study ( @xmath17  ) @xcite .",
    "the average inner diameter is @xmath18  ( between two opposite inner o atoms ) , and @xmath19  for the average outer diameter ( between two opposite outer o atoms ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the average diameter is @xmath20  with respect to the ti atoms .",
    "the thickness of the nanotube wall ( o1o3 ) is @xmath21  which agrees with the previous result @xcite .",
    "the bond length between ti2o2 is @xmath22  , and for ti1o1 and ti1o3 is @xmath23  , which also is in good agreement with previous papers @xcite .",
    "cation doping of the tnt is introduced by replacing ti atoms by the dopants .",
    "replacing one ti by a metal dopant corresponds to @xmath24 1.0% dopant concentration .",
    "if two atoms are substituted , the doping concentrations will double , and so on .",
    "these dopant concentrations can be compared to those reported experimentally @xcite .",
    "the dopant - dopant interaction was avoided due to the large distance between them ( @xmath25  for @xmath26% , and @xmath15  for @xmath27% dopant concentrations ) .",
    "the optimized average bond lengths around the dopant atoms are listed in tab .",

[ bondlengthtable ] .",
    "the table shows that the charge transfer from the dopant atom to the surrounding o atom is rather high for si and sn , as compared to ge and pb . the formation energy of doped tnts is used to investigate the stability of the structures .",
    "the formation energy ( @xmath34 ) of the dopant atoms can be calculated as follows @xcite :    [ bondlengthtable ]    @xmath35    where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the total energies of the metal - doped tio@xmath0 and the pristine tio@xmath0 nanotube , respectively . here",
    "@xmath38 and @xmath39 denote the chemical potential for ti and the dopant , respectively , which are assumed to be equal to the energy of one atom in its corresponding bulk structure .",
    "the formation energy depends on the growth conditions , which can be ti - rich or o - rich @xcite . for the ti - rich condition",
    ", thermodynamic equilibrium is assumed for the ti bulk solid phase , thus its chemical potential is fixed at @xmath38 , while the chemical potential of o is fixed by the growth conditions . under the o - rich condition , o is assumed to be in equilibrium with o@xmath0 molecules , thus the chemical potential of o is @xmath40 .",
    "we present the formation energy under the o - rich condition , which is lower than for the ti - rich condition .",
    "the stabilities of nanotubes with dopants are in the following order : si > ge > sn > pb . the behavior of the formation energies can be understood in terms of the dopant s electronegativity given by @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 for si , ge , sn , and pb , respectively . on the one hand ,",
    "one notes that the formation energy of si is smaller than that of the other dopants , corresponding to the fact that si has the smallest electronegativity . on the other hand , the pb",
    "formation energy is the largest , and so is its electronegativity . from this point of view ,",
    "ge and sn doped tnts are `` out of order '' , which can be related to the effect of electronegativity on the ionic radius , implying that the formation of sn  o bonds is more favorable than ge  o bonds .",
    "this behavior of formation energies and bond lengths is very similar to the behavior of the corresponding dopant in bulk tio@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig2](a ) shows the density of states ( dos ) for pristine titania nanotubes ( @xmath15 , 0 ) .",
    "the band gap of the pure tnt is @xmath45 ev , which is lower than the corresponding gap of bulk tio@xmath0 anatase @xcite due to the well known shortcoming of the gga .",
    "the ti states dominate in the unoccupied states , while the o ( p ) states contribute mostly to the occupied states with a minor contribution to the unoccupied states , see fig .",

    "as compared to the dos of pristine tnt , the fermi energy moves to higher energy ; the band gap is @xmath46 ev for 1% doping , which is less than that of pristine tnt . when the concentration is increased to 2% and 3% , the fermi energy shifts further upwards , but this shift is larger for 2% than for 3% .",
    "the band gap remains @xmath46 ev for 2% , and increases to @xmath47 ev for 3% dopant concentration .",
    "the shift of the fermi energy is also seen in the si pdos ( fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) ) .",
    "the band gap in the si pdos is larger than the band gap in the dos , indicating that the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band are still dominated by o and ti states , respectively .",
    "the si states for 1% dopant contribute most strongly around @xmath48 ev , and below @xmath49 ev . for 2% and 3% concentrations",
    ", the contribution of si states appears around @xmath50 ev , and below @xmath51 ev .",
    "figure [ fig3]c shows that the fermi energy is slightly shifted towards higher energy due to ge substitution , as compared to pristine tnt ( fig .  [ fig2](a ) ) .",
    "the band gap is @xmath47 ev , which is less than the band gap of pristine tnt but larger than that of si doped tnt at the same concentration .",
    "the result for a ge dopant concentration of 2% is very similar to 1% .",
    "however , a doping of 3% shifts the fermi energy upwards with an increase in the band gap to @xmath43 ev .",
    "these fermi energy shifts can be explained using the pdos of ge as shown in fig .",

    "the band gap decreases for 2% sn to @xmath47 ev , and does not change for 3% sn , and thus is similar to 1% sn concentration . the contribution of sn states is illustrated in fig .",

    "in addition , the increase of doping concentration decreases the band gap slightly to @xmath57 ev , and @xmath58 ev for 2% and 3% , respectively .",

    "the study of optical properties illustrates that the mono-/co - doped tnts can absorb a wide range of visible light , in contrast to pristine tnt .",
    "this absorption of visible light is related to the decrease of the band gap , and the shift of the fermi energy .",

    "<S> the structural , stability , electronic , and optical properties of metal ( si , ge , sn , and pb ) mono- and co - doped anatase tio@xmath0 nanotubes are investigated , in order to elucidate their potential for photocatalytic applications . it is found that si doped tio@xmath0 nanotubes are more stable than other doped nanotubes . all dopants lower the band gap , the decrease depending on the concentration and the type of dopant . </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly , there is a redshift in the optical properties for all kinds of dopings . </S>",
    "<S> even though a pb mono - doped tio@xmath0 nanotube has the lowest band gap , this system is not suited for water splitting , in contrast to si , ge , and sn mono - doped tio@xmath0 nanotubes . on the other hand , co - doped tio@xmath0 does not show an enhancement of the photocatalytic properties through doping . </S>"
