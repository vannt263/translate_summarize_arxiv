    "the game of _ cops and robbers _",
    ", introduced independently by nowakowski and winkler  @xcite and quilliot  @xcite almost thirty years ago , is played on a fixed graph @xmath0 .",
    "we will always assume that @xmath0 is undirected , simple , and finite .",
    "there are two players , a set of @xmath9 _ cops _ , where @xmath10 is a fixed integer , and the _ robber_. the cops begin the game by occupying any set of @xmath9 vertices ( in fact , for a connected @xmath0 , their initial position does not matter ) .",
    "the robber then chooses a vertex , and the cops and robber move in alternate rounds .",
    "the players use edges to move from vertex to vertex .",
    "more than one cop is allowed to occupy a vertex , and the players may remain on their current positions . the players know",
    "each others current locations . the cops win and the game ends if at least one of the cops eventually occupies the same vertex as the robber ; otherwise , that is , if the robber can avoid this indefinitely , he wins . as placing a cop on each vertex",
    "guarantees that the cops win , we may define the _ cop number _ , written @xmath11 , which is the minimum number of cops needed to win on @xmath0 .",
    "the cop number was introduced by aigner and fromme  @xcite who proved ( among other things ) that if @xmath0 is planar , then @xmath12 . for more results on vertex pursuit games such as _ cops and robbers _ , the reader",
    "is directed to the surveys on the subject  @xcite and the monograph  @xcite .",
    "the most important open problem in this area is meyniel s conjecture ( communicated by frankl  @xcite ) .",
    "it states that @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the maximum of @xmath11 over all @xmath2-vertex connected graphs . if true , the estimate is best possible as one can construct a graph based on the finite projective plane with the cop number of order at least @xmath15 . up until recently",
    ", the best known upper bound of @xmath16 was given in  @xcite .",
    "this was improved to @xmath17 in  @xcite .",
    "today we know that the cop number is at most @xmath18 ( which is still @xmath19 ) for any connected graph on @xmath2 vertices ( a result obtained independently by lu and peng  @xcite and scott and sudakov  @xcite , see also  @xcite for some extensions ) .",
    "if one looks for counterexamples for meyniel s conjecture it is natural to study first the cop number of random graphs .",
    "recent years have witnessed significant interest in the study of random graphs from that perspective  @xcite confirming that , in fact , meyniel s conjecture holds asymptotically almost surely for binomial random graphs  @xcite as well as for random @xmath20-regular graphs  @xcite .    in this note",
    "we consider a _",
    "random geometric graph _",
    "@xmath21 which is defined as a random graph with vertex set @xmath22=\\{1,2,\\dots , n\\}$ ] in which @xmath2 vertices are chosen uniformly at random and independently from @xmath3^d$ ] , and a pair of vertices within euclidean distance @xmath4 appears as an edge  see , for example , the monograph  @xcite .    as typical in random graph theory",
    ", we shall consider only asymptotic properties of @xmath21 as @xmath23 , where @xmath24 may and usually does depend on @xmath2 .",
    "we say that an event in a probability space holds _ asymptotically almost surely _",
    "( _ a.a.s .",
    "_ ) if its probability tends to one as @xmath2 goes to infinity .",
    "let us recall that , in @xmath20-dimensional euclidean space , the volume of the ball of radius @xmath4 is proportional to the @xmath20th power of @xmath4 ; that is , @xmath25 , where the constant of proportionality , the volume of the unit ball , is given by @xmath26",
    "we prove the following result .      the same result was obtained earlier and independently in  @xcite but the proof presented here is quite different , provides a tight @xmath8 bound for the number of rounds required to catch the robber , and can be generalized to higher dimensions . in the proof",
    "we describe a strategy for the cop that is a winning one a.a.s . in  @xcite ,",
    "the known necessary and sufficient condition for a graph to be cop - win ( see  @xcite for more details ) is used ; that is , it is shown that the random geometric graph is what is called dismantlable a.a.s .        in all dimensions",
    "the proof gives that a.a.s .",
    "the cop can win in @xmath8 steps and , as we mention below , this is tight ; namely , a.a.s.the robber can ensure not to be caught in less steps .",
    "therefore , the capture time for this range of parameters is @xmath34 a.a.s .",
    "we make no attempt to optimize the absolute constants in all arguments below , aiming to propose an argument which is as simple as possible .    in order to prove theorem  [ t11 ]",
    "it is convenient to describe first a cleaner proof of the corresponding result for the continuous ( infinite ) graph @xmath35 whose vertices are all of the points of @xmath3 ^ 2 $ ] , where two of them are adjacent if and only if their distance is at most @xmath4 .",
    "this is a natural variant of the well - known problem of _ the lion and the christian _ in which ( perhaps surprisingly ) the christian ( counterpart of the robber in our game ) has a winning strategy ; see , for example ,  @xcite for more details . in our game ,",
    "the cop ( counterpart of the lion ) has a winning strategy .",
    "this is a essentially a known result @xcite , but the proof described here differs from the known ones and , crucially for us , can be easily modified to yield a proof of theorem  [ t11 ] and theorem [ t12 ] .",
    "we show that @xmath36 for any @xmath37 , by describing a winning strategy for the cop . in the first step , the cop places himself at the center @xmath38 of @xmath3",
    "^ 2 $ ] . after each move of the robber , when he is located at a point @xmath39 , the cop catches him if he can ( that is , if the distance between him and the robber is at most @xmath4 ) ; otherwise , he moves to a point @xmath40 that lies on the segment @xmath41 , making sure his distance from the robber is at least , say , @xmath42 .",
    "moreover , we will show that the cop can do it and also ensure that in each step the square of the distance between the location of the cop and @xmath38 increases by at least @xmath43 . as this square distance",
    "can not be more than @xmath44 , this implies that the cop catches the robber in at most @xmath8 steps .",
    "here is the proof showing that the cop can indeed achieve the above in each step of the game .",
    "suppose that the cop is located at @xmath40 and the robber at @xmath39 , where @xmath40 lies on @xmath41 ( and the distance between @xmath40 and @xmath39 is at least @xmath42 ) .",
    "trivially , the cop can ensure this will be the case after his first move ( unless the robber gives up prematurely without fighting and starts the game too close to the cop ) .",
    "a step , now , consists of a move of the robber from @xmath39 to @xmath45 followed by a move of the cop from @xmath40 to @xmath46 .",
    "let @xmath47 denote the midpoint of @xmath48 and let @xmath49 be the line through @xmath47 perpendicular to @xmath50see figure  [ fig1 ] . without loss of generality",
    ", choose a coordinate system so that @xmath41 is a vertical line ( and hence @xmath49 is a horizontal one ) , and assume @xmath39 ( as well as @xmath40 and @xmath47 ) are below @xmath38 . note that @xmath45 , the new location of the robber , may be assumed to be below the line @xmath49 , since otherwise",
    "the distance between @xmath40 and @xmath45 is at most the distance between @xmath39 and @xmath45 , meaning that the cop can catch the robber , winning the game .",
    "suppose then that @xmath45 is below @xmath49 and let @xmath46 be the intersection point of the horizontal line through @xmath40 with the line @xmath51 .",
    "let also @xmath52 denote the intersection point of the horizontal line through @xmath45 with the line containing @xmath41see figure  [ fig1 ] one more time .",
    "now it is easy to see that @xmath53 , as the triangle @xmath54 is a right - angle triangle and the two triangles @xmath55 and @xmath56 are similar .",
    "hence , the cop may move to @xmath46 if he decides to do so , as @xmath57 .",
    "consider the following two possible cases .",
    "* case 1 : * @xmath58 . in this case",
    "if the cop moves to @xmath46 then its square distance to @xmath38 increases by @xmath59 .",
    "if @xmath46 is too close to @xmath45 , we shift him towards @xmath38 slightly ( that is , by less than @xmath42 ) to ensure the distance between @xmath46 and @xmath45 is at least @xmath42 .",
    "note that such a shift decreases the square distance from @xmath38 by less than @xmath60 , hence the square distance still increases by at least @xmath61 .",
    "thus , in this case the cop can make a step as required .",
    "* case 2 : * @xmath62 . in this case",
    "the cop can move to @xmath46 and then walk along the line @xmath51 at least distance @xmath63 towards @xmath45 ( without passing it , since otherwise the game ends and the cop wins ) . as clearly @xmath64 , in this case the cop increases its distance from @xmath38 by more than @xmath63 and hence its square distance by more than @xmath65 .",
    "as before , it may be the case that he gets too close to @xmath45 and then he backups slightly by less than @xmath42 , which is still fine .",
    "this shows that in @xmath35 the cop can indeed increase its square distance from @xmath38 by at least @xmath43 in each step ( which is not a winning step ending the game ) , staying on the segment connecting the center and the robber ( and being closer to the center than the robber ) .",
    "this implies that the game ends with a cop win in @xmath8 steps .    modifying the above argument to get a winning strategy for @xmath66 ( a.a.s . )",
    "is not too difficult .",
    "the cop will follow essentially the same strategy , but will always place himself at a vertex of the graph which is sufficiently close to where he wants to be in the continuous game .",
    "more precisely , for each point @xmath67 of the unit square whose distance from the center @xmath38 is at least @xmath63 ( just to ensure that the triangle @xmath68 defined below will indeed be well defined ; in our argument this will always be the case ) and whose distance from the boundary is at least @xmath69 ( again , in our argument this will always be the case ) , we define an isosceles triangle @xmath70 as follows .",
    "one vertex is @xmath67 , and the segment of length @xmath42 on the line @xmath71 starting at @xmath67 ( and going towards @xmath38 ) is the height of @xmath70 .",
    "the base is orthogonal to it and of length @xmath72 . despite the fact that there are infinitely many triangles , it is not difficult to show that if the area of such a triangle is large enough , then a.a.s.@xmath66 contains a vertex inside each such triangle .",
    "let us start with a fixed collection @xmath75 of @xmath76 rectangles , each of area @xmath77 , so that every triangle @xmath70 fully contains at least one of these rectangles .",
    "to do so , for each point @xmath78 in an @xmath79 by @xmath79 grid in the unit square take the rectangle of width @xmath80 and height @xmath81 in which @xmath78 is the midpoint of the edge of length @xmath79 and the other edge is in direction @xmath82 .",
    "it is clear that every @xmath70 under consideration ( @xmath67 not too close to @xmath38 nor to the boundary ) fully contains at least one such a rectangle .    in order to complete the proof it is enough to show that a.a.s .",
    "each rectangle in @xmath75 contains at least one vertex of @xmath66 .",
    "the area of each such rectangle is @xmath83 , and hence the probability it contains no vertex is @xmath84 since there are @xmath85 rectangles , the desired result follows by the union bound for , say , @xmath86 , as needed .",
    "the expected number of vertices in each triangle is @xmath87 .",
    "we next use a consequence of chernoff s bound ( see e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , corollary  2.3 ) ) , that @xmath88 for @xmath89 . applying  ( [ chern ] ) with , say , @xmath90",
    "we get that the probability that a given triangle contains at least one vertex is at most @xmath91 .",
    "since there are @xmath85 rectangles , the result follows by the union bound for , say , @xmath92 and the proof is finished .",
    "since we aim for a statement that holds a.a.s .",
    ", it follows from lemma  [ lem : triangles ] that we may assume that every triangle @xmath70 contains at least one vertex .",
    "as we already mentioned , the cop plays the continuous strategy , but whenever he wants to place himself at a point @xmath67 , he chooses an arbitrary vertex @xmath93 of @xmath70 to go to .",
    "the line @xmath94 is now not necessarily identical to the line @xmath95 , but the angle between them is sufficiently small to ensure that in the computations above for the continuous case we do not lose much .",
    "that was the reason we ensured that @xmath45 and @xmath67 are never too close in the continuous algorithm , and as the triangle @xmath70 is thin , the angle between these two lines is smaller than @xmath96 .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "as we already mentioned , essentially the same proof works for general dimension .",
    "the continuous game in dimension @xmath20 is nearly identical to the one in dimension @xmath97 . in the first step ,",
    "the cop places himself at the center @xmath38 of @xmath3^d$ ] . after each move of the robber , when he is located at a point @xmath39 , the cop catches him if he can",
    ", otherwise , he moves to a point @xmath40 that lies on the segment @xmath41 , making sure his distance from the robber is at least , say , @xmath42 . as in the planar case",
    ", the cop can do it and also ensure that in each step the square of the distance between his location and @xmath38 increases by at least @xmath43 .",
    "indeed , since in each round the center @xmath38 , the location of the cop @xmath40 , the old location of the robber @xmath39 and his new location @xmath45 lie in a two dimensional plane ( since @xmath38 , @xmath40 and @xmath39 lie on a line ) the analysis is identical to the planar case . as the square distance of the cop from the center",
    "can not exceed @xmath98 , this implies that the cop catches the robber in at most @xmath99 steps .",
    "in the discrete game we let @xmath70 be a cone with height @xmath42 on the line connecting the center @xmath38 to @xmath67 , and basis of radius @xmath72 centered at @xmath67 .",
    "the probabilistic estimate given in the proof of lemma [ lem : triangles ] shows that a.a.s .",
    "every such cone @xmath70 contains a vertex of our graph , provided @xmath32 .",
    "we can thus repeat the arguments in the proof of the planar case to show that the assertion of theorem  [ t12 ] holds .",
    "finally , note that the robber can keep escaping for @xmath100 steps a.a.s . for simplicity",
    ", we describe the strategy for the robber for the plane but this also holds for any dimension , for the same reason . as before , we start with the continuous variant of the game . initially , the robber places himself at distance bigger than @xmath4 from the cop ensuring he is not too far from the center @xmath38 of the square . at each step ,",
    "when the robber located at @xmath39 has to move , he moves distance @xmath4 exactly in the direction perpendicular to @xmath101 , where the choice of the direction ( among the two options ) , is such that its square distance from @xmath38 increases by at most @xmath102 ( that is , the angle @xmath103 is at most @xmath104 ) .",
    "this suffices for the continuous case , as it is clear that the distance from the cop will exceed @xmath4 after each such step . in the discrete case ,",
    "the robber simply chooses a nearby point , making sure his distance from the cop is at least what it would have been in the continuous case ."
