    "<S> clear deficiency of this description is the fact that the equilibrium deformation is not defined within some `` variational '' procedure , but is adjusted for a better description of moments of inertia . </S>",
    "<S> it was concluded in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite that the low-@xmath2 @xmath3 proton orbitals are responsible for the observed bump in the dynamic moment of inertia @xmath4 at low rotational frequencies and that the 2-quasiparticle configurations from these orbitals dominate the structure of the observed states . </S>",

    "<S> the configurations with normal deformation have too small and the configurations with hyperdeformation too large values of moments of inertia . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental values of transition quadrupole moment @xmath25 are best reproduced by the sd configurations . </S>",

    "<S> the exact band crossing frequencies are not known for bands 1 and 2 because downsloping branches of @xmath4 below the band crossing have not been observed . </S>",

    "<S> the frequency of this band crossing depends on the relative position of the above mentioned orbitals and thus the discrepancy between experiment and theory suggests that the relative energy distance between these orbitals is underestimated in the calculations by approximately 0.7 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the crmf calculations well reproduce the absolute value of dynamic moment of inertia @xmath4 above the band crossing , but underestimate somewhat the height of the bump in dynamic moment of inertia @xmath4 at the band crossing ( fig .

    "<S> this suggests that the band in @xmath0cd has been observed in the spin range from @xmath32 up to @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> however , taking into account that typical accuracy of the description of the moments of inertia in the crmf calculations is around 5% @xcite and possible minor impact of pairing at high rotational frequencies , which would lead to slight decrease of calculated @xmath24 @xcite , one can not completely exclude that the lowest sd band in @xmath0cd has been observed from @xmath34 up to @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> the spin range @xmath36 has been suggested in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite using the assumption that @xmath37 . however , this assumption is not supported by our calculations where @xmath38 for assigned configuration above the band crossing .    </S>",
    "<S> the average transition quadrupole moment of the assigned configuration in the suggested spin range is @xmath39 @xmath40b , which agrees with the lower limit of @xmath41 @xmath40b obtained in experiment @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the occupation of the first proton @xmath15 orbital at the band crossing has only minor impact on @xmath25 : an increase of @xmath25 by approximately 0.2 @xmath40b .    </S>",
    "<S> band 2 has the features similar to the band 1 except that the band crossing takes place @xmath30 kev earlier ( fig .  [ j1]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> especially interesting is the observation that the @xmath4 moments of inertia of these two bands are very similar above the band crossing . </S>",
    "<S> similar to the @xmath6 region of superdeformation @xcite , this suggests that the intruder content of observed bands should be the same . </S>",
    "<S> the only possible explanation found in our calculations is related to the excitation of proton from the @xmath281/2(r=+i)$ ] orbital into the lowest positive parity orbital with signature @xmath42 above the @xmath14 shell gap ( see fig .   [ routh ] ) . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ routh ] above @xmath43 mev , this orbital has the @xmath443/2 $ ] structure . </S>",
    "<S> however , contrary to the situation shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ routh ] at equilibrium deformation of the configuration of interest the @xmath453/2(r=\\pm i)$ ] orbitals are located below the @xmath467/2(r=\\pm i)$ ] orbitals even at zero rotational frequency . at @xmath47 mev , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath443/2(r =- i)$ ] and the @xmath291/2(r =- i)$ ] orbitals interact strongly . </S>",
    "<S> this interaction creates the bump in @xmath4 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ j1]b ) . above the band </S>",
    "<S> crossing , the calculated @xmath4 reproduces well the experimental one and is very close to the @xmath4 values of the configuration assigned to the lowest sd band , the feature observed also in experiment .    </S>",
    "<S> when interpreting band 2 , we also considered particle - hole excitations in neutron subsystem , namely from the @xmath481/2(r=+i)$ ] orbital to the @xmath495/2(r=\\pm i)$ ] orbitals ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ routh ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> such excitations lead to smaller deformation , and thus to the delay of the unpaired band crossing ( originating from interaction of the @xmath281/2(r=+i)$ ] and the @xmath291/2(r=+i)$ ] orbitals ) . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in the configuration based on the occupied @xmath495/2(r =- i)$ ] orbital this crossing is delayed by @xmath50 mev , which is in contradiction with experiment .    therefore , similar to the configuration assigned to the band 1 , the structure of the configuration assigned to the band 2 changes from @xmath26 to @xmath27 at the band crossing . </S>",
    "<S> however , it has total signature @xmath51 ( odd spins ) and negative parity . the band crossing </S>",
    "<S> a , active in the configuration of the band 1 , is not active in the configuration of band 2 since both interacting orbitals ( @xmath281/2(r =- i)$ ] and @xmath291/2(r =- i)$ ] ) are occupied ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ routh ] ) . since the @xmath467/2(r =- i)$ ] and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath291/2(r =- i)$ ] orbitals interact very weakly ( see inside of ellipse b in fig .   [ routh ] ) , their interaction can not explain the observed features of band 2 in the band crossing region . the comparison of relative alignments of bands 2 and 1 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ j1 ] ) suggests that with @xmath31 assigned for initial state of band 1 , the band 2 has been observed in the spin range from @xmath52 up to @xmath53 . in the region beyond band </S>",
    "<S> crossing ( @xmath54 mev ) , the calculated relative alignments differ from the experimental ones only by @xmath55 : this is within the typical uncertainty of the description of relative alignments in the crmf theory @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the calculations show that the quadrupole deformations of the configurations assigned to the bands 1 and 2 are almost the same , but they differ somewhat in the @xmath56-deformation . </S>",
    "<S> while the configuration of band 1 has @xmath57 , the one of the band 2 has @xmath58 . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> the configuration of the band 2 is more collective ( @xmath59 @xmath40b ) as compared with the one of band 1 . </S>",
    "<S> although the experimental analysis for band 2 yielded a lower value for the transition quadrupole moment @xmath60 @xmath40b , it suffered from the large errors on the @xmath61 values which did not allow an accurate measurement of the @xmath25 values @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus based on the similarity of rotational properties of bands 1 and 2 above the band crossing and the results of the crmf calculations , it is reasonable to believe that the deformation for band 2 is comparable to the one for band 1 ( see also ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the earlier band crossing in the configuration of band 2 as compared with experiment is due to small energy distance between the @xmath443/2 $ ] and @xmath291/2 $ ] orbitals in the calculations . in order to have this crossing at </S>",
    "<S> experimentally observed frequency , one should increase this distance by @xmath62 mev . </S>",
    "<S> this value is similar to the underestimate of the energy distance between the @xmath281/2 $ ] and @xmath631/2 $ ] orbitals deduced earlier . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the energy distance between the @xmath443/2 $ ] and @xmath281/2 $ ] orbitals , and , consequently the @xmath14 sd shell gap is reasonably well reproduced in the calculations . </S>",
    "<S> thus , one concludes that the @xmath14 sd shell gap is smaller than the @xmath64 sd shell gap in the @xmath8 region of superdeformation ( see fig .  1 in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) and @xmath65 sd shell gap in the rare - earth region of superdeformation ( see fig .  3 in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> this maybe a possible reason why the search for sd bands in neighbouring nuclei has been unsuccesful so far @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition , it indicates that in reality the @xmath631/2 $ ] orbital is located @xmath62 mev higher in energy with respect of the @xmath281/2 $ ] and @xmath443/2 $ ] orbitals than suggested by the present calculations . </S>",
    "<S> this is not far away from the typical accuracy with which the energies of the single - particle states are reproduced at normal- @xcite and superdeformation @xcite in the rmf calculations with the nl1 set .    </S>",
    "<S> unpaired band crossings at superdeformation were reported earlier , for example , in @xmath66gd @xcite and @xmath67ho @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the band crossing in the sd band 1 of @xmath67ho is similar to the ones seen in @xmath0cd since it involves the interaction of the routhians with @xmath68 .    </S>",
    "<S> the hyperdeformed configurations become yrast above @xmath69 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eld ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> these are the signature partner @xmath70 configurations of negative parity which are degenerated in energy . </S>",
    "<S> this energy degeneracy is due to the excitation of one neutron from the @xmath717/2(r=\\pm i)$ ] orbitals into the lowest @xmath72 orbital ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ routh - hd ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the hd configurations are favoured in energy at these spins due to the @xmath14 hd shell gap and low neutron level density at @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> the transition quadrupole moment @xmath25 increases from @xmath74 @xmath40b at @xmath75 up to @xmath76 at @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> this fact is related to the stretching of the nucleus due to centrifugal force . </S>",
    "<S> the shape of nucleus corresponds to the 2.3:1 semiaxis ratio ( fig .  [ density ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the kinematic moment of inertia drops down from @xmath78 mev@xmath79 at @xmath75 to @xmath80 mev@xmath79 at @xmath77 . in the frequency range where </S>",
    "<S> the experimental bands 1 and 2 have been observed , the dynamic moments of inertia of calculated configurations are equal to @xmath81 mev@xmath79 ; the quantity which is much larger than in experiment . at higher frequencies </S>",
    "<S> there is smooth increase of @xmath4 up to @xmath82 mev@xmath79 at @xmath83 mev , possibly caused by unpaired band interaction . </S>",
    "<S> no experimental counterparts of these configurations have been observed so far .    </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to mention the similarity of the single - particle spectra at hyperdeformation obtained in the crmf calculations ( fig .   </S>",
    "<S> [ routh - hd ] ) and in the wood - saxon - strutinsky calculations of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ( fig .  4 and 5 of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) </S>",
    "<S> . however , the @xmath84 ( @xmath85 and @xmath86 ) shell gaps are somewhat smaller ( larger ) in the crmf calculations . in the later calculations , </S>",
    "<S> the quadrupole , octupole , hexadecapole and necking degrees of freedom were taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> there are , however , no indications that octupole deformation should play a role at hd in @xmath0cd @xcite . on the other side , </S>",
    "<S> the crmf calculations take into account all even - multipole deformations and triaxiality in a fully self - consistent way . </S>",
    "<S> the basis of the crmf model is sufficiently large to see if there is a pronounced tendency for the development of necking . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ density ] , showing the densities of lowest hd configuration , does not indicate such a tendency .    </S>",
    "<S> the cns calculations , which will not be discussed here in detail , also indicate that the band 1 in @xmath0cd is associated with the @xmath27 configuration having @xmath87 @xmath40b and located in the @xmath88 minimum . </S>",
    "<S> similar to earlier calculations ( ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) , the triaxiality is more pronounced in the cns calculations for @xmath0cd as compared with the crmf ones . in the cns calculations , </S>",
    "<S> the hd configurations are yrast above @xmath89 , and the @xmath70 configurations with @xmath90 @xmath40b are the lowest ones . </S>",
    "<S> thus , one can conclude that general properties of sd and hd bands are similar in both approaches .    </S>",
    "<S> the present crmf calculations suggest that in the spin range where the feeding of sd bands takes place ( i ) the sd bands are non - yrast and ( ii ) the hd bands compete in energy with the sd bands </S>",
    "<S> . however , only sd bands have been reported at high spin in refs .  @xcite . because of limited experimental information it is difficult to find unique explanation for this discrepancy . </S>",
    "<S> on one side , one would expect that the calculated relative energies of different minima deviate somewhat from reality . </S>",
    "<S> alternative explanation is related to the differences in feeding mechanism of sd and hd bands @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although the hd and sd states are comparable in energy at @xmath91 at zero temperature ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eld ] ) , these high spin nuclear states are populated at somewhat higher spin at temperatures @xmath92 mev . at these temperatures , </S>",
    "<S> the deformed shell structure melts , and thus sd minimum becomes lower in energy than hd one . as a consequence , the feeding of the sd minimum maybe the dominant population channel @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in summary , the detailed analysis of the structure of observed superdeformed bands 1 and 2 in @xmath0cd within the cranked relativistic mean field theory led to new configuration assignment : both bands have been assigned the @xmath27 configurations . </S>",
    "<S> the band crossings seen in these bands have been related to the unpaired crossings of the lowest proton @xmath15 orbital and the @xmath93 orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> the size of the @xmath14 sd shell gap , which is smaller than that of doubly magic @xmath94zn and @xmath1dy sd nuclei , and the absence of large neutron shell gap at @xmath95 indicate that the @xmath0cd nucleus can not be considered as a doubly magic sd nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> the properties of hyperdeformed configurations , which are expected to be yrast above @xmath96 , have also been discussed . </S>"
