    "we wish to answer the question whether the triple - meson scattering could be seen in three @xmath12 or three @xmath13 production . in order to answer the question one has to obtain cross section for meson production , taking into account @xmath14 hadronization and acceptance of the existing detectors .",

    "only the dominant at high - energies gluon - gluon fusion partonic subprocesses are taken into account .",
    ", scaledwidth=100.0% ]    the triple - parton scattering ( tps ) mechanism for @xmath15 reaction is schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] . the corresponding inclusive tps cross section in a general form @xcite can be written as follows : @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 are the longitudinal momentum fractions , @xmath19 are the renormalization / factorization scales , @xmath20 are the partonic cross sections for @xmath21 mechanism and @xmath22 is the combinatorial factor relevant for the case of the three identical final states .",
    "the above tps hadronic cross section is expressed in terms of the so - called triple - gluon distribution functions @xmath23 that contain additional informations about positions @xmath24 of the three corresponding partons in the transverse plain of the colliding protons .",
    "the triple parton distribution functions ( triple pdfs ) shall account for all possible correlations between the partons , not only kinematical and spatial one , but also including spin and color / flavor correlations .",
    "the mpi theory in this general form is well established ( see _ e.g. _ refs .",
    "@xcite ) but not yet fully applicable for phenomenological studies .",
    "the objects like triple pdfs ( and even double pdfs in the case of dps ) are under intense theoretical studies but their adoption to real process calculations is still limited .",
    "therefore , in practice one usually follows the so - called factorized ansatz , where the correlations between partons are neglected and longitudinal and transverse degrees of freedom are separated . according to these approximations the triple - gluon pdfs from eq .",
    "( [ hardab ] ) take the following form : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the product of single gluon pdfs and @xmath27 describe the gluon distributions in transverse plane .",
    "the transverse factors @xmath27 of the two triple - gluon pdfs in eq.([dxf ] ) are connected to the proton - proton overlap function via the following relation : @xmath28 and are usually assumed to be universal for all types of partons .",
    "taking all together , the formula for inclusive tps cross section ( eq .  ( [ hardab ] ) ) can be simplified to the pocket form : @xmath29 where the triple - parton scattering normalization factor @xmath30 is related to the overlap function from eq .",
    "( [ f ] ) via the following expression : @xmath31^{-1}\\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : sigmaefftps}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the normalization factor @xmath30 contains all unknowns about the tps dynamics .",
    "its pure geometrical interpretation comes from the practical approximations of the factorized ansatz mentioned above . in principle , taking into account various parton correlations as well as multi - parton pdf sum rules @xcite or including perturbative - parton - splitting contributions @xcite may lead to a breaking of the pocket - formula .",
    "however , most of the violation sources are expected to vanish for processes driven by small-@xmath32 partons ( see _ e.g. _ refs .",
    "@xcite ) , that is exactly the case of charm production at high energies . as was shown by us , _",
    "e.g. _ in ref .",
    "@xcite , the factorized framework seems to be sufficient to explain the lhcb double charm data .",
    "therefore , we think that it can be safely used , at least as a starting point , to draw practical conclusions also in the case of triple charm production .    in principle , the dps normalization factor @xmath33 was extracted experimentally from several tevatron and lhc measurements ( see _ e.g. _ refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) and its world average value is @xmath34 mb can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . ] .",
    "such experimental inputs are not available for @xmath30 in studies of triple - parton scattering . however , as was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite for proton - proton collisions , the latter quantity can be expressed in terms of their more known dps counterpart : @xmath35 the relation is valid for different ( typical ) parton transverse profiles of proton . in the numerical calculations below we take @xmath36 mb which is rather a conservative choice but it corresponds to the average value extracted by the lhcb experiment only from the double charm data @xcite .",
    "this input gives us the value of @xmath37 mb .    in this paper , each of the single - parton scattering cross sections @xmath38 in eq .",
    "( [ doubleab ] ) is calculated in the @xmath0-factorization approach @xcite where higher - order qcd corrections are effectively included . in this framework",
    "exact kinematics is kept from the very beginning and additional hard dynamics coming form transverse momenta of incident partons is taken into account .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that within this approach one can get a good description of the lhc inclusive charm data , similar to the case of next - to - leading order ( nlo ) collinear calculations .",
    "likewise , the successful theoretical analyses of double charm production from refs .",
    "@xcite were also based on the @xmath0-factorization .    according to this approach",
    "the differential sps cross section for inclusive single @xmath1 pair production can be written as : @xmath39 where the extra , compared to collinear factorization , integrals over transverse momenta @xmath40 of initial state particles appear .",

    "the usual approximation here is that the quark rapidities @xmath58 are unchanged in the fragmentation process which is known to be especially legitimate in the case of heavy flavors and meson transverse momenta larger than its mass ( see _ e.g. _ ref .",
