    "the distribution of satellite galaxies around the milky way ( mw ) is highly anisotropic @xcite .",

    "the proper motions ( pms ) of the 11 brightest mw satellite galaxies reveal that almost all of these orbit within the vpos in the same direction , such that the satellite plane appears to be rotationally stabilised @xcite .",
    "in addition , globular clusters ( gcs ) classified as young halo ( yh ) objects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "[ fig : vposcircleplot ] shows the alignment of mw satellite galaxies by plotting their positions and velocities in a coordinate system motivated by the vpos .",

    "@xmath2  increases towards the galactic north .",
    "this choice makes it aligned with the preferred orbital direction of satellites in the vpos .",
    "also plotted are the radial velocities of the satellites with respect to the galactic center and , if pms are available , the tangential velocity component projected into the vpos plane .",

    "as satellite objects orbit around the mw , they may be disrupted by tidal forces acting on them and the material ( stars or gas ) they lose is spread out along streams .",

    "these streams are also of importance with respect to the anisotropy of the mw satellites , because they reveal the orientation of the orbital plane of their progenitor .",
    "@xcite discovered that half of the then - known stellar and gaseous streams in the mw halo align with the vpos , including the magellanic stream ( ms ) .",
    "thus these very different objects support the orbital alignment found using the satellite galaxy pms .    a similar planar satellite galaxy structure , albeit consisting of only about half the satellite population , exists around the andromeda galaxy m31 @xcite .",
    "this great plane of andromeda ( gpoa ) is seen edge - on from the mw and most of the satellite galaxies belonging to the gpoa share a common line - of - sight velocity trend , indicative of a co - orbiting satellite plane .",
    "@xcite have pointed out that the gpoa also aligns with stellar structures in the halo of m31 : the giant stream ( gs ) , which also shares the common velocity trend seen in the satellite galaxies , and the north - west stream 1 ( nw - s1 ) .    in addition to these satellite structures around the two major local group galaxies , alignments of several satellite galaxies , often also aligned with stellar and gaseous streams , have been found around more distant hosts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "write  in review , in the few instances around nearby major galaxies where we have information , in every case there is evidence that gas poor companions lie in flattened distributions ",

    "while it is not unlikely that a randomly positioned object is within @xmath13  of a given plane ( @xmath14 ) , it is much less likely that a randomly oriented orbital plane aligns to @xmath15  ( @xmath16 ) .",

    "this object has been discovered independently in two different surveys . @xcite found it in the photometric pan - starrs 3@xmath20  survey and termed it pso j174.0675 - 10.8774 .",
    "they measure a heliocentric distance of @xmath21kpc using the red horizontal branch and determine the object s absolute magnitude to be @xmath22 , corresponding to a luminosity of @xmath23 .",
    "they also determine the object s structural parameters and argue that it is too round and compact to be consistent with the known mw dwarf galaxies , and that its metallicity and age are similar to those of known yh gcs in the outer mw halo .",
    "they interpret the object to be the most distant known mw gc .",
    "independently , @xcite found this object in the photometric vst atlas survey and termed it crater .",
    "using red clump stars they determine a larger heliocentric distance of 170kpc and a total absolute magnitude of @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "they measure a larger half - light radius than @xcite , 30pc compared to 20pc , and interpret several blue stars as blue loop stars , indicative of recent star formation , which is why they prefer to interpret the object as a dwarf galaxy . for reasons of readability , in the following we will adopt the name crater for this object , irrespective of whether it is a gc or a dwarf galaxy .",
    "while the object s structural properties do not allow a decisive categorization as an extended ( young ) gc or a compact dwarf galaxy , the exact classification is not essential for the following analysis .",
    "it can be expected that the object is part of the vpos in either case , because that structure consists of both dwarf galaxies and yh gcs .",
    "crater s estimated age of 8 to 10gyr from @xcite is consistent with the suggested formation time for the vpos from the debris of a major galaxy encounter @xcite .",
    "such events not only produced tdgs , but also super star clusters that might evolve into gcs @xcite . this is consistent with the similar planar alignment found for the yh gcs .",
    "thus , in the tdg scenario the existence of transition objects between these two classes might not be too surprising .    for the following analysis",
    "we adopt crater s position and distance modulus from table 1 in @xcite .",
    "we thus assume the larger of the two distance estimates , because this makes the plane offsets measured for crater upper limits .",
    "additionally , at the larger distance crater has more impact on a plane - fit ( only 5 of 27 known satellite galaxies are farther away ) .",
    "crater s position vector from the galactic center is @xmath26  inclined relative to the vposall ( @xmath27  if randomly positioned ) , the best - fitting plane to all 27 mw satellites considered in @xcite , while the absolute offset from that plane is 65kpc .",
    "it is only @xmath28  ( @xmath29 ) away from the vpos-3 , the plane fit excluding three apparently unrelated satellite outliers @xcite , which aligns better with the average orbital plane of the mw satellites co - orbiting in the vpos @xcite .",
    "crater is offset by @xmath30kpc from this vpos-3 plane .",

    "the new vpos-3 plane normal is only @xmath34  away from the orbital pole of the large magellanic cloud ( @xmath35 ) and the new vposall normal coincides to better than @xmath36  ( @xmath37 ) with the average direction of the stream normals ( sect .",

    "following the method presented in @xcite , we determine the stream normal vectors for three new mw streams .",
    "a stream normal describes the orientation of the orbital plane of a stream , which is the plane containing two anchor points on the stream and the galactic center .",

    "[ fig : asp ] shows the resulting stream - normal directions together with the vpos plane - normal directions and satellite orbital poles . for this plot",
    "only long streams which cover at least @xmath67  on the sky are considered , because shorter streams do not reliably trace the orbital plane of a stream . as was shown by @xcite ,",
    "streams close to the sun are biased to lying outside of the vpos .",

    "this direction is almost identical to the normal of the plane fitted to all known mw satellite galaxies and crater ( vposall ) .",
    "even though one direction is determined from satellite positions while the other is defined by the orientations of streams from disrupted objects , both describe a very similar orientation .",
    "eight of the 14 streams in this plot align to @xmath72  with the vposall ( @xmath66  for an individual stream , probability of 0.015% to have 8 out of 14 randomly oriented streams align this well with an independently defined direction ) .",
    "the excellent alignment of sextans most - likely orbital pole and the orphan stream normal is probably coincidental , because the part of the stream close to sextan s position is considerably closer to the sun ( @xmath73kpc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) than the satellite galaxy ( @xmath74kpc ; * ? ? ?",

    "we discuss the adopted data for the new streams and their orientations . for more information on the other streams we refer the reader to the discussion in sect .",
    "3.2 of @xcite .",

    "its narrow width suggests a gc origin .",
    "@xcite report that a great circle with a pole at @xmath75  aligns well with the stream on the sky .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath76  in galactic coordinates ( red cross in fig .",
    "[ fig : asp ] ) , which is close to the vpos-3 normal direction and very close to the vposall .",
    "as seen from the sun , this stream thus aligns closely with the vpos .    according to @xcite ,",
    "the stream s signal - to - noise in a background - subtracted density map is optimized if a distance of 20kpc is adopted .",
    "consequently parallax effects can not be ignored because the stream does not orbit around the sun but around the galactic center . to determine the stream normal s orientation we follow the method presented in @xcite .",
    "we estimate the stream anchor point positions from fig . 1 of @xcite to be @xmath77  and @xmath78 . the uncertainty in the anchor - point positions is assumed to be @xmath79",
    "the distance to both anchor points is first assumed to be 20kpc , while we adopted a distance uncertainty of @xmath80kpc for each anchor point individually .",
    "the parallax effect moves the stream normal a bit away from the vpos pole ( toward the north in fig .",
    "[ fig : asp ] ) .",
    "the resulting stream normal direction , the vector perpendicular to the plane described by the two anchor points and the galactic center , points to @xmath81 .",
    "the atlas stream is almost polar with respect to the mw disk and is aligned with the vpos to @xmath18  ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "increasing the adopted stream anchor point distance improves the alignment with the vpos again , the stream normal moves toward the pole of the great circle defined by the stream on the sky ( red cross in fig .",
    "[ fig : asp ] ) , with which it would coincide if the distance were infinite .",
    "interestingly the new atlas stream has almost the same orientation as the well - known palomar 5 stream , as revealed by the match of its stream normal with that of palomar 5 pointing to @xmath82  and the overlap of both stream normal s uncertainty contours .",
    "if the distance estimate to the atlas stream by @xcite is correct , it is possible that both streams orbit in exactly the same plane , and in addition both streams would have a very similar galactocentric distance of @xmath73kpc .",
    "furthermore , palomar 5 s metallicity is [ fe / h ] = -1.41 @xcite . independently of this , @xcite argue that such a metallicity is consistent with the noisy color - magnitude diagram of the atlas stream when discussing a possible association of the stream with the @xmath83-distant gc pyxis . however , palomar 5 is about @xmath84  away from the center of the observed atlas stream segment .",
    "streams of similar angular extent are the more nearby @xmath85  long and narrow gd-1 stream @xcite and the wider sagittarius stream , which wraps at least once around the mw ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but it will require numerical models to test if and under which conditions palomar 5 might have formed such a long stream .",
    "if the atlas stream were a distant part of the palomar 5 stream , this would increase that streams s known extent to more than @xmath84  on the sky and thus provide extremely detailed constraints for the modelling of palomar 5 s orbit , which would be very helpful for attempts to determine the mw potential from fitting stellar streams ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "another possible association can be suspected from the stream s closeness to the dsph mw satellite fornax ( see fig . 1 in @xcite ) .",
    "curiously , this apparent alignment is not only present in the position on the sky . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : asp ] , the atlas stream normal and the orbital pole of fornax , situated at @xmath86 @xcite , are only @xmath87  ( @xmath88 ) apart . thus fornax orbits the mw approximately in the plane defined by the stream .",
    "this suggest a possible scenario in which the atlas stream s progenitor was a gc that once belonged to fornax . however , fornax is at a distance of @xmath89kpc , much farther away than the stream according to the estimate by @xcite . if instead the stream were at a distance of @xmath90kpc , its stream normal ( open red star in fig .",
    "[ fig : asp ] ) and the orbital pole of fornax would match up perfectly .",
    "fornax is co - orbiting in the vpos , while averaging the three available pm measurements for palomar 5 @xcite indicates that this gc is counter - orbiting , more like the dsph satellite sculptor .",
    "therefore one of these two possible associations could be ruled out if the direction of motion of the atlas stream can be determined .",
    "this stream has been discovered by both @xcite , who named it the triangulum stream , and @xcite , who named it the pisces stream . the same stream has been detected in the pandas survey @xcite .",
    "due to its narrow width it probably originates from a gc .",
    "we use the stream s start and end - positions reported by @xcite as our stream anchor points : @xmath91  and @xmath92 . the uncertainty in the anchor - point positions is assumed to be @xmath79 .",
    "the distance to both anchor points is assumed to be 35kpc , with an adopted distance uncertainty of @xmath93kpc , again adopted from @xcite .",
    "this places the most likely stream normal at @xmath94 , @xmath95  ( @xmath96 ) away from the vposall and @xmath97  ( @xmath98 ) away from the vpos-3 .",
    "it does not align with the vpos .",
    "this stream has been discovered in the deep photometric pandas survey centered on m31 by @xcite , who estimate its width to be several hundred parsec , such that its most likely progenitor is a dwarf galaxy .",
    "we estimate the stream anchor points from fig . 2 of @xcite to be @xmath99  and",
    "@xmath100  in the m31-centric coordinates @xmath101 . to convert these to equatorial coordinates @xmath102 , we add the position of m31 @xmath103 , to these : @xmath104 .",
    "we adopt @xmath79  uncertainties in the anchor - point positions .",
    "following @xcite we adopt an average distance to the stream of 17kpc .",
    "however , to incorporate the likely distance gradient along the stream reported by @xcite , we assume the start point to be 1.5kpc more distant than this and the end point to be 1.5kpc closer . the distance uncertainty is assumed to be @xmath93kpc for both anchor points independently .    the most likely stream pole then is @xmath105 , @xmath106  ( @xmath107 ) away from the vposall and @xmath108  ( @xmath109 ) away from the vpos-3 .",
    "the pandas mw stream is therefore almost co - planar with the disk of the mw , as already noted by @xcite .",
    "the stream does not align with the vpos , which is not surprising because the direction to m31 points @xmath110  ( @xmath111 ) away from the vpos @xcite , such that any stream discovered in this direction must be outside of the structure .",
    "we have tested whether recently found stellar systems in the mw halo align with the vpos consisting of satellite galaxies , gcs and streams @xcite .",
    "the mw satellite object pso j174.0675 - 10.8774 / crater @xcite , sharing properties with both dsph satellite galaxies and gcs , is situated close to the vpos and can therefore be considered to be another member of this structure .",
    "we provide updated fits to the vpos - planes in table [ tab : vposfits ] .",
    "we have furthermore predicted the object s pm if it orbits within the vpos , as has been empirically found for most of the mw satellites for which pms have been measured @xcite .",
    "the atlas stream @xcite aligns well with the vpos .",
    "in addition to the previously suggested possible association of the stream with the gc pyxis , our work reveals two other possible connections .",
    "the stream might be related to the gc palomar 5 and its stream ( due to the almost perfect alignment of both stream s planes , similar distances , and consistent metallicity ) or to a gc that once belonged to the mw satellite galaxy fornax ( due to the very similar orientation of the satellite galaxy s orbital plane and the stream ) .",
    "the latter scenario would probably require that the stream is much more distant than currently estimated and will possibly be ruled out if deeper observations of the stream confirm its closeness .",
    "a determination of the stream s orbital direction would also be able to decide between these two scenarios .    whether one of these alignments is due to a real association remains to be seen .",
    "the fact that most satellite objects in the mw align with and move within the vpos certainly increases the chances of finding apparent alignments . however , the common alignment along the vpos itself already suggests a causal connection or common origin in a more fundamental sense .",
    "similar correlated structures of dwarf galaxies are known around an increasing number of host galaxies ( as compiled in table [ tab : satellitestructures ] ) .",
    "this emphasizes that the satellite system of the mw ( and that of m31 ) can not be an extreme statistical outlier from on average more isotropic satellite systems as expected from cosmological simulations @xcite .",
    "instead , observations appear to suggest that correlated satellite systems might even be the norm , with the corresponding implications for cosmology @xcite ."
