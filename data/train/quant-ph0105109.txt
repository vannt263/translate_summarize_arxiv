    "several scientists have worked in the past on the elaboration of axiomatic approaches to quantum mechanics and it would lead us to far to present in this paper an overview of all these approaches .",
    "it is however possible to indicate two specific lines that have inspired most of the ` traditional ' ones of these approaches .",
    "the first line of inspiration was the recovery of standard quantum mechanics in an axiomatic way . in the standard quantum formalism a state @xmath0 of an entity @xmath1",
    "is represented by the one dimensional subspace or the ray @xmath2 of a separable complex hilbert space @xmath3 .",
    "an experiment @xmath4 testing an observable is represented by a self adjoint operator @xmath5 on @xmath3 , and the set of outcomes of this experiment @xmath4 is the spectrum @xmath6 .",
    "measurable subsets @xmath7 represent the events ( in the sense of probability theory ) of outcomes .",
    "the interaction of the experiment @xmath4 with the physical entity being in state @xmath0 is described in the following way : ( 1 ) the probability for a specific event @xmath8 to occur if the entity is in a specific state @xmath0 is given by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the spectral projection corresponding to @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the unit vector in state @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the inproduct in the hilbert space @xmath3 ; ( 2 ) if the outcome is contained in @xmath11 , the state @xmath0 is changed to @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the ray generated by @xmath17 .",
    "this standard quantum mechanical formalism was the inspiration for most of the axiomatic approaches . in it , however , the structure of the set of states and of the experiments is derived from the structure of a complex separable hilbert space .",
    "the presence of this hilbert space is ad hoc , in the sense that there are no physically obvious and plausible reasons why the hilbert space structure should be at the origin of both the structure of the state space , as well as the structure of the experiments .",
    "this initiated the search for an axiomatic theory for quantum mechanics where the hilbert space structure would be derived from more general and physically more plausible axioms ( birkhoff and von neumann 1936 , zierler 1961 , mackey 1963 , piron 1964 , jauch 1968 , varadarajan 1968 , beltrametti and cassinelli 1981 ) . due to the original focus ( birkhoff and von neumann 1936 ) on the collection of ` experimental propositions ' of a physical entity - with the conviction that such an ` experimental proposition ' would be a good basic concept -",
    "most of the later axiomatics were constructed taking as their basic concept the set @xmath18 of experimental propositions concerning an entity @xmath1 .",
    "the first real breakthrough ( piron 1964 ) came with a theorem of constantin piron , who proved that if @xmath18 is a complete [ axiom 1 ] , orthocomplemented [ axiom 2 ] atomic [ axiom 3 ] lattice , which is weakly modular [ axiom 4 ] and satisfies the covering law [ axiom 5 ] , then each irreducible component of the lattice @xmath19 can be represented as the lattice of all ` biorthogonal ' subspaces of a vector space @xmath20 over a division ring @xmath21 ( with some other properties satisfied that we shall not explicit here ) .",
    "such a vector space is called an ` orthomodular space ' and also sometimes a ` generalized hilbert space ' .",
    "it can be shown that an infinite dimensional orthomodular space over a division ring which is the real or complex numbers , or the quaternions , is a hilbert space . for a long time there",
    "did not even exist any other example of an infinite dimensional orthomodular space .",
    "the search for a further characterization of the real , complex or quaternionic hilbert space started ( wilbur 1977 ) .",
    "then keller constructed a non classical orthomodular space ( keller 1980 ) , and recently solr could prove that any orthomodular space that contains an infinite orthonormal sequence is a real , complex or quaternionic hilbert space ( solr 1995 , holland 1995 ) .",
    "it is under investigation in which way this result of solr can be used to formulate new physically plausible axioms ( pulmannova 1994 , 1996 , holland 1995 , aerts and van steirteghem 1998 ) .",
    "a second line of inspiration could be called ` operationality ' . going along with",
    "the search for ` good ' axioms was also the idea of founding the basic notions for this axiomatics in a physically clear and operational way .",
    "` operationality ' means that the axioms should be introduced in such a way that they can be related to ` real physical operations ' that can be performed in the laboratory .",
    "we have to say some words about this philosophical preoccupation with operationality .",
    "a first triumph for the ` operational method ' was certainly the well known analysis of the concept of simultaneity in physics by albert einstein that was also at the origin of the einsteinian interpretation of relativity theory .",
    "standard quantum mechanics is an example of a very non - operational theory : the basic concept , the wave function , is in principle a mathematical object with no clear physical interpretation .",
    "the three approaches that have tried to formulate quantum mechanics operationally are , the geneva - brussels approach ( jauch 1968 , piron 1964 , 1976 , 1989 , 1990 , aerts 1981 , 1982 , 1983a , b ) , the amherst approach ( foulis and randall 1978 , 1981 , foulis , piron and randall 1981 , randall and foulis 1976 , 1978 , 1981 , 1983 ) , and the marburg approach ( ludwig 1983 , 1985 ) . in all three approaches different concepts have been used as basic notions and different aspects of the possibility of operational foundation have been investigated .",
    "the approach that we present in this paper has ` learned ' from these three and puts forward a new scheme that takes into account important results of the earlier approaches , but also gives new insights that have meanwhile grown out of the theoretical and experimental progress of the last decades ( e.g non locality is an experimental fact now and not a theoretical hypothesis any longer ) .",
    "we also want to be explicitly critical against a general attitude that we would classify as ` naive operationalism ' .",
    "as ` naive realism ' believes that reality is just like it appears to us and in this way ignores the problem related to the way we gather knowledge about this reality , ` naive operationalism ' believes that it is only our laboratory experiments that are ` real ' and the rest is a construction out of the data and structure that we gather from these laboratory experiments . the extreme weight that naive operationalism puts on the laboratory experiments as the only candidates for foundational concepts is somewhat similar to the positivist and empirist attitude in philosophy .",
    "meanwhile it is known that to make experiments we need a theory and that as a consequence there is no nice hierarchy in the way naive operationalism proposes .",
    "we agree with the naive operationalists that our contact with reality is our experience and hence our experiments . in this sense",
    "it is good to make the effort and try to introduce as many possible basic concepts that are directly linked to these experiences and/or experiments . on the other hand",
    "we are convinced of the fact that the overall structure of reality , although it comes to us partially and in a fragmented way through our immediate experience with it , is revealed to us much more by the combination of a great many different experiences and by the way these different experiences form coherent wholes and are interrelated and also by the way they structure our long term interaction with reality . in this sense",
    "we are also convinced of the fact that this overall contact with reality - which our immediate sense experience and hence also our concrete laboratory experiments are only one aspect of - reveals to us the global ontological structure of reality : ` the way things are ' and ` what is the calculus of being ' .",
    "it is by taking explicitly this fact into account that we will construct our foundational approach and in this sense we do not want to call it an ` operational ' approach - because operationalism is often interpreted as what we have called naive operationalism - but a realistic and operational approach .",
    "there is another aspect of our approach that we have to point out . as we have mentioned briefly in 1.1 .",
    ", most of quantum axiomatics have been influenced by the original article of birkhoff and von neumann , and as a consequence have chosen the concept of ` operational proposition ' as their basic concept ( called ` property ' in the geneva - brussels approach ) . in the amherst approach the concept of ` operation ' is primary , but here one also tries to derive ` operational propositions ' from this concept . we think that it is more fruitful to have more basic concepts than just the one of ` experimental proposition ' or ` operation ' .",
    "therefore we will found our approach on 5 basic concepts and/or structures : the states , the experiments , the outcomes , the probabilities and the symmetries .",
    "these basic concepts express the naive operationalist foundational aspects , the laboratory experiments , but are also used to derive a ` calculus of being ' , structuring the global reality as it is revealed to us from the overall structure of our experiences with it .      in standard quantum mechanics a sub entity of a big entity is described within the tensor product procedure of the corresponding hilbert spaces . as a consequence of the tensor product procedure there exists pure states ( the so called non - product states ) of the big entity that are such that if the big entity is in one of these pure states , the sub entity is not in a pure state .",
    "this is a deep problem in standard quantum mechanics that has not been solved in a satisfactory way . in this paper",
    "we present a possible solution to this problem that comes to the definition of a new ` completed ' quantum mechanics in hilbert space , were new ` pure ' states are introduced that can not be represented by rays of the corresponding hilbert spaces .",
    "we show how this solution follows naturally from the general approach that we have introduced and how it also is linked with earlier findings .",
    "we also want to mention that for those readers that are only interested in this newly introduced version of a ` completed ' quantum mechanics , but do not want to study the new formalism in detail , that we have written section  [ comquant ] in a self contained way .",
    "these readers might immediately switch to section  [ comquant ] .",
    "the object of our description is the situation of a physical entity @xmath1 in its most general way .",
    "the archetypical notions that we consider are the following :    * the states : * the physical entity @xmath1 ` is ' at each moment in a certain state @xmath22 .",
    "in our approach the states describe the reality of the entity and the structure of the set of states expresses the main part of the ` calculus of being ' .    * the experiments : * we gather knowledge about the entity by means of experiments @xmath23 that we can perform on it .",
    "the structure of the set of these experiments expresses the main part of the way we investigate the reality of the entity .    * the outcomes : * the structure of the possible outcomes ,",
    "i.e. the ways that the entity and the experiments performed on it can ` be ' and ` behave ' together , is at the root of our formalism .",
    "* the probabilities : * for many entities these possibilities for certain outcomes can be structured in a probabilistic theory , probability being the representation of the relative frequencies of repeated experiments .    *",
    "the symmetries : * the entity changes also when we do not disturb it by a measurement and these changes are governed by symmetry principles on the reality of the entity , expressing its relation with the rest of the world .",
    "these are the basic notions that we want to formalize in our approach .",
    "derived concepts will be introduced step by step .",
    "as we will see , an entity will be determined by a well defined set of relevant states , a well defined set of relevant experiments , a well defined set of relevant outcomes , and the way in which these experiments interact with the entity in a state to give rise to an outcome .",
    "this entity corresponds to a physical phenomenon of the real physical world . in this way",
    "it is clear that what we often will classify , in our intuitive classification of phenomena of the real world , by the same phenomenon , may correspond to different entities .",
    "similarly , one entity may also correspond to different phenomena . in the traditional philosophical scheme",
    "it could be said that entities are ` models ' of the phenomenon .",
    "however , we do not want to fix this traditional interpretation a priori , since we believe that a rigorous approach where an entity is defined by well defined sets of the basic ontological notions of phenomena ( states , experiments , outcomes , probabilities and symmetries ) , may well lead , also philosophically , to a better ` ontological ' classification .",
    "at a certain moment an entity @xmath1 is in a certain state @xmath22 .",
    "this state represents the reality of the entity at that moment . in this way",
    "we connect a well defined set of states @xmath24 to the entity @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath1 be an entity , then @xmath24 is the set of states of this entity @xmath1 . at each moment",
    "the entity @xmath1 ` is ' in a state @xmath25 , that will be referred to as the entity s ` actual ' state .",
    "this state @xmath22 represents the reality of the entity @xmath1 at that moment .",
    "we shall denote states by symbols @xmath26 .",
    "we gather our knowledge about the entity @xmath1 and we act upon the entity by means of experiments that can be performed on @xmath1 . a well defined set of relevant experiments that are connected to a given entity @xmath1 is denoted by @xmath27 and we will denote experiments by @xmath28 .",
    "let @xmath1 be an entity with a set of states @xmath24 .",
    "the set of experiments that we use to gather knowledge about @xmath1 and to act on @xmath1 is denoted by @xmath27 .",
    "if an entity is in a certain state @xmath29 and we perform an experiment @xmath30 , then an outcome @xmath31 occurs .",
    "different outcomes can possibly occur for an experiment @xmath32 on an entity @xmath1 in state @xmath22 .",
    "the set of possible outcomes for @xmath32 if @xmath1 is in @xmath22 is characteristic for the way in which the experiment and the entity interact , and will play a major role in our formalism .",
    "we denote this set of possible outcomes by @xmath33 .",
    "we denote by the non - empty set @xmath33 the set of possible outcomes for experiment @xmath32 if @xmath1 is in the state @xmath22 .",
    "we denote the set of all non empty sets of possible outcomes for @xmath1 being in state @xmath34 and performing the experiment @xmath35 by @xmath36 .",

    "the set of possible outcomes for all experiments , the entity @xmath1 being in state @xmath22 will be denoted by @xmath38 , and the set of all possible outcomes is denoted by @xmath39 .    in principle",
    "we could consider situations where @xmath40 , but in certain sense this would mean that the experiment @xmath32 in question is not really applicable to the entity in this state @xmath22 . since this is a non physical situation , we make the hypothesis that for @xmath41 we have @xmath42 .",
    "we represent mathematically the entity @xmath1 by a set of experiments @xmath43 , a set of states @xmath24 , a set of outcomes @xmath44 , and set of non - empty sets of outcomes @xmath45 .",
    "we denote the entity @xmath1 by @xmath46 and will call it a ` experiment state outcome entity ' , to indicate that the basic notions that we use to describe the entity are the experiments , the states and the outcomes . since we do not want to repeat each time the characterization ` experiment state outcome ' we will just write ` the entity @xmath46 ' in those cases that it does not lead to confusion .",
    "the archetypical situation that we consider is that of an entity @xmath47 that ` is ' in a state @xmath34 and whereon an experiment @xmath30 can be performed , that gives rise an outcome @xmath48 .",
    "there are natural structures on @xmath49 , on @xmath24 , on @xmath27 , and on @xmath44 .",
    "our method to formalize these structures is the following : first we introduce the physical ideas and then we define the mathematical structure expressing these physical ideas .",
    "we do this in such a way that the mathematical structure is independent of the physical interpretation , but that , if interpreted , it gives rise to the original physical ideas .",

    "but in a formalism like the one we propose here , the properties as well as the experiments that can be used to test these properties , are given from the start .",
    "it is against the ` rules of the game ' to introduce new experiments for the properties just with the aim of being able to distinguish them from all the others .",
    "so we must conclude that the completeness can a priori only be shown for the set of testable properties connected to a definite experiment .",

    "something peculiar happens , that has been remarked early in quantum mechanics , and has been studied in detail in ( aerts and daubechies 1978 , aerts 1981 , 1982 , 1984a ) .",
    "we will come back to the problem of the description of sub entities in the next section and a proposal for its solution will lead us to the formulation of an alternative quantum mechanics in hilbert space where additional ` pure ' states are introduced in a very natural way . let us first describe the non - problematic aspects of standard quantum mechanics .    for sake of simplicity of notations",
    "we consider a finite dimensional complex hilbert space , but it is easy to see that an analogous scheme can be formulated for the case of an separable infinite dimensional complex hilbert space . hence consider the @xmath449 dimensional complex hilbert space @xmath3 .",
    "let us first introduce some concepts of the hilbert space that we will use in the following .    consider a separable complex hilbert space @xmath3 .",
    "we introduce the set of unit vectors , the set of rays , the set of orthogonal projections and the set of spectral families of the hilbert space : @xmath962 we will denote unit vectors by @xmath963 , rays by @xmath964 , orthogonal projections by @xmath965 , and spectral families by @xmath966 .",
    "for an entity that is described by this hilbert space in standard quantum theory a state @xmath0 is represented by a ray @xmath967 of the hilbert space ( this will not be the case anymore in the alternative completed quantum mechanics that we present in the next section ) .",
    "traditionally it is said that an experiment is described by a self adjoint operator .",
    "however , if we want to remain closer to the physical meaning , it is well known that we can better represent the experiment by means of the spectral family of orthogonal projections of this self adjoint operator .",
    "let s first mention the spectral theorem that makes both representations equivalent .    if @xmath5 is a self adjoint operator of an n dimensional complex hilbert space @xmath3 , then there exist distinct real numbers @xmath968 and a pairwise orthogonal set of nonzero projections @xmath969 such that @xmath970 which will be called a ` spectral family ' of the hilbert space @xmath3 .",
    "conversely , if @xmath971 is a set of distinct real numbers , and @xmath969 is a pairwise orthogonal set of nonzero projections and if the two above mentioned conditions are satisfied , and hence we have a spectral family , then @xmath971 is the set of distinct eigenvalues of @xmath5 , and for each @xmath972 , @xmath973 is the projection onto the eigen space corresponding to @xmath974 .",

    "we will not use the @xmath976 to indicate the outcomes , although we could do so , but it would show less the underlying structure of the outcomes . instead of this",
    "we identify an outcome @xmath977 in the quantum model with the eigen space @xmath973 of the hilbert space ( or with the orthogonal projector @xmath973 on this eigen space , we will not make a distinction ) .",
    "the set of all outcomes @xmath978 for the standard quantum model corresponds to the set of all orthogonal projections or equivalently the set of all closed subspaces of the hilbert space @xmath979 , which is a complete atomic orthocomplemented lattice . for an experiment @xmath980",
    "we have @xmath981 .",

    "let us consider the entity @xmath1099 described in the hilbert space @xmath3 and the entity @xmath1100 described in the hilbert space @xmath1101 and suppose that @xmath1 is a sub entity of @xmath444 .",
    "let us identify the connection functions @xmath1102 and @xmath972 .",

    "it is only met for some of the states of the big entity @xmath444 , namely for the product states .",
    "indeed if we consider a state @xmath1109 where @xmath1110 , the function @xmath447 can be defined as follows : @xmath1111 .",
    "but for a general state of @xmath444 , and especially a non product state , i.e. @xmath1109 , where @xmath1112 , this can not be done .",
    "let us consider the natural correspondence between the probabilities of the sub entity and the big entity , that defines that function @xmath972 , and see that also here we have a correspondence only in the case that the big entity is in a product state .",
    "consider a probability measure @xmath220 for the sub entity , the big entity being in a product state @xmath1113 with @xmath1110 .",
    "hence we have @xmath1114 .",
    "the corresponding probability measure @xmath913 for the big entity should be such that @xmath1115 . if we put @xmath1116 then this is satisfied .",
    "indeed we have @xmath1117 .",
    "so we can define @xmath1118 .",
    "the analysis we come to make means that the tensor product procedure of standard quantum mechanics can not be used to describe sub entities of the new approach . in ( aerts 1984b ) we show that some of the traditional axioms that lead to standard quantum mechanics are at the origin of this problem .",
    "more specifically these are the axioms of orthocomplementation , the covering law and the axiom of atomicity ( aerts 1984b ) .",
    "the problem of the description of compound entities and quantum axiomatics ( which includes the problem of the description of sub entities ) has also been identified in other axiomatic approaches ( randall and foulis 1981 , pulmannova 1983 , 1984 , 1985 , aerts and valckenborgh 1998 ) , and possibilities to replace the failing axioms are under investigation ( aerts and van steirteghem 1998 ) .",
    "what we will come up here now is a completely new possibility to solve this problem .",
    "if the ` solution ' that we propose here is correct this will automatically lead to the formulation of a new ` completed ' quantum mechanics in hilbert space .",
    "let us explain how we came to this possible solution .",
    "the main problem is that if the big entity is in a non product state represented by a ray of the tensor product hilbert space @xmath1119 , the sub entities are not in a state represented by a ray of one of the hilbert spaces @xmath3 or @xmath608 .",
    "this seems to indicate that the sub entities ` are not in a state ' even if the big entity ` is in a state ' .",
    "this is of course very difficult to imagine . indeed ,",
    "if a piece of reality ( the big entity ) is in a certain state , then also a ` piece ' of this ` piece ' of reality ( in this case the sub entities ) should be in a state .",
    "it is hard to conceive of a reality that would not satisfy such an elementary and fundamental property .",
    "let us indicate from now on the deep conceptual problem that we just come to state by ` the sub entity problem of standard quantum mechanics ' .",
    "we have to remark that this problem was known from the early days of quantum mechanics but concealed more or less by the confusion that often exists between pure states and mixtures .",
    "let us explain this first .",
    "the reality of a quantum entity in standard quantum mechanics is represented by a pure state , namely a ray of the corresponding hilbert space .",
    "so what we have called ` states ' in this article are often called ` pure states ' .",
    "mixed states ( what we also have called mixed states in this article - see section  [ mixedstat ] ) are represented in standard quantum mechanics by density matrices ( positive self adjoint operators with trace equal to 1 ) .",
    "but although a mixed state is also called a state it does not represent the reality of the entity under consideration , but a lack of knowledge about this reality .",
    "this means that if the entity is in a mixed state , it is actually in a pure state , and the mixed state just describes the lack of knowledge that we have about the pure state it is in .",
    "we have remarked that the deep conceptual problem that we indicate here was noticed already in the early days of quantum mechanics , but disguised by the existence of the two types of states , pure states and mixed states .",
    "indeed in most books on quantum mechanics it is mentioned that for the description of sub entities by means of the tensor product procedure it is so that the big entity can be in a pure state ( and a non product state is meant here ) such that the sub entities will be in mixed states and not in pure states ( see for example jauch 1968 section 11 - 8 and cohen - tannoudji 1973 , p 306 ) . the fact that the sub entities , although they are not in a pure state , are at least in a mixed state , seems at first sight to be some kind of a solution to the ` sub entity problem in standard quantum mechanics ' .",
    "although a little further reflection shows that it is not : indeed , if a sub entity is in a mixed state , it should anyhow be in a pure state , and this mixed state should just describe our lack of knowledge about this pure state .",
    "so the ` sub entity problem of standard quantum mechanics ' is not solved at all . probably because quantum mechanics is anyhow entailed with a lot of paradoxes and mysteries ,",
    "the deep problem of the sub entity description was unconsciously just added to the list by the majority of physicists",
    ".    way back , published in a paper in 1984 , we have shown already that in a more general approach we can define pure states for the sub entities , but they will not be ` atoms ' of the lattice of properties ( aerts 1984b ) . now it can easily be shown that within the general lattice approach ( very similar to the approach that we have exposed in this paper in section  [ statpropent ] ) standard quantum mechanics gives rise to an atomic property lattice , the rays of the hilbert space representing the atoms of the lattice ( see also theorem  [ sqatom ] of this paper which proves the ` state atomicity ' ) .",
    "this means that the non atomic pure states that we had identified in ( aerts 1984b ) can anyhow not been represented within the standard quantum mechanical formalism .",
    "we must admit that the finding of the existence of non atomic pure states in the 1984 paper , even from the point of view of generalized quantum formalisms , seemed also to us very far reaching and difficult to interpret physically .",
    "indeed intuitively it seems to be so that only atomic states should represent pure states .",
    "we know now that this is a wrong intuition .",
    "but to explain why we have to present first the other pieces of the puzzle .    a second piece of the puzzle appeared when in 1990 we built a model of a mechanistic classical laboratory situation violating bell inequalities with @xmath1120 , exactly ` in the same way ' as its violations by the epr experiments ( aerts 1990 ) . with this model we tried to show that bell inequalities can be violated in the macroscopic world with the same numerical value as the quantum violation .",
    "what is interesting for the problem of the description of sub entities is that new ` pure ' states were introduced in this model .",
    "we will see in a moment that the possibility of existence of these new states lead to a solution of the problem of the description of sub entities within a hilbert space setting but different from standard quantum mechanics .",
    "more pieces of the puzzle appeared steadily during the elaboration of the general formalism presented in the present paper .",
    "we started to work on this formalism during the first half of the eighties , reformulating and elaborating some of the concepts during the years .",
    "then it became clear that the new states introduced in ( aerts 1990 ) , although they are ` pure ' states in the model , they appear as non - atomic states in the general formalism .",
    "this made us understand that the first intuition that classified non - atomic states as no good candidates for pure states was a wrong intuition .",
    "let us present now the total scheme of our solution .",
    "we have introduced this example on earlier occasions ( aerts , 1986 , aerts 1990 , aerts and durt 1994 , aerts 1995 ) , and will use it here to illustrate the solution of the sub entity problem of standard quantum mechanics that we want to present and we will show how all the pieces of the puzzle fit together .",
    "the quantum machine is in fact a model for the spin of a spin @xmath1121 quantum entity .",
    "let us present it in some detail such that this section is self contained .",
    "the entity @xmath1122 that we consider is a point particle @xmath127 that can move on the surface of a sphere denoted by @xmath1123 with center @xmath320 ( the origin of a three dimensional real space ) and radius @xmath1124 .",

    "<S> we present a general formalism with the aim of describing the situation of an entity , how it is , how it reacts to experiments , how we can make statistics with it , and how it ` changes ' under the influence of the rest of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we base our formalism on the following basic notions : ( 1 ) the states of the entity ; they describe the modes of being of the entity , ( 2 ) the experiments that can be performed on the entity ; they describe how we act upon and collect knowledge about the entity , ( 3 ) the probabilities ; they describe our repeated experiments and the statistics of these repeated experiments , ( 4 ) the symmetries ; they describe the interactions of the entity with the external world without being experimented upon . starting from these basic notions </S>",
    "<S> we formulate the necessary derived notions : mixed states , mixed experiments and events , an eigen closure structure describing the properties of the entity , an ortho closure structure introducing an orthocomplementation , outcome determination , experiment determination , state determination and atomicity giving rise to some of the topological separation axioms for the closures . </S>",
    "<S> we define the notion of sub entity in a general way and identify the morphisms of our structure . </S>",
    "<S> we study specific examples in detail in the light of this formalism : a classical deterministic entity and a quantum entity described by the standard quantum mechanical formalism . </S>",
    "<S> we present a possible solution to the problem of the description of sub entities within the standard quantum mechanical procedure using the tensor product of the hilbert spaces , by introducing a new completed quantum mechanics in hilbert space , were new ` pure ' states are introduced , not represented by rays of the hilbert space .    </S>",
