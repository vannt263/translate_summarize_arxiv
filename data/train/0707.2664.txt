    "the accumulating astronomical evidence for an accelerating cosmic expansion has stimulated many investigations into the nature of the dark energy , or other possible deviant gravitational effects , which might be responsible for this unexpected dynamics ( for a review see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) . besides proposing to add some new ( and purely theoretical ) matter species into the energy budget of the universe ,",
    "many investigators have also focused their attentions on modifying general relativity ( gr ) on the largest scales , so as to introduce significant modifications in the behaviour of gravity at late times when it is comparatively weak .",
    "one example of the latter sort is provided by the family of @xmath3 gravity models , which had also been considered before the discovery of cosmic acceleration ( see for example refs .",
    "@xcite ) with reference to alternative forms of inflation and the existence of singularities . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the authors discuss a specific model where the correction to gr is a polynomial function of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 quadratic curvature invariants ( here , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are respectively the ricci scalar , ricci tensor and riemann tensor calculated in the standard way from the physical metric @xmath8 ) and showed that there exist late - time accelerating attractors in friedmann cosmological solutions to the theory .",
    "barrow and clifton established the general existence conditions for de sitter , einstein static , gdel universes in theories where the lagrangian is an arbitrary function of these three invariants @xcite .",
    "when the ricci scalar @xmath9 in the einstein - hilbert action is replaced by some general functions of @xmath9 and @xmath10 , it becomes necessary to distinguish between two different variational approaches to deriving the field equations . in the metric approach , as in refs .",
    "@xcite , the metric components @xmath8 are the only variational quantities and the field equations are generally of fourth - order , which makes the theories phenomenologically richer but more stringently constrained in most cases . within the palatini variational approach , on the other hand , we treat the metric @xmath8 and the connection @xmath11 as independent variables and extremize the action with respect to both of them ; the resulting field equations are second order and easier to solve .",
    "the palatini @xmath3 gravity is also proposed as an alternative to dark energy in a series of works @xcite .",
    "there has since been growing interest in these modified gravity theories : for the local tests of the palatini and metric @xmath3 gravity models see @xcite ; for the cosmologies of these two classes of models see @xcite .    both approaches to modifying gravity",
    "are far from problem - free . in the metric @xmath3 gravity models ,",
    "the theory is conformally related to standard gr plus a self - interacting scalar field @xcite , which generally introduces extra forces inconsistent with solar system tests @xcite .",
    "the palatini approach , on the other hand , generally leads to a large ( or even negative ) sound - speed - squared term in the growth equation of the non - relativistic matter perturbations on small scales .",
    "this induces effects on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and the matter clustering power - spectra which deviate unacceptably from those which are observed @xcite .",
    "again , these examples highlight the difficulties encountered when trying to make modifications to standard gr which are compatible with observations .",
    "in this work we will focus on the ricci - squared gravity models within the palatini variational approach , which we also denote by the @xmath12 gravity .",
    "it turns out that the ricci tensor , @xmath13 and ricci scalar , @xmath14 , appearing in the field equations in the palatini approach are not the ones calculated from the physical metric , @xmath8 , ( we consider the metric @xmath8 as the physical one because it is this metric which the matter lagrangian density @xmath15 depends on and the energy - momentum conservation law holds with respect to ) as in gr , and we denote the gr equivalents by @xmath16 and @xmath9 respectively to distinguish them from the palatini quantities ) .",
    "such a modification of gravity has indeed been considered in @xcite and shown to give an accelerating cosmology .",
    "however , our work differs from @xcite in that we replace the ricci scalar in the gravitational action with @xmath17 rather than simply @xmath18 and we concentrate more on the cosmology at the first - order perturbation level , especially the late - time cold - dark - matter ( cdm ) density perturbation growth .",
    "we emphasize the similarity to the palatini @xmath19 gravity models also .",
    "our presentation is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sect : equations ] we briefly introduce the model and outline the methods used to derive the background and first - order covariant and gauge - invariant ( cgi ) perturbed field equations . in sec .  [ sect : background ] , we present the modified friedmann equation and apply it to a specific family of theories with @xmath20 ; the constraints on the parameter space @xmath21 from cosmological data are also given .",
    "then , in sec .  [ sect : perturbations ]",
    ", we analyse the growth of cdm density perturbations at late cosmological times for this model .",
    "since this analysis shares some similarities with the palatini @xmath19 gravity models , we also present a similar discussion of the latter for comparison .",
    "our discussion and conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "[ sect : conclusions ] .    throughout this work",

    "in this section we briefly introduce the main ingredients of @xmath12 gravity and outline the strategy for deriving the general perturbation equations that govern the dynamics of small inhomogeneities in the cosmological models that arise in this theory .",

    "just like in the palatini @xmath46 models , this equation implies some relation between the physical metric @xmath8 and the metric @xmath47 whose christoffel symbol is @xmath40 .",
    "however , because of the presence of the second term in the parentheses this relation is nontrivial and some further algebra will be needed to explicate it . before doing that , we will present some preliminary definitions and expressions , one of which is the notation of @xmath48 decomposition .",
    "the main idea of @xmath48 decomposition @xcite is to make spacetime splits of physical quantities with respect to the 4-velocity @xmath49 of an observer .",

    "for example , the covariant spatial derivative @xmath52 of a tensor field @xmath53 is defined as @xmath54    the energy - momentum tensor and covariant derivative of the 4-velocity are decomposed respectively as @xmath55 in the above , @xmath56 is the projected symmetric trace - free ( pstf ) anisotropic stress , @xmath57 the heat flux vector , @xmath58 the isotropic pressure , @xmath59 the pstf shear tensor , @xmath60}$ ] , is the vorticity , @xmath61 ( @xmath62 is defined here as the mean expansion scale factor ) the volume expansion rate scalar , and @xmath63 is the fluid acceleration ; the overdots denote time derivatives expressed as @xmath64 , brackets mean antisymmetrisation , and parentheses symmetrization .",

    ", the modification to gr might be parameterized as an effective energy - momentum tensor . in this case",
    "the formalism of these equations is preserved and one just needs to replace @xmath74 by the total effective quantities of the same sort : @xmath75 @xcite .      in eq .",

    "we need to express @xmath34 explicitly .",
    "this is easy to do in principle , because eq .",

    "thus we see that , similar to the case of palatini @xmath19 gravity model , a scale - dependent sound - speed - squared term also appears in the palatini @xmath12 gravity model , whose sign depends on @xmath293 .",
    "note that in the case of @xmath263 the metric @xmath47 ( eq .  ( [ eq:59 ] , [ eq:60 ] ) ) has the same form as that in the palatini @xmath19 model , and eq .",
    "( 63 ) reduces to eq .  ( 58 ) as expected .    in the general @xmath12 gravity models it is possible that @xmath294 , thus the scale - dependent effective sound - speed - squared term influences the matter perturbation growth and",
    "could alter the shape of the predicted matter power spectrum .",
    "our previous knowledge derived from refs .",
    "@xcite suggests that this effect might allow observational data to place stringent constraints on the parameter space of these theories .",
    "in fact , we can give a rough estimate of how stringent the constraint can be .",
    "consider first eq .  ( [ eq:58 ] ) for the palatini @xmath19 model : since on small scales the @xmath295 term dominates the other terms in front of @xmath227 ( the @xmath296 terms ) , it is obvious that the magnitude of the quantity @xmath297 determines the deviation from @xmath195 results . the observational constraint on the model parameter @xmath179 ( recall that @xmath298 ) , as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , is @xmath299 ; we take @xmath300 and @xmath301 for illustrative purposes , and find that @xmath302 for the relevant redshift range of @xmath303 . in the analogous case of palatini",
    "@xmath12 gravity , eq .  ( [ eq:63 ] ) , we have @xmath304 as the dominant term instead of @xmath305 , and so the constraint should be @xmath306 in the same redshift range . again , taking @xmath301 , for the theories with @xmath20 we find that to satisfy the above constraint @xmath307 must also be limited to be @xmath308 or even smaller .",
    "thus , we conclude that the palatini @xmath12 models may be constrained by the observational data on the matter power spectrum just as stringently as are the palatini @xmath19 models . yet",
    ", we should note that a more exact quantitative constraint can only be obtained by exploiting a full parameter - space search as done in @xcite , and that the above conclusion depends on the assumption that the cdm particles have vanishing anisotropic stress .",
    "if , in contrast , the dark matter particles admit an anisotropic stress , in a manner similar to that prescribed in @xcite , then the effective sound - speed - squared terms might be canceled and leave no significant traces .",
    "we considered a general class of modified gravity models where the ricci scalar in the gravitational action of gr is replaced by a function @xmath17 and the field equations are derived using the palatini variational approach , _",
    "i.e. _ , treating the metric @xmath8 and connection @xmath40 as independent variables so that the action is varied with respect to both of them .",
    "the strategy for deriving the cosmological equations at both the background ( zero - order ) and the first - order perturbation levels is outlined .",
    "the main step in this process is to determine the metric , @xmath47 , whose levi - civita connection is @xmath309 , relate it to the physical metric @xmath8 and thereby fix the relation between @xmath34 and @xmath16 .",
    "then , the correction to gr is treated as a new effective energy - momentum tensor while the field equations take the same form as in gr .",
    "the formulae laid down here might be useful for the numerical implementations of such modified gravity models .",
    "we also investigated in detail a power - law correction to the usual einstein - hilbert action given by @xmath20 .",
    "we used the snia luminosity distance and cmb shift parameter data to constrain its ( independent ) two - parameter space @xmath310 .",
    "we found that at 95% confidence level @xmath311 $ ] and @xmath312 $ ] . a slightly positive value of @xmath179 ( @xmath313 ) is preferred by the data used",
    "however , the standard @xmath171 model ( equivalent to @xmath181 ) with @xmath314 is still within the 68% confidence contour .",
    "hence , although the best fit to the data is a non - null leading - order correction to einstein gravity , the current data exhibits no significant preference over the concordance @xmath171 model of gr .",
    "the late - time growth of matter density perturbations in general palatini @xmath315 gravity models was also studied .",
    "it was shown that the equations governing this class of models look very similar to that in the palatini @xmath19 models .",
    "in particular , there exists a scale - dependent effective sound - speed - squared term in the perturbation growth equation which may be either positive or negative , depending on the background evolution in both models . in the @xmath19 case",
    "it is well known that these terms can lead to strong scale - dependence of the matter power spectrum , which is highly constrained by observational data @xcite , and we expect a similar feature to exist in the @xmath12 case .",
    "we estimate that this will produce a strong observational bound of @xmath316 unless some exotic properties are added to the dark matter candidate @xcite .    as the final remark , we give a brief comment about the static and spherically - symmetric solutions of the present model .",
    "the analogue for the palatini @xmath19 model was considered in @xcite and the authors found that the exterior spherically - symmetric vacuum solutions are unique .",
    "here we just want to point out the @xmath317 model also shares this feature .",
    "in fact , in the vacuum where @xmath318 it is easy to show that for our model @xmath319 are uniquely determined by eqs .",
    "( [ eq:14 ] , [ eq:15 ] ) and so is @xmath34 .",
    "the full consideration of a static system also needs the interior solution and its matching the exterior , which is beyond the scope of this paper and will be left for further investigation .",
    "in this appendix we present the relation between @xmath130 and @xmath131 if the two metrics @xmath47 and @xmath320 satisfy the following relations @xmath321where @xmath161 is a scalar function and @xmath322 symmetric tensors .",
    "firstly , the requirement @xmath323 implies that @xmath324 then , with some algebra , and using eq .",
    "( [ eq : a4 ] ) , we can easily show that ( here a comma denotes the ordinary derivative ) @xmath325   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\gamma _ { bc}^{a}(g_{ab})+\\gamma _ { bc}^{a},\\end{aligned}\\]]where the difference between @xmath40 and @xmath326 , denoted @xmath327 is defined by @xmath328   \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{2}\\left [ \\zeta _ { b}^{a}\\nabla _ { c}\\lambda + \\zeta_{c}^{a}\\nabla_{b}\\lambda -g_{bc}\\zeta ^{ad}\\nabla _ { d}\\lambda \\right ]   \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{2\\lambda } \\left [ \\nabla _ { b}\\xi _ { c}^{a}+\\nabla_{c}\\xi_{b}^{a}-\\nabla ^{a}\\xi _ { bc}\\right ]   \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{2}\\zeta^{ad}[\\nabla_{c}\\xi_{bd}+\\nabla_{b}\\xi_{cd}-\\nabla_{d}\\xi_{bc}]\\end{aligned}\\]]and is a true tensor , as expected . from the definition in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) we can thus derive that @xmath329 note that @xmath34 differs from @xmath16 by a rank-2 symmetric tensor .",
