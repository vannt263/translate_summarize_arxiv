    "the minimal model is constructed with minimum numbers of parameters , while in the other approach minimum numbers of higgs scalars are included in the model .",

    "we shall digress to discuss one important feature of the left - right symmetric models , namely the question of parity @xmath27 .",

    "this definition extends to scalars also .",
    "that is , an @xmath5 doublet scalar field @xmath12 will transform to an @xmath6 doublet scalar field @xmath11 under the operation of parity @xmath30 . in the conventional left - right symmetric models , the parity is spontaneously broken along with the group @xmath6 . in other words , when the left - right symmetric group @xmath31 is spontaneously broken , parity is also spontaneously broken .",
    "there is another possibility of breaking parity spontaneously without breaking the left - right symmetric group .",
    "since the scalar fields transform trivially under the lorentz group , the vev of a parity odd field can break parity spontaneously without breaking the left - right symmetry .",
    "unlike the conventional case , now the parity acting on the fermions and vector bosons is not spontaneously broken . to distinguish these two cases , this second type of parity",
    "is called a @xmath1-parity .",
    "thus when @xmath1-parity is broken , the left - handed and right - handed scalars can have different mass and vev and hence the gauge coupling constants of @xmath5 and @xmath6 can also be different . in the present model @xmath1-parity",
    "plays a very crucial role , both for symmetry breaking as well as for fermion masses .",
    "it also plays some role in gauge coupling unification .",

    "we will have @xmath41 at a lower energy scale .",

    "all these higgs scalars @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are absent and hence there are no tree level fermion masses for the quarks and the leptons . after discussing the structure of the higgs vacuum expectation values in this model , we shall come back to the question of fermion masses .",
    "in the conventional left - right symmetric models , the combinations of the higgs fields , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 ensures that for certain choices of parameters , @xmath61 can acquire a very large vev compared to other fields breaking left - right symmetry at a large scale .",

    "[ sbpat ] , it is clear that in the present model there are no yukawa couplings giving dirac or majorana masses to the quarks and leptons . in this model both the majorana and the dirac masses",

    "to generate the operator @xmath102 , we need two fermions @xmath120 and @xmath121 coupling to @xmath122 and @xmath123 respectively .",
    "both these fields should then transform similarly @xmath124 or * 210 * and the lagrangian must contain the couplings @xmath125 to give masses to the up - quarks by the operator @xmath102 .",

    "<S> the yukawa sector of our model is completely different from most of the standard grand unified theories and we explicitly show how the yukawa sector will look like in the different phases and briefly comment on the running of the top quark mass . </S>",
