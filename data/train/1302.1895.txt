    "understanding the structure - property relationships of metallic glasses ( mg ) is a pressing matter in the field of material science@xcite .",
    "the culmination of past research reveals that the vast diversity of mg species , and their properties , are rooted in an equally - broad set of structural archetypes@xcite .",
    "perhaps even more cumbersome is a decades old outstanding problem in the study of glasses - namely explaining the extreme slowing of dynamics in a liquid as it is supercooled towards a glass transition @xcite .",
    "many theories , such as the theory of random first order transitions @xcite , spin glass approaches@xcite , and others@xcite predict the existence of rapidly growing length scales ( in particular , a static length scale ) to accompany the marked increase of the viscosity of supercooled liquids .",
    "in fact , there are rigorous results predicting the appearance of such lengths @xcite .",
    "while much progress@xcite has been made in studying the structures of various glass - forming systems , to date , no notable increase in standard static length scales has been observed in most studies .",
    "cu - zr is a popular representative of early transition metal - late transition metal mgs ; this is , in part , because it has a high glass forming ability ( gfa ) for a broad range of compositions @xcite .",
    "the binary composition of cu - zr reduces the complexity of the possible local atomic structures , making this system ideal for the study of the evolution of the spatial structure of liquids as they are supercooled to form a glass .",
    "recent research efforts demonstrate a structural hierarchy within cu - zr mgs that appears to be central to its structure - property relationships@xcite .",
    "strong evidence has been found to suggest that the presence of cu - centered full icosahedra is uniquely responsible for dynamical slowing during the formation of the cu - zr mgs@xcite . aside from their full and distorted icosahedral voronoi signatures ,",
    "the voronoi polyhedron landscapes of cu - zr in the liquid and glass phases resemble one another considerably@xcite .",
    "the icosahedral clusters often interpenetrate one another , so that five atoms coincide on two icosahedral - shells .",
    "these interpenetrating connections of icosahedra ( icoi ) exhibit strong spatial correlations@xcite and produce stable stringlike networks of icosahedra @xcite .",
    "extensive icoi clusters are found to posses a high average elastic rigidity @xcite and to enhance more general mechanical properties of cu - zr@xcite mg .    in light of the importance of icosahedral clusters and icoi in shaping cu - zr mg",
    ", it is pressing to consider the roles of non - interpenetrating connections in order to obtain a complete picture of icosahedral networking in this amorphous alloy . to date",
    ", the prominence of these connections has only been noted@xcite . in this paper , md simulations are used to study non - interpenetrating connections , and to characterize their effect on the connectivity and composition of icosahedral networks in cu - zr mgs , using cu@xmath0zr@xmath0 and cu@xmath1zr@xmath2 as models .",
    "our analysis reveals that , near the glass transition , a large number of non - interpenetrating connections develop amongst icoi - structures and significantly enhance the unification of icosahedral networks in these mgs , thus impacting their mechanical properties .",
    "considering the full icosahedral network affords us the rather unique opportunity to identify , in cu@xmath1zr@xmath2 , _ a percolating icosahedral network that threads the entire glassy system , providing a large scale static structure which grows rapidly as the system approaches the glass transition_. we also suggest that the non - interpenetrating connections are particularly influential in mgs like cu@xmath0zr@xmath0 , which exhibits relatively few icoi and yet is a good glass former .",
    "moreover , with all of the connection types being included , we reveal that the icosahedral network and the otherwise liquidlike matrix@xcite have significantly different chemical compositions . for example , vertex and face - sharing connections preferentially incorporate zr atoms , increasing the density of the icosahedral network . for both alloys , the icosahedral network is zr - rich , relative to the overall sytem composition , and is immersed in a cu - rich liquidlike matrix .    in section",
    "ii , we will proceed to discuss the methods for our models of cu - zr , md simulations , and structural analysis .",
    "section iii characterizes the basic icosahedral ordering in our systems as they are cooled from the liquid phase to the glass phase . in section",
    "iv we measure the population and distribution of connections in the icosahedral network .",
    "sections v , vi , and vii , respectively , presents weighted connectivities , introduces a static length scale , and details the chemical compositions of the icosahedral networks for cu@xmath0zr@xmath0 and cu@xmath1zr@xmath2 .",
    "the md simulations conducted in this study use a semi - empirical potential developed by mendelev et al , which describes many - body interactions using the finnis and sinclair ( fs ) generalization of the embedded atom method ( eam)@xcite .",
    "it was created , in part , by being fitted to x - ray diffraction data , liquid density , enthalpy of mixing data , and first - principles results .",
    "the potential was developed with an emphasis on describing both liquid and amorphous cu - zr alloys , and was shown to provide a very good description of the structures and some properties of the liquid and glass phases of cu@xmath3zr@xmath4 .",
    "an earlier version of this potential@xcite was also shown to produce reliable atomic structures for cu@xmath3zr@xmath4 mg when compared to atomic structures generated by the reverse monte carlo ( rmc ) method , which was constrained by independent x - ray diffraction data and ab initio md simulation results@xcite .",
    "the semi - empirical potential used in this paper accurately recreates the properties of pure zirconium and is expected to yield reasonable structures for cu@xmath0zr@xmath0 as well .",
    "accordingly , the structure factor data and voronoi polyhedra distribution obtained for this composition are in good agreement with the published x - ray and voronoi polyhedra data of m. li _",
    "et al_.@xcite(not shown ) .",
    "canonical ( @xmath5 ) systems of cu@xmath0zr@xmath0 and cu@xmath1zr@xmath2 were simulated using lammps@xcite .",
    "each simulation consists of 2000 atoms contained in a box with periodic boundaries .",
    "the initial configuration of an alloy is generated randomly , and the alloy is allowed to melt and evolve for .25 ns at 1600k , using 5 fs time steps .",
    "the alloy is subsequently quenched to its target temperature at a rate of @xmath6 k / s , with the volume of the simulation box set to yield zero pressure for this temperature .",
    "finally , the quenched alloy evolves for 1 ns at the target temperature , during which 78 snapshots of the atomic configuration are recorded .",
    "the target temperatures used range from 300 k to 1600 k in steps of 100 k. the process is repeated so that , ultimately , three simulations with independent initial configurations were carried out for each of the fourteen target temperatures . to check for system size effects , canonical systems with 10,000 atoms and a target temperature of 300 k",
    "were also simulated for both alloy compositions .",
    "the approximate values of the glass transition temperatures ( @xmath7 ) for cu@xmath0zr@xmath0 and cu@xmath1zr@xmath2 were found to be @xmath8 k and @xmath9 k , respectively .    an analogous @xmath10 simulation ( @xmath11 ) of cu@xmath0zr@xmath0 with a target temperature of 400 k was conducted for the sake of comparison .",
    "the resulting average partial pair correlation functions ( ppcs ) were found to be statistically identical to those from the corresponding @xmath5 simulations .",
    "the atomic structures in the md - generated alloys were characterized using voronoi polyhedron - analysis for each atom@xcite . using a procedure similar to that of hsu and rahman , cluster vertices that were separated by distances less than seven orders of magnitude of the simulation box edge length were consolidated into one vertex@xcite .",
    "300 k , data points are included for a system size of @xmath12 atoms in addition to @xmath13 atoms .",
    "the error bars indicate the standard deviation of the value .",
    "the glass transition temperatures are marked for the respective compositions.,scaledwidth=46.0% ]",
    "to study the development of icosahedral ordering in cu - zr , we consider the results of our voronoi tessellation analysis : a cu - atom with a voronoi index @xmath140,0,12,0@xmath15 and its 12 voronoi neighbors form a full icosahedral cluster . the index @xmath14@xmath16@xmath15 specifies the number of faces , @xmath17 , with @xmath18 edges present on the voronoi polyhedron .",
    "zr - centered full icosahedra are seldom observed amongst the voronoi polyhedra in these alloys , which is consistent with previous md studies , thus @xmath140,0,12,0@xmath15 clusters will henceforth refer only to cu - centered full icosahedra .",
    "figure  [ fig : icosorder ] displays for a range of temperatures the percent - abundance of atoms involved in @xmath140,0,12,0@xmath15 clusters . in their liquid phases above 1300 k , fewer than 10% of the atoms participate in @xmath140,0,12,0@xmath15 clusters for both compositions , but supercooling yields a great enhancement in the degree of icosahedral ordering .",
    "accordingly , roughly 28% and 53% of the atoms of glassy cu@xmath0zr@xmath0 and cu@xmath1zr@xmath2 , respectively , participate in the structure of full icosahedra ( including their center cu - atoms ) .",
    "this compositional trend of an increase in icosahedral ordering , and subsequently an increase in @xmath7 , that accompanies an increase in the fractional abundance of cu - atoms has been demonstrated and studied previously@xcite .",
    "below @xmath7 , we observe that approximately 8.6% of cu@xmath1zr@xmath2 s voronoi polyhedra in our simulation snapshots are @xmath140,0,12,0@xmath15 clusters . if these clusters were isolated from one another , it would require that 112% of the system s atoms participate in their structure .",
    "considering that only about 53% of this alloy s atoms are actually involved in these clusters , it is obvious that many clusters share atoms amongst one another and are thus joined together . therefore , two @xmath140,0,12,0@xmath15 clusters are defined to be ` connected ' if they share at least one atom .",
    "the inclusiveness of this definition will be justified as we further study the details of icosahedral structures .",
    "icosahedra in our simulated cu - zr alloys are observed sharing vertices , edges , and triangular faces in addition to exhibiting the interpenetrating connections described earlier .",
    "examples of these connections are depicted in figure  [ fig : connabun ] .",
    "we will study the creation of these connections between icosahedra during the process of quenching to understand how they form the mechanically - stiff icosahedral networks .",
    "figure  [ fig : connabun ] quantifies the development of connections between icosahedra as the cu - zr alloys are quenched from the liquid phase . figures  [ fig : connabun]a and  [ fig : connabun]b illustrate that as the number of icosahedra in a cu - zr alloy increases rapidly during supercooling ( refer to figure 1 ) , the proportion of those participating in these stable icoi grow comparably . above 1300k , less than a third of the icosahedra are involved in icoi for both alloys .",
    "the prevalence of icoi - based structures is heightened dramatically during supercooling , and once cu@xmath1zr@xmath2 and cu@xmath0zr@xmath0 are arrested in their glass phases , approximately 80% and 60% , respectively , of icosahedra have at least one interpenetrating connection .",
    "very few icosahedra are isolated in glassy cu - zr mgs , e.g , about 1.7% and 14% , respectively , in cu@xmath1zr@xmath2 ( fig .",
    "2a ) and cu@xmath0zr@xmath0 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : connabun]b ) . figures  [ fig : connabun]c and  [ fig : connabun]d display the relative abundance of each connection - type in the alloys .",
    "they show that vertex and face - sharing connections become increasingly prevalent as the alloys are quenched and enter their glass phases .",
    "for example , below @xmath7 in cu@xmath1zr@xmath2 , these connections are as common are icoi ( fig .",
    "[ fig : connabun]c ) .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the aforementioned results of figures  [ fig : connabun]a and  [ fig : connabun]b , indicating that , as the density of icosahedral clusters and the number of icoi increase during supercooling , vertex and face - sharing become prevalent amidst icoi - based structures .",
    "we will further study how these non - interpenetrating connections are incorporated into the icosahedral structures of cu - zr mg alloys .    above 1300 k",
    ", the connections between icosahedra are constantly forming and breaking ( as are the icosahedra themselves ) so that no single connection between two icosahedra is observed in consecutive snapshots ( separated by 13 ps ) of a simulation . viewing snapshots of the liquid alloys and assessing the average abundances of the different connection -",
    "types thus provides a measure of the relative prominences and stabilities of their resulting structures",
    ". figures  [ fig : connabun]c and  [ fig : connabun]d show , for temperatures above 1000 k , that icoi comprise more than 40% , a significant majority , of the connections present in both alloys .",
    "this provides strong evidence that the icoi is in fact more robust than the other types of connections and leads us to consider its role in the liquid alloys as they cool .",
    "it is incorrect , however , to think of the glassy icosahedral network as simple chains of interpenetrating icosahedra , as our considerations of figures  [ fig : connabun]c and  [ fig : connabun]d below @xmath7 demonstrate that these icoi structures also incorporate a significant number of non - interpenetrating connections , as we elaborate on next .",
    "to study the structures of the icosahedral networks found in cu - zr mgs , we begin by characterizing the formative icoi - structures . figures  [ fig : conndistr]a and  [ fig : conndistr]b show the average distribution of the number interpenetrating connections per icosahedron in the alloys at 300 k. as expected from our considerations of figure  [ fig : connabun ] , cu@xmath1zr@xmath2 contains more extensively connected icoi - structures than does cu@xmath0zr@xmath0 mg with an average of 2.2 interpenetrations per connected - icosahedron versus 1.5 , respectively .",
    "both compositions primarily exhibit chain - like and triangular arrangements of interpenetrating icosahedra .",
    "these connectivity measurements are corroborated and elaborated on by earlier studies@xcite .",
    "figures  [ fig : conndistr]c and  [ fig : conndistr]d incorporate all connection types , and provide a uniquely detailed characterization of the icosahedral - structures found in these mgs .",
    "they display the average distribution of the total number of connections per icosahedron , while distinguishing icosahedra that participate in icoi from those that do not . from this perspective , the average numbers of connections per interpenetrating icosahedron increase to 6.8 and 3.0 , respectively , for cu@xmath1zr@xmath2 and cu@xmath0zr@xmath0 .",
    "these distributions thus describe more intricate , highly connected networks than do to those in figures  [ fig : conndistr]a and  [ fig : conndistr]b .",
    "furthermore , it becomes clear that interpenetrating icosahedra frequently participate in other connection types and that they serve as the nodes with the highest connectivity in the icosahedral networks of the mgs .",
    "for example , in cu@xmath1zr@xmath2 a sizable fraction of icoi - icosahedra can be found participating in ten or more connections , while non - icoi - icosahedra are seldom found with more that six connections .",
    "it follows that significant number of non - interpenetrating connections must occur within and between icoi - structures .",
    "these highly connected nodes in the networks likely correspond to icosahedra with very low atomic mobilities , which are known to be responsible for dynamical slowing in these mgs@xcite .",
    "when inspecting such densely packed icosahedra , simulation snapshots reveal two common structures , which are illustrated in figure  [ fig : pinbridge ] . in `",
    "pinned ' structures ( figure  [ fig : pinbridge]a ) , a single extended icoi - structure is folded on itself so that non - adjacent ( non - interpenetrating ) icosahedra can be found to share vertices , edges , and faces with one another , `` pinning '' the fold , and producing a densely packed , stable , extended structure .",
    "a ` bridged ' structure ( figure  [ fig : pinbridge]b ) consists of proximate icoi - structures that are joined by non - interpenetrating connections .",
    "the roles of these bridging connections are of considerable interest since they serve to unify icosahedral networks and thus potentially affect the structure - property relationships of the mg . to demonstrate the significance of these bridging connections , we measured the weighted connectivities of the icosahedral networks .",
    "zr@xmath2 and ( b ) cu@xmath0zr@xmath0,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    , containing two connected subgraphs of sizes 4 and 3 , respectively .",
    "the weighted connectivity of @xmath19 is thus : @xmath20        consider the icosahedra of a cu - zr mg to be the nodes of a graph , @xmath19 , and their connections as the edges . that is",
    ", if two icosahedra share a vertex , edge , or face , or if they interpenetrate , then there is an edge between these two nodes .",
    "a connected subgraph , @xmath21 , of @xmath19 is defined to be a collection of nodes and their edges such that any two nodes in @xmath21 are joined by a path of edges and nodes , and that no edge connects to a node outside of @xmath21 .",
    "the size of @xmath21 is defined to be the number of nodes in @xmath21 . in this paper , an isolated node ( one without edges )",
    "will be considered a connected subgraph of size 1 .",
    "our graph , @xmath19 , is thus the union of all of its connected subgraphs .",
    "let \\{@xmath22}@xmath23 be the set of @xmath19 s @xmath24 connected subgraphs and \\{@xmath25}@xmath23 be the corresponding set of the sizes of the connected subgraphs .",
    "@xmath26 is the size of the largest subgraph(s ) ( @xmath27}@xmath23 ) ) .",
    "the weighted connectivity of @xmath19 is then defined to be @xmath28 thus a graph with @xmath29 corresponds to a completely connected graph .",
    "a heuristic example of a graph , its connected subgraphs , and its weighted connectivity is provided in figure  [ fig : examplegraph ] .",
    "figures  [ fig : connectivity]a and  [ fig : connectivity]b show the weighted connectivities of both the icoi - networks and the icosahedral networks that incorporate all connection types .",
    "it should immediately be pointed out that the decrease in weighted connectivity for high temperatures does not imply that the networks are highly connected prior to supercooling .",
    "rather , the relatively low degree of icosahedral ordering at these temperatures is responsible for the reduced measured connectivities . in both compositions of cu - zr , the non - interpenetrating connections that develop during supercooling",
    "dramatically enhance the unification of the networks .",
    "the effect of these connections is most obvious in cu@xmath1zr@xmath2 mg ( fig .  [",
    "fig : connectivity]a ) ; the weighted connectivity of the icosahedral network decreases rapidly as the alloy is cooled from 1100 k down to 800 k ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "in contrast to this , the weighted connectivity of the icoi - network is not so significantly affected by the supercooling process .",
    "this suggests that non - interpenetrating connections are integral in linking the disjoint pieces of the icoi - network as the alloy approaches its glass phase . in the case of cu@xmath1zr@xmath2 , these bridging connections lead to an almost completely unified icosahedral network .",
    "the same network - unification was observed when the system size was increased to @xmath12 atoms .",
    "the weighted connectivity of cu@xmath0zr@xmath0 s icosahedral network ( fig .",
    "[ fig : connectivity]b ) exhibits a similar enhancement in comparison to its icoi network , though network - unification is not observed in this alloy .",
    "these findings suggest that non - interpenetrating connections are an important facet of icosahedral networking in cu - zr mgs and perhaps in other mgs in which icosahedral ordering is prevalent .",
    "the heavy presence of these connections amidst the most highly - connected icosahedra suggests that they may assist in the dynamical slowing of these clusters .",
    "it is also reasonable to expect that their roles in enhancing the density and structural unification of the icosahedral network s mro - structures contribute significantly to the structural - mechanical properties that were previously attributed only to icoi - structures@xcite .",
    "pins and bridges may be particularly important for compositions of cu - zr mg for which the development of icoi is less extensive , and yet are good glass formers . as indicated earlier , only about 60% of the icosahedra in cu@xmath0zr@xmath0 mg participate in interpenetrating connections , but its icosahedral network is further developed via other connection types ( fig.[fig : conndistr ] ) .",
    "we are also interested in studying whether the icosahedral network s weighted connectivity is simply related to the population density of icosahedra , or if approaching a completely unified network reveals more complex features .",
    "quenching a supercooled liquid into a glass produces major changes in the system s dynamics , yet there is no obvious long range structural change that accompanies this transition . despite this",
    ", rigorous bounds have been proven to exist between length and time scales in a glassy system which mandate that a growing length scale must accompany the diverging relaxation times of glass transitions@xcite .",
    "recent research efforts provide evidence for various growing correlation lengths @xcite . however , there are findings that these scales ( and in particular static length scales- i.e. , those that can be ascertained from static snapshots of the system ) do not increase , when approaching the glass transition , rapidly enough , as suggested by various theories , in order to account for the dramatic increase in the relaxation times@xcite .",
    "static correlation lengths have been studied via ` point - to - set ' correlations@xcite , three - point correlations @xcite , pattern repetition size@xcite , and approaches employ graph theoretical tools @xcite and shear rigidity penetration depths . currently , most of the intuitive length scales , especially static ones , do not increase as drastically as does the relaxation time upon the glass transition .",
    "as glasses are rigid , a length characterizing the scale on which the supercooled liquid can support shear @xcite may be anticipated to naturally increase as the system `` freezes '' into a rigid amorphous solid .",
    "motivated by these quests and , most notably , by the icosahedral network - unification that we observe in cu@xmath1zr@xmath2 during its glass transition , we introduce a static length scale , which interestingly exhibits dramatic growth upon quenching .",
    "our length scale is the longest icosahedron - to - icosahedron distance within a connected subgraph of the full icosahedral network .",
    "it may be conceivable that the percolating icosahedral structure and the related increase in the interpenetrating icosahedral unit structure that we find might be related to an increased rigidity of the system as it rapidly cooled towards the low temperature glassy state .",
    "connected subgraphs that cross the periodic boundaries are appropriately ` unfolded ' across the boundaries before the distance is measured , and the maximum length is averaged across consecutive simulation snapshots . figure  [ fig : clusterlength ] depicts the rapid growth in the length scale as cu@xmath1zr@xmath2 is cooled to @xmath7 . from 1600",
    "k down to @xmath7 , the longest icoi - chain length grows by a factor of 13 . for the full icosahedral networks of the @xmath13 atom and @xmath12 atom systems , the longest connected subgraph lengths increase by factors of 19 and 31 , respectively . as expected from the percolating nature of the network , and as indicated by the horizontal dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : clusterlength ] , the extent by which the length scale grows is apparently limited only by the simulation cell size .",
    "finally , we characterized the average chemical compositions of a single icosahedral cluster ( including its center atom ) , the icosahedral network , and the different connection types .",
    "the results are summarized in figure  [ fig : composition ] .",
    "the icosahedral networks of both cu - zr alloys were found to be zr - rich relative to their overall system compositions .",
    "this leaves the remaining liquidlike matrix of the systems to be cu - rich , as shown in figures  [ fig : composition]a and  [ fig : composition]b .",
    "figure  [ fig : composition]c displays the average percent abundance of zr in each type of connection . comparing these ratios to the average icosahedral - shell composition ( also displayed in figure  [ fig : composition]c )",
    "reveals that non - interpenetrating connections do not appear to occur randomly between icosahedra , rather , they preferentially incorporate zr - atoms . because zr has a larger atomic volume than cu",
    ", these connections increase the density of the icosahedral network , while preserving the local composition of a single icosahedral cluster .",
    "in summary , we used a semi - empirical potential to conduct md simulations of cu@xmath0zr@xmath0 and cu@xmath1zr@xmath2 across liquid and glass - phase temperatures .",
    "our initial assessment of icosahedral ordering and networking within these systems provides additional support for the popular idea that interpenetrating connections serve to create robust , formative icosahedral structures .",
    "non - interpenetrating connections are shown , however , to become increasingly prevalent as the alloys approach their glass phases .",
    "viewing icosahedra as members of a network , interpenetrating icosahedra frequently participate in non - interpenetrating connections as well , and distinctly serve as the nodes of the network with the most connections . in particular , non - interpenetrating ` pinning ' and ` bridging ' connections are prominent amongst icoi - structures , and may be of particular structural importance in cu - zr mgs in which icoi are less extensive .",
    "to further characterize the structure of the icosahedral networks , we introduced the measure of weighted connectivity and used it to show that the network of cu@xmath1zr@xmath2 is almost completely unified , in contrast to its icoi - structures .",
    "accordingly , the maximum connected - cluster length lends itself as a static length scale , whose rapid growth upon quenching is apparently limited only by the simulation cube size .",
    "lastly , the vertex , edge , and face - sharing connections are shown to preferentially incorporate zr atoms , amidst icosahedral networks that are zr - rich compared to the system compositions .",
