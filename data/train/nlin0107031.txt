    "gutzwiller s work has now become a milestone in the understanding of the properties of a quantum system whose classical counterpart depicts chaotic dynamics  @xcite . starting from feynman s path formulation of quantum mechanics ,",
    "he has been able to complete the early studies of van  vleck  @xcite , deriving expressions for the semiclassical propagator , and from this , for the quantum level density : the well - known gutzwiller trace formula .",
    "the later is an asymptotic series in @xmath0 and can be separated into two parts ; the leading order corresponds to the thomas - fermi ( or extended thomas - fermi when including @xmath0 corrections ) average density of states  @xcite ; the other part corresponds to the oscillations around the preceding term and involves contributions from all periodic orbits of the system .",
    "this formula has been widely used to obtain approximate values for the quantum energy eigenvalues of classically chaotic systems : the hydrogen atom in magnetic field  @xcite , the helium atom  @xcite , anisotropic kepler problem  @xcite , resonant tunnel diode  @xcite , billiards  @xcite , etc . since then , the gutzwiller trace formula has also been generalized to take into account contributions of other kinds : diffractive effects  @xcite , continuous families of periodic orbits@xcite , ghost orbits , etc .    at the same time , because the trace formula as derived by gutzwiller only contained the leading term of the asymptotic expansion of the quantum level density , the systematic expansion of the semiclassical propagator in powers of @xmath0 has been the purpose of several studies  @xcite .",
    "however , these corrections to the trace formula have only been tested for billiards , for which both classical and quantum properties are easier to calculate . in the present paper",
    ", we will show how , for quantum systems whose hamiltonian separates into kinetic and smooth potential energies , @xmath0 corrections can be computed with great accuracy , extending the method described in refs .",
    "@xcite , based on classical green s functions .",
    "especially , we will show that the previous derivation  @xcite of the correction to gutzwiller trace formula is partially wrong .    from a numerical point of view ,",
    "all quantities involved in the calculation of the @xmath0 corrections for a given classical path can be obtained as solutions of sets of first order differential equations to be integrated along this path using standard time integrators like the runge - kutta method .",
    "the number of equations in these sets can be quite large and can be probably reduced with a deeper analysis of their structures , in the same way that the amplitude in the gutzwiller trace formula for a two - dimensional ( 2d ) system can be obtained by integrating only a @xmath1 matrix and not the whole monodromy matrix  @xcite .",
    "however , it would give rise to more complicated expressions and probably to additional difficulties in the numerical implementation , whereas the expressions given in the paper can be put in the computer as they stand .",
    "also , the amount of cpu  time and the memory needed by the codes are small enough , so that , on a first stage , the reduction of the number of equations can be skipped .",
    "the paper is divided as follows : in sec .",

    "apart from @xmath33 , @xmath24 obeying the homogeneous jacobi - hill equation @xmath34 , so that , introducing the notations @xmath35 one immediately obtains @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the @xmath38 monodromy matrix , depicting the linear stability around the classical orbit in the phase space . @xmath39 and @xmath40 are four @xmath25 matrices , whose values are determined from the boundary conditions at time @xmath33 : @xmath41 and at times @xmath42 and @xmath43 : @xmath44    for a hamiltonian which separates between kinetic and potential energy @xmath45 , @xmath37 has the following simple structure : @xmath46,\\ ] ] which leads us to the following explicit expressions for the four matrices @xmath39 and @xmath40 : @xmath47 provided that @xmath48 is invertible . @xmath49",

    "thus , @xmath49 is the inverse matrix of @xmath52 which has been supposed to be invertible ( @xmath53 and @xmath11 are not conjugate points ) .",

    "what follows , we will show that the preceding integrals can be transformed in way such that their values can be obtained integrating a set of first order differential equations along the classical orbit , in the same way that , for example , the monodromy matrix @xmath55 can be computed .",
    "separating @xmath67 and @xmath68 contributions in @xmath66 , using symmetry property  ( [ spg ] ) of @xmath24 and that the matrix @xmath69 is fully symmetric under index permutations , one gets , after straightforward algebra ,    @xmath70    in the preceding expressions the green s function @xmath24 is used only for @xmath65 values in the triangle @xmath71 and is formally written @xmath72 ( see eq .",

    "as mentioned in the introduction , the size of the preceding differential set is probably not minimal and could be reduced by a deeper analysis of the structure of these equations .",
    "however , it allows a fast and easy computation of the correction @xmath20 :    * find a trajectory going from @xmath11 to @xmath12 in time @xmath13 ; * integrate the differential set for @xmath85 and @xmath37 along the trajectory to obtain the quantity @xmath89 ; * integrate the set of eqs .",
