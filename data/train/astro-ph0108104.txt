    "marcy et al . ( 2001 ) have discovered two planets about the nearby m dwarf star gj@xmath0876 .",
    "a preliminary fit of the stellar radial velocity ( rv ) variations due to two unperturbed kepler orbits implies that the orbital periods of the two planets are nearly in the ratio 2:1 .",
    "this resonance is an analog to the orbital resonances among the satellites of jupiter and saturn ( e.g. , peale 1999 ) , but it is the first to be discovered among extrasolar planetary systems .",
    "table  [ table1 ] shows the system parameters from the marcy et al .",
    "analysis based on data taken at both the keck and lick observatories and an adopted stellar mass of @xmath26 .",
    "the orbital periods are approximately 30 and 60 days .",
    "the reduced chi - square statistic of @xmath27 indicates that the two - kepler system is an adequate fit to the data .",
    "however , the rather large minimum masses of the planets of 0.56 and 1.89 @xmath28 ( jupiter masses ) mean that the two - kepler fit may not be a good determination of the system characteristics because the large mutual perturbations will ensure that the orbits deviate from kepler orbits .",
    "in fact , substitution of the marcy et al . parameters from table  [ table1 ] ( with @xmath29 for both planets , where @xmath30 is the inclination of the orbital plane to the plane of the sky ) into a calculation of the perturbed orbital motions beginning at the specified initial epoch leads to large variations in the orbital elements that were assumed constant in the fit . on the other hand , projecting the orbital parameters in table  [ table1 ] to those at a different epoch within the time span of the data set leads to much less variations in the orbital elements and apparent long term stability of the system ( marcy et al .",
    "for some choices of epoch , the system is not in the 2:1 resonance , and it eventually becomes unstable ( laughlin & chambers 2001 ) . clearly , a dynamical fit of system characteristics to the rv observations is necessary to constrain the parameters that define an rv curve for gj@xmath0876 .    the publication of the data set by marcy et al .",
    "( 2001 ) allowed laughlin & chambers ( 2001 ) to perform such a fit .",
    "they assumed that the two planets are on coplanar orbits , and used two methods to minimize @xmath31 as a function of the initial system parameters . starting with the 2-kepler fit , a levenberg - marquardt minimization scheme driving an @xmath32-body integrator was used to find a _",
    "local _ minimum in @xmath31 .",
    "a second method uses a genetic algorithm combined with a simple model for the variations of the orbital elements due to the 2:1 orbital resonance to search for the _ global _ minimum in @xmath31 .",
    "both methods converged to similar solutions .",
    "the dynamical fits are sensitive to @xmath33 since the determined masses ( and perturbations ) grow as @xmath30 is decreased .",
    "the best - fit solutions obtained using the levenberg - marquardt method are included in table  [ table1 ] for both the keck@xmath34lick data and keck data alone .",
    "the keck data is much more accurate than the lick data and the solution for this data alone has a minimum @xmath35 with an rms scatter of @xmath36 for @xmath37 .",
    "although the lick data is less accurate than the keck data , the longer time span of observation that includes the lick data may give the better solution .",
    "the solution for the keck@xmath34lick data has a minimum @xmath38 with an rms scatter of @xmath39 for @xmath40 , but the @xmath31 minimum is broad , with several nearby solutions giving nearly as good a fit .",
    "the conclusion of laughlin & chambers is that the broad minimum in @xmath31 allows probable values of @xmath41 .",
    "( rivera & lissauer 2001 examined mutually inclined orbits and got similarly small @xmath31 values for several different configurations , but they confirmed the laughlin & chambers results for coplanar orbits . )    figure  [ figure1 ] shows the trajectories of the motions for 3100 days ( the average periapse precession period for both planets ) for the two laughlin - chambers best - fit solutions in plots of @xmath42 versus @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the eccentricity of the @xmath45th planet ( with @xmath46 and @xmath47 for the inner and outer planets , respectively ) , @xmath48 are the two lowest order , eccentricity - type mean - motion resonance variables at the 2:1 commensurability , and @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the mean longitude and longitude of periapse of the @xmath45th planet .",
    "the two laughlin - chambers solutions place the system deep in both mean - motion resonances , with @xmath11 and @xmath7 librating about @xmath4 with remarkably small amplitudes .",
    "the simultaneous librations of @xmath11 and @xmath7 about @xmath4 mean that the secular resonance variable @xmath51 also librates about @xmath4 .",
    "although the parameters will be more tightly defined as more data is acquired , the almost singular nature of the low amplitude librations indicates that the real system is most likely indeed locked in multi - resonance librations at the 2:1 mean - motion commensurability .",
    "this means that the line of apsides of the two orbits are nearly aligned with conjunctions of the two planets always occurring very close to the periapse longitudes .",
    "the resonance configuration ensures that the planets can never make close approaches in spite of their large masses , and barring external perturbations or an unreasonably high dissipation of tidal energy in the planets , the system should be stable for the lifetime of the star .",
    "in fact , we find that the librations are stable even for amplitudes of the inner planet resonance variable @xmath11 approaching @xmath14 if we induce larger amplitudes of libration of the resonance variables by changing the initial value of the mean anomaly of the inner planet .",
    "the existence of the mean - motion resonances means that the assumption that the orbits are nearly coplanar should be correct , and such coplanarity is consistent with the accretion of planetary bodies in a nebular disk surrounding the forming star .",
    "we shall assume that the orbits are coplanar hereinafter .",
    "furthermore , there is not much to distinguish the two laughlin - chambers solutions in figure  [ figure1 ] , and we shall assume the parameters appropriate to the solution based on both the keck and lick data .",
    "figure  [ figure2 ] shows the variations in the semi - major axes and eccentricities of both planets for @xmath52 days for the laughlin - chambers keck@xmath34lick solution .",
    "the small amplitude librations of the resonance variables about @xmath4 ensure that both the eccentricities and semi - major axes have little variation in spite of the large mutual perturbations .",
    "this is why the 2-kepler fit of marcy et al .",
    "( 2001 ) could produce a fit that was not too bad .",
    "the fact that both 2:1 mean - motion resonance variables librate about @xmath4 in figure  [ figure1 ] contrasts with the geometry of the io - europa 2:1 orbital resonances at jupiter , where the resonance variable involving io s longitude of periapse , @xmath11 , librates about @xmath4 but the resonance variable involving europa s longitude of periapse , @xmath7 , librates about @xmath9 ( e.g. , peale 1999 ) .",
    "this means that in the io - europa case the lines of apsides are anti - aligned , with the periapses @xmath9 apart ( i.e. , @xmath8 librates about @xmath9 ) .",
    "conjunctions occur when io is near periapse and europa is near apoapse . in ",
    "2 we explain why the gj@xmath0876  and io - europa systems have different resonance configurations by considering a condition for stable simultaneous librations of the two mean - motion resonance variables .",
    "in particular , the longitudes of periapse should precess in the same direction at the same average rate , so that the relative alignment of the lines of apsides is maintained . in the io - europa case ,",
    "the orbital eccentricities are sufficiently small that the precession rate @xmath53 is dominated by a single term lowest order in eccentricities and containing @xmath54 .",
    "the overall sign of the coefficient for this term is @xmath55 for @xmath56 ( inner satellite ) but @xmath57 for @xmath58 ( outer satellite ) , and retrograde precessions of both satellites require @xmath11 to librate about @xmath4 and @xmath7 to librate about @xmath9 . in the case of gj@xmath0876 ,",
    "the eccentricities are sufficiently large that there are large contributions to the precession rates from higher order terms whose cosine arguments are linear combinations of the resonance variables . summing over all contributing terms , coincident retrograde precessions of the gj@xmath0876  planets require both @xmath11 and @xmath7 to librate about @xmath4 .",
    "if the orbits of the two planets about gj@xmath0876  were originally much further apart , with the ratio of their mean motions considerably greater than 2:1 , any process that drives the orbits toward each other could lead to capture into the 2:1 orbital resonances that we observe . in ",
    "3 we describe a particular migration process due to the gravitational interaction between the planets and the nebular disk surrounding the young gj@xmath0876 .",
    "we note the simulations by bryden et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and kley ( 2000 ) , which show that two planets that are massive enough to open gaps individually in the gas disk can rather quickly clear out the disk material between them , if they are not separated too far .",
    "disk material outside the outer planet exerts torques on the planet that are not opposed by disk material on the inside , and the outer planet migrates toward the star on the disk viscous time scale . any disk material left on the inside of the inner planet exerts torques on the inner planet that push it away from the star .",
    "thus the condition of approaching orbits necessary to form the resonances is established .",
    "we discuss the effect of planet - nebula interaction on orbital eccentricities and note that the gj@xmath0876  system is in the interesting regime where it is uncertain whether eccentricity damping or growth is expected because of the rather large planet - star mass ratio of the outer planet .",
    "( although the mass of the outer planet , @xmath59 , for the laughlin - chambers keck@xmath34lick solution is only @xmath60 , @xmath61 because the stellar mass @xmath62 . )    in  4 we present the results of a series of numerical orbit integrations in which the orbits of the gj@xmath0876  planets , initially far from the 2:1 mean - motion commensurability , are forced to approach each other .",
    "( the numerical methods are described in the appendix . )",
    "we show that capture into the two 2:1 mean - motion resonances and the secular resonance is certain if the orbital eccentricities start reasonably small and the rate of migration is not too fast .",
    "if there is no eccentricity damping , the eccentricities of both planets increase rapidly after resonance capture and exceed the observed values after a very short migration of the resonantly locked planets .",
    "eccentricity damping of the form @xmath63 , where a dot over a symbol denotes @xmath64 and @xmath23 is the forced migration rate , leads to a termination in the eccentricity growth , and the eccentricities reach equilibrium values that remain constant for arbitrarily long migration in the resonances . we find that significant eccentricity damping with latexmath:[$|{\\dot e}_i / e_i| \\gg    the gj@xmath0876  system . in ",
    "5.1 we show that alternative damping of the eccentricities by tidal dissipation within the star or planets is insignificant , and in  5.2 we discuss other related studies .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in  6 .",
    "as shown in figure  [ figure1 ] , the gj@xmath0876  system has both lowest order , eccentricity - type mean - motion resonance variables at the 2:1 commensurability , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , and hence the secular resonance variable , @xmath68 , librating about @xmath4 .",
    "this resonance configuration is different from that of io and europa , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 librate about @xmath9 .",
    "it should be noted that the differences are not due to the additional resonances involving ganymede in the io - europa case . in the scenario where the resonances among the inner three galilean satellites of jupiter are assembled by differential tidal expansion of the orbits ( yoder 1979 ; yoder & peale 1981 ) , io is driven out most rapidly and the resonance variables involving io and europa only are captured into libration first .",
    "these resonance variables have the same centers of libration before and after the 2:1 commensurability between europa and ganymede is encountered .",
    "the differences in the resonance configurations of gj@xmath0876  and io - europa are instead due to the magnitudes of the eccentricities involved and can be understood from a condition for stable simultaneous librations of the two mean - motion resonance variables .",
    "this condition for stable simultaneous librations of @xmath11 and @xmath7 is that the longitudes of periapse , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , on average precess at the same rate . for coplanar orbits ,",
    "the equations for the variation of @xmath71 , @xmath19 , and @xmath12 in jacobi coordinates are ( e.g. , peale 1986 ) @xmath72 where @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 is the mass of the star ( or jupiter ) , @xmath76 is the mass of the @xmath30th planet ( or satellite ) , the hamiltonian @xmath77 and the disturbing potential @xmath78 if we neglect terms of order @xmath79 and higher and assume that @xmath80 , @xmath81 can be expanded to the form @xmath82 where @xmath83 and the summation is over the range @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 . the coefficient @xmath87 , where @xmath88 , can be written in terms of the laplace coefficient @xmath89 and its derivatives ( brouwer & clemence 1961 ) . for a given cosine argument @xmath90 , the term lowest order in eccentricities is of order @xmath91 .    within the 2:1 mean - motion resonances and the secular resonance ,",
    "the perturbations are dominated by the terms whose arguments are nearly fixed because of the resonances , i.e. , those terms involving the resonance variables @xmath11 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and their linear combinations . since the terms in equation ( [ dadt ] ) for @xmath92 and equation ( [ dedt ] ) for @xmath93 are proportional to @xmath94 and @xmath95 and @xmath96 and @xmath71 appear in the cosine arguments only , the cosines are changed into sines and there is no secular change in @xmath19 and the forced @xmath12 if the resonance variables @xmath11 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 librate about either @xmath4 or @xmath9 .",
    "( note , however , that if the eccentricities are not small and @xmath92 and @xmath93 are not dominated by a single term , there is also the possibility that the sums of all contributing terms are zero for resonance variables having values other than @xmath4 and @xmath9 . )",
    "we have calculated the contributions to the precession rate @xmath53 from secular terms in equation ( [ phiexp ] ) with argument of the form @xmath97 ( including the @xmath98 non - resonant secular term ) , up to fourth order in eccentricities , and from mean - motion resonance terms with argument of the form @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) , up to third order in eccentricities , and they are listed in table  [ table2 ] .",
    "we set the resonance variables to their average values , i.e. , the libration center values .",
    "in addition , we ignore the small deviation of @xmath101 from @xmath102 ( since the commensurability is not exact ) and evaluate @xmath87 at @xmath103 . for io and europa ,",
    "we adopt @xmath104 and @xmath105 , which are the equilibrium eccentricities before the resonances with ganymede are encountered in the tidal scenario ( yoder & peale 1981 ) .",
    "the numerical values in table  [ table2 ] are for the current semi - major axis of io , but they can be scaled to other values of the semi - major axis since the precession rates are proportional to @xmath106 . as we can see in table  [ table2 ] , because the orbital eccentricities of io and europa are small , the precession rate @xmath53 is dominated by a single term lowest order in the eccentricities .",
    "this is the term with argument @xmath107 and proportional to @xmath12 in the disturbing potential ( eq .  [ [ phiexp ] ] ) , and whose contribution to @xmath53 is proportional to @xmath108 ( eq .  [ [ precess ] ] ) .",
    "since the coefficients of the @xmath109 and @xmath110 terms are @xmath111 and @xmath112 , respectively , retrograde precessions of both io and europa require @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "furthermore , the requirement that the regression rates are identical implies a simple relationship between the eccentricities : @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the mean motion and the secular motion @xmath117 includes contributions from secular terms in the disturbing potential and the additional secular motion induced by the oblateness of jupiter . as we can see in table  [ table2 ] , the contributions from the secular terms in the disturbing potential and even the secular motion induced by the oblateness of jupiter ( which is @xmath118 for io s orbit ) are small compared with the @xmath119 precession induced by the first order mean - motion resonance terms with arguments @xmath11 and @xmath7 .",
    "thus @xmath120 , where the last equality is for the masses of io and europa .    for gj@xmath0876 ,",
    "we know from numerical orbit integration of the laughlin - chambers keck@xmath34lick solution that on average @xmath121 .",
    "the numerical values in table  [ table2 ] are obtained using @xmath122 , @xmath123 , and @xmath124 , which are the average values for the laughlin - chambers keck@xmath34lick solution ( see fig .  [ figure2 ] ) .",
    "as we would expect from the analysis above for the io - europa case , with @xmath125 , the contributions to @xmath126 and @xmath127 from the @xmath109 and @xmath110 terms , respectively , have opposite signs .",
    "however , because the eccentricities are large , these terms no longer dominate the precession rates .",
    "in particular , the largest contribution to @xmath127 comes from terms second order in eccentricities  the largest of which being the @xmath128 term , which is of order @xmath13(@xmath129 ) lower than the @xmath110 term , but whose coefficient is large and negative ( @xmath130 ) .",
    "we can also see from table  [ table2 ] that both @xmath126 and @xmath127 converge only slowly with the order of the @xmath131 terms . with the inclusion of terms up to @xmath132",
    ", the precession rates have the correct , negative signs when @xmath133 , but the magnitude of the precession rate for the inner ( outer ) planet is significantly larger ( smaller ) than that for both planets from numerical orbit integration .",
    "based on the magnitudes and the alternating signs of the contributions from the lower order terms , the expected contributions from the @xmath134 ( and higher order ) terms are consistent with their bringing the results into agreement with the actual precession rates .",
    "there is no simple analytic expression relating @xmath13 to @xmath135 when the eccentricities are large , but as in the small eccentricity limit , the eccentricities are related by the requirement that the periapses precess at the same rate .",
    "although the analysis in this section is able to explain why the gj@xmath0876  and io - europa systems have different resonance configurations , the slow convergence of the series for moderate to large eccentricities means that it has limited usefulness if one is interested in the more general question of what stable configurations are possible for different periapse precession rates and masses . a practical way to investigate this latter question is through numerical migration calculations like those in  4.1 , which drive a system through a sequence of configurations with different precession rates . as we shall see , for systems with masses like those in gj@xmath0876 , there are stable configurations with @xmath11 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 librating about @xmath4 for @xmath136 ( see fig .  [ figure3 ] ) .",
    "we have also found that configurations with resonance variables librating about angles other than @xmath4 and @xmath9 are possible when the masses are different from those in gj@xmath0876 ; these configurations will be discussed in a subsequent paper .",
    "we now turn to the question of the origin of the two 2:1 mean - motion resonances and the secular resonance in the gj@xmath0876  system . a scenario for the origin of this resonance configuration",
    "is that it was assembled by differential migration of orbits that were initially much further apart .",
    "we shall see in  4 that libration of all three resonance variables is easily established by any process that drives the orbits toward each other .",
    "although the results presented in  4 are quite general , they will be interpreted in the context of a particular differential migration process , namely via the gravitational interaction between the planets and the nebula from which they form .",
    "it is generally accepted that planets form in a disk of gas and dust that surrounds a young star .",
    "since the two planets around gj@xmath0876  are of order jupiter mass and are presumably gas giants , they must have formed within the lifetime of the gas disk .",
    "if a planet is sufficiently massive , the torques exerted by the planet on the gas disk can open an annular gap in the disk about the planet s orbit .",
    "the conditions for gap formation are that the roche radius of the planet , @xmath137 , exceeds the scale height @xmath138 of the disk , or equivalently , @xmath139 and that the viscous condition @xmath140 is satisfied ( e.g. , lin & papaloizou 1993 ) . in the above equations ,",
    "@xmath141 and @xmath75 are the masses of the planet and the star , @xmath142 is the semi - major axis of the planet s orbit , @xmath143 is the angular kepler speed at @xmath142 , and the kinematic viscosity @xmath144 is expressed using the shakura - sunyaev @xmath145 prescription : @xmath146 . since the planet - star mass ratios of the planets around gj@xmath0876  are @xmath147 and @xmath61 , these planets are expected to open gaps individually during their growth to their final masses if their orbits are sufficiently far apart , unless @xmath148 or @xmath149 .    the numerical values @xmath150 and @xmath151 are typical of models of protoplanetary disks ( e.g. , bryden et al . 2000 ; kley 2000 ; papaloizou et al .",
    "hartmann et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have also inferred from observed properties of t tauri disks that @xmath152 .",
    "the most promising source of an effective viscosity in accretion disks is magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence initiated and sustained by the magnetorotational instability , which is capable of producing an effective @xmath145 as large as @xmath153 ( e.g. , stone et al .",
    "2000 ) . however , protoplanetary disks are probably too weakly ionized for mhd turbulence to develop fully , except at small radii ( @xmath154 ) and possibly in a layer near the surface of the disk at larger radii ( gammie 1996 ) . another possible source of effective viscosity is damping of density waves excited by many small ( of order earth mass ) planets , which is capable of producing an effective @xmath155 ( goodman & rafikov 2001 ) .",
    "bryden et al . ( 2000 ) and kley ( 2000 ) have performed hydrodynamic simulations of a system consisting of a central star , a gas disk and two planets .",
    "the planets are massive enough ( @xmath156 ) to open gaps individually , and the ratio of their initial semi - major axes is @xmath157 .",
    "they found that the planets clear out nearly all of the nebular material between them in a few hundred orbital periods .",
    "then the torques exerted by the nebular material outside the outer planet drives that planet toward the star , whereas any nebular material left on the inside of the inner planet drives that planet away from the star .",
    "the depletion of the inner disk means that the inner planet may not move out very far , but the net effect is always to drive the orbits of two massive planets toward each other .",
    "the time scale on which the planets migrate is the disk viscous time scale , whose inverse is ( ward 1997 ) @xmath158 where a dot over a symbol denotes @xmath64 .",
    "in addition to its effect on the semi - major axis , planet - nebula interaction can also affect the orbital eccentricity of a planet ( e.g. , goldreich & tremaine 1980 ; artymowicz 1992 , 1993 ; papaloizou et al .",
    "a planet interacts with a disk in the vicinity of lindblad and corotation resonances .",
    "the leading contribution to @xmath159 is due to lindblad resonances with the @xmath160 fourier components of the planet s perturbation potential .",
    "( the indices @xmath161 and @xmath162 for the fourier series in time and azimuthal angle in this context should not be confused with @xmath163 and @xmath162 in eq .",
    "[ [ phiexp ] ] . ) for a planet orbiting in a disk gap , the so - called co - orbital lindblad and corotation resonances are not important , and the leading contributions to @xmath164 are damping due to @xmath165 corotation resonances and excitation due to @xmath166 outer and @xmath167 inner lindblad resonances .",
    "the net effect of the corotation resonance damping and the lindblad resonance excitation depends on the distribution of the nebular material , which is itself determined by the interaction with the planet .",
    "if the gap is not too wide and many resonances of both types are present , previous calculations indicate that there is net eccentricity damping .",
    "for example , if we consider an outer disk of constant surface mass density @xmath168 that extends radially from @xmath169 to @xmath170 , with @xmath171 , then integration of equations ( 30 ) and ( 31 ) of goldreich & tremaine ( 1980 ) yields @xmath172 ( note that the above equations are identical to eqs . [ 109 ] and [ 110 ] of goldreich & tremaine where they set @xmath173 . )    in the case of gj@xmath0876 , since the planets clear out nearly all of the nebular material between them and the inner disk is likely to be depleted , the dominant resonant interactions are expected to be those between the outer disk and the outer planet .",
    "however , the estimate ( [ gtdedt ] ) for @xmath174 is not adequate because , in addition to the fact that the mass distribution near the inner edge of the outer disk is not modeled properly , the outer planet is sufficiently massive that only a few low-@xmath162 resonances are likely to be present in the disk .",
    "in fact , if the outer planet is able to open a gap out to the 2:1 commensurability , there would be no corotation resonances and only one lindblad resonance with @xmath175 at the 3:1 commensurability , and there would be eccentricity growth instead of damping ( artymowicz 1992 ) .",
    "( in addition , the disk can become eccentric and the growth of the planet s orbital eccentricity can be enhanced by the interaction with the eccentric disk , if the planetary mass is comparable to a characteristic mass of the disk ; papaloizou et al .",
    "2001 . ) from a comparison of the resonant and viscous torques , an approximate condition for opening a gap out to the 2:1 commensurability is ( artymowicz 1992 ; lin & papaloizou 1993 ) @xmath176 since the planet - star mass ratio of the outer planet around gj@xmath0876  is @xmath177 and close to the critical value in equation ( [ 2to1cond ] ) , without knowing the exact values of the disk parameters , it is unclear whether one should expect eccentricity damping or growth",
    ". however , as we shall see in  4 , significant eccentricity _ damping _ with @xmath178 is required to produce the observed eccentricities of the gj@xmath0876  system , unless the migration after resonance capture is severely limited .",
    "therefore , at least the condition ( [ 2to1cond ] ) must not be satisfied , implying that @xmath179 for the outer disk of the young gj@xmath0876  system .",
    "a more detailed analysis using hydrodynamic simulations is necessary to determine whether sufficient eccentricity damping can be produced by such an outer disk .",
    "in this section we present the results of a series of numerical orbit integrations designed to determine the conditions under which the dynamical properties of the current gj@xmath0876  system could be produced by any process ( such as the planet - nebular interaction discussed in  3 ) that drives the orbits of the two planets toward each other .",
    "we consider a system consisting of a central star and two planets , where the stellar and planetary masses are those for the laughlin - chambers keck@xmath34lick solution ( table  [ table1 ] ) . unless stated otherwise , the planets are initially on coplanar , circular orbits , with the mean longitudes differing by @xmath9 and the ratio of the semi - major axes @xmath180 , far from the 2:1 mean - motion commensurability .",
    "in addition to the mutual gravitational interactions of the star and the planets , we force the osculating semi - major axis of planet @xmath30 to migrate at a rate @xmath23 . in most cases , we assume that only the outer planet is forced to migrate inward , with a migration rate of the form @xmath181 constant .",
    "the effects of adopting a more general form of the migration rate ( e.g. , @xmath182 being a function of @xmath183 ) or forcing the inner planet to migrate outward are discussed in  4.2 . for the calculations in  4.2",
    ", we also damp the osculating eccentricity at a rate @xmath184 .",
    "we adopt a damping rate of the form @xmath185 , where @xmath25 is a positive constant .",
    "as we shall see , this form of eccentricity damping has the convenient property that the eccentricities reach equilibrium values after capture into the 2:1 resonances .",
    "we note that the relation @xmath186 is valid for the simple estimates ( [ gtdedt ] ) and ( [ gtdadt ] ) for the interaction of a massive planet with an outer disk if @xmath187 constant and that the same relation between the damping and migration rates also holds for a planet that is too small to open a gap in a gas disk with constant @xmath188 and undergoes the so - called type i migration ( artymowicz 1993 ; ward 1997 ) .",

    "initially , only the outer planet migrates inward at the prescribed rate .",
    "when the 2:1 mean - motion commensurability is encountered , both @xmath11 and @xmath7 ( and hence the secular resonance variable @xmath8 ) are captured into libration about @xmath4 .",
    "we do not see libration of @xmath7 and @xmath8 about @xmath9 , which is expected for small eccentricities ( see  2 ) , because the planetary masses are so large that fairly large eccentricities ( with @xmath13 reaching about @xmath198 ) are generated before the 2:1 commensurability is encountered .",
    "because of the forced migration , the centers of libration are actually slightly offset from @xmath4 .",
    "the resulting resonant interaction slows down the migration of the outer planet and forces the inner planet to migrate inward while keeping the ratio of the semi - major axes nearly constant ( @xmath199 ) ; it also causes the eccentricities to increase rapidly .",
    "the centers of libration remain near @xmath4 and the amplitudes of libration remain small as the eccentricities increase .",
    "the sequence of configurations with increasing eccentricities that the system is driven through after resonance capture is in fact a sequence with increasingly less negative periapse precession rates .",
    "as we discussed in  2 , the forced eccentricities ( and the libration centers ) for a system with stable simultaneous librations of @xmath11 and @xmath7 are determined by the requirement that the longitudes of periapse on average precess at the same rate ( which in turn is determined by @xmath200 ) .",
    "although a longer integration indicates that the system does eventually become unstable when @xmath201 , the existence of stably librating configurations with @xmath13 up to @xmath202 is remarkable . in particular , the configurations with",
    "@xmath203 have _ prograde _ periapse precessions .",
    "we have integrated the configurations at @xmath204 ( with @xmath205 and retrograde periapse precessions ) and @xmath206 ( with @xmath207 and prograde periapse precessions ) forward with migration turned off and confirmed that the system remains stable as seemingly indefinitely repeating configurations .",
    "as we can see in figure  [ figure3]_a _ , without eccentricity damping , the eccentricities exceed the observed values for the gj@xmath0876  planets ( dashed lines ) when the semi - major axes of the resonantly locked planets have decreased by only @xmath208 after capture into the resonances .",
    "this result is insensitive to the adopted parameters .",
    "if the migration rate is not too fast ( see below ) , the evolution of a system with different initial @xmath183 ( but for convenience , the same @xmath209 ) or @xmath182 is essentially identical to that shown in figure  [ figure3 ] if we plot the semi - major axes in units of initial @xmath183 and time in units of @xmath210 .",
    "therefore , unless by coincidence resonance capture occurs just before migration stops because of , e.g. , nebula dispersal , eccentricity damping is necessary to produce the observed eccentricities of the gj@xmath0876  system .    from a set of calculations similar to that shown in figure  [ figure3 ] , with initial @xmath180 , @xmath211 , @xmath47 , and @xmath212 , and different @xmath182",

    ", both resonance variables are captured into libration , but the centers of libration can be significantly different from @xmath4 and the amplitudes of libration can be large .",
    "the condition ( [ dadtlim ] ) is satisfied by a migration rate due to planet - nebular interaction with the nominal parameter values in equation ( [ vistime ] ) by almost 3 orders of magnitude .",
    "to examine the effects of orbital eccentricities on capture into the 2:1 resonances , we performed a series of calculations with non - zero initial eccentricities .",

    "the inner planet was always started at periapse , with its mean longitude differing from that of the outer planet by @xmath9 , and the remaining parameters were identical to those used in the calculation shown in figure  [ figure3 ] .",
    "since gravitational interaction between the planets causes the eccentricities to fluctuate even when @xmath215 and @xmath183 are close to their initial values , the eccentricities quoted below are the maximum eccentricities when @xmath215 and @xmath183 are close to their initial values and not the initial eccentricities .",
    "we find that certain capture of both 2:1 mean - motion resonance variables requires @xmath216 for eccentricities above these limits , there is non - zero probability for the planets to be captured into higher order resonances ( e.g. , 5:2 ) encountered before the 2:1 commensurability .",

    "the capture of the resonance variables @xmath11 and @xmath7 into libration about @xmath4 and the initial evolution after resonance capture are similar to the case without damping .",
    "however , the eccentricity growth eventually terminates when the damping balances the excitation due to resonant interaction between the planets .",
    "the eccentricities reach equilibrium values that remain constant for arbitrarily long migration in the resonances . with @xmath218 ,",
    "the equilibrium eccentricities are close to the observed eccentricities of the gj@xmath0876  system . at the end of the calculation shown in figure  [ figure4 ] , when @xmath219 , the semi - major axes are also similar to those of the gj@xmath0876  planets .",
    "we have integrated the configuration at the end of the calculation shown in figure  [ figure4 ] forward with migration and damping turned off .",

    "although the libration amplitudes are fairly similar in the two laughlin - chambers best - fit solutions , we may find in the future , as more data is acquired , that improved best - fit solutions will have smaller libration amplitudes .",
    "alternatively , larger amplitudes could be generated after termination of migration and damping by encounters with remaining planetesimals .    in figure  [ figure6 ]",
    "we show the time evolutions of the eccentricities for a set of calculations with @xmath220 , @xmath217 , and different @xmath25 .",
    "the equilibrium eccentricities decrease with increasing @xmath25 and are significantly different from the observed eccentricities of the gj@xmath0876system if @xmath25 is more than a factor 23 larger or smaller than @xmath218 .    as long as @xmath217 , where @xmath25 is a positive constant ,",
    "the equilibrium eccentricities are determined by the value of @xmath25 only and are insensitive to either the magnitude or functional form of @xmath182 .",

    "the equilibrium eccentricities are identical in figures  [ figure4 ] and [ figure7 ] .",
    "if @xmath224 is not exactly proportional to @xmath18 , the eccentricities would decrease slowly ( after reaching maxima ) or increase slowly as the resonantly locked planets migrate , but the ratio of damping to migration rates , @xmath225 , just before migration and damping stop should be close to @xmath226 for the final eccentricities to be close to the observed values of the gj@xmath0876  system .",
    "thus far we have considered forced inward migration of the outer planet only .",
    "this is the most likely situation in the planet - nebular interaction scenario discussed in  3 , since the inner disk is likely to be depleted and the dominant interactions are expected to be those between the outer disk and the outer planet .",
    "however , if the inner disk is not depleted , at least initially , or migration and damping are due to another process , the inner planet may also be forced to migrate outward . in figure  [ figure8 ]",
    "we show the results of a calculation where , for simplicity , the inner planet is forced to migrate outward at the same rate that the outer planet is forced to migrate inward ( @xmath227 ) and @xmath24 .",
    "the inner ( outer ) planet migrates outward ( inward ) at the prescribed rate . after resonance capture , resonant interaction overcomes the forced outward migration of the inner planet , and both planets migrate inward slowly .",
    "the equilibrium eccentricities are close to the observed eccentricities of the gj@xmath0876  system when @xmath228 . therefore , even with eccentricity damping of both planets , significant eccentricity damping with @xmath229 is required to produce the observed orbital eccentricities of the gj@xmath0876planets .",
    "we have found in  4 that significant eccentricity damping with @xmath229 is required to produce the observed eccentricities of the gj@xmath0876  system if the migration has been at all extensive after resonance capture . as we discussed in",
    " 3 , it is as yet unclear whether sufficient damping could be produced by planet - nebula interaction , even if the condition ( [ 2to1condii ] ) is satisfied and eccentricity damping is expected ( see also  5.2 ) . in this subsection",
    "we show that alternative eccentricity damping by tidal dissipation within the star and planets during planet migration is completely negligible",
    ".    the star gj@xmath0876  would most likely still be in its pre - main - sequence contracting phase during disk evolution and planet migration . to estimate the rate of circularization of an orbit due to tidal dissipation in the star , we use the stellar radius when the time @xmath230 since initial contraction is approximately the migration time scale of @xmath231 ( eq .",
    "[ [ vistime ] ] ) and keep the planets at their current distances from the star .",
    "the planets would have migrated for longer than the migration time scale ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] ) and it would take time for the planets to form .",
    "but by adopting this minimum time to yield the maximum probable stellar radius and by keeping the planets at their current distances , we maximize our estimate of the tidal rate of circularization of an orbit .    since the mass of gj@xmath0876  is only @xmath26 , we assume that gj@xmath0876  follows the nearly vertical hayashi track in the hr diagram and remains fully convective during its contracting phase .",
    "hence the star remains a polytrope of index @xmath232 , with effective temperature @xmath233 ( e.g. , dantona & mazzitelli 1994 ) . from the virial theorem , the stellar luminosity @xmath234 where @xmath235 is the stefan - boltzmann constant",

    "integration of equation ( [ eq : virial ] ) , with @xmath239 for a polytrope of index @xmath232 , gives @xmath240 after @xmath241 , leading to a ratio of the stellar radius to the orbital semi - major axis @xmath242 for the inner planet and @xmath243 for the outer planet .",
    "since the present orbital period of the inner planet of the gj@xmath0876system is about 30 days , which is long compared to the periods of free oscillation of the star , we can use the rate for circularizing an orbit corresponding to dissipation dominated by the equilibrium tide for the star , which is given by ( zahn 1989 ) @xmath244 where @xmath245 is the planet - star mass ratio and @xmath246 .",

    "the dissipation in the star can have essentially no effect on the orbital eccentricities .    the theoretical circularization rate in equation ( [ eq : tcirc ] )",

    "it is in good agreement with the observed rates for binaries containing giant stars ( verbunt & phinney 1995 ) , but even with the maximum @xmath252 , it is about @xmath253@xmath226 times slower than the observed rates for binaries containing main - sequence solar - type stars , which have radiative cores ( claret & cunha 1997 ; goodman & oh 1997 ) .",
    "it is not yet clear why there is a discrepancy in the latter case or that this discrepancy is relevant for a fully convective pre - main - sequence star",
    ". nevertheless , even if we increase the circularization rates in equation ( [ eq : tcirc2 ] ) by a factor @xmath226 , they are still much smaller than the migration rate due to planet - nebula interaction .    tidal dissipation within a gaseous planet damps its orbital eccentricity at a rate given by ( e.g. , peale , cassen , & reynolds 1980 ) @xmath254 where @xmath255 , @xmath256 , and @xmath257 are the radius , the potential love number , and the dissipation function of the planet . if we adopt values for @xmath255 , @xmath256 , and @xmath257 similar to those of jupiter , with @xmath258 , @xmath259 ( gavrilov & zharkov 1977 ) , and @xmath260 ( which is approximately the lower bound on @xmath257 for jupiter ; yoder & peale 1981 ) , @xmath261 for the inner planet of the gj@xmath0876  system .",
    "the rate for damping the outer planet s orbital eccentricity from dissipation within itself is of course even smaller .",
    "the planets would most likely be larger and contracting during their migration . however , unless the planetary radii are unrealistically large and comparable to the roche radii , the eccentricity damping rate due to tidal dissipation within the planets is smaller than the migration rate due to planet - nebula interaction by several orders of magnitude .      after completing our calculations ( lee & peale 2001 ) , two papers with complementary calculations came to our attention ( snellgrove , papaloizou , & nelson 2001 ; murray , paskowitz , & holman 2001 ) .",
    "snellgrove et al .",

    "snellgrove et al . also develop an analytic resonance theory that is first order in the eccentricities .",
    "as we showed in  2 , a first order theory is inadequate for understanding the current gj@xmath0876  resonance configuration , which has @xmath11 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 all librating about @xmath4 .",
    "furthermore , as we found in  4 ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] ) , because the eccentricities are excited to large values in the gj@xmath0876  evolution before resonance capture , there is no time during the evolution when a first order theory can be useful for this system .",
    "thus all predictions coming from this theory should be viewed with caution .",
    "snellgrove et al . also present a hydrodynamic simulation of the planet - nebula interaction , where both planets are inside a cavity with almost no disk material . at the end of this simulation , @xmath262 and the semi - major axes of the planets",

    "it appears that the disk model used in this hydrodynamic simulation is not very effective in damping the eccentricities , which emphasizes the uncertainty in such damping .",
    "murray et al .",
    "( 2001 ) consider mainly an alternative scenario in which the migration and eccentricity damping of the outer planet are due to scattering of planetesimals in the disk population .",
    "their numerical simulations confirm our results ( and those of snellgrove et al .",
    "2001 ) of easy capture of an inner planet into resonance , the dual migration of both planets in the resonance , and the growth of the eccentricities , although they limit their numerical and analytical studies to an outer planet of jupiter mass and inner planets of several earth masses and devote much of the discussion to resonances of higher order than those at the 2:1 mean - motion commensurability .",
    "thus their results are not directly applicable to the gj@xmath0876  system .",
    "radial velocity measurements by marcy et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have revealed two planets in resonant orbits about the star gj@xmath0876 .",
    "the remarkable orbital fit obtained by laughlin & chambers ( 2001 ) , which finds both lowest order , eccentricity - type mean - motion resonance variables at the 2:1 commensurability librating with small amplitudes , means that the resonances are almost certainly real and indefinitely stable .",
    "the existence of the eccentricity - type resonances implies that the assumed coplanarity of the orbits is probably close to reality .",
    "the gj@xmath0876  planetary system has revealed properties of the 2:1 orbital resonances that have not been observed nor analyzed before .",
    "the libration of both lowest order mean - motion resonance variables , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , and the secular resonance variable , @xmath68 , about @xmath4 was not anticipated , as the familiar io - europa 2:1 resonance has @xmath11 librating about @xmath4 , but @xmath7 and @xmath8 librating about @xmath9  a configuration that would persist in the absence of ganymede .",
    "thus conjunctions for the jovian satellites occur when io is near periapse and europa is near apoapse , whereas conjunctions of the two planets about gj@xmath0876  occur when both planets are near periapse .",
    "we understood this to be mainly a function of the eccentricities of the orbits , where the resonance configuration with @xmath265 and @xmath266 must obtain when the eccentricities are small , but the resonance configuration with @xmath267 prevails for a system with masses like those in gj@xmath0876  when the eccentricities are large .",
    "a necessary condition for stable simultaneous librations of both mean - motion resonance variables is that @xmath268 on average , so that the relative alignment of the lines of apsides of the two orbits is maintained .",
    "the periapse precessions are dominated by resonant terms in the disturbing potential whose arguments are @xmath11 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and their linear combinations .",
    "the dominance of the lowest order terms when the eccentricities are small allows equal precession rates only if the lines of apsides are anti - aligned ( @xmath269 , @xmath266 ) , whereas dominance of higher order terms when the eccentricities are large results in equal precession rates for a system with masses like those in gj@xmath0876  when @xmath267 .",
    "the equality of the precession rates also determines a relationship between the eccentricities of the two orbits , although there is no simple analytic expression for this relationship when the eccentricities are large , since the first order theory is not a good representation .",
    "the stability of the gj@xmath0876  resonance configuration for values of @xmath13 up to 0.86 was also a surprise .",
    "any process that drives the two originally widely separated orbits toward each other can result in capture of the planets into orbital resonances at the 2:1 commensurability .",
    "the naturally occurring situation where nebular disk material is cleared between two planets sufficiently massive to individually open gaps in the disk ( bryden et al .",
    "2000 ; kley 2000 ) leads to inward migration of the outer planet and possibly outward migration of the inner planet .",
    "thus the likely origin of the resonances in the gj@xmath0876  system is this differential planet migration due to torques induced by the planet - nebula interaction .",
    "we have shown that forced inward migration of the outer planet of the gj@xmath0876system results in certain capture of @xmath11 , @xmath7 and hence @xmath8 into libration if initially @xmath15 and @xmath16 and @xmath270 .",
    "the latter rate is three orders of magnitude higher than the likely rate of @xmath271 due to planet - nebular interaction .",
    "the bounds on the eccentricities result not so much from the transition from certain to probabilistic capture at the 2:1 resonances but from likely capture into higher order resonances such as 5:2 before the 2:1 commensurability is encountered .    continued migration of the planets while locked in the 2:1 resonances leads to rapid growth in the orbital eccentricities that exceed the observed eccentricities of the gj@xmath0876  system after only a further decrease in the semi - major axes of about 7% if there is no eccentricity damping .",
    "so unless resonance capture occurred near the end of migration , the observed values of the eccentricities require eccentricity damping . with damping of the form @xmath20 , where @xmath25 is a positive constant",
    ", eccentricity growth is terminated at values of the eccentricities that increase with decreasing @xmath25 , and the eccentricities remain constant for indefinite duration of the migration .",
    "the observed eccentricities result for @xmath21 if there is forced migration and eccentricity damping of the outer planet only , but for @xmath22 if there is also forced migration and eccentricity damping of the inner planet .",
    "this result is independent of the magnitude or functional form of @xmath272 as long as @xmath20 is preserved .",
    "relaxing the last condition leads to a slow drift in the eccentricities during migration and would require the migration to terminate as the eccentricities pass through the observed values .",
    "existing analytic estimates of the effects of planet - nebular interaction are consistent with eccentricity damping of the form @xmath20 , if the planet - star mass ratio is not too large ( e.g. , goldreich & tremaine 1980 ; artymowicz 1992 , 1993 ; lin & papaloizou 1993 ; ward 1997 ) . however , the planet - star mass ratio of the outer planet of the gj@xmath0876system is sufficiently close to the critical value separating eccentricity growth from damping for nominal values of the disk parameters that it is uncertain whether such damping would occur . even if the disk parameters are such that eccentricity damping would occur , it is not clear that the magnitude of @xmath25 would be sufficiently large to constrain the eccentricities in the gj@xmath0876  system to the observed values .",
    "we have shown that the alternative eccentricity damping mechanism involving the dissipation of tidal energy within the star and the planets is completely negligible .",
    "further long - term hydrodynamic simulations with different physical assumptions and parameters are required to determine whether planet - nebular interaction could produce sufficient eccentricity damping to allow arbitrary migration of the planets within the resonances in the young gj@xmath0876  system while preserving eccentricities comparable to those observed . if not",
    ", the migration must have been finely tuned to stop when the system had progressed to its observed state , although this latter constraint is too ad hoc to be believable .",

    "<S> ( 2001 ) of two planets in 2:1 orbital resonance about the star gj@xmath0876  has been supplemented by a dynamical fit to the data by laughlin & chambers ( 2001 ) which places the planets in coplanar orbits deep in three resonances at the 2:1 mean - motion commensurability . </S>",
    "<S> the selection of this almost singular state by the dynamical fit means that the resonances are almost certainly real , and with the small amplitudes of libration of the resonance variables , indefinitely stable . </S>",
    "<S> several unusual properties of the 2:1 resonances are revealed by the gj@xmath0876system . </S>",
    "<S> the libration of both lowest order mean - motion resonance variables and the secular resonance variable , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , about @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 are the mean longitudes of the inner and outer planet and @xmath6 are the longitudes of periapse ) differs from the familiar geometry of the io - europa pair , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 librate about @xmath9 . by considering the condition that @xmath10 for stable simultaneous librations of @xmath11 and @xmath7 , we show that the gj@xmath0876  geometry results because of the large orbital eccentricities @xmath12 , whereas the very small eccentricities in the io - europa system lead to the latter s geometry . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , the gj@xmath0876  configuration , with @xmath11 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 all librating , remains stable for @xmath13 up to 0.86 and for amplitude of libration of @xmath11 approaching @xmath14 with the current eccentricities  further supporting the indefinite stability of the existing system .    </S>",
    "<S> any process that drives originally widely separated orbits toward each other could result in capture into the observed resonances at the 2:1 commensurability . </S>",
    "<S> we find that forced inward migration of the outer planet of the gj@xmath0876system results in certain capture into the observed resonances if initially @xmath15 and @xmath16 and the migration rate @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> larger eccentricities lead to likely capture into higher order resonances before the 2:1 commensurability is reached . </S>",
    "<S> the planets are sufficiently massive to open gaps in the nebular disk surrounding the young gj@xmath0876  and to clear the disk material between them , and the resulting planet - nebular interaction typically forces the outer planet to migrate inward on the disk viscous time scale , whose inverse is about three orders of magnitude less than the above upper bound on @xmath18 for certain capture . if there is no eccentricity damping , eccentricity growth is rapid with continued migration within the resonance , with @xmath12 exceeding the observed values after a further reduction in the semi - major axes @xmath19 of only 7% . with eccentricity damping @xmath20 , the eccentricities reach equilibrium values that remain constant for arbitrarily long migration within the resonances . </S>",
    "<S> the equilibrium eccentricities are close to the observed eccentricities for @xmath21 if there is migration and damping of the outer planet only , but for @xmath22 if there is also migration and damping of the inner planet . </S>",
    "<S> this result is independent of the magnitude or functional form of the migration rate @xmath23 as long as @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> although existing analytic estimates of the effects of planet - nebula interaction are consistent with this form of eccentricity damping for certain disk parameter values , it is as yet unclear that such interaction can produce the large value of @xmath25 required to obtain the observed eccentricities . </S>",
    "<S> the alternative eccentricity damping by tidal dissipation within the star or the planets is completely negligible , so the observed dynamical properties of the gj@xmath0876  system may require an unlikely fine tuning of the time of resonance capture to be near the end of the nebula lifetime . </S>"
