    "@xmath4@xmath5 decay is one of the octet baryon - antibaryon pairs decays of @xmath9 and other charmonium states .",
    "the branching ratio of @xmath3 has been measured by bes@xcite and cleo@xcite collaboration .",
    "the world average value is @xmath11@xcite .",
    "it is noted that this decay channel is very special to study the @xmath2 invariance not only in @xmath3 but also in the nonleptonic decay of @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath2 violation in @xmath3 decay is studied in ref.@xcite , two observables are suggested to test @xmath2 invariance , @xmath12    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is 1 if @xmath15 and is zero if @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the momentum unit vectors of @xmath4 , proton and anti - proton .",
    "any nonzero values for them signal @xmath2 violation . beside @xmath3 ,",
    "the measurement can be carried in other charmonium states decay to @xmath20 experimentally .",
    "@xmath2 violation can also be studied in nonleptonic decays of @xmath4 .",
    "nonleptonic hyperon decays have long been known as an ideal laboratory to study the parity violation .",
    "considering a nonleptonic decay of the hyperon @xmath21 , the angular distribution of the baryon in the center - of - mass ( cm ) system of @xmath21 takes the form @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the polarization vector of the hyperon , @xmath24 is the momentum unit vector of the baryon , and @xmath25 is the hyperon decay parameter , which characterizes the parity violation in the decays .",
    "taking @xmath26 as an example , a @xmath2-odd observable , @xmath27 , can be defined as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the decay parameter of @xmath26 , @xmath30 is the decay parameter of @xmath31 .",
    "if @xmath4 decays to @xmath32 and @xmath5 decays to @xmath33 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 should be replaced by @xmath34 and @xmath7 .",
    "if @xmath2 is conserved , this observable vanishes for @xmath35 or @xmath36 .",
    "any nonzero value implies evidence for @xmath2 asymmetry in @xmath4 decays .",
    "this asymmetry has been previously performed at @xmath37 colliders by the r608@xcite and ps185@xcite collaborations , and at an @xmath38 collider by dm2@xcite collaboration .",
    "the latest result is measured by bes@xcite collaboration , although the precision has been improved much , it is insufficient to observe @xmath2 violation at the level predicted by the standard model .",
    "the precise measurement of the @xmath4 decay parameter also plays an important role in the determination of @xmath39 and @xmath40 decay parameters . to note that the non - polarized @xmath39 or @xmath40 decays can produce polarized @xmath4 particle .",
    "namely , @xmath4 is the daughter particle in the decays of @xmath39 and @xmath40 . in the @xmath4 rest frame ,",
    "the angular distribution of the proton takes the form of @xmath41 .",
    "experimentally , the extraction of @xmath42 from the product @xmath43 is dependent on the value of @xmath29 .",
    "the accuracy of @xmath42 measurement is dependent on the accuracy of @xmath29 .",
    "the situation is the same for @xmath44 and @xmath45 which can produce polarized @xmath5 .",
    "so , the measurement of @xmath29 and @xmath30 plays a unique role in other hyperon decay parameters measurement .    in this paper , based on the study in refs.@xcite@xcite",
    ", we detail the information on the @xmath2 observables in @xmath3 , and the decay parameters of @xmath4 and @xmath5 with helicity amplitude analysis .",
    "the similar study is applied for @xmath46@xcite .",
    "nowadays , @xmath8 @xmath9 decays have been accumulated by besiii detector , the advantage of this work is obvious and high accuracy can be achieved for the statistics .",
    "the helicity amplitudes for @xmath3 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 decays are constructed in the helicity frame defined as :    1 .   in @xmath3 ,",
    "the z - axis of the @xmath9 rest frame is along @xmath4 outgoing direction , which changes from event to event .",
    "the @xmath49 beam is along the direction of the solid angle ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "2 .   for @xmath4 decay @xmath47 , the solid angle of the daughter particle",
    "@xmath51 is refereed to the @xmath4 rest frame , where the z - axis is taken along the outgoing direction of @xmath4 in its mother particle rest frame .",
    "the helicity frame of @xmath5 has a similar definition which is described by the solid angle @xmath52 .",
    "fig.[heli ] shows the definition of the helicity frame for @xmath3 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 .    , @xmath47 , @xmath48 [ heli],width=226,height=151 ]    the joint helicity amplitudes of @xmath3 , @xmath47 ,",
    "@xmath48 can be expressed by @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 as : @xmath56 where @xmath57,@xmath58 are the helicity values for @xmath59 , baryon and anti - baryon .",

    "the @xmath2 invariance could be obtained by eq.([lambdacp ] ) with @xmath64 or @xmath65 , the precision would be also improved .",
