    "photons are prior candidate for quantum information processing such as quantum computing and long distance quantum communication , as they can be easily generated and can travel long distances with high coherence . due to the ability of obtaining photon - photon interactions ,",
    "the nonlinear optical process has great advantages in quantum information processing and quantum computation compared with linear optics methods , and possesses great potential for a variety of emerging technologies  @xcite .",
    "however , there is no direct interaction between single photons in physics according to the quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) .",
    "hence , it is of great importance to achieve the interaction between single photons .",
    "the most popular method to generate the strong nonlinear effects between photons is spontaneous parametric down - conversion , which is used especially as a source of entangled photon pairs  @xcite .",
    "examples of such quantum optical phenomena have been investigated experimentally including generation of quadrature squeezing states and two - photon entanglement sates in various degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "generally , the typical nonlinear optical phenomenon occurs only at very high optical intensities and the degree of nonlinearity between single photons is very low  @xcite .",
    "however , producing high - degree nonlinearity at very low mean - photon level is desirable in many quantum information processing applications  @xcite , such as , photon blockade effect which plays an important role as an effective single photon source in quantum information processing .",
    "recently , some similar nonlinear effects such as cross phase modulation @xcite and spontaneous downconversion @xcite have been observed with a single - photon level pump .",
    "these nonlinearities at single - photon level are also obtained through optical cavity in which photon - photon interaction is relatively strong @xcite .",
    "recently , gupta _ et al . _",
    "@xcite experimentally investigated the kerr nonlinearity and dispersive optical bistability of a fabry - perot ( fp ) optical cavity arising from the long lived coherent motion of ultracold atoms trapped within .",
    "they reported that the strong nonlinearity would be observed at low average intracavity photon number level @xmath0 , and even at as low as @xmath1 .",
    "the photon blockade effect was also found in optomechanical systems  @xcite , where the kerr interaction between photons is induced by the strong optomechanical coupling .",
    "it is known that the linear coupling between an external classical field and a single - mode cavity can result in a linear driving to create a coherent state of the cavity field .",
    "if we assume that the single - mode cavity field is driven by an external driving field with frequency @xmath2 , then the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath3 where @xmath4@xmath5 is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of the single - mode radiation field and @xmath6 is the related driving strength .",
    "the corresponding energy spectrum of the output field of the cavity is of the lorentz form .",
    "however , the underlying mechanism to explain this simple phenomenon is not clear until now . in this paper",
    ", we revisit this well known effect by giving a microscopic explanation of physical mechanism for such linear driving . here , a classical field is applied to one wall of a fp cavity , which is modeled as a two - level atomic ensemble where the two levels can be imagined as excited and non - excited states of local exictons .",
    "when the decay rate of the atomic ensemble is much larger than the decay of the cavity , the re - combination of the low excitations of the ensemble in the wall will mediate a linear driving for the single - mode field inside the cavity .",
    "furthermore , if the higher - order excitation of the atomic ensemble is taken into account , the single - mode cavity field exhibits some interesting nonlinear photonic phenomena .    when the external driving field is weak , but the coupling between atomic ensemble ( the cavity wall ) and the cavity mode is strong , the kerr non - linear effect is dominant in the effective hamiltonian of photons , which produces the photon blockade phenomena . in this case",
    ", we found that the strong nonlinearity as well as photon blockade of our system would occurr at low intracavity photon number , even tough as low as @xmath7 .    on the contrary , for the case of strong driving and weak coupling ( between the atomic ensemble and the cavity ) ,",
    "the light - squeezing nonlinear effect is dominant . for weak coupling between atomic ensemble and single - mode cavity field we found that in our system the optical bistability , even quad - stability phenomena would appear with increasing the driving strength . from the output intensity spectrum of single - mode cavity field",
    ", we found that the squeezed effect of the output field occurs when the driving strength increases .",
    "we also found that the maximum squeezing takes place at the vicinity of resonance point .",

    "ii , we describe our model with an effective hamiltonian in terms of collective low excitation operators of atomic ensemble ( cavity wall ) , and present the clear microscopic explanation to indirect quantum driving . in sec .",
    "iii , we consider the effects of higher - order excitation of atomic ensemble ( cavity wall ) and obtain the effective hamiltonian of single - mode cavity field , which describes the very interesting nonlinear photonic phenomena by controlling some corresponding parameters of the system . in sec .",
