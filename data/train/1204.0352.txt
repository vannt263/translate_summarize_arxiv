    "recently , a new method has been introduced , called single - photon cooling @xcite , which allows to cool atoms and molecules which can not be handled in a standard way .",
    "the method is based on an atom diode or one - way barrier @xcite .",
    "an atom diode is a device which can be passed by the atom only in one direction whereas the atom is reflected if coming from the opposite direction .",
    "such a device has been studied theoretically @xcite and also experimentally implemented as a realization of a maxwell demon @xcite .",
    "the idea of cooling based on an atom diode is explained in @xcite and @xcite . for illustration",
    ", we assume a simplified , idealized one - dimensional setting and an ensemble of non - interacting atoms which are moving classically in a harmonic potential trap , see fig .",
    "[ fig_intro_1 ] . during the whole cooling process",
    "the atom diode is moved slowly through the trap from right to left with a constant velocity .",
    "in addition , we assume that the width of the diode is negligible .",
    "an atom can cross the atom diode only from left to right and after such a crossing the atom is trapped on the right - hand side of the diode .    for simplification let us look in the following at the process for a single atom of the ensemble , see fig .",
    "[ fig_intro_1 ] and also @xcite .",
    "as the diode is moving much slower than the atom the diode captures every atom near its classical turning point , i.e. the atom has very low kinetic energy when it is caught . if the atom crosses the diode from left to right then this is an irreversible process , the atom can not go back , i.e. the atom is caught between the diode and the trap wall .",
    "note that the implementations of an atom diode presented in @xcite are designed in such a way that the internal state of the atom is changed during the passing of the diode but it will be restored at the end in such a way that the atom is in the same internal state before and after crossing the diode .",
    "the diode , which is in principle a semi - penetrable barrier , behaves like a wall for the captured atom and continues moving to the left without changing its velocity . during this",
    "the atom is bouncing off the slowly - moving diode and in such a way the kinetic energy of the atom is reduced . note that the total energy is not conserved during this process ( a hamiltonian describing the system would be time - dependent ) .",
    "so the diode transports the caught atom to the bottom of the potential without increasing the kinetic energy of the atom , on the contrary , the kinetic energy of the atom might be even more decreased .",
    "this can be heuristically compared with a ball bouncing on a horizontal racket where the racket is slowly moved down in the gravity field : then the ball is not bouncing `` more '' if the racket is arrived at the bottom .",
    "note that even if the atom has reached the bottom of the trap , diode still continues moving to the left .",
    "finally , the atom is in the same external potential ( this is different for example from @xcite ) and in the same internal state as it was initially , but its total energy has been reduced .",
    "if the process acts on the whole ensemble of non - interacting atoms -of a given temperature initially- then the energy of every atom is reduced and therefore the ensemble is cooled .",
    "it is important to underline that -because of the irreversible step- this cooling method is fundamentally different from velocity reduction by collision with a moving wall which is not `` real '' cooling @xcite .",
    "several variations of this cooling method have been proposed and applied in various experiments , both for cooling atoms @xcite and for cooling molecules @xcite .    as a variant to the scheme shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_intro_1 ] , a small optical dipole trap has been used in experiment @xcite .",
    "the small trap is constructed in the form of a square box @xcite and therefore we will simply call it `` box '' in this paper ( not to be confused with the external potential trap ) .",
    "the key idea is that this small box is moved slowly though the external potential . in an ideal setting , the walls of the box consist of atom diodes :",
    "if the atom has crossed a wall of the box and the kinetic energy of the atom is lower than the threshold energy of the `` diodic '' wall ( called the threshold energy of the box in the following ) then the atom is irreversibly caught by the box .",
    "note that in the ideal case the caught atom is in the same internal state as before the catching , see also @xcite .",
    "in such a way , a similar effect as shown in fig .  [ fig_intro_1 ] may be achieved .",
    "it is important that the box is moved in such a way that it traps a maximal number of atoms .",
    "while this optimal trajectory of the box is straightforward in a one - dimensional setting , this is not obvious in higher dimensions . in @xcite ,",
    "a two - dimensional wedge trap has been examined . in that paper",
    "the box was assumed to be at rest and the optimal position of the box was determined .",
    "the main goal of our paper is to extend this work @xcite and show that by a slowly moving box the cooling efficiency can be improved compared to a box at rest .",
    "therefore , we will examine a simplified model of catching process in a two - dimensional wedge trap as well as in a two - dimensional harmonic trap , see fig .",

    "[ sect2 ] , the model will be explained in detail .",
    "we will then examine the setting of a two - dimensional wedge trap in sect .",
    "[ sect3 ] and of a two - dimensional harmonic trap in sect .",
    "[ sect4 ] .",
    "we examine two different two - dimensional trap geometries .",
    "the first one is an idealized two - dimensional , symmetric wedge trap consisting of perfectly reflecting walls , see fig .",
    "[ fig_intro_2]a .",
    "gravity is acting in @xmath0 direction .",
    "the hamiltonian of a single atom in this trap is @xmath1 where @xmath2 if @xmath3 and @xmath4 otherwise .",
    "moreover , @xmath5 is the mass of the atom and @xmath6 is the gravitational acceleration at the earth s surface .",
    "the second trap is a two - dimensional harmonic trap , see fig .",
    "[ fig_intro_2]b .",
    "the hamilton function of a single atom in this trap is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the frequency of the harmonic trap .    in both cases , we approximate the motion of the atoms as a classical motion and in addition , we assume that the atoms inside the trap do not interact with each other .",
    "so the trajectory of a single atom can be calculated by solving hamilton s equations @xmath9 the initial state of a single atom should be distributed concerning the canonical probability distribution with temperature @xmath10 @xmath11\\ , , \\label{rho0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the canonical partition function , @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "our simplified model of the catching process is similar to and motivated by @xcite .",
    "we model the `` box '' , as a square box in space with a width @xmath15 in @xmath16 and in @xmath17 direction , i.e. @xmath18 is the half width of the box .",
    "the box can move freely throughout the trap .",
    "we assume that the `` diodic '' walls of box are infinitely thin .",
    "moreover , the `` diodic '' walls of the box have a certain threshold energy @xmath19 such that their `` diodic '' behavior breaks down if the kinetic energy of the atom is above this threshold energy .",
    "if the atom has crossed -at some time- the walls of the box and the kinetic energy of the atom in the box rest frame is smaller than the threshold energy @xmath19 then the atom is caught irreversibly by the box for all times .",
    "if the kinetic energy of the atom is too large ( larger than @xmath19 ) then the `` diodic '' property of walls breaks down and the atom can escape the box such that it might have a second chance later to be caught .",
    "the algorithm is now the following : for a single numerical run , we choose the initial state of a single atom randomly with respect to the probability distribution eq .",
    "( [ rho0 ] ) .",
    "then we calculate numerically the evolution of the atom until a final time @xmath20 while always checking if the atom is in the region of the box during its motion .",
    "if this is the case , we are checking if the kinetic energy of the atom in the box rest frame is smaller than the box threshold energy @xmath19 .",
    "if this is true , then the atom is caught and the run is finished , otherwise the motion of the atom continues and it may get trapped later .",
    "we repeat such a single run @xmath21 times , get the total number of trapped atoms @xmath22 and finally the relative number of trapped atoms , i.e. the fraction @xmath23 .    the goal of this paper is to optimize this fraction @xmath24 by varying the trajectory of the box in the trap .",
    "as we will see now , from this follows also an optimization of the cooling efficiency if the initial conditions and the box parameters are fixed .",
    "one can define a cooling efficiency as the compression of the phase - space density .",
    "phase - space density in the context of cooling can be defined as the number of atoms in a box with sides of one `` thermal de broglie wavelength '' @xcite .",
    "the `` thermal de broglie wavelength '' @xmath25 can be defined as @xmath26 where @xmath5 is the mass of the atom .",
    "the phase - space density in a two - dimensional setting is then defined as @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the spatial density of atoms .",
    "the relative change in phase - space density is therefore @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the initial and @xmath31 is the final phase - space density . @xmath10 and @xmath32 are the initial and final temperature , respectively",
    ".    the initial distribution will be a canonical one with temperature @xmath10 .",
    "the initial spatial density @xmath33 is strictly speaking not constant in space .",
    "nevertheless , we set approximately @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the initial number of atoms . to get @xmath36",
    ", we fix a small @xmath37 and define the initial region @xmath36 such that the atom is initially in @xmath36 with probability @xmath38 .",
    "the final spatial density is set as @xmath39 , where @xmath22 is the number of trapped atoms and @xmath40 is the area of the box .",
    "the cooling efficiency @xmath41 is then defined as @xmath42 here @xmath43 . for simplicity ,",
    "the final temperature is approximated by the threshold energy of the box , i.e. @xmath44 . the cooling efficiency depends on the fraction of trapped atoms @xmath23 , the ratio of the area of the thermal system to the area of the box , @xmath45 , and the ratio of the initial to final energy , @xmath46 : @xmath47 if the initial conditions and the box parameters are fixed , it will be therefore sufficient to optimize the fraction of trapped atoms @xmath24 .",
