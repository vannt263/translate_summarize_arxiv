    "much attention has been attracted to the dynamic behavior of confined colloidal suspensions recently @xcite . in real circumstances , particles are usually spatially confined in special environments , such as microfluidic devices , porous media , fluid interface and cell membrane @xcite .",
    "the dynamical behaviors of colloids in spatially confined environments are more complicated than that in unbounded three - dimensional ( 3d ) fluid bulk . in the unbounded 3d bulk suspensions ,",
    "the longitudinal and transverse correlated diffusion coefficient @xmath6 and @xmath7 are well known as @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "for the particles confined near the solid wall , the strength of hydrodynamic interactions ( his ) decay with inter - particle separation @xmath2 as @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "in addition , spatial symmetry break due to the boundary conditions brings asymmetry feature to cross correlated diffusion of particles @xcite . for the particles on the air - water interface or a viscous membrane , both experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite studies show @xmath8 and @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath13 @xmath14 calculation @xcite showed that at the membrane adjacent to a solid wall , the correlated diffusion of particles is a function of the distance between the membrane and solid wall .",
    "the influence of different boundary conditions could be directly reflected on diffusion behavior of particles @xcite .",
    "many studies base on solid wall condition , a non - slip boundary , which could cut off the fluid field in its vicinity . for a fluid - fluid interface ( say a soft wall )",
    ", there is a slip boundary which partially transforms the flow field around . compared with extensive investigations on the solid wall s effects",
    ", there are few experimental studies about the influences of the fluid - fluid interface on particles correlated diffusion .    in this paper , we report the experimental measurement of the cross - correlated diffusion of colloidal particles near the water - decahydronaphthalene ( decalin ) interface .",
    "the particle monolayer is similar to a viscous membrane . the correlated diffusion of particle pair shows asymmetric behavior in two normal directions . along the line joining the centers of particles ,",
    "the decay rate of correlated diffusion is constant . at the perpendicular direction , the decay rate increases with the particle separation . in both directions ,",
    "the correlated diffusion is independent of the area fraction of particles for long particles separation .",
    "the influence of fluid - fluid interface on the dynamic behavior of the colloidal monolayer tends to be saturated , when the particle separation is much larger than the distance between the interface and monolayer .",
    "these phenomena reveal weights of his through different paths .    the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii is devoted to the description of the experimental setup .",
    "experimental results and discussions are presented in sec .",
    "finally , the work is summarized in sec .",
    "two kinds of colloidal particle with the same diameter d = 2.0v@xmath15 are used in the experiment .",
    "the first one is polystyrene ( ps ) latex spheres purchased from invitrogen with sulfate and high density of carboxyl functional groups on the surface .",
    "the other one is silica spheres purchased from bangs , which have anionic @xmath16 groups on the surface when dispersed in water .",
    "the density of the silica spheres are about 1.9 times larger than that of ps .",
    "both the polystyrene and silica spheres are the representative of charged particles commonly used in colloidal science .",
    "the experimental setup is similar to that described in ref .",
    "the sample cell is made from a stainless steel disk with an inner container in which there is a hole with the diameter 8.3 @xmath17 .",
    "the bottom of the hole is sealed with a 0.1 @xmath17 thick glass cover slip , which also serves as an optical window .",
    "we first fill the hole to the top edge with deionized water of 18.2 @xmath18 in which the particles cleaned 7 times by centrifugation were suspended .",
    "and then we add decalin ( a mixture of cis and trans with density 0.896 @xmath19 ) to the top of the water , filling the entire height of the inner container .",
    "the solvent decalin was purchased from sigma - aldrich .",
    "another cover slip is used to cover the top of the inner container with the water - decalin interface sandwiched between the top and bottom cover slips .",
    "then we overturn the cell .",
    "particles fall onto the water - decalin interface caused by the gravity for one or two hours and form a monolayer , as shown in fig .",
    "the colloidal particles are hydrophilic and will prefer to stay in water rather than in decalin .",
    "in addition , particles keep a certain distance away from the interface because of image charge in decalin .",
    "the image charge force is repulsive for particles approach the decalin - water interface from the medium ( water ) with the higher dielectric constant @xcite .",
    "the water and decalin layers are both 0.8 @xmath17 high .",
    "the distance between the cover slip and colloidal monolayer is long enough to eliminate the influence of cover slips .    with an inverted microscope olympus coolsnapix71 ,",
    "the motion of colloidal particles was recorded by a digital camera ( prosilica ge1050 ) of 14 frames per second .",
    "each image sequence includes 500 consecutive frames ( @xmath20 sec ) .",
    "each image is of size @xmath21 . from these image sequences , using homemade software , we obtain the particle positions and construct trajectories with a spatial resolution of 60 - 100 nm .",
    "interaction potential @xmath22 of particles was estimated from pair correlated function @xmath23 of particles .",
    "@xmath2 is the particle separation . at dilute limit",
    ", @xmath23 is related to @xmath22 through the function of @xmath24 . in our experiment , @xmath23 was calculated by averaging @xmath25 particle positions under area fraction @xmath26 for ps and silica spheres . for even higher area fractions @xmath27 ,",
    "measured @xmath23 of ps and silica spheres could overlap with the formers respectively .",
    "that indicates the area fraction used could be regarded as the dilute limit .",

    "the depth is around @xmath32 at @xmath33 .",
    "what we found accords with the results in ref .",
    "@xcite : like charge particles could attract each other near an interface .",
    "ps particle shows a wider and deeper attractive potential than silica , because it has more surface charge than silica @xcite .",
    "ps monolayer is located at higher position above the oil - water interface than silica because ps sphere has less mass density and more surface charge . the average distance @xmath34 from particle monolayer to the interface could be estimated by measuring the single diffusion coefficient of particles . from the particle trajectories",
    "@xmath35 , we calculated the single - particle mean square displacement ( msd ) @xmath36 . the self - diffusion coefficient @xmath37 is obtained according to the equation @xmath38 for different particle area fraction @xmath5 .",
    "figure 3 shows the dependence of the diffusion coefficient @xmath39 on @xmath5 for ps and silica spheres .",
    "@xmath40 is the diffusion coefficient of a single particle in water .",
    "the solid lines in fig .",
    "3 are the second - order polynomial fitted results , @xmath41 the parameter @xmath42 stands for the local viscosity felt by a single sphere at dilute limit : the larger @xmath42 is , the smaller the viscosity is .",
    "the parameter @xmath43 reflects the strength of two body his between the spheres : the smaller @xmath43 , the smaller two - body his .",
    "the fitted values of @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are given in table i.    the value of @xmath42 can be used to estimate the distance between the interface and the sphere monolayer @xmath34 . according to the classical prediction given by lee @xmath13 @xmath14 @xcite , the distance from particle s center to the interface @xmath34",
    "can be written as : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is particle radius , @xmath47 is the viscosity of water and @xmath48 @xmath49 is the viscosity of decalin at 22.5 @xmath50 . substituting the fitted values of @xmath42 into eq .",
    "2 , we obtain @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) for ps ( silica ) sphere . the calculation is consistent well with the experimental observation under the microscope : particles keeps @xmath53 distance away from the interface .",
    "the particles slightly fluctuate in vertical direction under @xmath54 .",
    "the fluctuation amplitude of silica particles is smaller than ps because the former has heavier mass density . within the area fraction region we measured ,",
    "particles near the interface could be viewed as a monolayer .",
    "we focus our investigation on the lateral motion of particles , parallel to the oil - water interface , in following part of the paper .    following the trajectory @xmath55 of individual particles @xmath56",
    ", particles cross - correlated motion is obtained via the ensemble averaged tensor product of the particle displacements @xcite : @xmath57 here @xmath58 .",
    "@xmath59 are particle indicates , @xmath60 and @xmath61 represent different coordinates , and @xmath2 is the separation between particle @xmath56 and @xmath62 ( shown as the inset of fig .",
    "the off - diagonal elements are uncorrelated .",
    "we focus on the diagonal elements of this tensor product : @xmath63 which indicates the correlated motion along the line joining the centers of particles ( called parallel direction ) , and @xmath64 which represents the correlated motion perpendicular to this line ( called perpendicular direction ) .",
    "we found that the measured correlated motion @xmath63 and @xmath64 are linear functions of @xmath65 for small lag time @xmath65 .",
    "thus , the cross - correlated diffusion coefficients are defined as @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",

    "the behaviors of @xmath6 and @xmath7 of ps and silica monolayer are qualitatively similar . with the increase of @xmath2 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 of ps and silica sphere decrease following the power law .",
    "the specific form of the power law will be discussed in the following section .",
    "when @xmath28 , the curves of @xmath3 and @xmath4 for different @xmath5 almost collapse onto a single curve respectively , i.e. , particle area fraction hardly affects the particles cross - correlated motion .",
    "when @xmath68 , however , @xmath4 is dependent on the area fraction @xmath5 . with the increase of @xmath5 , the decay rate of @xmath4 decreases , i.e. , the curves become more flat .",
    "the mechanism of @xmath5 independence effect mentioned above is in line with oppenheimer @xmath13 @xmath14 s theoretical description in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the particle monolayer",
    ", the far - field response of the correlated particle motion mainly arises from the momentum diffusion through the 3d surrounding fluid .",
    "usually the viscosity of 3d fluid suspension is the function of volume fraction @xmath69 of particles . in our system",
    "@xmath69 could be regarded as zero almost , no matter how the area fraction @xmath5 of monolayer changes .",
    "the viscosity of 3d fluid almost keeps as a constant .",
    "thus the far - field 3d his between the particles are independent of the area fraction @xmath5 , so does the cross - correlated diffusion @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath14 @xcite also observed the similar concentration independent effects for particles confined between two plates , but the reasons to their phenomena are different . in the confined particle monolayer",
    ", the fluid momentum is absorbed by the solid boundaries , and the far - field fluid response arises solely from mass - dipole perturbation , which is not influenced by the presence of neighbor particles .",
    "the situation will be more complicated for short @xmath2 ( @xmath70 ) , because the particles reveal an attractive potential in the range ( fig .",
    "both his and thermodynamic interaction involve in particle s correlated motion now . for the potential is attractive , the correlation of particle motion will become stronger in the range . as a result ,",
    "the curves become more flat . for his ,",
    "the near - field response of the correlated motion mainly arises from the momentum diffusion through the two - dimensional ( 2d ) colloidal layer itself .",
    "the 2d monolayer viscosity @xmath71 increases with the area fraction @xmath5 of the particles . as a result ,",
    "the correlated motion is a function of @xmath5 .    to focus on the influences of the oil - water interface on the correlated diffusion and eliminate the @xmath5 effects",
    ", we average the data of different @xmath5 in fig .",
    "4 . figure 5 shows the averaged correlated diffusion coefficient @xmath3 and @xmath4 normalized by @xmath72 , which is the single particle diffusion coefficient obtained by eq .",

    "there is @xmath73 @xmath74 .",
    "here , @xmath75 is the amplitude coefficient and @xmath76 is the decay rate of cross - correlated motion .",
    "the interface affects only the amplitude @xmath75 but not the decay rate @xmath77 .",
    "the amplitude @xmath75 of the silica spheres is larger than that of ps , which is in accordance with the results from single diffusion measurement : the fitted value of @xmath43 of silica is greater than that of ps in table i. the phenomenon indicates that the strength of his between the particle pair is more strong in the silica monolayer than in ps monolayer .",
    "the amplitude of @xmath75 of the silica spheres is found almost 1.2 times larger than that of ps , which number is just equal to the ratio of the @xmath43 ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "the same decay rate @xmath76 for both monolayers indicates that the form of his is hardly affected by the interface in the parallel direction .    at the perpendicular direction , @xmath79 @xmath80 .",

    "5 shows that the scaled diffusion coefficient @xmath84 ) for both ps and silica particles , where @xmath85 .",
    "both curves are overlapped at long region of @xmath86 , which indicates the effect of the liquid - liquid interface tends to be saturated .",
    "we compare our results with the studies before for different boundary conditions : the colloidal spheres dispersed in unbounded 3d bulk , confined by the solid wall or at the air - water interface @xcite .",
    "we find the cross correlated motion of colloidal spheres near oil - water interface is similar to that of a viscous membrane @xcite : @xmath76 and @xmath87 at long @xmath2 limit . for a viscous membrane , long @xmath2 limit means that @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is saffman length @xcite .",
    "@xmath71 is the 2d membrane viscosity and @xmath90 is the 3d bulk viscosity of surrounding fluid",
    ". for our system , limit of long @xmath2 means that @xmath91 .",
    "@xmath92 is the larger one between @xmath34 and @xmath93 .",
    "theory in @xcite shows that the @xmath94 does not depend on membrane viscosity @xmath71 for large @xmath2 , but @xmath95 is dependent on @xmath71 .",
    "this prediction accords with our results of @xmath77 and @xmath82 .",
    "our results suggest that the colloidal monolayer near the the interface could be regarded as a membrane. even though the precise value of 2d viscosity @xmath71 of colloidal monolayer is hard to be obtained from our present data , the value of @xmath82 ( 1.8 or 1.5 ) indicates the @xmath71 usually is very small . for a membrane with viscosity @xmath71 , the value of @xmath82 will approach to 2 at low @xmath71 limit and approach to 0 for high @xmath71 limit @xcite .",
    "precisely , @xmath4 will tend to a logarithmic form at high @xmath71 limit .",
    "hence @xmath93 should be very small also , and the limit of long @xmath2 usually means @xmath96 in our system .    at first glance ,",
    "the result that @xmath97 for the silica spheres is larger than @xmath98 for ps seems confusing , which conflicts with the fact that a larger @xmath99 should corresponds to a smaller monolayer viscosity .",
    "since the silica spheres are closer to the interface , it is located in a more viscous environment comparing with ps .",
    "thus , @xmath82 of the silica spheres seems should be less than that of ps .",
    "the fact is that the viscosity @xmath100 felt by the spheres is the 3d viscosity of the local surrounding fluid , not the 2d viscosity @xmath71 of the membrane .",
    "the influence of this surrounding viscosity @xmath100 has been removed by @xmath101 scaling , where @xmath42 stands for the effect of local viscosity @xmath100 .",
    "the result that @xmath82 of silica is larger than @xmath82 of ps stems from his modified by the interface .",
    "oil is more viscous than water .",
    "the flow field induced by the particle in water is suppressed by the oil - water interface .",
    "his between particles decay faster with their separation @xmath2 when the monolayer is closer to the interface , which leads to a larger measured @xmath82 for a smaller @xmath34 .",

    "iii ) the flow through the upper water bulk or the below oil bulk .",
    "his through path i is dependent on 2d monolayer viscosity @xmath71 , while his through path ii and iii are dependent on 3d viscosity @xmath102 and @xmath47 of surrounding fluid .",
    "the cross - correlated motion caused by his through path i is a function of @xmath5 , because @xmath71 is a function of @xmath5 usually .",

    "is very small . with @xmath2 increasing ,",
    "the weight of his through path i decreases quickly .",
    "meanwhile , his through path ii contributes to correlated motion all the time .",
    "so , correlated motion is a function of @xmath34 ( see fig .",
    "5 ) . at long separation limit @xmath91 , the his through path iii dominate . since",
    "@xmath102 and @xmath47 are hardly changed with area fraction @xmath5 , the correlated motion should be independent of @xmath5 ( see fig .",
    "the correlated motion is also independent of @xmath34 for @xmath96 . at middle range of @xmath2 ,",

    "correlated diffusion coefficient @xmath3 and @xmath4 are independent of area fraction @xmath5 unless at the short pair separation @xmath2 .",
    "the interface affects correlated diffusion coefficient @xmath3 and @xmath4 distinctly .",
    "the interface enhances the amplitude of @xmath3 , but does not affect its decay rate .",
    "the results indicate : along the line joining the centers of particle pair , the interface modifies the amplitude of the his between the particle pairs , but not the form of his . at the direction perpendicular to the line , the influence of the interface changes with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "the interface enhances the decay rate at short @xmath2 , while such influence tends to be saturated at the long @xmath2 limit ( @xmath104 , @xmath34 is the distance between the interface and the monolayer ) .",
