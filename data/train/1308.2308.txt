    "this paper is partially motivated by the fact that the analysis by saito & uwaha , being to - date the only one published which targets the anisotropic step dynamics , does not reveal effects of the anisotropic line energy on the step linear stability ; we try to close this gap for the case of strong anisotropy and also analyze some aspects of the nonlinear step dynamics . by strong anisotropy we mean that through smooth , twice - differentiable line energy the facet is still not allowed to have zero curvature , but sharp corners are possible - due to the assumed negative values of the step stiffness for some orientations - when there is no material deposition on the surface and the temperature is very low or zero .",

    "[ coarsening_f=2_alpha_varies ] , that the coarsening exponents are much larger in the present case , and the steady - state length scales are also much larger , signaling the reduction in the number of kinks compared to the number expected from @xmath127 by as much as 50% even for these relatively small values of @xmath35 . again averaging the data from the three curves",
    "gives @xmath158 for the first and the second regime , respectively .",
    "coarsening is the fastest in the first regime .",
    "the step velocity exhibits the behavior very similar to the one in fig .",
    "[ velocity_f=2_alpha_varies ] , including the linear dependence of the steady - state velocity on the anisotropy strength .",
    "in this paper , a longwave pde is formulated for the description of the strongly anisotropic step dynamics within the framework of a one - sided model . written in terms of the step slope",
    ", the pde can be represented in the form similar to a convective cahn - hilliard equation .",
    "analysis of the model shows , most importantly , that the linear stability of a step depends not only on the strength of the adatoms flux from the terrace to the step , but also on the sign and the strength of the line energy anisotropy parameter @xmath2 .",
    "the latter observation is entirely new .",
    "however , it should not come as a complete surprise , since the mathematical structure of the one - sided step evolution model is similar to the model of solidification into a hypercooled melt @xcite .",
    "that model involves the concentration field dynamics on one side of the interface only ( in the liquid phase ) , and it is well - known and accepted that the linear stability depends on the anisotropy strength .",
    "consequently , the results of our modeling remind those obtained in ref . @xcite .",
    "specifically , we found that it matters whether the step stiffness is a minimum or a maximum in the direction of the step growth . in the former case , when @xmath2 is larger than the threshold value , the critical flux that destabilizes",
    "the step is _ less _ than the equilibrium value , and it is even possible to destabilize the step by anisotropy alone by taking @xmath2 large enough .",
    "that is , the flux and the anisotropy complement each other in destabilizing the step .",
    "though in the latter case , the critical flux is larger than the equilibrium value for any @xmath2 .    in the computations of the nonlinear dynamics with the strong anisotropy , most interestingly",
    ", we found the emergence and coarsening of the long - wavelength deformation of the step , which goes on simultaneously with the ( non - uniform in time ) coarsening of the hill - and - valley structure .",
    "we characterized the coarsening of the latter structure as a function of the anisotropy and the flux , and our future research will focus on the analysis of the former process .",
    "i am very grateful to olivier pierre - louis for reading the first draft of the paper and making many valuable comments and suggestions .",
    "michel jabbour is acknowledged for bringing the anisotropic step dynamics to my attention .                    expansion of @xmath3 in powers of @xmath160 results in the additive contribution to the surface energy .",
    "this additive contribution is proportional to the square of the surface curvature ; the coefficient , usually denoted by @xmath114 , is called the regularization parameter ( @xcite , p. 208 ) . accordingly , a corner on a surface ( large curvature ) posesses an additional energy and thus it is penalized - since the system seeks the state of a minimum energy . as pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite , the idea of regularization by curvature goes back to the classical work of conyers herring @xcite ."
