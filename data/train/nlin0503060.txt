    "a comprehensive understanding of hamiltonian dynamics is a long outstanding problem in nonlinear and statistical physics , which has important applications in various other areas of physics .",
    "typical hamiltonian systems are nonhyperbolic as they exhibit mixed phase space with coexisting regular and chaotic regions . over the past years",
    ", a number of ground - breaking works @xcite have increasingly elucidated the asymptotic behavior of such systems and it is now well understood that , because of the stickiness due to kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) tori , the chaotic dynamics of typical hamiltonian systems is fundamentally different from that of hyperbolic , fully chaotic systems . here",
    "`` asymptotic '' means in the limit of large time scales and small length scales .",
    "but in realistic situations , the time and length scales are limited . in the case of hyperbolic systems , this is not a constraint because the ( statistical ) self - similarity of the underlying invariant sets guarantees the fast convergence of the dynamical invariants ( entropies , lyapunov exponents , fractal dimensions , escape rates , etc ) and the asymptotic dynamics turns out to be a very good approximation of the dynamics at finite scales . in nonhyperbolic systems , however , the self - similarity is usually lost because the invariant sets are not statistically invariant under magnifications . as a result ,",
    "the finite - scale behavior of a hamiltonian system may be fundamentally different from the asymptotic behavior considered previously , which is in turn hard to come by either numerically @xcite or experimentally @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the dynamics of hamiltonian systems at finite , physically relevant scales . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this problem has not been considered before .",
    "herewith we focus on hamiltonian chaotic scattering , which is one of the most prevalent manifestations of chaos in open systems , with examples ranging from fluid dynamics @xcite to solid - state physics @xcite to general relativity @xcite .",
    "we show that the finite - scale dynamics of a hamiltonian system is characterized by _ effective _ dynamical invariants ( e.g. , effective fractal dimension ) , which : ( 1 ) may be significantly different from the corresponding invariants of the asymptotic dynamics ; ( 2 ) depend on the resolution but can be regarded as constants over many decades in a given region of the phase space ; and ( 3 ) may change drastically from one region to another of the _ same _ dynamically connected ( ergodic ) component .",
    "these features are associated with the slow and nonuniform convergence of the invariant measure due to the breakdown of self - similarity in nonhyperbolic systems . to illustrate the mechanism behind the properties of the effective invariants , we introduce a simple deterministic model which we build on the observation that a hamiltonian system can be represented as a chain of hyperbolic systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start , in sec .",
    "[ s2 ] , with the analysis of the invariant measure and the outline of the transport structures underlying its convergence .",
    "our chain model is introduced and analyzed in sec . [ 3 ] .",
    "the effective fractal dimension is defined in sec . [",
    "4 ] and its properties are verified for a specific system in sec . [ 5 ] .",
    "conclusions are presented in the last section .",
    "for concreteness , consider a two - dimensional area preserving map with a major kam island surrounded by a chaotic region .",
    "one such map captures all the main properties of a wide class of hamiltonian systems with mixed phase space . when the system is open ( scattering )",
    ", almost all particles initialized in the chaotic region eventually escape to infinity .",
    "we first study this case with a diffusive model for the transversal motion close to the main kam island , obtaining an analytical expression for the probability density @xmath0 of particles remaining in the scattering region at time @xmath1 and distance @xmath2 from the island [ see appendix ] .",
    "we find that , in the case of chaotic scattering , a singularity develops and the invariant measure , given by @xmath3 , accumulates on the outermost kam torus of the kam island [ appendix ] .",
    "physically , this corresponds to the tendency of nonescaping particles to concentrate around the regular regions .",
    "dynamically , the stickiness due to kam tori underlies two major features of hamiltonian chaotic scattering , namely the algebraic decay of the survival probability of particles in the scattering region @xcite and the integer dimension of the chaotic saddle @xcite , and distinguishes this phenomenon from the hyperbolic chaotic scattering characterized by exponential decay and noninteger fractal dimension .",
    "however , the convergence of the measure is rather slow and highly nonuniform , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for typical parameters , which is in sharp contrast with the fast , uniform convergence observed in hyperbolic systems .",
    "our main results are ultimately related to this slow and nonuniform convergence of the invariant measure .",
    "previous works on transport in hamiltonian systems have used stochastic models , where invariant structures around kam islands are smoothened out and the dynamics is given entirely in terms of a diffusion equation @xcite or a set of transition probabilities ( markov chains or trees ) @xcite .",
    "the stochastic approach is suitable to describe transport properties ( as above ) , but can not be used to predict the behavior of dynamical invariants such as lyapunov exponents and fractal dimensions .",
    "here we adopt a deterministic approach where we use the cantori surrounding the kam islands to split the nonhyperbolic dynamics of the hamiltonian system into a chain of hyperbolic dynamical systems .",
    "cantori are invariant structures that determine the transversal transport close to the kam islands @xcite .",
    "there is a hierarchy of infinitely many cantori around each island .",
    "let @xmath4 denote the area of the scattering region outside the outermost cantorus , @xmath5 denote the annular area in between the first and second cantorus , and so on .",
    "as @xmath6 is increased , @xmath7 becomes thinner and approaches the corresponding island .",
    "for simplicity , we consider that there is a single island @xcite and that , in each iteration , a particle in @xmath7 may either move to the outer level @xmath8 or the inner level @xmath9 or stay in the same level @xcite .",
    "let @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote the transition probabilities from level @xmath6 to @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "a particle in @xmath4 may also leave the scattering region , and in this case we consider that the particle has escaped .",
    "the escaping region is denoted by @xmath14 .",
    "the chaotic saddle is expected to have points in @xmath7 for all @xmath15 .",
    "it is natural to assume that the transition probabilities @xmath10 and @xmath11 are constant in time .",
    "this means that each individual level can be regarded as a hyperbolic scattering system , with its characteristic exponential decay and noninteger chaotic saddle dimension .",
    "therefore , a nonhyperbolic scattering is in many respects similar to a sequence of hyperbolic scatterings .",
    "we now introduce a simple deterministic model that incorporates the above elements and reproduces essential features of the hamiltonian dynamics .",
    "our model is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and consists of a semi - infinite chain of 1-dimensional `` @xmath16-shaped '' maps , defined as follows : @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "if @xmath2 falls in the interval @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is not defined , the `` particle '' is considered to have crossed a cantorus to the `` outer level '' @xmath12 .",
    "this interval is mapped uniformly to @xmath23 $ ] , and the iteration proceeds through @xmath24 .",
    "symbolically , this is indicated by @xmath25 .",
    "similarly , if @xmath2 falls into @xmath26 , where @xmath27 , the particle goes to the `` inner level '' , and @xmath28 .",
    "particles that reach @xmath29 are considered to have escaped .",
    "the domain of @xmath22 is denoted by @xmath30 and is analogous to @xmath7 in a hamiltonian system , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 represent the transition probabilities .",
    "the transition rate ratios @xmath31 and @xmath32 are taken in the interval @xmath33 and are set to be independent of @xmath6 , where @xmath34 .",
    "the parameter @xmath35 is a measure of the fraction of particles in a level @xmath6 that will move to the inner level @xmath13 when leaving level @xmath6 , while @xmath36 is a measure of how much longer it takes for the particles in the inner level to escape .",
    "the nondependence on @xmath6 corresponds to the approximate scaling of the cantori suggested by the renormalization theory @xcite . despite the hyperbolicity of each map",
    ", the entire chain behaves as a nonhyperbolic system . for a uniform initial distribution in @xmath37 ,",
    "it is not difficult to show @xcite that the number of particles remaining in the chain after a long time @xmath1 decays algebraically as @xmath38 , and that the initial conditions of never escaping particles form a zero lebesgue measure fractal set with box - counting dimension 1 .",
    "however , the finite - scale behavior may deviate considerably from these asymptotics , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) we show the survival probability @xmath39 as a function of time . for small @xmath35 and @xmath36 , the curve is composed of a discrete sequence of exponentials with scaling exponents @xmath40 , which decrease ( in absolute value ) as we go forward in the sequence .",
    "the length of each exponential segment is of the order of @xmath35 in the decay of @xmath39 and @xmath41 in the variation of @xmath42 .",
    "this striking behavior is related to the time evolution of the density of particles inside the chain .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) , where we plot the average position @xmath43 of an ensemble of particles initialized in @xmath37 ( i.e. , @xmath44 ) .",
    "the transitions between successive exponentials in the decay of @xmath39 [ fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) ] match the transitions from a level @xmath6 to the next in the average position of the remaining particles [ fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) ] . in a hamiltonian system ,",
    "the increase of @xmath43 in time is related to the development of the singular invariant measure anticipated in our diffusion analysis [ see fig .  [ fig1 ] ] .",
    "the piecewise exponential behavior of @xmath39 is smoothened out for large @xmath35 and @xmath45 [ figs .",
    "[ fig3](a ) and [ fig3](b ) ] .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3](c ) we show the fractal dimension of the set of initial conditions of never escaping particles as computed from the uncertainty algorithm @xcite , which consists in measuring the scaling of the fraction @xmath46 of _ @xmath47-uncertain _ points ( initial points whose escaping time is different from the escaping time of points taken @xmath47 apart ) .",
    "the scaling is statistically well defined over decades and the exponent @xmath48 can be computed accurately .",
    "however , the resulting dimension @xmath49 is not only significantly smaller than 1 but also depends critically on the region @xmath50 of the phase space where it is computed .",
    "the convergence of the dimension is indeed so slow that it can only be noticed when observed over very many decades of resolution , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](d ) where data of fig .",
    "[ fig3](c ) is plotted over 35 decades !",
    "initially smaller , the dimension measured for @xmath51 approaches the dimension measured for @xmath52 as the scale @xmath47 is reduced beyond @xmath53 ( i.e. the corresponding curves in fig .  [ fig3](d ) become parallel ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](d ) , this behavior is related to a transition in the average innermost level @xmath54 reached by the particles launched from @xmath47-uncertain points . as @xmath47 is further reduced , new transitions are expected .",
    "the dimension measured in between transitions is mainly determined by the dimension @xmath55 , @xmath56 , of the corresponding element of the chain . for given @xmath6 and @xmath47 ,",
    "the measured dimension is larger when @xmath50 is taken in a denser part of the invariant set , such as in the subinterval of @xmath37 first mapped into @xmath57 [ fig .",
    "[ fig3](c ) ; diamonds ] , because @xmath58 is larger in these regions . in some regions",
    ", however , the measured dimension is quite different from the asymptotic value even at scales as small as @xmath59 .",
    "this slow convergence of the dimension is due to the slow increase of @xmath58 , which in a hamiltonian system is related to the slow convergence of the invariant measure [ fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ] .",
    "the convergence is even slower for smaller @xmath35 and larger @xmath36 .",
    "incidentally , the experimental measurements of the fractal dimension are usually based on scalings over less than two decades @xcite .",
    "therefore , at realistic scales the dynamics is clearly not governed by the asymptotic dynamical invariants .",
    "our results on the chain model motivate us to introduce the concept of effective dynamical invariants . as a specific example , we consider the _ effective _ fractal dimension , which , for the intersection of a fractal set @xmath60 with a @xmath61-dimensional region @xmath50 , we define as @xmath62 where @xmath63 , and @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the number of cubes of edge length @xmath66 needed to cover @xmath67 and @xmath50 , respectively @xcite .",
    "we take @xmath50 to be a generic segment of line [ i.e. , @xmath68 in eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) ] intersected by @xmath60 on a fractal set . in the limit @xmath69",
    ", we recover the usual box - counting dimension @xmath70 of the fractal set @xmath67 , which is known to be 1 for all our choices of @xmath50 . however , for any practical purpose , the parameter @xmath47 is limited and can not be made arbitrarily small ( e.g. , it can not be smaller than the size of the particles , the resolution of the experiment , and the length scales neglected in modeling the system ) . at scale @xmath47 the system behaves as if the fractal dimension were @xmath71 ( therefore `` effective '' dimension ) .",
    "in particular , the final state sensitivity of particles launched from @xmath50 , with the initial conditions known within accuracy @xmath72 , is determined by @xmath73 rather than @xmath74 : as @xmath47 is variated around @xmath72 , the fraction of particles whose final state is uncertain scales as @xmath75 , which is different from the prediction @xmath76 .",
    "this is important in this context because , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( where the effective dimension is given by @xmath49 ) , the value of @xmath71 may be significantly different from the asymptotic value @xmath77 even for unrealistically small @xmath47 and may also depend on the region of the phase space .",
    "similar considerations apply to many other invariants as well .",
    "we now return to the hamiltonian case .",
    "consider a scattering process in which particles are launched from a line @xmath50 transversal to the stable manifold @xmath78 of the chaotic saddle .",
    "based on the construction suggested by the chain model , it is not difficult to see that @xmath79 exhibits a hierarchical structure which is not self - similar and is composed of infinitely many nested cantor sets , each of which is associated with the dynamics inside one of the regions @xmath7 . as a consequence , the effective dimension @xmath71 in hamiltonian systems is expected to behave similarly to the effective dimension in the chain model [ figs .",
    "[ fig3](c ) and [ fig3](d ) ] .",
    "in particular , @xmath71 is expected to display a strong dependence on @xmath50 and a weak dependence on @xmath47 .",
    "we test our predictions on the area preserving hnon map : @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the bifurcation parameter . in this system ,",
    "typical points outside kam islands are eventually mapped to infinity . because of the symmetry @xmath82 , where @xmath83 , the stable and unstable manifolds of the chaotic saddle are obtained from each other by exchanging @xmath2 and @xmath84 . for @xmath85 , the system displays a period - one and a period - four major island , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) . in the same figure",
    "we also show the complex invariant structure around the islands , the stable manifold of the chaotic saddle , and three different choices for the line of starting points : a large interval away from the islands ( @xmath86 ) , a small subinterval of this interval where the stable manifold appears to be denser ( @xmath87 ) , and an interval closer to the islands ( @xmath88 ) .",
