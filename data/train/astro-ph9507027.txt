    "estimates of the magnetic field strength at the surface of neutron stars are obtained from several different scenarios : theoretical models of pulsar emission ( @xcite ) , the accretion flow in binary x - ray sources ( @xcite ) and observation of features in the spectra of pulsating x - ray sources which have been interpreted as cyclotron lines ( @xcite ) .",
    "for a recent review of all these topics the interested reader is addressed to the book by michel ( @xcite ) . in a sample of more than 300 pulsars the range of values of the surface magnetic field strength runs into the interval : @xmath1 ( gauss ) @xmath2 ( @xcite ) .",
    "very recently , several authors ( @xcite ) have proposed two different physical mechanisms leading to an amplification of some initial magnetic field in a collapsing star .",
    "fields as strong as @xmath3 , or even more , might be generated in new - born neutron stars .    according to ( @xcite ) , a mirror - asymmetric magnetic field distribution might arise in a rapidly and differentially rotating proto - neutron star having , originally , both a toroidal and a poloidal component .",
    "the field amplification due to differential rotation leads to the formation of an additional toroidal field from the poloidal one by twisting of the field lines .",
    "after the first 20 seconds of the life of a new - born neutron star ( basically , its kelvin - helmholtz epoch ) the induced toroidal magnetic field could be as huge as @xmath4 .    in a second scenario ( @xcite ) ,",
    "a dynamo action in a differentially rotating and convective young neutron star is responsible for the strengthening of some initial dipole field up to values of @xmath5 if the convective episodes arose during the main - sequence stage or to @xmath6 if the dipole field is generated after collapse .    in presence of a strong magnetic field",

    "the calculation of the corresponding emissivity , both analytically or numerically , is far from obvious .",
    "in fact , this calculation appears as a multiple integral and summation over the variables and quantum numbers involving the wave functions of the initial and final electron and the corresponding statistical weights .",
    "the wave function integrals lead to laguerre or bessel functions with a complicated behaviour , so that approximations in order to simplify the expressions are sometimes delicate .",
    "this in fact has lead to errors in the past literature .    in a recent paper , kaminker et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have studied the neutrino emissivity of the above process ( [ syn ] ) for moderately high magnetic fields @xmath8 and high densities , in the degenerate - relativistic regime for the electrons .",
    "they claim that , within these conditions , the emissivity is independent of the electron density .",
    "so far , to our knowledge , there are no numerical tests which confirm these results .    given all these circumstances , together with the interest of the problem , both from the theoretical and astrophysical point of view , we have considered useful to reexamine the existing results for the above regime .",

    "we have found a result which is in agreement with the one of kaminker et al .",
    "when the electron gas is in the classical regime .",
    "we also obtain agreement for the corresponding analytical expressions , which we present in a simpler way than these authors . for the quantum regime , however , we give analytical formulae which show the correct dependence on @xmath14 for large magnetic fields , in contrast to those given by kaminker et al",
    ". this fact would be particularly important if some of the magnetic field amplification mechanisms described above were physically realizable in nature .",
    "the influence of the neutrino - pair synchrotron radiation in presence of strong magnetic fields merits to be examined in different astrophysical scenarios , such as the delayed mechanism of type ii supernovae , neutrino cooling of proto - neutron stars during the kelvin epoch or the secular cooling of the neutron star .",
    "furthermore , the neutrinos originated from the combined effect of one of the proposed mechanisms to enhance the magnetic field and the neutrino - pair synchrotron radiation process could be envisaged as a signature of the mechanism itself .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss the calculation of the emissivity for the synchrotron process and present our main results .",
    "these results are illustrated with more detail in section 3 and 4 for two different regimes of the electron gas .",
    "we end in section 5 with some conclusions and remarks .",

    "another important feature is that only values of the argument @xmath91 close to @xmath79 will contribute .",

    "the numerical fit to these emissivities have been taken from @xcite .",
