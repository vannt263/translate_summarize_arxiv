    "a recent renewal of interest in brans - dicke ( bd ) theory [ 1 ] can be traced to the discovery by la and steinhardt [ 2 ] that the use of bd theory in place of general relativity can ameliorate the exit problem of inflationary cosmology .",
    "this is possible because the interaction of the bd scalar field with the metric slows the expansion from exponential to power - law .",
    "the bd theory contains only one dimensionless parameter , @xmath1 and the effective gravitational constant is inversely proportional to the scalar field @xmath2 .",
    "bd theory has been proved to be very effective regarding the recent study of cosmic acceleration [ 3 ] .",
    "this theory yields the correct newtonian weak - field limit , but solar system measurements of post - newtonian corrections require @xmath3 [ 4 ] . in the limit @xmath4 , the field @xmath2 becomes a constant [ 5 ] and we recover einstein gravity .",
    "this theory has very effectively solved the problems of inflation and the early and the late time behaviour of the universe .",
    "n. banerjee and d. pavon [ 3 ] have shown that bd scalar tensor theory can potentially solve the quintessence problem . the generalized bd theory [ 6 ]",
    "is an extension of the original bd theory with a time dependent coupling function @xmath1 . in generalized bd theory ,",
    "the bd parameter @xmath1 is a function of the scalar field @xmath2 .",
    "this has led to more general scalar - tensor gravity [ 7 ] being considered with a self - interacting potential [ 8 , 9 ] .",
    "modified bd theory with a self - interacting potential have also been introduced in this regard .",
    "bertolami and martins [ 10 ] have used this theory to present an accelerated universe for spatially flat model .",
    "they have obtained the solution for accelerated expansion with a potential @xmath5 and large @xmath6 , although they have not considered the positive energy conditions for the matter and scalar field .",
    "+ dynamical system theory [ 11 ] has been applied with great success in cosmology and astrophysics within the context of general relativity .",
    "this theory are used to describe the behaviour of complex dynamical systems usually by constructing differential equations .",
    "this theory deals with a long term qualitative behaviour of the formed differential equations .",
    "it does not concentrate to find the precise solutions of the system but provide answers like- whether the system is stable for long time and whether the stability depend on the initial conditions .",
    "besides the other scientific fields this theory is now become widely useful in the research of cosmology .",
    "its range of applicability has been enlarged by considering alternate theories of gravity , such as those which do not obey the principle of minimal coupling [ 12 ] , kaluza - klein [ 13 ] and scalar - tensor theories [ 14 ] .",
    "there are several works on qualitative analysis in dynamical system of frw cosmology in bd gravity [ 9 , 15 ] .",
    "there are some literature where the authors have studied dynamical evolution of some models where the universe is filled with dark energy on an interaction has occurred between dark matter or barotropic matter and some dark energies like generalized chaplygin gas [ 16 ] , new generalized chaplygin gas[17 ] , elko non standard spinor dark energy [ 18 ] , dbi essence [ 19 ] , non- minimally coupled scalar field [ 20 ] , k - essence [ 21 ] etc .",
    "there are some other approach of dynamical system analysis to diffrent model the universe on the frame work of loop quantum gravity and non linear electro dynamics [ 22 , 23 ] .",
    "some authors [ 9 , 24 ] have shown that the field equations for frw cosmological models could be reduced to a two dimensional dynamical system for any reasonable perfect fluid matter source in bd theory and in the presence of scalar potential , the cosmological dynamical system turns out to be generally three dimensional , apart from radiation dominated universes in which the system once more reduces to two dimensions .",
    "+ here we have considered an anisotropic model [ 25 , 26 ] containing perfect fluid and bd scalar field with self - interacting potential .",
    "the starting point of our work is to reduce the field equations to a three dimensional autonomous dynamical system . from the knowledge of mathematical features of the system",
    ", we have found the critical points and the exact solutions for the system of equations .",
    "some of the solutions are valid for fluids satisfying the equation of state and for particular values of @xmath7 .",
    "the stability around the critical points have been investigated .",
    "the self - interacting brans - dicke ( bd ) theory is described by the action : ( choosing @xmath8 )    @xmath9\\ ] ]    where @xmath10 is the self - interacting potential for the bd scalar field @xmath2 and @xmath1 is the bd parameter .",
    "the matter content of the universe is composed of perfect fluid , @xmath11    where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are respectively energy density and isotropic pressure . + from the lagrangian density @xmath14 we obtain the field equations @xmath15 + \\frac{1}{\\phi}\\left[\\phi   _ { , \\mu ; \\nu } -g_{\\mu \\nu}~ ^{\\fbox{}}~ \\phi \\right]-\\frac{v(\\phi)}{2 \\phi } g_{\\mu \\nu}+\\frac{1}{\\phi}t_{\\mu \\nu}\\ ] ] and @xmath16\\ ] ]    where @xmath17 .",
