    "the galactic cosmic rays  the gas of relativistic charged particles with high energy density  can not always be treated as test particles moving in given magnetic fields . in particular , the stochastic acceleration of cosmic rays by mhd waves is accompanied by the damping of the waves , since the wave energy is dissipated .",
    "the rate of wave damping on cosmic rays through the cyclotron resonance interaction was first estimated by @xcite .",
    "if we exclude cold hi regions ( where the waves are damped by collisions of ions with neutral atoms ) and also perhaps regions of the interstellar gas with very high temperature @xmath1 k and weak magnetic field ( where landau damping on thermal particles is high ) , then one finds that this mechanism of dissipation could dominate over other known mechanisms in the interval of wavelengths @xmath2 cm to @xmath3 cm",
    ". the non - resonant interaction of diffusing cosmic rays with magnetosonic waves @xcite is important only at large wavelengths and is not important for the present investigation .",
    "we also do not consider the large body of instabilities in cosmic rays that may arise because of the non - equilibrium distribution of charged energetic particles caused by possible strong anisotropy or large gradients and which may amplify waves in the background plasma  see e.g.  @xcite and @xcite for a review of such processes .",
    "cyclotron wave damping on cosmic rays changes the wave spectrum in the interstellar medium , which in turn affects the particle transport since the cosmic ray diffusion coefficient is determined by the level of turbulence which scatters charged particles .",
    "thus in principle the study of cosmic ray diffusion requires a self - consistent approach .",
    "we shall see below that the effect of cosmic rays on interstellar turbulence should be taken into account at energies below a few gev / nucleon , and this may result in a considerable increase in the particle diffusion coefficient .",
    "this picture will be also verified by its consistency with observations of interstellar turbulence .",
    "consistency of this picture with observations of interstellar turbulence is also discussed    it is remarkable that the interpretation of cosmic ray data on secondary nuclei may require this effect .",

    "alternative explanations of the peaks in secondary to primary ratios without invoking peculiarities in the cosmic ray diffusion coefficient have been suggested .",
    "the two most popular of these involve diffusive - convective particle transport in the hypothetical galactic wind @xcite and the stochastic reacceleration of cosmic rays by interstellar turbulence @xcite .",
    "these processes are included in the numerical computations of cosmic ray transport in the galaxy in the frameworks of the galprop code @xcite .",
    "the situation with the interpretation of the energy dependence of secondaries in cosmic rays is still uncertain .",
    "the peaks in the secondary to primary nuclei ratios calculated in diffusion - convection models seem to be too wide .",
    "models with reacceleration reproduce the shape of the peaks but the absolute flux of antiprotons turns out to be too low compared to observations @xcite .",
    "this is why the effect considered in the present work is so important .",

    "here we note only that the streaming instability develops above the galactic disk at @xmath270@xmath271 cm@xmath4/s ( if the wave damping is absent ) and leads to the diffusive - convective transport of cosmic rays .",

    "the region of the cosmic ray halo is the most `` safe '' in this sense @xcite .",
    "in particular , dissipation on ion - neutral collisions may destroy mhd turbulence in the galactic disk but not in the halo where neutrals are absent .",

    "the cascades of alfven waves ( with the scaling @xmath287 ) and the fast magnetosonic waves ( @xmath288 ) are independent in the @xcite model of mhd turbulence , and the amplitude of alfven wave cascade may dominate at the principle scale .",
    "also , in the `` sandwich '' model described in a previous paragraph , the turbulence , which determines the confinement of cosmic rays in the galaxy , is distributed in the halo of size @xmath289 kpc whereas the observations of interstellar turbulence refer to the galactic disk and the adjacent region , where it can be much stronger .",
    "on the whole , the empirical diffusion model for cosmic rays with energies from @xmath122 to @xmath290 ev implies the presence of random magnetic field with an extended power law spectrum of fluctuations @xmath291 , @xmath292  at wave numbers from @xmath293 to @xmath294 @xmath8 .",
    "the existence of such a turbulence spectrum in the interstellar medium seems confirmed by various astronomical observations .",
    "it should be emphasized that this does not prove the existence of a spectral cascade or spectral transfer throughout this enormous wavenumber range , however tempting that conclusion may be . among other puzzles ,",
    "an oddity is the absence of a spectral feature on spatial scales where ion - neutral collisional processes should be most pronounced .",
    "the two special cases of turbulence spectrum with @xmath295 and @xmath296 which correspond to the kolmogorov and the kraichnan spectra respectively are used in popular versions of the diffusion model as described in section 5 . in both cases ,",
    "as the present work has demonstrated , one can get a satisfactory fit to the data on energy spectra of secondary and primary nuclei if account is taken for wave damping on cosmic rays for a slow kraichnan cascade .",
    "the fit can be obtained either in the dr model with reacceleration on the kolmogorov spectrum with no significant effect of cosmic ray damping ( because the kolmogorov cascade is fast ) or in the drd model with relatively weak reacceleration on the kraichnan spectrum which is significantly modified by cosmic ray damping .",
    "some problems still remain to be solved .",
    "the main difficulties with the kolmogorov spectrum are , firstly , the contradiction with the leading theory of mhd turbulence where this spectrum is associated with perpendicular propagating alfven waves which almost do not scatter cosmic - ray particles ; and secondly , the low flux of antiprotons characteristic of models with relatively strong reacceleration",
    ". a major problem of concern for diffusion on a kraichnan spectrum is the relatively strong dependence of diffusion on energy which leads to an unacceptably large anisotropy of cosmic rays especially above @xmath3 ev , see @xcite , @xcite .",
    "let us emphasize again that the models of cosmic ray propagation discussed in the present paper assume that the mhd turbulence required for cosmic - ray scattering is produced by some external sources .",
    "an alternative is the galactic wind model by @xcite and @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the cosmic - ray pressure drives a wind with a frozen - in regular magnetic field which is shaped into huge spirals ( the radius of the galactic wind cavity is about @xmath297 kpc ) .",
    "the mhd turbulence in the wind is created by the streaming instability of cosmic rays moving predominantly along the regular magnetic field lines outward from the galactic disk .",
    "the level of turbulence is regulated by the nonlinear landau damping on thermal ions .",
    "the model explains well the cosmic - ray data up to ultra - high energies @xmath26@xmath290 ev with the exception of the observed low anisotropy ( about the same difficulty with anisotropy as occurs in the diffusion model with a given kraichnan spectrum ) . as regards interpretation of cosmic - ray observations , a preference can not yet be given to any of the models of cosmic - ray transport in the galaxy discussed above .",
