    "thirty - five years after the beginning of the experimental search for cosmic gravitational waves ( gw ) , several resonant - mass detectors ( cryogenic cylindrical bars ) are currently monitoring the strongest potential sources in our galaxy and in the local group  @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of such detectors is @xmath1 6 @xmath2 10@xmath3 for millisecond gw bursts , or , in spectral units ,",
    "10@xmath4 hz@xmath5 over a bandwidth of a few hz around 1 khz .",
    "a further improvement in sensitivity and bandwidth is expected from the operation at ultralow temperatures of the two bar detectors _ nautilus _ @xcite and _ auriga _ @xcite in italy , and even better sensitivities and bandwidths will come about as more advanced readout systems are developed",
    ". projects for spherical resonant - mass gw detectors have emerged in the last few years in the resonant - mass community  @xcite , due to their remarkable advantages with respect to the operating bars  @xcite .    in a cylindrical bar",
    "only the first longitudinal mode of vibration interacts strongly with the gw , and consequently only _ one _ wave parameter can be measured : the amplitude of a combination of the two polarization states . on the other hand",
    "each quadrupole mode of a spherical mass is five - fold degenerate ( its angular dependence is described in terms of the five spherical harmonics @xmath6(@xmath7,@xmath8 ) with @xmath9=2 and @xmath10=@xmath112, ... ,2 ) , and presents an _ isotropic _ cross section .",
    "the cross section of the lowest order ( @xmath12=1 ) mode is the highest , and is larger than that of a cylindrical antenna made of the same material and with the same resonant frequency by a factor of about @xmath13 @xcite , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the radius of the sphere and of the bar , respectively .",
    "this means a factor of 20 over present bars .",
    "moreover , the sphere s cross section is also high at its second quadrupole harmonic .",
    "the five - fold degeneracy of the quadrupole modes enables the determination of the gw amplitudes of two polarization states and the two angles of the source direction .",
    "the method first outlined by forward  @xcite and later developed by wagoner and paik  @xcite , consists in measuring the sphere vibrations in at least five independent locations on the sphere surface so as to determine the vibration amplitude of each of the five degenerate modes .",
    "the fourier components of the gw amplitudes at any quadrupole frequencies and the two angles defining the source direction can be obtained as suitable combinations of these five outputs  @xcite .",
    "the signal deconvolution is based on the assumption that in the wave frame ( that in which the @xmath16 axis is aligned with the wave propagation direction ) only the @xmath9=2 and @xmath17=@xmath182 modes are excited by the gw , as the helicity of a gw is 2 in general relativity .",
    "one can take advantage of this to deconvolve the wave propagation direction and the gw amplitudes in the wave frame .",
    "most of the nice properties of a spherical gw detector depend on its being _ spherically symmetric_. a spherical shell , or _ hollow sphere _ , obviously maintains that symmetry , so it can be considered an interesting alternative to the usual _ solid _ sphere . in order to have a good cross section ,",
    "a resonant gw detector must be made of a high speed of sound material , and have a large mass .",
    "the actual construction of a massive spherical body may be technically difficult .",
    "in fact , fabricating a large hollow sphere is a different task than fabricating a solid one .",
    "casting a hollow half sphere is a nearly two dimensional cast , at odds with casting a solid sphere , which requires rather special moulds . as an example of the feasibility of large two dimensional casting we can mention the fabrication of propellers of more than 10 meters in size and masses of the order of 100 tons  @xcite .",
    "two hollow hemispheres could then be welded together with electron beam techniques . however , while it is known that these welding technique preserve most of the properties of the bare material , its effect on the acoustic quality factor ( a relevant paramenter in resonant mass detectors ) must be further studied .",
    "we have investigated the properties of a hollow sphere as a potential gw antenna .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present a detailed report of the main results of such an investigation , and to discuss the real interest of this new detector shape .    in section 2",
    "we present the complete analytical solution of the eigenmode problem for a hollow sphere of arbitrary thickness , including the full frequency and amplitude spectrum .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the cross section analysis , while in section 4 we take up the study of the system sensitivity to various gw signal classes .",
    "finally , we present an outlook and summary of conclusions in section 5 .",
    "in this section we consider the problem of a hollow elastic sphere in order to obtain its normal modes and frequency spectrum . this is a classical problem in elasticity theory which was posed and partly addressed already in the last century , see e.g. @xcite and references therein .",
    "let @xmath19 and @xmath20 be the outer and inner radius of the sphere , respectively .",
    "the elastic properties of the sphere , provided it is homogenous and isotropic , will be described by its lam coefficients , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , and its density , @xmath23 . as is well known ( see ,",
    "e.g. , @xcite ) , the normal modes are obtained as the solutions to the eigenvalue equation    @xmath24    subject to the boundary conditions that the solid s surface be free of any tensions and/or tractions ; these are expressed by the equations    @xmath25    where the sphere s surface @xmath26 has outward normal @xmath27 .",
    "the possibility of a spherical shell ( @xmath28 ) , and that of a solid sphere ( @xmath29 ) , are allowed .",
    "the stress tensor @xmath30 is given by @xcite    @xmath31    the general solution to ( [ eigenv ] ) can be cast in the form    @xmath32    where @xmath33 , @xmath34 are constants , @xmath35 , and the scalar functions @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 are given by    @xmath40    where @xmath41 , and @xmath42 denotes a spherical harmonic . finally , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the standard bessel functions of the first and second kind , respectively ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . the latter ( which are singular at the origin )",
    "must be included in our case , as @xmath45 lies outside the boundary @xmath26 .",
    "the boundary conditions ( [ bc ] ) become , after rather lengthy calculations , a system of linear equations which splits up into a @xmath46 linear system for @xmath47 , and a @xmath48 system for @xmath49 .",
    "that is , we have a linear system of the form :    @xmath50    with    @xmath51    where the superscript @xmath52 denotes transpostion , and the corresponding matrices are : @xmath53    and    @xmath54    here @xmath55 , and we have introduced the set of functions :    @xmath56    while the tilded ones are their singular counterparts , with @xmath57 instead of @xmath58 ( i.e. , @xmath59 , and so on ) .",
    "the matrices @xmath60 and @xmath61 are functions of @xmath62 , and depend on the parameter @xmath63 , and , in the case of @xmath60 , also on @xmath64 . ; for the usual value @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 . these values are assumed , unless otherwise stated . ]",
    "the _ discrete _ set of @xmath68 values that make compatible the system ( [ lsys ] ) constitute the _ spectrum _ of the elastic sphere .",
    "we can distinguish two families of normal modes :    \\(i ) _ toroidal modes_. these are characterized by    @xmath69    hence they are purely tangential , and their frequencies depend only on the ratio @xmath70",
    ". their amplitudes are    @xmath71    with    @xmath72    where @xmath73 is fixed by the chosen normalization .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalues are obtained as solutions to the trascendental equation ( [ modet ] ) . for the degenerate limit @xmath28",
    "the equation to be solved is    @xmath74    with the prime denoting differentation respect to the argument . using standard properties of bessel functions @xcite",
    ", it can be easily shown that    @xmath75,\\ ] ] and , in this case , there is only _",
    "one _ eigenvalue for each @xmath76 , given by the only root of the above equation , @xmath77   do _ not _ depend on the elastic properties of the material . ] .",
    "figure [ 1 ] displays @xmath78 as a function of @xmath63 for the first few toroidal modes .",
    "the existence of just one mode for each @xmath76 in the thin shell limit shows as a divergence of @xmath78 when @xmath70 approaches 1 and @xmath79 . in figure",
    "[ 2 ] we plot the normalized toroidal amplitudes @xmath80 for two quadrupolar modes and three different values of the parameter @xmath70 .",
    "we observe that their absolute values at the outer surface show little dependence on the ratio @xmath70 .",
    "\\(ii ) _ spheroidal modes_. this second family is charaterized by :    @xmath81    in this case , the expressions get more involved , as we have to handle a @xmath46 determinant .",
    "once the spectrum @xmath82 is found for given @xmath70 and @xmath83 , the system ( [ lsys ] ) can be solved for @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 .",
    "if we label these coefficients @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , the eigenmodes can be written as    @xmath90    with    @xmath91 , \\label{n}\\\\   e _ { nl}(r)&= & c_o(n , l)\\frac{1}{q_{nl}r}\\left [ j_l(q_{nl}r)-    p_o(n , l)\\{k_{nl}r\\,j_l(k_{nl}r)\\}'+ \\right . \\nonumber\\\\    & & \\left . p_1(n , l)y_l(q_{nl}r)-    p_2(n , l)\\{k_{nl}r\\,y_l(k_{nl}r)\\}'\\right ] , \\label{e}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath92 is , again , free up to normalization .",
    "the spectrum for the degenerate case @xmath28 is given by the solutions to    @xmath93    which happens to have _ two _ solutions for each value of @xmath9 when @xmath76 and only _ one _ root for @xmath94   is simpler , because the eigenvalue equation ( protect[shell ] ) becomes @xmath95 and has only one solution , namely @xmath96 .",
    "unlike toroidal eigenvalues , spheroidal ones do depend on @xmath97 . ] .",
    "plotting @xmath78 as a function of @xmath70 , we see that the third and higher roots diverge as the inner radius approaches @xmath19 , see figures [ 3 ] and [ 4 ] .",
    "figures [ 5][7 ] show the normalized radial functions for a few spheroidal modes and values of @xmath70 . as in the toroidal case ,",
    "their values at @xmath98 ( where measurements using transducers are to be made eventually ) are nearly independent of @xmath70 .",
    "a convenient way to characterise a resonant detector sensitivity is through its gw energy absorption cross section , defined as    @xmath99    where @xmath100 is the energy absorbed by the detector at frequency @xmath101 , and @xmath102 is the incident flux density expressed e.g. in watt / m@xmath103hz .",
    "estimation of @xmath104 requires a hypothesis about the underlying gravitation theory to calculate @xmath102 , and specification of the antenna s geometry to calculate @xmath100 .",
    "here we shall assume that general relativity is the correct gravitation theory , and proceed to calculate the oscillation energy of the solid as a consequence of its excitation by an incoming gw , which we shall naturally identify with @xmath100 .",
    "we briefly sketch the details of the process now .    as shown in @xcite , an elastic solid s response to a gw force",
    "can be expressed by a very general formula , which is easily particularised to a spherically symmetric body such as the _ solid _ sphere _ or _",
    "the _ hollow _ sphere . in both cases , as we have just seen , the vibration eigenmodes belong into two families ( spheroidal and toroidal ) , but gws only couple to _ quadrupole spheroidal harmonics_. if the frequencies of these modes are noted by @xmath105 ( @xmath12=1 for the lowest value , @xmath12=2 for the next , etc . ) and the corresponding wavefunctions by @xmath106 then the elastic displacements are given by    @xmath107     \\label{3.16}\\ ] ]    where    @xmath108    and @xmath109 are the quadrupole components of the riemann tensor , while @xmath110 is an _ overlapping integral factor _ of the gw s tidal coefficient over the solid s extension . much like in the case of a solid sphere , it has dimensions of length , and is given by a definite integral of the radial terms in the wavefunction @xmath106 ; more specifically ,    @xmath111\\,dr =    -\\frac{c_o(n,2)}{4\\pi\\,q_{n2}r}[g_2(r)-g_2(a)],\\ ] ]    where we have introduced the dimensionless function    @xmath112\\ ] ]    and assumed the following normalization for the wavefunctions :    @xmath113 = m\\ ] ]    the calculation of @xmath100 can now be pursued along the lines set up in reference @xcite : the fourier transform @xmath114 of the response function @xmath115 of equation ( [ 3.16 ] ) is calculated , whereby the _ spectral energy density _ can be obtained as    @xmath116    where @xmath117 is the _ integration time _ of the signal in the detector .",
    "the energy deposited by the gw in the @xmath12-th quadrupole mode is hence calculated by integration of this spectral density over the linewidth of the mode .",
    "it is readily found that    @xmath118    where @xmath119 is the fourier transform of @xmath109 .    the gw flux in the denominator of ( [ 100 ] )",
    "is ( clearly ) proportional to the sum in the rhs of ( [ 4.10b ] ) , the proportionality factor being in turn proportional to @xmath120 see @xcite for a detailed discussion , so we finally obtain    @xmath121    where @xmath122=@xmath123 , @xmath124 is the detector s mass , and @xmath125 is newton s constant .",
    "this equation allows relatively easy numerical evaluation of the cross sections , as well defined computer programmes can be written for the purpose .    as we have seen in section 2 above",
    ", the eigenvalues and wavefunctions of a hollow sphere only depend on the ratio @xmath63 , and therefore so does the quantity @xmath126 in ( [ sigma ] ) .",
    "so the cross section @xmath127 only depends on that ratio , too , once a suitable unit of _ mass _ is adopted for reference . in figures [ 8 ] and [ 8a ]",
    "we plot @xmath128 for the first two quadrupole modes of the hollow sphere in two different circumstances : in figure [ 8 ] we assume a hollow sphere of _ fixed _ outer radius thus its mass decreases with thickness , and in figure [ 8a ] we have instead assumed that the mass of the hollow sphere is _ fixed _ , so that its geometrical size increases as it gets thinner . in either case",
    "we see that , for the higher mode , the maximum cross section does not happen at @xmath20=0 , but at some intermediate inner radius : for @xmath129 , the cross - section for the second quadrupole mode equals that of the first , and we have the possibility of working with a detector _ with the same ( high ) sensitivity at two frequencies . _",
    "we assume that the mechanical oscillations induced in a resonant mass by the interaction with the gw are transformed into electrical signals by a set of identical noiseless transducers ( for the sake of simplicity , we consider here non - resonant transducers ) , perfectly matched to electronic amplifiers with noise temperature @xmath130 .",
    "unavoidably , brownian motion noise associated with dissipation in the antenna and electronic noise from the amplifiers limit the sensitivity of the detector .",
    "we refer the reader to  @xcite for a complete discussion on the sensitivity of resonant - mass detectors and report here only a few basic formulas for the evaluation of the detector sensitivity to various signals .",
    "the total noise at the output of each resonant mode can be seen as due to an input noise generator having spectral density of strain @xmath131 , acting on a noiseless oscillator .",
    "@xmath132 represents the input gw spectrum that would produce a signal equal to the noise spectrum actually observed at the output of the detector instrumentation . in a resonant - mass detector , this function is a resonant curve and can be characterized by its value at resonance @xmath133 and by its half height width .",
    "@xmath133 can be written as :    @xmath134    here @xmath135 is the thermodynamic temperature of the detector plus a back - action contribution from the amplifiers , and @xmath136 is the quality factor of the mode .",
    "the half height width of @xmath132 gives the bandwidth of the resonant mode :    @xmath137    here , @xmath138 is the ratio of the wideband noise in the @xmath12-th resonance bandwidth to the narrowband noise ,    @xmath139    where @xmath140 is the transducer coupling factor , defined as the fraction of the total mode energy available at the transducer output .    in practice @xmath138@xmath1411 and",
    "the bandwidth is much larger than the pure resonance linewidth @xmath142 . in the limit @xmath143",
    ", the bandwidth becomes infinite .",
    "the bandwidth of the present resonant bars is of the order of a few hz  @xcite .",
    "if a quantum limited readout system were available , values of the order of 100 hz could be reached  @xcite .",
    "the equations ( [ esseacca ] and [ deltaeffe ] ) can be used to characterize the sensitivity of the quadrupole modes of a hollow spherical resonant - mass detector .",
    "the optimum performance is obtained by filtering the output with a filter matched to the signal .",
    "the energy signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath144 ) of the filter output is given by the well - known formula    @xmath145    where @xmath146 is the fourier transform of @xmath147 .",
    "we now report the _ snr _ of a hollow spherical detector for various gw signals . to be specific",
    ", we shall assume that the thermodynamic temperature of the detector can be reduced to below 50 mk , and that the quality factors of the modes are of the order of 10@xmath148 , so that the overall detector noise will be dominated by the electronic amplifier noise .",
    "if we express the energy of the latter as a multiple of the _ quantum limit _",
    ", i.e. , @xmath149=@xmath150 then the strain spectral density becomes    @xmath151    in these conditions the fractional bandwidth @xmath152 becomes of the order of @xmath140 that we assume of about 0.1 .",
    "we shall consider hollow spheres made of the usual aluminium alloy al5056 and of a recently investigated copper alloy ( cual ) @xcite .",
    "table [ t1 ] displays numerical values of the most relevant parameters for a few example detectors with a noise level equal to the quantum limit , i.e. @xmath153=1 .    1.0 cm    .main features and sensitivities for several hypothetical hollow spheres of two different materials .",
    "[ t1 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      we consider here the interaction of the hollow spherical detector with the waveform emitted by a binary system , consisting of either neutron stars or black holes , in the inspiral phase .",
    "the system , in the newtonian regime , has a clean analytic behaviour , and emits a waveform of increasing amplitude and frequency that can sweep up to the khz range of frequency .    from the resonant - mass detector viewpoint ,",
    "the chirp signal can be treated as a transient gw , depositing energy in a time - scale short with respect to the detector damping time @xcite .",
    "we can then use ( [ ev6 ] ) to evaluate the _ snr _ , where the fourier transform @xmath154 at the resonant frequency @xmath155 can be explicitly written as    @xmath156 ^ 2 +          \\left[\\int h(t)\\sin(2\\pi f_n t)\\,dt\\right]^2\\right\\}^{1/2 } \\label{ev9}\\ ] ]    with @xmath147 indicating @xmath157 or @xmath158 . substituting into ( [ ev9 ] ) the well - known chirp waveforms for an optimally oriented orbit of zero eccentricity in the newtonian approximation  @xcite ,",
    "the _ snr _ for chirp detection is  @xcite :    @xmath159    @xmath160 is the chirp mass defined as @xmath161 , where @xmath162 and @xmath163 are the masses of the two compact objects and @xmath164 is the distance to the source .",
    "the chirp mass is the only parameter that determines the frequency sweep rate of the chirp signal in the newtonian approximation , and can be determined by a _",
    "double passage _",
    "technique @xcite : much like in a solid sphere detector , one can measure the time delay @xmath165 between excitations of the first and second quadrupole modes on a hollow spherical detector to calculate the chirp mass through equation    @xmath166    where @xmath167 and @xmath168 are the angular frequencies of the first and second quadrupole modes , respectively .",
    "time delays are of the order of a fraction of a second for the hollow spheres considered in this paper , well within the timing possibilities of resonant mass detectors @xcite    another consequence of the multimode and multifrequency nature of a spherically symmetric detector is the possibility to determine the orbit orientation by the measurement of the relative proportion of the two polarisation amplitudes , and thereby the distance to the source and the intrinsic gw amplitudes  @xcite .",

    "the highest chirp mass values reported in the figures are determined by the requirement that the five  cycle  frequency of the source be larger than the resonant frequencies of the detector .      in this case",
    "@xmath147 is a random function and we assume that its power spectrum , indicated by @xmath169 , is flat and its energy density per unit logarithmic frequency is a fraction @xmath170 of the closure density @xmath171 of the universe :    @xmath172    @xmath169 is given by    @xmath173    the measured noise spectrum @xmath132 of a single resonant - mass detector automatically gives an upper limit to @xmath169 ( and hence to @xmath170 ) .",

    "in particular , following recent estimations based on cosmological string models  @xcite , it emerges that experimental measurements performed at the level of sensitivity attainable with these detectors would be true tests of planck - scale physics .",
    "( [ ev11 ] ) and ( [ ev12 ] ) hold for whichever cross - correlation experiment between two gw detectors adjacent and aligned for optimum correlation .",
    "an interesting consequence is that the sensitivity of a hollow sphere - interferometer observatory will be unprecedented",
    ". it can be worth to build a hollow spherical mass detector close to a large interferometer , like ligo or virgo , to perform stochastic searches  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have been mainly concerned with the problem of how an elastic _ hollow _ sphere responds to a gw signal impinging on it . to address this problem",
    "we have developed an analytical procedure to fully sort out the eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes of that kind of solid , then applied it to calculate the gw _ absorption cross section _ for arbitrary thicknesses and materials of our solid .",
    "when realistic hypotheses are made regarding the size and material of a possible gw detector of this shape , we have seen that a hollow sphere can be advantageous in several respects .",
    "it has all the features associated with its symmetry , such as omnidirectionality and capability to determine the source direction and wave polarisation .",
    "also , its quadrupole frequencies are below those of an equally massive solid sphere , thus making the low frequency range accessible to this antenna with good sensitivity .",
    "we have investigated the system response to the classical gw signal sources ( bursts , chirps , continuous and stochastic ) for several sizes and materials , and seen that interesting signal - to - noise ratios are attainable with such a detector .",
    "also , its bandwidth partly overlaps with that of the projected large interferometers @xcite , so potentially both kinds of detectors can be operated simultaneously to make _ hybrid _ gw observatories of unprecedented sensitivity and signal characterisation power .    while it seems possible to cool a 100 ton solid sphere down to 50 mk @xcite , the possibility of cooling a large hollow sphere at such low temperatures , as well as the fabrication technique and the influence of cosmic rays on a low - temperature gw detector of that shape and dimensions , are currently under investigation ."
