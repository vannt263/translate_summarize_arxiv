    "this manifests in an enhancement of the free electron density of the d - region by several orders of magnitude than the normal value .",

    "we investigated a total of @xmath49 flares .",
    "as the @xmath1 has been found to depend on the strength of flares , we chose only the c - class flares .",
    "we observe that the average zenith angle ( z ) over the path during flare occurrence has a linear correlation with @xmath39 t .",
    "we compute this correlation quantitatively .",
    "ours is an alternative method to estimate the relation between @xmath16-profile of d - region and @xmath5 , because @xmath39 t is directly connected to @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "similar correlations of time delay with z can be tested for the m - class or x - class flares but since their numbers are much lower , for a good statistics , we need to collect the data for a longer period .",
    "now in the later part for deeper analysis , we chose 78 flares of c , m and x - classes which occurred at different diurnal times .",
    "we grouped them into six separate equal sized time bins ( @xmath6 ) according to their occurrence times . for each bin",
    ", we fitted @xmath1 versus peak flare flux ( @xmath7 ) of respective flares with an empirically chosen exponentially decaying function and calculated @xmath8-@xmath9 to estimate the goodness of fit . finally , we compute the average and standard deviation ( @xmath50 ) of the solar zenith angle @xmath5 ( averaged over the @xmath10-@xmath11 propagation path ) for each @xmath6 , and the @xmath8-@xmath9 varies exactly in the same way as the standard deviation ( @xmath50 ) of zenith angle ( @xmath5 ) distributed over @xmath10-@xmath11 path within each time bin @xmath6 .",

    "<S> excess solar x - ray radiation during solar flares causes an enhancement of ionization in the ionospheric d - region and hence affects sub - ionospherically propagating vlf signal amplitude and phase . </S>",
    "<S> vlf signal amplitude perturbation ( @xmath0 ) and amplitude time delay ( @xmath1 ) ( vis -  - vis corresponding x - ray light curve as measured by goes-15 ) of nwc/19.8 khz signal have been computed for solar flares which is detected by us during jan - sep 2011 . </S>",
    "<S> the signal is recorded by softpal facility of ierc / icsp , sitapur ( 22@xmath2 27@xmath3n , 87@xmath2 45@xmath3e ) , west bengal , india . in first part of the work , using the well known lwpc technique , we simulated the flare induced excess lower ionospheric electron density by amplitude perturbation method . </S>",
    "<S> unperturbed d - region electron density is also obtained from simulation and compared with iri - model results . using these simulation results and time delay as key parameters , we calculate the effective electron recombination coefficient ( @xmath4 ) at solar flare peak region . </S>",
    "<S> our results match with the same obtained by other established models . in the second part , we dealt with the solar zenith angle effect on d - region during flares . </S>",
    "<S> we relate this vlf data with the solar x - ray data . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the peak of the vlf amplitude occurs later than the time of the x - ray peak for each flare . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate this so - called time delay ( @xmath1 ) . for the c - class flares we find that there is a direct correspondence between @xmath1 of a solar flare and the average solar zenith angle @xmath5 over the signal propagation path at flare occurrence time . </S>",
    "<S> now for deeper analysis , we compute the @xmath1 for different local diurnal time slots @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that while the time delay is anti - correlated with the flare peak energy flux @xmath7 independent of these time slots , the goodness of fit , as measured by @xmath8-@xmath9 , actually worsens as the day progresses . </S>",
    "<S> the variation of the @xmath5 dependence of @xmath8-@xmath9 seems to follow the variation of standard deviation of @xmath5 along the @xmath10-@xmath11 propagation path . in other words , for the flares having almost constant @xmath5 over the path a tighter anti - correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath7 was observed . </S>"
