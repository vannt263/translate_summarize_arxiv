    "if a normal metal ( @xmath2 ) is in good electrical contact with a superconductor ( @xmath3 ) , cooper pairs can leak from @xmath3 to @xmath2 , modifying the properties of the metal .",
    "this phenomenon , known as _ proximity effect _ , was intensively studied in the 1960 s @xcite and there has been a renewed interest in the last two decades due to the possibility to study this effect at much smaller length and energy scales @xcite . when a cooper pair penetrates into a normal metal , via an andreev reflection @xcite , it becomes a pair of time - reversed electron states that propagate coherently over a distance @xmath4 , which in diffusive metals is given by @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the diffusion constant , @xmath7 is the energy of the electron states ( with respect to the fermi energy ) , and @xmath8 is the phase - coherence length in @xmath2 .",
    "this cooper pair leakage modifies the local density of states ( dos ) of the normal metal over a distance @xmath4 from the @xmath3-@xmath2 interface .",
    "such a modification has been spatially resolved in recent years with the help of tunneling probes @xcite and with scanning tunneling microscopy / spectroscopy ( stm / sts ) techniques applied to mesoscopic systems @xcite .",
    "very recently , the considerable progress in the controlled growth of atomically clean materials under ultrahigh vacuum conditions has made it possible to probe the proximity effect with high spatial and energy resolution in _ in situ _",
    "stm / sts experiments @xcite .",
    "the proximity effect is not exclusive of @xmath3-@xmath2 systems .",
    "if a superconductor @xmath9 , with a critical temperature @xmath10 and energy gap @xmath11 , is brought into contact with another superconductor @xmath12 with a lower critical temperature @xmath13 and energy gap @xmath14 , the local dos of both superconductors near the interface is expected to be modified . at low enough temperature @xmath15",
    "this modification should be significant in the energy interval @xmath16 $ ] and may occur in each electrode over a distance @xmath17 from the interface .",
    "moreover , in the temperature range @xmath18 one expects the proximity effect to induce a finite local order parameter in a formally non - superconducting @xmath12 , owing to a non - zero attractive pairing interaction @xmath19 existing in @xmath12 .",
    "such a mechanism should result in a proximity - induced interface superconductivity .",
    "these remarkable effects were first discussed qualitatively by de gennes and co - workers in the 1960 s @xcite , but to the best of our knowledge no experiment has ever been reported in which this peculiar @xmath9-@xmath12 proximity effect could be spatially resolved .    in this work we present a stm / sts study of the proximity effect in a lateral @xmath9-@xmath12 junction with a very high spatial and energy resolution , for temperatures well below and above @xmath20 .",
    "the junction was elaborated _ in situ _ in ultrahigh vacuum on si(111 ) .",
    "the @xmath9 electrode is formed by a single nanocrystal of pb ( @xmath21  k , @xmath22  mev ) .",
    "@xmath12 consists of a single atomic layer of pb reconstructed on si(111 ) to form the so - called striped incommensurate phase , a superconductor with @xmath23  k and @xmath24  mev . for temperatures well below @xmath20",
    "we observe a pronounced modification of the local tunneling conductance spectra in @xmath12 over a distance @xmath25  nm from the @xmath9-@xmath12 interface . above @xmath20 but below @xmath10 , the tunneling spectra in @xmath12 exhibit an induced gap which extends to distances anomalously large for a normal metal .",
    "our experimental observations are explained with the help of an one - dimensional model based on the usadel equations , where the order parameter is evaluated self - consistently .",
    "importantly , our combined experimental and theoretical study furnishes strong evidence that the long - range proximity effect observed in @xmath12 above @xmath20 is a direct consequence of the appearance of proximity - induced interface superconductivity in the atomic monolayer .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec - ii ] describes the fabrication of the atomic - scale controlled junctions between two different superconductors and present the results for the tunneling spectra in the low temperature regime where both electrodes are in the superconducting state .",
    "section [ sec - iii ] is devoted to the discussion of the theoretical model based on the usadel theory that is used to describe all our experimental results .",
    "we present and discuss in section [ sec - iv ] the results for the tunneling spectra in the temperature regime where the pb monolayer is in its normal state .",
    "then , we briefly discuss the inverse proximity effect in the pb islands and summarize our main conclusions in section [ sec - v ] .",
    "the fabrication of a @xmath9-@xmath12 junction was carried out _ in situ _ as we proceed to explain .",

    "subsequently , 1.65 monolayer of pb was evaporated on the si(111)-@xmath28 kept at room temperature , using an electron beam evaporator calibrated with a quartz micro - balance .",
    "the @xmath29 reconstructed pb monolayer was formed by annealing at 230@xmath27c for 30 minutes @xcite .",
    "the slightly denser striped incommensurate phase was then formed by adding 0.2 monolayer ( ml ) of pb onto the @xmath30-pb / si(111 ) held at room temperature @xcite .",
    "this resulted in a slight extra amount of lead atoms ( 0.07  ml ) with respect to the nominal reported coverage of the striped incommensurate phase ( 1.33  ml ) .    , surrounded by the striped incommensurate ( sic ) pb monolayer , denoted as @xmath12 .",
    "small pb clusters of few nanometers size and 1  ml height are visible on the sic monolayer .",

    "[ topo_proxy](b ) , the atomic superstructure of the sic was observed everywhere on the surface between the overlying pb islands or clusters . at each step , the sample structure was controlled in both real and reciprocal space by stm and low energy electron diffraction .",

    "[ fig_exp_lowt](d ) .",
    "the main spectral features are the following [ see labels in fig .",

    "this is the goal of the next section .",
    "most theoretical studies of the proximity effect in @xmath9-@xmath12 systems have focused on the analysis of their critical temperature .",
    "these studies have made use either of the ginzburg - landau theory or of the linearized gorkov s equations @xcite , which are only valid close to critical temperature of the whole system @xcite . here",
    ", in order to describe the local spectra at arbitrary temperatures we used the usadel approach @xcite .",
    "usadel equations summarize the quasiclassical theory of superconductivity in the diffusive limit , where the mean free path is smaller than the superconducting coherence length . in the monolayer @xmath12 , this length is given by @xmath46 .",

    "these two latter parameters are eliminated in favor of the critical temperature of the monolayer ( in the absence of proximity effect ) in the usual manner . moreover , in our case , with no phase difference between the superconducting reservoirs , the order parameter can be chosen real , as we have done implicitly in eq .",
    "( [ eq - deltasc ] ) .    to solve the usadel equations in practice",
    ", we modeled our lateral @xmath9-@xmath12 system by a one - dimensional ( 1d ) junction . due to the big thickness difference between @xmath9 and @xmath12 , we consider @xmath9 as an ideal reservoir in which the order parameter @xmath59 remains constant and unperturbed up to the interface ( the observed tiny deviations due to the inverse proximity effect in @xmath9 are discussed below ) .",
    "@xmath12 is approximated as a semi - infinite wire with a constant attractive pairing interaction @xmath60 that corresponds to a critical temperature @xmath20 .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we solved the 1d usadel equations using the ricatti parametrization @xcite and described the junction interface with nazarov s boundary conditions , valid for arbitrary transparency @xcite .",
    "a key parameter in these boundary conditions is an effective reflectivity coefficient , @xmath61 , roughly defined as the ratio between the resistances of the @xmath9-@xmath12 barrier and of the monolayer .",
    "further technical details can be found in appendix a. within our 1d model we compute the local dos @xmath62 as a function of the distance to the interface , @xmath42 , as @xmath63 , while the corresponding normalized tunneling spectrum is given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the fermi function .",
    "let us now use this model to describe the low temperature results described in the previous section . for this purpose , we first fixed the bulk gaps in @xmath9 and @xmath12 by performing bcs fits of their local tunneling spectra acquired far away from @xmath9-@xmath12 interface .",
    "the best fits were obtained for @xmath66  mev and @xmath67  mev , with an effective electron temperature of 0.55  k slightly higher than the base temperature of our stm ( see appendix b ) .",

    "we obtained @xmath71  @xmath72/s , which corresponds to a coherence length of @xmath73  nm , in nice agreement with the @xmath74 value extracted from the analysis of the vortex core profile in the striped incomensurate phase @xcite .",
    "moreover , the value of @xmath75 suggests that the mean free path is rather small ( around 1 nm ) and therefore , it is much smaller than @xmath74 , which justifies the use of the usadel approach .",
    "[ fig_exp_lowt](f ) shows that the theory captures the decay length of @xmath76 along with the observed jump at the island edge .",
    "in the same panel we also show the self - consistent order parameter @xmath77 in the pb monolayer : it exhibits a jump at the island edge and decays gradually to the @xmath12 bulk value within 80 - 100  nm .",
    "if the order parameter is not accounted for self - consistently , the calculated spatial dependence @xmath76 does not follow the experimental data , see dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig_exp_lowt](f ) .",
    "this result emphasizes the need for a fully self - consistent calculation , which in any case is required based on fundamental principles . in fig .",
    "[ fig_exp_lowt](e ) we show the @xmath41 spectra obtained from the solution of the usadel equations with the parameter values determined above .",
    "as one can see , the theory reproduces all the salient features of the experimental results of fig .",
    "[ fig_exp_lowt](c , d ) .",
    "let us now present and discuss the results for temperatures above the critical temperature of the monolayer . at @xmath78  k , when @xmath12 is already in the normal state , the tunneling spectra change markedly , see fig .",
    "[ fig_exp_hight](a , b ) .",
    "now , the spectra in the pb monolayer close to the interface exhibit a smooth induced gap which gradually disappears over a distance of @xmath45  nm away from the island edge . the overall evolution of the spectra resembles that recently reported by us in a @xmath3-@xmath2 system , in which an amorphous pb wetting layer played the role of a 2d disordered normal metal @xcite . however , there are two important differences with respect to the present case : ( i ) here the altshuler - aronov reduction of the low - bias tunneling density of states , characteristic of electronic correlations , is absent and ( ii ) the crystalline monolayer is superconducting at lower temperature while the disordered pb wetting layer is not .",

    "[ fig_exp_hight](c ) with no adjustable parameters . more importantly , as we show in fig .",
    "[ fig_exp_hight](f ) , the pb monolayer develops locally in the vicinity of the interface a finite order parameter which survives over a distance of more than 100  nm",
    ". the impact of this proximity - induced order parameter can be appreciated by comparing these results with a non - self - consistent calculation where the order parameter is assumed to vanish at this temperature , which would correspond to the situation where @xmath12 is a non - superconducting metal .",
    "such a calculation shows that the induced gap extends over a much shorter distance inside the pb monolayer as compared to the experimental dependence , see also appendix c. this fact is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_exp_hight](f ) where we show that the experimental data for @xmath76 are fitted much more satisfactorily by the self - consistent calculation .",
    "thus , our results provide a clear evidence for the existence of the proximity - induced superconductivity in the interface region .",
    "this phenomenon was already discussed theoretically by de gennes and co - workers in the early 1960 s @xcite , but to our knowledge no direct observation has ever been reported .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the existence of this long - range or giant proximity effect has been suggested in the context of high - temperature superconductors based on the analysis of the supercurrent in trilayer josephson junctions @xcite .    for completeness",
    ", we studied theoretically the proximity - induced interface superconductivity in a more systematic manner . for this purpose ,",
    "we computed the induced order parameter in @xmath12 for different temperatures , see fig .  [ op - vs - t ] . for temperatures below @xmath20",
    ", the order parameter tends to a finite value far away from the island , while for higher temperatures it asymptotically vanishes .",
    "notice that right above @xmath20 , see light green curve in fig .",
    "[ op - vs - t ] , the induced order parameter can extend inside the monolayer several hundreds of nanometers .",
    "a detailed analysis of our numerical results in this temperature regime shows that away from the interface the induced order parameter decays exponentially as @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is a temperature - dependent decay length . as we illustrate in the inset of fig .",
    "[ op - vs - t ] , this decay length diverges when @xmath20 is approached from above approximately as @xmath81 , which agrees with the prediction made with the help of the linearized gorkov equations @xcite .",
    "it is worth stressing that at distances @xmath82 , the induced order parameter does not follow this simple exponential decay .",
    "on the other hand , notice also that when the temperature approaches @xmath10 , both the island s order parameter and the induced one in the monolayer vanish altogether .",
    "thus , our analysis shows that the proximity effect in @xmath9-@xmath12 junctions is much richer than in the @xmath3-@xmath2 case recently considered in ref .",

    "the different parameters are those of fig .",

    "the inset shows the temperature dependence of the decay length @xmath80 of the induced order parameter for temperatures above @xmath20 ( see text for definition ) .",
    "the symbols correspond to the values extracted from the curves shown in the main panel , while the red solid line is a numerical fit of those results to a function @xmath81 . ]",
    "it is worth stressing that we also observed the so - called inverse proximity effect in the pb island , see fig .",
    "[ fig_ipe ] , which we ignored for simplicity in our calculations . indeed ,",
    "although the pb island is much closer to be an electron reservoir than the atomically thin pb monolayer , the electron density ratio between @xmath9 and @xmath12 is not infinite , and the superconductivity in @xmath9 is also affected near the interface by a contact to a weaker superconductor @xmath12 .",
    "nevertheless the spectroscopic effects produced in @xmath9 are weak due to the large difference in electron densities of the two systems , and require a four - decades log scale to be clearly visible .",
    "[ fig_ipe ] allows us to see two important features of the inverse proximity effect : ( i ) following the coherence peak heights represented by the violet - light pink bands ( normalized conductance values above 1 ) , one sees that the peak height slightly increases away from the @xmath9-@xmath12 interface while the energy of the peak maximum also slightly increases toward higher energy .",
    "( ii ) focusing now on the behavior of the low conductance values in the green - orange - brown region ( @xmath84-few @xmath85 ) , a tail of induced sub - gap states appears in the excitation spectrum of @xmath9 in the energy window @xmath86 $ ] .",
    "this tail of induced states enables to connect by the edges the large gap of @xmath9 to the small gap of @xmath12 . in principle",

    "we have probed the local dos of such a hybrid system with an unprecedented energy and space resolution .",
    "the observed proximity - induced modification of the tunneling spectra in the pb monolayer @xmath12 was rationalized with the help of a 1d model based on the self - consistent solution of the usadel equations .",

    "the lower left panel corresponds to a calculation were the order parameter in the monolayer was assumed to be zero everywhere , while the lower right panel corresponds to the case in which the order parameter was calculated in self - consistent manner .",
    "the upper panels show the corresponding order parameter profiles ( black lines ) and the spatial evolution of the coherent peaks ( red lines ) . ]",
    "this long - range proximity effect can be better appreciated by looking directly at the local dos , _",
    "i.e. _  getting rid of the thermal broadening of the tunneling conductance .",
    "for this reason , in the lower panels of fig .",

    "[ comp - sc - nosc ] .",
    "we also include in the upper panels the corresponding profiles of the order parameter , as well as the evolution of the coherent peaks , defined as the position in energy of the maxima of the local dos .",
    "as one can see in the lower panels , in both cases the main feature in the local dos is the appearance of an induced gap which progressively disappears as we move away from the interface ; an induced gap that is obviously more pronounced than in the conductance spectra . in the non - self - consistent case , which corresponds to a standard @xmath3-@xmath2 junction ( with @xmath2 being a non - superconducting metal )",
    ", the decay of the induced gap away from the interface can be fitted by a function of the form @xmath144 , with @xmath145 nm . this means that this induced gap roughly scales as a local thouless energy @xmath146 , as it is well - known in standard diffusive @xmath3-@xmath2 junctions @xcite . in the self - consistent case",
    ", the decay of the induced gap can also be accurately described with the same type of function , but this time the existence of a finite induced order parameter in the monolayer is manifested in a larger decay length , which we numerically found to be @xmath147 nm for this example .",
    "so far , we have assumed in our theoretical analysis that the island is a perfect reservoir with a constant order parameter .",
    "however , as discussed in section [ sec - v ] , our experiments show a small inverse proximity effect in the form of a reduction of the coherence peak amplitude and energy , as well as the appearence of subgap states in the excitation spectrum of @xmath9 in the energy window @xmath86 $ ] .",
    "it is straightforward to extend the model discussed above to try to describe this inverse proximity effect .",
    "this simply requires to solve the usadel equation also inside the island taking into account that the pairing interaction constant , @xmath57 , takes different values in both electrodes , according to the corresponding critical temperatures .",
    "moreover , we must consider that the diffusion constant can be different in both superconductors .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_ipe_thy ] we present the results of the extension of our model to account for the inverse proximity effect . for simplicity ,",
    "we have assumed a perfectly transparent interface and the spatially - resolved spectra are shown for different values of the ratio @xmath148 , where @xmath149 and @xmath75 are the diffusion constants of the island and of the monolayer , respectively . as in the examples of the previous appendix",
    "we have used the following parameter values : @xmath128  k , @xmath22  mev , @xmath24  mev , and @xmath137  @xmath72/s .",
    "these results suggest that the weak proximity effect observed inside the island could be naturally described within our model by simply assuming that @xmath149 is much smaller than @xmath75 ( around ten times smaller ) .",
    "however , given the small value of @xmath75 , it seems unlikely that the pb island could have such a small diffusion constant .",
    "we believe that this result might be an artifact of our 1d model . a more natural explanation for the weak proximity effect would invoke the higher dimensionality of the island , which surely leads to a quick geometrical dilution of the order parameter inside .",
    "the confirmation of this idea would require performing 3d simulations , which are out of the scope of this work .",
    "for this reason , and since the proximity effect inside the crystalline monolayer is indeed the main problem of interest in this work , we have decided to stick in the main text to the model in which the island is considered as a perfect superconducting reservoir .",
