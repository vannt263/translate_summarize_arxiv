    "low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxb ) containing old and low magnetic - field neutron stars ( ns ) are usually divided into z and atoll sources , according to the path they describe in an x - ray color - color diagram ( cd ) or hardness - intensity diagram ( hasinger & van der klis 1989 ) assembled by using the source count rate over a typical ( usually 220 kev ) x - ray energy range .",
    "atoll sources are usually characterized by relatively low luminosities ( @xmath9 ) and some show transient behavior , while the six known z sources in the galaxy are among the most luminous lmxbs , accreting persistently close to the eddington limit ( @xmath10 ) for a 1.4 @xmath11 ns .",
    "the instantaneous position of an individual source in the cd , which determines most of the observed spectral and temporal properties of the source , is thought to be an indicator of the mass accretion rate ( e.g.  hasinger et al .",
    "1990 ; see van der klis 1995 for a review ) .",
    "it has been suggested that the mass accretion rate ( but not necessarily the x - ray luminosity ) of individual sources increases along the track from the top left to the bottom right , i.e.   from the islands to the banana branch in atoll sources and from the horizontal branch ( hereafter hb ) to the normal branch ( nb ) and to the flaring branch ( fb ) in z sources .    however , while there is a general correlation between temporal variability properties ( in particular frequencies of the observed quasi periodic oscillations , qpos , see van der klis 2000 for a review ) and position in the cd , the correlation with the source x - ray count rate or x - ray flux in the 250  kev energy range is complex ; a correlation is observed on short time scales ( hours to days ) , but not on longer time scales .",
    "a possible explanation of this behavior is that most timing and spectral parameters are determined by the dynamical properties of the accretion disk , while the x - ray flux is determined by the total accretion rate , which may be different from the instantaneous accretion rate through the disk if , for instance , matter can flow radially close to the ns ( see e.g.  van der klis 2001 ) .",
    "hard x - ray spectra extending up to energies of several tens to hundred kev have been revealed in about 20 `` faint '' ns lmxbs ( some of them are confirmed atoll sources , see di salvo & stella 2002 for a review ) . in these systems",
    "a power law - like component is observed , with typical photon indices of @xmath12 , and a high energy exponential cutoff between @xmath13 and many tens of kev .",
    "this component is interpreted in terms of unsaturated thermal comptonization .",
    "sometimes , in the so called `` hard state '' of atoll sources , there is no evidence for a cutoff up to @xmath14  kev .",
    "some sources appear to spend most of the time in this state ( e.g.  4u 0614 + 091 , ford et al . 1996 ; piraino et al .",
    "1999 , and references therein ) . in others a gradual transition from the soft to the hard state has been observed in response to a decrease of the source x - ray luminosity and/or the source drifting from the banana branch to the island state .",
    "this transition is often modelled in terms of a gradual decrease of the electron temperature ( and increase of the optical depth ) of the comptonizing region .    on the other hand ,",
    "the spectrum of the z sources is much softer , with cutoff energies usually well below 10  kev .",
    "however , hard tails were occasionally detected in their spectra .",
    "a variable hard component dominating the spectrum of sco x1 above @xmath15  kev was detected as early as 1966 ( peterson & jacobsen 1966 ; see also riegler et al . 1970 ; agrawal et al .",
    "1971 ; haymes et al .",
    "in other occasions the hard tail in sco x1 was not found ( e.g. , miyamoto & matsuoka 1977 , and references therein ; soong & rothschild 1983 ; jain et al .",
    "1984 ; ubertini et al . 1992 ) , perhaps owing to pronounced variations .",
    "evidence for a hard component was also found in cyg  x2 ( peterson 1973 ) , gx  349 + 2 ( greenhill et al . 1979 ) , and in ginga data of gx 51",
    "( although in this case a contribution from a contaminating source could not be excluded , asai et al . 1994 ) .    renewed interest in the hard x - ray emission properties of luminous lmxbs was motivated by some recent observations , mostly using the broad band capabilities of bepposax ( 0.1200 kev ) and rxte ( 2220 kev ) .",
    "recently a hard tail was detected in gx  17 + 2 , observed by bepposax . in this case",
    "the intensity variations of the hard tail were clearly correlated with the source spectral state : a factor of 20 decrease was observed moving from the hb to the nb ( di salvo et al .",
    "the presence of a variable hard tail in sco x1 was recently confirmed by osse and rxte observations ( strickman & barret 2000 ; damico et al .",
    "a hard tail was also detected in gx 349 + 2 ( di salvo et al .",
    "2001 , hereafter paper i ) and cyg  x2 ( frontera et al . 1998 ; di salvo et al . 2002 ) , as well as in the peculiar bright lmxb cir x1 ( iaria et al . 2001 ) .",
    "these hard components can be fitted by a power law , with photon index in the range 1.93.3 , contributing up to 10% of the total source luminosity .",
    "gx  349 + 2 , also known as sco x2 , was called an odd - ball among the z sources ( kuulkers & van der klis 1998 ) .",
    "similar to the case of sco x1 , gx  349 + 2 shows a short and underdeveloped hb ( if at all ) . the source variability in the frequency range below 100 hz",
    "is closely correlated with the source position on the x - ray cd , as in other z sources .",
    "quasi periodic oscillations at khz frequencies ( khz qpo ) were detected in the nb of its z - track ( zhang , strohmayer , & swank 1998 ) .",
    "however , gx  349 + 2 , which sometimes shows broad noise components changing not only with the position in the z , but also as a function of the position in the hardness - intensity diagram , differs somewhat from the other z sources and shows similarities to the behavior seen in bright atoll sources , such as gx 13 + 1 and gx 3 + 1 ( kuulkers & van der klis 1998 ; see also oneill et al . 2001 , 2002 ) .",
    "using a bepposax observation performed in march 2000 , di salvo et al .",
    "( 2001 ) showed that the source energy spectrum below 30 kev could be well fit by a blackbody ( with a temperature of 0.50.6 kev ) and a comptonized component ( with seed - photon temperature of @xmath16 kev and electron temperature of @xmath17 kev ) .",
    "three discrete features were observed in the spectrum : an emission line at 1.2 kev , probably associated to ne x or a complex l - shell of fe xxiv , an emission line at 6.7 kev and an absorption edge at 8.5 kev , both corresponding to emission from the k - shell of highly - ionized iron ( fe xxv ) . above 30 kev , during the non - flaring state ,",
    "a power - law component was significantly detected having a photon index of @xmath18 and a flux of @xmath19 erg @xmath20 s@xmath2 in the energy band 1060 kev . because there was no evidence of contaminating sources",
    ", the authors concluded that the most probable candidate for the hard emission was gx 349 + 2 itself .",
    "the hard component detected in gx  349 + 2 is one of the hardest among the high energy components detected so far in bright lmxbs , with no evidence for a high energy cutoff in the bepposax range ( up to @xmath21  kev ) .    in this paper",
    "we report the results of a spectral study of a long ( @xmath22 ks ) bepposax observation of gx  349 + 2 in the energy range 0.1200  kev .",
    "we find that , although the spectrum below 30 kev is similar to that observed during the observation reported on paper i , the hard component is not present ( or significantly weaker ) during our observation , demonstrating that these hard tails can be highly variable and are probably not univocally related to the position in the cd .",
    "the narrow field instruments ( nfi ) on board the bepposax satellite are four co - aligned instruments which cover more than three decades in energy , from 0.1  kev up to 200  kev , with good spectral resolution over the whole range ( see boella et al .",
    "1997a for detailed description of bepposax instruments ) .",
    "these are two medium energy concentrator spectrometers , mecs ( position sensitive proportional counters operating in the 1.310  kev band , boella et al .",
    "1997b ) , a low energy concentrator spectrometer , lecs ( a thin window position sensitive proportional counter with extended low energy response , 0.110  kev ; parmar et al .",

    "in this paper we report on two bepposax observations of gx  349 + 2 . the source was observed from 2001 february 12 11:23 ut to 2001 february 13 17:43 ut and from 2001 february 17 16:15 ut to 2001 february 19 20:42 ut .",

    "a 1% systematic error was applied to the spectra selected in different regions of the cd , and a 2% systematic error was applied to the averaged spectrum to take into account possible variability of the spectrum during the observation .",
    "we extracted an averaged spectrum from the two bepposax observations . following the results of paper i",
    ", we started fitting the continuum with a blackbody plus a comptonized component ( comptt , titarchuk 1994 ) obtaining a @xmath34(d.o.f . ) of 309(197 ) .",

    "the fe xxv line is broader than the s xvi and fe xxiv lines probably because it is produced in the inner region of the corona and the the escaping photons are more affected by compton scattering .",

    "one of the main results of this paper regards the hard component . at",
    "energies higher 30 kev a hard excess is indeed present in our observations .",
    "however , the 1060 kev flux of the power - law component that we used to fit this hard excess is one order of magnitude lower than that measured during the bepposax observation of march 2000 ( paper i ) , although the source was in a similar position of the z track . in paper",

    "the photon index of the power law is 1.5 ( still compatible with the previous value ) , while the flux in the same energy band is @xmath125 ergs @xmath20 s@xmath2 .",
    "indeed we can not exclude that the power law we fit during our observations is due to the hard diffuse emission of the galactic ridge . using data from valinia & marshall ( 1998 ) , for latitudes @xmath126 and longitudes @xmath127 ( the region of gx  349 + 2 ) the flux of the diffuse galactic emission is @xmath128 ergs @xmath20 s@xmath2 in the 1060 kev energy range for the effective solid angle of the pds fov and the photon index of the power - law is @xmath129 .",
    "these values are compatible to those we found in our analysis of gx 349 + 2 .",
    "we conclude that the hard power - law component during these new bepposax observations is much weaker or even absent .",
    "a hard power - law component was observed in several z sources , indicating that this is probably a common feature of these sources .",
    "the presence ( or strength ) of these components appears sometimes to be related to the source state or its position in the cd .",

    "in this source the intensity of the hard component ( a power - law with photon index of @xmath17 ) showed the strongest intensity in the hb of its cd ; a factor of @xmath13 decrease was observed when the source moved from the hb to the nb , i.e.   from low to high inferred mass accretion rate .",
    "for other sources some evidence was found that the hard component becomes weaker for higher accretion rates ( gx  51 , asai et al . 1994 ; gx  349 + 2 , paper i ; cyg x2 , di salvo et al .",
    "2002 ; cir x1 , iaria et al .",
    "however , in recent rxte / hexte observations of sco x1 , a hard power - law tail was detected in 5 out of 16 observations , without any clear correlation with the position in the cd ( damico et al .",
    "gx 349 + 2 may show a behavior that is similar to the one observed in sco x1 .",
    "indeed gx 349 + 2 , as well as gx 17 + 2 , is classified as a sco - like source , which are thought to have a lower inclination than the other z sources ( referred to as cyg - like sources ; kuulkers et al .",
    "1994 ; kuulkers & van der klis 1995 ) , and similarly to sco x1 ( but not to gx 17 + 2 ) , does spend a relatively short time in the hb ( i.e.  at the lowest inferred mass accretion rates ) .",
    "the behavior of sco x1 and gx 349 + 2 suggests that there might be a second parameter , besides mass accretion rate or position of the source in the z - track , regulating the presence of hard emission in these systems . as already mentioned , the second parameter regulating the spectral state transitions might be the truncation radius of the optically thick disc .",
    "however , what determines the radius at which the disc is truncated is not clear yet : this could be the mass accretion rate through the disk normalized by its own long - term average ( as proposed by van der klis 2001 ) , but also magnetic fields , the fraction of power dissipated in a hot , optically thin , corona ( see e.g.  chen 1995 ) , or the formation / quenching of a jet could play a role .",
    "interestingly , strickman & barret ( 2000 ) suggest that the hard x - ray emission present in sco x1 data from osse may be correlated with periods of radio flaring .",
    "this might be generally true for this kind of systems .",
    "although the mass accretion rate appears to be the main parameter driving the spectral hardness of atoll sources , there is evidence that at least on occasions an additional parameter controls the soft / hard spectral transitions .",
    "a clear example is given by a recent observation of 4u 170544 , in which the source underwent a soft to hard state transition while the 0.1200  kev bolometric luminosity of the source decreased by a factor of @xmath130 from the soft to the hard state and increased by only a factor of @xmath85 in the opposite transition from the hard to the soft state ( barret & olive 2002 ) .",
    "on another occasion the same source displayed hard and soft states in which the source luminosity was different by a much larger factor , up to one order of magnitude .",
    "again , the second parameter regulating the spectral state transitions might be the truncation radius of the optically thick disc .",
    "note also that even though variations of the mass accretion rate appear to be the main cause of the spectral transitions of accreting black hole candidates ( bhcs ) , there is some evidence that a second , yet unknown , parameter can give rise to these transitions .",
    "the existence of a second parameter was indeed proposed to explain the soft / hard spectral transitions observed in the bhcs xte  j1550564 ( homan et al . 2001 ) and gs  2000 + 25 ( tanaka 1989 ) .",
    "there might be , however , another explanation for the difference in the hard x - ray component between the march 2000 and the february 2001 bepposax observations . from the light",
    "curves shown in figures  [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] it can be seen that the source was continuously flaring diring the last bepposax observation .",
    "the longest continuous time interval that the source spent in a persistent flux level ( below @xmath22 counts / s ) is @xmath131 ks . on the other hand",
    ", the source spent a longer continuous time in a persistent flux level during the previous observation , showing only one big ( i.e.  with a count rate higher than 200 counts / s ) flare during almost 100 ks of total observation time ( see a light curve in fig .  1 of paper i ) .",
    "it can therefore be that the continuous flaring activity during the last bepposax observation has quenched the hard x - ray emission .",
    "in other words , while the source was mainly in the vertex between the nb and the fb ( where the hard x - ray component was indeed significantly detected ) during the previous bepposax , with only a short - lasting excursion in the fb , the source was mainly in the fb during the last bepposax observation . in this case the non - detection of the hard component during the last bepposax observation is in agreement with the non - detection of the hard component during the flaring state in the previous bepposax observation ( although the relatively low statistics , due to the short exposure time , did not allow a definitive conclusion in the previous observation ) and with the paradigm that the hard emission is suppressed at the highest inferred mass accretion rates .",
