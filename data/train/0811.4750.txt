    "the radio source j133658.3295105 ( object 28 in @xcite list ) in m83 , is described as the core of an fr ii radio source @xcite whose radio lobes are objects 27 and 29 in the same list .",
    "the source presents characteristics of a radio galaxy or a quasar at a distance @xmath6 as discussed by @xcite .",
    "these authors have found that at a distance d@xmath7=4.7gpc ( @xmath8=1 , q@xmath9=0.5 , h=75kms@xmath2mpc@xmath2 ) , j133658.3295105 @xmath10 and @xmath11 fit reasonably well with the expected frii radio - sources luminosities .",
    "m83 and ngc5128 ( cena ) are the largest galaxies in one of the most active regions in the nearby sky , the hydra - centaurus group .",
    "merger processes as well as galactic inner build - up are evident in both galaxies .",
    "the radio source ( rs ) 28 appears projected at about 60 from the nucleus of m83 and the line joining rss 27 , 28 , and 29 appears to emerge from the m83 bulge as seen in figure  [ fig : global ] ( and figure1 of * ? ? ?",
    "this alignment was originally proposed by @xcite to be a jet from the nucleus of m83 . moreover ,",
    "rss 30 , 32 , and 36 , and the m83 optical nucleus ( on ) itself appears to be strongly aligned with this structure , too ( figure  [ fig : global ] , right ) the whole structure covers @xmath12  on the sky .",
    "none of these radio sources are supernova remnants nor do they appear associated with hii regions @xcite .",
    "rs 32 emits x - rays as a soft x - ray binary .",
    "rs 36 was also described as an x - ray binary with evidence for x - ray spectral evolution .",
    "the optical nucleus of m83 is also a radio and x - ray source @xcite .",
    "these intriguing features encouraged us to try to determine more precisely the distance to rs 28 .",
    "the complex structure of the central 300pc of the bulge of m83 suggests the possibility of it hosting a kick - off object , which has been theoretically predicted @xcite , but not yet observed @xcite .",
    "indeed , the condensation traditionally recognized as the m83 optical nucleus ( on ) ( figure  [ fig : kick - off]c ) is off - centered by @xmath13(@xmath1480pc ) to the northeast with respect to the center of the external @xmath15-band isophotes of the bulge @xcite . at the bulge center , @xcite",
    "have found the kinematic center ( kc ) .",
    "more recently , @xcite demonstrated the existence of a third condensation ( hidden nucleus , hn ) , also hidden at optical wavelengths , 7@xmath16(@xmath14140pc ) to the west - southwest of kc which seems to be a small galaxy being cannibalized @xcite .",
    "there is an arclet @xmath17 to the southwest of kc ( figure  [ fig : kick - off]c ) with more than twenty 30-dor - like giant hii regions @xcite . pa@xmath18",
    "observed around kc and hn indicates the presence of regions that are actively forming stars @xcite .",
    "the derived mass of on is @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "these authors proposed a similar mass for kc , while @xcite determined a larger value of @xmath160 @xmath20m@xmath21 .",
    "hn has a mass of 16@xmath20m@xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the upper mass limits for the putative black holes ( bhs ) associated with on , kc , and hn are 0.21.0@xmath22 m@xmath23 @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations show that on , kc , hn and the arclet of hii regions will merge , forming a single massive core in a few hundred myr @xcite .",
    "parallel to the merging process at the center of m 83 , molecular clouds in the bar seem to be funneled inward @xcite , guaranteeing central mass accretion in the future .",
    "we discuss here the optical observations of the radio source j133658.3295105 , taken to more precisely derive its distance and its nature .",
    "in 2007 april , we obtained a 5 hr spectrum with the reosc echelle spectrograph in a simple dispersion mode at the casleo 2.2 m telescope , in argentina .",
    "reosc has a 1024@xmath241024 tek ccd , with a 24@xmath25 m pixel size .",
    "a 1200 lines mm@xmath2 grating was used , covering the wavelength range from 6200 to 6900  around h@xmath26 .",
    "the dispersion was 32 mm@xmath2 , the reciprocal dispersion 0.76 pix@xmath2 , the resolution 2.5  , and the angular scale was 102 pix@xmath2 .",
    "the slit ( at p.a.=152@xmath27 ) was positioned on an hii region 25 to the to the east - southeast of rs28 .",
    "these 2  seeing observations confirmed the nature of the hii region . on the basis of an accurate astrometric analysis of the source in different spectral domains",
    ", we planned the subsequent gemini multi object spectrographs - south ( gmos - s ) observations . figure  [ fig : rs28_position ] shows the astrometry and the hii region to the east - southeast of rs28 on a ( h@xmath28 ) cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) image .",
    "rs 28 was observed by gmos - s at gemini south in 2007 june ( program gs-2007a - dd-17 ) .",
    "we performed broad and narrow band imaging in the range 500 to 950 nm , centered at the position of the radio source emission peak with average seeing of @xmath29 .",
    "the observed bands and exposure times were @xmath30 : 90s ; [ oiii ] : 121s ; [ oiii]c : 121s ; h@xmath0 : 91.5s ; h@xmath0c : 91.5s ; [ sii ] : 91.5s ; @xmath31 : 60s ; cat : 60s and @xmath8 : 91.5s .",
    "spectroscopy in the spectral range 572 - 988 nm was performed with an effective exposure time of 3600s and average seeing of @xmath29 .",
    "a @xmath32 long slit was positioned on rs28 and oriented along the line of radio sources shown in figure  [ fig : global ] ( p.a.=140@xmath27 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : kick - off ] shows the co - added image from the observed gmos - s bands @xmath33 , [ oiii ] , [ oiii]c , h@xmath0 , h@xmath0c , [ sii ] , @xmath8 , @xmath31 , and cat .",
    "we estimate that the detection limit at signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath34 is m@xmath35 .",
    "this is based on an average seeing of @xmath29 , and takes into account the background noise from the m83 disk .",
    "it is expected that the disk of m83 will dim background objects . @xcite",
    "derive an azimuthal mean absorption @xmath36mag at r around 1kpc , which translates into @xmath37 mg ( assuming @xmath38 ) .",
    "@xcite obtained , for three face - on galaxies , an inter - arm absorption 0.20.5mag smaller than the azimuthal mean at 800 nm .",
    "that would lead to an absorption of the order of @xmath39mag for background objects at the projected position of rs28 on the m83 disk .",
    "these considerations lead us to estimate that our composed image could detect more than 80% of the broad- and narrow - line active galactic nuclei ( agns ) at @xmath40 in the sexsi sample ( see figure6 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , irrespective of the redshift .",
    "the blow up of the composed gmos image of the 20 around rs 28 in figure  [ fig : kick - off]b does not show any sign of an associated optical source .    we have determined the detectability of rs 28 in our images using cen a as an example .",
    "the radio source cen a originates from the elliptical galaxy ngc5128 , which hosts a seyfert2 nucleus with a strong dust lane across its main body .",
    "quasars with strong activity of star formation would present much dust , and probably would suffer internal absorption as ngc5128 does .",
    "the absolute brightness of ngc5128 is m@xmath41= -23.0mag at a luminosity distance 11mpc , @xmath42 .",
    "if cen a was located at @xmath43 , ngc5128 would shine at m@xmath44=21.5mag , or m@xmath44=23.1mag if located at @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , if located somewhere in the redshift range @xmath46 , a cen a type galaxy would be detectable by our imagery .",
    "the angular distance between the maxima of cen a radio lobes brightness is @xmath143@xmath27 ( 580kpc ) about twice the value quoted by @xcite for rs28 at @xmath47 .",
    "that relation is maintained if rs28 is at larger @xmath8 , since the angular size distance does not change significantly with @xmath8 , for @xmath48 .",
    "our spectroscopy suggests that we should detect any distant background agn - typical emission lines . in the co - added spectrum , the detection limit for the continuum of a giant elliptical galaxy at redshift 2 is m@xmath49 ( s / n@xmath50 ) , and it is m@xmath51 for h@xmath52 detection in a qso at @xmath53 .",
    "strong redshifted lines should fall into the spectral range covered by gmos for @xmath54 , as can be seen in the revised catalog of qsos @xcite .",
    "the most conspicuous emission lines and the corresponding @xmath8 intervals are : [ oii ] @xmath553727 ( 0.34,1.4 ) ; [ nv ] @xmath553426 ( 0.46,1.77 ) ; [ mgii ] @xmath552798 ( 0.8,2.4 ) ; [ ciii ] @xmath551909 ( 1.6,3.9 ) ; [ heii ] @xmath551640 ( 2.1,4.7 ) ; [ civ ] @xmath551549 ( 2.2,5.1 ) ; [ siv ] @xmath551402 ( 2.6,6.7 ) ; and [ nev ] @xmath551240 ( 3.4,7.6 ) .",
    "our observational constrains set a limit of the order of @xmath56 for large radio galaxies .",
    "we can get an idea of the expected s / n by looking at spectra obtained for broad- and narrow - lines agns at different distances by the keck observatory with exposure times of 1 to 2 hs @xcite . for a similar exposure time ( 3600s ) , we expect for gemini a s / n@xmath10.7 times that of keck .",
    "so , practically all lines , except for [ heii ] would be easily seen in our spectra .",
    "therefore , from our optical spectroscopy , we can confidently say that if rs28 is a high - redshift radio source , it should be at @xmath57 .",
    "the rs28 spectrum is compared in figure  [ fig : espectro1 ] with that of a simultaneously observed , well - defined hii region located on the arm to the north of rs28 .",
    "we see that h@xmath0 emission appears marginally at the rs28 spectrum , redshifted with respect to that of the hii region .",
    "radial velocities are respectively 618@xmath5830kms@xmath2 and 522@xmath5912kms@xmath2 .",
    "the hii region located to the east - southeast of rs28 ( figure  [ fig : rs28_position ] ) is at v@xmath60=490@xmath6112kms@xmath2 , based on our reosc - casleo data .",
    "reosc accuracy can be gaged by the nuclear spectrum taken on the same night and instrument configuration , which gives for the nucleus a v@xmath60=534@xmath5815kms@xmath2 .",
    "the heliocentric velocity of m83 , from the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) , is v@xmath60=513@xmath595kms@xmath2 .",
    "two - dimensional co observations @xcite provide for the nuclear region a value of v@xmath62kms@xmath2 ( error guess is from the position accuracy in figure3 of sakamoto et al . ) .",
    "this value has to be added to the lsr velocity of approximately 24kms@xmath2 ( obtained with ed murphy s calculator in http:@xmath63fuse.pha.jhu.edu ) to compare with our measurement .",
    "we conclude that reosc radial velocities are reliable within the errors .",
    "the radial velocity of rs28 is approximately 130@xmath5940kms@xmath2 larger than that of the close east - southeast hii region .",
    "the nucleus and the two hii regions show similar radial velocities because m83 presents a small inclination of 24@xmath27 with respect to the plane of the sky and the direction in discussion is at about 130@xmath27 from the galaxy major axis and practically perpendicular to the bar ( figure  [ fig : kick - off ] ) where noncircular motions are detected @xcite .",
    "this result leads us to conclude that the h@xmath0 emission marginally detected at rs28 is emitted by an object that does not take part of the disk kinematics , whose projected velocity in the radial direction is of the order of 100kms@xmath2 .",
    "these arguments point to a possible physical connection between rs28 and m83 .",
    "chance alignments do occur .",
    "a striking case is that of the two radio sources juxtaposed 1 to the northeast and southwest of scorpius ( sco ) x-1 , which for a long time were believed to be radio lobes of sco x-1 , until @xcite demonstrated by measuring sco x-1 proper motion that they are unrelated background sources . on the one hand",
    ", deep optical imaging and spectroscopy on the location of the radio source rs28 do not confirm the high - redshift nature of this object , and on the other hand , gmos / gemini - s spectroscopy marginally shows the presence of h@xmath0 in emission at a redshift similar to that of the galaxy but from a source kinematically well - differentiated from disk objects .    if its local character is confirmed , the frii radio source rs28 would have a total projected size @xmath10.5 - 1.0kpc .",
    "the possibility of rs28 being ejected by a gravitational recoil , remnant of a previous m83 nuclear merger , remains open . in that case",
    ", the driving engine within rs28 that produced the ejecta rs27 and rs29 would be an accretion disk like those postulated for microquasars in the galaxy and extragalactic radio sources .",
    "the reason why rs27 and rs29 sit along the apparent kick line remains unclear .",
    "physical properties of accreting bhs ( temperature , ejecta size , etc ) scale with some power of the bh mass @xcite . if ejecta size scales with the bh mass , a direct comparison with the microquasar 1e1740.7 - 2942 ( m@xmath64 10m@xmath65 , size@xmath15pc ; @xcite ) leads to a mass for a rs28 bh @xmath141000 to 2000m@xmath65 .",
    "the characteristic blackbody temperature for eddington - limit accretion @xcite should be @xmath66 or about 1/3 to 1/5 of that of a galactic microquasar .",
    "x - ray and/or near - ir spectroscopic observations will be necessary to scan redshifts @xmath67 , and also around @xmath68 , to unequivocally determine the distance to and the nature of j133658.3295105 .",
