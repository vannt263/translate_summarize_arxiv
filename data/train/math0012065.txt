    "if a contact structure on a @xmath2-manifold is cooriented , then every legendrian knot ( i.e. a knot that is everywhere tangent to the contact distribution ) has a natural framing ( a continuous normal vector field ) . hence when studying legendrian knots in such contact manifolds the main question is to distinguish those of them that realize isotopic framed knots .    on the other hand a cooriented contact structure @xmath3 on a manifold @xmath4 gives rise to a nondegenerate vector field @xmath5 in @xmath6 that coorients the contact structure . clearly if two legendrian knots @xmath7 and @xmath8 are isotopic as legendrian knots , then they are also isotopic in the category of knots that are everywhere nontangent to @xmath5 .",

    "vassiliev invariants can also be easily defined in the categories of legendrian and of pseudo - legendrian knots .",
    "the study of the groups of vassiliev invariants of legendrian knots was initiated by the work  @xcite of d.  fuchs and s.  tabachnikov where it was proved that the groups of @xmath0-valued vassiliev invariants of legendrian and of framed knots in the standard contact @xmath1 are canonically isomorphic .",

    "namely , such examples were constructed for @xmath25 and for any @xmath4 that is an orientable total space of an @xmath24-bundle over a nonorientable surface of genus bigger than one .",
    "this brought up a question what information about legendrian knots can be captured with the help of vassiliev invariants of legendrian knots .    here",
