    "fig : pointcloud ] ) .",
    "this indicates a hierarchical structure from @xmath41 to @xmath47 , and @xmath44 in the continuous random network .",

    "( iii ) the rings on @xmath43 and @xmath44 are constructed only by the oxygen atoms ( three and more , respectively ) .",
    "recalling that the death scale indicates the size of rings , the rings on @xmath42 are classified as sro , while those on @xmath41 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 are classified as mro .",
    "the fsdp observed in the structure factor @xmath48 ( @xmath49-@xmath50 @xmath51 ) has been supposed to be a signature of mro , but its real space origin is still controversial @xcite .",
    "here , we found that the distributions @xmath41 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 of the mro rings reproduce the @xmath52 values of the fsdp fairly well .",
    "moreover , we classified the mro rings as a real space origin of the fsdp .",
    "we first note that the death scales of the rings on @xmath41 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 are determined only by the oxygen atoms , and this is directly verified by the pd computation .",

    "more precisely , the ring @xmath13 disappears at @xmath18 by being covered up in the atomic ball model @xmath54 .",
    "hence @xmath55 measures the size of @xmath13 on @xmath41 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , where @xmath56 is the input radius of the oxygen atom .    from the aforementioned argument",

    "we emphasize here that this characteristic property shows the constraints on the shapes of the rings induced by the normal directions of these curves .",
    "for example , the shape of a ring on @xmath43 , which consists of three oxygen atoms ( see the right panel in fig .  [",
    "fig : codim_surface ] ) , is determined by specifying the first and second minimum edge lengths @xmath70 and @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) and the angle @xmath73 between them , and hence is realized in a three dimensional parameter space .",

    "it is worth noting that this new characterization of mro of o - o - o triangles in three dimensional parameter space can not be derived by separately analyzing the conventional distributions of lengths or angles , since each of them can only deal with the single parameter .     for the o - o - o triangles on @xmath43 .",

    "the presence of the curves also indicates variations in the shapes of the rings .",
    "that is , by following each curve along its tangential direction and studying its rings , we can observe the deformation of the rings .",
    "it is reasonable to suppose that these variations are due to thermal fluctuations , and hence the deformations of the ring configurations along the curves are probably softer than those in the normal directions .",
    "consequently , the response under strain is expected to follow the same shape constraints .    , @xmath43 , and @xmath42 for the original configuration @xmath35 of the amorphous state ( black ) ,",

    "the three panels on the top in fig .",
    "[ fig : pressure ] show the contours of the histograms restricted on @xmath41 , @xmath43 , and @xmath42 for the original configuration @xmath35 of the amorphous state ( black ) , for the strained state @xmath78 ( red ) , and for the artificial @xmath77 linear shrink @xmath79 of the original coordinates ( blue ) , respectively .",
    "the contours of @xmath43 are depicted on the coordinates along the tangential direction .",
    "the bottom three panels show the projections of the histograms on their normal axes .",
    "the figures show that the contours of the strained state shift along the original curves @xmath41 , @xmath43 , and @xmath42 in @xmath45 ; i.e. , downward in @xmath41 , leftward in @xmath43 , and almost fixed in @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "this is in contrast to a linear shrink , in which the contours simply move in the direction of decreasing both birth and death scales because of the uniform shrink of the system size .",
    "this strongly suggests that the configuration @xmath78 reflects the shape constraints and supports the expected mechanical response of pds .",
    "we also note from the figures of @xmath78 that the contour of @xmath42 is almost fixed compared with those of @xmath41 and @xmath43 . since @xmath41 and @xmath43 ( @xmath42 ) are classified as mro ( sro ) , this implies that mro is mechanically softer than sro . here",
    ", we remark that we can observe a similar behavior of the pds for a shear deformation .",
    "we have revealed that pds encode information about elastic response , similar to how the radial distribution function encodes volume compressibility @xcite .",
    "it should also be emphasized that the curves or islands appear in the pds of only the solids .",
    "this evidence suggests that these isolated distributions are related to the rigidity of the materials .",

    "similar to the case of silica , the crystalline structure is characterized by the island distributions in the pds ( see top panels in fig .  [",

    "its peak is separated from the curve of the tetrahedra ( see bottom right panel in fig .  [",

    ", the network structure of the dense packing regions characterizes the global connectivity beyond mro , which has not yet been investigated in detail .",
    "note that @xmath92 clearly separates the dense packing regions as the deformation curve of the tetrahedra and identifies the octahedral island as the main component of the complement structure . from the alexander duality in @xmath6 ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    ", the connectivity of the dense packing regions can be studied by the cavities of the complement .",
    "namely , we first extract all octahedra from the octahedral island in @xmath92 and construct a new set of points @xmath93 by putting a point at the center of each octahedron ( left of fig . [",

    "it should be remarked that the dual treatment is much easier and computationally more efficient than directly studying the intricate huge network structures .",
    "we also emphasize that the analysis here of treating the octahedra as a new input is an iterative usage of the pd method , and can be an effective approach for studying multi - scale geometry .     of the left figure with the multiplicity on the logarithmic scale .",

    "the shaded region of the radial distribution function in fig [ optimal : gofr ] ( bottom panel ) shows the split second peak of @xmath96 .",
    "then , we found that the pair - distance distribution of the atoms of generators in @xmath103\\times [ 1.76,2.01]\\subset d_2({\\mathcal{a}}^{\\rm cu_{50}zr_{50}}_{\\rm amo})$ ] also shows a clear splitting of the distribution ( black line in the top panel of fig .",

    "meanwhile the pair - distance distribution of generators other than @xmath102 shows a slight change there ( pink line in fig .",

    "this means that the generators around the octahedral distribution play a significant role for the split second peak .",
    "therefore , similar to the fsdp in the silica , this result demonstrates that the pds classify the length - scale of mro from other scales .",
    "we also studied the pds of only the zr component .",
    "the pd @xmath83 for zr in @xmath96 ( middle left panel in fig .",

    "we here remark that @xmath96 has higher glass forming ability than @xmath97 @xcite .",
    "relationships between the glass forming ability and the geometric structure are now actively studied ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "then , this result suggests another possibility that the presence of the hierarchical mro structure extracted from pds is also related to the glass forming ability of the alloy . in view of the results that the hierarchical mro structure in pds plays an important role for characterizing the glass states in @xmath104 ,",
    "this statement seems to be reasonable . in order to understand the geometric and topological formation of the glass",
    ", it will be a great challenge to clarify this new perspective .",
    "we have presented that pd is a powerful tool for geometric characterizations of various amorphous solids in the short , medium , and even further ranges . in this work ,",
    "we have addressed two different types of amorphous systems : continuous random network and random packing structures .",
    "both types of amorphous systems are characterized well by the existence of the curve and island distributions in the pds .",
    "these specific distributions characterize the shapes of rings and cavities in multi - ranges , and the analysis using optimal cycles explicitly captures hierarchical structures of these shapes .",
    "we have shown that these shape characteristics successfully reproduce the fsdp for the continuous random network and the split second peak for the random packing , and provide further geometric insights to them .",
    "furthermore , the global connectivity of dense packing regions in the lennard - jones system is revealed by the iterative application of the pd .",
    "for the binary random packing of the cu - zr metallic glass , we have also shown that the presence of the hierarchical mro rings in the single component suggests the relationship with the glass forming ability .",
    "the methodology presented here can be applied to a wide variety of disordered systems and enables one to survey the geometric features and constraints in seemingly random configurations .",
    "furthermore , as we investigated the mechanical response of the pds , studying dynamical properties of materials using the pd method would be of great importance to understand the relationship between hierarchical structures and mechanical properties .",

    "<S> although short - range order ( sro ) defined by the nearest neighbor is thoroughly studied , it is not sufficient to fully understand the atomic structures of amorphous solids . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , medium - range order ( mro ) has been discussed to properly characterize amorphous solids @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> many experimental and simulation studies @xcite have suggested signatures of mro such as a first sharp diffraction peak ( fsdp ) in the structure factor of the continuous random network structure , and a split second peak in the radial distribution function of the random packing structure . however , in contrast to sro , the geometric interpretation of mro and the hierarchical structures among different ranges are not yet clear .    among the available methods , </S>",

    "<S> importantly , in contrast to other topological tools , pds not only count topological features , but also provide the scales of these features . </S>",
    "<S> hence , pds can be used to classify topological features by their scales and clarify geometric relationships among them ; this is presumably the most desired function for deeper analysis of amorphous structures .    </S>",
    "<S> this article proposes a method using pds for various amorphous solids in a unified framework . </S>",
    "<S> the method is applied to atomic configurations and enables one to study hierarchical geometry embedded in amorphous structures , which can not be treated by conventional methods . </S>",
    "<S> we first applied the method to silica glass as an example of the continuous random network structure , and obtained the following results : ( 1 ) we found three characteristic curves in the pd of silica glass . </S>",
    "<S> these curves classify the sro rings in the @xmath0 tetrahedra and the mro rings constructed by those tetrahedra . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , a hierarchical relationship among the sro and mro rings was elucidated . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) the pd reproduced the wavelength of the fsdp and clarified a real space origin of the fsdp . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) each curve in the pd represents a geometric constraint on the ring shapes and , as an example , an mro constraint on rings consisting of three oxygen atoms was explicitly derived as a surface in a parameter space of the triangles . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we verified that these curves are preserved under strain , indicating that the pd properly encodes the material property of elastic response . </S>",
    "<S> next , as examples of the random packing structure , the lennard - jones system and cu - zr metallic glass were studied by the pds , and we clarified the following : ( 4 ) these amorphous solids were also characterized well by the distributions of curves and islands in the pds . </S>",
    "<S> ( 5 ) in the lennard - jones system , the global connectivity of dense packing regions was revealed by dualizing octahedral arrangements . ( 6 ) in cu - zr alloys , we found that the pair - distribution function defined by the octahedral region in the pd shows the split second peak . </S>",
