    "on 2003 march 21 during the galactic centre deep exposure ( gcde ) program _ integral _ detected a relatively bright source ( @xmath460 mcrab at 15 - 40 kev ) named igr j17464 - 3213 @xcite .",
    "the source was then localised at r.a .",
    "( 2000 ) @xmath5 , dec .",
    "@xmath6 , with an error box of 1.6 arcmin ( 90% confidence ) and associated with h1743 - 322 @xcite , a bright bhc observed by heao1 in 1977 with an intensity of 700 mcrab at 2 - 10 kev and localised with two possible positions @xcite .",
    "the error box of igr j17464 - 3213 was compatible with only one of these two , thereby resolving this 25 year old ambiguity .",
    "after the 2003 outburst , follow up observations with @xmath7 and _ integral _ reported strong flux and possible spectral variability @xcite .",
    "@xmath7 observed the source for the first time on 2003 march 29 during a pca galactic bulge scan followed by a pointed observation .",
    "the mean pca fluxes , in the bands 2 - 10 , 15 - 40 and 40 - 100 kev , were 50 , 200 , 220 mcrab respectively .",
    "the spectrum was consistent with an absorbed power law with a photon index 1.49@xmath8 0.02 , and a column density:@xmath9= @xmath10 @xcite . in this paper",
    "we focus on the data collected with the coded mask co - aligned telescopes ibis ( 15 kev - 10mev)@xcite , spi ( 20 kev - 8 mev)@xcite and jem - x ( 3 - 35 kev)@xcite on board _ integral _ @xcite .",
    "the source was monitored by _",
    "integral _ in the framework of the core programme ( cp ) observations @xcite .",
    "the data analysed here cover the period from the beginning of the outburst ( march 2003 ) to its end ( october 2003 ) .",
    "the analysed data set consists of all cp observations in which igr j17464 - 3213 was within the high energy detectors field of view . in particular , the observations were performed in three different periods : from 2003 march 12 to 2003 april 15 , from 2003 august 19 to 20 , from 2003 october 4 to 9 .",
    "the first period contains four observations of the pre - outburst state of the source ; the other two shorter observations cover the end of the outburst phase .",
    "all the cp observations are organised into un - interrupted 2000s long science windows ( scw ) : light curves , hardness ratio and spectra are then extracted for each individual scw .",
    "wide band spectra of the source are obtained using data from the three high energy instruments ( jem - x , ibis and spi ) .",
    "in particular , the ibis data were processed using the off - line scientific analysis ( osa version 3 ) @xcite released by the _",
    "integral _ scientific data centre ( isdc ) @xcite with a modified pipeline in order to optimise the source spectral extraction .",
    "the ibis data set has been divided in two subsets according to the source position being within the partially coded field of view ( pcfov ) or in the narrower fully coded field of view ( fcfov ) .",
    "both data sets have been used , after source intensity correction for off - axis detectors response , to produce the source light curves in different energy ranges .",
    "the off - axis correction was made using the available calibration data , the accuracy on the flux being from 10% at low energy ( 15 - 20 kev ) up to 5% at higher energy ( @xmath11 60kev ) .",
    "only fcfov data , less affected by the off - axis response of the gamma - ray instruments , was selected for spectral extraction and fitting .",
    "+ spi spectra were extracted using software specially developed for fitting the positions and the fluxes of all significant sources in the field of view .",
    "the background model used for spi data is based on an uniformity map determined for each energy band from empty fields observation .",
    "+ jem - x spectra were derived with the isdc osa version 4 release , and updated spectral matrices . while ibis and spi provide a very large fov ( @xmath1130 deg )",
    ", jem - x has a narrower fov ( @xmath1110 deg ) , thus providing only a partial overlap with the high energy detectors . when spectral data are obtained in the same time interval from more then one instrument , the proper normalizing constant",
    "is added in the data fit , taking into account the best knowledge of the instrument cross calibration . in optimum conditions ,",
    "the _ integral _ spectra we produced cover the range from 3 kev to 200 kev .",
    "the source was continuously monitored by the @xmath7 asm and whenever possible by _ integral _ as shown in figure  [ fig : fig1 ] , with the simultaneous _ integral _ observation periods represented by dashed rectangles .",
    "the monitoring of the source was quite continuous during the pre - outburst episode ( from revolution 53 to 61 ) and then only two deep observations were performed after about 4 ( revolution 103 ) and 5.5 month ( revolutions 119 - 120 ) . in our work we have not analysed the data of the outburst itself as they are proprietary data published elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we have produced light curves in the 20 - 30 , 30 - 40 , 40 - 80 kev energy ranges and investigated the hardness ratio , defined as @xmath12 .",
    "the ibis 20 - 30 kev and 40 - 60 kev light curves of the initial part of the outburst , flux averaged over one scw , are shown in figure  [ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "the ibis light curves show strong variations and it is possible to note several short peaks in the flux intensity with different shapes in the lower and higher energy bands . from the beginning of the ibis observation , mjd @xmath452729 to @xmath452731 , ( modified julian date )",
    "the source averaged intensity increases monotonically in the lower energy range while the flux is almost unchanged at higher energies : this is reflected in the anticorrelation shown by the hr that decreases continously in the same week as can be seen in figure  [ fig : fig2](c ) .",
    "the few points sampled in the next 20 days , due to a limited coverage , show a decrease in both low energy flux and hr . starting from day @xmath452744",
    ", the source shows a clearly visible flux increase in a few hours by a factor of 2.6 , 3.0 and 3.2 in the 20 - 30 , 30 - 40 and 40 - 60 kev ranges respectively , without any corresponding hardening . after the peak",
    ", the source emission falls by a factor of @xmath44.5 in the following hours ( 20 - 30 kev ) with a small decrease of the hr ; the soft part of the spectrum becomes now more prominent ( figure  [ fig : fig2 ] ) .",
    "this corresponds to a dip in the flux emission , lasting a few hours ( around day 52745.1 ) , during which the source shows the lowest observed value for the hr . finally ,",
    "the high energy component , and the hr , increase again ( mjd=52745.5 ) .",
    "the source shows a similar behaviour around mjd=52750 . to look for a possible correlation of the flux vs. spectral index",
    "we have fitted the available ibis spectra during revolution 53 , 57 , 59 - 61 and 119 - 120 , with a cutoff power law model .",
    "we noticed that the cut off energy of the model had substantially the same value in each fit , so we freeze it to an average value of e=53.3 kev .",
    "the reduced spectral fit @xmath13 covers a range from 0.8 to 1.3 .",
    "the result , summarised in figure  [ fig : fig3 ] , shows that the spectral index has a  circular \" or  hysteresis \" like behaviour .",
    "in fact , at the end of the main outburst ( revolution 103 - 120 ) , the source goes back in a hard state , very similar to the one of the pre - outburst ibis measurements ( revolution 53 ) , but in the lower energy range a disk black body component is still present .",
    "this behaviour is not unusual for bhc even if the physical reason is not fully understood @xcite .",
    "the whole set of data has been fitted with standard xspec tools and the best fits have been obtained with a multicolor disk black body ( diskbb ) model @xcite for the low energy data and a termal comptonization model ( comptt ) @xcite for the non thermal component .",
    "comptt generally provides lower values for the plasma temperature @xmath14 if compared with other models ( i.e. compps ) while modelling hard state spectra of bh transients , the advantage being the proper modelling of plasma with high optical thickness .",
    "the detailed spectral behaviour of the source is shown in figure  [ fig : fig4 ] . at the beginning of the outburst ( rev53 )",
    "the source is very weak and therefore the flux in the lower part of the jem - x spectrum is below the instruments sensitivity .",
    "therefore , it was possible to extract only a few points from jem - x data in the range 15 - 22 kev and only a 2@xmath15 upper limit at lower energy .",
    "a single comptt model fits the whole data set ( 15 - 150 kev ) well , as shown in table 1 with a @xmath16@xmath17@xmath4 20 kev and a @xmath18@xmath4 3 .",
    "the point corresponding to revolution 53 in figure  [ fig : fig3 ] shows the correlation between the photon index and the flux for this data , indicating a low / hard state @xcite . in a few days the source flux is then increasing quickly , and",
    "the statistics enable extraction of the spi spectra as well ( revolutions 56 and 60 - 61 ) .",
    "the high energy spectral evolution clearly indicates that the source make a transition to the soft state as also shown in the hr evolution ( see figure  [ fig : fig2 ]  ( c ) ) . during revolution 56",
    "the source was out of the jem - x fov therefore , only in this case , there are no data for e@xmath19 20 kev .",
    "but the source is quite luminous in the hard x - ray as shown by ibis and , moreover , looking at the time spectral evolution ( figure  [ fig : fig4 ] ) , is possible to suppose that the source is still in a low / hard state . in revolutions 57 - 59",
    "the 3 - 200 kev data can be fitted with a cutoff power law or with a thermal comptonization model without adding any black body component ( table 1 ) .",
    "conversely in revolutions 60 - 61 the disk black body appears very bright and the emission of this component account for 45@xmath20 of the total luminosity . during the phase of decreasing flux ( rev 103 )",
    ", there was no evidence of a hard tail in the ibis data ( 20 - 250 kev , 2 @xmath15 upper limit corresponding to @xmath21erg@xmath22@xmath23 ) while the source was clearly detected by jem - x ( see figure  [ fig : fig4 ] ) and the data fitted with a diskbb component showing a large value of the normalization constant ( @xmath24@xmath25 , see table 1 ) , that is proportional to the square of the inner accretion disk radius @xcite .",
    "the presence of a diskbb in igr j17464 - 3213 soft state is confirmed by the @xmath7 observation performed in 2003 may 28 ( mjd=52787 ) @xcite .",
    "two months later , close to the end of the outburst ( revolutions 119 - 120 ) , most of the flux is still due to the disk emission but a clear , though faint , comptonized high energy tail is present the ibis data .",
    "the ibis spectra taken at revolution 53 and 119 - 120,(i.e . at the beginning and at end of the outburst ) are compatible with the same comptt model parameters : it is clear that in both cases the source shows a hard tail in the high energy spectrum .",
    "moreover , at the end of the outburst a disk component is still present , as also confirmed by the @xmath7 analysis of the data collected immediately before this _ integral _ observation ( from 2003 august 26 to 2003 september 23 ) @xcite .",
    "the picture obtained from the spectral analysis in figure  [ fig : fig4 ] is quite clear , and summarised as follows .",
    "phase 1 : the source is in a  hard state \" . at the beginning of the _",
    "integral _ monitoring campaign ( revolution 53 ) the source has a low luminosity and the bulk of the emission is in the energy range 50 - 90 kev via comptonisation of soft photons in an optically thick hot inner part of the disk or corona ( @xmath16@xmath17@xmath420 kev and @xmath18 @xmath43 ) . in this phase",
    "there is no evidence of a soft disk component emission , with the disk being eventually truncated far from the hot inner region , though injecting soft photons that are up - scattered by the inner hot flow . in the next few days",
    "the amount of accreted matter is increasing dramatically and in revolution 56 ( @xmath410 days later ) the total emitted energy has increased by a factor of 30 : the temperature of the comptonised plasma is not changed and the optical thickness of the inner part of the corona become smaller , i.e. from @xmath18@xmath43 to @xmath18@xmath41.3 ( revolution 57 - 59 ) .",
    "there is still no evidence of soft emission from the system .",
    "slowly , the peak emission shifts from 70 kev ( revolution 53 ) to 40 kev ( revolution 56 ) to finally 20 kev ( revolution 57 - 59 ) . the spectral evolution is shown in figure  [ fig : fig4 ] ( top panel ) .",
    "phase 2 : the source is in a  soft / intermediate state \" ( revolution 60 - 61 ) . over a few days the average amount of energy released increases by a factor of 3 to 5 , the optical thickness of the inner part of the corona becomes lower and lower ( @xmath18 @xmath40.4 ) , the temperature of the hot comptonised part increases accordingly up to @xmath440 kev and a bright soft disk component become visible , being responsible for the majority of the system energy release .",
    "the fit parameters are compatible with a @xmath26 temperature of 1.5 kev and a disk close to the last stable orbit .",
    "the spectrum obtained with jem - x , ibis and spi ( figure  [ fig : fig4 ] , middle panel ) has a high statistical significance showing the presence of a substantial comptonised component .",
    "a few days later the source has reached its maximum , showing a factor of two more flux but basically unchanged high energy behaviour @xcite .",
    "phase 3 : the source enters the  soft state \" .",
    "the last observations were performed a few months after the main peak of the outburst ( revolution 103 - 120 ) . the energy release has substantially decreased ( factor of @xmath43 ) ,",
    "the hard emission has basically switched off , and the comptonised photons energetics dropped by a factor of more than 10 with emission peaked at about 70 kev as in the pre - outburst state ( revolution 53 ) .",
    "this primarily indicates the temperature of the disk dropping to 0.9 kev , and the disk substantially outside from the last stable orbit .",
    "soon afterwards , the source was no longer detectable by _ integral _ ; one month later it was also below the asm/@xmath7 detection capability .",
    "the _ integral _ observation of igr j17464 - 3213 has been essential to disentangle the source behaviour and its spectral state evolution and , in turn , to better understand the physical processes active in the system in the different states .",
