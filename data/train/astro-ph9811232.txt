    "the title of the original talk i was supposed to give was``on the critical mass '' .",
    "i was planning to cover the latest developments since my early work on the role of the critical mass in the physics and astrophysics of neutron stars and black holes@xcite . to discuss as well , how after my propoposal of identifying cygnus x1 as a black hole@xcite approximately ten binary systems with very similar characteristic have been found in our own galaxy .",
    "i was also going to stress that very little progress has been made in the intervening years about the determination of the critical mass of neutron stars due to the formidable theoretical difficulties in understanding the behaviour of matter at supranuclear densities and that indeed the theorem about the absolute upper limit to a neutron star mass , established by c. rhoades and myself@xcite , stands still as the pivotal point in the paradigm of identification of black holes versus neutron stars .",
    "it was my intention to show how , surprisingly , progress is being made recently in gaining a new understanding of the white dwarf critical mass : a classic problem considered by many people well settled , which is extremely attractive from a theoretical point of view .",
    "the white dwarfs offer the possibility of testing the concept of critical mass in a regime where all physical theories work in the exact range of their tested validities : there are not unknown due to extrapolation of physical theories to yet unexplored domains as in the matter at supranuclear densities .",
    "the new effects can be computed by generalizing to a relativistic treatment the classical results of the feynmann - metropolis- teller work based on the fermi - thomas model of the atom to relativistic regimes .",
    "the consequences on the estimate of the critical mass can be of paramount importance in the understanding the observed values of the neutron stars in binary systems as well the process of formation of such systems .    however , the recent observations of the beppo - sax satellite , the discovery of a very regular afterglow to grb s , the fact their x - ray flux varies regularly with time according to precise power laws ( costa _ et al._@xcite ; van paradijs _",
    "et al._@xcite ) , and especially the optical and infrared identification of these sources ( kulkarni _ et al._@xcite , halpern _",
    "et al._@xcite and ramaprakash _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) which has established their correct cosmological setting and determined their formidable energy requirements convinced me to reconsider some theoretical results on black hole astrophysics ( see e.g. ruffini _ et al._@xcite , fang , ruffini and sato@xcite ) and to develop a detailed model for a direct confrontation with the observational results .    for these reasons",
    "i have deceided , with the consensus of the organizers , to modify slightly the title of my talk to a new talk and deceided to insert this material on the critical mass in a different publication@xcite .",
    "this will allow me to introduce today a most urgent new concept : the dyadosphere of a black hole and offer this new concept to humitaka sato for his sixtyfifth birthday .",
    "it is now generally accepted that black holes are uniquely characterized by their total mass - energy @xmath5 , charge @xmath6 , and angular momentum @xmath7@xcite .",
    "the uniqueness theorem has finally been proved after some twenty five years of mathematical work by numerous authors recently reviewed in ref.@xcite .",
    "i _ assume _ that the process of gravitational collapse for a core larger than the neutron star critical mass will generally lead to a black hole characterized by _ all _ three fundamental parameters of mass - energy @xmath8 , angular momentum @xmath7 , and charge @xmath6 ( see ruffini and wheeler @xcite ) .",
    "while the first two parameters @xmath8 and @xmath7 evolve on very long time scales , the charge @xmath6 will dissipate on much shorter time scales .",
    "in particular i show that if the electromagnetic field of an embh is overcritical in the sense of heisenberg and euler@xcite , it will dissipate on an extremely short time scale of approximately @xmath9 sec .  through a new process involving the  dyadosphere \" of a black hole .",
    "in a very short time @xmath1 , a very large number of pairs is created there and reaches thermodynamic equilibrium with a photon gas . in the ensuing enormous pem - pulse",
    ", a large fraction of the extractable energy of the embh in the sense of christodoulou - ruffini@xcite will be carried away .",
    "the pem - pulse will interact with some of the baryonic matter of the uncollapsed material and the associated emission is closely related to the observed properties of grb sources .",
    "the electromagnetic field of the remnant will further dissipate in the acceleration of cosmic rays or in the propulsion of jets on much longer time scales .",
    "the christodoulou - ruffini@xcite energy - mass formula for black holes gives @xmath10 with @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the irreducible mass , @xmath13 is the horizon radius and @xmath14 is the quasi spheroidal cylindical coordinate of the horizon evaluated at the equatorial plane .",
    "( i use c.g.s .",
    "units ) . from eqs .",
    "( [ em ] ) and ( [ s1 ] )",
    "it follows that up to 29@xmath15 of the mass - energy of an extreme rotating black hole with @xmath16 can be stored as rotational energy and gedanken experiments have been conceived to extract such energy ( see e. g. ruffini and wheeler@xcite and ref.@xcite ) . in the case of black holes endowed with an electromagnetic field , it follows from the same equations that up to 50@xmath15 of the mass energy of an extreme embh with @xmath17 can be stored in its electromagnetic field .",
    "it is appropriate to recall that even in the case of an extreme embh the charge to mass ratio is @xmath18 smaller then the typical charge to mass ratio found in nuclear matter , owing to the different strength and range of the nuclear and gravitational interactions . in other words",
    "it is enough to have a difference of one quantum of charge per @xmath19 nucleons in the collapsing matter for an embh to be extreme . by applying the classic work of heisenberg and euler@xcite to embh s ,",
    "as reformulated in a relativistic - invariant form by schwinger@xcite , damour and ruffini@xcite showed that a large fraction of the energy of an embh can be extracted by pair creation .",
    "this energy extraction process only works for embh black holes with @xmath20 .",
    "they also claimed that such an energy source might lead to a natural explanation for grb s and for ultra high energy cosmic rays .",
    "the general considerations presented in damour and ruffini@xcite are correct . however , that work has an underlying assumption which only surfaces in the very last formula : that the pair created in the process of vacuum polarization is absorbed by the embh .",
    "that view is now fundamentally modified here by the introduction of the novel concept of the dyadosphere of an embh and by the considerations which follow from its introduction .",
    "for simplicity we use the nonrotating reissner - nordstrom embh to illustrate the basic gravitational - electrodynamical process . the rotating kerr - newmann embh case will be considered elsewhere@xcite .    by introducing the dimensionless mass and charge parameters",
    "@xmath21 , @xmath22 , the horizon radius may be expressed as @xmath23 = 1.47\\cdot 10 ^ 5\\mu ( 1+\\sqrt{1-\\xi^2})\\hskip0.1 cm { \\rm cm}. \\label{r+}\\ ] ] outside the horizon the electromagnetic field measured in the orthonormal tetrad of an observer at rest at a given point @xmath24 in the usual boyer - lindquist coordinates ( see e.g. @xcite ) has only one nonvanishing component @xmath25 along the radial direction .",
    "we can evaluate the radius @xmath26 at which the electric field strength reaches the critical value @xmath27 introduced by heisenberg and euler , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the mass and charge of the electron .",
    "this defines the outer radius of the dyadosphere , which extends down to the horizon and within which the electric field strength exceeds the critical value . using the planck charge @xmath30 and the planck mass @xmath31",
    ", i express this outer radius in the form @xmath32 which clearly shows the hybrid gravitational and quantum nature of this quantity .",
    "the radial interval @xmath33 describing the dyadosphere as a function of the mass is illustrated in fig.[1 ] for selected values of the charge paramter @xmath34 .",
    "it is important to note that the dyadosphere radius is maximized for the extreme case @xmath35 and that the region exists for embh s with mass larger than the upper limit for neutron stars , namely @xmath36 all the way up to a maximum mass of @xmath37 .",
    "correspondingly smaller values of the maximum mass are obtained for values of @xmath38 as indicated in this figure . for embh s with mass larger",
    "than the maximum value stated above , the electromagnetic field ( whose strength decreases inversely with the mass ) never becomes critical .",
    "i turn now to the crucial issue of the number and energy densities of pairs created in the dyadosphere .",
    "if we consider a shell of proper thickness @xmath39 , the electric field is aproximately constant .",
    "we can then at each value of the radius @xmath24 model the electric field as created by a capacitor of width @xmath40 and surface charge density @xmath41 if we now turn to the process of pair creation in order to apply the qed results , we assume @xmath42 and we can express the rate of pair creation at a given radius @xmath24 by @xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 is the critical surface charge density and @xmath46 is the invariant four volume .",
    "we have for each value of the radius @xmath24 , the rate of pair creation per unit proper time @xmath47    the pair creation process will continue until a value of the field @xmath48 is reached , or correspondingly , in the capacitor language , till the surface charge density reaches the critical value @xmath49 . for @xmath50 or @xmath51 the pair creation process is exponentially supressed .",
    "we then have @xmath52 based on eq.([rate2 ] ) , one can get , @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the fine structure constant .",
    "( details are given in ref.@xcite . ) the time given by eq.([dis ] ) is so short , that the light travel time is smaller or aproximately equal to the width @xmath40 . under these circumstances",
    "the correlation between shells can be approximately neglected , thus we can justify the aproximation of describing the pair creation process shell by shell .    if we now turn to the dyadosphere its extension goes from the horizon @xmath55 all the way to a radius @xmath56 where @xmath57",
    ". the inner layer of the first shell of width @xmath40 , consisting of charges opposite to the one of embh s , will be captured by the horizon r+ , leading to a new embh with charge @xmath58 .",
    "the outer layer , of oppositely charged particles , will enter the dyadosphere .",
    "the remaining @xmath59 shells will also contribute to the plasma constituting the dyadosphere .",
    "it is noteworty to stress tha the number of pair created is _ not _ , as nively expected @xmath60 , but the number is tremendously amplified . in the limit @xmath61 , we have    @xmath62 . \\label{n}\\ ] ]",
    "we can now estimate from eq.([c ] ) the number of pairs created at a given radius @xmath24 in a shell volume of proper thickness @xmath42 @xmath63 , \\label{nn}\\ ] ] and correspondingly the number density of pairs created as a function of the radial coordinate , details in ref.@xcite and @xcite @xmath64 . \\label{nd}\\ ] ]    in figs.[2 ] and [ 3 ] , we plot the density of pairs for @xmath2 and @xmath3 embh for selected values of @xmath34 .",
    "these two values of the mass were chosen to be representative of objects typical of the galactic population or for the nuclei of galaxies compatible with our upper limit of the maximum mass of @xmath37 .    knowing the initial electrostatic energy density , and the final electric field value @xmath65 holding after the evolution of the dyadosphere , we compute the energy density of created pairs as a function of the radial coordinate by evaluating difference between the initial and final field configurations in the dyadosphere @xmath66 their total energy is then @xmath67    by taking the ratio of eq.([es ] ) and eq.([nd ] ) , we obtain the average energy per pair at each value of the radial coordinate .",
    "fig.[4 ] plots this quantity for an embh of @xmath2 and fig.[5 ] for an embh of @xmath3 . in the first case",
    "the energy of pairs near the horizon can reach @xmath68gev , while in the second case it never goes over a few mev .",
    "these two values of the mass were chosen to be representative of objects typical of the galactic population or for the nuclei of galaxies compatible with our upper limit of the maximum mass of @xmath37 .    due to the very large pair density given by eq.[13 ] and to the sizes of the cross - sections for the process @xmath69 , the system is expected to thermalize to a plasma configuration for which @xmath70 and reach an average temperature @xmath71 where @xmath72 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "the average energy per pair @xmath73 is shown as a function of the embh mass for selected values of the charge parameter @xmath34 in fig.[6 ] .",
    "finally we can now estimate the total energy extracted by the pair creation process in embh s of different masses for selected values of the charge parameter @xmath34 and compare and contrast these values with the maximum extractable energy given by the mass formula for black holes ( see eqs .",
    "( [ em ] ) and ( [ s1 ] ) .",
    "this comparison is summarized in fig.[7 ] .",
    "the efficiency of energy extraction by pair creation sharply decreases as the maximum value of the embh mass for which vacuum polarization occurs is reached . in the opposite",
    "limit the efficiency approaches @xmath74 .    as shown by ruffini _",
    "et al._@xcite the further evolution of this plasma leads to a relativistic expansion , @xmath75 annihilation and an enormous pair - electromagnetic - pulse  pem - pulse \" .",
    "the evolution of this pem - pulse has been studied by introducing a variety of models based on relativistic hydrodynamical equations , on quasi analitical and numerical treatments and comparing and constracting the results with the ones obtained by numerical simulation in the super - computer of livermore in california @xcite .",
    "it was possible to follow the evolution of the pem - pulse and its reaching relativistic velocities .",
    "a variety of models has been considered both in the absence and presence of baryonic matter , three examples are given in fig.8 .",
    "the pem - pulse in its evolution leads to a variety of emmision profiles , as a function of the embh mass , charge and of the amount of baryonic matter surrounding embh s .",
    "a brief example is given in fig.9 where most explicitly it is shown how the observed power law the afterglow of the gamma - rays burst is recovered with their characteristic time scale of @xmath9 sec .",
    "details for the computations and other example are given in ref.@xcite .",
    "if this basic scenario is confirmed by observations , other fundamental questions should be investigated to understand the origin of the dyadosphere .",
    "some preliminary work along these lines has already been done by wilson @xcite who has shown how relativistic magneto - hydrodynamical processes occurring in the accreting material around _ an already formed black hole _",
    "lead naturally to very effective charge separation and to reaching the critical value of the charge given by the limiting value of eq .",
    "( [ s1 ] ) on a timescale of @xmath76@xmath77 .",
    "these studies show the very clear tendency of powerful processes of charge separation and of magnetosphere formation to occur in accretion processes .",
    "they can not , however , be simply extrapolated to the formation of the dyadosphere .",
    "the time scale of the dyadosphere discharge is of the order of @xmath78 sec ( for a detailed discussion including relativistic effects , see jantzen and ruffini , @xcite ) .",
    "such a time scale is much shorter than the characteristic magnetohydrodynamical time scales .",
    "we expect that the formation of the dyadosphere should only occur during the gravitational collapse itself and _ in the process of formation _ of the embh , with the formation of a charge depleted region with an electric field sufficient to polarize the vacuum .",
    "a complementary aspect dealing with the extremization and equipartition of the electromagnetic energy in a gravitating rotating object advanced in ruffini and treves @xcite should also now be considered again .",
    "modeling such a problem seems to be extremely difficult at the present time , also in absence of detailed observations narrowing down the values of the fundamental parameters involved .",
    "confirmation of the basic predictions of the dyadosphere model by observations of gamma ray bursts and their afterglow would provide motivation and essential information to attack such a difficult problem .",
    "the model of grb s , based on the dyadosphere , is very different from the ones debated in the last ten years in the scientific literature , it can overcome some of their basic difficulties and on some specific aspects it can also have important analogies :    * the embh drastically differs from the most popular binary neutron stars model @xcite debated in the last 16 years .",
    "it presents over those models the distinct advantage of not having the recognized difficulty of explaining the energetic of grb s @xcite , and especially offers the possibility of computing explicitly and uniquely the details of the initial conditions by the energetic of the dyadosphere as given in the above fig.4 and fig.5 .",
    "* the further evolution of the dyadosphere ( the pem - pulse ) , has been analyzed by a variety of theoretical models based on relativistic hydrodynamics equations both on semi- analytical - numerical idealized models as well as with the help of a fully general relativistic hydrodynamical code .",
    "the combined results are at variance with many of the considerations in the current published papers dealing with fireballs and relativistic winds @xcite , though for a few aspects they present striking analogies .",
    "details are given in ref.@xcite .",
    "* the new treatment lead uniquely to the computation of the further evolution of the pem pulse in the afterglow era and again these specific analysis which can be uniquely derived from the above assumptions are at variance with the ones in the existing literature @xcite though they present some interesting analogies and they appear to be consistent with the latest observations @xcite .",
    "it goes without saying that the heisenberg - euler process of vacuum polarization considered here and in damour and ruffini @xcite has nothing to do with the evaporation of black holes considered by hawking @xcite either from a qualitative or quantitative point of view .",
    "the effective temperature of black hole evaporation given by hawking for a @xmath2 black hole is @xmath79 , which implies a black hole lifetime of @xmath80 years and an energy flux of @xmath81ergs / sec , while a @xmath3 black hole has a hawking temperature of @xmath82 and lifetime of @xmath83 years with an energy flux of @xmath84ergs / sec .    from a fundamental point of view",
    ", the process occuring in the dyadosphere represents the first mechanism capable of extracting large amounts of energy from a black hole with an extremely high efficiency .",
