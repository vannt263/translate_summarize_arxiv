    "in standard molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) , the crystal is grown in the @xmath8 direction layer by layer . however , well - established experimental techniques are able to grow materials in different crystal directions in sequential steps . as a first step a usual mbe growth process",
    "is performed then the crystal is removed from the chamber , thinned , scribed , returned to the chamber mounted at a 90 degree angle , then cleaved in - situ and regrown .",
    "this process is known as the cleaved edge overgrowth ( ceo ) technique .",
    "@xcite the ceo samples are used to investigate the edge properties of the quantum hall systems via momentum - resolved tunneling experiments , utilizing the second 2deg residing perpendicular to the hall system .",
    "@xcite these tunneling experiments show that the ceo edge provides an extreme sharp potential approximating an infinite wall .",
    "the sample structure proposed here does not involve tunneling , but rather probes the sharpness of the qhe edges via transport alone .",
    "a schematic presentation of the crystal is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "the hall bar lies in the @xmath9 plane , obtained by usual mbe growth , whereas on the right hand side of the crystal an additional algaas layer is grown .",
    "this is the ceo edge and is capped by a metallic gate .",
    "the gate covers all the surface and is kept at a fixed potential @xmath10 . to measure the global resistances and to drive an external current @xmath11 through the 2deg",
    ", ohmic contacts are deposited on the top surface of the system .",
    "the voltage probe contacts are labeled by a1 , a2 , b1 and b2 to measure @xmath2 and @xmath1 , whereas the current contacts s and d denote the source and the drain . in our discussion of the visibility of the iqhe , we will describe transport in such a ceo sample .",
    "we consider a system , where at one edge ( ceo edge ) a side gate resides , meanwhile the opposing edge is defined by standard etching process .",
    "this section aims to provide necessary theoretical and experimental background , to discuss the transport properties of the proposed ceo samples .",
    "our theory discussion is composed of two parts : first , we re - introduce the analytical formulation behind the self - consistent screening calculations and discuss the existence of incompressible strips .",
    "the second part presents the numerical results .",
    "next , we summarize the observations of two sets of experiments relevant for our discussion .",
    "the distinction between the small - sample edge iqhe and the large - sample bulk iqhe , is clarified after we discuss the results of local probe experiments and corresponding theory results . in the last part",
    ", we briefly recount the complementary transport calculations utilized by the screening theory to elucidate iqhe .      here",
    ", we briefly re - introduce the calculation scheme to obtain electrostatic potential and electron density distributions of a 2deg .",
    "let us assume that , the electrons are confined at the @xmath9 plane due to an external potential @xmath12 , which results from remote donors and metallic gates .",
    "at zero temperature and in the absence of a perpendicular magnetic field , this confinement potential will be filled with electrons up to the fermi energy @xmath13 continuously by the virtue of constant density of states @xmath14 , specific to 2d . taking into account the mutual ( direct ) coulomb interaction within a mean - field approximation , one obtains the hartree potential ( energy ) as v_ha(x , y)=_an_el(x , y)k(x , y;x,y)dxdy , where @xmath15 is the dielectric constant of the material , @xmath16 is the area where the 2deg is confined and @xmath17 is the solution of the poisson equation for the given boundary conditions , to be specified later . as a direct consequence , the total electrostatic potential energy that an electron experiences is v_t(x , y)=v_conf(x , y)+v_ha(x , y).in the next step , one should calculate the new electron distribution regarding this potential via solving the single particle schrdinger equation . for the moment , let us assume a generic hamiltonian @xmath18 and depict the energy eigen functions by @xmath19 and eigen values by @xmath20 .",
    "the effect of temperature on electron occupation can be incorporated utilizing the fermi - dirac function @xmath21 , then the electron density distribution is described as n_el(x , y)=_|_(x , y)|^2 f(e_,e_f , t).[eq : edensity ]    let us specify @xmath18 to be the single particle hamiltonian of a spinless electron subject to perpendicular magnetic field , given by h = h_b=(*p*-*a*(x , y))^2+v_t(x , y ) , where @xmath22 is the momentum and @xmath23 is the vector potential generating the magnetic field . here , we assume a translational invariance and the vector potential is expressed in the landau gauge . if we neglect the potential term for the moment , then the solution of the schrdinger equation gives the energy eigen values to be @xmath24 , known as the landau levels , and the wavefunctions as , @xmath25 .",
    "here , @xmath26 is the landau level index , @xmath27 is a normalization factor , @xmath28 is the quasi - continuous momentum in @xmath29 , @xmath30 specifies the orbit - center coordinate and @xmath31 is the cyclotron frequency .",
    "since , the eigen energies and values are known , one can obtain the electron density by eq .",
    "[ eq : edensity ] .",
    "now one can calculate the new potential depending on the new electron distribution , via solving the poisson equation .",
    "this procedure requires numerical self - consistency and is a formidable task in general . despite this difficulty ,",
    "such a numerical algorithm is available , which we also discuss in the following .",
    "however , we first re - introduce the non self - consistent analytical scheme to base our discussion on a simpler ground .      to surpass the complications due to numerical self - consistency , chklovskii et.al proposed an analytical calculation scheme to obtain potential and electron density distributions based on electrostatic arguments .",
    "@xcite there , the solution of the poisson equation is obtained by the use of holomorphic functions considering in - plane metallic gates at the sides .",
    "the commonly used thomas - fermi approximation is invoked , which is adequate if the external potential varies smoothly within the magnetic length .",
    "in addition , the wavefunctions are replaced by dirac - delta functions .",
    "it is assumed _ a priori _ that , screening is perfect at the compressible strips and is poor at the incompressible strips .",
    "hence , the external potential is completely screened at the compressible strips and total potential profile there is flat . at",
    "the compressible strips the density profile resembles that without @xmath0 field , given by n_el(x)=n_0()^1/2,via the solution of the poisson equation . here , @xmath32 is the bulk electron density and @xmath33 is the depletion length determined by the potential at the in - plane gate .",
    "@xcite in contrast , at the dipolar incompressible strips the potential varies by an amount of cyclotron energy @xmath34 , whereas the density is constant . under these assumptions",
    "the width of the dipole incompressible strip is given by ,  @xcite a_n= , where @xmath35 is the single particle energy gap ( @xmath36 , assuming spin degeneracy ) .",
    "in generic samples , the electron density distribution varies smoothly starting from the depleted region at the edge .",
    "hence , the derivative of the electron density with respect to spatial coordinate is small , which in turn determines the width of the incompressible strip . for sufficiently weak confining electric fields , these dipole strips are so wide that they effectively isolate the compressible strips on either side , and these dipole strips earn the name incompressible strips , as they represent a strip where no screening can take place .    as mentioned , the thomas - fermi approximation is viable only if the potential varies slowly on the scale of magnetic length , therefore , the tfa becomes questionable if the strip width becomes comparable to @xmath37 .",
    "the full self - consistent quantum mechanical treatment of the electron density within a mean field approximation shows that , the dipole strips cease to be incompressible for all magnetic field strengths .",
    "@xcite in fact , the collapse of the incompressible strips can be readily seen considering the effect of ( local ) external electric fields within the strip .",
    "@xcite it is straightforward to show that , the external electric field within the strip broadens the dirac - delta shaped landau dos and the resulting local dos assumes the form d(e , x(e))=_n|_n(x(e))|^2 , [ eq : eldos]where @xmath38 is the field at the strip and @xmath39 is the normalized coordinate , that depends on energy .",
    "hence , if the electric field at the strip becomes large ( i.e. if the strip becomes narrow @xmath40 , since the potential variation is fixed to @xmath34 ) , then the adjacent landau levels overlap , at the energy scales @xmath41 . if this condition is satisfied the strip collapses , and disorder can easily scatter charge from the compressible region on one side to that on the other . in other words ,",
    "the dipole strip has become too narrow and is able to screen electric fields within its width .",
    "such a result contrasts with 1d edge channel theories ,  @xcite which predict more than one channel should always exist for @xmath42 .",
    "the collapse of ( narrow ) incompressible strips described here is due to the finite extent of the wavefunctions .",
    "the wavefunctions can tunnel across the strip when the width of the incompressible strip becomes comparable with the quantum mechanical length scales .",
    "these scales are set by the @xmath0 field such as the magnetic length ( width of the wavefunction ) and by the fermi wavelength , defining the thermodynamic length scale .",
    "note that , the mentioned length scales are of the same order in typical measurements with electron densities similar to @xmath43 @xmath44 ( corresponding to @xmath45 nm ) and at intermediate @xmath0 fields ( @xmath46 t , @xmath47 nm ) .",
    "the above vanishing of the incompressible strips also applies for the ceo sample , however , one should take care of boundary conditions imposed by the sharp edge .",
    "here , one can use the semi - classical quantization of the skipping orbits for an initial estimation of the collapse of incompressible strips .",
    "@xcite it is possible to show analytically that , the gapped regions between the levels are confined to an interval in the physical space , which is smaller than the magnetic length .",
    "hence , electrostatically it is not possible to have incompressible strips at sharp edges .",
    "in addition to these arguments , the numerical investigations show that there are no incompressible strips at all , if an infinite wall is considered at the edges of the sample .",
    "@xcite we will show this situation in the following , where we also perform quantum mechanical calculations using computational techniques .",
    "it is important to mention that , the spin generalized calculation schemes are available in the literature . in the early analytical calculations of dempsey",
    "et al ,  @xcite the effect of electron - electron interactions on spin polarization investigated , whereas zozoulenko and co - workers utilize the density functional approach to attack the similar problem .",
    "@xcite one can extend our above scheme to study the spin dependent behavior using these approaches .",
    "however , the important concepts of this paper do not require consideration of the spin degree of freedom , so the simpler spinless case will be addressed here .",
    "this section is devoted to investigate the effects of boundary conditions on the electronic distribution , considering the ceo sample .",
    "we solve the three dimensional poisson equation self - consistently , in the classical domain , where finite widths of the wavefunctions are not taken into account .",
    "the boundary conditions are defined purely by electrostatics and the 2degs are included to the calculations as 2d charged planes . here , we first assume vanishing temperature and zero @xmath0 field to obtain initial conditions . the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6]a shows a typical sample profile .",
    "we consider a crystal that is grown first in the @xmath8 direction ( i.e. [ 100 ] ) , then cleaved at @xmath48 nm and the new material is grown in the @xmath49 direction , [ 010 ] .",
    "note that the side gate resides at @xmath50 .",
    "the corresponding charge distribution and electrostatic potential profiles are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] , where different potentials are applied to the side gate .",
    "the top surface of the crystal is assumed to be pinned to the mid gap of gaas . as depicted in the schematic draw ,",
    "the system is delta doped by two silicon layers , which provide electrons for the quantum wells .",
    "the 3d poisson equation is solved by the 4@xmath51 order grid technique , where successive over relaxation is used for the iteration process .",
    "@xcite the potential and charge distributions of the parallel electron layer presents the expected sharp variation at the cleaved edge , for small positive ( solid line ) and negative ( broken line ) side - gate potentials . at a larger negative voltage ,",
    "the sharp features at the ceo edge is washed out ( dash - dotted line ) and the smooth edge is recovered . to compare the self - consistent density profiles with chklovskii distribution ( i.e. eq .",
    "[ eq : edensity ] ) , we also plot the the non self - consistent density profile in fig  [ fig : fig6]a ( thin solid line ) .",
    "one can clearly see that the chklovskii model fails to describe the calculated edge profile even under depletion .",
    "@xcite    once the density and potential profiles are known , it is somewhat easier to calculate the profiles at finite magnetic field . since",
    ", the density distribution is modified only at the incompressible regions and remains almost unchanged at compressible regions .",
    "indeed , one can estimate the widths and the spatial positions of the incompressible strips simply from eq .",
    "[ eq : edensity ] , using the electrostatic stability argument .",
    "nevertheless , for numerical calculations one starts with @xmath52 , @xmath53 profiles , increases the temperature , then adds the quantizing magnetic field via density of states and decreases the temperature step by step till the numerical accuracy is obtained .",
    "further details of the self - consistent calculation scheme can be found in the literature , which is applied successfully to systems that assume translational invariance in @xmath29 direction , considering single layers  @xcite , double layers  @xcite and actual 2d systems .",
    "@xcite this approach , is known as the screening theory and its predictions are confirmed experimentally .",
    "@xcite    the paramount outcome of the self - consistent calculations is that the 2deg separates into compressible strips separated by dipole strips , and that only in weak confining electric fields the dipole strips are wide enough to constitute incompressible strips .",
    "the existence of the incompressible strips at low - temperatures , strong magnetic fields and high mobility samples in the small - sample limit strongly depends on the boundary conditions .",
    "therefore , in what follows , we assume that the incompressible strip does not exist at the ceo edge , as supported by the above calculations and experiments which we discuss next . on the other hand ,",
    "the properties of the incompressible strips at the  soft \" edge and bulk is determined by disorder broadened landau levels together with temperature .",
    "in addition , our discussion on the effects of ceo edge is qualitatively independent of the properties of the soft edge , and self - consistent calculations are not necessary since the model for each edge is known from the above arguments .",
    "such calculations would be helpful for comparison only after a specific experimental geometry for the proposed ceo experiment is realized .",

    "the complementary transport calculations of screening theory assumes gaussian single impurity potentials ( i.e. disorder ) , as considered by t. ando and co - workers , within the self - consistent born approximation ( scba ) .",

    "since we are mainly interested in the transport properties of the incompressible strips , we confine our discussion to a situation , where the fermi energy ( or the electrochemical potential at finite temperatures and in the presence of an external current ) is in the single particle gap .",

    "are referred to as  edge states \" , and the contacts are assigned reflection and transmission coefficients for each incompressible strip .",
    "these contacts thus become the defining components of the single particle non - local conductance , where dissipation takes place due to equilibration .",
    "the next definition is that of a good ohmic contact , whose resistance is much smaller than the other measured resistances in the problem .",
    "explicitly , a non - ideal contact can still be ohmic , if the contact resistance remains below others resistance scales .",
    "once the contact resistance becomes dominant , then it is called a bad or non - ohmic contact .",
    "a detailed discussion on ideal / non - ideal and ohmic / non - ohmic contacts can be found in ref .  .",
    "early scanning probe experiments  @xcite and very recent comprehensive investigations  @xcite using various experimental methods show that there is a depleted electron density just in front of the metallic contacts .",
    "this density gradient induces finite scattering between the current channel(s ) and the contacts , yielding a non - ideal contact .",
    "despite the low electron density region , it is shown that state of art contacts are perfectly ohmic .",
    "@xcite it is only recently that , the self - consistent calculations by d. eksi _ et al _ could provide a quantitative description of the electron poor region in front of the contacts .",
    "@xcite this calculation scheme also presents the formation of compressible / incompressible strips in front of the contact .",
    "these non - ideal contact ideas are further supported in other recent theoretical investigations considering contacts .",
    "@xcite    here we phenomenologically investigate the edge to bulk transition of the iqhe considering a sample defined on a ceo crystal , considering both ideal and non - ideal ohmic contacts . following the discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec : exp ] , we repeat the simplified definition : if the properties of the incompressible strips are defined by the edge profile , this situation is called the edge iqhe or small - sample limit .",
    "whereas , if the incompressible strip or region resides at the bulk with conductance properties solely described by disorder , we call this situation the bulk iqhe or large - sample limit . for convenience",
    "we neglect the spin degree of freedom , since the effects we describe are universal , i.e. independent of whether landau or zeeman energies create the single - particle gap and subsequent incompressible strip .",
    "therefore we only deal with even - integer filling factors , i.e. @xmath79 .",
    "once the sample geometry is given , conductance properties will be determined by the electron distribution within the sample and near the contacts . in the case of ideal contacts",
    "it is assumed that there is no density gradient in the close vicinity of the contacts .",
    "therefore the incompressible strips are formed only due to the lateral confinement and are equilibrated with the contacts , without reflections .",
    "hence , scattering between the current contacts ( s , d ) and the incompressible strips is completely suppressed . as a first step we consider such ideal contacts at the ends of our sample .",
    "we depict the positions and the existences of incompressible strips considering four characteristic @xmath0 field in descending order , in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2]b - d . here",
    "we consider a generic sample , i.e. both edges are relatively smooth . at sufficiently high magnetic fields and neglecting correlation effects , the lowest landau level is partially occupied , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2]b .",
    "hence , the electronic system is completely compressible ( shown by color graded regions ) .",
    "consequently the global resistances @xmath1 , @xmath2 are both finite and excess current is distributed all over the sample , case i. the conductivities can be described by the drude model .",
    "@xcite the small deviations of the arrow directions from the electric field direction is to demonstrate the scattering processes .",
    "once the field is lowered , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2]c case ii , a large bulk incompressible region is formed and the excess current is confined to this region , where no ( back)scattering is present .",
    "hence , all arrows are directed along the applied current direction .",
    "the longitudinal resistances measured on both edges vanish and hall resistance is quantized .",
    "lowering the @xmath0 field results in formation of two edge incompressible strips ( case iii ) and once more the imposed current is confined to these strips , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2]d . at the lowest @xmath0 field considered here , the current is essentially confined to the _ evanescent _ of the incompressible strips as depicted in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig2]e .",
    "however , some of the current is also distributed to the bulk of the sample .",
    "the ratio of current flowing from the evanescent incompressible strips and bulk decreases while lowering the @xmath0 field and case i is recovered before the next filling factor plateau sets in .",
    "next , we consider the current distribution at a ceo sample considering the sharp edge on the rhs in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3]b - c . the cases i and ii remains unaffected by the sharp edge , therefore are not shown .",
    "in contrast to the smooth edge , the current distribution is strongly altered once the edge iqhe regime sets in , case iii and iv .",
    "the excess current is essentially confined to the left edge .",
    "the direct measurement of such a distinction between ceo and generic samples is possible via the scanning probe experiments .",
    "unfortunately , the experimental investigation of the electrochemical potential distribution at ceo samples is not available in the literature .",
    "despite this fact , one can trace the signature of such an asymmetry at the potential distributions , where one edge is etched and the opposing edge is gate defined .  @xcite one can see that , the potential distribution is symmetric if both edges are etched . whereas , if a contact resides on one edge , the potential distribution is smoother on this side .",
    "although , there is an evidence that the boundary conditions influence the electrochemical potential distribution , performing local probe experiments at ceo samples , will clarify our discussion .",
    "this is our first experimental proposal .",
    "alternately , one can also measure the global resistances at the ceo sample , and indirectly measure the differences between the generic sample and ceo sample .",
    "we expect ( almost ) no differences between the global resistances when comparing the generic and the ceo sample at the highest @xmath0 fields , case i and ii . for case i",
    ", the system is in a complete compressible state , hence , the external potential is almost perfectly screened and transport is determined by the metallic bulk . as a result , there is no apparent difference between the ceo and generic samples , when measuring the resistances .",
    "a similar argumentation also holds for case ii , in contrast to the previous case in this situation the transport properties are imposed by the bulk incompressible region , which is not affected by the boundary conditions , i.e. the longitudinal resistance vanishes for both systems @xmath80 . above arguments only hold for very high mobility samples , where no long - range potential fluctuations exists due to disorder .",
    "the situation remains unchanged for case iii , since the incompressible strip on the left side of the ceo sample still decouples opposing ( probe ) contacts .",
    "consider the case iv , where the edge incompressible strips at both samples become evanescent . in this case , the current distributions are effected by the edge profile . therefore the measured resistances differ at the lower edges of the plateau .",
    "this distinction is obliterated once case i is recovered , i.e. when the evanescent incompressible strips completely vanish .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] shows the expected @xmath2 ( thick solid line ) , @xmath81 ( thin broken line ) and @xmath82 ( thin solid line ) for the ceo sample .",
    "notice that , @xmath82 corresponds to the longitudinal resistance of a generic sample , meanwhile @xmath81 measures the transport at the ceo edge .",
    "this is an indirect way to measure the effect of different boundary conditions on transport .",
    "again , unfortunately , it is very difficult to deposit working contacts exactly on the top of ceo edge , experimentally .",
    "therefore , observing such a difference due to boundary conditions is obscured . as we will show below , the solution to this difficulty is hidden in the symmetry of the iqhe .",
    "we now will discuss dc current polarity effects for distinguishing the ceo edge from the generic case .",
    "let us first consider a generic sample , and impose a positive dc current such that the electrochemical potential looks like as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2]a .",
    "that is , the right side has a higher potential energy .",
    "once the current amplitude is increased , the left incompressible strip becomes narrower , due to the fact that there are more electrons on lhs to screen the external potential compared to equilibrium . another way to see",
    "this effect is to consider the electric field within the strip , on left side the total potential variation is @xmath83 and on the opposing side the variation is @xmath84 , where we assumed that the current is shared among the two incompressible strips equally . here",
    ", @xmath34 emanates from the equilibrium current .",
    "one can see from eq .",
    "[ eq : eldos ] that , at higher the electric fields the single particle gap becomes effectively smaller , hence , the gapped region is reduced .",
    "the transport consequence is that the incompressible strip width shrinks . on the opposing edge , the incompressible strip",
    "is enlarged to maintain electrostatic stability .",
    "once the current amplitude is sufficiently large the left incompressible strip collapses .",
    "a detailed calculation can be found in ref .. the effect described is a natural result of self - consistency and is predicted by numerical calculations .",
    "@xcite if we alter the current direction , the potential distribution will look the same , however , the opposing edges will be swapped , i.e. the left side will be elevated . thus there is no measurable dc polarity dependence on the global resistance in generic samples .",
    "@xcite nonetheless , dc polarity has an important influence in asymmetric samples such as the ceo samples .",
    "the explicit self - consistent calculations considering an asymmetric sample predict that the width of the magnetic field intervals in which iqhe is observed can be tuned by changing the current direction .",
    "@xcite this prediction is tested successfully at gated samples , however , tuning the visibility of the iqhe is limited to the non - linear transport regime .",
    "@xcite since , it is not possible to manipulate the edge steepness arbitrarily via gates .",
    "in contrast to gate defined hall bars , at ceo samples one side serves as an infinite wall , hence , one can tune the visibility of the iqhe in a wider experimental parameter window and more strikingly even at the linear transport regime . from experimental point of view , it is clear that performing such experiments is highly challenging and requires expertise regarding the ceo samples . at the moment ,",
    "the experimental difficulty is surpassed and preliminary results agree well with the theoretical predictions .",
    "@xcite    to sum up : in the case of ideal contacts we have seen that the bulk to edge transition can be measured with local probe experiments investigating the electrochemical potential profiles .",
    "however , one can not resolve the difference between the edge ( case iii ) and bulk ( case ii ) regimes of the quantized hall effect simply by measuring the global resistances .",
    "we expect to observe a difference only at the lower edge of the plateau regime .",
    "in addition , we proposed measurements of the global resistances at the ceo samples , imposing a dc current with opposite polarities to observe the influence of the boundary conditions on transport . to observe the different regimes of the qhe one can also consider non - ideal contacts and perform standard qhe measurements .",
    "we discuss this case in the following subsection .",
    "the essential difference between an ideal and non - ideal contact is the electron poor region in the close proximity of the contacts . as mentioned before ,",
    "recent experimental findings show that one can not model a contact simply by placing a metallic gate representing an equipotential on the surface .",
    "it was found that the contacts behave like fingers inserted to the 2deg , where fingers are metallic and the space between them are insulator like .",
    "@xcite as a consequence the 2deg is partially depleted from the contacts and a density gradient is formed in front of them .",
    "such a density gradient leads to decoupling of the incompressible strips from the contacts .",
    "we compare the spatial distribution of the incompressible strips and current distribution for cases ii and iii in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] , also taking into account the density gradient near the contacts .",
    "the left panel depicts a generic sample , whereas the right panel shows a ceo sample .",
    "different from the ideal contact situation , now the incompressible region ( case ii ) or strip ( case iii ) can only come near to the contact , whereas the region between the contact and incompressible region is compressible .",
    "this implies that scattering is finite and the transmission probability from a contact to the incompressible strip is no longer unity .",
    "remarkably , for the non - ideal contact at the ceo sample , some of the current can also be scattered to the bulk of the sample in case iii .",
    "the amount of bulk current is directly proportional to the quality of the contact .",
    "this scattered bulk current is re - collected by the incompressible strip at left , once the electrochemical equilibrium is restored .",
    "the longitudinal resistance at the left side is always zero due to the well developed incompressible strip .",
    "in contrast , one can still measure a finite @xmath1 on the right hand .",
    "interestingly , the hall resistance will deviate from its quantized value due to the small amount of bulk current , when measured between contacts a2 and b2 . whereas , if @xmath2 is measured between a1 and b1 it is quantized , since at this location all the current is now confined to the edge incompressible strip .",
    "such a behavior is not observed at a generic sample due to lateral symmetry . in addition , if the bulk is completely incompressible ( case ii ) , then the current is directly collected by the bulk region , for both samples .",
    "this difference between case ii and case iii , manifests the distinction between the bulk iqhe and the edge iqhe .",
    "the former is only determined by the bulk properties of the conductivity model , namely by disorder , and the latter is determined by boundary conditions . if both edges of our sample are defined by ceo , then one can only observe the bulk iqhe . by depositing metallic gates on both sides and varying the steepness of the edge",
    ", one should be able to tune the width of the iqhe plateaus by softening the sharp edges with negative gate biases .",
    "this is our third experimental proposal .",
    "in this section we consider only the non - ideal contact configuration , which is relevant for real experimental systems , and assume a clean sample without any long - range potential fluctuations in the small sample limit .",
    "recall that the effect of disorder is included to our model via the conductivity model we employ .",
    "the equilibration processes are investigated , based on the formation of incompressible strips .",
    "we support our arguments by the experiments that investigate the effects of incompressible strips on equilibration and decoupling of the system .",
    "@xcite the term , decoupling is used to express electrochemical and thermodynamical non - equilibrium , that is the electrons can not be redistributed easily due to the strip and have different electrochemical potentials on opposing edges .    here , we mention two different ways of breaking symmetry of the system , as set by the external @xmath0 field .",
    "this is different than the symmetry breaking effects due to current ( electric field ) , discussed before .",
    "first , we investigate hysteresis effects that can arise .",
    "we compare the decoupling properties of the edge incompressible strip with the bulk incompressible strip , hence , the bulk to edge iqhe transition .",
    "next , using the findings of experimental and theoretical investigations considering hot - spots , we alter the direction of the external magnetic field and seek for observable differences at transport .",
    "let us conceive an experiment for the generic sample , in which one starts from low fields and ends the measurement on an upsweep at a field such that the lowest landau level is partially occupied .",
    "in such a measurement the case sequence is iv - iii - ii - i .",
    "first the current is flowing from both sides along the evanescent incompressible strips and the system is compressible . at a higher field ( case iii )",
    "the system will develop edge incompressible strips , which decouple the bulk from the edges . in this case",
    ", the bulk electrons have a different electrochemical potential compared to edges .",
    "bulk is not accessible for the edge electrons and edge is not accessible for the bulk electrons . while increasing the @xmath0 field edge incompressible strips become wider to keep the electrostatic stability , until the bulk becomes completely incompressible ( case ii ) . here",
    ", the edges are decoupled by the bulk incompressible region .",
    "further increase of the field strength results in the disappearing of the bulk incompressible region , hence case i. if one now sweeps the field down , the opposite behavior is observed .",
    "the change of the sweep direction obviously has no influence on resistance measurements for the generic samples .",
    "instead , one can measure the equilibration process at generic samples by means of a single electron transistor ( set ) residing at the top surface .",
    "@xcite it is shown that the thermodynamic equilibration is hindered by the incompressible regions and magnetic field sweep direction induces a strong hysteresis on the local electrochemical potential distribution . at temperatures below 0.1 k , the relaxation time",
    "is reported to be as long as hours .",
    "similar observations of a strong hysteresis at the resistances of the passive layer is reported for the bilayer systems  @xcite and is elucidated by self - consistent screening calculations .",
    "@xcite    now let us consider the ceo sample , where only one incompressible strip resides at the left edge .",
    "the compressible bulk is accessible for electrons to restore equilibrium , due to the absence of right strip .",
    "therefore , while sweeping up equilibrium can be achieved easily , however , while sweeping down the bulk incompressible region hinders the equilibration . to be explicit , during down sweep the bulk incompressible region freezes the potential landscape and equilibration is suppressed .",
    "turned around , once the bulk incompressible region is formed it stays for large @xmath0 intervals . at the opposite sweep direction one starts with a narrow incompressible strip at left edge , which can not effectively decouple bulk , therefore the potential landscape is not frozen for large @xmath0 intervals .",
    "it is apparent that , sweep direction has an influence on the equilibration process .",
    "consequently , down sweep presents a larger iqhe ( i.e bulk and edge together ) , whereas up - sweep only shows the edge iqhe .",
    "this induces different paths for the longitudinal resistance , when sweeping up or down , namely a hysteresis .",
    "in addition , the visibility of this hysteresis strongly depends on the potential profile at the bulk , hence the role of long - range fluctuations has to be taken into account .",
    "such a potential freezing model is applied to the bilayer system and the observed hysteresis is elucidated .",
    "@xcite there the effect of long - range fluctuations is also examined in detail , showing that the visibility of hysteresis is enhanced if the system has sufficiently strong long - range potential fluctuations .",
    "it is also discussed that , if the sample is large the edge effects are suppressed completely . as a simple test , one can erase the memory of the system by warming up the sample during down - sweep , at the hysteresis interval .",
    "the warming process will melt the bulk incompressible region , therefore the system comes to an equilibrium state .",
    "afterwards one can measure the @xmath1 and check if it is still in the iqhe regime .",
    "such a test is done at the bilayer systems and it is observed that the hysteresis vanishes , similar to what we would expect for the ceo samples .",
    "note that , for an ideal contact one incompressible strip is sufficient to decouple opposing edges , and sweep direction is not important .",
    "however , we propose that the visibility of the hysteresis should also depend on the quality of the non - ideal contact . to be explicit ,",
    "if the contact approximates to an ideal contact the hysteresis should disappear .",
    "the other interesting symmetry breaking is due to the formation of the _ hot - spots _ , known for a while experimentally  @xcite and is also calculated recently .",
    "@xcite the hot spot is either on the left or right bottom near the injection contact depending on the field direction . at the drain contact",
    "it is located on the diagonal corner .",
    "@xcite it is apparent that , the formation of hot - spots have no influence on the resistances measured far from the contacts at a generic sample .",
    "remarkably , at a ceo sample the location of hot - spots alter the equilibration process of the excess current .",
    "consider fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5]d , if @xmath0 field is directed along the positive @xmath8 axis the hot - spot is at the right bottom corner of the sample .",
    "hence , some of the excess current can be scattered to the bulk compressible region , resulting in deviations from the quantized hall resistance if it is measured using contacts a2-b2 .",
    "correlatively , the @xmath1 is finite on the right side .",
    "this situation is already discussed in the previous section .",
    "next we alter the @xmath0 field orientation to negative @xmath8 direction , then the hot - spot will form on the left - bottom corner of the sample . consequently",
    ", the excess current is directly confined to the left incompressible strip .",
    "hence , @xmath85 is quantized and @xmath86 vanishes .",
    "this behavior has implications on the hysteresis discussed above , since the equilibration process is also effected .",
    "our model predicts that if a hysteresis is observed at the ceo sample , the different paths should alternate depending on the field direction , since the location of the hot - spots will also be altered and current injection process will be strongly effected .",
    "in this work we investigated the effects of a sharp boundary on the transport properties and the electrochemical potential distribution of a cleaved edge overgrown sample .",
    "first , we re - introduced the calculation scheme to obtain electron and potential distributions , starting from analytical electrostatic formulation and extended our discussion to self - consistent calculation scheme .",
    "the effects of boundaries , together with interactions , on the formation of incompressible strips are discussed based on the literature and supported by self - consistent calculations .",
    "we showed that the incompressible strip does not exist at the sharp edge , agreeing with previous calculations and experiments . in the next step",
    "we summarized the essential findings of two set of experiments relevant to our discussions on the electrochemical potential distribution at narrow samples and regarding the cleaved edge overgrown samples .",
    "the basis of the complementary transport calculations of the screening theory is briefly re - introduced in section  [ sec : ohmslaw ] .",
    "equipped with the theoretical and experimental findings , we investigated the current distribution comparing generic and cleaved edge overgrown samples .",
    "we considered ideal and non - ideal contacts , together with the influence of current direction on the global resistances . in section .",
    "[ sec : other ] , the effects of sweep direction and @xmath0 field orientation is discussed .",
    "several experimental predictions emanated through our discussions due to the sharp edge , which can be summarized as :    * at local probe experiments , one can not observe a electrochemical potential drop at the sharp edge . *",
    "the visibility of the iqhe should be tuned by imposing dc currents in different directions , under same experimental conditions . * if both sides of the hall bar are defined by sharp edges , only the bulk iqhe can be observed .",
    "in addition we predict that by making the edge smoother plateaus should be extended .",
    "* we predict that , at the edge iqhe regime equilibration processes are promoted due to the absence of the incompressible strip at the sharp edge and are suppressed at the bulk iqhe regime by the virtue of large incompressible region at the bulk .",
    "hence , sweeping the magnetic field direction should induce a hysteresis on global resistances , which is strongly effected by the long - range fluctuations and contact quality . *",
    "altering the orientation of the @xmath0 field also alters the spatial locations of the hot - spots , therefore , altering the field orientation should strongly affect the hysteresis .",
    "once the sharp edge behaves like a hard - wall potential , the one - dimensional edge channels proposed by halperin  @xcite and bttiker  @xcite should form and the edge profile should not be important .",
    "this seems to be the case for equilibrium , namely when there is no external current .",
    "however , the screening theory states that if the width of the incompressible edge strip becomes narrower than few magnetic lengths , scattering is promoted . in the case of an external current",
    "the incompressible strip collapses , if one analytically calculates the effect of local electric fields on the local density of states .",
    "if the incompressible strip vanishes , then the longitudinal resistance becomes finite .",
    "hence , the integer quantized hall effect disappears .    as a final remark , recently similar asymmetries of the quantized hall and the longitudinal resistances",
    "were reported both experimentally  @xcite and theoretically ,  @xcite which are all attributed to the direct coulomb interaction . in ref .  , it is predicted that due to the non - linear effects induced by the imposed large current the widths of the incompressible strips are enhanced ( or reduced ) , which we believe can be exploited in magnifying the asymmetrical behaviors we have discussed .",
