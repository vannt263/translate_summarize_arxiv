    "hypernuclear production in reactions between heavy nuclei was first theoretically proposed by kerman and weiss @xcite .",
    "they found that relativistic heavy ion collisions ( rhic ) offer the best possibility to create exotic finite nuclear system with finite strangeness .",
    "however , the experimental results have so far been rather limited due to short lifetime of hypernuclei @xcite , which impedes their detection . since the mechanism of the heavy ion induced hypernuclear reaction is not well understood , this field of research attracted mainly theoretical interest , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the future experimental projects as planned at the facility for anti - protons and ion research ( gsi - fair , germany ) @xcite and the nuclotron - based ion collider facility ( nica ) , at joint institute for nuclear research ( jinr ) , dubna , russia @xcite , aim to look for light proton / neutron rich exotic hypernuclei , and to extend their study to heavier hypernuclei ( which can be produced only in rhic ) , toward protons and neutron drip lines .",
    "in addition , there are special light hypernuclei of interest , whose properties are dictated by their unusual structure @xcite , e.g. , nuclei with the hyperon halo ( @xmath6h ) ; neutron - rich hypernuclei ; nuclei with an unstable core , where the hyperon is a sort of `` _ glue _ '' ensuring stability ( @xmath4h , @xmath4he , @xmath7he ) .",
    "recently at rhic bnl ( relativistic heavy ion collider at brookhaven national laboratory ) the observation of ( anti)hypertritons has been reported in nuclear collisions @xcite,@xcite .    the research program at the sps cern - geneva ( super proton synchroton at european organization for nuclear research ) and at rhic bnl will cover the energy range @xmath3 = 5 - 50 gev from below up to well above the energy of the onset of deconfinement ( expected approximately at @xmath3 = 6 - 8 gev ) .",
    "moreover , hyphi - collaboration @xcite and the project multi - purpose detector ( mpd / nica ) @xcite will cover the relevant energies @xmath3 = 2.7 - 9.4 gev .",
    "these experiments aim to measure the production of hypernuclei in energetic collisions between light nuclei , since their identification via the weak decay of the hyperon into pion is much easier for such systems .    in this paper",
    "a hybrid model based on participant - spectator picture and combined with canonical thermodynamic ( ctm ) model is used to determine , in high energy heavy - ion collisions , the probability of forming a hypernucleus and to estimate its production cross section . for rhic in 3 - 10 gev energy range the following scenario ( supported by experiments ) applies . for a general impact parameter",
    "there is a region of violent collision called the participating region .",
    "in addition , there is a mildly excited projectile like fragment ( plf ) and also a mildly excited target like fragment ( tlf ) .",
    "physics of both plf and tlf are similar for symmetric collisions ; here we concentrate our analysis on plf . because of excitation energy ( usually characterized by a temperature , @xmath8 ) plf will break up into many fragments and the velocities of these fragments are centered around the velocity of the projectile . in fixed target experiments they are emitted in a forward cone and are more easily recognizable . in the participating region , apart from original neutrons and protons , others particles ( pions , kaons , @xmath0 s , etc . ) are produced .",
    "the produced @xmath0 particles have an extended rapidity range .",
    "those produced in the rapidity range close to that of the projectile and having total momenta in the plf frame up to fermi momentum ( @xmath9 mev / c ) can be trapped in the plf and form hypernuclei .",
    "the present problem has also been analyzed previously ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) at lower @xmath3 energies ( @xmath3 = 2.7 - 3.1 gev ) .",
    "this work is in a similar spirit but at higher c.m .",
    "energy and uses different models for ( a ) @xmath0 particles production in the participant region taking into consideration impact parameter dependence of the specific collision and ( b ) attachment of the @xmath0 particle to different fragments in the plf forming what we refer here as composite .",
    "it is felt that in view of the future experimental activities @xcite the results from alternative models , and at different energies , will help to better establish the mechanism for formation of hypernuclei .",
    "our calculations are performed in two separate stages . for a given impact parameter ( @xmath10 ) a large number of events ( @xmath11 ) are generated with hijing / bb model in order to obtain the average number of @xmath0 particles per event ( @xmath12 ) within appropriate kinematic cuts in rapidity and momentum . within the model",
    "we can also calculate the average number of the nucleons in the plf , @xmath13 = @xmath14 , where @xmath15 stands for neutrons , and @xmath16 for protons .",
    "we can characterize a produced composite ( with and without strangeness ) by three symbols : @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where @xmath17 is the atomic mass , @xmath18 is the charge value of the isotope , and @xmath19 refers to the number of hyperons embedded into the nucleus ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) . for @xmath19 =",
    "0 we have normal composites . for @xmath19",
    "= 1 we have a hypernucleus with one @xmath0 .",
    "it is also possible to include the case @xmath19 = 2 ( i.e. , @xmath20 ) .",
    "similarly it is possible to include other kinds of hyperons , i.e. , @xmath21 .",
    "however , this is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "calculations using canonical thermodynamic model ( ctm ) @xcite are performed in the second stage to estimate the average number ( @xmath22 ) of hypernuclei ( @xmath23z ) produced at a given temperature @xmath8 , when the plf has one @xmath0 , and the average number of nucleons @xmath13",
    "= @xmath14 .",
    "there are two major approximations in our approach : ( i ) the time dependence of source function for hyperons and fragments has been neglected ; ( ii ) we neglect also secondary hypernuclear processes .",
    "the transport calculations predict only moderate contributions @xcite to the total hyper - fragment cross section from indirect coalescence through the @xmath24 channel ( where b stands for a baryon and @xmath25 for a pion ) . with these assumptions ,",
    "the formation cross section of a hypernucleus in the plf rest system can be expressed by :    @xmath26    the basic outline and main parameters of hijing / bb model are presented in sec .",
    "we employ reasonable theoretical evaluations for the @xmath0 particle production with specific kinematic cuts . in sec .",
    "iii we give details of ctm calculations . the results and the discussions",
    "are presented in sec .",
    "the final conclusions are summarized in sec .",
    "the hijing @xcite and hijing / bb v1.10 models @xcite have been used extensively to determine the physical properties of the matter produced in rhic and to study particle production .",
    "string models describe the collisions through the exchange of color or momentum between partons in the projectile and target . as a consequence of these exchanges ,",
    "these partons become joined by colorless objects , which are called string , ropes or flux tubes . in hijing type models @xcite the soft beam jet fragmentation",
    "is modeled by diquark - quark strings with gluon kinks induced by soft gluon radiations .",
    "hard collisions are included within perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) computed parton - parton collisions .",
    "the mini - jets physics is embedded via an eikonal multiple collision framework using pqcd to compute the initial and final state radiation and hard scattering rates .",
    "the cross section for hard parton scatterings is enhanced by a factor k=2 in order to simulate high order corrections .",
    "the hijing model was originally designed for hadron - hadron interactions .",
    "generalization to hadron - nucleus ( @xmath27 ) and nucleus - nucleus ( @xmath28 ) collisions is performed @xcite through the glauber theory . besides the glauber nuclear eikonal extension , shadowing of nuclear parton distributions is modeled .",
    "in addition , dynamical energy loss of the ( mini)jets is taken into account through an effective de / dx ( approximately 2 gev / fm per gluon mini - jet ) .",
    "these models contain a _ soft _ and a _ hard _ component , which is crucial for their application from fair to large hadron collider ( lhc ) energies .",
    "unlike conventional di - quark fragmentation implemented in hijing model @xcite , a baryon junction allows the di - quark to split with the three independent flux lines tied together at a junction in hijing / bb v1.10 @xcite .",
    "we introduce @xcite a new version ( v2.0 ) of hijing / bb that differs from hijing / bb v1.10 @xcite in its implementation of hypothesized junction anti - junction ( jj ) loops .",
    "a picture of a junction loop is as follows : a color flux line splits at some intermediate point into two flux line at one junction and then the flux line fuse back into one at a second anti - junction somewhere further along the original flux line . before fragmentation",
    ", we compute the probability that a junction loop occurs in the string .",
    "the probability of such loop is assumed to increase with the number of binary interactions that the incident baryon suffers in passing through the oncoming nucleus @xcite .",
    "this number depends on the impact parameter and is computed in hijing using eikonal path through a diffuse nuclear density .",
    "moreover , we add an enhanced intrinsic ( anti)di - quark @xmath29 kick in any standard ( q - qq ) strings that should contain one or multiple jj loops .",
    "this mechanism correspond to some degree of _ collectivity _ for parton interactions .    in string fragmentation phenomenology",
    ", it has been proposed that the strong enhancement of strange particle observables require strong color field ( scf ) effects @xcite .",
    "the particle production is large and dominated by pair production and the energy density appears to exceed the one required for quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) formation .",
    "the overall scenario is consistent with particle production from a strong color field ( scf ) , formation of a qgp and subsequent hadronization .",
    "the scf effects are also possible source of novel _ baryon / hyperon physics_. in our previous works @xcite , we explore with hijing / bb v2.0 model calculations , possible dynamical effects associated with long - range coherent field ( scf ) , that may arise in rhic . these analysis point to the _ need for collective motion _ , together with _ high initial - state energy densities_.    for a uniform chromoelectric flux tube with field ( _ e _ ) the pair production rate @xcite per unit volume for a heavy quark",
    "is given by : @xmath30 where for strange quark @xmath31 , the current quark mass is in the range of @xmath32 mev and the constituent quark mass @xmath33 mev ( for detailed discussion see ref .",
    "note that @xmath34 is the effective string tension in terms of the vacuum string tension @xmath35 gev / fm and @xmath36 , @xmath37 are the second order casimir operators ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . a measurable rate for spontaneous pair production requires `` _ strong chromo electric fields _ '' , such that @xmath38 1 _ at least some of the time_. on the average , longitudinal electric field `` string '' models predict for heavier flavor a very suppressed production rate per unit volume @xmath39 via the well known schwinger formula @xcite , since @xmath40 for @xmath31 and @xmath41 . for a color rope on the other hand , if the _",
    "average _ string tension value ( @xmath42 ) increases from 1.0 gev / fm to 2.0 - 3.0 gev / fm , the rate @xmath43 for strangeness pairs to tunnel through the longitudinal field increases ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we take into account scf in our model by an _ in medium effective string tension _",
    "@xmath44 , which lead to new values for the suppression factors , as well as the new effective intrinsic transverse momentum @xmath45 .",
    "this includes : i ) the ratio of production rates of di - quark to quark pairs ( di - quark suppression factor ) , @xmath46 , ii ) the ratio of production rates of strange to non - strange quark pairs ( strangeness suppression factor ) , @xmath47 , iii ) the extra suppression associated with a diquark containing a strange quark compared to the normal suppression of strange quark ( @xmath48 ) , @xmath49 , iv ) the suppression of spin 1 diquarks relative to spin 0 ones ( apart from the factor of 3 enhancement of the former based on counting the number of spin states ) , @xmath50 , and v ) the ( anti)quark ( @xmath51 ) and ( anti)di - quark ( @xmath52 ) gaussian width .    in this paper",
    "we extend our study in the framework of hijing / bb v2.0 model @xcite to strange particle production at the fair and mpd / nica energy range ( @xmath3 = 2.7 - 9.4 gev ) .",
    "the experimental situation has so far been rather poor for measurements of strange particles at forward rapidities , due to limited acceptances of the detectors . the very forward rapidity ( closer to projectile rapidity )",
    "are dealt with by models only .",
    "using hijing / bb v2.0 model we analyze the production of the average value per event @xmath12 with specific kinematic cuts in rapidity @xmath53 , ( where @xmath54 stands for projectile rapidity ) and total momentum @xmath9 mev / c in the plf rest system , which can leads to the formation of hypernucleus in rhic .",
    "the main parameters used in the calculations presented here are given in table [ tab : tab1 ] .",
    ".main parameters used in symmetric @xmath55 collisions .",
    "the parameters are defined in the text .",
    "set 1 correspond to calculations without jj loops and scf effects . set 2 and 3 include both effects and correspond to different mean values of the string tension . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : tab3 ]    our results are different from those reported within the coalescence model @xcite which was used often to estimate cross sections for hypernucleus formation in the plf . only for few isotopes ( e.g.,@xmath56he , @xmath7li,@xmath7be ) we obtain inclusive cross sections slightly different in comparison with those predicted by the coalescence model .",
    "it is worthwhile to highlight the important differences .    to understand the basic idea of the coalescence model , let us begin by first considering a plf without a hyperon .",
    "it is excited ( usually parametrized by a temperature ) and breaks up ( as is well established experimentally ) into many fragments .",
    "the distribution of these fragments ( @xmath57 ) in the plf can be denoted by @xmath58 .",
    "usually this distribution is not calculated in the coalescence model for hypernucleus formation although in some version of the coalescence this could be attempted . in principle , this distribution should be taken from experiment . in the present problem",
    ", we have , in addition , a @xmath0 particle with a momentum distribution .",
    "if the velocity of the fragment @xmath59 and the velocity of the @xmath0 particle , @xmath60 match they can coalesce into a hypernucleus .",
    "thus the cross - section is given by the product of two distributions and an overlap factor which gives the probability that the @xmath0 and @xmath57 becomes the hypernucleus @xmath61 ( see eq . 15 in ref .",
    "@xcite and eq . 11 in ref .",
    "note that the @xmath0 plays a very passive role here .",
    "practitioners of the coalescence model suggested that @xmath62 has to be taken from experiment . in the past applications of the coalescence model , experimental values of @xmath63",
    "were not used as not all of those needed for predicting hypernucleus production were experimentally available .",
    "a theoretical model parametrisation for @xmath63 had to be employed .",
    "these parameterizations give ( wrongly ) finite values for inclusive cross - sections of @xmath64he and @xmath65be nuclei and hence finite values for inclusive cross - sections formation for both @xmath4he and @xmath5be .",
    "but this is fortuitous , since @xmath64he and @xmath65be nuclei are not bound systems by themselves @xcite .",
    "however , calculations based on a generalized mass formula for non - strange and hypernuclei predict the existence of several bound hypernuclei ( e.g.,@xmath4he and @xmath5be ) whose normal cores are unbound @xcite .    ) in @xmath66c + @xmath66c collisions at @xmath3 = 3.7 gev as a function of nuclear fragment mass number @xmath67 .",
    "the results ( open symbols ) are shown for h , he , li and be isotopes and are obtained for t = 5 mev ( left panel ) and t = 8 mev ( right panel ) .",
    "the lines are only to guide the eyes.,width=336,height=168 ]    these remarks lead to some features which are experimentally verifiable . for example ,",
    "correct application of coalescence principles should gives zero cross section for @xmath4he and @xmath5be isotopes , since these require separately a @xmath64he nucleus and a @xmath0 or a @xmath65be nucleus and a @xmath0 .",
    "the extra role the @xmath0 play as `` glue '' ensuring stability , can not be incorporated in the coalescence model .",
    "in contrast in ctm model the @xmath0 plays a more fundamental role than in coalescence .",
    "it participates in the thermalization .",
    "the ctm model uses directly the property of @xmath68f rather than that of @xmath57 and @xmath0 separately .",
    "thus both @xmath4he and @xmath5be are expected to have non - zero production cross sections .",
    "in fact , we predict a large cross section for @xmath5be .",
    "the values obtained within our phenomenology are also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](a ) ( t = 5 mev ) and in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](b ) ( t = 8 mev ) .",
    "note that the high value reported here for isotope @xmath69li ( on dashed lines ) could be explained by many low - lying bound states of this isotope , which all contribute in the calculation of the partition function , @xmath70 .",
    "in collisions between heavy nuclei we expect an increase of the production rate of strangeness ( see table [ tab : tab2 ] in sec .",
    "ii ) and of secondary interactions . in this case",
    "the temporal distribution of the fragment and @xmath0 particle could play an important role and the reduction factors of about 0.5 was estimated with coalescence model @xcite for @xmath71ne + @xmath71ne at @xmath3 = 3.1 gev .",
    "our results have been obtained by neglecting the above time dependence for @xmath71ne + @xmath71ne and @xmath72ar + @xmath72ar collisions at @xmath3 = 5 gev .",
    "therefore , these values should be considered only as upper bounds for formation cross sections of hypernuclei .",
    "the predictions obtained within our hybrid model are shown through graphs in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] ( left panel , @xmath8 = 5 mev ) and ( right panel , @xmath8 = 8 mev ) .",
    "ne + @xmath71ne collisions at @xmath3 = 5 gev .",
    "the open symbols and the lines have the same meaning as in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2].,width=336,height=168 ]    ar + @xmath72ar collisions at @xmath3 = 5 gev .",
    "the open symbols and the lines have the same meaning as in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2].,width=336,height=168 ]    the ar + ar system is twice as big as ne + ne ( the total number of 80 nucleons versus 40 ) . if we consider the results obtained for li isotopes with @xmath8 = 5 mev ( left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] ) , the graphs show that the hypernuclei formation cross sections are in ar + ar system approximately twice than those obtained in ne + ne system . in contrast , the production of @xmath5be is about the same in both .",
    "one common feature of all three graphs ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] ) is that , the cross section for formation of @xmath5be is large and is an order of magnitude higher than those predicted within coalescence model and this prediction should be easily verified by future experiments planed at fair and mpd / nica .",
    "finally , we note that the previous experimental data for the production cross sections of @xmath56h and @xmath6h hypernuclei @xcite have been obtained with very light beams ( he , li ) at 3.7a gev ( laboratory system ) on carbon fixed target .",
    "we can not study using our approach these light colliding systems , since they are out of the limit of applicability within our phenomenology . to compare our predictions for formation cross sections of hypernuclei ,",
    "data obtained with heavier beams ( targets ) and at higher energies are needed .",
    "we have estimated the inclusive production cross - sections of selected light hypernuclei in the symmetric colliding systems ( c + c , ne + ne , ar + ar ) using a hybrid type model .",
    "the calculations are performed considering a product of two factors in impact parameter space ( see eq .",
    "1 ) . the first factor the average value per event , @xmath12 , estimates the production of @xmath0 particles in the participant region within a limiting phase space . imposing reasonable kinematic cuts these particles could be captured in plf .",
    "the second factor , @xmath22 , describes how these hyperons distribute them - self among the different hypernuclei within ctm approach .",
    "the absolute values of cross - sections are basically dependent upon the first part ; the relative values are fixed by the canonical thermodynamic model ( ctm ) .",
    "when data will become available , these can separately test the validity and accuracy of each part .    in comparison with previous predictions within coalescence models ,",
    "our results show a striking difference especially for @xmath4he and @xmath5be hypernuclei .",
    "a correct application of the coalescence principles should gives zero production cross sections for these isotopes .",
    "in contrast , our hybrid model predict a formation cross sections which are significantly larger than those reported with coalescence calculations",
    ".    moreover , our approach for the production of hypernuclei in rhic also applies with appropriate changes in rapidity and momentum cuts , to asymmetric colliding systems .",
    "however , to better test our predictions , experimental data obtained with heavier beams ( target ) and in the energy region of interest @xmath3 = 5 - 10 gev are required .",
