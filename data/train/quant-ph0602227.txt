    "various studies have been made of quantum mechanics by using trajectories .",
    "for example , in feynman s path integral method , the transition amplitude between the initial and final points is calculated by adding all the phase factors determined from the trajectories connecting these points [ 1 ] . in this case",
    ", the trajectories are interfering alternatives and not those of observed particles .",
    "the method proposed by bohm is another example . in this method ,",
    "the trajectories are treated as if they were observed and are calculated deterministically [ 2 ] .",
    "these methods give alternative formulations of quantum mechanics .",
    "the stochastic approach is another method .",
    "it is used not only for the formulation of quantum mechanics , but also for practical calculations .",
    "the use of a stochastic method for practical calculations is generally called the quantum monte carlo method ( qmc ) and is widely used in the simulation of quantum systems . typical algorithms in the qmc are the random walk monte carlo method ( rwmc ) , the diffusion monte carlo method ( dmc ) , and the path integral monte carlo method ( pimc ) .",
    "these methods are efficient ways of determining the wave function and energy of a ground state [ 3,4 ] .",
    "they are based on the formal analogy that the schrdinger equation becomes the diffusion equation when @xmath2 is substituted by an imaginary time @xmath3 .",
    "a solution of the diffusion equation can be constructed using brownian motion .",
    "we can generate sample paths of brownian particles by a random number generator and can follow the paths independently as brownian motion is a stationary markov process , which means that the diffusion equation can be solved by a stochastic method using a random number generator .",
    "many studies have been conducted on the diffusion equation and brownian motion .",
    "it is known that a stochastic estimation is generally more efficient than direct calculations when the system has many degrees of freedom . in direct methods ,",
    "the amount of calculation required generally increases exponentially with the number of degrees of freedom @xmath4 [ 5 ] . on the other hand , for stochastic methods the amount of calculation",
    "is of order @xmath4 for one trial , though the estimated error is of order @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the number of trials .",
    "very naively , the schrdinger equation is a diffusion equation along an imaginary time axis .",
    "however , the quantum stationary markov process for the schrdinger equation , which corresponds to brownian motion for the diffusion equation , has not yet been established .",
    "formulating an analogous process to brownian motion in quantum mechanics would be useful for estimating the time development of wave functions , especially in higher degrees of freedom .",
    "because of the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics , several stochastic formulations of quantum mechanics have been investigated [ 6,7 ] .",
    "a typical example of such a stochastic process was formulated by nelson in 1966 [ 6 ] . in this method ,",
    "the behavior of the constituent particles is determined by a stochastic differential equation and their distribution function coincides with the absolute square of the wave function . in this sense , the trajectories in this method are those of the observed particles .",
    "we can apply this method to estimate the tunneling time by making simulations of the trajectories [ 8 ] .",
    "however , the drift term in the stochastic equation is calculated from the wave function , and hence the schrdinger equation must be solved to construct the process . a general method to construct a stochastic process without solving the schrdinger equation",
    "was developed by guerra and marra [ 9 ] . in their method",
    ", the total distribution of particles is required to determine the next step of a constituent particle , though obtained process is a markov process .",
    "it is possible to determine the time evolution of all particles simultaneously , but each individual particle can not be treated independently .",
    "these methods treat the distribution function directly , i.e. the absolute square of a wave function .    a way to avoid this difficulty is to search for a stochastic process for the time evolution equations which are equivalent to the schrdinger equation .",
    "one such equation is the quantum liouville equation for the wigner function . in this paper",
    ", we discuss a stationary quantum stochastic process for the wigner function in a lattice phase space .",
    "a similar approach was considered by cohendet et al . [",
    "they constructed the wigner function on a lattice constituting of an odd number of lattice points , and found a background quantum markov process .",
    "the wigner function is defined by wigner as    @xmath7    in phase space , where @xmath8 is a wave function [ 11,12 ] .",
    "the wigner function gives the density distribution in the configuration space if it is integrated along the momentum direction :    @xmath9    and gives the density distribution in the momentum space if integrated along the configuration direction :    @xmath10    this property is the so  called marginality of the wigner function . in this sense",
    ", the wigner function can be regarded as a kind of _ distribution function _ in phase space and plays an important role in quantum mechanics , especially in the quantum  classical correspondence .",
    "however , the value of the wigner function can be negative , so that it is not a distribution function itself .",
    "cohendet et al . regarded a lattice with odd @xmath1 lattice points as a cyclic group @xmath11 of order @xmath1 and constructed a wigner function in the lattice phase space @xmath0 , i.e. the direct product of @xmath11 and its dual @xmath12 ) .",
    "the wigner function can also be negative on a finite lattice , but the value is bounded .",
    "they extended the phase space @xmath0 by a dichotomic variable @xmath13 of value @xmath14 and considered a new function on the extended space adding a constant to the wigner function .",
    "the function is normalized and positive as the original function is bounded , so it can be regarded as a distribution function of particles in the new space .",
    "they derived the time evolution equation for the distribution function from the quantum liouville equation , which determines the time evolution of the wigner function , and constructed the background stochastic process of the particles using the guerra ",
    "marra method .",
    "although the obtained process has a markov property , the whole distribution function is required to determine the evolution of a constituent particle .",
    "the transition probability is time dependent and not stationary .    in this paper",
    "we introduce a stationary markov process that enables us to treat all particles independently , by extending the phase space by a phase factor @xmath15 on an odd lattice .",
    "the process has branching and vanishing points and a finite time interval can be maintained between the branchings .",
    "let @xmath1 be an odd number .",
    "we define @xmath16 phase and shift matrices @xmath17 as    @xmath18    @xmath19    where @xmath20 and are labeled from @xmath21 to @xmath22 with step -1 , @xmath23 is the kronecker delta function modulo @xmath1 , @xmath24 is a primitive @xmath1-th root of unity , e.g. @xmath25 .",
    "the matrices @xmath17 correspond to the phase and shift operators    @xmath26    respectively , in continuous space ",
    "time , where @xmath27 is a lattice constant .",

    "we call the coefficients that appear in the weyl and fano expansions the weyl and fano coefficients , respectively .    in the continuous case ,",

    "let @xmath47 be the weyl coefficients of the hamiltonian ,    @xmath48    and @xmath49 be the fano coefficients of the density matrix , i.e. the winger function ,    @xmath50    the quantum liouville equation    @xmath51\\ ] ]    can be written using these coefficients as    @xmath52 @xmath53    we modify the equation as follows for later convenience .",
    "we perform a polar decomposition of the weyl coefficients of the hamiltonian :    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is 0 from the hermiticity of the hamiltonian .",
    "the time evolution equation for the wigner function ( 20 ) can be rewritten by this decomposition as follows :    @xmath56 @xmath57    the term in the right - hand side equals zero when @xmath58 , so that it can be omitted in the sum .",
    "we extend the phase space @xmath0 with phase factor @xmath15 and consider a non negative function @xmath60 on @xmath61 that has the following relation with the wigner function :    @xmath62    since the wigner function is bounded in modulus by @xmath63 on a lattice @xmath64 the function @xmath60 exists , although it is not uniquely determined .",

    "the generator of a markov process + @xmath93 is generally defined by    @xmath94    the generator corresponding to @xmath68 is given by    @xmath95 @xmath96 @xmath97 @xmath98    this generator is singular at @xmath99 .",
    "these singularities come from the fact that when we set    @xmath100    in eq .",
