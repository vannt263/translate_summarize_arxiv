    "at energies below the electroweak scale the weak interactions are described by local four - fermi operators multiplied by effective coupling constants , the wilson coefficients . the formal framework to achieve this is the operator product expansion ( ope ) which allows one to separate the calculation of a physical amplitude into two distinct parts : the short distance ( perturbative ) calculation of the wilson coefficients and the long distance ( generally non - perturbative ) calculation of the hadronic matrix elements of the operators @xmath11 .",
    "we calculate on the lattice @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "this allows us to calculate the low energy constants in chiral perturbation @xcite which , after incorporating the non - perturbative renormalization factors are then translated into @xmath12 matrix elements .",
    "the cp - pacs collaboration has also presented a very similar calculation at this meeting @xcite .",
    "we have used the wilson gauge action , quenched , at @xmath7 on a @xmath13 lattice which corresponds to an inverse lattice spacing @xmath14 . the domain wall fermion height @xmath8 and fifth dimension @xmath15 give a residual symmetry breaking @xmath16 @xcite ; 400 configurations separated by 10000 heat - bath sweeps were used in this analysis .",
    "@xmath0 matrix elements were calculated in the @xmath17 limit for 5 light quark masses @xmath18 .",
    "since the @xmath1 matrix elements vanish in the @xmath19 limit these matrix elements were calculated with non - degenerate quark propagators for 10 mass combinations subject to the constraint @xmath20 .",
    "we have also calculated the so called eye diagrams with an active charm quark for @xmath21 ( the physical charm quark is around 0.5 ) . however ,",
    "the analysis for charm - in is still in progress ; in this presentation we concentrate on the case with 3-active flavors wherein charm is integrated out assuming it is very heavy .",
    "the calculation took about 4 months on 800 gflops ( peak ) .",
    "quark propagators were calculated using the conjugate gradient method with a stopping residual of @xmath22 with periodic and anti - periodic boundary conditions which amounts to doubling the lattice size in time direction .",
    "the two wall source propagators at @xmath23 and @xmath24 were fixed to coulomb gauge . for eye diagrams we employed random wall sources",
    "spread over time slices @xmath25 with 2 hits per configuration .",
    "dividing the three - point correlation functions by the wall - wall pseudoscalar - pseudoscalar correlation function yields the desired matrix elements up to a factor of @xmath26 which is determined from a covariant fit to the wall - point two - point function in the range @xmath27 for each mass .",
    "since our results unambiguously show that re@xmath4 and re@xmath5 come essentially from the current - current operators ( recall these have the largest wilson coefficients ) we will concentrate on these operators from now on .",

    "the conventional chiral logarithm @xmath34 is almost linear over the mass range we have used so the fitting routine can not distinguish this term from the linear term if we leave the coefficient of the logarithm as a free parameter . since the large coefficient -6 of the logarithm makes the contribution of this term comparable to the contribution of the linear term omitting this term would change @xmath35 by almost a factor of two .",
    "the quenched chiral log contribution is very small .",

    "we define a subtracted matrix element @xmath38 by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is obtained from a linear fit to @xmath41 . for an explanation of this subtraction of the power divergence",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "the quenched chiral perturbation theory corrections to @xmath42 our data is consistent with a linear fit @xmath43 with the slope @xmath44 determining the low energy constants @xmath45 and the intercept @xmath46 arising from residual chiral symmetry breaking .",

    "we use chiral perturbation theory to compute the lattice @xmath49 matrix elements . using non - perturbative z factors",
    "we obtain the continuum matrix elements which are then multiplied by wilson coefficients to yield the physical amplitudes .",
    "we present an extrapolation to the kaon mass scale to lowest order in chiral perturbation theory and a second extrapolation which includes one loop logarithmic effects .",
    "we multiply the pseudoscalar masses by @xmath50 so that for @xmath51 the chiral perturbation theory extrapolation is increasingly accurate but we need the extrapolation at @xmath52 , the physical point . in figure",
    "[ fig : re_a0_re_a2 ] we present re@xmath47 and re@xmath48 as a function of the parameter @xmath50 .",
    "the chiral logarithm correction for re@xmath47 is large ( about @xmath53 ) .",
    "in addition one expects a large correction ( not included here ) coming from the tree level @xmath54 terms necessary to cancel the dependence on the chiral perturbation theory scale @xmath55 .",
    "-0.1 in = -0.3 in    -0.2 in    if the z factors and the wilson coefficients were calculated to all orders in perturbation theory the physical amplitudes that we calculate would not depend on the scale @xmath56 where the transition between the lattice and the continuum operators is made .",
    "to a good approximation this is what we find , even though at @xmath57 one expects non - perturbative effects in the z factors and at @xmath58 the discretization errors may be large . in figure",
    "[ fig : delta_i_1_2_mu_dep ] we present the ratio re@xmath47/re@xmath48 , the so called @xmath59 rule which shows a large enhancement in the @xmath60 channel in accord with experiment ( note , the chiral logarithm corrections largely cancel in the ratio so a large enhancement is seen for both extrapolation choices ) .",

    "in conclusion , re@xmath47 , re@xmath48 and especially the ratio re@xmath47/re@xmath48 were found reasonably close to the experimental values .",
    "we see this as an important success of the lattice method .",
