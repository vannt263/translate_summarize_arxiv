    "recently , there has been a debate about the underlying nature of the experimentally reported orbitons observed by raman spectroscopy in orbital ordered lamno@xmath2 .",
    "@xcite despite pronounced temperature- and symmetry - dependent properties of the modes , the assignment has been confronted with criticism and alternative concepts .",
    "@xcite for instance , multi - phonon scattering has been theoretically predicted to arise from the franck - condon ( fc ) process via self - trapped orbitons .",
    "@xcite interestingly , in spite of _ mutually exclusive _ selection rules an infrared absorption study shows similar features as raman scattering measurements at about 125 mev ( 1000  @xmath4 ) , 145 mev ( 1160  @xmath4 ) , and 160 mev ( 1280  @xmath4 ) .",
    "@xcite this was attributed to multi - phonon scattering instead of orbital excitations . on the other hand , orbiton - phonon mixed modes",
    "are predicted to appear as satellite structures in the phonon spectrum due to electron - phonon coupling .",
    "@xcite    lamno@xmath2 shows @xmath5/@xmath6 orbital ordering below t@xmath7 k accompanied by a cooperative jahn - teller ( jt ) distortion .",
    "@xcite two different contributions to this antiferro - orbital ordering , which support each other , have been suggested .",
    "the first mechanism relies on the cooperative jt effect . in this case ,",
    "orbiton excitations accompany lattice distortions and _ vice versa_. their energy , determined by the strength of electron - phonon coupling , is between 0.7 and 2  ev .",
    "@xcite the second mechanism is based on superexchange interaction . within this mechanism orbitons",
    "are collective excitations and their energy is expected at much lower energies of 160  mev because of strong on - site coulomb repulsion .",
    "@xcite thus , the determination of the respective contribution to orbital ordering and its energy scale are closely related to the nature of orbital excitations .",
    "quite recently , resonant raman scattering measurements  @xcite have shown a symmetry - dependent resonance of the one- and two - phonon signal around the jt gap at 2 ev , suggesting a phononic origin of the assigned orbitons due to the fc mechanism . however",
    ", a detailed temperature- and symmetry - dependence is still lacking which is significant in addressing a coupling of phonons to orbital ordering .",
    "thus , a careful examination on the higher energy regime of the raman spectrum above 1300  @xmath4 is indispensable to uncover all aspects of orbital dynamics .",
    "furthermore , their doping dependence can give further clues because the orbital ordering undergoes a transition while crossing the phase boundary between the canted antiferromagnetic insulating ( caf ) and ferromagnetic insulating ( fmi ) state .",
    "@xcite    in this paper we report on raman scattering measurements of single crystalline la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 ( @xmath3=0 , 0.06 , 0.09 and 0.125 ) , focusing on the higher energy regime .",
    "for @xmath8 we observe multi - phonon scattering up to fourth order of the one - phonon modes at frequencies between 490 and 640  @xmath4 .",
    "the distinct symmetry- , temperature- , and doping - dependencies of this scattering contribution unveil the insufficiency of the fc mechanism in describing the observed multi - phonon scattering .",
    "this points to a orbiton - phonon mixed nature of the observed multi - phonon scattering .",
    ".[table]peak frequencies of multi - phonon scattering of different orders .",
    "multiples of first order scattering frequencies are given in parentheses .",
    "the multi - phonon scattering peaks are grouped according to their overtones of the 493- , 602- , and 641-@xmath9 modes .",
    "two different frequencies which belong to the same group are attributed to different polarizations . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "single crystals of la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 ( @xmath3=0 , 0.06 , 0.09 , and 0.125 ) were grown by using the floating zone method . these samples are twinned . as a result",
    ", some crystallographic axes can not be discriminated .",
    "raman scattering measurements were performed in a quasi - backscattering geometry with the excitation line @xmath10 nm ( 2.34 ev ) of an ar@xmath11 laser .",
    "the small incident power of 8 mw avoids significant heating and irradiation effects .",
    "raman spectra were collected by a dilor - xy triple spectrometer and a nitrogen cooled ccd ( charge - coupled device ) detector .",
    "the high temperature measurements from 300  k to 640  k were carried out using a heating stage under vacuum .",
    "figure  1(a ) displays polarized raman spectra of lamno@xmath2 at 5 k. the incident and scattered light are parallel and perpendicular to the quasicubic surface of the perovskitelike crystals . for such scattering geometries ,",
    "raman spectra are expected in the @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 polarizations where @xmath3 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 correspond to the respective quasicubic [ 100 ] , [ 010 ] , [ 110 ] , and [ 1@xmath190 ] directions .",
    "since the studied samples are twinned , the parallel configuration contains @xmath12 and @xmath13 polarizations while the crossed one consists of @xmath14 and @xmath15 polarizations . due to",
    "different selection rules the raman spectra of the parallel and crossed polarizations show a slightly different behavior in the total number of phonon modes and their relative intensity .    below 650  @xmath4",
    "we observe 17 phonon modes as first - order scattering out of 24 symmetry - allowed modes for the @xmath20 crystal structure .",
    "the number and sharpness of the observed modes guarantees a high quality of the single crystal .",
    "the modes below 330 @xmath9 are due to vibrations of ( la / sr ) cations and rotations of the mno@xmath21 octahedra .",
    "the modes above 400 @xmath9 arise from bending and stretching vibrations of the octahedra .",
    "@xcite the atomic displacement of the respective normal modes has been provided by m. n. iliev _",
    "[ 12 ] . for the detailed physics of the one - phonon modes we refer to our previous work .",
    "@xcite hereafter , we will focus on the high frequency regime covering the reported orbitons .",
    "our results reproduce well the three features at about 1000 , 1160 , and 1280  @xmath4 which were assigned to orbitons .",
    "@xcite moreover , at much higher energies even additional maxima show up .",
    "all maxima between 1485 and 1911  @xmath4 as well as between 2096 and 2542  @xmath4 appear close to periodically [ see figs .",
    "1(b ) and ( c ) ] .",
    "this suggests a common origin based on the one - phonon modes between 493 and 641  @xmath4 .",
    "thus , the claimed orbitons should not be considered as _ pure _ orbital waves . in principle",
    ", a collective orbital wave might be also observable besides multi - phonon scattering .",
    "however , we did not find evidence for this collective state below 3000 @xmath9 ( @xmath22 mev ) .",
    "if present , this might be due to a negligible scattering cross section caused by the strong jt distortion .",
    "this implies that the orbital ordering in lamno@xmath2 is predominantly determined by the jt mechanism",
    ". a closer look at the higher - energy maxima reveals a fine structure .",
    "this is due to a twinning of the single crystal and the polarization - dependence of the multi - phonon frequency .",
    "the latter feature is unusual in conventional multi - phonon scattering and allows us to assign the symmetry of the maxima by comparison to the raman study of an untwinned single crystal .",
    "@xcite    the measured frequencies of the high - energy excitations are listed in table i together with calculated integer multiples of one - phonon modes . here",
    "note that the assignment of two - phonon peaks to specific one - phonon modes is not straightforward since two - phonon scattering arises predominantly from regions of the brillouin zone where the phonon density of states is largest .",
    "nonetheless , as a starting point we will assign them to simple multiples of one - phonon peaks .",
    "this is because the fc mechanism is asserted to be mainly responsible for the observed multi - phonon scattering .",
    "@xcite in this local mechanism , higher - order scattering usually shows up at integer multiples of one - phonon peak energy , as the fc process results from a displacement of the intermediate electronic state from the initial one rather than a simultaneous emission of @xmath23-phonons .",
    "thus , this feature enables us to check the validity of the fc mechanism .",
    "the 985- and 1485-@xmath4 peaks correspond to the overtones of the 493-@xmath4 mode in @xmath12 polarization .",
    "the 1017- , 1539- , and 2096-@xmath4 peaks might also be related to higher - order scattering of the 493-@xmath4 mode in @xmath13 polarization .",
    "similarly , the 1137 ( 1173)- , 1653 ( 1781)- , and 2297 ( 2418)-@xmath4 modes are assigned to the overtones of the 602-@xmath4 mode in @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) polarization .",
    "the 1281- , 1911- , and 2542-@xmath4 modes correspond to the overtones of the 641-@xmath4 mode .",
    "several distinct features show up .",
    "the second order scattering at 1281  @xmath4 is much more intense than the first order one at 641  @xmath4 .",
    "furthermore , as fig .",
    "2(a ) displays , there are the energy differences between multi - phonon scattering and integer multiples of one - phonon peaks . for example",
    ", the overtones of the 602-@xmath4 mode in @xmath12 polarization shift to higher energy up to third order and then show a decrease at fourth order .",
    "in contrast , those of the 493-@xmath4 mode in @xmath13 polarization shift to lower energy with increasing order .",
    "the overtones of the 641-@xmath24 mode show no substantial anomaly in frequency . instead , its scattering intensity as a function of order does not parallel to other modes contrary to the fc picture . as a consequence of a strong decrease of scattering intensity at fourth order",
    "it becomes weaker than that of the 602-@xmath4 mode in @xmath13 polarization",
    "[ see fig . 1(c ) and fig .",
    "this demonstrates that the fc mechanism can not capture the full aspect of the observed multi - phonon scattering .",
    "further note that even if one considers a combination of first - order peaks , one can not produce consistently all higher - order peaks .",
    "we turn now to the temperature dependence of the higher - order raman spectra . as fig .",
    "3 shows , upon heating the second order maxima undergo a broadening and softening .",
    "the third and fourth order signal ( not shown here ) can be detected up to 350 k and 150 k , respectively .",
    "their behavior parallels that of the second order signal within the measured temperature interval .",
    "the main features are summarized in fig .",
    "4 . first , with increasing temperature the normalized intensity of the one - phonon mode as well as of their overtones falls off like an order parameter [ see fig .",
    "4(a ) for a typical behavior at 493  @xmath4 ] .",
    "second , the second order mode softens by 40  @xmath4 upon heating from 5 k to 640 k. the representative example at 1281  @xmath4 is shown in fig .",
    "this is contrasted by a small frequency shift of the corresponding one - phonon mode by @xmath26  @xmath4 .",
    "noticeably , its temperature dependence agrees well with that of the phonon intensity .",
    "third , the ratio of a second- to first - order integrated phonon intensity , @xmath27 , decreases gradually with increasing temperature as fig .",
    "4(b ) shows .",
    "figure  5 displays a doping study of the second - order raman spectra of la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 ( @xmath3=0 , 0.06 , 0.09 , and 0.125 ) at 5 k. for the caf samples ( @xmath3=0 , 0.06 , and 0.09 ) similar features are observed with increasing doping except a rapid decrease of the intensity . in contrast",
    ", there exists only a broadened maximum around 1000  @xmath4 in the fmi sample ( @xmath3=0.125 ) while maxima around 1160 and 1280  @xmath4 disappear .",
    "it should be noted that the peak energies and relative intensities of the corresponding one - phonon modes do not change appreciably .",
    "@xcite furthermore , for @xmath28 the broadened peak around 1000  @xmath4 should not be considered as the reappearance of the peak which is already present in the caf samples .",
    "rather , it should be ascribed to a damping of the maxima of the caf samples ranging from 1100 to 1350  @xmath4 .",
    "this is supported by the results of oxygen - doped manganites lamno@xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) ; the three pronounced peaks in the caf sample continuously evolve into a broad , unstructured maximum in the fmi samples which systematically shifts to lower energy as @xmath31 increases .",
    "@xcite    in fig .",
    "6(a ) we provide a polarization dependence of the @xmath32 sample owing to the discrimination between @xmath14 plane and @xmath33 axis .",
    "remarkably , in @xmath34 polarization we observe solely the 1281-@xmath4 mode .",
    "this is quite unusual when taking into account that the intensity of the 639-@xmath35 mode is much weaker than that of the 494-@xmath35 mode .",
    "this symmetry dependence reproduces partially the result reported in ref.[1 ] and can hardly be understood within a conventional multi - phonon picture .",
    "figures  6 ( b ) and ( c ) display the temperature dependence for @xmath36 and 0.125 .",
    "the @xmath36 shows a moderate decrease of the second - order maxima upon heating from 5 k to room temperature .",
    "in contrast , the fmi sample ( @xmath28 ) exhibits a rather strong suppression of the second - order signal through the metal - insulator transition at t@xmath37 k where the rearrangement of orbital ordering takes place .",
    "@xcite this suggests a relationship between the observed multi - phonon scattering and the change of an orbital ordering form through the caf / fmi phase boundary ( see below ) .",
    "in the following we will examine the origin of the anomalous multi - phonon scattering .",
    "usually , anharmonic electron - phonon interactions can lead to multi - phonon scattering in transition metal oxides .",
    "the simultaneous emission of @xmath23 phonons occurs due to lattice anharmonicity .",
    "since this mechanism is a simple extension of a first - order process to higher order , the intensity of @xmath23-phonon scattering decays as @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the electron - phonon coupling constant .",
    "in addition , the intensity ratio of a second- to first - order scattering , that is @xmath27 , would be independent of temperature since the respective intensity has the same resonant dependence on incident photon energy .",
    "@xcite obviously , these considerations can not account for (",
    "i ) the larger intensity of the second - order peak at 1281  @xmath4 compared to that of the first - order peak at 641  @xmath4 ( @xmath40 at 5k ) , ( ii ) the anomalous evolution of peak energies in higher - order scattering ( see table i and fig .",
    "2 ) , and ( iii ) the temperature - dependent ratio of @xmath27 [ see fig .",
    "4(b ) ] .",
    "another effective mechanism is based on resonance scattering . in this process",
    "multi - phonons are created by a first - order electron - lattice interaction together with a virtual electron excitation .",
    "@xcite when the incident photon energy is in resonance with localized electronic excitations , multi - phonon scattering becomes enhanced .",
    "very recently , resonant raman scattering measurements of lamno@xmath2 reveal a sharp resonance around 2 ev via the creation of _ orbiton excitons_.  @xcite since in our experiment the incident light energy of 2.34  ev lies in the window of resonance ( 0.65 ev ) , the observed multi - phonon scattering is also governed by resonant scattering caused by orbitons .",
    "significantly , orbital excitations in the jt ordered state involve a local oxygen displacement .",
    "@xcite as a consequence , the fc mechanism is expected to be active .",
    "actually , the validity of the fc mechanism has been corroborated by previous studies .",
    "@xcite here we point out that the fc mechanism is consistent with the simultaneous observation of similar multi - phonon features by optical conductivity and raman scattering measurements despite completely different selection rules .",
    "@xcite originally , infrared inactive modes become infrared active in the multi - phonon scattering owing to nonlinear local oxygen displacements . in this case , the weak intensity of the multi - phonon modes seen in the optical conductivity can be ascribed to orbiton - assisted parity breaking . however , as pointed out above , there exist several anomalies which can not be catched within the canonical fc picture .    first , the huge ratio of @xmath41 seen with respect to the mn - o stretching mode at 641-@xmath35 is beyond simple theoretical calculations .",
    "@xcite second , a temperature - dependent ratio of @xmath27 is expected for the resonant mechanism rather than for the fc one .",
    "@xcite third , the observed frequency and intensity of @xmath23-order scattering ( see fig .  2 ) is incompatible with the simple fc scenario .",
    "we suggest that a strong coupling of orbitons to phonons should also be taken into account .",
    "self - trapped orbital excitons accompany local ionic distortions , that is , a strong nonlinearity corresponding to a superposition of multi - phonons . as a result ,",
    "orbitons are intrinsically coupled to phonons under electron - phonon coupling .",
    "theoretically , orbiton induced satellites are predicted to develop at higher frequencies of the phonon spectrum .",
    "@xcite in this scenario , the dominant energy scale of orbiton satellites is determined by the strength of electron - phonon coupling .",
    "noticeably , the anomalous increase of the peak energy is observed at fourth - order scattering between 2096 and 2542 @xmath9 [ see figs . 1 and 2 ] .",
    "if this anomaly is considered to be a result of the influence of orbiton satellites on multi - phonon scattering , one can obtain strong electron - phonon coupling of @xmath42 .",
    "@xcite however , orbiton satellites do not show up as separate peaks .",
    "rather , a orbiton - phonon mixed character is reflected in diverse anomalies of the observed multi - phonon modes .",
    "this scenario can well explain the observed giant softening of the two - phonon modes by 40 @xmath9 as a function of temperature [ see fig .",
    "4(a ) ] . upon heating ,",
    "the jt distortions become weaker as demonstrated by the order - parameter - like fall - off of the intensity of the mn - o bond stretching mode in fig .",
    "the weakening of electron - phonon coupling will lead to a shift of the orbiton excitation energy to lower energies .",
    "@xcite further evidence is provided by the temperature - dependent ratio of @xmath27 . with increasing temperature the local jt oxygen displacement caused by the fc process will fade away .",
    "consequently , the fc contribution to multi - phonon scattering gradually decreases while reducing the orbiton - phonon mixed character of multi - phonon scattering .",
    "then , a crossover of the fc mechanism to a conventional one results in the reduced lifetime of the orbital exciton seen in fig .",
    "also the drastic change of the two - phonon modes through the caf / fmi phase boundary supports our interpretation .",
    "the three features of the caf samples turn into a broadened maximum around 1000  @xmath4 in the @xmath28 sample .",
    "the comparison between the sr- and oxygen - doped samples @xcite unveils that the broadened maximum around 1000  @xmath4 at @xmath28 results from a softening of the maxima centered around 1300  @xmath4 at @xmath36 .",
    "such a giant shift of the two - phonon mode as a function of doping is quite unusual and can not be understood without considering the orbital degrees of freedom . in the caf phase a @xmath5/@xmath6 type of an orbital ordering",
    "is stabilized mainly by the cooperative jt distortions , leading to the jt gap of 2 ev .",
    "when the incident light energy is within the window of resonance ( 0.65 ev ) , raman scattering process takes place through an orbital flip from a @xmath5/@xmath6 orbital ordered state .",
    "@xcite in this resonant raman process , the energy and shape of multi - phonon scattering are largely determined by a matrix element of orbiton excitons .",
    "thus , the three - peak feature of the observed two - phonon scattering and their polarization dependence should be attributed to the specific orbital ordering pattern of lamno@xmath2 . in the fmi phase",
    "a new type of orbital state evolves from the lamno@xmath2-type orbital state upon cooling below t@xmath37 k while suppressing the jt distortions .",
    "@xcite although its exact form is not known , there exists evidence that orbital polarons are an essential part of a new orbital ordered state .",
    "@xcite most probably , thus , the orbital ordering of the fmi phase will be given as a combination of an orbital polaron and a @xmath5/@xmath6 orbital .",
    "noticeably , the binding energy of orbital polarons , @xmath43 ev , is much smaller than the jt gap of 2 ev .",
    "@xcite as a result , raman scattering process will be mainly governed by an off - resonance one .",
    "then , this leads to a smearing of the features arising from orbitons . actually , the three - peak feature changes into the unstructured maximum .",
    "in particular , this is related to a fluctuation of the underlying orbitals in the fmi phase .",
    "@xcite the weakening of orbiton - phonon coupling can account for a giant softening of the two - phonon frequency .",
    "therefore , we come to the conclusion that the multiphonon scattering in lamno@xmath2 relies strongly on the orbital ordered pattern . furthermore , the intrinsic orbiton - phonon couplings are responsible for the observed anomalous behaviors in intensity and frequency .",
    "in summary , we have reported a detailed study of the higher - order raman scattering in the manganites la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 as a function of temperature and doping . for the first time , we are able to probe and analyze phonon scattering up to forth - order using raman spectroscopy .",
    "doping dependence of two - phonon scattering together with the frequency shift of several higher order modes indicates several anomalies which can not be understood within the canonical fc mechanism .",
    "the full understanding of the multi - phonon scattering in the orbital - ordered lamno@xmath2 system can be achieved by considering the orbiton - phonon mixed character .",
    "our study suggests that in orbital ordered systems multi - phonon scattering can serve as a valuable probe of the orbital dynamics .",
    "we thank j. geck , r. klingeler , c. baumann , and m. grninger for useful discussions .",
    "this work was supported in part by the nato collaborative linkage grant pst.clg.977766 and intas 01 - 278 as well as by dfg spp1073 .",
    "one of the best assignments can be given by the combination of the two peaks , a = 493 @xmath9 and b = 641 @xmath9 : 2a = 986 , a+b = 1134 , 2b = 1282 , 3a = 1479 , 2a+b = 1627 , a+2b = 1775 , 3b = 1923 , 3a+b = 2120 , 2a+2b = 2268 , a+3b = 2416 , and 4b = 2564 @xmath9 correspond to 985,1137,1281 , 1485 , 1653 , 1781 , 1911 , 2096 , 2297 , 2418 , and 2542 @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "however , this assignment is artificial since multiphonon scattering corresponding to the strongest mode 602 @xmath9 never appears . here",
    "note that resonant raman scattering measurements @xcite show a simultaneous resonance of the 493- and 602-@xmath9 modes at the jahn - teller gap of 2 ev .",
    "thus , in the incident energy of 2.34 ev two - phonon scatterings should be dominated by an overtone and combination of the above two modes ."
