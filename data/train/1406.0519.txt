    "few - body correlations are known to play a fascinating role in a variety of quantum resonance phenomena  @xcite . since the discovery of efimov states in the seventies @xcite",
    ", theoretical efforts have drastically increased to further our understanding of few - body physics .",
    "one of the important theoretical developments is perhaps the effective field theory approach to few - body problems  @xcite which relates resonant scattering phenomena to scale invariant critical points  @xcite . and thanks to the experimental observations of feshbach resonances in cold gases , our interests in few - body states",
    "have been substantially revived during the last decade .",
    "impressive experimental developments of inelastic loss spectroscopy near resonance have made it possible to perform precision measurements of loss rates .",
    "these breakthroughs have been successfully utilized to detect efimov trimers @xcite .",
    "one can then ask the question what is beyond trimers , or the @xmath7 case , in the general context of quantum n - boson problems .",
    "partially stimulated by the feshbach resonance experiments , efforts have been made to understand few - body physics either beyond the efimov paradigm or few - body clusters associated with efimov states .",
    "the discovery and observation of associated universal four - body states , known as tetramers , appear to be another successful story in few - body research  @xcite .",
    "however , going beyond four - body states so far appears to be extremely challenging and , not surprisingly , little is known about n - boson states with @xmath8  @xcite . on the other hand , from the point of view of cold gases , it is essential to understand the underlying few - body clusters as they are the fundamental building blocks for many - body correlations .",
    "one of the main hurdles in the three - dimensional n - boson problem , which still remains to be an almost uncharted territory , is that in n - boson bound states as atoms get closer together , the resonant attractive interactions become more and more dominating .",
    "this is evident if one simply considers particles interacting with a _ weak _ attractive contact interaction of strength @xmath9 .",
    "the dimensionless two - body coupling constant @xmath10 which is a measure of the ratio between @xmath11 , the two - body interaction energy at scale l , and @xmath12 , the kinetic energy at the same scale , has the following scaling property ,    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the spatial dimension . although strictly speaking eq .",
    "( [ scaling ] ) is only valid when @xmath15 is much less than unity , nevertheless it is clear that at shorter scales the interaction becomes more dominating in @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "what further complicates the n - boson problem in 3d is that at the strong coupling fixed point of @xmath9 , or near resonance , the three - body interactions also exhibit discrete scale invariance due to the renormalization flow @xcite .",
    "this peculiar feature implies an additional dependence of the n - boson physics on a non - universal ultraviolet regime that is consistent with numerical findings in ref .",
    "@xcite @xcite . for @xmath17 ,",
    "the opposite occurs ; namely the system becomes free when approaching smaller and smaller scales , that is it becomes _ asymptotically free _ ,",
    "similar to quantum chromodynamics  @xcite .",
    "the general scale dependence of @xmath15 can be systematically obtained by analysing the standard renormalization group equations .",
    "we restrict ourselves to a positive effective scattering length or bound state size @xmath18 due to an attractive contact interaction in low dimensions . for a given @xmath18 , the corresponding interaction strength in @xmath0 dimension",
    "is ,    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the gamma function and diverges as @xmath21 near @xmath2 .",
    "following a similar calculation to those in ref .",
    "@xcite , one finds for @xmath0 ,    @xmath22    in 3d , @xmath23 .",
    "indeed , @xmath24 vanishes at large distances , consistent with the naive scaling argument presented above .",
    "however , the behaviour at distances much shorter than @xmath18 is set by the asymptotic value @xmath25 indicating the relevance of interactions . in ( 2-@xmath26)d , the corresponding limit yields @xmath27 illustrating the asymptotic freedom of bosons",
    "moreover , in 1d , the value of @xmath28 in the infrared limit approaches a constant value which implies a strongly interacting regime in the dilute limit .    for n - boson systems ,",
    "the total interaction energy is @xmath29 , while the kinetic energy scales as @xmath30 . at short distances ,",
    "the ratio between these two energies thus scales as @xmath31 . in 3d",
    ", the magnitude of this quantity becomes much larger than unity as both @xmath32 is large and @xmath33 is a constant of order unity .",
    "thus in 3d the n - boson states are dictated by the mutual attractions and the total attractive energy , @xmath34 where @xmath35 scales as @xmath36 , becomes more and more negative as one enters the ultraviolet limit . strictly speaking for n",
    "bosons interacting via a contact interaction , its energy is not bounded from below because of this ultraviolet catastrophe ( _ uc _ ) . to cure the _ uc _",
    ", one has to further regularize the theory by specifying the details of the potential at short distances .",
    "one anticipates that its properties are not universal , and very much depend on how bosons interact at these very short distances .",
    "for this reason , quantum scalar fields with attractive contact interactions are usually considered to be _ sick _ theories .",
    "this aspect of the problem and the issue of _ uc _ in 3d are not totally surprising .",
    "in fact it has been known for the @xmath7 case ; namely the energy scale that sets the binding energies of the efimov trimers is given by a non - universal three - body parameter .",
    "fortunately , the catastrophe mentioned above does not appear in dimensions lower than two .",
    "although what happens in 3d at the @xmath32-body level ( @xmath8 ) still remains to be explored and understood , in this article we report the results on universal n - boson droplet states in 2-@xmath26 dimensions ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "there are two essential ingredients in our analysis of the scaling properties of n - boson states .",
    "first of all , particles become asymptotically free or non - interacting at short distances in low dimensions .",
    "this is in contrast to 3d where near - resonance attractive interactions are asymptotically dominating in the ultraviolet limit .",
    "thus , in low dimensions at the ultraviolet scales the energetics is predominately determined by the kinetic energy associated with the uncertainty principle .",
    "indeed , @xmath38 in low dimensions and vanishes as l goes to zero . for any large but fixed value of @xmath32 , @xmath39 ,",
    "the ratio between the total interaction energy relative to the kinetic energy , becomes vanishingly small as @xmath40 approaches zero .",
    "so unlike in 3d , here the total energy , which now is mainly the kinetic energy , @xmath30 , _ increases _ as @xmath40 approaches zero . as a result",
    ", this system of n bosons interacting via a contact interaction can be shown to be bounded from below ( see more discussions below ) .",
    "physically , it is the dominance of the kinetic energy at short distances that effectively keeps particles from collapsing into a non - universal ultraviolet regime ; it removes the _ uc _ in low dimensions . the universal scaling property obtained below is a manifestation of the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics . secondly , as a consequence of asymptotic freedom , via applying the standard effective potential method , one can further show that the induced or renormalized three- , four - body interactions etc . also become irrelevant at short distances .",
    "technically , it is this property that makes it possible for us to derive a universal effective potential for n - boson states and carry out the scaling analysis .    in 2d , the limit of @xmath41 , i.e. three- and four - body bound states have been studied previously  @xcite .",
    "the authors of ref .  @xcite",
    "have also proposed a bound state for n bosons ; we later identify it as a classical solution to the 2d quantum problem studied below .",
    "we will return to discuss the relation between our solutions and these previous results at a later point .",
    "our analysis of the n - boson problem is organized as follows : in section ii , the field theoretic framework for a bosonic field is put forth , and an ansatz for studying the solitonic motion of the system is discussed . in section",
    "iii the solitonic motion is quantized and the scaling properties of these solitonic n - boson states are found .",
    "sections iv and v examine the effect of loop corrections to the quantized solitonic n - boson states .",
    "these results are then compared to the variational energy of condensates at different length scales in section vi .",
    "finally , in section vii we summarize our results and discuss the relevance to cold atoms .",
    "in order to study the scaling properties of bound states , it is most convenient to formulate the problem in terms of functional integrals .",
    "the lagrangian for a bosonic field @xmath43 is given below ,    @xmath44    where @xmath9 is the two - body interaction constant defined in eq.([g2 ] ) and @xmath45 .",
    "for the purpose of studying few - body physics , we choose to work with the density ( @xmath46 ) and phase ( @xmath47 ) fields and @xmath48 .",
    "the corresponding lagrangian is    @xmath49    this lagrangian leads to the following semiclassical equations of motion    @xmath50    we then expand the fields around a semiclassical _ isotropic _ solution to the equation of motion , @xmath51 as @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the subscripts _ sc _ and _ qc _ indicate semiclassical and quantum correction fields respectively . for isotropic solitonic solutions , @xmath54 and @xmath55 should have the following scaling form    @xmath56    where @xmath57 is the distance measured from the center of the mass of the system .",
    "the @xmath58-function satisfies the normalization condition , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 and @xmath61 are two constants that depend on the properties of the scaling function @xmath62 at @xmath63 . a similar scaling ansatz has been used in previous works @xcite to study the dynamical properties , such as collapse times , of condensates in higher dimensions and in the presence of trapping potentials .",
    "as mentioned above , this scaling ansatz emphasizes the solitonic nature of the system .",
    "the ansatz in eq .",
    "( [ f - function ] ) is a generalization of the textbook 1d soliton solution  @xcite .",
    "thus the resulting n - boson droplet states are actually n - boson solitonic droplet states ( or simply n - boson states for brevity ) .",
    "the partition function for this system can then be written as    @xmath64    the explicit forms of @xmath65 are given in appendix a. after integrating out the fast fluctuation fields @xmath66 , @xmath67 , we then obtain an effective lagrangian for the dynamical scaling variable @xmath68 in @xmath0 dimensions ,    @xmath69    where @xmath70 .",
    "@xmath71 , as well as @xmath72 , defined below , are dimensionless constants further depending on the details of the scaling function @xmath73 introduced in eq .",
    "( [ f - function ] ) .",
    "although the spectrum is completely known only when @xmath74 are available , most of the scaling properties discussed below are robust and depend little on the specific values of these coefficients . in appendix",
    "a , one can find values of @xmath71 calculated for different ansatzs of the scaling function @xmath75",
    ".    the explicit form of @xmath76 in eq .",
    "( [ qc ] ) , was determined under the assumption that the density profile was constant up to a size @xmath42 .",
    "this allowed the fluctuations to be expanded in terms of plane waves with wave vectors that have magnitudes , @xmath77 , larger than @xmath78 .",
    "if another choice of boundary conditions is used , the only significant modification to the fluctuation spectrum will be to the modes that have wave vectors with magnitudes @xmath79 .",
    "however as will be seen below , the dominant contributions to @xmath76 , are from modes with @xmath80 , where the phonon modes start to resemble the spectrum of a free particle and form a continuum . as a result",
    ", this choice of boundary conditions does not alter the following analysis .",
    "further discussions of this approximation are found in appendix b.    two remarks are now in order .",
    "since we are dealing with attractive interactions , the chemical potential and compressibility are both negative .",
    "thus the energy of phonons ( or @xmath76 ) always carries an imaginary part when @xmath81 or @xmath82 .",
    "this reflects an instability of density waves at an _ arbitrary _ scale larger than @xmath83",
    ". only if @xmath84 is less than @xmath85 do phonons become fully stable .",
    "not surprisingly , @xmath85 is precisely the length associated with the classical equilibrium position @xmath86 .",
    "equally as important , the leading quantum correction @xmath76 in eq.([qc ] ) precisely describes the contributions of zero point fluctuations of _ phonons _ at scales smaller than @xmath42 ( as indicated by the lower cut - off in eq .",
    "( [ qc ] ) )",
    ". since only the fluctuations with wavelengths shorter than the scaling parameter @xmath42 contribute , splitting the density and phase fields into semiclassical and fluctuating parts is equivalent to separating fast fluctuating fields from the slow motion at scale @xmath42 .",
    "following @xmath87 , the interaction energy at a scale of @xmath42 is given as @xmath88 while the kinetic energy associated with @xmath42 is @xmath89 .",
    "the velocity @xmath90 from the conversion of the interaction energy above is therefore proportional to @xmath91 .",
    "the duration of the motion at scale @xmath42 is thus    @xmath92    this turns out also to be the time scale associated with the fluctuating fields at scale @xmath42 , the slowest fluctuation modes .",
    "indeed , the fluctuations at wave vector @xmath77 have a corresponding frequency @xmath93 or @xmath94 . for attractive interactions , negative @xmath9 ,",
    "the frequency is naturally imaginary , which indicates the time scale for an instability to occur at that particular wave vector . if @xmath95 is chosen to be @xmath42 , the longest wavelength for microscopic fluctuations for a given scaling parameter ( which is also equivalent to @xmath42 ) , then the time scale associated with the onset of instability is equivalent to the duration of motion at scale @xmath42 defined in eq .",
    "( [ duration ] ) .    by restricting ourselves to the fluctuations at scales shorter than @xmath42 , we effectively separate the fast motions of fluctuation fields @xmath96 from the slow motion of the semiclassical fields @xmath54 , @xmath55 at the the scaling parameter @xmath42 .",
    "in other words , we only need to take into account the quantum correction due to fields that fluctuate faster than the time scale @xmath97 .",
    "the n - boson quantum dynamics is described by this effective lagrangian .",
    "quantization of the solitonic motion associated with @xmath42 can be carried out using the standard feynman path integral method and below we show the result of quantization .",
