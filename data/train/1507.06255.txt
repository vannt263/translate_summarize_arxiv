    "laser - induced cavitation involves the fast deposition of laser energy in a liquid , resulting in an explosion that creates a transient vapor bubble that expands reaching a maximum radius @xmath3 and then collapses under the static pressure of the surrounding liquid @xcite .",
    "these bubbles have been used in many different applications where fast actuation of liquid or where impulsive forces are required at a microscopic length scale . for example , in high speed microfluidics @xcite and micro - pumps @xcite , cell membrane permeabilization @xcite and cell lysis @xcite , red blood cell stretching and poration @xcite , malaria detection @xcite , bending of carbon nanotubes and nanowires @xcite .    in the last few years",
    "there has been a lot of interest in the production of cavitation bubbles through photothermal processes in nanomaterials @xcite resulting in bubbles with sizes on the order of several hundreds of nanometers .",
    "these transient nanobubbles have shown great potential for medical treatments @xcite .",
    "optical tweezers or highly focused continuous ( cw ) lasers have been used to create micron sized cavitation bubbles in liquids that are transparent to the laser wavelength @xcite .",
    "dholakia and coworkers @xcite trapped a polystyrene nanoparticle that was later irradiated with a nanosecond laser pulse creating optical breakdown at the trapped nanoparticle .",
    "another approach used custom made microparticles filled with absorbing dye that was rapidly vaporized creating multiple cycles of bubble expansion and collapse in a timescale of a few microseconds @xcite .",
    "recently we showed that a microparticle that partially absorbs at the wavelength of the trapping beam in an optical tweezer can periodically generate microscopic explosions @xcite .",
    "the particle is simultaneously heated and pulled towards the waist of the trapping beam where it superheats the liquid and creates a transient vapor explosion that pushes the particle below the waist , where the cycle restarts ( fig .",
    "however , in that study we could not establish the bubble size distribution of @xmath3 and production rate , which are important for potential applications . in the present work we measure hundreds of bubbles with two different methods : fast video recording and a fast photodiode which dramatically increases the time resolution .",
    "we find that there is a minimum bubble size of @xmath5 m and that most of the bubbles have an @xmath3 between 2 and 6@xmath6 m which is a fairly narrow range .",
    "the experimental setup is a near ir optical tweezer with a wavelength of 975 nm focused by a 100x/1.25 na microscope objective .",
    "the microparticles are standard magnetic beads ( bangs labs ) with a mean diameter of 3.16 @xmath0 m immersed in water . in the experiments ,",
    "the microparticles interact individually with the focused laser .",
    "the liquid sample is placed between two no .",
    "1 microscope glass coverslips ( thickness @xmath7 mm ) separated with spacers with a height @xmath8 m .",
    "the sample is then sealed with nail polish .",
    "some experiments were done without sealing the sample and the results were consistent with those with the sealed chamber .",
    "a schematic of the experimental setup is depicted in fig .",
    "the transmitted laser power by the microscope objective is between 50 and 62 mw .",
    "the trapping laser light is collected with the microscope condenser and a lens into a fast photodiode ( 175ps rise , alphalas ) which replaces the quadrant detector in a typical optical tweezer setup .",
    "the photodiode is connected to an oscilloscope ( 1ghz , lecroy 610zi ) .",
    "the sample is illuminated by an led and imaged into a high speed video recorder ( photron sa 1.1 ) .    the oscilloscope and the high speed video recorder are triggered with a delay generator ( srs dg535 ) .",
    "the high speed video recorder captures between 100,000 and 150,000 frames at 300,000 frames per second ( fps ) .",
    "the oscilloscope records 25 million points in a time span of one second which yields a time step @xmath9 of 40 ns , sufficient to measure the width of the signal of the scattered light during cavitation .",
    "typical images extracted from a high speed video recording of a single cycle are shown in fig .",
    "first the particle is below the focus of the microscope objective which is why it is blurred , then it is pulled towards the geometrical focus where the particle appears sharper .",
    "the cavitation bubble appears in one frame and in the next ( @xmath10s later ) the bubble has vanished and the particle is below the focus of the objective .    a sample of an oscilloscope trace for the scattered light collected by the photodiode is shown in fig . 1d ( black line , 0 - 0.5 s ) .",
    "the bubbles appear at the sharp transitions , labeled as the i - th bubble which is followed by a time interval @xmath11 ( cycle period ) that depends on the size of the bubble .",
    "the frequency of that cycle is @xmath12 .",
    "the red line corresponds to the distance of the microparticle in the @xmath13 plane to the center of the trap ( located at @xmath14 ) where the laser beam is focused .",
    "figure 2a ( left ) shows the zoomed photodiode signal for selected cavitation events and the corresponding images for the bubble and particle extracted from the high speed videos .",
    "we observe that there is a change in the voltage level which corresponds to the particle being close to the waist of the beam ( before cavitation ) and after the particle has been pushed by the bubble below the waist .",
    "the transition signal in between captures the large particle displacement and the bubble dynamics which is why it can have different shapes ( peak or a valley ) depending on the spatial location where cavitation occurs and the direction in which the particle is pushed due to rapid changes in mie scattering by both particle and bubble .",
    "usually the transition starts with a small peak followed by a larger one , hence it is not straighforward to locate the part that corresponds to the bubble . the width @xmath15 of the transition is defined by numerically differentiating ( finite difference ) the signal , taking the absolute value and measuring the time between the two largest peaks ( insets in fig .",
    "2a left ) .",
    "one more condition is that the two maximums ( in the derivative ) have to span the whole transition ( including the smaller first peak ) , in order to get the maximum width and hence an upper bound to the bubble lifetime @xmath15 measured with the photodiode .",
    "this criteria yields 679 events .",
    "we measure the maximum bubble radius @xmath3 from a single frame in the high speed videos where the bubble appears blurred ( fig .",
    ". the error in the measurement of @xmath3 is @xmath16 m estimated by varying the graylevel thresholds that define the edge of the bubble .",
    "we were able to measure 179 bubbles where the image had good signal to noise ratio . to estimate the bubble lifetime ( the time it takes the bubble to fully expand and collapse ) we assume spherical symmetric bubble dynamics @xcite .",
    "the spherical bubble lifetime is @xmath17 which is twice the collapse time @xmath18 that can be calculated using the rayleigh formula @xcite : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the density of the liquid ( water ) , @xmath21 the atmospheric pressure ( 0.1 mpa ) and @xmath22 the vapor pressure at room temperature ( 2330 pa at 20@xmath23c ) .",
    "however there is a loss in the accuracy of the rayleigh formula for nanobubbles @xcite ( since it does not take into account surface tension ) . in this study the maximum deviation should be at most a factor of 1.2 @xcite for the smallest bubbles @xmath24 m .",
    "hence we use @xmath17 to get a lower bound for the bubble lifetime .",
    "the spherical shape assumption is a strong one but it has been used successfully to model microparticles accelerated by cavitation bubbles created at the microparticle surface @xcite .",
    "furthermore , some experimental measurements on the dynamics of photothermal bubbles show symmetric dynamics @xcite .    for some events ( 116 )",
    "we were able to measure simultaneously @xmath15 and @xmath3 .",
    "the plot of the calculated oscillation time @xmath17 ( extracted from the measured @xmath3 ) as a function of the width of the photodiode signal @xmath15 is in fig .",
    "the bubble lifetime predicted by the rayleigh formula is proportional to the measured width of the photodiode signal during the transition : @xmath25 ns .",
    "the width of @xmath15 is an upper bound to the lifetime , so fig .",
    "2b shows that the lifetime is at most two times that predicted by rayleigh equation for @xmath17 [ eq .",
    "( 1 ) ] . deviations could come from non spherical dynamics , compressibility and other photothermal processes that have been neglected .",
    "figure 3(a - c ) depicts the data extracted from the high speed videos ( 179 events ) .",
    "the histograms in in figs . 3a and 3b",
    "correspond to the measured @xmath3 and the individual frequencies @xmath4 respectively .",
    "the largest bars are : 31 events where @xmath3 has values between @xmath26 m and 38 events where @xmath4 has a value between @xmath27 hz .",
    "there are 13 events with @xmath3 between 1.85 - 2.12@xmath6 m , one event with an @xmath3 of 1.6@xmath6 m and no events with a smaller @xmath3",
    ". the individual cycle frequencies @xmath4 are plotted in fig .",
    "3c as a function of the measured @xmath3 .",
    "the red solid line is a fit to an exponential decaying function @xmath28 , where @xmath29hz , @xmath30hz and @xmath31 .",
    "the fit is reasonable up to frequencies of about 200 hz",
    ". this could be useful to estimate bubble size by just measuring the frequency .    the photodiode data ( 679 events )",
    "are shown in figs .",
    "3d and 3e which are histograms for @xmath15 and @xmath4 respectively .",
    "the largest bars in the histograms are 106 events with @xmath15 between 1010 - 1090 ns and 106 with @xmath4 between 63.9 - 75.5 hz . the data in fig .",
    "3d can be used to get @xmath3 by first using the linear relation between @xmath17 and @xmath15 and then solving for @xmath3 in [ eq .",
    ". there are 106 events with @xmath3 between @xmath32 m",
    "surprisingly we get the same lower bound for @xmath33 m as in fig .",
    "3a , considering that the time resolution with the photodiode is much greater than with the video camera and can resolve very short @xmath15 .",
    "there is 1 event corresponding to @xmath34 m , 3 events at @xmath35 m and 17 at @xmath36 m .",
    "the parameters that describe the interaction between a spherical microparticle and a cavitation bubble are the microbead radius @xmath37 , the maximum bubble radius @xmath3 , the initial separation between the microparticle and the origin of the bubble @xmath38 and the displacement of the particle @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "the interaction is described by a mastercurve for @xmath40 as a function of @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "after the bubble collapses the microparticle can stop farther away from the starting point ( repulsion @xmath44 for @xmath45 ) , closer to the starting position ( attraction @xmath46 for @xmath47 ) or at the same distance ( neutral @xmath48 for @xmath49 ) .    during the bubble expansion the particle is displaced in a timescale of microseconds ( repulsion @xmath50 , @xmath45 ) , while the return to the beam waist with optical forces is much slower in the tens of milliseconds .",
    "hence it is expected that the bubbles with the smaller @xmath3 will induce a smaller displacement and a shorter time back to the position of the next vapor explosion . since the bubble starts at the surface of the microparticle then @xmath51 m .",
    "the equilibrium position for @xmath52 would correspond to the maximum frequency since essentially the particle would end at the same spot after the cavitation bubble collapses where it should be superheated again in a very short time producing another bubble . for @xmath49 , @xmath53 m , which is consistent with the smallest measured @xmath3 ( figs .",
    "3a , 3d ) which correspond to the largest frequencies ( fig .",
    "the width in the histograms for @xmath4 presented in figs . 3b and 3e is larger than that for @xmath3 and @xmath15 .",
    "this can be explained considering the random direction in which the particle is pushed which results in different optical forces ( @xmath54 , with @xmath55 the intensity ) and hence different speeds .    the distribution of @xmath3 in figs .",
    "3a and 3d is consistent with the previous measurements @xcite where only 40 bubbles were measured and smaller bubbles were not detected due to insufficient signal to noise caused by poorer illumination of the sample . here",
    "the measured frequencies lie in a larger interval than that reported in @xcite ( 23 to 48 hz ) because in that study the frequencies were extracted from the largest peaks on the fourier spectrum of the microparticle dynamics .",
    "we have measured distribution of @xmath3 which is surprisingly narrow with most values between 2 - 6@xmath6 m .",
    "the size is comparable with bubbles created with focused femtosecond laser pulses @xcite and some photothermal bubbles in nanomaterials @xcite .",
    "the measured cutoff or lower bound for the bubble sizes of @xmath56 m agrees with the neutral displacement regime reported in @xcite .",
    "we also found that the production rate of the cavitation bubbles depends in the bubble size as expected , since a larger bubble results in a larger displacement for the microparticle and a slower return back to the waist of the trapping beam .",
    "the width of the photodiode signal yielded upper bounds to the lifetime of the bubbles which are at most twice those predicted by the rayleigh formula for @xmath17 .",
    "the empirical relations between @xmath3 , @xmath17 , @xmath15 and @xmath4 could be useful to estimate @xmath3 and the lifetime when a fast video recorder is not available .",
    "further studies in the shape and dynamics of the bubbles could include ultra - high speed imaging with temporal resolution of tens of nanoseconds in order to measure the full dynamics and shape of the bubbles .",
