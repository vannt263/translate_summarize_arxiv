    "deep imaging with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) and the nicmos camera onboard the hubble space telescope ( hst ) has been instrumental in pushing the study of galaxy populations out to the reionization frontier of @xmath11 and beyond .",
    "the development of the lyman break technique has been a milestone for the study of high redshift galaxies , as it allows to identify , from broad - band photometry alone , large numbers of star - forming , but otherwise normal , galaxies at early epochs : star forming galaxies at a given high redshift are identified from the drop in flux by , typically , 1 - 2 magnitudes , blueward of the detection passband , caused by the lyman continuum break and the lyman series blanketing induced by intergalactic neutral hydrogen clouds .",
    "while the conceptual idea was worked out already 30 years ago @xcite , it was only in the 1990 s that progress in instrumentation made it possible to identify high-@xmath12 galaxies using this technique ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "several spectroscopic follow - on studies of lbg candidates have proven the high efficiency and reliability of the lyman break technique in identifying galaxies at early epochs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    despite the availability of large samples of high redshift galaxies with low contamination from interlopers ,",
    "the derivation of a luminosity function ( lf ) , and particularly of its faint - end slope , remains difficult on account of the small volume probed by currently available ultra deep surveys such as the hubble ultra deep field ( hudf ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and because of the many corrections which are often not well constrained .",
    "this is illustrated by the large scatter in the published lf parameters that have been derived from the same data sets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "mapping the evolution of the faint - end slope of the lf at high redshifts remains a major goal of observational cosmology , as the faint - end slope is expected to be dramatically affected by reionization ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and a solid detection of a change in slope would be strong evidence for the transition between a partially and a fully reionized universe . as also highlighted by e.g. , @xcite , one important step to improve the sensitivity to changes in the faint end slope",
    "is to derive lfs at different redshifts in the most homogeneous way , applying similar techniques to similar data sets .",
    "this paper presents the udf05 project , a 204-orbit hst large program of ultradeep acs and nicmos observations of multiple fields to study the evolution of the faint - end of the lf throughout the @xmath13 redshift regime .",
    "the udf05 was originally constructed to observe with acs / wfc the two nicmos parallel fields that were acquired while the hudf was imaged with the acs .",
    "these hudf - nicmos parallel fields ( hereafter nicp12 and nicp34 , see fig . [ fig : pointing ] ) , have a total exposure of @xmath14 s both in the f110w ( broad j ) and f160w ( h ) filters , providing the deepest near - ir data available .",
    "only relatively shallow acs data were available at their locations , and our additional udf05 data for these fields was aimed at reaching a depth in the visible , comparable to that of the nicmos observations ( see table 1 ) .",
    "furthermore , the planned udf05 pointings should have had an orientation such that , while acquiring the acs data for the nicp12 and nicp34 fields , parallel nicmos observations should have been taken for the original hudf , so as to obtain a total of three fields with ultradeep imaging both in the visible and in the near - ir .",
    "unfortunately , the transition of hst to the two - gyro mode and the first failure of acs in june 2006 severely limited the number of available orbits at the required orientation , so that the nicmos observations of the original acs hudf field ended up with only one third of the exposure time originally planned .    in our first utilization of the udf05 dataset we study the faint - end of the lf of @xmath7 @xmath15-dropout galaxies ; specifically , we compare the @xmath7 lf obtained from the acs nicp12 field with that derived from the original acs hudf , in order to assess the effects of cosmic variance on the @xmath7 lf parameters . in oesch",

    "( 2007 , in preparation ) we will extend our exploration of the realistic uncertainties in the faint - end slope of the lf of lyman break galaxies to the @xmath11 and @xmath16 regimes , respectively , probing well into the expected reionization epoch and thus constraining its impact on galaxy formation .",
    "this paper is structured as follows .",
    "after the description of the data , corrections for noise correlation and source detection (  [ sec : data ] ) , we describe our selection criteria (  [ sec : colselection ] ) , and the simulations that were performed to estimate the completeness of our source catalogs (  [ sec : simulations ] ) .",
    "the observed surface densities are derived by including the effects of photometric errors (  [ sec : vdropsources ] ) and the lf is computed under different assumptions about the underlying sed distribution of the lbg population as well as different prescriptions for intergalactic hydrogen absorption (  [ sec : lf ] ) . in section  [ sec : cosmicscatter ] we present a theoretical estimate for the effects of cosmic variance on our results . in section  [ sec : discussion ] we discuss the evolution of the faint - end of the lf of star forming galaxies in the @xmath17 redshift regime , and compare our observed @xmath7 lf with theoretical predictions based on a standard kms@xmath18mpc@xmath18 , i.e. @xmath19 .",

    "the hudf acs wfc data are the same as described by @xcite and include exposures in the f435w ( hereafter @xmath21 ) , f606w ( hereafter @xmath15 ) , f775w ( hereafter @xmath22 ) , and f850lp ( hereafter @xmath23 ) filters for a total of 400 orbits .",
    "we used the publicly released hudf images without further processing .    as a part of the udf05 project ,",
    "acs wfc data were obtained for the nicp12 field in the f606w , f775w , and f850lp filters amounted to a total of 101 hst orbits ; table [ tab : obslog ] lists the specifics of these observations .",

    "the udf05 acs observations of the nicp12 field employ a larger dithering step than those adopted for the original hudf ; this choice was made in order to obtain an improved sub - pixel sampling for the nicmos parallel data that were acquired simultaneously , relative to the original hudf nicmos - parallel observations .",

    "the individual @xmath251200s exposures ( two in each orbit ) were combined and re - pixeled to a scale of 30 mas using the task `` multidrizzle '' ; the task `` tweakshifts '' was used to optimize the shifts between different images .",
    "superdarks and superbiases were obtained combining several hundred single frames to increase the s / n .",
    "finally , a herringbone artifact was removed from the data by processing the images with a fourier filter , and the electronic ghost present in the acs images was eliminated by means of an empirical model .",
    "the model is built upon the fact that the electronic ghost of a source is located in quadrants different from the one containing the source and on the fact that acs / wfc is read out from each corner so that if one dithers a source closer to its readout corner the ghost will move in the opposite direction closer to its own corner .",
    "thus , when we drizzle together a dithered pair of images , we align the sources , and smooth out the ghosts . our algorithm ( conceived by l.e .",
    "bergeron ) is based on the idea of flipping each quadrant before drizzling .",
    "this simple step coadds the ghosts and smooths out the sources and , when applied iteratively with proper masking , can be used to obtain clean images of the ghosts which are then subtracted from the images .",
    "these last two steps were developed after the first public release of the udf05 data ( version 1 , `` v1 '' ) .",
    "the newly processed images of the udf05 that we use in our analysis represent an improved `` version 2 '' ( v2 ) of the final products .",
    "the psf fwhm of the udf05 final acs images are about 01 in all passbands . in the udf05 nicp12 images ,",
    "the 10 @xmath26 limiting magnitudes in apertures of 015 radius are 28.49 , 28.44 , and 28.47 respectively in @xmath15 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23   ( see table [ tab : obslog ] ) , i.e. the planned uniform sensitivity in all passbands is achieved . for the hudf",
    "the @xmath21 , @xmath15 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23  10 @xmath26 limiting magnitudes in apertures of 015 radius are 29.38 , 29.81 , 29.43 , 28.73 respectively .",
    "a point kernel was used for all passbands when drizzling the data , with the exception of the nicp12 @xmath15 image , for which the pixels were not shrunken to a point before drizzling to the output frame ( pixfrac @xmath27 ) , as the dithering pattern was inadequate to properly sample the pixels . as a result",
    ", this image is expected to show significant noise correlation .",
    "however , the noise level measured by computing the rms of cleaned , block averaged areas of the @xmath15 images , or by computing the total flux in the auto - correlation peak shows a higher degree of correlation than the one due to dithering which is well characterized by the model published by @xcite .",
    "moreover , some noise correlation is also measured in the @xmath22 and @xmath23 images which were not expected to have any .",
    "the unexpected correlated noise seen in these images is of the same amplitude as the additional component seen in the @xmath15 image and we believe that this residual noise correlation is introduced by the reference files ( flat fields , biases , darks ) and , possibly , by unresolved background sources .",
    "any feature present in a given pixel in the reference files is propagated to a larger area on the final science images by the adopted dithering pattern .",
    "neglecting this noise component would lead to overestimating the depth achieved by the observations ; for example , in the nicp12 field , the noise would be underestimated by 30% for galaxies with an area of 0.3 @xmath28 0.3 arcsec@xmath29 .",
    "relative to our final acs udf05 images , the released acs hudf images , used in this paper , are more severely affected by correlated noise , due to presence of the uncorrected herringbone noise and electronic ghost in acs ( as these effects had not been characterized at the time ) .",
    "this explains why , despite the factor of about two in exposure time , the hudf @xmath23  image is only 0.26 mag deeper than our nicp12 @xmath23   image .",
    "the rms maps produced by multidrizzle were rescaled in order to match the expected flux errors of galaxies with a measured area of 80 pixels , which corresponds to the median size of our dropout galaxies .",
    "no simple renormalization is optimal for all source sizes .",
    "the adopted choice underestimates the s /",
    "n for point sources and overestimates it for sources that are more extended than the area considered ; however , it provides on average , an optimal renormalization for the typical galaxies we study in this paper .",
    "simulations are used to assess proper errors as a function of the sources physical parameters .",
    "source detection and photometry measurements were done with the software tool sextractor @xcite , which was run in double image mode with @xmath23 as the `` detection band '' . despite the fact that the @xmath22 images for both the hudf and the nicp12 data reached a similar , if not deeper , magnitude limit than the @xmath23 band , the latter was preferred for the source detection because of the larger uncertainties in an @xmath22-selected lf , which are driven by redshifting of the ly@xmath30  forest into the @xmath22 passband at @xmath31 , significantly decreasing the observed fluxes .",
    "the sextractor parameters were optimized so as to maximize the number of detected galaxies while minimizing the number of spurious sources . for nicp12 ,",
    "the detection threshold was set to be a minimum of 10 connected pixels 0.55 @xmath26 above the background .",
    "this led to 5,734 objects within the central , highest s / n 11.9 arcmin@xmath29 of the @xmath23 nicp12 image .",
    "similar sextractor configurations returned 6,336 objects in the central 11.2 arcmin@xmath29 of the hudf @xmath23 image .    in order to estimate the contamination of spurious detections in the source catalogs",
    ", we cleaned the images from the detected sources , and reran sextractor using the same configuration parameters on the `` inverted '' ( i.e. , multiplied by -1 ) images .",
    "this contamination was found to be @xmath32 .",
    "a final visual inspection was performed to clean the catalogs of residual spurious sources and stellar diffraction spikes .",
    "the source magnitudes were corrected for the small amount of galactic extinction expected in the field , @xmath33 and 0.008 in nicp12 and hudf , respectively @xcite .",
    "colour measurements were derived from the galaxy iso magnitudes ( apertures matched to the detection isophotes ) , since these are closely matched to the higher s / n parts of the objects and , as shown by our simulations ( section [ sec : simulations ] ) , include much less noise than the sextractor auto magnitudes which we use for the total magnitude of a source in the detection band .",
    "this is especially important for the very compact and faint sources that we study in this paper .",
    "the redshift evolution of synthetic galaxy models , properly attenuated by intergalactic hydrogen absorption , can be used to identify regions in a color - color diagram which efficiently disentangle galaxies in a specific high redshift window from lower - redshift interlopers .    for the identification of a @xmath15-dropout sample ( see figure [ fig : lbg_z5 ] ) , this selection window has been optimized to be ( see * ? ? ?",

    "the elimination of low redshift interlopers is facilitated by the availability of the @xmath21 passband for the hudf sample .",
    "this is however not available for the nicp12 data .",
    "we therefore used the hudf data to check the impact of including or excluding the additional s / n(@xmath21)@xmath37 criterion that was adopted by @xcite and @xcite in order to minimize the contamination from low-@xmath12 interlopers .",
    "only one object was rejected from our hudf dropouts catalog on the basis of this @xmath21-band constraint .",
    "therefore , for uniformity with the analysis of the nicp12 field , for which the @xmath21 is not available , we did not include any @xmath21-band constraint in our selection of the hudf @xmath15 -dropouts sample .",
    "the stellar library of @xcite shows that stars are expected to lie within a very well defined region on the @xmath38 , @xmath39  diagram .",
    "indeed , the few obvious stars in our field lie within this area . to further optimize the removal of stars from our catalogs , the sextractor stellarity parameter was also considered .",
    "this parameter is determined by application of a neural network approach to estimate the likelihood that an object is a point source . however ,",
    "this method is not very reliable at faint magnitudes , and therefore can not be used to identify stars close to the magnitude limits .",
    "inspection of the @xmath38  vs. @xmath39  diagram and of the half - light radius ( @xmath40 ) vs. @xmath23 diagram showed that sources with stellarity @xmath41 , @xmath23 @xmath42 and @xmath43 are most likely stars in the nicp12 ; hence all such objects were excluded from our analysis .",
    "a similar criterion was applied to the hudf for @xmath23 @xmath44 . only two and one of such sources were within our @xmath15-dropout selection window for the nicp12 and hudf samples , respectively ; these objects however had already been visually identified as stars .",
    "although unlikely , stars fainter than @xmath23 @xmath45 and 28 may remain a ( small ) source of contamination in our nicp12 and hudf catalogs , respectively .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : tracks ] the evolutionary tracks of different galaxy types are shown in the @xmath46 versus @xmath47 color - color diagram .",
    "the tracks are built using the population synthesis models of bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) .",
    "the attenuation by intergalactic hydrogen causes essentially all the galaxy types at redshifts above @xmath254.5 to enter the selection window .",
    "elliptical galaxies at @xmath48 are a source of contamination in the selection criterion due to their red colors ; this contamination is however expected to be small in our @xmath15-dropout samples , given the expected low surface densities of these galaxies .",
    "in fact , none of the seven spectroscopically identified passively evolving galaxies at @xmath49 in the hudf from @xcite were selected as @xmath15-dropouts .",
    "we have estimated the possible fraction of interlopers by applying our selection criterion of eqs .",
    "( 1)-(3 ) to a library of @xmath50 synthetic seds built upon bruzual - charlot ( 2003 ) models , adopting the lf derived by @xcite at @xmath10 and no evolution .",
    "the models include the effects of intergalactic absorption @xcite , and span a wide range of metallicities ( @xmath51 ) , dust reddening , emission lines , and different star formation histories .",
    "these included simple stellar populations , models with continuous star formation at constant metallicity , models with self - consistent enrichment during the continuous star formation ( estimated with a closed box model and with a model with infall of zero - metallicity gas ) , and two - burst models combining with five different mass ratios an old ( @xmath52 myr ) stellar population with a young ( @xmath53 myr ) star forming population that includes self - consistent nebular line and continuum emission . for each model , versions with and without dust reddening",
    "were computed ; eight values of reddening were implemented assuming a galactic dust screen with @xmath54 logarithmically spaced between 0.05 and 6.4 .",
    "emission lines and nebular continuum were computed in the approximation of case - b recombination for hydrogen and helium , based on the ionizing flux from the stellar sed ; oxygen and carbon line intensities were derived from an analytical interpolation of a grid of calculations performed with the code _ cloudy _ @xcite .",
    "gas temperatures were derived as a function of metallicity .    the resulting redshift distribution is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mszdist ] .",
    "the non - uniform distribution of the histogram is due to seds that satisfy the selection criterion only for portions of the redshift interval .",
    "for instance a 1 gyr old solar metallicity model with modest extinction satisfies the criterion only for @xmath55 .",
    "we identify three possible classes of low redshift interlopers at @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 .",
    "they are generally very reddened seds with either emission lines or an underlying old population .",
    "the total interloper fraction from these objects is found to be 23% ( 17% if one considered only @xmath59 as interlopers ) .",
    "this is only a rough estimate , as it does not account for the different galaxy populations having different and possibly evolving lfs .",
    "however , previous works show that the utilization of this library overpredicts the number of interlopers ( e.g. with respect to * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; also , in the spectroscopic follow - up survey of the @xmath15-dropout galaxies in the great observatories origin deep survey ( goods ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , only @xmath60 of stars and low-@xmath12 galaxy interlopers were found @xcite .",
    "therefore , the real fraction of interlopers is possibly smaller than our conservative estimate .",
    "note however , that we do not account for this source of systematic error in the rest of our analysis .",
    "the catalogs produced by sextractor are subject to certain biases , which depend strongly on the chosen parameters .",
    "in addition to the detection settings , i.e. , number of connected pixels and sigma - threshold above the background , the parameters that control the deblending and cleaning of sources are of particular importance . the correct interpretation of the lf that is obtained from the sextractor - based catalogs requires a quantitative assessment of these biases . to this end , we performed two independent sets of simulations , the first based on idealized galaxy profiles and the second on the observed galaxies themselves .",
    "the simulations are described in detail in appendix [ sec : detailssims ] .",
    "briefly :    1 .   in the first set of simulations ( which we refer to as the `` idealized - galaxies '' simulations )",
    ", we constructed an extensive set of exponential- and devaucouleurs - profile galaxies , that were appropriately psf - convolved and inserted at random positions into the nicp12 and hudf images .",
    "sextractor was then re - run with identical parameters as for the compilation of the original data catalogs , and the resulting object catalogs were used to identify detected , undetected or blended sources .",
    "this approach is similar in spirit to what was done by the goods team @xcite .",
    "2 .   in the second set of simulations ( which we refer to as the `` dimmed - galaxies '' simulations )",
    ", we generated a set of test images by co - adding to each original image a copy of itself , shifted by a few pixels and dimmed by a given amount .",
    "the composite images were rescaled to have the s / n vs. magnitude relation as the original image , and sextractor was run on these final test images using the same parameters as for the extraction of the original data catalogs .",
    "this second set of simulations provides a complementary analysis to the above , as it offers the advantage of working with real rather than idealized galaxies , and does not depend on uncertainties in the adopted psf .",
    "a problem in establishing the completeness of the source catalogs is that the true magnitudes of the sources are expected to be typically brighter than the measured ones , due to losses of flux from the wings of the galaxy light distribution . @xcite",
    "measured the flux losses for point - sources in the acs camera filterbands and found that they strongly depend on the sed of the source , due to a stronger scattering halo of the psf at longer wavelengths .",
    "those authors find offsets of @xmath61 mag for @xmath15 and @xmath22 , respectively , and @xmath62 mag for @xmath23 in apertures of radius @xmath63 .",
    "to take into account the extended nature of our catalog objects , we used our two sets of simulations to characterize the relation between input ( true ) parameters and output ( measured ) quantities .",
    "idealized devaucouleurs- and exponential - profile galaxies were generated with random @xmath23 magnitudes between 24 to 31 .",
    "two separate sets of tests were performed , the first using sizes uniformly distributed in the range 0.05 to 0.5 arcseconds , and the second using sizes distributed according to a lognormal distribution centered at 0.25 arcseconds with @xmath64 .",
    "the results were essentially independent of the adopted input size distribution . in the following ,",
    "we only use the simulations with uniformly distributed input sizes . measuring the source magnitudes within an elliptical aperture of 2.5 kron radii ( sextractor auto mag )",
    ", compact sources were detected with 50% probability down to 28.75 and 29 magnitudes in the nicp12 and in the hudf images , respectively .",
    "as expected , the detected fluxes were typically smaller than the input ones . by integrating the theoretical devaucouleurs and exponential profiles out to 2.5 times their kron radii ,",
    "the theoretically expected flux losses are found to be 9.6% and 4.0% , respectively , corresponding to 0.11 and 0.04 magnitude offsets .",
    "however , since the kron radii measured by sextractor are also underestimated , the offsets are expected to be even larger than those above . indeed , in our simulations we found a magnitude - dependence for the amount of dimming , from @xmath65 mag and @xmath66 mag at @xmath67 to @xmath68 and @xmath69 mag at @xmath70 for the two kinds of profiles respectively .",
    "we also used the dimmed - galaxies simulations to obtain an independent estimate . in this case , the differences between dimmed and original magnitudes are expected to be smaller than in the case of idealized galaxies .",
    "the offset was indeed marginally smaller than for the exponential - profile idealized galaxies , i.e. , in the range @xmath71 .",
    "for very compact galaxies ( @xmath72 ) , the measured sizes were generally overpredicted due to psf blurring , while the opposite was true for larger objects .",
    "these biases showed a strong dependence on magnitude .",
    "the faintest idealized devaucouleurs galaxies were typically measured to have @xmath73 ( i.e. to be unresolved at the resolution of the hst ) , independent of their original size .",
    "this offers a challenge for studying the size evolution of lbgs with redshift .",
    "furthermore , since we measure the colors by relying on the sextractor dual - image mode , i.e. using the @xmath23 detection apertures , it is not adequate to apply a constant offset to the @xmath15 and @xmath22 magnitudes .",
    "the color measurements depend in fact on the @xmath23 flux as well as on the intrinsic color . both the @xmath39 and the @xmath38 colors are affected in such a way that red sources have even redder , and blue sources even bluer , measured colors .",
    "this is not including the dependence of the psf halo on the color .    in the light of these complex and uncertain corrections for dimming effects",
    ", we chose not to implement any correction to the measured catalog magnitudes .",
    "thus , we note that our magnitude measurements might be underestimated by an amount , as estimated from our tests , of up to about 0.2 magnitudes .",
    "we found , however , that these light losses had only a marginal effect on our final lf when extending it with the sdf ( see section [ sec : veff ] ) ; the resulting slope is steepened by about @xmath74 .",
    "there are two possible reasons why galaxies could be missing from our catalogs .",
    "first , a galaxy might not be detected due to its too low surface brightness ; second , it could get blended together with another source and produce a false catalog entry .",
    "these two effects are strongly dependent on the sextractor parameters .",
    "we used both the idealized - galaxies and dimmed - galaxies simulations to estimate the strength of these effects in our catalogs and final samples of @xmath15-dropout galaxies . specifically : ( a ) we associated idealized - galaxies with similar output ( sextractor ) magnitudes and sizes to real galaxies randomly selected from our original catalog .",
    "we then estimated the completeness corrections for each magnitude bin by comparing the number of sources in each bin of sextractor magnitude with the total number of idealized - galaxies of different input ( i.e. , theoretical ) magnitudes and sizes that contributed to that specific bin of output magnitude .",
    "( b ) using the dimmed - galaxies simulations , we computed the magnitude - dependent completeness corrections by re - scaling the number of galaxies in each bin of output magnitude ( i.e. , recovered for the dimmed galaxies by sextractor ) to the number of sources of different input magnitudes ( i.e. , the theoretical values of the dimmed magnitudes ) that contributed to that specific bin of output magnitude . figure [ fig : completeness_all ] shows the results of our tests . for both fields , the two independent estimates for the completeness in our samples , derived from the idealized- and dimmed - galaxies simulations , are in good agreement . at the magnitude limits of our selections ,",
    "the nicp12 and hudf catalogs are expected to be about 65% and 50% complete , respectively .",
    "the probability that a given source is blended by sextractor with another object depends on the magnitude of the source . in our simulation tests ,",
    "when the sextractor detection blended a simulated source with a real galaxy , we considered the simulated object as a detection when this was brighter than the original galaxy .",
    "figure [ fig : completeness_all ] also includes the incompleteness due to source blending ; this is the reason why even our brightest sources are only complete at the 95% level .",
    "the application of the selection color window discussed above to our nicp12 and hudf catalogs down to 28.5 and 29.25 magnitudes ( with a @xmath75 cut ) produces a total of 101 and 133 candidate @xmath3 lbgs , respectively .",
    "note that for sources whose @xmath15 iso fluxes were fainter than their 2@xmath26-errors , we replaced the measured @xmath15 fluxes with the corresponding 2@xmath26 values in order to get a reliable lower limit on their @xmath38  color .    to correct our catalog for both random and systematic photometric errors we adopted a monte - carlo technique .",

    "however , a top - heavy imf in starbursts is also motivated by theoretical calculations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the error bars on the theoretical curves show bootstrap estimates of the uncertainty due to the finite number of galaxies in the simulated samples ; the numerical runs are very cpu intensive , and it is thus currently impractical to greatly reduce these error bars by increasing the sample size . the dotted black and blue lines in the figure show , for the simple - kennicutt and kennicutt+top - heavy imfs , respectively , the predicted lfs without dust obscuration .",
    "these substantially overpredict the number density of @xmath7 lbgs over the whole luminosity range sampled by the data , but this is not surprising , since the average dust extinctions of star - forming galaxies in the far - uv at high redshift are thought to be quite large .",
    "the solid black and blue lines are the simple - kennicutt and kennicutt+top - heavy imfs models including the effects of dust extinction . at the bright - end of the @xmath7 lf , the simple - kennicutt model with dust extinction",
    "substantially underestimate the number density of bright ( @xmath217 ) @xmath7 lbgs .",
    "the kennicutt+top - heavy imf model is much closer to the observational data .",
    "although this latter model still appears somewhat low compared to the observations , this could be explained by relatively small changes in the dust extinction , to which the model predictions are quite sensitive .",
    "resolving this issue may require better observational estimates of the dust extinctions in lbgs .",
    "another possibility would be that either the fraction of mass produced in bursts or the fraction of high mass stars in the bursts is even higher than in our top - heavy imf model .",
    "the kennicutt+top - heavy imf model also appears to give a somewhat better fit to the faint end of the observed @xmath7 lf than the simple - kennicutt model , although the difference between the two models at the faint end is only slightly larger than the scatter in our estimate due to completeness corrections , input physical parameters , and possibly cosmic variance .",
    "we have presented the udf05 project , a follow - up of the hudf aimed at increasing the area of the hudf and securing two more fields with ultra deep acs and nicmos imaging .    in this first paper",
    "we use the udf05 to estimate the @xmath7 luminosity function of lyman - break galaxies down to very faint absolute magnitudes .",
    "specifically , we use the nicp12 acs field of the udf05 , and the acs hudf for a comparison , to extend the measurement of the lf of star forming galaxies at @xmath7 down to @xmath218 .",
    "this allows us to constrain the faint - end slope of the @xmath7 lf very accurately to @xmath9 , which is in good agreement with the results of giavalisco et al .",
    "( private communication ) based on the goods data to a similar depth as in our work . after this paper was submitted , @xcite published lbg lfs from @xmath219 based on all the available deep acs fields and also their results are in very good agreement with our @xmath7 lf .",
    "attention was paid to correct the raw number counts for selection biases and photometric errors , and to estimate the impact on the lf of different assumptions for the properties of the @xmath7 lbg population .",
    "we find that different assumptions about the lbg galaxy population and intergalactic absorption result in an uncertainty in the density of lbgs at @xmath7 of about 25% .    under similar physical assumptions ,",
    "the hudf is underdense in @xmath7 lbgs by about 30% with respect to the nicp12 field , a variation which can be accounted for by the expected amount of cosmic variance in the pencil - beam volumes we have probed .",
    "a substantial steepening of the faint - end slope is observed from the local universe out to @xmath204 @xcite , in agreement with semi - analytical predictions within a hierarchical galaxy formation scenario @xcite .",
    "further steepening of the faint - end slope above @xmath101 has been reported by @xcite . as discussed by @xcite",
    ", however , the selection window of @xcite is rather broad , and it is thus likely that their sample contains a large number of low - redshift interlopers ( see also appendix [ sec : sdfyoshida ] ) .",
    "this would lead to an overestimation of the bright - end of the lf and thus to a spurious evolution of the lf . our much deeper data , extending about 3 magnitudes fainter than the @xcite sample , show in contrast no evolution of the lf faint - end of lbgs in the @xmath10 to 6 redshift window , and substantiate a picture in which , once cosmic variance is taken into account , the faint - end of the lf of lbgs remains constant throughout this cosmic period .",
    "this is particularly interesting in comparison with the significant evolution shown , over the same redshift range , by the bright lyman - break galaxy population ( see also e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a comparison with our semi - analytical models , specifically aimed at investigating the effect of the imf , suggests the possibility that the imf of @xmath7 lbgs is more top - heavy than a salpeter imf .",
    "other factors could , however , be relevant , such as variations in the dust extinction corrections .",

    ", @xcite extended the analysis of @xcite on the sdf with observations that reached 0.5 mag fainter and were wider in area by a factor of 1.5 .",
    "as both authors adopted very similar techniques and their number counts of @xmath7 galaxies are in very good agreement , we focus on the results by @xcite only . using the combination of subaru @xmath220 filters , these authors defined two samples of @xmath7 lbgs , whose reliability was tested with spectroscopic data",
    ". we can directly compare with their @xmath112 analysis , as this filter combination is sensitive to a very similar redshift window ( @xmath221 ) as our data .",
    "following a procedure similar to the one adopted in this paper , @xcite estimated the selection probability and completeness by adding artificial galaxies to the original images ; they did not correct their samples for photometric errors as we do , but estimated the number of expected low-@xmath12 interlopers by simulating galaxies with colors according to a photo-@xmath12 catalog from the hubble deep field north @xcite .",
    "the best - fitting lf derived by @xcite is listed in table [ tab : lf_others ] ( only @xmath222 sample , for the cases of keeping all lf parameters free and of fixing the faint - end slope to their @xmath111 result ) . in both cases",
    "the faint - end slopes are very steep , i.e. , significantly steeper than the one that we measure from our 3-magnitudes deeper data .",
    "this highlights the need for very deep imaging surveys to study the contribution to galaxy assembly at high redshifts by galactic systems well below the few bright percent of the star forming population at those epochs .",
    "note that we did not use the lf of @xcite which has a larger amplitude due to a possibly significant contamination by low redshift interlopers ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite present the first attempt to derive the @xmath21- to @xmath22-dropout lfs in the hudf .",
    "their approach is very different from ours , as they did not correct for observational biases on the selection of dropout sources .",
    "instead , they assumed that these biases affect all dropout samples equally , and base on this assumption their study of the evolution of the lbgs lf in the @xmath223 redshift window .",
    "they extract an @xmath22-selected sample from the goods v1 data to constrain the bright - end of the lf , and derive the following best fit parameters : @xmath224 mpc@xmath118mag@xmath225 @xmath226 ( fixed ) .",
    "figure [ fig : lfcompare ] shows our fiducial @xmath7 lf in comparison with the estimate of beckwith et al .",
    "the two lfs are in good agreement , except for one datapoint at @xmath227 .",
    "this is a very interesting result , as it suggests that the several effects , which we have corrected for in our analysis , likely cancel out , thereby validating the @xcite assumption , at least for the @xmath7 lbg population . in a future paper ( oesch et al .",
    "2007 , in preparation ) we discuss whether a similar conclusion can be drawn at @xmath11 .",
    "two different types of light profiles were considered for the ideal - galaxies simulations , namely an exponential and a devaucouleurs profile .",
    "these distributions are expected to more or less bracket the whole range of galactic light profiles .",
    "specifically , the surface brightness distribution of disk galaxies was approximated by :      where @xmath229 and @xmath230 are the major and minor axes lengths , the inclination angle @xmath85 is given by @xmath231 , and @xmath232 is the extrapolated total galaxy light .",
    "the coordinates @xmath233 and @xmath234 are measured from the centre of the galaxy .",
    "the disk was assumed to be infinitely thin , which would lead to unrealistic shapes for edge - on systems . to avoid this unphysical situation",
    ", galaxy shapes were simulated with inclinations up to a maximum of @xmath235 . to retain a flat distribution of inclinations in the entire 0@xmath236 to 90@xmath236 range , inclinations @xmath237 , drawn from an assumed flat distribution , were set equal to 80@xmath236 .        with @xmath239 the radial distance as measured from the centre of the galaxy , and @xmath232 the extrapolated total galaxy light .",
    "spherical symmetry was assumed for the devaucoleurs galaxies .",
    "the @xmath240-profile is very steep at small radii , and thus these types of galaxies are detected down to a fainter limiting magnitude with respect to disk galaxies .",
    "the total light is however distributed over a more extended region and therefore , the amount of flux lost in the low - surface brightness wings is larger  than for an exponential profile .",
    "the idealized galaxies were convolved with the acs psf before being added to the nicp12 and hudf images .",
    "the psf was derived from a relatively bright but unsaturated star in the field .",
    "tests with a psf produced with tinytim @xcite , downgraded to the measured fwhm of the observed psf , were also performed , and produced similar results .",
    "poisson noise from the galaxy counts was not added to the simulated galaxies , since at the faint magnitudes of this study the sky background is the dominant source of poisson noise .",
    "tests were nonetheless performed , which confirmed that the galaxy shot noise had no impact on the results .",
    "the idealized - galaxies simulations allow us to relate the intrinsic properties of galaxies to how these would be observed with our instrumental setup .",
    "they suffer however from the limitation of assuming perfectly smooth light distributions , as described by the adopted analytical descriptions .",
    "this is clearly not the case for real galaxies at any epoch , and certainly not for the @xmath241 light emerging from the star forming @xmath7 galaxy population .    in order to have a benchmark to gauge the incompleteness in our samples on the basis of more realistic assumptions concerning the galaxy light distributions",
    ", we performed an additional set of simulations , entirely based on the galaxies that were detected in the nicp12 and hudf fields .",
    "specifically , we dimmed the acs images by specific amounts , and added these dimmed images to the corresponding original frames .",
    "offsets of a few pixels were introduced before co - adding the dimmed and original images .",
    "these offsets were chosen large enough to ensure that a given original galaxy was not self - blended to its dimmed version in the subsequent sextractor run .",
    "since this procedure adds additional noise to the images , the co - added images were appropriately rescaled in order that galaxies of any given magnitude will have the same s / n values in the original and the final image . more specifically :    1 .",
    "a copy of the original image was divided by a factor @xmath242 ; 2 .",
    "this @xmath242-scaled version of the data was shifted by a few pixels relative to the original parent frame and added to the latter ; 3 .",
    "the resulting composite image was divided by @xmath243 , to retain the s / n vs. magnitude relation of the original image ; 4 .",
    "the rms map of this final `` dimmed image '' was obtained from the rms map of the original image ( @xmath244 ) and the shifted image ( @xmath245 ) by computing : @xmath246    the procedure leads to an effective dimming factor for the galaxies fluxes of @xmath247 .",
    "we performed four separate experiments with four different shifts and dimming factors @xmath248 . for each experiment we shifted and dimmed the @xmath23 , @xmath22 , and @xmath15 images by the same amount and reran sextractor with the same parameters as for the compilation of the original catalogues .",
    "we used these `` dimmed - galaxies '' simulations to quantify , in an independent and complementary way relative to the `` idealized - galaxies '' simulations discussed above , the completeness of our catalogs , as well as the scatter in measured magnitudes and colors , as a function of galaxy luminosity .",
    "note that these simulations differ conceptually from the cloning technique adopted by @xcite as we add dimmed versions of the whole acs images to the original tiles rather than inserting modified cut - outs of a subset of galaxies .",
