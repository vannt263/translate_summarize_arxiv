    "a particular class of dwarf galaxies named blue compact dwarf galaxies ( bcdgs , sargent & searle , ) has seen increasing interest among astrophysicists because of their extreme current star forming activity which is in contrast to their apparent `` youth '' in terms of chemical evolution .",
    "bcdgs represent about 5% of all dwarfs @xcite , @xcite and are among the smallest star forming galactic systems known .",
    "one of their outstanding properties is that their optical spectra are dominated by lines characteristic of  regions , which is the reason why they are frequently termed ``  galaxies '' . from optical spectroscopy we know that many  galaxies have low heavy element abundances , typically down by a factor of three up to more than twenty compared to the solar neighbourhood @xcite .",
    "it quickly became clear that these objects must form stars in what is called a burst , otherwise the observed star formation rate would be in conflict with their total gas masses as derived from  observations @xcite .",
    "such a burst may last some @xmath65yrs , with a time span between bursts of the order of 10@xmath66 yrs .",
    "it has been suggested that interaction with companions might trigger their star formation @xcite , but taylor et al .",
    "found that only about 60% of  galaxies have companions , often with masses about @xmath67 of the main galaxy .",
    "one of the most interesting and important issues which has not been settled so far is the molecular gas content of these galaxies .",
    "molecular hydrogen is believed to be the preponderant seed for star formation , so it is a natural assumption that large amounts of h@xmath0 should be present in bcdgs . yet the results have been anything but conclusive so far . following early attempts to detect the co line in bcdgs @xcite , there have been a number of observations to confirm or reject those inconclusive measurements ( e.g. sage et al .",
    ", hereafter sslh ; gondhalekar et al . ; taylor , kobulnicky & skillman , hereafter tks ) .",
    "surprisingly , the results remained partially contradictory , as for instance in the case of ii  zw  40 ( arnault et al . ;",
    "sslh ) , although improved instrumentation had been involved .    prompted by the difficulty to detect the co line  relied upon as a good tracer of molecular hydrogen content  in bcdgs",
    ", some of the pertinent publications prematurely concluded that molecular gas is deficient in these systems .",
    "however , part of the difficulties to detect co might have been due to beam filling and sensivitity problems .",
    "taking e.g. 30dor in the lmc as a template giant star - forming complex , it is clear that , if placed at some larger distance and covered by the beam , it could have escaped detection , as co brightness is rather low there , due to strong photo - dissociation in the high interstellar radiation field @xcite .",
    "the same might be true for bcdgs . in this case",
    ", high - sensitivity mapping might reveal previously undetected co emission .",
    "we have therefore conducted a search for co in gas - rich ( based on ) galaxies , using the iram 30 m telescope .",
    "in contrast to previous projects ( e.g. sslh , gondhalekar et al . ) , our observations not only consisted of single pointings towards the brightest position in the galaxies , but involved mapping a number of positions in them , to detect possible gas concentrations away from photodissociation regions . obtaining sensitive upper limits to the co luminosity in these systems",
    "is as much a goal of this study as detecting emission .    in section 2",
    "we present details of our observations . in section 3",
    "we present our data , and compare it with previous results . in the subsequent section ( sec .",
    "4 ) we discuss possible causes for the detections and non - detections .",
    "this section is divided into three subsections : section [ gas ] deals with the physical conditions of the gas derived from a lvg model ; in section [ metlum ] we analyze the relationship between metallicity and co luminosity ; finally , in section [ factor ] we discuss the @xmath5 factor problem , which has been heatedly debated in the past years and has not yet found a clear resolution .",
    "our conclusions are presented in the last section ( sec .",
    "the co observations were carried out in october 1996 with the iram 30 m telescope on pico veleta in spain . our target galaxies  except haro2  have been selected from the sample examined by @xcite in the 21 cm line of atomic hydrogen .",

    "a baseline of zeroth or first order was always subtracted , and the spectra were summed up to improve the signal - to - noise ratio ; the spectra were finally smoothed to roughly the same velocity resolution ( 5.2  for the @xmath1 and 4.8  for the @xmath2 transition ) .",

    "following the path of sslh , we calculate two extreme line ratios , one assuming the source to be point - like , and one assuming a uniformly filled beam . in the latter case ,",

    "this is also true if the filling factor is @xmath119 , but equal for both transitions ( i.e. in the presence of large scale clumping ) . for a point source",
    "the other extreme is considered : one assumes that the ( 2 - 1)/(1 - 0 ) intensity ratio is overestimated by exactly the ratio of the two beam areas , so that the maximum line ratio must be divided by the ratio of the squares of the two beam widths ( @xmath120 ) .",
    "the results are shown in table [ ratios ] and range from 0.5 to 1.5 .",
    "the differences between our ratios and those of sslh might be partly due to different main beam efficiencies used for the two transitions ( not specified by sslh ) .      the dominant  region of this dwarf galaxy is embedded in an extended faint irregular stellar body .",

    "our deep observations corroborate the difficulty to detect co in bcdgs . only two of the galaxies observed",
    "show significant co emission ; in both cases it is extended in both transitions .",
    "we note here that these two sources are those with the highest metallicity in our sample . in the other sources ,",
    "even with observations towards several positions , we were unable to find co emission .",
    "one could be tempted to say that these galaxies are void of molecular gas , but this conclusion is premature because the relationship of co emission and h@xmath0 content in a galaxy depends on many factors ( maloney & black , israel ) , some of which are not fully understood .",
    "therefore , one can only conclude from the detection of co that h@xmath0 is present , whereas the absence of co does not necessarily imply a lack of h@xmath0 .",
    "as a first step in our analysis , we try to infer some information on the physical properties of the co - emitting gas in bcdgs .",
    "we make use of a large velocity gradient ( lvg ) model to predict ratios for the lowest co lines .",
    "the basic lvg assumption is that of a systematic monotonic velocity gradient , which allows to treat the molecular excitation as a local problem ( see de jong , chu & dalgarno , and white for details ) .",
    "this is certainly an idealization of extra - galactic cloud complexes ; however , an lvg code does not require detailed knowledge of the velocity field .",
    "as a first rough estimate this model further assumes constant density and kinetic temperature within the molecular cloud . in fig .",

    "the figure shows the ratios of the intensities of the @xmath132 to @xmath133 transitions , @xmath134@xmath135 , and that of @xmath136 and the @xmath132 lines , @xmath134@xmath137 .",
    "as discussed above , for haro2 and um465 the line ratios are @xmath138 and @xmath139 , respectively , depending on the filling of the sources in our beam . from our limited mapping of the two galaxies ,",
    "we know that the sources are extended and the `` point source '' limit can be firmly excluded . on the other hand , observations of haro2 obtained with the plateu de bure interferometer ( fritz et al .",
    ", in prep . )",
    "show that the galaxy does not fill the beam of the iram 30 m telescope uniformly .",
    "it is then reasonable to expect a value for the line intensity ratios in between those listed in table [ ratios ] , and may thus be close to unity .    adopting a ratio @xmath140 between 0.8 and 1.0 , we can derive from fig .",
    "[ lvg ] that the gas is either at high temperatures with medium densities ( @xmath141 a few hundred @xmath142 ) or at high densities ( @xmath143@xmath142 ) and low temperatures ( @xmath144k ) .",
    "more stringent limits on volume density and kinetic temperatures require observations of higher @xmath64co transitions and/or @xmath145co transitions .",
    "these transitions are expected to be very weak though , and thus difficult and time - consuming .",
    "we subsequently examine the relation of the co emission and metallicity . because only the two galaxies in our sample with the highest metallicities are detected in co",
    ", one could expect that co luminosity depends on metallicity .",
    "therefore , we plot our co luminosities ( @xmath12 )  listed in table [ osservazioni ]  vs. the metallicities of the galaxies of our sample .",
    "since not all of the galaxies have known metallicities , we are left with only 6 galaxies .",
    "these are shown in fig .",
    "[ lumino ] . in this figure",
    "we also include the data points given by tks because they represent the most comprehensive sample of co observations of dwarf galaxies with metallicity determinations .",
    "we only selected those dwarf galaxies from the sample with metallicities better determined than 0.1 dex ; these galaxies are , however , not necessarily classical bcdgs .",
    "we have chosen the co luminosity because it is largely independent of distance , although the error in the distance determination enters as the square in the co luminosity .",
    "furthermore , the co luminosity is directly proportional to the h@xmath0 mass corrected for helium ( @xmath146 ) , with @xmath147 in  and @xmath12 in kpc@xmath148 .",
    "@xmath5 ( in units of @xmath149molecules @xmath150(k)@xmath128 ) is the well - known but poorly determined @xmath5 factor which relates the molecular hydrogen column density to the observed integrated co line intensity ( @xmath151 ) .",
    "[ lumino ] shows a general trend that galaxies with higher metallicities have higher co luminosities , although no functional correlation is visible .",
    "tks have recently proposed that galaxies with metallicities below 7.9 are basically undetectable in co. our data do not contradict this finding . for galaxies close to that limit we were only able to derive upper limits .",
    "we note , however , that even above that limit there are galaxies not detected in co.    although it is qualitatively expected that a higher metallicity leads to a higher @xmath12 because of the availability of the building blocks of the co molecule , fig .",
    "[ lumino ] shows that the oxygen abundance can not be the only factor influencing the co luminosity . because bcdgs are actively star - forming galaxies",
    ", the uv radiation field may be locally high .",
    "this plays two conflicting roles for co : on the one hand , it heats the gas , so that the excitation temperature is higher and co is brighter ; on the other hand , if hard enough , it destroys co via photodissociation , thus the co emission becomes weaker .",
    "pak et al . and bolatto , jackson & ingalls",
    "have studied these effects and found that the co emitting regions are effectively smaller in low - metallicity environments and most of the carbon is present in atomic form .",
    "the net effect in galaxies with low metallicities is that , due to low beam filling of the clouds , the molecular gas becomes invisible in the co lines and might be better traced in the fine structure lines of  and .",
    "this different beam filling might be the cause for the dependence of the integrated co line intensity @xmath11  on the metallicity found by tks .    to study the effect of the radiation field on the co luminosity , we labelled the values in the co luminosity - metallicity plane with the absolute blue magnitudes of the galaxies ( right side of fig .",
    "[ lumino ] ) .",
    "again there is no simple relation between any two of these quantities .",
    "however , there is evidence for an influence of both metallicity and absolute blue magnitude on the co luminosity , meaning that higher blue magnitudes lead to higher co luminosity for a given metallicity .",
    "it also appears that at lower metallicities a higher absolute blue magnitude is necessary to reach a certain co luminosity .",
    "clearly , more well - observed galaxies are necessary to study the relation between the three quantities .      directly linked to the question of the dependence of the co luminosity on metallicity and radiation field",

    "<S> blue compact dwarf galaxies ( bcdgs ) are currently undergoing strong bursts of star formation . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , only a few of them have been clearly detected in co , which is thought to trace the `` fuel '' of star formation : h@xmath0 . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we present a deep search for co @xmath1 and @xmath2 emission lines in a sample of 8 bcdgs and two companions . only 2 of them ( haro2 and um465 ) are detected . for the other galaxies we have obtained more stringent upper limits on the co luminosity than published values . </S>",
    "<S> we could not confirm the previously reported `` detection '' of co for the galaxies um456 and um462 . we analyze a possible relation between metallicity , co luminosity , and absolute blue magnitude of the galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we use previously determined relations between @xmath3(h@xmath4 and the metallicity to derive molecular cloud masses or upper limits for them . with these `` global '' @xmath5-values </S>",
    "<S> we find that for those galaxies which we detect in co , the molecular gas mass is similar to the  mass , whereas for the non - detections , the upper limits on the molecular gas masses are significantly lower than the mass . </S>",
    "<S> using an lvg ( large velocity gradient ) model we show that @xmath5 depends not only on metallicity but also on other physical parameters such as , volume density and kinetic temperature , which rises the question on the validity of `` global '' @xmath5-factors .    </S>",
