    "stochastic evolution equations have been an active area of research for many years . in the simplest case",
    "these equations are of the form @xmath0 in a hilbert space where @xmath1 is the infinitesimal generator of a @xmath2 semigroup of linear operators , @xmath3 is a wiener process or more generally a martingale and @xmath4 and @xmath5 are assumed to be lipschitz . among studies with these assumptions one can note da prato and zabczyk  @xcite , in which the existence and uniqueness of the mild solution for stochastic evolution equations with wiener noise is proved , as well as kotelenez  @xcite in which the general martingale noise is considered .",
    "the extensions of these results to the case of more general nonlinearity ( non - lipschitz ) @xmath4 , have been the subject of many papers .",
    "there are two main approaches in the study of non - lipschitz stochastic evolution equations .",
    "first approach considers equations of the type @xmath6 in a hilbert space @xmath7 equipped with a banach space @xmath8 with dense embeddings @xmath9 , where @xmath3 is a wiener process with values in a hilbert space and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are generally assumed to be unbounded nonlinear operators that satisfy certain monotonicity and coercivity properties .",
    "this approach is called the variational method . for this approach see  @xcite ,  @xcite and  @xcite for wiener noise ,  @xcite for general martingales and  @xcite for lvy noise .",
    "the second approach is the semigroup approach to semilinear stochastic evolution equations with monotone drift , and considers equations of the form @xmath12 where @xmath3 is a wiener process and @xmath4 has a monotonicity assumption , i.e. there exists a real constant @xmath13 such that @xmath14 .",
    "this approach has first appeared in deterministic context in the works of browder  @xcite and kato  @xcite and has been extended to stochastic evolution equations in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "monotone operators are also called _ dissipative _ operators in the literature and they are generalizations of decreasing real functions . every operator of the form @xmath15 where @xmath5 is monotone and @xmath16 is lipschitz , is a semimonotone operator and vice versa .",
    "hence this approach is a generalization of the lipschitz case .",
    "this generalization is useful since there are natural semimonotone functions which are not lipschitz ; examples include decreasing real functions , such as @xmath17{x}$ ] , or the sum of a non differentiable decreasing function with a lipschitz function .",
    "figure  [ figure : semimonotone ] shows a semimonotone real function .",
    "[ figure : semimonotone ]     the semigroup approach to semilinear stochastic evolution equations with monotone nonlinearities has an advantage relative to the variational method since it does not require the coercivity .",
    "there are important examples , such as stochastic partial differential equations of hyperbolic type with monotone nonlinear terms , for which the generator does not satisfy the coercivity property and hence the variational method is not directly applicable to these equations .",
    "pardoux  @xcite has developed a new theory for the application of the variational method to second order hyperbolic equations . but as is shown in examples  [ example : finite_diemnsional_noise_hyperbolic ] and  [ example : general_parabolic ] , this problem can be treated directly in semigroup setting .",
    "another advantage of the semigroup approach to semilinear stochastic evolution equations with monotone nonlinearities is that it allows a unified treatment of different problems , such as stochastic partial differential equations of hyperbolic and parabolic types and stochastic delay differential equations .",
    "there are other works with this approach , e.g the exponential asymptotic stability of solutions in the case of wiener noise has been studied in  @xcite , stochastic delay evolution equations has been studied in  @xcite , generalizing the previous results to stochastic functional evolution equations with coefficients depending on the past path of the solution is done in  @xcite , a stopped version of   in case of wiener noise has been studied in  @xcite , the large deviation principle for the case of wiener noise is studied in  @xcite . a limiting problem of such equations arising from random motion of highly elastic strings has been considered in  @xcite .",
    "finally , the stationarity of a mild solution to a stochastic evolution equation with a monotone nonlinear drift and wiener noise is studied in  @xcite .",
    "while the literature for equations with continuous noise is quite rich , not many works are done about equations with jump noise . in recent years",
    "some research has appeared on stochastic evolution equations with lvy ( jump ) noise , see e.g. peszat and zabczyk  @xcite , albeverio , mandrekar and rdiger  @xcite and marinelli , prvt and rckner  @xcite for the case of lipschitz coefficients and brzeniak , liu and zhu  @xcite for coercive and monotone coefficients with variational method .",
    "there are a number of works that have considered monotone ( dissipative ) coefficients with additive lvy noise , see e.g peszat and zabczyk  @xcite .",
    "we should mention the article by marinelli and rckner  @xcite which considers monotone nonlinear drift and multiplicative poisson noise on certain function spaces and proves the existence , uniqueness and regular dependence of the mild solution on initial data .",
    "they impose an additional positivity assumption on the semigroup and the drift term is the nemitsky operator associated with a real monotone function .",
    "their idea is to regularize the monotone nonlinearity @xmath4 by its yosida approximation @xmath18 .",
    "we will treat their result as a special case of our theory in example  [ example : finite_diemnsional_noise ] .    in this article",
    "we have relaxed these assumptions , the semigroup is any exponentially growing @xmath2-semigroup on any seperable hilbert space and the drift term is a general semimonotone operator .",
    "our method is completely different .",
    "the main contribution of this article is theorem  [ theorem : continuity i ] in section  [ section : continuity with respect to parameter ] which shows the continuous dependence of the solution of   on initial conditions and coefficients which as far as we know , has not been proved before in the literature .",
    "the problem of continuity , apart of having its own intrinsic interest , is also motivated by several other considerations , such as the study of the stability of models based on stochastic partial differential equations ( spdes ) and the convergence of numerical approximation schemes ( @xcite ) .",
    "we mention below some other works in the literature about continuous dependence . in the context of wiener noise",
    ",  @xcite considers the case that the semigroup is analytic and @xmath4 is locally lipschitz , and shows that the solution is a continuous function of the noise coefficients .",
    "@xcite generalizes this result to stochastic evolution equations with wiener noise and monotone nonlinearity and shows that the solution depends continuously on initial condition and coefficients ( including @xmath1 ) . in the context of poisson noise ,",
    "@xcite proves the continuous dependence on initial data and coeffincients for the case of lipshcitz coefficients and  @xcite proves continuous dependence on initial data and under additional assumptions proves gteaux and frchet differentiability of the solution w.r.t initial data in the case of lipschitz coefficients .",
    "we should mention the recent article  @xcite in which is shown the continuous dependence of the solution of   on all coefficients including @xmath1 for the lipschitz case . for equations with monotone coefficients ,",
    "@xcite proves the continuous dependence of the solution w.r.t initial condition .",
    "@xcite proves the continuous dependence on coefficients in the case of wiener noise with monotone nonlinearity .    in the remainder of the introductory section we provide some preliminaries which will be useful in next sections",
    "the main equation that we wish to study , consists of two noise terms , which are integrals with respect to a wiener process and a compensated poisson random measure . for the wiener process term we use cylindrical wiener processes on a hilbert space , but we mention that the generalization of our results to ordinary wiener processes on hilbert spaces is straight forward . for the definition and properties of stochastic integration with respect to cylindrical wiener processes see peszat and zabczyk  @xcite .    compensated poisson random measures naturally arise when we have a lvy process .",
    "a lvy process is a process which has independent and stationary increments and can take values in a hilbert or banach space .",
    "general examples of lvy processes are wiener process ( brownian motion ) , which is a lvy process with continuous trajectories , poisson process , and compound poisson processes .",
    "for a detailed treatment of lvy processes and its relation to compensated poisson random measures and definition and properties of integration with respect to compensated poisson random measures we refer the reader to  @xcite .",
    "theory of monotone operators is an important branch in the theory of nonlinear equations and has first appeared in the works of minty in 1961 .",
    "@xmath19 is called _ semi - monotone _ if there exists a real constant @xmath13 such that @xmath20 and is called _ monotone _ if @xmath21 .",
    "note that semi - monotone condition is weaker than lipschitz condition .",
    "consider the following deterministic equation in a banach space . @xmath22",
    "the standard existence and uniqueness theorems for this equation , assume that @xmath4 is lipschitz .",
    "in finite dimension , the continuity is sufficient to ensure the existence , but on banach spaces there are examples which show that continuity is not sufficient ( see for example ,  @xcite , problem 5 , p.290 ) .",
    "works of browder  @xcite and kato  @xcite showed that on hilbert spaces if we assume both continuity and semi - monotonicity then the solution exists and is unique .",
    "they also extended their proofs to semilinear evolution equations @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the generator of an evolution operator .",
