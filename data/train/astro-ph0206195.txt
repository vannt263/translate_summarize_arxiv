    "although neutron stars ( nss ) have been studied extensively for more than three decades , the properties of the superdense matter in their interiors still remain an enigma .",
    "we know neither the density nor the composition of a ns core .",
    "we are not even sure that nss are indeed composed of neutrons  for instance , their cores could be pion or kaon condensates or a quark - gluon plasma . a key observational property that would help understand the true nature of these objects is the mass - radius relation  if we knew the masses and radii for a sample of nss , we could compare them with the predictions of models based on various equations of state of the superdense matter , which are quite different for nss of different composition ( see lattimer & prakash 2001 for details ) . a useful constraint can be obtained via measuring the gravitational redshift @xmath0 of lines in the spectrum of thermal radiation emitted from the ns surface ( atmosphere ) , which directly gives the mass - to - radius ratio : @xmath1 $ ] . however , many attempts to detect spectral lines in thermal radiation from isolated ( non - accreting ) nss have been unsuccessful . for example , no spectral lines have been found in the spectra of the vela pulsar ( pavlov et al .",
    "2001 ) , anomalous x - ray pulsar 4u  0142 + 61 ( juett et al .  2002 ) , and nearby radio - quiet ns rx  j18653754 ( burwitz et al .  2001 ; drake et al .",

    "we report the first firm detection of absorption features in the spectrum of an isolated neutron star , .    , a radio - quiet central source of the snr pks  120951/52 ( also known as g296.5 + 10.0 ) , was discovered by helfand & becker ( 1984 ) with the _ einstein _ observatory .",
    "mereghetti , bignami & caraveo ( 1996 ) and vasisht et al .",
    "( 1997 ) interpreted the  and  spectra of  as blackbody ( bb ) emission of @xmath2  mk from an area with radius @xmath3  km .",
    "zavlin , pavlov & trmper ( 1998 ) interpreted the observed spectra as emitted from a light - element ( hydrogen or helium ) atmosphere . for a ns of mass @xmath4 and radius 10  km , they obtained a ns surface temperature @xmath5@xmath6  mk and a distance @xmath73.3 kpc , consistent with the distance to the snr , @xmath8  kpc from the neutral hydrogen absorption measurements ( giacani et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "zavlin et al .  ( 2000 ) observed  with the  x - ray observatory and discovered a period of about 424 ms , which proved that the source is a ns .",
    "second  observation provided an estimate of the period derivative , @xmath9@xmath10 s s@xmath11 ( pavlov et al .",
    "this estimate implies that the characteristic age of the ns , @xmath121600 kyr , is much larger than the 320 kyr age of the snr ( roger et al .",
    "1998 ) , while the conventional magnetic field , @xmath13@xmath14 g , is typical for a radio pulsar .",
    "spectral analysis of these  observations , which resulted in the discovery of two absorption features in the ns spectrum , is presented below .",
    "observed  on 2000 january 6 - 7 and 2002 january 5 - 6 with the spectroscopic array of the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) in the continuous clocking ( cc ) mode .",
    "this mode provides the highest time resolution of 2.85  ms available with acis by means of sacrificing spatial resolution in one dimension .",
    "the source was imaged on the back - illuminated chip acis - s3 .",
    "the effective exposure times of the two observations were 29.3 ks and 31.6 ks , detector temperatures @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "in both observations the source - plus - background spectrum was extracted from a segment of @xmath17 length centered at the source position ; the background was taken from @xmath18 segments in the one - dimensional images .",
    "the source count rates after background subtraction are @xmath19  s@xmath11 and @xmath20  s@xmath11 in the first and second observations , respectively .",
    "the background contributes only about @xmath21 of total counts , in the 0.45 kev energy band .",
    "the lower count rate in the second observation can be attributed to the reduction of the acis sensitivity at low energies with time , apparently caused by increasing deposition of a contaminant onto the acis filter .",
    "the continuum models ( e.g. bb , power - law , fully ionized ns atmosphere ) failed to fit the source spectrum , which deviates very significantly from any of the models in a 0.52.0 kev range , showing two absorption features near 0.7 kev and 1.4 kev .",
    "another absorption feature observed near 2 kev remains uncertain due to the calibration uncertainty near the ir  m line from the telescope mirror coating , so we do not consider this feature further .",
    "we verified that the features at 0.7 and 1.4 kev are not due to uncertainties in the responses and background subtraction and concluded that they are intrinsic to the source .",
    "we also checked that no spectral features at these energies are seen in other  observations with the same observational setup ( e.  g. , observations of psr b105552 and b0656 + 14 ) .",
    "to characterize the absorption features , we use the spectral range from 0.4 to 2.5 kev and model the continuum as an absorbed bb with a temperature of @xmath22  kev . since we do not know the exact nature of the observed features , we use three phenomenological models to check how sensitive the feature parameters are to the choice of model : lines produced by an absorbing layer with gaussian profiles of absorption coefficients : @xmath23\\right\\}~,\\ ] ] multiplicative absorption lines with gaussian profiles : @xmath24\\right\\}~,\\ ] ] lines with gaussian profiles subtracted from the continuum : @xmath25~.\\ ] ] in these models , @xmath26 is the continuum spectrum , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the central energy and gaussian width of the @xmath29-th line , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the parameters characterizing the line depth ( @xmath30 is the optical depth at the line center , and @xmath32 is the relative line depth , when the lines do not overlap , @xmath33 ) .",
    "an example of the fit to the january 2000 data with model ( 1 ) is demonstrated in the upper panel of figure  1 .",
    "the lower panel shows the continuum model from the upper panel and the residuals to demonstrate the profiles of the two absorption features .",
    "including the lines in the spectral model improves the quality of the fit substantially : @xmath34 for 232 degrees of freedom [ d.o.f . ] versus @xmath35 for 238 d.o.f .",
    "we find similar improvement in the fit quality for each of the line models for both observations .",
    "the fitting parameters for models ( 1)(3 ) are presented in table 1 .",
    "the continuum normalization , @xmath36 km , is essentially the same for all of the models for both observations . on the contrary ,",
    "the hydrogen column density @xmath37 is substantially larger in the second observation .",
    "we interpret this as the result of an increased contamination of acis in the second observation which reduces the effective area at lower energies@xmath38 and can be crudely modeled as an additional interstellar absorption ( i.e. , the @xmath37 parameter does not represent the true interstellar absorption ) .",
    "the line parameters for models ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are very close to each other within one observation .",
    "model ( 3 ) results in somewhat lower central energies .",
    "the equivalent widths of the lines , calculated as @xmath39\\,\\ , { \\rm d}e$ ] ( @xmath40 and 1.1 kev , @xmath41 and 2.5 kev , for the 0.7 kev and 1.4 kev lines , respectively ) , are virtually the same for the three models in a given observation .",
    "for a given model , the parameters of the 1.4 kev line are almost the same ( within @xmath42 ) for the two observations .",
    "the 0.7 kev line shows an apparent decrease of the central energy , width , and equivalent width .",
    "we attribute this to the effect of ccd contamination@xmath38 that results in an artificially large @xmath37 and distorts the parameters of the line . since the contamination was presumably insignificant in january 2000 ,",
    "we believe that the parameters inferred from the first observation give more adequate description of the lines .    for the empirical line models used , the best - fit models show residuals suggestive of asymmetric and/or multiple lines .",
    "since the spectral resolution of the detector , about 100 ev at these energies , is comparable to the model line widths @xmath28 , each of the observed features can be fit equally well with multiple line models , with smaller intrinsic line widths .",
    "the observed broad features could also be produced due to a nonuniform magnetic field on the surface of the rotating ns .",
    "reanalysis of the previous x - ray observations of this source has shown no features in the /pspc and /gis spectra , which can be readily explained by the very poor spectral resolution of these proportional counters .",
    "the spectrum acquired with the  sis ( a ccd imaging spectrometer ) does show features at the same energies , albeit at low significance due to insufficient statistics .",
    "the spectral models with two lines , which fit the  spectra , are consistent with the  and   spectra .",
    "attempts to explain the absorption features as caused by the intervening interstellar ( or circumstellar ) material lead to huge overabundance for some elements .",
    "for instance , the absorption feature at 1.4 kev might be interpreted as a magnesium photo - ionization edge at @xmath43 kev .",
    "the fit of this feature with a photo - ionization edge model gives the best - fit edge energy of 1.29 kev , not strongly different from the mg k edge .",
    "however , to explain the strength of absorption , this model requires the mg abundance about 600 times the solar value .",
    "the energy of the other feature , 0.7 kev , is close to the f k@xmath44 ( 0.67 kev ) and mn l@xmath44 ( 0.64 kev ) energies , but even larger overabundance of these elements would be needed to explain the observed feature .",
    "therefore , the absorption in the ism looks improbable , and the observed features are most likely intrinsic to the ns .",
    "there are two potential ways for these absorption features to be generated in the ns atmosphere  cyclotron lines and atomic transition lines .",
    "first we consider that the observed features are cyclotron lines produced in a strongly ionized ns atmosphere .",
    "if one assumes these are electron cyclotron lines , the features could be interpreted as the fundamental and the first harmonic of the electron cyclotron energy @xmath45 kev in a magnetic field @xmath46 or as two fundamentals emitted from two regions with different magnetic fields , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , broadened by the radiative transfer effects and/or nonuniformity of the magnetic field . however , it is difficult to reconcile this interpretation with the expected strength of the surface magnetic field .",
    "the measured @xmath49 and @xmath50 imply a magnetic moment",
    "@xmath51 g cm@xmath38 , where @xmath53 g @xmath54 is the moment of inertia .",
    "this magnetic moment corresponds to a magnetic field @xmath55 g at the magnetic equator , if the field is a centered dipole and the ns radius is @xmath56 km . if the dipole is off - centered , or there are substantial multipole components , the maximum values of the surface magnetic field would be even higher .",
    "although the inferred value of @xmath57 is based on @xmath50 estimated from two observations under the assumption of a uniform slowdown ( no glitches , no timing noise , the ns is not in a binary orbit ) , the discrepancy of the fields looks uncomfortably large .",
    "in addition , the oscillator strength of the first harmonic is smaller than that of the fundamental by a factor of @xmath58 ( at @xmath59  pavlov , shibanov , & yakovlev 1980 ) , so that it is hard to explain why the 1.4 kev feature is as strong as the 0.7 kev feature if we assume the two lines are associated with the same magnetic field .",
    "the magnetic fields of @xmath60 g should exist within the ns magnetosphere , and the resonant cyclotron scattering in such magnetic fields could absorb ( scatter ) @xmath61 kev photons emitted from the ns surface ( e.g. , rajagopal & romani 1997 ) . in a dipole magnetic field , @xmath62 , the resonant scattering of photons with energy @xmath63 occurs at a distance from the ns surface @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the magnetic colatitude . to produce a line with a width @xmath66",
    ", the thickness of the scattering layer should be @xmath67 , i.e. , @xmath68 km for the observed @xmath69 .",
    "it is not clear how two narrow layers ( an analog of the van allen radiation belts in the earth s magnetosphere ? ) could be formed .",
    "moreover , the electron number density needed to obtain a sufficient optical thickness @xmath70 , @xmath71 @xmath72 , significantly exceeds the goldreich - julian density , @xmath73 @xmath72 , often adopted as a reasonable estimate for the charge density in the ns magnetosphere .",
    "therefore , this hypothesis does not look very plausible .",
    "alternatively , one can assume that the spectral features are associated with ion cyclotron energies , @xmath74 kev , where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the ion s charge and mass numbers .",
    "the surface magnetic field needed for this interpretation is @xmath77 g , much larger than the conventional magnetic field inferred for a centered dipole from the @xmath49 , @xmath50 measurements . however , if the magnetic dipole is off - centered to about 3 km below the surface , the magnetic moment @xmath78 g cm@xmath38 gives a surface field of about @xmath79 g. we can not exclude a possibility that the true period derivative is significantly larger than that estimated from the two observations ( e.g. , due to strong glitches ) , which would increase the inferred magnetic field .",
    "however , the ion - cyclotron interpretation of the observed features is not straightforward even in such a strong magnetic field .",
    "an explanation of two features as the fundamental and first harmonic of an ion cyclotron line is unrealistic because the ratio of the harmonic and fundamental oscillator strengths , @xmath80 , is extremely low .",
    "one could explain the two lines as produced by different ions , with @xmath81 .",
    "for instance , one might assume that the 1.4 kev and 0.7 kev lines are due to protons ( @xmath82 ) and alpha - particles ( @xmath83 ) , respectively , in a magnetic field @xmath84 .",
    "the problem with this interpretation is that the strengths of the lines require similar abundances of hydrogen and helium , which is hard to sustain because of element sedimentation in the strong gravitational field of the ns . to avoid this problem",
    ", one could assume that the radiation emerges from a purely helium , partially ionized atmosphere  then the 1.4 kev line would be due to helium nuclei in @xmath85 , while the 0.7 kev line would be caused by ion cyclotron transitions of once - ionized helium ions ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "the required field , however , is so strong that it is hard to expect a significant fraction of fully ionized helium at the effective temperature of about 3 mk inferred from the spectral continuum ( the temperature may be even lower if one applies ns atmosphere models ) .",
    "in addition , such cyclotron transitions should be accompanied by atomic transitions in , at least , once - ionized helium .",
    "the other possibility is that the observed features are atomic lines formed in the ns atmosphere .",
    "the available ns atmosphere models without magnetic field do not fit the observed spectrum , which is not surprising because the observed pulsations require a strong magnetic field .",
    "in recent years there has been significant work on structure and spectra of atoms in strong magnetic fields , mostly in fields below @xmath87 g ( e.g. , ruder et al .",
    "1994 ; mori & hailey 2002 , and references therein ) . based on these works",
    ", we can exclude some possibilities .",
    "for instance , the observed absorption features can not be explained as emerging from a hydrogen atmosphere because , at any magnetic field and any reasonable gravitational redshift , there is no pair of strong hydrogen spectral lines whose energies would match the observed ones .",
    "therefore , one has to invoke heavier elements .",
    "a possible interpretation of the observed features as due to atomic transitions of once - ionized helium in a strong magnetic field , @xmath88 g , has been suggested by pavlov et al .",
    "( 2002b ) ; detailed modeling of the spectrum will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "this interpretation yields the gravitational redshift @xmath890.23 , which corresponds to @xmath9014.2 km  @xmath91 . in that interpretation",
    "the 0.7 kev feature is a single line while the 1.4 kev feature may include several lines which can not be resolved with acis . to confirm this",
    ", one should investigate the detailed structure of the detected strong features with a high - resolution spectrometer and detect other ( weaker ) helium lines .",
    "the discovery of the absorption features in the spectrum of provides the first opportunity to measure the mass - to - radius ratio and the magnetic field of an isolated ns .",
    "measuring @xmath92 is particularly important because it can constrain the equation of state of the superdense matter in the ns interiors , infer the internal composition of nss , and test the theories of nuclear interactions .",
    "our analysis of the low - resolution spectra has shown that interpreting the observed features as cyclotron lines requires artificial assumptions , and such features can not be explained as formed in a hydrogen atmosphere .",
    "the energies of the features suggest that they could be associated with the atomic transitions of once - ionized helium in an atmosphere with a strong magnetic field .",
    "this interpretation yields a gravitational redshift of about 0.17 . to firmly identify the features and measure the gravitational redshift with better accuracy ,",
    "deep observations with high spectral resolution are needed , such that would be able to resolve potentially multiple lines blended together due to the low spectral resolution of the ccd detector .",
    "we are grateful to gordon garmire , leisa townsley and george chartas for the useful advice on the analysis of acis data .",
    "this work was partly supported by sao grant go2 - 3088x and nasa grant nag5 - 10865 .",
