    "on a coarse grained time scale , ionic conduction in glasses is commonly described by a thermally activated jump motion of the mobile ions in an irregular host framework formed by a network former ( sio@xmath0 , b@xmath0o@xmath1 , ... ) .",
    "regions of long residence times in the network are associated with sites , and rare events , where ions move between neighboring sites , are associated with jumps .",
    "the problem how to identify and characterize sites and diffusion paths in such non - crystalline materials poses a challenging task of current research activities .",
    "its solution can be expected to play a key role in approaching a more quantitative understanding of ion transport properties in glasses.@xcite methods developed in this field should be useful also for the description of thermally activated transport processes in other disordered systems .    in recent molecular dynamics simulations of modified network glasses @xcite sites were identified based on the number density @xmath2 of the mobile ions . in some of these works ,",
    "the sites constitute those spatial regions , where @xmath2 exceeds a certain threshold @xmath3 .",
    "the threshold value was specified by requiring the number of these regions to be maximal ( for details of the procedure and the question which of these regions are identified with sites , see ref .   and the analysis in sec .",
    "[ sec : mdresults ] ) .",
    "the sites form during the cooling process in the highly viscous melt @xcite and are stable on the time scale of the main structural rearrangements of the network , which , below the glass transition temperature , is much larger than the time scale needed for the mobile ions to reach the long - time diffusion regime . for the systems investigated,@xcite",
    "the number of sites exceeds the number of ions by 6 - 12% only , suggesting that a vacancy mediated hopping dynamics @xcite should be considered in a coarse grained description.@xcite due to the interaction effects the ionic motion can be strongly cooperative in such situations , as reported by one of the authors , @xcite and also in ref .  .",
    "although the method of determining the local number density in md simulations was by following the trajectories of the mobile ions and by registering their occupation times in small cells ( over sufficiently long time periods ) , it should be noted that @xmath4 can be viewed as an equilibrium quantity with respect to configurations belonging to the metastable attraction basin of the free energy reached after the cooling process .",
    "this means , that in the absence of aging effects , which involve transitions between different basins , @xmath2 can in principle be determined independently of the ion dynamics .",
    "experimentally , a measurement of the local number density of mobile ions with respect to the host structure of the network forming ions is currently not possible . unlike in crystals",
    ", it is already difficult to obtain a reliable representation of the framework structure . the most successful procedure to date is to use x - ray and neutron diffraction data as input for a reverse monte carlo modeling .",
    "@xcite structures obtained in this way are in agreement with the static structure factors and they fulfill certain constraints imposed by chemical requirements . recently",
    "this structural modeling has been combined with bond valence ( bv ) sum calculations in order to identify diffusion paths for mobile ions in network glasses .",
    "@xcite however , while for various crystalline systems it could be demonstrated that both sites and pathways predicted by the bv method match the results from detailed anharmonic crystal structure analyses,@xcite the potential of the bv method for predicting diffusion pathways or sites in amorphous systems needs to be clarified .",
    "since ionic transport pathways in glasses can not be directly inferred from experiment , we test the bv method in this work by md simulations .",
    "the interaction potentials used in our md simulations were derived from ab initio hartree - fock self - consistent calculations and were checked to keep the crystal structure stable under constant pressure conditions .",
    "@xcite this is a severe test of the quality of the potential parameters .",
    "many properties of ion conducting glasses , as e.g.  structural information obtained from scattering experiments , vibrational spectra , values for ionic diffusion and various thermodynamic properties are successfully reproduced by the md model . using the md simulations as a reference to test the bv method , we nevertheless have to bear in mind that the underlying hamiltonian for the interactions between the ions and the way of vitrifying in the md simulations ( e.g.  the high cooling rates ) may not give a fully accurate representation of all properties of the real experimental system . in any case",
    ", even if the representation with respect to the sites and conduction pathways is not perfect , one should expect that the bv method is still applicable , since the md model itself presents a valid physical system .",
    "for the model system , however , the optimal parameters used in the bv analysis could possibly be different from those applied to the corresponding real glass ( cf.sec .",
    "[ sec : bv - analysis ] ) .",
    "our results show that the bv paths entail the sites of the mobile ions in the md simulations .",
    "the bv method yields a reasonable estimate of the number of sites for the mobile ions , but is not well suitable for locating the sites within the pathways . in order to evaluate the potential of the bv method with respect to diffusion pathways , the latter have to be specified from md simulations .",
    "such specification can be done based on @xmath2 , by using the percolation threshold @xmath5 for attributing the regions with @xmath6 to the diffusion path .",
    "we will show that the bv path reaches a sensitivity up to 56% , i.e.  it covers up to 56% of this diffusion path , and , conversely , the specificity lie in the range 50 - 60% , i.e. 50 - 60% of the bv path belong to the diffusion path .",
    "a variant of the bv method recently developed by one of the authors,@xcite allows us , by introducing a penalty function for unfavorable asymmetric bonding situations , to achieve a sensitivity up to 90% and a specificity between 30 - 60% .",

    "the time - dependent mean square displacement of li , o and si ions is displayed in figure  [ fig : gr - msd]b .",
    "the mean square displacement of the li ions becomes normal diffusive at time scales larger than several hundred picoseconds , while that of the si and o ions practically stays constant over the whole time interval . on the time scale of 2  ns , for which most of the calculations for the determination of sites and diffusion paths are carried out , aging effects of the network structure",
    "can be neglected .",
    "during their motion the li ions explore only parts of the host network . to identify the regions encountered by the li ions and their favorable sites , the local number density @xmath25 of li ions is calculated .",
    "dependent on a threshold value @xmath26 , we define a path @xmath27 as the region with @xmath28 , and perform a subsequent cluster analysis of the paths in dependence of @xmath26 . to determine @xmath25",
    "the simulation box is subdivided into a grid of cubic cells with spacing @xmath29 and the time @xmath30 is registered , where it is occupied by a li ion .",
    "the average density @xmath31 in cell @xmath32 is then calculated as @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the total simulation time .    in order to identify regions of high probability of occupation",
    "we determine clusters of connected ( face sharing ) cells @xmath32 with @xmath35 by the hoshen - kopelman algorithm.@xcite figure  [ fig : nr_of_clusters ] shows the number of clusters @xmath36 in dependence of @xmath26 for three grid spacings @xmath29 .",
    "all three curves have the same shape : starting from large @xmath26 , @xmath37 increases with decreasing @xmath26 , since an increasing number of local maxima in @xmath25 is identified .",
    "the strong dependence on the grid spacing at large @xmath26 shows that the local maxima in @xmath25 are sharp . for larger @xmath29 ,",
    "less local maxima and consequently less clusters are found , since the average density @xmath38 in a cell containing a sharp local maximum of @xmath25 becomes smaller and can fall below @xmath26 .",
    "as long as @xmath29 is much smaller than the typical distance between the local maxima one expects that with decreasing @xmath26 eventually all local maxima are resolved .",
    "this is indeed the case , as can be seen from the fact that the curves for different @xmath29 pass the same maximum at @xmath39 . by further decreasing",
    "@xmath26 different clusters merge and @xmath36 decreases .",
    "the discussion makes clear that there exists a plateau @xmath40 in the range @xmath41 , which depends on the grid spacing ( while the value @xmath42 is not affected for sufficiently small @xmath29 ) . above @xmath43",
    "some of the local maxima in @xmath2 are not resolved and below @xmath44 clusters coalesce ( which does not exclude that some of the @xmath45 clusters contain more than one local maximum of @xmath2 ) . to identify clusters with possible li sites one could choose any value of @xmath26 in the threshold range @xmath46 .",
    "this would not change the identity of the possible sites but their size . in order to cover as much volume as possible we use @xmath47@xmath48 for a unique definition of the clusters , which are candidates for sites ( strictly speaking",
    ", one should use the value @xmath44 in the limit @xmath49 , since @xmath50 depends weakly on @xmath29 ) .",
    "the subsequent analysis is carried out for the smallest spacing @xmath51 .",
    "next we study properties of the clusters with respect to their assignment to sites . to this end",
    "we determine the volume @xmath52 of the clusters and the mean number density @xmath53 of li ions on them , and number the clusters in order of increasing @xmath54 .",
    "@xmath55 denotes the number of cells in the corresponding cluster",
    ". figures  [ fig : cluster - properties]a , b , c show @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and the occupation probability @xmath58 for the numbered clusters .",
    "the nearly constant increase of the density is interrupted by a jump after cluster number 17 .",
    "also the other two quantities show a strong increase in this region .",
    "the first clusters are very small and have very low occupation times . after the jump ,",
    "the volume and the occupation time lie on a main branch between 0.6 and 0.35 @xmath59 for the volume and between 50 and 90% of the ratio of occupation time to simulation time . in between there are some outliers with less volume or less occupation time , but above the values of the first 17 clusters . with these results",
    "one faces two problems : _ ( i ) _ summing up the occupation probability of all clusters , one finds that the total occupation probability @xmath60 of all clusters is 70% only . _",
    "( ii ) _ according to the behavior of all three shown quantities  very small occupation probability , volume and occupation time  the first clusters before the jump do not fit to the physical picture which one has of a site .    problem _ ( i ) _ can be solved as follows .",
    "the criterion @xmath61 cuts off the outer fringe of a site , which is visited only a short time by a li ion , but dynamically can be assigned to the site , since a li ion in general returns to the cluster after entering its fringe .",
    "the clusters thus can be viewed to form the core of the sites .",
    "( ii ) _ is more subtle . as suggested in ref .",
    ", one can require that a cluster should only be assigned to a site if the mean occupation of li ions on it exceeds a certain threshold .",
    "however , there can exist sites , which are visited only rarely but which still conform to the requirement of a sufficiently large ratio between the residence time of a li ion on the site and the time for its transition to a neighboring site .",
    "we therefore use a new criterion for the assignment of the clusters to sites by associating two times with each cluster , the total residence time @xmath62 and the total hopping time @xmath63 to any of its neighbors . the hopping time is calculated as follows : when a li ion leaves a cluster and enters a new one without returning , it performs a transition between two clusters .",
    "the hopping time then is the time interval between the departure from the initial cluster and the arrival at the target cluster .",
    "summing over all transitions starting from a given cluster , one obtains the total hopping time from this cluster .",
    "the time interval between the entrance of a li ion into a cluster and the onset of its transition to another cluster yields the residence time , and by taking the sum over all events we obtain @xmath62.@xcite note that according to this definition the residence time includes events , where a li ion leaves the cluster but returns to it before entering another cluster.@xcite    figure  [ fig : res - hop - time]a shows @xmath62 and @xmath63 for the numbered clusters . while @xmath63 fluctuates from cluster to cluster",
    "but never exceeds one tenth ( 0.2  ns ) of the simulation time ( 2  ns ) , @xmath62 shows a more smooth variation with the cluster number as a consequence of a strong correlation to @xmath54 .",
    "in particular , clusters with the smallest @xmath54 correspond to the one with lowest @xmath62 .",
    "the total residence probability @xmath64 of the li ions on the clusters is now 98% , which confirms that the problem with the low total occupation probability @xmath60 is resolved by taking into account the fringes of the clusters .",
    "in order for a cluster to be assigned to a site , we now use the criterion that its residence time @xmath34 should be at least one order of magnitude larger than its total hopping time @xmath65,@xcite @xmath66 figure  [ fig : res - hop - time]b shows @xmath67 for the numbered clusters .",
    "most clusters fulfill condition ( [ eq : site - cond ] ) , which demonstrates that the li motion can be represented by a hopping dynamics on a coarse grained time scale larger than @xmath63 .",
    "only 17 fail to satisfy condition ( [ eq : site - cond ] ) , and almost all of those have small numbers corresponding to low @xmath54 .",
    "this shows that there is hardly any difference here between a criterion based on a threshold number density and ( [ eq : site - cond ] ) .",
    "accordingly , the sites are determined essentially by the equilibrium quantity @xmath2 ( in the metastable basin after the cooling when disregarding slow non - equilibrium aging processes of the network structure ) . in total",
    ", we find 148 sites , which are only 2.8% more than the number of li ions .",
    "this fraction of empty sites is slightly lower than that found in earlier studies @xcite and supports the picture of an ion hopping with a small number of vacancies .",
    "different from the usual situation in crystalline systems in thermal equilibrium , the concentration of vacancies here should be considered as a result of the freezing process and will not change significantly with temperature below the glass transition .    after having identified the sites",
    ", we determine the diffusion path . to this end",
    "we evaluate the percolation threshold@xcite @xmath5 and the corresponding subset @xmath68 of cells , on which the li ions can diffuse across the system .",
    "we find @xmath69 , where @xmath70 covers 7.0% of the volume of the system ( cf.table  [ tab : volume - fractions ] ) .",
    "confining the li motion to exactly the critical percolation path at @xmath71 would yield anomalous sub - diffusion .",
    "however , in our case the percolation threshold is not sharp due to the finite system size and the number density of the li ions takes into account only the mean occupation probabilities of the ions but not their thermal fluctuations . even more important , these issues are not of particular relevance here , since we are interested in the spatial overlap with the bv paths ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : bv - analysis ] ) .",
    "with respect to this overlap the criticality plays no decisive role ( since connectivity properties are not important for the overlap ) .",
    "the development of the bond valence approach has its origin in the search of correlations between bond lengths , chemical valence and binding energies for the chemical bond,@xcite and has been widely applied to crystals with covalent and ionic bonds .",
    "the possibility to approximately describe both types of bonding using the same formalism makes it particularly useful for inorganic compounds with partially covalent bonds .",
    "a review of the bv method is given in refs .  .",
    "we describe the method here in connection with our application , which is the determination of sites and diffusion paths for the li ions based on the knowledge of the si - o network structure . for a li ion to be accommodated in some region ,",
    "its valence should be close to its `` natural values '' , and additional constraints for its coordination number and minimal distance to neighboring ions are to be satisfied ( see below ) .    according to pauling,@xcite each bond in a structure induces , due to its polarity , bond valences of opposite sign ( partial charges in units of the elementary charge @xmath72 ) at the two atoms that it connects . in an equilibrated structure",
    ", the bond valences of an ion induced by neighboring counterions should add to its ideal value ( i.e.  + 1 for a li ion ) .",
    "since the effective overlap of electronic orbitals typically decreases exponentially with distance of the atomic nuclei , the partial valence @xmath73 of a li ion at position @xmath74 induced by a oxygen ion @xmath75 at position @xmath76 is determined by@xcite @xmath77 ,",

    "the cooling rates are much larger than in experiments , the deviation from the ideal bonding situation in a crystal at thermal equilibrium is even larger .    with respect to the application of the bv analysis to structural models obtained from rmc simulations , one should take into account that the information provided by x - ray and neutron diffraction data corresponds to time - averaged positions of the network forming ions .",

    "already for small @xmath112 there exists a large number of small disconnected clusters that soon merge together to form a percolating cluster .",
    "while the majority of @xmath142 belongs to this percolation cluster the fluctuations in @xmath164 prevent @xmath165 to assume comparatively small values for large @xmath166 .",

    "[ sec : mdresults ] but studies of further systems are required to test whether such a prediction is generally possible .    in view of the success of the bv method to estimate the number of sites , we undertook further attempts to improve the level of agreement for the localization of the li sites .",
    "if one distributes li ions more randomly on the path @xmath160 with the same minimal distance constraint @xmath171  ,@xcite instead of doing it row by row as described above , the positioning of centers of sites is no longer biased to the rim of the bv path . in this way",
    ", we obtain 165 bv clusters for @xmath172 .",
    "considering now as bv sites the spheres with ion radius @xmath173   , we found that 75% of these sites have at least one cell in common with one of the md sites found in sec .",

    "still this is not enough for a reliable localization of li sites .",
    "we have identified sites and diffusion paths for the mobile li ions in molecular dynamics simulations of a li@xmath0sio@xmath1 glass .",
    "the identification was based on a cluster analysis of regions with high li number density @xmath2 . for the clusters to be assigned to sites",
    ", we chose the condition that the total residence time of a li ion on it ( including intermediate escape to fringe regions ) is ten times larger than the total hopping time to any of its neighboring clusters . using this criterion , a very low concentration 2,8% of vacant sites",
    "was found .",
    "an attempt to identify the diffusion path and sites by bond valence sums calculations was carried out .",
    "the comparison showed that the core of sites and parts of the diffusion path ( up to about 50% ) are captured .",
    "conversely , the bv method was not suitable to distinguish between regions of high and low @xmath4 , and accordingly not suitable to determine the sites .    when dealing with the md reference data of this work it proves to be necessary to adapt the bv parameters derived from experimental diffraction data to the md force model .",
    "we showed that it is advantageous to optimize or replace the oversimplifying hard sphere exclusion radii for application of the bv analysis to the md model .",
    "moreover , an improvement of the bv analysis seems to be possible by adjusting the bv parameters @xmath78 and @xmath79 to the md force model instead of only adjusting @xmath98 to @xmath93 .    in searching for a powerful method to relate structural properties of the disordered network structure to transport properties of the mobile ions a further approach",
    "could be based on an effective potential @xmath174 . taking this effective potential one could perform a critical path analysis to determine the activation energy for the long - range ion mobility ( see e.g.  ref .  ) .",
    "this approach would incorporate coulomb interaction effects between the mobile ions in a mean field type approximation .",
    "preliminary studies by us show that such coulomb effects are important for the formation of the sites . with respect to the bv method",
    "we have also performed preliminary studies to evaluate the degree of correlation between @xmath175 and the bv mismatch @xmath176 ( or @xmath177 ) .",
    "it turned out that bv method can not clearly distinguish between regions of high and low @xmath4 and accordingly it is not suitable to locate the sites . besides the described shortcomings of a particular choice of parameter values this",
    "is mainly caused by neglecting the long - range li - li coulomb repulsions .",
    "the precise decomposition of the ion trajectories into residence and transition parts described in sec .",
    "[ sec : mdresults ] moreover may allow one to bridge the time scale gap between molecular dynamics and coarse - grained monte - carlo simulations .",
    "given two neighboring sites , many transitions of mobile ions can be followed and the average transition rate calculated .",
    "the elementary rates for the possible transitions can then be used in a subsequent monte - carlo simulation . however",
    ", such procedure is not particularly useful if one is not able to take into account the temperature dependence of the elementary rates .",
    "one possibility is to use md data at various high temperatures , and to try to calculate from them activation energies for the elementary rates ( if these follow an arrhenius type behavior ) . with less effort",
    ", one could use again the density @xmath2 and the effective potential derived from it to determine the energetics of a coarse - grained hopping model .",

    "we note that the vacancies are generated as defect structures in the glassy network , which becomes frozen below the glass transition .",
    "accordingly , their number concentration does not change with temperature ( it may be slightly affected by aging effects ) .",
    "the situation is thus different from that in crystalline systems , where the number concentration of vacancies is in general thermally activated .",
    "the @xmath178 dependence can be motivated by the van - der - waals interaction . however , since this term is used both for distances corresponding to covalent bonding as well as large distances , it in fact is not a van - der waals interaction and often referred to as `` dispersive interaction '' .",
    "nevertheless , the amplitude factors @xmath179 , @xmath180 are usually assumed to scale with the polarizabilities .",
    "this gives reason to include this term here only for the large oxygen ions .",
    "the total hopping and residence time , of course , have to be normalized with respect to the simulation time to give an intrinsic cluster property . alternatively , we could have defined averaged ( with respect to the number of events ) hopping and residence times . in order to calculate the occupation probabilities in fig .",
    "[ fig : res - hop - time]a we preferred to determine the total times .",
    "this reentering mainly corresponds to a local non - activated ionic motion around a site on short time scales .",
    "it also includes rare ( jump - like ) events where a li ions enters only the fringe of a neighboring site and returns without reaching its core .",
    "we note , the local motions can not be simply accounted for by an oscillatory type of rattling motion in a potential minimum ( see j.  habasaki , k.  l.  ngai and y.  hiwatari , j.  chem .",
    "phys .   * 122 * , 054507 ( 2005 ) ) .",
    "differences among possible definitions of ion sites are not relevant for our comparison of sites and paths derived from md simulations with those derived from the bv method in the present work .",
    "this holds because the volume of the clusters being excluded is small . for other purposes , for example ,",
    "if one wants to discuss the microscopic mechanism of jumps , it could be important to consider a more careful determination of the threshold value for the @xmath62 to @xmath63 ratio ( see , for example , the discussion in ref .  ) .            in other bv studies an additional `` sign criterion ''",
    "is often used in order to avoid an erroneous classification due to the limited cell resolution . in this case a cell is also marked as accessible if a li ion at its center fails to fulfill requirement _ ( iii ) _ , but on the other hand @xmath176 at one of the centers of the nearest neighboring cells has opposite sign .",
    "however , in our case the cell resolution is fine enough so that this problem plays no role for all relevant @xmath112 considered in the subsequent analysis .",
    "this definition of specificity deviates from the usual one , as it is , for example , often applied in medical studies . in such studies",
