    "the experimental absence of the ether had been explained away , and the 4-dimensional unification of electricity and magnetism was one of the theoretical triumphs of the early 20th century .",
    "the foundation was laid for one of the great edifices of modern physics : general relativity .    in a different part of the world of physics ,",
    "simultaneously with these advances , the apparently completely different field of thermodynamics and heat emission had given birth to the quantum .",
    "the infant came into the scene dissipating the second of lord kelvin s famous  clouds \" over physics : the then experimentally disproved law of black - body radiation .",
    "the newborn was destined for greatness , and it did not disappoint . under the teenage guise of quantum mechanics , and its later adult incarnation , quantum field theory , it dominated much of modern theoretical and experimental physics .",
    "both fields grew up side by side basking in glory after glory , with relativity perhaps reaching its maturity earlier than quantum mechanics , being put into its present form already in 1916 .",
    "after the teenage years , under the auspices of schrdinger , klein , gordon , and most prominently dirac , the two met and the encounter evolved quantum mechanics into quantum field theory , arguably the most successful theory ever developed . on the other hand ,",
    "general relativity remained largely unmoved by quantum mechanics .",
    "as it stands however , quantum field theory is not the final word in this tale .",
    "it incorporates at best a sterile version of general relativity , one in which quantum fields are not allowed to feed back into the geometry of space - time .",
    "at worst , it still requires a structure that allows one to separate space - time into space and time , thereby foiling minkowski s grandiose prediction . in spite of valiant attempts by many physicists over the past 80 years",
    ", it remains true that the two theories are not completely on talking terms .",
    "our objective in the present thesis is to give an alternative view of gravity , one which breaks away from space - time  indeed breaks space - time  into space and time .",
    "this might seem at first like a step back .",
    "but as we will see , many other conceptual challenges are resolved by the approach advertised in this thesis . in so",
    "doing we hope to remove the most glaring point of conceptual disagreement between our two protagonists : the different notions of _ time _ each one clings to . or",
    ", being a little more conservative , we hope to at least smooth out the issue to the point where a compromise can be reached and gravitational phenomena be made more sympathetic to quantum mechanics .      it is no secret that time plays very different roles in quantum field theory and general relativity . in the former time is part of an absolute framework with respect to which dynamical operators ( or states ) are defined , but in the latter everything is dynamical .",
    "this mismatch is the source of many great difficulties encountered in the attempts to create an overarching unified framework of quantum gravity @xcite .    in the canonical formulation ,",
    "more amenable to a standard quantum theoretical treatment , space - time is essentially ` sliced - up ' , and einstein s equations are described as an evolution of the geometry of spatial slices through time . in effect",
    ", one attempts to revert to separate notions of space and time as much as possible to be able to apply the hamiltonian analysis .",
    "it is in this formulation that we can see most clearly some of the problems that relativistic ",
    "time \" creates in the quantization of gravity .",
    "the adm formulation of the einstein equations @xcite leads directly to constraints .",
    "these constraints are such that they are associated with  symmetries \" of the system , symmetries whose action generate certain transformations of the physical description of the universe .    one set of constraints , known collectively as the momentum constraint , is associated with foliation - preserving 3-diffeomorphisms . in other words ,",
    "its action preserves the  slicing \" , and thus the separation of space - time into space and time remains intact .",
    "this action has a well defined group representation on phase space , which simplifies its treatment considerably .",
    "only a single initial configuration of the universe is needed to obtain the resulting final configuration under the action of the symmetry .",
    "moreover this is valid for the finite ( as opposed to infinitesimal ) action of the group , a property which does not hold for the remaining constraints , as we will see .",
    "these characteristics make it fairly simple to quotient out the symmetry associated to the momentum constraint , eliminating its related unphysical degrees of freedom . the resulting quotient space , called _ superspace _ , parametrizes initial data obeying the constraint , and is the proper physical arena that eliminates the redundancy generated by that symmetry .",
    "the other set of constraints , which we denote by @xmath0 , is called _ the hamiltonian constraint _ , and it generates evolution of the spatial variables . already at the classical level",
    "a severe problem immediately arises . because there is an @xmath0 constraint at each space point , generating evolution independently , the time evolution is `` many fingered '' , which means that the spatial slices can be made to evolve at arbitrarily chosen different rates at different points .",
    "in contrast to the action of 3-diffeomorphisms , this  symmetry \" changes the original decomposition of space - time into space and time . by generating different foliations of space - time",
    ", it yields curves in phase space that bear no simple relationship to each other ( see figure [ fig : foliations ] ) . unlike the momentum constraints ,",
    "it does not , by itself , have a group action on phase space , and one can not straightforwardly quotient phase space .",
    "dirac , when speaking about the difference between the constraints ( in the setting of quantum theory ) phrased it in the following simple way @xcite :  thus we have the situation that we can not specify the initial state for a problem without solving the equations of motion .",
    "the formalism is thus not suitable to dealing with practical problems . \" and therein lies the problem : to quotient out the symmetry and obtain the physical configuration space , one must basically solve the equations of motion .",

    "furthermore , it has a different symmetry group than general relativity and carries a  proper \" group action on the gravitational variables . as we put it , in shape dynamics ( sd )",
    "we are in the business of symmetry  trading \" .",
    "it will be a theory of gravity in the sense that the solutions of a particular gauge fixing of general relativity are equivalent to the solutions of a particular gauge fixing of the new symmetry in the present theory .",
    "the new symmetry is that of 3-dimensional conformal transformations , i.e. , transformations that change local scale .",
    "these transformations act truly as a symmetry group in the phase space of general relativity .",
    "their simple linear action allows us to easily track the effect of the symmetry transformations and eliminate their associated redundancy ( i.e. , we can quotient by their action ) .",
    "we thus obtain the space of physical configurations called _ conformal superspace _ , or , more lyrically , _",
    "shape space_. it is the natural setting for a description of the universe which relies solely on the  shape of space \" .",
    "in such a description , spatial angles take the forefront , while local size is relegated to a quantity measured only with respect to an arbitrary local scale .    in this new formulation ,",
    "we replace evolution generated by infinitely many local hamiltonian constraints by evolution generated by a unique single global constraint @xmath1 .",

    "this thesis is formed from two separate but deeply related subjects : the construction of a theory of gravity embodying a different symmetry principle , called _ shape dynamics _ ( sd ) , and the construction of a gauge theory for the configuration space of general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "we try to pursue our proofs to the point where only subtle technical functional - analytic matters , such as domains in frecht spaces etc , start to appear .",
    "even though we do not present full mathematical proofs to the bitter end taking these issues into account , we give strong plausibility arguments of why they should go through without a hitch .",
    "this thesis is a merger of two independent but very much interrelated lines of research .",
    "one is the construction of the theory of shape dynamics , which takes a leading role and is very prominent in the present work .",
    "the other is the working out of specific geometric gauge theoretic structures in the configuration space of gr .",
    "the former is a self - contained theory , with a robust conceptual background .",
    "the latter is a conceptual framework , or the development of a set of tools , that can be applied in the future to , among other things , the theory of shape dynamics itself .",
    "we have chosen in this thesis to keep the background material for the two sections separate .",
    "it seemed more pedagogic to distinguish the technical background necessary for each part , and only after both edifices have been constructed to bridge them , although of course by then the reader will already see a clear connection between the two parts .",
    "this approach has its drawbacks ; it is not always possible to keep the two parts completely separate . in particular , we have three cases where one section must borrow from the other , or vice - versa . one of these instances happens when we explain barbour s best - matching ideas , and find that the ideal way to explain them is to use almost exclusively the technical material present in part ii , defining gauge structures in riem , the space of 3-metrics ( chapter [ sec : riem ] ) .",
    "a second instance is that we use the fredholm alternative when studying the asymptotically flat case of shape dynamics in chapter [ chapter : sd_af ] .",
    "lastly , we give an intuitive geometrical picture of shape dynamics , and we must also mention the use of a section for the conformal bundle , presented also in chapter [ sec : riem ] . for this item , we had no option but to include it in the first part of the thesis .",
    "we could have as easily included the first and last items in part ii of the thesis and made reference to part i , or vice - versa , but although they might be less displaced technically if placed in part ii , we find them conceptually better situated in part i.      we explicitly mention only a few of the items individually , those that may be more confusing to the reader without further explanations .

    "now , upon variation and integration by parts , assuming that the system is fixed at both initial and final configurations , one obtains from the least action principle @xmath46 the euler  lagrange equations : [ equ : euler - lagrange]= .",
    "we chose to use the notation @xmath47 as opposed to @xmath48 because this generalizes the partial derivatives directly to functional derivatives in the infinite dimensional case , just as the sum indicated by repeated indices generalizes to integrals .",
    "if we use the chain rule for the @xmath49 derivative , we get from : [ equ : accel_lagrange ] q^+q^ = .from this it becomes clear that the accelerations are uniquely determined by the positions and velocities if and only if the matrix @xmath50 is invertible .",
    "if it is nt , our system possesses some kind of redundancy in its description , and this is indicative of _ gauge symmetries_.    although the euler  lagrange equations derived from variation of the lagrangian completely describe the dynamics of the system , it is a rather cumbersome ordeal to obtain directly from them information about redundancy in the description of the system .",
    "the more suitable method to unravel such information is to use the hamiltonian formalism .      for hamiltonian dynamics ,",
    "we seek to perform a change of variables @xmath51 , where [ equ : def_can_momenta]p_:=. in other words , one defines the action of the _ legendre transform _ as @xmath52 . here",

    ". then @xmath65 and we can see that the linear functional , at @xmath66 , is just given by @xmath67 , which is indeed an element of the cotangent space , and parametrizes the momenta with the position and velocity vectors .    as it happens however , under usual assumptions the map @xmath68 might not be injective nor surjective .",
    "in particular the full @xmath56 might not be accessible to the dynamical system . however , this is far from being a disadvantage of the hamiltonian approach .",
    "quite the contrary , a dynamical system may possess some redundancy in its description ",
    "one is in fact  over - parametrizing \" it  and this property of the hamiltonian approach is a warning sign that the system has this feature .",
    "let us see how this is related , in the lagrangian approach , to the unique determination of the accelerations from the velocities and positions .",
    "the condition for the map @xmath68 to be ( at least locally ) an isomorphism is that the block diagonal matrix be invertible .",
    "since one of the blocks contains the identity i d ( this is just the matrix @xmath69 ) , we arrive at the same condition imposed from equation that such a situation reflects the fact that = = m _ has to be invertible .",
    "the constraints on @xmath56 that we get usually form submanifolds of @xmath56 ( this relies on our assumption that the rank of @xmath70 is constant ) ) and can thus be put in the form of functionals of @xmath56 , let us say @xmath71 , which implicitly define the said manifolds ( see the _ regular value theorem _ [ theo : regular_value ] ) .",
    "the regularity assumption of constant rank and the further assumption that the constraints are _ _ irreducible _ _ are linearly independent ,",
    "i.e. , that the one forms @xmath72 are linearly independent , i.e. , that we have an irreducible set of constraints . if they were not , we would have to choose a basis for the constraints .",
    "] , implies again from theorem [ theo : regular_value ] that the @xmath73 form a complete coordinate system in phase space for _ the complement of _ the constraint surface .",
    "for example , if we had a 4-dimensional phase space with two sets of irreducible constraints , theorem [ theo : regular_value ] guarantees that we can find coordinates in phase space , @xmath74 , such that @xmath75 parametrize the constraint surface and @xmath76 are given by the two constraint functions .",
    "this has the strong consequence that a vector @xmath77 is tangent to the constraint surface _ if and only if _ @xmath78=0 $ ] .",
    "the fact that @xmath77 is tangent to the constraint surface already implies the  if \" part , since @xmath79 on the entire constraint surface it does nt change along @xmath77 .",
    "the `` only if '' part is a result of writing everything in a coordinate system and on the fact that indeed we have a complete coordinate system as mentioned above .",
    "such constraints , arrived at from the sole definition of the momenta , are called _ primary _ , in allusion to the fact that the equations of motion need not be used to derive them . in lagrangian variables ,",
    "these relations are merely identities , as we will see in practice in section [ sec : constructionprinciple ] .",
    "it follows that the inverse transformation from the momenta to the velocities , even when we restrict ourselves to the constraint surface , is multi - valued .",
    "given a point in phase space that fulfills the constraints , the  inverse image \" through @xmath80 is not unique , and in order to render it single - valued , and thereby indicate the location of the velocities @xmath81 on the inverse manifold , one needs to introduce extra parameters in at least the same number as there are primary constraints .",
    "these parameters will appear as lagrange multipliers in the hamiltonian formulation .",
    "thus we can see that we do not fully characterize dynamical redundancy solely by restricting ourselves to the constraint surface .",
    "dynamical redundancy , or symmetry , is present in the lagrangian characterization of the system as much as in the hamiltonian .",
    "the transform @xmath68 being injective signifies that a restriction to the constraint surface ( the image of @xmath68 ) still  includes \" the full lagrangian characterization , symmetries and all .",
    "part of the power of the hamiltonian formulation is exactly that it gives us a starting point to study redundancy in the description of dynamical systems , so let us get to it .",
    "the canonical hamiltonian is defined as [ equ : def : can_hamiltonian]h_0:=p^q_-l .if we compute the variation of , we get @xmath82 as the total variation depends only on the variation of @xmath83 and @xmath58 , this means that @xmath40 enters @xmath84 only in the precise combination that gives @xmath59 , and thus the non - trivial dependence of the hamiltonian can be set to be just @xmath85 .",
    "since the system can only access the surfaces in @xmath56 defined by @xmath71 , and the hamiltonian is a function of @xmath86 , one would be inclined to conclude that we may arbitrarily extend the hamiltonian in @xmath56 out of the surface : [ equ : def_h_1 ] h_1=h_0+_i^i(q , p)h_0,where we introduced the notation @xmath87 to mean _ weak equality _ ; i.e. , equalities that are valid only over the constraint surface .",
    "here we are summing over the @xmath88 index , and @xmath89 is an arbitrary coefficient .",
    "these extra parameters could then be seen as coordinates on @xmath53 that determine the exact position ( a  height \" ) over the inverse images of the momenta .",

    "construct initial data _ for gr using three - dimensional conformally invariant initial data , a conformally invariant version of general relativity - with its own sets of conformally invariant constraints and evolution equations - was not developed .",
    "the use of the conformal factor was input by hand to aid in the solvability of an equation .",
    "it did not involve any sort of canonical analysis and thus did not contain stronger statements about the dynamical system as a whole .",
    "the first important step towards solving the initial value problem for gr , given by and , was taken by lichnerowicz @xcite .",
    "he did so by realizing that if @xmath210 is _ traceless _ , then the means @xmath210 must also be divergenceless , or _ transverse_.    now , transverse traceless ( tt ) tensors are equivariant with respect to conformal transformations .",
    "that is , if @xmath246 is a @xmath247 tensor with respect to @xmath2 , conformal transformations act on @xmath248 in such a way that the conformally transformed @xmath246 is tt with respect to the transformed metric . for more information on this ,",
    "see section [ sec : york_splitting ] .",
    "there we also show that if @xmath3 transforms as @xmath249 then @xmath248 must transform as @xmath250 .",
    "a short explanation for this conformal weighing is that , besides the usual @xmath251 factor , the @xmath252 coming from the density @xmath253 must be compensated for .    alternatively , in the language of inner products of metric velocities in riem ( see chapter [ sec : riem ] ) , to maintain the conformal invariance of the superspace inner product",
    ", one must demand that the lapse have the conformal weight given in definition , section [ sec : conformal_diff_group ] .",
    "then straightforwardly yields the appropriate weight .",
    "a more straightforward procedure is to not use the extrinsic curvature formulation , but the momentum one .",
    "then , calling @xmath254 the traceless part of @xmath255 we get the weighting : @xmath256 which matches the conformal weight associated with the momenta in the rest of this work . we shall call @xmath257 a choice of transverse @xmath254 .    now since a conformal change in the tt tensor will still satisfy the momentum constraint , one can choose an arbitrary one and try to solve for it the modified scalar constraint , given from as [ equ : modified s ] -|r+=0 where @xmath258 is the conformally transformed ricci scalar obtained from : [ equ : ricciconf]|r = r[^4 g]=-8 ^ -5_g^2 + r[g]^-4 .it is sometimes useful to rewrite this as : [ equ : ricciconf2]r[^4 g]=^-5(-8_g^2 + r[g ] ) .",
    "the scalar constraint thus becomes : [ equ : lich]8 ^ 2 -r+^-7=0 of course , only makes sense if we can find a conformal transformation that makes @xmath258 positive everywhere .",
    "such metrics are said to be in the positive yamabe class , and this imposes a restriction on initial data to belong to this class .    in 1970 ,",
    "james york contributed to the program by adding a constant trace term to the tt momenta @xmath259 , where @xmath260 is a spatial constant . with this simple addition",
    ", the scalar constraint as an equation for the conformal factor becomes : [ equ : ly ] 8 ^ 2 -r+^-7-^5c^2=0 .",
    "as long as @xmath261 , this places no restriction on the scalar curvature ab initio . in @xcite , york and omurchadha , using leray ",
    "schauder degree theory , showed that the specific form of the polynomial in @xmath242 , @xmath262 , implies that , as long as @xmath263 , equation always possesses a unique solution .",
    "we will not go into details of the proof , as it is involved and requires too much background material .",
    "the important point is that the initial value problem was shown to be solvable for any choice of metric , tt tensor , and non - zero constant @xmath260 .",
    "the initial data that are constructed have constant trace of the extrinsic curvature and are thus called a constant  mean  curvature ( cmc ) solution to the constraints . from the physics point of view , this method , which did not arise in any way from canonical analysis , has been regarded as a felicitous  device \" for solving the initial  value problem , which distances the ly method from shape dynamics .",
    "it did not yield , as stressed in the beginning of the section , a conformally invariant theory .",
    "we will have further comments on the mathematical similarities once we have presented shape dynamics in its full form , at the end of chapter [ sec : sd_cmc ] .      in 1958 , dirac @xcite saw the need to fix the foliation of gr for the hamiltonian framework , as a step for quantization . in effect",
    "( as we later discovered ) , he essentially describes the steps we take in chapter [ chapter : sd_af ] after enforcing the gauge fixing .",
    "indeed , the gauge - fixing that he attempts to work with , and deems the most natural , is given by @xmath264 .",
    "let us briefly review the main steps .",
    "after basically ( re)constructing the 3 + 1 decomposition and the constraints , defining the dirac bracket , and pinpointing foliation invariance as the main obstacle to quantizing gr , all in under 4 pages , dirac recognized that a more powerful approach to quantizing gr would be to fix the gauge of the scalar constraint , after which it would no longer be required as an operator equation on a wave - functional .",
    "he then proceeded to show how one would go about doing that .    in the general",
    "setting of dynamical systems , he abstractly described the method contained in section [ sec:1stclass_vs_2nd ] and introduced a gauge fixing in a manner which we now describe .",
    "suppose there are initially @xmath265 first class constraints .",
    "introduce @xmath266 gauge - fixing constraints , all second class with respect to the initial constraints .",
    "thus there are now @xmath267 second class constraints , and we must separate the first and second class sets of constraints . as",
    " there is no room for second class constraints in the quantum theory \" , we must either use the dirac bracket , or completely solve for the second class ones .",
    "the two procedures are equivalent .",
    "suppose that @xmath102 of the second class constraints are of the form @xmath268 , where @xmath269 is the momentum conjugate to @xmath270 .",
    "that means that the remaining second  class constraints must contain all of the coordinates @xmath271 in a linearly independent manner , otherwise there would be at least one @xmath269 which would still be first  class .",
    "this means it might in principle be possible to solve the remaining second class constraints for @xmath270 , i.e. : [ equ : diracs_solution ] q_n = f_n(q_n+1,,p_n+1 , ) then using equation and @xmath272 we can completely eliminate these variables from the system ( and obviate the need for a dirac bracket ) , as they play no effective role .",
    "we will not get to grips with exactly how dirac effectively performed this fixing with @xmath264 in this section , but leave it for section [ chapter : sd_af ] , where a better description and direct comparison are more natural .",
    "we pause to mention that this procedure basically outlines what we will do with general relativity to arrive at sd .",
    "the major departure from dirac is that we will introduce extra degrees of freedom , and thus our equation analogous to @xmath272 will be given by @xmath273 , and a good part of our efforts will be devoted to proving that we can indeed solve the remaining second class constraints for @xmath242 as a functional of @xmath274 , culminating in theorem [ prop ] .",
    "dirac s procedure , unlike ours , is not coordinate independent , but if put on a firmer grounding ( in other aspects as well ) might well have culminated in our results for asymptotically flat sd , of chapter [ chapter : sd_af ] .",
    "however the manner in which we perform our trading explicitly maintains conformal symmetry to very significant advantage .",
    "nonetheless , however unwittingly , dirac s attempt implicitly used conformal methods applied to the quantization of gravity .",
    "the most influential of all previous work on conformal methods however came from barbour et al , in work contained in various papers : @xcite and especially @xcite .",
    "we will try to keep the account of this beautiful body of work to a minimum .",
    "we do this in the interest of brevity , but more importantly , this work is more eloquently described than what we would be able to achieve here in various sources ( for the most updated , complete and masterfully written account , see @xcite , whose reading we strongly encourage ) .",
    "we would fear misrepresenting the area in any attempt to be complete .      to introduce some of the main ideas ,",
    "let us consider a newtonian system of @xmath102 particles .",
    "although it seems completely transparent when expressed in an inertial frame of reference , from the relational point of view the dynamics are not determined uniquely from initial interparticle separations and their rates of change .",
    "one also needs as extra data the angular momentum of the entire system , which is not encoded in such data . for a relationalist ,",
    "this is disturbing , as was already noted by poincar .",
    "this discrepancy led barbour to formulate what he called the poincar principle .",

    "best matching_. to explain it in a simpler setting than geometrodynamics first , let us consider a system of 3 particles in euclidean space @xmath281 .",
    "any three particles form a triangle @xmath282 at any given moment @xmath283 , and another triangle @xmath284 at @xmath285 . to define the infinitesimal motion happening during an infinitesimal interval of time",
    ", we have to first find out what would _ not _ constitute a motion , i.e. , what is deemed to leave the physical configuration fundamentally untouched . in the example of the triangles",
    ", we could say that any rotation leaves the physical configuration untouched @xmath286 .",
    "or we could be more radical , arguing that since all we can ever really measure are ratios of distances , we should also include dilatations in this group , @xmath287 .",
    "remember this is a world in which _ only _ the 3 particles exist .",
    "the abstract group that one chooses to characterize this  no real change \" of configurations of a given system has been recently termed the _",
    "geometrical group _",
    "let us call it @xmath288 for now .",
    "having chosen the geometrical group @xmath288 , we have to define an _",
    " infinitesimal distance functional \" between configurations _ , @xmath289 .",
    "this  distance \" does not , a priori , have to be invariant under the action of the geometric group , suppose we have two descriptions , or configurations , of triangles @xmath290 and @xmath291 , lying in @xmath292 but over different shapes in the quotient space ( see figure [ fig : triangle_shape_space ] ) .",
    "we know that @xmath291 is in fact equivalent to all other descriptions related to it by the geometrical group . what best matching does is to select the description of that final state that is closest to @xmath290 .",
    "formally , @xmath293 let us give now the pedestrian approach to the above description : we have two triangles , @xmath290 and @xmath291 , and we move the second one however we like without breaking it ( i.e. obeying the geometric group ) until it is  most similar \" ( i.e. until it minimizes the distance ) to the first one",
    ". that is , until it is best matched .",
    "see figure [ fig : bm_triangle ] for an illustration of best - matching in the way described here .",
    "as noticed by the author ( @xcite and later put into @xcite ) , if the whole construction can be put in configuration space , with the geometrical group giving an orbit foliation , the notion of shape space becomes analogous to that of a base space in a principal fiber bundle given by the whole of configuration space ( see section [ sec : riem ] ) .",
    "then it might be that the whole approach can be put into the same geometrical terms as usual gauge theory .",
    "thus the poincar principle would be equivalent to saying that one has to build a theory on the quotient space , i.e. the base space of the fiber bundle .",
    "and then , if this is attainable , best matching becomes very reminiscent of the description of the way a connection form works in gauge theory",
    ". it will give a notion of  parallel transport \" of coordinates . both the poincar principle and best - matching",
    "can thus be geometrically incorporated in a principal fiber bundle setting , as we shall explain in the second part of this thesis .    as mentioned in the caption to figure [ fig : bm_triangle ]",
    ", one can prove that the best - matched velocity , when induced by a metric in configuration space , always implies that the corrected velocity of the triangle be orthogonal to the orbits , with respect to said metric .",
    "this will be explored more thoroughly in part ii .",

    "the connecting velocity is orthogonal with respect to the supermetric on @xmath294 .",

    ", we first transform all the dynamical variables @xmath298 , where @xmath299 , and the @xmath300 represents a given action of the diffeomorphisms ( which we explain in part ii ) .",

    ", barbour argues that subsequent instants in time should have points in their copies of @xmath28 identified such that the metrics are  as close as possible \" .",
    "as it happens , for any action taken to be the integral of a density , the diffeomorphism parameter @xmath6 does not appear .",
    "we can thus restrict to the case where the dependence of @xmath88 is given solely by @xmath308 $ ] . looking for a geodesic principle in configuration space that incorporated the arguments above ,",
    "barbour argued initially for an action of the type : [ jacobi]i[g , g , x]=_m fg_(g - l_x g , g - l_x g)d_gwhere @xmath309 is the generalized dewitt supermetric , and @xmath310 is a positive functional of @xmath2 . as argued in @xcite , for a truly geodesic , timeless picture , where the only notion of time is that given by change , one should also demand that this  distance \" functional be reparametrization invariant .",
    "for the usual geodesic principle , one usually looks towards minimizing some function of the type [ equ : geod_princ]_dt for curves @xmath311 , and some inner product @xmath300 .",
    "this suggests taking a global square root : [ jacobi_global]i[g , g , x]= ( for @xmath310 an undetermined conformal factor to the supermetric ) which should be taken to be extremal with respect to @xmath77 .",
    "this would at least heuristically define a geodesic principle in superspace ( see chapter [ sec : riem ] for the definition of superspace , and chapter [ chapter : connection_forms ] for the mathematical difficulties inherent in trying to define an induced metric in superspace ) . in the relationalist approach of barbour",
    "this is seen as highly desirable @xcite .",

    "square root : [ jacobi_local]i[g , g , x]=_md_g this however forfeits the geodesic picture , as we no longer have a variational principle for a functional of the form .",
    "let us say a few words about the above action , called the bsw action .",
    "it is obtained from the adm action by regarding the metric and metric velocities as fundamental variables , i.e. by regarding @xmath316 , where @xmath204 is given in as one of the fundamental variables .",
    "then instead of the primary scalar constraint , one gets that the terms involving the lapse @xmath102 appear as : @xmath317 upon varying and solving the action with respect to the lapse , one obtains @xmath318 , where @xmath319 .",
    "see section [ sec : prop_const_lagrange ] for more on the propagation of constraints in the bsw action .",
    "as it should , this lagrangian point of view transforms the scalar constraint into an identity .    in other words",

    "the local square root is the source of many ( so far ) insurmountable mathematical difficulties @xcite in trying to formulate the theory as either a geodesic theory in superspace or a gauge theory with a metric - induced connection , as in part ii of this thesis ( the two problems are interconnected ) .",
    "however , as we will not need it in the following sections , and in the interest of brevity we limit its discussion to what has been just said . in the author",
    "s opinion , there is still no first  principles justification for the local square - root , or at least not as convincingly as there exists for the other structures present in barbour s relational construction .",
    "let us go back to the case of the triangle ( see figure [ fig : bm_triangle ] ) .",
    "irrespectively of the form of the distance functional we assume , we can always use the best - matching algorithm .",
    "in fact , if one defines the distance functional simply as any given action @xmath320 $ ] in configuration space , one has an interesting consequence . to see this , suppose the group @xmath288 acts on congiguration space , @xmath321 where @xmath13 designates a general element of @xmath288 .",
    "then after making the substitutions in the action , both @xmath13 and @xmath322 appear in the action .",
    "as we show below , the statement then that the action will be extremized for infinitesimal variations along the orbit translates to : [ equ : bm_cond ] @xmath323=_=0 when one does this for the diffeomorphism group in geometrodynamics , either for the adm or the bsw action , one automatically recovers the momentum constraint , whereas for the full conformal group one recovers the _ maximal slicing _ constraint @xmath264 .",
    "albeit straightforward , we will not show this now , as it is contained in its general form in chapter [ chapter : linking_theory ] , and in its particulars , in chapters [ chapter : sd_cmc ] , [ chapter : sd_af ] and [ chapter : connection_forms ] .",
    "let us quickly present an alternate view however , which is not presented in the main text and which can be shown to be equivalent to by an application of the chain rule . recall first of all equation .",
    "given @xmath324 , the legendre map will give us momenta defined by : [ equ : momentum_map_geom]_q(v ) , w= l(q , v+tw ) thus , in accordance with the best - matching ansatz , we would like the action to be an extremal with respect to all possible infinitesimal velocity displacements along the orbit of the group : [ equ : bm_cond_geom]_q(v ) , w = l(q , v+tw)=0   w = t(u)where @xmath325 , the lie - algebra of @xmath288 .",
    "this means that we require all the conjugate momenta to annihilate the tangent space to the orbits ( represented here by @xmath326 ) .",
    "the rhs of implies @xmath327 which implies .    as a more concrete example , in the case of configuration space given by riem , and thus the configurations @xmath58 being given by three - metrics @xmath2 and @xmath288 being the group of 3-diffemorphisms , we get , upon contraction of the metric conjugate momenta with a tangent vector to the diffeomorphims orbits , assumed for now given by @xmath328 , the equation . or for that matter , upon contraction . ] with an element of tangent space to the conformal orbit , of the form @xmath329",

    "the central concept in this mechanism is that of a _ linking gauge theory_. roughly speaking , a linking gauge theory between two gauge theories @xmath341 with first class constraints @xmath342 and @xmath343 , respectively , both existing on the phase space parametrized by @xmath86 , is a gauge theory possessing additional fields and corresponding additional first class constraints .",
    "such a gauge theory qualifies as a linking gauge theory if it yields theories @xmath344 and @xmath345 under two distinct gauge fixings of the additional fields .",
    "we show that whenever there is a linking gauge theory that links two gauge theories then these two gauge theories are equivalent .",
    "the method by which we proceed can be said to be closely analogous to the stuckelberg mechanism @xcite , whereby one adds a fictitious field to a given system in order to reveal some hidden properties it might possess .",
    "this is the main aim of our actual usage of the linking theory in gr , through a fictitious addition of a `` conformal '' field , we reveal a hidden conformal invariance present in adm .",

    "we shall from the start restrict the study to a class of theories with no explicit hamiltonian ( it can be included in the set of first class constraints as the constraint @xmath350 that enforces energy conservation ) and no second class constraints .",

    "so we can write the constraints ( [ equ : transformedconstraints ] ) equivalently as @xmath437 which is of the form needed for a special linking theory .",

    "the block containing @xmath342 is invertible by assumption and hence the determinant of the entire matrix vanishes , since the conjugate block vanishes identically .",
    "this lies in contradiction with the assumption , which stated that the matrix was invertible .",
    "this was to be expected , because we can write one of the constraints as @xmath452 , it makes its poisson bracket with the gauge fixing automatically invertible and thus completely exhausts the gauge fixing .",
    "it follows that @xmath446 can just gauge fix the @xmath447 .",
    "thus , to perform the phase space reduction we trivialize the constraints @xmath447 and set @xmath453 . on the reduced phase space",
    "this then gives the first class constraints @xmath454 and thus we have effectively traded the constraints @xmath455 for @xmath456 .    in summary we have shown the following proposition    [ prop : constructionprinciple ] given a dynamical system with first class constraints @xmath457 and a point transformation @xmath458 parametrized by auxiliary degrees of freedom @xmath418 such that a subset @xmath447 of the constraints can be solved for @xmath418 as a function of @xmath86 after applying the canonical transformation that implements the point transformation , then the above construction provides a linking theory that provides equivalence with a theory in which the @xmath447 are replaced by the constraints @xmath456 as defined in equation ( [ equ : tradedconstraints ] ) .",
    "conversely , the phase space reduction of a linking theory can be viewed as an embedding of the equivalent gauge theories in the linking theory . in this picture",

    "dual gauge theory in the linking theory by @xmath461 where we wrote @xmath462 to bring out the similarity between the two embedding .",
    "it should be noted however that in spite of the apparent similarity , there is an important formal asymmetry .",
    "namely , whereas setting @xmath463 will influence the reduced dual system , as @xmath464 does not figure anywhere in the original system , setting its value to some given function @xmath456 does not influence the reduced system ( see paragraph following the paragraph of equation ) .",
    "we started by showing how an equivalence of gauge theories follows from the existence of a linking gauge theory on an extended phase space @xmath465 .",
    "one can sketch the construction of a pair of equivalent gauge theories a and b on a reduced phase space @xmath26 as follows @xmath466 where @xmath467 and @xmath468 is a canonical pair coordinatizing @xmath383 and the dictionaryis a further gauge fixing of the two equivalent theories such that the two theories coincide .",
    "the dictionary can be used to easily identify trajectories of the equivalent theories with one another .    to summarize the procedure in plain words and notation : we start with a theory @xmath342 which possesses some explicit symmetry @xmath469 , but which we suspect might possess some hidden symmetry @xmath470 .",

    "we stress that in most cases , the procedure outlined above is not applicable , i.e. one obviously can not trade any two given symmetries . if for example the theory already possesses the symmetry we are trying to trade the two gauge fixings coincide and there is no gain in the procedure . in the majority of cases",
    "though , what will happen is that the system produced through the gauge fixing will entail a tower of constraints , rendering it inconsistent .",

    "we will abuse notation and extend the use of the _ mean _ @xmath484 to densities by dividing out by the appropriate power of @xmath253 .",

    "first of all , it should be noted that imposing the gauge fixing @xmath623 in the shape dynamics side will only fix a volume - preserving conformal transformation .",
    "the argument is the following : for it to be a gauge fixing , we should be able to take any initial data @xmath333 to one that satisfies the gauge - fixing condition .",
    "we know that there exists a vpct such that we can bring any @xmath333 to one that satisfies @xmath624 , i.e. that brings the scalar constraint to a constant value .",
    "but the global constraint @xmath625 demands that this constant be zero .",
    "so the gauge fixing @xmath623 is ( in shape dynamics ) weakly equal to the constraint @xmath626 .",
    "what we mean by this is that gauge fixing the sd constraint does not solve the entire ly equation , but the ly equation with an inhomogeneous term .",
    "this permits the rest of the scalar constraint to be accounted for by our global hamiltonian , whose action indeed can and does change the volume .    in sd ,",
    "the actual gauge fixing is , analogously to @xmath627 , @xmath628 .",
    "the gauge fixing @xmath626 completely gauge fixes the vpct constraint , because the dirac bracket is invertible between these two conditions .",
    "so we can always find a unique vpct factor so that @xmath628 , and this is of course also @xmath629 .",
    "but in the gauge fixation of sd , we get the complete fixation of the lagrange multiplier ( or the velocity of the vpct facto ) @xmath630 , due to the invertibility of the bracket .",
    "we now show that indeed we have the invertibility properties that we need from the operator @xmath527 and that @xmath511 is unique and such that @xmath534 .",
    "first of all , @xmath527 is an _",
    "elliptic , linear , self - adjoint second order differential operator on a compact manifold_. the setting for the analysis of its properties could not be more convenient .",
    "ellipticity and linearity already guarantee a fundamental solution ( or green s function ) @xcite , in the sense that there exists a distribution @xmath529 such that @xmath530 however for our purposes it is not sufficient that the fundamental solution exist ; it also needs to be unique , which we required to solve for @xmath510 using the implicit function theorem .",
    "thus we need to show that for our purposes no non - zero homogeneous solution exists , i.e. , @xmath631 .",
    "first , one should note that we require solvability of only on the surface @xmath494 , which reduces @xmath632 to @xmath633 .",
    "now , let us rewrite the operator @xmath634 in the form of already using @xmath635 : [ equ : positive_linearity ] = ^2-^2-+@xmath501 ^ 2= ^2+^2- now we further split @xmath636 using its traceless part @xmath637 .",
    "then @xmath638 substituting this back in gives [ equ : new_delta]=^2-^2-|^ab|_ab . thus our operator @xmath527 can be written as @xmath639 where @xmath640 .",
    "this already implies that the only homogeneous solution @xmath531 is @xmath641 @xcite . to see this in a simple way ,",
    "suppose that there exists an @xmath36 such that @xmath642 .",
    "then since @xmath150 is compact , it follows that @xmath102 attains a minimum , let us say at @xmath175 . then @xmath643 a contradiction .",
    "the same reasoning applies for @xmath644 .",
    "thus we are guaranteed not only existence but uniqueness of green s functions for this case . for a complete proof taking into account",
    "the appropriate domains as square integrable functions , etc , see theorem 2.8 in @xcite .",
    "we thus have proven    [ prop : meann_0 ] if @xmath541 , in vacuum , then by the scalar constraint the scalar curvature also vanishes , which all but trivializes the range of such static solutions . ] the operator @xmath527 appearing in has a unique green s function associated with it .",
    "using the fact that @xmath507 is a canonical transformation , this also means that we can find a unique solution away from @xmath645 whenever @xmath646 . in its turn",
    ", this would require that @xmath647 which upon contraction with @xmath3 and integrating yields @xmath648 , which means again @xmath649 .    as stated in section",

    "furthermore , for our usage of the implicit function theorem and overall workings of the theory , we utilized many times and in diverse situations the fact that the gauge fixing @xmath464 is conjugate to a simple lie transformation .",
    "these threefold requirements ; @xmath663 that it be a partial gauge fixing of @xmath0 ( owing to the good properties of the operator ) , @xmath664 that it still allows for time - evolution ( owing to its leftover global constraint ) , and @xmath665 that it generates a symmetry ( owing to the fact that indeed @xmath635 generates a first class constraint and true lie group , see [ sec : group_structure ] ) are each extremely non - trivial demands .",
    "for example , a given gauge - fixing might leave an infinite amount of scalar constraints unfixed , which would be an unlikely advantage in the description of gravity . or it might leave none , which would not leave room in the theory for time evolution . alternatively , it might have led to an infinite chain of constraints , leading to an inconsistent system . moreover",
    ", it might have been impossible to eliminate the extra variables simultaneously with solving the second class constraints .",
    "moreover , we might have been able to exchange all but one of the scalar constraint with some other constraint , but this constraint could have been such that no real gain in simplicity would have been gained , as for instance if it was not linear in the momenta .",
    "these are the main factors that obstruct the construction of such symmetry trading in general .",
    "in section [ sec : const.surf.sd ] we focused our attention on the operator @xmath667 .",

    "step 3 : then we would have to find variables that poisson commuted with both @xmath699 and its canonical conjugate , @xmath700 .",

    "step 4 : find the purely second class combination of the constraints with respect to @xmath621 .",

    "step 5 : finally , show that indeed we could solve all but one of the original scalar constraints @xmath0 for @xmath700 as a function of the remaining variables ( this is our @xmath702 , given in proposition [ prop ] ) .",
    "as all the quantities would be expressed in terms of variables that poisson commuted with @xmath699 we would automatically have a vpct invariant theory without going into extended phase space . in the author s opinion , this is roughly what dirac had in mind in @xcite , albeit solely from a gauge fixing point of view , i.e. not involving a ",
    "conformal transformation \" conceptual background , and also limiting the analysis to asymptotically flat space .",
    "we will discuss this a bit further at the end of chapter [ chapter : sd_af ] .",
    "thus we come to the conclusion that without all the baggage presented in this chapter , in particular the use of the linking theory and extended phase space , the picture presented in figure [ fig : sd ] is of very limited value .",
    "it does not in itself present how the dynamics are made consistent .",
    "nonetheless it is a powerful pictorial representation of the end result .      now that we have explicitly constructed the theory of shape dynamics ( sd ) we will present it against the backdrop of two its three main sources , leaving the comparison with dirac to the next chapter .      in @xcite barbour et",
    "al implemented best matching with respect to volume - preserving - conformal transformations ( vpcts ) . by doing",
    "so they were able to derive the constraint @xmath703 and came indeed close to arriving at the same theory we present in this thesis ( sd ) .",
    "the main issue that blind - sighted them was that they used the lagragian bsw formalism .",
    "this means they never sought to distinguish between the first- and second - class sets of constraints , but were solely concerned with propagating @xmath635 .",
    "thus they indeed found the transformed version of equation [ lapse ] , but could not possibly have found our global scalar constraint .",
    "furthermore , the lagrangian bsw formalism gives the scalar constraint as an identity ( see section [ sec : barbour ] ) so that there is no place for the trading of constraints we have in shape dynamics .",
    "there is also some confusion over the fact that they attempt to interpret the transformed constraint @xmath704 as an equation for @xmath242 .",
    "even if we are willing to grant this , more importantly the extra variables @xmath474 are never seen as an extension of the phase space , so that the initial degrees of freedom are not extended and no extra constraint gained .",
    "the solvability of equation @xmath704 , which is the ly equation , is then interpreted as _ defining a physical scale for each metric_. of course if this is the case there is no room for admitting scale - invariance , as in sd .",
    "in summary , @xcite constituted a very important initial step towards sd , but fell short of finding a theory that contained vpct - invariance and a global scalar constraint .",
    "we have already stressed in section [ sec : ly ] the fact that , although it did not arise from canonical analysis of any sort , the york conformal method must be physically conceived as just that : a method for solving the initial value problem of general relativity . from the purely mathematical point of view , the form of the defining equation for shape dynamics is not too far removed from the lichnerowicz - york equation .",
    "the main difference in the form of the equations is that our principal result , contained in theorem [ prop ] , requires the solution of a non - homogeneous version of , i.e. containing a 0-th order term in @xmath242 .",
    "it is not yet clear whether we can apply the same arguments presented in @xcite to such an equation , which is why we resort to the implicit function theorem .",
    "we furthermore remark that it was not possible in the case of the paper @xcite to apply such methods to the solvability of for two main reasons .",
    "first , the ly equation in @xcite did not arise from a gauge - fixing .",
    "this gauge fixing has to satisfy the fundamental requirement of also being a symmetry generator for the implicit function theorem to aid us in solving for the second class constraint .",
    "secondly , even if one did try to use the generator of pure conformal transformations ( without the volume - preserving condition of shape dynamics ) , the corresponding version of the linear operator given in would not be invertible everywhere on phase space .",
    "let us now apply proposition [ prop : equivalence ] and the construction leading to proposition [ prop : constructionprinciple ] to general relativity to extend the results of section [ sec : sd_cmc ] to asymptotically flat cauchy surfaces .",
    "one of the leading differences is that it now makes no sense to talk about  volume - preserving \" as the volume is infinite . to recall , the volume - preserving condition is what allowed us to find the purely second class part of the scalar constraint and invert the poisson bracket formed between itself and the gauge fixing .",
    "a similar role will be played by an asymptotic fall - off condition on the conformal factor , as we will see .      to construct the linking gauge theory on a cauchy - surface @xmath705",
    ", we must first properly define the appropriate setting .",
    "we fix a euclidean global chart ( with radial coordinate @xmath706 ) and impose asymptotically flat boundary conditions .",
    "we implement this through the fall - off conditions of the 3-metric @xmath3 , its conjugate momentum density @xmath255 , the lapse @xmath102 and shift @xmath223 in the limit @xmath707 : @xmath708 we call @xmath476 the space of functions on @xmath150 with the fall - off rate ascribed to @xmath102 .",
    "we should note that these conditions are not of utmost importance in what follows , it is only the fall - off conditions on @xmath242 that we ascribe below that is of relevance .",
    "we start with the equivalent of and denote the usual adm constraints as @xmath709    as before , we now embed the original system in an extended phase space that includes the auxiliary variables @xmath474 . in accordance with the boundary conditions we assume",

    "the nontrivial canonical poisson brackets are still given by .",
    "again have an extended phase space with @xmath474 , with the additional constraint @xmath713 determined by our embedding .",
    "following , we construct the generating function @xmath714 where capitals denote the transformed variables . note the lack of hatted variables in this case .",
    "we find the canonical transformation analogous to : @xmath715 and again subsequently use these transformed variables to construct three sets of constraints : the transformed scalar and diffeomorphism constraint of gr as well as the transform of @xmath464 , @xmath716    using a scalar lagrange - multiplier @xmath619 , which is required to fall off as @xmath717 as @xmath711 , we define the total hamiltonian [ hamiltonian ] h_=d^3x [ n(x)t_s(x)+^a(x)t_h_a(x)+(x)(x ) ]    this completely defines the linking @xmath37 as contained in section [ sec : constructionprinciple ] in an analogous fashion to the compact closed case treated in the previous section ( see ) .",

    "the only weakly non - vanishing poisson - bracket of the gauge - fixing condition @xmath273 with the constraints of the linking theory is @xmath722 , which leads to @xmath723 the differential operator @xmath724 is an elliptic , second order , self - adjoint operator , invertible _ for the given boundary conditions_. so for the boundary conditions given in , we have the unique kernel [ n_0]n_0[g,]0thus , by the canonical transformation properties , we have a unique solution for @xmath725,\\pi_\\phi(x)\\}=0 $ ] , @xmath726 .    again , as in , we denote the one linear combination , among the infinitely many @xmath727 constraints , that remains first class with respect to all the other constraints by h_:=_s(n_0 ) .",
    "again , we separate the constraints into a first class part , given by @xmath728 and a purely second class part , given by @xmath729      now we again show that , even for the asymptotically flat case , the constraint @xmath730 is equivalent to a constraint of the form @xmath545 .",
    "we have that @xmath731 since these equations do not depend on @xmath464 , we can fix @xmath547 .",
    "then @xmath732 thus @xmath733 we thus take the set of constraints that is linearly independent of , which is given by @xmath734 .",
    "clearly @xmath735 , which means indeed it lives in the dual space of the quotient of @xmath476 by @xmath511 .",
    "effectively , we must subtract from any @xmath736 the function @xmath737 given by .",
    "consider the linear self adjoint elliptic operator we presently have : @xmath738 if we then use , we again have @xmath739 then from the fredholm alternative ( theorem [ theo : fredholm ] ) and self - adjointness [ equ : splitting2]c^(m ) ( _ _ s ) ( _ _ s)^*= ( _ _ s ) ( _ _ s ) the splitting is then given by ( _ _",
    "s ) ( _ _ s)= ( _ _ s ) n_0    thus the appropriate versions of both proposition [ prop2 ] and theorem [ prop ] work in the asymptotically flat case .",
    "it is important that there is a non - zero homogeneous solution to the @xmath527 operator , so we are left with a first class component of @xmath740 .",
    "this is the reason for using not full conformal transformations in the compact case , but only those that preserve the total spatial volume .",
    "the analogous restriction arises from the fall - off conditions in the present case .",
    "the construction of the theory on the constraint surface and the further fixing of the gauge therefore proceeds in the same manner as was shown in the constant mean curvature case .",
    "of course instead of having constant mean curvature slicing , we now have the maximal slicing @xmath264 .",
    "as mentioned already in section [ sec : dirac ] , and followed up in section [ sec : constructiontm ] , in 1958 dirac already anticipated much of the constructions present in shape dynamics in the asymptotically flat case .",
    "we pick up from the end of section [ sec : dirac ] . after setting @xmath741 as a gauge - fixing condition",
    ", he noticed that it will be second class only with respect to the scalar constraint @xmath0 .",
    "then he finds that there exists _ a _ variable canonically conjugate to @xmath340 , namely @xmath742 , where @xmath743 is a tensor density of weight @xmath744 ( his equation 28 ) .",
    "he then changed variables to consider the metrics with unit determinant @xmath745 ( a coordinate - dependent statement ) , and the tensor density of weight @xmath744 : @xmath746 , both of which have zero poisson bracket with @xmath340 and its conjugate variable .",
    "then he assumed that one can solve the scalar constraint by fixing the value of the variable @xmath742 as a function of the tilded variables .",
    "after one does this , one has completely eliminated @xmath340 , its conjugate and the scalar constraint .",
    "although dirac never mentions it , since the remaining variables all commute with @xmath340 we have a conformally invariant theory .",
    "of course , as we are taking poisson brackets between tensor densities whose density does not add up to 1 , these statements are all coordinate - dependent , which is why he later mentions that one would have to also fix the spatial coordinates .",
    "this indeed bears a strong resemblance to the work presented in this section , and indeed with the method we use for the hamilton ",
    "jacobi equation ( section [ sec : hj ] ) . even if we disregard the spatial coordinate - dependence of the procedure dirac outlined , there are still several disparities with what we did .",
    "one , as we mentioned at the end of section [ sec : constructiontm ] , is that dirac heuristically went through the entire procedure from a gauge fixing point of view , and not as a symmetry trading , one of the main selling points of sd which he never considered or mentioned .",
    "furthermore , dirac falls into a bit of contradiction , as he retains a non - zero global ( which he calls  main \" ) hamiltonian ( his equation 32 ) . but without boundary considerations ( which he did not seem to have for these particular equations ) , solving the scalar constraint ( his equation 30 ) would set the  main \" hamiltonian ( his equation 17 ) also to zero .",
    "lastly , of course , he never showed whether one can indeed solve the scalar constraint in terms of the variable canonically conjugate to @xmath340 ( the specific case of ) .",
    "had he done so , we would have also anticipated the work of york et al @xcite ( see section [ sec : ly ] ) .",
    "concluding , although there are several enticing hints and interesting directions , that original paper falls reasonably short of actually defining shape dynamics in the asymptotically flat case .",
    "let us consider the lagrangian of the linking gauge theory in an attempt to relate the local degrees of shape dynamics with those of general relativity .",
    "the local degrees of freedom of standard general relativity are given by the adm - decomposition of a 4-metric , i.e. a 3-metric , shift vector field and lapse field , while shape dynamics is a local theory of a 3-metric , a shift vector field , the conformal field @xmath242 and the conformal lagrange - multiplier @xmath619 .",
    "while the 3-metric and shift vector field are naturally identified , one needs the euler ",
    "lagrange equations to investigate further .    using @xmath747 , @xmath748 and the supermetric @xmath749 we can write the action for the linking theory in canonical form as @xmath750+d[\\xi]+c[\\rho]\\right)\\right)\\\\     & = & \\int dtd^3 x\\left ( \\frac{1}{4n}g^{abcd}(\\dot g_{ab}-\\mathcal{l}_\\xi g_{ab}-\\rho g_{ab})(\\dot g_{cd}-\\mathcal{l}_\\xi g_{cd}-\\rho g_{cd})+n { \\mathcal { t}}_\\phi r\\right ) ,   \\end{array}\\ ] ] where we used the equations of motion @xmath751 to eliminate the momenta .",
    "coming purely from the lagrangian one could now think that it would be possible to find an equation that relates the lapse and the conformal lagrange multiplier .",
    "this basically would mean we could relate the local speed of time to local speed of scale . to see that this is not possible , we consider the general construction principle for linking theories as explained in section [ sec : constructionprinciple ] . we start with the gauss - codazzi split of the einstein - hilbert action @xmath752\\right)\\ ] ] and use the transfromation @xmath753 , which again yields the action for the linking theory , i.e. the second line of ( [ equ : linking - action ] ) , with @xmath754 replaced by @xmath755 as it should be @xmath756 it is quite easy to show that the constraint @xmath44 comes out as a primary constraint from the legendre transform of this lagrangian , as it was to be expected from section [ sec : constructionprinciple ] .",
    "however , there is no relationship possible between the lagrange multiplier @xmath619 of the conformal constraint and the lapse @xmath102 , neither in the linking theory ( where both lagrange multipliers are free ) , nor in shape dynamics ( where the lapse is fixed but @xmath619 is free ) .",
    "one could now argue that one can write a relationship between @xmath102 and @xmath757 by imposing the constraint @xmath494 .",
    "but this choice , as we showed in the previous section , fixes @xmath758 .",
    "we thus find for this case that the lagrangian for shape dynamics is written as the second line of equation ( [ equ : linking - action ] ) with @xmath463 and @xmath759 , which admits no dynamical relation anymore .",
    "one of the outstanding features of shape dynamics ( sd ) , is that it contain one single global hamiltonian constraint which generates evolution .",
    "as this theory no longer possesses many fingered time , or lorentz invariance for that matter , it becomes a crucial concern of the program to establish its causal structure .",
    "the natural way to do this , which is what we pursue in this section , is to study propagation of a scalar field .",
    "when we try to couple different fields to gravity , we will have to face basically one question : how does one scale fields ?",
    "what exponent shall we choose in @xmath760 ?",
    "this is an important issue because if the scaling is not correct we could encounter two difficult obstructions .",
    "the first obstruction is that if we are dealing with a field that possesses some kind of gauge symmetry it might not be possible to find a constraint @xmath499 , as in , that is first class with respect to the gauge constraint .",
    "the second is that the conserved charge ( which we call @xmath635 ) implicit inside @xmath499 that defines the foliation might depend on the field . in this case , there might be an even worse consequence if the field possesses some sort of gauge symmetry ( like electromagnetism ) . for",
    "then the charge could turn out to depend on the gauge potential .",
    "this could be the case even if we can find a field - dependent @xmath635 that is first class with respect to the gauge generator of the field .",
    "indeed with any other choice of scaling than the one chosen in the text , this is what happens with the electromagnetic field , where the generator of the gauge symmetry is the gauss constraint .",
    "we will not show it , but it is possible to make a scaling choice different from the one we make in the following section , but still such that the gauss constraint is propagated . but",
    "what happens then is that the charge is @xmath238 gauge dependent .",
    "so any of the couplings that we choose should pass these two hurdles .",
    "as it turns out , the solution exists only when we require the fields to have trivial scaling with respect to the conformal factor , @xmath761 .",
    "the most natural way to approach the coupling of a scalar field is not to try to develop it directly in sd , but to make use of the linking theory to facilitate its introduction .",
    "we shall concentrate on the case of the closed spatial manifold without boundary .",
    "let us define the fields we shall be working with .",
    "the usual hamiltonian density for a scalar field @xmath762 is given by [ equ : hamiltonian_scalar ] h_=+g^ab_a_bg where @xmath763 is the momentum conjugate to the scalar field .",
    "the original gravitational constraints amended by the constraints arising from the coupling to the scalar field can be written as @xmath764 where for ease of manipulation we wrote the smeared version of the diffeomorphism constraint .",

    "x(g_ab_^ab+__+ _ _ ) can also be explicitly computed using @xmath499 .",
    "we will refrain from doing these calculations as they do not differ from the vacuum case .",

    "it can be shown that @xmath778 can be written as @xmath779 in the same way as was done in .",
    "this constraint exhausts the gauge fixing @xmath494 ( they have invertible poisson bracket ) , and as second class constraint can be set strongly to zero alongside @xmath464 to eliminate the extra variables and allow us to use the usual poisson bracket instead of the dirac ones .",

    "suppose however that we would like , from first principles , to come up with a hamiltonian that still obeys the symmetries of sd and that furthermore matches general relativity to some given approximation , what would be a reasonable form ?",
    "in answer to this question , let us once again consider the smeared form of the scalar constraint : d^3 xn(-g ( r-2 ) ) the most straightforward attempt to make something that is volume - preserving - conformally invariant out of this is to have a gauge fixing : @xmath810 where @xmath811 is a section of the fiber bundle @xmath812 with gauge group @xmath487 .",

    "this was our first attempt at an approximation scheme to the global hamiltonian of sd .",
    "more fruitful schemes are being carried out at present , but will not be contained in this thesis .",
    "the comparison with earlier work in the classical hj approach to gr @xcite brings to light at least one great practical advantage of sd over gr : the ability to implement _ all _ local constraints of sd , as in sd we are able to work out all _ local _ degrees of freedom due to the linearity in the momenta of the constraints .",
    "remarkably , this construction provides a rigorous classical correspondence between gravity at very large volumes and conformal field theory ( cft ) .",
    "the sd hamiltonian can be explicitly constructed by solving an elliptic differential equation whose coefficients are local phase space functions .",
    "the nonlocality of the solution of this differential equation introduces nonlocality into sd .",

    "as it stands however , the connection is not direct and we will refrain from drawing too many parallels .",
    "heuristically , by considering a cmc trajectory that approaches a homogeneous spacetime at large volume so that the spatial volume becomes an asymptotic clock , the correspondence would arise from interpreting `` volume time '' as the `` renormalization group ( rg ) time '' of an euclidean cft partition function .",

    "it means only that evolution becomes homogeneous , or that in a sense evolution  freezes out \" at asymptotically late times .      in the case of unconstrained systems , the hamilton - jacobi theory provides a bridge between classical and quantum mechanics . as we have all first class _ linear _ local constraints here , we also have a classical hamilton - jacobi formulation of the theory for our case . with non - linear first class constraints ,",
    "one is simply not able to implement the constraints at the level of hamilton s principal function ( see , section 5.4.4 ) .",
    "the principal function is of course very different from the large volume expansion studied in the previous section .",

    "we show that the canonical poisson brackets between the barred variables and @xmath836 and @xmath840 vanish in section [ sec : hj_app ] .",
    "hence we can obtain the hj equation from making the substitutions in our volume expanded hamiltonian : @xmath856 where @xmath857 is the hj functional that depends on the metric @xmath858 and parametrically on _ integration constants _ @xmath859 .",
    "these constants @xmath859 are symmetric tensor densities of weight 1 : they parametrize the non - gauge part of the initial conditions ( or the initial point in the constraint manifold ) in the hamilton - jacobi approach",

    "unlike the usual ( a)ds / cft correspondence , this is not the most general case that can be considered within our framework ( the generalization to the euclidean ads case is trivial , requiring the scalar constraint to be expressed as a radial , instead of a time , evolution operator )",
    ".    we can express @xmath844 in terms of @xmath860 and use the chain rule to write the result in terms of @xmath861 and @xmath862 .",
    "we prove that the @xmath836 derivatives drop out of the final expression in .",
    "the final expression for @xmath863 we use is @xmath864    let us note that in the gauge fixed version , the variations of @xmath830 can be found using the standard variations of @xmath214 .",

    "as mentioned , to obtain a complete integral of the hj equation , @xmath866 can be taken of the form @xmath870 .",
    "the linear constraints determine @xmath859 to be transverse and with covariantly constant trace .",
    "the leading order hj equation determines the value of the trace of @xmath859 , as we will see .",
    "this restricts the freely specifiable components of @xmath859 precisely to the freely specifiable momentum data in york s approach @xcite . to encode an initial point that is asymptotically desitter ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to separation constants with vanishing transverse traceless part .    to be explicit , the first terms ( reinstating @xmath871 from the calculations done in section [ sec : hj_s_n ] , are @xmath872 note that @xmath866 and @xmath873 are the only terms with positive dimension .",
    "gauge invariant solutions can be obtained by restoring the @xmath816 dependence of the tilded variables . to draw a contrast of this result with that of @xcite",
    ", we briefly note that these terms all solve the local hj constraints of sd in asymptotic ds space .",
    "in this chapter we will build the technical tools to be used in chapter [ chapter : connection_forms ] .",
    "most of the content of the present chapter can be found in @xcite and @xcite , albeit in slightly different language .",
    "gauge theory , needless to say , has a long and rich history , and it is probably not an exaggeration to state it has by now permeated all areas of theoretical physics as an essential tool for existing frameworks and guide for future developments .",
    "it describes systems which possess some inherent symmetry in their parametrizations , and for classical fields over spacetime it has a well - developed geometrical understanding through the use of principal fiber bundles .",
    "geometrodynamics , as championed by wheeler , is the study of gravitation through a primary focus on _ space and changes therein _ rather than on space - time itself .",
    "space - time is essentially ` sliced - up ' and described as an evolution of the geometry of these spatial slices through time .",
    "it is fundamentally a dynamical view of gr , technically taking form as its constrained canonical , or adm formulation @xcite .",
    "although widely regarded as a gauge theory ( since all of its constraints are first class and thus interpreted as symmetry generating ) , there is no specific description of adm as a gauge theory in the geometric , fiber bundle sense , making use of connection forms , sections and so forth .",
    "this is in part because a connection over configuration space seems to be far removed from reality .",
    "what would such a connection do ?",
    "this is one of the questions we aim to answer in this part .",
    "as is well known , the unconstrained configuration space for general relativity is defined as @xmath874 the hamiltonian dynamics thus takes place on ( a constraint submanifold of ) @xmath875 . by a geometrical setting of gauge theory , mathematically we mean the existence of a principal fiber bundle and , most importantly , a connection form on it .",
    "the first inkling of a connection form in @xmath876 arose in @xcite , where the mention of horizontal and vertical components of metric velocities first appears .",
    "it is however our understanding that the concept was not fully explored , and one of the purposes of the present work , at least from the mathematical standpoint , is to investigate exactly what constitutes a connection over configuration space .",
    "that is , what are the properties such a connection has to satisfy and how can we construct one both formally and explicitly . in doing",
    "so we would like to shed light on explicit infinite - dimensional geometrical gauge theories over configuration space , a point of view so far as we know original . from the physical point of view , this may be connected with a richer history of relational ideas ( see section [ sec : barbour ] ) .",
    "a second reason why this approach has not been attempted before is because of the difficulties in interpreting the action of the hamiltonian constraint as a group action , and other issues related to the infamous  problem of time \" @xcite . as in the first part of the thesis",
    "we have shown that it is possible to have a theory of gravity which no longer possesses the scalar ( or hamiltonian ) constraint , and thus no refoliation invariance .",
    "unlike what is the case in adm , the constraints of this dual theory then form subalgebras , reflecting the kind of group structure suitable for an exhaustive principal fiber bundle formulation .",
    "this points in a new direction for the development of gauge theoretic tools for gravity and sets the stage for applying more standard methods for the quantization of gravity as a gauge theory .    motivated by the possibility of now describing the symmetry groups of general relativity in a full geometrical gauge - theoretic setting , we will attempt to make explicit the gauge connections relating to the action of these two groups ; the group of three dimensional diffeomorphisms , which we denote by @xmath877 , and that of three - dimensional conformal transformations @xmath476 .",
    "both @xmath476 and @xmath877 groups have right actions on the natural configuration space @xmath878 .",
    "we will constrain our attention to the case of @xmath28 being compact and closed , which is of more interest to the relational approach for various reasons @xcite .      here",
    "we will briefly introduce the concept of a principal fiber - bundle , depicted in figure [ fig : pfb ] .",
    "we will first present the formal definitions and    [ fig : pfb ]        [ def : pfb ] a principal fiber bundle with smooth structural group @xmath288 is a smooth manifold @xmath840 on which @xmath288 acts @xmath879 and for which the action of @xmath288 is smooth and free . by a free action we mean that @xmath880 that is , the isotropy group of every point is the identity .",

    "we call an orbit of @xmath883 ( or of @xmath884 ) a _ fiber _ , and also denote it by @xmath885 .    for finite - dimensional manifolds , by the freedom of the group action",
    ", we can see that the orbits are isomorphic to the group @xmath288 , but have no preferred identity element .- torsors.][footn3 ] a smooth choice of identity element in each fiber coincides with the definition of a local section :    let @xmath157 be an open set in @xmath343 .",

    "these facts are enough to show that we can completely characterize an element of @xmath840 over @xmath157 by its location on the base and an element of the group which says where it is wrt the section .",
    "a choice of section is also called a _ choice of local gauge_. one can prove from this definition that in finite dimensions there always exists a _",
    "slice _ for our definition of a principal fiber bundle ( definition [ def : pfb ] ) ( see @xcite . ] ) .",
    "indeed , it is using the same outlines of that proof that we are able to show that a section for the action of different groups on riem exists ( see section [ sec : slice ] ) .",
    "a slice implies that @xmath840 has a _ local product structure _ that we can patch together to form an atlas of the manifold , and that all slices over the same open set are diffeomorphic .",

    "finding an appropriate section @xmath1101 of the isotropy group such that the last property is satisfied requires only a small amount of extra work , but it is enough to make it too much of a detour on the purpose of this section .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for the remaining details .",
    "it is important to notice that by exponentiating the horizontal subspace at @xmath1120 one does not necessarily obtain a horizontal submanifold even for the simple positive definite @xmath902-invariant metric we have used here .",

    "one can see this since @xmath1152 where @xmath1153 is just the operator that assigns volume forms to metrics ( and @xmath669 is the space of volume forms ) .",

    "that next step is of course , the construction and interpretation of connections for infinite - dimensional groups acting on riem , and that is the topic of this chapter .",
    "it is a much repeated story that in a diffeomorphism invariant theory points lose their meaning , their individuality becoming dissolved by the active interpretation of these global `` coordinate changes '' @xcite .- torsor ( see footnote [ footn3 ] ) .",
    "] in fact , since we will be dealing exclusively with global , and thus active , diffeomorphisms , we will use the expression `` _ _ change of labeling _ _ '' to distinguish the nomenclature from that of the passive , local  coordinate changes \" .",
    "it is the case that in pure gravity only the metrics over the manifolds attribute any real significance to the spatial points of @xmath28 .",
    "we indicate this dependence by @xmath1159 , a family of diffeomorphic manifolds parametrized by @xmath2 .",
    "in the canonical analysis , the 3 + 1 decomposition of the four dimensional metric involves a ` shift ' vector field and a lapse scalar , which parametrize the diffeomorphism from a globally hyperbolic space - time to @xmath1160 .",
    "this entails in our notation a one - parameter family of diffeomorphic manifolds @xmath1161 .",
    "the lapse encodes the temporal distance element in the embedding of the one parameter family of hypersurfaces .",
    "the shift vector field effectively already requires some identification between the points of  neighboring \" @xmath1161 s .",
    "the shift itself is an infinitesimal deviation from the background identification of @xmath1161 and @xmath1162 by vectors orthogonal to @xmath1161 with respect to the ambient lorentzian metric .",
    "if we propose here to at least momentarily disregard four dimensional embedding , specially in view of the first part of this thesis , then the shift vector field loses its meaning , and we must find a new way to string together the @xmath1161 s along time .",
    "the need to somehow identify points of our manifolds along time , naturally brings us to the concept of best - matching @xcite , and forces us to introduce a form of  parallel transport \" of point labels . from this concept",
    "it is a small step to see this parallel transport as taking place in the gauge setting , where the structural group should be @xmath902 , since it is this group that parametrizes the ways with which we can connect @xmath1163 and @xmath1164 .",
    "it is this concept and its generalization that we will study in this chapter .",
    "we regard this construction as an elaboration of the concept of best - matching , as spelled out in section [ sec : barbour ] .",
    "our aim is not just to construct the decomposition @xmath1165 of the principal fiber bundle , but to explicitly construct the lie algebra valued one form @xmath122 .",
    "this does not in fact require the introduction of new mathematical apparatus , but it certainly implies a shift in the way one views gauge theory over these configuration spaces towards indeed an original perspective .",
    "the connection form then has a very physical interpretation , as something that acts on metric velocities and yields vector fields .",
    "its interpretation is that it yields a preferred infinitesimal  label change \" from each infinitesimal metric change .",
    "it is the general study of such connections and what they imply ( as for example wrt locality ) that this chapter is devoted . in principle , a connection could be derived from a more general action over the whole of riem(m ) , including curvature forms .",
    "as this requires more work to be made sense of , we start with a certain type of metric induced connections , yielding equation as our main result .",
    "let us first of all define a connection form for a finite - dimensional principal fiber bundle @xmath840 :    in finite - dimensions a connection form is defined as a lie - algebra - valued one form @xmath1166 which acts on vertical vectors as : @xmath1167 , where @xmath1168 and @xmath1169 is the group action .",

    "for instance the usual yang - mills curvature form transforms equivariantly in the adjoint representation , but the local expression for the connection does not , as it does not transform homogeneously .    the connection form in our present infinite - dimensional setting will then be a lie - algebra valued linear functional on @xmath988 ( metric velocities ) .",
    "since technically the lie algebra here is just the space of infinitesimal diffeomorphisms of @xmath28 , the connection form turns out to be a vector - field - valued distribution , taking metric velocities as test functions .",
    "we are thus led to the meaning of a gauge connection over @xmath915 as representing a machian notion of relational space , since it relates spatial points along time in a manner depending on the dynamics of the entire universe ( depending strictly and globally on the metric velocities ) .",
    "the connection form is not an empty mathematical construct .",
    "its interpretation as yielding parallel transportation of spatial points is suggestive and interesting ( especially from a relational point of view ) .      a choice of connection form in @xmath840 amounts as usual to choosing an equivariant decomposition [ equivariant decomposition]t_g=h_gv_g .",
    "where by equivariant we mean that the decomposition is maintained by the group action .    in the infinite - dimensional case",

    "the physical purpose of the decomposition is so that we can distinguish what is a label change , which would be given by projection of metric change along the orbits , and the remnant of the metric change , which could be identified with pure geometrical change .",
    "this amounts to defining an equivariant projection on the vertical space , which we call @xmath1177 , having the properties @xmath1178 and equivariance : @xmath1179 . but to be able to construct the actual connection form we need more than just the equivariant direct sum decomposition , but also conditions on the representation of the algebra ( that it forms a fundamental vector field with the correct equivariance properties ) .",

    "the technical crux of the matter is that the gauge fixing leading to sd leaves a single scalar constraint unfixed , and that the resulting second class constraints can be fully solved in terms of the formerly introduced extra fields .",
    "we have furthermore found how we can extend the treatment that leads to to the electromagnetic , massive and massless scalar fields ( see chapter [ chapter : coupling ] ) , with their usual hamiltonians .",
    "the only thing that changes above is that one has a different @xmath1333 ( which nonetheless still generates diffeomorphisms ) , a different global hamiltonian @xmath1334 , which is now also a functional of the added field variables , and , in the case of electromagnetism , the gauss constraint is also added to the mix .",
    "it should also be said that for the massive scalar field the algorithm works only up to a certain field density .",
    "here , the only necessary requirement was that the fields only scale through their coupling to the metric , i.e. the fields themselves do not scale , only the metric does . once matter couplings are achieved , it becomes very simple to regain a causal ( and indeed metric ) structure of a space and time .",
    "we also show here that different approximation schemes are available for the global hamiltonian , and in this thesis we perform a large volume expansion for it ( chapter [ sec : hj ] ) , obtaining the first three terms .",
    "we use this expansion to find the hamilton ",
    "jacobi version of the global hamiltonian , a first step towards quantization .",
    "we have found that this bears strong resemblance to certain holographic dualities between gravity and traditional conformal field theories @xcite .",
    "other interesting results that are not yet ready for print and will not be included in this thesis are : the 2 + 1 formulation and quantization of the shape dynamics hamiltonian , a second order expansion of the global hamiltonian around the de sitter vacuum , and the formulation of shape dynamics using ashtekar variables .",

    "shape dynamics provides the theory that fulfills the requirements of a complete theory of the gravitational field on conformal superspace .",
    "our results justify york s intuitive remarks regarding the configuration space of gravity : conformal superspace is not the reduced configuration space of general relativity but that of shape dynamics .",
    "shape dynamics also meets barbour s relational arguments for a truly relational theory of the universe , encapsulated by the aphorism :  size and motion are relative , and time is given by change \" .",
    "it is also true , although unseen by us at the time of its conception , that sd is the completion and formalization of dirac s 1958 paper @xcite .",
    "although his idea was put in a less developed form , was only valid for asymptotically flat spaces , did not perceive the role of conformal invariance or symmetry trading , and suffers from a few other drawbacks ( as made explicit in section [ sec : comparison : dirac ] ) , the idea behind the mathematical algorithm is basically the same . made explicit and put into context however , it gains significance way beyond that of a mere  fixation of the coordinates \" , providing truly an alternative description of gravity .",
    "the local constraints are all linear in momenta , being easily implementable in configuration space .",
    "the true gravitational degrees of freedom are easily found .",
    "the constraint algebra is incredibly simple , making it possible that the attempts at the quantization of gravity that encounter the obstacle posed by structure functions being present in the algebra of constraints ( as opposed to structure constants ) might be more successful in shape dynamics .",
    "as we can now couple matter and have a second order perturbation theory around desitter space , it also becomes possible to try our hand in perturbative cosmology through the prism of shape dynamics .",
    "the possibility of doing cosmology brings about another interesting possibility , this time concerning the uniqueness theorems of general relativity .    for 4-dimensionally covariant theories , there",
    "exist tight restrictions on the form of the action .",
    "in fact , for an action that is 4-dimensionally covariant , divergenceless , and only depends on the metric up to second derivatives , lovelock s theorem ( theorem [ theo : lovelock ] ) tells us that the only action available is indeed the einstein ",
    "hilbert one .",
    "but now we have a different set of symmetry principles with which to guide us , and thus a different theory space .",
    "we can construct other actions that only match sd ( hence adm in cmc ) in certain limits , whilst still respecting the same symmetry principles .",
    "we already have two natural candidates , one of which is just taking the first three terms in the volume expansion mentioned above .",
    "this has an explicit form , is completely tractable , matches adm in cmc for large volumes of the universe , and by our results in coupling with matter and regaining a metric structure , can be tested classically against adm in cmc ( and thus gr ) . in my personal opinion",
    "this is now the most promising new area of research opened up by shape dynamics .",
    "this brings us to another way to gain insight into gr through shape dynamics .",
    "suppose we do not impose the gauge fixing @xmath623 in shape dynamics , but find solutions to some other gauge fixing condition an epsilon away from @xmath623 .",
    "we would then have a modified gravity theory .",
    "but , any solution of such a modified theory must have a cousin which is a solution to gr , a dual .",
    "we can then identify what this solution represents by returning to the linking theory and performing the appropriate gauge transformations .",
    "summing up , shape dynamics definitely provides a completely different view on classical general relativity , and thus in prospects for its quantization .",
    "more than that , it provides interesting new ways to deform general relativity , breaking general covariance but not the 3-dimensional conformal covariance .",
    "first we establish some preliminary results , being as extensive as possible .",
    "we first note that : [ equ : inv_metric_var]g^cd =- g^icg^jdg_ij we need the variation of the christoffel symbols . these can be derived from functional differentiation of both the the no torsion law : @xmath1335 ( where @xmath6 is a smooth function ) and compatibility with the metric : @xmath1336 .",

    "i.e. , under which conditions the intersection ( s^-1(0):=\\{(g,)t^ *  |  s(g,)=0})(h_a^-1(0):=\\{(g,)t^ *  |  h^a(g,)=0 } ) forms a manifold . from the form of the constraint algebra for the constraints we already know that the constraint set is maintained by the evolution equations for all choices of lapse and shift .",
    "now suppose again that if @xmath1480 then @xmath3 is not flat .",
    "we prove the following proposition :    [ prop : regularvalue_s ] under the assumption that whenever @xmath1480 then @xmath3 is not flat , @xmath1481 forms a manifold .    to prove this we use the fredholm alternative for the differential operator s_(g,):t_gt^*_gc^(m ) where we remind the reader that @xmath1227 is not the actual space of linear functionals on @xmath1120 , but the space of sections of @xmath1482 the symmetric product of the tangent bundle .",
    "see section [ sec : riem ] for a more thorough explanation of these spaces . the reasoning is quite familiar from section [ sec : constructingv ] and again quite simple : if the operator is elliptic , we can use the fredholm splitting c^(m)=(s)^*s , where @xmath1483 is an @xmath1008 orthogonal splitting ( i.e. in the positive definite metric used in this section ) .",
    "then we must merely show that @xmath1484 is injective , which will imply that @xmath1485 is surjective . by the regular value theorem we then have that @xmath1481 is ( at least locally ) a submanifold , with tangent space @xmath1486 . for @xmath1017 denoting the principal symbol of the operator @xmath635",
    ", we have @xmath1016 .",
    "this means that if @xmath1017 is injective , for positive definite inner product , we automatically have @xmath1018 surjective and thus that the operator is elliptic ( see proposition [ propo ] ) .",
    "and thus we are left to prove that the operator is injective and has injective symbol .",
    "this calculation is typical of chapter [ chapter : connection_forms ] ( see , , , etc ) and by now we can skip the preliminaries and assert that the symbol of @xmath1484 , given in : _ ( ^*s)=(-_a_b+g_ab^c_c , 0 ) which by doing the usual trick of taking the trace , guarantees the operator is elliptic . now from , we have two equations that we must satisfy if @xmath1487 . taking the trace of the second one we get @xmath1488 , which when input back into the same equation yields @xmath1489",
    ". when input back into the first of these equations ( denoted by @xmath246 ) we get : -(g g^ef rn(y)+ g(y)(-r^ef(y)-g^ef(y)^2n(y)+ n^;ef(y ) ) ) = 0by taking the trace we arrive at : -2 ^ 2 n+rn=0 now if we substitute the scalar constraint for @xmath214 , and since @xmath1489 we get @xmath1490 which means @xmath102 is a constant .",
    "but we furthermore have that @xmath263 , which implies that @xmath1491 everywhere ( i.e @xmath532 ) , as it is a constant .",
    "thus @xmath1484 is injective . @xmath599",
    "we will not prove the same for the diffeomorphism group , which goes through quite simply .",
    "what changes when we try to prove that the intersection is a manifold ?",
    "now we have the mapping : ( s_(g,),h^a_(g,)):t_gt^*_gc^(m)c^(t^*m ) and the adjoint given in differs from that by the term @xmath1492 .",
    "we will not go through the calculations here ( since the tricks used are basically the same as before ) , but the only condition under which this is still injective is if @xmath1493 , a constant @xcite .",
    "this is further circumstantial evidence that the domain which has good theoretical properties is not the entire one of general relativity , but that of shape dynamics",
    ".      we now show how the poisson brackets of the adm constraints , propagate . as mentioned in section [ sec : geometric_pb ] , we will take this opportunity to illustrate how the lagrangian formalism , as opposed to the hamiltonian one , is cumbersome when dealing with canonical dynamical systems . in the hamiltonian formalism",
    "the only non - trivial bracket is the one given by @xmath1345 , which was easily calculated in .",
    "not so in the lagrangian formalism , where we will have to prove every propagation non - trivially .",
    "we will also take the opportunity to demonstrate two other points that arise in the text .",
    "first is the propagation of the constraints in bsw form ( section [ sec : barbour ] ) .",
    "second is the use of a more general supermetric in the propagation ( section [ sec : riem ] ) and the conditions it gives rise to . to emphasize then ,",
    "in this section we will compute propagation of the bsw constraints with a generalized supermetric .",
