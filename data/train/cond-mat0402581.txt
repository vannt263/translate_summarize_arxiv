    "strings or sequences of characters appear in almost all sciences .",
    "examples are written texts , dna sequences , bits for the storage and transmission of digital data etc . when analysing such sequences the main point is extracting the information they bring . for a dna sequence",
    "this could help in identifying regions involved in different functions ( e.g. coding dna , regulative regions , structurally important domains ) ( for a recent review of computational methods in this field see  @xcite ) . on the other hand for a written text one",
    "is interested in questions like recognizing the language in which the text is written , its author or the subject treated .",
    "+ when dealing with information related problems , the natural point of view is that offered by information theory  @xcite . in this context the word information acquires a precise meaning which can be quantified by using the concept of entropy . among several equivalent definitions of entropy the best one , for our purposes ,",
    "is that of algorithmic complexity proposed by chaitin , kolmogorov and solomonoff  @xcite : the algorithmic complexity of a string of characters is the length , in bits , of the smallest program which produces as output the string and stop afterward .",
    "+ though it is impossible , even in principle , to find such a program , there are algorithms explicitly conceived to approach such theoretical limit .",
    "these are the file compressors or zippers . in this paper",
    "we shall investigate some properties of a specific zipper , lz77  @xcite , used as a tool for information extraction .",
    "it is useful to recall how lz77 works .",
    "let @xmath0 be the sequence to be compressed , where @xmath1 represents a generic character of sequence s alphabet .",
    "the lz77 algorithm finds duplicated strings in the input data .",
    "the second occurrence of a string is replaced by a pointer to the previous string given by two numbers : a distance , representing how far back into the window the sequence starts , and a length , representing the number of characters for which the sequence is identical .",
    "more specifically the algorithm proceeds sequentially along the sequence .",
    "let us suppose that the first @xmath2 characters have been codified .",
    "then the zipper looks for the largest integer @xmath3 such that the string @xmath4 already appeared in @xmath5 .",
    "then it codifies the string found with a two - number code composed by : the distance between the two strings and the length @xmath3 of the string found .",
    "if the zipper does not find any match then it codifies the first character to be zipped , @xmath6 , with its name .",
    "this eventuality happens for instance when codifying the first characters of the sequence , but this event becomes very infrequent as the zipping procedure goes on .",
    "+ this zipper has the following remarkable property : if it encodes a text of length @xmath7 emitted by an ergodic source whose entropy per character is @xmath8 , then the length of the zipped file divided by the length of the original file tends to @xmath8 when the length of the text tends to infinity  @xcite . in other words",
    "lz77 does not encode the file in the best way but it does it better and better as the length of the file increases .",
    "usually , in commercial implementations of lz77 ( like for instance @xmath9 ) , substitutions are made only if the two identical sequences are not separated by more than a certain number @xmath2 of characters , and the zipper is said to have a @xmath2-long sliding window .",
    "the typical value of @xmath2 is 32768 .",
    "the main reason for this restriction is that the search in very large buffers could be not efficient from the computational time point of view .",
    "a restriction is often given on the length of a match , too , avoiding substitution of repeated subsequences shorter than 3 characters .",
    "our idea ( see also @xcite ) is that of creating _ artificial texts _ by appending words randomly extracted from a dictionary and to compare artificial texts instead of the original sequences .",
    "the comparison of artificial texts is made using the modified version of lz77 discussed above .",
    "one of the biggest advantages of our artificial text method is the possibility of creating an ensemble of artificial texts all representing the same original sequence , thus enlarging the original set of sequences . comparing artificial texts we performed the same experiments described in @xcite obtaining better results .    in figure 3",
    "we present a linguistic tree representing the self - classification of a corpus of 87 texts belonging to 11 italian authors @xcite .",
    "the texts belonging to the same author clusterize quite well , with the easily - explainable exception of the machiavelli and guicciardini clusters .",
    "the other tree presented in figure 3 is obtained by a whole - genome comparison of 27 prokaryotic genomes .",
    "this kind of analysis are now definitely possible thanks to the availability of completely sequenced genomes ( see for a similar approach  @xcite ) .",
    "our results appear as comparable with those obtained through other completely different `` whole - genome '' analysis ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "closely related species are correctly grouped ( as in the case of _",
    "e.coli _ and _ s.typhimurium_ , _ c.pneumoniae _ and _ c. trachomatis _ , _",
    "p. abyssi _ and _ p. horikoshii _ , etc ) , and",
    "some main groups of organisms are identified .",
    "it is known that the mono - nucleotide composition is a specie - specific property for a genome .",
    "this compositional property could affect our method : namely two genomes could appear as similar simply because of their similar c+g content . in order to rule out this hypothesis we performed a new analysis after shuffling genomic sequences and we noticed that the resulting new tree was completely different with respect to the one based on real sequences .",
    "in conclusion we have defined the dictionary of a sequence and we have shown how it can be helpful for information extraction purposes .",
    "dictionaries are intrinsically interesting and a statistical study of their properties can be a useful tool to investigate the strings they have been extracted from .",
    "in particular new results regarding the statistical study of dna sequences have been presented here . on the other hand ,",
    "we have proposed an integration of the string comparison procedure presented in  @xcite that exploits dictionaries by means of artificial texts .",
    "this method gives very good results in several contexts and we have focused here on self - classification problems , showing two similarity trees for corpora of written texts and dna sequences .",
