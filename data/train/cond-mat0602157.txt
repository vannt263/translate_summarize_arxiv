    "experimental advances involving atomic fermi gases enabled the control of interactions between atoms in different hyperfine states by using feshbach resonances  @xcite .",
    "these resonances can be tuned via an external magnetic field and allow the study of dilute many body systems with fixed density , but varying interaction strength characterized by the scattering parameter @xmath4 .",
    "this technique allows for the study of new phases of strongly interacting fermions .",
    "for instance , the recent experiments from the mit group  @xcite marked the first observation of vortices in atomic fermi gases corresponding to a strong signature of superfluidity in the @xmath1-wave ( @xmath5 ) channel .",
    "these studies combined  @xcite correspond to the experimental realization of the theoretically proposed bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) to bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) crossover  @xcite in three dimensional ( 3d ) @xmath1-wave superfluids .",
    "recent extensions of these ideas include trapped fermions  @xcite and fermion - boson models  @xcite .",
    "arguably one of the next frontiers of exploration in ultracold fermi systems is the search for superfluidity in higher angular momentum states ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "substantial experimental progress has been made recently  @xcite in connection to @xmath7-wave ( @xmath8 ) cold fermi gases , making them ideal candidates for the observation of novel triplet superfluid phases .",
    "these phases may be present not only in atomic , but also in nuclear ( pairing in nuclei ) , astrophysics ( neutron stars ) , and condensed matter ( organic superconductors ) systems .",
    "the tuning of @xmath7-wave interactions in ultracold fermi gases was initially explored via @xmath7-wave feshbach resonances in trap geometries for @xmath9 in ref .",
    "@xcite and @xmath10 in ref .",
    "@xcite . finding and sweeping through these resonances",
    "is difficult since they are much narrower than the @xmath1-wave case , because atoms interacting via higher angular momentum channels have to tunnel through a centrifugal barrier to couple to the bound state  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , while losses due to two body dipolar  @xcite or three - body  @xcite processes challenged earlier @xmath7-wave experiments , these losses were still present but were less dramatic in the very recent optical lattice experiment involving @xmath9 and @xmath7-wave feshbach resonances  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , due to the magnetic dipole - dipole interaction between valence electrons of alkali atoms , the nonzero angular momentum feshbach resonances corresponding to projections of angular momentum @xmath11 [ @xmath12 are nondegenerate ( separated from each other ) with total number of @xmath13 resonances  @xcite . therefore , in principle , these resonances can be tuned and studied independently if the separation between them is larger than the experimental resolution .",
    "since the ground state is highly dependent on the separation and detuning of these resonances , it is possible that @xmath7-wave superfluid phases can be studied from the bcs to the bec regime . for sufficiently large splittings",
    ", it has been proposed  @xcite that pairing occurs only in @xmath14 and does not occur in the @xmath15 states .",
    "however , for small splittings , pairing occurs via a linear combination of the @xmath14 and @xmath15 states .",
    "thus , the @xmath14 or @xmath15 resonances may be tuned and studied independently if the splitting is large enough in comparison to the experimental resolution .",
    "the bcs to bec evolution of @xmath16-wave ( @xmath17 ) superfluidity was discussed previously in the literature using continuum  @xcite and lattice  @xcite descriptions in connection to high-@xmath3 superconductivity .",
    "more recently , @xmath7-wave superfluidity was analyzed at @xmath0 for two hyperfine state ( ths ) systems in 3d  @xcite , and for single hyperfine state ( shs ) systems in two dimensions ( 2d )  @xcite , using fermion - only models .",
    "furthermore , fermion - boson models were proposed to describe @xmath7-wave superfluidity at zero  @xcite and finite temperature  @xcite in 3d .    in this manuscript , we present a generalization of the zero and finite temperature analysis of both ths pseudo - spin singlet and shs pseudo - spin triplet  @xcite superfluidity in 3d within a fermion - only description .",
    "our main results are as follows .    through an analysis of the low energy scattering amplitude within a t - matrix approach",
    ", we find that bound states occur only when the scattering parameter @xmath18 for any @xmath11 .",
    "the energy of the bound states @xmath19 involves only the scattering length @xmath20 for @xmath5 .",
    "however , another parameter @xmath21 related to the interaction range @xmath22 is necessary to characterize @xmath19 for @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , all superfluid properties for @xmath6 depend strongly on @xmath23 and @xmath4 , while for @xmath5 they depend strongly only on @xmath20 but weakly on @xmath23 .",
    "at zero temperature ( @xmath0 ) , we study the possibility of a topological quantum phase transition in @xmath6 atomic fermi gases during the evolution from bcs to bec regime  @xcite .",
    "we show that there is a fundamental difference between the @xmath5 and @xmath6 cases . in the @xmath1-wave ( @xmath5 )",
    "case , there is no phase transition as the magnetic field is tuned through the feshbach resonance from the bcs to the bec limit",
    ". that is , the zero temperature thermodynamic properties are analytic functions of the scattering length @xmath20 when the feshbach resonance is crossed . in this case",
    ", the superfluid ground state does not change in any fundamental way as @xmath20 is varied .",
    "this has been noted in the condensed matter literature long ago  @xcite and it is referred to as the bcs - bec crossover problem .",
    "however , for @xmath6 , we show that there is a phase transition as the magnetic field is swept through the @xmath6 feshbach resonance .",
    "the phase transition does not occur when two body bound states are first formed , but occurs when the many body chemical potential crosses a critical value .    to show that such a zero temperature ( quantum ) phase transition occurs in @xmath6 , we calculate the order parameter , chemical potential , quasiparticle excitation spectrum , momentum distribution , atomic compressibility , low energy collective excitations and average cooper pair size as a function of @xmath4 , and show that they are non - analytic at @xmath0 when the chemical potential @xmath24 crosses a critical value .",
    "the symmetry of the order parameter remains unchanged through the transition , as the ground state wavefunction experiences a major rearrangement of its analytic structure .",
    "in addition , the elementary excitations of the superfluid also change from gapless in the bcs side to fully gapped in the bec side leading to qualitatively different thermodynamic properties in both sides .",
    "thus , we conclude that there is a potentially observable bcs - bec phase transition in @xmath6 atomic fermi gases in contrast to the bcs - bec crossover already found in @xmath1-wave ( @xmath5 ) gases .    at finite temperatures ,",
    "we develop a gaussian fluctuation theory near the critical temperature ( @xmath25 ) to analyze the number of unbound , scattering and bound fermions as well as the chemical potential .",
    "we show that while the saddle point number equation is sufficient in weak coupling where all fermions are unbound , the fluctuation contributions have to be taken into account in order to recover the bec physics in strong couplings where all fermions are bound .",
    "we also derive the time - dependent ginzburg - landau ( tdgl ) functional near @xmath26 and extract the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) coherence length and time .",
    "we recover the usual tdgl equation for bcs superfluids in weak coupling , whereas in strong coupling we recover the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation for a weakly interacting dilute bose gas .",
    "the tdgl equation exhibits anisotropic coherence lengths for @xmath6 which become isotropic only in the bec limit , in sharp contrast to the @xmath5 case , where the coherence length is isotropic for all couplings .",
    "furthermore , for any @xmath11 , the gl time is a complex number with a larger imaginary component for @xmath27 reflecting the decay of cooper pairs into the two - particle continuum with short lifetimes .",
    "however , the imaginary component vanishes for @xmath28 and cooper pairs become stable with long lifetimes above @xmath26 .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : hamiltonian ] , we analyze the interaction potential in both real and momentum space for nonzero orbital momentum channels .",
    "we introduce the imaginary - time functional integration formalism in sec .",

    "[ sec : tdgl ] , we derive tdgl equation and extract the gl coherence length and time .",

    "a short summary of our conclusions is given in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] . finally , we present in appendices  [ sec : appa ] and  [ sec : appb ] the coefficients for the low frequency and long wavelength expansion of the action at zero and finite temperatures , respectively .",
    "the hamiltonian for a dilute fermi gas is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 labels the pseudo - spins corresponding to trapped hyperfine states and @xmath31 is the volume .",
    "these states are represented by the creation operator @xmath32 , and @xmath33 . here ,",
    "@xmath34 where @xmath35 is the energy and @xmath36 is the chemical potential of fermions .",
    "the interaction term can be written in a separable form @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the spin and @xmath39 is the spatial part , respectively . in the case of ths case , where @xmath40 , both pseudo - spin singlet and pseudo - spin triplet pairings are allowed .",
    "however , we concentrate on the pseudo - spin singlet ths state with @xmath41 in addition , we discuss the shs case ( @xmath42 ) , where only pseudo - spin triplet pairing is allowed , and the interaction is given by @xmath43 in this manuscript , we analyze ths singlet and shs triplet cases for all allowable angular momentum channels .",
    "ths triplet pairing is more involved due to the more complex nature of the vector order parameters , and therefore , we postpone this discussion for a future manuscript .    the two fermion interaction can be expanded as @xmath44 and should have the necessary symmetry under the parity operation , where the transformation @xmath45 or @xmath46 leads to @xmath47 for singlet , and @xmath48 for triplet pairing .",
    "furthermore , @xmath47 is invariant under the transformation @xmath49 , and @xmath47 reflects the pauli exclusion principle .    in order to obtain an approximate expression for the atomic interaction potential , we use the fourier expansion of a plane wave in 3d @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the spherical bessel function of order @xmath11 and @xmath52 is the spherical harmonic of order @xmath53 , in eq .",

    "in fact , for @xmath67 and @xmath68 , the asymptotic expression of the spherical bessel function for small arguments can be used , giving @xmath69 , with the coefficient @xmath70 dependent on the particular choice of the real space potential . in the opposite limit , where @xmath71 and @xmath72 , the potential is not separable . in this case , @xmath60 mixes different @xmath66 and @xmath73 , and shows an oscillatory behavior ( which is dependent on the exact form of @xmath61 ) with a decaying envelope that is proportional to @xmath74 .    under these circumstances",
    ", we choose to study a model potential that contains most of the features described above .",
    "one possibility is to retain only one of the @xmath11 terms in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : vsh ] ) , by assuming that the dominant contribution to the scattering process between fermionic atoms occurs in the @xmath11th angular momentum channel . this assumption may be experimentally relevant since atom - atom dipole interactions split different angular momentum channels such that they may be tuned independently . using the properties discussed above , we write @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the interaction strength , and",

    "however , for @xmath208 the imaginary component vanishes and cooper pairs become stable above @xmath26 .    in summary ,",
    "the bcs to bec evolution in higher angular momentum ( @xmath6 ) states exhibit quantum phase transitions and is much richer than in conventional @xmath5 @xmath1-wave systems , where there is only a crossover .",

    "<S> we analyze the evolution of superfluidity for nonzero orbital angular momentum channels from the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) to the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) limit in three dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> first , we analyze the low energy scattering properties of finite range interactions for all possible angular momentum channels . </S>",
    "<S> second , we discuss ground state ( @xmath0 ) superfluid properties including the order parameter , chemical potential , quasiparticle excitation spectrum , momentum distribution , atomic compressibility , ground state energy and low energy collective excitations . we show that a quantum phase transition occurs for nonzero angular momentum pairing , unlike the @xmath1-wave case where the bcs to bec evolution is just a crossover . </S>",
    "<S> third , we present a gaussian fluctuation theory near the critical temperature ( @xmath2 ) , and we analyze the number of bound , scattering and unbound fermions as well as the chemical potential . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we derive the time - dependent ginzburg - landau functional near @xmath3 , and compare the ginzburg - landau coherence length with the zero temperature average cooper pair size . </S>"
