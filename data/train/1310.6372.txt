    "microcanonical ensembles are those that maximize the entropy for a fixed value of internal energy ( figure [ fig : sm1]*a * ) .",
    "each microcanonical ensemble is mapped into the @xmath127 plane through equations [ eq:2.02.01 ] .",
    "all these ensembles together trace a curve that must be a function @xmath166 .",
    "otherwise , for a value of @xmath135 two or more values of @xmath134 would be assigned , and only one of them could me maximum .",
    "the lower values would not correspond to any microcanonical ensemble , accordingly .",
    "consider the situation in which @xmath140 increases monotonically .",
    "then a greater internal energy is always associated to a greater entropy , which intuitively makes sense .",
    "this bijectivity guarantees that @xmath140 matches the corresponding pareto front . for each @xmath167 necessarily @xmath168 ,",
    "thus in this curve there are not any two @xmath169 such that @xmath170 , which would imply @xmath171 .",
    "furthermore , any ensemble mapped into a point @xmath172 outside this curve is necessarily dominated by some microcanonical ensemble mapped into @xmath173 since by definition microcanonical ensembles are such that @xmath174 for that given value @xmath175 . summing up : i ) points along the curve @xmath140 are mutually non - dominated and ii ) for any physically plausible point @xmath176 outside this curve there is at least one point that belongs to the curve and dominates @xmath176 .",
    "this is the definition of the pareto front indeed .",
    "once microcanonical ensembles reconstruct the front of the proposed moo , the collapse into soos and phase transitions due to the shape of the front follow naturally because the free energy is minimized in thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "some mathematical idealizations of physical systems admit non - monotonically increasing entropies .",
    "these often lead to exotic parameterizations such as negative temperatures .",
    "furthermore they do not affect the current theory as we will show now .",
    "consider figures [ fig : sm1]*b * and * c * regardless of the physical reality of such descriptions .",
    "the equilibrium thermodynamics of such hypothetical systems are still well represented by the convex hull of the pareto front , hence out theoretical framework remains true .",
    "given the definition of dominance , we note that the pareto front of the relevant moo problem is still fully reconstructed by the curve @xmath140 ( thick stretches in figures [ fig : sm1]*b - c * ) .",
    "non - increasing stretches of @xmath140 lay inside a cavity ( figure [ fig : sm1]*b * ) or after the global maximum of the function ( figure [ fig : sm1]*c * ) .",
    "if they are inside a cavity , such situations never show up in thermodynamic equilibrium , whose canonical ensembles are strictly mapped into the convex hull of the front .",
    "these points are bypassed by a first order phase transitions . in the other situation",
    ", the slope of the pareto front at the global maximum ( whose limit from below is perfectly reconstructed by the microcanonical ensemble ) is necessarily @xmath177 , meaning that such situation is only reached at @xmath178 .",
    "reaching solutions beyond the global maximum implies considering @xmath179 , which is not realistic .",
    "thus non monotonously increasing functions @xmath140 do not affect the general framework because they are situations that we are not concerned with in thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "for moo - soo systems others than thermodynamics we do not rely on microcanonical ensembles , but on the pareto front straightaway , in which non - dominated regions ( including curves that would break the monotonic trend of the front ) never show up .",
    "+ our work follows closely some ideas from gibbs @xcite that did not become so mainstream in the study of statistical mechanics .",
    "gibbs s _ graphic method _",
    "relied on the existence of a surface upon which all possible states of a thermodynamic species in equilibrium dwell .",
    "this surface is defined by the gibbs potential @xmath180 , which plays the role of equation [ eq:2.01.01 ] both in thermodynamics and in our theoretical framework .",
    "we identify the target functions @xmath135 , @xmath134 , and @xmath181 and the control parameters @xmath182 and @xmath183 .",
    "the tangent plane at a given point of the surface is defined by a normal vector whose components are precisely related to the pressure and temperature of that equilibrium state @xcite .",
    "it was argued that an moo approach might be adequate when the different targets can not be compared ( e.g. if they have different units ) . in thermodynamics , the control parameters @xmath182 and @xmath183 transform different potentials into the same units . at fixed temperature entropy is heat and at fixed pressure volume is work  hence a low entropy and an unoccupied volume are available free energy . all free energy must be utilized to reach the thermodynamic equilibrium @xcite so that @xmath184 is minimized and only the convex hull of the gibbs surface shows up . when changing @xmath182 or @xmath183 quasistatically , concavities are bypassed revealing first order phase transitions .",
    "sharp edges are consistently related to second order phase transitions again .",
    "this ingenious picture received renewed attention recently @xcite and is connected to the concept of ensemble inequivalence @xcite .",
    "the gibbs surface is fabricated thanks to the microcanonical ensemble and it can be convex or concave , while a thermodynamic canonical ensemble can only be convex ( note that we use a different convention for concavity / convexity ) . whenever @xmath185 becomes concave both ensembles must diverge geometrically in the @xmath186 space .",
    "this makes the canonical ensemble non - analytic at the inequivalence points which is reflected as a first order phase transition in the corresponding physical system .",
    "as noted in the main text , the ising and the potts models and more general versions of them have been solved using the concept of ensemble inequivalence @xcite , which is comprehensively explained by the pareto optimality approach introduced here .",
    "we illustrate thermodynamic phase transitions with the pareto front through these models because of their historical importance and because they allow a complete analytical treatment .",
    "the details of the calculations follow .",
    "we use a standard mean - field hamiltonian for the ising model @xmath187 with @xmath142 the coupling constant and the sum running over @xmath60 neighboring spins .",
    "we parameterize the system with the probability @xmath183 that we find the mean - field spin in the _ up _ state .",
    "it becomes easy to write down the entropy and the internal energy of the system in terms of @xmath183 : @xmath188 solving this last expression for @xmath183 , we can also write the entropy as a function of the internal energy alone : @xmath189 with : @xmath190    equation [ eq : app2.01.02 ] ( represented in figure [ fig:6]*a * ) gives us @xmath134 as a function of @xmath135 ( @xmath140 ) for all possible states that the model can be found into , disregard of whether or not these states correspond to thermodynamic equilibrium situations or to microcanonical ensembles . because for this model equation [ eq : app2.01.02 ] is a function , for each @xmath135 @xmath191",
    "is also maximal ",
    "i.e. every state of the system corresponds to a microcanonical ensemble itself .",
    "this is luckily valid for this one model , but not necessarily true in a general case .",
    "this curve also constitutes the pareto front of the corresponding moo problem ( minimizing @xmath135 and maximizing @xmath134 from equations [ eq:2.02.01 ] ) , as is expected given the correspondence between the microcanonical ensembles and pareto optimal solutions .",
    "let us analyze the pareto optimality of equation [ eq : app2.01.02 ] .",
    "first we note that @xmath191 is only real and well defined for @xmath192 $ ] , the range of available energies for the model . in this range : @xmath193 thus @xmath191 is monotonously increasing , which guarantees that its points in the @xmath127 plane do not dominate each other regarding energy minimization and entropy maximization .",
    "because this curve comprises everything that is possible in the system under research and because its constituting points are mutually non - dominated , it must be the pareto front itself .",
    "besides , @xmath194 is positive and monotonously decreasing for @xmath195 ; thus there are not concavities in the pareto front : we rule out first order phase transitions .",
    "we can also rule out second order phase transitions in the interior of @xmath195 because the derivative is well defined everywhere .",
    "second order phase transitions are thus restricted to @xmath196 or @xmath197 .",
    "we inspect @xmath194 as @xmath135 tends to these points .",
    "after some algebra we arrive to : @xmath198 and : @xmath199",
    "as we saw in the results section , for the soo posed at temperature @xmath200 we typically reach points of the pareto front where their tangent matches the slope of the corresponding @xmath201 .",
    "the derivative @xmath202 as we approach @xmath196 is infinite , meaning that we will reach this end of the pareto front only at @xmath203 ( zero temperature ) .",
    "there is not any remarkable behavior here . at the other end of the pareto front",
    "the derivative is not @xmath177 , but a finite positive number .",
    "this means that already for @xmath204 the free energy optimum ",
    "i.e. the soo solution  is located at the upper right end of the front which corresponds to the state with more entropy and energy .",
    "if we further decrease @xmath145 we will not be reaching any novel solutions : the soo optima remain the most entropic state of the system . going back to the well behaved range of @xmath145 , as we increase it above @xmath205 the soo solutions begin to roll over the pareto front continuously .",
    "the transition between a persistent solution for @xmath206 $ ] and a varying solution in the regime @xmath207 implies a discontinuity in the derivative of any order parameter .",
    "this is analogous to the cases illustrated in figure [ fig:3 ] of the main text , and is associated to second order phase transitions as the one that we know that the mean - field ising model undergoes at precisely @xmath208 .",
    "we repeat the same operations with the bragg - williams approximation to the potts model .",
    "this has been solved somewhere else @xcite using other methods .",
    "this choice of implementing the mean - field presents first order phase transitions for any @xmath209 , where @xmath210 is the number of available states for each spin . for a discussion of the braggs - williams against other mean - field approaches to the potts model see @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we write down the entropy and energy of the system : @xmath211 with @xmath142 and @xmath60 still the coupling and the number of neighbors . now",
    "@xmath135 and @xmath134 are parameterized by the probabilities @xmath212 ( @xmath213 ) of finding a spin in each of the @xmath209 states .",
    "the normalization @xmath214 means that there are @xmath215 parameters and we can not write @xmath140 as before unless we make some assumption .",
    "let us prefer one arbitrary state ( say @xmath216 ) over the others .",
    "let us call @xmath183 to the probability of finding a spin in that preferred state , and let us further assume that any other state is equally likely @xmath217 , now with @xmath218 .",
    "this is analytically justified in the literature @xcite and later by our arguments about pareto dominance .",
    "we note that , unlike for the ising model , states compatible with the premises of the system will not usually be constrained to a curve because we have too many degrees of freedom . in figure",
    "[ fig:6]*b * ( main text )",
    "we represent a sample of valid points for @xmath219 : all of them can happen in theory ( they are mathematically valid descriptions of the system ) .",
    "a few of them pareto dominate some others thus not all of these configurations will be reached in thermodynamic equilibrium .    thanks to the previous symmetry breaking to favor one state over the others we can write down the following curve : @xmath220 this is the counterpart of equation [ eq : app2.01.02 ] only now : @xmath221}.",
    "\\label{eq : app2.02.03 }          \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equation [ eq : app2.02.02 ] is represented in figure [ fig:6]*b * of the main text for @xmath219 .",
    "we can appreciate that it is monotonously growing as a function of @xmath135 : its points are mutually non - dominated and constitute the pareto front .",
    "the fact that there is not any point in the previous sample that pareto dominates any point in this curve suggests that our symmetry breaking hypothesis ( favoring one spin state over the others ) is correct .",
    "it can be analytically proved , indeed @xcite .",
    "although it is visually difficult to appreciate , a concavity exists in the upper right part of the pareto front .",
    "this becomes more obvious when analyzing @xmath194 ( figure [ fig:6]*c * of the main text ) , which is not monotonously decreasing .",
    "most of the pareto front is continually visited : as we vary @xmath145 , the soo solutions roll over its convex lower - left part .",
    "it can be shown once more that the less energetic extreme of the front is reached only for @xmath222 and @xmath223 , so that there is not any remarkable feature in that temperature range .",
    "once again , it exists a value @xmath224 below which the solution is persistently the most entropic one . at exactly @xmath225",
    "that solution coexists with another one in the convex part of @xmath191 .",
    "to locate @xmath224 we plot @xmath194 and we compare it to the slope @xmath226 of the straight line that connects the top - right extreme with other points along the pareto front ( main text , figure [ fig:6]*c * , inset ) .",
    "where both functions intersect we have identified the phases that coexist .",
    "the straight line that connects these phases has slope @xmath224 precisely .",
    "we collect @xmath224 for the potts models with different parameter values @xmath210 in figure [ fig : sm2]*b*. these results match those known from the literature @xcite .",
    "because the two coexisting solutions are far away in the pareto front , at @xmath227 these systems undergo a drastic change  as opposed to the continuous transition from the ising model .",
    "this is similar to the first order phase transition situation illustrated in figure [ fig:4 ] of the main text .",
    "this is the kind of phase transition that we know that our model presents .    in figure",
    "[ fig : sm2 ] we represent the pareto front for many values of @xmath210 .",
    "we observe that solutions for @xmath210 dominate solutions for any @xmath228 , leading to the interesting ( while trivial ) observation that an instance with higher @xmath210 does not spontaneously decay towards one with less available states by setting some @xmath229 .",
