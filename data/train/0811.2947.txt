    "horizontal branch ( hb ) stars have long played a central role in the age debate .",
    "these low - mass stars , which burn helium in the core and hydrogen in a shell , are the immediate progeny of the luminous , vigorously mass - losing red giant branch ( rgb ) stars .",
    "most importantly in the present context , their temperatures depend strongly on their total masses .",
    "more specifically , the lower the mass of an hb star , the bluer it becomes , by the time it reaches the zero - age hb ( zahb ) .",
    "therefore , the hb morphology in globular clusters ( gc s ) is naturally expected to become bluer with age .",
    "it has long been known that the _ first parameter _ controlling hb morphology is actually metallicity , with more metal - rich gc s presenting redder hb s than their more metal - poor counterparts .",
    "still , @xcite first realized , based mainly on the early observations of the gc s m3 ( ngc  5272 ) , m13 ( ngc  6205 ) , and m22 ( ngc  6656 ) by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , that gc s with a _ given _ metallicity might also present widely different hb types , due to the action of an unknown `` second parameter . ''",

    "indeed , the presence of bimodal hb s in such gc s as ngc  2808 have long pointed to the need for other second parameters in addition to age ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "recent , deep cmd studies have revealed that some of the most massive globulars , ngc  2808 included , present a surprisingly complex history of star formation , with the presence of extreme levels of helium enhancement among at least some of their stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as noted by these authors , such he enhancement would provide a natural explanation for the presence of hot hb stars in these clusters .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .    in the next few sections",
    ", we will address some empirical constraints that may be posed on some of these second parameter candidates .",
    "in order to reliably predict the temperature of an hb star of a given composition and age , we must know how much mass it loses on the rgb .",
    "unfortunately , our knowledge of rgb mass loss remains rather limited .",
    "most studies adopt the @xcite mass loss formula to predict the integrated mass loss along the rgb .",
    "however , recent evidence indicates that the @xcite formula is not a reliable description of rgb mass loss ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , there are several alternative mass loss formulations which may better describe the available data .",
    "we illustrate this point by comparing , in figure  [ fig : sc - dm ] , some empirical mass loss rates with the predicted rates from several of these alternative mass loss formulae ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for extensive references ) .",
    "while the @xcite formula is clearly inconsistent with the data , the empirical data can not conclusively distinguish among these alternative formulations .",
    "the serious problem which this uncertainty in the rgb mass loss poses for our understanding of hb morphology and its dependence on age and metallicity is apparent from figure  [ fig : dm - age - feh ] , where the integrated rgb mass loss is plotted as a function of the age for fixed metallicity ( panels _ a _ through _ c _ ) and as a function of metallicity for fixed age ( panels _ d _ through _ f _ ) .",
    "more specifically , we know that only a very mild @xmath7}$ ] dependence can account for the observed relation between hb type and [ fe / h ] without resorting to a significant age - metallicity relation ( see , e.g. , fig",
    ".  1a in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this sense , we find that the @xcite and @xcite mass loss formulae lead to the weakest @xmath7}$ ] dependence .",
    "all other formulae that we have tested lead to steeper dependencies between @xmath8 and [ fe / h ] than the @xcite relation , thus implying steeper dependencies between age and metallicity as well .",
    "the precise dependence between @xmath8 and metallicity is also important in terms of explaining the ultraviolet upturn phenomenon of elliptical galaxies and spiral bulges ( see * ? ? ? * for a recent review ) .",
    "similarly , a stronger dependence between @xmath8 and age at fixed [ fe / h ] makes it easier to account for a given second - parameter pair in terms solely of an age difference .",
    "according to figure  [ fig : dm - age - feh ] , the equation that is most successful in this regard is a modified version of the @xcite formula , in which the adopted power law exponents are obtained by a least - squares fit to the @xcite data , selected as in @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sc - dm]_e _ ) . while not the steepest , the original @xcite formula provides a stronger dependence between @xmath8 and age than does the @xcite formula , which should reduce the required age difference between second parameter pairs .",
    "by contrast , the @xcite equation shows the weakest dependence , with a remarkably constant integrated @xmath8 value over a wide range in ages .",
    "as previously noted (  1 ) , high levels of helium enrichment have been detected among some of the most massive galactic gc s .",
    "very recently , it has been suggested that such helium enhancements are in fact not the exception , but indeed the rule , among galactic gc s @xcite .",
    "here we provide a first test of this scenario , in the case of the gc s m3 and ngc  1851 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite claim that the blue hb component in m3 owes its origin to a moderate level of he enhancement in the cluster , between 2% and 6% .",
    "is this supported by the available data ?    to answer this question , we compare , in figure  [ fig : m3 ] , canonical theoretical predictions from @xcite and @xcite for a helium abundance of @xmath9 and a metallicity @xmath6 with high - precision photometry , in the @xcite system , from @xcite .",
    "the empirical data were corrected for reddening following @xcite . in these plots ,",
    "the drawn lines represent different fiducial loci , as follows : zahb , middle - age hb ( mahb , or average locus occupied by the hb stars ) , 90%-age hb ( 90ahb , or locus below which one should expect to find about 90% of all hb stars ) , and terminal - age hb ( tahb , or he exhaustion locus ) . except for a discrepancy between the predicted and observed numbers of highly evolved stars ( both on the blue _ and _ red hb sides of the distribution ) that was previously noted by @xcite ,",
    "one finds remarkable agreement between the model predictions for a constant @xmath10 and the observations .",
    "such an agreement is also confirmed by the spectroscopic data from @xcite , as can be seen from figure  [ fig : m3-logg ] , where we limit the comparison to temperatures lower than 11,500  k due to the well - known complications brought about by the `` grundahl jump '' phenomenon @xcite .",
    "interestingly , this plot also appears to support a similar helium abundance between m3 s blue hb stars and the redder blue hb stars in m13 .    )",

    "width=511 ]    , but for ngc  1851.,width=439 ]    , but showing zahb s for the several different indicated @xmath11 values .",
    "interpolated zahb s are also plotted between the 23% and 28% loci , at intervals of 1%.,width=439 ]      @xcite have recently discovered that the subgiant branch ( sgb ) of ngc  1851 is actually split into two separate components , which may be linked to the cluster s well - known bimodal hb morphology . the most straightforward explanation for this split would be a difference in age by @xmath12  gyr .",
    "however , as shown in figure  [ fig : n1851-ages ] , this is inconsistent with the age difference that would be required to fully account for the separation between the blue and red hb components of the cluster , irrespective of the mass loss formula (  [ sec : dm ] ) used . a difference in metallicity between the two components is also ruled out by recent spectroscopic data ( @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "here we apply the same cmd test as in the previous section to constrain the possibility of a difference in @xmath10 between the two components as being responsible for the well - known bimodal nature of the cluster s hb .    the result is shown in figure  [ fig : n1851 ] . while the quality of the data is not as high as in the case of m3 , one is still able to derive some general conclusions .",
    "first , the same theoretical zahb does appear to provide a reasonable description of the lower boundary of the data , both for the red and blue hb components   which suggests that at least some of the stars on the blue hb have the same @xmath10 as do the red hb stars .",
    "second , there is a predominance of overluminous stars on the blue hb , at colors around @xmath13 .",
    "while these might in principle be interpreted in terms of a moderate level of helium enrichment , perhaps of the order of @xmath14 on average ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : n1851-y ] ) , the more straightforward explanation is that these stars actually represent the well - evolved progeny of the blue zahb stars that are found at higher temperatures .",
    "if so , this would again suggest that the late stages of hb evolution are somehow significantly underestimated by present - day hb tracks , similar to what was previously found elsewhere ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "clearly , more work is needed before we are able to conclusively establish the nature of ngc  1851 s bimodal hb and sgb ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "irrespective of our ability to properly model hb stars , we can use rr lyrae stars to derive entirely empirical constraints on the process of formation of the milky way . in the @xcite scenario ,",
    "much like in modern @xmath15cdm cosmology , one expects galaxies such as our own to have formed by the accretion of `` protogalactic fragments '' that may have resembled the early counterparts of the milky way s present - day dwarf satellite galaxies .",
    "useful constraints on recent accretion events may be posed by the presence of younger stellar populations in several of these galaxies @xcite .",
    "still , in order to probe what happened _ very early on _ , we must look at the ancient components   and rr lyrae stars are especially useful in that regard ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "are the ancient populations in the milky way s dwarf satellites , as traced by their rr lyrae pulsators , consistent with the galactic spheroid having been built therefrom ?",
    "the answer is provided in figure  [ fig : oost ] , where we compare the average properties of the fundamental - mode ( ab - type ) rr lyrae stars in galactic ( _ left panel _ ) vs. nearby extragalactic ( _ right panel _ ) gc s and field populations . while the galactic distribution clearly presents the so - called _ oosterhoff dichotomy _ , with a tendency for systems to clump around the `` oosterhoff i '' ( ooi ) and `` oosterhoff ii '' ( ooii ) regions ( see also * ? ? ? * for the case of halo field stars ) , the opposite happens in the case of nearby extragalactic systems , which tend to be preferentially _ oosterhoff - intermediate_. this strongly suggests that the oldest components of the galaxy can not have been formed by accretion of even the early counterparts of its present - day dwarf galaxy satellites .",
    "as indicated in figure  [ fig : oost ] , at least one of the newly discovered sdss dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , cvn  i , is oosterhoff intermediate @xcite , whereas the bootes dwarf is ooii @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , some of the low - mass sdss galaxies seem to harbor a mere one or two rr lyrae stars , which makes it more difficult to assign a conclusive oosterhoff status to them . indeed , due to statistical fluctuations , and since the hb lifetime is of order 100  myr , it is not entirely clear whether the same oosterhoff types would necessarily be inferred for these galaxies if they were observed , say , a few hundred myr in the future ( which is very little , in terms of galactic history ) , when these hb stars will have long left the hb phase , to be replaced by an entirely new generation of hb stars .",
    "still , the present - day properties for several of the rr lyrae stars that are found in these very low - mass galaxies do appear to be consistent with an ooii status ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* hb stars play a central role in the age debate . still ,",
    "before we are able to predict how ( za)hb temperature changes with age , we must properly describe rgb mass loss . * in studies of hb morphology",
    ", it is not sufficient anymore to analyze solely the `` horizontal '' hb morphology , meaning the temperature and/or color distribution of hb stars : _ `` vertical '' _ hb morphology , or the distribution of hb stars in luminosity _ at fixed temperature ( or color ) _ , provides us with unique information to help us constrain theoretical scenarios for the origin and evolution of these stars .",
