    "an @xmath0-step uniform random walk in @xmath1 starts at the origin and consists of @xmath0 independent steps of length @xmath2 , each of which is taken into a uniformly random direction .",
    "in other words , each step corresponds to a random vector uniformly distributed on the unit sphere .",
    "the study of such walks originates with pearson @xcite , who was interested in planar walks , which he looked at @xcite as migrations of , for instance , mosquitos moving a step after each breeding cycle .",
    "random walks in three dimensions ( known as random flights ) seem first to have been studied in extenso by rayleigh @xcite , and higher dimensions are touched upon in @xcite .",
    "this paper is a companion to @xcite and @xcite , which studied the analytic and number theoretic behaviour of short uniform random walks in the plane ( five steps or less ) . in this work",
    "we revisit the same issues in higher dimensions . somewhat to our surprise , we are able to provide complete extensions for most of the central results in the culminating paper @xcite .    throughout the paper ,",
    "@xmath0 and @xmath3 are the positive integers corresponding to the number of steps and the dimension of the random walk we are considering .",
    "moreover , we denote with @xmath4 the half - integer @xmath5 it turns out that most results are more naturally expressed in terms of this parameter @xmath4 , and so we denote , for instance , with @xmath6 the probability density function of the distance to the origin after @xmath0 random unit steps in @xmath1 . in section  [ ssec :",
    "den ] , we mostly follow the account in @xcite and develop the basic bessel integral representations for these densities beginning with theorems  [ thm : bi ] and [ thm : pn : besseld ] , which are central to our analysis . in particular , a brief discussion of the ( elementary ) case of odd dimensions is included in section [ ssec : odd ] .    in section [ ssec : mom ] , we turn to general results on the associated moment functions @xmath7 in particular , we derive in theorem  [ thm : w : even ] a formula for the even moments @xmath8 as a multiple sum over the product of multinomial coefficients . as a consequence ,",
    "we observe another interpretation of the catalan numbers as the even moments of the distance after two random steps in four dimensions , and realize , more generally , in example  [ eg : w : values4d ] the moments in four dimensions in terms of powers of the narayana triangular matrix .",
    "we shall see that dimensions two and four are privileged in that all even moments are integral only in those two dimensions .    in section  [ sec : mom ]",
    ", we turn to a detailed analysis of the moments of short step walks : from two - step walks ( [ ssec : mom2 ] ) through five steps ( [ ssec : mom5 ] ) .",
    "for instance , we show in , theorem  [ thm : w3:gf ] and example  [ eg : w4:ogf ] that the ordinary generating functions of the even moments for @xmath9 can be expressed in terms of hypergeometric functions .",
    "we are also able to give closed forms for all odd moments for less than five steps .    in section  [ sec : den ] , we perform a corresponding analysis of the densities @xmath6 : from two - step walks ( [ ssec : den2 ] ) through five steps ( [ ssec : den5 ] ) .",
    "one especially striking result for @xmath10 , shown in corollary  [ cor : fe3 ] , is the following functional equation for the probability density function @xmath11 . for @xmath12 , and each half - integer @xmath13 , the function @xmath14 satisfies the functional equation @xmath15 finally , in section  [ sec : conc ] , we make some concluding remarks and leave several open questions .",
    "as much as possible , we keep our notation consistent with that in @xcite , and especially @xcite , to which we refer for details of how to exploit the mellin transform and similar matters .",
    "random walks in higher dimensions are also briefly discussed in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  4 ) .",
    "in particular , wan gives evaluations in arbitrary dimensions for the second moments , which we consider and generalize in example  [ eg : w : smallk ] , as well as for two - step walks .",

    "* chapter  2.2 ) of how to determine the probability density function @xmath6 of an @xmath0-step random walk in @xmath3 dimensions .",

    "[ thm : bi ] the probability density function of the distance to the origin in @xmath22 dimensions after @xmath23 steps is , for @xmath24 , @xmath25 where , as introduced in , @xmath26 .    let @xmath27 be a random vector , which is uniformly distributed on the unit sphere in @xmath1 .",

    "the intuition behind this observation is as follows : as the dimension @xmath3 increases , the directions of each of the @xmath0 random steps increasingly tend to be close to orthogonal to each other .",
    "that is , given an incoming direction , the direction of the next step will probably belong to a hyperplane which is almost orthogonal to this direction .",
