    "according to the scaling theory of localization@xcite , all electrons in a disordered two - dimensional system are localized in the absence of a magnetic field . in the presence of a strong magnetic field @xmath0 , a series of disorder - broadened landau bands ( lbs ) will appear , and an extended state resides at the center of each band while states at other energies are localized@xcite . the integrally quantized hall plateaus ( iqhp )",
    "are observed when the fermi level lies in localized states , with the value of the hall conductance , @xmath1 , related to the number of occupied extended states(@xmath2 ) .",
    "many previous studies@xcite have been focused on so - called plateau transitions .",
    "the issue there is how the hall conductance jumps from one quantized value to another when the fermi level crosses an extended state .",
    "there are two competing proposals .",
    "one is the global phase diagram@xcite based on the levitation of extended states conjectured by khmelnitskii@xcite and laughlin@xcite .",
    "a crucial prediction of this phase diagram is that an integer quantum hall effect ( iqhe ) state @xmath2 in general can only go into another iqhe states @xmath3 , and that a transition into an insulating state is allowed only from the @xmath4 state .",
    "the other is so - called direct transition phase diagram@xcite in which transitions from any iqhe state to the insulating phase are allowed when the disorder is increased at fixed @xmath0 .",
    "so far , most experiments@xcite are consistent with the direct transition phase diagram although the early experiments were interpreted in terms of the global phase diagram .",
    "one important yet overlooked issue regarding iqhe is the _ nature _ of both plateau - plateau and plateau - insulator transitions . in all existing theoretical studies ,",
    "these transitions are assumed to be continuous quantum phase transitions .",
    "this assumption is mainly due to the early scaling experiments@xcite .",
    "the fingerprint of a continuous phase transition is scaling laws around the transition point . in the case of iqhe ,",
    "it means algebraic divergence of longitudinal resistance slope and algebraic shrinkage of longitudinal resistance peak width in temperature @xmath5 at the transition point .",
    "however , some experiments show that longitudinal resistance slope remains finite@xcite and resistance peak width remains nonzero@xcite when extrapolated to zero temperature .",
    "this implies a _ non - scaling _ behavior around a transition point , contradicting the expectation of continuous quantum phase transitions suggested by the theories .",
    "thus the nature of these transitions should be re - examined .",
    "the samples used in the non - scaling experiments@xcite are relatively dirty , and strong disorders should lead to a strong inter - landau - band mixing . in a recent letter@xcite",
    ", we showed that the single extended state at each lb center broadens into a narrow band of extended states when the interband mixing of _ opposite chirality _ is taken into account .",
    "a narrow metallic phase exists between two adjacent iqhe phases and between an iqhe phase and the insulating phase . a plateau - plateau or",
    "plateau - insulator transition corresponds to two consecutive quantum phase transitions instead of one as suggested by existing theories .",
    "this possibility is usually overlooked in previous studies where each longitudinal conductance peak is related to a single extended state@xcite . in this paper",
    "we shall present the detailed description of this study .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the semiclassical network model for two coupled lbs is illustrated in sec .",
    "it is shown that mixing of localized states of _ opposite chirality _ tends to delocalize a state while mixing of states of the same chirality does not .",
    "the similarities and differences between the case we consider and models for double layer systems and spin - degenerate systems are also discussed .",
    "our approach , level - statistics technique , is described in sec .",
    "iv has four subsections containing our numerical results , conclusions and discussions .",
    "iv a provides our main numerical results and conclusions . in sec .",
    "iv b , possible finite size effects and a theoretical understanding for non - scaling behaviors based on standard scaling theory@xcite are discussed .",
    "iv c gives further numerical results which directly show a narrow band of extended states in several cases , and a new phase diagram of quantum hall systems is proposed . to further support our results , in sec .",
    "iv d we reanalyze the original data from the non - scaling experiments@xcite and show that the non - scaling behaviors in each iqhp - insulator transition can be attributed to two quantum phase transition points .",
    "recent experiments@xcite , in which scaling behaviors are observed , are also discussed and shown to be not inconsistent with early non - scaling experiments and our numerical results .",
    "the conclusions of this paper are summarized in sec .",
    "according to the semiclassical theory@xcite , the motion of an electron in a strong magnetic field and in a smooth random potential can be decomposed into a rapid cyclotron motion and a slow drifting motion of its guiding center .",
    "the kinetic energy of the cyclotron motion is quantized by @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the cyclotron frequency and @xmath2 the lb index .",
    "the trajectory of the drifting motion of the guiding center is thus along an equipotential contour of value @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the total energy of the electron .",
    "the local drifting velocity @xmath10 is determined by ( in si unit ) @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the local potential gradient .",
    "the equipotential contour consists of many closed loops .",
    "neglect quantum tunnelling effects , each loop corresponds to trajectory of one eigenstate . the motion of electrons are thus confined around these loops with deviations typically order of the cyclotron radius @xmath13 .    .",
    "dashed lines denote quantum tunnellings .",
    "the arrows indicate the drifting direction .",

    "dashed lines denote quantum tunnellings .",
    "the arrows indicate the drifting direction .",
    "( b ) loops localized around a valley and a peak , respectively .",
    "the arrows inside a loop show the directions of local potential gradient around the peak or valley .",
    "the arrows on a loop indicate the drifting direction.,title=\"fig:\",width=151,height=207 ]    to illustrate this semiclassical picture , let us think of the smooth random potential as a landscape of many peaks and valleys distributed randomly in the plane .",
    "imagine that the landscape is filled with water up to a height of value @xmath14 .",
    "the equipotential contour of value @xmath14 is the boundary of land and water . according to the percolation theory@xcite ,",
    "the percolation threshold of a two - dimensional ( 2d ) continuum model is @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the occupation probability of the medium ( the land or the water ) . for simplicity",
    ", we suppose that the distribution of the random potential is symmetric around zero . by symmetry",
    "the percolation point of both the land and the water is at @xmath17 in this case . when @xmath18 , the occupation probability of land is above @xmath19 .",
    "thus the land percolates and the water forms isolated lakes .",
    "these lakes are around valleys and their boundaries correspond to trajectories of localized states . in the case of @xmath20 ,",
    "the water forms a percolating sea and the land becomes isolated islands around potential peaks .",
    "the boundary of each island is an electronic state . in short , semiclassical electronic states in a qh system",
    "are equipotential loops .",
    "these loops are localized around potential peaks for @xmath20 and around potential valleys for @xmath18 .",
    "the drifting direction of each loop is _ unidirectional_.",
    "this means that they are chiral states . from eq .",
    "[ drift ] one can see that states around peaks have _ opposite chirality _ from states around valleys because the directions of the local potential gradient around a peak is opposite to that around a valley .",
    "if one views the plane from the direction opposite to the magnetic field , the drifting is clockwise around valleys and counter - clockwise around peaks , as shown in fig.[1channel ] .",
    "right at @xmath17 both the land and the water percolate , and the intersection between them is the trajectory of an extended state .",
    "it means that there is only one extended state at @xmath17 for each lb . as @xmath14 approaches zero from both sides",
    ", the localization length @xmath21 of the system tends to diverge as @xmath22 where the critical exponent @xmath23 according to the classical percolation theory .",
    "quantum effects are ignored in the above semiclassical argument .",
    "when two spatially separated loops on the same equipotential contour come close at saddle points of the random potential , quantum tunnellings should be considered .",
    "an example in the case of @xmath18 is shown in fig.[1channel](a ) . in the absence of interband",
    "mixing , numerical calculations have suggested that there is still only one extended state in each lb while the value of the critical exponent @xmath24 is modified to be around @xmath25@xcite .",
    "is the density of states . @xmath26 and @xmath27 denote the centers of the two bands .",
    "( b ) schematic plot of the two sets of equipotential loops on the two - dimensional random potential for electronic states of energy @xmath9 shown in ( a ) .",
    "it is the projection of a three - dimensional landscape on a 2d vertical plane .",
    "the solid curve represents the schematic plot of the 2d random potential .",
    "two dashed horizontal lines indicate two constant potential planes @xmath28 , one for the lower band with @xmath29 and the other for the upper band with @xmath30 .",
    "the ellipses denote the loops where the two constant potential planes intersect with the 2d random potential .",
    "arrows on the loops show drifting directions .",
    "@xmath31 is the magnetic field.,width=302,height=264 ]    in the case when the width of the lbs is comparable with the spacing between adjacent lbs ( the landau gap ) , and inter - landau - band mixing should no longer be ignored . in order to investigate the consequences of inter - landau - band mixing",
    ", we shall consider a simple system of two adjacent lbs . since we are interested in interband - mixing of opposite chirality , we consider those states with energy between the lower and the upper bands whose centers are at @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively , as shown in fig.[twoband](a ) .",
    "thus , equipotential loops are @xmath34 and @xmath35 for the lower and the upper lbs , respectively . using the semiclassical theory described in the previous paragraphs",
    ", states from the upper band should move along equipotential loops around potential valleys while those from the lower band around potential peaks as shown in fig.[twoband](b ) .",
    "the loops for the upper band drift in clockwise direction , and those for the lower band in the counter - clockwise direction .",
    "these two sets of loops are thus spatially separated and have _",
    "opposite chirality_. if we assume that peaks and valleys of random potential form two coupled square lattices , the loops can be arranged as shown in fig .",
    "[ network](a ) , where _ p _ and _ v _ denote peaks and valleys , respectively . in the absence of interband",
    "mixing , the model is reduced to two decoupled single - band models and all electronic states between the two lbs are localized .",
    "if we introduce interband mixing , the localized loops may become less localized . to see this , let us consider an extreme case with no tunnellings at saddle points , but with such a strong interband mixing that an electron will move from a loop around a valley to its neighboring loop around a peak and vice versa , as shown by @xmath36 in fig.[network](a ) .",
    "follow the trajectory of an electron starting at a , it will be @xmath37 .",
    "the electron is no longer confined on a closed loop , but delocalized !    before going on , we would like to make a short discussion on the relation between large disorder magnitude and weak magnetic field .",
    "the above semiclassical picture for the network model is valid only when the typical fluctuation length of random potential , denoted by @xmath38 , is much larger than the magnetic length @xmath13 .",
    "let us take @xmath38 as a large fixed value .",
    "then , the effect of inter - band mixing is controlled mainly by two parameters .",
    "one is the ratio of disorder magnitude @xmath39 and landau gap @xmath40 , which is proportional to @xmath41 and determines whether inter - band mixing needs to be considered .",
    "the other is the ratio of the magnetic length @xmath42 and the typical distance between an upper - band loop and its neighboring lower - band loop @xmath43 , which is proportional to @xmath44 and determines the typical strength of inter - band mixing in the network model",
    ". therefore , the cases of strong disorder @xmath39 and weak magnetic field @xmath0 are , to some extent , equivalent in the network model since both of them lead to large inter - band mixing . of cause , values of local potential gradients are also important , since they determine the detailed distribution of inter - band mixing in the model .    in the one - band model , an electron can also hop from one loop to its neighboring loops by quantum tunnellings . at a first glance",
    ", this effect seems similar to that of interband mixing .",
    "however , they are fundamentally different . in the one - band model , electronic states for a given @xmath14 have _ the same chirality_. thus the drifting direction of an electron will be inverted when it tunnels into neighboring loops .",
    "this means that a strong tunnelling in a one - band model will induce an effective backward - scattering that tends to also localize electrons .",
    "we can understand this by considering a small part of the one - band model as shown in fig.[1channel](a ) where all loops are moving in clockwise direction . without tunnelling ,",
    "the trajectory of an electron starting from point a is @xmath45 , a clockwise closed loop . with strong tunnellings",
    ", the trajectory will tend to be @xmath46 , a counter - clockwise closed loop .",
    "thus , the tunnellings between loops of the same chirality can not delocalize states .",
    "two - channel cc model can also be used to simulate both spin - degenerated and bilayer systems .",
    "the model for spin - degenerate system is the same as we use .",
    "the only difference is that loops for spin - up and spin - down states present at the same positions in real space , and the chiralities of loops of spin - up and spin - down states are the same . while the main difference between the model for bilayer system and ours is that the real space distributions of random potentials in the two layers are different .",
    "it is worthwhile to explain why we consider only those states between two lb centers . for states outside this range",
    ", both sets of loops are localized around either valleys or peaks .",
    "this means that interband mixing mainly occurs between two loops localized around the same position , and this mixing will not delocalize a state .",
    "in fact , as explained in the previous paragraph , the mixing of the same chirality does not help delocalizing an electron .",
    "this is why we shall consider mixing between spatially separated states with opposite chirality .",
    "of course , it does not mean that the mixing of the same chirality has no effect at all . as it was found in some previous works@xcite , this kind of mixing may shift an extended state from its lb center .",
    "level shifting due to mixing between states of the same chirality may distort the shape of the phase diagram , but should not alter its topology .",
    "the emergence of the bands of extended states is exclusively due to the mixing between states of opposite chirality .",
    "now , we describe our two - channel network model in detail .",
    "assume that tunnellings of two neighboring localized states ( loops ) of the same band occur around saddle points , and interband mixing takes place only on the links , fig.[network](a ) is topologically equivalent to the model shown in fig.[network](b ) .",
    "fig.[network](b ) is the schematic illustration of our _ two - channel chalker - coddington _ network model .",
    "it is similar to the model studied in previous publications@xcite .",
    "there are two channels on each link .",
    "one , denoted by a solid line , is from the lower lb around a potential peak .",
    "the other ( dashed line ) is from the upper lb moving around a potential valley .",
    "the arrows indicate the drifting direction of the two sets of states . at each node ,",
    "the tunnelling between two neighboring states of the same lb occurs . as shown in fig.[nodelink](a ) , let @xmath47 and @xmath48 be the incoming wave amplitudes of states 1 and 2 from upper ( lower ) lb , respectively , and @xmath49 and @xmath50 be the outgoing wave amplitudes of the two states .",

    "level - statistics analysis is based on random matrix theory ( rmt)@xcite .",
    "the basic idea is that the localization property of an electronic state can be determined by the statistical distribution function @xmath83 of the spacing @xmath84 of two neighboring levels . for localized states ,",
    "the distribution is poissonian @xmath85 , called ` poissonian ensemble ( pe ) ' . in the case of extended states ,",
    "the nearest neighbor level spacing distribution has the following form@xcite @xmath86\\ ] ] where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are normalization factors determined by @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the parameter @xmath91 is determined by the dynamical symmetry of the system .",
    "the case of @xmath92 is for systems with time - reversal symmetry and an integer total angular momentum and is referred as ` gaussian orthogonal ensemble ' .",
    "systems with time - reversal symmetry and a half - integer total angular momentum belong to the case of @xmath93 , called ` gaussian symplectic ensemble ' . for systems without time - reversal symmetry @xmath94 , and it is called ` gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) ' .",
    "a fundamental difference between level statistics property of extended states and localized states is that @xmath83 at @xmath95 is zero for extended states and one for localized states .",
    "the physical reason of this difference is the so - called ` level repulsion ' of extended states .",
    "two extended states with the same ` bare energy ' will overlap in real space(since they are extended in real space ) and form two new extended states with different energies . while localized states can have the same energy staying in different regions of real space .",
    "this approach is appropriate for the network model of quantum hall systems because localized states in the model are loops at different regions of real space while extended states in the model are formed by quantum percolation of such localized loops .",
    "we shall follow the approach proposed by klesse and metzler@xcite .",
    "a quantum state of a network model can be expressed by a vector whose components are electronic wave - function amplitudes on the links . in our case , the vector can be written as @xmath96 , where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are the electron wave - function amplitudes of the upper band ( _ u _ ) and the lower band ( _ l _ ) on the @xmath99-th link , respectively .",
    "as shown by fertig@xcite , the network model can be described by an _ evolution operator _ @xmath100 , an @xmath9-dependent matrix determined by the scattering properties of nodes and links in the model .",
    "( as an example , the evolution operator of a two - channel network of size @xmath101 with periodic boundaries on both directions is constructed explicitly in the appendix . ) in general , the eigenvalue equation of the evolution operator is @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the eigenstate index of @xmath104 .",
    "the true eigenenergies @xmath105 of the system are those energies at which @xmath106 is an integer multiple of @xmath107 .",
    "it has been shown by klesse and metzler@xcite that the set of _ quasi - energies _",
    "@xmath108 corresponds to the excitation spectrum of the stationary state with energy @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , the statistics property of the set of _ quasi - energies _ @xmath108 at @xmath9 is the same as that of true eigenenergies @xmath105 around @xmath9 , and the localization property of an electronic state with an energy @xmath9 can be obtained by the quasi - energies .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that all the quasi - energies can be used in the analysis so that better statistics can be obtained .",
    "chalker and coddington@xcite showed numerically that an open boundary condition along one direction creates extended edge states along the other direction . in order",
    "to get rid of the edge states , we employ a periodic boundary along both directions in our calculation .",

    "@xmath112 is thus a @xmath113 matrix .",

    "this is a natural explanation of the results .",
    "the only finite - size effect in this explanation is rounding behavior in a region close to the critical point @xmath172 .",
    "this region is normally very narrow because of the sharp drop of the correlation length near @xmath172 .",
    "another possible interpretation is to assume that states are always localized in the whole region except at @xmath172 . in this case",
    ", the localization length equals to the correlation length .",

    "an unambiguous conclusion is to do calculations for large sizes .",
    "however , we can propose a physical picture for the existence of new extended states at @xmath175 in the case of strong interband mixing .",
    "assuming that the intra - band tunnelling at nodes are negligibly weak for states of @xmath175 , we saw already from fig .",
    "[ network](a ) that the maximum interband mixing ( @xmath176 ) delocalizes the state , which is localized at zero interband mixing .",
    "if one views @xmath177 as connection probability of two neighboring loops of opposite chirality , our two - channel model without intra - band tunnellings at nodes is analogous to a bond - percolation problem .",
    "it is well - known that a percolation cluster exists at @xmath178 or @xmath179 for a square lattice@xcite .",
    "therefore , an extended state is formed by strong mixing .",
    "one hopes that the intra - band tunnellings at nodes will only modify the threshold value of the mixing strength .",
    "if this picture is correct , the finite - size effect only affects our efforts to determine the accurate value of @xmath152 yet it does not influence the existence of such a critical point .",
    "it should be noted that all above discussions are based on the single parameter scaling argument .",
    "suppose that the region of extended states in thermodynamic limit is vanishing instead of remaining finite , our above numerical results can also be explained by introducing irrelevant length scales and considering their corrections to scaling , as has been pointed out by pruisken@xcite and huckstein@xcite .",
    "thus both our picture of finite region of extended states and the idea of corrections to scaling are alternative explanations for non - scaling behaviors .",
    "therefore , calculations for larger sizes of system are necessary to make unambiguous conclusion for the width of extended state region in thermodynamic limit . in a recent theoretical study , pruisken et .",
    "al.@xcite have developed a microscopic theory based on nonlinear @xmath180 model to explain the non - scaling behaviors within the assumption of a single critical point .",
    "however , in their consideration of the case of long - range correlated disorder which corresponds to the network model , interband mixing , the physical reason for the existence of finite region of extended states in our picture , is neglected .",

    "increasing mixing , i.e. , increasing disorders or decreasing magnetic field , the extended band in the lowest lb floats up and finally merges with that in the second lowest lb .",

    "this shifting of bands of extended states is similar to the shifting of single extended states at lb centers observed in previous studies @xcite where emerging of extended bands is missing . at strong mixing , a band of extended states exists between neighboring lbs where all states are localized without the mixing .",
    "let us look at the consequences of the above results . for weakly disordered systems in iqhe regime ,",

    ", electronic states between the two adjacent lbs should be from either the upper or the lower bands with the same chirality in this case .",
    "it means that no interband mixing occurs and there is only one extended state in each lb .",
    "this may explain why scaling behaviors were observed for plateau transitions in early experiments on clean samples .",
    "interband mixing occurs when the landau gap is less than the lb bandwidth .",
    "systems of relatively strong disorders in iqhe regime should correspond to this case . as the single extended state at each lb center broadens into a narrow extended band",

    "thus each plateau transition contains two consecutive quantum phase transitions for strongly disordered systems .",
    "the bands of extended states will merge together in strong mixing .",
    "this strong mixing regime corresponds to the case when the landau gap is much smaller than the bandwidth .",
    "since the landau gap is proportional to the magnetic field , the disordered system should always enter the strong mixing regime before it reaches the weak field insulating phase , regardless of how weak the disorders are . in terms of qh plateau transitions ,",

    "combine the linear relationship between @xmath192 $ ] and @xmath191 for fixed @xmath5 with our picture of two critical points @xmath216 , we expect @xmath208=ln[r_{xx}(f_{c1},t)]-(f - f_{c1})/(a_1 t^{z\\nu})\\ ] ] in the qh insulating phase , i.e. , @xmath195 , while @xmath208=ln[r_{xx}(f_{c2},t)]-(f - f_{c2})/(a_2 t^{z\\nu})\\ ] ] in the n=1 iqhe phase , i.e. , @xmath197 , where @xmath217 and @xmath218 are positive constants , and @xmath219 and @xmath24 are critical exponents .",
    "it is clear that both @xmath220 in @xmath195 and @xmath221 in @xmath197 are recovered . while a finite value of @xmath222 in the region @xmath223 is consistent with our prediction of a metallic phase between the two critical points .",
    "scaling behaviors of plateau - plateau transitions are observed in recent experiments@xcite . at a first glance , it seems that these results conflict with both non - scaling experiments and our numerical results . however , there are two important differences between recent scaling experiments and non - scaling experiments .",
    "one is that some scaling experiments @xcite were done deep inside qh plateau , or far from the plateau transition point , while the non - scaling behavior was obtained by using data very close to the transition points . in the non - scaling experiments@xcite",
    ", it is known that data not too close to a transition point follow a scaling law .",
    "the other is that the samples used in all scaling experiments@xcite are clean with very high mobility while non - scaling behavior was observed in relative dirty samples@xcite .",
    "in fact , the mobility in recent scaling experiments is at least one order of magnitude larger than that in early non - scaling experiments .",
    "this means that the scaling and non - scaling experiments correspond to regions of vanishing and relatively strong inter - band mixing , respectively .",
    "thus , there is no real conflict between the recent scaling experiments and those early non - scaling experiments .",
    "since our model is valid only when inter - band mixing is considerable , there is also no real conflict between recent scaling experiments and our numerical results .",
    "two - channel cc model has been used to simulate two degenerated or nearly - degenerated spin - resolved landau subbands with strong interband mixing by wang _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "they found two distinct critical points which were related to mixing - induced repulsion@xcite .",
    "for the nearly - degenerated case , they did not consider the states between the two lb centers .",
    "for the degenerated case , their study could not discern whether the states between the two critical points are extended or localized . according to our results ,",
    "a band of extended states is formed around the degenerated lb center for the degenerated case at strong mixing , while for the nearly - degenerated case electronic states between the two lb centers are delocalized by strong mixing .",
    "thus our results are consistent with their results .",
    "one should also notice that two types of metallic phases have been studied extensively in the qh system .",
    "one is the composite fermion state at the half - filling in the lowest landau level ( ll ) and the other is the stripe state at the half - filled higher lls .",
    "these states are formed by the coulomb interaction effect in the high mobility samples .",
    "they are different from our metallic phase caused by level mixing .",
    "although we have not considered the electron - electron interactions in our study , there is no reason why the delocalization effect of level mixing will be diminished by the coulomb interaction .",
    "of course , the interaction could lead to a level shift , thus it may modify the band width .",
    "in conclusion , we find by numerical calculations within the network model that it is possible that the single extended state at each lb center in the absence of interband mixing may broaden into a narrow band of extended states when the effect of mixing of states of _ opposite chirality _ is taken into account . we also provide a physical picture to show how the mixing of states of _ opposite chirality _ may possibly lead to the existence of extended state bands . based on above results ,",
    "we propose a new phase diagram in which a narrow metallic phase exists between two neighboring iqhe phases and between an iqhe phase and an insulating phase .",
    "this new phase diagram is consistent with non - scaling behaviors observed in recent experiments .",
    "a standard scaling analysis on nonscaling experiment data @xcite supports our results .",
    "however , due to finite - size effects , our numerical results can also be explained based on the assumption of a single critical point .",
    "thus further study on large system size is still needed to conclude whether there are extended state bands in quantum hall systems in thermodynamic limit .",
