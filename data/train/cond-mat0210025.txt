    "assume that at a certain instant of time @xmath17 the driver has decided to correct the car motion and chosen the acceleration @xmath12 ( fig .",
    "as discussed above , the optimal path @xmath18 of the further motion ( @xmath19 ) is too complex for her to compute and to follow it .",
    "so , she regards the path @xmath20 characterized by the constant acceleration as the optimal one .",
    "a certain time interval @xmath21 later , the driver has to correct the car motion again .",
    "this can be done by shifting the current acceleration @xmath22 towards the desired optimal value @xmath23 known to her approximately : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a constant about unity and the random term @xmath26 allows for the uncertainty in the driver evaluation of the optimal acceleration at the current time .",
    "its mean amplitude @xmath27 characterizes physiological properties of drivers and can be considered constant .",
    "thereby , @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is kronecker s delta .",
    "this discrete representation of the car motion correction is converted to a continuous description based on stochastic differential equations .",
    "namely , the above discrete governing equation is reduced to @xmath30 here , @xmath31 is the optimal acceleration specified by the current values of headway , car velocity , and leading car velocity .",
    "the term @xmath32 is white noise of unit amplitude which models the uncertainty in the driver evaluation of the optimal motion .",
    "the acceleration increment @xmath33 caused by the random force @xmath34 acting during the time @xmath21 is actually the random component @xmath35 entering the discrete governing equation",
    ". thus , it follows from the estimate @xmath36 that @xmath37    the time scale @xmath21 of the driver control over the car motion depends on the state @xmath38 .",
    "thus , the stochastic differential equation  ( [ m.3 ] ) contains multiplicative noise .",
    "so its type with respect to the corresponding fokker - planck equation has to be specified .",
    "the adopted driving strategy ( fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ) implies that all the characteristics of correcting the car motion are determined by its state at the `` terminal '' point @xmath39 rather than at the `` initial '' point @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable for eq .",
    "( [ m.3 ] ) to be of klimontovich type or , according to the classification in @xcite , to describe a `` postpoint '' random process .    to complete the model , @xmath31 and @xmath40 have to be specified .",
    "the simple ansatz @xmath41   \\label{f.1}\\ ] ] is well justified , at least , near the stationary state of the car motion , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "it should be noted that similar ideas about @xmath31 and a dependence of @xmath16 on the motion state had been discussed already in ref .",
    "( see also @xcite for a discussion . )    here , @xmath44 is the characteristic time of the velocity variations and the constant @xmath45 .",
    "the limit @xmath46 deserves special attention because it is just the condition that a driver , at first , prefers to eliminate the velocity difference @xmath6 between her car and the car ahead and only then optimizes the headway . in this case",
    "the optimal dynamics of car motion , i.e. , the car dynamics governed by the relation @xmath47 is a pure fading relaxation towards the stationary state .",
    "conversely , the model under consideration predicts complex oscillations in the car motion .",
    "note , that the adopted assumption about the value of the coefficient @xmath48 can be justified by applying to the general principles of the car motion  @xcite .",
    "if the car motion state is far from equilibrium the necessity for correcting the velocity and headway distance is obvious . in this case",
    "it is natural to suppose that the characteristic time interval @xmath21 between sequential attempts to correct the car motion should be comparable to @xmath44 which characterizes the velocity variations , i.e. , @xmath49 . here",
    ", @xmath50 is an additional model parameter . when the car motion comes close to the equilibrium and the inequality @xmath51",
    "is fulfilled the uncertainty @xmath26 in evaluating the optimal acceleration becomes significant . under such conditions",
    "there is no reason for the driver to affect the car motion and she may not correct it at all .",
    "it means that the car motion control is depressed and , correspondingly , the correction time interval @xmath16 grows dramatically inside a domain @xmath52 of the phase plane @xmath53 where the inequality @xmath51 holds .    to compute the function @xmath40",
    ", the boundary of the domain @xmath52 has to be analyzed .",
    "note , that the acceleration itself enters the driver s perception of motion quality : without any reason , a driver prefers not to accelerate at all .",
    "when the car motion control is active the estimate @xmath54 by virtue of eq .",
    "( [ m.3 ] ) can be adopted .",
    "so , the boundary of the domain @xmath52 is specified by @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is a certain coefficient about unity . assuming the variables @xmath3 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 to be independent of one another inside @xmath52 and averaging the latter expression over @xmath52 its boundary @xmath57",
    "can be derived : @xmath58 if @xmath59 the driver activity in correcting the car motion is depressed completely . otherwise , @xmath60 , the driver controls the car motion actively .",

    "[ f2 ] . equation  ( [ m.3 ] ) together with expressions  ( [ m.4 ] ) , ( [ f.5 ] ) , and ( [ f.6 ] ) form the proposed car following model with bounded rational drivers .     of car motion control as function of the car motion quality @xmath63.[f2],width=226 ]",
    "when @xmath64 the stationary motion with @xmath42 and @xmath65 is unstable , leading to non - damped but bounded oscillations in the headway and velocity of the following car .",
    "the particular form of the function @xmath66 is of minor importance , it is only necessary that its value inside @xmath52 to be small in comparison with the ratio @xmath67 . when analyzing the model numerically the following ansatz @xmath68/ ( \\exp[(x-1)/\\delta ] + 1 ) \\ ] ] is used , with the parameter @xmath69 .",
    "below , numerical results will be presented that demonstrate the characteristic properties of the developed model .",
    "figure  [ f3 ] displays an example of this dynamic in the @xmath70-phase plane for the dimensionless headway @xmath71 and the relative car velocity @xmath72 . as seen in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] , the behavior of this model is qualitatively similar to the empirical data in fig .",
    "[ f0 ] .",
    "preliminary results have shown that , first , the quasi - period of these oscillations in the car velocity is equal to @xmath44 times a numerical factor ( about ten ) depending weakly on the model parameters . for @xmath73",
    "s this period is similar to the observed quasi - period .",
    "second , the amplitude of velocity oscillations does not change substantially as the model parameters vary and is about @xmath74 . by visually comparing figs .",
    "[ f0 ] , [ f3 ] the estimate @xmath75  m / s@xmath76 is obtained .",
    "it should be noted that the amplitude of the acceleration oscillations exceeds @xmath77 by a numerical factor about three .",
    "third , the amplitude of the headway super - oscillations , in contrast , depends essentially on the parameter @xmath78 , enabling one to fix this parameter based on experimental data .    , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81.[f3],width=264 ]",
    "a model regarding the bounded rational behavior of car drivers has been supposed in this contribution .",
    "it takes into account that drivers , although having detailed ideas about their preferred driving strategy , are not able to control this driving strategy sufficiently precisely .",
    "namely , drivers introduce three main sources of error into the optimal driving strategy : instead of keeping track of the changes in acceleration they simply choose a constant one , that additionally is not the optimal one but blurred by noise . this noise models the inability of drivers to evaluate exactly the very complex integrations leading to an optimal driving strategy .",
    "therefore , the need to correct the motion from time to time arises , with the correction time intervals distributed randomly but inversely proportional to the deviation from the desired optimal acceleration .",
    "it is shown , that these ideas can be captured in a simple model for the car - following dynamics , however at the cost of introducing a non - newtonian term , the jerk ( change in acceleration ) .",
    "the benefit of doing so is that the resulting model has smooth trajectories in headway , velocity and acceleration but still being a stochastic one .",
    "this discerns the approach proposed here from almost all models of car - following introduced so far .",
    "although the trajectories generated by this model have some similarities with real car - following data , the approach proposed here still needs thorough testing with empirical data .",
    "this will be done in the near future and will be reported soon ."

    "<S> this paper introduces a car following model where the driving scheme takes into account the deficiencies of human decision making in a general way . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , it improves certain shortcomings of most of the models currently in use : it is stochastic but has a continuous acceleration . </S>",
    "<S> this is achieved at the cost of formulating the model in terms of the time derivative of the acceleration , making it non - newtonian .    to understand traffic flow </S>",
    "<S> , it is mandatory to analyze the interaction between the cars . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest case is that of a car following a lead car . to describe this process , </S>",
    "<S> a big number of models have been invented ( for a review see  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> these models differ in the details of the interaction between the cars , and the time update rule , ranging from differential equations to cellular automata . </S>",
    "<S> mostly , they describe this process by an equation @xmath0 that relates the change in the current velocity @xmath1 ( the acceleration @xmath2 ) to the velocity @xmath1 of the following car , the distance @xmath3 ( `` headway '' ) to the car ahead , and its speed @xmath4 , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> considerable effort has been invested to investigate the emerging macroscopic behavior from the underlying microscopic dynamics of interacting cars . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , there is still a lot of controversy in both the macroscopic behavior when compared to reality @xcite , and in the microscopic foundations of the individual car dynamics . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> the observed non - damped oscillations in the relative motion of vehicles , which are illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f0 ] are often explained by the instability in the cooperative motion of the car ensemble only ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , subjected to reasonable physical constraints the relation @xmath5 seems to be hardly able to predict an instability in the following car motion provided the car ahead moves at a constant velocity . </S>",
    "<S> however , recent models @xcite display a certain kind of instability in the car following process itself .    </S>",
    "<S> there are actually two stimuli affecting the driver behavior . </S>",
    "<S> one of them is the necessity to move at the mean speed of traffic flow , i.e. , with the speed @xmath4 of the leading car . </S>",
    "<S> so , first , the driver should control the velocity difference @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the other is the necessity to maintain a safe headway @xmath7 depending on the velocity @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the earliest `` follow - the - leader '' models @xcite take into account the former stimulus only without regarding the headway @xmath3 at all . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , the `` optimal velocity '' model @xcite directly relates the acceleration @xmath2 to the difference between the current velocity @xmath1 and a certain optimal value @xmath8 at the current headway , @xmath9 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> of course , more sophisticated approximations , e.g. , @xcite to name but a few , allow for both stimuli .     and speed @xmath1 and computing @xmath10 during a drive on a german freeway . </S>",
    "<S> [ f0],width=264 ]    it is not very likely that the variables @xmath11 do specify the acceleration @xmath2 completely . since drivers have motivations and follow only partly physical regularities , memory effects may be essential . in a simple manner , </S>",
    "<S> this has been introduced in models that relate the current acceleration @xmath12 to the velocity @xmath13 and the headway @xmath14 at a previous moment @xmath15 ( for a review of the `` following - the - leader '' models see , e.g. , ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , for the `` optimal velocity model '' see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . here , @xmath16 is the delay time in the driver response which is treated as a constant . </S>",
    "<S> this approach is not completely satisfactorily , since first , the physiological delay in the driver response seems to be too short to be of importance . </S>",
    "<S> second , it is not clear why the memory effects relate only two moments of time instead of a certain interval as a whole . </S>",
    "<S> third , the dependence of the time scale @xmath16 on the car motion state is missing . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , these models show an instability in the car - following dynamics ( provided @xmath16 is big enough ) and are non - newtonian as well .    in the following , reasons of another nature than the driver response delay lead beyond the framework of newton s mechanics . a corresponding model for the following car dynamics displaying an instability around the stationary motion </S>",
    "<S> is proposed . to describe the driver behavior , </S>",
    "<S> the approach suggested in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite will be used . </S>",
    "<S> there , drivers plan their behavior for a certain time in advance instead of simply reacting to the surrounding situation . </S>",
    "<S> a similar idea related to the optimum design of a distance controlling driver assistance system is discussed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . in mathematical terms </S>",
    "<S> the driver s planning of her further motion is reduced to finding extremals of a certain priority functional that ranks outcomes of different driving strategies . here , </S>",
    "<S> the assumption that the driver is rational plays the crucial role . </S>",
    "<S> it means that the driver continuously correct the car motion to follow the optimal strategy . in this case </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the collection of variables @xmath11 does specify the car acceleration @xmath2 completely . </S>",
    "<S> however , the assumed continuous control is impossible to achieve for humans . therefore , it is assumed below that a real driver , first , can not compute the optimal path of motion exactly and , second , that she can not correct the car motion continuously .    this is just the approach that is known as bounded rationality @xcite . even if a driver succeeds in finding the optimal solution , she is only capable of setting the acceleration to a fixed value . </S>",
    "<S> after that , she waits until the deviation from her priority functional has become too big to ignore , leading to a re - computation of another more or less optimal path . or , to put it differently , drivers are simply not capable of resolving small differences between a given value of acceleration , speed , or headway and their `` optimal '' desired values .    </S>",
    "<S> the re - computations are assumed to happen stochastically , with a probability that increases with the deviation from the desired state . </S>",
    "<S> so , the model described below becomes a stochastic one . </S>",
    "<S> the action of noise can be modeled either explicitly by introducing certain thresholds ( as is done in the psycho - physical models  @xcite ) or by making the noise amplitude dependent on the distance between the current and optimal state . </S>",
    "<S> this defines a dynamic trap model @xcite , an approach that will be followed below .    to make the model more realistic </S>",
    "<S> , it is demanded that the trajectories of acceleration , speed , and headway are continuous functions of time . </S>",
    "<S> this can be achieved by formulating the model in terms of the time - derivative of acceleration called jerk and adding a white - noise term there . in </S>",
    "<S> what follows , that the acceleration is a colorized noise process without jumps , and so are the other integrals of motion ( speed and headway , respectively ) .    </S>",
