    "in an ordinary two - dimensional percolation model , the sites or bonds of a lattice are usually distributed uniformly , whether the lattice is square , triangular , diamond , or in other forms  @xcite . however , in nature , the non - uniform distribution may be more popular than the uniform one .",
    "for example , electron density is used to describe the non - uniform spatial distribution of an electron in materials  @xcite , cancer cells begins in some tissues or organs of the body , but not the whole body . in view of the wide influence of percolation theory  @xcite ,",
    "it is essential to study the nonuniform percolation models and their percolation properties .    in the past decades ,",
    "an important development towards nonuniform percolation is the study on the correlated percolation , examples of which are bootstrap percolation  @xcite , jamming percolation  @xcite , and directed percolation  @xcite etc .",
    "our model is certainly some kind of correlated percolation model .",
    "however , our model originates from a completely different idea . in our model",
    ", clusters start to grow from a number of preoccupied sites .",
    "our model is at first a cluster growth model .",
    "except one special case , the model displays similar properties as the ordinary non - restricted percolation model .",
    "the only difference is the specific values of percolation thresholds .",
    "the critical properties of the model are obtained in the same way that already used in an ordinary percolation model .    for the convenience ,",
    "we summarize the formulae here , detailed description of the method can be found elsewhere  @xcite",
    ". an interesting quantity of a percolation model is the correlation length defined as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the average number of @xmath2-clusters per lattice site , @xmath3 is the average squared distance between two cluster sites .",
    "it is expected to behave as @xmath4 given the value of @xmath5 , one can get the exponent @xmath6 by fitting the values of @xmath7 around @xmath5 . however , this method may give rise to large uncertainties of @xmath6 , since the exponent @xmath6 is sensitive to the data points around @xmath5 . on the other hand ,",
    "the fitted value of @xmath6 for @xmath8 may be different from that for @xmath9 . to circumvent these uncertainties",
    ", one can choose other methods instead .",
    "an effective recipe is to introduce the probability @xmath10 , which is the probability that a lattice of linear dimension @xmath11 percolates at concentration @xmath12 . in an infinite system ,",
    "@xmath13 above and @xmath14 below @xmath5 . as for percolation transitions ,",
    "only the value of @xmath5 is not enough , we have to introduce a number of other observables . on a square lattice with periodic boundary conditions ,",
    "the quantity @xmath15 gives the probability per interval @xmath16 at concentration @xmath12 , that a wrapping cluster appears for the first time .",
    "the average concentration @xmath17 , at which , a wrapping cluster appears for the first time is defined as @xmath18 if we define the width @xmath19 of the transition region as @xmath20 then @xmath19 can be related to @xmath17 via @xmath21 in this way , one can first get the value of @xmath5 by fitting the observed thresholds @xmath17 and the observed widths @xmath19 , without prior knowledge of the correlation length exponent @xmath6 . with the value of @xmath5 at hand ,",
    "one can further obtain the value of @xmath6 through @xmath22 if an observable @xmath23 is predicted to scale as @xmath24 in an infinite lattice , then we expect it to obey the general scaling law @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a scale - independent function .",
    "other two interesting observables are the order parameter , @xmath27 , the probability of an occupied site belongs to the infinite cluster , and the average cluster size , @xmath28 . at @xmath29 , they behave respectively as @xmath30 @xmath31 here , the value of @xmath27 ( or @xmath28 ) at @xmath29 is estimated by linear interpolation between two values of @xmath27 ( or @xmath28 ) right above and below @xmath5 .",
    "the exponents for two - dimensional lattice are expected to obey the well - known scaling law @xmath32 these exponents will be calculated in our model .",
    "our model can be easily built up by first occupying a number of sites randomly chosen from a two - dimensional square lattice with @xmath33 sites , then one by one , occupy the empty sites being neighbour to the previous occupied sites . after occupying a qualified empty site ( being neighbour to at least one of the previous occupied sites ) , the list of qualified empty sites is refreshed by adding the new empty sites being neighbour to the site that was occupied just now .",
    "groups of neighbour sites form clusters .",
    "thus clusters grow from the multiple seeds , the sites occupied at the very beginning .",
    "since the later occupied sites in our model are surrounding the previously occupied sites , there could be some differences between our model and other models .",
    "we use @xmath34 to denote the concentration of seeds . for the eden model  @xcite , @xmath35 , which approaches zero with increasing @xmath11 .",
    "when @xmath36 , with @xmath37 the percolation threshold of the usual two - dimensional site percolation  @xcite , the critical region of percolation transition will be covered by the occupying process of the sites chosen as seeds , the following cluster growth process is therefore less meaningful . especially , @xmath38 is the usual percolation model .",
    "so , it is of interest only in the region with @xmath39 .",
    "we have calculated the thresholds @xmath17 for many sets of @xmath34 and @xmath11 . for moderate value of @xmath34 , the values of @xmath17 decrease with decreasing @xmath11 as what could be found in a general percolation model .",
    "however , an abnormal phenomenon could be observed for small values of @xmath34 .",
    "the values of @xmath17 first decrease with decreasing @xmath11 , after passing some critical lattice dimension @xmath40 , the @xmath17 values increase abnormally with decreasing @xmath11 .",
    "obviously , the scaling behaviours of @xmath17 above and below @xmath40 are different . to get any convergent observable of an infinite system",
    ", one has to choose lattices with @xmath11 greater than the critical lattice dimension @xmath40 . if @xmath40 is too large to meet the requirement of a computer memory , then no critical information of an infinite system can be obtained .",
    "the abnormal change of @xmath17 happens at @xmath41 for @xmath42 respectively . as an example , the circumstance of @xmath43 is shown in fig .",
    "[ f0 ] .    the average threshold @xmath17 for @xmath43 changes with the linear dimension @xmath11",
    ". the abnormal change of @xmath17 happens at @xmath44 for the selected data points.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    simple calculation gives @xmath45 .",
    "clearly , @xmath46 when @xmath47 .",
    "the eden model @xmath48 is purely a cluster growth model , which is inappropriate to be regarded as a percolation model . along another trend of changing @xmath34",
    ", there should be a critical value of @xmath34 , only below which , the abnormal scaling behaviour of @xmath17 happens .",
    "this value of @xmath34 for a finite lattice could be figured out by changing the number of seeds one by one .",
    "this is clearly not a easy work . our model , except the case @xmath49 , is some kind of constrained percolation model .",
    "on a lattice with @xmath50 sites , there are @xmath51 seeds , from which clusters start to grow until the lattice is fully occupied in each run or configuration .",
    "relative to other observables , the computation of @xmath52 needs rather longer cpu time .",
    "given one value of @xmath34 on the lattice with @xmath53 , a common desktop pc with cpu clock speed 2.6 ghz should keep running for about 14 hours to output the values of @xmath7 averaged on @xmath54 runs , and the corresponding @xmath12-dependence of @xmath7 for @xmath55 and @xmath56 is shown in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] .",
    "the peak value of @xmath52 is insensitive to the value of @xmath34 as it should be .",
    "this peak value is larger than that in the free - boundary lattice with the same @xmath11 , because touching - boundary clusters could become bigger by including the sites across the periodic boundaries , and a spanning cluster not counted in calculating @xmath52 should be summed if it does not form a wrapping cluster when the free - boundary condition is switched to the periodic - boundary condition  @xcite .",
    "it is worth of noting that , the peak value of @xmath52 appears in different point , one is around 0.54 , the other is around 0.58 , which implies that percolation thresholds for models with different concentration of seeds are different .    for each set of parameters @xmath11 and @xmath34 ,",
    "we have calculated @xmath17 , @xmath19 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "the number of runs is in the range of @xmath57 to @xmath58 , and the corresponding computation time is 1316.5 hours . in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , at the concentration of seeds @xmath59 , the average threshold @xmath17 versus the width of transition region @xmath19 is given for @xmath11=512 , 256 , and 128 , respectively .",
    "linear fitting gives the percolation threshold for an infinite system @xmath60 for the given @xmath34 .",
    "the datum for @xmath11=64 is not adopted in linear fitting since it is close to the critical lattice dimension 32 for @xmath59 . for @xmath55",
    ", we also choose the data with @xmath11=512 , 256 , and 128 , to do linear fitting . for @xmath61 , we choose the data with @xmath11=64 , 128 , and 256 in linear fitting , while choosing the data with @xmath11= 256 , 512 , and 640 , for @xmath43 . in the same way , the @xmath5 values for other @xmath34 values ( @xmath34=0.5 , 0.4 , 0.3 , 0.2 , 0.05 ) are obtained and summarized in fig .",
    "obviously , the @xmath5 values decrease with decreasing @xmath34 values . in other words ,",
    "if the number of seeds for cluster growing is smaller , the percolation phase transition will happen earlier .",
    "this result seems a little bit strange but is understandable . in our model ,",
    "the following occupied sites are gathered to the clusters centered with these seeds occupied at the very beginning .",
    "given more seeds , which means there are more clusters growing from these seeds to randomly distribute all the occupied sites , thus the largest cluster in this case will be smaller , and the wrapping cluster will be certainly delayed to appear .",
    "data fitting gives @xmath62 , with @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 .",
    "the minimum @xmath66 in the limit @xmath67 is unreachable since it is not a percolation model in this case .",
    "the average threshold @xmath17 versus the transition width @xmath19 .",
    "the concentration of seeds is @xmath59 , and the data points are respectively for @xmath11=128 , 256 , and 512.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the dependence of the percolation thresholds @xmath5 on the concentration of seeds @xmath34.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    as an example , the exponent @xmath68 for @xmath59 is extracted as shown in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] . according to their respective scaling relations ,",
    "the values of @xmath69 and @xmath70 for @xmath59 can be obtained in a similar way .     the slope from the linear fitting of @xmath71 versus @xmath72 gives the reciprocal of @xmath6 .",
    "here , @xmath73 for the model @xmath59.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    finally , the values of exponents @xmath6 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 for our selected concentration of seeds from 0.05 to 0.5 are summarized in table  [ exps ] .",
    "it can be seen that , there are minor differences in the values of each exponential for different @xmath34 values , the values of exponents are in fact invariant , and they are respectively close to the corresponding values of exponents in an ordinary two - dimensional site percolation model .",
    "the ratio between exponents @xmath74 is therefore a constant , and it obeys the scaling law eq .",
    "( [ scalinglaw ] ) as it does in an usual site percolation model .",
    ".the values of exponents @xmath6 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and rate @xmath74 under different concentration of seeds @xmath34 . [ cols=\">,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "given a number of seeds ( except only one seed ) on any lattice , percolation phase transition will inevitably happen while clusters centered with these seeds grow up .",
    "except the universal scaling law and various scaling exponents , the percolation threshold is variable with non - uniform distribution of sites characterized by the concentration of seeds .",
    "percolation properties of a lattice depend on the non - uniform distribution of sites or bonds centered with multiple seeds , as well as its structures .",
    "any details ( uniform or non - uniform structures ) of geometrical distribution of sites or bonds may contribute to the geometrical phase transition of a lattice .",
    "in general , smaller number of seeds for clusters growing implies the earlier occurrence of percolation transition .",
    "it is expected that there exists a critical value of the concentration of seeds , only below which , the abnormal finite - size scaling behaviours could happen .",
    "the idea of multiple seeds can be extended to other correlated percolation models .",
    "this work make it possible to push the application of percolation theory to wider fields , where percolation thresholds are expected to vary with non - uniform population of sites or bonds while scaling exponents keep invariant .    upon finishing this work",
    ", we became aware of a similar cluster model with initial seed concentration @xmath75 and an additional parameter called growth probability @xmath76 reported by roy and santra recently  @xcite .",
    "however , our model ( corresponding to their @xmath77 ) has not been discussed there . except the difference in the model itself , the results of their model , including the values of percolation thresholds around 0.593 for the selected seed concentration 0.05 , 0.25 , and 0.50 , and all the exponents are nearly the same for an ordinary percolation model .",
