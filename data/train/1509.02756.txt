    "in @xcite lewowicz and hiraide proved that every expansive homeomorphism of a compact surface @xmath0 is conjugate with a pseudo - anosov diffeomorphism . recall that a homeomorphism @xmath1 is _ expansive _ if there is @xmath2 such that if @xmath3 for all @xmath4 then @xmath5 . in",
    "@xcite kato introduced a generalization of expansivity called _ continuum - wise expansivity_. we say that @xmath6 is _ cw - expansive _ if there is @xmath2 such that if @xmath7 is a continuum ( compact connected ) and @xmath8 for all @xmath4 then @xmath9 is a singleton . in the works of kato on cw - expansivity we find several generalizations of results holding for expansive homeomorphisms .",
    "also , he found new phenomena as for example a cw - expansive homeomorphism with infinite topological entropy . in this paper",
    "we investigate the possibility of extending results from @xcite for a cw - expansive surface homeomorphism .",
    "a key concept in dynamical systems is that of the stable set of a point . given a homeomorphism @xmath1 and @xmath10 we define the @xmath11-_stable set _ of a point @xmath12 as @xmath13 for a hyperbolic set it is well known that local stable sets are embedded submanifolds ( the invariant manifold theorem ) . in the papers",
    "@xcite they prove that if @xmath1 is expansive then the connected component of @xmath14 in @xmath15 is a locally connected set .",
    "this implies the arc - connection of this components and allows them to prove that each local stable set is a finite union of arcs . in some sense",
    "it is an invariant manifold theorem for expansive homeomorphisms of surfaces .",
    "after this , they prove the conjugacy with a pseudo - anosov diffeomorphism , giving a complete classification of such dynamics .",
    "some cw - expansive homeomorphisms of surfaces are not expansive , see @xcite . in these examples",
    "the components of local stable sets are locally connected .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to construct a cw - expansive homeomorphism of a compact surface with a point whose local stable set is connected but it is not locally connected .",
    "the example is a variation of those in @xcite .",
    "we start defining a homeomorphism of @xmath16 such @xmath17 as a fixed point and its stable set is not locally connected .",
    "then , this anomalous saddle is _ inserted _ in a derived from anosov diffeomorphism of the torus .",
    "finally , this anomalous derived from anosov system is connected via a wandering tube with a usual derived from anosov to obtain our example .",
    "first , we will construct a plane homeomorphism @xmath6 with a fixed point at the origin whose local stable set is connected but not locally connected .",
    "the homeomorphism will be defined as the composition of a piece - wise linear transformation @xmath18 and a time - one map of a flow @xmath19 .",
    "this flow will have a non - locally connected set @xmath20 of fixed points .",
    "we start with the linear part of the construction .",
    "let @xmath21 , for @xmath22 , be the linear transformations defined by @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "define the piece - wise linear transformation @xmath27 as @xmath28 in figure [ sillaloca ] we illustrate the definition of @xmath18 .",
    "now we define the non - locally connected plane continuum @xmath20 .",
    "some care is needed in order to be able of relate this set with the transformation @xmath18 .",
    "define the sets : @xmath29 also consider the non - locally connected continuum @xmath30\\times\\{0\\})$ ] shown in figure [ conjuntoe ] .",
    "now we will define a flow related with the set @xmath20 .",
    "consider the continuous function @xmath31 defined by @xmath32 and the vertical vector field @xmath33 defined as @xmath34 since @xmath35 for all @xmath36 , we have that @xmath37 is lipschitz .",
    "therefore , by picard s theorem , @xmath38 has unique solutions and we can consider the flow @xmath39 induced by @xmath38 . since @xmath40 for all @xmath41 we have that every solution is defined for all @xmath42 .",
    "consider @xmath52 such that @xmath51 .",
    "since @xmath38 is a vertical vector field we have that @xmath57}(p)\\subset r_1 $ ] . for @xmath58 , if @xmath59 then @xmath60 therefore , @xmath61 for @xmath58 and consequently for @xmath62 .",
    "now take a point @xmath70\\times[0,1]$ ] . for @xmath71 , the set defined in ( [ eqr1 ] ) , it is easy to see that @xmath72 as @xmath73 .",
    "assume that @xmath74 .",
    "we will show that @xmath75 .",
    "it is sufficient to show that for some @xmath76 the point @xmath77 is not in @xmath78 . by contradiction , assume that @xmath79 for all @xmath80 .",
    "then , by lemma [ lemar1 ] we know that @xmath81 notice that @xmath82 . then , it only rests to prove that @xmath83 for some @xmath76 .",
    "but this is easy because the velocity of @xmath84 is @xmath85 and this velocity increases with @xmath86 .",
    "we start recalling some properties of what is known as a derived from anosov diffeomorphisms .",
    "the interested reader should consult @xcite*section 8.8 for a construction of such a map and detailed proofs of its properties .",
    "a derived from anosov is a @xmath87 diffeomorphism @xmath88 of the two - dimensional torus such that : it satisfies smale s axiom a and its non - wandering set consists of an expanding attractor and a repeller fixed point @xmath89 .",
    "the expanding attractor is locally a cantor set times an arc , and it has two hyperbolic fixed points of saddle type @xmath90 and @xmath91 as in figure [ figda ] .",
    "now we will _ insert _ the anomalous saddle in the derived from anosov .",
    "let @xmath90 be the hyperbolic fixed point shown in figure [ figda ] .",
    "consider a topological rectangle @xmath100 covering a half - neighborhood of @xmath90 as in figure [ figdarect ] .",
    "consider the homeomorphism with an anomalous saddle fixed point defined in section [ secirregular ] . call this homeomorphism @xmath101 ( to avoid confusion with the derived from anosov @xmath6 ) .",
    "denote by @xmath102 its fixed point ( the origin of @xmath16 ) and take a rectangle @xmath103 , similar to @xmath104 , as in figure [ figdarect ] .",
    "now we can _ replace _ @xmath100 with @xmath105 and define what we call a _ derived from anosov with an anomalous saddle _ as in figure [ figanoda ] .        in this section",
    "we finish the construction with ideas from @xcite .",
    "consider @xmath106 and @xmath107 two disjoint copies of the torus @xmath108 .",
    "let @xmath109 , @xmath110 , be two homeomorphisms such that :    * @xmath111 is the derived from anosov with an anomalous saddle from the previous section , denote by @xmath112 the source fixed point of @xmath111 , * @xmath113 is the inverse of the derived from anosov ( the usual one ) with a sink fixed point at @xmath114 .",
    "consider the open disk @xmath121 and the compact annulus @xmath122 define @xmath123 as the inversion @xmath124 .",
    "the pull - back of the unstable foliation on @xmath107 by @xmath125 on the annulus @xmath126 is shown in figure [ figfols ] .",
    "on the disjoint union @xmath127\\cup [ s_2\\setminus \\varphi_2(d_{1/2})]$ ] consider the equivalence relation generated by @xmath128 for all @xmath129 .",
    "denote by @xmath130 $ ] the equivalence class of @xmath14 .",
    "the surface @xmath131 is the genus two surface if equipped with the quotient topology .",
    "consider the homeomorphism @xmath1 defined by @xmath132)=\\left\\ { \\begin{array}{ll } \\left[f_1(x)\\right ] & \\hbox { if } x\\in s_1 \\setminus \\varphi_1(d_{1/2})\\\\ \\left[f_2(x)\\right ] & \\hbox { if } x\\in s_2 \\setminus \\varphi_2(d_2)\\\\ \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ]          define @xmath135 $ ] the annulus on @xmath0 corresponding to @xmath126 .",
    "we will perturb the homeomorphism @xmath6 defined above on the annulus @xmath136 .",
    "first note that the non - wandering set of @xmath6 is expansive and dynamically isolated , i.e. there is a neighborhood @xmath137 of the non - wandering set @xmath138 such that if @xmath139 for all @xmath4 then @xmath140 .",
    "also note that for every wandering point @xmath12 there is @xmath4 such that @xmath141 .",
    "therefore , it is sufficient to prove that there is a homeomorphism @xmath142 such that @xmath143 and there is @xmath144 such that for each @xmath145 the intersection @xmath134 is totally disconnected . in figure [ figfols ] we have the picture of the unstable foliation on @xmath136 ( or in local charts ) .",
    "the problem is that the stable sets do not make a foliation , this is because there is an anomalous saddle .",
    "then , it is convenient to consider the stable partition , i.e. , the partition defined by the equivalence relation of being positively asymptotic .",
    "this partition is illustrated in figure [ figstpart ] .",
    "we know that the unstable leaves are circle arcs , as in figure [ figfols ] .",
    "therefore , it is sufficient to consider a @xmath146 perturbation @xmath101 of @xmath6 supported on @xmath136 , such that the stable partition of @xmath101 in the annulus contains no circle arc , in local charts . see comments below . by the previous comments this implies that @xmath101 is cw - expansive . since @xmath101 coincides with @xmath6 outside @xmath136 , we have that @xmath101 has an anomalous saddle with non - locally connected stable set .",
    "this finishes the proof .",
    "the example has further properties that we wish to remark .",
    "given @xmath147 we say that @xmath6 is @xmath148-_expansive _",
    "@xcite if there is @xmath2 such that @xmath149 for all @xmath12 , where @xmath150 stands for the cardinality of the set @xmath126 .",
    "we have that the example of the previous proof is not @xmath148-expansive for all @xmath147 because there are point with @xmath151 for arbitrarilly small values of @xmath152 .",
    "we say that a probability measure @xmath153 on @xmath0 is an _ expansive measure _",
    "@xcite if there is @xmath2 such that @xmath154 for all @xmath12 .",
    "obviously , if @xmath153 is an expansive measure then @xmath155 for all @xmath12 , i.e @xmath153 is non - atomic . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that every non - atomic probability measure is expansive if and only if there is @xmath2 such that @xmath156 for all @xmath12 .",
    "this property is called _ countable - expansivity _ and our example satisfies this condition .    in the generalized pseudo - anosov shown in @xcite",
    "there is a finite number of _ spines _ ( or 1-_prongs _ ) , i.e. points whose local stable sets do not separate arbitrarilly small neighborhoods .",
    "this is a cw - expansive homeomorphism on the two - sphere .",
    "our example has a countable set of spines , namely , the points in the set @xmath20 of figure [ conjuntoe ] in the line @xmath157 give rise to spines in the example .",
    "as explained in @xcite the generalized pseudo - anosov of the two - sphere has points with its local stable set non - locally connected .",
    "but the components are arcs .",
    "our example has connected components not being locally connected .",
    "it seems to be the case that if we start with a set like the graph of @xmath158 , in place of the set @xmath20 , we can obtain an anomalous saddle with no arc - connected stable set .",
    "notice that the set @xmath20 is arc - connected ."
