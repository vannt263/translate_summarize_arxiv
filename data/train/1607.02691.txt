    "hadronic matter affects production of particles in relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "change of @xmath11 in hadronic matter is appreciable .",
    "the change of @xmath11 number is caused by inelastic meson - charmonium scattering @xcite and spontaneous dissociation that may happen when temperature is higher than the @xmath11 dissociation temperature @xcite .",
    "studies of charmonium dissociation in collisions with hadrons are important in the field of relativistic heavy - ion collisions . since the @xmath0-meson production is enhanced in au - au collisions at relativistic heavy ion collider energies , it is interesting to investigate @xmath0-charmonium dissociation in hadronic matter .",
    "this is the subject of this paper .",
    "we calculate @xmath0-charmonium dissociation cross sections in the born approximation and in the quark - interchange mechanism @xcite . the quark interchange mechanism between the incident meson and the charmonium breaks the charmonium and produces charmed mesons and/or charmed strange mesons .",
    "dissociation of charmonia in collisions with @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 in vacuum has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite and dissociation in hadronic matter in refs .",
    "meson - charmonium dissociation cross sections in hadronic matter differ from those in vacuum .",
    "the in - vacuum cross sections obtained in the quark - interchange approach are different from the cross sections obtained in the meson - exchange approach @xcite and in the short - distance approach @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-charmonium dissociation cross sections have not been calculated in the quark - interchange approach , in the meson - exchange approach and in the short - distance approach .    with the @xmath0-charmonium dissociation",
    "cross sections we calculate the dissociation rate of the charmonium in the interaction with the @xmath0 meson in hadronic matter .",
    "the larger the dissociation rate is , the stronger charmonium suppression @xmath0 mesons cause . from the dissociation rate we can understand contribution of the @xmath0 meson to the charmonium suppression . therefore , the second task of the paper is to calculate the dissociation rate .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii formulas for the dissociation cross section and the dissociation rate are presented . in section",
    "iii we show numerical results of unpolarised @xmath0-charmonium dissociation cross sections and charmonium dissociation rates .",
    "relevant discussions are given .",
    "a summary is in section iv .",
    "the scattering @xmath15 takes place due to quark interchange and interactions among constituents ( quarks and antiquarks ) .",
    "the scattering has the two forms , the prior form and the post form .",
    "the scattering in the prior form means that gluon exchange occurs before quark interchange .",
    "the scattering in the post form contains gluon exchange after quark interchange .",
    "the scattering in the two forms is depicted in figs . 1 and 2 in ref .",
    "cross - section formulas for the scattering are given in refs .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we briefly introduce the formulas .",
    "application of the cross section to get the charmonium dissociation rate follows .",
    "denote the spin , orbital angular momentum and four - momentum of meson @xmath16 ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) by @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "the mandelstam variables are @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "let @xmath26 and @xmath27 be the momenta of mesons @xmath28 and @xmath29 in the center - of - mass frame of @xmath28 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "the unpolarised cross section for the scattering in the prior form is @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the transition amplitude for the scattering in the prior form , @xmath33 is the total spin of mesons @xmath28 and @xmath30 , @xmath34 is the magnetic projection quantum number of @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the angle between @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the unpolarised cross section for the scattering in the post form is @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the transition amplitude for the scattering in the post form .",
    "the unpolarised cross section for @xmath15 is @xmath39    let @xmath40 ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 ) stand for the product of colour , spin , flavour and relative - motion wave functions of @xmath44 ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) and @xmath45 the interaction between constituents @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the transition amplitudes are given by latexmath:[\\ ] ] where @xmath74 gev and @xmath75 .",
    "the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vss ] ) arises from the perturbative one- and two - loop corrections to the gluon propagator .    by solving the schrdinger equation with the central spin - independent potential plus the spin - spin interaction , meson masses and quark - antiquark relative - motion wave functions",
    "are obtained . in solving the schrdinger equation the masses of the charm quark ,",
    "the up quark and the strange quark are 1.51 gev , 0.32 gev and 0.5 gev , respectively .",
    "the experimental masses of @xmath0 , @xmath11 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 mesons @xcite and the experimental data of @xmath33-wave @xmath80 2 elastic phase shifts for @xmath81 scattering in vacuum @xcite are reproduced with @xmath82 at @xmath83 0 and the quark - antiquark relative - motion wave functions .    while @xmath82 and the quark - antiquark relative - motion wave functions obtained from the schrdinger equation with the potential are used to calculate @xmath84 and @xmath85 , we get @xmath86 .",
    "this is exactly what is concluded in ref .",
    "@xcite from a general argument .    with the unpolarised cross sections for charmonium dissociation we calculate the dissociation rate of charmonium in the interaction with @xmath0 meson in hadronic matter , @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the @xmath0 number density , @xmath89 is the relative velocity of the @xmath0 meson and the charmonium , @xmath36 is the angle between the @xmath0 momentum @xmath90 and the charmonium momentum and @xmath91 is the bose - einstein distribution that @xmath0 mesons obey .",
    "the thermal average of @xmath92 is indicated by @xmath93 @xcite .",
    "when a @xmath0 meson collides with one of @xmath11 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath3 or @xmath96 is produced .",
    "since the cross section for the production of @xmath95 equals the cross section for the production of @xmath3 , they are shown in the same figure . in figs .",
    "[ fig : pjdsds]-[fig : pcdsadsa ] we plot cross sections for the following dissociation reactions : @xmath1 , @xmath2 or @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 or @xmath3 , @xmath7 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 or @xmath3 and @xmath99 .",
    "each curve in a figure corresponds to one of the six temperatures , 0 , 0.65@xmath100 , 0.75@xmath100 , 0.85@xmath100 , 0.9@xmath100 and 0.95@xmath100 .",
    "cross sections for @xmath101 depend on masses of mesons @xmath28 , @xmath30 , @xmath29 and @xmath102 .",
    "when temperature approaches the critical temperature @xmath100 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 become degenerate in mass .",
    "the sum of the @xmath105 and @xmath106 masses almost equals the sum of the @xmath107 and @xmath106 masses or the sum of the @xmath107 and @xmath108 masses at @xmath109 = 0.95@xmath100 .",
    "however , the cross sections for @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath4 are still different as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : pjdsds]-[fig : pjdsadsa ] .",
    "this is because the spin matrix elements involved in the transition amplitude are different for the three reactions .",
    "the two reactions @xmath2 and @xmath4 are endothermic at @xmath110 0.75 , 0.85 and 0.9 .",
    "the sum of the @xmath107 and @xmath106 masses is smaller than the sum of the @xmath107 and @xmath108 masses .",
    "the square root of the mandelstam variable @xmath111 corresponding to the peak cross section of @xmath2 is smaller than @xmath112 corresponding to the peak cross section of @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath0 momentum @xmath26 of @xmath113 at @xmath111 has magnitude smaller than the one of @xmath4 at @xmath112 .",
    "accordingly , the factor @xmath114 in eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are larger for @xmath2 than for @xmath115 . on the other hand , the relative momentum @xmath116 of constituents @xmath46 and @xmath47 due to small @xmath117 in @xmath2 has magnitude smaller than that in @xmath4 .",
    "the mesonic quark - antiquark relative - motion wave function @xmath118 in the transition amplitude for @xmath2 is larger than the wave function for @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , the peak cross section of @xmath2 is larger than the peak cross section of @xmath4 at @xmath110 0.75 , 0.85 and 0.9 as seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : pjdsads ] and [ fig : pjdsadsa ] .",
    "the reactions @xmath5 and @xmath97 are exothermic below @xmath100 . the reactions @xmath1 , @xmath6 and @xmath98 are exothermic below 0.95@xmath100",
    ". the threshold energy of every exothermic reaction is @xmath119 where @xmath120 and @xmath121 are the @xmath0 mass and the charmoinum mass , respectively .",
    "we start calculating cross sections for exothermic reactions at @xmath122 gev and the cross sections at the energies correspond to the curve tops .",
    "exothermic reactions take place as long as the two initial mesons overlap and even though the two initial mesons are at rest .",
    "however , the sizes of the initial and final mesons affect cross sections . in @xmath1 the sizes of @xmath11 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 mesons at @xmath110 0 , 0.65 and 0.75 are so small that influence of confinement is small at such sizes .",
    "increase of the @xmath11 size with increasing temperature causes the cross section at @xmath123 gev to increase . from @xmath110 0.75 to 0.9 the @xmath105 ( @xmath106 ) size increases quickly and confinement becomes important . since the plateau of @xmath124 at large distances lowers with increasing temperature , confinement of the quark and the antiquark to form @xmath105 and @xmath106 mesons becomes weaker and weaker and at @xmath123 gev the cross section thus decreases . in the @xmath125 and @xmath126 reactions the sizes of @xmath0 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 mesons",
    "are not small and the influence of confinement on combining a quark and an antiquark to form a @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 or @xmath108 meson is appreciable at such sizes .",
    "weakening confinement reduces cross sections with increasing temperature . when temperature increases from @xmath110 0.75 to 0.9 , the @xmath0 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 sizes increase rapidly and cross sections can thus go up .",
    "the two factors make the cross section for each of the four @xmath125 or @xmath126 reaction channels at the threshold energy plus @xmath127 gev decrease first and increase next , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : ppdsds ] , [ fig : ppdsads ] , [ fig : pcdsds ] and [ fig : pcdsads ] , while temperature changes from 0 to 0.9@xmath100 .",
    "charmonium dissociation in collision with @xmath0 meson has four channels .",
    "the unpolarised dissociation cross section in the dissociation - rate formula is the sum of the unpolarised cross sections for the four channels . in collision of @xmath0 with @xmath11 ( @xmath76 , @xmath77 ) @xmath128",
    "is the unpolarised cross section for @xmath129 ( @xmath130 , @xmath131 ) .",
    "numerical results of dissociation rates as functions of charmonium momentum are plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig : pjnvs]-[fig : pcnvs ] . since the @xmath0 distribution function , the unpolarised cross section and the relative velocity in eq .",
    "( 10 ) vary with temperature , the dissociation rate depends on temperature . as temperature increases from @xmath110 0.65 to 0.95 ,",
    "the @xmath0 mass decreases and the @xmath0 distribution function increases .",
    "this is a factor that increases the charmonium dissociation rate . at zero charmonium momentum",
    "the slope of each curve is zero .",
    "because @xmath0 mesons obey the bose - einstein distribution , there is a domain of @xmath90 in eq .",
    "( 10 ) , which keeps @xmath132 near the threshold energy so that the unpolarised cross section contributes significantly . while the charmonium momentum increases , the domain shrinks and the dissociation rate thus decreases . since the dissociation rates of @xmath11 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 with @xmath0 are less than 0.00066 , 0.002 and 0.0008 , respectively ,",
    "the charmonium suppression caused by the @xmath0-charmonium dissociation is weak .",
    "using the temperature - dependent quark potential that is derived from perturbative qcd at short distances and the lattice gauge results at intermediate- and large - distances , we obtain the unpolarised cross sections in the quark - interchange mechanism and in the born approximation .",
    "the reactions that we concern are @xmath1 , @xmath2 or @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 or @xmath3 , @xmath7 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 or @xmath3 and @xmath99 .",
    "the meson masses , confinement and mesonic quark - antiquark relative - motion wave functions cause the large variation of the cross sections with respect to temperature .",
    "medium effects on the dissociation reactions are prominent .",
    "when the confinement gives similar contributions to two reaction channels , the spin - spin interaction makes the difference of the unpolarised cross sections for the two channels . using the unpolarised cross sections for the 12 reactions , we obtain the dissociation rates of charmonia in the interactions with the @xmath0 meson .",
    "the rates generally increase with increasing temperature or with increasing charmonium momentum .",
    "the rates are quite small .      s. g. matinyan and b. mller , phys . rev .",
