    "the equations are supposed to hold for all @xmath7 and are complemented by appropriate initial conditions .",
    "the system  may serve as a starting point for considering more realistic adsorption and desorption processes or as a reduced model for volume - surface reaction - diffusion processes arising in cell biology . but",
    "despite its simplicity , this model problem already features some interesting properties which will be of main interest for our further considerations :    * the system preserves non - negativity of solutions . *",
    "the total mass @xmath8 is conserved for all time .",
    "* there exists a unique constant positive detailed balance equilibrium which can be parametrized explicitly by the total mass @xmath9 and the model parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 . *",

    "our arguments are closely related to the concepts of structure - preserving schemes , geometric integration , and compatible discretization that have been developed over the last decades .",
    "we refer the reader to the extensive survey @xcite and the references therein .",
    "several results concerning the preservation of entropic structures for discretization schemes have been obtained more recently , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "this paper adds to this research by addressing the analysis and numerical solution of coupled volume - surface reaction - diffusion systems .",
    "apart from the entropy arguments , the numerical analysis is based on standard tools for the discretization of evolution problems @xcite , on previous work concerning the analysis of domain approximations @xcite , and on recent results from @xcite , who considered a somewhat simpler stationary volume - surface reaction - diffusion problem .",
    "the entropy estimates will allow us to establish order optimal convergence estimates with constants that are uniform in time .",
    "the model problem  is simple enough to avoid complicated notation and to present our basic ideas in the most convenient way to the reader . to illustrate the applicability to more general problems , we consider in section  [ sec : extension ] the following system which models the evolution of four conformations of the key protein lgl during the mitosis of drosophila sop precursor stem - cells @xcite .",
