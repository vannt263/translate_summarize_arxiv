    "with the establishment of the cosmological distance scale of @xmath5-ray bursts ( grbs ) and the considerable success of the synchrotron - shock model @xcite to explain the broadband ( radio through x - ray ) continuum afterglow signatures of grbs @xcite , it is now generally accepted that grbs are initiated by a relativistic pair fireball , transferring its internal energy into kinetic energy of a relativistic blast wave @xcite .",
    "non - thermal particle acceleration at the forward shock and subsequent radiative cooling is believed to lead to the formation of a broken power - law distribution of ultrarelativistic electrons , producing the observed broadband afterglow radiation primarily through synchrotron emission ( e.g. , @xcite ) , though compton upscattering of synchrotron photons may also play a significant role @xcite .    in the relativistic fireball / blastwave model for grbs ,",
    "a large amount of energy is released in a short period of time .",
    "this initial configuration is highly opaque to @xmath0 absorption and pair production and leads to the formation of a relativistic pair fireball .",
    "as the fireball expands , it cools adiabatically , converting its internal energy into bulk kinetic energy of the outflow , and its @xmath0 opacity decreases until it becomes optically thin to @xmath0 pair production . at this time , the pairs are essentially cold in a reference frame co - moving with a small section of the expanding pair plasma / radiation shell .",
    "it has been recognized very early - on ( e.g. , @xcite ) that even a small intrinsic or external contamination of the pair fireball with baryons would lead to re - conversion of most of the fireball energy into kinetic energy of the outflow , and that any radiation escaping the pair fireball during this phase of energy conversion would have quasi - thermal signatures .",
    "however , more detailed measurements of time - averaged photon spectra emerging from grbs , in particular by the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) on board the _ compton gamma - ray observatory _ ( cgro ) have shown that they can generally be fitted successfully with a model consisting of two power - laws , smoothly connected by an exponential turn - over @xcite .",
    "such a power - law high - energy spectrum was interpreted as the radiative signature of non - thermal particle acceleration at relativistic shocks formed in the process of deceleration of the relativistic blast wave produced during the initial fireball stage ( e.g. , @xcite ) . while it is now generally agreed that the smoothly decaying afterglow emission observed from many grbs",
    "is produced by relativistic electrons accelerated at the external forward shock , in the stage when the blast wave is efficiently being decelerated by the sweeping - up of external material , many researchers now believe that the emission during the prompt grb phase may be produced in internal shocks during collisions of subsequent relativistic blast waves produced in a series of energy release events from the central engine ( e.g. , @xcite ) , although an external - shock scenario for the prompt grb phase can not be ruled out at this time ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "both internal and external shock scenarios for grbs are generally starting out with the assumption that the relativistic blast wave has produced a relativistic shock with fully developed hydromagnetic turbulence in order to allow for efficient non - thermal particle acceleration at the shock front .",
    "this neglects the fact that it takes a finite amount of time to build up the necessary turbulence in the two - stream multi - fluid system consisting of the relativistically moving pair plasma and the background hydrogen plasma .",
    "while a detailed treatment of the process of the development of hydromagnetic turbulence through a relativistic two - stream instability is rather cumbersome ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , the time scale for the development of such turbulence can be estimated by the alfvn crossing time through the shell of relativistically moving pair plasma . using hydrodynamics simulations ,",
    "@xcite have demonstrated that a relativistic pair fireball becomes rapidly compressed into a shell of co - moving thickness @xmath6 with @xmath7 during the early evolution of the fireball , and that the ratio @xmath8 remains approximately constant after this compression phase , as long as the blast wave is coasting ( i.e. @xmath9  const . ) .",
    "a relativistic pair fireball of this thickness , carrying a total energy per unit solid angle of @xmath10  erg  sr@xmath11  erg  sr@xmath12 is initially highly optically thick to thomson scattering and thus radiatively inefficient since radiation will remain trapped within the shell . here , @xmath13",
    "@xmath14 is the co - moving pair density ( throughout the paper , primed quantities refer to the reference frame co - moving with the pair plasmoid ) , and @xmath15  cm , where @xmath16  cm is a typical value for the thomson thinning radius ( see  [ results ] ) .",
    "we assume that the magnetic field given by the equipartition parameter @xmath17 between magnetic field and pair plasma energy density ( i.e. , @xmath18 ) , and that the pair plasma is cold in the co - moving frame .",
    "then , for a bulk lorentz factor @xmath19 , the alfvn crossing time scale in the observer s frame is    @xmath20    thus , eq . ( [ t_a ] ) indicates that it may take @xmath21  1",
    "s , i. e. a non - negligible fraction of the prompt grb phase , to build up the hydromagnetic turbulence for non - thermal particle acceleration at either internal or external shocks associated with these pair blastwaves .    the time scale ( in the observer s frame ) for collisional processes , @xmath22 , may be estimated as    @xmath23    indicating that during the initial phase  prior to the generation of strong hydromagnetic turbulence  the radiative and energy - exchange processes in the blast wave are dominated by collisional processes .",
    "this fact is particularly interesting in view of the evidence in a significant fraction of grb that the early time - resolved batse spectra show too hard a low - energy spectrum to be produced by non - thermal synchrotron emission @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite has found evidence in several batse grbs that their very early spectra are described better by thermal rather than nonthermal emission .    setting both time scales ( [ t_a ] ) and ( [ t_coll ] ) equal",
    ", one can estimate the condition under which non - thermal particle acceleration may begin to dominate the particle energization behind the forward shock .",
    "wwe find that collisional processes will dominate as long as    @xmath24    although alternative emission models for the prompt grb radiation have been proposed by several authors ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the dynamics and radiative signatures of the transition phase between the time when the fireball becomes optically thin and the time of efficient non - thermal particle acceleration by hydromagnetic turbulence has not been studied in detail . in this paper",
    ", we are simulating the evolution of and time - dependent emission from a relativistic pair plasmoid before the generation of hydromagnetic turbulence leading to non - thermal particle acceleration . in  [ modelsetup ] , we describe and motivate the basic assumptions of our model .",

    "the blastwave interacts with an external medium ( normal electron - proton plasma ) of density @xmath27  @xmath14 in the stationary frame of the surrounding medium . at",
    "any given time , the plasmoid is located at a radius @xmath28  cm from the center of the explosion and has a thickness @xmath29 in the co - moving frame .",

    "we assume @xmath37 to be constant throughout our simulation .",
    "in fact , a gradual build - up of the magnetic field from lower initial values of @xmath37 may extend the period of applicability of our approach .",
    "we are following the evolution of both the pair plasma as it is being energized by coulomb and inelastic ( i.e. bremsstrahlung ) collisions with swept - up electrons and protons from the surrounding medium , and cools via radiative and adiabatic cooling .",
    "simultaneously , we solve for the evolution of the population of suprathermal protons and electrons which are swept up from the environment with an initial lorentz factor @xmath38 in the co - moving frame of the plasmoid , and transfer their energy to the background pair plasma and into radiation .",
    "electrons and protons which are swept up by the pair blastwave have an initial lorentz factor @xmath38 in the co - moving frame , and will transfer part of their kinetic energy to the background pairs in the plasmoid via elastic scattering ( mller / bhabha and coulomb scattering , respectively ) , thus heating the thermal pair plasma .",
    "the remainder of the kinetic electron / proton energy will be radiated away through bremsstrahlung with the background plasma and through synchrotron radiation .",
    "the thermal background plasma will be heated by collisions with the swept - up electrons and protons and cool via bremsstrahlung and synchrotron emission , adiabatic losses and pair annihilation .",
    "the very short time scale for elastic scattering in the plasmoid ( see eq . [ [ t_coll ] ] ) indicates that the incoming particles are rapidly isotropized in the co - moving frame of the plasmoid .",
    "thus , we assume local isotropy of the particle distributions .      in the following , we quote simple approximation formulae for the cooling rates for suprathermal electrons and protons in a cold background pair plasma , which will be used in our simulations to follow the evolution of the swept - up non - thermal particle distributions .",
    "for highly relativistic test particles , the elastic scattering cross sections for electron - electron ( mller ) and electron - positron ( bhabha ) scattering are approximately equal , and we may use a simple power - law fit to the mller scattering energy exchange rate of a test particle with a cold background pair plasma given by @xcite .",
    "we find    @xmath39    the and bremsstrahlung energy loss rate can be approximated as    @xmath40    suprathermal electrons will also emit synchrotron radiation , thus losing energy at a rate    @xmath41    finally , we take into account synchrotron - self - compton emission and estimate the associated energy loss as    @xmath42    where @xmath43 is the energy density in synchrotron photons .",
    "these estimates indicate that except for the highest - energy electrons ( with @xmath44 ) , the energy loss will be dominated by elastic scattering , leading to rapid thermalization of the suprathermal electrons .    for coulomb losses of suprathermal protons in the cold pair plasma , we use eq .",

    "the result has not yet been published elsewhere , we derive the complete expression in appendix [ pbrloss ] . in our simulations , we use a simple power - law fit to the resulting bremsstrahlung energy loss rate : @xmath47 finally , we take into account synchrotron emission of ultrarelativistic protons , leading to an energy loss of    @xmath48    as in the case of suprathermal electrons , we expect that the swept - up protons will lose energy primarily via elastic scattering with the thermal background pair plasma .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , we generally expect that the energy loss of both protons and electrons might be dominated by coulomb interactions for @xmath49 .",
    "however , for the highest - energy protons and electrons , synchrotron losses may also play an important role .",

    "<S> we show that for a short period of time , @xmath1  a few seconds after the initial explosion , the pair plasmoid evolution might be dominated by collisional processes prior to the formation of a collisionless shock . </S>",
    "<S> we simulate these processes during the early pair plasmoid evolution and calculate the expected radiative signatures . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the radiation from the collision - dominated pair plasmoid phase results in a short ( @xmath2  a few ms ) flash of thermal soft x - ray emission , followed by a transition phase of @xmath3  s during which the fireball turns thomson thin , but its radiation remains dominated by thermal comptonization , peaking at around @xmath4  100 mev  a few gev . while the very early thermal emission could be associated with the quasi - thermal radiation signatures found in the very early phases of several bright batse grbs , the predicted subsequent flash of high - energy emission should be easily detectable with the glast satellite . </S>"
