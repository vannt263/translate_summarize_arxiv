    "quantum information and quantum communication have greatly impacted the development direction of modern science . on the one hand , quantum cryptograph , such as quantum key distribution @xcite , quantum secret sharing ( qss ) @xcite",

    "can solve a certain problem much faster than classical algorithms @xcite .    in quantum world , quantum entanglement is a crucial resource and an amazing application of entanglement is quantum teleportation @xcite , which can securely transmit a quantum state from a preparer to a remote receiver by virtue of pre - shared entangled resource .",
    "if the preparer has already known the information of the state , the transmission can be achieved by rsp @xcite with simpler measurement and less classical communication costs .",
    "the original rsp scheme only has one preparer who knows all the information of the prepared state .",
    "but for highly sensitive and important information , it might not be reliable to let one person hold everything . to solve this potential problem , joint rsp ( jrsp )",
    "has been proposed @xcite , which involves at least two preparers .",
    "each preparer holds partial information and only if certain preparers work together can the state be remotely prepared , similar to the idea of secret sharing .",
    "however , a serious problem for most of the previous jrsp schemes @xcite is that they are probabilistic , i.e. , the success probability is less than 1 .",
    "recently , a new direction of jrsp , namely deterministic jrsp ( djrsp ) has been put forward .",

    "quantum noise is an unavoidable factor in practical quantum communication system , which will severely affect the security and reliability of the system @xcite . for a rsp scheme ,",
