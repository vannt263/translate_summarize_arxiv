    "optomechanical systems , which are based on the interaction between optical and mechanical degrees of freedom , are currently under intense research focus @xcite .",
    "much of the interest in these systems is due to their ability to access quantum mechanics at more macroscopic scales than ever before .",
    "for example , a major accomplishment of the field has been the cooling of a microfabricated harmonic oscillator , consisting of roughly @xmath0 atoms , to its quantum mechanical ground state @xcite .",
    "optomechanical systems therefore provide an avenue for investigating fundamental quantum mechanical issues such as wave function collapse @xcite , superposition @xcite , decoherence @xcite , entanglement @xcite , backaction @xcite and planck - scale physics @xcite .",
    "furthermore , these optomechanical systems hold great potential as platforms for ultrasensitive measurement technologies . indeed , optomechanical principles underlie cutting - edge displacement @xcite and force @xcite sensors , phonon detectors @xcite , gravitational wave interferometers @xcite , thermometers @xcite , accelerometers @xcite , and magnetometers @xcite , to cite a few examples .",
    "while a variety of physical configurations are used in the investigations mentioned above , in almost all of them , the optical and mechanical degrees of freedom interact via the exchange of _ linear _ momentum .",
    "however , light can also exchange _ angular _ momentum with matter @xcite . since the pioneering experiment of beth , it has been known that light can carry spin angular momentum ( i.e. polarization ) , which in turn can exert torque on bulk matter @xcite .",
    "subsequently , a seminal paper by allen et al . in 1992 pointed out that photons could also carry orbital angular momentum ( oam ) , encoded as spatial structure in the transverse profile of the corresponding optical beam @xcite . unlike spin , which can only take values @xmath1",
    ", photonic oam can take any value @xmath2 of importance to this tutorial is the fact that oam - carrying beams can exert torque on matter as well , with experiments demonstrating optical rotation effects on nanoparticles @xcite , liquid crystals @xcite , and bose - einstein condensates @xcite , for example . also of relevance",
    "is the fact that , due to their intrinsic spatial inhomogeneities , beams with oam can sense the circulation of material particles , via the rotational doppler shift @xcite .",
    "this has been verified in velocimetry experiments @xcite ( which have also been implemented with circularly polarized beams @xcite ) .",
    "further , it is relevant to mention that the practically infinite hilbert space corresponding to the virtually unlimited oam available per photon has proved to be an important resource for quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "lastly , oam carried by an optical beam is associated with the presence of singularities , i.e. vortices , in the beam profile .",
    "these structures have their own interesting dynamics and place oam - carrying beams into the larger arena of ` singular optics ' @xcite .",
    "there are many other applications of oam - carrying beams ; we have mainly mentioned those which are relevant to our discussion .",
    "this tutorial aims to introduce optomechanical systems which are based on angular momentum exchange between light and matter . for the optical fields",
    ", this will imply the consideration of photons carrying either polarization or oam .",
    "for the mechanics , torsional and free rotational motion will be of importance .",
    "to our knowledge , existing introductions to , and reviews of , the micromanipulation of matter with angular momentum - carrying beams largely deal with liquid media @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the present tutorial will consider instead only systems under vacuum . with few exceptions , we will consider beams carrying well - defined optical angular momentum per photon , and",
    "will neglect the effects of linear photonic momentum on mechanical torsional or free rotational motion @xcite .",
    "it is worth stating explicitly the interest behind considering the two types of mechanical motion mentioned above .",
    "torsional oscillators are often the instruments of choice for precision measurement experiments . for example , they were used in historic measurements of the static electric force by coulomb @xcite , of the gravitational force by cavendish @xcite , and of optical polarization by beth @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a key difference between linear and torsional oscillations is that the linear vibrational motion of an object is affected by its total mass , while the torsional oscillations are affected not only by the total mass but also by how that mass is distributed , i.e. by the moment of inertia .",
    "for example , the mass of a sphere of radius @xmath3 varies as @xmath4 , but the moment of inertia goes as @xmath5 thus , smaller objects are easier to move linearly , but even easier to move torsionally .",
    "these distinctions make it worthwhile to study torsional oscillations on their own .    on the other hand ,",
    "free mechanical rotation presents some entirely novel features , compared to linear or torsional oscillatory motion , especially in the quantum regime .",
    "for example , it is well known that since the harmonic oscillator is a linear system ( i.e. its equations of motion are linear in the dynamical variables , or equivalently , the energy eigenvalues are evenly spaced ) , quantum effects are quite difficult to observe . in other words , the quantum oscillator behaves , for the most part , like a classical oscillator . to observe quantum effects ,",
    "one usually needs to introduce some sort of nonlinear interaction , for example , by coupling the oscillator to the mode of an electromagnetic field , or to a two - level system @xcite .",
    "the free rotor , in contrast , is a nonlinear system ( i.e. its equations of motion are nonlinear in the dynamical variables , or equivalently , its energy spectrum is anharmonic , see below ) , which suggests that it might be easier to observe quantum effects in its behavior without the use of any auxiliary systems .",
    "one such quantum effect , which would be interesting to verify at much larger than atomic mass scales , is the quantization of angular momentum , one of the central predictions of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "a second intriguing feature of the rotor is that , unlike the harmonic oscillator ( and other elementary quantum systems such as the square well , the delta function well , or the morse potential ) , it has no ground state energy @xcite .",
    "this can be seen from the hamiltonian of a particle of mass @xmath6 rotating in a circle of radius @xmath3 , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the angular momentum of the particle , and @xmath9 is its moment of inertia .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath10 are @xmath11 thus , the ground state @xmath12 is perfectly rotationless . finally , the prospect of observing counter - rotating superpositions of mechanically rotating states @xcite is quite tantalizing , and is the neutral mechanical analog of counter - propagating persistent electronic currents in superconducting circuits @xcite . from a more practical point of view , freely rotating mechanical systems could possibly be used for gyroscopy @xcite and for storing photonic oam @xcite .",
    "conversely , optical beams carrying oam could be used to probe mechanical rotation , in a quantum - limited manner @xcite .",
    "the remainder of the tutorial is organized in the following way .",
    "we first introduce optomechanics based on electromagnetic modes confined to optical resonators .",
    "section  [ sec : vco ] describes cavity - based vibrational optomechanics , and lays the ground for the formalism , basic physics and applications to follow later .",
    "section  [ sec : oam ] then introduces oam - carrying beams .",
    "the material presented thus far is then utilized to explain cavity - based torsional and rotational optomechanics in sections  [ sec : torsionalopto ] and  [ sec : rco ] respectively .",
    "accounting for the more recent interest in cavityless optomechanical systems , we have included some material on this topic in section  [ sec : cavless ] .",
    "the tutorial ends with a conclusion in section  [ sec : con ] and acknowledgments in section  [ sec : ack ] .",
    "the format for each section is to first introduce a basic physical configuration .",
    "this is done typically , but not in all cases , using work published by our own group , simply because we understand our own work best .",
    "subsequently , reference is made to other works in the field .",
    "although we have tried to be inclusive in making such references , we apologize to all authors whose works are not adequately cited .",
    "in this section , we will provide a brief review of standard linear vibrational cavity optomechanics @xcite ; those who are familiar with the material may wish to proceed directly to section  [ sec : oam ] .",
    "a number of comprehensive reviews of the topic already exist @xcite , so we will not be aiming to achieve detail or rigor in our presentation . rather , our discussion will be largely heuristic , focusing on the physics rather than the mathematical details , and aimed mainly at making the ensuing discussion of rotational optomechanics accessible .",
    "although we will be making reference to both classical and quantum regimes for the relevant optomechanical systems , we will largely employ the formalism of second quantization , which makes the notation compact and also reveals the microscopic physics of the system in terms of its fundamental quanta .",
    "we begin below by reviewing this formalism for massive particles as well as electromagnetic fields .",
    "consider a simple harmonic oscillator of mass @xmath6 oscillating at frequency @xmath13 , in one dimension .",
    "the corresponding classical mechanical hamiltonian is given by @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the oscillator position and momentum , respectively .",

    "( [ eq : hamsho ] ) @xmath23 @xmath24 in real systems , and certainly in optomechanical setups , it is important to account for damping and fluctuations experienced by the oscillator as a result of its coupling to the environment .",

    "this principle is the basis of interferometers such as ligo which seek to transduce weak gravitational waves into detectable mechanical displacements @xcite .",

    "this is allowed because the photons belong to a quasi - mode with nonzero linewidth , and need not both have exactly the same frequency .",

    "a detailed treatment indicates that by tuning the driving laser to below the cavity resonance @xmath106 allows the cooling to dominate over the heating ; such a scheme has been used for laser cooling a mesoscopic mechanical oscillator to its quantum ground state @xcite .",
    "in this section , we will provide a brief introduction to optical beams carrying angular momentum @xcite .",
    "we will assume the reader is familiar with the fact that a photon can have spin angular momentum @xmath107 , corresponding classically to circularly polarized radiation .",
    "this is one way in which optical beams can carry angular momentum .",
    "another way is by encoding the appropriate structure in the beam phase @xcite .",
    "each photon in the beam can then be thought of as carrying an oam which can take unlimited values in principle , and quite high values in practice .",
    "although a clear separation of spin and orbital angular momentum degrees of freedom is generally a subtle matter @xcite , in this article we will operate under conditions where the requirements for effecting this separation are fulfilled .",
    "specifically , we will work in the paraxial regime of beam propagation , where the separation is valid .",

    "based on this discussion we will consider some general properties of such beams , which come in several families @xcite .",

    "<S> the subject of optomechanics involves interactions between optical and mechanical degrees of freedom , and is currently of great interest as an enabler of fundamental investigations in quantum mechanics , as well as a platform for ultrasensitive measurement devices . </S>",
    "<S> the majority of optomechanical configurations rely on the exchange of linear momentum between light and matter . </S>",
    "<S> we will begin this tutorial with a brief description of such systems . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently , we will introduce optomechanical systems based on _ angular _ momentum exchange . in this context , </S>",
    "<S> optical fields carrying polarization and orbital angular momentum will be considered , while for the mechanics , torsional and free rotational motion will be of relevance . </S>",
    "<S> our overall aims will be to supply basic analyses of some of the existing theoretical proposals , to provide functional descriptions of some of the experiments conducted thus far , and to consider some directions for future research . </S>",
    "<S> we hope this tutorial will be useful to both theorists and experimentalists interested in the subject . </S>"
