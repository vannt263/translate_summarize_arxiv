    "in 1984 , bennett and brassard proposed the first protocol for quantum key distribution ( qkd ) which is now known as bb84 protocol @xcite .",
    "this pioneering work drew a considerable amount of attention from the scientific community , as it was shown to be able to provide unconditional security , a desired feature for all key distribution schemes , but unachievable in the domain of classical cryptography . the fact that unconditional security can be provided if we use quantum resources for key distribution led to extensive studies on the protocols of secure quantum communication ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for further details ) .",
    "initial studies were limited to qkd @xcite .",
    "these initial studies on qkd brought out a number of facts which were further established later . here ,",
    "in the context of the present work , we wish to specially stress on a specific aspect . in 1991",
    ", ekert proposed a protocol for qkd using entangled state which can be reduced to bb84 protocol ( which uses single photon ( qubit ) states ) under certain conditions @xcite .",
    "later , bennett introduced a single - photon - based scheme for qkd which requires only 2 states , now known as the b92 protocol @xcite .",
    "soon bbm protocol @xcite was introduced , and it was found that bbm protocol may be viewed as an entangled - state - based analogue of the single - photon - based b92 protocol .",
    "thus , these studies indicated that the security achieved by a single - photon - based scheme can also be achieved by a corresponding entangled - state - based scheme .",
    "as we have already mentioned , initial studies on quantum cryptography were limited to qkd @xcite .",
    "later on , several other aspects of secure quantum communication were investigated .",
    "for example , protocols were proposed for quantum secret sharing @xcite , quantum key agreement ( qka ) @xcite , quantum dialogue ( qd ) @xcite , quantum secure direct communication ( qsdc ) @xcite , and deterministic secure quantum communication ( dsqc ) @xcite . for the purpose of the present study ,",
    "all these schemes of secure quantum communication can be broadly divided in two classes : class a : single - qubit - based schemes which do not use entangled states to implement the protocol , like bb84 protocol @xcite , b92 protocol @xcite , lm05 protocol @xcite , and class b : entangled - state - based protocols , which uses one or more entangled states to implement the protocol .",
    "ekert protocol @xcite , bbm protocol @xcite , ping - pong ( pp ) protocol @xcite , are some of the protocols belonging to class b. in fact , there exists a one to one map between the protocols of class a and class b. in principle , any task that can be implemented using single qubit states can also be implemented using an entangled - state - based scheme .",
    "of course , device independent schemes can be realized only using the protocols of class b. however , we do not wish to stress on that feature ( device independence ) here .",
    "excluding ideas of device independence , it can be shown that the security provided by a scheme of class a and the corresponding scheme of class b is equivalent in the ideal situation , where noise is not present . to illustrate this point in table [ tab : class1 and 2 ]",
    ", we have listed protocols of class a and class b for various tasks related to secure quantum communication . as we have already mentioned in an ideal situation , these schemes ( i.e. , any two schemes shown in the same row of table [ tab : class1 and 2 ] ) are equivalent as far as the ability to perform the cryptographic task in a secure manner is concerned . however , to the best of our knowledge this equivalence is not investigated in the realistic situation ( i.e. , in the presence of noise ) . keeping this fact in mind , this paper aims to perform a comparative study of the protocols for secure quantum communication under various noise models .",
    "specifically , we wish to compare single - qubit - based protocols ( protocols of class a ) with entangled - state - based protocols ( protocol of class b ) under various noise models . here",
    ", it may be noted that although , such comparative study has not yet been performed for protocols of class a and class b mentioned above , a similar comparative study has been performed on conjugate - coding - based protocols of secure quantum communication and orthogonal - state - based protocols of secure quantum communication , which are equivalent in the ideal situation ( @xcite and references therein ) , but not in noisy environment ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "further , there are various equivalent but different decoy - qubit - based strategies ( such as the bb84 subroutine , gv subroutine ) for eavesdropping checking that are used in standard protocols of secure quantum communication .",
    "these subroutines are also known to be equivalent in a noise free environment , but a recent study has established that they are not equivalent in a noisy environment @xcite .",
    "this recent observation has further motivated us to perform the present investigation and to systematically investigate the effect of different type of noises on various type of schemes of secure quantum communication .     from class a & protocol from class",

    "@xcite +   4 & qd & shi et al .",
    "protocol @xcite & ba an protocol @xcite +    there are several noise models @xcite . here",
    ", we will restrict ourselves to the study of the effects of amplitude damping ( ad ) channel , phase damping ( pd ) channel @xcite , collective noise and pauli noise .",
    "finally , we will also discuss squeezed generalized amplitude damping ( sgad ) channel @xcite and note that results for the generalized amplitude damping ( gad ) channel as well as that for the ad channel can be obtained from the results computed for the sgad channel .",
    "the motivation to study these noise models is that the ad noise model deals with an interaction of the quantum system with a zero temperature ( vacuum ) bath .",
    "an energy dissipation is involved in this noise model while not in pd .",
    "these two noise models can bring about the phenomena of entanglement decay and entanglement sudden - death @xcite . here , as we wish to analyze the equivalence between a single - qubit - based scheme with an entanglement - based one , these two noise models become relevant .",
    "collective noise is a coherent effect on all the qubits , viz .",
    ", all the polarization encoded photons traveling through an optical fiber undergo the same birefringence @xcite .",
    "the pauli noise channels include various physically relevant cases , such as bit flip , phase flip , and depolarizing channels @xcite .",
    "sgad channels are a generalization of the ad family of channels , which includes the gad and involves the dissipative interaction with a non - zero temperature bath with non - vanishing squeezing @xcite .",
    "the squeezing , being a quantum resource , provides an edge over gad channels , which study a dissipative interaction with a finite temperature bath without squeezing @xcite .",
    "hence , the choice of sgad channel enables investigations into both non - zero as well as vanishing regimes of squeezing .",
    "the wide applicability of all these noise models sets our motivation to systematically study various schemes for secure quantum communication under noisy environment and to analyze their equivalence .",
    "the remaining part of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : noise - models ] , we briefly discuss the noise models we are going to apply on the schemes mentioned in table [ tab : class1 and 2 ] .",
    "the next section is dedicated to the method adopted to study the effect of noise models described in section [ sec : noise - models ] . in section [ sec : various - protocols ] , we briefly describe the protocols listed in table [ tab : class1 and 2 ] , and report the effect of various type of noises on these protocols with a clear aim to compare single - qubit - based scheme for a specific cryptographic task with the corresponding entangled - state - based scheme .",
    "finally , we conclude in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the most important and widely studied noise models are the ad , pd , collective and pauli noise models .",
    "apart from these , generalization of ad considering a dissipative interaction with a thermal and squeezed thermal bath have been studied as gad and sgad , respectively . here ,",
    "we describe only the sgad channels as the effect of the gad channel can be obtained as its limiting case for zero bath squeezing .",
    "further , as the ad noise is a limiting case of gad , it provides a consistency check of the obtained results under sgad noise . in what follows , we will study the effect of all these noise models on the protocols of secure quantum communication that are listed in table [ tab : class1 and 2 ] .",
    "the noise models we have opted to study in the present paper are briefly described below .",
    "the ad noise simulates the dissipative interaction of a quantum system with a vacuum bath .",
    "a perception about the importance of this noise model can be obtained easily if we consider the large number of theoretical and experimental works on this noise model reported in the recent past ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the kraus operators of an ad channel are given by @xcite @xmath0,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,e_{1}=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc } 0 & \\sqrt{\\eta}\\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{array}\\right],\\label{eq : krauss - amp - damping}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) is the probability of error or decoherence rate .",

    "this is another widely studied noise model .",
    "for instance , pd noise is discussed in refs .",
    "( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this noise model is also experimentally simulated in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a coherent effect of environment on all the travel qubits passing through a channel @xcite can be studied using collective rotation ( cr ) and dephasing ( cd ) noise models .",
    "it is known that the singlet states are resistant to an arbitrary collective noise @xcite .",
    "recently , the effect of collective noise on various schemes of quantum communication has been studied @xcite .",
    "interestingly , these studies provided protocols for quantum communication , which use logical qubits to avoid the effect of collective noise ( cf .",
    "before we proceed further let us briefly introduce cr and cd noise models .",
    "cr noise transforms @xmath4 and @xmath5 . here , @xmath6 is the noise parameter @xcite .",
    "mathematically , a rotation operator acts on the quantum state of travel qubits corresponding to this transformation .",
    "cd noise leaves @xmath7 unchanged while transforms @xmath8 as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the noise parameter @xcite .",
    "this is equivalent to a phase gate .",
    "the set of all pauli channels is a tetrahedron .",
    "the phase flip and phase damping channels correspond to a proper subset of the pauli channels .",
    "depolarizing channels forms a 1-simplex embedded within the convex polytope representing the pauli channels @xcite .",
    "pauli noise @xcite is studied using operators @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 . here",
    ", @xmath16 corresponds to the probability with which a particular pauli operation is applied @xcite .",
    "corresponding expression for the depolarizing channel can be obtained with @xmath17 for @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "specifically , it would mean that with a certain probability the state remains unchanged while with the remaining probability , it becomes completely mixed .",
    "further , information regarding bit flip , phase flip and bit - phase flip channels can be obtained with @xmath19 and @xmath20 for @xmath21 and 2 , respectively .",
    "this kind of noise channel is studied for noise estimation @xcite , channel characterization @xcite and error correction @xcite .",
    "sgad channel is a generalization of the ad and gad channels and is characterized by the following kraus operators @xcite @xmath22,\\end{array}\\ ] ] @xmath23,\\end{array}\\ ] ] @xmath24,\\end{array}\\ ] ] @xmath25,\\end{array}\\label{eq : sgad - kraussoperators2 - 1}\\ ] ] where @xmath26-\\exp\\left(-\\gamma_{0}\\left(2n+1\\right)t\\right)\\right\\ } , $ ] @xmath27 and @xmath28 . here",
    ", @xmath29 is the spontaneous emission rate , @xmath30 and @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 is equal to the bath squeezing angle .",
    "the analytic expression for the parameter @xmath34 is quite involved , and can be obtained from ref .",
    "the beauty of sgad channel is that for zero bath squeezing ( @xmath35 ) , it reduces to gad channel , which can further be reduced to zero temperature bath ( ad channel ) , where @xmath34 becomes 1 .",
    "hereafter , we will avoid the time @xmath36 in the argument of all the expressions under sgad noise for simplicity of notations .",
    "quasiprobability distributions and tomogram of the single and two qubit spin states under the sgad channels have been studied recently in @xcite .",
    "the influence of sgad noise on a quantum cryptographic switch was analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the effect of noise can be studied by using a distance - based measure , fidelity , between the final quantum state expected in the absence of noise and the final state obtained when one of the noise models discussed above is considered . to be precise , the strategy adopted in ref .",
    "@xcite will be used here . before we discuss various protocols of secure quantum communication and the effect of noise on them",
    ", we will briefly summarize the strategy adopted for the task .",
    "consider an initial pure state @xmath37 which is to be evolved under a noisy environment .",
    "the evolution of the state after applying the kraus operators characterizing a particular noise is @xmath38 , where @xmath39s are the kraus operators for the chosen noise model under consideration .",
    "specifically , the kraus operators of ad , pd , sgad and pauli channels are given in section [ sec : noise - models ] .",
    "further , in case of the coherent effect of noise on all the qubits , i.e. , collective noise , the transformed state is obtained as @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the unitary operation due to corresponding noise .",
    "the unitary operations for both collective noises are given in the previous section .    finally ,",
    "fidelity , defined as @xmath42 between the final state after the effect of noise @xmath43 and pure initial state @xmath44 is used as a measure of the effect of noise .",
    "it would be worth mentioning here that the fidelity expression used here has been used in refs .",
    "( @xcite and references therein )",
    ". however , conventionally , an equivalent , but a slightly different definition of fidelity is used , and fidelity for two quantum states @xmath45 and @xmath46 is defined as @xmath47 .    in the current study , we have assumed that one of the noise models is studied at a time .",
    "further , we have also considered that only the travel qubits are affected by the environment , while the qubits not traveling through the channel , i.e. , home qubits remain unaffected .",
    "we briefly review two protocols for each type of secure quantum communication task ( namely , qkd , qka , qsdc and qd ) , and study the effect of the above described noise models on them . for this",
    "we chose one protocol from class a and another one from class b. specifically , for a cryptographic task listed in the second column of table [ tab : class1 and 2 ] , a protocol from class a ( b ) is mentioned in the third ( fourth ) column . here , we aim to compare the protocol mentioned in the third column of table [ tab : class1 and 2 ] with the protocol mentioned in the fourth column of the same row under different type of noise models .",
    "the purpose , is to investigate their equivalence when subjected to different noise models discussed in section [ sec : noise - models ] .",
    "specifically , the strategy mentioned in the previous section is used here to perform the comparison by comparing fidelity .",
    "we obtain expressions of fidelity for the quantum states to be recovered at the end of each protocol .",
    "further , we would like to mention that all the fidelity expressions reported here are obtained as an average fidelity for all possible choices of initial states and encoding on them .",
    "for example , if we consider ba an protocol of qd where a predecided entangled state is used as initial state , then there will be 16 possible cases as alice and bob each can encode messages using 4 different operations .",
    "similarly , for a single - qubit - based qd scheme there are 16 possible cases with 4 initial states and 2 possible encodings by each party .",
    "this is why for each type of qd average fidelity is obtained by computing fidelity for all cases and then averaging .",
    "a similar approach is adopted in the rest of the paper to obtain average fidelity for various protocols .      here , as we compare a single - qubit - based scheme for qkd with a qkd scheme which requires an entangled state .",
    "specifically , we opt for b92 protocol @xcite as an example of single - qubit - based qkd scheme and bbm protocol @xcite as its entangled state counterpart .",
    "a modified version of bb84 with less resources was proposed by bennett in 1992 @xcite .",
    "hence , the protocol is referred to as b92 protocol .",
    "the b92 scheme can be summarized in the following steps :    b92  1 : : :    alice sends a random string of @xmath48 and    @xmath49 to bob , where it is assumed that    @xmath48 and @xmath49 correspond to bit    values 0 and 1 , respectively .",
    "+    we can easily observe the modification from bb84 as , in bb84 a random    string of    @xmath50    was prepared .",
    "b92  2 : : :    bob measures the received qubits in either computational    @xmath51 or diagonal    @xmath52 basis randomly . +    here , bob does not announce his choice of basis , which is in contrast    to bb84 .",
    "b92  3 : : :    from his measurement outcome bob keeps only the qubits with    measurement outcome @xmath53 or @xmath54    and announces the same .",
    "subsequently , alice also discards the rest of    the qubits .",
    "the reason behind discarding the measurement outcomes can    be understood by noting that a contribution to measurement outputs    @xmath48 or @xmath49 can be from both    the initial states @xmath48 and    @xmath49 , due to which the measurement outcomes    @xmath48 or @xmath49 can lead to a    non - conclusive result .",
    "therefore , only @xmath53 or    @xmath54 outcomes are considered which correspond to    alice s bit values 1 and 0 .",
    "hence , these qubits can be used to    generate a random symmetric key .",
    "b92  4 : : :    bob announces the measurement outcomes of a part of the generated    string with the positions of the qubits for verification of    eavesdropping . for the corresponding qubits alice checks the    measurement outcome with the initial state as    @xmath55 and    @xmath56 .",
    "for the errors    above a tolerable limit the protocol is discarded . otherwise a secure    and symmetric key can be generated between the two users .",
    "the protocol described above can be studied under various noise models . when the qubit prepared by alice travels to bob under the effect of ad noise , the obtained fidelity is @xmath57 here , and in the remaining part of the paper , required expressions of fidelity are provided using a notation of the form @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the type of noise model ; @xmath60 is 1 and 2 for single - qubit - based and entanglement - based schemes , respectively ; and @xmath61 denotes the type of secure quantum communication , i.e. , @xmath62 .",
    "now , considering that travel qubits have propagated via a pd channel , we obtain    @xmath63    in the collective noisy environment , the obtained fidelity expressions are    @xmath64    and    @xmath65    for cd and cr noise channels , respectively .",
    "the analytic expressions of fidelity under the effect of pauli and sgad channels are    @xmath66    and    @xmath67    respectively .",
    "the bbm protocol @xcite is a variant of the ekert protocol @xcite , with reduced resources .",
    "specifically , ekert protocol uses three mutually unbiased bases ( mubs ) to calculate the correlation function for detecting eavesdropping when the entanglement source was kept in between the two authenticated users alice and bob @xcite . in contrast , in bbm protocol , the source of entangled photon is given to alice and the requirement of three mubs are reduced to two @xcite .",
    "the protocol can be summarized as follows .",
    "bbm  1 : : :    alice prepares a string of the singlet state    @xmath68    and sends the second qubit to bob keeping the first qubit with    herself .",
    "bbm  2 : : :    both alice and bob measure their qubits of shared quantum state in    either computational    @xmath51 or diagonal    @xmath52 basis randomly .",
    "both the users announce their choices of measurement basis , but not    the measurement outcomes .",
    "bbm  3 : : :    both users decide to discard the measurement outcomes where their    choices of measurement basis were different , as in all the remaining    cases their measurement outcomes are supposed to be correlated .",
    "bbm  4 : : :    finally , both the users choose around half of the string of the    undiscarded instances and announce corresponding measurement outcomes .",
    "if the error in the measurement outcomes is below certain tolerable    limit both alice and bob can obtain a symmetric key using the outcomes    of the measurements performed on the remaining qubits which are not    used for eavesdropping check .",
    "in other words , a lack of correlation in    the measurement outcomes is a signature of the presence of an    adversary .",
    "the entanglement - based protocol of qkd considered here , i.e. , bbm scheme , under the ad , pd , cd and cr noises lead to the following fidelities expressions @xmath69",
    "@xmath70    @xmath71    and    @xmath72    respectively . in case of pauli channels ,",
    "the fidelity only depends on the probability with which the state remains unchanged    @xmath73    hence , a linear plot is expected .",
    "when the qubits travel under the dissipative sgad channel , the compact form of fidelity is    @xmath74    now , we will try to make a comparative analysis of the obtained fidelities expressions in the qkd protocols from the two classes .",
    "when the travel qubits are subjected to ad noise we observe that b92 protocol performs better than bbm protocol for all values of decoherence rate @xmath1 .",
    "quite similar nature is observed with pd noise as well .",
    "the gradual decrease in the fidelity with the increasing decoherence rate for all these cases can be observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : qkd-2d ] a and b. the fact observed here is consistent with some of our recent observations that single qubits perform better while traveling through ad and pd channels @xcite .",
    "interestingly , fidelity obtained for both the qkd schemes considered here is the same when the travel qubits are subjected to cr noise , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : qkd-2d ] c. in the presence of another type of collective noise ( namely cd noise ) , which is dephasing in nature , b92 is again seen to perform better ( cf .",
    "[ fig : qkd-2d ] d ) . here",
    ", it is worth noting that the singlet state is decoherence free in an arbitrary collective noise when both the qubits of the single state travel through the noisy channel .",
    "however , when one of the qubits travels through the channel having collective noise , it gets affected by the noise and as a consequence singlet state also gets affected by the noise .",
    "this is what we have observed here .",
    "expressions of fidelity under pauli noise reveal that for bbm protocol equally affected states will be obtained for bit - flip , phase - flip , bit - phase flip errors with certain probability . for the depolarizing channel the fidelity expression shows a similar nature .",
    "the same expression is obtained for b92 protocol with bit - phase flip error .",
    "further , bit - flip and phase flip errors with equal probabilities affect the state in a similar manner as the expression becomes same in both the cases .",
    "the values are always higher than all others for the same amount of error as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : qkd-2d ] e. the obtained fidelity in depolarizing channels can be seen to be intermediate between the last two .    from the fidelity expressions of sgad noise ,",
    "the corresponding fidelities under ad and gad channels can be obtained as limiting cases . in fig .",
    "[ fig : qkd-2d ] f we can see the advantage obtained due to squeezing .",
    "specifically , for non - zero squeezing we can obtain higher fidelity than that with a gad noisy environment for a longer time period .",
    "further , it can also be observed that a state is more affected while traveling through finite temperature bath than in the vacuum bath ( ad ) .",
    "qkd in ad , pd , cr and cd noises is shown in ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) , respectively . the smooth ( blue ) and dashed ( red ) lines in all these plots correspond to b92 and bbm protocols , respectively . for cr noise both b92 and bbm protocols",

    "the final key is generated after negotiation between both the parties .",

    "the comparative study of single - qubit - based and entangled - state - based schemes of secure quantum communication performed in the present work has lead to a number of interesting conclusions .",
    "firstly , the equivalence observed in the ideal noiseless scenario is lost in more practical scenarios where noise is present .",
    "next , it is observed that it is not possible to say unambiguously that in a noisy environment entangled - state - based protocols perform better than the single - qubit - based protocols or vice versa . in fact",
    ", it depends on the nature of the noise present in the channel .",
    "specifically , single - qubit - based schemes are generally found to be the suitable choice in the presence of ad and/or pd noises , while entanglement - based protocols turns out to be preferable in the presence of collective noises . as sgad and",
    "gad channels are generalizations of the ad channel , conclusions similar to that for the ad channel are also applicable to them . however , with an increase in temperature , fidelity is seen to decay .",
    "squeezing is seen to play the role of a beneficial quantum resource , in a host of scenarios , in practical quantum communication .",
    "also , it is observed that the effect of noise depends upon the number of rounds ( how many times a travel qubit travels through the noisy channel ) of quantum communication involved .",
    "for instance , qkd protocols are least affected by noise , while qd protocols are most affected as in qkd protocols a travel qubit travels only once through the noisy channel , whereas in ba an protocol of qd , it travels twice through the noisy channel .",
    "further , the single - qubit - based qd scheme involves three rounds of communication as it requires alice to bob and bob to alice transmission of qubits and an additional alice to bob travel of equal number of qubits . as a consequence",
    ", single - qubit - based qd scheme is found to be the most affected among the four different single - qubit - based schemes for secure quantum communication discussed in this paper .",
