    "average distance is one of the most important measurements characterizing complex networks , which is a subject attracting a lot of interest in the recent physics literature  @xcite .",
    "extensive empirical studies showed that many , perhaps most , real networks exhibit remarkable small - world phenomenon  @xcite , with their average distance grows as a function of network order ( i.e. , number of nodes in a network ) , or slowly  @xcite .",
    "as a fundamental topological property , average distance is closely related to other structural characteristics , such as degree distribution  @xcite , centrality  @xcite , fractality  @xcite , symmetry  @xcite , and so forth .",
    "all these features together play significant roles in characterizing and understanding the complexity of networks .",
    "moreover , average distance is relevant to various dynamical processes occurring on complex networks , including epidemic spreading  @xcite , target search  @xcite , synchronization  @xcite , random walks  @xcite , and many more .",
    "in addition to the small - world behavior , other two prominent properties that seem to be common to real networks , especially biological and social networks , are scale - free feature  @xcite and modular structure  @xcite .",
    "the former implies that the networks obey a power - law degree distribution as @xmath0 with @xmath1 , while the latter means that the networks can be divided into groups ( modules ) , within which nodes are more tightly connected with each other than with nodes outside . in order to describe simultaneously the two striking properties , ravasz and barabsi ( rb ) presented a famous model  @xcite , mimicking scale - free modular networks .",
    "many topological properties of and dynamical processes on the rb model have been investigated in much detail , including degree distribution  @xcite , clustering coefficient  @xcite , betweenness centrality distribution  @xcite , community structure  @xcite , random walks  @xcite , among others .",
    "particularly , by mapping the networks onto a potts model in one - dimensional lattices , noh proved that the rb model is small - world  @xcite .    in this paper , we study the average distance in the rb model by using an alternative approach very different from the previous one  @xcite . our computation method is based on the particular deterministic construction of the rb model .",
    "concretely , making use of the self - similar structure of the scale - free modular networks , we establish some recursion relations , from which we further derive the exactly analytical solution to the average distance .",
    "our obtained rigorous expression is compatible with the previous formula .",
    "we show that the rb model is small - world .",
    "we also show that the small - world behavior is a natural result of the scale - free and modular architecture of the networks under consideration .",
    "we first introduce the rb model for the scale - free modular networks , which are built in an iterative way  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath2 stand for the network model after @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) iterations ( i.e. , number of generations ) . initially ( @xmath5 ) , the model is composed @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) nodes linked by @xmath8 edges forming a complete graph , among which a node ( e.g. , the central node in figure  [ network ] ) is called hub ( or root ) node , and the other @xmath9 nodes are named peripheral nodes .",
    "at the second generation ( @xmath10 ) , @xmath9 replicas of @xmath11 are created with the @xmath9 peripheral nodes of each copy being connected to the root of the original @xmath11 . in this way",
    ", we obtained @xmath12 , the hub and peripheral nodes of which are the hub of the original @xmath11 and the @xmath13 peripheral nodes in the @xmath9 duplicates of @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "suppose one has @xmath14 , the next generation network @xmath2 can be obtained by adding @xmath15 copies of @xmath14 to the primal @xmath14 , with all peripheral nodes of the replicas being linked to the hub of the original @xmath14 unit .",
    "the hub of the original @xmath14 and the peripheral nodes of the @xmath9 copies of @xmath14 form the hub node and peripheral nodes of @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "repeating indefinitely the two steps of replication and connection , one obtains the scale - free modular networks .",
    "figure  [ network ] illustrates a network @xmath16 for the particular case of @xmath17 .     for the case of @xmath17 .",
    "the filled squares and circles represent the hub node and peripheral nodes , respectively . ]    many interesting quantities of the model can be determined explicitly  @xcite . in @xmath2 ,",
    "the network order , denoted by @xmath18 is @xmath19 ; the degree @xmath20 $ ] of the hub node is the largest among all nodes ; the number of peripheral nodes , forming a set @xmath21 , is @xmath22 ; and the average degree is approximately equal to a constant @xmath23 in the limit of infinite @xmath3 , showing that the networks are sparse .",
    "the model under consideration is in fact an extension of the one proposed in  @xcite and studied in much detail in  @xcite .",
    "it presents some typical features observed in a variety of real - world systems  @xcite .",
    "its degree distribution follows a power - law scaling @xmath0 with a general exponent @xmath24 belonging to the interval @xmath25 .",
    "its average clustering coefficient tends to a large constant dependent on @xmath6 ; and its average distance grows logarithmically with the network order , both of which show that the model is small - world .",
    "in addition , the betweenness distribution @xmath26 of nodes also obeys the power - law behavior @xmath27 with the exponent regardless of the parameter @xmath6 .",
    "particularly , the whole class of the networks shows a remarkable modular structure .",
    "these peculiar structural properties make the networks unique within the category of complex networks .",
    "as shown in the introduction section , average distance is closely related to many topological properties of and various dynamical processes on complex networks . in what follows",
    ", we will derive analytically the average distance of the scale - free modular networks by applying an alternative method completely different from that in  @xcite .",
    "we represent all the shortest path lengths of network @xmath2 as a matrix in which the entry @xmath28 is the distance between nodes @xmath29 and @xmath30 that is the length of a shortest path joining @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "a measure of the typical separation between two nodes in @xmath2 is given by the average distance @xmath31 defined as the mean of distances over all pairs of nodes : @xmath32 where @xmath33 denotes the sum of the distances between two nodes over all couples . notice that in eq .",
    "( [ total01 ] ) , for a pair of nodes @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( @xmath34 ) , we only count @xmath28 or @xmath35 , not both .",
    "( color online ) schematic illustration of the means of construction of the scale - free modular networks .",
    "@xmath36 is obtained by joining @xmath6 replicas of @xmath2 denoted as @xmath37 @xmath38 , which are connected to one another by linking all the peripheral nodes of @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) to the hub node ( denoted by @xmath41 ) of @xmath42 . ]",
    "we continue by exhibiting the procedure of determining the total distance and present the recurrence formula , which allows us to obtain @xmath43 of the @xmath44 generation from @xmath45 of the @xmath3 generation .",
    "the studied network @xmath2 has a self - similar structure that allows one to calculate @xmath45 analytically . by construction ( see figure  [ labeling ] ) , network @xmath36 is obtained by joining @xmath6 copies of @xmath2 that are labeled as @xmath42 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 . using this self - similar property , the total distance @xmath43 satisfies the recursion relation @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the sum over all shortest path length whose endpoints are not in the same @xmath37 branch .",
    "the paths that contribute to @xmath50 must all go through the hub node @xmath41 , where the @xmath6 copies of @xmath2 are connected .",
    "hence , to determine @xmath51 , all that is left is to calculate @xmath50 . the analytic expression for @xmath50 , referred to as the crossing path length  @xcite , can be derived as below .",
    "let @xmath52 be the sum of the lengths of all shortest paths whose endpoints are in @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively .",
    "according to whether the two branches are one link long or two links long , we split the crossing paths @xmath52 into two categories : the first category composes of crossing paths @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) , while the second category consists of crossing paths @xmath57 with @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 .",
    "it is easy to see that the numbers of the two categories of crossing paths are @xmath9 and @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "moreover , any two crossing paths in the same category have the same length .",
    "thus , the total sum @xmath50 is given by @xmath62 having @xmath50 in terms of the quantities of @xmath63 and @xmath64 , the next step is to explicitly determine the two quantities .    to calculate the crossing distance @xmath63 and @xmath64 , we give the following notation . for an arbitrary node @xmath65 in network @xmath2 ,",
    "let @xmath66 be the smallest value of the shortest path length from @xmath65 to any of the @xmath67 peripheral nodes belonging to @xmath21 , and the sum of @xmath66 for all nodes in @xmath2 is denoted by @xmath68 .",
    "analogously , in @xmath2 let @xmath69 denote the distance from a node @xmath65 to the hub node @xmath41 , and let @xmath70 stand for the total distance between all nodes in @xmath2 and the hub node @xmath41 in @xmath2 , including @xmath41 itself . by definition , @xmath71 can be given by the sum @xmath72+(m-1)\\,\\sum_{v",

    "( [ total03 ] ) is consistent with the result previously obtained  @xcite .",
    "then the analytic expression for average distance can be obtained as @xmath86     average distance @xmath31 versus network order @xmath18 on a semi - logarithmic scale .",
    "the solid lines are guides to the eye . ]",
    "we have also checked our rigorous result provided by eq .",
    "( [ apl02 ] ) against numerical calculations for different @xmath6 and various @xmath3 . in all the cases",
    "we obtain a complete agreement between our theoretical formula and the results of numerical investigation , see figure  [ avedis ] .",
    "we continue to express the average distance @xmath87 as a function of network order @xmath18 , in order to obtain the scaling between these two quantities . recalling that @xmath75",
    ", we have @xmath88 .",
    "hence eq .",
    "( [ apl02 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath89 in the infinite network order limit , i.e. , @xmath90 @xmath91 thus , for large networks , the leading behavior of average distance grows logarithmically with increasing network order .",
    "the above observed small - world phenomenon that the leading behavior of average distance is a logarithmic function of network order can be accounted for by the following heuristic arguments based on the peculiar architecture of the networks . at first sight , this family of modular networks is not a very compact system , since in these networks , nodes with large degrees are not directly linked to one another , but connected to those nodes with small degree .",
    "however , this network family is made up of many small densely interconnected clusters , which combine to form larger but less compact groups connected by nodes with relatively high degrees .",
    "for node pairs in a small group , their shortest path length is very small because of the high cohesiveness of small modules . for the length of shortest paths between two nodes belonging to different large groups",
    ", it seems long because the groups that the nodes lie at are not adjacent to each other .",
    "but this is not the fact . by construction , although the relatively large groups are not directly adjacent , they are joined by some large nodes , which are connected to each other by a layer of intermediate small - degree nodes ( see figure  [ network ] ) , such as the peripheral nodes or locally peripheral nodes  @xcite .",
    "thus , different from conventional random scale - free networks , especially assortative networks  @xcite , in the studied scale - free modular networks , although large - degree nodes are not connected to one another , they play the role of bridges linking different modules together , which is the main reason why the average distance of the networks is small .",
    "it deserves to be mentioned that , although the studied modular scale - free networks display small - world behavior , the logarithmic scaling of average distance with respect to network order is different from the sublogarithmic scaling for conventional non - modular stochastic scale - free networks with degree distribution exponent @xmath92 , in which the average distance @xmath93 behaves as a double logarithmic scaling with network order @xmath94 , namely ,",
    "@xmath95  @xcite .",
    "thus , despite that the degree distribution exponent of the modular scale - free networks is smaller than 3 , their average distance is larger than that of their random counterparts with the same network order .",
    "the root of this difference may also lie with the modular structure , particularly the indirect connection of large nodes , as addressed above .",
    "the genuine reasons for this dissimilarity need further studies in the future .",
    "the determination and analysis of average distance is important to understand the complexity of and dynamic processes on complex networks , which has been a subject of considerable interest within the physics community . in this paper",
    ", we investigated analytically the average distance in a class of deterministically growing networks with scale - free behavior and modular structure , which exist simultaneously in a plethora of real - life networks , such as social and biological networks . based on the self - similar structure of the networks ,",
    "we derived the closed - form expression for the average distance .",
    "the obtained exact solution shows that for very large networks , they are small - world with their average distance increasing as a logarithmic function of network order . we confirmed the rigorous solution by using extensive numerical simulations .",
    "we also showed that the small - world behavior lies with the inherent modularity and scale - free property of the networks .",
