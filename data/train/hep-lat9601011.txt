    "interfaces play an essential role in many areas of science . in condensed matter physics ,",
    "the most prominent examples are surfaces of liquids and solids . in 1951 burton ,",
    "cabrera and frank @xcite pointed out that a phase transition may occur in the equilibrium structure of crystal surfaces .",
    "such a phase transition from a smooth to a rough surface is called a roughening transition .",
    "they viewed a growing layer of a crystal as a two dimensional ising model .",
    "the part of the layer occupied by atoms is represented by spin + 1 , while the vacancies are represented by spin -1 . from the exact solution of the two - dimensional ising model @xcite one then infers the existence of a phase transition .",
    "however this picture of a crystal surface is very crude . obviously in a real crystal surface",
    "there are more than just one single incomplete layer of atoms .",
    "a better description of a crystal in equilibrium with its vapour is provided by the three - dimensional ising model , where spin + 1 represents a site occupied by an atom , while spin -1 represents a vacancy .",
    "the boundary conditions are chosen such that an interface between a region with most spins equal to + 1 and a region with most spins equal to -1 is present . in 1973 weeks",
    "@xcite performed a low temperature expansion for the width of an ( 001 ) interface in a three - dimensional ising model on a simple cubic lattice with isotropic couplings .",
    "they obtained a roughening temperature @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the temperature of the bulk phase transition , while the approximation of the interface by the two dimensional ising model yields @xmath3 .",
    "the best known value for the inverse of the critical temperature of the three - dimensional ising model on a simple cubic lattice is given by @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "a fairly good approximation of the ising interface is given by the so called sos ( solid on solid ) models . neglecting overhangs of the interface and bubbles in the bulk ,",
    "the variables of the two dimensional models give the height of the interface measured above some reference plane .",
    "a duality transformation exactly relates these models with two dimensional @xmath5 models @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the two - dimensional ising model which undergoes a second - order phase transition , sos models , as @xmath5 models , are expected to undergo a kosterlitz - touless ( kt ) phase transition @xcite .",
    "the important question is whether overhangs of the interface and bubbles in the bulk - phases are irrelevant for the critical behaviour of the interface in the ising model and hence the roughening transition is of kt nature as it is the case for sos models .",
    "monte carlo simulations of the interface in a three - dimensional ising model have been performed in order to answer this question @xcite .    however , the numerical determination of the transition temperature and the confirmation of the kt nature of the phase transition has turned out to be extremely difficult . the reason for this problem",
    "can be found in the kt theory itself . at the roughening transition corrections",
    "are present that vanish logarithmically with the length scale .",
    "therefore for all lattices sizes that can be simulated one is quite far away from the gaussian fixed point that is the basis for the formulas used for fits in refs .",
    "@xcite . in order to overcome",
    "this problem one has to take into account the logarithmic corrections in the analysis of the data @xcite .",
    "however one can do even better .",
    "the body centered cubic solid on solid ( bcsos ) model that was introduced by van beijeren in 1977 @xcite as a solid on solid approximation of an interface in an ising model on a body centered cubic lattice on a ( 001 ) lattice plane is solved exactly .",
    "the bcsos model is equivalent with one of the exactly solved vertex models @xcite . the exact formula for the free energy and the correlation length proves the model to have a kt - type phase transition .",
    "in @xcite it was proposed to match the renormalization group ( rg)-flow of other sos models and the ising interface with that of the bcsos model .",
    "the rg - flow is monitored by properly chosen block - observables on finite lattices . in order to determine the roughening temperature of an sos model or the ising interface",
    "one has to find the temperature where the values for the block - observables for the bcsos model at the roughening temperature are reproduced .",
    "this method has been successfully applied to the asos ( absolute value sos ) model , the discrete gaussian model and the dual of the standard @xmath5 model in 2 dimensions @xcite .",
    "preliminary results were also obtained for the ising interface @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we improve the result of ref .",
    "@xcite by drastically increasing the statistics for the ising model as well as for the bcsos model .",
    "the largest lattice size considered is increased from @xmath6 to @xmath7 allowing the direct matching of the ising interface with the bcsos model compared with the indirect approach via the asos model of ref .",
    "@xcite . the high statistical accuracy needed for the matching method",
    "could be obtained in a moderate amount of cpu time ( about two months on a workstation ) due to the use of highly efficient cluster algorithms for the ising interface @xcite as well as for the bcsos model @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we define the models to be studied .",
    "we summarize exact results for the bcsos model @xcite relevant to our study .",
    "we briefly discuss the rg - flow diagram of the kt phase - transition . in section 3",
    "we describe the matching method .",
    "we give particular emphasis to the special problems arising in the case of the ising interface . in section 4",
    "we discuss our numerical results .",
    "a comparison with previous monte carlo studies is presented in section 5 . in section 6",
    "we give our conclusions and an outlook .",
    "we consider an ising model on a simple cubic lattice with extension @xmath8 in x- and y - direction and with extension @xmath9 in z - direction . for reasons given by the algorithm we shall only consider odd values of @xmath9 . we have chosen the convention that the z - coordinate of the lattice points takes the half - integer values @xmath10 .",
    "the ising model is defined by the partition function @xmath11 where the classical hamiltonian is given by @xmath12 where the summation is taken over all nearest neighbour pairs @xmath13 on the lattice , and @xmath14 is the normalized inverse temperature . in x- and y - direction",
    "we consider periodic boundary conditions . in order to create an interface",
    "we apply anti - periodic boundary conditions in the remaining z - direction .",
    "anti - periodic boundary conditions are defined by @xmath15 for bonds @xmath13 connecting the lowermost and uppermost plane of the lattice , while all other nearest neighbour pairs keep @xmath16 .    the asos model is the solid on solid approximation of an interface in an ising system on a simple cubic lattice on a ( 001 ) lattice plane .",
    "it is defined by the partition function @xmath17 where @xmath18 is integer - valued and the summation is taken over the nearest neighbour pairs of a 2d square lattice . at low temperatures the ising interface and the asos model are related by @xmath19 .    in the case of the bcsos model",
    "the two - dimensional lattice splits in two sub - lattices like a checker board . in the original formulation , on one of the sub - lattices",
    "the spins takes integer values , whereas the spins on the other sublattice take half - integer values .",
    "we adopt a different convention : spins on `` odd '' lattice sites take values of the form @xmath20 , and spins on `` even '' sites are of the form @xmath21 , @xmath22 integer . as a consequence , the effective distribution for block spins (= averages over blocks ) will be centered around integer values ( instead of half integer values ) , and the average of the lowest energy configurations take integer values like it is the case for the asos models defined above .",
    "the partition function of the bcsos model can be expressed as @xmath23 } |h_i - h_k| )   \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are next to nearest neighbours .",
    "nearest neighbour spins @xmath18 and @xmath26 obey the constraint @xmath27 .",
    "van beijeren @xcite has shown that the configurations of the bcsos model are in one - to - one correspondence to the configurations of the f model , which is a special six vertex model .",
    "the f model can be solved exactly with transfer matrix methods @xcite . for our choice of the field variable",
    "the roughening coupling is given by @xmath28 the critical behaviour of non - local quantities such as the correlation length @xmath29 is known and has the form predicted by kt theory @xcite .",
    "the rg - flow of sos models is well described by two parameters @xmath30 and @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "the two dimensional sine gordon model is especially suited to discuss the flow of these parameters with the length scale , since this model contains @xmath30 and @xmath31 as bare parameters in its action . on the lattice it is given by the partition function @xmath32",

    "it is given , to second order in perturbation theory , by @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath37 depends on the particular cutoff scheme used .",
    "the derivative is taken with respect to the logarithm of the cutoff scale . for large @xmath38 , @xmath39 flows towards @xmath40 .",
    "the large distance behaviour of the model is therefore the same as that of the massless gaussian model . for small @xmath38",
    ", @xmath39 increases with increasing length scale .",
    "the theory is therefore massive .",
    "the critical trajectory separates these two regions in the coupling space .",
    "it ends at a gaussian fixed point characterized by @xmath41 or @xmath42 . on the critical trajectory",
    "the fugacity vanishes as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the logarithm of the cutoff scale .",
    "in order to compare the rg - flows of the ising interface and the bcsos model we follow closely the method introduced in ref . @xcite .",
    "this method is closely related to the finite size scaling methods proposed by nightingale @xcite and binder @xcite .",
    "no attempt is made to compute the rg - flow of the couplings explicitly , but rather the rg - flow is monitored by evaluating quantities that are primarily sensitive to the lowest frequency fluctuations on a finite lattice . in order to separate the low frequency modes of the field a block - spin transformation @xcite is used .",
    "blocked systems of size @xmath45 are considered . the size @xmath46 of a block ( measured in units of the original lattice spacing ) is then given by @xmath47 , where @xmath8 is the linear size of the original lattice .",
    "for solid on solid models the block - spins are defined by @xmath48 where @xmath49 labels square blocks of a linear extension @xmath46 .",
    "one should note that this linear blocking rule has the half - group property that the successive applications of two transformations with a scale - factor of @xmath46 have exactly the same effect as a single transformation with a scale - factor of @xmath50 .",
    "since the position of the interface in the ising system is not well defined on a microscopic level we have to look for a substitute of the blocking rule applied to the field of the sos models . in the following",
    "we briefly discuss the solution of the problem proposed and applied to the study of interfaces in the rough phase in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "first we have to ensure that the interface is not located at the @xmath51 to @xmath52 boundary , in which case the definition of the blockspin discussed below would become meaningless . therefore we locate the interface in the system in a crude fashion , which is done by searching for the z - slice with the smallest absolute value of the magnetisation",
    ". then we redefine the @xmath39- coordinates such that the interface is located close to @xmath40 .",
    "now one can go ahead with the measurement of interface properties ignoring the periodicity of the lattice in z - direction .",
    "the blocks considered have the full lattice extension d in z - direction and an extension @xmath46 in x- and y - direction .",
    "the interface position is defined inside a block by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the total magnetisation in the block @xmath55 and @xmath56 is the bulk magnetisation .",
    "this definition is motivated by the naive picture that above the interface the magnetisation takes uniformly the value @xmath57 and below the value @xmath56 .",
    "one has to discuss to what extent the meaning of the above definition is spoiled by corrections to this simple picture .",
    "what are the effects of bulk fluctuations and overhangs of the interface ?",
    "the fluctuations of the bulk magnetisation are given by the magnetic susceptibility @xmath58 .",
    "the square of the fluctuations of @xmath54 induced by the bulk fluctuation is therefore given by @xmath59 and the resulting fluctuations of @xmath60 induced by bulk fluctuations is given by @xmath61 as a consequence the larger the block size in x- and y - direction , the better the position of the interface is defined .",
    "however , when @xmath9 is sent to infinity for a fixed @xmath46 , the position of the interface defined by eq .",
    "( [ define ] ) becomes meaningless .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we proposed a radical solution to overcome the problem of bulk fluctuations completely . before the position of the interface",
    "is determined all bubbles are removed .",
    "technically this is accomplished by performing standard cluster - updates at @xmath62 . since the absolute value of the bulk magnetisation becomes 1 in this process the definition of the interface position is modified to @xmath63 overhangs of the interface",
    "are expected on a scale of the bulk correlation length @xmath64 .",
    "therefore we have to assume that the position of the interface only has a well defined meaning if the blocksize is large compared with the bulk correlation length @xmath65 . at the roughening transition this is however no severe restriction since @xmath66 .    finally one should ensure that no additional interfaces are created spontaneously . following ref .",
    "@xcite the surface tension at @xmath67 is @xmath68 .",
    "this is certainly a lower bound for the surface tension at the roughening coupling to be found below .",
    "therefore two additional interfaces are suppressed by at least a factor of @xmath69 , which is certainly sufficient already for the smallest lattice size @xmath70 that we consider .",
    "now we define suitable observables for the blocked systems discussed above .",
    "motivated by the perturbation theory of the sine - gordon model two types of observables are chosen : such that are `` sensitive '' to the flow of the kinetic term ( flow of @xmath71 ) , and such that are sensitive to the fugacity ( periodic perturbation of a massless gaussian model ) .",
    "for the first type of observables we choose @xmath72 where @xmath55 and @xmath49 are nearest neighbours on the block lattice , and @xmath73 where @xmath55 and @xmath74 are next to nearest neighbours .",
    "note that these quantities are only defined for @xmath75 . as a monitor for the fugacity we take the following set of quantities ( defined for @xmath76 ) : @xmath77      as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite there are two parameters which have to be adjusted in order to match the rg flow of the ising interface with that of the critical bcsos model : the coupling @xmath78 of the ising interface and in addition the ratio @xmath79 of the lattice sizes ( and hence the block sizes ) of the ising model and the bcsos model . a @xmath80 is needed to compensate for the different starting points of the two models on the critical rg - trajectory . in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath81 was obtained .    for the proper values of the roughening coupling @xmath82 and",
    "the matching constant @xmath83 observables of the ising interface and the bcsos model match like @xmath84 where @xmath24 indicates the observable and @xmath85 the size of the blocked lattice .",
    "the @xmath86 corrections are due to irrelevant operators .",
    "@xmath87 is the correction to scaling exponent .",
    "the perturbation theory of the sine - gordon model suggests @xmath88 .    in order to obtain a numerical estimate for the roughening coupling @xmath89 of the ising model and the matching factor @xmath83 for a given lattice size @xmath90 of the bcsos model we required that the equation above is exactly fulfilled for two block observables .",
    "in the following we considered the pairs @xmath91 and @xmath92 for @xmath93 and @xmath94 . replacing @xmath95 by @xmath96 or @xmath97 leads to statistically poorer results .",
    "we solved the system of two equations for the two observables @xmath98 and @xmath99 numerically by first computing the @xmath100 and @xmath101 that solve the single equations for a given value of @xmath83 .",
    "the intersection of the two curves @xmath100 and @xmath101 gives us then the solution of the system of two equations . for an illustration of this method see figures 5 and 6 of ref .",
    "@xcite .    in @xcite",
    "it was demonstrated , that the corrections to scaling for the observables @xmath102 and @xmath103 for sos models are similar to those in the massless continuous gaussian model .",
    "therefore we considered the `` improved '' observable @xmath104 which is defined as follows : @xmath105 @xmath106 is computed for the massless gaussian model defined by @xmath107 an improved quantity @xmath108 is defined analogously .",
    "explicit results for @xmath106 and @xmath109 are given in table 4 of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "obviously this modification does not affect the large @xmath8 behaviour since @xmath110 . in the following",
    "we will see that the results for our largest lattice sizes are virtually unaffected by this kind of improvement",
    ". however the benefit for the smaller lattices will be clearly visible .",
    "first we simulated the bcsos model at the roughening coupling @xmath111 on square lattices of the size @xmath112 with periodic boundary conditions imposed .",
    "we considered lattices with sizes ranging from @xmath113 up to @xmath114 .",
    "the loop algorithm of evertz , marcu and lana @xcite enabled us to reduce the statistical error of the bcsos data compared with those given in @xcite by a factor of about 5 .",
    "we performed @xmath115 measurements throughout , except for @xmath114 , where @xmath116 measurements were performed .",
    "the number of loop - updates per measurement was 10 for @xmath113 up to 35 for @xmath114 .",
    "this number was chosen such that the integrated autocorrelation times in units of measurements were about 1 .",
    "these simulations took about 81 hours of cpu time on a ibm risc system/6000 modell 590 ( 66 mhz ) in total .",
    "the results for @xmath94 for the critical bcsos model are presented in figures 2 to 6 .",
    "the numbers for the @xmath117 s can be obtained from the authors on request .",
    "next we performed the simulations of the ising model at the best known value @xmath118 @xcite for the roughening coupling .",
    "we used the modified cluster algorithm introduced in @xcite . for",
    "a discussion of the algorithm see also ref .",
    "the expectation values for @xmath78 in the neighbourhood of the simulation point are then obtained by re - weighting @xcite .",
    "first of all we had to ensure that our results are not spoiled by a to small extension in z - direction",
    ". obviously the thickness of the lattice has to be large compared to the width of the interface itself .",
    "it turns out that this requirement can be easily fulfilled since the width of the interface at @xmath119 is smaller than 1 for the lattice size we will consider in the following @xcite .",
    "in @xcite the dependence of interface properties on the extension of the lattice in z - direction was carefully checked . for couplings close to @xmath119 and lattice sizes @xmath120 it turned out that for about @xmath121 no dependence on @xmath9 can be detected within the obtained accuracy .",
    "we performed an additional check for @xmath122 .",
    "we compared the interface width without bubbles for @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "we obtain @xmath125 for @xmath123 and @xmath126 for @xmath124 .",
    "the definition of @xmath127 is given below .",
    "therefore we regard the extension @xmath124 which we used throughout in the following simulations as perfectly safe .    per measurement",
    "we performed 5 h - updates and 5 i - updates and in addition one metropolis sweep .",
    "remember that h and i refer to reflections at half - integer and integer z - values respectively .",
    "the number of updates per sweep was again chosen such that the integrated autocorrelation times in units of measurements are smaller than 1 .",
    "the number of measurements was 100000 for most of the lattice sizes . for @xmath128 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 we performed @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 measurements respectively .",
    "the total amount of cpu time used for the ising simulations was about 63 days on an ibm risc system/6000 modell 590 ( 66 mhz ) .      before discussing the results of the matching analysis",
    "let us briefly study the behaviour of the surface width , which was the basis of the monte carlo study of ref .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite a normalized magnetization gradient is defined as @xmath134 \\ ;   , \\ ] ] where @xmath135 is the bulk magnetization and @xmath136 the total magnetization of a z - slize of the lattice .",
    "now the interface width is given by @xmath137 we computed the interface width for the original configurations ( @xmath138 ) and after removing the bubbles ( @xmath127 ) .",
    "in the rough phase of the ising interface or an sos model the surface width behaves like @xmath139 for sufficiently large @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath140 is determined by the point where the rg - trajectory hits the @xmath38 axis in the @xmath141 flow diagram .",
    "therefore the slope of the curve at the roughening transition should be given by @xmath142 .",
    "however it was pointed out in refs . @xcite",
    "that at the roughening transition corrections to this asymptotic behaviour die out proportional to the fugacity ( [ fug ] ) i.e. only proportional to the inverse of the logarithm of @xmath8 .",
    "hence these corrections can not be neglected even for quite large lattice sizes .    to check this anticipated behaviour",
    "we have plotted the surface thickness for the bcsos model and the ising interface with bubbles and bubbles removed in figure [ schichtdicke ] . for comparison",
    "two straight lines with slope @xmath142 are given .",
    "it turns out that even when our largest lattice sizes are considered the slope is by about @xmath143 larger than the asymptotic one . using therefore eq .",
    "( [ width ] ) with the slope @xmath142 as criterion to determine the roughening point leads to a considerable under - estimation of the roughening temperature .",
    "going to enormous lattice sizes such as @xmath144 does not help that much to overcome the problem since the corrections die out only logarithmically in @xmath8 .",
    "for the determination of the roughening temperature and the matching factor using the matching method we have considered the four pairs of observables @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 and @xmath148 . in order to check the effect of removing the bubbles and the improvement by the continuous gaussian model on our results we performed the whole analysis for the following four different choices of the observables : + i ) the bubbles being removed from the bulk phases , using the improved @xmath104 and @xmath108 .",

    "however looking at the results obtained from @xmath70 and @xmath128 makes clear that a major part of the corrections to scaling is eliminated by using @xmath104 and @xmath108 instead of @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",

    "one expects that the bubbles and the overhangs disorder the ising interface compared to the asos model .",
    "hence one expects the roughening transition of the ising interface to occur at a lower temperature as for the asos model and indeed @xmath188 .",
