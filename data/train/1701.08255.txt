    "in a recent letter@xcite , we proposed an idea to achieve a @xmath1-wave superfluid state in an ultracold fermi gas .",
    "this proposal is strongly motivated by the current experimental difficulty that a @xmath1-wave pairing interaction , which is necessary to form @xmath1-wave cooper pairs , also destroys the system before the @xmath1-wave condensate grows@xcite . because of this dilemma , the ordinary approach ( that one cools a @xmath1-wave interacting fermi gas down to the superfluid phase transition temperature ) does not work at all . as a result , although @xmath1-wave feshbach resonances have already been discovered in @xmath4k and @xmath5li fermi gases@xcite , the experimentally accessible superfluid state is still only the simplest @xmath0-wave type@xcite . to demonstrate the usefulness of the cold fermi gas system as a quantum simulator for various quantum many - body phenomena ,",
    "the realization of a @xmath1-wave superfluid fermi gas would be important . since there are various @xmath1-wave fermi superfluids , such as superfluid liquid @xmath6he@xcite , heavy - fermion superconductors@xcite , as well as a neutron condensate in a neutron star@xcite , a @xmath1-wave superfluid fermi gas with a tunable pairing interaction would help further understandings of these unconventional fermi superfluids .",
    "in cold fermi gas physics , it is also interesting to see how the bcs ( bardeen - cooper - schrieffer)-bec ( bose - einstein condensation ) crossover phenomenon discussed in an @xmath0-wave interacting fermi gas@xcite is extended to a @xmath1-wave one@xcite .",
    "the key of our idea@xcite is to _ separately _ prepare a @xmath1-wave cooper - pair amplitude @xmath7 and @xmath1-wave interaction @xmath8 , both physical quantities are involved in the @xmath1-wave superfluid order parameter , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the annihilation operator of a fermi atom with pseudospins @xmath11 , describing atomic hyperfine states contributing to the pair formation .",
    "that is , the @xmath1-wave pair amplitude @xmath12 is first prepared by using an @xmath0-wave superfluid fermi gas with an antisymmetric spin - orbit interaction .",
    "a recent synthetic gauge field technique has realized such a spin - orbit coupling in ultracold atomic gases@xcite . at this stage",
    ", the system does not suffer from the above - mentioned damage caused by a @xmath1-wave interaction , because the system only has an @xmath0-wave interaction .",
    "the @xmath1-wave superfluid fermi gas is then immediately obtained by replacing the @xmath0-wave interaction with an appropriate @xmath1-wave one , where the @xmath1-wave superfluid order parameter @xmath13 in eq .",
    "( [ eq.1.1 ] ) is given by the product of the introduced @xmath1-wave interaction and the @xmath1-wave pair amplitude @xmath12 that has already been produced in the @xmath0-wave superfluid state .",
    "of course , once the @xmath1-wave interaction is turned on , as usual , the system would start to be damaged by the @xmath1-wave interaction .",
    "however , the advantage of this idea is that the @xmath1-wave pair amplitude has been prepared in advance , so that the @xmath1-wave superfluid order parameter discontinuously becomes finite _ immediately _ after the replacement of the @xmath0-wave interaction by the @xmath1-wave one .",
    "then , by definition , the system is in the @xmath1-wave superfluid state , being characterized by this @xmath1-wave superfluid order parameter , at least just after the @xmath1-wave interaction is turned on ( as far as the system damage by the same @xmath1-wave interaction is not serious ) .",
    "we briefly note that the @xmath0-wave superfluid order parameter vanishes , after the @xmath0-wave interaction is turned off .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to clarify when our recent proposal@xcite really gives a @xmath1-wave superfluid state with a large @xmath1-wave superfluid order parameter .",
    "this work is really important to experimentally use this idea , because ref.@xcite also shows that it does _ not _ always work .",
    "that is , under a certain condition , the produced @xmath1-wave superfluid soon vanishes within the time scale being shorter than the typical lifetime ( @xmath14 ms)@xcite of the system by the three - body loss caused by a @xmath1-wave interaction . for our purpose , in this paper , we employ a time - dependent bogoliubov - de gennes ( tdbdg ) theory at @xmath15 , to systematically examine the time evolution of the @xmath1-wave superfluid order parameter @xmath13 under various conditions with respect to the spin - orbit coupling strength , as well as the @xmath0-wave and @xmath1-wave interaction strengths .",
    "we then clarify a key to obtain a large @xmath1-wave superfluid order parameter .",
    "we also explain detailed numerical tdbdg calculations , which was omitted in ref.@xcite .",
    "tdbdg theory can not deal with the three - body particle loss , nor the relaxation of the system to the ground state , because it conserves the particle number , as well as the total energy .",
    "however , this simple approach is still useful for the study of the early stage ( @xmath16 ) of the time evolution of the system , after the replacement of an @xmath0-wave pairing interaction by a @xmath1-wave one . in this paper",

    "iii , we show the time evolution of the @xmath1-wave superfluid order parameter , after the @xmath0-wave pairing interaction is replaced by a @xmath1-wave one , under various conditions .",

    ". however , fig .",
    "[ fig8](b ) shows that this idea actually does not work , because the @xmath49-wave superfluid order parameter vanishes soon after the second manipulation .",

    "we showed that , to obtain a large @xmath49-wave superfluid order parameter in this method , one should prepare the initial spin - orbit coupled @xmath0-wave superfluid fermi gas so that the atomic momentum distribution @xmath219 can be similar to that in the equilibrium @xmath49-wave superfluid state @xmath184 . in the @xmath49-wave weak - coupling regime where the fermi chemical potential @xmath38 in the equilibrium @xmath49-wave superfluid state is positive",

    "the reason for the importance of the atomic momentum distribution in the initial spin - orbit coupled @xmath0-wave supefluid state is that , the overall structure of @xmath199 is passed down to that of non - equilibrium @xmath49-wave superfluid state @xmath184 in the early stage of the time evolution ( @xmath31 ) , where the relaxation effect , as well as the three - body particle loss , are not crucial .    at this stage ,",
    "@xmath0-wave superfluid fermi gases have only been realized in the absence of spin - orbit interaction .",
    "this implies that a spin - orbit interaction is not favorable to achieve the @xmath0-wave superfluid state .",
    "thus , when we use our proposal , we should take a weak spin - orbit interaction , so as not to completely destroy the initial @xmath0-wave superfluid state . in this regard ,",
    "slightly inside the @xmath1-wave weak - coupling regime may be suitable for this purpose , because a relatively large @xmath49-wave superfluid order parameter can be obtained for a weak spin - orbit interaction ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4](a1 ) ) .",
    "then , since the @xmath49-wave superfluid order parameter @xmath127 grows much faster than the typical time scale of the three - body particle loss ( @xmath222 ) , a @xmath49-wave superfluid state would be obtained , at least in the early stage of the time evolution after the @xmath1-wave interaction is turned on .    in this paper , we have only considered the simplest single - component spin - orbit interaction , @xmath223 .",
    "since more complicated spin - orbit interactions , such as a two - component one , also induce different types of @xmath1-wave pair amplitudes@xcite , it is an interesting future problem to see what happens in these cases , after an appropriate @xmath1-wave interaction is switched on .",
    "in addition , although we have simply assumed that the @xmath0-wave interaction is absent when @xmath31 , it may actually remain to some extent , even after an external magnetic field is adjusted to a @xmath1-wave feshbach resonance . in this case ,",
    "the system may possess both the @xmath0-wave and @xmath1-wave superfluid order parameters , at least at @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , inclusions of relaxation effects , as well as effects of three - body particle loss , also remain to be solved .",
    "since all the current experiments toward the realization of a @xmath1-wave superfluid fermi gas are facing the difficulty associated with the short lifetime of the system caused by a @xmath1-wave interaction , our results would provide an alternative route to reach this unconventional fermi superfluid , avoiding this serious problem to some extent .",
