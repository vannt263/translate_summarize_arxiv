    "supernova remnants ( snrs ) are commonly believed to be major sites for the production of galactic cosmic rays .",
    "the diffusive shock acceleration mechanism naturally accounts for the hard power - law production spectra of cosmic rays in their sources , but , as long as the particle injection rate remains an unsolved problem , the theory does not tell us conclusively what fraction of the initial kinetic energy of an explosion can be transferred to cosmic rays ( see e.g. the recent review by @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , it is extremely important to derive the total energy contained in subrelativistic and relativistic particles from observations of the relevant components of nonthermal electromagnetic radiation .",
    "radio synchrotron emission provides information about gev electrons in most shell - type snrs .",
    "synchrotron x - ray emission recently discovered in sn  1006 @xcite and some other shell - type snrs indicates that the electron acceleration continues effectively up to multi - tev energies .",
    "it is believed , however , that the accelerated protons constitute the major fraction of nonthermal energy to which the mechanical energy of a supernova explosion is transferred through shock acceleration .",
    "the best way to explore the proton component of accelerated particles in snrs is the detection of gamma - rays by the decay of @xmath6 mesons produced in collisions between cosmic - ray protons and ambient matter @xcite .",
    "the detection of gamma - rays of hadronic origin from snrs by current and planned space- and ground - based instruments requires high - density environments in or close to the particle - acceleration sites .",
    "large molecular clouds interacting with shells of snrs may act as effective gas targets for the production of @xmath6 mesons and their subsequent decay to high - energy @xmath7-rays @xcite .",
    "it has recently been claimed @xcite that there exists a compelling positional association of the unidentified @xmath7-ray source 3eg j1714@xmath03857 with a dense molecular cloud ( cloud a ) overtaken , most probably , by the shock front of the snr rx  j1713.7@xmath03946 ( g 347.3@xmath00.5 ) .",
    "moreover , it has been argued that the tev gamma - rays from this snr detected by the cangaroo collaboration are also the result of interactions of accelerated protons with nearby dense gas targets @xcite , though @xcite claimed that this interpretation seems to be inconsistent with egret observations of this region .",
    "the flux of the subrelativistic component of the accelerating protons is generally inconclusive both on observational and theoretical grounds , but it is quite possible that this component dominates the total energetics of nonthermal particles .",
    "unfortunately , subrelativistic protons arriving at the earth are not a representative sample of the cosmic - ray flux in the milky way owing to the effect of solar modulation .",
    "ionization losses of these particles play an important role in heating both diffuse neutral gas and molecular clouds , and in generating free electrons in molecular clouds , which are crucial for interstellar chemistry .",
    "it is therefore of great importance to measure the energy released in the form of subrelativistic particles by cosmic - ray accelerators .",
    "the ideal diagnostic tool to probe subrelativistic cosmic rays is the nuclear prompt @xmath7-ray line emission at mev energies @xcite .",
    "however , conservative estimates show that the fluxes of even most prominent @xmath7-ray lines are only marginally detectable because of limited sensitivities of gamma - ray instruments in the mev band . on the other hand ,",
    "as we discuss below , the search for the sites of concentrated subrelativistic protons using bremsstrahlung x - rays could be very promising with the help of superior sensitivities of current x - ray detectors , even though only a small fraction ( @xmath8 ) of the nonthermal energy of subrelativistic protons and electrons is radiated away in the form of bremsstrahlung x - rays .",
    "remarkably , if the subrelativistic cosmic rays reside in a dense gas environment , the ionization losses would result in a significant flattening of the low - energy spectra , and thus leading to the characteristic `` @xmath9 '' type bremsstrahlung x - ray spectrum @xcite .",
    "such an unusually hard x - ray spectrum may serve as a distinct signature of nonthermal bremsstrahlung origin of x - ray emission .    in our previous paper @xcite we reported on the detection of hard x - rays from a localized region in the snr @xmath7  cygni , which we attributed to @xmath9 bremsstrahlung from the loss - flattened electron distribution . in this paper",
    "we present a more pronounced example of such hard x - radiation arriving from a massive cloud in the vicinity of snr rx  j1713.7@xmath03946 .",
    "the shell - type snr rx  j1713.7@xmath03946 ( g 347.3@xmath00.5 ) , which has an angular radius of about @xmath10 , was first discovered during the rosat all - sky survey @xcite .",
    "the detection of synchrotron x - ray emission with asca @xcite revealed that the remnant s shell is a presently operating source of multi - tev electrons , which are responsible for the synchrotron x - rays .",
    "moreover , the tev @xmath7-rays detected by the cangaroo collaboration from this supernova remnant @xcite provide direct evidence of the acceleration of particles ",
    "electrons and/or protons  to energies well beyond 10 tev .",
    "this snr is very faint at radio wavelengths .",
    "based on a lack of thermal x - ray emission , the supernova shock is considered to be expanding in a low - density environment , such as a stellar - wind cavity @xcite .    the distance @xmath11 , age @xmath12 , and the explosion energy @xmath13 erg are three important parameters for understanding the origin of nonthermal radiation components . at the perimeter of rx",
    "j1713.7@xmath03946 , there is a dense ( @xmath14  @xmath15 ) molecular cloud ( cloud  a ) that seems to have a very high ratio of two rotational transition lines of co molecules , co(@xmath16=21)/co(@xmath16=10 ) .",
    "this suggests an interaction between cloud  a and the snr rx  j1713.7@xmath03946 @xcite .",
    "the distance to cloud a ( @xmath17= @xmath094 km s@xmath3 ) was kinematically estimated to be @xmath18 kpc by using the standard galactic rotation curve @xcite .",
    "thus , if the molecular cloud and the supernova remnant are indeed _ physically _ associated , the distance to rx  j1713.7@xmath03946 could be significantly larger than the original estimate of about 1 kpc based on an absorbing column - density value @xcite . for the preferred distance to the source of about 6 kpc , a reasonable set of the age and the explosion energy of rx",
    "j1713.7@xmath03946 is in the ranges 1870040600 yr and @xmath192.21.7 @xcite .",
    "however , a different solution of a distance @xmath20 , with the remnant s age of 21003400 yr and the sn explosion energy of @xmath191.42.2 , can not be ruled out . the smaller distance and correspondingly younger remnant agree better with the hypothesis of @xcite who argued that rx  j1713.7@xmath03946 could be a likely counterpart of the guest star of 393  a.d . in the constellation scorpius .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)fig1_a.eps ( 80mm,80mm)fig1_b.eps    the snr rx  j1713.7@xmath03946 was partially observed with the asca satellite on 1996 september , and most of the remnant was covered on 1997 march .",
    "the data were screened by standard procedures , except that strict rise - time screening was not applied to the data taken on 1997 march .",
    "below we present the results from the gas imaging spectrometer ( gis ) by adding two identical detectors ( gis  2 and gis  3 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : ximage ] shows the x - ray images of the snr rx  j1713.7@xmath03946 in the soft 13 kev and hard 510 kev energy bands . after subtracting the instrumental background and correcting vignetting effect ,",
    "images are smoothed with a gaussian of standard deviation of @xmath21 and @xmath22 for the soft and hard band , respectively . as it has been noted by previous studies @xcite ,",
    "shell - like synchrotron x - ray images ( region 24 ) are seen in both energy bands .",
    "in addition to region 24 , the hard - band image clearly shows the existence of an extended source ( region 1 ) being coincident with cloud  a , although it is barely seen in the soft band because of diffuse x - ray emission along the galactic plane .",
    "approximate center of this new source is at a celestial coordinate ( j2000 ) of r.a.=@xmath23 and decl.=@xmath24 .",
    "we thus refer to this source as ax  j1714.1@xmath03912 .",
    "the count rate in the 510 kev band of ax  j1714.1@xmath03912 is 0.029 c  s@xmath3 , which corresponds to a 34  @xmath25 statistical significance in excess of the background in this region .",
    "the total number of source photons detected in the 110 kev band is derived to be 3340 .",
    "unfortunately , the source lies very near to the edge of the observed field .",
    "it is therefore difficult to determine any extent of the source , which is distorted by the off - axis broad point spread function of the telescope .",

    "we have discovered a new x - ray source , ax  j1714.1@xmath03912 , with an extent of @xmath49 , characterized by an extremely flat power - law with @xmath1 .",
    "the luminosity of the source is estimated to be @xmath50 erg  s@xmath3 , where @xmath51 is the distance to the source normalized to 6 kpc .",
    "since the luminosity increases linearly with a high - energy cutoff for the @xmath52 type spectrum , the above estimate should be considered as a lower limit for the luminosity .",
    "it can not be the radiation of thermal gas , unless we assume an extremely hot optically thin plasma with a temperature significantly exceeding 10 kev . since the formation of such a thermal source seems to be quite problematic , given its extended character , below we assume that the x - radiation has a nonthermal origin .",
    "ax  j1714.1@xmath03912 has a good spatial association with cloud a ( see figure  [ fig : ximage ] ) . in the following discussion , therefore , we assume that the x - ray emission actually comes from cloud a. if so , this would be a new striking nonthermal phenomenon in molecular clouds .    nonthermal particles that are illuminating cloud a in the x - ray band could be supplied by either internal or external accelerators .",
    "a potential candidate for an external accelerator is the strong shock of snr rx  j1713.7@xmath03946 , which is likely to interact with cloud  a , as evidenced by a very high ratio of co(@xmath16=21)/co(@xmath16=10 ) @xcite .",
    "the particles can be accelerated in the shell of rx  j1713.7@xmath03946 and afterwards enter cloud  a , given that the shell is a certain site of particle acceleration , which follows from synchrotron x - ray emissions .",
    "it is possible that particle acceleration also takes place at the secondary shocks inside ( or in the vicinity of ) cloud  a initiated by the main shock of the snr .",
    "finally , if there is no _ physical _ link between cloud  a and snr rx  j1713.7@xmath03946 , this would imply the existence of unseen internal accelerators inside the molecular cloud .",
    "although we can not exclude any of these possibilities , the preferred option seems to be the `` cloud interacting with snr '' scenario .",
    "formally , there are also several options for the nonthermal x - ray production mechanisms : synchrotron radiation , inverse compton ( ic ) scattering , and electron and/or proton bremsstrahlung .",
    "however , here more definite conclusions can be drawn .",
    "synchrotron x - ray emission by multi - tev electrons could not explain the flat x - ray spectrum . because of the fast synchrotron cooling on a timescale of @xmath53 yr ( for a magnetic field of @xmath54 g typical in molecular clouds ) , the photon index of the synchrotron spectrum at x - ray energies becomes @xmath55 , where @xmath56 22.2 is the electron acceleration index .",
    "thus , the differential spectrum of synchrotron x - radiation can not be flatter than @xmath57 . note that the power - law fits of the x - ray spectra of regions 24 ( @xmath30 2.12.3 ) agree with the synchrotron origin of x - rays from these regions .",
    "inverse compton scattering is precluded by low brightness of synchrotron radio emission .",
    "relatively low - energy ( gev ) electrons that produce x - rays via scattering off the cosmic microwave background photons , also emit synchrotron radiation at radio frequencies .",
    "thus , assuming that the x - ray flux is due to ic scattering , we can calculate the radio flux density of the associated synchrotron emission . for a magnetic field of @xmath54 g the latter",
    "is expected at a level of @xmath58 jy at 843 mhz , which is higher , by three orders of magnitudes , than the upper limit on the radio flux from the direction of cloud a @xcite .",
    "therefore , we can safely exclude the ic origin of the observed x - radiation .",
    "x - rays can be produced through the bremsstrahlung of nonthermal electrons and/or protons interacting with the cloud gas .",
    "the energy distribution , for either accelerated protons or electrons within the cloud , is characterized by the position of the break energy , @xmath60 , which is set by equating the lifetime against the ionization losses and the age of the accelerator , @xmath61 . at energies below @xmath60 , for which @xmath62 ,",
    "the particle distribution becomes `` loss - flattened '' due to ionization losses @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the bremsstrahlung spectrum obey a characteristic energy distribution close to @xmath63 , provided that the energy spectrum of the subrelativistic particles becomes harder than @xmath64 .",
    "almost independent of the details of the acceleration spectrum , this criterion could be satisfied by the loss - flattened distribution below @xmath60 , which is controlled by the density of the cloud @xmath65 and the source age @xmath66 . for @xmath67 and @xmath68 yr",
    ", the break appears at @xmath69 mev in the proton distribution , and correspondingly at @xmath70 kev in the proton bremsstrahlung spectrum . on the other hand ,",
    "the breaks are @xmath71 mev for electrons . at photon energies anywhere below @xmath72 , the characteristic",
    "@xmath9 power - law is predicted .",
    "note that the @xmath9 bremsstrahlung photons below @xmath72 are produced predominantly by particles in a narrow energy interval around @xmath60 .",
    "the spectral shape of the flat x - ray spectrum of ax  j1714.1@xmath03912 agrees perfectly with the @xmath9 emission of either proton bremsstrahlung ( pb ) or electron bremsstrahlung ( eb ) from the loss - flattened distribution .    whereas the pb and eb mechanisms are expected to give rise to the same @xmath9 x - ray spectrum , the pb luminosity peaks at ( hard ) x - rays and the eb peaks at gamma - rays for typical parameters . in the case of the @xmath9 eb emission ,",
    "the photon flux per each logarithmic interval in photon energy anywhere up to @xmath73 mev is constant .",
    "then , the observed x - ray flux of @xmath74 photon @xmath75 s@xmath3 in the 110 kev band implies that the 110 mev flux should be comparable to the crab .",
    "this is inconsistent with non - detection by the comptel instrument @xcite onboard the compton gamma ray observatory . moreover ,",
    "unless we introduce a sharp cutoff in the electron distribution at an energy of around 100 mev , the eb model overshoots the @xmath7-ray flux reported by the egret instrument .",
    "therefore , we may conclude that the gamma - ray data favor proton bremsstrahlung , rather than the electron bremsstrahlung scenario .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of the @xmath9 bremsstrahlung emission of either protons or electrons can be estimated as @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the total amount of kinetic energy contained in x - ray emitting particles , @xmath66 is the age of the source ( accelerator ) , and @xmath78 . here , we take into account that the bulk of x - rays are produced by particles from the break region , thus @xmath79 . for the parameters chosen above , @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "these factors demonstrate the low efficiency of the bremsstrahlung mechanism relative to the ionization losses , implying a huge , @xmath82 erg  s@xmath3 and @xmath83 erg  s@xmath3 , injection power in protons and electrons , respectively .",
    "correspondingly , the total amounts of energy released during operation of the accelerator are @xmath84 erg and @xmath85 erg .",
    "if the particles are accelerated in the shell of snr rx  j1713.7@xmath03946 , and only a relatively small ( 10% or so ) fraction of these particles enter cloud a , the total kinetic energy , which is transferred to subrelativistic protons , should be at least @xmath5 erg ; the electron bremsstrahlung model alleviates the total energy by a factor of about 3 .",
    "given the limited energy budget of a supernova shock of about @xmath5 erg , we face a serious problem to support the required x - ray luminosity , unless the system is closer to the earth than estimated by the radial velocity of cloud a. for example , a distance of 2 kpc would reduce the energy requirement to a quite comfortable level of @xmath86 erg . several other scenarios may be invoked to overcome the energy budget problem .",
    "the simplest assumption would be that the explosion energy significantly exceeds @xmath5 erg , and that more than 10% of this energy is released in the form of subrelativistic particles .",
    "it is also possible that the nonthermal particles are accelerated inside the cloud , e.g. by the shock initiated at the collision of the blast wave of rx  j1713.7@xmath03946 with cloud a @xcite .",
    "finally , we may speculate that the essential part of the energy which goes into the ionization and heating of gas , and also the excitation of plasma waves , is returned to subrelativistic protons through acceleration on these plasma waves .",
    "apparently , all of these assumptions need detailed quantitative studies .",
    "ax  j1714.1@xmath03912 and cloud a are located within the error box of the unidentified @xmath7-ray source 3eg j1714@xmath03857 @xcite .",
    "the gev @xmath7-ray flux may be explained by @xmath6 gamma - rays by collisions between the shock - accelerated protons and cloud  a. @xcite argued that an electron - bremsstrahlung origin for the gev flux is less likely because of the faint synchrotron radio emission of cloud  a. the total energy liberated in @xmath7-rays through the decay of neutral pions is roughly estimated to be @xmath87 where @xmath88 mb is the proton  proton inelastic cross - section , and @xmath89 is the energy content in gev protons , within cloud  a. the egret luminosity , @xmath90 erg  s@xmath3 , corresponds to @xmath91 erg .",
    "thus , with the proton - bremsstrahlung model for ax  j1714.1@xmath03912 , the energy content in subrelativistic protons far exceeds that in relativistic protons , @xmath92 . in this case",
    ", it would appear that the acceleration / injection mechanisms allow a small fraction of protons to be accelerated to relativistic energies . another possibility could be that the bulk of accelerated relativistic protons have already diffused away , while the subrelativistic protons are still being captured within the molecular cloud ."
