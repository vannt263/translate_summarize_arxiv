    "the design of inertial confinement fusion ( icf ) targets and the interpretation of icf experiments rely on numerical simulations based on hydrodynamic lagrangian codes where kinetic effects are only considered as corrections included in the transport coefficients @xcite . in particular , ion thermal conduction is treated approximately , at best through spitzer - braginskii local formulae @xcite , and non - maxwellian features in the ion velocity distributions are always neglected .",
    "ion viscosity effects are also usually not taken into account , in favor of numerical ( `` pseudo '' ) viscosity .",
    "this may have an impact on the modeling of shock waves that propagate throughout the capsule during implosion @xcite , especially as the shock wave is reflected from the hot spot center .",
    "more precisely , the fluid description is relevant if the mean free path of plasma particles , namely electrons and ions , is smaller than the characteristic length scale .",
    "although this condition is reasonably fulfilled during the implosion stage for thermal deuterium and tritium ( d , t ) ions , it does not apply to fast particles , in particular to fusion products -suprathermal @xmath0-particles- near the ignition threshold and during the combustion phase .",
    "indeed , it is known @xcite that the density of the central hot spot is such that the mean free path @xmath1 of fast @xmath0-particles is roughly equal to the hot spot radius @xmath2 .    nevertheless , in all present - day fluid codes , multi - group flux limited diffusion schemes @xcite are usually employed to model suprathermal @xmath0-particles .",
    "this kind of methods , although computationally efficient , relies on the assumption that the fast particle mean free path is smaller than the characteristic scale length of the energy deposition zone .",
    "since this hypothesis does not hold for energetic particles in a typical icf target , diffusion methods may not calculate the energy and momentum deposition associated to fast fusion products accurately .",
    "this may have significant consequences on the modeling of the ignition and combustion phases .",
    "moreover , the _ coupling _ between suprathermal particles and the thermal bulk is usually treated in a rough manner in fluid models , by removing the suprathermal particles that are slowed down below a given energy threshold and injecting the removed particles in the thermal bulk .",
    "therefore , the thermalization process is not described with sufficient precision .",
    "those approximations may also influence the calculation of ignition thresholds and energy gains .    in this work",
    ", we present a full ion - kinetic modeling of suprathermal fusion products , treated self - consistently with the ion - kinetic modeling of the thermal imploding plasma .",
    "the difficulty lies in the coupling of ion populations characterized by two different energy scales : thermal @xmath3,@xmath4 ions , which form the bulk of the imploding plasma and whose kinetic energy is in the kev range , are coupled to suprathermal @xmath0-particles , created at 3.52 mev by fusion reactions .    to overcome the difficulty associated to the high energy contrast , we develop a _ two - energy - scale approach _ in which we consider the @xmath0 distribution function as a set of two components ( ( namely a suprathermal and a thermal one ) evolving on two well distinguished characteristic velocity scales .",
    "we show that it is possible to rearrange the terms of the fokker - planck equation governing the evolution of fast fusion products , in such a way that that the collision operator is recast into a _ system _ coupling two _ components _ associated to the @xmath0 distribution function .",
    "each component is associated to a particular velocity scale .",
    "this strategy enables us to design tractable numerical methods , which have been employed to build a new ion kinetic code fuse ( for _ fpion upgrade with two scales of energy _ )",
    "@xcite , built as an extension of the former code fpion @xcite . note that existing ion kinetic codes can only describe the implosion of dt targets in sub - ignition conditions @xcite .",
    "besides , the energy released from fusion reactions is not accounted for in a self - consistent manner .    a new computationally efficient approach developed recently @xcite enables us to thoroughly study ion kinetic effects during implosion , ignition and combustion stages of real icf target configurations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec.[sec : theory ] , we describe the theoretical model applied to the dt fuel .",
    "we present a hybrid electron fluid - ion kinetic model .",
    "first , we develop the vlasov - fokker - planck ( vfp ) formalism for thermal species . then",
    ", we extend the ion kinetic modeling to suprathermal @xmath0-particles produced by fusion reactions . a physical analysis of the slowing down process shows how the _ two - component _ nature of the @xmath0 distribution function builds up .",
    "we then present an original two - velocity - scale decomposition of the fokker planck operator related to @xmath0-particles .",
    "in particular , we explain how to accurately treat the coupling between the suprathermal particles and the thermal bulk .",
    "then , in sec.[sec : application ] , we compare a full ion kinetic simulation of a realistic icf configuration with the fluid calculation , during the implosion , ignition and combustion processes .",
    "more precisely , we consider a baseline 1d ( fci1 ) spherical fluid calculation of a typical icf target .",
    "we then start a full ion kinetic calculation carried out with our code fuse on the same design considered 1 ns before stagnation .",
    "this approach allows us to lay the emphasis on ion kinetic effects , especially during the end of the implosion process , as well as during the birth of the burn front and its subsequent propagation through the dense fuel shell .",
    "to develop a numerically tractable strategy to describe thermal species and energetic particles at a kinetic level , we go back to the underlying physical model described by the vlasov fokker planck equations applied to the dt fusion plasma considered in typical icf conditions .",
    "the dt fuel is modeled by an hybrid electron - fluid / ion - kinetic approach @xcite .",
    "the model is relevant since the characteristic time of the considered problem is close to the ion - ion collision time @xmath5 , which is significantly greater than the electron equilibrium time @xmath6 .",

    "<S> in this article , we study the hydrodynamics and burn of the thermonuclear fuel in inertial confinement fusion pellets at the ion kinetic level . the analysis is based on a two - velocity - scale vlasov - fokker - planck kinetic model that is specially tailored to treat fusion products ( suprathermal @xmath0-particles ) in a self - consistent manner with the thermal bulk . </S>",
    "<S> the model assumes spherical symmetry in configuration space and axial symmetry in velocity space around the mean flow velocity . </S>",
    "<S> compared to fluid simulations where a multi - group diffusion scheme is applied to model @xmath0 transport , the full ion - kinetic approach reveals significant non - local effects on the transport of energetic @xmath0-particles . </S>",
    "<S> this has a direct impact on hydrodynamic spatial profiles during combustion : the hot spot reactivity is reduced , while the inner dense fuel layers are preheated by the escaping @xmath0-suprathermal particles , which are transported farther out of the hot spot . </S>",
    "<S> we show how the kinetic transport enhancement of fusion products leads to a significant reduction of the fusion yield </S>",
