    "since it is our second paper of the series , following the one on the double - well potential @xcite , it does not need an extensive introduction .",
    "topological solitons , instantons in particular , are widely used in the context of quantum field theories and condense matter physics .",
    "their relation to standard perturbative series is an old issue , which continues to produce interesting results , so far mostly in quantum mechanical context .",
    "the sine - gordon ( sg ) field theory has been extensively studied in classical context , with an enormous literature dedicated to it , see e.g. @xcite and references therein .",
    "coleman @xcite has extended the results to the quantized theory by relating the sg field theory to the zero - charge sector of the massive thirring model . also in @xcite the explicit calculations for the tunneling amplitude using the so - called nonvacuum instantons at finite energy were presented .",
    "the quantum mechanical sg potential ( the mathieu potential ) is the basic element of condense matter theory . tunneling from one minimum to the next , in the path integral formulation ,",
    "is described by euclidean classical paths  the instantons .",
    "the issues we discuss in this paper deal with quantum fluctuations around these paths .",
    "we would like to demonstrate by an explicit calculation how our tools work in this  well controlled and studied setting before applying them to more complicated / realistic settings in quantum field theory .",
    "therefore we do @xmath0 use anything stemming from the schrdinger equation in this work , in particularly do not use series resulting from recurrence relations or resurgence relations ( in general , conjectured ) by several authors .",
    "one reason to study sg is to explore further the existing deep connections between the quantum mechanical instantons  via schrdinger equation  with wider mathematical issues , of approximate solutions to differential equations , defined in terms of certain generalized series .",
    "a particular form of an exact quantization condition was _ conjectured _ by j.  zinn - justin @xcite , which links series around the instanton , instanton / anti - instanton sectors with the usual perturbative series in the perturbative vacuum .",
    "it remains unknown whether it can or can not be generalized to the field theory cases we are mainly interested in .",
    "recently , for the quartic double well and sine - gordon potentials dunne and nsal ( see @xcite and also references therein ) have presented more arguments for this connection and made it more precise , which they call _ resurgent relation _ between perturbative and instanton sectors .",
    "another reason for which we decided to do this work is a certain set of observations about feynman diagrams on top of the instanton for the double well potential with degenerate minima we observed in our first paper @xcite .",
    "we wanted to see how general they are , using another example , now with infinitely many degenerate minima .",
    "the sg potential also has new vertices and thus many new diagrams . as we will show below ,",
    "indeed all these trends repeat themselves in this second setting as well .",
    "few comments on the history of present approach .",
    "omitting well known classic papers on instanton calculus we mention a pioneering paper @xcite , where the two - loop correction to the tunneling amplitude for the sg was calculated .",
    "in particular , the formalism for treating the zero - mode singularities was described in detail .",
    "let us consider the quantum - mechanical problem of a particle of mass @xmath1 in the sine - gordon potential @xmath2       \\ .\\ ] ] the well - known instanton solution @xmath3 describes the tunneling between adjacent minima by the euclidean classical path with the action @xmath4=\\frac{8}{g^2}$ ] .",
    "our notation for the coupling is related to those used in @xcite by @xmath5 .",
    "the classical action @xmath6 of the instanton solution is therefore large and @xmath7 is used in the expansion .",
    "the sg potential has an infinite number of degenerate minima , and perturbative levels in them form a continuous band , with states within the band labeled by bloch angular parameter @xmath8 .",
    "the energy of the lowest band is    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the naive ground state energy , without tunneling , written as the following expansion @xmath11 while @xmath12 generates another series , related to the so called instanton density @xmath13 here @xmath14 is the well - known one - loop semiclassical result @xcite .",
    "coefficients @xmath15 in the series ( [ e0 ] ) can be calculated using the ordinary perturbation theory ( see @xcite ) while many coefficients @xmath16 in the expansion ( [ dele0 ] ) were found by j.  zinn - justin and collaborators , 1981 - 2005 ( see @xcite and references therein ) , obtained via the so called _ exact bohr - sommerfeld quantization condition_. it was remarkably refined by dunne - nsal @xcite in the formalism of the so - called resurgent trans - series .    alternatively , using the feynman diagrams technique lowe and stone @xcite calculated the two - loop correction @xmath17",
    "which was later on reproduced in @xcite in the so - called _ exact bohr - sommerfeld quantization _ technique .",
    "higher order coefficients @xmath16 in ( [ dele0 ] ) can also be computed in this way .",
    "since we calculate the energy difference , all feynman diagrams in the instanton background ( with the instanton - based vertices and the green s function ) need to be accompanied by subtraction of the same diagrams for the trivial @xmath18 saddle point ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "for @xmath19 it permits to evaluate the ratio @xmath20 where the matrix elements @xmath21 are calculated using the instanton - based green s function and the green function of the harmonic oscillator , respectively .    the instanton - based green s function @xmath22 form to be used @xmath23 \\ , \\label{gf } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is expressed in variables @xmath24 , in which the familiar green function @xmath25 of the harmonic oscillator is @xmath26 in its derivation there were two steps .",
    "one was to find a function which satisfies the green function equation , used via two linearly - independent solutions and standard wronskian method .",
    "the second step is related to a zero mode : one can add a term @xmath27 with any coefficient and still satisfy the equation .",
    "the coefficient is then fixed from orthogonality to the zero mode .",
    "the two - loop coefficient in ( [ dele0 ] ) is @xcite @xmath28 @xmath29 reflecting the contribution of four feynman diagrams , see fig .",
    "[ f1 ] .",
    "the three - loop correction @xmath30 ( [ dele0 ] ) we are interested in is given by the sum of twenty - two 3-loop feynman diagrams , which we group as follows ( see figs .",
    "[ f2 ] - [ f3 ] ) @xmath31 complementing by a contribution from two - loop feynman diagrams , see fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , @xmath32 ( see ( [ b1 ] ) ) .    the rules of constructing the integrals for each diagram should be clear from an example : the explicit expression for the feynman integral @xmath33 in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , which is @xmath34    while for @xmath35 in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] it takes the form @xmath36 here we introduced notations @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "notice that the @xmath39 's diagrams come from the jacobian of the zero mode and have no analogs in the perturbative vacuum problem .",
    "for calculation of the symmetry factors for a given feynman s diagram we use the wick s theorem and contractions , see e.g @xcite .",
    "it can be illustrated by the next two examples .",
    "for diagram @xmath40 the three bubbles can be rearranged in @xmath41 ways and each propagator , which starts and ends at the same vertex forming loop , contributes with a factor of two giving a symmetry factor of @xmath42 . for the diagram @xmath43 with no bubbles the three propagators which connect the same pair of vertices can be rearranged in @xmath44 ways only .",
    "the obtained results are summarized in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "all diagrams are of the form of one - dimensional , two - dimensional , three - dimensional and four - dimensional integrals .",
    "the five diagrams @xmath45 , in particular ( see fig .",
    "[ f2 ] ) @xmath46 correspond to two - dimensional integrals and together with diagram @xmath40 , a one - dimensional integral , are the only ones which we are able to calculate analytically @xmath47 here @xmath48 denotes the riemann zeta function of argument @xmath49 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "diagrams @xmath50 contain a rational and an irrational contribution such that @xmath51 it shows that for diagrams @xmath52 and @xmath53 the rational contribution is three times larger than the irrational part . in the case of the dw potential",
    "the situation is opposite , the irrational part is dominant ( see @xcite ) .",
    "other diagrams , see table i , were evaluated numerically with an absolute accuracy @xmath54 .",
    "surprisingly , almost all of them ( 20 diagrams out of 22 ones in total ) are of order @xmath55 as for @xmath30 itself with two of them ( diagrams @xmath56 ) which are of order @xmath57 .    dunne - nsal ( see @xcite and references therein ) reports a value of @xmath58 while present calculation shows that @xmath59 which is in agreement , up to the precision employed in the numerical integration .",
    "similarly to the two - loop correction @xmath60 the coefficient @xmath30 is negative .",
    "for not - so - large barriers ( @xmath61 ) , the two - loop and three - loop corrections are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "the dominant contribution comes from the sum of the two - vertex diagrams @xmath62 while the four - vertex diagrams @xmath63 provides minor contribution , the absolute value of their sum represents less than @xmath64 of the total correction @xmath30 .",
    "interestingly for both two and three loop cases the largest contribution comes from the ears-like diagrams @xmath65 and @xmath53 , respectively , @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "we already noted that individual three - loop diagrams contain irrational numbers . since the dunne - nsal s result is a rational number , then there must be a cancelation of these irrational contributions in the sum ( [ b2 ] ) . from ( [ b11 ] )",
    "we note that the term @xmath68 gives a contribution of order one to the mentioned sum ( [ b2 ] ) , and therefore the coincidence in the order of @xmath69 between present result ( [ b2o ] ) and one of dunne - nsal ( [ b2z ] ) is an indication that such a cancelation occurs .",
    "now , we evaluate the coefficients @xmath70 , @xmath71 in ( [ e0 ] ) using feynman diagrams ( see @xcite ) . in order to do it",
    "let us consider the sine - gordon potential @xmath72   $ ] and calculate the transition amplitude @xmath73 .",
    "all involved feynman integrals can be evaluated analytically . in the limit",
    "@xmath74 the coefficients of order @xmath75 and @xmath76 in front of @xmath77 gives us the value of @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "as it was mentioned above the @xmath39 's diagrams do not exist in this case .",
    "the feynman integral @xmath65 in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] give us the value of @xmath70 , explicitly it is equal to @xmath78 the diagrams @xmath79 and @xmath40 in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] determine @xmath71 , @xmath80 @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "then @xmath83 which is in agreement with the results obtained in standard multiplicative perturbation theory ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "no irrational numbers appear in the evaluation of @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    ".contribution of each diagram in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] - [ f3 ] for the three - loop correction @xmath30 with symmetry factor included .",
    "we write @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 denote the sum of two - dimensional , three - dimensional and four - dimensional integrals , respectively .",
    "the term @xmath87 ( see text ) . [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "in conclusion , we have calculated the tunneling amplitude ( level splitting related to the instanton density ) up to three - loops using feynman diagrams for quantum perturbations on top of the instanton .",
    "summing all of these contributions we obtain the third coefficients @xmath30 ( defined in ( [ dele0 ] ) ) .",
    "the result  to the numerical accuracy we kept  is found to be in good agreement with the resurgent relation between perturbative and instanton series suggested by j.  zinn - justin and collaborators , and dunne - nsal ( for modern reference see @xcite ) .",
    "let us remind again , that this paper is methodical in nature , and its task was to develop tools to calculate tunneling phenomena in multidimensional qm or qft context , in which any results stemming from the schrdinger equation are not available .",
    "we use a quantum mechanical example as a test of the tools we use : but the tools themselves are expected to work in much wider context .",
    "when we started these works ( see @xcite ) we , naively , expected to see some correspondence between vacuum and instanton series on the level of individual feynman diagrams .",
    "however , no such trend has been detected so far .",
    "furthermore ,  new \" diagrams originating from the instanton zero mode jacobian , surprisingly , provide the significant contribution @xmath88 to the two - loop correction @xmath60 ( one diagram out of four , see fig.1 ) and @xmath89 to the three - loop correction @xmath30 ( seven diagrams out of 22 , see figs.2 - 3 ) , see table i , both for 2-loop and 3-loop contributions , both for the double well @xcite and sg problems . in the double well case",
    "@xcite the  new \" individual diagrams @xmath39 and @xmath90 give the dominant contribution ( @xmath91 and @xmath92 ) to the overall loop coefficients @xmath60 and @xmath30 out of 4 and out of 18 diagrams , respectively , while in the sg case they give significant contributions @xmath93 and @xmath94 out of 4 and out of 22 diagrams , respectively .",
    "however , the corresponding @xmath90-like four - loop diagram in the sg case represents the @xmath95 of the four - loop correction @xmath96 only .",
    "we calculated @xmath97-like three- , four- , five - loop diagrams ( see fig . 3 for 3-loop case and _",
    "note added _ as of nov.1 , 2015 , see below ) : this single tadpole diagram gives @xmath98 , @xmath88 and @xmath99 contribution for three- , four- , five - loop cases , respectively .",
    "it is quite amusing that in three - loop case the sum of @xmath97 and @xmath100 diagrams gives @xmath101 .",
    "it implies that the sum of remaining 20 diagrams is almost zero !",
    "another observation is that the final three - loops answer has a rational value .",
    "however , unlike the evaluation of the two - loop coefficient @xmath60 where all feynman diagrams turned out to be rational numbers , in our case of @xmath30 at least two diagrams contain irrational parts . what is the origin of these terms and how they cancel out among themselves are questions left unanswered above , since several diagrams had resisted our efforts to get the analytic answer , so that we used numerical multidimensional integration methods , in particular , a dynamical partitioning @xcite",
    "perhaps , this can still be improved .    similar calculations for",
    "scalar and eventually gauge theories would be certainly possible and are of obvious interest .",
    "the diagrams are the same , and the basic element remains explicit green functions .",
