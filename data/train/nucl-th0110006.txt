    "[ sec : intro ] the study of the low energy structure of the nucleon via compton scattering @xmath0 has a long history . for a proton target ,",
    "one is tempted to obtain a good description of the resulting cross section up to photon energies of about @xmath1 by assuming that one scatters off a positively charged point - like spin 1/2 particle with an additional ( pauli ) anomalous magnetic moment of @xmath2 nuclear magnetons . for higher photon energies ,",
    "this simple picture breaks down as more details of the complicated internal structure of the nucleon become visible to the electro - magnetic probe . even at low energies",
    "the description can be improved by noting that there are additional effects due to the target structure which turn out to be nearly as large as the magnetic moment terms .",
    "it has been argued ( see e.g.  @xcite ) that to first order one can take these effects into account via an effective hamiltonian ansatz @xmath3 where @xmath4 constitutes the electric ( magnetic ) polarisability of the nucleon in response to an external electric ( magnetic ) field @xmath5 generated by the incoming and outgoing photon . in the past few decades , a lot of effort has been invested to determine these fundamental structure parameters of the nucleon .",
    "the most recent global analysis of the world data for the proton @xcite gives @xmath6 whereas the neutron polarisabilities are less well determined , with sometimes conflicting experiments , see e.g.  recently @xcite and references in  @xcite @xmath7\\times 10^{-4}\\;{\\mathrm{fm}}^3\\nonumber\\\\     \\bar{\\beta}_n&=&[1.2\\dots14]\\times 10^{-4}\\;{\\mathrm{fm}}^3\\;\\;. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , we do not want to comment on the accuracy , error bars or inherent problems of the neutron measurements . rather , we want to point out that the numbers displayed in ( [ eq : globala]/[eq : globalb ] ) attempt to describe the nucleon s response to a _ static _ external electro - magnetic @xmath8 field , which in the language of nucleon compton scattering corresponds to the limit that the energy of the incoming photon goes to zero .",
    "obviously , the experiments from which the numbers of ( [ eq : globala ] ) have been derived were not performed at zero energy as there is hardly any sensitivity to the polarisabilities in this kinematic regime .",
    "in fact , most of the recent proton compton scattering experiments were performed with @xmath9 to @xmath10 photons @xcite and thus had to rely on additional , theoretical input to relate the results to zero energy parameters .",
    "in other words , one needs to know the _ energy dependence _ of the various nucleon structure parameters in order to extract static nucleon properties . for photon energies below the two pion production threshold ,",
    "the most convenient way to take these effects into account is the use of dispersion theory .",
    "its starting point is a dispersion relation for each of the six invariant amplitudes governing spin 1/2 compton scattering .",
    "the static polarisabilities defined at zero energy can then be related to a subtraction constant of such a ( subtracted ) dispersion relation , whereas the energy dependent effects are subsumed into the integral over the photo - absorption cross sections @xmath11 .",
    "given that there is enough experimental information on the required inelastic cross sections , one can then calculate differential cross sections for nucleon compton scattering and finally fit the unknown subtraction constants ( namely the polarisabilities ) to reproduce the measured compton cross sections .",
    "details on the use of subtracted and unsubtracted dispersion relations in the analysis of medium energy nucleon compton scattering can be found in  @xcite . here , we only want to remind the reader that even in the usual extraction of the static polarisabilities , the correct treatment of the energy dependent effects is crucial . in the following , we argue that this energy dependence is not just a dirty side - effect to be subsumed into a dispersion integral , but that the effect is interesting in its own right , leading to a better understanding of the degrees of freedom which rule the electric and magnetic properties of the nucleon .",
    "the article is organised as follows : in the next section , we discuss a multipole expansion for the nucleon amplitudes of compton scattering which also serves as point of reference for a discussion of the energy dependent effects expected in nucleons at the end of the same section .",
    "section  [ sec : matching ] shows how to extract the dynamical polarisabilities from given compton amplitudes .",
    "we then exemplify our method by calculating the leading one loop order heavy baryon chiral perturbation prediction for the electric and magnetic dipole and quadrupole polarisabilities ( sect .",
    "[ sec : example ] ) . before",
    "concluding by summarising and discussing our findings , we give an outlook on possible implications of our results on the extraction of nucleon polarisabilities from compton scattering off the deuteron in sect .",

    "[ sec : multipole ] the @xmath12 matrix of nucleon compton scattering can be written in terms of six amplitudes @xmath13 . in the following",

    "thus , @xmath14 denotes the cm energy of a real photon scattering under the cm angle @xmath15 off the nucleon , with @xmath16 .",
    "polarisabilities are designed to be a measure of the excitation spectrum of a system , but low energy compton scattering off the proton is dominated by born terms , i.e.  by the successive interactions of two photons with a point - like nucleon with charge q and anomalous magnetic moment @xmath17 .",
    "it is therefore customary to subtract these `` nucleon pole '' effects from the six compton amplitudes and only analyse the remainder in terms of polarisabilities .",
    "clearly , the differential cross sections are independent of this artificial separation of the amplitudes into `` pole '' and `` non - pole '' parts . here",
    ", we only state the principle @xmath18 with the caveat that any theoretical calculation of nucleon polarisabilities should state carefully which definition of `` nucleon pole '' terms , which set of compton amplitudes and  in the case of non - relativistic frameworks  which frame of reference was used .",

    "we also notice that the concept of dispersive effects for the polarisabilities of composite systems is textbook knowledge in classical electro - dynamics and solid state physics .",
    "it was also utilised in the sixties in nuclear structure , mostly in the context of giant dipole resonances of heavy nuclei , see e.g.  @xcite and references therein .",
    "it is well known from many branches of physics that polarisabilities can become energy dependent due to internal relaxation mechanisms , resonances and particle production thresholds in a physical system . in the first , some of the internal degrees of freedom of the system `` freeze out '' at some scale as the photon energy",
    "is increased because they can not respond any more to the rapidly varying photon fields .",
    "this leads to a drop of the polarisabilities stemming from them as their relaxation time becomes larger than the inverse frequency of the photon field .",
    "resonance effects are traditionally discussed in the lorentz model which tries to describe their influence on polarisabilities by assuming that the photon field couples to a dampened harmonic multipole oscillator with a proper frequency given by the resonance energy .",
    "the width over which the polarisability changes and its maximum are then related to the decay width and strength of the resonance . in the nucleon , we therefore expect explicit @xmath58 , @xmath59 excitations etc .  to make the polarisabilities energy dependent .",
    "finally , production thresholds modify the energy dependence of the polarisabilities , adding above threshold to the dynamical polarisabilities imaginary parts which are necessary to describe the break - up channels not contained in the polarisability hamiltonian ( [ eq : ourhamiltonian ] ) .",
    "the scale over which the polarisabilities vary is in this case set by the mass of the particle produced , and by the strength of the threshold . in the nucleon ,",
    "the one pion production threshold is the most prominent example .",
    "albeit qualitative in nature , this discussion demonstrates which important information the energy dependence of the polarisabilities contains on the internal degrees of freedom of a system .",
    "we hope to have excited the reader s imagination about the physics possibilities of studying the energy dependence in dynamical polarisabilities defined via a multipole expansion .",

    "given these two functions , one has to decide at which angular momentum @xmath38 to truncate the multipole expansion .",
    "although no requirement of the multipole expansion , we choose to work at energies not higher than the one pion production threshold in compton scattering to keep the number of multipole polarisabilities small .",
    "it is trivial that the higher the photon energy , the more of the higher multipoles have to be included to obtain an accurate result . for any given calculation , it is also simple to check how many multipole polarisabilities defined via ( [ eq : polarisabilitiesdef ] ) have to be included in the expansion until the polarisabilities of interest are stable e.g.  at the @xmath62 level .",

    "we will use this example to demonstrate the feasibility of the kind of studies proposed here .",
    "the validity and accuracy of the truncation has of course to be checked separately for each theoretical framework one wants to compare to .",
    "this might necessitate to go to @xmath79 or higher for some specific model .",
    "we stress again that the multipole expansion of the compton amplitudes as performed in ( [ eq : amplitudes1 ] ) is independent of the decision which of the polarisabilities are to be extracted in ( [ eq : polarisabilitiesextr1 ] ) .",
    "of course , wanting to extract the @xmath80th multipole polarisabilities , one has to expand the amplitude at least to the @xmath80th multipole .",
    "however , in that case the @xmath80th multipole polarisabilities extracted will also be most sensitive to effects from all the neglected higher multipole polarisabilities @xmath81 .",
    "it is therefore prudent to multipole expand ( [ eq : amplitudes1 ] ) to high multipoles @xmath81 , and then limit one in solving the resulting system of equations for the polarisabilities to the first few , @xmath80 multipole polarisabilities .",
    "as long as the polarisabilities corresponding to higher multipoles are getting smaller and smaller , effects from higher multipoles diminish as @xmath38 increases .",
    "finally , we remark that in principle one could also derive our result ( [ eq : polarisabilitiesextr1 ] ) by utilising projection operators that allow the extraction of individual compton multipoles @xmath82 from a set of compton helicity amplitudes as given by pfeil et al .",

    "[ fig : polarisabilities ] .    * the surprising find  at least to leading one loop order in hb@xmath78pt in the dynamical iso - scalar electric dipole polarisability @xmath115 is that out to photon energies of @xmath116 , there is hardly any significant energy dependence .",

    "in contrast to @xmath115 , the magnetic polarisabilities show large dispersive effects even at moderately low energies : at @xmath119 , @xmath97 is increased by @xmath120 .",

    "the effect of the cusp is again clearly visible in the different slopes above and below the one pion production threshold . at low energies ,",

    "we note that the energy dependence in @xmath97 is interesting because with its help one might be able to identify the dynamical origin of the rather small overall value for the magnetic dipole polarisability of the proton ( [ eq : globala ] ) .",
    "more speculation on the dynamical content in @xmath97 can be found in the concluding section of this presentation . *",

    "it will be interesting to see whether higher order chiral calculations or dispersion theory can substantiate this disappearance of magnetic quadrupole strength in the nucleon .",
    "* finally , one observes at low energies a similar albeit less pronounced relaxation behaviour in the dynamical iso - scalar electric quadrupole polarisability @xmath108 . however , around @xmath121 , a second effect of opposite sign connected to the cusp of the one pion threshold is taking over , preventing a sharp falloff in the low energy region .",
    "again , any energy dependence resulting from the electric quadrupole excitation of e.g.  the @xmath58(1232 ) or other nucleon resonances as an intermediate state are not accounted for at this order in the calculation .",
    "we also note that although @xmath115 is hardly energy dependent at low energies , the dispersive effects in @xmath97 can lead to a noticeable increase in the dynamical equivalent of the baldin sum rule , @xmath122 , from its iso - scalar static value @xmath123 .",
    "[ sec : comments ] before concluding , we briefly dwell on low energy compton scattering off the deuteron . in contrast to low energy compton scattering on the proton which is not particularly sensitive to the polarisabilities due to at least equally large effects from the magnetic moment terms , the effects from the nucleon iso - scalar magnetic moments are small in the case of the deuteron , and the sensitivity to polarisability effects is therefore greatly enhanced . as the deuteron is _ modo grosso _ an iso - scalar target , the iso - scalar polarisabilities @xmath124 and @xmath125 of the previous section are accessed directly .",
    "it has been noticed by various authors , e.g.  @xcite and @xcite , that the compton scattering data on the deuteron taken by the sal group at @xmath126  @xcite seem to prefer a static iso - scalar magnetic dipole polarisability @xmath127 which deviates strongly from dispersion analysis predictions and from the proton values , while the static iso - scalar electric dipole polarisability @xmath128 is of the expected size .",
    "this leads also to a significant violation of the baldin sum rule , if the values extracted are taken as the _ static _ dipole polarisabilities . in view of the leading order hb@xmath78ptresult discussed in the last section",
    ", one may speculate these findings to be a sign that the dispersive effects in the iso - scalar single nucleon amplitudes might not be under full control , as the leading order chiral calculation actually hints at a basically unchanged @xmath129 and a rise in @xmath130 with energy , albeit on a much smaller scale .",
    "partially , such dispersive effects have of course been taken into account in  @xcite . likewise ,",
    "@xcite took the full energy dependence of the leading one loop predictions for the hb@xmath78ptamplitudes @xmath112 and @xmath114 as input , together with its prediction @xmath131 .",
    "none of these measures lead to a resolution of the puzzle of the iso - scalar polarisabilities of the nucleon .",
    "clearly , our results given in the previous section can not provide the solution .",
    "however , we emphasise again that large dispersive effects in @xmath130 could be at the heart of this problem in an effective field theory available today @xcite attempts to model the finite parts of @xmath107 counterterms via a resonance saturation hypothesis",
    ". it would be interesting to see what kind of energy dependence in @xmath132 results from the hypothesis of @xcite that the smallness of @xmath133 of the proton stems from a cancellation between a large paramagnetic effect arising from @xmath134 pole graphs and a large diamagnetism from the pion cloud .",
    "the implied energy dependence could be tested via the phenomenological results of dispersion analysis . ]",
    "and we believe that the formalism outlined here allows for a systematic study of these effects by comparing state of the art dispersion analyses for nucleon compton scattering with the best available microscopic calculations of the relevant dynamics in the nucleon .",
    "we also note that it might be interesting to re - analyse the sal data by directly extracting the values of the _ dynamical _ polarisabilities following ( [ eq : polarisabilitiesextr1]/[eq : polarisabilitiesextr2 ] ) in a model independent way .",
    "but before one can apply the formalism presented here at the cross section level , one of course first has to provide a similar analysis for the corresponding dynamical spin polarisabilities  @xcite .    before concluding , we also want to comment on a determination of the iso - scalar dipole polarisabilities of the nucleon from deuteron compton scattering at very low energies .",
    "it was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite that a window exists in the region @xmath135 in which the nucleon polarisabilities can be extracted in a model independent way without having to know detailed pion dynamics .",
    "the authors present a feasibility study with data at @xmath136 .",
    "dispersive effects were estimated as inducing at most a change on the level of @xmath137 .",
    "the leading one loop order hb@xmath78ptanalysis in the last section interestingly also shows that @xmath115 and @xmath97 are nearly energy independent in that low energy rgime , with changes of less than @xmath138 .",
    "we thus confirm the authors findings that at these low energies , the polarisabilities extracted can be taken as the static ones , and that a two parameter fit of the compton scattering cross section to @xmath139 and @xmath140 seems justified .",
    "such a procedure also provides a valuable cross check , as the baldin sum rule is not used as input .",
    "[ sec : outlook ]    to conclude , we want to encourage the study of the _ dynamical _ multipole polarisabilities of the nucleon as an important tool to learn about its internal structure . in contradistinction",
    "to the well known static polarisabilities which measure the deformation of an object only in a static electro - magnetic field , the dynamical polarisabilities encountered in many areas of physics gauge the global response to an external , real photon of arbitrary energy .",
    "therefore , they contain additional information about the dispersive effects , i.e.  the energy dependence of the polarisabilities , as emphasised in sect .",
    "[ sec : multipole ] .",
    "as they encode the excitation spectrum of the internal degrees of freedom of a composite object in an external electro - magnetic field of definite multipolarity , the nucleon polarisabilities will necessarily be energy dependent due to relaxation effects , resonances and particle production thresholds .",
    "thus , properties of the internal degrees of freedom of the nucleon are directly probed by them .",
    "we defined the dynamical polarisabilities starting from a multipole projection of the nucleon pole subtracted compton scattering amplitudes and gave explicit formulae how to extract the four leading spin independent multipole polarisabilities ( sect .",
    "[ sec : matching ] ) . as a simple example , we considered the predictions of leading one loop order hb@xmath78ptfor the dynamical iso - scalar electric and magnetic dipole and quadrupole polarisabilities in sect .",
    "[ sec : example ] .",
    "we demonstrated that in this case , truncating the non - pole compton amplitudes at multipolarity @xmath65 is sufficient to obtain numerically stable and convergent results for the dipole and quadrupole polarisabilities .",
    "one of the important results of the chiral calculation is that the energy dependence is likely to be strong for the magnetic polarisabilities even far below the one pion production threshold .",
    "this might have consequences for the recent discussions on compton scattering off the deuteron , as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : comments ] .",
    "the extension of the formalism to spin polarisabilities is straightforward  @xcite . in the future",
    ", we plan to identify the degrees of freedom relevant for nucleon polarisabilities at low energies by comparing the energy dependence for a set of dynamical nucleon polarisabilities , e.g.  calculated in @xmath107 @xmath141 hb@xmath78pt , with the corresponding curves from dispersion analyses  @xcitept(which parameterise all physics outside the pion nucleon particle space ) can be fitted to the dispersion results obtained for the static polarisabilities at @xmath142 , resulting discrepancies in the energy dependence in different multipole polarisabilities could point to the importance of explicit @xmath58(1232 ) , vector meson , kaon - cloud excitations etc . ] .",
    "finally , we hope that this presentation has reminded the reader that nucleon compton scattering can provide much more dynamical information on the low energy structure of the nucleon than is contained in the discussion of the usual , static dipole polarisabilities .",
