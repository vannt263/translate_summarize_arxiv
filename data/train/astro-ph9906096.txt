    "gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) are among the most energetic and enigmatic phenomena studied in astronomy .",
    "the discovery of optical transients in association with these events ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and the evidence of their cosmological origin ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) have demonstrated the enormous energies involved with these intriguing objects . however , the association of grb980425 with sn  1998bw has turned the subject on its head .",
    "sn  1998bw , located at z=0.0085 ( @xcite ) , is the nearest grb yet optically identified by a factor of 100 , and is intrinsically fainter than previous grb optical transients by several orders of magnitude .",
    "its photometric and spectral resemblance to a type ic sn , objects which are thought to result from the core collapse of massive stars whose outer envelopes have been stripped away either by binary interaction or a stellar wind , indicates that at least some grbs are associated with this type of event .",
    "however , does this object represent the same physical situation as the optical counterparts to the more distant grbs which are on the order of @xmath4 times brighter ?",
    "the coincidence of grb980425 with a peculiar sn suggests that other such associations are likely .",
    "unfortunately , the statistics are not usually compelling for singling out individual objects due to the large numbers of grbs and their poor positional information . @xcite",
    "have cross - correlated the sn and burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) catalogs and have identified a positive correlation with sn  ic .",
    "however , @xcite have used a more sophisticated error model for the batse data and found no correlation .",
    "@xcite took a different approach and looked for grb assosciations for three sne , sn  1992ar , sn  1997cy and sn  1997ef , which exhibit the high luminosity and peculiar spectra displayed by sn  1998bw .",
    "of these three objects , only sn  1997cy , presents a compelling case for a second sn / grb association .    in this paper",
    ", we detail the spectroscopic and photometric properties of sn  1997cy .",
    "we present the optical discovery and follow up observations in section 2 , we provide evidence that grb980514 is associated with sn  1997cy in section 3 , and in section 4 , we explore the properties of the grb / sn .",
    "sn  1997cy was discovered on ccd images taken 1997  july  16 ( @xcite ) as part of the mount stromlo abell cluster supernova search ( @xcite ) .",
    "the sn occurred in an anonymous , faint ( @xmath5=-17.7 within a 8 kpc radius , @xmath1  km  s@xmath6  mpc@xmath6 ) , blue @xmath7 , low surface brightness galaxy near abell cluster 3266 ( @xcite ) at a redshift of @xmath8 ( cluster redshift @xmath9 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the sn s position at @xmath10 , @xmath11 ( j@xmath12 ) is offset from the centre of its host galaxy by @xmath13 e and @xmath14 n. unfortunately , the discovery image was the first of the observing season and the most recent pre - discovery image , where the sn is _ not _ present , was taken @xmath154 months earlier on 1997  march  12 .",
    "therefore the date of explosion is not well constrained .",
    "the first spectrum of sn  1997cy was obtained on 1997  july  24 with the danish 1.5 m telescope in the wavelength range 3200 - 8800   at a resolution of 20   ( @xcite ) .",
    "we obtained two further spectra on 1997  august  9 and 1998  june  26 with the mount stromlo and siding spring observatory s ( mssso ) 2.3 m telescope .",
    "these later spectra encompass a wavelength range of 3900 - 7500   at a resolution of 4.4  , were wavelength calibrated using observations of a cu - he lamp taken at the position of the sn , and flux calibrated using sensitivity curves determined from the observation of southern flux standards chosen from the list of @xcite .",
    "we monitored sn  1997cy photometrically in the macho @xmath16 and @xmath17 passbands ( @xcite ; bessell & germany 1999 ) on the mssso 1.3 m telescope , and in the @xmath18 system with the mssso 2.3 m telescope for 15 months .",
    "additional photometric and spectroscopic observations have been taken at european southern observatory and will be published separately ( @xcite ) .    in order to properly determine a sn magnitude from a ccd frame , one must first remove the light from the host galaxy .",
    "we accomplish this by subtracting from each observation a template image where the sn is not present .",
    "we construct template images for the data taken with the mssso 1.3 m telescope from @xmath16 and @xmath17 images obtained in good seeing conditions ( @xmath14 ) on 1997  january  2 . using the techniques described in reiss et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , we register each of the images containing the sn to the appropriate template image , convolve the point spread function ( psf ) of the stars in the template with a kernel to match the psf of the stars in the registered images , then match the flux in the registered images and the template .",
    "we then subtract this intensity - transformed , convolved template from each registered observation .",
    "once we have removed the light of the host galaxy , we calculate the relative photometry between the sn and a number of local comparison stars through psf fitting with dophot ( @xcite ) .",
    "this process is detailed in @xcite .",
    "we can not apply the above techniques for extracting sn magnitudes to the @xmath18 mssso 2.3 m data , because sn  1997cy is still visible and no template yet exists in these bandpasses . however , it is possible to obtain photometry for these images at early times since the sn is so much brighter than its host galaxy . to measure the magnitude of the sn , we use the iraf task phot to obtain differential photometry , within a @xmath19 aperture , between the sn and the local comparison stars , and apply a correction for the galaxy brightness .",
    "we calculate the galaxy - correction for each filter ( ranging in size from 0.2 - 0.4 mag for @xmath20 , 0.1 - 0.3 mag for @xmath21 , and 0.1 - 0.2 mag for @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) based on the galaxy magnitude .",
    "this magnitude is derived from the mssso 1.3 m @xmath16 and @xmath17 template images within this same @xmath19 aperture and corrected to @xmath18 using the @xmath16 and @xmath17 transformations calculated by @xcite .",
    "we put the local comparison stars onto the @xmath18 standard system under photometric conditions obtained with the cerro - tololo interamerican observatory ( ctio ) 1.5 m on 1999  february  18 and 1999  march  9 and the ctio 0.9 m on 1999  february  28 .",
    "we determined the transformation coefficients to the @xmath18 standard system and the airmass coefficients for each night from observations of multiple landolt fields ( @xcite ) taken over a wide range of airmasses .",
    "we measured psf magnitudes for the standard stars and local comparison stars using daophot ( stetson 1987 ) and give the standard magnitudes for the comparison stars in table  [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "the statistical uncertainties in the measurements are included in parentheses .",
    "we can not calibrate the local comparison stars in the @xmath16 and @xmath17 system in the same way since no record is kept as to whether or not conditions are photometric .",
    "however , @xcite have determined transformation equations to convert the magnitudes of normal giant stars in the @xmath18 standard system to the @xmath16 and @xmath17 system .",
    "these transformations are : @xmath24 @xmath25    we apply equations 1 and 2 to the photometry of the local comparison stars in the @xmath18 system to calculate their magnitudes in the @xmath16 and @xmath17 system .",
    "we then determine the magnitude of the sn in each of the images from the mssso 1.3 m from the relative photometry between the sn and the calibrated local standards shown in figure  [ fig1 ] and table  [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "sn  1997cy is at @xmath8 and k - corrections are not negligible for this object .",
    "unfortunately , the peculiar nature of sn  1997cy precludes the use of other sne for calculating k - corrections , and we have based our corrections on the spectra presented here , which have been extrapolated as necessary . since the corrections for @xmath16 to @xmath26 and @xmath17 to @xmath27 are an order of magnitude larger than correcting @xmath21 and @xmath22 to @xmath28 , we add constants to the @xmath16 and @xmath17 data to bring them into alignment with the k - corrected @xmath21 and @xmath22 data respectively .",
    "sn  1997cy is a unique event without good spectrophotometry , and therefore these k - corrections are uncertain and estimated to be about as good as their size , @xmath29 mag . due to the extreme luminosity of this object , however , the uncertainty in the k - corrections has little effect on our conclusions .",
    "table  [ tbl-2 ] and table  [ tbl-3 ] summarize the photometry and k - corrected photometry obtained for sn  1997cy , and figure  [ fig2 ] shows the light curves .",
    "the @xmath21 and @xmath22 light curves are well sampled by the @xmath16 and @xmath17 observations taken on mssso  1.3 m .",
    "from the optical data , it is unclear exactly when sn  1997cy exploded , but it was certainly sometime between 1997  march  12 and 1997  july  15 , based on the discovery and pre - discovery images . during this 4 month period ,",
    "119 batse events were detected ( @xcite ) , two of which overlapped sn  1997cy s position within 2@xmath30 . these were grb970403 ( 1.92@xmath30 , 17.3@xmath31 from sn ) and grb970514 ( 0.23@xmath30 , 0.88@xmath31 from sn ) .",
    "grb970514 s proximity is clearly unexpected  it is the closest event to sn  1997cy s position yet detected by batse ( april 1991 through may 1999 ) by a factor of 2.5 . using the prescription of @xcite , where @xmath32 is the 1@xmath30 batse error circle for each object measured in radians .",
    "we note that this approximation assumes that none of the error circles overlap  a reasonable approximation in this situation . ] , the probability that a 0.23@xmath30 event will occur randomly given the 119 batse events and their respective error circles , is 1.7%  an unlikely occurence .",
    "the fact that two objects are found within a 2@xmath30 radius , however , is not surprising . over this time - frame with the 119 events observed , @xmath33 random coincidences of this significance are expected .",
    "grb970514 had a smaller error circle ( 3.7@xmath31 ) than a typical batse burst , and the above calculation provides the probability of a chance association between all bursts and sn  1997cy , regardless of their uncertainty .",
    "unfortunately , batse error circles span a wide range of sizes .",
    "just three objects contain over 30% of the probability for chance association and more than half of the probability of coincidence is contained in only 10% of the most poorly determined positions . with this approach ,",
    "if sn  1997cy had been 5@xmath31 ( 0.23@xmath30 ) away from grb970627 ( @xmath34 error circle ) , the likelihood of a chance coincidence would be the same as what was calculated above ( 1.7% ) .",
    "a different approach is to ask , given 119 events , what is the probability that one will fall within 0.88@xmath31 .",
    "this is the method we would use if we had no error model information , and is equivalent to assigning all 119 batse events error circles of 3.7@xmath31 .",
    "a calculation analagous to that above shows that the probability of a chance 0.88@xmath31 association of the sn and 119 batse events is 0.7% ( a 5@xmath31 coincidence would have a 20% probability with this method ) .    as a sanity check ,",
    "we cross - correlated the entire batse ( up through 1999 ) catalog with the @xmath35 sne discovered from 1991 to 1999 ( @xcite ) and looked for sne which had a grb burst closer than 1@xmath31 within 121 days of discovery .",
    "apart from sn  1997cy , 5 objects emerge , in agreement with the expected number of chance coincidences , @xmath36 , for this data set .",
    "of these 5 objects with coincidences , two are sn ii ( sn  1992z , sn",
    "1992aw ) whose spectra were not noted as being peculiar , two are normal sn ia ( sn  1996av , sn  1996bx ) , and the final object is sn  1993j , whose time of explosion is well known and does not match that of the correlated grb .",
    "we conclude that there are no other sn / grb coincidences as compelling as sn 1997cy / grb970514 .",
    "we have taken a conservative approach in deriving the above likelihoods of a chance coincidence between grb970514 and sn  1997cy that does not take into account the slow spectral and photometric evolution of sn  1997cy ( which suggest it was more than a month old at discovery ) .",
    "if this were to be taken into consideration , the chance of a random coincidence decreases further .",
    "however , despite this conservatism , we are still subject to the the vagaries of _ a posteriori _ statistics because we have had to specify an interesting sn / grb angular separation  after the fact .",
    "if , for example , we had chosen a @xmath37 error circle , rather than the @xmath38 error circle ( as was found to be interesting in this case ) , the chance for a coincidence between sn 1997cy and a grb is 15% .",
    "so although a chance correlation between grb970514 and sn  1997cy is unlikely  about 100 to 1 , it is still possible .",
    "we emphasize that we sought a grb coincidence initially only for this object given its extreme nature , and while we believe the association is compelling , it is certainly not conclusive .",
    "we proceed making the reasonable assumption that sn  1997cy is indeed grb970514 .",
    "grb970514 was detected on 1997  may  14 , with batse on board the compton gamma ray observatory .",
    "the batse burst profile indicated that grb970514 was a member of the fast rise exponential decay subclass of single peak events and had a duration of @xmath39s .",
    "the total gamma - ray fluence over all channels was ( @xmath40)x@xmath41 ergs @xmath42 , a factor of 10 less than that of grb980425 .",
    "if we assume that grb970514 is at the redshift of sn  1997cy and @xmath1  km  s@xmath6  mpc@xmath6 ) , this fluence translates into an estimated burst energy of @xmath43x@xmath44 ergs .",
    "this is more energy than grb980425 released ( @xcite ) but @xmath45 times less than other bursts with measured redshifts .",
    "emission was detected above 300kev marking it as a high - energy ( he ) burst ( @xcite ) .",
    "these properties set grb970514 apart from all other grbs which have had an identified optical transient .    given the association of grb980425 with sn  1998bw , @xcite and @xcite have proposed a sn associated subclass of grbs ( s - grbs ) , based on the properties of grb980425 .",
    "these s - grbs have a simple , broad burst profile with a rounded maximum , no high energy ( nhe ) emission , no long - lived x - ray afterglow and prompt radio emission .",
    "in contrast , grb970514 contains he emission and displays a cusp rather than a rounded maximum .",
    "unfortunately there was no immediate radio or x - ray followup of grb970514 and no definite properties that can be assigned to a s - grb subclass have emerged from these two objects .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows a spectrum of sn  1997cy obtained with the mssso 2.3 m telescope on 1997  august  9 , 87 days after grb970514 .",
    "also plotted are mssso 2.3 m spectra of sn  1998bw which bracket the age of sn  1997cy , and a spectrum of sn  1991 t , a type ia sn approximately 85 days after explosion ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is clear from these spectra that the two objects found to be associated with grbs are very different .",
    "sn  1998bw is classified as a type ic sn ( @xcite ) due to the absence of si , h and he lines which are representative of type ia , type ii and type ib sne respectively .",
    "sn  1997cy appears to be a hybrid object , containing the h lines present in type ii sne as well as feii/[feiii ] lines found in late time spectra of type ia sne ( @xcite ) .",
    "such an object can not be classified under the conventional scheme , and is probably best referred to as a peculiar type ii sn as per benetti et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "the dominant feature in the spectrum of sn  1997cy is an intense h@xmath46 emission line with broad ( @xmath47  km  s@xmath6 ) and narrow ( @xmath48  km  s@xmath6 ) components .",
    "however , it lacks the p - cygni profile of h@xmath46 normally found in type ii sne , and is reminiscent of the peculiar type iin sn  1988z ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this line profile suggests that a significant amount of interaction between sn  1997cy and the surrounding circumstellar material is taking place ( @xcite ) .",
    "the other main features near 4600  ( @xmath49  km  s@xmath6 ) and 5300in sn  1997cy coincide with the position of [ feiii ] typical of late time type ia spectra .    the origin of the broad absorption feature extending from 5645  to 6115  and",
    "centred at 5795  is unclear . while he(5876 ) and na  d(5893 ) are possibilities , the absorption seems far too broad and centered at too low a velocity for this to make sense .",
    "given the grb connection , one might be tempted to consider that this absorption is h@xmath46 from a jet pointed towards our line of sight .",
    "however there is no comparable h@xmath50 absorption .",
    "another possibility is that this is not an absorption feature at all , but rather a region without emission lines .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows a spectrum of sn  1997cy taken 408 days past grb970514 .",
    "h@xmath46 still dominates the spectrum although it appears narrower than in the spectrum taken 87 days after grb970514 .",
    "this and the continued presence of the mysterious dip at 5795  show the spectrum of sn  1997cy has not evolved significantly in almost a year .    more recently sn  1999e was found to have a spectrum similar to sn  1997cy .",
    "it displays an intense h@xmath46 emission line , a broad absorption feature centred near 5970  and broad undulations similar to sn  1997cy ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , it was atypically luminous @xmath51 ( @xmath1 ; @xcite ) and can been linked to grb980910 ( @xcite ) , although without great certainty [ there are no prediscovery images and this sn is separated by 4.8@xmath31 from the grb position - which itself is uncertain by 6.8@xmath31 ] .",
    "we have constructed a l@xmath53 light curve by integrating over the @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 photometry from the data taken 1997  august 9 and 10 , before it was k - corrected .",
    "we derived the effective wavelengths and flux measurements for each filter by convolving their filter transmission curves in the rest frame of the sn ( @xcite ; bessell & germany 1999 ) with the absolute spectrophotometry of vega ( @xcite ) . in keeping with the observed properties of sn",
    ", we extended the ir with a rayleigh jeans tail and truncated the uv with a function that declined much faster than a black body .",
    "this treatment of the uv is to simulate line blanketing and represents a lower bound for the flux beyond the @xmath20 filter .",
    "the correction is reasonably secure since most of the flux of the sn is contained within the wavelengths we have observed ; the total flux extrapolated to lie beyond the wavelength region of the observations is approximately 20% .",
    "we held this derived correction fixed ( for lack of better information ) for all observations and ascribed a systematic error equal in size to the correction ( 20% ) in the l@xmath53 light curve .",
    "we note that if sn  1997cy has a large uv or ir excess , then the derived bolometric luminosity could be underestimated .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows the l@xmath53 light curve of sn  1997cy compared to that of sn  1998bw ( woosley et al .",
    "1998 ) and a simple model where the late time flux is solely due to the complete thermalization of gamma - rays from the decay of 2.6 m@xmath54 of @xmath3co .",
    "sn  1997cy was clearly much brighter than sn  1998bw and initially declined at the rate of @xmath3co .",
    "we believe the large excursion from the @xmath3co decay line is due to circumstellar interaction which has subsequently decayed .",
    "this picture is consistent with the presence of feii/[feiii ] lines ( the final decay product of @xmath3ni ) and h@xmath46 in the spectrum ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is also possible that the sn is being powered only by circumstellar interaction , and the decay rate is only a coincidence . @xcite",
    "have modelled sn 1997cy",
    "s light curve under this latter assumption and find they can reproduce this late - time behaviour with an extremely energetic ( @xmath55 erg ) sn explosion expanding into dense circumstellar material . a clumpy circumstellar medium may allow a somewhat smaller explosion energy . regardless of the cause , the energy output is large , with the integral of @xmath56 from discovery to 450 days later yielding @xmath57 ergs .",
    "sn  1997cy is unlike any other sn observed ( except 1999e previously discussed ) , and its unusual nature and coincidence with grb970514 prompts speculation as to whether it is a sn , or rather an optical transient associated with a grb ( grbot ) .",
    "grbots have been discovered previously ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , but none are short duration events , and only the grbot associated with grb970508 ( @xcite ) has a convincing redshift ( @xmath58 , bloom et al .",
    "1998 ) and a well sampled @xmath59 light curve from early to late times ( @xcite ) . in order to compare sn  1997cy to the grbot associated with grb970508",
    "we construct an equivalent @xmath59 light curve for sn  1997cy at @xmath58 by calculating the flux distribution measured across the @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 passbands ( as described above ) , and then redshifting this flux distribution from @xmath8 to @xmath58 .",
    "we scale the flux down by the square of the luminosity distances ( @xmath60 ) and by another factor of @xmath61 ( to account for the @xmath62 change ) , extrapolating the data to near uv wavelengths for complete @xmath58 @xmath59 band coverage .",
    "the @xmath58 @xmath59 band magnitude is synthesized from this flux distribution and the offset between this and the observed @xmath16 magnitude is applied to all @xmath16 data to produce the @xmath59 light curve of sn  1997cy as it would have been observed at @xmath58 .",
    "the uncertainty in the @xmath58 @xmath59 light curve is approximately 0.2 mag , and is dominated the uv flux extrapolation to cover the redshifted @xmath59 bandpass .",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] plots the @xmath58 @xmath59 light curve for both sn  1997cy and the grbot970508 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the overlap region shows that the gross properties of the two late - time light curves are similar , with sn  1997cy outshining grbot970508 by about 1.7 mags .",
    "while it was earlier demonstrated that sn  1997cy is declining with a rate remarkably consistent with the 77 day half life of @xmath3co , a similar analysis of grbot970508 s late - time emission is inconclusive ; the data are consistent with a 77 day half life , but are too poor to substantiate this hypothesis .",
    "however , the general agreement between these two light curves suggests that sn  1997cy and grbot970508 may share similar physical properties at late times .",
    "it may be worthwhile to investigate the late - time light curves of suitable grbots and see if the radioactive decay of @xmath3co to @xmath3fe is responsible for their late - time energy output .    because of the different properties between grb970514 and all other grbs with associated ots , further comparison is dangerous .",
    "we note , however , that if sn  1997cy is a grbot with properties similar to those already discovered , then the disparity between the intrinsic fluences of its associated grb and other grbs ( grb970508 is 5000 times more luminous than grb970514 given their respective redshifts of @xmath58 and @xmath8 ) is naturally explained by relativistic beaming , where distant grbs are beamed towards us , but grb970514 had no preferred orientation .",
    "this model demands that the relativistic beaming factor , @xmath63 , for grbs is low , @xmath64 .",
    "larger values of @xmath63 would make the chance of seeing any gamma rays from sn  1997cy impossibly small .",
    "this conclusion is only valid , however , if we assume that grb970514 belongs to the same general class of objects which make up the observed grbots  a dubious assumption .",
    "the existence of sn  1998bw / grb980425 complicates issues because it appears to be a very different object compared to sn  1997cy / grb970514 with respect to both its grb and sn properties , and because the optical properties of sn  1998bw are very different from other grbots .",
    "if sn  1998bw and sn  1997cy are both grbs , these two events , coupled with the significant number of grbots identified at @xmath65 ( @xcite ) , provide strong argument for the luminosity function of grbs to be either rapidly evolving , bimodal or very broad .",
    "we prefer the latter two explanations since it is difficult to imagine how an astrophysical event can evolve by a factor of @xmath66 from @xmath67 to @xmath28 .",
    "bimodality is a natural consequence of a beaming model , but the significant difference between the two nearby sn / grbs argues that grbs could be produced by more than one mechanism .",
    "it is therefore quite possible , or even likely , that an observed bimodality of the grb luminosity function could be a consequence of both beaming and a variety of explosion mechanisms which lead to grbs .",
    "radio continuum observations of the field of sn  1997cy were made with the 6a ( 6  km ) configuration of the australia telescope compact array during a 14-hour session on september  15  1998 .",
    "the telescope observed simultaneously in two bands , with central frequencies 1.384 ghz ( 20 cm band ) and 2.496 ghz ( 13 cm band ) and bandwidth 132 mhz .",
    "data reduction was carried out in the usual way with the aips package .",
    "the synthesized beam fwhm was about 6.7 arcsec at 20 cm and 3.6 arcsec at 13 cm .",
    "no radio emission from sn  1997cy was detected at either frequency , and the rms noise in the final cleaned maps near the position of the sn was 78 @xmath68jy / beam at 20 cm and 68 @xmath68jy / beam at 13 cm .",
    "we therefore adopt 3@xmath30 upper limits to the radio flux density of sn  1997cy of 0.23 mjy at 20 cm and 0.20 mjy at 13 cm . at the distance of sn  1997cy",
    ", this corresponds to upper limits of 2.3@xmath69 w / hz and 2.0@xmath69 w / hz for the radio luminosity at 20 and 13 cm respectively .",
    "unfortunately , the upper limit of 2.3@xmath69 w / hz for the 20 cm radio luminosity of sn  1997cy is not very restrictive because the sn was so distant .",
    "the 20 cm radio luminosity of sn  1998bw ( the most luminous radio sn yet discovered ) reached a maximum of about 5@xmath69 w / hz , but only exceeded 2.3@xmath69 w / hz for a period of about forty days between 40 and 80 days after explosion ( @xcite ) .",
    "the radio light curve of the next most luminous radio sn , the type ii sn  1988z ( @xcite ) , rose much more slowly , reaching a 20 cm luminosity of 1.8@xmath69 w / hz almost five years after explosion ( at which point the 20 cm emission was still rising ) .",
    "our radio data , taken about 16 months after explosion , can not rule out the possibility that sn  1997cy was as powerful as sn  1998bw ( where the 20 cm peak was reached less than 50 days after explosion ) or sn  1988z ( where the 20 cm flux density was still rising after almost five years ) .",
    "another deep radio observation in 2 - 3 years time might set some further constraints on the late - time radio light curve of sn  1997cy , but unless this interesting sn is an even more radio - luminous version of sn  1988z we are unlikely ever to learn much more about its radio properties .",
    "sn  1997cy is , to our knowledge , the brightest sn yet discovered [ m@xmath70=-20.3 ( @xmath1 ) at discovery , and certainly much brighter at maximum light ] .",
    "its extreme luminosity and peculiar type ii spectrum suggest the progenitor was a supermassive star that underwent core collapse .",
    "in addition , sn  1997cy may claim the most prodigous output of @xmath3ni with our simple model indicating that it put out 30 times more @xmath3ni than is produced in typical core collapse sn . if instead the late - time light curve is soley due to energy input from circumstellar interaction , sn 1997cy is still a remarkable event , with an explosion energy considerably larger than @xmath71 ergs . in either case ,",
    "sn  1997cy is an excellent candidate for a black hole induced hypernova ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , collapsar ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , or possibly a pair production supernova ( @xcite ) , with the latter being the only model which can easily output as much as 2.6 m@xmath54 of @xmath3ni .",
    "the levelling off of the light curve at late times and later reversion to the @xmath3co decay line is probably due to energy input from circumstellar interaction which started to diminish in its effect at approximately 300 days after explosion .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the the presence of a narrow and broad component to the h@xmath46 , and the absence of h@xmath46 absorption ( @xcite ) .",
    "the material illuminated by this circumstellar interaction may pose problems for the clean environment necessary for some gamma - rays burst models , but provides the possibility that the x - ray pulse of the sn could be inverse compton scattered off the fast electrons formed as the first material from the sn and the surrounding material collide .",
    "the association of sn  1997cy with grb970514 is suggestive , but not conclusive . if this association is real there are two grbs with measured redshifts below @xmath72 ( @xcite ; benetti et al .",
    "1997 ) , and many more at @xmath73 ( @xcite ) . despite the obvious problems associated with such small numbers and the non - uniform way in which sne are discovered , only a bimodal or very broad luminosity distribution",
    "can easily explain the observed distribution of these grb redshifts .",
    "bimodality naturally occurs within a beaming model , but it could be complicated by the existence of two or more populations of objects which give rise to grbs .",
    "one thing is clear , if a non - negligible fraction of grbs are sne at @xmath72 , these objects should be easily uncovered if batse locburst events with @xmath74 error circles are followed up using the new breed of wide - field imagers on small telescopes .",
    "the search for optical transients associated with grbs should intensify over the next few years given the small positional error circles achievable with bepposax and hete2 , and the large swaths of sky that instruments such as the mssso  1.3 m and other small telescopes can observe . such optical followup of grbs is necessary if we are to discover if sn / grb associations like sn  1997cy / grb970514 and sn  1998bw / grb980425 are real , or pure chance . only with more data can we learn how sne fit into the big picture of grbs .",
    "the authors would like to thank sebastian juraszek and vince mcintyre for carrying out the atca observations , and ron ekers and mark wieringa for allowing us to use their unpublished data .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge helpful discussions with marc kippen on the batse data , stan woosley , ron eastman , peter garnavich , and kenichi nomoto on the light curves and spectra of sn  1997cy , geoff bicknell on the formation of gamma rays , and david branch on fe ii lines in sn ia .",
    "we would also like to thank professor jeremy mould for his generous allocation of director s discretionary time for the mount stromlo abell cluster supernova search on the mssso  1.3 m telescope .",
