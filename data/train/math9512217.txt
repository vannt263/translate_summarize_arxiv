    "as pointed out by silverman in talks on the subject , the special case @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 is enough to imply the recently proven `` strong uniform boundedness conjecture ''  @xcite , since torsion points of elliptic curves are exactly the preperiodic points of the multiplication - by-2 map , and their @xmath24-coordinates are preperiodic points for the degree  @xmath1 rational map that gives @xmath25 in terms of @xmath26",
    ". a similar conjecture for polynomials over @xmath27 and its finite extensions would imply the uniform boundedness conjecture for drinfeld modules  @xcite , which is still open .    thus it should come as no surprise that even the simplest cases of the conjecture seem to be difficult .",

    "conjecture  [ periodissmall ] has been verified for @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( see  @xcite and  @xcite , respectively ) , and  @xcite presents some evidence that it holds for @xmath33 as well .",

    "one can decide whether a given graph can occur in much the same way that one decides whether a given group occurs as a torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve @xmath36 over @xmath0 : the pairs @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a quadratic polynomial ( up to linear conjugacy ) and @xmath39 is a graph of preperiodic points ( of specified shape ) correspond to the points on an algebraic curve , just as elliptic curves together with level structure are parameterized by points on modular curves .",
