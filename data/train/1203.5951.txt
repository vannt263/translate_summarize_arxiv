    "many different situations found in nature take place in an environment where spatial fluctuations occur at so small length scales that they contribute only through an averaged effect on macroscopic processes .",
    "the environment is then usually modeled by introducing some disorder , like in the sherrington and kirkpatrick spin - glass model for magnetization  @xcite .",
    "in addition the time variations of the environment are often much slower than those of the mechanism of interest ( such as diffusion , transport or wave propagation ) .",
    "this leads on to consider a quenched disorder , as in the case of directed polymers @xcite and of wave propagation in random media @xcite . as a consequence , the discrete version of diffusive processes in quenched random media , known as random walks in random environment ( rwre ) @xcite ,",
    "have been largely studied by mathematicians and physicists .",
    "one usually considers a lattice with fixed random transition probabilities between sites and study the behavior of a random walk on it .",
    "one of the main questions of interest has been to determine under which assumptions such rwre are transient or recurrent ( that is whether they escape to infinity or indefinitely come back to their starting position ) . for a time - independent random environment with no space correlations",
    ", it has been shown that randomizing the environment slowdowns the diffusive properties of the random walk @xcite . furthermore , under some precise assumptions , ya .",
    "sinai @xcite proved that one - dimensional symmetric nearest - neighbor random walks in an uncorrelated environment are sub - diffusive and scale as @xmath1 when @xmath2 .",
    "b.  derrida and y.  pomeau  @xcite demonstrated that when the assumption of symmetry is relaxed , the random walk escapes as @xmath3 , with @xmath4 .",
    "j.  bricmont and a.  kupiainen  @xcite showed that the upper critical dimension of random walks in a time - independent random environment is @xmath5 , so that for @xmath6 rwre are diffusive .",
    "more recently , a large effort has been devoted to prove central - limit theorems or large - deviations principles for quenched and annealed disorders @xcite .",
    "such work generally assume that the environment has no ( or very short ) spatial correlations and that it is time - independent .",
    "only little is known for the case of time - dependent environments . in such settings and under some rather general assumptions",
    ", it was shown that random walks are always diffusive @xcite and that central limit theorems generally hold @xcite .",
    "we are here interested in situations where the timescales and length scales of diffusion are comparable or longer than those at which the environment fluctuates . a clear instance where this occurs is turbulent transport whose modeling is a key issue in industrial and environmental sciences .",
    "the classical models used for instance in engineering and meteorology are based on an `` eddy - diffusivity '' approach ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , which in general requires a clear scale separation between the turbulence and large - scale variations of the mean velocity .",
    "homogenization techniques can then be used to show that the averaged concentration field follows an effective advection - diffusion equation with an advecting velocity and a diffusion coefficient tensor that depend on the slow variables  @xcite .",
    "the large - scale mixing originating from small - scale fluctuations acts only through the diffusive term , which , by the maximum principle , can not be responsible for the creation of large concentrations .",
    "the concentrations observed in compressible flows can thus only come from the effective advection term .",
    "as we will see in this paper , the situation can be rather different when interested in other types of compressible transport .",
    "let us consider for instance species whose dynamics is dissipative in the full position - velocity phase space .",
    "we assume that the trajectory of a particle obeys the newton equation @xmath7 the forces acting on the particle are a viscous drag and an external force @xmath8 that depends on both space and two different time scales .",
    "we have dropped here the vectorial notations but all the following considerations can be easily generalized to any dimension .",
    "such an equation describes for instance the dynamics of a heavy inertial particle in a velocity field that varies over two time scales .",
    "also , one could consider a large particle embedded in a time and space - dependent thermal bath .",
    "the fast time scale @xmath9 can be interpreted as the typical time of momentum exchange between the particle and its environment . as in the einstein original work about brownian motion , the time - scale @xmath9 is much smaller than the viscous damping time @xmath10 . in the limit @xmath11",
    ", the force @xmath8 can be approximated by a gaussian noise with correlation @xmath12 where the average @xmath13 is with respect to the fast time variable .",
    "the spatio - temporal variations of @xmath14 can be interpreted as a non - homogenous temperature field in the thermal bath .",
    "we next consider the limit when the response time @xmath10 is much shorter than the slow time scale .",
    "this introduces a new fast time scale @xmath15 over which the particle velocity fluctuates .",
    "we see that @xmath16 where the last equality is obtained integrating by parts and neglecting exponentially small terms .",
    "then , taking the limit @xmath17 in we obtain @xmath18 .",
    "the particle position thus satisfies the stochastic equation @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the wiener process and where the product has to be interpreted in the it sense .",
    "the averaged particle concentration @xmath21 is then a solution to the associated forward kolmogorov equation , namely @xmath22.\\ ] ] the solutions to such an equation have a very different behavior than those to the standard diffusion equation where on the right - hand side @xmath14 would appear in between the two spatial derivatives .",
    "it is for instance clear that the mass is going to accumulate at the zeros of @xmath23 . indeed , suppose @xmath24 in the vicinity of @xmath25",
    ". at leading order , the flux reads @xmath26 , which is positive for @xmath27 and negative for @xmath28 , leading to a permanent mass flux toward @xmath25 . as we will see later",
    ", the zeros , their densities and their lifetimes play a crucial role in the statistical properties of the density field .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : descripmodel ] we introduce a time and space continuous model of diffusion in a random environment based on an ejection model in a discrete @xmath29-dimensional lattice .",
    "the model is reinterpreted in terms of particle dynamics obeying an it differential equation with a multiplicative noise and no drift .",
    "the random environment is then explicitly defined and its general spatial and temporal properties are discussed .",
    "section [ sec : diffprop ] is devoted to the study of individual trajectories of the it diffusion in the case of smooth and non - smooth environments .",
    "when the environment has a finite correlation length , particles are found to have standard diffusion properties at large times with a displacement distribution that approaches a gaussian . in section [ sec : densityfluct ] we define the density of mass and study the fluctuations of the density in smooth and non - smooth random environments .",
    "the locations where the environment ejection rate vanishes are shown to play a crucial role on the large fluctuations of density .",
    "spatial scaling properties of the mass distribution are then investigated in [ sec : scaleinv ] .",
    "we show that the distribution of the coarse - grained density possesses some rescaling properties that depend on the scale , the amplitude of the ejection rate , and the hlder exponent of the environment .",
    "finally , section [ sec : concl ] presents some concluding remarks .",
    "let us consider the @xmath29-dimensional periodical lattice of fundamental size @xmath30 and period @xmath31 .",
    "this lattice defines a tiling on which we consider the following discrete - time dynamics .",
    "the cell indexed by @xmath32 contains at time @xmath33 a mass @xmath34 .",
    "then , between times @xmath33 and @xmath35 , a fraction @xmath36 of this mass is ejected from the cell @xmath32 to one of its @xmath37 neighbors . for a given set of ejection rates",
    "@xmath38 the variables @xmath39 define a markov chain whose master equation is given by @xmath40\\rho_{\\bf i}(n)+\\sum_{{\\bf j}\\in{\\rm \\mathcal{n}_{\\bf i } } } \\gamma_{{\\bf j}}(n)\\rho_{{\\bf j}}(n),\\label{eq : model_discrete}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 are the neighbor cells of @xmath32 .",
    "it is clear that , because of periodic boundary conditions , the total mass @xmath42 is conserved .",
    "equation describes a mass - ejection process in a time - dependent non - homogeneous environment determined by the ejection rates @xmath43 .",
    "a similar model has been studied in @xcite in the case when the @xmath43 take two values , @xmath44 and @xmath45 and are uncorrelated in both space and time .",
    "this model was motivated by the study of inertial particles clustering in turbulent flows and was expected to mimic heavy particle ejection from coherent vortical structures by centrifugal forces .    turning back to the ejection model ( [ eq : model_discrete ] )",
    ", we now consider the continuous limit @xmath46 and @xmath47 . to take this limit",
    ", we suppose that the ratio @xmath48 is kept fixed .",
    "we denote by @xmath49 the continuous limit of @xmath50 , where the coefficient @xmath51 is the typical amplitude of the ejection rate and @xmath23 is an order - one time and space continuous function . in this limit , equation becomes @xmath52.\\label{eq : modeld}\\ ] ] as mentioned in the introduction , in contrast with a standard diffusion equation coming from fick s first law , the differential operator @xmath53 $ ] in the right - hand side of equation is not positive - definite .",
    "there is no maximum principle and the solution is expected to behave very differently from those to standard diffusion equations .",
    "equation ( [ eq : modeld ] ) is the fokker - planck ( forward kolmogorov ) equation associated to the it stochastic differential equation @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the @xmath29-dimensional wiener process . for @xmath56",
    ", we define the ( forward ) transition probability density @xmath57 where @xmath58 designates averages with respect to the realizations of @xmath55 .",
    "then the solutions to ( [ eq : modeld ] ) trivially satisfy for all @xmath56 @xmath59 the model described by the diffusion equation can thus be reinterpreted in terms of a random walk in a random environment ( rwre ) .",
    "indeed the discrete version of the process given by ( [ eq : sde ] ) corresponds to a random walk on the @xmath29-dimensional lattice , with a probability to hop from the site @xmath60 to one of its neighbors equal to @xmath61 .",
    "let us now specify the statistical properties of the random environment .",
    "we assume that @xmath62 and that @xmath63 is @xmath64-periodic in space .",
    "the environment is then entirely determined in terms of its fourier series that we write as @xmath65 where the @xmath66 s are positive real amplitudes and the @xmath67 s are scale - dependent characteristic times",
    ". the fourier modes @xmath68 satisfy @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "they are independent gaussian processes with unit variance and unit correlation time .",
    "we choose them as complex ornstein  uhlenbeck processes that solve the stochastic differential equation @xcite @xmath71 where the @xmath72 s are independent one - dimensional complex wiener processes .",
    "we now prescribe scale - invariance properties for the random environment .",
    "we want @xmath73 , where @xmath74 controls the regularity of the ejection rate . when @xmath75 , it is the spatial hlder exponent of the ejection rate .",
    "this amounts to assuming that the fourier mode amplitudes behave as @xmath76 .",
    "temporal scale invariance is set by assuming @xmath77 with @xmath78 .",
    "the exponent @xmath79 relates time dependence to spatial scale invariance ; the case @xmath80 corresponds to @xmath81 having a unique correlation time and @xmath82 to white - noise . as we shall see below , when @xmath75 , dimensional analysis motivates the choice @xmath83 .",
    "the numerical results presented in this work are obtained by two different manners .",
    "the density evolution is obtained by solving equation with a second - order finite - difference discretization of the laplacian and a semi - implicit euler temporal scheme .",
    "this numerical scheme ensures the conservation of the total mass with a high accuracy . in this",
    "work numerical resolutions vary from @xmath84 to @xmath85 collocation points and the time - step is chosen small enough to well resolve the fastest time scale of the problem . for particle trajectories , the stochastic equations and",
    "are solved by a standard stochastic euler scheme and ensemble averages are obtained by monte - carlo methods . in both cases",
    ", we expect the error made on the solution to act as a numerical diffusion with a constant proportional to the time step .",
    "figure [ fig : snapshot_a ] show the temporal evolution of the density and of the ejection rate @xmath86 , respectively , for a typical realization in dimension @xmath87 .",
    "figure [ fig : snapshot_b ] shows a snapshot of the random environment @xmath23 and of the position of a set of particles obeying equation in @xmath88 .",
    "it is apparent on figure [ fig : snapshot ] that the high density zones are located in the vicinity of the zeros of @xmath89 . from the right of figure [ fig : snapshot_a ]",
    "we observe that the zeros of @xmath23 follow random paths .",
    "their role on the statistical properties of the density of mass and on the diffusion properties of particles will be further discussed trough this work .",
    "the distribution and time - evolution of these zeros strongly depend on the parameter @xmath90 characterizing the environment .",
    "let us first consider the case of large @xmath90 . on figure",
    "[ fig : snapshot_a ] it is apparent that the zeros typically appear by pairs and then diffuse and separate until they merge together or with another zero . without loss of generality , we can assume that the ejection rate has only two modes and takes the simple form @xmath91 with @xmath92 .",
    "using the it formula it is possible to show that @xmath23 can be equivalently rewritten as @xmath93 , where the stochastic processes @xmath94 and @xmath95 satisfy @xmath96 where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are uncorrelated wiener processes .",
    "it is clear that the amplitude @xmath94 fluctuates around @xmath99 and that its correlation time is order one .",
    "it follows from equation that , for typical values of @xmath94 , the phase @xmath95 , and thus the position of the zeros of @xmath23 , diffuse on a order - one timescale .",
    "when @xmath75 , the random environment presents scaling properties and a very different behavior is expected .",
    "we have by construction that the second - order structure function of @xmath23 behaves as @xmath100 where the over - line stands for the ensemble average with respect to the fluctuations of the environment ( i.e.  with respect to the ornstein  uhlenbeck processes @xmath68 ) . in this work ,",
    "we make the choice of relating space and time correlations by a dimensional argument .",
    "the characteristic time @xmath101 introduced in equation , behaves as a power law , so that the correlation time of @xmath23 at scale @xmath102 is @xmath103 . according to equation ( [ eq : def_h ] ) the diffusion timescale associated to the spatial scale @xmath102 behaves as @xmath104 .",
    "the ratio @xmath105 defines a dimensionless space - dependent parameter that is usually called the kubo number .",
    "when @xmath106 , the environment is as if frozen .",
    "when @xmath107 , it fluctuates in an almost time - uncorrelated manner .",

    "when @xmath83 , we have @xmath109 , so that scale invariance is possible . here , we focus on this latter case and will describe the mass concentration properties in terms of the dimensionless parameter @xmath110 . note that the choice of having a scale - independent kubo number is common in the framework of turbulence and is expected to be relevant to the problem of diffusion of inertial particles in turbulent flows .",
    "finally , let us do a couple of remarks on the dependence upon the other parameter of the environment , namely the hlder exponent @xmath90 .",
    "using parseval s theorem , it is possible to show that @xmath111 and that @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is the riemann zeta function .",
    "we thus have that @xmath114 when @xmath74 and that @xmath115 when @xmath116 .",
    "note that , at each time @xmath117 fixed , @xmath118 is a gaussian variable with the variance of increments given by equation .",
    "therefore @xmath119 is a fractional brownian motion of exponent @xmath90 @xcite . for @xmath120",
    "it corresponds to the standard brownian motion . for @xmath121",
    "the increments of @xmath23 are not independent and have a positive covariance ; the zeros of @xmath23 are then finite and isolated .",
    "for @xmath122 the covariance of increments is negative and therefore we expect the number of zeros to become infinite and to accumulate",
    ". this different behavior of the random environment will affect the general properties of the diffusion , as we will see in the next sections .    as the ornstein  uhlenbeck processes @xmath123 are stationary , the fluctuations of the ejection rate @xmath14 is a stationary and homogeneous random field .",
    "hence we expect that , at sufficiently large times , the density distribution reaches a statistically stationary state and numerical simulations indicate that this is indeed the case .",
    "the work reported in this paper mainly concerns with the statistical properties of the density field in this large - time asymptotics .",
    "most of the results presented in this work are in dimension @xmath87 .",

    "the effective diffusion constant @xmath128 involves an average of the environment along particle trajectories which is equivalent to an average weighted by the mass density @xmath21 .",
    "as the trajectories are expected to spend a long time in the vicinity of the zeros of @xmath23 , we expect this lagrangian average to be less than the full eulerian spatial average .",
    "the displacement fluctuations of order less than @xmath129 are expected to be given by a central limit theorem .",
    "however , larger fluctuations should obey a large deviations principle with a rate function that might not be purely quadratic as it is non trivially related to the lagrangian properties of the environment . to study these fluctuations , we perform monte - carlo simulations of equation .",
    "we first consider the case where the ejection rate @xmath14 is a smooth function of space ( i.e.  @xmath116 ) . with this configuration",
    "there are a finite ( and small ) number of isolated zeros separated by a distance order @xmath130 .",

    "however the diffusion constant @xmath136 non trivially depends on @xmath51 , as seen in the inset of figure [ fig : diffuse1 ] .",
    "the non - monotonic behavior of @xmath137 can be explained by two competing phenomena . in the limit @xmath138 ( or equivalently @xmath139 )",
    "the environment changes fast enough compared to the characteristic time of diffusion given by @xmath140 . in this limit",
    ", we can consider that the particle trajectories sample homogeneously the environment , so that the lagrangian average can be replaced by the spatial eulerian average .",
    "this leads to@xmath141 for @xmath132 , we obtain @xmath142 , which is in agreement with the value observed on the inset of figure [ fig : diffuse1 ] . as @xmath51 increases , trajectories spend a longer time at the zeros of @xmath23 decreasing the value of @xmath137 . in the limit of @xmath143 ( i.e.  @xmath144 ) ,",
    "the environment can be considered completely frozen and we expect the mass density solving equation to be approximatively given by @xmath145 . from equation ( [ eq : difflin ] )",
    "we get @xmath146 .",
    "hence @xmath147 for @xmath143 as seen on the figure .",
    "in this limit the mass is completely concentrated at the zeros of the ejection rate , and the diffusion is carried out by the motions of the laters that follow a dynamics similar to equation .    the normalized probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the displacements are shown on figure [ fig : diffuse2 ] for different times and different values of @xmath51 .    at early times and for low values of @xmath51 ,",

    "the mass ejected from this cell between @xmath117 and @xmath206 is proportional to @xmath207 as @xmath208 at this point .",
    "considering that @xmath209 is constant near @xmath204 yields an exponential decay of the mass in the cell . introducing in equation a density of mass with an exponential decay @xmath210 ( with @xmath211 an effective rate )",
    "directly leads to @xmath212 which is in agreement with figure [ fig : contourrho].b .    as we will now see",
    "the situation is rather different in the non - stationary case where the motion of the zeros of the ejection rate limits the process of mass concentration .",
    "now , the coefficients @xmath213 and @xmath214 of equation are the ornstein  uhlenbeck processes defined in equations and . the pdf of @xmath21 for different values of @xmath51 is presented on figure [ fig : pdftwomodes ] .",
    "log - log plot of the pdf of the density for @xmath215 and different values of @xmath51 .",
    "inset : same figure in log - lin . ]    the time needed for the density to accumulate near the zero of the ejection rate @xmath14 is of the order of @xmath216 . hence , for small values of @xmath51 ( i.e.  @xmath217 )",
    ", the fast temporal variations of @xmath118 do not leave enough time for the system to cumulate mass .",
    "it is apparent in this case that most of mass is distributed around the mean mass @xmath218 ( see the @xmath219 curve represented by orange pentagrams ) .",
    "however , for large but finite values of @xmath220 , accumulation is fast enough and a resulting @xmath221 scaling is observed .",
    "this scaling can be derived by considering that for large @xmath220 the system rapidly relaxes to a quasi - stationary solution in a time of order @xmath140 and stays there for a time of the order of the correlation time of @xmath23 . far enough from a zero , the environment behaves as @xmath222 and its temporal evolution can be neglected .",
    "the density converges there to a quasi - stationary solution , which is such that @xmath223 , so that @xmath224",
    ". closer to the zero , the time variations of its location become faster than the concentration of mass and the density saturates to a finite value @xmath225 ( see the left - hand side of figure [ fig : sketch_density ] ) .     left : sketch of the density field in the vicinity of a zero of the ejection rate @xmath14 located at @xmath25 ; the density grows as @xmath226 and saturates to @xmath225 at a distance @xmath227 of the zero .",
    "right : sketch of the diffusive time evolution of a zero of @xmath14 , which has remained at a distance less than @xmath30 for a time @xmath228 before the reference time @xmath179 . ]",
    "the transition between these two regimes occurs at a distance @xmath30 from the zero , which by continuity satisfies @xmath227 .",
    "the length @xmath30 is of the order of the distance travelled by the zero during a timescale equal to that of mass concentration .",
    "hence , if we assume that the zero diffuses , one has @xmath229 , so that the typical value of @xmath225 is of the order of @xmath51 .",
    "the distribution of density has thus a crossover at @xmath230 . when @xmath231 , that is for values much below the plateau at @xmath225 , the behavior is dominated by the divergence of the quasi - stationary density profile . introducing @xmath232 in equation",
    "straightforwardly leads to the algebraic behavior @xmath233 note that this value of the exponent in the large - density intermediate tail is very robust .",
    "it has also been observed for larger numbers of modes and with a environment of the form @xmath234 ( data not shown ) .",
    "the behavior at @xmath235 of the pdf of density is related to the large fluctuations of @xmath225 and thus to the events when the zero does not move much during a time larger than @xmath216 .",
    "more precisely , if at a fixed time we observe a large value of @xmath225 , this means that the zero has not moved by a distance larger than @xmath236 during a time interval of length @xmath228 larger than @xmath216 ( see the right - hand side of figure [ fig : sketch_density ] ) .",
    "when the zeros diffuse , this probability relates to the first exit time distribution of a diffusive process .",
    "the probability density of the first time @xmath228 at which the wiener process exit the interval @xmath237 is @xmath238 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we thus obtain @xmath239 for @xmath235 the leading - order behavior is given by @xmath240 .",
    "this leads to the following exponential cutoff for the pdf of mass density @xmath241 this exponential behavior is confirmed numerically as can been seen on the lin - log plot showed in the inset of figure [ fig : pdftwomodes ] .",
    "we now turn to the case of a time - dependent non - smooth ejection rate @xmath23 .",
    "figure [ fig : pdfs_vs_h ] presents the pdf of @xmath21 for a number of runs with different values of @xmath51 and @xmath90 .",
    "remark that for large @xmath51 a power - law behavior is observed at small masses see inset of figure [ fig : pdfs_vs_h_b ] .",
    "these tails can be understood using a phenomenological argument similar to the one used in @xcite .",
    "consider an extreme event leading to a very low density in a cell where only ejection of mass has taken place for some time .",
    "for such a configuration we expect an exponential decay of the density and thus a time of order @xmath242 to reach a small density @xmath21 ( where @xmath243 is an effective rate ) .",
    "the probability of having this configuration depends only on the properties of the environment .",
    "let @xmath244 be the probability of having such a configuration .",
    "as the environment de - correlates in a time order one , the number of independent realizations of the environment that is needed for the full process to take place during a time @xmath228 , is @xmath245 .",
    "therefore , the probability of this complete event is @xmath246 , where @xmath247 is a proportionality constant that depends on @xmath90 .",
    "we thus obtain that the probability of such an extreme event is proportional to @xmath248 , with @xmath249 .",
    "note that this is actually a lower bound to the small mass tail , which is valid as far as @xmath250 and @xmath251 .",
    "obtaining an analytic expression of the exponent @xmath79 is a theoretically challenging problem that is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "the exponent @xmath79 can be obtained by fitting the left tail of the mass density pdf inside the range where the power law is observed .",
    "the fits are presented in dashed lines on the inset of figure [ fig : pdfs_vs_h_b ] and the dependence of @xmath79 on the hlder exponent @xmath90 is displayed on figure [ fig : exp&var_a ] for @xmath252 .",
    "note that width of the pdf s on figure [ fig : pdfs_vs_h ] clearly depends on the value of the hlder exponent @xmath90 as it is apparent on figure [ fig : exp&var].b that represents the variance of the density @xmath253 .",
    "observe that both the exponent @xmath79 and the variance @xmath254 , do not have a monotonic behavior as a function of @xmath90 .",
    "this can be qualitatively understood in the following way . when decreasing the value of @xmath90 , the number of zeros of @xmath118 increases .",
    "however their spatial distribution also depends on the hlder exponent @xmath90 . on the one hand , for @xmath121 the space increments of @xmath23",
    "are positively correlated .",
    "this implies that there is no accumulation of zeros . for this configuration",
    ", the mass is transported from the non - vanishing zones of @xmath118 to the nearest zeros . therefore decreasing @xmath90 ,",
    "more and more zeros are present , creating large masses and void zones and thus increasing fluctuations . on the other hand , for @xmath122",
    "the covariance of increments is negative and there are some finite - size regions with a large number of zeros .",
    "@xmath118 vanishes many times in such zones , so that the diffusion is very weak and mass is trapped .",
    "this makes the transfer inefficient and reduces the probability of having extremely large or low mass concentrations . in simpler words ,",
    "a large number of zeros increases fluctuations as long as they are not too dense .",
    "we expect then a change of behavior near of @xmath120 , this is in agreement with figure [ fig : exp&var].a - b , especially for the largest value of @xmath51 where the properties of the system are expected to depend more strongly on the ejection rate distribution of zeros .",
    "in this section we study the scaling properties of the density field . for",
    "that we introduce the coarse - grained mass density @xmath255 note that by homogeneity we have @xmath256 .",
    "the pdf of @xmath257 is computed using the definition and it is displayed on figure [ fig : cgproperties ] for different values of @xmath90 and @xmath168 .",
    "the narrowest curves on each figure correspond to the largest ( non trivial ) scale @xmath150 and the curves monotonically increase their width when decreasing the scale down to the smallest scale of the runs .    for spatially smooth environments ,",
    "the coarse - grained density of mass becomes invariant when decreasing the scale , as it is apparent on figure [ fig : cgproperties_a ] for @xmath132 .",
    "this indicates that the density field is spatially smooth and that the zeros are isolated .",
    "the collapse is faster for small densities .",
    "this is due to the accumulation of mass only in some very small clusters and the creation of large void zones .",
    "this large voids dominate the coarse - grained density statistics up to their typical size , that is for @xmath258 , as seen from figure [ fig : cgproperties_a ] . on the contrary ,",
    "the typical size @xmath259 of mass clusters is rather small .",
    "averaging over scales larger than that this length scale reduces the largest mass fluctuations .",
    "indeed , the coarse - grained density can not exceed @xmath260 and this cutoff decreases with @xmath102 , as can be observed on figure [ fig : cgproperties_a ] .",
    "this argument does not applies for non - smooth environments where the distribution of zeros is highly non trivial .",
    "the scale invariance is then broken , as observed on figures [ fig : cgproperties_b ] and [ fig : cgproperties_c ] .",
    "this is also apparent on figure [ fig : scaleinvariance_a ] which represents the variance @xmath261 as a function of @xmath102 for different values of @xmath90 . for @xmath116 and @xmath262 the variance @xmath263 does not depend on the scale @xmath102",
    "( see the inset of the figure ) .",
    "however , one observes that for @xmath75 and @xmath262 the variance presents a power - law scaling @xmath264 that suggests a self - similar behavior of the density .",
    "the exponent @xmath265 is displayed on the inset of figure [ fig : cgproperties_c ] .",
    "the scaling invariance of the density field can be understood in the neighborhood of the zeros of @xmath23 .",
    "let us assume that the ejection rate vanishes at @xmath266 .",
    "then , in the neighborhood of @xmath204 , we have @xmath267 .",
    "supposing that the density behaves as a power - law in the vicinity of @xmath204 and rescaling space as @xmath268 , one can easily see that the rescaled density @xmath269 is a solution of @xmath270\\label{eq : modelscaled}.\\ ] ] hence , we expect that if the coarse - grained density @xmath257 presents a self - similar property , then the pdf of @xmath257 obtained with a given value of @xmath51 will coincide at large values with that of @xmath271 corresponding to an ejection rate of amplitude @xmath272 .",
    "this scale invariance is apparent on figure [ fig : scaleinvariance].b where different pdf s of @xmath257 , with different values of @xmath51 and @xmath102 such that @xmath273 are confronted for @xmath120 and collapse at large densities .",
    "to summarize , we have introduced a diffusion model based on a simple discrete mass ejection process where the ejection rates are random variables with temporal and spatial correlations .",
    "the model can be interpreted in terms of random walks in a time - dependent random environment .",
    "we have considered space - periodic environments where the temporal dependence of each fourier mode is given by independent ornstein  uhlenbeck processes and both the amplitudes of the modes and their correlation times present some prescribed spatial scaling properties .",
    "this allowed us to consider smooth and non - smooth environments with fast and slow temporal dependence .",
    "no other assumptions were made on the environment and we expect such environments to display generic properties and to be representative of sufficiently general situations .",
    "the model was studied analytically and numerically .",
    "the corresponding particle dynamics is given by an it differential equation with a multiplicative noise and no drift .",
    "we observed that random trajectories diffuse at large times .",
    "also , the probability distribution of their displacements tends to a gaussian at large times and the deviations to this asymptotic behavior decrease as @xmath274 . to take into account the fluctuations of mass due to the randomness of the environment we introduced and studied the probability distribution of the density of mass .",
    "we obtained some analytical results on the density of mass in the case of a stationary environment and showed that it displays a power - law tail at large masses with exponent @xmath275 . in the general case",
    ", we observed a competition between a trapping effect due to vanishing ejection rates of the random environment and the mixing due to its temporal dependence which leads to large fluctuations of the density of mass .",
    "these fluctuations were studied for both , smooth and non - smooth random environment . in the smooth case",
    ", we showed that the pdf has an intermediate power - law behavior , like in the stationary case but with an exponent @xmath0 , followed by an exponential cutoff .",
    "finally , we studied the spatial scaling properties of the mass distribution by introducing a coarse - grained density field . for smooth",
    "random environments the coarse - grained density was found to be scale invariant .",
    "we showed that at large masses , it possesses some scaling properties that depend on the coarse - graining size , the ejection rate typical amplitude , and the hlder exponent of the environment .",
    "the overall dynamics of the model that was introduced in this paper contains several space and time scales .",
    "mass rapidly accumulates near the regions with a vanishing ejection rate and slowly moves following the diffusion of the zeros .",
    "depending on the properties of the environment , there is also a clear separation of length scales : small mass fluctuations at small scales and large ones at the scale of the distance of two vanishing ejection rates .",
    "this scale separation strongly suggests trying to determine by standard homogenization techniques , a large - scale effective diffusion tensor and eventually an effective transport term .",
    "this matter is kept for future work .",
    "extending our approach to dimensions higher than one is another possible direction for future .",
    "the ejection rate will then vanish on complicated sets that , depending on its regularity , might display fractal properties .",
    "varying the hlder exponent of the random environment , its amplitude and the observation scales could then lead to a rather rich collection of different regimes .",
    "for instance , a particular attention would be needed to understand whether or not a power - law is still present in the mass density probability distribution .    to conclude ,",
    "let us stress again that the zeros of the environment play a crucial role on both the diffusive properties and the mass density statistics .",
    "they are responsible for mass accumulation but , at the same time , constitute barriers to transport .",
    "this duality implies that the fine statistical details of such systems crucially depend on the features of such zeros and in particular on the local structure of the ejection rate in their vicinity . in this work ,",
    "we have decided to focus on ejection rates that can be written as the square of a generic gaussian random function .",
    "however this choice can not be always relevant and , for instance , it might be sometimes more appropriate to write the ejection rate rather as the exponential of a random function .",
    "this would change drastically most of the results reported in this paper .",
