    "a key practical issue is to decrease the energy dissipation in superconductors , which occurs due to the motion of vortices .",
    "this dissipation can be suppressed by pinning of vortices . in particular , a physical problem of pinning in superconducting thin films with a periodic array of antidots ( holes ) was considered in @xcite ( see also references therein ) .",

    "we consider a mathematical model of pinning of vortices by many holes in relatively small superconducting samples ( comparable to the london depth ) submitted to a uniform magnetic field , which is weak so that the vortices do not appear in the bulk of the superconducting sample and they may exist only in the holes .    since modern experimental techniques allow to create very small holes , the question arises what kind of physical effects can be expected for such sample . in particular",

    "the results of @xcite were subsequently generalized for the magnetic gl functional @xcite , @xcite and pinning by a single inclusion .",

    "more recently pinning by finitely many holes",
    "whose sizes goes to zero as the ginzburg - landau parameter goes to infinity was established in @xcite for the sgl model .",
    "homogenization in the framework of magnetic gl model with continuous oscillating pinning term was considered in the pioneering work @xcite , where large number of vortices is described by the homogenized vorticity density . since some composite superconductors are described by a discontinuous pinning term , in subsequent works @xcite homogenization problems for such term were address in the context of simplified gl model and special dirichlet boundary conditions , which result in either no vortices @xcite or @xmath1 vortices @xcite .    in this work",
