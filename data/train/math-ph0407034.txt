    "the statistical mechanics of pure systems ",
    "most prominently the topic of phase transitions and their associated surface phenomena  has been a subject of fairly intensive research in recent years .",
    "several physical principles for pure systems ( the gibbs phase rule , wulff construction , etc . ) have been put on a mathematically rigorous footing and , if necessary , supplemented with appropriate conditions ensuring their validity .",
    "the corresponding phenomena in systems with several mixed components , particularly solutions , have long been well - understood on the level of theoretical physics .",
    "however , they have not received much mathematically rigorous attention and in particular have not been derived rigorously starting from a local interaction .",
    "a natural task is to use the ideas from statistical mechanics of pure systems to develop a higher level of control for phase transitions in solutions .",
    "this is especially desirable in light of the important role that basic physics of these systems plays in sciences , both general ( chemistry , biology , oceanography ) and applied ( metallurgy , etc . ) .",
    "see e.g. @xcite for more discussion",
    ".    among the perhaps most interesting aspects of phase transitions in mixed systems is a dramatic _ phase separation _ in solutions upon freezing ( or boiling ) .",
    "a well - known example from `` real world '' is the formation of brine pockets in frozen sea water . here , two important physical phenomena are observed :    1 .",
    "migration of nearly all the salt into whatever portion of ice / water mixture remains liquid .",
    "clear evidence of _ facetting _ at the water - ice boundaries .",
    "quantitative analysis also reveals the following fact :    1 .",
    "salted water freezes at temperatures lower than the freezing point of pure water .",
    "this is the phenomenon of _ freezing point depression_.    phenomenon  ( 1 ) is what `` drives '' the physics of sea ice and is thus largely responsible for the variety of physical effects that have been observed , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "notwithstanding , ( 13 ) are not special to the salt - water system ; they are shared by a large class of the so called _ non - volatile _ solutions .",
    "a discussion concerning the general aspects of freezing / boiling of solutions  often referred to as _ colligative _ properties  can be found in  @xcite .    of course ,",
    "on a heuristic level , the above phenomena are far from mysterious .",
    "indeed , ( 1 ) follows from the observation that , macroscopically , the liquid phase provides a more hospitable environment for salt than the solid phase .",
    "then ( 3 ) results by noting that the migration of salt increases the entropic cost of freezing so the energy - entropy balance forces the transition point to a lower temperature .",
    "finally , concerning observation  ( 2 ) we note that , due to the crystalline nature of ice , the ice - water surface tension will be anisotropic . therefore , to describe the shape of brine pockets , a wulff construction has to be involved with the caveat that here the crystalline phase is on the outside . in summary",
    ", what is underlying these phenomena is a phase separation accompanied by the emergence of a crystal shape . in the context of pure systems ,",
    "such topics have been well understood at the level of theoretical physics for quite some time @xcite and , recently ( as measured on the above time scale ) , also at the level of rigorous theorems in two  @xcite and higher  @xcite dimensions .",
    "the purpose of this and a subsequent paper is to study the qualitative nature of phenomena ( 13 ) using the formalism of equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "unfortunately , a microscopically realistic model of salted water / ice system is far beyond reach of rigorous methods .",
    "( in fact , even in pure water , the phenomenon of freezing is so complex that crystalization in realistic models has only recently  and only marginally  been exhibited in computer simulations  @xcite . )",
    "thus we will resort to a simplified version in which salt and both phases of water are represented by discrete random variables residing at sites of a regular lattice .",
    "for these models we show that phase separation dominates a non - trivial _ region _ of chemical potentials in the phase diagram  a situation quite unlike the pure system where phase separation can occur only at a single value ( namely , the transition value ) of the chemical potential .",
    "the boundary lines of the phase - separation region can be explicitly characterized and shown to agree with the approximate solutions of the corresponding problem in the physical - chemistry literature .",
    "the above constitutes the subject of the present paper . in a subsequent paper @xcite",
    "we will demonstrate that , for infinitesimal salt concentrations scaling appropriately with the size of the system , phase separation may still occur dramatically in the sense that a non - trivial fraction of the system suddenly melts ( freezes ) to form a pocket ( crystal ) .",
    "in these circumstances the amount of salt needed is proportional to the _ boundary _ of the system which shows that the onset of freezing - point depression is actually a surface phenomenon . on a qualitative level",
    ", most of the aforementioned conclusions should apply to general non - volatile solutions under the conditions when the solvent freezes ( or boils ) .",
    "notwithstanding , throughout this and the subsequent paper we will adopt the _ language _ of salted water and refer to the solid phase of the solvent as ice , to the liquid phase as liquid - water , and to the solute as salt .      our model will be defined on the @xmath0-dimensional hypercubic lattice  @xmath1 .",
    "we will take the ( formal ) nearest - neighbor hamiltonian of the following form : @xmath2 here @xmath3 is the inverse temperature ( henceforth incorporated into the hamitonian ) ,  @xmath4 and  @xmath5 are sites in  @xmath1 and  @xmath6 denotes a neighboring pair of sites .",
    "the quantities  @xmath7 ,  @xmath8 and  @xmath9 are the ice ( water ) , liquid ( water ) and salt variables , which will take values in  @xmath10 with the additional constraint @xmath11 valid at each site  @xmath4 .",
    "we will say that  @xmath12 indicates the _ presence of ice _ at  @xmath4 and , similarly ,  @xmath8 the _ presence of liquid _ at  @xmath4 .",
    "since a single water molecule can not physically be in an ice state , it is natural to interpret the phrase  @xmath12 as referring to the collective behavior of many particles in the vicinity of  @xmath4 which are enacting an ice - like state , though we do not formally incorporate such a viewpoint into our model .",
    "the various terms in are essentially self - explanatory : an interaction between neighboring ice points , similarly for neighboring liquid points ( we may assume these to be attractive ) , an energy penalty  @xmath13 for a simultaneous presence of salt and ice at one point , and , finally , fugacity terms for salt and liquid . for simplicity ( and tractability ) , there is no direct salt - salt interaction , except for the exclusion rule of at most one salt `` particle '' at each site .",
    "additional terms which could have been included are superfluous due to the constraint .",
    "we will assume throughout that  @xmath14 , so that the salt - ice interaction expresses the negative affinity of salt to the ice state of water .",
    "this term is entirely  and not subtly ",
    "responsible for the general phenomenon of freezing point depression .",
    "we remark that by suitably renaming the variables , the hamiltonian in would just as well describe a system with boiling point elevation .",
    "as we said , the variables  @xmath7 and  @xmath8 indicate the presence of ice and liquid water at site  @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the assumption  @xmath15 guarantees that _ something _ has to be present at  @xmath4 ( the concentration of water in water is unity ) ; what is perhaps unrealistic is the restriction of  @xmath7 and  @xmath8 to only the extreme values , namely  @xmath16 . suffice it to say that the authors are confident ( e.g. , on the basis of @xcite ) that virtually all the results in this note can be extended to the cases of continuous variables .",
    "however , we will not make any such mathematical claims ; much of this paper will rely heavily on preexisting technology which , strictly speaking , has only been made to work for the discrete case .",
    "a similar discussion applies , of course , to the salt variables .",
    "but here our restriction to  @xmath17 is mostly to ease the exposition ; virtually all of our results directly extend to the cases when  @xmath9 takes arbitrary ( positive ) real values according to some _ a priori _ distribution .",
    "it is not difficult to see that the `` ice - liquid sector '' of the general hamiltonian reduces to a ferromagnetic ising spin system . on a formal level",
    ", this is achieved by passing to the ising variables @xmath18 , which in light of the constraint gives @xmath19 by substituting these into , we arrive at the interaction hamiltonian : @xmath20 where the new parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 are given by @xmath23 we remark that the third sum in is still written in terms of `` ice '' indicators so that  @xmath24 will have a well defined meaning even if  @xmath25 , which corresponds to prohibiting salt entirely at ice - occupied sites .",
    "( notwithstanding , the bulk of this paper is restricted to finite  @xmath13 . )",
    "using an appropriate restriction to finite volumes , the above hamitonian allows us to define the corresponding gibbs measures .",
    "we postpone any relevant technicalities to section  [ sec2.1 ] .",
    "the hamiltonian as written foretells the possibility of fluctuations in the salt concentration .",
    "however , this is _ not _ the situation which is of physical interest .",
    "indeed , in an open system it is clear that the salt concentration will , eventually , adjust itself until the system exhibits a pure phase . on the level of the description provided by it",
    "is noted that , as grand canonical variables , the salt particles can be explicitly integrated , the result being the ising model at coupling constant  @xmath21 and external field  @xmath26 , where @xmath27 in this context , phase coexistence is confined to the region  @xmath28 , i.e. , a simple curve in the @xmath29-plane . unfortunately , as is well known  @xcite , not much insight on the subject of _ phase separation _ is to be gained by studying the ising magnet in an external field .",
    "indeed , under ( for example ) minus boundary conditions , once  @xmath22 exceeds a particular value , a droplet will form which all but subsumes the allowed volume .",
    "the transitional value of  @xmath22 scales inversely with the linear size of the system ; the exact constants and the subsequent behavior of the droplet depend on the details of the boundary conditions .",
    "the described `` failure '' of the grand canonical description indicates that the correct ensemble in this case is the one with a fixed amount of salt per unit volume .",
    "( the technical definition uses conditioning from the grand canonical measure ; see section  [ sec2.1 ] . )",
    "this ensemble is physically more relevant because , at the moment of freezing , the salt typically does not have enough `` mobility '' to be gradually released from the system .",
    "it is noted that , once the total amount of salt is fixed , the chemical potential  @xmath30 drops out of the problem  the relevant parameter is now the salt concentration . as will be seen in section  [ sec2 ] , in our ising - based model of the solvent - solute system , fixing the salt concentration generically leads to _ sharp _ phase separation in the ising configuration .",
    "moreover , this happens for an _ interval _ of values of the magnetic field  @xmath22 .",
    "indeed , the interplay between the salt concentration and the actual external field will demand a particular value of the magnetization , even under conditions which will force a droplet ( or ice crystal , depending on the boundary condition ) into the system .",
    "[ rem0 ] we finish by noting that , while the parameter @xmath22 is formally unrelated to temperature , it does to a limited extent play the role of temperature in that it reflects the _ a priori _ amount of preference of the system for water _ vs _ ice . thus the natural phase diagram to study is in the @xmath31-plane .",
    "the reasoning which led to formula allows for an immediate heuristic explanation of our principal results .",
    "the key simplification  which again boils down to the absence of salt - salt interaction  is that for any ising configuration , the amalgamated contribution of salt , i.e. , the gibbs weight summed over salt configurations , depends only on the overall magnetization and not on the details of how the magnetization gets distributed about the system . in systems of linear scale",
    "@xmath32 , let  @xmath33 denote the canonical partition function for the ising magnet with constrained overall magnetization  @xmath34 .",
    "the total partition function  @xmath35 at fixed salt concentration  @xmath36 can then be written as @xmath37 where  @xmath38 denotes the sum of the salt part of the boltzmann weight  which only depends on the ising spins via the total magnetization  @xmath34over all salt configurations with concentration  @xmath36 .",
    "as usual , the physical values of the magnetization are those bringing the dominant contribution to the sum in .",
    "let us recapitulate the standard arguments by first considering the case @xmath39 ( which implies @xmath40 ) , i.e. , the usual ising system at external field @xmath22 .",
    "here we recall that  @xmath41 can approximately be written as @xmath42},\\ ] ] where  @xmath43 is a suitably chosen constant and  @xmath44 is a ( normalized ) canonical free energy .",
    "the principal fact about @xmath44 is that it vanishes for  @xmath45 in the interval  @xmath46 $ ] , where  @xmath47 denotes the spontaneous magnetization of the ising model at coupling  @xmath21 , while it is strictly positive and strictly convex for  @xmath45 with  @xmath48 .",
    "the presence of the `` flat piece '' on the graph of  @xmath44 is directly responsible for the existence of the phase transition in the ising model : for  @xmath49 the dominant contribution to the grand canonical partition function comes from  @xmath50 while for  @xmath51 the dominant values of the overall magnetization are  @xmath52 .",
    "thus , once  @xmath53which happens for  @xmath54 with  @xmath55 whenever  @xmath56a phase transition occurs at  @xmath57 .",
    "the presence of salt variables drastically changes the entire picture .",
    "indeed , as we will see in theorem [ thm1 ] , the salt partition function @xmath38 will exhibit a nontrivial exponential behavior which is characterized by a _ strictly convex _ free energy . the resulting exponential growth rate of @xmath58 for @xmath59 is thus no longer a function with a flat piece  instead , for each  @xmath22 there is a _",
    "unique _ value of  @xmath45 that optimizes the corresponding free energy .",
    "notwithstanding ( again , due to the absence of salt - salt interactions ) once that  @xmath45 has been selected , the spin configurations are the typical ising configurations with overall magnetizations  @xmath60 . in particular , whenever  @xmath35 is dominated by values of  @xmath60 for an  @xmath61 , a _",
    "macroscopic droplet _ develops in the system .",
    "thus , due to the one - to - one correspondence between  @xmath22 and the optimal value of  @xmath45 , phase separation occurs for an _ interval _ of values of  @xmath22 at any positive concentration ; see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "we finish with an outline of the remainder of this paper and some discussion of the companion paper  @xcite . in section  [ sec2 ]",
    "we define precisely the model of interest and state our main results concerning the asymptotic behavior of the corresponding measure on spin and salt configurations with fixed concentration of salt .",
    "along with the results comes a description of the phase diagram and a discussion of freezing - point depression , phase separation , etc . ,",
    "see section  [ sec2.3 ] .",
    "our main results are proved in section  [ sec3 ] . in  @xcite",
    "we investigate the asymptotic of infinitesimal salt concentrations .",
    "interestingly , we find that , in order to induce phase separation , the concentration has to scale at least as the inverse linear size of the system .",
    "with the ( formal ) hamiltonian in mind , we can now start on developing the _ mathematical _ layout of the problem . to define the model , we will need to restrict attention to finite subsets of the lattice .",
