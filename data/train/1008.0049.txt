    "radioactive nuclei , especially those close to the drip lines , can have quite low particle emission thresholds and consequently have low - lying resonance states in their spectra .",
    "low - energy scattering of rib is a coupled - channel problem that involves such low - lying resonant states of the scattered ion . to address this , a multi - channel algebraic scattering ( mcas ) formalism  @xcite",
    "is used , in which momentum space solutions of coupled lippmann - schwinger equations are found , including also all negative - energy bound states . a finite - rank separable representation using an `` optimal '' set of sturmian functions  @xcite serves to construct an input matrix of nucleon - nucleus interactions .",
    "the mcas method has the ability to locate all compound system resonance centroids and widths , regardless of how narrow . for full details",
    "see reference  @xcite .",
    "also , by use of orthogonalizing pseudo - potentials ( opp ) in generating sturmians , it ensures the pauli principle is not violated  @xcite , despite the collective model formulation of nucleon - nucleus interactions used .",
    "otherwise , some compound nucleus wave functions possess spurious components .    in the following sections",
    ", we first briefly summarize the mcas method  @xcite , which has been extended to unstable target states in ref .",

    "these increases bring the theoretical @xmath14be state widths closer , often significantly , to experimental values , as evidenced by comparison of the final columns of the two tables .",
    "only the @xmath36 , also poorly recreated in centroid , has a worse match with widths applied .",
    "the resultant elastic and reaction cross sections are shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the blue line depicts the results without widths , the red line with constant widths multiplied by the heaviside ( step ) function : @xmath37 for @xmath38 ; @xmath39 for @xmath40 ( for the green line , see section  [ scaling ] . ) introducing target state widths , the resonances in @xmath14be are suppressed but still present ; their widths increasing and magnitudes decreasing so as all but the @xmath41 , and arguably @xmath42 , can not be discerned from the background .",
    "the reaction cross section found in the no - width case is zero until 3.4 mev ( 3.03 mev in the centre of mass frame ) , the first inelastic threshold .",
    "when the target state has width different from zero the elastic cross section has flux loss from zero projectile energy upwards .",
    "there is an asymptotic behaviour as energy approaches zero . in the reaction cross section from the width calculation",
    ", there is a broad peak at  1.5 mev , corresponding to the @xmath43 resonance .",
    "using widths not varying with energy ( see the next section ) , the bound states , @xmath44 , of the compound @xmath14be system are unstable due to the couplings to the decaying excited states of the @xmath0be core .",
    "for this reason the widths have been multiplied by a heaviside function to ensure that the compound system is stable at negative energies .",
    "an improvement of this technique is discussed in the next section .",
    "a smooth description of the energy dependence of the decay width is needed to avoid any pathological behaviour caused by the heaviside function .",
    "this function allows maintaining the stability of the compound system in the sub - threshold region , by setting to zero all widths for @xmath45 , but can generate `` ghost '' levels where the application of widths could move a sub - threshold state above @xmath46 , thus creating two copies of the same state .",
    "also , a dramatic overestimation of the reaction cross - section occurs in the region close to threshold .",
    "we therefore need to improve the model with a suitable parametrization of the energy - dependence of the decaying width for the excited levels , with the constraint that the width must be zero at the scattering threshold , and equal to the experimental width at the resonance centroid energy .",
    "we are presently exploring various forms of energy dependences for the widths of these excited states ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "examples of such expressions are @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 is the heaviside function defined above and @xmath51 is a parameter , and the gaussian form @xmath52 in this paper we study only the first form . the second , and others , will be explored in future work .",
    "also yet to be taken into account is causality , as needed when dealing with energy - dependent widths  @xcite .    in figure  [ fig3 ]",
    "we give the induced energy dependence for the function @xmath53 with respect to the renormalized energy @xmath54 .",
    "the curves differ for different values of the parameter @xmath51 .",
    "the green line in figure [ fig1 ] shows the effect of this energy - dependent width on elastic and reaction cross sections , respectively , when @xmath55 .",
    "clearly , for this value of @xmath51 , the asymptotic behaviour in the reaction cross section at @xmath56 is suppressed , but not resolved .",
    "the use of an energy dependence in the widths of the excited states of the target introduces a new aspect that has to be taken into consideration . in principle , an energy dependence in the widths induces a corresponding energy - dependence in the positioning of the resonance centroids .",
    "this additional effect is a direct consequence of the principle of causality which demands that the real and imaginary part of any green s function matrix elements are related by a dispersion integral .",
    "such an aspect has been extensively discussed in the study of the properties of the nuclear optical potential  @xcite .",
    "eq .  [ rational ] is particularly convenient in this regard , because the corresponding dispersion integral leads to an analytical energy - dependent shift of the resonance centroids . such analytical forms",
    "have been derived in ref .",
    "@xcite for a class of functions which includes eq .",
    "[ rational ] .",
    "the resulting energy shift function @xmath57 is given by the analytical expression : @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60",
    "an extension to the multi - channel algebraic scattering ( mcas ) formalism that considers particle - decay widths of target nucleus eigenstates has been applied to a range of light mass nuclear targets  @xcite , in addition to the results for @xmath34be shown in this paper . to ensure that any resonance aspect of target states does not have influence below the nucleon - nucleus threshold in our formalism ,",
    "we have used a heaviside function to cut off tails of the positive - energy resonances below zero energy of the compound system .",
    "this procedure , however , is too simplistic since it introduces non - physical singularities in cross sections at the approach to zero energy , and may also incorrectly overestimate reaction cross just above the threshold .    a better energy dependent scaling factor is needed : one with value one at the centroid energy and approaching zero for lower and higher energies .",
    "we propose here possible means of achieving such modified lorentzians , and show , for one example , their effect on the elastic and reaction cross sections in the scattering of neutrons from @xmath0be .",
    "work is in progress to apply these and other forms to the light - nuclear systems considered in our previous work .",
    "work is in progress , also , for preserving causality in the presence of energy - dependent widths by the use of appropriate dispersion relations .",
