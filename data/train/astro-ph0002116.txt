    "many gamma - ray burst counterparts have now been identified using the rapid , precise localizations available from the bepposax spacecraft , as well as from the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer , starting with grb970228 ( costa et al .",
    "1997 ; van paradijs et al .",
    "such detections occur at a low rate ( @xmath2 ) , and they have been limited to the long  duration events so far , but they have confirmed the cosmological origin of at least this class of bursts . since 1977 , interplanetary networks of omnidirectional grb detectors have provided precise triangulations of both short and long bursts at rates up to @xmath1 1/week , but often the networks have been incomplete , or the data return from the interplanetary spacecraft has been slow . the present , 3rd ipn is now complete with _ ulysses and near as its distant points ( cline et al .",
    "1999 ) and , in conjunction with numerous near - earth spacecraft , can produce precise grb error boxes within @xmath1 1 d , making them useful for multi - wavelength follow - up observations . here",
    "we present the observations of grb991208 , which was rapidly localized to a small error box , leading to the identification of its radio and optical afterglow , and eventually to the measurement of its redshift . _ _",
    "grb 991208 was observed by the _",
    "ulysses grb ( hurley et al .",
    "1992 ) , konus-_wind ( aptekar et al . 1995 ) , and near x - ray / gamma - ray spectrometer ( xgrs : goldsten et al .",
    "1997 ) experiments .",
    "_ ulysses , in heliocentric orbit , near , approaching rendezvous with the asteroid eros , and _ wind , were 2176 , 937 , and 1.5 light - seconds from earth , respectively .",
    "_ _ _ _    we focus here on the _ ulysses and near data ; konus data will be presented elsewhere .",
    "the _ ulysses and xgrs light curves are shown in figure 1 .",
    "although _ ulysses recorded the first 57 s of the burst with 0.03125 s resolution in the triggered mode , the peak of the event occurred slightly later , and we have shown the 0.5 s resolution real - time data in the figure .",
    "the xgrs bgo anticoincidence shield is employed as the near burst monitor , and the only time history data available from it are 1 s resolution count rates for the 100 - 1000 kev energy range .",
    "the burst can be characterized by a t@xmath3 duration of 68 s , placing it firmly in the `` long '' class of bursts ( hurley 1992 ; kouveliotou et al .",
    "the event - integrated _ ulysses spectrum is well fit between 25 and 150 kev by a power law , thermal bremsstrahlung , or blackbody spectrum . for the following analysis",
    ", we adopt the power law , which has a photon index 1.68 @xmath4 0.19 , and a @xmath5 of 4.3 for 11 degrees of freedom ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the 25 - 100 kev fluence is @xmath6 , with an uncertainty of @xmath7 due to count rate statistics and systematics .",
    "since the xgrs shield provides only very low resolution ( 40 minutes ) spectral data , we can only estimate the fluence in the xgrs energy range from its light curve to be about the equivalent of that observed by _ ulysses .",
    "thus the total fluence above 25 kev is @xmath8 .",
    "bursts with this intensity or greater occur at a rate @xmath9 .",
    "since the peak of the event occurs when only the 0.5 s _",
    "ulysses data are available , we can estimate the peak flux only over this time interval ; it is @xmath10 , 25 - 100 kev ( @xmath11 ) , with a contribution in the 100 - 1000 kev energy range which is again probably equivalent . _ _ _ _ _ _    a preliminary @xmath1 14 sq .",
    "ipn error box was circulated @xmath1 44 h after the earth - crossing time of the event ( 04:36:53 ut : hurley et al .",
    "the final error box is shown in figure 3 , and nests within the preliminary one ; it has an area of @xmath1 1.3 sq .",
    "its coordinates are given in table 1 .",
    "also shown in figure 3 is the position of the radio counterpart to the burst detected by frail ( 1999 ) .",
    "we note that this is the first time that a grb position determined by the 3rd ipn alone ( i.e. , no _ compton gamma - ray observatory batse or _",
    "bepposax observations ) has been successfully used for multiwavelength counterpart searches . _ _",
    "very large array ( vla ) observations were begun on 1999 december 10.92 ut , 2.73 days after the gamma - ray burst . in order to image the entire 14 sq .",
    "initial ipn error box ( hurley et al . 1999 ) with the vla at 8.46 ghz two pointings were required , each with a field - of - view at half power response of 5.3 . the full 100 mhz bandwidth was used in two adjacent 50-mhz bands centered at 8.46 ghz .",
    "a single pointing was also made at 4.86 ghz , but the bandwidth was halved in order to image the full 9field - of - view without distortion .",
    "the flux density scale was tied to the extragalactic sources 3c ( j0137 + 331 ) , while the array phase was monitored by switching between the grb and the phase calibrators j1637 + 462 ( at 8.46 ghz ) and j1658 + 476 ( at 4.86 ghz ) .",
    "there were three radio sources inside the initial ipn error box ( figure 3 ) .",
    "of these , two were previously known from an earlier survey of this part of the sky ( becker , white & helfand 1995 ) .",
    "the third source , located at located at ( epoch j2000 ) @xmath12  =  @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) @xmath15=  @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) was near the center of the initial ipn error box . on the basis of its position , compactness ( @xmath18 ) , and a rising flux density between 4.86 ghz and 8.46 ghz ( 327 @xmath4 45 @xmath19j and 707 @xmath4 39 @xmath19j respectively ) , frail ( 1999 ) proposed that it was the afterglow of grb . despite the proximity of this location to the sun ( @xmath20 ) ,",
    "numerous optical observations were carried out , and this suggestion was quickly confirmed by the independent detection of a coincident optical source , not visible on the digital sky survey ( castro - tirado et al .",
    "1999 ) .    in the week",
    "following the afterglow discovery , it was determined that the optical flux faded as a power - law with a rather steep temporal decay index @xmath21 ( where @xmath22 ) ( jensen et al .",
    "1999 ; garnavich and noriega - crespo 1999 ; masetti et al .",
    "optical spectroscopy emission lines from a presumed host galaxy , if identified with [ oii ] and [ oiii ] features , place grb at a redshift @xmath23 ( dodonov et al 1999 ) , making this the third closest grb with a spectroscopically - measured redshift .",
    "grb has been no less interesting at radio wavelengths .",
    "it has the brightest radio afterglow detected to date and consequently it has been detected and is well - studied between 1 ghz and 350 ghz ( pooley 1999 ; shepherd et al .",
    "1999 ; bremer et al . 1999 ) .",
    "for a 25  1000 kev fluence of @xmath24 and a redshift z=0.707 , the isotropic energy of this burst would have been @xmath25 ; for a peak flux of @xmath26 in the same energy range , the isotropic peak luminosity would have been @xmath27 .",
    "these estimates assume @xmath28 .",
    "rhoads ( 1997 ) has pointed out that one signature of beaming is a steep decay in the afterglow light curve , @xmath29 . as the initial optical light curve for grb991208 indeed appears to decay this steeply ,",
    "the emission may well be beamed , reducing these estimates .",
    "the current ipn now consists of _ ulysses and near in interplanetary space , and numerous near - earth spacecraft such as _ wind , _",
    "bepposax , and the _ compton gamma - ray observatory .",
    "the _ mars surveyor 2001 orbiter will join the network in mid-2001 .",
    "the ipn currently observes @xmath1 1  2 grbs per week and is localizing many of them rapidly to small error boxes .",
    "these events tend to be the brighter ones , but apart from this , there is no bias towards any particular event duration ; indeed , the ipn generally obtains its smallest error boxes for the short bursts .",
    "neither is there any sun - angle restriction for the event locations , which means that bursts will be detected whose locations are close to the sun , as this one was , making prompt radio observations of these positions important .",
    "the other advantages of radio observations over optical are the longer lifetime of the radio afterglow , the immunity from weather , and the freedom to operate at any part of the diurnal cycle",
    ". this should increase the rate of counterpart detections substantially over the next several years .",
