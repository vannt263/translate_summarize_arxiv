    "in this overview , we will discuss selected highlights from phenix in the areas relating to the initial state and early times , focusing only on those which we believe to be the most significant new results . these will include 1 ) the suppression of rapidity - separated hadron pairs in @xmath1 collisions , 2 ) the contributions of quarkonia and drell - yan to the non - photonic single electrons used to detect heavy quarks , 3 ) the continued suppression of the @xmath2 in @xmath3 collisions to high-@xmath4 , 4 ) the suppression of @xmath5s in @xmath6 collisions , and 5 ) estimates of the initial temperature from direct photons in @xmath6 collisions .",
    "the physics that modifies hard processes in nuclei relative to those on a free nucleon , often called cold nuclear matter ( cnm ) effects , includes 1 ) traditional shadowing either from global fits or from coherence models , 2 ) gluon saturation at small momentum fraction ( @xmath7 ) which is amplified in the nuclear environment , and 3 ) initial - state energy loss and multiple scattering . for hadron pairs with a rapidity separation between the two hadrons in the pair , where one `` triggers '' on a mid - rapidity ( @xmath8 ) hadron and studies correlations with a forward - rapidity ( @xmath9 ) hadron",
    ", there are two pictures which attempt to describe the characteristics of the process .",
    "qcd based pictures , such as those used by vitev  @xcite that include non - leading - twist shadowing , give suppression of the pairs compared to the mid - rapidity trigger particle .",
    "an alternative approach which represents gluon saturation in the color - glass - condensate ( cgc ) model  @xcite also gives suppression and gives broadening of the angular correlation peak between the two particles in the pair . in the cgc picture ,",

    "we have also studied hadron pairs in @xmath1 collisions where both hadrons are at mid - rapidity , this time in terms of @xmath17 which is basically the same as @xmath18 for a single particle , but in this case for pairs ,    @xmath19    these pairs exhibit a very large cronin - like enhancement , i.e. they scale faster than @xmath15 ( @xmath20 ) and both @xmath17 and the angular correlation width decrease for larger @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "recent studies of the contribution of quarkonia and drell - yan to the spectrum of single electrons from heavy quarks have determined that for transverse momenta above about 5  gev/@xmath21 these contributions can amount to up to 16% of the total non - photonic electron yield  @xcite .",

    "[ quarkonia_electrons ] ( left ) and one can see that the @xmath2 gives the dominant contribution . after subtracting off these estimates of the contributions to the @xmath0 collision data , with careful attention to their uncertainty , shown in fig .",

    "similar corrections , but with larger uncertainties have been applied for @xmath6 collisions . however , because both @xmath0 and @xmath6 are lowered by about the same amount , the resulting nuclear depencence in @xmath6 collisions , @xmath22 , is not significantly changed .",
    "most open - heavy flavor meson measurements at rhic to date are not able to separate contributions to the single electrons from charm and beauty , while theoretical predictions of energy loss and flow in the hot - dense medium created in high - energy heavy ion collisions are generally quite different for charm and beauty .",
    "recently a new method has been employed , where one studies the correlations of hadrons near the observed electron and exploits the fact that the decay of a beauty meson into an electron and hadron produces a broader correlation and lower efficiency for observing the pair than that of a charm meson . using this technique ,",

    "phenix has also measured open - heavy flavor mesons at forward rapidity via their decay to single muons , but so far not with enough precision to define the shape of the cross section vs rapidity .",
    "however , three different methods in phenix now yield consistent cross sections in @xmath0 collisions at mid rapidity : single electrons via cocktail subtraction , a converter method , and with di - electrons . using the beauty fraction determined above",
