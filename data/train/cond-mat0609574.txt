    "experimental detection @xcite of a dc current generated by the mesoscopic sample in response to local slow periodic driving revived interest in the adiabatic quantum pump effect and stimulated increased experimental and theoretical efforts . while there are still only a few experiments @xcite the theoretical literature is large and we can refer here only to a few representative works @xcite .",
    "one of the possible applications of an adiabatic pump consists in using it as a source of correlated particle flows .",
    "@xcite adiabatic driving excites particles only a little and thus avoids strong dephasing due to inelastic relaxation .",
    "however for quantum information processing not only phase coherence but in addition the correlations between emitted particles are crucial , since only non - classical @xcite correlations can be used , see , e.g. , ref .  .    in mesoscopic systems the zero - frequency noise is usually used to characterize the correlations between the particles .",
    "@xcite in a time - dependent set - up this quantity provides information averaged over a pump period which characterizes , in particular , how regularly the pump emits particles .",
    "this follows from the observation that the regime of quantized pumping @xcite ( when exactly the same number of particles is emitted for each pumping cycle ) is characterized by a vanishing @xcite zero - frequency noise power .",
    "thus a pump emitting particles regularly does not produce a zero - frequency noise .",
    "the properties of a pump evolve in time .",
    "that in turn makes the properties of emitted particles dependent on the time moment when they actually leave the pump . in general",
    "the particles emitted to different leads , leave the pump at different time moments .",
    "consider , for instance , the processes taking place in a pump in a quantized pumping regime .",
    "typically this is a resonant transmission structure subject to large amplitude driving .",
    "@xcite in this case the quantization of the pumped charge is due to well separated quantum levels inside the structure which are filled and emptied during the pumping cycle .",
    "when the quantum level is filled then one particle ( we ignore spin ) is transferred from the reservoir to the pump .",
    "alternatively this process can be view as emission of a hole .",
    "further , when the level is emptied then one particle is transferred from the pump to the reservoir . to achieve a directed transport between the reservoirs ,",
    "say , @xmath0 and @xmath1 it is necessary to have the pump strongly coupled to the reservoir @xmath0 ( and decoupled from other reservoirs ) during the former process and to the reservoir @xmath1 during the latter one , or vice versa .",
    "@xcite the coupling conditions change during the pumping cycle . as a result the current pulses ( corresponding to emitted particles ) at different leads occur at different time moments .    therefore , to get a more detailed description of correlation properties of emitted particles it is necessary to investigate the noise properties of a pump on a time - scale shorter than the pump period .",
    "our aim is to calculate and explore a two - time current - current correlator for a periodically driven mesoscopic scatterer .",
    "we expect that this quantity will be useful to access additional information concerning correlations between emitted particles .",
    "we use the approach presented in ref .",
    "where , on the basis of a scattering matrix approach to ac transport in phase coherent mesoscopic system @xcite , the general floquet scattering matrix approach , see , e.g. , ref .",
    ", was adapted to describe the low frequency limit of a cyclic scatterer .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[ccgen ] we describe the approach used and the approximations employed . in sec.[2tccf ] we calculate the time - dependent current generated by the pump and investigate the current correlation function in the time domain . to illustrate the general approach in sec.[2tscs ] we consider a resonant transmission pump .",
    "we conclude in sec.[concl ] .",
    "to investigate the basic physical phenomena underlying the quantum pump effect we omit unnecessary complications and consider the following model : we suppose ( i ) the pump to be connected to @xmath2 macroscopic particle reservoirs via single - channel ballistic leads .",
    "the reservoirs are in equilibrium and they are not affected by the presence of the pump .",
    "( ii ) the electrons to be spinless noninteracting particles which maintain phase coherence propagating through the pump from one reservoir to another reservoir , and ( iii ) the characteristic energy - scales involved to be considerably smaller than the fermi energy @xmath3 of electrons .      the model presented above can be effectively described within the scattering approach .",
    "@xcite in each lead @xmath4 we introduce two kinds of ( second quantization ) operators in energy representation , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "they correspond to incoming to the scatterer and out - going off the scatterer electrons , respectively .",
    "if the properties of a scatterer evolve in time periodically ( the period is @xmath7 ) then @xmath8-operators are related to @xmath9-operators via the floquet scattering matrix @xmath10 : @xcite @xmath11 here @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the number of energy quanta which the electron absorbs ( @xmath14 ) or emits ( @xmath15 ) during interaction with an oscillating scatterer .",
    "the current conservation forces @xmath16 to be a unitary matrix : @xmath17 here @xmath18 is a unit @xmath19 matrix .    in terms of operators for incoming and out - going particles",
    "the current @xmath20 in lead @xmath0 reads as follows:@xcite    [ eq9 ] @xmath21",
    "@xmath22    where @xmath23 denotes a quantum - statistical average .    another quantity we investigate is the correlation function of currents ( see , e.g. , ref .  ):    [ eq10 ] @xmath24 @xmath25    here @xmath26 is a current fluctuation operator . the quantities in time and in frequency representation",
    "are related to each other via the fourier transformation : @xmath27 in the equations for correlation functions such a transformation is applied to each argument .",
    "notice that throughout the paper we deal with two kinds of frequencies which we suppose to be small compared to the fermi energy , @xmath28 the first is a fixed pump frequency @xmath29 .",
    "the second is a variable measurement frequency @xmath30 .",
    "the former defines an energy shift in the floquet scattering matrix elements and thus relates to the scattering properties of the driven conductor of interest , while the latter gives us spectral contents of a measured quantity .      substituting eq.([eq6 ] ) into eqs.([eq9a ] ) we get the current :    [ eq13 ] @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the fermi distribution function with @xmath33 and @xmath34 being the temperature and the chemical potential of reservoir @xmath0 ; @xmath35 is the boltzmann constant . for the correlation function , eq.([eq10a ] ) , we find @xmath36    here we introduced a convenient abbreviation : @xmath37 +   f_{\\beta}(e^{\\prime})[1-f_{\\alpha}(e)].\\ ] ]    first of all from eq.([eq13a ] ) it follows that the oscillatory scatterer generates currents having a discrete frequency spectrum @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , the current generated is periodic in time with a period of @xmath40 .",
    "the harmonic with @xmath41 is a dc current being usually the quantity of interest . in general",
    "there are two sources of dc currents .",
    "first , we can have a potential difference between the reservoirs , @xmath42 , and , second , an oscillatory scatterer generates its own dc current ( a pump effect ) .",
    "the higher harmonics , @xmath43 , ( at stationary reservoirs ) are solely due to a non stationary scatterer .",
    "in contrast to the current , the noise power , @xmath44 , exists even if the pump does not work ( i.e. , in the stationary case ) and the reservoirs are at the same conditions . in such a case only one term in eq.([eq13b ] ) survives , @xmath45 this term is due to quantum fluctuations present in the system with continuous spectrum , see , e.g. , ref .  .",
    "they are visible in the noise power but they are not visible in the current .",
    "a working pump has a twofold effect on the measured noise , fig.[fig0 ] .",
    "first , it gives rise to side lines with @xmath43 in the plane @xmath46 [ see , eq.([eq13b ] ) ] , and , second , it modifies the noise power at the main line , @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , one can not simply divide the measured noise into a quantum noise and a noise generated by the pump .",
    "they interfere strongly between themselves .",
    "the existence of a quantum noise makes it difficult to analyze the current correlations on a time - scale of the order of the pump period @xmath47 .",
    "nevertheless , as we will show , the pump has a unique and distinguishable effect on the measured current fluctuations .",
    "in general it is difficult to analyze eqs.([eq13 ] ) analytically .",
    "therefore , to proceed further we make some simplifications .",
    "first , since we are interested in the current generated by the pump , we consider the case when there are no currents due to other reasons .",
    "in particular we suppose that all the reservoirs have the same potentials and temperatures : @xmath48 second , we consider the particular but important case of small driving frequencies .",
    "we suppose @xmath29 to be small enough to apply an adiabatic approximation to calculate the floquet scattering matrix .      in general , to calculate the floquet scattering matrix @xmath49 one needs to solve the full time - dependent scattering problem .",
    "here we are interested in the limit of low driving frequencies . in this limit",
    "we use an adiabatic approximation and express the floquet scattering matrix in terms of the stationary scattering matrix @xmath50 which is assumed to be known .",
    "the adiabatic approximation is valid if the energy - scale @xmath51 dictated by the modulation frequency is small compared with the energy - scale @xmath52 over which the stationary scattering matrix @xmath53 changes significantly : @xcite @xmath54 notice , under the condition given above the side band energy @xmath55 is positive for any reasonable @xmath13 and @xmath56 of interest here .",
    "therefore , in all the relevant equations we can safely extend summation over the discrete index from @xmath57 to @xmath58 .",
    "let the stationary scattering matrix @xmath50 depends on some parameters @xmath59 .",
    "we suppose that the external driving results in a variation of these parameters , @xmath60 . the matrix @xmath61 with parameters to be fixed at time moment @xmath62 we call a frozen scattering matrix . since the driving is periodic the parameters and in turn the frozen scattering matrix are periodic in time as well .    to zero - th order in driving frequency the elements of the floquet scattering matrix @xmath63",
    "can be approximated by the fourier coefficients @xmath64 of the frozen scattering matrix @xmath65 as follows : @xcite    [ eq18 ] @xmath66 @xmath67    here @xmath68 denotes the rest which is at least of the first order in @xmath29 and which we neglect .",
    "the fourier transformation used reads as follows    [ eq19 ] @xmath69 @xmath70    notice , since the frozen scattering matrix is periodic in time we expand it in the fourier series in contrast to a fourier integral expansion used in eqs.([eq9 ] ) - ( [ eq11 ] ) .",
    "the next simplifications we make concerns other energy - scales in the problem of interest .",
    "the effect of the pump is strongly pronounced if the energy quantum @xmath51 is larger than ( or comparable to ) the temperature . therefore , taking into account eq.([eq17 ] ) , we suppose the temperature to be less than the energy - scale @xmath52 relevant for the scattering matrix , @xmath71    the pump generates currents and noise at frequencies of order @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , we will consider the current and noise at @xmath72 only .",
    "thus , in addition to eqs.([eq17 ] ) and ( [ eq20 ] ) we put @xmath73    in such a low temperature and low frequency limit the scattering matrix can be treated energy independent , @xmath74 . then , taking into account eq.([eq15 ] ) , we perform an energy integration in eqs.([eq13 ] ) as follows : @xmath75 substituting eqs.([eq18 ] ) and ( [ eq22 ] ) into eq.([eq13 ] ) , we find the current spectral density and the noise power in the adiabatic low temperature limit as follows :    [ eq23 ] @xmath76",
    "@xmath77   \\coth\\left(\\frac{\\hbar[(l - q)\\omega - \\omega]}{2k_bt}\\right ) \\bigg\\}. \\end{array}\\ ] ]    here the lower index @xmath78 denotes a fourier transformed squared matrix element [ see , eq.([eq19b ] ) ] .",
    "@xmath79 is an element of a _ two - particle _ ( frozen ) scattering matrix @xmath80 introduced in ref .  .",
    "the fourier coefficients for this matrix entering eq.([eq23b ] ) can be expressed in terms of the single - particle scattering matrix : @xmath81    now we use eqs.([eq23 ] ) to calculate the current correlation function in the time domain .",
    "the current correlation function @xmath82 diverges at coincident times @xmath83 . that is due to quantum fluctuations having an unbounded spectrum .",
    "to avoid such infinities we will integrate any time - dependent quantity over some time interval @xmath84 .",
    "the additional advantage of such a procedure is that we will find a quantity which can be easily interpolated between a time - averaged quantity ( at @xmath85 ) and a local in time one ( at @xmath86 ) .",
    "since we are investigating the correlations on a time - scale of the order of a pump period , we put @xmath87 . strictly speaking we will consider @xmath84 both larger or smaller than @xmath47 . however in order for the equation ( [ eq23b ] ) to remain valid the interval @xmath84 must be larger than @xmath88 [ see , eq.([eq17 ] ) ] .",
    "thus , for any time - dependent measurable @xmath89 we introduce a corresponding quantity @xmath90 calculated in the following way : @xmath91 for the sake of computational simplicity we use the gaussian kernel . using the inverse fourier transformation , eq.([eq11 ] )",
    ", we express @xmath92 in terms of a spectral density @xmath93 as follows : @xmath94 notice , in dealing with the current correlation function @xmath82 , eq.([eq10b ] ) , we use for the first and second time arguments the gaussian kernels centered at different time moments @xmath95 and @xmath96 , respectively .    using eqs.([eq13 ] ) and eq.([eq29 ] ) we find the current @xmath97 and the two - time current correlation function @xmath98 :    [ eq30 ] @xmath99 @xmath100    with @xmath101 and @xmath102 given by eqs.([eq23 ] ) . note the shift @xmath103 we made in eq.([eq30b ] ) .    to illustrate the application of these expressions we consider some limiting cases .      in the stationary case",
    "the scattering matrix is independent of time and the current spectral density , eq.([eq23a ] ) , is identically zero : @xmath104 .",
    "therefore , the current , eq.([eq30a ] ) , is zero , @xmath105 .",
    "in contrast , the noise due to quantum and/or thermal fluctuations is present . substituting eq.([eq23b ] ) into eq.([eq30b ] ) and taking into account that the time - independent scattering matrix has only a fourier coefficient with @xmath41 , we get : @xmath106 this correlation function satisfies the conservation law @xmath107 and it depends only on the time difference as it should be in the stationary case    the current correlation function @xmath108 is factorized into the product of two factors . one of them , @xmath109 , responsible for the conservation law , eq.([eq32 ] ) , depends on quantum mechanical exchange amplitudes .",
    "this factor encodes information about the properties of a scatterer .",
    "the second factor , @xmath110 , describes the temporal evolution of current fluctuations due to intrinsic ( quantum statistical ) correlations in the system of fermi particles .",
    "@xcite only electrons originating from the same reservoir are correlated in such a way .",
    "the electrons which originated from different reservoirs are not correlated .",
    "note that due to the unitarity of scattering the out - going electrons do not contain any additional correlations compared with incoming ones ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) .",
    "this is why the temporal evolution of current correlations is described only by the function @xmath110 .",
    "the function @xmath110 depends crucially on the ratio of the measurement time interval @xmath84 and the temperature @xmath111 .",
    "we evaluate @xmath110 in two limiting cases which we conventionally term `` classical '' and `` quantum '' . in the classical limit ,",
    "@xmath112 the correlation of currents is exponentially suppressed away from a measurement time interval , @xmath113 the reason is that in this limit the relevant current fluctuations are thermal in nature . in the limit of @xmath86",
    "the function @xmath114 approaches a delta - function that is characteristic for a thermal ( white ) noise , @xmath115 in contrast , in the quantum limit , @xmath116 the function @xmath110 is different : @xmath117 it has a long - time tail and changes sign at the crossover from a short to a long time difference region .",
    "such a behavior results form a quantum nature of fluctuations ( with a characteristic energy @xmath118 ) mainly contributing in this regime .    in fig.[fig1 ]",
    "we give the function @xmath110 ( normalized by its value at @xmath119 ) for several values of the parameter @xmath120 .",
    "the crossover from the quantum to classical regime occurs approximately at @xmath121 .    note , if the time kernel is sharper than described by the gaussian , for instance , if the currents are measured during a time interval of duration @xmath84 , the function @xmath110 has qualitatively the same behavior .",
    "next we go to the time - dependent set - up and , first , consider the limit of a long measurement time .      in the limit of @xmath122 again only the terms with @xmath41 contribute in eqs.([eq30 ] ) , since @xmath123 .",
    "but , in contrast to the stationary case , now the scattering matrix depends on time and , as a consequence , ac currents are generated by the pump . at a long measurement time , eq.([eq37 ] ) , only the dc component of the generated current is measured , @xmath124 . substituting eq.([eq23a ] ) into eq.([eq30a ] ) and keeping only the term with @xmath41 , we find the well known result for the pumped dc current : @xcite @xmath125 next , calculating the current correlation function , eq.([eq30b ] ) , with the noise power given by eq.([eq23b ] ) we take into account the following .",
    "first , only the term with @xmath41 contributes to eq.([eq30b ] ) .",
    "second , the relevant frequencies @xmath30 contributing to the integral in eq.([eq30b ] ) are of order @xmath126 , see fig.[fig0 ] . in the long measurement time",
    "limit they are smaller than the pumping frequency , @xmath127 . therefore , in the sum over @xmath128 in eq.([eq23b ] ) , one can drop @xmath30 in all the terms except the one with @xmath129 .",
    "in addition we suppose that the temperature is not ultra low and the classical limit [ see , eq.([eq33 ] ) ] holds .",
    "then the current correlation function is proportional to the zero - frequency noise power @xmath130 and reads : @xmath131 the zero - frequency noise power @xmath130 generated by the pump was calculated in ref .  .",
    "we emphasize that here we are interested in the leading order contribution only .",
    "therefore , eq.([eq39 ] ) does not contain the linear in @xmath29 corrections to thermal noise investigated in ref .  .",
    "we note two consequences due to a working pump .",
    "first , a noise survives even in the zero temperature limit ( a shot - like noise ) .",
    "second , we find a modification of the thermal noise power compared with what we have in the stationary case .",
    "the nontrivial modification consists in replacing one @xmath132 by the average value of a squared element of a two - particle scattering matrix @xmath133 .",
    "the latter can change the sign of a linear in temperature contribution to the zero frequency noise power in the limit @xmath134 , i.e. , when this contribution is only a small part of the entire noise power .",
    "the modification of the zero frequency noise power is only a part of the effect of an oscillating scatterer on the current correlation function [ since only the term with @xmath41 was taken into account ] . to assess the whole effect [ i.e. , to take into account all the terms in eq.([eq30b ] ) ] we consider the full two - time correlation function .",
    "if the measurement time interval is shorter than the pump period then one can investigate the full time - dependent ( ac ) currents generated by the pump and their fluctuations .",
    "in such a case , according to eqs.([eq30 ] ) , a number of harmonics @xmath78 contribute to the quantities of interest .",
    "however in each particular case it is enough to keep only a finite number @xmath135 of them depending on how many of the floquet scattering matrix elements @xmath136 we need to correctly describe the scattering of electrons by the working pump . in particular ,",
    "if the driving amplitude is small only the lowest side - bands matter : @xmath137 .",
    "therefore , to resolve all the harmonics of a current generated , the measurement time interval @xmath84 must be small enough ( but finite ) : @xmath138 this condition allows us to put @xmath139 in all the terms in eqs.([eq30 ] ) . substituting eq.([eq23a ] ) into eq.([eq30a ] ) and performing summation over @xmath78 we obtain a time - dependent current @xmath140 generated by the pump : @xcite @xmath141    we see that at enough small @xmath142 the current measured @xmath143 is independent of the measurement time interval .",
    "the situation is different for the current correlation functions .",
    "this is because with decreasing @xmath84 the quantum noise contribution increases , see fig.[fig0 ] .    to calculate the current correlation function @xmath144 we substitute eq.([eq23b ] ) into eq.([eq30b ] ) .",
    "taking into account that the relevant frequencies @xmath145 are much larger than the pump frequency @xmath29 we can decouple the integration over @xmath30 from the summation over @xmath78 and @xmath128 . to this end",
    "we make the shift @xmath146 in the first line of eq.([eq23b ] ) , the shift @xmath147 in the second line , and the shift @xmath148 in the third line of that equation .",
    "then to leading order in @xmath149 we find : @xmath150 equation ( [ eq42 ] ) resembles the result for the noise of a stationary scatterer , eq.([eq31 ] ) : the correlation function @xmath82 satisfies the conservation law , eq.([eq32 ] ) , and it contains the same factor @xmath110 which originates from the correlations in a fermi gas .",
    "nevertheless the time - dependent scatterer modifies the current correlation function considerably . this modification concerns the factor @xmath109 which depends on quantum mechanical exchange amplitudes .    to comment upon the origin of different terms in @xmath109",
    "we note that for noninteracting electrons the current correlation function can be divided into four statistically independent contributions originating from the correlation between ( i ) the incoming particles , ( ii ) the out - going particles , ( iii ) the particles incoming to lead @xmath1 and the ones out - going to lead @xmath0 , and ( iv ) the particles incoming to lead @xmath0 and the particles out - going to lead @xmath1 .",
    "all of them exhibit the same suppression  described by the function @xmath110  with increasing time difference .",
    "however , the weight of these processes ( the four terms in @xmath109 ) differ from one another . that is due to the difference in the relevant exchange amplitudes .",
    "the quantum exchange involving only incoming particles results in the term @xmath132 reflecting the fact that electrons at different reservoirs are quantum - statistically independent of each other .",
    "this term is the same for stationary , eq.([eq31 ] ) , as well as for dynamical , eq.([eq42 ] ) , scattering because the incoming particles are assumed to be independent of the oscillatory scatterer .",
    "in contrast , the out - going particles are strongly affected by the pump . as a result , the quantum exchange amplitudes involving the out - going particles are different for stationary and for dynamical scattering .",
    "the correlations between incoming and out - going particles are proportional to the squared matrix elements of a stationary / frozen scattering matrix taken at the time moments when the current fluctuations are measured at the lead with the out - going particles .",
    "we stress that in the dynamical case , these matrix elements are taken at different time moments @xmath95 [ in the case ( iii ) ] and @xmath96 [ in the case ( iv ) ] , while in the stationary case they are time - independent .",
    "the correlations involving only out - going particles changes more dramatically when the pump starts to work .",
    "while in the stationary case these correlations are the same as the ones between incoming particles [ the second @xmath132 in eq.([eq31 ] ) ] , in the dynamical case they result in a squared matrix element of a two - particle scattering matrix @xmath151 . for small amplitude driving ,",
    "the matrix @xmath152 deviates from the unit matrix only a little , @xmath153 , while for a large amplitude driving such a deviation can be significant and it can reverse the sign of the entire current correlation function [ compare eq.([eq31 ] ) and eq.([eq42 ] ) ] .    to observe such a sign reversal it is necessary to measure the current correlation function at a long time difference , @xmath154 , when the two - particle scattering matrix can differ from the unit matrix . on the other hand if @xmath155 then the function @xmath110  and hence the current correlation function @xmath82  is small .",
    "how small @xmath110 depends on the ratio of the temperature and @xmath84 . at sufficiently low temperatures , @xmath156 ,",
    "the function @xmath110 has a long - time power law tail [ see , eq.([eq36 ] ) ] while in the opposite limit , @xmath157 , it is exponentially suppressed [ see , eq.([eq34 ] ) ] at large @xmath158 .",
    "one can consider the ratio of the dynamical and the stationary correlation functions and thus eliminate the common small factor @xmath110 .    in the next section",
    "we illustrate these considerations with a simple but generic example .",
    "the most general expression for the stationary scattering matrix @xmath50 for a single - channel two - terminal conductor is ( see , e.g. , ref . ) : @xmath159 here @xmath160 and @xmath111 are the reflection and the transmission probability , respectively ( @xmath161 ) .",
    "we assume that the quantities entering the above equation are functions of the external parameters @xmath162 and hence of time .",
    "we evaluate these quantities at the fermi energy @xmath3 .    to provide a measure of the effect of an oscillatory scatterer more sensitive than the current correlation function itself",
    ", we next introduce the current correlation coefficient @xmath163 .",
    "the correlation coefficient ( which is usual for the standard statistical analysis ) calculated for currents is : @xmath164 this quantity is bounded , @xmath165 , and it characterizes the degree of correlation between the fluctuating currents measured at lead @xmath0 at time moment @xmath95 and at lead @xmath1 at time moment @xmath96 : the currents are fully correlated , anti - correlated , or non - correlated if @xmath166 , respectively .",
    "note that this quantity can not differentiate local ( i.e. , classical ) and non - local ( i.e. , quantum - mechanical ) correlations .    substituting eq.([eq42 ] ) into eq.([eq45 ] ) we obtain : @xmath167    for the two terminal stationary scatterer [ see , eq.([eq43 ] ) ] the matrix of current correlation coefficients @xmath168 ( whose elements are @xmath169 ) becomes independent of properties of the scatterer : @xmath170 while for the oscillatory scatterer we get : @xmath171 the correlation coefficient @xmath172 is sensitive to the phases of reflection and transmission coefficients .",
    "therefore , its behavior is nontrivial , for instance , in the case of a resonance - like structure which we will consider in the next section .    note that at coincident times @xmath173 the coefficient @xmath174 .",
    "this means that the instant - time current correlations in the driven system are exactly the same as in the stationary case .",
    "the adiabatic pump has no effect ( within the accuracy employed ) on the instantaneous correlations .",
    "in contrast , the oscillatory scatterer has a strong effect on current correlations at different times .",
    "in particular , as we will see , such correlations can be suppressed or even their sign can be inverted compared with that of a stationary conductor .      as a model of a resonant transmission pump",
    "we choose a one - dimensional scatterer consisting of two delta function barriers @xmath175 oscillating with frequency @xmath29 and located at @xmath176 and @xmath177 : @xmath178 the quantities @xmath179 and @xmath180 are the pumping parameters .",
    "the stationary scattering matrix is : @xmath181 here @xmath182 ; @xmath183 ( j = 1,2 ) ; @xmath158 = @xmath184 ; @xmath185 = @xmath186 + @xmath187 .",
    "in numerical calculations we use the units @xmath188 .",
    "we take @xmath189 ; @xmath190 ; @xmath191 and choose the fermi energy @xmath3 close to the transmission resonance where the charge @xmath192 pumped for a period at @xmath193 is close to @xmath194 .",
    "we use @xmath195 for which @xmath196 .",
    "we calculate the time dependent currents @xmath197 , @xmath198 and the correlation coefficient @xmath172 for several representative values of the phase difference @xmath199 , and consider how the peculiarities of @xmath172 relate to the peaks in @xmath197 and @xmath198 .    for large amplitude pumps @xcite in the quantized pumping regime the time - averaged current and noise have the following properties : at @xmath200 the dc pumped current is maximum and the zero - frequency noise power is minimum . at both @xmath201 and @xmath202",
    "the dc current is zero .",
    "however the zero - frequency noise power is different . at @xmath202",
    "it is close to the noise at @xmath200 while at @xmath201 the noise is much larger .",
    "first we consider the time - dependent currents , eq.([eq41 ] ) , generated by an oscillating double - barrier pump . in fig.[fig2 ] we give the currents @xmath197 and @xmath198 flowing in different leads . in the quantized pumping regime",
    "the pump generates pulsed currents .",
    "these pulses can be viewed as produced by the particles emitted by the pump . since at different leads the currents peak at different time moments we conclude that the particles ( an electron and a hole ) leave the pump at different time moments .",
    "next we consider @xmath172 . to get a plane graph we fix ,",
    "say , the first argument and consider this coefficient as a function of the second argument .",
    "we fix the first argument at that time moment @xmath204 when the current @xmath205 peaks . from fig.[fig2 ] we get @xmath206 .    in fig.[fig3 ]",
    "we give the correlation coefficient @xmath207 . at @xmath208 the coefficient @xmath209 as it should be .",
    "while at the time moment @xmath210 when the current @xmath211 peaks the coefficient @xmath212 has a negative peak .",
    "note that the correlation coefficient @xmath213 can be obtained from the measurements carried out only at lead @xmath214 .",
    "one needs to measure the current and its auto - correlation function .",
    "nevertheless the negative peak of @xmath207 indicates clearly when the current pulse occurs at another lead , the lead @xmath215 .",
    "it is instructive to compare @xmath213 with the time - dependent transmission coefficient @xmath216 .",
    "the latter is given in fig.[fig4 ] .",
    "the transmission coefficient shows small peaks at those time moments @xmath204 and @xmath217 when the current pulses occur .",
    "however it does not provide information in which lead the current pulse occurs .",
    "moreover @xmath218 shows a large peak when both currents @xmath197 and @xmath198 are small .",
    "therefore , concerning the generated currents the current correlation coefficient @xmath213 provides more relevant information then the transmission probability .    to characterize fully the behavior of @xmath213 we choose a fixed time moment @xmath95 away from a current pulse interval .",
    "such case is illustrated in fig.[fig5 ] .",
    "the abrupt jumps of different sign correspond to current pulses occurring at different leads .      in this case",
    "the time - dependent currents ( see , fig.[fig6 ] ) , are similar to those we considered in the previous section .",
    "the only difference is that for each period the pump produces two electron - hole pairs and pushes one electron ( a positive current pulse ) and one hole ( a negative current pulse ) to each lead . as a result",
    "the dc current is zero .    in fig.[fig7",
    "] we give the correlation coefficient @xmath213 together with the time - dependent transmission coefficient @xmath218 .",
    "though both @xmath213 and @xmath218 peak at those time moments when the current @xmath197 or @xmath198 peaks , only the correlation coefficient @xmath213 provides information concerning the lead through which the current pulse occurs .",
    "if we fix the first argument @xmath220 at that time moment when the current @xmath205 peaks and consider @xmath207 as a function of the second argument @xmath62 then we get the following : at those time moments when the current @xmath205 peaks the coefficient @xmath213 has positive peaks , while at those time moments when the current @xmath211 peaks the coefficient @xmath213 has negative peaks .",
    "however we should note that the correlation coefficient @xmath213 does not distinguish between the negative and positive current pulses occurring at the same lead .",
    "it differentiates only the lead at which the current pulse occurs .      in this regime",
    "the pump still generates approximately one electron - hole pair per each cycle .",
    "the electron and hole leave the scatterer at different time moments .",
    "however , since the potential barriers are the same , @xmath222 , the pump can push a particle into any of the leads with the same probability .",
    "therefore , the pump generates exactly the same currents at both leads , see , fig.[fig8 ] .",
    "note that such an uncertainty in the lead to which the pump pushes a particle results in the large zero - frequency noise mentioned already .    unlike the previously considered cases now both the correlation coefficient @xmath213 and the transmission coefficient @xmath218 show similar behavior , see , fig.[fig9 ] . since at both leads the current pulses occur at the same time moments",
    ", the current correlation coefficient does not show negative peaks .",
    "however @xmath213 still shows a strong effect of an oscillatory pump on current fluctuations .",
    "notice the strong suppression of correlations between the fluctuating currents at a plateau and near a peak .",
    "we explored the current and the noise generated by an adiabatic quantum pump in a system of noninteracting spinless electrons on a time - scale shorter than the pump period @xmath47 .",
    "we used the floquet scattering matrix approach which takes naturally into account the energy absorption and emission of electrons traversing the oscillating scatterer .",
    "such many - photon processes generate ac currents @xmath223 , eq.([eq13a ] ) , at frequencies @xmath38 ( @xmath224 ) which are multiples of a pump frequency .",
    "the many - photon processes also correlate the fluctuating currents at frequencies @xmath30 and @xmath225 shifted by @xmath226 : @xmath227 [ see , eq.([eq13b ] ) ] .",
    "we calculated the current and the current correlation function averaged over a measurement time interval @xmath84 . in the limit of @xmath228",
    "we get the dc current , eq.([eq38 ] ) , and the zero frequency noise power , eq.([eq39 ] ) . while in the opposite limit , @xmath229",
    ", we find the time - dependent current @xmath143 , eq.([eq41 ] ) , and the two - time current correlation function @xmath82 , eq.([eq42 ] ) . in both limits",
    "the time - dependent current and two - time correlations reveal interesting signatures of a dynamical scatterer .",
    "the pump is the only source of currents .",
    "however , in general , it is only one of the sources of noise .",
    "other sources treated in the present paper are the thermal and equilibrium quantum fluctuations of a fermi electron gas . for a long measurement time , @xmath230 , and at relatively low temperature",
    "only the noise produced by the pump is detectable . @xcite",
    "while in a short measurement time limit , @xmath231 , mainly the quantum fluctuations contribute to the noise measured .",
    "unexpectedly , in the latter regime the slow periodic pump dynamics modifies considerably the two - time current - current correlator in a long time difference limit .",
    "the corresponding factor @xmath232 is due to photon assisted quantum exchange playing a role in current fluctuations in many terminal oscillatory conductors .",
    "the experimental investigation of @xmath232 is useful for several reasons : first , it can reveal the presence of physical processes underlying the quantum pump effect .",
    "second , this quantity [ or , alternatively , the correlation coefficient @xmath233 , eq.([eq46 ] ) ] indicates clearly the time moments at which the current pulses generated by the pump occur .",
    "we hope that the investigation of current - current correlations in a dynamically driven scatterer on a time - scale shorter than the period of a pump helps to understand deeper the nature of correlations in particle flows produced by the pump .",
