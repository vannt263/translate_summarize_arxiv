    "this paper is concerned with affine _ orbifold singularities _ , namely with singularities of the type @xmath17 for @xmath6 a finite group acting linearly on @xmath1 .    in",
    "@xcite a method using moduli of invariant hermitian - yang - mills bundles was given for constructing partial resolutions of @xmath18 carrying natural asymptotically locally euclidean ( ale ) metrics .",
    "in this article , the same construction is described in terms of representation moduli of quivers .",
    "this allows a complete description of the moduli to be given for the case of abelian groups using the language of toric varieties .",
    "it turns out that the convex polyhedra describing the moduli are the solutions of a generalisation of a well - known network optimization problem ( the transportation problem ) on the mckay quiver , in which the quiver plays the role of a network where commodities are transported , and the parameter @xmath8 specifies the supplies and demands at each vertex .",
    "the resolution of the kleinian singularities @xmath19 for @xmath6 a finite subgroup of @xmath20 is a classical subject ; their minimal resolution @xmath21 was first constructed by du val , and brieskorn  @xcite showed that the components of the exceptional divisors form graphs which are dual to the homogeneous dynkin diagrams for the lie algebras @xmath22 . in 1980 , mckay  @xcite remarked that this establishes a correspondence between the extended homogeneous dynkin diagrams @xmath23 and the irreducible representations of @xmath6 .",
    "more recently  @xcite another correspondence was constructed between conjugacy classes `` of weight 1 '' and crepant divisors for any quotient singularity generated by a finite subgroup of @xmath24 .    in the case where @xmath25 , dixon , harvey , vafa and witten proposed a definition of the orbifold euler characteristic  @xcite and",
    "conjectured the existence of smooth resolutions with trivial canonical bundle ( i.e.which are crepant ) and whose euler number is given by the dhvw orbifold euler number .",
    "the final cases in the proof of this conjecture were only recently completed @xcite .    for the case",
    "@xmath26 , the author has obtained some interesting analogous results if one considers terminalisations rather than resolutions  @xcite .",
    "a promising link between the representation theory of @xmath0 and the construction of resolutions was established in 1986 ; kronheimer  @xcite constructed a family of hyper - khler  quotients @xmath7 by looking at a dimensional reduction of the hermitian yang - mills ( hym ) equations on a @xmath6-equivariant bundle over @xmath27 .",
    "he used the representation theory of @xmath6 and mckay s observation to prove that , for generic @xmath8 , these quotients are isomorphic to the minimal resolution @xmath21 . the author s thesis  @xcite ( from which the present paper and its companion  @xcite are in large part extracted ) grew out of the ambition to generalise the results as far as possible to dimensions higher than two .    despite the fact that there is little hope for the results for @xmath28 and general @xmath29 to be as strong as those for @xmath20 groups , some of the nice properties of the @xmath20 case generalise to the @xmath28 case .",
    "case  @xcite . ]    in  @xcite several descriptions were given of the generalised construction .",
    "probably the most concise is the one given in  @xcite : construct moduli spaces @xmath3 of instantons on the trivial bundle @xmath30 . here",
    "@xmath31 denotes the regular representation space for the group @xmath0 , and @xmath8 is a linearisation of the bundle action .",
    "the instantons are required to satisfy hermitian - yang - mills - type equations , as well as additional @xmath0-equivariance and translation - invariance properties .    in the present paper , an entirely different view point is adopted , namely that of considering @xmath3 are representation moduli of the mckay quiver .",
    "more precisely , one considers representations @xmath32 of the mckay quiver @xmath33 into the multiplicity space @xmath34 of the regular representation of @xmath0 , subject to certain commutation relations @xmath35 .",
    "a reductive group @xmath36 acts on the above space , and one obtains git quotients @xmath3 which depend on a rational parameter @xmath8 .",
    "this paper assumes that @xmath37 acts on @xmath1 freely outside the origin for any @xmath38 , which means that @xmath17 has an isolated singularity .",
    "the main results are as follows .",
    "firstly , @xmath3 are identified with representation moduli of the mckay quiver .",
    "this is fairly straight - forward and involves mostly translating quiver concepts over to the language used in  @xcite .",
    "there are two further sets of results .",
    "the first is a toric description of the representation variety @xmath32 and its moduli @xmath3 .",
    "the convex polyhedron @xmath39 corresponding to @xmath3 is identified with the projection to @xmath40 of the solution polyhedron for the transportation problem on the mckay quiver .",
    "the transportation problem is a well - known linear network optimization problem  @xcite : given an assignment of real numbers to the vertices of a quiver @xmath33 ( thought of as representing the demand and supply of certain commodities ) , the aim is to find an assignment of non - negative real numbers to the arrows ( a _ flow _ on @xmath33 ) , in such a way that the demands and supplies at each vertex are satisfied ( i.e.the equation @xmath41 holds ) . for any given assignment of weights @xmath8 ,",
    "the solution set is a convex polyhedron inside @xmath42 denoted by @xmath43 .",
    "the notation in use is as follows :    let @xmath6 be the cyclic group of order @xmath44 acting freely outside the origin in @xmath45 with weights @xmath46 i.e.via @xmath47 the mckay quiver @xmath33 of @xmath0 has vertices @xmath48 , and arrows @xmath49 for each @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "let @xmath52 be the map defined by @xmath53 and let @xmath54 be the induced linear map defined by mapping the standard bases .",
    "( here and elsewhere we use the exponential notation @xmath55 .",
    "the standard basis of @xmath42 is given by the `` indicator '' functions @xmath56 defined by @xmath57 if @xmath58 and @xmath59 otherwise ) .",
    "let @xmath60 be the sub - lattice of @xmath61 of index @xmath44 defined by @xmath62 for each element @xmath63 such that @xmath64 , consider the corresponding solution polyhedron @xmath43 to the transportation problem on @xmath33 , and let @xmath65 be its projection to @xmath40 .",
    "adopting the above notation , one can state the first main theorem .",
    "the moduli @xmath3 are isomorphic to the toric varieties @xmath66",
    "where @xmath39 correspond to the projection to @xmath40 of the solution polyhedra to the transportation problem on @xmath33 .",
    "the problem of determining @xmath39 can be considered as a generalised transportation problem .",
    "the solution to the classical transportation problem is well known :    the extreme points of @xmath43 are precisely those flows in @xmath43 whose supports are _ trees _ , i.e.contain no cycles .    the basic idea behind the proof of this theorem is to associate to each cycle @xmath67 a corresponding flow @xmath68 as follows .",
    "a _ cycle _ in @xmath33 is a sequence @xmath69 of arrows such that they form a cycle when their orientation is disregarded .",
    "the disjoint union of the arrows @xmath70 whose direction agrees ( resp.disagrees ) with the ordering @xmath71 is called the _ positive _ ( resp.__negative _ _ ) part of @xmath67 and is denoted it by @xmath72 ( resp.@xmath73 ) .    for each arrow @xmath74",
    ", let @xmath56 denote the flow which takes the value @xmath75 on the arrow @xmath76 and zero elsewhere .",
    "to each cycle @xmath67 , one can define the _ basic flow _ associated to @xmath67 by @xmath77    note that for any cycle @xmath67 , @xmath78 , i.e.the associated flow does not contribute anything at any vertex .",
    "if @xmath79 contains @xmath67 in its support , then one can add @xmath80 to @xmath81 for some small @xmath82 and still remain in @xmath43 .",
    "hence @xmath81 can not be an extreme point .",
    "vice - versa , if @xmath81 is not extreme , then one can reconstruct a cycle in its support .",
    "the generalisation of this theorem to describe the projection @xmath83 is quite straight - forward .",
    "one begins by defining the _ type _ of any given cycle as the element @xmath84 .",
    "cycles of type @xmath85 play a special role , much as ordinary cycles do in the classical case .",

    "two configurations @xmath89 will be called _ equivalent _ ( written @xmath90 ) if @xmath91 .",

    "the extreme points of @xmath39 are the images under @xmath92 of precisely those flows in @xmath43 whose support contains no cycles of non - zero type .",
