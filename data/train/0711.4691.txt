    "the evaluations of the measurable quantities in quantum field theory ( qft ) are well  defined theoretically , but in real calculations appear many obstacles connected with the non - ability to realize the calculations corresponding to the theoretical definitions .",
    "the calculations in qft are usually performed analytically using perturbative calculus , numerically by lattice gauge theory ( lgt ) , or by creating models based on the results of previous methods of calculations .",
    "the perturbative methods give analytical results , but various problems in qft are non - perturbative phenomena , therefore they are applicable for the narrow band of problems only .",
    "lgt , the best method of evaluations in this time , suffers from finiteness of the lattice , problems of definitions of the mathematical objects on the lattice and the continuum limit problems .",
    "we adopt the method of analytical calculations in the continuum to study of the transitions in dense matter .",
    "after short introduction into the problem in the next section we propose in the section 3 the non - perturbative solution of the problem of the evaluation of the functional integral with fourth order term in the action .",
    "we found the result in the form of an asymptotical series , and a method of solution of the problem is described in papers @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the euclidean finite temperature theory is defined by the functional integral for partition function : @xmath2\\ ; \\exp{(-s_e)}\\ ] ] where the euclidean action is defined by : @xmath3 the euclidean color field strength is defined by : @xmath4 we require the periodicity of color potentials in the direction of the imaginary time variable : @xmath5 the theory with corresponding partition function looks like a partition for the finite temperature theory in statistical physics .",
    "this `` isomorphism '' allows us to investigate the qcd problem by methods of statistical physics .",
    "we have concerned on the phase transitions to the quark gluon plasma at high densities of the matter , the one of the challenging forecast of the qcd .",
    "we investigate some problems of the study of this phase transition , usually known as confinement / deconfinement phase transition , in model independent method described bellow",
    ". such description of the confinement problem rely on the conjecture that the infrared sector of the finite temperature theory possesses the same phase structure as the complete theory .",
    "this is the assertion of appelquist - carrazone decoupling theorem @xcite , where it was proven that integrating off massive modes of the theory one obtains terms in the potential controlling dynamics ( in this case the infrared variables ) of the theory . by help of this theorem",
    "we reduce the infinite number of the variables of the original theory to the finite number in the infrared sector effectively describing the phenomena studied .    to evaluate the integration over the massive modes we proceed as follows :    \\1 ) we separate the field variable to the sum of the `` classical '' part and `` quantum fluctuation '' : @xmath6 we use the static gauge for evaluations of the functional integrals over massive modes , the saddle points of the action in this gauge are fixed as : @xmath7 we choose finite @xmath8 in the color space for the simplicity .",
    "\\2 ) the periodicity of the color potentials in the imaginary time variable offers a chance to use fourier transformation of the potentials in this variable .",
    "this operation automatically separates the fourier transforms of the potentials to the infrared , zero frequency modes and massive modes , where nonzero fourier frequency modes ( @xmath9 matsubara frequencies ) appear as mass terms .",

    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , we find in this sector the confinement / deconfinement transition with correct behavior of the potential between heavy quarks calculated as the corellators of polyakov s loops .",

    "the use the gaussian method for evaluations of functional integrals is not sufficient .",
    "preliminary investigations indicate that this transition could be non - continuous , and consequently the lattice formalism may be not powerful also .",
    "we conclude , that one needs a formalism for the evaluations of the functional integrals with a higher power terms in the potential .",
