    "distorted black holes ( bhs ) emit gravitational radiation .",
    "a spectral decomposition of the perturbation response of the schwarzschild @xcite and kerr @xcite geometries using green s function techniques shows that a discrete sum of quasinormal modes ( qnms )  damped oscillations whose frequencies and damping times depend only on the bh mass and angular momentum  will dominate the response at all but very early and very late times . because of the qualitative similarity with a ringing bell , this intermediate stage is known as `` ringdown '' in the gravitational - wave literature @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations show that binary bh mergers in general relativity inevitably result in the formation of a distorted rotating remnant , which radiates ringdown waves while settling down into a stationary ( kerr ) solution of the einstein equations in vacuum . despite the great advances in binary bh simulations in four @xcite and higher dimensions @xcite ,",
    "the excitation of the qnms of the remnant bh resulting from a merger is still poorly understood .",
    "perturbative techniques are especially valuable to understand ringdown excitation in situations that pose a particular challenge to numerical simulations , namely :    \\1 ) _ large mass - ratio binaries .",
    "_ one of the frontiers in numerical simulations of bh mergers are quasicircular binaries with large mass ratios .",
    "progress in this direction has been slow but steady , both in the quasicircular case  where initial record mass ratios @xmath2 @xcite have been broken using `` hybrid '' techniques @xcite  and in the head - on case , where simulations with @xmath3 have recently been performed using different approaches @xcite . in this regime ,",
    "perturbation theory is crucial to validate and/or optimize numerical simulations .",
    "\\2 ) _ large spins .",
    "_ numerical simulations of bh binaries are usually carried out using either the baumgarte - shapiro - sasaki - nakamura ( bssn ) formulation of the einstein equations and a finite - difference scheme , or using the harmonic formulation and spectral methods .",
    "the first class of simulations is limited to dimensionless spins @xmath4 , because this is the maximum spin that can be achieved with puncture initial data @xcite .",
    "initial data with spins as large as @xmath5 can be constructed @xcite and have been evolved using spectral codes @xcite .",
    "these simulations present a significant challenge for modeling efforts using effective - one - body techniques when one considers binaries with aligned spins @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "models of the late merger and ringdown phase can be significantly improved by using first - principle calculations in bh perturbation theory , rather than a phenomenological matching of inspiral waveforms with qnm superpositions of largely arbitrary amplitudes and starting times .",
    "\\3 ) _ higher dimensions .",
    "_ numerical simulations in higher dimensions are very challenging , and simple calculations in bh perturbation theory can give insight into the results of the simulations .",
    "for example , the qualitative behavior of the energy and linear momentum radiated by particles falling into higher - dimensional schwarzschild - tangherlini bhs ( predicted in @xcite ) is in excellent agreement with the first numerical simulations in @xmath7 @xcite : see e.g. @xcite for reviews .",
    "first - principle calculations of qnm excitation in four space - time dimensions would be particularly beneficial in building semianalytical models of the merger / ringdown phase , to be used as matched - filtering templates in gravitational - wave searches .",
    "here we carry out these calculations in four spacetime dimensions considering , for simplicity , head - on particle infalls into schwarzschild and kerr bhs .",
    "our study improves and extends the results of @xcite .",
    "the gravitational radiation from a perturbed kerr bh is usually described in terms of the weyl scalar @xmath8 @xcite , which can be decomposed in different multipolar components ( say @xmath9 ) by using spin - weighted spheroidal harmonics with angular indices @xmath10 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . in the ringdown stage , each @xmath9 can be expressed as a sum of complex exponentials : schematically , _",
    "n=0^c_lmn , where the frequencies @xmath11 are complex , @xmath12 denotes time as measured by an observer at infinity , @xmath13 is a radial `` tortoise '' coordinate , and the index @xmath14 ( `` overtone index '' ) sorts the modes by increasing imaginary part ( @xmath15 corresponding to the smallest imaginary part and to the longest damping time ) . to simplify the notation",
    ", we will sometimes replace the indices @xmath16 by a collective index @xmath17 .",
    "the problem of extracting the qnm contribution to a generic signal was first studied in detail by leaver  @xcite .",
    "the complex amplitudes @xmath1 of each complex exponential , also called `` excitation coefficients '' , depend on the source of the perturbation ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the excitation coefficients can be factorized into the product @xmath18 of a source - independent `` excitation factor '' @xmath0 and of a source - dependent integral @xmath19 .",
    "the integral @xmath19 is in general divergent , but it can be regularized , yielding a finite answer in agreement with other perturbative calculations @xcite .    to illustrate the origin of this factorization , consider the following prototypical ode governing arbitrary perturbations around a bh .",
    "the perturbation is characterized by a wave function @xmath20 with source @xmath21 ( representing for example the perturbation due to infalling matter ) : --v =- q(t ) , where @xmath13 is a radial `` tortoise coordinate '' , and the potential @xmath22 .",
    "the wave function @xmath20 can describe curvature - related quantities in the formalism by sasaki and nakamura @xcite and it is directly related to metric perturbations in the regge - wheeler / zerilli formalism @xcite .",
    "the qnm contribution to the time - domain green s function @xmath23 reads _",
    "q(r_*,t)= ^_-^_-g_q(r_*,t|r_*,t ) q(r_*,t)dr_*dt , where ( see e.g. @xcite ) [ gq ] & & g_q(r_*,t|r_*,t)= + & = & 2 . the coefficients @xmath0 are the ( source - independent ) _ excitation factors _ , and @xmath24 denotes solutions of the homogeneous equation normalized such that @xmath25 as @xmath26 .",
    "it is convenient to introduce also the source - dependent _ excitation coefficients _ @xmath1 : [ cq ] c_q = b_q i_q , + where i_q_-^e^i_qr_*_q(r_*)q(r_*,)dr_*,[eq : source_def ] and where the frequency - domain source term is q(r_*,)=^_- e^itq(r_*,t)dt. the calculation of the @xmath1 s involves an integral in @xmath13 from the horizon ( @xmath27 ) out to spatial infinity ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "the integral usually diverges at the horizon ; one of the proposed methods to eliminate this divergence is discussed below in section [ sec : regularization ] . with these definitions ,",
    "the ringdown waveform can be written as : ( r_*,t)=2 .",
    "as @xmath29 we have @xmath30 , so that [ semianal ] _ q(r_*,t)=2 . to summarize , the complex excitation factors @xmath0 are a `` universal '' intrinsic property of the bh which describes the excitability of each mode , independently of the source of the excitation .",
    "on the other hand , the complex excitation coefficients @xmath1 are related to the amplitude of each qnm in response to a _",
    "specific _ source inducing the oscillations .      in the first part of this paper ( section [ sec : bq ] )",
    "we compute a catalog of qnm excitation factors @xmath0 for kerr bhs using the formalism developed by mano , suzuki and takasugi ( @xcite , henceforth mst ) . by using this technique",
    "we confirm and extend results obtained some years ago by two of us @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of the mst method is that it does not require the ( generally nontrivial ) evaluation of coulomb wave functions , which was instead necessary in @xcite .",
    "this allows us to produce accurate tables of the @xmath0 s for the modes that are most interesting in gravitational - wave detection ( multipolar indices @xmath31 and overtone indices @xmath32 ) .",
    "these tables ( and similar tables for perturbations of spin @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) will be made publicly available on a website , along with a mathematica notebook that can be adapted to generate further tables if necessary @xcite .    in the second part of the paper",
    "we compute the excitation coefficients @xmath1 for a classic problem in perturbation theory : the calculation of the gravitational radiation emitted by particles falling into the bh .",
    "we generalize work carried out by leaver more than 25 years ago @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "whereas leaver considered only infalls from rest into a schwarzschild bh , we present detailed comparisons between numerical waveforms and excitation coefficient calculations for particles falling with arbitrary energy into schwarzschild bhs ( section [ sec : schw ] ) and we also consider the case where the bh is rotating ( section [ sec : kerr ] ) . in section [ sec : conclusions ] we summarize our findings and point out possible directions for future work . appendix [ app : reg ] gives details about the regularization of divergent integrals in both the schwarzschild and kerr cases . in the whole paper we use geometrical units ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "in this section we present a detailed calculation of the excitation factors @xmath0 for kerr qnms .",
    "we follow the mst formalism ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) and we refer to the original papers for a more organic presentation of the material ; our intention here is to give a practical guide to the calculation of the @xmath0 s within this formalism .",
    "the method is different from  but equivalent to ",
    "leaver s method @xcite , that was used by two of us in @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of the mst formalism over leaver s method is that the mst formalism does not require any ( cumbersome ) _ evaluation _ of coulomb wave functions , as in leaver s original treatment , but only a _ matching _ of the coulomb - series expansion near infinity to an expansion in terms of hypergeometric functions near the horizon , which is simpler to perform in practice .",
    "we will compute the excitation factors in both the teukolsky and sasaki - nakamura formalisms ( see @xcite for a discussion ) . to begin with ,",

    "in this section we extend our calculation to particles falling into kerr bhs . for simplicity ,",
    "we consider a particle falling ultrarelativistically along the symmetry axis . in this case",
    "the source term of the sasaki - nakamura equation simplifies considerably @xcite : = -e^-ir _ * [ explicits1 ] , where c_l^a=_0 , and @xmath43 was defined in . the constants @xmath44 were determined by solving the angular eigenvalue problem through a continued fraction representation , and then plugging these eigenvalues into the series solution providing the spheroidal wave functions @xmath45 @xcite . the procedure to determine the time - domain solution of the sasaki - nakamura wave function @xmath46 is identical to that adopted for the schwarzschild case : i.e.",
    ", first we solve the equations in the frequency domain , and then we fourier transform back in time , applying a low - frequency extrapolation when this is necessary to remove memory effects .",
    "figure [ kerrplotsv2 ] ( which is similar to figure [ rest_l2345 ] ) compares the excitation coefficient calculation of eq .",
    "( [ semianal ] )  where now @xmath20 must be understood as the sasaki - nakamura wave function  against numerical gravitational waveforms obtained in this way . as in the schwarzschild case , the integrand appearing in the calculation of the kerr excitation factors is , in general , divergent .",
    "the divergence can be regularized following a procedure analogous to the schwarzschild case ( cf .",
    "appendix [ app : kerrreg ] ) .",
    "figure [ kerrplotsv2 ] confirms our basic findings from the nonrotating case : the convergence of the qnm expansion is not necessarily monotonic , and the excitation coefficient expansion works better for higher values of @xmath47 .",
    "notice that a relatively small number of overtones is sufficient to reproduce the numerical waveform at early times even when the spin of the kerr bh is rather large ( @xmath48 ) , so that one may in principle expect that a larger number of overtones would be necessary ( see e.g. @xcite ) . to our knowledge , the calculation presented in this section is the first concrete proof that an excitation - coefficient expansion is applicable and useful in the kerr case : all calculations available in the literature so far were specific to the schwarzschild case ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in this paper we have implemented a new method , based on the mst formalism , to compute the excitation factors @xmath0 for kerr qnms .",
    "this method is simpler and more accurate than the method used by two of us in @xcite , allowing us to extend the calculation to higher angular multipoles @xmath47 and to higher overtone numbers @xmath14 .",
    "tables of the excitation factors @xmath0 in the teukolsky and sasaki - nakamura formalisms will be made publicly available online @xcite , in the hope to stimulate further research in this field .    as a test of the method ,",
    "we have computed the qnm excitation coefficients for the classic problem of particles falling radially into the bh .",
    "we have compared the excitation coefficient expansion against numerical results for : ( i ) particles falling from rest ( @xmath49 ) into a schwarzschild bh , ( ii ) large - energy particles ( @xmath50 ) falling into a schwarzschild bh , and ( iii ) ultrarelativistic particles falling into a kerr bh along the symmetry axis . in all cases we found excellent agreement , validating the usefulness of excitation coefficient calculations in the analytical modeling of the ringdown phase .    in order of increasing complexity , extensions of this work could consider ( i ) particles falling with arbitrary energy along the @xmath51-axis of a kerr bh , ( ii ) particles with arbitrary energies plunging into kerr bhs along equatorial orbits , ( iii ) generic orbits in schwarzschild or kerr , and ( iv ) possible applications of these calculations to the construction of semianalytical waveform templates for comparable - mass mergers .",
    "we believe that these extensions are crucial for a better understanding of the ringdown phase and ( more ambitiously ) for the construction of gravitational - wave detection templates for comparable - mass bh binaries .",
