    "metal - insulator transitions in strongly correlated systems , especially transition metal oxides still continue to be an important topic of research as new and unusual examples emerge  @xcite .",
    "the transitions in these systems have been understood within the hubbard model  @xcite and arise from a competition between localizing effects controlled by the onsite coulomb interaction strength @xmath3 and electron delocalization effects governed by the bandwidth , @xmath4 . within the hubbard model ,",
    "the system is insulating when @xmath5 is greater than 1 , and a change of this ratio ( across 1 ) by doping , external pressure etc .",
    "are routes by which one can induce a metal - insulator transition .",
    "while a lot of examples exist among the 3@xmath0 oxides , there are very few insulating members among the 4@xmath0 and 5@xmath0 perovskite oxides .",
    "the larger spatial extent of the 4@xmath0 and the 5@xmath0 orbitals results in a larger bandwidth , and the additional screening effects present in these larger bandwidth oxides are expected to result in a reduced @xmath3 .",
    "consequently , the smaller @xmath5 ratio , expected to be less than 1 , explains the metallic ground states observed in most cases .",
    "the few insulating examples that one finds there , require some other mechanism than the mott transition to explain the ground state character .",
    "recently , shi _ et al .",
    "_ found a metal - insulator transition in naoso@xmath1 at 410 k  @xcite , which has been observed as arising from the onset of antiferromagnetic order , thus the system is a perfect illustration of slater insulator  @xcite . very recent neutron and x - ray scattering studies and optical spectroscopy",
    "further confirm the picture of a slater transition in this compound  @xcite . as any long range magnetic order requires correlated electrons",
    ", it is rather a surprise , that the magnetic transition temperature of naoso@xmath1 is so high ( 410 k ) .",
    "local magnetic moments are usually very small in 5@xmath0 oxides as a result of the wide bands , so large ordering temperatures are quite unexpected .    the basic electronic structure of naoso@xmath1 has been calculated before  @xcite , though the key question of why one has such a high ordering temperature in a 5@xmath0 oxide is still not well understood .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite recently showed that inspite of os being a 5@xmath0 transition metal atom , spin - orbit interactions seem to have a weak effect on the band structure in naoso@xmath1 .",
    "the states near the fermi level seem to be strongly itinerant with a strong admixture of os @xmath0 and o @xmath6 states suggesting that the appropriate picture of magnetism seems to be an itinerant one .",
    "further , they conclude by saying that the magnetic ordering as well as coulomb interactions play a role in making naoso@xmath1 insulating . the nature of magnetism and the origin of the insulating state has been raised by jung _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . considering a cubic ideal perovskite structure for naoso@xmath1",
    ", they find that a small rotation of the oso@xmath7 octahedra is able to drive naoso@xmath1 insulating as well as stabilize g - type antiferromagnetic ordering .",
    "consequently , this should be characterized by a spin spiral vector @xmath8=0 in contrast to a fermi surface nesting or hot spot driven magnetic transitions which are characterised by a non - zero nesting vector .",
    "this makes the nature of the observed magnetic transition in naoso@xmath1 even more puzzling , though slater made the observation in his seminal paper  @xcite that the up and down spin electrons see different potentials , and by that definition , even a transition characterized by a @xmath8=0 spin spiral vector should fit in as a slater transition .    in the present work ,",
    "we have calculated the electronic and magnetic structure of naoso@xmath1 within gga based ab - initio electronic structure calculations .",
    "both the g - afm ground state as well as its insulating nature are captured within these calculations . in order to understand the origin of the magnetic state ,",
    "we perform further analysis within a multiband hubbard model where the tight binding part is determined from a fitting of the ab - initio band structure . at a @xmath3 of just 0.8 ev , one is able to stabilize an insulating g - afm state as the ground state .",
    "this scale of @xmath3 is far less than the bandwidth of @xmath9 3 ev , suggesting that the scale of @xmath3 is irrelevant , and we have been able to capture the slater insulator limit within our calculations . varying @xmath3 and the charge transfer energy , one finds a wide range of parameter space for which the g type afm solution is the ground state indicating the robustness of the magnetism .",
    "the origin of the magnetism can be traced back to the strong bonding - antibonding splitting arising from the interaction between nearest neighbor os atoms . as the @xmath10 levels are half - filled here ,",
    "this energy gain is possible only for an antiferromagnetic configuration , while in the fully spin polarised limit the ferromagnetic configuration has no energy gain associated with it .",
    "surprisingly , the small intraatomic exchange splitting and the large bandwidth aid to stabilize the magnetic state more as we pointed out in an earlier work  @xcite , though the naive expectation would be that it destabilizes magnetism .",
    "this picture is further strengthened by our studies carried out as a function of doping.while the filling should be important in a model where magnetism is nesting - driven , in the present case we find that the g - type antiferromagnetism is robust even away from half - filling , though the ground state now becomes metallic . examining the exchange interaction strengths in the doped systems , we find an additive nature of the magnetic interactions emerges , with the partial filling of the os @xmath0 @xmath10 minority spin levels contributing a ferromagnetic component .",
    "this route is also suggestive of a clean route to obtain an antiferromagnetic metal as there is no strong electron - phonon coupling physics to be found here .",
    "the mechanism for magnetism proposed here for naoso@xmath1 is similar what we had shown earlier  @xcite for a wide variety of compounds which include srtco@xmath1  @xcite , catco@xmath1  @xcite etc .",
    "though naoso@xmath1 has much smaller @xmath11 ( 410 k ) compared to srtco@xmath1 ( 1023 k ) .",
    "this difference has been explained in the present work by a study of the variation of the effective exchange interaction strengths @xmath2 as a function of @xmath3 .",

    "we have used a sphere of radius 1.44   about os , 1.66   about na and 0.73   about o for the calculation of the partial density of states as well the magnetic moment . in order to understand the origin of the observed magnetic stability and its dependence on microscopic parameters @xmath3 , charge transfer energy ( @xmath14 ) , we carried out additional analysis in terms of a multiband hubbard - like hamiltonian given by equation 1 .",

    "<S> the origin of a high neel temperature in a 5@xmath0 oxide , naoso@xmath1 , has been analyzed within the mean - field limit of a multiband hubbard model and compared with the analogous 4@xmath0 oxide , srtco@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis shows that there are a lot of similarities in both these oxides on the dependence of the the effective exchange interaction strength ( @xmath2 ) on the electron - electron interaction strength ( @xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , the relevant value of @xmath3 in each system puts them in different portions of the parameter space . </S>",
    "<S> although the neel temperature for naoso@xmath1 is less than that for srtco@xmath1 , our results suggest that there could be examples among other 5@xmath0 oxides which have a higher neel temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we have also examined the stability of the g - type antiferromagnetic state found in naoso@xmath1 as a function of electron doping within gga+u calculations and find a robust g - type antiferromagnetic metallic state stabilized . </S>",
    "<S> the most surprising aspect of the doped results is the rigid band - like evolution of the electronic structure which indicates that the magnetism in naoso@xmath1 is not driven by fermi surface nesting .    </S>",
