    "a borel measure @xmath1 on @xmath2 is said to be _ doubling _ if there is a constant @xmath5 such that for any @xmath6 and @xmath7 we have @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the ball @xmath10 a _ rectifiable curve _ is a continuous map @xmath11\\to{\\mathbb { r}}^d$ ] with @xmath12 by reparametrization , one may assume that @xmath13 is lipschitz with constant equal to @xmath14 .",
    "we will also make use of the following simple ( and well - known ) criterion : a compact set @xmath3 is the image of a rectifiable curve if and only if it is connected and @xmath15 .",
    "indeed , one may choose @xmath13 so that @xmath16 ; see , for example , @xcite . here and below",
    ", @xmath17 denotes the one - dimensional hausdorff measure .",
    "the purpose of this note is to prove    [ t:1 ] let @xmath0 .",
    "there exists a doubling measure @xmath1 on @xmath2 and a rectifiable curve @xmath3 such that @xmath4 .",
    "we note that doubling measures can not charge even slightly more regular curves ; indeed the authors initial belief was that a rectifiable curve could not carry any weight .",
    "as discussed in @xcite doubling measures give zero weight to any smooth hyper - surface .",
    "the argument , based on lebesgue s density theorem ( for @xmath1 ) , adapts without difficulty to show that for any connected set  @xmath3 , @xmath18 therefore if @xmath3 is a rectifiable curve , then @xmath19 must be singular to @xmath20 .",
    "similarly , no doubling measure can charge an ahlfors regular curve .",
    "we will prove theorem  [ t:1 ] by explicitly constructing a measure and a rectifiable curve .",
    "the question of whether a doubling measure can charge a rectifiable curve was posed to the third author by mario bonk .",
    "it seems to have been communicated to several people also by saara lehto and kevin wildrick , and may have originated with the late juha heinonen .",
    "we are grateful to jonas azzam for a valuable critique of our original approach to this problem .",
    "while working on this paper we were supported in part by various nsf grants : john garnett , by dms-0758619 and dms-0714945 , rowan killip , by dms-0401277 and dms-0701085 , and raanan schul , by dms-0800837 ( renamed to dms-0965766 ) and dms-0502747 .",
    "part of the work on this paper was done while the first author was a guest at the centre de recerca matemtica in barcelona .",
    "our measure @xmath1 will be the @xmath21-fold product of a doubling measure @xmath22 on @xmath23",
    ". the latter is constructed by a simple iterative procedure that we will now describe .",
    "it may be viewed as a variant of the classic riesz product construction and a ` lift the middle ' idea of kahane ( cf .",
    "a very general form of this construction appears in @xcite .      by viewing points @xmath31 in terms of their ternary ( i.e. , base 3 ) expansion",
    ", we may interpret @xmath22 as the result of a sequence of independent trials .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath32 denote the collection of triadic intervals of size @xmath33 , that is , @xmath34 then the measure of a triadic interval @xmath35 is related to that of its parent @xmath36 , the unique interval in @xmath37 containing @xmath38 , by @xmath39 coupled with the fact that @xmath40 for @xmath41 , condition ( 2.2 ) uniquely determines @xmath22 .",
    "in particular , we note that if @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 are integers , then @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the number of times the digit @xmath25 appears in the ternary expansion of @xmath47 .",
    "we claim that @xmath22 is a doubling measure on @xmath23 .",
    "first let @xmath38 and @xmath48 be adjacent triadic intervals of equal size .",
    "by we have that @xmath49 .",
    "several applications of this shows that @xmath50 for any pair @xmath38 and @xmath48 of adjacent intervals of equal size . thus @xmath22 is doubling .",
    "let @xmath1 be the product measure @xmath51 on @xmath2 .",
    "this is a doubling measure : @xmath52 for any @xmath21 pairs of identical or adjacent intervals @xmath53 that obey @xmath54 .",
    "indeed , this holds even without the requirement that @xmath55 for @xmath56 .",
    "given integer parameters @xmath57 , we define @xmath58 via @xmath59 equivalently , if @xmath60 , @xmath61 is the set of those @xmath62 whose ternary expansion contains at most @xmath63 zeros or twos amongst the first @xmath64 digits .          choosing @xmath83 and @xmath84 and sending @xmath85 , we see by lemma 2.2 that @xmath22 gives all its weight to a set of hausdorff dimension @xmath86 .",
    "the precise dimension of @xmath22 is not important to us ; however , we will exploit the fact that it can be made as small as we wish by sending @xmath87 .",
    "indeed , the product measure @xmath1 can not charge a set of hausdorff dimension one ( not to mention a rectifiable curve ) unless @xmath22 gives positive weight to a set of dimension @xmath88 or smaller .    by definition , @xmath61 is a union of intervals from @xmath32 .",
    "correspondingly , the @xmath21-fold cartesian product @xmath89 can be viewed as a union of triadic cubes @xmath90 ( with side - length @xmath33 ) .",
    "we denote this collection of cubes by @xmath91 . by  ,",
    "@xmath92}\\ ] ] similarly , we write @xmath93 for the gaps in @xmath61 , that is , the bounded connected components of @xmath94 .",
    "as each gap has a right end - point , gives @xmath95}.\\ ] ] note also that @xmath96 , as @xmath97 .",
    "we now define a curve @xmath98 which visits each cube @xmath99 .",
    "actually , we merely construct a connected family of line segments @xmath100 that do this , and bound its total length .",
    "as noted in the introduction , all segments in @xmath100 can be traversed by a single curve of comparable total length .",
    "the family @xmath100 is the union of skeletons of rectangular boxes , where we define the _ skeleton _ of a box is @xmath101 thus @xmath102 is the union of the edges  as opposed to vertices , faces , 3-faces , etc .",
    " of the box @xmath103 . with this notation ,",
    "@xmath104 note that @xmath100 is connected .",
    "we now estimate the total length of this set .      by and ,",
