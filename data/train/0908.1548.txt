    "most people who had a chance to play with magnets are aware of the fact that the magnets attract each other when held in two different orientations , but very few will be able to establish that one of the forces of attraction is exactly twice as large as the one in the weaker configuration .",
    "this simple fact is hidden in the well known formula for the dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "many students meet quite early this dipole - dipole potential energy when they are taught electrostatics or magnetostatics , and it is also a very popular formula , featured in the encyclopedias ( on the web as well as on the paper ) . in our research",
    "this formula is also used for certain types of molecular interactions .",
    "the dipole - dipole formula is @xmath0     \\label{standard_dipole_dipole}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the vector connecting the two dipoles .",
    "the constant @xmath2 is very different for magnetic and electric dipoles and we shall not specify it at all in the present discussion . though we discuss mainly the magnetic dipoles because they are easily represented by small magnets , the geometrical features are exactly the same for the electric dipoles .",
    "the formula looks rather uninviting , but obviously it contains the truth about the interaction , and when needed it does its job very well .",
    "sometimes it appears as especially ugly species which might even contain different inverse powers , as @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "people who are familiar with the model of interatomic interaction , the lenard - jones potential , which also features the difference of two powers , might then wonder if there is something untold about minimum or maximum naturally , one should remember that in the dipole - dipole case the two powers are only an artefact of a sort of economic notation .",
    "the idea of the discussed transformation probably occured to many people , but in our case a happy coincidence was the presence of the two small magnets used for posting the anouncements on the news board , which gave the idea a practical test , as descibed below .",
    "the formula describes the potential energy , the forces on the bodies carrying the dipoles and the torques on the dipoles will depend on the physical arrangements and there are too many possibilities . in the whole paper",
    "we simply consider only the situation that the directions of the two dipoles are kept fixed , which means that the forces on the two bodies are given only by the gradient of the radial part , which is indeed very simple .",
    "the torques on the dipoles and their effects may be spectacular and fascinating , but they are not a part of this discussion .",
    "this short note is a result of our observations , and we really think that the suggested new form is suitable for presentation to even younger students . besides , we present a toy to illustrate the formula .",
    "further , an analogue of the trick shown here can be used to draw field lines of a dipole .",
    "moreover , we think that this much more intuitive formula and the physical features which it so clearly displays , will be of use in explanations and discussions in the interdisciplinary field of molecular dynamics applications - and sometimes perhaps even in chemistry .    the standard form of the dipole - dipole interaction energy formula ( repeated from eq . [ standard_dipole_dipole ] ) is @xmath0\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the vector connecting the 2 dipoles . if @xmath5 we can decompose both of the dipoles into two components and write @xmath6 with this notation the interaction energy of equation [ standard_dipole_dipole ] can be written as @xmath7         \\label{new_dipole_formula}\\ ] ] thus we see that the attraction can happen if the @xmath8 is negative , i.e. pointing against each other , and then only with factor one ; or , as is the more well known fact , if the two moments are parallel in the same direction , i.e. the factor @xmath9 dominates .",
    "it is naturally true that the standard formula does not need any additional definition of the perpendicular components and as before should probably remain the standard notation when no geometrical analysis is involved .",
    "the pictures below show the two small magnets which we have by chance found on a magnetic board .",
    "the magnets were made in an unexpected way , having the south - north axis not along the length , as expected , but in the direction shown in the figures .",
    "this makes it very attractive to explore the geometrical properties of the interaction .",
    "the attraction is too strong to be able to appreciate the difference between the `` two terms '' , but the repulsion can nicely be explored when the magnets are placed on paper and lightly manipulated by the fingers .    from the potential formula",
    "follows that the forces go as inverse fourth power of distance if the geometry is fixed . if the terms for the two configurations differ by factor two , they will be equally strong at distances related by fourth root of 2 , i.e. 1.1892 , which makes the difference about 20 per cent ( 18.92 per cent ) .",
    "this can actually be experienced , when we use the notepad paper , as shown on the photos of figure [ lab.fig.strong-rep ] .",
    "the distance at which our magnets `` stop repelling '' , i.e. when the friction takes over , is about 2 cm , thus the 20 per cent are easily seen .",
    "it should be however remarked , that the dipole formula itself might not be fully valid due to the physical extension of the magnets as compared to the distances involved .",
    "it should be explained to the audience that it is used here only for the purpose of the demonstration , while precise measurements and analysis should be used in real studies of magnetic interactions .",
    "the magic angle is used usually for the configuration where the two dipoles do not interact , i.e. it becomes zero .",
    "it can happen in the case that the two dipoles are parallel , one is placed in the origin , both point in `` the z - direction '' while their connecting    vector s polar angle @xmath10 defines the parallel and perpendicular components as @xmath11 and the same for the second dipole @xmath12 .",
    "since the dipoles are parallel , the scalar products in the paranthesis reduce to @xmath13 and this gives the condition for the magic angle @xmath14 this gives the magic angle 54.74 degrees . in the literature this angle is usually derived from the original formula where number 3 appears which leads simply to the condition @xmath15 giving naturally the same magic angle .",
    "the formula for the strength of magnetic field of the dipole @xmath16 placed at the origin is @xmath17 and it invites to similar rewriting , as @xmath18 this is again much simpler , and leads to the following suggestions for the visualizations of the field .",
    "this is the prescription :    * draw the dipole vector .",
    "make the line to a point in plane * transfer the dipole vector and decompose it in components along and perpendicular to the connecting line * add together the twice the projection along the position vector and add the reverse ( negative ) of the perpendicular part .",
    "this gives the tangential line .",
    "* move along this direction - and start the next point    this makes fast constructins in e.g. matlab possible .",
    "( note : if somebody had the same idea of rewriting as presented here , a natural place to look for it would probably be in the source files of simple graphics for field lines . )    the magnetic field of the dipole is also discussed at the physics part of eric weisstein s science encyclopedia at wolfram research pages ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) . here",
    "we have found the only place on the web which does not contain the factor 3 , but factor 2 as in our present discussed formula ( but the entry is very brief with no discussion ) .",
    "the two formulae there read @xmath19 here @xmath20 and @xmath21 are unit vectors along the position vector and perpendicular to it , respectively . due to their sign convention the minus sign essential in our discussion is unfortunately turned into a plus sign and the entry is too brief to include any interpretation .",
    "note also that the units used are not specified .",
    "fortunately , when compiling the final version of this paper we were given a reference to a published discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite which includes correct units and a short discussion , but still without any interpretation along the lines of this paper .",
    "the purpose of this section is to demonstrate how a very straightforward treatment of the electric dipole - dipole interaction from the model of two pairs of charges shown in figure [ lab.fig.dipole-taylor ] leads directly to the standard dipole - dipole formula of equation [ standard_dipole_dipole ] .",
    "as is well known , the dipole formula is obtained in a limiting process , where the displacements are let to tend to zero while the the product of charge and displacement , the dipole moment , is kept constant .",
    "the coulomb interaction between the two pairs of charges can be written as ( now we leave the units out alltogether ) @xmath22    to obtain the formula for dipole - dipole interaction we need to consider a case where @xmath23 and @xmath23 .",
    "up to the second term in taylor expansion for 2-variables : @xmath24 @xmath25\\ ] ] in vector notation @xmath26\\ ] ] the first order terms disappear due to the symmetry of the terms , thus we only need to consider the second order terms .",
    "the @xmath27 is @xmath28 thus we wish to obtain the vector formula for @xmath29 from the very simple non - vector notation @xmath30 = \\frac{\\partial^{}}{\\partial x_i } \\left [ \\frac{- x_j}{\\left (     \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 } \\right)^3 }   \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\          & = &      \\left [ \\frac{- 1}{\\left ( \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 } \\right)^3 }      \\frac{\\partial^ { } x_j}{\\partial x_i } - x_j   \\frac{\\partial^{}}{\\partial     x_i } \\left ( \\frac{1}{\\left ( \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 } \\right)^3 } \\right ) \\right ]   \\nonumber \\\\   & = &               \\left [ \\frac{- 1}{\\left ( \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 } \\right)^3 }     \\delta _ { { ij } } + 3 x_j   \\left ( \\frac{x_i}{\\left ( \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 }     \\right)^5 }",
    "\\right ) \\right ]                                   \\label{dipole_expansion } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from this formula it is then not difficult to show , comparing with the above vector form that taylor expansion of @xmath31 where ( with @xmath32 and @xmath33 the direction unit vectors of the charge displacements in each dipole ) @xmath34 with the definitions of the dipole moments ( note that the product @xmath35 gives the size of the dipole moment , which is kept constant in the limiting process , meaning that while @xmath36 approaches zero , the charges @xmath37 must grow correspondingly ) @xmath38 the above derivation in equations [ dipole_expansion ] leads directly to form of the starting formula [ standard_dipole_dipole ] .",
    "@xmath39\\ ] ] the above derivation possibly explains why the usual formula is a straightforward choice , and there seems no need to transform the expression .",
    "this might have contributed to a general acceptance of the standard formula as the only reasonable choice .",
    "also , the standard formula does not need any additional definition of the perpendicular components and appears as a most general coordinate system independent expression .",
    "hopefully , this paper has shown that there indeed are some advantages in transformations and rearrangements of the standard formula for dipole - dipole interaction as well as the related vector fields .",
    "the dipole - dipole interaction formula has been shown to contain a possibility to be transformed to a much more intuitive form .",
    "we have shown the applications which are suitable for teaching and illustrations .",
    "it appears however that also in research applications the insight provided by this simple transformation of the standard formula might contribute to more intuitive presentations and discussions .",
    "the transformation itself is really very elementary and it is thus rather surprizing that it has not been discussed earlier .",
    "in fact , while preparing the final version of this paper , we have by chance found a new textbook of quantum chemistry @xcite showing a version similar to ours here , but in a component form .",
    "this form appears to the author to be unsafely coordinate system dependent and is thus immediately replaced by `` waterproof '' form of which is the standard of equation [ standard_dipole_dipole ] .",
    "we would like to thank prof lars egil helseth at university of bergen for very helpful and enlightening discussion and suggestions .",
