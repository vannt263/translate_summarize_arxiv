    "the spatial curvature of the universe is one of the most fundamental issues in modern cosmology . specifically , on one hand , estimating the curvature of the universe is a robust way to test the important assumption that the universe is exactly described by the homogeneous and isotropic friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) metric . on the other hand ,",
    "the curvature of the universe is also closely related to some other important problems such as the evolution of the universe and the nature of dark energy .",
    "for instance , nonzero curvature may result in enormous effects on reconstructing the state equation of dark energy even though the true curvature might be very small @xcite , and any significant deviation from the flat case would lead to profound consequences for inflation models and fundamental physics .",
    "moreover , possibilities for the failure of the flrw approximation have been proposed to account for the observed late - time accelerated expansion @xcite .",
    "therefore , observational constraints on the cosmic curvature from popular probes have been extensively studied in the literature @xcite .",
    "we emphasize here that , a spatially flat universe in the framework of the standard @xmath2cdm model is favored at very high confidence level by the latest _ planck _",
    "2015 results of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) observations @xcite",
    ". however , all these works did not measure the curvature in any direct geometric way .",
    "that is , curvature is primarily derived from a measurement of the angular diameter distance to recombination , which not only depends on curvature but also on the choice of cosmological model assumed in the analysis .",
    "recently , @xcite proposed to measure the spatial curvature of the universe or even test the flrw metric in a model - independent way by combining observations of expansion rate and distance , which has been fully implemented with updated observational data  @xcite . in this method ,",
    "derivative of distance with respect to redshift @xmath3 is necessary to estimate the curvature , this treatment introduces a large uncertainty .",
    "therefore , @xcite improved this method by confronting the distances derived from expansion rate and baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) observations .",
    "however , the angular diameter distance data and some expansion rate measures used in their analysis are obtained from bao observations , which are dependent on the assumed fiducial cosmological model and the prior for the distance to the last - scattering surface from cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) measurements .",
    "another method was also put forward to attain a similar test by using parallax distances and angular diameter distances  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the cross - correlation between foreground mass and gravitational shear of background galaxies has been proposed to be a practical measurement of the curvature of the universe , which purely relies on the properties of the flrw metric  @xcite .",
    "more recently , the sum rule of distances along null geodesics of the flrw metric has been put forth as a consistency test  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that , on one hand , the flrw background will be ruled out if the sum rule is violated ; on the other hand , if the observational data is well consistent with the sum rule , the test provides a model - independent estimation of the spatial curvature of the universe . in their analysis , by using the union2.1 compilation of type ia supernova ( sne ia )  @xcite and strong gravitational lensing data selected from the sloan lens acs survey  @xcite , the spatial curvature parameter was weakly constrained to be @xmath4 at @xmath5 confidence level , which slightly favors a spatial closed universe . actually , the distances used in their analysis from the union2.1 sn ia are not completely cosmology - free , since the light - curve fitting parameters accounting for distance estimation are determined from a global fit in the assumed standard dark energy model with the equation of state being constant .",
    "although such an effect is likely subdominant to the uncertainties , the measurement of spatial curvature was not so cosmological - model - independent as they claimed .",
    "moreover , for the distance sum rule ( the eq . 4 in @xcite ) used to calculate the spatial curvature , it is argued that this formula is only valid for the case of @xmath6  @xcite .    in this paper , firstly , we reconstruct a function of hubble parameter with respect to redshift @xmath3 from expansion rate measures of cosmic chronometers ( or standard clocks ) by using a non - parametric smoothing method ( @xcite : nps hereafter ) . this reconstructed function enablse us to directly get the comoving distance by calculating the integral of it .",
    "next , with the spatial curvature parameter taken into consideration , we transform these comoving distances into curvature - dependent luminosity distances . then , by confronting them with luminosity distances depending on light - curve fitting parameters from sne ia observations , we achieve cosmological model - independent constraints on the spatial curvature . for the union2.1 sn ia , we obtain @xmath0 .",
    "when the latest jla sn ia  @xcite is used , the spatial curvature is constrained to be @xmath1 .",
    "on one hand , these results consistently favor a spatially flat universe . on the other hand , in the context of model - independent estimations for spatial curvature ,",
    "these constraints are comparable in terms of precision .",
    "the expansion rate at any redshifts @xmath7 , @xmath8 where @xmath9 , can be obtained from the derivative of redshift with respect to cosmic time , i.e. , @xmath10 .",
    "the difficulty of this approach is to estimate the change in the age of the universe as a function of redshift @xmath11 .",
    "@xcite proposed to make this method practicable by calculating the age difference between two luminous red galaxies at different redshifts . in the literature , this method is usually referred to as differential age ( da ) and the passively evolving galaxies from which @xmath11 is estimated are called cosmic chronometers .",
    "so far , 22 measurements of @xmath12 based on this method ( in the redshift range @xmath13 ) have been obtained  @xcite .",
    "although cosmological model - independent , some of these estimates are sensitive to stellar population synthesis models whose influence on @xmath11 . it was found that this influence becomes important at @xmath14  @xcite . therefore , we consider only 16 @xmath12 measurements in the range @xmath15 which , in practice , given the redshift distribution of the @xmath12 data , means @xmath16 .",
    "in addition , we also slightly increase ( 20% ) the error bar of the highest-@xmath3 point to account for the uncertainties of the stellar population synthesis models  @xcite .",
    "this ensures that the evolution of the reconstructed hubble parameter as a function of redshift in the following analysis is neither dependent on the cosmology nor on the stellar population synthesis model .    in  @xcite , we reconstructed a reasonable function of hubble parameter versus redshift with the nps method , which is an improved version of the smoothing process proposed by  @xcite .",
    "the 16 expansion rate measurements of cosmic chronometers and the reconstructed function with @xmath17 confidence region are shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . as proposed in  @xcite , by extrapolating this function to redshift @xmath18 , we can obtain the model - independent determination of the hubble constant , @xmath19 , from intermediate redshift cosmic chronometers observations . in their analysis , using the gaussian processes  @xcite , they obtained a lower @xmath19 than the cmb value and hence reinforced the tension with the local measurement . here , we find @xmath20 , which is in an agreement with both the latest cmb value  @xcite and local measurement  @xcite . for consistency , this extrapolated @xmath19 is also used for distance estimation in the following analysis .",
    "enlightened by the method which roughly transforms discrete @xmath12 measurements into comoving distances by solving the integral with a simple trapezoidal rule  @xcite , we obtain the comoving distances at @xmath15 by integrating the smoothed function of hubble parameter with respect to redshift .",
    "it is known that the comoving distance @xmath21 connects the luminosity distance @xmath22 via  @xcite , @xmath23}&\\omega_k>0\\\\d_\\mathrm{c } & \\omega_k=0\\\\ \\frac{d_\\mathrm{h}}{\\sqrt{\\left| \\omega_k \\right| } } \\sin{[\\sqrt{\\left| \\omega_k \\right|}d_\\mathrm{c}/d_\\mathrm{h}]}&\\omega_k<0 , \\end{cases}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the speed of light . with the extrapolated @xmath19",
    ", we obtain the curvature - free @xmath26 and the result is presented in the middle panel of fig .",
    "moreover , in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we illustrate the dependence of distance modulus , @xmath27 + 25 $ ] , derived from cosmic chronometers observations on the spatial curvature .     +      the distance estimation from sne ia data is on the basis of the empirical observation that these events form a homogeneous class whose remaining variability is reasonably well captured by two parameters .",
    "one of them describes the time stretching of the light - curve ( @xmath28 ) whereas the other describes the sne ia color at maximum brightness ( @xmath25 ) . for the popular union2.1 sn ia  @xcite , where the salt2 model is used to reconstruct light - curve parameters ( @xmath28 , @xmath25 , and the observed peak magnitude in rest frame @xmath29 band @xmath30 )",
    ", the distance estimator assumes that sne ia with identical color , shape , and galactic environment have on average the same intrinsic luminosity at all redshifts .",
    "this assumption can yield a linear expression to standardize the distance modulus , @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are nuisance parameters which characterize the stretch - luminosity and color - luminosity relationships , reflecting the well - known broader - brighter and bluer - brighter relationships , respectively .",
    "the value of @xmath34 is another nuisance parameter which represents the absolute magnitude of a fiducial sne .",
    "in addition , the term @xmath35 with @xmath36 is introduced to account for the host - mass correction to sne ia luminosities  @xcite .    in the latest jla sn ia  @xcite ,",
    "light - curve parameters are also obtained with the salt2 model and the distance modulus is estimated by a similar expression of the eq .",
    "[ eq2 ] but without the term of host - mass correction .",
    "alternatively , they approximately correct for the effect of dependence of absolute magnitude @xmath34 on properties of host galaxies , e.g. , the host stellar mass ( @xmath37 ) , with a simple step function when the mechanism is not fully understood  @xcite , @xmath38    in general , the light - curve fitting parameters , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , and @xmath39 are left as free parameters being determined in the global fit to the hubble diagram in the framework of the standard dark energy model .",
    "this treatment results in the dependence of distance estimation on the cosmological model used in the analysis .",
    "therefore , implications derived from sne ia observations with the light - curve fitting parameters determined in the global fit to the hubble diagram are somewhat cosmological - model - dependent .",
    "in order to achieve model - independent estimation for the cosmic curvature , rather than using the distance modulus versus redshift data published in conventional sne ia samples , we confront light - curve fitting parameters - dependent distances in eq .  [ eq2 ] with curvature - dependent ones from cosmic chronometers observations in eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] by maximizing the following likelihood : @xmath40,\\ ] ] where @xmath41 stands for parameters in sne ia distance estimation , including light - curve fitting parameters ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) and paremeters connecting to the intrinsic luminosity ( @xmath34 and @xmath39 , or @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) , @xmath44 accounts for error in sne ia observations propagated from the covariance matrix  @xcite . in our analysis , we use the covariance matrix with both the reported statistical and systematic errors .",
    "then , we use emcee introduced by  @xcite , a python module that includes markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) , to get the best - fit values and their corresponding uncertainties for both @xmath45 and parameters in sne ia distance estimation by generating sample points of the probability distribution .    for the union2.1 sn ia , 563 well - measured sne ia events remain for the likelihood estimation because of the redshift cutoff @xmath46 for distance derived from expansion rate measurements .",

    "[ fig2 ] and summarized in tab .",
    "we find that , from the union2.1 sne ia and cosmic chronometers observations , model - independent estimation for the spatial curvature is @xmath0 .",
    "this is in full agreement with the constraints obtained from the latest @xmath47 cmb measurements  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the precision of this estimation is more competitive than the model - independent test based on the distance sum rule  @xcite .",
