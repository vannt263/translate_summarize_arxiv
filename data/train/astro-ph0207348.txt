    ", the detection of pms stars as members of star clusters offers an advantage over the observation of individual stars in more extended star forming regions . this advantage leads to accurate colors and luminosities for the possible pms members of open clusters with well defined constraints on age and mass .",
    "the aim of this paper is to describe 37 new emission line objects along the line of sight to the galactic open cluster ngc  6871 .",
    "we identify these stars from a program to measure accurate spectral types , to derive the reddening , to separate cluster members from foreground and background stars , and to construct the hertzsprung - russell diagram ( hrd ) for cluster members .",

    "younger clusters with ages of @xmath7 yr are often embedded in a bright nebulosity or a dark molecular cloud .",
    "most of the young stars in these clusters have circumstellar disks @xcite .",
    "older star clusters with ages of @xmath8 yr have little nebulosity or molecular gas .",
    "few stars in these cluster have disks @xcite . in ngc  6871",
    ", the lack of significant nebulosity or molecular gas allows optical spectroscopic observations to derive spectral types and luminosities of cluster members , and to measure ir excesses from circumstellar disks .",
    "optical data provide a reliable measurement of the imf for comparison with other young clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "recent work suggests that circumstellar disks disappear on timescales of 5 - 10 myr @xcite .",
    "observations of ir excess emission in ngc6871 thus yield better constraints on disk timescale .",
    "ngc  6871 has been relatively well studied photometrically .",
    "the cluster is part of the cyg ob3 association @xcite , one of the largest nearby star formation complexes .",
    "the most recent ubv ccd photometry published by @xcite has a limiting magnitude @xmath9 .",
    "several age estimates exist for the cluster members . from isochrone",
    "fitting , @xcite derived ages of 2 - 5 myr for the stars with @xmath10 ( spectral type b0 and earlier ) . from uvby photometry for stars with spectral type earlier than b5 ( @xmath11 ) , @xcite estimated an age of 10 - 20 myr .",
    "the difference between the two ages suggests either a large age spread among the cluster members , contamination from nearby stars in the local spiral arm @xcite , or large uncertainties in age estimates derived from optical photometry .",
    "the presence of o stars in the cluster sets an upper limit for ages of high mass stars . according to @xcite , the highest mass stars in the cluster have @xmath12 and main sequence lifetimes of 4 - 5 myr @xcite .",

    "only 58 of these stars are included in the photometric database of @xcite from which we selected our spectroscopic candidates .",
    "the discrepancy between the numbers of stars with spectral types in different catalogues can be explained by the incompletness of the webda and the uncertain spatial bounderies of the catalogue of @xcite . some stars with spectral type must lie outside the ccd field of @xcite .",

    "this large sample also provides a good measurement of the frequency of @xmath3 and other emission lines as a function of spectral types .",

    "our technique yields accurate spectral types for stars without emission lines .",

    "thus , hi emission fills in the h@xmath14 absorption line before affecting higher members of the balmer series .",
    "we use weak h@xmath14 absorption relative to h@xmath39 and h@xmath15 absorption to identify emission line stars with no obvious @xmath3 emission feature ( see also @xcite ) .",

    "2 shows the reddening histogram of emission line stars in the cluster field .",
    "the distribution is similar to the histogram for normal stars .",
    "however there is an excess of emission line stars with virtually no reddening",
    ". these stars may be single young stars in the vicinity of the sun or part of a nearby young association .",
    "including these zero reddening stars , @xmath49 of the emission line stars seem to belong to the foreground population .",
    "the stars with @xmath45 between 0.3 and 0.5 are probably members of the cluster .",

    "stars with @xmath51 could be background objects .",
    "roughly @xmath52 of the emission line stars has larger reddening than the cluster members . according to the @xmath53-distance relation of @xcite , these stars have distances larger than 1.9 kpc .",
    "the distance can be as large as 6.6 kpc for the highly reddened o star id2905 ( hd226868 ) .",
    "such large distances seem improbable , because they imply unreasonably large absolute magnitudes .",
    "the calculated @xmath54 value above the galactic plane ( @xmath55 pc ) for id2905 also contrasts with the accepted @xmath54 values for o - b stars ( @xmath56 pc ) , which suggests that this star has extra circumstellar reddening compared to cluster stars .",
    "the distances of the other background stars seem reasonable for the position of ngc  6871 but some of these stars might be cluster members with extra reddening due to circumstellar material .",
    "we examine this possibility further in the next subsection .      having derived the b - v color excess for the emission line stars , we calculate the @xmath53 and the bolometric correction for each star in our sample and construct the hrd for each subsample specified in the previous section ( foreground , cluster , background ) .",

    "the solid curves show the zams of @xcite shifted with the distance modulus @xmath57 which corresponds to a distance of 1649 pc @xcite .",
    "although the majority of emission line stars in the cluster follow the zams , four emission line stars lie above the main sequence",
    ". these objects may be pms stars ( see section 4 . ) .",
    "several other non - emission line objects lie close to these stars in the hrd",
    ". the relatively large scatter of these apparent pms stars in the hrd suggest a large age - spread in the cluster @xcite .",
    "the hrd of background objects ( fig 3c ) is very similar to the hrd for cluster members .",
    "roughly half of the emission line stars lie on or above the zams , which suggests that they are cluster members with extra reddening due to circumstellar material .",
    "radial velocity measurements would test this possibility .",
    "the stars with lower reddening occupy an area above the main sequence .",
    "most of these stars are foreground objects with different distance moduli .",
    "three of the four zero reddening stars may lie at the same distance : they are on a line nearly parallel to the zams and may be a small group of young stars .",
    "the fourth of the unreddened stars may lie within 100 pc but its spectral type is uncertain .",
    "further observations would place better limits on its distance .",
    "the other foreground stars lie just above the main sequence .",
    "their position is consistent with the distance calculated from their reddening using the calibration of @xcite ( 1.2 kpc )",
    ". they may be part of another young open cluster along the line of sight to ngc  6871 or a lower density concentration of stars in the local spiral arm .",
    "in this section we give a short description of emission line stars in our sample .",
    "we follow the previous section and divide the sample into foreground , background , and cluster stars . in each section",
    ", we classify the stars as main sequence or pre - main sequence based on their positions in the hrd , the presence of [ nii ] , [ sii ] emission lines , and the detection of the li i @xmath256708 absorption line .",
    "although li  i  @xmath256708 absorption provides the best age measure for a young star , we detect li i @xmath256708 only in a few cases due to the low resolution of our spectra . even where we detect the li i @xmath256708 line , the detection is very uncertain .",
    "higher resolution spectra would provide a better test for the presence of li i @xmath256708 in these stars .",
    "with several o - type stars in the cluster , [ nii ] and [ sii ] emission lines could result from poor sky / nebula subtraction . to test this possibility",
    ", we measure an [ sii ] index for the complete spectroscopic sample .",
    "if fluctuations in nebular emission across the cluster field produce [ nii ] and [ sii ] emission , we expect roughly equal numbers of sources with apparent [ nii ] and [ sii ] absorption .",

    "we identify a slight trend of increasing [ sii ] index towards later spectral types .",
    "the only exceptions to this trend are [ sii ] emission line stars .",
    "there are no stars with apparent [ sii ] absorption .",
    "thus , we conclude that nebular contamination is not responsible for the [ sii ] or [ nii ] emission line stars .",
    "there are 9 stars in our sample with low reddening . because all are fainter than the hipparcos limit , we can not use accurate distances or proper motions to test the evolutionary status of these stars .",

    "these stars have roughly the same distance according to their position on the hrd and the @xmath53-distance relation of @xcite .",
    "this distance coincides with the distance of the majority of the normal foreground stars , suggesting that they may be part of a cluster between the sun and ngc  6871 .",
    "radial velocity measurements would test this idea .",

    "near infrared data would allow a test of the evolutionary status of these stars .",
    "@xcite found that pms be stars and classical be stars occupy well - defined , different regions of the j - h , h - k color - color diagram .",
    "a few f - type emission line stars may belong to this group .",
    "several stars with spectral types a - g lie above the cluster main sequence and may be pms stars .",
    "the distribution of @xmath3 indices for these stars coincides with the peak observed for wtts in the taurus - auriga molecular cloud . if these are pms stars , they are wtts not ctts .",
    "some of these stars show [ nii ] , [ sii ] emission and may have lii absorption , which provides some evidence for their pms status .",
    "the discovery of [ sii ] and [ nii ] in apparent wtts in ngc  6871 is a new and unexpected result of our survey .",
    "previous observations of wtts in other regions rarely detect [ nii ] or [ sii ] emission @xcite .",
    "we detect [ nii ] emission in @xmath6 and [ sii ] emission in @xmath5 of our candidate wtts ; none of these show [ oi ] emission features in their spectra . in many pms stars , [ oi ] ,",
    "[ nii ] , and [ sii ] emission lines are associated with disk accretion phenomena ( e.g. jets and disk - wind interactions ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as a class , wtts show very little evidence for a wind ; the lack of an infrared excess indicates that they have already lost their disk .",
    "thus the origin of [ nii ] and [ sii ] emission in our candidate wtts is uncertain : if this emission is associated with these stars , the emission must be excited by some mechanism other than accretion .",
    "if the emission is not associated with these stars , a faint hii region in ngc 6871 is a plausible alternative source of forbidden line emission .",
    "our test for nebular background emission in section 4 appears to rule out this source of emission , but high resolution spectra would provide a better test .",
    "we thank the fred lawrence whipple observatory staff and a. mahdavi , k , rines , e. falco , w. brown for helping with the observations and susan tokarz and the sao telescope data center for assistance in the data reduction .",
