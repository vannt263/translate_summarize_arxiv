    "according to heisenberg and dirac , quantum mechanics is obtained from classical mechanics by replacing classical poisson brackets , multiplied by the planck constant , by commutators .",
    "two circles of problems arise from such an ansatz : one concerning the precise content of that prescription , which is not so well defined as it may appear , if it is to be interpreted as general and unique , and therefore independent from choices of coordinates , hamiltonian , etc . ;",
    "the second asking whether such a substitution  has to be interpreted as a mere prescription or rather follows from more fundamental principles .",
    "concerning the first kind of problems , it is well known that the substitution procedure is completely well defined for a particle in euclidean space : when applied to cartesian coordinates and their conjugated momenta , it defines the heisenberg algebra , which , assuming exponentiability of the generators , gives rise to a unique @xmath8 algebra @xcite , the weyl algebra , with a unique hilbert space representation continuous in the group parameters ( von neumann theorem @xcite ) .",
    "the situation changes completely if one considers classical mechanics on a manifold @xmath1 and asks whether a similar , coordinate independent , construction provides a unique algebra , with a similar classification of representations . in this case ,",
    "geometrical structures play an essential rle and different strategies and constructions have been proposed .",
    "phase space  quantization methods start from the classical phase space @xmath9 and try to associate an element @xmath10 of an operator algebra to any classical variable , i.e. any ( regular ) function @xmath11 on @xmath9 .",

    "possible solutions are given either by restricting the correspondence @xmath16 to suitable subsets of the classical variables ( geometric quantization ) , or by relaxing the relation between commutators and classical poisson brackets , which is assumed to hold to order @xmath17 ( deformation quantization ) .",
    "in both cases , the construction depends on the introduction of additional structures , respectively geometrical and algebraic , and the result is not unique .    on the other side , canonical quantization  developed into an analysis based only on the geometry of @xmath1 and of its diffeomorphism group , and therefore into the study of the representations of the crossed product algebras @xmath18 , @xmath19 a subgroup of diff @xmath20 , defined by the action of @xmath19 on @xmath21 .    in the segal approach @xcite ,",

    "segal s diffeomorphism invariant approach has been developed by doebner @xcite , who dropped segal s maximality condition by assuming a local hilbert space structure of any dimension , with a connection form which relates spaces at different points .",
    "the representations of the diffeomorphism group , associated in general to diffeomorphism invariance , have been studied by goldin .",
    "the corresponding lie algebra of functions and vector fields does not contain enough information for the identification of mechanics on @xmath1 ; in fact , it has the interpretation of the ( classical ) current algebra and its representations appear therefore in many situations , in particular for all @xmath26 particle quantum ( schroedinger ) systems on @xmath1 @xcite . the same considerations apply to the representations of the crossed product @xmath8 algebra @xmath27 diff @xmath20 .    clearly , the basic problem of the diffeomorphism invariant canonical approaches is the identification of degrees of freedom for the generalized momenta , which is not correctly given by the lie structure of vector fields , since linearly independent vector fields define independent variables .",
    "the solution proposed in @xcite is to consider as fundamental the module structure of the lie algebra of vector fields of compact support , denoted by vect @xmath20 , on the algebra of @xmath0 functions , i.e. the _ lie rinehart _ ( lr ) structure of ( @xmath28 vect @xmath20 ) and to assume that the lie - rinehart product f v : ( c^ ( ) , vect ( ) ) ( ) is realized , in the algebra defining quantum mechanics ( qm ) on @xmath1 , by the _ symmetric ( jordan ) product _ : f v = 1/2 ( f v + v f ) [ lr ]    it turns out that the lr relations ( [ lr ] ) can also be written in terms of the resolvents of the unbounded operators representing vector fields ( of compact support ) and define therefore , together with the crossed product relations between @xmath29 and diff @xmath20 , a unique @xmath8 algebra .",
    "its hilbert space representations have been classified , assuming regularity , i.e strong continuity of one dimensional subgroup of diff @xmath20 as for the weyl algebra , and shown to be in one to one correspondence with the unitary representation of the fundamental group of @xmath1 , describing the displacement of a particle along non - contractible closed paths @xcite .",
    "such a classification of states reproduces , only assuming basic geometrical and algebraic structures , that obtained by doebner @xcite and by @xcite , the latter within an approach _ a priori _ based on trajectories .    for the basic questions about the nature of quantization ,",
    "clearly one has to identify general principles and ask to which extent they constrain both classical and quantum mechanics and which alternatives they leave open .",
    "the strategy proposed by dirac @xcite , with his analysis of proportionality between commutators and poisson brackets , ends with the difficulties of phase space quantization .",
    "as we shall see , dirac s equations can not be interpreted as directly relating classical and quantum algebras and the basic missing point is the very identification of the algebraic structures to which they apply .",
    "we start therefore from fundamental principles , given by the geometry of @xmath1 and vect @xmath20 .",
    "they are embodied in the commutative algebraic structure of @xmath29 , describing the manifold , and in the lie structure of @xmath30 vect @xmath20 defined by the lie relation between vector fields and their action on @xmath29 . from the above discussion",
    "it is clear that also the module structure of vect @xmath20 over @xmath29 plays an essential rle , redefining linear dependence of vector fields according to multiplication by @xmath0 functions .",
    "actually , the lie - rinehart algebra ( @xmath28 vect @xmath20 ) is represented _ faithfully _ both in classical and in quantum mechanics , with the lie product realized respectively as the poisson and commutator brackets and the lr product realized as the symmetric product , eq.([lr ] ) .",
    "we then propose to base the most general notion of mechanics on a set of variables indexed by @xmath29 and vect @xmath20 ) with their lie - rinehart relations , @xmath0 functions being interpreted as position variables and vect @xmath31 , describing small displacements , as generalized momenta .    in order to obtain variables to which well defined values may be assigned in terms of a notion of spectrum , we consider ( associative ) algebras generated by them .",
    "the associative product is assumed 1 ) to extend the commutative product of @xmath32 and 2 ) to reproduce , with its _ symmetric ( jordan ) part _ , the lie - rinehart product between @xmath29 and vect @xmath20 , i.e. to satisfy eq.([lr ] ) ; as discussed above in the case of qm , condition 2 ) has a basic rle for the identification of degrees of freedom and therefore for the characterization of mechanics on @xmath1 , with respect to the most general diffeomorphism invariant system .",
    "the use of _ the symmetric part _ of the associative product is essential in the non - commutative case .",
    "we also assume 3 ) that the lie product on @xmath30 vect @xmath20 can be extended to a lie product on such algebras , defining on them derivations , i.e. , satisfying the leibniz rule with respect to the associative product .",
    "this may be interpreted as the association of some ( infinitesimal ) operation to each variable , generalizing the action of vector fields and allowing for a general notion of symmetry transformation ( which is essential , e.g. , for the introduction of a time evolution ) .",
    "we extend therefore the lie - rinehart algebra of @xmath1 to a _ non - commutative ( real ) poisson algebra_. in general , one obtains an enveloping non commutative poisson algebra of a lie - rinehart algebra @xcite , a notion which extends that of poisson enveloping algebra of a lie algebra @xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized that no relation is assumed between lie products and commutators , only the leibniz rule constraining the associative and lie products .",
    "if no other restriction is assumed , the result is the _",
    "universal _ enveloping ( non - commutative ) poisson algebra of the lr algebra @xmath33 , vect @xmath34 .",
    "its uniqueness follows from the definition of universality ( see below ) and its construction has been given in @xcite .",
    "such a non - commutative poisson algebra will be called the lie - rinehart universal poisson algebra of @xmath1 , or briefly the _ poisson - rinehart _ algebra of @xmath1 and denoted by @xmath3 .",
    "a unique linear involution is also defined ( see section 2 ) on @xmath35 , treating functions and vector fields as real variables , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and satisfying @xmath38 , which then implies @xmath39 .    _ a priori _ , @xmath35 is a very general algebraic structure , in fact the most general associative algebra , with a lie bracket satisfying the leibniz rule , generated by the lr algebra associated to @xmath1 and vect @xmath20 .",
    "the main result is that it describes _ nothing else than classical and quantum mechanics_.    this is obtained as follows : first , we recall that in general , in a poisson algebra @xmath40 , commutators and lie products satisfy the following relation , already pointed out by dirac @xcite and rederived in refs .",
    "@xcite  @xcite : [ farkas ] clearly , if for some @xmath41 , @xmath42 has an inverse , eq .",
    "( [ farkas ] ) allows to express commutators in terms of poisson brackets .",
    "more generally , the same holds for prime poisson algebras , i.e. algebras without ideals which are divisors of zero  @xcite ; such conditions are not satisfied by @xmath35 , since ( see below ) any pair of functions with disjoint supports generate ( bilateral ) ideals @xmath43 with @xmath44 .",
    "however , in the case of compact @xmath1 , by summing commutators of locally conjugated variables in @xmath35 , we construct a unique variable @xmath45 satisfying [ a , b ] = z \\{a , b }   a , b . [ z ]",
    "@xmath46 turns out to be central with respect to both the associative and to lie product ; in the non compact case , we construct a sequence @xmath47 satisfying eq.([z ] ) for @xmath48 , allowing for an extension of @xmath35 by an element satisfying eq.([z ] ) and central in the same sense . in both cases , @xmath46 is antihermitian : @xmath49 .",
    "if the variable @xmath46 is substituted by an ( imaginary ) number , the result may be seen as a precise version of an argument by dirac , based on eq.([farkas ] ) , on the commutator prescription for qm ; more properly , it shows that the general approach to mechanics on a manifold provided by the basic geometrical ( lr ) structure automatically yields a variable invariant under diffeomorphisms and under all the physical operations , expressed by the lie brackets in @xmath35 , i.e. a universal constant , with the same rle and interpretation as the planck constant .    to proceed with the analysis of @xmath35 , one considers the ideals generated by @xmath50 , @xmath6 , @xmath51 the identity of @xmath35 , given by @xmath52 ; they are stable with respect to the poisson brackets with @xmath35 and define therefore homomorphisms @xmath53 and quotient poisson algebras @xmath54 .    for @xmath55 ,",
    "one obtains the commutative poisson algebra generated by @xmath56 and by the @xmath0 vector fields , with the natural module structure of vect @xmath20 on @xmath56 , which is isomorphic to the commutative poisson algebra of polynomials in the cotangent vectors on @xmath1 with @xmath0 coefficients ; under standard regularity conditions ( section 2 ) , it has a unique hilbert space representation , by multiplication operators in @xmath57 , with lie brackets represented by the classical poisson brackets .",

    "the analysis of hilbert space representations of @xmath35 shows that the above classification is complete , i.e. classical and quantum mechanics on @xmath1 are the only _ regular _ and _ factorial _ representations of @xmath35 ( section 2 ) .",
    "the isomorphism between the real algebra @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and the above complex algebra also explains the origin of a complex structure in the standard formulation of quantum mechanics , through a non - zero complex number representation of the antihermitian variable @xmath46 ; no complex structure arises in classical mechanics , which originates from the zero representation of @xmath46 .    for @xmath71 ,",
    "if only cartesian vector fields are considered , a similar simplified construction applies , still providing a @xmath46 variable and the above classification .",
    "the relevance of the full rinehart structure is in fact only related to the geometrical identification of observables in a diffeomorphism invariant formulation ( a question in fact at the origin the above mentioned difficulties and alternatives for the formulation of qm an manifolds ) .    in all cases ,",
    "the lie , or lie - rinehart , algebra of momenta and ( functions of ) positions is _ the same _ in classical and in quantum mechanics .",
    "the classical - quantum alternative only arises when _ polynomials in the momenta _ are introduced and is uniquely given by the values of @xmath46 in the universal enveloping algebra , with the lr constraint on the symmetric product .",
    "the above analysis unravels the basic rle of the lr geometry of the configuration manifold , which in the quantum case is somewhat hidden in the observable @xmath8-algebra ( lie products being identified with commutators ) and in the classical case goes beyond the abelian algebraic relations .",
    "the lr algebraic structure provides , through the poisson - rinehart algebra @xmath35 , a notion of _ non commutative phase space _ which coincides with that of a _ general mechanical system _ , exactly covering classical and quantum mechanics .",
    "in particular , the above construction shows that the dirac ansatz of canonical quantization , in the form of the proportionality of the commutators _ of variables in _ @xmath72 vect @xmath20 to their classical poisson brackets , has no alternative , within the above rather general notion of mechanical system .",
    "the uniqueness of the commutators for @xmath0 functions and vector fields on the configuration manifold also explains the obstructions which arise by requiring proportionality of commutators to poisson brackets _ for all functions _ on the classical phase space . in our approach ,",
    "the extension of the commutation relations starting from @xmath32 and vect(@xmath1 ) and the construction of quantum algebras does not in fact use the classical poisson algebra ; it is given by the leibniz rule and by the identification of the lr product with the symmetric product and therefore , in a sense , it _ automatically depends _ on @xmath46 .",
    "our results suggest a quite different approach to the relation between classical and quantum mechanics with respect to phase space quantization : the classical phase space is _ not _ assumed as a starting point and rather arises from the same ( non - commutative ) poisson algebra in correspondence with one of the values taken by the central variable @xmath46 , on the same footing as the quantum mechanical state space .",
    "we also emphasize that in the above approach the planck constant _ needs not to be introduced_. it automatically appears as a variable invariant under all physical transformations , i.e. a _ universal constant _ , in the poisson - rinehart algebra of a manifold .    in the following section",
    "the above notions will be formalized , together with their implications on classical and quantum mechanics .",
    "_ the lie - rinehart algebra of @xmath1_.    a general notion of mechanical variables on @xmath1 , should include regular ( @xmath0 ) functions and vector fields , indexing generalized momenta ; as we shall see , local variables are enough for a general notion of mechanics on @xmath1 .",
    "we therefore consider the algebra generated by real functions of compact support in @xmath1 and the identity , @xmath32 , and the space vect ( @xmath1 ) of @xmath0 vector fields of compact support .",

    "the dirac ansatz for commutators between cartesian coordinates and momenta has therefore no alternative , precisely in the sense that the heisenberg algebra and the classical polynomial poisson algebra are the only poisson algebras which envelope @xmath143 or @xmath151 in the above sense ( and are therefore isomorphic to quotients in @xmath145 ) and represent @xmath155 by a nonnegative number .        definition a * representation * @xmath156 of a poisson * -algebra @xmath40 in a complex hilbert space @xmath157 is a homomorphism of @xmath40 into a poisson * -algebra of operators in @xmath157 , with both the operator product and a lie product @xmath158 satisfying the leibniz rule , having a common invariant dense domain @xmath159 on which @xmath160    a representation @xmath156 of @xmath35 is called * regular * if @xmath161 and i ) ( * exponentiability * ) @xmath159 is invariant under @xmath162 and the one parameter unitary groups @xmath163 , @xmath164 , @xmath90 , generated by @xmath165 and @xmath166 , respectively , ii ) ( * diffeomorphism invariance * ) the elements @xmath167 define strongly continuous automorphisms of the @xmath8 algebra @xmath168 generated by @xmath162 , @xmath163 , @xmath164 , : ( f ) ( f ) , u((v ) ) , .",
