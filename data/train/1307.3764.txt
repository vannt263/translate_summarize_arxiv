    "spontaneous breaking of the electroweak symmetry ( ewsb ) is one of the foundational concepts of contemporary particle physics . that it occurs due to an elementary scalar higgs field developing a non - vanishing vacuum expectation value , is a fundamental principle put forward in the beh mechanism  @xcite , which is implemented in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the discovery of a @xmath1 gev scalar particle  @xcite with properties of the higgs boson is the crowning achievement of the sm as an effective theory .    at the more fundamental level",
    ", the sm leaves a number of key questions unanswered .",
    "first on the list is the question of the origin of the electroweak scale and its naturalness .",
    "the sm accommodates the expectation value @xmath2 for the higgs field and the higgs mass @xmath3 essentially as input parameters , but it does not ( nor is it expected to ) explain the origin or the value of the electroweak scale , and in particular its smallness compared to the uv cutoff or the scale of new physics .",
    "the list of questions left unanswered by the sm continues and includes the generation of the baryon asymmetry of the universe , the nature of dark matter and the particle physics implementation of inflation . in this paper",
    "we will argue that a minimal extension of the sm can naturally provide an explanation for electroweak symmetry breaking and the baryon asymmetry .",
    "these two phenomena in fact will have the same origin in the classically scale invariant theory .    an elegant way to explain how the vev ( and the mass ) of the scalar field were generated and why their values are naturally suppressed by many orders of magnitude relative to the uv scale at @xmath4 , is to start from a purely massless theory , and to generate the mass gap radiatively . in a seminal paper",
    "@xcite coleman and e. weinberg showed that in gauge theory a classically massless @xmath5 scalar field @xmath6 does develop the vev via dimensional transmutation from the running couplings , leading to spontaneous breaking of gauge symmetry .",

    ", \\ll m_{uv}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the gauge coupling of @xmath6 , and for the vev we use , @xmath9 and @xmath10 . ]",
    "@xmath11 .",
    "the use of the coleman - weinberg ( cw ) mechanism is based on approximate scale invariance of the theory .",
    "the scale invariance of the sm can either be seen as softly broken @xcite , or it can be realised only as a classical symmetry .",
    "the concept of classical scale invariance , first discussed in  @xcite , asserts that no masses are allowed in the classical lagrangian of the effective theory under consideration ; all mass scales must be generated dynamically in the ir .",
    "even earlier , ref .",
    "@xcite considered the set - up where scale invariance is softly broken and discussed the appropriate choice of uv regularisation for such theories .",
    "the minimal model to realise classical scale invariance is the standard model with an additional cw  hidden sector \" and the higgs portal - type coupling to the sm  @xcite .",
    "the classical potential for scalar fields in this minimal scenario is , @xmath12 the first two terms are the ordinary self - couplings for the higgs field @xmath13 and the coleman - weinberg scalar @xmath6 .",
    "the last term is the higgs - portal  @xcite interaction between the sm higgs field and the hidden sector field @xmath6 .",
    "the portal coupling generates the negative higgs - mass - squared @xmath14 needed to trigger ewsb at the scale @xmath15 which is exponentially suppressed relative to the uv cutoff scale as a consequence of .    to preserve classical scale invariance as an approximate quantum symmetry in the uv , only the scale - preserving uv regularisation schemes can be used  @xcite . in dimensional regularisation , which does not introduce any explicit scale aside from the rg scale , entering the logarithmically running couplings , the masslessness equation is satisfied automatically for all values of the rg scale in theories which contain no explicit mass scales at the outset , and no _ finite _ corrections to dimensionful quantities can appear either .",
    "the coleman - weinberg field @xmath6 can be viewed as the pseudo - dilaton arising from the approximate scale invariance broken by the running of dimensionless couplings . in the classically scale - invariant bsm theory",
    "all mass scales should be linked to and originate from @xmath16 .",
    "it is thus unlikely that a compelling explanation could be found for generation of vastly different scales in the theory .",
    "thus it is a prediction of this general formalism for bsm model building with classical scale invariance and at weak coupling that no vastly different scales can exist in the theory .",
    "the planck scale can be taken separately in this case , as gravity is viewed as a background to the effective classically scale - invariant theory .",
    "but all other particle - physics scales , as soon as they are generated by dimensional transmutation through the vev of the coleman - weinberg pseudo - dilaton , should not be separated from one another by many orders of magnitude .    to give an example",
    ", this model - building principle severely disfavours grand unification , since the gut scale and the electroweak scale would have to have the same origin in @xmath16 and this would be quite difficult to implement given 14 orders of magnitude between them .    what about the baryon asymmetry ? with no signs of supersymmetry and no anomalies in the quark flavour sector ,",
    "the most attractive ( and arguably least unlikely ) scenario for generating the baryon asymmetry of the universe is leptogenesis . in the standard scenario of thermal leptogenesis @xcite ,",
    "a lepton asymmetry is generated by decays of heavy right - handed majorana neutrinos into standard model leptons at temperatures much above the electroweak scale .",
    "the lepton asymmetry is then reprocessed into the baryon asymmetry by electroweak sphalerons @xcite above the electroweak scale .",
    "however , to generate the observed value of matter - anti - matter asymmetry in the vanilla version of leptogenesis requires extremely heavy masses for sterile neutrinos , @xmath17 gev @xcite . if this was the full story , the classical scale - invariance would be ruled out by @xmath18 .",
    "instead we will adopt an alternative approach to leptogenesis pioneered in ref .",
    "@xcite and further developed in @xcite . in this approach , the lepton flavour asymmetry is being produced during oscillations of the right - handed majorana neutrinos with masses of the order of the electroweak scale or below , which is perfectly suited for our classically scale - invariant setup .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section  * [ sec:2.1 ] * we recall how the generation of the electroweak scale occurs in a minimal classically scale - invariant theory based on the @xmath19 extension of the standard model .",
    "the @xmath20 realisation of this model which automatically includes sterile right - handed majorana neutrinos is outlined in  * [ sec:2.2]*. the formalism of leptogenesis via majorana neutrino oscillations is presented in  * [ sec:3.1]*. section  * [ sec:3.2 ] * adapts and applies theses ideas to our classically scale - invariant models . the matter - anti - matter asymmetry is calculated and analysed in section  * [ sec:4 ] * which also contains our benchmark points .",
    "conclusions are outlined in section  * [ sec : five]*.",
    "as we already noted , the classically scale - invariant extension of the standard model does not allow for tree - level mass terms .",
    "we now recall how the coleman - weinberg mechanism leads to ewsb in the higgs - portal theory .",
    "below we will summarise the relevant for us formulae following @xcite .",
    "the coleman - weinberg complex scalar @xmath6 is coupled to a u(1)@xmath22 gauge theory ( this forms the hidden sector ) , while the higgs doublet @xmath13 has standard interactions with the su(2)@xmath23u(1 ) gauge fields ( as well as the matter fields ) of the standard model .",
    "the classical scalar potential is given by in terms of two real scalar fields with canonical kinetic terms @xmath24 .",
    "this is related to the canonically normalised complex scalar @xmath25 via a simple rescaling , @xmath26 . ]",
    "@xmath27 where the higgs doublet @xmath13 in the unitary gauge takes the form @xmath28 .    at the origin in field space where all field vevs are zero , there are no scales present in the theory .",
    "this feature is maintained in the full effective potential due to the renormalisation subtraction conditions , @xmath29 these conditions are automatic in dimensional regularisation of any theory with classical scale invariance and hold for any value of the rg scale @xmath30 in dimensional regularisation which does not break scale invariance .    in the phenomenologically relevant near - decoupling limit between the",
    "hidden and the sm sectors , @xmath31 , we can view electroweak symmetry breaking effectively as a two - step process @xcite .",
    "first , the cw mechanism generates @xmath32 in the cw sector as dictated by through running of the gauge cw coupling . at the scale @xmath33 the scalar coupling @xmath34 is of the order of @xmath35 rather than @xmath36 .    to see this ,",
    "consider the 1-loop effective potential evaluated at the scale @xmath33 , @xmath37    \\,-\\ , \\lambda_{\\rm p}(h^{\\dagger}h)|\\phi|^{2}\\,+\\ ,    \\frac{\\lambda_{\\rm h}}{2}(h^{\\dagger } h)^{2}\\,.\\ ] ] here following @xcite we are keeping 1-loop corrections arising from interactions of @xmath6 with the u(1 ) gauge bosons in the hidden sector , but neglecting radiative corrections from the standard model sector .",
    "the latter would produce only subleading corrections to the vevs .",
    "the @xmath6-minimisation condition gives @xmath38 this equation implies that the vev @xmath32 is determined by the condition on the four couplings renormalised at the scale of the vev @xmath39 for small @xmath40 , this is a small deformation of the original cw condition , @xmath41 .",
    "the second step of the process is the transmission of the vev @xmath42 to the standard model via the higgs portal , generating a negative mass squared parameter for the higgs @xmath43 which fixes the electroweak scale : @xmath44 where we used @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the fact that for @xmath31 the generated electroweak scale is much smaller than @xmath47 , guarantees that any back reaction on the hidden sector vev @xmath42 is negligible .",
    "the two vevs , @xmath32 and @xmath15 are generated _ naturally _ through dimensional transmutation in our framework similarly to , @xmath48 \\",
    ", \\ll \\lambda_{uv}\\,.\\ ] ]    in the hidden sector we have two additional fields : @xmath6 and the extra u(1)@xmath49 gauge field @xmath50 .",
    "after @xmath6 acquires a non - vanishing vev , the @xmath50 becomes massive charge @xmath51 of the cw scalar field is different from unity , as will be the case for the @xmath20 model discussed in the following section , the gauge coupling in the expressions on the right hand side of eq .   and in the second equation in",
    "should be rescaled as @xmath52 . ] @xmath53 the @xmath50 boson is much heavier than the cw scalar , since from we have @xmath54 , thus @xmath55 would have to be in the few tev range in order to be not yet seen at the lhc .",
    "let us count the parameters of the model : the sm higgs self - coupling is fixed by the ratio of known electroweak scales , while the other self - coupling , @xmath56 , is determined from the cw dimensional transmutation condition .",
    "there are two undetermined parameters in our model which one can take to be the hidden sector gauge coupling , @xmath57 , and the ( small ) portal coupling @xmath40 . in this case , the two mass scales associated with the hidden scalar are fixed , @xmath58 alternatively , the two free parameters can be chosen to be the mass of the hidden higgs , @xmath59 , and the higgs portal coupling @xmath40 .",
    "the phenomenology of this model in the context of lhc , future colliders and low energy measurements was analysed in @xcite .",
    "the minimal model has only two remaining free parameters , the mass of the cw scalar gev higgs .",
    "this parameter can also be traded for the mass of the cw gauge field @xmath50 . ] , and the portal coupling @xmath40 , and it was shown that the model is perfectly viable .",
    "in particular , the presently available higgs data constrains the portal coupling to be @xmath60 on the ` half ' of the parameter space where the second scalar is in the region between @xmath61 gev and @xmath62 .    at the same time , inside a much more restricted window in the parameter space , where the second scalar is heavier than @xmath62 , but less than 100 gev , the portal coupling can be pushed up to the @xmath63 regime . in this narrow window ,",
    "the higgs potential is automatically stabilised at high scales by the positive contribution @xmath64 to the higgs self - coupling @xmath65 beta function , a recent discussion of this effect can be found in @xcite , see also @xcite . as the result , here the ewsb vacuum at @xmath66 gev is stable at all energy scales .",
    "when the second scalar is heavier than 100 gev , the model is largely unconstrained by current experimental data , see ref .",
    "@xcite for more detail .",
    "future experimental data on higgs decays will further constrain model parameters , and will ultimately provide discovery potential for this model .      the coleman - weinberg mechanism",
    "must occur in the sector separate from the standard model .",
    "this is because the cw scalar must be parametrically lighter than the vector boson of the gauge group under which the cw scalar is charged , _ cf . _",
    "the second equation in , @xmath68 hence the cw gauge boson is identified with @xmath50 rather than with the @xmath69 boson of the sm @xmath70 which is of course lighter than its scalar ( i.e. the higgs ) .",
    "the minimal cw gauge group is @xmath71 ( though nothing prevents the cw mechanism to work well in the non - abelian settings @xcite ; for a recent @xmath72 cw application see @xcite ) .    in eq .",
    "we have allowed for a general @xmath73 , which denotes the charge of the cw scalar under the u(1 ) gauge group ; it will be set to @xmath74 in the @xmath20 model we are going to consider .    an interesting idea  @xcite is to identify the cw @xmath71 factor with the gauged @xmath20 @xmath71 flavour subgroup of the standard model .",
    "this gives the classically conformal realisation of what is known as the @xmath20 model  @xcite .",
    "we thus have @xmath75 , and the @xmath50 massive ( @xmath76 few tev ) vector boson now couples to quarks and leptons of the standard model proportionally to their @xmath77 charge .",
    "the sm higgs carries no baryon or lepton number and therefore does not couple to the @xmath0 sector .",
    "the appeal of this model with local @xmath0 group is that the cancellation of gauge anomalies requires an automatic inclusion of three generations of the right - handed neutrinos , @xmath78 .",
    "these neutrinos carry lepton number = 1 and transform under @xmath0 , but are sterile under the sm gauge groups .",
    "finally , the coleman - weinberg scalar field @xmath6 is assigned the @xmath20 charge @xmath79 .",
    "interactions of right - handed neutrinos @xmath78 are given by @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are @xmath83 complex matrices of the majorana and dirac yukawa couplings respectively .",
    "the right - handed neutrinos @xmath78 are sm singlets ( often referred to as the sterile neutrinos ) , they carry lepton number @xmath84 and their antiparticles , @xmath85 , have @xmath86 .",
    "the charge - conjugate anti - particle , @xmath87 has the same lepton number + 1 as the state @xmath78 . in the unbroken phase ,",
    "the lepton number is conserved by all interactions in when @xmath6 is assigned lepton number @xmath88 .",
    "the first two terms on the right hand side of give the only interactions of the cw scalar @xmath6 with matter fields ( apart from its small mixing with the higgs ) .",
    "this is a consequence of its @xmath89 charge assignment .",
    "spontaneous breaking of the @xmath20 symmetry by the vev @xmath90 generates majorana masses @xmath91 which lead to lepton number non - conserving interactions .",
    "importantly , individual lepton flavour is also not conserved : @xmath92 are complex matrices which induce cp - violating transitions between lepton flavours @xmath93 and @xmath94 of the right - handed neutrinos .",
    "are diagonalised and real , but not the majorana ones @xmath81 . ]    in summary , the single @xmath0 hidden sector simultaneously incorporates the coleman - weinberg scalar which triggers the ewsb , and also gives rise to the majorana sterile neutrinos which through the see - saw mechanism give rise to masses of active neutrinos and neutrino oscillations@xcite .",
    "furthermore , as will be shown below , the generation of matter - antimatter asymmetry through leptogenesis now becomes possible and without fine - tuning .",
    "leptogenesis is the idea that the baryon asymmetry of the universe has originated in the lepton rather than quark sector of the theory . in the standard scenario of thermal leptogenesis @xcite",
    "one starts with the see - saw lagrangian involving right - handed neutrinos with majorana mass terms coupled to the standard model left - handed lepton doublets ( _ cf . _ eq .  ) , @xmath95 it is usually assumed that a lepton asymmetry was generated by decays of heavy right - handed majorana neutrinos at temperatures much above the electroweak scale .",
    "these heavy sterile neutrinos were thermally produced during reheating in the early universe and then fell out of thermal equilibrium due to the universe expansion .",
    "their out - of - equilibrium decays into standard model leptons and higgs bosons violate lepton number and cp , thus producing lepton asymmetry , which is then reprocessed into the baryon asymmetry by electroweak sphalerons above the electroweak scale .",
    "the defining phenomenological signature of these models is that the masses of the sterile majorana neutrinos should be @xmath17 gev @xcite .",

    "@xcite proposed an alternative physical realisation of the leptogenesis mechanism which allows one to circumvent the @xmath96 gev lower bound .",
    "in fact , the ars leptogenesis is intended to work with sterile neutrinos of sub - electroweak majorana mass - scale .",
    "the generation of matter - anti - matter asymmetry proceeds as follows . as in the original mechanism ,",
    "the right - handed neutrinos are produced thermally in the early universe through their yukawa interactions with lepton and higgs doublets . after being produced , they begin to oscillate , @xmath97 , between the three different flavour states @xmath98 in the expanding universe , and also interact with the left - handed leptons and higgs bosons via their yukawa interactions .    since the majorana masses in the ars scenario are roughly of the electroweak scale , or below , they are much smaller than the relevant temperature , @xmath99 , in the early universe . for this reason ,",
    "the rate of the total lepton - number violation ( i.e. singlet fermions to singlet anti - fermions , @xmath100 , induced by their majorana masses ) is negligible at @xmath101 .",
    "however , the lepton number of individual flavours is not conserved : complex non - diagonal majorana matrices induce cp - violating flavour oscillations followed by out - of - equilibrium  due to smallness of the yukawa matrices at @xmath99  decays , @xmath102 following @xcite we now require that by the time the temperature cools down to @xmath103 , where electroweak sphaleron processes freeze out , two of the neutrino flavours i.e. @xmath104 and @xmath105 equilibrate with their standard model counterparts , @xmath106 , while the remaining flavour ( call it the 1@xmath107 or @xmath108-flavour ) does not . ,",

    "as the result of this washout of the second and the third lepton flavours , the corresponding lepton doublets are processed by electroweak sphalerons into baryons , while the first flavour of right - handed neutrinos is not transferred to the active leptons fast enough before the electroweak sphaleron shuts down .",

    "the third column ( scenario 7 ) in the tables  [ tab:2 ] and [ tab:3 ] enters the regime where @xmath40 approaches @xmath191 .",
    "( to achieve this we brought the three majorana masses closer together relative to scenarios 5 and 6 . ) in this case , the higgs potential is automatically stabilised by the positive contribution @xmath64 to the higgs self - coupling @xmath65 beta function   @xcite .",
    "we also show the values of the majorana @xmath192 and the average value of the dirac yukawa @xmath193 couplings . ] along with the ranges for @xmath194 , or equivalently , the @xmath50 vector boson mass , and the self - coupling of the cw scalar .",
    "the lower bound on the @xmath50 mass in the table is the experimental bound @xmath195 tev which is then translated into the lower bounds on @xmath194 via @xmath196 the upper bounds on @xmath197 in the table follow from the requirement of perturbativity in the coupling @xmath198 , which gives @xmath199 . for the cw self - coupling @xmath200 the lower bounds",
    "are determined via ( _ c.f . _ eq .  ) , @xmath201",
    "in a theory with no input mass scales , the coleman - weinberg mechanism generates a symmetry - breaking vev and the mass for the associated scalar from radiative corrections .",
    "these scales are natural in the sense that they are automatically exponentially suppressed compared to the uv scale at which we initialise the theory .",
    "the portal interaction between the coleman - weinberg scalar and the higgs then generates the electroweak symmetry breaking scale .    we have shown that this theory for a wide range of parameters can generate the observed value of matter - anti - matter asymmetry via the leptogenesis mechanism due to majorana neutrino oscillations .    as a bonus the @xmath20 theory considered in this paper automatically contains sterile majorana neutrinos with masses in the window roughly between 200 mev and 500 gev , and a heavier @xmath50 boson .",
    "the presently available higgs data provide valuable constraints on the parameter space of the model , and future experimental data on higgs decays will further constrain model parameters in the higgs sector  @xcite . additional experimental constraints",
    "will come from searches of the sub - tev - scale sterile neutrinos via a combination of the double beta decay , electroweak precision data , the lhc searches and the high intensity frontier , see e.g. @xcite for recent reviews .",
    "the third ingredient comes from the searches of @xmath50 vector bosons , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "all these should ultimately provide the discovery potential for this classically conformal theory .",
    "the follow - up paper  @xcite presents an implementation of the slow - roll inflation mechanism in a bsm theory with classical scale invariance .",
    "this is achieved by introducing an additional singlet scalar field to the portal interactions of the theory and requiring that this singlet is also non - minimally coupled to gravity . at the same time , the same singlet provides a viable dark matter candidate in this theory .",
    "furthermore , the sm higgs potential is stabilised by the higgs portal interactions with the coleman - weinberg scalar .",
    "these results support the bsm model - building strategy which is based on classically scale - invariant extensions of the sm with portal - type interactions involving the higgs field as well as other microscopic scalars .",
    "these theories appear to be capable of addressing all the shortcomings of the sm mentioned in the introduction .",
