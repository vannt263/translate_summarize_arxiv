    "<S> the non - linear conduction arises from the motion of the charge density waves condensate which carries a net electrical current .    </S>",
    "<S> charge ordering ( co ) is a common characteristic of transition metal oxides with perovskite structure.@xcite in colossal magnetoresistive ( cmr ) manganites , the formation of an @xmath4 ordered phase is the most obvious manifestation of the @xmath5 electrons localization.@xcite the physics of the phase transition from a co - antiferromagnet to charge - delocalized ferromagnet have been extensively studied in recent years . </S>",
    "<S> this co destabilization is of great interest because this feature can be achieved under a wide variety of external perturbations.@xcite for instance , numerous experimental results have shown that the application of a moderate electric field leads to an insulator - metal ( i - m ) transition associated with a strong non - linearity of the voltage - current ( v - i ) characteristics.@xcite to interpret such a phenomenon it is proposed that a breakdown of the co state is induced by the current and that metallic filaments are created .  </S>",
    "<S> however , when considering the properties of manganites with colossal magnetoresistance , one have also to take into account , besides the charge and spin degrees of freedom , the orbital structure of the transition metal ions . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the description of the collective behavior of @xmath5 carriers in connection with the specific kind of charge @xmath6 orbital ordering ( oo ) ( which depend on the doping state ) might be of fundamental interest for the understanding of the non - linear electrical response of the co / oo manganites.@xcite    compounds of the system </S>",

    "<S> might lead to the development of a charge density wave ( cdw ) condensate .  </S>",
    "<S> such a cdw formation has also been deduced recently in manganese oxides of this composition by means of angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite by means of thz time - domain spectroscopy,@xcite evidence for a charge density wave condensate in the co / oo manganite pr@xmath24ca@xmath25mno@xmath2 has been reported . for this composition </S>",

    "<S> they attributed this observed structure to the collective excitation mode arising from a charge density wave condensate .    </S>",
    "<S> the more fascinating properties of cdw systems are related to nonlinear conduction induced by an electric field.@xcite this feature was interpreted as the conductivity associated with the motion of cdw . as proposed in@xcite , the phase of the cdw could be pinned by several mechanisms ; if an electric field strong enough to overcome the pinning energy were applied , the cdw can be depinned and carries a current . in the following , on the basis of the experimental observations suggesting a cdw development in manganese oxides@xcite@xmath26we tentatively </S>",

    "<S> x - ray diffraction and electron diffraction studies , which were performed on pieces coming from the same part of the crystal , attested that the samples are single phased , and well crystallized . </S>",

    "<S> investigations have shown the existence of twinning domains , which result from the reversible phase transitions ( from cubic to orthorhombic ) undergone by the crystals upon cooling . </S>",
    "<S> the cationic composition derived from energy - dispersive x - ray analyses leads to the formula pr@xmath0ca@xmath3mno@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> four linear contact pads of in were soldered onto the sample in linear four - probe configuration .  </S>",
    "<S> @xmath29 data were taken with current biasing ( keithley 236 ) and with a temperature control of @xmath30 @xmath31 .     in figure 1 , the temperature variation of the resistivity @xmath32 </S>",
    "<S> @xmath33 @xmath34 of a pr@xmath0ca@xmath3mno@xmath2 crystal is shown for various bias current under zero magnetic field . for low current </S>",
    "<S> , the @xmath35 @xmath33 @xmath36 curve displays a pronounced semiconducting - like behavior , leading to an insulating state at low temperatures .  </S>",
    "<S> our current source overloads for @xmath37 , thus the maximum measurable resistance for @xmath38 is around @xmath39 .  for higher current , </S>",
    "<S> the insulating state is no longer observable ; the resistivity is indeed strongly depressed . </S>",
    "<S> there is no true insulator - metal transition but a trend to saturation when the temperature is lowered . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , for high and low currents , one can also denote a clear kink around 230k , which related to the charge ordering phenomenon . </S>",
    "<S> figure 2 shows v - i characteristics for various temperatures ( 60k , 80k , 120k and 140k ) . </S>",
    "<S> a strong non - linearity i. e. a deviation from the ohm s law , is observed when the bias current attains a threshold value ( 0.66 a.@xmath40 at 80k ) .  </S>",
    "<S> this non - linearity is even more obvious when @xmath41 @xmath33 @xmath42 curves are plotted ( see figure 3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> as expected the resistance is independent of the bias current in the ohmic regime and is strongly decreased for a critical value of the current . </S>",
    "<S> one can observe that the current value where the non - linearity sets in and the width of the transition are strongly temperature dependent ( both increase as the temperature increases ) . because of the rounding of the variation of @xmath43 @xmath33 @xmath42 , it is very difficult to define a value for a critical current .    </S>",
    "<S> we have carefully checked that the joule heating is irrelevant to account for this current induced effect .  </S>",
    "<S> the temperature rise of the sample with respect to the sample holder @xmath44 has been measured by attaching a thermometer on the top of the sample itself . in the low temperature range and for the highest power dissipation , </S>",
    "<S> one measure @xmath45 . for higher temperature of measurements </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath46 becomes negligible . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , a great amount of papers have verified this point in samples of the same composition . </S>",
    "<S> the peculiar electrical response that we describe here is in remarkable agreement with previous studies carried out on co / oo manganese oxides.@xcite to account for the nonlinear conduction in co / oo manganese oxides , a special type of dielectric breakdown of the co state brought about by small electric field is invoked . </S>",
    "<S> it is argued that the barrier between the co state and the metallic state is small enough that a small electric field can cause an i - m transition.@xcite  the system behaves in such a way that the bias current may generate metallic path giving rise to resistivity drop . </S>",
    "<S> one can describe this feature by considering coexistence of localized and delocalized electron states with independent path of conduction . </S>",
    "<S> this situation is analogous to what occurs in charge density waves systems.@xcite    in the following , we propose that , for pr@xmath0ca@xmath3mno@xmath10 the non - linearity observed in v - i characteristics can be linked to the collective excitation of the cdw condensate . by analogy with the sliding mode conductivity in nbse@xmath2,@xcite the non - linear transport properties are explained by the motion of charge density waves , which carry a net electrical current , superimposed to the poorly mobile carriers of the system , when the current reaches a critical current necessary to overcome the pinning forces acting on the cdw condensate . </S>",
    "<S> the total current density can then be written : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the current density associated with the motion of the cdw condensate and @xmath49 is the ohmic conductivity at low electric field / current . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamic of the collective mode is described in terms of a position- and time - dependent order parameter , thus both amplitude and phase fluctuation occur . </S>",
    "<S> the relevant collective mode is the phase one which is gapless . </S>",
    "<S> as described by grner et al.@xcite , the phase mode carries a dipole moment as it corresponds to the motion of condensed electrons through the background of position changes of the ions ; consequently , the phase mode carries a current for a wave vector @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> monceau et al.@xcite have developed a model where the phase of the cdw is described as an overdamped oscillator . </S>",
    "<S> the non - linear electrical response is the consequence of the interaction between the phase mode and the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> these interactions lead to a finite pinning energy and consequently to a finite bias current for the non - linear conduction to set in . in the manganese oxides of the system pr@xmath7ca@xmath8mno@xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> , the pinning centers that we are dealing with are not well identified . the pinning is expected on general grounds , e. g. the l / a substitutional disorder that acts as a quenched disorder , other lattice defects or possible homogeneities . to be more precise , in these materials </S>",
    "<S> , the jahn - teller ions mn3 + has a major role . </S>",
    "<S> the jahn - teller induced distortion of the mn3+o6 octahedra can act as a periodic pinning site due to local strain field . very early in the subject@xcite , </S>",
    "<S> these strain fields have been observed by high resolution electron microscopy in pr manganites . </S>",
    "<S> existence of monoclinic domains in the orthorhombic matrix corresponding to a modification of the geometry of the mn@xmath51o@xmath52 octahedra has been reported . at the junction between the two kinds of domains , </S>",
    "<S> a defective structure is observed and can be interpreted as a twin boundary . in the pr managanites , another very important feature deals with the existence of a rather large density of isolated point defects . </S>",
    "<S> once again , this can be associated with the local modification of the manganese environment owing to the jahn - teller effect .    </S>",
    "<S> neglecting inertial effects and considering the phase @xmath53 as uniform through out a given domain , the equation of motion of the phase obtained in the framework of the  single particle  model is :    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is the phase of the domain , @xmath56 is an experimental parameter defined as @xmath57 , @xmath58 is a dimensionless parameter . when the applied current is constant the average electric field is :    @xmath59 ^{\\frac 12}\\ ] ]    where @xmath49 is the ohmic conductivity , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the critical electric field and current , respectively , where the non linearity sets in . introducing the experimental variables @xmath62 , the measured resistance and @xmath42 , the applied current , one obtains :    @xmath63 ^{\\frac 12}\\right]\\ ] ]    according to monceau et al.@xcite , to account for a more realistic description of the sample , we assume that it is formed of multiple domains . a statistical distribution of domains </S>",
    "<S> is then considered , each one being depinned for a given value of @xmath64 , in a mean field approximation . </S>",
    "<S> let us call @xmath65 , the normalized probability to observe the depinning of a domain for a current value in the range @xmath66 and @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath67 is the mean value of this statistical distribution and @xmath68 , the standard deviation . </S>",
    "<S> the resistance of the system is then given by :    @xmath69 ^{\\frac 12% } di_c\\right]\\ ] ]    @xmath70 is a cutoff corresponding to the current for which the first domain is depinned . </S>",
    "<S> the range @xmath71 defines the true ohmic response .    </S>",
    "<S> this model is essentially phenomenological . </S>",
    "<S> the main assumption of the mean field approach is to assume a statistical distribution for critical currents . </S>",
    "<S> originally , monceau et @xmath72.@xcite have used a gaussian distribution without any justification . according to the literature , the properties of the cdw systems are very similar to the typical properties of the wide range of glass materials . </S>",
    "<S> the description of the behaviour of many glass materials often uses the hypothesis about dynamic scaling . on this base , </S>",
    "<S> the dynamic effects in disordered glass material have been considered.@xcite in particular , it was shown that in correlated systems with some disorder , the lognormal distribution for relaxation times is relevant.@xcite the expression of the distribution we have used is : @xmath73\\ ] ] with @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the mean and the standard deviation respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> the results are shown in figure 4 for t = 80k . </S>",
    "<S> one observe a good agreement between the predicted model ( solid lines ) and the experimental @xmath62 @xmath33 @xmath42 curves ( symbols ) . the same agreement is found for other temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> figure 4 can not be considered as experimental evidence by itself . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , in the first part of the paper , we discuss the experimental evidences for the occurrence of a charge density wave in the co manganites . within this framework , </S>",
    "<S> the issue is then to test if a model , which has been successfully applied for archetypal cdw systems , can describe our data . </S>",
    "<S> thus , figure 4 suggests that an analogy between the cdw domains sliding and the non - linear conduction in co manganites might be reliable . in figure 5 , </S>",
    "<S> the distributions calculated from the fit parameters are shown for various temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the temperature dependence of the standard deviation ( @xmath68 ) and mean ( @xmath67 ) are reported in figure 6 . </S>",
    "<S> those two parameters are of great interest since their temperature dependence can be understood in light of our knowledge concerning the stability of the co / oo state in pr@xmath0ca@xmath3mno@xmath2.@xcite the temperature dependence of @xmath68 ( main panel figure 6 ) gives a good picture of the homogeneity of the co / </S>",
    "<S> oo state ( that is at the origin of the development of the cdw condensate ) . from low temperature up to 100 k , there is only a slight variation of @xmath68 with the temperature while above this temperature , the value of @xmath68 is substantially increased . </S>",
    "<S> this feature can be related with the two modulation structure observed by asaka et al.@xcite below 230 k , a co / </S>",
    "<S> oo state of the @xmath12orbitals of the @xmath16 similar to the half - doped pr@xmath13ca@xmath13mno@xmath77 remains essential ( ( co / oo)@xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> while the temperature is decreased , a new modulation structure corresponding to a partial substitution of @xmath16 on the @xmath23 sublattice in ratio 1:3 appears ( ( co / oo)@xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> the ( co / oo)@xmath80 , which is long range for @xmath81 , modifies the uniformity of the charge density , leading to the development of a cdw condensate . </S>",
    "<S> our @xmath68 @xmath33 @xmath36 data can be understood on the basis of this observation . at low temperature , the ( co / oo)@xmath80 state is rather homogenous and long range , leading to a small width of the statistical distribution of @xmath64 since there is not a great variety of domains that have to be depinned . as the temperature increases , the ( co / oo)@xmath80 is no longer long range and a fragmentation of the cdw lattice into smaller domains occurs . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , one observes an increase of the width of the distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature dependence of the mean is less easy to understand ( inset figure 6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it appears that the current necessary to depin a domain increases with temperature . </S>",
    "<S> arguing from analogy with the nbse@xmath2 system , this feature might be related to the size of the ( co / oo)@xmath80 domains where the cdw is developed . in the model proposed by monceau et al.@xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the interactions between pinning centers and the phase of the cdw can be written : @xmath82 $ ] where @xmath83 is the position of a pinning center , @xmath55 , the phase of the cdw and @xmath84 , the ideal value of the phase for an effective pinning . </S>",
    "<S> below 230 k , there is a nucleation of small ( co / oo)@xmath80 / cdw domains at places where the random distribution of pinning centers ( i. e of @xmath85 values ) fixes the phase of the domain in an attractive position corresponding to higher depinning current . </S>",
    "<S> as the temperature decreases down to 100 k , the domains are growing , encompassing less favorable value of @xmath86 and consequently , lower currents are necessary to depin them .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> v - i characteristics have been measured in a pr@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 crystal . </S>",
