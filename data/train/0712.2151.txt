    "properties of hadrons are known to be changed at finite density ( @xmath4 ) and/or temperature ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "thus , it is essential to understand the mechanism of the modification of haronic properties in medium , based on quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) which is the underlying theory of the strong interaction .",
    "the first step to describe hadrons at finite density is to investigate the in - medium modification of the qcd vacuum .    in the present talk ,",
    "we want to study the magnetic susceptibility of the qcd vacuum at the finite quark ( number ) chemical potential ( @xmath6 ) at @xmath7 , which is defined as @xmath8 where @xmath9 stands for the chiral condensate . in principle",
    ", the magnetic susceptibility represents the response of the vacuum in the presence of the external electromagnetic ( em ) field .",
    "moreover , the present study may shed light on the interpretation for the magnetic properties of the compact star from the hadronic origin  @xcite .    here",
    ", we restrict ourselves to the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking ( s@xmath0sb ) phase . we also take into account the nonzero current - quark mass  @xcite .",
    "we observe that , due to the competition between @xmath1 and @xmath6 , the finite current - quark mass changes the magnetic susceptibility drastically , in particular , in the region of higher chemical potentials , compared to the case of the chiral limit : the @xmath10 for the massless quark increases stiffly whereas it is relatively flat or decreases with the finite current - quark mass .",
    "we start with the quark zero - mode equation with the chemical potential in the ( anti)instanton effects in euclidean space : @xmath11\\psi^{(0)}_{i\\bar{i } }   = 0.\\ ] ] note that the quark chemical potential four vector @xmath12 and current - quark mass @xmath1 are explicitly included in the operator .",
    "@xmath13 stands for the ( anti)instanton contribution whereas the @xmath14 denotes the quark zero - mode solution . from this",
    ", the effective quark propagator in the ( anti)instanton effects can be derived as follows : @xmath15,\\ ] ] where @xmath16 denotes the momentum - dependent quark mass , which arises from the fourier transformed zero - mode solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : zm ] ) , and its explicit form is given in ref .",
    "the parameter @xmath17 is chosen to be the vacuum value , @xmath18 mev for simplicity .",
    "as for the effective quark mass , we , however , parameterize it in the following form : @xmath19 ^ 2={\\cal m}_0{\\cal f}^2(i\\partial,\\mu),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for simplicity .",
    "note that this dynamical quark mass is complex in general for @xmath20 .",
    "here we use @xmath21 mev and @xmath22 mev in connection to the instanton packing fraction at vacuum , @xmath23 mev .",
    "note that this parameterization works well in relatively dilute region , @xmath24 mev .",
    "now we are in a position to consider the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vev ] ) with the modified effective action , derived from the instanton vacuum in the presence of the @xmath4 and em field : @xmath25=-{\\rm sp}\\ln\\left [ i\\rlap{/}{d}-i\\rlap{/}{\\mu}+im_q+i{\\cal m}(id,\\mu , m_q)+\\sigma\\cdot \\mathcal{t}\\right ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the functional trace @xmath27 running over dirac and color indices .",
    "the @xmath28 indicates the covariant derivative , @xmath29 , in which @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the quark electric charge and externally induced photon field , respectively .",
    "@xmath32 denotes the external tensor field . performing the functional differentiation with respect to @xmath32 , we obtain the following expression for the vev of eq .",
    "( [ eq : vev ] ) in a operator form : @xmath33+\\bar{{\\cal m}}_f^2 } -\\frac{i\\rlap{/}{d}-i\\rlap{/}{\\mu}-im_q } { -\\partial^2+\\frac{\\sigma\\cdot f}{2}+m_q^2}\\right ] \\sigma_{\\mu\\nu } \\right\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we use the abbreviation @xmath34 for convenience .",
    "@xmath35 is the field strength tensor for the external photon field .",
    "@xmath36 denotes the trace over spin space .",
    "finally we arrive at the expression for the @xmath37 as follows : @xmath38 ^ 2 } -\\frac{m_q}{[p^2+m_q^2]^2 } -\\frac{{\\cal m}'\\cdot(p+i\\mu)}{[(p+i\\mu)^2+\\bar{{\\cal m}}^2]^2}\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 . here",
    "@xmath40 represents the derivative of @xmath41 with respect to @xmath42 .",
    "first , those for the @xmath43 are given in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] in which we draw it in the chiral limit for each contribution separately .",
    "we draw them up to @xmath44 mev .",
    "note that its vacuum value becomes about @xmath45 mev , which is consistent with that computed in ref .",
    "this value is also compatible to that from the qcd sum rules  @xcite . while the nonlocal contributions decrease slightly with respect to the chemical potential , the local one increases slowly .",
    "this difference is due to the different behaviors of @xmath41 and @xmath40 for the @xmath6 .    in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we depict the @xmath10 for different values of the @xmath1 .",
    "we note that the qcd magnetic susceptibilities computed are very stable with respect to @xmath46 .",

    "in the present talk , we have presented the magnetic susceptibility ( @xmath10 ) of the qcd vacuum for the nonzero quark number chemical potential , @xmath20 , based on the nonlocal chiral quark model for @xmath47 , derived from the instanton vacuum in the presence of the chemical potential and external em field .",
    "we also have considered the effect of flavor su(3 ) symmetry breaking .",
    "we found that the qcd magnetic susceptibilities are in general very stable with respect to the chemical potential up to about @xmath48 mev .",
    "when we turn on the current - quark mass , the magnetic susceptibility becomes smaller , in comparison to that for @xmath3 .",
    "we conclude from the present results that the magnetic susceptibility of the qcd vacuum at finite density depends much on the current - quark mass .",
