    "the interaction of high - momentum partons with hot and dense nuclear matter is a key point to the understanding of heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the energy loss of these partons during the traversal of the medium is called jet quenching @xcite .",
    "it results in a suppression of particle production at high transverse momenta , as measured with the nuclear modification factor @xmath5 for hadrons @xcite .",
    "a second consequence is the increased production of soft particles associated with the original high - momentum parton to ensure energy and momentum conservation .",
    "this low-@xmath4enhancement is observable in the modification of fragmentation functions derived from fully reconstructed jets @xcite .",
    "the alice detector at the cern lhc was designed for the study of the quark - gluon plasma created in high - multiplicity heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the central barrel with a large time projection chamber ( tpc ) and the inner tracking system ( its ) with 6 layers of silicon detectors provides tracking with full athimuthal acceptance in @xmath6 .",
    "alice also features two electromagnetic calorimeters at mid - rapidity : the fine - granularity phos covering @xmath7 and @xmath8 and the emcal with coarser granularity but larger acceptance of @xmath9 and @xmath10 in 2010 , increased to @xmath11 in 2011 .",
    "the data presented here are from ppruns at @xmath2 and @xmath12 taken in 2010 , the first pb - pbrun at @xmath3 in fall 2010 and a pprun at the reference energy of @xmath13 in spring 2011 .",
    "@xmath4spectra of neutral mesons in pp collisions are not only an important reference for pb - pb collisions , but also test perturbative qcd at the highest available energies . with calculable parton cross - sections and parton distribution functions in the relevant kinematic region well under control , the main uncertainty comes from fragmentation functions .",
    "pion production with @xmath14 at top lhc energy is dominated by gluon fragmentation , but the gluon fragmentation functions are poorly constrained by measurements of ppcollisions at lower energies and @xmath15 collisions .",
    "neutral meson spectra at lhc energies therefore provide important constraints on gluon fragmentation functions .",
    "alice has measured neutral pions and @xmath1 mesons in ppcollisions at @xmath2 , 2.76 and 7tev using the invariant mass of their two - photon decays , where the photons were either detected by the phos or via conversions with the tpc and its @xcite .",

    "figure [ fig : eta_pi_nlo ] shows the nlo calculation , normalized to the tsallis fit , in comparison with the measured spectra . for @xmath21 , the calculation agrees with the data , while for higher energies it overestimates the data . at 7tev a second calculation @xcite using the bkk ff @xcite shows better agreeement with the data .",
    "the left panel in figure [ fig : eta_pi_nlo ] compares the measured @xmath1 spectra with an nlo calculation using the aesss ff @xcite .",
    "the trend is similar to the dss ff in pion data , showing agreement at 0.9tev and an overestimation at higher energies of 2.76 and 7tev .",
    "the modification of spectra in heavy - ion collisions is commonly expressed with the nuclear modification factor @xmath5 , defined as the ratio of production rates in nucleus - nucleus and ppcollisions , scaled by the number of binary nucleon - nucleon interactions as determined from a glauber calculation : @xmath22     @xmath0yield ( left ) and nuclear modification factor @xmath5 ( right ) in pb - pbcollisions at @xmath23 in 4 centrality bins .",

    "the yields as a function of @xmath4for 4 different centrality bins are shown in the left panel of figure [ fig : pi_raa ] , together with the yield for ppcollisions .",
    "the right panel shows the nuclear modification factor @xmath5 for the same 4 centrality bins .",
    "a clear suppression of high-@xmath4hadron production can be seen that increases from peripheral to central collisions .",
    "the maximum suppression is reached at @xmath25 with an @xmath26 , consistent with the suppression of charged hadrons @xcite . the observed suppression is stronger than at rhic , where phenix reported a value of 0.2 to 0.3 @xcite .",
    "full jet reconstruction can provide a complementary picture to the suppression of single particles as discussed in the previous section . by accounting for low-@xmath4particles ,",
    "the energy lost due to jet quenching can be recovered , so that the redistribution of energy and momentum in the quenching process can be studied in terms of medium - modified fragmentation functions . in order to be sensitive to jet modifications",
    "it is extremely important to minimize the bias on hard fragmentation by applying the lowest possible momentum cut off during jet reconstruction .",
    "we applied various cone and sequential recombination jet reconstruction algorithms to pb - pbcollisions . lacking large acceptance calorimetry in 2010",
    ", the algorithms from the fastjet package were run on charged tracks only with a radius / distance parameter of 0.4 . for this study",
    ", we use the anti-@xmath27 jet finder and subtract the background density @xmath28 as determined by calculating the median @xmath4/area of reconstructed @xmath27 clusters @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : jet_spectra_raw ] shows raw jet spectra for different centralities , reconstructed with a track momentum cut off of @xmath29 ( left ) and @xmath30 ( right ) . while the shapes in the peripheral and central event classes are similar for the high threshold , a strong modification is visible for the low threshold .",
    "this difference is caused by background fluctuations in central events that predominantly appear at low transverse momenta .",
    "these background fluctuations can be studied using different probes in pb - pbcollisions : random cones ( r=0.4 ) , where the @xmath4of all tracks in the cone is summed , embedded single high-@xmath4tracks and embedded pythia - jets . in case of embedding , the same anti-@xmath27 jet finder as for unmodified events",
    "is run and the reconstructed jets are matched to the embedded probe by finding the track or 50% of the embedded jet momentum .",
    "we then define the residuals of the jet measurements as @xmath31 where @xmath32 for random cones .",
    "the residuals for random cones are also analyzed for events where all tracks were randomized in @xmath1 and @xmath33 and where the leading two jets in each event were excluded .",
    "the residuals for random cones , shown in the left panel of figure [ fig : jets_dpt ] , exhibit an assymetric shape that follows a gaussian distribution for @xmath34 and has a tail towards high @xmath4 .",
    "this tail can be attributed to the onset of jet production , which is confirmed when the leading two jets are excluded : the distribution becomes gaussian and is only sensitive to background fluctuations . for randomized events , we again see a gaussian distribution , but with a smaller width than before .",
    "this indicates that the randomization did not only destroy jet - like correlations , but also other region - to - region fluctuations like e.g. elliptic flow .",
    "the right panel in figure [ fig : jets_dpt ] compares the random cones with embedded tracks and jets .",
    "the residuals obtained for these probes are consistent with each other and also match the scaled raw jet spectrum .",
    "this confirms that the broadening of the jet spectrum for the low momentum cut off is caused by background fluctuations .",
    "unfolding of the jet spectra will therefore be necessary .",
    "the fact that the mean of the gaussian distributions , as determined from fits to the left hand side , is close to 0 affirms the validity of the background subtraction .",
