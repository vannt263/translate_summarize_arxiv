    "recent cosmological observations , including distance measurements of type ia supernovae , temperature fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , and large galaxy redshift surveys , have revealed that the expansion of the universe is accelerating .",
    "this phenonemon can not be explained by conventional physics ( see e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "this acceleration may be caused by the existence of an unknown form of energy ( so - called `` dark energy '' ) coming into the energy - momentum tensor in the einstein s field equation .",
    "another possibility is that the general relativity is not the correct theory of gravity on cosmological scales .",
    "observations of the large scale structure of the universe as traced by large spectroscopic galaxy survey are now attracting significant attention as a probe to investigate the nature of dark energy .",
    "for example , the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) signature found in the clustering pattern can be used as a standard ruler to measure the geometry of the universe and then to constrain the equation of state of the dark energy ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "galaxy redshift surveys also provide a useful test of the gravity theory on cosmological scales ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , because the amplitude of the redshift space distortion ( rsd ) induced by peculiar motions is related to the structure growth rate ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the fastsound project is a redshift survey of h@xmath0 emitting galaxies at @xmath15 , aiming at the first significant detection of rsd beyond @xmath16 .",
    "the survey utilizes the fiber multi - object spectrograph ( fmos , @xcite ) on the 8.3 m subaru telescope , which can observe 400 simultaneous near - infrared spectra from within a 30 arcmin diameter field - of - view ( fov ) .",
    "the survey started in march 2012 , and will collect in total @xmath17 galaxy redshifts in four fields with a total survey area of @xmath18 in two years .",
    "the main science goal is to measure the growth rate @xmath3 , where @xmath19 is the evolution of the growth factor @xmath20 with cosmic scale factor @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the total amplitude of matter fluctuations .",
    "the estimated accuracy of the rsd measurement is @xmath23 , ] which would give a stronger constraint on the theory of gravity than currently available from other rsd surveys at @xmath24 .",
    "a key requirement for the fastsound survey design is to determine how to select the target galaxies efficiently from photometric data . to finalize the target selection method for fastsound",
    ", we carried out test observations using fmos in september / october , 2011 , where we tested several selection methods , e.g. , color - based selections versus photometric - redshift - based selections , and pure optical - band selections versus adding near - infrared bands .",
    "the aim of this paper is to report the results of this pilot study .",
    "though the objective here is mainly for the fastsound project , the results will also be useful for efficient selection of emission - line galaxies or star - forming galaxies at high redshifts , which can aid the design of even larger future cosmological surveys .",
    "we will also examine the factors limiting the selection efficiency by comparing our results with the statistics of emission line galaxies detected by narrow - band imaging from the hizels survey ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in  [ sec : target_selection ] , we describe the photometric data used to select targets , the methods of estimating photometric redshifts and h@xmath0 fluxes , and the selection methods tested . in  [ sec : observation ] , the data reduction is presented briefly , followed by the description of the automated emission line detection method used .",
    "the main results are presented in  [ sec : results ] , and we summarize our results in  [ conclusion ] . throughout this paper ,",
    "all magnitudes are given in the ab system , and a standard cosmology of @xmath25 is adopted .",
    "for the fastsound project , we must efficiently select target galaxies which are detectable by fmos in an exposure time of 30 min ( h@xmath0 emission line fluxes of @xmath26}$ ] at @xmath1@xmath2 ) in a survey area of @xmath27 .",
    "we adopted the canada - france - hawaii telescope legacy survey ( cfhtls ) wide as the primary photometric data set for the target selection .",
    "we used the mag_auto magnitudes of @xmath28 , and @xmath29 filters of the @xmath29-selected merged catalogue in the cfhtls - wide w1 and w4 fields generated by @xcite for these test observations .",
    "the approximate limiting magnitudes are @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 respectively ( @xmath35 completeness level for point sources ) .    in @xmath36 of the cfhtls w1 field and @xmath37 of the w4 field ,",
    "near - infrared @xmath8 band data are also available from the ukidss deep extragalactic survey ( ukidss dxs : @xcite ) dr8 , whose limiting magnitude is @xmath38 ( @xmath39 , point - source ) , and we use these data to test the usefulness of adding nir data to the selection criteria .",
    "the galactic extinction was corrected using the @xmath40 maps of @xcite .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)figure1a.eps ( 80mm,80mm)figure1b.eps    ( 80mm,80mm)figure2.eps    the first simple method that we test is a selection by galaxy colors .",
    "we empirically determined the color selection criteria to select galaxies whose h@xmath0 fluxes are expected to be strong , based on h@xmath0 flux estimates from sed fittings and photometric redshift calculations using deep optical+nir photometry of galaxies in the subaru deep field and the subaru xmm - newton deep field ( sumiyoshi et al .",
    "for this observational study we test the following color selection criteria . in the case of selection using only optical photometry of cfhtls wide , we adopt : @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "these conditions are shown in color - color diagrams of figure [ twocolor ] .",
    "in addition to these color conditions , we also adopt a magnitude range of @xmath44 , which is empirically determined from past fmos observations.@xmath6 in this figure the galaxies are color - coded according to photometric redshifts described in  [ estimation ] .",
    "approximately one third of galaxies with @xmath45@xmath2 that we want to observe are populated in the regions of the above conditions , while more than 90% of the galaxies outside this redshift range are rejected .",
    "we varied the magnitude thresholds of @xmath29 in a range of @xmath46@xmath47 so that @xmath4 target galaxies are available for a fov ( see table [ rate ] for values in each field ) .",
    "the photo-@xmath12 distribution of color - selected galaxies is displayed in figure [ photoz_distrib ] .",
    "the distribution of all galaxies found in the primary catalog is overlaid .",
    "the distribution of selected galaxies indeed has its peak at around @xmath48 , though there still remain low - redshift galaxies that would be a contamination in our target sample .    for the test of color selection using the nir @xmath8 band",
    ", we further added a condition of @xmath49 , to account for the redshifted @xmath50   break falling between @xmath51 and @xmath8 .",
    "however , we found that this condition was too strong to retain @xmath52 targets in the fmos fov for the w4 field , and hence the condition was relaxed to @xmath53 ( see  [ sec : observation ] ) .",
    "the second method we tested is based on photometric redshift estimates and h@xmath0 flux estimates from sed fitting . for galaxies brighter than @xmath54 , the cfhtls t0006 official photometric redshifts are available ( @xcite , @xcite ) , and we use these .",
    "the redshift accuracy @xmath55 is around @xmath56 at @xmath57 , @xmath58 at @xmath59 , and @xmath60 at @xmath61 .",
    "however , no photometric redshift estimate is provided for galaxies fainter than @xmath54 due to the poor reliability estimates of the photometry . here ,",
    "since we wish to increase the chance of observing @xmath62 galaxies , we computed photometric redshifts for galaxies at @xmath63 by ourselves using the public code _ lephare _",
    "( @xcite , @xcite ) according to the description of coupon et al . (",
    "when a galaxy is not detected in one of the band filters , the band was simply not used in the photo-@xmath12 calculation .",
    "photometric zero - point calibration using galaxies with known spectroscopic redshifts is important for the accuracy of photometric redshift calculation . since the spectroscopic data of the vvds ( vimos - vlt deep survey : @xcite ; @xcite ) deep and wide survey data are available on the area of cfhtls w1 and w4 respectively , we used them to perform the zero - point calibration of cfhtls wide photometry , although they are outside the redshift range of our survey .",
    "the vvds survey depths are @xmath64 for vvds deep and @xmath65 for vvds wide .",
    "we used galaxies with flags of 24 ( @xmath66 8099% secure redshifts ) , @xmath67 ( one secure spectral feature in emission ) , @xmath68@xmath69 , or @xmath70 ( similar to 24 , 9 but flags for broad line agns ) for both vvds deep and wide to assure secure redshift determination .",
    "galaxies from vvds deep and wide public data with @xmath29 magnitudes brighter than @xmath47 are matched with cfhtls w1 and cfhtls w4 , respectively , and used for the derivation of photometric calibrations .",
    "the sample sizes of vvds - cfhtls are @xmath71 ( cfhtls w1 ) and @xmath72 ( w4 ) , and the redshift medians are @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively .    these photometric redshifts are based on empirical sed templates of ell , sbc , scd , irr ( cww ; @xcite ) , @xmath75 interpolated seds from cww , and two starbursts from kinney et al .",
    "h@xmath0 fluxes can not be estimated simply from these results , because the empirical templates do not include any details on the physical galaxy properties such as stellar mass or star formation rate .",
    "therefore we further performed fitting with theoretical sed templates from pegase2 ( @xcite ) , scalo imf ( @xcite ) and solar abundance , fixing the redshifts at those estimated using the empirical sed templates .",
    "we use @xmath76 models of exponentially declining star formation histories with the exponential time scales ranging @xmath77@xmath78 gyr , and a constant sfr model .",
    "the dust extinction is taken into account assuming the calzetti law ( calzetti et al .",
    "2000 ) in the range of @xmath79@xmath80 .",
    "then we calculate the intrinsic h@xmath0 flux from sfr by the conversion factor which is based on kennicutt ( 1998 ) and of which the offset is calibrated using sdss galaxies ( @xcite , @xcite ) . finally , the observable h@xmath0 flux is calculated taking into account extinction using the @xmath40 value obtained from the sed fit .",
    "here , we followed the prescription of cid fernandes et al .",
    "( 2005 ) to take into account that the extinction of h@xmath0 flux ( from hot ionized gas region ) is generally higher than that of stellar radiation estimated from sed fittings .    for the photo-@xmath12 selection using optical bands , first we selected target galaxies at @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "the constraints on @xmath29 magnitude and color are added empirically , since we learned from the past fmos observations that bluer galaxies have higher probability of detectable emission lines , and that galaxies fainter than @xmath84 are not usually detected at our survey limits",
    ". the dependence of the selection efficiency on the @xmath85 threshold will be discussed in  [ detectionrate ] .",
    "then we select galaxies with bright estimated h@xmath0 fluxes , with a flux threshold determined to keep @xmath52 target galaxies for one fmos field .",
    "the typical threshold flux is @xmath86}$ ] ( see table [ rate ] for the values in each field ) .    in the case of photo-@xmath12 selection",
    "using nir @xmath8 band , we repeated the same procedures as above , except that we calculated photo-@xmath12 s for all the galaxies because the cfhtls official photometric redshifts are based only on the optical bands .",
    "it should be noted that only about 70% of all the cfhtls wide galaxies are detected in the ukidss @xmath8 band , and the fraction in the galaxies selected as the fmos target is also similar .",
    "photo-@xmath12 s of the galaxies not detected in @xmath8 are calculated only with the optical bands , and this may limit the improvement of the line detection rate by adding a nir band . we will also test the effect of including the @xmath87 band on the target selection efficiency in  [ detectionrate ] .    finally , it should also be noted that our target selection does not include particular conditions to remove agns .",
    "therefore we expect a contamination of agns in our sample , but examination of line widths of detected galaxies by our fmos observation indicates that the fraction is not large .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ srphotoz ]        we first examine the color selection described in ",
    "[ color ] using optical data , i.e. , ( 1a ) the @xmath88 color conditions , ( 2a ) the @xmath89 magnitude condition , and ( 3a ) the @xmath29 magnitude condition .",
    "here we adopt the @xmath29 magnitude threshold of @xmath90 , so that there are @xmath91 target galaxies in one fmos field . after adopting the selection criteria ,",
    "@xmath92 target galaxies remain in the region of the hizels data set , and there are @xmath93 hizels h@xmath0 emitters and @xmath94 non - h@xmath0 object .",
    "this means an h@xmath0 detection rate of @xmath95 if the redshift range is scaled to that of fmos ( @xmath96 times larger ) , which is roughly consistent with the actual fmos observation reported in ",
    "[ detectionrate ] . in table",
    "[ srcolor ] , we also show the change of galaxy numbers by adopting the each step of the target selection of ( 1a)(3a ) .",
    "the success rate ( i.e. , the number of h@xmath0 emitters in selected galaxies ) increases by a factor of two using the color condition and three using magnitude conditions , indicating that conditions of color and magnitude are comparably important .",
    "there is only one non - h@xmath0 emitter in the final targets selected , indicating that the contamination of non - h@xmath0 in emission lines of color selection is less than @xmath97 , although the statistical uncertainty is large .",
    "next we examine the optical photo-@xmath12-based selection , i.e. , the conditions on ( 1b ) photometric redshift , ( 2b ) estimated h@xmath0 flux , ( 3b ) @xmath85 color , and ( 4b ) @xmath29 magnitude .",
    "for this region we set @xmath98 threshold to be @xmath99}$ ] to have an appropriate number of targets ( @xmath4 ) in one fmos field .",
    "after these conditions have been adopted , @xmath100 cfhtls galaxies and @xmath101 hizels h@xmath0 emitters are selected , yielding a success rate of @xmath102 scaled into the fastsound redshift range , which is again roughly consistent with the fmos observations .",
    "the change of the success rate by the each step of the selection ( 1b)(4b ) is also shown in table [ srphotoz ] .",
    "this result indicates that the most efficient selection process is obtained by adopting the h@xmath0 threshold , followed by the selection using photometric redshifts .",
    "the empirically introduced conditions of @xmath103 color and @xmath29 magnitude are not very important at least for this sample .    the distribution of photometric redshifts and photo-@xmath12 based estimates of h@xmath0 fluxes for hizels h@xmath0 emitters are displayed in figure [ hist ] , in comparison with those for general cfhtls galaxies .",
    "it is indeed seen that the fraction of hizels h@xmath0 emitters in general cfhtls galaxies increases by choosing galaxies at @xmath104 and with strong estimated h@xmath0 fluxes .",
    "however , considerable fraction of hizels h@xmath0 emitters are rejected by the adopted selection criteria , because of the uncertainties in the estimated redshifts and h@xmath0 fluxes of hizels h@xmath0 emitters which are at @xmath105 and brighter than @xmath106}$ ] ) , as seen in  [ hist ] .",
    "the accuracy of redshift estimation against the correct value ( i.e. , @xmath107 ) is @xmath108 , which is @xmath109 times worse than those reported for cfhtls galaxies ( ilbert et al .",
    "2006 ; coupon et al .",
    "2009 ; see also  [ estimation ] ) .",
    "this is because the objects at @xmath110 are faint ( @xmath111 ) in the cfhtls wide catalogue , and because the accuracy is generally worse for blue ( h@xmath0 emitting ) galaxies than for red galaxies .",
    "the number of non - h@xmath0 emitters in the final selected targets is relatively high : @xmath112 against @xmath101 h@xmath0 emitters , implying a contamination rate of @xmath113 that is considerably higher than that for the color selection in the previous section .",
    "however , by examining the colors of the four non - h@xmath0 objects , we found that three of them are close to the border between h@xmath0 and non - h@xmath0 of the hizels criteria in the color diagrams , and furthermore we can remove h@xmath114+[oiii ] @xmath115 double - emitters using fmos spectra , hence the actual contamination may be reduced .",
    "a statistically larger sample is required to investigate this issue more quantitatively .",
    "in this work we examined several methods to efficiently select h@xmath0 emitting galaxies at @xmath116@xmath2 from existing photometric data in a field of square - degree scales , using near - infrared spectroscopic observations from subaru / fmos .",
    "although quantitatively this work considers the particular case of the fastsound project ( a near - infrared galaxy redshift survey with fmos ) , selecting emission line galaxies efficiently at high redshifts is important for future high - precision cosmological surveys that are now widely being discussed .",
    "the main photometric data set that we used is the cfhtls wide survey , where @xmath117 photometric data are available in four independent fields , over a total of @xmath118 . in order to test the gain from adding near - infrared data",
    ", we also added @xmath8-band data from the ukidss / dxs survey .",
    "we tested two methods of target galaxy selection : one is based on color - color diagrams , and the other is based on photometric estimates of redshifts and h@xmath0 fluxes from sed fitting methods .",
    "therefore we tested four types of target selections , by combination of ( 1 ) color or photo-@xmath12 selections and ( 2 ) using optical data only or optical plus nir @xmath8 band .",
    "eight fmos fields were observed , corresponding to the four types of target selection in each of the two fields of cfhtls w1 and w4 .",
    "emission lines are searched for by an automatic detection software from the reduced spectra , and we calculated the success rates of emission line detection ( @xmath119 ) in galaxies observed by fmos .",
    "the results are : @xmath120 ( color , opt ) , @xmath121 ( color , opt+nir ) , @xmath122 ( photo-@xmath12 , opt ) , and @xmath123 ( photo-@xmath12 , opt+nir ) for cfhtls w1 , and @xmath124 ( color , opt ) , @xmath125 ( color , opt+nir ) , @xmath126 ( photo-@xmath12 , opt ) , and @xmath127 ( photo-@xmath12 , opt+nir ) for cfhtls w4 ( summarized in table [ rate ] ) . though the sample size is not large enough for robust statistics , we find a tendency for higher success rates by using photo-@xmath12 ( @xmath128@xmath113 ) , relative to color selections ( @xmath129 ) . adding nir @xmath8 data does not appear to significantly improve the success rate .",
    "we also examined the target selection methods using the hizels nbh narrow - band galaxy survey catalogue that corresponds to h@xmath0 at @xmath105 .",
    "we classified hizels sources into h@xmath0 and non - h@xmath0 lines , and then applied our target selections to them , in order to clarify what is the main factor limiting the success rate , and how many non - h@xmath0 lines are included as a contamination in the fmos - detected emission lines .",
    "we found that in the photo-@xmath12 selection , both the uncertainties of photo-@xmath12 and estimated h@xmath0 flux are contributing to the relatively low success rate .",
    "we would like to thank david sobral , philip best , ian smail , and hizels team for providing us with the data obtained by the hizels project .",
