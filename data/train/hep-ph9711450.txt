    "it has been realized that the relativistic effects are crucial to describe the low - lying hadrons made of @xmath6 and @xmath7 quarks and anti - quarks@xcite .",
    "the light - cone quark model@xcite takes the advantages of the equal light - cone time(@xmath8 ) quantization and includes the important relativistic effects in the hadronic wave functions .",
    "the distinct features of the light - cone equal-@xmath9 quantization compared to the ordinary equal-@xmath10 quantization may be summarized as the suppression of vacuum fluctuations with the decoupling of complicated zero - modes and the conversion of the dynamical problem from boost to rotation .",
    "the suppression of vacuum fluctuations is due to the rational energy - momentum dispersion relation which correlates the signs of the light - cone energy @xmath11 and the light - cone momentum @xmath12@xcite .",
    "however , the non - trivial vacuum phenomena can still be realized in the light - cone quantization approach if one takes into account the non - trivial zero - mode(@xmath13 ) contributions . as an example",
    ", it is shown@xcite that the axial anomaly in the schwinger model can be obtained in the light - cone quantization approach by carefully analyzing the contributions from zero - modes .",
    "therefore , in the light - cone quantization approach , one can take advantage of the rational energy - momentum dispersion relation and build a clean fock state expansion of hadronic wave functions based on a simple vacuum by decoupling the complicated non - trivial zero - modes .",
    "the decoupling of zero - modes can be achieved in the light - cone quark model since the constituent quark and anti - quark acquire appreciable constituent masses .",
    "furthermore , the recent lattice qcd results@xcite indicated that the mass difference between @xmath14 and pseudoscalar octet mesons due to the complicated nontrivial vacuum effect increases(or decreases ) as the quark mass @xmath15 decreases(or increases ) , @xmath16 , the effect of the topological charge contribution should be small as @xmath15 increases .",
    "this supports us to build the constituent quark model in the light - cone quantization approach because the complicated nontrivial vacuum effect in qcd can be traded off by the rather large constituent quark masses .",
    "one can also provide a well - established formulation of various form factor calculations in the light - cone quantization method using the well - known drell - yan - west(@xmath17 ) frame .",
    "we take this as a distinctive advantage of the light - cone quark model",
    ".    the conversion of the dynamical problem from boost to rotation can also be regarded as an advantage because the rotation is compact , @xmath16 , closed and periodic .",
    "the reason why the rotation is a dynamical problem in the light - cone quantization approach is because the quantization surface @xmath9 = 0 is not invariant under the transverse rotation whose direction is perpendicular to the direction of the quantization axis @xmath18 at equal @xmath9@xcite .",
    "thus , the transverse angular momentum operator involves the interaction that changes the particle number and it is not easy to specify the total angular momentum of a particular hadronic state .",
    "also @xmath9 is not invariant under parity@xcite .",
    "we circumvent these problems of assigning the quantum numbers @xmath19 to hadrons by using the melosh transformation of each constituents from equal @xmath10 to equal @xmath9 .    in our light - cone quark model of mesons ,",

    "is given by @xmath38 in the spin - averaged meson mass scheme@xcite , @xmath36 was taken as the average of physical masses with appropriate weighting factors from the spin degrees of freedom . nevertheless , once the best fit parameters were used@xcite , both schemes provided the predictions that were not only pretty similar with each other but also remarkably good@xcite compared to the available experimental data@xcite for form factors , decay constants , charge radii @xmath5 of various light pseudoscalar(@xmath0 ) and vector(@xmath1 ) mesons as well as their radiative decay widths .",
    "the main difference in the best fit parameters was the constituent quark masses , @xmath16 , @xmath39= 330 mev , @xmath40= 450 mev in the spin - averaged meson mass scheme@xcite while @xmath39= 250 mev , @xmath40= 370 mev in the invariant meson mass scheme@xcite .",
    "also , among the literatures@xcite using the invariant meson mass scheme , some literatures@xcite used the jacobi factor @xmath26 in eq.(1.2 ) while some@xcite did not .",
    "however , we have recently observed@xcite that the numerical results of various physical observables from refs.@xcite were almost equivalent to those of ref.@xcite regardless of the presence - absence of the jacobi factor if the same form of radial wave function(@xmath41 gaussian ) was chosen and the best fit model parameters in the radial wave function were used .    however , the effect from the difference in the choice of radial wave function , @xmath41 , harmonic oscillator wave function@xcite versus power - law wave function@xcite , was so substantial that one could not get the similar result by simply changing the model parameters in the chosen radial wave function .",
    "for example , in the phenomenology of various meson radiative decays at low @xmath42 , we observed@xcite that the gaussian type wave function was clearly better than the power - law wave function in comparison with the available experimental data . on the other hand , the radial function so far has been mostly taken as a model wave function rather than as a solution of qcd motivated dynamical equation . even though the authors in ref.@xcite adopted the quark potential model developed by godfrey and isgur@xcite to reproduce the meson mass spectra , their model predictions included neither the mixing angles of @xmath3 and @xmath4 nor the form factors for various radiative decay processes of pseudoscalar and vector mesons .    in this work",

    "the eq.(2.5 ) satisfy the ( mass)@xmath80 eigenvalue equation @xmath199 taking into account su(3 ) symmetry breaking , we use the following parametrization for @xmath200 suggested by scadron@xcite @xmath201 the parameter @xmath202 characterizes the strength of the quark - annihilation graph which couples the @xmath203=0 @xmath204 state to @xmath203=0 @xmath205 states with equal strength in the exact su(3 ) limit .",
    "the parameter @xmath149 , however , pertains to su(3 ) symmetry breaking such that the quark - annihilation graph factors into its flavor parts , with @xmath202 , @xmath206 and @xmath207 for the @xmath208 , @xmath209(or @xmath210 , and @xmath211 processes , respectively .",
    "of course , @xmath212 in the su(3 ) exact limit .",
    "also , in eq.(b2 ) , @xmath213 and @xmath214 describe the masses of the corresponding mesons in the absence of mixing .    solving eqs.(2.5),(b1 ) , and ( b2 ) , we obtain eq.(2.6 ) and @xmath215 the eqs.(b3 ) and ( b4 ) are identical to the two constraints , tr(@xmath200)= tr(@xmath216 ) and det(@xmath200)= det(@xmath216 ) .",
    "the sign of @xmath217 is fixed by the signs of the @xmath202 and @xmath149 from eq.(b5 ) .",
    "also , since eq.(b2 ) is decoupled from the subspace of @xmath218 , the physical masses of @xmath219 and @xmath220 are confirmed to be the masses of @xmath221 and @xmath222 , respectively , as we used in sec.ii to fix the parameters @xmath223 ) .    given the fixed physical masses of @xmath224 and @xmath225 together with @xmath226 , the magnitudes of mixing angles for @xmath4 and @xmath3 now depend only on the masses of @xmath86 and @xmath85 , respectively , from eq.(2.5 ) .",
    "however , from eqs.(b3)-(b5 ) , one can see that the sign of mixing angle depends on the sign of parameter @xmath149 . while @xmath227 is well supported by the particle data group@xcite(@xmath228 ) , the sign of @xmath229 is not yet definite at the present stage of phenomenology .",
    "regarding on the sign of @xmath229 , it is interesting to note that @xmath230(@xmath16 , @xmath231 ) is favored in refs.@xcite , while the conventional gell - mann - okubo mass formula for the exact su(3 ) limit(@xmath212 ) predicts @xmath232 in the linear mass scheme and @xmath233(@xmath16 , @xmath234 ) in the quadratic mass scheme@xcite .",
    "our predictions for the @xmath3 and @xmath4 mixing angles are given in sec.ii .",
    "the corresponding results of the mixing parameters @xmath235 and @xmath236 in eqs.(b3 ) and ( b4 ) are obtained for the ho[linear ] potential as follows @xmath237m^{2}_{\\pi}\\hspace{.1cm}\\mbox{gev}^{2 } , \\hspace{.3 cm } x_{v}= \\pm2.10[\\pm3.08],\\nonumber\\\\ \\lambda_{p}&= & 13.5[13.3]m^{2}_{\\pi}\\hspace{.1cm}\\mbox{gev}^{2 } , \\hspace{.3 cm } x_{p}= 0.84[0.85].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] our values of @xmath238 and @xmath239 for both ho and linear potential cases are not much different from the predictions of ref.@xcite .",
    "the reason why @xmath238 is much smaller than @xmath239 , @xmath16 , @xmath240\\lambda_{v}$ ] in our ho[linear ] case and @xmath241 in ref.@xcite , may be attributed to the fact that in the quark - annihilation graph , the @xmath52 annihilation graph involves one more gluon compared to the @xmath58 annihilation graph .",
    "this also indicates the strong departure of @xmath4 from the ideal mixing .",
    ".optimized quark masses @xmath242 and the gaussian parameters @xmath243 for both harmonic oscillator and linear potentials obtained from the variational principle . @xmath244=@xmath245 and @xmath246 .",
