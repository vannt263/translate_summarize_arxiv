    "although several attempts have been so far made to reveal the _ shapes _ ( e.g. , the degree of oblateness or triaxiality ) of dark matter halos in galaxies ( e.g. , sackett & sparke 1990 ; franx , van gorkom , & de zeeuw 1994 ; olling 1995 ; salucci & persic 1997 ; sackett 2003 in this conference ) , _ rotational properties _ of dark matter halos have been less discussed .",
    "based on the detailed analysis of structure and kinematics of the very extended hi disk around ngc 2915 , bureau et al ( 1999 ) first suggested that the observed spiral - like structures in the hi disk can be formed by a triaxial halo with figure rotation .",
    "however , it is unclear whether a triaxial dark halo with figure rotation is really responsible for the observed extended spiral structures in ngc 2915 , because of the lack of numerical studies of gas dynamics in the gravitational potentials of triaxial halos with figure rotation .",
    "also it is an important problem to understand _ how figure rotation of a dark matter halo in a disk galaxy influences dynamical evolution , star formation history , and chemical evolution of the disk _ , because previous theoretical / numerical studies so far have not extensively investigated such influence of figure rotation of dark matter halos .",
    "therefore , we here investigate numerically ( 1 ) whether the observed ngc 2915 s giant hi spirals can be formed by tidal force of the figure rotation of the triaxial dark halo and ( 2 ) how the figure rotation of a triaxial dark halo in a disk galaxy influences the formation of stellar bars and spiral arms within it .",
    "we consider an extended uniform gas disk of a dwarf galaxy embedded by a triaxial dark matter halo with figure rotation .",
    "we adopt treesph codes described in bekki ( 1997 ) for hydrodynamical evolution of galaxies and thereby investigate the dynamical evolution of the gas disk under the triaxial dark halo ( the details of the model are given in bekki & freeman 2002 ) .",
    "the unusually extended hi gas in ngc 2915 is modeled as an uniform thin gas disk with the size ( represented by @xmath0 ) of 15 kpc and the mass ( @xmath1 ) of 10@xmath2 @xmath3 .",
    "the gas disk with uniform radial density distribution is represented by 20k sph particles and each gas particle is first placed in the @xmath4-@xmath5 plane and given its circular velocity ( determined by the dark matter halo ) at its radius .",
    "the gas disk is then inclined by @xmath6 degree with respect to the @xmath4-@xmath5 plane .",
    "an isothermal equation of state is used for the gas with a temperature of @xmath7 k corresponding to a sound speed of 4 km @xmath8 ( @xmath9 0.075 times the virial velocity of the system ) .",
    "this extended and inclined gas disk is assumed to be dynamically affected _ only _ by a massive dark matter halo with the mass @xmath10 of 10@xmath11 @xmath3 and we adopt the density distribution of the nfw halo ( navarro , frenk & white 1996 ) suggested from cdm simulations : @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the central density and the scale length of a dark halo , respectively .",
    "we take the isodensity surfaces of the dark halo to be triaxial ellipsoids on which the cartesian coordinates ( @xmath4,@xmath5,@xmath15 ) satisfy the following condition ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) : @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are the parameters which determine the two axis ratios of a triaxial body ( i.e. , long to short and long to middle ) . in the present study , @xmath17 is set to be 1 and the long - axis is initially coincident with the @xmath4 axis . accordingly",
    "@xmath18 ( @xmath20 1 ) and @xmath19 ( @xmath20 1 ) are free parameters which determine the shapes of triaxial dark matter halos .",
    "the triaxial halo is assumed to be rotating as a solid body with the pattern speed of @xmath21 . by changing the parameters @xmath0 , @xmath22 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath23",
    ", we investigate morphological evolution of extended gas disks and its dependence on shapes and rotational properties of triaxial halos .",
    "the parameter values of @xmath0 , @xmath22 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath23 are 15 kpc , 30@xmath24 , 0.8 , 0.6 , and 3.84 km s@xmath25 kpc@xmath25 , respectively , in _ the standard model _ ( model 1 ) . in the following ,",
    "our units of mass , length , and time are @xmath26 m@xmath27 (= m@xmath28 ) , 15 kpc , and 2.74 @xmath29 @xmath30 yr , respectively .",
    "figure 1 describes how gaseous spiral arms are formed , as the triaxial halo rigidly rotates in the standard model ( model 1 ) .",
    "owing to the difference in angular speed between the gas disk and the triaxial halo , the gas disk continuously suffer from the strong tidal force of the halo . as a natural result of this , two open trailing arms",
    "are gradually developed in the entire disk within 1 gyr ( @xmath31 = 4 ) .",
    "these two open arms quickly wind with each other to form a central high - density , ring - like structure at @xmath32 @xmath9 0.3 ( 4.5 kpc ) in our units ( @xmath31 = 6 and 8) .",
    "annular low - density gaseous regions ( 0.3 @xmath33 @xmath32 @xmath33 0.5 in our units ) forms just outside the inner ring because of the disk s angular momentum redistribution caused by the halo s torque ( @xmath31 = 10 ) .",
    "thus our simulations first confirms the early suggestion ( bureau et al .",
    "1999 ) that the observed unusually extended spiral arms of ngc 2915 can be due to the tidal torque of the triaxial dark matter halo with figure rotation .",
    "figure rotation of triaxial dark matter halos can significantly influence not only the formation of stellar bars , spiral arms , and warps but also gas dynamics and star formation histories in gas - rich galaxies ( bekki & freeman 2002 ; bekki & freeman 2003 , in preparation ) . here",
    "we summarize briefly numerical results on stellar bar formation ( hereafter `` halo - triggered bar '' formation ) in disk galaxies embedded by triaxial ( and spherically symmetric ) dark matter halos with and without figure rotation ( the details of the numerical models will be given in bekki & freeman 2003 ) . based on fully self - consistent models ( i.e. , `` live '' halo , and self - gravitating exponential disks ) , we numerically investigated the shapes and the pattern speed of bars formed in disks embedded by dark matter halos with different pattern speeds of figure rotation , different radial density profiles ( e.g. , with or without central cusps / cores ) , different mass ratios of halos to disks ( @xmath34 ) , and different shapes of the halos .",
    "the results are summarized as follows : ( 1 ) stellar bars can be formed in disks embedded by triaxial dark halos with figure rotation , even if @xmath34 is 5 , for which no bars can form in models with spherically symmetric halos , ( 2 ) triaxial shapes and figure rotation disappears a few gyr after the formation of stellar bars in the halos owing to the mutual dynamical interaction ( i.e. , dynamical friction ) between disk and halo components , ( 3 ) stellar bars are less likely to form in dark halos with cuspy radial distributions of the halos ( i.e. , bar formation is more likely in halos with the density profiles decribed by salucci & burkert 2000 ) , ( 4 ) the pattern speeds of the developed bars in triaxial dark matter halos with figure rotation and with larger @xmath34 ( @xmath35 10 ) are much lower than those of bars formed in a spontaneous way ( i.e. , due to bar instability ) for massive disk models ( @xmath36 ) , and ( 5 ) morphological properties of halo - triggered bars appear to be more similar to those of `` tidal bars '' ( noguchi & ishibashi 1986 ) that can be formed in interacting / merging galaxies .",
    "the above result ( 1 ) implies that bar formation is still possible in low luminosity lsbs that are observed to be dominated by dark matter halos , if the halos have figure rotation .",
    "if disk galaxies grow slowly by accretion of gas and satellite galaxies over @xmath9 10 gyr , ( younger ) high - z disk galaxies are likely to have larger @xmath34 and thus be less likely to develop stellar bars within the disks owing to spontaneous bar instability . therefore , if high - z disk galaxies have bars , some of these disks could be embedded by triaxial dark halos with figure rotation . the above result ( 2 )",
    "implies that lower - z dark halos are less likely to show triaxial shapes and figure rotation because of the long - term dynamical interaction between the halo - triggered bars and the halos . regarding this point , bcd ngc 2915 and its triaxial halo could be formed relatively recently ( though we can not specify the possible physical reasons for its late formation ) .",
    "non - axisymmetric barred structures ( either in dark matter halos or in stellar disks ) have been suggested to cause rapid and efficient radial gas transfer to the central regions of galaxies and thus be responsible for the formation of central starbursts ( e.g. , noguchi & ishibashi 1986 ; bekki & freeman 2002 ) .",
    "our numerical results accordingly suggest that _ ( a ) starbursts in galaxies can be triggered by tidal force of their triaxial dark halos with figure rotation _ and _ ( b ) such halo - triggered starbursts are possible even in the higher redshift universe where disk galaxies are less strongly self - gravitating and spontaneous bar formation is thus highly unlikely , if the halos have figure rotation . _",
    "we therefore suggest that star formation histories of disk galaxies can be significantly different between those with and without triaxial shapes and figure rotation of dark matter halos at high redshifts .",
    "lastly we stress that we have so far shown just two examples of the possible important roles of figure rotation of triaxial dark halos in galaxy evolution : several important gravitational effects of these halos are yet to be explored such as dynamical effects of these halos on warp formation and on growth of central bulges in disk galaxies ."
