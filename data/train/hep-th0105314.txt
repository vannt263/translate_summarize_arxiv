    "in this paper , we gain further insight into type 0 d - branes by working out the descent relations for type 0 theories .",
    "sen s descent relations in the type ii theories relate different d - branes through operations of orbifolding and tachyon kinking .",
    "these relations form an interlocking chain of relationships between the different types of d - branes .",
    "although the type 0 theories are in many ways similar to the type ii theories , it is not immediately clear how one should draw the descent relation diagram since type 0 theories have twice the number of d - branes .",
    "this problem is addressed in sections 3 through 5 .",
    "sections 1 and 2 serve as very brief introductions to the type 0 theories and their d - brane content . in section 3",
    ", we review the descent relations in type ii theories and we manage to rule out certain combinations of type 0 d - branes from having any starring role in the type 0 descent relations . in sections 4 and 5 ,",
    "we uncover how the type 0 d - branes are related via orbifolds and kinks , respectively . by the end of section 5",
    ", we have pieced together the type 0 descent relations .",
    "section 6 demonstrates the fundamental distinction between the two types of d - branes in type 0 theories .",
    "we show in this last section that the two types of d - branes , d+ branes and d@xmath0 branes , have opposite charges with respect to all ( ns@xmath0,ns@xmath0 ) fields",
    ". we will also show how a general disk amplitude with a d+ relates to the same amplitude with a d@xmath0 .",
    "type ii superstring theories are composed of left and right moving pieces which reside in one of four sectors , ns@xmath1 and r@xmath1 . the + and @xmath0 here denote the value of the worldsheet fermion number operator , @xmath2 , not to be confused with the @xmath3 operator to be introduced later . at first blush , it appears as though there are on the order of @xmath4 possible string theories , each factor of 2 coming from whether or not a given theory contains a particular combination of sectors .",
    "several consistency conditions pare this enormous number of possibilities to only four .",
    "two of these are the type iia and iib theories .",
    "the other two are the less familiar type 0a and 0b theories .",
    "the consistency conditions are as follows ( for a review , see @xcite ) :    * level matching * : the first condition we use to rule out some theories is the level matching condition @xmath5 .",
    "the ns@xmath0 sector has half - integer levels while the ns+ , r+ , and r@xmath0 have integer levels .",
    "therefore , ns@xmath0 can not be paired with any of the other three sectors .",
    "* mutual locality * : all pairs of vertex operators must be mutually local .",
    "that is , the phase obtained by taking one vertex operator in a circle around the other must be unity or else there is phase ambiguity in the amplitude .",
    "* closed ope * : the ope of the vertex operators in the theory must be in terms of vertex operators that are also present in the theory .",
    "* modular invariance * : modular invariance requires that there be at least one left moving r sector and at least one right moving r sector .",
    "the only four theories that satisfy these simple consistency requirements are the type iia and iib theories , @xmath6 and the type 0a and 0b theories , @xmath7 the perturbative spectra of the type 0 theories contain no spacetime fermions . in the ns - ns sectors ,",
    "the low - lying states are the tachyon from ( ns@xmath0,ns@xmath0 ) and the graviton , antisymmetric tensor , and dilaton from ( ns@xmath8,ns@xmath8 ) .",
    "the type 0 theories have twice as many massless r - r states as the type ii theories .",
    "in particular , type 0a has two r - r 1-forms and two r - r 3-forms ; type 0b has two r - r scalars , two r - r 2-forms , and one r - r 4-form with an unconstrained 5-form field strength .",
    "the fact that the type 0 theories have twice as many r - r fields as the type ii theories is an indication that there may be twice as many stable d - branes in type 0 as compared to type ii .",
    "this turns out to be correct and can be understood quite directly by examining d - branes in the boundary state formalism ( for a review , see @xcite ) . in this formalism , d - branes are represented by boundary states for the physical closed strings .",
    "these boundary states are themselves coherent closed string states .    in both the type ii and type 0 theories , there are four types of boundary states for each  p , @xmath9 ) .",
    "linear combinations of these states must be taken to form d - brane boundary states which , in turn , must be gso - invariant and must satisfy certain consistency conditions @xcite .",
    "the d - brane boundary states in the type 0 theories are as follows : @xmath10 @xmath11 using @xmath12 to denote @xmath13 , the @xmath14 states correspond to stable d - branes .",
    "we see from the minus sign in front of the r - r boundary states that the @xmath15 states correspond to stable anti - d - branes .",
    "the @xmath16 states correspond to unstable d - branes .",
    "let us pause for a second to make a remark on d - brane stability .",
    "the condition for stability is that the spectrum of open strings on the d - brane does not contain a tachyon .",
    "it is important not to confuse this condition with being bps .",
    "of course , none of the d - branes can be bps in the type 0 theories since there is no supersymmetry to begin with ; there are no fermions in the absence of d - branes .",
    "it just so happened for d - branes in the type ii theories that the conditions of stability and bps coincided .",
    "it will be important for our purposes to find the spectra of open strings living on or between d - branes .",
    "the details can be found in appendix a and the results for type 0 d - branes are given in tables 1 and 2 .",
    "the spectra in table 1 can be extrapolated to all possibilities by noting that a given spectrum is invariant under the replacements d @xmath17 @xmath18 and/or @xmath19 .",
    "for example , from the first line of table 1 , we see that the open strings beginning on a dp+ and ending on a dp+ are ns+",
    ". therefore , the strings beginning on a @xmath18p+ and ending on a @xmath18p+ are ns+ .",
    "similarly , strings beginning on a dp@xmath0 and ending on a dp@xmath0 ( or beginning on a @xmath18p@xmath0 and ending on a @xmath18p@xmath0 ) are also ns+ .",

    "we see that there are two tachyons among the open strings stretched between a @xmath24 and a @xmath15 .",
    "one tachyon starts ( at @xmath20 ) on the @xmath24 and ends ( at @xmath21 ) on the @xmath25 , and the other tachyon starts on the @xmath15 and ends on the @xmath24 .",
    "this indicates an instability in the d@xmath18 pair .",

    "we see in table 2 , as expected , that there is a tachyon living on the unstable @xmath28 d - branes .",
    "sen s descent relations give relations between different d - brane configurations in the type ii theories ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "the two important operations are orbifolding by @xmath3 , where @xmath29 is the spacetime fermion number of the left - movers , and kinking the tachyon field that lives on unstable configurations of d - branes . starting with a coincident d(2p)@xmath18(2p ) pair in type iia , orbifolding by @xmath3 yields an unstable @xmath30 in type iib .",
    "orbifolding one more time leaves us with a stable d(2p ) in the type iia theory . starting again with the d(2p)@xmath18(2p ) pair in type iia , but this time kinking the tachyon field that lives on the d - branes , we are left with an unstable @xmath31 in type iia .",
    "kinking the remaining tachyon field gives us a stable d(2p@xmath02 ) in type iia .",
    "the results are similar if we start with a d(2p+1)@xmath18(2p+1 ) pair in type iib .",

    "vertical arrows denote the tachyonic kink . + a similar diagram exists with @xmath32 .",
    "it is important to stress that the value of @xmath12 in @xmath24 does not just affect the r - r charges of the d - brane .",
    "it has an important effect on many string amplitudes .",
    "in fact , we will be able to show below that dp+ and dp@xmath0 branes have the same tadpole couplings to all ( ns+,ns+ ) fields and opposite tadpole couplings to all ( ns@xmath0,ns@xmath0 ) fields .",
    "let us first try to see the opposite tachyon charges of the dp+ and dp@xmath0 at the level of a string calculation .",
    "emission of a tachyon from a d - brane in a type 0 theory is given by a disk amplitude with the tachyon vertex operator in the bulk and appropriate boundary conditions on the edge .",
    "note from ( [ dbranebc ] ) that these boundary conditions depend on @xmath12 .",
    "equations ( [ dbranebc ] ) are in terms of the fields defined on the upper half plane , so once we map our tachyon amplitude to the upper half plane , the following @xmath12-dependent equations must hold on the real axis : @xmath35 the doubling trick @xcite extends the string calculation to the entire complex plane by defining @xmath36 on the lower half plane . in actual calculations , @xmath37 and @xmath38",
