    "this paper is concerned with the problem of estimating stationary ergodic processes with finite alphabet from a sample , an observed length @xmath0 realization of the process , with the @xmath1-distance being considered between the process and the estimated one .",
    "the @xmath2-distance was introduced by ornstein  @xcite and became one of the most widely used metrics over stationary processes .",
    "two stationary processes are close in @xmath1-distance if there is a joint distribution whose marginals are the distributions of the processes such that the marginal processes are close with high probability ( see section  [ secappl ] for the formal definition ) .",
    "the class of ergodic processes is @xmath1-closed and entropy is @xmath1-continuous , which properties do not hold for the weak topology  @xcite .",
    "ornstein and weiss  @xcite proved that for stationary processes isomorphic to i.i.d .",
    "processes , the empirical distribution of the @xmath3-length blocks is a strongly consistent estimator of the @xmath3-length parts of the process in @xmath1-distance if and only if @xmath4 , where @xmath5 denotes the entropy of the process .",
    "csiszr and talata  @xcite estimated the @xmath0-length part of a stationary ergodic process @xmath6 by a markov process of order @xmath7 .",
    "the transition probabilities of this markov estimator process are the empirical conditional probabilities , and the order @xmath8 does not depend on the sample .",
    "they obtained a rate of convergence of the markov estimator to the process @xmath6 in @xmath1-distance , which consists of two terms .",
    "the first one is the bias due to the error of the approximation of the process by a markov chain .",
    "the second term is the variation due to the error of the estimation of the parameters of the markov chain from a sample .    in this paper , the order @xmath7 of the markov estimator process is estimated from the sample .",
    "for the order estimation , penalized maximum likelihood ( pml ) with general penalty term is used .",
    "the resulted markov estimator process finds a tradeoff between the bias and the variation as it uses shorter memory for faster memory decays of the process @xmath6 .",
    "if the process @xmath6 is a markov chain , the pml order estimation recovers its order asymptotically with a wide range of penalty terms",
    ".    not only an asymptotic rate of convergence result is obtained but also an explicit bound on the probability that the @xmath1-distance of the above markov estimator from the process @xmath6 is greater than @xmath9 .",
    "it is assumed that the process @xmath6 is non - null , that is , the conditional probabilities of the symbols given the pasts are separated from zero , and that the continuity rate of the process @xmath6 is summable and the restricted continuity rate is uniformly convergent .",
    "these conditions are usually assumed in this area  @xcite .",
    "the summability of the continuity rate implies that the process is isomorphic to an i.i.d .",
    "process  @xcite .",
    "the above result on statistical estimation of stationary ergodic processes requires a non - asymptotic analysis of the markov order estimation for not necessarily finite memory processes . in this paper",
    ", this problem is also investigated in more generality : under milder conditions than it would be needed for the above bound and not only for the pml method .",
    "a popular approach to the markov order estimation is the minimum description length ( mdl ) principle  @xcite .",
    "this method evaluates an information criterion for each candidate order based on the sample and the estimator takes the order for which the value is minimal . the normalized maximum likelihood ( nml )  @xcite and the krichevsky",
    " trofimov ( kt )  @xcite code lengths are natural information criteria because the former minimizes the worst case maximum redundancy for the model class of @xmath10-order markov chains , while the latter does so , up to an additive constant , with the average redundancy . the bayesian information criterion ( bic )",
    "@xcite can be regarded as an approximation of the nml and kt code lengths .",
    "the pml is a generalization of bic ; special settings of the penalty term yield the bic and other well - known information criteria , such as the akaike information criterion ( aic )  @xcite .",
    "there are other methods for markov order estimation , see  @xcite and references there , and the problem can also be formulated in the setting of hypothesis testing @xcite .",
    "if a process is a markov chain , the nml and kt markov order estimators are strongly consistent if the candidate orders have an upper bound @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "without such a bound , they fail to be consistent @xcite .",
    "the bic markov order estimator is strongly consistent without any bound on the candidate orders  @xcite .",
    "if a process has infinite memory , the markov order estimators are expected to tend to infinity as @xmath12 .",
    "the concept of context trees of arbitrary stationary ergodic processes is a model more complex than markov chains .",
    "recent results  @xcite in that area imply that this expectation holds true for the bic and kt markov order estimators but they provide no information about the asymptotics of the divergence .    in this paper ,",
    "the divergence of the pml , nml and kt markov order estimators for not necessarily finite memory processes is investigated .",
    "not only asymptotic rates of divergence are obtained but also explicit bounds on the probability that the estimators are greater and less , respectively , than some order . instead of the usual assumption of non - nullness , it is assumed only that the conditional probabilities of one of the symbols given the pasts are separated from zero .",
    "this property is called weakly non - nullness and is `` noticeably weaker '' than non - nullness  @xcite .",
    "first , the process is assumed to be weakly non - null and @xmath13-summable .",
    "the @xmath14-summability  @xcite is a condition weaker than the summability of the continuity rate . under these conditions ,",
    "a bound on the probability that the estimators are greater than some order is obtained , that yields an @xmath15 upper bound on the estimated order eventually almost surely as @xmath12 .    then , a bound on the probability that the estimators are less than some order is obtained assuming that the process is weakly non - null and the decay of its continuity rates is in some exponential range .",
    "this bound implies that the estimators satisfying the conditions attain a @xmath16 divergence rate eventually almost surely as @xmath12 , where the coefficient @xmath17 depends on the range of the continuity rates . the class of processes with exponentially decaying continuity rate is considered in various problems  @xcite",
    ". fast divergence rate of the estimators are expected only for a certain range of continuity rates .",
    "clearly , the estimators do not have a fast divergence rate if the memory decay of the process is too fast . on the other hand , too slow memory decay",
    "is also not favored to a fast divergence rate because then the empirical probabilities do not necessarily converge to the true probabilities .    to provide additional insight into the asymptotics of markov order estimators ,",
    "the notion of consistent markov order estimation is generalized for infinite memory processes .",
    "a markov order estimator is compared to its oracle version , which is calculated based on the true distribution of the process instead of the empirical distribution .",
    "the oracle concept is used in various problems , see , for example , @xcite .",
    "if the decay of the continuity rate of the process is faster than exponential , the ratio of the pml markov order estimator with sufficiently large penalty term to its oracle version is shown to converge to @xmath18 in probability .",

    "notation and definitions are introduced for stationary ergodic processes with finite alphabets . in section  [ secic ] , the pml , nml and kt information criteria are introduced .",
