    "the euro ( @xmath0 ) is a _ bona fide _ currency introduced by the european community on jan . 01 , 1999 @xcite in contrast to the @xmath10 which was a theoretical  basket  of currencies .",
    "the @xmath0 is superseding national currencies in eleven countries of the european union which have been found to meet the five requirements of the maastricht convergence criteria @xcite : price stability , fiscal prudence , successful european monetary system membership , and interest - rates convergence in particular . in order to test @xmath0 behavior and understand various features ,",
    "we have extrapolated the @xmath0 backwards and therefore have obtained a _ false euro _ ( @xmath1 ) dating back to 1993 .",
    "we have reconstructed the exchange rates of the @xmath1 with respect to several currencies of interest not belonging to the @xmath0 , i.e. , danish kroner ( @xmath2 ) , swiss franc ( @xmath3 ) , japanese yen ( @xmath4 ) and u.s .",
    "dollar ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the @xmath2 is a currency for a country belonging to the european community and outside the @xmath0 system .",
    "the @xmath3 is a european currency for a country not belonging to the european system .",
    "the @xmath4 and @xmath5 are both major currencies outside europe .",
    "the irrevocable conversion rates of the participating countries have been fixed by political agreement based on various considerations and the bilateral market rates of december 31 , 1998 @xcite . using these rates one _ false _ euro ( @xmath1 )",
    "can be represented as an unweighted sum of the eleven currencies @xmath11 , @xmath12 :    @xmath13    where @xmath14 are the conversion rates and @xmath11 denote the respective currencies , i.e. austrian schilling ( @xmath15 ) , belgian franc ( @xmath16 ) , finnish markka ( @xmath17 ) , german mark ( @xmath7 ) , french franc ( @xmath18 ) , irish pound ( @xmath19 ) , italian lira ( @xmath20 ) , luxembourg franc ( @xmath21 ) , dutch guilder ( @xmath22 ) , portuguese escudo ( @xmath9 ) , spanish peseta ( @xmath23 ) . in order to study correlations in the @xmath0 exchange rates as of now , the @xmath0 existence can be artificially extended backward , i.e. , before jan . 01 , 1999 .",
    "this can be done by applying eq.(1 ) to each participating currency for the time interval of the exchange rates which are available before jan .",
    "01 , 99 , thereby defining a more or less legal ( but @xmath24 ) @xmath1 before its birth .",
    "nevertheless we drop the letter @xmath25 in @xmath1 thereafter .",
    "we are concerned with the behavior of @xmath0 toward currencies which are outside the european union , since nowadays these are the only exchange rates of interest .",
    "these are e.g. danish kroner ( @xmath2 ) , swiss franc ( @xmath3 ) , japanese yen ( @xmath4 ) and u.s .",
    "dollar ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "therefore , we construct a data series of @xmath0 toward e.g. japanese yen ( @xmath0/@xmath4 ) following the artificial rule :    @xmath26    however , the number of data points of the exchange rates for the period starting jan . 1 , 1993 and ending dec . 31 ,",
    "1998 is different for these eleven currencies toward @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "this is due to different national and bank holidays when the banks are closed and official exchange rates are not defined in some countries .",
    "the number @xmath27 of data points has been equalized as done in @xcite , assuming that the exchange rate does not change if there is such a gap ( usually a holiday ) , such that @xmath28 , spanning the interval time from january 1 , 1993 till october 31 , 2000 .",

    "31 , 1998 ) and the real ( from jan . 1 , 1999 to jun 30 , 2000 )",
    "@xmath0 with respect to the @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 are plotted in fig .",
    "1 . while the @xmath29 exchange rate is not much disturbed by the transition to the real @xmath0 , the other currencies , in particular @xmath5 and @xmath4 and a little bit less @xmath3 have been much sensitive to the transition .    , @xmath30 , @xmath8 and @xmath31    the @xmath6 technique @xcite has been often described and is not recalled here .",
    "it leads to investigating whether the root - mean - square deviations of the fluctuations of the investigated signal @xmath32 has a scaling behavior , e.g. if the function @xmath33 scales with time as    @xmath34}^2 } \\rangle \\sim \\tau^{2\\alpha}\\ ] ]    where @xmath35 is hereby a linear function fitting at best the data in the @xmath36 interval which is considered .",
    "a value @xmath37 corresponds to a signal mimicking a brownian motion .",
    "let it be recalled that in @xcite it has been shown that the time scale invariance for @xmath30 , @xmath38 , and @xmath8 holds from 5 days ( one week ) to about 300 days ( one year ) showing brownian type of correlations .",
    "two different scaling ranges were found for the @xmath29 ; one , from four to 25 days ( 5 weeks ) with a non - brownian @xmath39 , and another , after that for up to 300 days ( 61 weeks ) with brownian - like correlations .",
    "in order to estimate the role of each currency making the @xmath0 and therefore in view of identifying whether some of them mostly influences its behavior , we have first looked at the distribution of exchange rate fluctuations in the interesting time interval defined above . next the time - dependence of the @xmath40 exponent characterizing the scaling law for the exchange rate fluctuation correlations for @xmath0 and that for the 11 currencies that form @xmath0 has been calculated . this evolution has been averaged ( i ) over the currencies , ( ii ) over the time interval considered here .",
    "the results are compared here to the behavior of the fluctuation correlations for @xmath8 and @xmath41 exchange rates .",
    "let it be pointed out that we have also tested elsewhere the @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath5 exchange rates with respect to @xmath0 , @xmath7 and the other @xmath0 forming currencies @xcite .",
    "it is of interest to observe whether the usual statement that the @xmath0 _ is nothing else than a generalized _ @xmath7 holds true . in order to do so",
    "we have first compared the distributions of the exchange rate fluctuations for @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath41 , @xmath44 with the distributions of the fluctuations for @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath8 , @xmath38 ( fig .",
    "2 ) . from such a comparison",
    "we are led to consider that @xmath7 is dominant in defining the distribution of the fluctuations of @xmath0 exchange rate with respect to @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "for all cases the central part of the distributions can be fitted by a gaussian distribution while the tails , i.e. the large fluctuations , follow a power law with a slope equal to @xmath45 2.9 for @xmath30 and @xmath43 , 3.2 for the negative and 4.0 for the positive tail of @xmath8 and @xmath41 , and 3.2 for the negative and about 4.5 for the positive tail in @xmath38 and @xmath44 .",
    "it is fair to recall that the volatility of exchange rates follows different scaling laws depending on the horizon which is considered @xcite .",
    "however the correlation coefficient stabilizes at scales one day and higher @xcite .",
    "those values might be examined whether they result from the equivalent of trading momentum and price resistance just like in the model of @xcite for stock price and price fluctuation distribution . the above asymmetry in the power law for the positive and negative tail might result or not from the limited amount of data .     and @xmath29 , * ( b ) * @xmath43 and @xmath30 , * ( c ) * @xmath41 and @xmath8 , and * ( d ) * @xmath44 and @xmath38 , as compared to the gaussian distribution . _ dashed lines _",
