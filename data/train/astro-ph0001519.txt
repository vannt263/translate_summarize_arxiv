    "nova  aql 1999 no .",
    "2 ( = v1494  aql ) was discovered visually by a. pereira on dec .",
    "1.875 ut , 1999 ( pereira et al . 1999 ) at magnitude m@xmath11=6.0 .",
    "the spectroscopic confirmation was given by subsequent low - resolution observations revealing hydrogen balmer series with p - cyg profiles , mg ii 448.1 nm ( or he i 447.1 nm ) and o i 777.4 nm lines , all with p - cyg profiles .",
    "the very early spectra showed the h@xmath3 absorption component to be blueshifted by about 1020 km  s@xmath12 in respect to the emission peak ( fujii et al .",
    "in contrast to this latter measurement , moro et al .",
    "( 1999 ) reported the absorption component of the h@xmath3 p - cyg profile at a blueshift of @xmath131850 km  s@xmath12 .",
    "additionally , fe ii multiplets at 492 , 502 and 517 nm were observed in emission with p - cyg profile .",
    "further low - resolution spectroscopy was reported by w. liller ( liller et al . 1999 ) , who took a ccd spectrogram with an objective prism , that showed h@xmath3 in emission at a level of 31 percent above the local continuum .",
    "early photometric observations consist of mainly visual estimates carried out by amateur astronomers published partly in a number of iau circulars and partly in observing reports collected by the vsnet group ( http://www.kusastro.kyoto-u.ac.jp/vsnet ) .",
    "thanks to the fast access to the newly obtained magnitudes , the realtime brightness evolution could be followed .",
    "the star reached a maximum brightness of 4.0v shortly after the discovery , which was followed by a rapid decline ( see below ) .",
    "few photoelectric data were published which gave a similar picture to that based on visual estimates .",
    "v1494  aql was also detected at 0.85 and 0.45 mm using scuba on the jcmt ( pontefract et al .",
    "1999 )    v1494  aql is the brightest nova in the northern hemisphere after nova ( v1500 ) cygni 1975  nova ( v1974 ) cygni 1992 was fainter in maximum by about 0.2 mag , warner 1995  , therefore , it provides a good opportunity to carry out thorough studies of a nova explosion by various instruments .",
    "unfortunately , its celestial position disables continuous follow - up observations in early 2000 .",
    "therefore , the spectroscopic evolution , especially the formation of the nebular spectrum is difficult to monitor .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to present spectra of the nova taken about a week , 19 and 28 days after maximum and to discuss the meaning of the observed spectra .",
    "in addition , we also estimate the absolute magnitude and the distance of the nova given by the characteristic light curve parameters ( @xmath14 and @xmath7 ) .",
    "the spectroscopic observations were carried out with the cassegrain - spectrograph attached to the 1.88-m telescope of the david dunlap observatory ( richmond hill , canada ) .",
    "the spectra were obtained on four nights in december , 1999 .",
    "the detector was a thomson 1024 x 1024 ccd chip ( with a 6 e@xmath15 readout noise ) .",
    "a low resolution broad band spectrum was taken on the first night of observations , while we took only medium resolution spectra to study the line profiles in detail on the following three nights .",
    "the gratings , observed spectral regions and the resolution at the central wavelength are summarized in table  1 .",

    "30.96 & 1800 & 64806680 & 11000 +    the spectra were reduced with standard iraf tasks , including bias removal , flat - fielding , aperture extraction ( with the task _ doslit _ ) and wavelength calibration . for the latter ,",
    "two fear spectral lamp exposures were used , which were obtained immediately before and after every stellar exposures .",
    "the integration times varied between 10 seconds and 10 minutes , depending on the actual resolving power and wavelength range .    the obtained low - resolution spectrum is plotted in fig .  1 , where the most characteristic features are also marked . fig .",
    "1 clearly illustrates the typical principal plus diffuse - enhanced spectrum . the prominent balmer series and fe ii multiplets have p - cyg profiles that were already reported by moro et al .",
    "note the fe ii and he i blend at 4500  .",
    "the presence of strong fe ii multiplets suggest that v1494  aql belongs to the `` fe ii '' class of classical novae defined by williams ( 1992 ) . adopting the interpretation of williams ( 1992 ) ,",
    "this means that the line formation happens in a post - outburst wind .",
    "the higher - resolution view of the blue region is presented in fig .  2 , where the hydrogen profiles show interesting substructures in absorption .",
    "this system of narrow absorption components of h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 lines can be seen in fig .  3a .",
    "the symmetric sharp absorption lines are shifted approximately by @xmath10400 and @xmath101000 km  s@xmath12 relative to the central emission near the rest wavelength .",
    "h@xmath17 is shown for comparison , because of the similar complexity .",
    "the evolution of the h@xmath3 profile was followed through 4 weeks after the maximum .",
    "the earlier non - gaussian emission peak changed to a saddle - shaped profile with two maxima at @xmath131050 km  s@xmath12 and + 1200 km  s@xmath12 .",
    "unfortunately , the possible similar narrow absorption lines are strongly affected by the atmospheric telluric lines .",
    "to estimate the light curve parameters , we used visual magnitude estimates by amateur astronomers that were made available by the vsnet group ( this data also includes the observations published in the iau circulars ) . between the discovery on dec . 1 , 1999 and jan . 5 , 2000 ,",
    "almost 420 individual points were collected . as the typical uncertainty of a visual estimate is about @xmath100.3 mag , we have determined a mean light curve by taking 0.1-day bins and calculating the mean value from the individual points .",
    "this led to an averaged light curve containing 117 points , which was further noise - filtered by a simple gaussian smoothing with 0.08 days fwhm .",
    "this approach can only be used when the original light curve is dense enough and therefore , the observational scatter can be properly averaged ( see kiss et al .",
    "1999 illustrating this method ) .",
    "the resulting visual light curve is plotted in fig .  4 , where the maximum , @xmath14 and @xmath7 are also indicated .",
    "the derived parameters are : @xmath18=2451515.9@xmath100.1 days ( 1999 dec 3.4 ut ) , @xmath14=6.6@xmath100.5 days , @xmath7=16@xmath100.5 days .",
    "consequently , v1494  aql is a fast nova and the spectroscopic observations were done 6 , 7 , 19 and 28 days after the maximum .",
    "we note , that the statistical relationship between @xmath14 and @xmath7 ( @xmath19 , warner 1995 ) agrees well with the observed values , as the determined @xmath14 would imply a @xmath7 of 14.5 days .",
    "the most striking post - maximum feature is the additional cyclic brightness change following the fast decline .",
    "the characteristic period of this secondary variation is about 7 days with an approximate semi - amplitude of 0.30.4 mag .",
    "it occured 10 days after the maximum light .",
    "fortunately , the nova was at 7.0 mag ( maximum plus 3 mag ) around the mean level of the cyclic change , therefore , @xmath7 is only weakly affected .",
    "the occurence of the quasi - periodic brightness oscillations indicated the start of the transition phase , when the fast novae often show variations with quasi - periods ranging from 5 days ( gk  per ) to 25 days ( dk  lac , warner 1995 ) , generally with a time - scale being close to @xmath14 . the underlying physical mechanism could be related either to accretion disk phenomena ( leibowitz 1993 ) or to the contracting photosphere of the white dwarf ( bianchini et al .",
    "1992 ) .",
    "[ fig4 ]    three maximum magnitude versus rate of decline ( mmrd ) relations were used to calculate visual absolute magnitude ( della valle & livio 1995 , capaccioli et al .",
    "1989 and schmidt 1957 ) .",
    "they gave @xmath138.84 mag , @xmath138.87 mag and @xmath138.72 mag for m@xmath5 and m@xmath11 , respectively .",
    "another method , involving the absolute magnitude 15 days after maximum ( capaccioli et al . 1989 ) , resulted in m@xmath5(max)=@xmath20 mag ( formal error ) , however , this value has higher uncertainty due to the brightness oscillation in the transition phase .",
    "all of these values suggest an approximate visual absolute magnitude of @xmath21 mag being typical among the fast novae . the distance can be determined from the apparent maximum brightness ( m@xmath11=4.0 mag ) .",
    "neglecting the interstellar reddening , the distance is d=3.6@xmath100.3 kpc .",
    "the absence of strong na i d absorption may suggest that the reddening is low indeed .",
    "the mass of the white dwarf in v1494  aql was estimated using eq .",
    "( 6 ) of livio ( 1992 ) assuming @xmath22 ( i.e. m@xmath23 ) ( warner 1995 ) .",
    "it resulted in m@xmath24=1.1 m@xmath25 , however , this value should be only considered as a rough estimate .",
    "finally , the calculated distance and the apparent brightness of the likely progenitor ( pereira et al .",
    "1999 ) give the pre - outburst visual absolute magnitude of the system .",
    "there is a star in the usno - a2.0 catalogue very close to the position of the nova with red mag 15.6 and blue mag 17.4 .",
    "these values correspond to an approximate visual apparent magnitude 16.5 , that results in m@xmath11=3.7 mag for the progenitor , which is normal for quiescent novae ( ringwald et al .",
    "this result excludes the possibility of a giant secondary component , like in gk  per or rs  oph .",
    "the overall appearence of the low - resolution spectrum covering the whole optical range strongly resembles nova lmc 1988 no.1 ( see fig .  1 in williams 1992 ) being a nova with characteristic `` fe ii '' type spectrum .",
    "also , it is very similar to the spectrum of the fast ( @xmath14=5 days ) nova , nova lmc 1988 no .",
    "2 ( sekiguchi et al . 1989 , williams et al . 1991 ) . sekiguchi et al . (",
    "1989 ) found two distinct sharp absorption systems in the balmer lines resembling our medium - resolution observations of the h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 profiles .",
    "the presence of such complex absorption systems is a common phenomenon in novae ( sekiguchi et al .",
    "1989 ) , which may usually be traced even to h@xmath17h8 in the balmer series .",
    "unfortunately , we have obtained only one spectrum in that spectral region , therefore , we have no information on the time evolution and no firm conclusion can be drawn about the underlying physical reasons .",
    "one would speculatively expect such symmetric ( @xmath10400 and @xmath101000 km  s@xmath12 ) and narrow absorption lines in an axisymmetric wind during the common envelope ( ce ) phase in the outburst , when the ce phase produces a density contrast between the equatorial and polar directions ( livio et al .",
    "this is supported by the observed h@xmath3 profiles , which showed first an emission profile with one main component ( simultaneously with the h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 observations ) and then the split into two main peaks after 19 days .",
    "the saddle - shaped h@xmath3 profile suggest the non - spherical symmetry of the nova shell .",
    "most recently , gill & obrien ( 1999 ) presented an ensemble of calculated emission - line profiles from model nova shells with various symmetries .",
    "the observed shape of the h@xmath3 line corresponds to an equatorial ring seen most probably nearly edge - on .",
    "the difference of the blue and red peaks in the h@xmath3 can be associated with possible small - scale clumpiness in the shell , which produces an increase in brightness in the receding half of the shell ( see gill & obrien 1999 concerning the observed asymmetries in the emission - line profiles of v705  cas ) .    adopting the calculated distance of 3.6 kpc and and expansion velocity of the nova shell of 2000 km  s@xmath12 given by the radial velocity of the absorption component of the p - cyg profiles , eq .",
    "( 5.10 ) in warner ( 1995 ) gives 011 for the angular radius of the shell after 1 year .",
    "this is within range of the hst .",
    "therefore , subsequent spectroscopy and high - resolution imaging may confirm the existence of the hypothetic non - spherical structure .",
    "evidence suggests this to be an equatorial ring .",
