    "the cat ( cherenkov array at thmis ) telescope records cherenkov flashes due to vhe atmospheric showers through its 17.8m@xmath1 mirror .",
    "its camera is located 6 m from the mirror and has a 4.8@xmath2 full field of view , consisting of a central region of 546 0.12@xmath3 angular diameter phototubes arranged in a hexagonal matrix and of 54 surrounding tubes in two `` guard rings '' ( fig.[sample]a ) .",
    "fast electronics allows a relatively low @xmath0-ray detection threshold energy of @xmath4 ( at zenith ) , and the fine grain of the camera permits an accurate image analysis . the experiment and the analysis method",
    "are fully described elsewhere  @xcite . briefly , after selecting the most significant triggers ( total charge @xmath5@xmath630 photo - electrons ) , good discrimination between @xmath0 and hadron - induced showers is achieved by looking at the shape and the orientation of the images ( see the events on fig .",
    "[ sample]a ) : since @xmath0-ray images are rather thin and ellipsoidal while hadronic images are more irregular , a first cut is applied which selects images with a `` @xmath0-like '' shape ; it is based on a @xmath7 fit to a mean light distribution predicted from electromagnetic showers , and a probability @xmath8@xmath60.35 is required .",
    "then , since @xmath0-ray images are expected to point towards the source position in the focal plane whereas cosmic - ray directions are isotropic , a second cut @xmath9@xmath106@xmath3 is used in the case of a point - like source , where the pointing angle @xmath9 is defined as the angle at the image barycentre between the actual source position in the focal plane and that of the image which is reconstructed by the fit  0.1@xmath2 . ] . as a result",
    ", this procedure rejects 99.5% of hadronic events while selecting 40% of @xmath0-ray events .",
    "fig  [ sample]b is an example of the pointing angle distribution obtained on the crab nebula : the signal is clearly seen in the first bins , while a second signal can be seen at @xmath9@xmath11180@xmath2 , due to @xmath0-ray images whose direction has been mis - reconstructed by the fit   corresponds to large hadronic images which were cut by the edge of the camera .",
    "this effect becomes fainter for larger zenith angles , since images form closer to the center of the camera ; see  @xcite for illustration . ] .",
    "mrk  501 exhibited a remarkable series of flares during the whole year 1997  @xcite , which have been very useful for detector calibration .",
    "as an example , fig .",
    "[ mechopt]a illustrates the very good quality of the mechanical monitoring for data taken with a zenith angle between 0@xmath2 and 44@xmath2 : the signal appears right at the actual position of the source , thus validating the angular correction which is applied on each event to compensate for the unavoidable and zenith - dependent slight mis - alignment of the optical axis of the camera  .",
    "+ cosmic - ray muons falling onto the mirror yield ring - like images in which the light distribution can be easily predicted .",
    "the fine grain of the cat camera allows a fine analysis of these images  @xcite . in this way",
    ", the overall conversion factor between adc counts and incident cherenkov photon number can be directly checked .",
    "this factor involves optical efficiencies , as well as phototube pedestals and gains . as an example , fig  [ mechopt]b shows that the camera is correctly calibrated , except for a few channels which are not used in the analysis . in this study , particular attention has been paid to the wavelength - dependent aspect , by taking special runs using different uv - filters placed in front of the camera .",
    "on april 16@xmath12 , 1997 , mrk  501 reached @xmath118 times the level of the crab nebula .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio for this night is 2.7 , corresponding to a @xmath0-ray beam with only 30% contamination .",
    "the good atmospheric quality of this night allows the use of this beam for calibration through comparison with simulations .",
    "[ mcdata]a shows the perfect agreement on the distributions of hillas parameters  @xcite : it is shown for events selected both with the single orientation cut and with the complete selection including the @xmath7 fit .",
    "the distribution of the final number of pixels @xmath13 retained by the fit ( see  @xcite ) is also well reproduced .",
    "furthermore , the good agreement observed on the fourth - brightest - pixel s charge @xmath14 validates the simulations at the trigger level , since the trigger condition requires four pixels above threshold .",
    "finally , fig .",
    "[ mcdata]b shows the @xmath15ndf and @xmath8 distributions   distribution is not flat , as would be expected if the @xmath7 were performed using variables with gaussian errors .",
    "the description of cherenkov light fluctuations in showers development is a very difficult task ( see  @xcite for discussion ) . ] , as well as the previously discussed parameters , expressed as functions of the total image charge @xmath5 : here again the agreement is very good .",
    "this allows the simulation to be used to calculate the @xmath0-ray effective detection area within the selection cuts , as well as the energy - resolution function @xmath16 .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ accres ] .",
    "in particular , a clear positive bias in the energy reconstruction is visible for low values of the injected energy ( fig .",
    "[ accres]b ) : it is due to a trigger effect which selects those events which benefited from a positive fluctuation of cherenkov light during the shower development .",
    "this energy over - estimation disappears when going towards higher energies , where @xmath16 becomes more gaussian , with a zero mean value and a width @xmath17@xmath1120% .",
    "more details concerning calibration and spectrum measurement will be given in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the good stability obtained to date on the signal from the crab nebula ( fig .",
    "[ crabstab ] ) , using the acceptances and energy - resolution function discussed above , illustrates the good quality of running conditions and the good understanding of the detector .",
    "future effort will be devoted to the analysis of large zenith angle data ( see  @xcite for a first study ) and to the cross - calibration with the celeste experiment , operating on the same site with an energy threshold of @xmath11@xmath18 ; the recent observation of the first common events between both detectors  @xcite is an encouraging result in this direction .",
