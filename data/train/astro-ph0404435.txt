    "mounting evidence gathered in recent years indicates that stars may be formed with masses much greater than previously thought possible . the hot luminous `` pistol star '' near our galaxy s center",
    ", for instance , has an estimated mass of @xmath7 @xcite , and the stars r136a1 and r136a2 in the large magellanic cloud each have masses of @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "since the luminosities of such massive stars exceed @xmath9 , relatively small populations of these stars can dominate the power output of their host galaxy during their lifetimes .",
    "furthermore , their deaths may spread chemically - enriched material into the galaxy and leave behind black holes as remnants .",
    "the death events may be responsible for gamma - ray bursts in the `` collapsar '' scenario ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and the relatively large remnant black holes may also explain the so - called `` intermediate - mass '' black holes currently being discovered in nearby galaxies ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "thus , probing the upper limit for stellar mass has an important impact on our understanding of a wide range of astrophysical phenomena , including the chemical evolution of matter in our galaxy and external galaxies , the history of galaxy and structure formation in the universe , the formation of black holes in their dying supernova events , and possibly the origin of gamma - ray bursts via collapsars .",
    "we report here new observations of a luminous star we identify as lbv 1806 - 20 .",
    "this star was first identified as a potential counterpart to the soft gamma - ray repeater sgr 1806 - 20 @xcite , with high near - infrared brightness ( @xmath10 mag ) despite significant absorption from interstellar dust in the galactic plane .",
    "subsequent moderate - resolution ( @xmath11 ) infrared spectroscopy revealed it to be a candidate luminous blue variable ( lbv ) star and one of the most luminous stars in the galaxy , with @xmath12 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this star is known to lie at the brightness peak of the radio nebula g10.0 - 0.3 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . however , the revised inter - planetary network ( ipn ) localization of sgr 1806 - 20 indicated that the sgr was significantly offset from the position of the candidate lbv star and the coincident core of g10.0 - 0.3 @xcite .",
    "recent _ chandra _ and infrared observations confirm that the sgr lies @xmath13 away from the candidate lbv ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , @xcite show that g10.0 - 0.3 is not a supernova remnant at all , but is a radio nebula powered by the tremendous wind of the candidate lbv star at its core .",
    "the apparent conundrum presented by this scenario  why we find two such rare objects so close to each other on the sky without any apparent physical connection  has been resolved by the observations of @xcite who showed that lbv 1806 - 20 is a member of a cluster of massive stars , and of @xcite who showed that sgr 1806 - 20 appears to be a member of the same cluster .",
    "thus , while these two rare objects are not identical , they are related through common cluster membership .",
    "interestingly , @xcite show that one of the other sgrs in the milky way may also be associated with a massive star cluster .",
    "the distance to the candidate lbv , sgr , and their associated cluster has also been a subject of some discussion in the literature .",
    "initial studies of co emission from molecular clouds towards this line of sight and the detection of @xmath14 absorption against the radio continuum indicated an extinction of @xmath15 mag and a best estimate for the distance of @xmath16 kpc @xcite  again confirming its status as one of the most luminous stars known .",
    "however , @xcite present infrared spectra of members of a cluster in the nearby  region g10.2 - 0.3 , which is also part of the ( apparent ) w31 giant molecular cloud complex containing g10.0 - 0.3 , and find an apparently conflicting distance of @xmath17 kpc . this apparent conflict has also been recently resolved by @xcite , who present higher - resolution millimeter and infrared observations of g10.0 - 0.3 and g10.2 - 0.3 .",
    "they find that w31 is actually resolved into at least 2 components along the line - of - sight , with one component at @xmath18 kpc and with extinction @xmath19 mag ( in excellent agreement with the @xcite observations of g10.2 - 0.3 ) and another component at a ( refined ) distance of @xmath20 kpc and with @xmath21 mag .",
    "the radial velocity of lbv 1806 - 20 matches both of these components , but the @xmath22 absorption towards the core of g10.0 - 0.3 ( and thus lbv 1806 - 20 ) due to a cloud at @xmath23 kpc unambiguously places the star in the `` far '' component of w31 .",
    "in addition , both the infrared extinction towards lbv 1806 - 20 ( @xcite ; see also below ) and the x - ray absorption column towards sgr 1806 - 20 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) match the expected extinction towards the `` far '' component of w31 and differ from that of the `` near '' component of @xcite by @xmath24 mag , thus confirming the association of the candidate lbv , sgr , and associated star cluster with the `` far '' component of w31 .    in order to further investigate this intriguing object",
    ", we obtained near - infrared images and spectra of lbv 1806 - 20 and several nearby stars . in section 2 , we describe these observations and their reduction . in section 3 , we describe the analysis of the resulting data , including the spectral types of the candidate lbv and cluster stars , refined analyses of the reddening , confirmation of the distance estimate of @xcite , and the resulting luminosity estimate for lbv 1806 - 20 . in section 4 , we discuss the uncertainties in these measurements and their implications for our understanding of the formation and evolution of extremely massive stars and the birth environment of sgrs .",
    "finally , in section 5 we present our conclusions .",
    "we used the ohio state infrared imaging spectrograph ( osiris ) intrument @xcite and f/14 tip - tilt secondary on the cerro - tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) 4-meter telescope on july 5 - 6 , 2001 to observe lbv 1806 - 20 and nearby stars . in the osiris imaging mode",
    ", we obtained @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27band images with a @xmath28 plate scale . while conditions were non - photometric due to high clouds , the seeing conditions were acceptable when the transparency allowed observations  using the tip - tilt secondary , typical images had full - widths at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath29 . in each band , we obtained a set of 9 images in a @xmath30 raster pattern with a @xmath31 offset between images .",
    "we then subtracted dark frames from each image , divided the result by its own median , and then median - combined the resulting images into a normalized sky frame .",
    "we then subtracted the dark frame and a scaled version of the sky frame from each of the 9 images , and divided the result by a dome flat image .",
    "we shifted each of the 9 frames to a common reference position and added them to give a final summed image in each band .",
    "figure 1 shows a composite 3-color image of the field of lbv 1806 - 20 in the following near - infrared bands : @xmath32 ( blue ) ; @xmath33 ( green ) ; @xmath34 ( red ) .",
    "we also used the osiris high - resolution spectroscopic mode to obtain moderate resolution ( @xmath35 for a 4-pixel slit ) spectra of lbv 1806 - 20 and three nearby stars ( b , c , d in figure 1 ) .",
    "this group of stars , approximately @xmath36 west of lbv 1806 - 20 appears to be a cluster of young , hot , luminous stars in the same molecular cloud as , and including , the candidate lbv star @xcite . at the estimated distance of 15.1 kpc @xcite",
    ", this angular separation corresponds to a physical distance of only @xmath37 pc between the candidate lbv star and the center of the cluster , implying a common origin .",
    "thus , we chose the three brightest stars near the center of the association for spectroscopic observation .",
    "we oriented the osiris slit to obtain spectra simultaneously of lbv 1806 - 20 and star b , and separately to obtain simultaneous spectra of stars c and d. we used the high - resolution slit of osiris ( 4 pixels @xmath38 ) , and took @xmath39s exposures at positions offset along the slit .",
    "after each set of 6 exposures , we obtained a set of 6 spectra of the nearby g dwarf star hr6998 , with approximately the same positions along the slit .",
    "we repeated this approach for 2 different grating settings for each of the k and h bands , and one grating setting for lbv 1806 - 20 in the j - band . for both the science targets and the g - star , we took each spectral frame , subtracted a dark frame from it , divided by its own median , and median - combined the 6 resulting images for a given grating tilt to create a normalized sky frame .",
    "we then subtracted a dark frame and a scaled sky frame from each image and divided by a spectral dome flat .",
    "we extracted spectra separately from each processed image with a gaussian weighting in the spatial direction and tracking the curvature of the spectrum in the dispersion direction .",
    "we then divided each target spectrum by the g - star spectrum with the nearest position on the slit to remove atmospheric absorption bands , after interpolating over the brackett absorption features in the g - star spectrum .",
    "we obtained a wavelength solution separately for each spectrum using the oh lines nearby on the sky ( typical residuals @xmath40 in velocity space ) , and used this to correct each spectrum to a common wavelength scale before averaging the spectra to a single final spectrum . for h and k bands , we averaged the 2 spectra from the different grating tilts where they overlapped .",
    "we multiplied the result by a 5600k blackbody spectrum ( corresponding to the temperature of hr 6998 ) , and de - reddened them for @xmath41 mag ( see below for further discussion on the reddening ) .",
    "we present these spectra in figures 2 - 6 .      due to the non - photometric conditions during the ctio observations",
    ", we were unable to photometrically zeropoint - calibrate the images obtained at that time .",
    "thus , we post - calibrated these images using observations of stars in the field of lbv 1806 - 20 and infrared standard stars on july 27 , 2001 with the hartung - boothroyd observatory 0.65-meter telescope and its infrared array camera @xcite , as well as with photometry from the two - micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ) .",
    "we took 7 images of the field of lbv 1806 - 20 in each band , with offsets of @xmath42 between images .",
    "we then processed the images in each band as described for the ctio data above .",
    "we repeated this procedure on sets of 7 images of the ukirt standard fs26 in each band .",
    "we extracted the flux in @xmath43 from each processed image of fs26 individually , using the average as the best estimate of the flux , and the standard deviation divided by the square root of the number of exposures as the @xmath44 uncertainty .",
    "we then used the known magnitudes of this star to calibrate similarly - derived flux measurements and uncertainties for several bright stars in the field of lbv 1806 - 20 .",
    "differential photometry between these stars and the target stars provided the final photometric measurements .",
    "we used a photometric airmass solution derived from measurements of a star observed for another program over a range of airmasses throughout the same night .",
    "we then verified this photometry with the 2mass photometry for j and h band ( omitting k , as 2mass uses the @xmath45 filter ) .",
    "we present the resulting photometry for the bright stars of figure 1 in table 1 .",
    "we obtained high angular - resolution speckle imaging of lbv 1806 - 20 in june 1999 using the palomar 5-meter telescope .",
    "we used the facility near - infrared camera d78 with reimaging fore - optics providing a pixel scale of @xmath46 per pixel to obtain k - band images of the star with 0.125s exposures , effectively freezing the effects of image motion due to atmospheric turbulence .",
    "we observed lbv 1806 - 20 in 6 sets of 50s on - target integrations , interleaved with observations of 2 nearby stars with similar near - infrared brightnesses taken in an identical manner .",
    "we used a `` shift - and - add '' technique to combine images of the individual stars  for each star ( lbv 1806 - 20 and the 2 comparison stars ) we shifted the images to align the brightest speckle in each frame with other frames and added the results .",
    "we used these nearby stars to create the model point spread function ( psf ) , which were seen to have fwhm of @xmath47  near the telescope s diffraction limit of @xmath48 at this wavelength .",
    "we then scaled the amplitude of this model psf and subtracted it from the shifted - and - added image of lbv 1806 - 20 .",
    "we also used fourier filtering to remove a periodic diagonal pattern due to clocking noise in the camera electronics .",
    "figure 7 shows an image of lbv 1806 - 20 and the resulting psf - subtracted image . while the residuals in the subtracted image are statistically significant , they may be due to systematic effects , such as sub - pixel errors in image registration or secular small - scale variations in the speckle psf , possibly due to low - level instability in the time - averaged properties of the speckle halo . for comparison ,",
    "we also show simulated psf - subtracted images of a theoretical extended source with a very small size ( @xmath49 fwhm ) . to simulate this source",
    ", we took the comparison star psf and convolved it with a 2-d gaussian profile with a width corresponding to the extended source intrinsic width .",
    "we then added noise corresponding to the photon noise in the lbv 1806 - 20 image to the resulting simulated image , and then subtracted a scaled version of the single - star psf as above .",
    "note that the resulting simulations have residuals much greater than those for the actual psf - subtracted image .",
    "based on the spectra in figures 2 - 4 , we present measured equivalent widths for emission and absorption lines from lbv 1806 - 20 in table 2 .",
    "the line features evident in the k - band spectrum of lbv 1806 - 20 ( hi , hei , feii , mgii , nai ) are very similar to those observed in lbv stars such as ag car @xcite , the pistol star in the quintuplet @xcite , and the lbv candidate star 362 also in the quintuplet @xcite ( and at lower resolution from this same star in 1994 @xcite ) .",
    "the equivalent widths of the feii , mgii , and nai features are very close also , though the hi and hei lines are generally stronger in lbv 1806 - 20 .",
    "p cygni also displays a similar k - band spectrum @xcite , although with an apparent absence of nai emission . in the h - band ,",
    "lbv 1806 - 20 seems like a cross between p cygni and the pistol star , with 10 strong brackett series lines and 9 feii emission lines . while the pistol star and ag car exhibit similar iron features , their brackett series lines are much weaker than seen in lbv 1806 - 20 .",
    "p cygni , on the other hand , shows strong brackett series with weaker feii .",
    "thus , while the spectrum of lbv 1806 - 20 does not uniquely match any particular lbv , its properties are well within the range exhibited by these stars .",
    "thus , we conclude that based on its spectrum lbv 1806 - 20 is in fact a luminous blue variable candidate , in confirmation of @xcite .",
    "the hei @xmath50 m absorption line provides important information on the temperature of lbv 1806 - 20 . in 1994 , the equivalent width of this line was @xmath51 @xcite , consistent with spectral classes o9-b2 of supergiant stars @xcite , indicating a surface temperature of 18000 k to 32000 k.m absorption feature , indicating that this approximate relationship seems to continue to hold for candidate lbv stars . ]",
    "the large range in temperature is due to the large scatter in this relationship @xcite . by the time of the july 2001 observations ,",
    "the equivalent width of the line had dropped to @xmath52 .",
    "changes in the spectral type to hotter ( o6.5-o8.5 ) surface temperature would produce such a reduction in the hei absorption line equivalent width @xcite . moreover , at the same time , we see a factor of @xmath53 increase in the equivalent width of emission lines such as @xmath54 and hei @xmath55 m , which could reflect an increase in the number of ionizing photons produced by the star as it moved to higher temperatures .",
    "however , such a temperature change might also imply a significant brightening in the k - band ( given a constant photospheric radius ) , contrary to the observations .",
    "in fact , our k - band photometry for lbv 1806 - 20 is marginally fainter than that of @xcite ( @xmath10 mag , with no quoted uncertainty )",
    ". we can find an alternate solution which keeps the k - band brightness constant while decreasing the hei absorption and increasing the number of ionizing photons , by assuming that the photospheric radius decreases significantly as temperature increases .",
    "simple calculations for a blackbody spectrum show that a change of temperature from 20,000k to 26,000k ( roughly b1.5 to b0 ) accompanied by a @xmath56 decrease in photospheric radius could produce the observed behavior .",
    "such anti - correlated variations in temperature and radius are characteristic of some lbv stars ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "alternately , the stronger lines might indicate an increase in the stellar wind density absorbing more ultraviolet continuum photons and converting them into increased line emission .",
    "however , without detailed models of the atmosphere of lbv 1806 - 20 , we can only conclude that it has a spectral type between o9 and b2 .      from the color of star b in figure 1",
    ", we can immediately see that it differs significantly from the other stars in the field due to its extreme redness ( @xmath57 mag versus @xmath58 mag for other stars ) .",
    "in addition , the emission line spectrum ( figure 5 ) differs significantly from lbv 1806 - 20 , showing relatively weak @xmath59 and strong blended emission from hei , heii , ciii , civ , niii , and niv .",
    "this k - band spectrum is typical for late - type wolf - rayet stars of the wc subclass , and comparison of the equivalent widths of these lines with other similar stars @xcite gives a classification of wc9 .",
    "the long wavelength excess in the continuum indicates the presence of warm dust with a thermal continuum extending into the near - infrared  another common feature in wcl ( late - type wc ) stars , and also explaining the very red colors of this object .",
    "we should note that only 26 such wcld ( dust emission ) stars are known at this time @xcite , making this a rather rare star .",
    "the next brightest stars in the cluster center , c and d , have similar colors to lbv 1806 - 20 , with @xmath60 mag and @xmath61 mag , respectively . in their k - band spectra ,",
    "both stars show @xmath59 and hei @xmath50 m absorption features .",
    "they also seem to show some sort of feature at the hei @xmath55 m line . this could either be due to a self - absorbed ( nascent p - cygni ) line , or else due to poor subtraction of a nearby strong oh sky line . based on their strong hei @xmath50 m absorption lines ,",
    "both of these stars would seem to have spectral classes in the range from b0 to b3 supergiants @xcite .",
    "however , in both of these absorption lines , as well as the stronger of the brackett series lines in the h - band spectra for these stars , we see some evidence for absorption wings ( figure 6 )",
    ". fits to these lines give velocity widths of @xmath62 fwhm ( after subtraction of the instrumental line widths ) , although some of these lines are potentially blended ( particularly br@xmath63 with nearby he lines ) .",
    "such broad absorption wings are typical of the luminous blue hypergiants ( luminosity class ia+ ) , and may indicate the presence of a mass - losing wind @xcite .",
    "thus , we conclude ( for the time being ) that stars c and d are b0-b3 supergiant or hypergiant stars .",
    "the colors of lbv 1806 - 20 and its spectral continuum shape allow us to estimate the extinction towards lbv 1806 - 20 .",
    "for such a hot star ( as indicated by the hei @xmath50 m absorption feature ) , the intrinsic @xmath64 color is nearly neutral , and the observed red color of @xmath65 mag corresponds to an extinction of @xmath66 mag ( assuming the rieke - lebofsky reddening law @xcite ) , matching the estimates based on co observations @xcite .",
    "( while a hypothetical infrared excess from lbv 1806 - 20 would alter these conclusions , as we discuss below there is good reason to believe this is not present ) .",
    "furthermore , the fact that stars c and d in the nearby cluster have very similar @xmath64 colors ( as can also be seen for many other cluster stars colors in figure 1 ) indicates that the stellar cluster is indeed at the same reddening and thus distance along the line of sight as lbv 1806 - 20 , confirming the physical association between them ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the h and k bands are in the rayleigh - jeans portion of the blackbody emission curve for such a hot star ( the reason for the neutral colors noted above ) .",
    "thus , we can estimate the extinction towards lbv 1806 - 20 by de - reddening the spectra until the continuum shape matches a rayleigh - jeans distribution . in this way",
    ", we obtain estimates of @xmath67 mag from the h - band continuum and @xmath66 mag from the k - band continuum , with uncertainties dominated by @xmath68 uncertainty in the spectrograph response shape over a given order .    for the @xmath64 measurement above , adoption of the cardelli reddening law",
    "@xcite gives a very small change in @xmath69 ( @xmath70 mag ) , and the k - band spectral continuum shape is similar unaffected ( change of @xmath71 mag ) . in the h - band ,",
    "the cardelli law differs from rieke - lebofsky more significantly , causing a difference of @xmath72 mag . taking this into account",
    ", we increase our uncertainty in that measurement to @xmath73 mag . combining all three",
    ", we adopt a final estimate for the extinction of @xmath74 mag towards lbv 1806 - 20 .",
    "the distance to lbv 1806 - 20 is a major subject of @xcite and @xcite , and we refer the reader to those papers for detailed discussion . in summary , @xcite and @xcite use co spectroscopy to identify molecular clouds along the line - of - sight towards lbv 1806 - 20 , and use the cloud velocities to determine kinematic distances to them .",
    "the spectra of lbv 1806 - 20 presented here provide important insights into the distance of the star . from the emission lines",
    ", we can measure a radial velocity of lbv 1806 - 20 .",
    "we selected the @xmath75 line as a velocity fiducial , as it is the strongest line detection in the spectrum , and appears to be relatively free from contamination due to blending with other strong lines .",
    "we fit a gaussian profile to this line , finding no significant residuals , and a centroid shifted from the atmospheric rest frame by @xmath76 , where residuals in the spectral wavelength solution from atmospheric oh emission lines dominate the largely systematic uncertainty . after correcting for the earth s barycentric motion and the solar system barycenter motion relative to the local standard of rest , we determine a radial velocity for lbv 1806 - 20 of @xmath77 .",
    "cross - checks of this velocity determination with several other strong unblended lines give consistent results for the velocity of lbv 1806 - 20 .",
    "this velocity is important , as massive stars such as lbvs are a kinematically `` cold '' population , and do not generally deviate significantly in velocity from their parent molecular clouds .",
    "combined with the co velocity maps of @xcite and @xcite , this velocity then confirms the association of lbv 1806 - 20 with molecular clouds in w31 at kinematic distances of either @xmath78 kpc or @xmath24 kpc , based on the galactic rotation curve @xcite and with the ambiguity being due to the near / far degeneracy of kinematic distances .",
    "@xcite also present an @xmath22 absorption spectrum which uses the radio emission from lbv 1806 - 20 as the background source , revealing strong absorption from a molecular cloud whose velocity ( in both @xmath22 absorption and @xmath79 emission ) places it at a near distance of @xmath80 kpc , setting this as the lower limit to the distance of lbv 1806 - 20 .",
    "this observation eliminates the `` near '' distance as a possibility for lbv 1806 - 20 , leaving only the `` far '' distance of @xmath81 kpc . as a `` sanity check '' ,",
    "@xcite go on to show that the observed reddening towards lbv 1806 - 20 combined with @xmath79 observations of clouds along the line of sight is consistent with the `` far '' distance and is inconsistent with the `` near '' distance .",
    "based on these results , we adopt the distance determination of @xcite of @xmath81 kpc .",
    "we note that an independent distance estimate for star b ( below ) matches this estimate and is also strongly inconsistent with the `` near '' distance noted above .",
    "we discuss this issue further in section 4.1.3 .      combining the above measurements , we then arrive at luminosity estimates for lbv 1806 - 20 .",
    "taking its brightness of @xmath82 mag and applying an extinction correction of @xmath83 mag ( corresponding to @xmath74 mag and @xmath84 @xcite ) and a distance modulus of @xmath85 mag ( from @xmath81 kpc ) , we arrive at an absolute k magnitude of @xmath86 mag .",
    "the absolute visual magnitude and bolometric luminosity of lbv 1806 - 20 from this number are functions of the star s spectral class , and also may be affected by free - free contributions to the k - band emission of lbv 1806 - 20 .",
    "as discussed below , we do not believe that this contribution is large for lbv 1806 - 20 ( it is @xmath87 mag for the pistol star as well ) , and we include it as an additional @xmath88 mag uncertainty in the lower bound for the absolute k - band magnitude , which we now adopt to be @xmath89 mag . for a spectral class of o9 , the upper end of the range , we have @xmath90 mag to give an absolute visual magnitude of @xmath91 mag .",
    "the bolometric correction is @xmath92 mag , giving a bolometric magnitude of @xmath93 mag , or a luminosity of @xmath94 . at the low end of the temperature range ( b2 spectral type ) , the corresponding values are @xmath95 mag , @xmath96 mag , or a luminosity of @xmath97 .",
    "we have plotted these temperature / luminosity values in figure 8 , along with the corresponding locations of other known extremely luminous stars . note that even for the lower end of the possible temperature range for lbv 1806 - 20 , it has a luminosity equal to or greater than that of the famous lbv eta carina @xcite and the pistol star @xcite .",
    "thus , it seems that lbv 1806 - 20 may ( marginally ) be the most luminous star currently known .      given the photometry , distance estimate , and reddening above , we can also arrive at an abolute magnitude for star b. if we assume that the reddening toward star b is identical to that for lbv 1806 - 20 and a distance of 15.1 kpc , the absolute k - band magnitude for this star is @xmath98 mag .",
    "note that this is in excellent agreement with the range of absolute magnitudes for wc9 stars in the galactic center ( @xmath99 to @xmath100 mag ",
    "furthermore , the observed @xmath101 colors of star b are consistent with the assumed reddening if the intrinsic colors are @xmath102 mag , also in excellent agreement with the observed range of instrinsic colors of other wc9 stars ( @xmath103 to @xmath104 mag @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the spectral classification and photometry of star b confirm the distance and reddening estimates used for the luminosity of lbv 1806 - 20 above .    taking a slightly different approach",
    ", we can use the observed range of intrinsic colors and absolute magnitudes for wc9 stars to constrain the distance to star b and provide a completely independent cross - check on the distance to the cluster of stars including lbv 1806 - 20 .",
    "the intrinsic color range of @xcite combined with the observed @xmath105 mag and the rieke - lebofsky reddening law gives a range of @xmath106 mag . combining this with the observed range of @xmath107 @xcite for galactic center wc9 stars and the observed @xmath108 mag gives a range for the distance modulus to star b of @xmath109 mag ( low - luminosity , intrinsically - blue , high - reddening ) to @xmath110 mag ( high - luminosity , intrinsically - red , low - reddening ) .",
    "thus , a lower limit on the distance of star b is @xmath111 kpc , assuming it is no fainter than the intrinsically - faintest known wc9 star in the galactic center ( an assumption confirmed by the recent discovery of another , even fainter wc9 star in this same cluster @xcite ) .",
    "note that at an alternate assumed distance of @xmath78 kpc ( consistent with the g10.2 - 0.3 cluster of @xcite ) , star b would be 6 times less luminous than any other known wc9 star , which seems very unlikely ( especially given the even fainter wc9 of @xcite ) .",
    "thus , this provides yet another independent confirmation that these stars lie in the `` far '' component of w31 at @xmath81 kpc , as opposed to the `` near '' component observed by @xcite .",
    "the same analyses applied to lbv 1806 - 20 can also provide luminosity estimates for stars c and d. based on their strong hei @xmath50 m absorption lines , both of these stars have spectral classes in the range from b0 to b3 @xcite .",
    "following the analyses for lbv 1806 - 20 ( above ) , at the distance of 15.1 kpc , for a b1 spectral class , they would have bolometric luminosities of @xmath112 and @xmath113 , respectively .",
    "these luminosities are too high for `` normal '' supergiant stars of this spectral type",
    ". however , these luminosities are similar to those observed in early - b hypergiants ( luminosity class ia+ ) @xcite ( see figure 8) .",
    "furthermore , hypergiants are distinguished from `` normal '' supergiants by the presence of broad absorption lines indicative of mass - loss through a wind  much as we see in the @xmath62 linewidths of the brackett and hei absorption features in stars c and d ( though , as noted above , line blending may have a non - neglible effect for these lines at this resolution ) .",
    "therefore , the luminosity and spectral features of star c and d appear to support their identification as class ia+ blue supergiants at the same distance and reddening as lbv 1806 - 20 .",
    "furthermore , if we take the same reddening and distance used for lbv 1806 - 20 , we derive absolute magnitudes of @xmath114 mag and @xmath115 mag , respectively for stars c and d , without reference to ( potentially uncertain ) bolometric correction .",
    "we note that there are several luminous stars in the galactic center with similar effective temperatures ( i.e. stars irs 16sw and irs 16ne ",
    "@xcite ) and absolute magnitudes of @xmath116 to @xmath117 mag , in excellent agreement with stars c and d. while the irs 16 stars are emission - line objects , and stars c and d are absorption line objects , we can at least see that the absolute magnitudes of the brightest b - type stars in this cluster are consistent with the brightest b - type stars in the galactic center .",
    "this supports at least the _ consistency _ of the distance and reddening estimates used for lbv 1806 - 20 .",
    "finally , we note that in a cluster such as this , it seems quite likely that some of the brightest stars are in fact binaries , given the large fraction of binarity in high - mass stars .",
    "thus , by selecting the brightest stars in this cluster for spectroscopy , we may be biasing ourselves towards binary stars with apparent luminosity excess ( see below for a more detailed discussion of multiplicity in lbv 1806 - 20 ) .",
    "one issue for the above luminosity estimate is that lbv 1806 - 20 might exhibit a near - infrared excess of continuum emission due to warm circumstellar dust ( as star b ) , free - free emission in the lbv wind , or other processes .",
    "such an ir excess would interfere with our luminosity estimate in several ways .",
    "first , it would artificially enhance the k - band brightness of the star , and thus directly cause us to over - estimate the luminosity of lbv 1806 - 20 .",
    "second , it would artifically decrease the apparent equivalent width of the hei @xmath118 m absorption feature , causing us to mis - estimate the star s temperature and thus its bolometric correction . finally , it would redden the colors and spectral continuum shape of candidate lbv 1806 - 20 , causing us to over - estimate the reddening correction for the star .",
    "thus , we see that the hypothetical presence of such an excess could significantly alter our luminosity estimate",
    ".    however , careful inspection of the observational results gives no evidence for such an excess , and provides several indications against its existence .",
    "first of all , as we noted above and as can be seen in figure 1 , there are several stars near lbv 1806 - 20 with very similar @xmath119 colors .",
    "if lbv 1806 - 20 has a significant near - ir excess , then we must also postulate that the majority of the bright stars in / near the cluster also have significant ( and virtually identical ! ) excesses .",
    "this is extremely unlikely , if not positively unphysical .",
    "second , the spectral continuum shape in _ both _ the h and k bands is consistent with a reddened rayleigh - jeans distribution for lbv 1806 - 20 ( as well as stars c and d ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the spectral continuum shape in star b clearly reveals its near - ir excess ( likely due to warm dust ) .",
    "therefore , for an excess to be present in lbv 1806 - 20 , it must extend smoothly over at least the entire h and k bands , thereby significantly altering the observed colors of the star .",
    "this conflicts with the observed color match with other cluster stars noted above .",
    "we also note that the lbv stars which most closely resemble lbv 1806 - 20 in their emission line spectra  ag car and the pistol star  do not show large free - free emission contributions in this wavelength range .",
    "the free - free contribution of the pistol star in the k - band is negligible for models of the spectral energy distribution @xcite and estimated to be @xmath87 mag ( d. figer , private communication ) , while in ag car the inferred k - band contribution is @xmath120 mag @xcite .",
    "while ag car _ does _ exhibit mid - ir excess emission , it does not contribute significantly at wavelengths @xmath121 m .",
    "finally , we note that the supposed dilution of the hei absorption feature by a large ( e.g. @xmath122 % ) near - ir excess would imply an intrinsic equivalent width @xmath123 ( for an ir excess equal to the blackbody continuum in k - band ) . however , the temperature range we infer for lbv 1806 - 20 is near the maximum strength of this line .",
    "in fact , _ none _ of the stars in the census of @xcite have equivalent widths @xmath124 .",
    "thus , the presence of significant dilution of this line by an ir excess would make its spectrum inconsistent with any known type of star .    for all of these reasons",
    ", we conclude that lbv 1806 - 20 does not exhibit any _ significant _ near - ir excess emission over that expected for a reddened blackbody . by `` not significant '' , we mean here that the contribution of any ir excess is not large compared to the other uncertainties in our measurement of the star s luminosity ( @xmath125 mag ) .",
    "however , as noted in section 3.4 , we have added an additional @xmath88 mag of uncertainty to the lower bound for lbv 1806 - 20 , based on a possible expectation of this level of free - free emission as observed in the similar pistol star .",
    "the issue of the precise temperature for lbv 1806 - 20 is a difficult one . at a crude level ,",
    "the spectral continuum shape in h and k bands gives us a firm lower limit of @xmath126 , below which we would see spectral curvature away from a rayleigh - jeans law , contrary to the observations .",
    "however , our primary indicator for the temperature of the star is its hei @xmath50 m absorption feature .",
    "the simple presence of this line also indicates an effective temperature greater than @xmath127 @xcite . assuming the relation found between temperature and equivalent width for supergiant stars gives the temperature range from @xmath128 to @xmath129 , as noted above .",
    "the case of the pistol star seems to confirm that this relationship extends to some candidate lbv stars also @xcite .",
    "the variability of this line in lbv 1806 - 20 unfortunately complicates the matter .",
    "as noted above , a change in the stellar temperature to either greater or smaller values , could produce the observed reduction in equivalent width .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that lbvs have essentially constant bolometric luminosities , and that their apparent brightness variations are due to anti - correlated radius / temperature variations induced by their near - eddington radiative instability .",
    "thus , a star can experience an increase in temperature with a simultaneous decrease in radius , keeping the bolometric luminosity constant but significantly altering its apparent brightness at wavelengths near the peak of the blackbody spectrum .",
    "the observed decrease in the hei line from lbv 1806 - 20 could represent such a temperature / radius change .",
    "the timescale of this change  several years  is in keeping with the observed timescales for similar changes in other candidate lbv stars . assuming constant bolometric luminosity with an increase in temperature",
    ", observations in the rayleigh - jeans tail of the emission spectrum should follow a dependence @xmath130 .",
    "thus , the possible drop by @xmath131 mag between the observations of @xcite and our observations here could indicate a temperature increase in lbv 1806 - 20 by @xmath132% , with a corresponding decrease in hei equivalent width . also note that if the hei decrement were due to a temperature _ decrease _ to @xmath133 ( and corresponding radius _ increase _ ) , we would expect an apparent k - band _ brightening _ in lbv 1806 - 20 by @xmath134 mag , which is ruled out by the observations .    in any case",
    ", we note that our temperature estimate is based on the higher equivalent width of hei ( lower temperature ) , and thus provides us with a lower estimate on the bolometric luminosity .",
    "furthermore , the temperature changes hinted at by the hei variability and possible associated photometric variability described above are well within the range of our stated uncertainties in temperature .",
    "finally , we note that a more precise determination of the temperature ( and thus luminosity ) of lbv 1806 - 20 may be possible in the future , using detailed models for the stellar spectrum as developed by @xcite for the pistol star .      as noted above , the distance to this cluster is the primary subject of @xcite and @xcite , and those papers provide detailed discussion .",
    "however , two new points are worth emphasizing here .",
    "first of all , the radial velocity of lbv 1806 - 20 confirms its association with the molecular clouds at @xmath78 kpc or @xmath135 kpc .",
    "it is important to note that intermediate distances are essentially ruled out , as they would require peculiar velocities of lbv 1806 - 20 as large as @xmath136 , which is much larger than the typical velocity dispersions for such massive stars .",
    "secondly , the spectral types for stars b , c , and d are all consistent with their absolute k - band magnitudes if they ( and thus lbv 1806 - 20 ) are all located at the distance of @xmath135 kpc given by @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the observed magnitude of star b combined with the known range of absolute magnitudes for wc9 stars strongly rules out the `` near '' distance for this cluster of stars , and independently sets a minimum distance of at least 9.5 kpc .",
    "thus , these stars provide independent confirmation of the original distance arguments of @xcite and @xcite , resulting in a total of three independent lines of evidence ( kinematic distance plus @xmath22 absorption , absolute magnitude range of star b , ir extinction ) that show lbv 1806 - 20 lies at the `` far '' distance of @xmath135 ..    for the sake of completeness , we also consider the luminosity of star a using distance estimates that exclude the kinematic distance measurement discussed above and in @xcite . that leaves two major distance indicators",
    " the ammonia absorption feature , which places lbv 1806 - 20 at a distance of at least @xmath137 kpc , and the absolute k - band magnitude of star b , which places the cluster at @xmath138 kpc .",
    "note that these two indicators are consistent with each other , as they are lower limits , and both confirm that lbv 1806 - 20 does not lie at the `` near '' kinematic distance of @xmath78 kpc . taking @xmath139 kpc as a lower limit on the distance to the cluster",
    ", we can place lower limits on the luminosity of lbv 1806 - 20 .",
    "for a temperature at the minimum of our range above , we have for the lower limit @xmath140 . at the upper end of our temperature range above , the lower limit becomes @xmath141 .",
    "we note again that these estimates ignore the kinematic information on lbv 1806 - 20 , which places it at @xmath24 kpc .",
    "if lbv 1806 - 20 were in fact to lie at @xmath132 kpc , it would have a velocity deviation of several tens of kilometers per second from the galactic rotation curve .",
    "we also note that @xcite have identified another wc9 star in this cluster which is @xmath37 mag fainter than star b , which would increase the `` non - kinematic '' distance lower limit to @xmath142 kpc , which is close to the lower end of the confidence interval for the kinematic distance estimate of @xcite .",
    "we also note here that there is strong reason to believe that all of these stars ( the candidate lbv , stars b , c , d , and the soft gamma repeater sgr 1806 - 20 ) are in fact members of the same cluster . the great rarity of lbv candidates and sgrs in the galaxy make a chance association of two so close together very small ( @xmath143 probability @xcite ) . this probability is decreased even further by the fact that the measured ir extinction towards the lbv candidate matches the x - ray absorption towards the sgr @xcite .",
    "the additional discovery of a very rare wc9d star ( star b ) and two ob stars ( c and d ) , all with identical reddening , seems to further show strong evidence for the existence of a physical association of these massive stars and their remnants .",
    "additional support comes from the mid - infrared observations of @xcite , which shows that all of these stars lie within an extended envelope of mid - ir emission , presumably due to hot dust in their natal molecular cloud .",
    "the work of @xcite reveals an additional 2 wolf - rayet stars ( one wc9 and one wn5 ) , as well as multiple other ob stars in this region increases the over - density of massive stars here , which would seem to cement the conclusion that this is in fact a physical association of massive stars at the same distance .",
    "in fact , the surface density of very massive stars here is within a factor of a few of the most dense concentrations seen in our galaxy , such as the arches cluster @xcite .",
    "finally , if we exclude both the kinematic arguments above _ and _ the absolute magnitude of star b , the ammonia absorption feature places another lower limit on the distance to the candidate lbv 1806 - 20 of @xmath4 kpc @xcite .",
    "this results in a luminosity lower limit of @xmath5 .",
    "note again that this distance is problematic when considering the measured velocity of the molecular cloud and the candidate lbv , requiring them to have peculiar velocities of @xmath144 compared to the expected galactic rotation curve at this location  an extreme deviation considering that such massive stars are generally a `` cold '' population in kinematic terms .",
    "furthermore , at this distance , star b would be approximately 4 times less luminous than any wc9 star seen in the galactic center ( and the wc9 of @xcite would be @xmath145 times less luminous than any of the galactic center wc9 stars ) .",
    "thus , this distance seems incompatible with several observational facts .",
    "nevertheless , we include this distance estimate here for completeness .",
    "perhaps the strongest caveat to ( at least the lower limit for ) the luminosity of lbv 1806 - 20 is the issue of the star s possible multiplicity .",
    "a proposed explanation for the observed luminosities of objects such as the pistol star and lbv 1806 - 20 is that they are in fact unresolved _ clusters _ of luminous stars .",
    "however , our speckle observations contradict this conclusion in the case of lbv 1806 - 20 . for a distance of 15.1 kpc ,",
    "the upper limit of 60-mas on any extension corresponds to 0.0044 pc or @xmath146 au fwhm .",
    "this is more than an order of magnitude smaller than any known cluster .",
    "thus , it is very unlikely that lbv 1806 - 20 is an unresolved cluster of stars .    on the other hand , ob",
    "stars in open clusters are often ( @xmath147 fraction ) in binaries , implying that lbv 1806 - 20 may also be a binary system .",
    "our current observations do not strictly rule out a close binary ( or even triple system ) as an explanation for lbv 1806 - 20 . for a circular orbit with a @xmath148 au semi - major axis and a total binary mass of @xmath149 ( see below ) , even seen edge - on , we derive differential orbital velocities for similar - mass components of @xmath150  well below the observed line widths .",
    "thus , it seems quite possible that lbv 1806 - 20 is a binary / multiple system .",
    "however , we note that even at our lower luminosity range , for equal components , each star would be approximately as luminous as @xmath151 car . for mass ratios different from one ,",
    "the more massive component would increase in luminosity from this level .",
    "so , even if lbv 1806 - 20 is in fact a binary / multiple system , we are still left with extremely luminous ( and massive ) stars composing the system .",
    "finally , the observed emission line variability and depth of the hei @xmath50 m feature also present some possible evidence against multiplicity in lbv 1806 - 20 .",
    "the emission lines vary by factors of several , as shown above , implying that one object is probably the dominant source of radiation in the system . on the other hand , in an ultra - luminous binary ( such as lbv 1806 - 20",
    "would have to be ) , wind - wind collisions may be a significant source of line emission , and thus explain the large - amplitude variability in this context .",
    "the observed depth of the hei absorption line is less easy to explain away .",
    "the depth of this line is such that either one component has a weaker feature and the other star has the deepest such absorption feature known ( to compensate ) , or both stars have nearly - equally deep absorption features .",
    "while this latter seems somewhat unlikely , it is still possible .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the issue of multiplicity in lbv 1806 - 20 remains an open question .",
    "if we assume that lbv 1806 - 20 is in fact a single star , its luminosity provides a current mass estimate , assuming that the star radiates at its eddington luminosity where radiation pressure at the surface matches the star s gravity . at the lower end of the luminosity range for the best distance estimate ( @xmath152 kpc ) ,",
    "we derive a minimum present - day mass of @xmath153 , assuming @xmath154 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the eddington limit is a lower limit to the mass  realistic models of massive stars typically have @xmath155 ( i.e. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus a realistic lower limit on the mass of lbv 1806 - 20 in the same context as similar estimates for other massive stars is @xmath156 .",
    "( for completeness , at the alternative distance lower limits , this mass limit becomes @xmath157 ( @xmath158 kpc , ignoring kinematic measurements ) and @xmath159 ( @xmath160 kpc , ignoring the absolute magnitudes of the wc9 stars ) ) .",
    "the following discussion assumes the mass to be @xmath161 .    on the other hand ,",
    "lbv 1806 - 20 may be a relatively tight binary , with a projected semi - major axis @xmath162 au ( based on our speckle imaging above ) .",
    "if so , then the most even distribution of luminosity ( which deviates most from the single star arguments above ) has each star at @xmath163 .",
    "following the same arguments above based on eddington luminosities , then each binary component has a present - day mass @xmath164 .",
    "it is not currently clear whether this scenario is physically plausible .",
    "for instance , if during formation one of the stars ignited slightly before the other , the radiation pressure from such a luminous object so nearby might photoevaporate the second binary component .",
    "( however , as argued below , shock - induced star formation may invalidate this argument to some extent ) . in any case",
    ", our reliance on the eddington luminosity for mass estimation indicates that for @xmath165 , the total system mass should be @xmath166 .      the star that most closely resembles lbv 1806 - 20 in spectral characteristics ( see discussion above ) and",
    "luminosity is the pistol star @xcite .",
    "this is particularly important in that segments of the astronomical community have been slow to accept the luminosity estimates for the pistol star , and various appeals to exceptional circumstances in the pistol star s unique properties and location ( very close to the galactic center ) are often made .",
    "however , the close match in spectral characteristics and luminosity between these two stars demonstrates that the pistol star is not unique in its properties . furthermore ,",
    "lbv 1806 - 20 is located at a galactocentric radius of @xmath167 kpc  nearly out to the solar circle , and certainly very far removed from the galactic center itself .",
    "this shows conclusively that the formation of very massive stars is an ongoing process in our galaxy in the current epoch , and furthermore that this process is not limited to the extreme environement of the galactic center .",
    "we also note that the similarity between the spectra of lbv 1806 - 20 and the pistol star may indicate that lbv 1806 - 20 lies at the lower end of the allowed luminosity range in figure 8 .",
    "however , verification of this possibility requires higher resolution spectra and detailed modeling of the stellar atmosphere , which should be carried out as future work .",
    "due in large part to the apparent connection between supernovae and @xmath63-ray bursts ( i.e. @xcite ; @xcite ) , there has been considerable progress in recent years concerning the end - state evolution of very massive stars . @xcite",
    "present final evolutionary scenarios for a wide range of stellar masses and metallicity .",
    "if we assume that lbv 1806 - 20 had an initial mass of @xmath168 and has near - solar metallicity , @xcite show that the star will end its days as a snib / c explosion producing a neutron star .",
    "this result is contrary to the previous `` standard '' assumption that all very massive stars produce black holes ( or disintegrate in pair - instability supernovae ) , and depends on heavy mass - loss due to tremendous stellar winds to strip the stellar core bare and diminish the final core mass .",
    "note that @xcite infer the presence of just such a strong wind from lbv 1806 - 20 from the radio emission of g10.0 - 0.3 .",
    "this result could also extend to the progenitor of sgr 1806 - 20  if it was only slightly more massive than lbv 1806 - 20 it could in fact evolve more rapidly , explode , and yet leave behind a neutron star remnant .",
    "the fact that sgr 1806 - 20 is not an ordinary neutron star , but also a sgr and magnetar @xcite , and that other sgrs seem to be associated with massive star clusters @xcite may indicate that the final evolution of some very massive stars not only produces neutron stars , but in fact tends to produce _ highly - magnetized _ neutron stars .",
    "previously , theorists have argued that stars ( and implicitly tight binaries ) greater than @xmath169 should be impossible to form under normal circumstances at solar metallicity , due to radiation pressure on dust grains in the star - forming material , radiative heating of the accreting gas , and formation of hii regions before the complete accretion of the envelope @xcite .",
    "these calculations assume spherical symmetry , and the likely deviations from this symmetry ( e.g. an accretion disk ) will raise the upper limit on stellar masses . however , most currently published models of stellar evolution stop at @xmath170 ( i.e. @xcite ; @xcite ) , at least implicitly accepting this as an upper limit to stellar masses .",
    "thus , it would seem that the existence of lbv 1806 - 20 and of other masssive stars ( the pistol star , r136a1 , r136a2 ) may require some revision in our understanding of very massive star formation , particularly if they are near solar metallicity . alternately , pressure - induced star formation due to expanding hii regions or supernova shocks presents another possible exception to the upper limit above .",
    "this possibility is particularly intriguing given the environment of lbv 1806 - 20  the cluster contains both a late - type wolf - rayet star ( star b ) as well as at least one neutron star ( sgr 1806 - 20  see @xcite ) .",
    "since both of these objects are thought to be more evolved than the candidate lbv ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and stellar evolution progresses more rapidly for more massive stars , we are left to conclude either that their progenitors were even more massive than lbv 1806 - 20 ( which seems unlikely though not necessarily impossible  see below ) , or that star formation in this location did not occur at single epoch , but has been spread over time .",
    "sgr 1806 - 20 alone implies that at least one supernova event must have occurred previously in this region ( though it is not at all certain that this particular event occurred _ before _ the formation of the candidate lbv star ) . as a consequence",
    ", it seems quite possible that the formation of lbv 1806 - 20 was triggered by the expanding hii regions or supernova events from prior epochs of star formation at this location , resulting in its unusually high mass .",
    "we also note the simultaneous presence of candidate lbv and wr stars in the quintuplet cluster @xcite , as well  confirming that this situation is not unique and revelaing yet another similarity between lbv 1806 - 20 and the pistol star .",
    "we have presented near - infrared imaging and spectroscopy of the luminous star lbv 1806 - 20 and 3 other nearby luminous stars . based on the results we conclude that lbv 1806 - 20 has spectral characteristics very similar to those of ag car , the pistol star , and p cyg  all luminous blue variables  and is thus likely to be an lbv itself .",
    "the nearby luminous stars b , c , and d are wolf - rayet wc9d and possible blue hypergiant stars forming part of a cluster which includes lbv 1806 - 20 . their absolute magnitudes and bolometric luminosities are consistent with other known stars with similar spectral types , confirming the distance and reddening estimates for lbv 1806 - 20 ( @xmath171 kpc and @xmath74 mag ) . with a surface temperature in the range 18000 - 32000k , lbv 1806 - 20",
    "has a bolometric luminosity @xmath172 .",
    "if we drop kinematic measurements of the distance ( @xmath171 kpc ) , we have a lower limit on the distance of @xmath2 kpc , and on the luminosity of @xmath3 , based on the cluster stars .",
    "if we drop both the kinematic and cluster star indicators for distance , an ammonia absorption feature sets yet another lower limit to the distance of @xmath4 kpc , with a corresponding luminosity estimate of @xmath5 for the candidate lbv 1806 - 20 .",
    "our speckle imaging shows conclusively that lbv 1806 - 20 is _ not _ an unresolved cluster of stars , though it may be a binary / multiple system . if lbv 1806 - 20 is a single or multiple star , its total mass exceeds @xmath173 ( at the @xmath24 kpc distance ) .",
    "finally , the presence of lbv 1806 - 20 with more evolved stars in the same cluster ( i.e. the w - r wcl star and sgr 1806 - 20 ) implies that star formation may have occurred over multiple epochs in this region of space .",

    "<S> we report near - infrared photometry , spectroscopy , and speckle imaging of the hot , luminous star we identify as candidate lbv 1806 - 20 . </S>",
    "<S> we also present photometry and spectroscopy of 3 nearby stars , which are members of the same star cluster containing lbv 1806 - 20 and sgr 1806 - 20 . </S>",
    "<S> the spectroscopy and photometry show that lbv 1806 - 20 is similar in many respects to the luminous `` pistol star '' , albeit with some important differences . </S>",
    "<S> they also provide estimates of the effective temperature and reddening of lbv 1806 - 20 , and confirm distance estimates , leading to a best estimate for the luminosity of this star of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the nearby cluster stars have spectral types and inferred absolute magnitudes which confirm the distance ( and thus luminosity ) estimate for lbv 1806 - 20 . </S>",
    "<S> if we drop kinematic measurements of the distance ( @xmath1 kpc ) , we have a lower limit on the distance of @xmath2 kpc , and on the luminosity of @xmath3 , based on the cluster stars . </S>",
    "<S> if we drop both the kinematic and cluster star indicators for distance , an ammonia absorption feature sets yet another lower limit to the distance of @xmath4 kpc , with a corresponding luminosity estimate of @xmath5 for the candidate lbv 1806 - 20 . furthermore , based on very high angular - resolution speckle images , we determine that lbv 1806 - 20 is not a cluster of stars , but is rather a single star or binary system . </S>",
    "<S> simple arguments based on the eddington luminosity lead to an estimate of the total mass of lbv 1806 - 20 ( single or binary ) exceeding @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the possible uncertainties in these results , and their implications for the star formation history of this cluster . </S>"
