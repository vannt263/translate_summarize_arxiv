    "the aim of this paper is to define and study the spectral statistics of the so called anderson hamiltonian which is a random linear operator on the torus @xmath13 , formally defined as @xmath14 where @xmath2 is the laplacian operator with periodic boundary conditions and @xmath3 a real white noise distribution on @xmath15 , i.e. a centered gaussian random field with covariance function given by @xmath16={\\delta}(x - y)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the dirac delta distribution .",
    "we are interested in the two dimensional case @xmath18 for which the operator @xmath4 is ill - defined , as we shall see .",
    "the anderson hamiltonian has been defined for @xmath19 in  @xcite and we briefly review the main spectral properties in this case ( see section [ dimension - one ] ) to be compared with the properties we establish for the two dimensional case ( see below ) .",
    "the parabolic anderson model ( pam ) is at the heart of an active research area both in mathematics and theoretical physics .",
    "this model refers to the ( linear ) cauchy problem @xmath20 for @xmath21 and where the function @xmath22 .",
    "the pam has connections with questions on random motions in random potential , directed polymers , trapping of random paths , branching processes in random medium , anderson localization , etc .",
    "of course , the solution @xmath23 to the parabolic anderson equation may be written for @xmath21 as a function of the operator @xmath4 as @xmath24 provided one is able to define the operator @xmath4 and prove that it has a discrete real spectrum @xmath25 and associated orthonormal eigenvectors @xmath26 in @xmath5 .",
    "this fact is not trivial at all in dimension two where the operator @xmath4 is ill - defined due to the irregularity of the white noise distribution @xmath3 .",
    "the equation and the associated operator @xmath27 have been investigated in many papers before for general dimension @xmath28 in a discrete setting . in this case , the laplacian is discrete on a grid ( for example @xmath29 ) with a fixed mesh size and the white noise @xmath3 is a sequence of independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) random variables indexed by @xmath29 .",
    "the operator @xmath27 is first defined on a finite box of @xmath29 with some boundary conditions ( either periodic , dirichlet or neumann ) . the main challenge is then to consider the case of a large volume and establish the limiting properties of the model when the box size tends to infinity . in our continuous setting , a similar situation holds .",
    "we work in a finite volume where the anderson hamiltonian is restricted to the two dimensional torus ( our results may easily be extended to other boundary conditions such as dirichlet or neumman ) .",
    "our main results provide the construction of the anderson hamiltonian and we also establish that this operator displays a discrete real spectrum with an orthonormal family of eigenvectors in @xmath5 .",
    "we are also able to give partial results on the limiting statistics of its ground state ( i.e. the minimal eigenvalue ) of the anderson hamiltonian in the limit of a large volume , considering the growing family of torus @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",
    "one should not confuse our continuous setting with a finite volume with the infinite volume case of the discrete setting .",
    "in particular , an important conjecture is that the limiting spectrum ( when the volume tends to infinity ) in the discrete setting contains only isolated ( pure ) points in @xmath32 ( counting multiplicity ) associated to localized eigenvectors .",
    "equivalently , the solution of the parabolic anderson equation on @xmath33 is expected to be intermittent i.e. with a support that is localized on a few isolated islands that are far apart from each other , for large time ( see  @xcite or the forthcoming book of w. knig  @xcite for a state of the art review on the discrete setting ) . in our continuous setting ( the mesh size is @xmath34 ) , we do prove that the spectrum is discrete when the phase space has a finite volume but this situation does not correspond to the previous one ( discrete setting with infinite volume for the phase space ) . regarding the limit of infinite volume in our continuous setting , we conjecture that the spectrum becomes continuous ( with a limiting density ) when the volume tends to infinity , in contrast with the conjecture made in the discrete setting for the infinite volume with a finite mesh size .    as mentioned before , the main difficulty lies in handling the singularity of the white noise distribution @xmath3 .",
    "if @xmath8 is a smooth function , the definition of the operator @xmath35 is elementary and it is classical to prove using the spectral theory for operators with compact resolvent that it is a self - adjoint operator with a discrete spectrum @xmath36 and orthonormal eigenfunctions @xmath37 .    with a rough potential @xmath3 such as the two - dimensional white noise ,",
    "the situation is much more delicate as one has to make sense of @xmath38 for a sufficiently large class of functions @xmath39 to contain the eigenvectors of the operator @xmath27 .",
    "the eigenfunctions of @xmath27 ought to have hlder regularity @xmath40 ( they barely fail to be differentiable ) and for such functions , the product @xmath41 is not well defined .",
    "this is the classical problem which motivated it s theory of stochastic integrals .",
    "powerful tools to make sense of such products have recently been provided by paracontrolled distributions introduced in @xcite by gubinelli , imkeller and perkowsky .",
    "our approach relies on their results .",
    "the theory of regularity structures developed by m. hairer in @xcite in 2013 could also have been used for our purpose .",
    "our construction of the operator involves two steps : in the first one , which is purely analytic , we construct the schrdinger operator @xmath4 for a general class of rough potentials @xmath3 living in a space of hlder distributions . the important point in this deterministic construction is that the knowledge of the distribution @xmath3 is actually not sufficient to define the operator @xmath4 ( as an unbounded operator of @xmath5 ) .",
    "we will in fact need another piece of information @xmath42 which is ( roughly speaking ) the ill - defined part of the product @xmath43 ( this is explained in more details below ) . the operator @xmath27 is then defined on an explicit domain @xmath44 of functions @xmath45 which depends on an enhancement @xmath46 of the rough distribution @xmath3 containing the additional information @xmath42 , necessary to make sense of the ill - defined product @xmath41 between two distributions . in the second part of our work",
    "( see section [ sec : stoch ] ) , we show that the gaussian white noise fits in the analytic framework developed in section [ construct - order-1 ] .",
    "more precisely , we prove that one can construct @xmath42 in a robust way via smooth approximation techniques .",
    "note that this part is somehow purely stochastic and relies on classical stochastic analysis techniques .",
    "we first give the results obtained in the deterministic setting where @xmath3 is a general rough distribution living in a sobolev space with index @xmath47 defined as @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 is the schwartz space of tempered distributions and where for @xmath51 , @xmath52 denotes the @xmath53-th fourier coefficient of the distribution @xmath39 , @xmath54 the fourier transform will sometimes be denoted @xmath55 so that @xmath56 for @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "let also denote by @xmath59 the hlder - besov space ( see below in section [ sec : bony ] for a reminder of the definitions of those spaces ) .",
    "the following theorem describes the results obtained in the first analytical part of our work .",
    "because we are interested in the limiting spectral properties of the operator @xmath4 when considered on a torus or domain with large volume , we will enunciate this theorem for the torus @xmath30 of size @xmath60 .",
    "we note that the bounds we obtain are uniform in @xmath60 .",
    "this property shall be useful later on , for the asymptotic study of the spectrum of @xmath4 in the limit of large volume @xmath12 .",

    "2 .   the spectrum @xmath70 of @xmath71 is real , discrete without any accumulation point and satisfy @xmath72 when @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",

    ", the resolvent map @xmath91 is locally lipschitz .",
    "let us emphasize that the gaussian white noise on the torus satisfies the assumption of theorem [ main ] since for any @xmath47 , we have @xmath92 almost surely .",
    "the conclusions of theorem [ main ] follow from the spectral theorem applied to the resolvent operator @xmath93 which is shown to exist for @xmath94 sufficiently large ( with a fixed point argument ) and to be a compact self - adjoint operator .",
    "we see at least two interesting applications of theorem [ main ] .",
    "the first one concerns the parabolic anderson model in two dimension considered on the torus .",
    "the operator @xmath27 is simply the hamiltonian associated to the linear stochastic partial differential equation and theorem [ main ] leads to the spectral decomposition of the solution @xmath95 of which was first constructed in @xcite .",
    "the second application we see is about the schrdinger equation @xmath96 considered with periodic boundary conditions and where @xmath97 .",
    "the solution of this singular stochastic partial differential equation ( spde ) has not been constructed so far ( to the best of our knowledge ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the imaginary factor @xmath98 kills the schauder s estimate which is usually available in the presence of a laplacian term in a singular spde .",
    "theorem [ main ] provides again a spectral decomposition of the solution @xmath95 to the schrdinger equation @xmath99    our construction is straightforward to extend on a more general domain with dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions ( see also  @xcite where the authors study singular pdes on general domains ) .",
    "let us notice that the well posedness of the parabolic anderson equation which was proven in @xcite implies the second point of theorem  [ main ] .",
    "indeed , as pointed out in  @xcite , the global well posedness result of the parabolic anderson equation ensures that the heat kernel @xmath100 is a compact self - adjoint operator of @xmath65 which satisfies @xmath101 .",
    "therefore , we can define the operator @xmath4 as @xmath102 where the logarithm is understood in the sense of functional analysis . from a classical spectral analysis result",
    "( see  @xcite ) , it is well known that the compactness of @xmath103 implies the compactness of the resolvent of @xmath4 so that the the spectral theorem applies .",
    "our work in this paper can be seen as the converse of this approach in the sense that we define the operator @xmath4 on an explicit domain and we recover the well posedness result by taking @xmath104 .",
    "our construction for the operator has the advantage of being more explicit .",
    "let us emphasize that theorem  [ main ] can be generalized to the @xmath28 dimensional torus .",
    "moreover , the reader who is familiar with the theory of regularity structure @xcite , may guess that the condition @xmath105 could be improved to @xmath106 .",
    "this extension would allow one to handle even rougher potentials @xmath3 such as the gaussian white noise on the three dimensional torus .    as mentioned previously",
    ", the two - dimensional gaussian white noise @xmath3 satisfies the assumptions of theorem  [ main ] . in particular",
    ", the operator @xmath4 has in this case a discrete real spectrum which is continuous with respect to the enhanced gaussian white noise @xmath107 . as explained below",
    ", theorem  [ main ] shall also permit one to obtain a smooth approximation result for the operator @xmath4 associated to the gaussian white noise @xmath3 .",
    "we now explain this approximation result in more details .",
    "if @xmath108 is an approximation of the identity and @xmath109 is a mollification of the gaussian white noise @xmath3 , then the operator @xmath110 is an unbounded operator of @xmath65 whose domain is the sobolev space @xmath111 .",
    "its resolvent @xmath112 , which is well defined for @xmath94 large enough , is compact and we can apply the spectral theorem .",

    "moreover , the limiting distribution @xmath127 does not depend on the mollification function @xmath128 and the normalizing constant @xmath9 has the following asymptotic expansion @xmath129 where @xmath130 refers to any fixed constant , independent of @xmath131 .",
    "note that the asymptotic expansion is universal at the leading order when @xmath122 , in the sense that the largest term does not depend on the mollification @xmath132 used for the regularization .",
    "the second term @xmath130 is however not universal and one can actually choose any constant in @xmath32 so that the theorem [ th : conv ] remains valid . as a consequence ,",
