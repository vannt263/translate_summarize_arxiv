    "measurements of radiative decays of light vector mesons provide good tests of the quark model and extend our understanding of su(3 ) symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "the discovery of the rare decay @xmath1 by cmd-2 @xcite has brought the last piece into the otherwise complete mosaic of radiative dipole magnetic transitions between light vector and pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "this observation was later confirmed by the snd group @xcite .",
    "recently cmd-2 presented an improved measurement of the rate of the @xmath1 decay @xcite based on the total data sample accumulated in the @xmath6-meson energy range .",
    "the first preliminary results by the kloe collaboration on the @xmath7 value reported recently @xcite are consistent with those from cmd-2 and snd within the experimental uncertainties .    because of the rather low probability of the studied decay as well as serious background problems resulting in strict selection criteria ,",
    "none of the above measurements have good statistical precision .",
    "one way to increase a sample of @xmath8 events is to use other decay modes of the @xmath9 and @xmath10 mesons . in most of the previous papers @xcite events of the decay @xmath1",
    "were selected in the mode @xmath2 , @xmath11 . the pure neutral decay chain @xmath12 , @xmath13 has been also used by the kloe group @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study the decay @xmath1 with the cmd-2 detector at vepp-2 m in the channels : @xmath14    the analysis is based on the data sample collected in three scans of the c.m.energy range from 0.984 to 1.060 gev performed in winter 19971998 .",
    "the total integrated luminosity of about 11.6 @xmath0 corresponds to approximately 16 million @xmath6 meson decays .",
    "the general purpose detector cmd-2 has been described in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "it consists of a drift chamber ( dc ) @xcite and a proportional z - chamber @xcite , both used for the trigger , and both inside a thin ( 0.4 @xmath15 ) superconducting solenoid with a field of 1 t.    the barrel calorimeter @xcite which is placed outside the solenoid , consists of 892 csi crystals of @xmath16 @xmath17 size and covers polar angles from @xmath18 to @xmath19 .",
    "the energy resolution for photons is about 9% in the energy range from 50 to 600 mev .",
    "the angular resolution is about 0.02 radians .",
    "the end - cap calorimeter @xcite which is placed inside the solenoid , consists of 680 bgo crystals of @xmath20 @xmath17 size and covers forward - backward polar angles from 16@xmath21 to 49@xmath21 and from 131@xmath21 to 164@xmath21 .",
    "the energy and angular resolution varies from 8% to 4% and from 0.03 to 0.02 radians respectively for the photons in the energy range from 100 to 700 mev .",
    "the luminosity was determined from bhabha scattering events at large angles @xcite .",
    "the specific signature of the processes ( [ eq:3pi ] ) and ( [ eq : ppg ] ) is the final state with four charged pions coming from the interaction region and two or more photons .",
    "it is well known that the @xmath6 meson decays do not provide such a signature with the exception of the following decays into kaons : @xmath22 however , because of the large lifetime of kaons charged particles originating from the kaon decays have a broad distribution of the impact parameter with respect to the interaction point .",
    "it is this feature which will be used to suppress this background and control the contamination of the final event sample .",
    "another background reaction is @xmath23 , @xmath24 followed by the dalitz decay of one of the pions : @xmath25 . in this case",
    "the distribution of the minimum space angle between the charged tracks has a characteristic peak at small angles .",
    "we selected events with four charged tracks coming from the interaction region : the maximum impact parameter of the tracks @xmath26 is less than 1 cm and the vertex coordinate along the beam axis @xmath27 is within @xmath28 cm . for better reconstruction efficiency , tracks were also required to cross at least two superlayers of the drift chamber : @xmath29 .",
    "two or more photons have to be detected in the calorimeter .",
    "for the selected events the kinematic fit was performed taking into account energy  momentum conservation and assuming all charged particles to be pions .",
    "one of the main problems in the analysis is additional ( `` fake '' ) photons induced by the products of nuclear interactions of charged pions in the detector material .",
    "the following method was used to suppress such fake photons . in the kinematic fit the energy resolution of photons",
    "was loosened to the value @xmath30 + 20 mev .",
    "thus , the photon energy was allowed to vary in a wide range during the fit . as the first step",
    ", the fit was performed in the hypothesis of the @xmath31 final state . for events with more than two detected photons ( @xmath32 )",
    "the fit was repeated for all possible pairs of photons and the pair with the smallest @xmath33 characterizing the fit quality was selected .",
    "then , for these events , the assumption of the @xmath34 state was tested . for events with @xmath35 ,",
    "the combination of three photons with the smallest @xmath36 was selected .",
    "finally , the signature @xmath31 or @xmath34 was assigned to the event depending on whether the magnitude of @xmath33 or @xmath36 was smaller .",
    "then the requirement on the fit quality @xmath37 was applied : @xmath38 .",
    "events with the reconstructed photon energy below 30 mev were rejected from the subsequent analysis .",
    "the background coming from the decay @xmath39 , in which products of kaon nuclear interaction scatter back to the drift chamber and induce two extra tracks or one of the kaon decays via the @xmath40 channel , accompanied by fake photons , was suppressed using ionization losses of the tracks ( see @xcite for more detail ) . requiring @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the total energy of the tracks , additional suppression of this type of the background was achieved .",
