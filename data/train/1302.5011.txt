    "galaxy evolution is believed to be heavily influenced by interactions between galaxies , both for local systems and for distant objects at earlier cosmological times . in the canonical view ,",
    "interactions between galaxies have three primary observable effects . in the most dramatic cases ,",
    "interactions stimulate star formation in a burst of activity that is presumed to power the high infrared ( ir ) luminosities typically seen in such systems .",
    "many local ultra - luminous ir galaxies ( l @xmath0  l@xmath1 ; ulirgs ) and luminous ir galaxies ( @xmath2  l@xmath3 l @xmath4  l@xmath1 ; lirgs ) show evidence of galaxy interactions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "similarly , their high - redshift counterparts , sub - millimeter galaxies , first detected by scuba and now studied extensively by the spectral and photometric imaging receiver ( spire ) on the _ _ herschel space observatory _",
    "_ , are thought to be predominantly mergers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although the relative contribution of mergers of different stages to their numbers is still an open question ( e.g. , hayward _",
    "et al . _  2012a , 2012b )",
    "the second effect is that interactions significantly affect the subsequent evolution of galaxies , which may lead to significant changes in their morphology .",
    "disturbed galaxies have long been associated with mergers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "numerical simulations of interactions ( e.g. , hopkins _ et al . _  2006",
    "; hopkins 2012 ; mihos & hernquist 1994 , 1996 ; barnes 1992 ; barnes & hernquist 1996 ; sanders 1999 ) show a variety of morphological distortions as well as variable amounts of star formation .",
    "the simulations also demonstrate the complexity of the problem : the degree of induced activity and distortion varies greatly with the parameters of the encounter , the phase of the interactions , the molecular gas content (  wetness \" ) , and the mass of the progenitor galaxies among many other properties .",
    "third , the canonical picture , as seen in many simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , involves merger - driven gas inflow to the central regions , resulting in heightened activity of the central supermassive black hole as well as starburst activity due to the increased central gas density and possibly turbulence .",
    "the process in principle converts a low - luminosity nucleus into an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) but one whose luminosity might range widely depending on the stage of the interaction .",
    "indeed , observations of merging galaxies over the years have tended to provide evidence supporting the conclusion that , at least on a statistical level , interactions trigger an enhancement in the formation of stars as well as nuclear activity .",
    "however , the recent literature includes works that argue both for and against a strong connection between nuclear activity and mergers ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , despite many previous studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , both observational and through simulations , our understanding of the evolution of the physical activity during the course of a galaxy - galaxy interaction remains incomplete . in the past decade ,",
    "two new developments have dramatically changed our understanding of star formation and accretion activity around galactic nuclei , which are the two dominant processes at work in controlling the observed emission .",
    "the first is the success of space missions , in particular , the _ _ spitzer space telescope _ _",
    "@xcite and the _ herschel space observatory _ @xcite in the ir , as well as the _ _ galaxy evolution explorer _ _ ( _ galex _ ; martin _ et al . _",
    "2005 ) and _ swift _ @xcite in the ultraviolet ( uv ) , providing photometry across the complete spectral range from uv to millimeter wavelengths .",
    "most importantly , detailed imaging and high sensitivity photometry now available at the critical far - infrared ( fir ) emission peak resulting from warm , luminous dust heated by starbursts provides crucial information regarding dust heating and embedded star formation .",
    "the combination of uv and ir observations is essential to obtain a complete census of recent and ongoing star formation by capturing both the unobscured and obscured emission from young stars .",
    "the second development has been the success of computational codes .",
    "we have new tools for the derivation of galaxy properties including masses , star formation rates , and interstellar medium ( ism ) parameters from global fits , which allow self - consistent measurements of critical parameters combining stellar evolution models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with radiative transfer through a dusty ism ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a second set of tools uses sophisticated hydrodynamic computational codes to simulate interactions ( e.g. , gadget - * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while simultaneously new radiative transfer models can compute the predicted emission from these evolving interacting systems ( e.g. , sunrise - * ? ? ?",
    "it is important to recognize that observational biases can be significant . due to the long timescales of an interaction ( typically 10@xmath5 years )",
    ", observers rely on studies of a range of interacting systems to reconstruct a likely sequence of events .",
    "moreover , determining the exact phase of any particular observed interaction from its morphology is uncertain at best , because the appearance of a system at a given interaction phase also depends on the specific geometry of the encounter , the masses of the galaxies , metallicity , molecular gas content , and ( not least ) previous interaction histories ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "systems are ordered into an evolutionary sequence using intuition provided by simulations and physical models , which are themselves based on observations of particular systems .",
    "selection criteria , however , can introduce a bias for more luminous , morphologically disturbed systems and , hence , towards the most active phases of interactions .",
    "therefore , a selection criterion not associated with either morphological disturbance or degree of activity is critical for obtaining a sample containing systems throughout the full interaction sequence .",
    "we have undertaken a program to take advantage of all these developments : full , multi - wavelength datasets of an interacting galaxy sample selected with few biases ; hydrodynamic simulations ; and radiative transfer modeling , in a systematic effort to better understand systems across a range of interaction stages and to iterate refinements to the various modeling and radiative transfer codes .",
    "we have chosen a representative sample of objects spanning the interaction sequence , obtained their full spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , and are comparing the results against a variety of models - based on both templates / stellar evolution / radiative transfer and on diagnostic features .",
    "this first paper of the project presents results and conclusions for a sample of thirty - one interacting galaxies in fourteen systems for which there are currently complete multi - wavelength data that can be used to study the variations in their star formation and dust heating .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we describe the full _ spitzer _ interacting galaxy survey ( sigs ) sample in section 2 and the classification of each of the sources in the interaction sequence .",
    "section 3 describes the wide range of observational photometry used to construct the seds .",
    "it also describes the issues associated with obtaining reliable photometry from the diverse datasets . in section 4 ,",
    "we model the seds of these objects .",
    "section 5 discusses the variations seen across the interaction sequence and constraints imposed by photometry from different instruments and compares star formation rates derived using the entire sed to those from relations depending on one or two wavelengths . in section 6 , we summarize our results .",

    "we now discuss the shape of the sed as a function of the interaction stage .",

    "the sed shapes between the three stages vary by approximately as much as the variations within a stage . however , there are some significant variations , especially in the stage 4 seds compared to the stage 2 and 3 seds .",
    "stage 4 galaxies typically have more emission from the hot / warm dust than earlier interaction stages , as evidenced by the stronger 10@xmath7460  @xmath9 m  emission relative to their stellar mass .",
    "further , stage 4 galaxies tend to have more warm dust relative to their cold dust fir emission .",
    "in contrast to this variation in the relative mir emission , all three stages have similar ratios of nir stellar emission to fir emission from cold dust .",
    "we will discuss the statistical significance of these results in the next section .",
    "these differences in the seds are consistent with the results of simulations , which predict that an integrated sed of an interacting system becomes hotter at merger coalescence during the peak of starburst and agn activity ( e.g. , hayward _ et al . _",

    "none of the galaxies in our sample have typical agn colors , based on their location outside the region in irac color space defined by @xcite ( figure [ stern ] ) .",
    "further , while five of the sample galaxies are classified as seyfert galaxies and three are classified as low - ionization nuclear emission - line region ( liner ) galaxies , they are found in all three stages . we used the software decompir @xcite to estimate the agn contribution to the 8@xmath741000  @xmath9 m  and 8@xmath7435  @xmath9 m  emission for these nine galaxies based on the 8 - 500  @xmath9 m  photometry . we give the individual contributions in the descriptions in the appendix c ; the range of the contribution to the total ir is up to 10% with some larger , more uncertain values up to 25% .",
    "further , we do not find significant differences in the agn contribution to either the total infrared luminosity or mid - infrared luminosity , where the stage 4 seds are typically brighter , between the stages .",
    "hence , the effect of agn on the seds of the sample galaxies is modest and does not affect our conclusions .",
    "the more strongly interacting systems demonstrate a tendency to have , on average , younger stellar populations , resulting in stronger uv emission relative to their nir emission .",
    "since the uv emission has only been corrected for milky way extinction , additional intrinsic extinction could increase this effect . ignoring ngc 4649 , a large elliptical that has very little mir - fir emission ,",

    "both the mass of warm dust and of cold dust likewise differ .",
    "the warm dust mass also differs between the stage 4 galaxies and the non - interacting galaxies .",
    "in contrast , the distribution of dust mass in the ism of non - interacting galaxies falls between the distributions of stage 2/3 and stage 4 galaxies .",
    "the dust mass in the ism and stellar mass also each show only small increases in their median values as the interaction sequence progresses , and their cumulative distributions are not significantly different . indeed , both the stellar mass ( @xmath348 ) and total dust mass ( @xmath348 ) for stage 2 and stage 3 galaxies are consistent with coming from the same populations .",
    "these trends are consistent with the sed shapes described in  5.1 , where the stage 4 seds typically show more emission from the hot / warm dust relative to the cold dust emission and stellar emission .",
    "the dust luminosity ( figure [ ldust_dist ] , left ) shows marginally statistically significant differences between stage 3 and stage 4 galaxies ( @xmath349 ) and between the non - interacting galaxies and the stage 4 galaxies ( @xmath347 ) . the median dust luminosity increases with interaction stage by over an order of magnitude between stage 2 and stage 4 .",
    "@xcite defined an `` ir main sequence '' of galaxies in which the ratio of total ir luminosity to 8  @xmath9 m  luminosity has a gaussian distribution .",
    "we examined this ratio for our sample and found good agreement with the expected distribution .",
    "the only interacting galaxy that lies off this relation , by roughly an order of magnitude , is the large elliptical ngc 4649 , as would be expected . @xcite",
    "also defined two modes of star formation : a `` normal '' mode exemplified by the galaxies on the ir main sequence and a `` starburst '' mode with excess ssfr in comparison .",
    "our sample s agreement with the ir main sequence indicates that our set of interacting galaxies do not contain systems with significantly increased ssfr .",
    "we also considered the evolution of the cold and warm dust temperatures .",
    "the cold dust temperature ( figure [ ldust_dist ] , right ) is the third parameter showing evidence for differences between the stage 3 and stage 4 ( @xmath349 ) and between the non - interacting galaxies and the stage 4 galaxies ( @xmath349 ) . the cold dust temperature s median value varies in a similar manner to the ir luminosity , increasing between stages 3 and 4 but relatively constant between stages 2 and 3 ; the median value of the warm dust temperature is by contrast fairly constant .",
    "only stage 4 does not span the range of the 15@xmath7425 k cold dust temperature , while in stage 2 and stage 4 the warm dust temperatures are confined to the 45@xmath7460 k range .",
    "the similarity in evolutionary trend in the ir luminosity and cold dust temperature is likely due to the predominance of cold dust mass and luminosity in the total dust estimates .",
    "we might expect a similar trend to be exhibited in the temperature of the warm dust primarily present in the stellar birth clouds , however the warm dust temperature is less well constrained in magphys than the cold dust temperature .",
    "the cold dust contribution and warm dust temperature are both correlated with the warm dust mass ( which drives the mir continuum intensity and the shape of the sed ) .",
    "therefore , the warm dust temperature pdfs tends to be broader , with a 68% range that is typically four to five times the size of the cold dust 68% confidence interval .",
    "however , since the cold dust mass is typically over @xmath350% of the total dust mass , the total dust mass is still fairly well constrained .",
    "the sfr , shown in figure [ sfr_dist ] ( left ) , shows an increase in median value with interaction stage , like the the dust mass and dust luminosity , and has a marginally significant probability the same population did not yield the stage 4 galaxies as well as the stage 2 ( @xmath351 ) , stage 3 ( @xmath347 ) , and non - interacting ( @xmath347 ) galaxies .",
    "since the warm ( 30@xmath7460 k ) dust , primarily heated by young stars with ages less than 10 myr , contributes significantly to the total dust luminosity , it makes sense that these three parameters show similar evolution over the interaction stages .",
    "however , an increase in sfr between the different stages could be also attributed to our stage 4 galaxies simply being larger with greater gas reservoirs . to test this",
    ", we also examined the evolution of ssfr over the interaction stages ( figure [ sfr_dist ] , right ) .",
    "in contrast to sfr , we do not find much difference in the median values of the ssfr , and the cumulative distributions are very similar in both width and normalization .",
    "we therefore do not see enhanced ssfr in more evolved mergers , consistent with the ratios of total ir luminosity to 8  @xmath9 m  luminosity being due to a `` normal '' mode of star formation for our whole sample .",
    "we also do not see differences between the distributions of the ssfr of the three interacting galaxy samples and of the non - interacting galaxies .",
    "xu et al . ( 2010 ) and yuan et al .",
    "( 2012 ) examined star formation in a sample of local major mergers and both found that that the ssfr distributions of galaxies in spiral - spiral interactions and non - interacting systems were unlikely to originate from the same population ( based on a k - s test : @xmath352 ) .",
    "however , they also found a mass dependence in the enhancement of ssfr ; only those galaxies with @xmath353 were found to have significant enhancements .",
    "our sample shows a similar trend , but we only have six galaxies with @xmath353 of which one is an elliptical , and they are spread across stages 3 and 4 .",
    "we also examined the star formation efficiency , which we define as the ratio of sfr to warm ( 30@xmath7460 k ) birth cloud dust mass , a proxy for molecular gas mass . while the ratio of dust mass to gas mass is not necessarily the same between galaxies , this ratio provides a means of estimating the star formation efficiency under the assumption of constant gas - to - dust ratio .",
    "this star formation efficiency allows us to compare the sfr taking into account the variable gas reservoirs .",
    "we find that regardless of stage , the star formation efficiency ranges over more than three orders of magnitude and the cumulative distributions show no evidence of originating from different populations .",

    "@xcite recently showed similar results for ngc 628 and ngc 6946 , where fits undertaken only with data at wavelengths @xmath361 170  @xmath9 m  tend to overpredict the emission in the spire bands and the associated cold dust mass .",

    "we compared the sfr derived by magphys to the expected sfr based on a wide range of relations ( figure [ sfrcomp ] ) : from the fuv relations of @xcite and @xcite , from the mips 24  @xmath9 m  emission relations of @xcite and zhu _ et al . _",

    "we correct the fuv emission from dust using the prescription given in @xcite and use the dust luminosity derived by magphys for the total ir luminosity .",
    "we assume a @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) and therefore have applied correction factors of 1.06 for relations that assume a @xcite imf and 1.60 for relations that assume a @xcite imf , following calzetti ( 2012 ) and schiminovich _ et al . _  2007",
    "figure [ sfrcomp ] shows the resulting values plotted against the sfr determined by magphys .",
    "one trend is quickly apparent : the sfrs estimated from uv photometry alone tend to be high compared with the sed - derived sfr , whereas the relations based solely or partially on ir photometry agree fairly well , at least for sfr greater than @xmath78 0.1 m@xmath1 yr@xmath75 .",
    "median differences are of 0.7 - 0.9 m@xmath1 yr@xmath75 for the fuv relations .",
    "interestingly , our most active galaxy , ngc 3690/ic694 , shows the inverse trend , as does a prototype starburst m82 .",
    "this may indicate that the correction for dust is insufficient for these systems .",
    "the outlier of ngc 3190 ( fig .",
    "[ sfrcomp ] ) is due to the low sfr associated with the best magphys model for this galaxy that significantly underestimated its uv emission , likely due to the edge - on geometry of the system .",
    "the apparent over - estimation of the sfr by the fuv relations is rooted in the time over which the sfr is estimated in magphys .",
    "fuv emission is dominated by star formation within the past 50 myr , although mid - to - late b stars can also contribute a significant fraction @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the ir relations typically assume that a fraction of the stellar light is absorbed to heat dust , and as a result , while the youngest and hottest stars dominate the heating of hot dust , the accumulation of low - mass stars contribute significantly to the heating of the more diffuse dust .",
    "hence , the ir relations represent star formation over a longer timescale .",
    "the sfrs derived by magphys are averaged over the last 100 myr , which is more consistent with the timescales associated with the ir - dependent sfr relations .",
    "figure [ sfrcomp ] also shows the sfrs averaged over shorter time periods with sfr modeled as an exponential decay with a peak value such that the average over 100 myr is the magphys sfr value and decay times of 20 , 30 , and 50 myr , respectively .",
    "the sfrs estimated from the fuv emission agree better with an exponential decay star formation history with a width between 30 and 50 myr , which is the expected timescale of a starburst episode .",
    "we modeled the fuv - fir seds of fourteen groups of thirty - one interacting galaxies , typically with 15@xmath7425 flux points , to determine the most probable evolution of dust luminosity , star formation rate , specific star formation rate , dust mass , stellar mass , and dust temperature .",
    "the systems were classified as either weakly , moderately , or strongly interacting ( stages 2 - 4 in the dopita _",
    "et al . _  ( 2002 ) scheme ) .",
    "the broad similarities in sed shape between different stages emphasize one key conclusion from this study : as the interaction progresses , and even as bursts of star formation may occur , the changes are most clearly seen not in the distribution of energy broadly but in minor and subtle changes to the sed shapes .",
    "bulk sed properties change little , and only gradually , in typical interactions .",
    "strongly interacting galaxies typically have seds characterized by stronger mir emission relative to both their nir and fir emission and more uv emission relative to their nir emission .    there are marginally statistically differences ( as determined by a k - s test ) in the derived galaxy properties : dust luminosity and mass , sfr , and cold dust temperature increase from stage 3 to stage 4 , sfr increase from stage 2 to stage 4 , and dust luminosity , sfr , and cold dust temperature increases from the non - interacting galaxies to the stage 4 galaxies .",
    "in contrast , the ssfr does not show variations with interaction stage .",
    "the relative constancy of the ssfr between the different stages suggests that this lack of evolution is not due to uncertainty in stage classification or in the association of interaction stage and progress along the interaction .",
    "rather , our set of interacting galaxies shows no clear evidence for a burst of star formation prompted by the interactions or that such effects occur on timescales such that we see enhancements in both stellar mass and sfr , leaving the ssfr relatively stable .",
    "this suggests a need to be circumspect about this canonical activity during the early stages of galaxy mergers .",
    "different wavelengths have different effects in constraining galaxy parameters in the magphys sed analysis .",
    "uv data are important in accurately determining stellar population age and that they are important contributors to determining accurately the ( specific ) star formation rate .",
    "the stellar mass is primarily determined by ubv - irac data .",
    "spire data are crucial in determining the dust mass ; in its absence the cold dust temperature tends to be underestimated , because the location of the peak is much less constrained without data longward of 170  @xmath9 m .",
    "cold dust mass , which tends to make up the bulk of the dust mass , goes as @xmath360 ( assuming @xmath363=2 ) , so the change in the dust mass is large for even a small underestimate in the dust temperature .",
    "the possible contributions to the sed from agn are modest for this sample and do not affect our conclusions .",
    "the sfrs derived by magphys agree reasonably well with simple relations based solely or partially on ir photometry .",
    "relations based on corrected fuv emission tended to overestimate sfr compared to the sed - derived sfr , which is averaged over 100 myr .",
    "the sfr estimated from fuv can best be understood if it represents an exponential decay star formation history with a width of 30 - 50 myr .",
    "the complete sigs sample will bring a significant increase in statistical power in determining galaxy property trends .",
    "in addition , testing the accuracy of magphys against simulations of interacting galaxies will help improve the diagnostic power of seds . in a future paper",

    "when we compared the measured fluxes to values obtained by the mips and _ iras _ instruments at the same wavelengths , we found some were more than a factor of 2 too low , with m101 having the greatest disagreement . this disagreement is the result of the range of angular extents of the galaxies .",
    "the photproject pipeline includes a high pass filtering algorithm that removes a significant portion of the extended emission in the field and therefore affects nearby galaxies with more extended emission much more egregiously . as a result , we found it essential for nearby galaxies to use the madmap pipeline .      as we noted in",
    " 3.3.2 , the uvot telescope is vulnerable to coincidence losses .",

    "there is a lack of similar understanding for extended sources .",
    "although some of the sample galaxies , notably the starburst galaxies m82 and arp 299 , have count rates high enough over most of their surface that would result in significant coincidence losses , even for the rest of the sample have regions of high fluxes , typically limited to the nuclear area and star forming regions .",
    "we therefore opted to analyze only those galaxies lacking _ galex _ photometry as well as an additional test case , as described in  3.3.2 .",

    "<S> we measured and modeled the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) in 28 bands from the ultraviolet to the far - infrared ( fir ) for 31 interacting galaxies in 14 systems . </S>",
    "<S> the sample is drawn from the _ spitzer _ interacting galaxy survey , which probes a range of galaxy interaction parameters at multiple wavelengths with an emphasis on the infrared bands . </S>",
    "<S> the subset presented in this paper consists of all galaxies for which fir _ herschel _ spire observations are publicly available . </S>",
    "<S> our seds combine the _ herschel _ photometry with multi - wavelength data from _ spitzer _ , </S>",
    "<S> _ galex _ , _ swift _ uvot , and 2mass . </S>",
    "<S> while the shapes of the seds are broadly similar across our sample , strongly interacting galaxies typically have more mid - infrared emission relative to their near - infrared and fir emission than weakly or moderately interacting galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we modeled the full seds to derive host galaxy star formation rates ( sfr ) , specific star formation rates ( ssfr ) , stellar masses , dust temperatures , dust luminosities , and dust masses . </S>",
    "<S> we find increases in the dust luminosity and mass , sfr , and cold ( 15 - 25 k ) dust temperature as the interaction progresses from _ moderately _ to _ strongly _ interacting and between _ non - interacting _ and _ strongly _ interacting galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we also find increases in the sfr between _ weakly _ and _ strongly _ interacting galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the ssfr remains unchanged across all the interaction stages . </S>",
    "<S> the ultraviolet photometry is crucial for constraining the age of the stellar population and the sfr , while dust mass is primarily determined by spire photometry . </S>",
    "<S> the sfr derived from the sed modeling agrees well with rates estimated by proportionality relations that depend on infrared emission . </S>"
