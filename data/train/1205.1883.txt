    "the study of cavity qed ( cqed ) has for decades been an important topic in physics .",
    "originally , the main ingredients were atoms , highly confined modes of light , and their mutual interaction .",
    "recent years have seen a rebirth of cqed , but with focus shifted from the pure setting of atoms and cavities , to the complex setting of many - body physics found in semiconductor solid - state systems .",
    "a major driving force behind this shift is the advent of quantum information technologies @xcite , with the requirements of applications pushing for the exploration of new material platforms .",
    "a scalable all - solid - state platform , where the interaction between light and matter can be engineered and controlled to a high degree @xcite , could help usher practical devices employing quantum information technologies .",
    "a solid - state platform , however , also poses new challenges owing to its inherent many - body nature , namely the effect of the environment on the fragile quantum states of light and matter and their coherent interaction , which are essential for many applications .",
    "several recent studies @xcite have shown that simple concepts useful in understanding atomic cqed systems break down on both a quantitative and qualitative level for all - solid - state cqed systems .",
    "the two main reasons for the departure from the usual picture are ( i ) the impossibility of quantum emitters in the solid - state to be described as simple two - level systems and ( ii ) the stronger coupling to structured environments in the form of , e.g. , phonons and electronic inter - particle coulomb interactions .    for an all - solid - state cqed system consisting of a semiconductor quantum dot ( qd ) and an optical microcavity especially the interaction with phonons has attracted a considerable amount of attention .",
    "it has been shown to influence cqed emission spectra @xcite , to give rise to detuning dependent spectral asymmetries in qd lifetimes @xcite , as well as yielding unexpected broadening mechanisms in connection with mollow triplets for coherently driven systems@xcite .",
    "the majority of studies has focused on the effect of phonons in the spectral domain , where typically the spectrum of the emitted light from the entire cqed system is collected and analyzed . however , for quantitative studies , measurements in the temporal domain are in many cases expected to be superior @xcite due to their insensitivity towards collection efficiencies .",
    "the study of spontaneous emission decay has been employed to probe the environment in which the emitter is emerged into , be it , e.g. , electromagnetic @xcite or plasmonic @xcite in nature .    in a previous study @xcite",
    "we showed how , at low temperatures , the phonon interaction gives to a significantly faster decay of an excited qd , whose transition frequency is blue - shifted relative to the cavity , as compared to a red - shifted qd .",
    "in addition , coupling to phonons gives rise to a renormalization of the light - matter coupling strength .",
    "similar results have independently been obtained by others @xcite .",
    "it was argued that the non - trivial phonon effects could only be explained if the phonons were treated as interacting with the electron - photon quasi - particle , the polariton , and not with the bare electron @xcite .    here , we present the details of the theory developed in ref .   and expand the treatment by comparing to an alternative method , more appropriate for higher temperatures .",
    "excellent agreement between the two methods is found in the low - temperature regime , which is of our primary concern .",
    "we perform an extensive parameter study , providing , a good picture of the dynamics in different regimes .",
    "we furthermore derive an analytical expression for the qd decay rate , which makes the involved physical processes apparent .",
    "the analytical expression has very recently been used to experimentally map out the effective phonon density @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it inspired to a novel approach for decreasing phonon - induced dephasing in cqed systems @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we provide a simple explanation as to why phonon - induced asymmetries have largely remained unobserved in experimental data until recently .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec : model_system we describe the model , emphasizing the interaction with phonons , and introduce the the polaron transformation enabling the treatment of higher temperatures .",
    "[ sec : eom_main ] gives a detailed description of the theoretical formalisms employed as well as providing a physical interpretation of the resulting equations of motion .",
    "we pursue two methods ; the first is based on a second - order expansion in the phonon coupling , yielding simple equations that provide valuable insight into the physics .",
    "the second method employs a partially infinite order expansion in the phonon coupling , based on the polaron transformation , which leads to more accurate results but less physical insight . in sec : results_main we present a detailed parameter investigation of the models , covering experimentally relevant parameter regimes and discuss the physics of the system .",
    "furthermore , we perform a large detuning expansion and obtain analytical expressions for the total decay rate of the qd , which explicitly accounts for the different contributions to the system decay and make the physical processes very apparent . finally in sec :",
    "summary_conclusion we summarize and conclude .",
    "in this section we present the model used to describe the cqed system , including the interaction with phonons .",
    "the system is illustrated schematically in fig : qed_system .",
    "we also devote a section to the polaron transformation .     and the qd - phonon interaction matrix elements are @xmath0 . the rates @xmath1 and @xmath2 yield decay of the qd and cavity , respectively .",
    "pure dephasing of the qd is included through @xmath3 and @xmath4 is the qd - cavity detuning.,scaledwidth=47.0% ]      the part of the system consisting of the qd and cavity can be represented by the hamiltonian @xmath5 here @xmath6 describes the qd - cavity system and @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 describe various interactions with the environment , included as lindblad loss terms @xcite , to be discussed below .",
    "the qd - cavity hamiltonian reads @xmath10 where the usual rotating wave and dipole approximations have been applied .",
    "the energy of the ground ( excited ) qd state is @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) with corresponding fermionic operators @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) , the energy of the cavity photon is @xmath15 with corresponding bosonic operators @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is the interaction strength between the cavity photon and the electron in the qd . as we are only concerned with the dynamics of the system on the single photon level , it is advantageous to project the second quantized hamiltonian , presented above , onto a lower dimensional hilbert space . an appropriate basis to span this part of the total hilbert space is the following : @xmath18 , where @xmath19 refers to the number of cavity photons . if we project onto this basis and shift to a rotating frame , we can write the qd - cavity system hamiltonian as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the qd - cavity detuning and @xmath22 is the standard projection operator .",
    "the detailed steps are given in app : fundamental_hamil .",
    "the remaining terms in @xmath23 all give rise to different forms of losses , which we include through the lindblad formalism often employed in density matrix theory .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath7 represents pure dephasing processes , with rate @xmath3 , for all transitions connected to the qd , whereas the hamiltonians @xmath8 and @xmath9 account for population decay from the cavity and qd by rates @xmath2 and @xmath1 , respectively @xcite .",
    "these rates are taken as parameters with experimentally relevant values .",
    "the hamiltonians involving phonons are given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 describes the free phonons and @xmath26 describes the electron - phonon interaction .",
    "it should be noticed that we assume bulk phonon modes@xcite .",
    "the la phonon dispersion relation is assumed to be linear in the relevant energy range , @xmath27 , with @xmath28 the speed of sound .",
    "@xmath29 are the bosonic operators for the phonons .",
    "the matrix element @xmath30 in the electron - phonon interaction is@xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 the is mass density , @xmath28 is the speed of sound in the material , @xmath33 is the phonon quantization volume , @xmath34 is the deformation potential , and @xmath35 is the electronic wavefunction for the state involved in the phonon process .",
    "we neglect the polar coupling to longitudinal optical ( lo ) phonons due to their large energies , @xmath36 , compared to the energies involved in this model , and hence very non - resonant nature . also , we neglect the piezoelectric coupling to la phonons , which has been shown to have a small effect for the present system @xcite .    to model the qd wavefunctions , we consider harmonic confinement in the direction perpendicular to the growth direction@xcite and infinite potentials in the growth direction .",
    "this implies wavefunctions for both the ground and excited state of the form @xmath37 \\\\ \\times\\cos ( \\pi z / l_{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{eff , z } } } ) , ~ { \\lvert z \\rvert } \\leq l_{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{eff , z}}}/2   \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where the confinement lengths @xmath38 and @xmath39 can be chosen to model a specific system .",
    "we choose qd and phonon parameters suitable for typical ingaas systems @xcite .",
    "if we take advantage of the fact that we only consider a single electron , i.e. @xmath40 , and project onto the basis introduced above , we obtain @xmath41 where we introduced the effective matrix element @xmath42 the details are presented in app : fundamental_hamil .",
    "we start from the following hamiltonian@xcite @xmath43 obtained by combining eqs .",
    "( [ eq : hs_def_first ] ) , ( [ eq : h0_ph_def ] ) , and ( [ eq : heph_def_first ] ) .",
    "we then apply the polaron transformation @xcite , where an operator @xmath44 transforms as @xmath45 where @xmath46 the idea behind the transformation is to remove the term linear in the phonon operators in order to arrive at a set of equations that is easier to treat .",
    "physically , the transformation shifts the phonon modes according to the presence of the electron , determined by the operator @xmath47 . from the exponential nature of the transformation operator @xmath48 , phonon processes are included to infinite order .",
    "this has the consequence that multi - phonon effects are easily included in the theory , allowing for the description of experiments performed at high temperatures .",
    "we use the bar to signify the transformed frame .",
    "the hamiltonian in the polaron frame becomes @xmath49 with    [ eq : hpol_individual ] @xmath50    it should be noted that a constant energy shift , induced by the phonons , has been absorbed in the qd - cavity detuning @xmath4 , see eq : polaron_shift .",
    "also , new phonon related operators have been introduced @xmath51 where it holds that @xmath52 the brackets denote the expectation value with respect to the thermal density matrix for the phonons , more precisely @xmath53 .",
    "the detailed derivation can be found in app : polaron_trans_hamil and various relevant properties of the operators @xmath54 are described in app : prop_phon_op . due to the polaron transformation ,",
    "the division of the total hamiltonian into a qd - cavity system part and a phonon part is no longer possible .",
    "indeed , the new system hamiltonian , @xmath55 , contains the phonon quantity @xmath56 which is seen to renormalize the light - matter coupling strength @xmath17 .",
    "it should also be noted that defining the new system hamiltonian in this way , we include photon processes to infinite order and respect the detailed balance condition @xcite . from the expression for @xmath56 , see eq : x_avg_def , it is obvious that @xmath57 .",
    "the interaction with phonons will thus always decrease the effective light - matter coupling strength as a consequence of this .",
    "the new interaction hamiltonian , @xmath58 , contains the phonon fluctuation operators @xmath59 , describing fluctuations of the phonon bath around its equilibrium value , as well as the light - matter coupling strength @xmath17 .",
    "in this section we present the theoretical formalism employed for analyzing the system , described by the hamiltonians of the previous section .",
    "the explicit form of the equations of motion is also presented .",
    "our basic approach is to set up an equation of motion for the reduced density matrix ( rdm ) of the qd - cavity system , where the phonon degrees of freedom are traced out .",
    "this is a standard technique @xcite in which the effect of the reservoir enters through various scattering terms in the equation of motion ( eom ) for the rdm .",
    "these scattering terms can be derived by two different approaches . in the first , known as the nakajima - zwanzig projection operator technique @xcite",
    ", the resulting eoms have memory : the present state of the system thus depends on the past history . in the second ,",
    "known as the time - convolutionless approach @xcite ( tcl ) , the eoms are time - local and therefore do not have memory , however , the scattering rates become time - dependent .",
    "both of these approaches yield , without further approximations , a non - markovian description of the dynamics .    in this paper",
    "we employ the tcl up to second order in the perturbation , for the following two reasons : the first and most important is that in the limit where the light - matter coupling tends to zero , our model reduces to the so - called independent boson model @xcite .",
    "this model is known to be exactly solvable using a number of methods , one being the second order tcl @xcite . even though the present model can not be solved exactly using the second order tcl",
    ", we expect the result to be more accurate compared to that obtained using the method involving memory integrals , since that method does not lead to the exact solution to second order for @xmath60 .",
    "other studies have also shown the tcl to be superior to the corresponding equation with memory @xcite .",
    "the second reason is purely practical , in that time - local equations are simpler to solve than equations containing memory integrals    the eoms arising from the tcl may be derived in a completely general framework @xcite , however we follow a less rigorous approach in deriving the tcl and present the resulting formulas in app : eom_rdm .      as mentioned in sec : cqed_system , we also include interactions with other reservoirs than phonons to simulate a real system with losses .",
    "these are included using the lindblad formalism @xcite , where terms of the form @xmath61 } } ,   \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] are added to the eom for @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the rdm for the qd - cavity system , @xmath64 is the density matrix for the total system , and @xmath65 denotes the trace operation with respect to the phonon degrees of freedom .",
    "the above leads to decay with rate @xmath3 of the transition corresponding to the operator @xmath44 .",
    "this expression may be obtained by taking the white noise , or equivalently zero memory , and zero temperature limit of the scattering terms presented in app : eom_rdm .",
    "the decay of the cavity field through leaky modes is modeled by including the lindblad term @xmath66 , the decay of the excited qd through radiative and non - radiative processes is modeled by including @xmath67 , and finally a markovian pure dephasing rate is also included through @xmath68 .",
    "we refer to sec : cqed_system for notational remarks .",
    "since la phonons have been included explicitly , and already give rise to a pure dephasing rate , it might seem redundant to introduce an additional pure dephasing channel .",
    "however , previous work has demonstrated that excited states for electrons and holes contribute to pure dephasing processes near the ground state transition energy , due to both la @xcite and lo @xcite phonon interactions . also , including a finite lifetime of either lo and la phonons , arising , e.g. , from anharmonic effects @xcite , induces a contribution to the pure dephasing rate @xcite . for simplicity ,",
    "we assume @xmath3 to be an independent parameter .",
    "the resulting eoms we arrive at are all linear in the elements of the rdm .",
    "this fact makes it advantageous to formulate the eoms in the language of linear algebra .",
    "this can be achieved by mapping the rdm onto a vector form as follows @xmath69}}^t .",

    "we present the equations arising from the hamiltonian without the polaron transformation , denoted the original frame , and with the polaron transformation , denoted the polaron frame . employing the polaron transformed hamiltonian is expected to yield more accurate results compared to the original hamiltonian , especially for elevated temperatures",
    ". however , the equations resulting from the polaron transformation are also more complicated and due to the change of basis harder to interpret physically . on the other hand ,",

    "<S> the expressions lead to a clear interpretation of the physics and emphasizes the important role played by the effective phonon density , describing the availability of phonons for scattering , in quantum dot decay dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> based on the analytical expressions we present the parameter regimes where phonon effects are expected to be important . </S>",
    "<S> also , we include all technical developments in appendices . </S>"
