    "the opening of tunneling channels between two quantum dots leads to an erosion of the individual dots coulomb blockade .",

    ", the progress of this erosion can be chronicled by tracking the splitting of the coulomb blockade conductance peaks as they evolve from doubly degenerate single - dot conductance resonances to that of nondegenerate double - dot peaks with twice the original periodicity .",
    "@xcite for a system in which the tunneling channels can be treated as having the same individual conductances and in which the coulomb charging energies are large compared to the single - particle level spacings but small compared to the tunneling channel bandwidths , the fractional peak splitting @xmath1 can be expressed as a function of two parameters : @xmath2 , the number of tunneling channels between the two dots , and @xmath0 , the dimensionless conductance per tunneling channel .",
    "( in this paper , the _ conductances _ indicated are always _ dimensionless conductances _ , by which we mean the actual conductance divided by the conductance quantum , @xmath10 . )    in particular , for weakly coupled dots ( @xmath5 ) , the fractional peak splitting can be expressed perturbatively as a sum of terms of the form @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 is independent of @xmath2 and @xmath0 .",
    "previous work  @xcite has produced the leading term in this expansion . however , as this term is simply linear in the total interdot tunneling conductance , @xmath14 , it does not effectively distinguish between behavior in the large-@xmath2 and small-@xmath2 limits . to make such a distinction , one must calculate to second order in @xmath0 , in which case one obtains two sets of terms , one set proportional to @xmath15 and the other proportional to @xmath16 .",
    "the @xmath17 terms should agree with results from the theory of metallic junctions , in which the leading terms in a large-@xmath2 expansion are calculated .",
    "@xcite    in the strong - coupling limit ( @xmath6 ) , a dramatic dependence of the peak splitting on @xmath2 has already been found . in the cases of @xmath18 and @xmath7 ,",
    "the leading nontrivial terms have been found to be proportional to @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively ,  @xcite and it has been hypothesized  @xcite that , for @xmath21 but finite , the leading nontrivial term is proportional to @xmath22 . this last suggestion appears to correspond to calculations in the large-@xmath2 limit ,  @xcite where the effective charging energy has been found to be proportional to @xmath23 , which is equivalent to @xmath24 in the limit @xmath9 .    despite the recent progress in study of the strong - coupling limit , for the case of most direct experimental interest ,  @xcite @xmath7",
    ", the leading - term calculation fails to be completely satisfactory for at least three reasons .",
    "the first is that this calculation does not answer the question of whether the coefficient of is affected by the manner in which the ultraviolet cut - off is imposed in the low - energy luttinger liquid theory .",
    "@xcite the second is that the coefficient of the sub - leading term linear in @xmath8 is both unknown and naively infinite .",
    "@xcite finally , there is the worry  which also applies to the weak - coupling result  that , for @xmath7 , interpolation between the solutions for weak- and strong - coupling is difficult because the respective @xmath1-versus-@xmath0 curves do not come especially close .",
    "@xcite    this paper addresses these three concerns for the two - channel problem and also extends earlier results for the general @xmath2-channel problem in the limit of weak coupling . in so doing",
    ", it illuminates the difference between large-@xmath2 and small-@xmath2 behavior for @xmath25 , creates a theory that can be more realistically compared to experimental results for @xmath26 , and argues for the universality of the results , which should be independent of the nature and magnitude of the ultraviolet cut - offs .",
    "section ii presents the @xmath27 extension of the weak - coupling theory and checks the result against calculations in the @xmath9 limit .",
    "section iii gives the @xmath8 correction to the leading dependence in the strong - coupling limit for @xmath7 and shows a plot of the experimental results and revised theoretical predictions for two - channel interdot junctions .",
    "section iv argues that the strong coupling results of section iii are independent of the nature of the way the ultraviolet cut - off is imposed and do not change when one allows the fermionic theory to stray from half - filling .",
    "section v summarizes the results , and appendices a and b present technical details of calculations in sections ii and iii , respectively .",
    "for weakly coupled quantum dots , we use a model `` site - to - site '' hopping hamiltonian  @xcite and calculate perturbatively in the tunneling term @xmath28 : @xmath29 as in ref . 4 , in these equations ,",
    "@xmath30 is the dot index ; @xmath31 is the channel index ; @xmath32 is the index for all internal degrees of freedom not included in the channel index ; @xmath33 is the part of the electrostatic potential energy that is affected by interdot tunneling ; @xmath34 is half the difference in dot occupation numbers , @xmath35 ; @xmath36 is a differential gate voltage parameter and is restricted to values between 0 and 1 ( as permitted by the system s unit periodicity ) ; and @xmath4 is the differential charging energy , which , for electrostatically equivalent dots , is given by the formula @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the interdot capacitance and @xmath39 is the total single - dot capacitance minus the interdot capacitance . if the dots are not electrostatically equivalent , the formula for @xmath4 and the definition of @xmath36 are more complicated .",
    "@xcite however , the model is still applicable , and the results for @xmath40 can still be used to obtain the peak splitting .",
    "these calculations are made palatable by assuming that @xmath4 is much smaller than the tunneling - channel bandwidth @xmath3 yet much greater than the average intrachannel level - spacing @xmath41 : @xmath42 this assumption leaves us with a theory that we can consider to be in the continuum limit and that we can hope to be independent of ultraviolet cut - offs . as the bandwidth is presumably of the order of the fermi energy @xmath43 , these assumptions are reasonable for the micrometer - sized dots of waugh _ et al .",
    "_ ,  @xcite for which @xmath44 mev , @xmath45ev , and @xmath46ev .",

    "it was shown in ref .",
    "4 that , if the total number of electrons on the two dots is assumed even , the problem of solving for @xmath1 is a corollary to the problem of solving for a more general quantity @xmath40 , which characterizes the ground - state energy of the double - dot when the difference between the external potentials applied to the dots is nontrivial and the total number of electrons on the two dots is fixed and even .",
    "recall the equation for @xmath40 : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the shift in the ground state energy induced by tunneling at a given value of the gate voltage parameter @xmath36 and @xmath49 is the difference between the unperturbed ground state energies for the given @xmath36 and @xmath50 . in ref .",
    "4 , it was shown that , for symmetric dots , @xmath51 in the same work , it was determined that @xmath40 exhibits the following leading behavior as @xmath5 : @xmath52 \\ , , \\label{eq : weak1rho}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 . thus , the corresponding leading behavior for @xmath1 is @xmath54    extending perturbation theory beyond this result  i.e .",
    ", beyond first - order in @xmath0 requires some laborious computation .",
    "the next - leading contributions come from two sources .",
    "the first , which we shall call @xmath55 , arises from a combination of the second - order energy shift that has already been calculated and the second term in the formula that relates the tunneling amplitude @xmath56 to the channel conductance @xmath0 .",
    "[ the first term in this formula was used to derive eq .",
    "( [ eq : weak1rho ] ) . ]",
    "the second source of @xmath27 terms , @xmath57 , is the shift in the ground - state energy provided by terms that are fourth - order in @xmath56 .",
    "the first contribution is relatively easy to calculate .",
    "the equation for @xmath0 in terms of @xmath56 has been derived for half - filling in ref .",
    "14 and for arbitrary filling in ref .",
    "4 . in the latter calculation",
    ", the system is assumed to have a constant density of states between single - particle energies @xmath58 and @xmath59 , the density of states being zero elsewhere .",
    "the system s level of `` filling '' is then characterized by the filling fraction @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the fermi energy . in accordance with the half - filling result ,",
    "one then finds the following : @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 $ ] .",
    "inverting this expression , one discovers that @xmath65 \\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : t - of - g}\\ ] ] consequently , our first @xmath66 term is equal to the right side of equation  ( [ eq : weak1rho ] ) multiplied by : @xmath67 \\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : weak2a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this term is of the expected form @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is a function of @xmath36 .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath69 is dependent on the filling fraction @xmath70 , a fact which appears to imperil our dreams of a theory that is universal in that it is insensitive to the details of the high - energy behavior ( including whether , for example , certain high - energy states exist and therefore have a role in determining the filling fraction @xmath70 ) .",
    "we shall see , however , that the @xmath70-dependence of @xmath55 actually serves our end , for it exactly cancels the @xmath70-dependence of @xmath71 . as a result",
    ", we can further conclude that , through second order in the channel conductance @xmath0 , expression of the fractional peak splitting in terms of the channel conductance is not only convenient for comparison with experiment but is also necessary and sufficient for constructing a result that can be hoped to be universal .    to support this claim",
    ", we must actually determine the value of @xmath57 .",
    "sadly , it can not be obtained as effortlessly as @xmath55 .",
    "there are 24 separate terms that contribute to the fourth - order energy shift .",
    "one 12-member subset consists of terms proportional to @xmath17 ; the second consists of those simply linear in @xmath2 .",
    "all but four of the twenty - four terms correspond to a specific series of four tunneling events that begin and end with the double - dot system s unperturbed ground state .",
    "the remaining four , which belong to the @xmath17 subset , correspond to the fourth - order terms in rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation theory that are products of the second - order energy shift and a propagator squared .",
    "these four have been described by grabert as _ diagrams with insertions_.  @xcite    in general , the nature of the twenty - four fourth - order terms is most digestibly summarized via a diagrammatic representation that looks essentially like one of time - ordered single - particle diagrams ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . despite the superficial single - particle nature of this representation , it is important to remember that the propagators that enter into the energy calculations are the propagators for the entire double - dot system , which depend upon both the tunneling particles individual kinetic energies and the system s multiparticle potential energy .",
    "the presence of the multiparticle potential energy makes it impossible to reduce the calculation to the normal feynman diagrams , for which one can write the problem entirely in terms of single - particle propagators .",
    "the presence of exchange terms , which do not appear among the diagrams proportional to @xmath17 , makes a pseudo - single - particle representation necessary .    within this time - ordered perturbation theory scheme ,",
    "the individual fourth - order terms are plagued by both ultraviolet and infrared divergences .",
    "every term is divergent as the bandwidth goes to infinity and four of the @xmath17 terms are divergent as @xmath72 .",
    "( a different set of four is divergent as @xmath73 . ) from the result for @xmath74 , we might hope to cancel the ultraviolet divergences and to obtain an answer for the ground - state energy that is infrared - singular but not infrared - divergent .",
    "indeed , as grabert has noted ,  @xcite the ultraviolet divergences of the @xmath17 terms must drop out since , in the limit @xmath75 , these terms correspond to disconnected diagrams or insertion diagrams that exactly cancel one another and thus do not appear as feynman diagrams .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath2 diagrams do have nontrivial feynman - diagram analogs . as a whole , they correspond to a single totemic feynman diagram  an individual ring marked by four    = 2.5truein    tunneling events",
    ". the ultraviolet divergences of these diagrams are therefore expected to be persistent but irrelevant because we are interested only in the relative shift between the ground - state energies for arbitrary @xmath36 and for @xmath50 ( recall eq .",
    "[ eq : frho ] ) .",
    "accordingly , we expect that , when one subtracts the fourth - order shift for @xmath76 from that for arbitrary @xmath36 , the fourth - order terms produce a result that is neither ultraviolet- nor infrared - divergent but is infrared - singular as @xmath77 .",
    "a brief summary of the actual calculation of these terms follows .",
    "those interested in more detail are invited to peruse appendix  a , which offers a fuller description of the calculation of the @xmath17 diagrams and a step - by - step computation of the contribution from one representative @xmath2 term .    for the less scrupulous , there are still a few facts worthy of note .",
    "a prominent feature of the fourth - order calculation is that each term involves the integration over four energy variables ( @xmath78 , where @xmath30 ranges from 1 to 4 ) of a product of three propagators . in the @xmath17 diagrams ,",
    "the energy variables `` pair off '' : @xmath79 and @xmath80 only appear as parts of the combination @xmath81 , and @xmath82 and @xmath83 only appear as parts of the combination @xmath84 . as a result , calculation of these terms",
    "reduces to the performance of double integrations over @xmath85 and @xmath86 albeit with a nontrivial density of states .",
    "the @xmath2 diagrams can not be handled in this way , for they involve particle exchanges that frustrate any desire to pair off the energy variables .",
    "the quadruple integration over the @xmath78 can not be eluded .",
    "it can , however , be expedited by differentiating twice with respect to @xmath36 while integrating out the energy variables and , then , integrating twice with respect to @xmath36 in the end .",
    "one might worry about the fact that , by differentiating twice with respect to @xmath36 , one has lost knowledge of terms constant and linear in @xmath36 . however , these terms are unimportant . as noted in ref .  4 , the ground - state energy ( perturbed or unperturbed ) is symmetric in @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , terms linear in @xmath36 must cancel out of the fourth - order energy shift when all the terms are summed .",
    "constant terms are similarly negligible since , as usual , we are only interested in the relative energy shift @xmath87 .",
    "after the aforementioned tricks for calculating the @xmath17 and @xmath2 diagrams have been used , the only real wrinkles that remain are integrals of the form @xmath88 where @xmath89 , @xmath90 is either @xmath70 or @xmath91 , and , as before , @xmath92 .",
    "the symbol @xmath93 indicates that , for @xmath94 , only the principal value of the integral is calculated .",
    "these integrals can be done by rewriting the argument of @xmath95 as @xmath96 $ ] and taylor - expanding about @xmath97 for @xmath98 and about @xmath99 for @xmath100 .",
    "the result of such an integration may be sensitive to whether the system is below half - filling [ @xmath101 , at half - filling [ @xmath102 , or above half - filling [ @xmath103 .",
    "however , the system as a whole has particle - hole symmetry , so one expects that the final result  once all the terms are summed  is symmetric under exchange of @xmath70 and @xmath91 .",
    "if there is no jump discontinuity when the system is precisely half full , the result for @xmath104 should determine the answer for all `` finite '' @xmath70 , by which we mean all @xmath70 such that @xmath105 .",
    "this thesis has been explicitly confirmed .",
    "indeed , the @xmath17 part of the fourth - order relative energy shift is found to be independent of the filling fraction .",

    "the present calculation therefore provides an important check on the large-@xmath2 calculations , resolving an apparent contradiction in the literature .",
