    "the subject of this talk is the calculation of the @xmath2 matrix elements of the electroweak penguin operators , conventionally denoted as @xmath3 and @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "interest in these quantities is twofold .",
    "first , the standard model prediction of @xmath5 depends crucially on the k - to-@xmath6 matrix elements of the qcd penguin ( @xmath7 ) and ew penguin ( @xmath8 ) operators ,  @xcite : @xmath9 - 2.0 ( 1 - _ ib ) - 0.50 ] , @xmath10 where the above matrix elements are evaluated in the @xmath11-ndr renormalization scheme at scale @xmath12  gev .",
    "secondly , the leading term in the chiral expansion of @xmath13 can be related to the @xmath14 qcd correlator with flavor @xmath15 , whose spectral function is experimentally accessible through @xmath16 decays @xcite .",
    "this provides the opportunity to perform a data - driven evaluation of hadronic matrix elements , whose results can then be confronted with other non - perturbative techniques ( like lattice qcd and @xmath17 expansion ) . therefore electroweak penguins provide an interesting theoretical laboratory for kaon physics .",
    "our first goal is to relate the @xmath2 matrix elements to the observable spectral functions .",
    "the first large step is done for us by chiral symmetry , which relates @xmath18 to vacuum expectation values of two 4-quark operators  @xcite ( ) _ 2 | q_7 |k^0_p^0 & = & - 2 f_0 ^ 3  _ 1  , + ( ) _ 2 | q_8 | k^0_p^0 & = & - 2 f_0 ^ 3  , where @xmath19 is the pion decay constant in the chiral limit and the definitions of @xmath20 and @xmath21 can be found in ref .",
    "the above relations receive nlo chiral corrections ( whose order of magnitude is @xmath22 ) which have been investigated within chiral perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "the second step consists in relating the v.e.v.s of @xmath23 to the @xmath24 qcd correlator @xmath25 , with flavor structure @xmath15 .",
    "the outcome is that :    * @xmath26 is related to the integral of @xmath27 over all spacelike momenta ; * @xmath28 is related to the leading singularity of @xmath29 at short distance ( large spacelike momenta ) .",
    "essential tools in a formal derivation of the above results and in relating @xmath30 to the spectral function are the dispersive representation of the correlator ( q^2)= - 2 f_^2 m_^2 + q^2 + _ s_thr^ds  ( s ) s + q^2 .[r7 ] and the operator product expansion ( ope ) representation , valid for large space - like momenta @xmath31 , which , through @xmath32 , has the form _ ope ( q^2 ) ~_d 2  1 q^d .",

    "( [ eq : basic1 ] ) and at the database on @xmath42 ( refs .",

    "in fact , we run out of data at @xmath43 , while the weighs entering @xmath40 are growing with @xmath44 .",
    "we therefore need to supply some extra theoretical input to optimize the use of data in this problem . along this path , we have followed two approaches , which can be schematically characterized as follows :    * use of data plus qcd integral constraints ( classical chiral sum rules ) .",

    "this approach is an efficient way to enforce the constraints from classical chiral sum rules  @xcite in the evaluation of the spectral integrals @xmath45 , which have the generic form : i ( ) = _ 0^ds k ( s , ) ( s )  .",
    "the basic idea is to write @xmath46 as the sum of an arbitrary combination of the weights @xmath47 , and @xmath48 and a residual term @xmath49 , as follows : k ( s , ) = x 1 + y s + z s s + r_(x , y , z ) ( s , )  .",

    "the method is effective in those situations where choices for @xmath56 exist which make @xmath57 in the region with no data ( but before the onset of asymptotia ) without amplifying the effect of imprecise knowledge of @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",

    "the determination of the @xmath61 , @xmath64 , also allows one to estimate the combinations @xmath65 , needed as input to the lower scale version of the rwm analysis , eq .",
    "( [ eq : basic1 ] ) .",
    "let us now summarize our implementation of the fesr analysis  @xcite .",
    "an fesr analysis , applied to a generic correlator @xmath66 with spectral function @xmath67 is based on the following relation ( consequence of cauchy s theorem , and the analytic structure of the correlator ) : j[w , s_0 ] + r[w , s_0 ] = f_w [ s_0 , \\ { a_d } ]  .",

    "however , the presence of @xmath71 $ ] pollutes the extraction of the ope coefficients @xmath61 in terms of data through eq .",
    "( [ du3 ] ) .",
    "therefore it is highly desirable to work with a range of @xmath70 values and with weights @xmath72 such that @xmath73 < < j[w , s_0]$ ] . to accomplish this , we rely on the observation that for @xmath74 large enough ( @xmath75 )",
    ", the ope provides a good representation of the full correlator along the whole circle , except in a region localized around the time - like axis .",
    "the physics of this breakdown is given by the arguments of poggio , quinn and weinberg @xcite .",
    "as a consequence one expects that weights with a zero at @xmath76 , de - emphasizing the region where the ope fails , are good candidates to generate a small - sized @xmath73/j[w , s_0]$ ] .",
    "we use this as the basic guiding principle in the selection of weights for our analysis .",
    "the weights were also chosen to avoid large cancellations in the spectral integrals , which would lead to a poor statistical signal .",
    "the lowest degree weights satisfying our criteria have degree 3",
    ". two useful cases ( with @xmath77 ) are : w_1 ( y ) & = & ( 1 - y)^2 ( 1 - 3 y ) + w_2 ( y ) & = & ( 1 - y)^2 y these choices imply that @xmath78 $ ] depend on the dimension six and eight condensates , thereby allowing us to extract information on @xmath36 and @xmath79 from a least - square fit .",
    "the window of @xmath70 values used in the fit procedure is @xmath80 .",
    "the lower endpoint has been determined by trying ever lower values of @xmath70 until the extracted @xmath36 ceases to be consistent with the values obtained by the smaller analysis windows . from the aleph data we obtain ( at @xmath81 gev ) : a_6 & = & ( - 4.45 0.7 ) 10 ^ -3  gev^6 [ ope ] + a_8 & = & ( - 6.2 3.2 ) 10 ^ -3  gev^8 with a correlation coefficient @xmath82 .",
    "although no precise answer emerges for @xmath79 , we see that @xmath36 ( directly related to @xmath8 ) can be determined fairly well .",
    "the errors reported above are essentially of statistical nature . in order to address potential systematic effects due to @xmath71 \\neq 0 $ ] ( duality violation )",
    ", we have repeated the fit procedure using non - overlapping @xmath70 sub - windows .",
