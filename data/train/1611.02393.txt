    "originally , measurement - based quantum computing was proposed for discrete - variable systems , i.e. , systems with finite - dimensional state space @xcite .",

    ", optical systems have been providing an appealing platform for cv quantum information processing through the measurement - based scheme due to their advantages in not only state preparation , but also in the detection and manipulation of states @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the archetypal resource state for measurement - based cv quantum computing requires two - mode squeezing operations over a set of quantum modes prepared in the zero - momentum eigenstate to form a highly entangled state commonly known as a  cluster state \" ( or a  graph state \" ) @xcite over which definite correlations among the  nodes \" of the cluster are imposed by the entanglement .",
    "since an ideal momentum eigenstate demands infinite squeezing ( hence infinite energy ) , only approximated , finite - squeezed momentum states are available in the laboratories . in practice , therefore , cv cluster states always have non - ideal correlations among their nodes due to finite squeezing , which in turn deteriorate the quality of the gate teleportation with such resource states . moreover , although two - mode squeezing operation can be implemented through inline - squeezers and beam - splitters @xcite , the rapid growing demand for its implementation along with the size of the canonical cv cluster renders the scheme experimentally challenging for practical applications . in order to alleviate the demand for inline squeezers , van loock and colleagues proposed in ref .   a linear - optical approach to the construction of cv cluster states , which consists of finding appropriate linear - optical network that can implement the desired cluster correlations over a collection of offline squeezed modes through combinations of beam - splitters and phase shifters .",

    "[ fig : mr_tel],width=340 ]    as with canonical cluster states , the linear - optical cluster states ( the qualifier ",
    "cv \" will henceforth be omitted when it is clear in context ) are also non - ideal in practice , since the initial offline squeezed modes for the cluster are always squeezed finitely .",
    "this results in imperfect cluster correlations among the cluster nodes , and cause  excess noise \" in measurement - based teleportation through such resource states . as a remedy , van loock and coworkers proposed in ref .   a multi - rail design ( see fig .  [",

    "they showed that , with increasing number of rails in the design , the excess noise becomes progressively smaller in one of the quadratures of the teleported mode .",
    "a comparison for the noise reduction was drew in ref .   for single - mode teleportation through multi - rail canonical cluster states and linear - optical cluster states .",
    "here we extend the consideration by examining the teleportation of a two - mode entangling gate , the controlled - phase ( or controlled-@xmath2 , abbreviated cz ) gate , through these two classes of cv cluster states .",
    "in particular , with the reduction of excess noise through the multi - rail design , we expect to find improvements in the quality of the teleported cz - gate , which should reveal in the enhanced entanglement in the output modes of the cluster . since the multi - rail design can increase the size of the cluster massively ( see fig .",

    "canonical cluster states for cv systems are constructed by applying cz - gates over a set of momentum - squeezed vacuum modes that constitute the  nodes \" of the cluster .",
    "explicitly , the cz - gate that acts on modes @xmath3 and @xmath7 is given by @xmath11 which is clearly symmetric between modes @xmath3 and @xmath7 . by virtue of the commutation relation ( [ qp_cmm ] ) , the cz - gate operation on the quadrature operators for mode @xmath7 yields @xmath12 and likewise for mode @xmath3 .",

    "[ fig : l4 - 1],width=283 ]    in the following , we will discuss the teleportation of cz - gate using different types of cv cluster states .",
    "as an orientation , let us start by considering a simple case with a linear four - mode cluster @xcite as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : l4 - 1 ] .",

    "the system is then projected onto the state @xmath35 where we have dropped all measured modes and denoted the momentum eigenstates as @xmath36 .",

    "this furnishes the cz - gate teleportation using a cv measurement - based protocol .",
    "it should be noted that here the teleportation has been based on an ideal cluster state , which was prepared from infinitely - squeezed initial modes . for non - ideal cluster states , as already pointed out , the teleported gates always have finite errors .",
    "the analysis above has been based on a schrdinger approach , where one keeps track of the state evolution following the sequence of operations .",
    "although this calculation can in principle be generalized to configurations with more complicated , finite - squeezed resource states , it can become rather cumbersome and error prone when large clusters are involved . in this paper",
    ", we will used instead a heisenberg approach @xcite .",
    "namely , rather than the state vectors , we will keep track of the teleportation process through the time evolution of the quadrature operators .",
    "in particular , by manipulating the quadrature operators judiciously , we will provide an intuitive and efficient way for establishing the measurement sequence and the corrective operations for the teleportation .",
    "this will simplify the calculation significantly and make the analysis for teleportation involving large clusters manageable tasks .",
    "let us demonstrate our approach by the considering the cz - gate teleportation examined above .",
    "in view of the cz - gate transformation ( [ cz_map ] ) , the teleportation that we wish to accomplish through the cluster in fig .  [",
    "fig : l4 - 1 ] amounts to implementing the mapping between the quadrature operators of the output modes @xmath1 , @xmath22 and the input modes @xmath0 , @xmath21 @xmath52 since the input modes @xmath0 , @xmath21 are coupled to the cluster nodes @xmath28 , @xmath29 , respectively , by way of qnd - gates , it follows from ( [ cz_map ] ) that after these couplings , we have @xmath53 where the subscripts @xmath54 or @xmath55 ( i.e. , applicable to the case with input mode @xmath0 and node 1 , or @xmath21 and node 4 ) . to accomplish the mapping ( [ cz_goal ] )",
    ", we note that the output mode @xmath1 is obtained by correcting the final state of node 2 in the teleportation .",
    "thus , in anticipation of @xmath56 after corrective operations , we write the following trivial identity making use of the @xmath57 entry of ( [ in_coup ] ) ( i.e. , setting @xmath54 there and using the entry involving @xmath58 ) @xmath59 where we have grouped the terms that would constitute a noise operator of ( [ noise_can ] ) in reaching the second line . rearranging terms in the final identity above , one can write accordingly @xmath60 here we have written from ( [ q_l4 - 1 ] ) by collecting the image @xmath61 of the intended mapping @xmath56 and the noise operator @xmath62 to the same side of the equation and relegating the rest to the other side , which is redefined as @xmath63 . immediately , we see from this result that by flipping the phase of the position operator @xmath64 for node 2 and then displacing in accordance with the measurement outcome for @xmath57 , one would be able to produce an output mode @xmath1 with @xmath65 that differs from the input quadrature @xmath66 by just the excess noise @xmath67 .",
    "similarly , anticipating @xmath68 subject to corrections , one can make use of the @xmath69 and the @xmath70 entries of ( [ in_coup ] ) and write down the following trivial identity for the momentum operator of node 2 @xmath71 rearranging terms in the same way as in obtaining ( [ qmu_l4 - 1 ] ) from ( [ q_l4 - 1 ] ) , we get from the final identity in the last equation @xmath72 where the terms in the parentheses in the last expression are the noise operators @xmath73 and @xmath74 of ( [ noise_can ] ) . for the other output mode @xmath22 , due to the symmetry between the modes in fig .",
    "[ fig : l4 - 1 ] , one can obtain similar equations by exchanging the indices @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 in ( [ qmu_l4 - 1 ] ) and ( [ pmu_l4 - 1 ] ) , and arrive at @xmath78    as the first line in each equation of the results ( [ qmu_l4 - 1 ] ) , ( [ pmu_l4 - 1 ] ) , and ( [ nu_l4 - 1 ] ) suggests , the cz - gate teleportation here requires measurements for the quadrature operators @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath58 , and @xmath81 .",
    "suppose the measurement results are , respectively , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 , the first lines of ( [ qmu_l4 - 1 ] ) , ( [ pmu_l4 - 1 ] ) , and ( [ nu_l4 - 1 ] ) indicate that the corrective operations necessary for nodes 2 and 3 are exactly those of ( [ corr_l4 - 1 ] ) . for instance , for node @xmath82 the corrective operations ( [ corr_l4 - 1 ] ) induce the following transformations @xmath83 which are exactly the quadrature operators @xmath63 and @xmath84 given by the first lines of ( [ qmu_l4 - 1 ] ) and ( [ pmu_l4 - 1 ] ) , respectively .",
    "it should be noted that with the present finitely squeezed cluster state , the teleported cz - gate is no longer perfect ( cf .",
    "the result ( [ sch ] ) based on the schrdinger approach for an ideal cluster state ) . as one can read off from the second lines of ( [ qmu_l4 - 1 ] ) , ( [ pmu_l4 - 1 ] ) , and",
    "( [ nu_l4 - 1 ] ) , here the quadrature operators for the output modes differ from the ideal results ( i.e. , the image of the mapping in ( [ cz_goal ] ) ) by excess - noise contributions .",
    "the example considered above is a relatively simple one , which , nevertheless , already shows the simplicity of our heisenberg approach in comparison with the schrdinger approach presented earlier . to prepare for more elaborate tasks ,",
    "let us explain in greater details the tricks behind the manipulations of quadrature operators using the case of @xmath63 above .",
    "firstly , as pointed out earlier , one must notice that in the desired mapping ( [ cz_goal ] ) , @xmath63 is constructed out of @xmath64 .",
    "thus , we start by writing @xmath85 where the dots represent identities added from the entries of the input - coupling equation ( [ in_coup ] ) which serve for two purposes : ( i ) they must include the image of @xmath63 for the mapping ( [ cz_goal ] ) , which is @xmath61 here ; ( ii ) they must help  eliminate \" @xmath64 on the right - hand side of ( [ q2_guess ] ) by forming combination of terms that constitutes a nullifier of ( [ noise_can ] ) . clearly , of the @xmath86 and @xmath58 entries of ( [ in_coup ] ) that contain @xmath61 , it is the latter that shall meet both demands ( i ) and ( ii ) here .",
    "it is then easy to arrive at ( [ q_l4 - 1 ] ) , and then ( [ qmu_l4 - 1 ] ) accordingly .",
    "similarly , the construction for @xmath84 in ( [ pmu_l4 - 1 ] ) can be achieved in the same manner , except that two identities from the input - coupling equation ( [ in_coup ] ) and two nullifiers of ( [ noise_can ] ) are invoked in this case .",
    "as it turns out , when applying these tricks to different cluster structures and input - mode couplings , there exist four major categories :    * trivial cases : for which the quadrature manipulations can be carried out easily ; * ft - input cases : for which the quadrature manipulations require fourier transformations over the input modes prior to input couplings ; * ft - output cases : for which the quadrature manipulations require fourier transformations over the output cluster nodes at the output stage ; * ft - cluster cases : for which the quadrature manipulations require fourier transformations over some or all of the cluster nodes prior to input couplings .",
    "it should be noted that these four categories are not mutually exclusive , nor is it unique for the association of any gate - teleportation to these categories .",
    "for instance , we shall now illustrate with a case which can be treated as a mixture of categories ( b ) and ( c ) , or purely that of ( d ) .",
    "let us consider again cz - gate teleportation using a canonical linear four - mode cluster , but now with different input - mode connections as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : l4 - 2 ] .",
    "as one can check through the prescriptions above , the quadrature manipulations in this case are no longer trivial @xcite , and one must consider possible scenarios with categories ( b ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) above .    .",
    "[ fig : l4 - 2],width=283 ]    .",
    "note that the input modes @xmath0 , @xmath21 are fourier transformed prior to their coupling with the cluster nodes . here ,",
    "@xmath87 s in the ovals indicate the outcomes for the corresponding @xmath88-measurements , which are fed forward through classical channels for instructing the appropriate corrective operations to generate the output modes @xmath1 , @xmath22 . [",

    "[ fig : l4 - 2 ] can be achieved through the procedures illustrated with the quantum circuit shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : circ ] .",
    "we see that before coupling the input modes @xmath0 , @xmath21 to the cluster nodes , it is necessary here to apply first the ( inverse ) fourier transformations over the input modes @xmath89 with @xmath90 .",
    "subsequently , the fourier - transformed input modes are coupled to the cluster nodes 2 , 3 via qnd - gates and yield ( cf .",
    "( [ in_coup ] ) ) @xmath91 where the subscripts are @xmath92 or @xmath93 .",
    "like previously , in view of the cz - gate mapping ( [ cz_goal ] ) and that the output mode @xmath1 corresponds to the corrected cluster mode 1 , one can proceed similarly to what was done in ( [ q_l4 - 1 ] ) .",
    "however , things are a little more intricate here .",
    "it transpires that fourier transformations over the output cluster nodes are also necessary when producing the output modes here .",
    "therefore , for node 1 , in place of @xmath94 , we have here @xmath95 when supplemented with corrections .",
    "according to the prescriptions ( i ) and ( ii ) described after ( [ q2_guess ] ) , we can make use of the @xmath96 entry of ( [ in_coup2 ] ) and write @xmath97 the last equality thus suggests @xmath98 with the terms in the parentheses the noise operator @xmath99 .",

    "we find @xmath106 therefore , according to the first lines of the results in ( [ qmu_l4 - 2 ] ) , ( [ pmu_l4 - 2 ] ) , and ( [ nu_l4 - 2 ] ) , the cz - gate teleportation in the setting of fig .  [ fig : l4 - 2 ] requires measurements for the quadrature operators @xmath96 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , and @xmath109 . if the corresponding measurement outcomes are , respectively , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 , the first lines of ( [ qmu_l4 - 2 ] ) , ( [ pmu_l4 - 2 ] ) , and ( [ nu_l4 - 2 ] ) indicate that the corrective operations needed for the cluster modes 1 and 4 are @xmath112 this furnishes the scenario for the cz - gate teleportation using a canonical linear four - mode cluster in the arrangement of fig .",
    "[ fig : l4 - 2 ] .",
    "we see that the quadrature manipulations here have invoked the fourier transformations stipulated for categories ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "as pointed out earlier , one can also treat this case following the scheme of category ( d ) . to avoid distractions",
    ", we relegate this calculation to appendix [ sec : ftc ] .",
    "although the heisenberg approach presented above does seem less systematic than the schrdinger approach .",
    "however , with the limited number of categories listed above , usually a few trial and errors can quickly bring forward the correct teleportation scenarios , and the calculation requires much less algebra than the schrdinger approach does .",
    "this is especially appealing when large clusters are involved in the teleportation process , such as the cases that we will study in the following section .",
    "we have so far been focusing on establishing the procedures for cz - gate teleportation through given cluster designs .",
    "an important issue next is then how one can quantify the quality of the teleported cz - gate .",
    "since cz - gate is capable of entangling its two input modes , it is natural to quantify the quality of the teleported gate through the entanglement in the output modes when non - entangled input modes had been supplied . although entanglement quantification for general cv states remains a major challenge @xcite , the teleported states that will concern us in this work belong entirely to the class of two - mode gaussian states .",
    "their entanglement properties can thus be fully quantified through partial transposition of their density operators , which can also be expressed in relation to their covariance matrices , as we shall now explain @xcite .    for any product state ,",
    "partial transposition of its density operator must result in a _ bona fide _ density operator for a physical state , which can have only positive eigenvalues @xcite .",
    "therefore , if partial transposition of the density operator for a given state yields a density operator with negative eigenvalue(s ) , the original state must be an entangled state .",
    "as it turns out , for two - mode gaussian states this criterion offers not only a necessary , but also a sufficient condition for entanglement @xcite which can also be expressed through the covariance matrix of the state @xcite .",
    "this is because for any gaussian state , all symplectic eigenvalues of its covariance matrix must be greater than or equal to @xmath113 @xcite .",
    "therefore , instead of the positivity of density operators upon partial transposition , one can also examine entanglement through the symplectic eigenvalues of the partially transposed covariance matrices . for a two - mode gaussian state ,",
    "if the partially transposed covariance matrix has symplectic eigenvalues @xmath114 with @xmath115 , it can be shown that one always has @xmath116 @xcite .",
    "the physicality of the partially transposed covariance matrix is therefore determined entirely by the smaller symplectic eigenvalue @xmath117 , and a measure for the degree of entanglement for the state is provided by the logarithmic negativity ( or log - negativity , for short ) @xcite @xmath118 where the function @xmath119 yields the smaller of @xmath120 and @xmath121 . for entangled states , violation of physicality upon partial transposition",
    "is then signaled by @xmath122 , which results in non - zero , positive @xmath123 according to ( [ en ] ) .    in order to calculate the entanglement measure @xmath123 explicitly ,",
    "let us start by denoting the output quadratures of the teleported cz - gate in the form of a column vector @xmath124 the covariance matrix for the output modes @xmath1 , @xmath22 is then a real , symmetric @xmath125 matrix with the elements @xcite @xmath126 where @xmath127 , @xmath128 , and @xmath129 is the anticommutator .",
    "since we are using the heisenberg picture for the time evolution , the expectation values here are evaluated with respect to the initial state of the system ( i.e. , that of the input modes and the initial cluster modes ) .",
    "as it emerges , the covariance matrices for the output modes @xmath1 , @xmath22 for all cases considered in this work share a common  x - form \" @xmath130 with , according to ( [ vkl ] ) , @xmath131 where @xmath132 , and @xmath133 in the expression for @xmath134 . to find partial transposition for the covariance matrix ( [ v_x ] )",

    "[ fig : en](a ) ) .    to understand the reason for the differences between these results ,",
    "let us recall that the entanglement between the output modes is determined solely from the smaller symplectic eigenvalue @xmath117 in ( [ symp ] ) for the partially transposed covariance matrix of the output modes , which , in turn , is governed by the quadrature correlators ( [ abc ] ) . from the results ( [ abc_nr ] ) and ( [ abc_nr_lo ] ) , we find that for both canonical and linear - optical cluster states , the correlators @xmath300 and @xmath134 for the teleported states are entirely independent of the number of rails @xmath182 . therefore , the @xmath182-dependence of @xmath117 ( and hence , of the log - negativity @xmath123 ) is entirely due to the quadrature correlator @xmath301 .",
    "since we have @xmath302 always in both ( [ abc_nr ] ) and ( [ abc_nr_lo ] ) , according to ( [ symp ] ) and ( [ en2 ] ) , the entanglement thus changes monotonically with @xmath301 when @xmath300 and @xmath134 stay fixed . in the case of canonical cluster states",

    "thus , with increasing number of rails , the log - negativity ( [ en_nr ] ) would increase steadily and tend to a limit with non - vanishing entanglement for the whole range of squeezing parameter @xmath145 .",
    "in contrast , for the linear - optical cluster states , the multi - rail noise reduction can bring down @xmath301 at best to the value of the linear four - mode ( [ abc_l4_lo ] ) even with @xmath303 . the entanglement ( [ en_nr_lo ] )",
    "is thus always bounded above by @xmath304 of ( [ en_l4_lo ] ) , which always has a finite range of squeezing levels with zero entanglement .",
    "in summary , we have examined in this paper the teleportation of a cz - gate through measurement - based scheme in the cv regime , where two classes of resource states have been considered : the canonical cluster states fabricated through qnd - gates and the linear - optical cluster states from linear - optical networks .",
    "we study the entanglement properties of the teleported output modes and examine the performance of a multi - rail design that aims to reduce the excess noise in the teleported gate . for both classes of resource states , we find analytical expressions for the entanglement and obtain its scaling with the number of rails in the multi - rail design . in the process of this analysis , we also discuss in detail the noise - reduction mechanism underlying the multi - rail approach to measurement - based teleportation . and the last but not the least , in order to facilitate the analysis for teleportation with multi - rail clusters , we have developed an operator - manipulation trick that can help establish efficiently the measurement sequence and the corrective operations for the cz - gate teleportation .    although the quadrature - manipulation trick has been applied in this work only to cz - gate teleportation , it is equally applicable to teleportation of other gates in measurement - based quantum information processing .",
    "for instance , for single - qumode gates that effect translation , rotation , and squeezing of a single qumode , one can apply the same trick and obtain the corresponding measurement sequence and corrective operations in the measurement - base teleportation @xcite .",
    "finally , in closing we note that despite the lower quality of the teleported cz - gate through linear - optical cluster states in comparison with that via canonical cluster states in our results , it can be possible to change this situation by exploiting an additional degree of freedom in constructing the @xmath210-matrix for the linear - optical cluster . since the geometric constraints resulting from ( [ geo_con ] ) consist of inner products of the @xmath213 s ( i.e. , the @xmath218 of ( [ gkl ] ) ) , they are invariant under orthogonal transformations . in other words , for any choice of the @xmath213 s one can always apply orthogonal transformations over these vectors without violating the geometric constraints .",
    "this extra degree of freedom thus provides means of optimization for constructing the @xmath210-matrix according to the cost function one choose to consider @xcite . since the number of nodes can be quite large in our calculation , such optimization can be challenging . also , it is possible to improve the quality of the teleported gates by introducing appropriate gain factors in the feedback signals @xcite .",

    "the result is thus the same as that of ( [ dkdk_sum3 ] ) . for the fourth term in ( [ dkdk_sum1 ] ) , again exchanging the order of summations there and using ( [ unit_ab ] ) , we can write @xmath357 exchanging again the order of summations in the second term above , we get @xmath358 using the results ( [ dkdk_sum3 ] ) and ( [ dkdk_sum5 ] ) for the respective terms in ( [ dkdk_sum1 ] ) , we thus find that the summations there become @xmath359 where we have used the first equation of ( [ unit_ab ] ) in dealing with the second summation on the left - hand side .",
    "for the first summation in ( [ dkdk_sum_ans ] ) , it yields exactly the @xmath360 defined in ( [ mkl ] ) ; namely , when @xmath269 , it yields the number of nodes connected to both node @xmath3 and node @xmath7 , and when @xmath361 , the number of nodes connected to node @xmath3 . utilizing ( [ mom_sqz ] ) and",
    "the result ( [ dkdk_sum_ans ] ) in ( [ dkdk ] ) , we arrive finally at the identity ( [ miracle ] ) .    in the light of the result ( [ miracle ] )",
    ", we will now demonstrate how noise reduction in the multi - rail teleportation can be optimized through a symmetric arrangement among the rails of a linear - optical cluster .",
    "in other words , we will show that the coefficient @xmath287 in the expressions for @xmath63 and @xmath166 in ( [ qp_nr_lo ] ) serves to minimize the excess noise in these output quadratures .",
    "similar to ( [ q_gen_nr ] ) for canonical clusters , for cz - gate teleportation through an @xmath182-rail linear - optical cluster , one can have @xmath63 and @xmath166 in the generic expressions @xmath362 where @xmath192 or @xmath193 , and the range of summation for @xmath3 is the same as in ( [ qp_nr_lo ] ) .",
    "note that here we have kept the minus sign in front of the summation for consistency with its two - rail counterpart ( [ qq_2r_lo ] ) .",
    "as before , the coefficients @xmath194 in ( [ q_gen_nr_lo ] ) must satisfy the condition @xmath195 .",
    "now that the noise operators @xmath20 for linear - optical clusters are no longer independent from each other , the excess noise in the teleported @xmath196 becomes here @xmath363 .",
    "for a uniformly squeezed linear - optical cluster state , similar to ( [ qmu2_sum_nr_lo ] ) , we can write the excess noise as @xmath364 where we have applied ( [ miracle ] ) in obtaining the last expression . since @xmath365",
    ", it follows that @xmath366 we can therefore reduce the expression ( [ noise_gen_lo ] ) for the excess noise to the form @xmath367 it is now clear that the minimization of the excess noise here is completely identical to that for the case of canonical clusters ( see below ( [ q_gen_nr ] ) ) .",
    "namely , it corresponds to locating the point over the @xmath182-dimensional hyperplane @xmath200 that is closest to the origin . obviously , the result is the symmetric point @xmath201 for all @xmath3 , which means that the excess noise for @xmath196 in ( [ q_gen_nr_lo ] ) can be minimized if it is distributed equally over each of the multi - rails .",
