    "depletion of sites in two - dimensional magnetic systems would , therefore , ultimately destroy the long - range order ( lro ) in the ground state by lowering dimensionality .",

    "one natural question to ask is whether depletion would , via reducing diagonal lro , allow the possibility of coexistence of the off - diagonal and diagonal lros .",

    "the af is represented as @xmath113 and the fm can be expressed as superfluids of @xmath56 in the background of @xmath53 or @xmath114 .",
    "the agreement between qmc and mf results is remarkable , given the simplicity of the trimer - basis mf theory .",
    "while a triple laser beam design in cold atom gases @xcite has been proposed to simulate a kagome lattice , whether similar techniques may apply to the 1/4 depleted square lattice is worthy to pursue .",
