    "eliminating the one - loop divergences allows the cutoff of the theory to be pushed to about @xmath3 tev , however this could be an optimistic estimate , see ref .",
    "the predicted particles are likely to be produced and observed in future colliders , especially the lhc .",
    "the presence of new particles also creates tension with the electroweak precision tests ( ewpts ) .",
    "to avoid fine - tuning of more than 10% , heavy fermions and gauge bosons with masses less than about 2 tev and 5 tev , respectively , should be introduced to cancel the top - loop and gauge - boson - loop divergences",
    ". however , the ewpts do not indicate presence of new particles in a few tev range if their couplings are generic .",
    "a successful model has to reconcile the tension between naturalness and the ewpts .",
    "constraints on little higgs models from the ewpts have been considered for different models @xcite . in this article",
    ", we provide a more up - to - date and extensive analysis employing the effective theory approach we described in ref .  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we analyzed all flavor - independent and cp - conserving dimension - six operators written in terms of the sm fields that are tightly constrained by ewpts .",
    "we calculated the corrections from these operators to the electroweak precision observables ( ewpos ) .",
    "the result is the @xmath4 distribution in terms of the coefficients of these operators . in an extension of the sm one can integrate out the heavy fields and obtain the coefficients of the effective operators in terms of parameters in the model . substituting the coefficients in the @xmath4 distribution , one immediately obtains global constraints from all ewpos .",
    "as we will discuss , this procedure fits most little higgs models . we will only consider the tree - level diagrams when we integrate out the heavy fields .",
    "loop diagrams involving heavy fields are usually suppressed by both the masses of the heavy fields and the loop factor .",
    "thus , loop corrections from particles with tev - scale masses are usually small and do not significantly affect the constraints we obtain . for the discussion of the fine - tuning problem , we will focus on the largest one - loop corrections to the higgs mass arising from the top quark and the gauge bosons .",
    "alternative estimates of fine - tuning associated with the sensitivity of the higgs mass to all underlying parameters of little higgs models are presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this article",
    ", we focus on the following little higgs models : the @xmath0 or the littlest higgs model @xcite , the @xmath1 @xcite model , and the models with the @xmath5 gauge group @xcite , as well as their variations . for simplicity ,",

    ". the corrections were combined with known experimental values and the sm predictions to obtain the total @xmath4 distribution @xmath26 where @xmath27 are values of @xmath25 that minimize @xmath4 . in ref .",

    "( [ chi2 ] ) in terms of parameters of a model allows us to immediately obtain constraints on the model without having to compute ewpos .",
    "before we list and analyze in detail the coefficients of effective operators in the little higgs models , we briefly discuss how the effective operators are generated and what interesting features these models have .",
    "there are three kinds of heavy fields in these models : gauge bosons , scalars and fermions .",
    "we first discuss the effects of the heavy gauge bosons .",
    "the @xmath6 and @xmath7 models share the same gauge structure : @xmath29 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "the gauge group is broken to the diagonal @xmath30 which is identified with the sm gauge group .",
    "thus half of the gauge bosons get masses and the other half remain massless until electroweak symmetry breaking takes place .",
    "the heavy gauge bosons include a triplet @xmath31 and a singlet @xmath32 , which couple to both the sm higgs and fermions .",
    "the exchange of @xmath31 generates the triplet coupling operators @xmath33 , @xmath34 , while the exchange of @xmath32 generates @xmath18 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 . the gauge sector in the @xmath8 model is quite different : a gauged @xmath5 is broken to the sm @xmath30 , leaving 5 heavy gauge bosons .",
    "one of them behaves like the @xmath32 and also induces @xmath18 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the others decouple from the light fields .",
    "there are no @xmath14 triplet operators generated in this case .",
    "now we turn to discussing the scalars in the models . in the low - energy spectra ,",
    "the @xmath6 and @xmath8 models contain one higgs doublet and the @xmath7 model contains two higgs doublets .",
    "the number of light higgs doublets is irrelevant in our analysis since only the higgs vev matters . besides the doublet",
    ", the @xmath6 model also contains a heavy triplet scalar . when integrated out , the triplet generates the @xmath18 operator .",
    "in addition , there are heavy singlets in all the three models , but integrating them out does not generate dimension - six operators relevant to ewpts .    turning to fermions ,",
    "heavy fermions are needed to cancel the quadratic divergence from the top loop . however , there are often multiple choices that insure the cancelation . in the @xmath6 little higgs model @xcite , a pair of vector - like heavy fermions",
    "is added to the sm fields .",
    "the right - handed heavy fermion mixes with the right - handed top quark so that the couplings between the top quark and the sm gauge bosons are modified .",
    "the loop divergences from the light two generations do not introduce fine - tuning for a cutoff as low as @xmath3 tev because the corresponding yukawa couplings are small .",
    "thus one does not introduce extra fermions to cancel the divergences for the light two generations .",
    "therefore , fermion couplings in this model are flavor - dependent .",
    "however , since only the top quark mixes with the heavy fermion and no ewpo involves the top quark in the final or initial states , this flavor - dependent effect is not relevant .",
    "of course , if we added fermions that mix with the first two generations as well , we could generate flavor - dependent operators that do affect ewpts .",
    "such operators can introduce fcncs and would be severely constrained . a detailed analysis for this case",
    "is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we will assume approximate flavor - independence in our analysis .",
    "the fermion sector in the @xmath7 model is similar to the @xmath6 model contains an example . ] , while the @xmath8 model merits a few more comments .",
    "because the gauge group contains an @xmath8 , every sm fermion doublet must be combined with an extra fermion to complete an @xmath8 triplet .",
    "thus unlike the @xmath6 or the @xmath7 model , heavy fermions have to be added to all generations .",
    "if we assign fermions the same quantum numbers for the three generations and impose the constraint of small fcncs , we will obtain flavor - independent operators @xmath37 and @xmath38 by integrating out the heavy fermions . this is a result of mixing between the sm and the heavy fermions .",
    "this mixing modifies the gauge couplings of the sm fermions .",
    "besides the operators obtained by integrating out the heavy fields , there exist dimension - six operators arising from expanding the kinetic term of the nonlinear sigma field to higher orders .",
    "it turns out that the dimension - six operators obtained this way do not affect ewpts in the @xmath6 and @xmath8 models , while in the @xmath7 model , there are contributions to the @xmath18 operator when @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the ratio of the two higgs vevs .",
    "detailed description of the @xmath6 little higgs model can be found elsewhere .",

    "the coefficient @xmath69 is not determined in the low - energy theory since it arises from quadratically - divergent contributions . when integrated out , the triplet generates both dimension - four and dimension - six operators .",

    "we will treat @xmath73 as a free parameter that is subject to the constraint ( [ lambdarelation ] ) .",
    "note that if we did not integrate out the triplet , after ewsb the triplet would obtain a vev that breaks the custodial symmetry : @xmath74 this is another way to understand the contribution to @xmath18 .",

    "however , the mass of the heavy gauge doublet @xmath31 is determined uniquely in terms of @xmath54 : @xmath175 .",
    "given the ratio @xmath174 , we can obtain the bound on @xmath98 .",
    "[ fig : su31 ] shows 95% cl bounds on @xmath98 as a function of @xmath174 .",
    "since the contribution to the higgs mass from @xmath31 is not significant until @xmath176 tev the fine - tuning problem is not severe .",
    "depending on the choice of the yukawa matrices in the quark sector corresponding to the two possibilities in eq .",
    "( [ su3hquark ] ) , the least severe constraints are either when @xmath177 for hierarchical @xmath155 , or when @xmath178 for hierarchical @xmath161 .     as a function of @xmath174 in the @xmath8 models .",
    "left : @xmath155 is hierarchical and @xmath161 is proportional to identity matrix ; right : @xmath161 is hierarchical and @xmath155 is proportional to identity matrix . ]",
    "the @xmath5 gauge sector can be embedded in different global groups .",
    "the above discussion makes use of the setup of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the coset space is @xmath179 ^ 2 $ ] . but",
    "the constraints also apply to the model constructed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the coset space is @xmath180 .",
    "the model is also extended to an @xmath181 ^ 4 $ ] model with an @xmath182 group gauged in ref .",
    "these variations mainly stem from theoretical considerations , rather than the need to avoid the experimental constraints .",
    "using effective field theory approach , we have obtained constraints from ewpts for three types of little higgs models : @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath5 .",
    "we have carried out the analysis by first integrating out the heavy fields to obtain the effective operators , and then calculating the constraints from the bounds on the linear combinations of the coefficients of these operators .",
    "we gained two main benefits from following through this procedure .",
    "first , expressing the corrections in terms of effective operators allowed us to treat the corrections in a model - independent way , which we have done in ref .",
    "thus we can simply use the results in ref .",
    "@xcite once we acquire the coefficients of the operators . for the @xmath6 and @xmath7 models ,",
    "we use the heavy top mass @xmath97 and the heavy triplet gauge boson mass @xmath98 to illustrate the bounds .",
    "we show that there exist regions in the parameter space where the bounds on @xmath97 and @xmath98 are less than 2 tev and 6 tev respectively . in these regions ,",
    "no significant fine - tuning is required to yield light higgs bosons .",
    "these regions are in the vicinity of the points where the two @xmath75 gauge sectors in the models have the same coupling strength and fermions are charged identically under the two @xmath75 s .",
    "away from this limit , the bounds are usually much tighter .",
    "in particular , for the cases that fermions are charged under only one @xmath75 , we obtain the bounds @xmath183 tev at 95% cl for all of the parameter space , requiring fine - tuning of more than 1% . for the @xmath8 model",
    ", @xmath97 remains a free parameter for a given @xmath54 .",
    "thus we only obtain the bounds for @xmath98 . at 95% cl , @xmath184 tev .",
    "the associated fine - tuning is not significant in this case .",
    "it is interesting that lep2 results are very useful .",
    "the models induce many 4-fermion operators which lep2 observables are sensitive to .",
    "the lep2 results were not included in most of previous papers considering ewpt constraints on littlest higgs models . as a comparison",
    ", we have checked our results for the @xmath6 and @xmath7 models against ref .",
    "we agree with the results in the two references when we use the same set of observables , which contain most precisely measured lep1 and some low - energy observables .",
    "after we include the lep2 observables , the bounds become significantly tighter .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors also obtain constraints on little higgs models from ewpts including lep2 data . technically , our approach is more general .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite have to assume that the models are approximately universal and all corrections can be condensed in four oblique parameters .",
    "in particular , the heavy gauge bosons should couple to fermions `` universally '' , which means that the fermion currents that couple to the heavy gauge bosons are proportional to the sm current .",
    "this is not true for the @xmath8 model , so the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite have to neglect some of the ewpos .",
    "in addition , they do not discuss the effects of the heavy fermions in the @xmath8 model , which are not universal either . in the @xmath6 and @xmath7 models",
    "we have analyzed , the fermion charge assignments do yield universal couplings between fermions and gauge bosons . thus their method apply as well . however , one could obtain non - universal couplings from more general fermion assignments , which would make their method inapplicable , but would not introduce any difficulty in our approach . in @xcite only the simplest fermion assignments made in the original papers were considered , while we are interested in the variations which relax the electroweak constraints .",
    "the second advantage of the effective theory approach is that it makes it transparent how to modify the models to avoid tight constraints . from the compact but complete lists of operator coefficients in the @xmath6 and @xmath7 models ,",
    "we easily deduce two regions of parameter space that lead to suppressions of the corrections .",
    "one of the regions for the @xmath7 model case is discussed and termed `` near - oblique '' limit in ref .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the other limit has been utilized in a model with enlarged gauge sector and an approximate custodial symmetry . with their weaker constraints ,",
    "such model variations are interesting since they address the fine - tuning problem better than the original models . from experimental point of view , new particles are light enough to be observable at the lhc only if there is no significant fine tuning .",
