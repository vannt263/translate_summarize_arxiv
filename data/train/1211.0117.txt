    "the convective overshooting in the stellar interior is caused by turbulent flows moving across the standard convective boundary , which is defined by the schwarzchild criterion ( i.e. , @xmath0 ) , into the dynamically stable region .",
    "this process leads to chemical mixing in the overshooting region . based on the framework of non - local mixing length theories ,",
    "the overshooting region is considered as a fully mixed region with a length @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the local pressure scale height and @xmath3 is a parameter .",
    "but the helioseismic investigation has pointed out that only turbulent convection models ( tcms ) can properly describe the convective overshooting @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is a tendency to apply tcms to the convective overshooting in the stellar interior .",
    "tcms are non - local convection theories based on the hydrodynamic equations and modeling assumptions @xcite . using the turbulent velocity determined by tcms",
    ", one can deal with the overshooting mixing as a diffusion process which results in incomplete mixing in the overshooting region .",
    "@xcite have applied the tcm @xcite and the incomplete overshooting mixing to the downward overshooting region of the solar convective envelope and found that the sound speed profile is significant improved . applying the same method to",
    "the stellar model also shows improvements on the li depletion in open cluster , thus the tcm has been considered to be generally applicable to the downward overshooting region of the convective envelope for low - mass stars @xcite .",
    "it is interesting whether the incomplete overshooting mixing based on the tcm is suitable for the convective core overshooting .",
    "the convective core overshooting refreshes hydrogen in the nuclear burning core , deeply affecting the evolutions of massive and intermediate - mass stars .",
    "the evolution track of a star with a convective core in the hertzsprung - russel diagram is sensitive to the efficiency of the core overshooting mixing .",
    "accordingly , it is a direct and efficient way of studying the core overshooting mixing by calibrating the radius and effective temperature of the stellar model to fit the observations .",
    "double lined detached eclipsing binary systems in the main sequence phase are the best candidates to do that , because the mass , radius , and temperature of each component of a binary system can be obtained by observations . @xcite and",
    "@xcite have studied the core overshooting based on a set of double lined eclipsing binary systems and found that the fully mixed overshooting region with a length @xmath4 is the overall best .",
    "recently , @xcite have observed the double lined detached eclipsing binary system hy vir and acquired very accurate masses and radii of the two components from the analysis of new light curves and radial velocity curves .",
    "the mass of each component of hy vir is @xcite : @xmath5 and @xmath6 for the primary and the secondary , respectively .",
    "these results indicate that both the primary and the secondary have the convective core .",
    "the accurate data make hy vir a good candidate to study the core overshooting mixing described by the tcm .    in this paper ,",
    "i investigate the suitable parameter of the overshooting mixing via calibrating the effective temperatures and the radii of the stellar models of hy vir to fit the observations , and study the effects of the application of the tcm @xcite .",
    "the method of applying the tcm in the stellar models is described in section 2 .",
    "the calibrated results for the system of hy vir are shown in section 3 .",
    "the properties of the stellar models based on the tcm are discussed in section 4 .",
    "the conclusions and discussions are presented in section 5 .",
    "in the traditional way , the overshooting is assumed to result in the completely mixed region with the length being proportional to the local pressure scale height .",
    "this description of the overshooting is based on the framework of the ballistic overshoot models , which are non - local mixing length theories(e.g . , @xcite ) .",
    "those non - local mixing length theories result in a steep temperature gradient profile at the boundary of the overshooting region ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the recent helioseismic investigation has found that the required temperature gradient in the overshooting region is not in agreement with the framework of the ballistic overshoot models , but suggests that only tcms are capable of providing required temperature gradient profile @xcite .",
    "according to the hydrodynamic equations , the chemical mixing is determined by the turbulent velocity - turbulent concentration correlation @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , there is a lack of the knowledge for such a correlation in the astrophysical case . besides the fully mixing",
    ", the incomplete mixing described by the diffusion is at present popular on dealing with the overshooting mixing ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the diffusion description , the turbulent velocity in the overshooting region",
    "is required to calculate the diffusion coefficient .",
    "the turbulent velocity is usually set as an exponentially decreasing function in the overshooting region ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and can be calculated by defining the exponential index and the initial value ( i.e. , the turbulent velocity at the convective boundary ) .",
    "an option to determine the initial value is extrapolation from the mixing length theory ( mlt ) ( e.g. , @xcite ) . however , the mlt is a local theory , while the non - local effect dominates near the convective boundary .",
    "another option is to obtain the turbulent velocity by solving the tcm , which is non - local turbulent convection theory .",
    "the diffusion coefficient is proportional to the characteristic length of mixing and the characteristic velocity : @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the characteristic length , @xmath9 is the characteristic turbulent velocity , and @xmath10 is a diffusion parameter .",
    "@xmath9 is assumed as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the turbulent kinetic energy .",
    "the diffusion parameter multiplying the characteristic length is assumed to be proportional to @xmath2 , i.e. , @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , the diffusion coefficient of the overshooting mixing is assumed as follow : @xmath14 the characteristic length of mixing @xmath8 is between the kolmogorov scale and the largest eddy scale . in order to cause incomplete mixing in the overshooting region in a time scale comparable with the evolutionary time scale ,",
    "the characteristic length of mixing should be much smaller than the largest eddy scale @xcite . by analogy with eq.(27 ) & ( 29 ) in @xcite , @xmath15 in eq.(1 ) should be on the magnitude order of @xmath16 , which is suitable for the downward overshooting region of the convective envelope in low - mass star @xcite .",
    "the diffusion equation of the hydrogen abundance in the stellar interior is as follow : @xmath17\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath18 means the time derivative of hydrogen abundance caused by only convective and overshooting mixing , and @xmath19 is the diffusion coefficient due to convection or overshooting : @xmath20where @xmath21 is diffusion coefficient in the convection zone . in order to ensure fully mixing in the convection zone , large @xmath21",
    "is required so that @xmath22 is adopted in the calculations .",
    "it is not difficult to solve eq.(2 ) by using the tridiagonal matrix algorithm .",
    "the stellar evolution code , which is originally developed by @xcite and kozlowski and updated by sienkiewicz , is used to model the components of hy vir . the opal equation of state @xcite , the opal opacity tables for high temperatures @xcite , and the alexander s opacity tables for low temperatures @xcite are used .",

    ", i solve the complete structure equations comprising the stellar structure equations and the tcm @xcite equations . in the stellar structure equations",
    ", the temperature gradient @xmath23 is calculated as follow : @xmath24where @xmath25 is the turbulent heat flux determined by the tcm .",
    "the evolution code has been modified to take into account the overshooting mixing . in the original code ,",
    "the evolution of chemical composition in the stellar interior and the stellar structure are calculated separately . on each time step ,",
    "the evolution of chemical composition ( nuclear burning , complete mixing in the convection zone ) is calculated before solving the stellar structure equations . in the present work ,",
    "the procedure of solving eq.(2 ) is performed at first .",
    "after the evolution of chemical composition ( nuclear burning and the convective and overshooting mixing ) during the time step being accomplished , the complete structure equations are solved , and the stellar structure variables and the turbulent variables are updated .",
    "the scheme of solving the complete structure equations is as follows :    \\(1 ) solve the tcm equations based on the current stellar structure variables ( e.g. , @xmath26 ) .",
    "calculate the temperature gradient @xmath23 at all mesh points according to eq.(4 ) .",
    "\\(2 ) solve the localized tcm in which the non - local terms ( i.e. , the diffusion terms ) are ignored .",

    "it is not difficult to understand that the turbulent variables and the stellar structure variables are consistent with each other when @xmath38 , thus the scheme is reasonable .",
    "the scheme is an improved version of the previous one ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is found that this scheme is more stable and more efficient than the previous one .",
    "there are seven parameters in the tcm @xcite : @xmath39 are dissipation parameters of turbulent kinetic energy @xmath12 , turbulent heat flux @xmath25 , and turbulent temperature fluctuation @xmath40 , respectively ; @xmath41 are diffusion parameters of @xmath12 , @xmath25 and @xmath40 , respectively ; @xmath42 is the parameter of return to isotropy term .",

    "table 3 compares the properties of the turbulent variables in the high @xmath43 overshooting region with the results of the theoretical analysis @xcite .",
    "it is found that the numerical results are in agreement with the theoretical analysis .",
    "the high @xmath43 overshooting region extends to the location of @xmath47 and then becomes the low @xmath43 one .    in the low @xmath43 overshooting region",
    ", the thermal dissipation dominates , thus the turbulent variables @xmath12 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 decrease super - exponentially and @xmath48 decreases to zero according to the properties of the tcm equations @xcite . those properties can be found in fig.5 .",
    "the overshooting is finally cut - off in the region @xmath49 . according to the definition of @xmath43 , @xmath50 ,",
    "thus @xmath43 exponentially decreases in the overshooting region with the index @xmath51 . as a consequence , the distance ( in @xmath2 ) from the convective boundary to the cut - off location depends on @xmath52 .",
    "larger @xmath52 leads to longer distance to the cut - off location .",
    "this can be found in figs.(4 - 6 ) by comparing @xmath52 and the the distance from the convective boundary to the cut - off location of each overshooting region .    .",
    "the stellar model is the zams of the primary .",
    "symbols are the same as fig.5 . ]",
    "there is a thin overshooting region laying between two convective shells , which are caused by h and heii ionization respectively , in the zams stellar model of the primary as shown in fig.5a .",
    "the convective shells merge together during the stellar evolution , thus this overshooting region disappears in the @xmath53 stellar model .",
    "the details of the turbulent variables in the thin overshooting region are shown in fig.7 .",
    "the turbulent velocity @xmath54 in the region is larger than in the convective core , so that two convective envelopes can be considered to be dynamically connected .",
    "however , the minimum of the ratio of the convective flux to the total flux is about @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the convective flux .",
    "moreover , @xmath57 in the two convective shells and the overshooting region .",
    "these conditions prevent the turbulent heat transport between two convective shells .",
    "the convective envelopes can therefore be considered to be thermally disconnected .",
    "in this work , the turbulent convection model ( tcm ) is involved in the stellar structure and evolution in order to study the convective core overshooting in the stellar models of eclipsing binary star hy vir . using new accurate observations ,",
    "i calibrate the stellar effective temperatures and radii of two components of hy vir , and then obtain the required overshooting mixing parameter @xmath58 .",
    "the turbulent parameters ( i.e. , the tcm parameters and the overshooting mixing parameter @xmath15 ) , which is proper for the downward overshooting region of the convective envelope in low - mass stars , can reproduce the observational radii and effective temperatures of the two components of hy vir .",
    "it indicates that the diffusive overshooting mixing based on the turbulent velocity described by the tcm can also be applied to the core overshooting .",
    "this result encourages us to apply the tcm to the convective overshooting .",
    "the diffusive overshooting mixing causes a continuous profile of the hydrogen abundance .",
    "the e - folding length of the region , in which the chemical abundance changes due to the overshooting mixing , can be estimated by using eq.(11 ) .",
    "it is found that the e - folding length increases during the stellar evolution .",
    "the overshooting region can be classified into two kinds : the high @xmath43 overshooting region in which @xmath59 and the low @xmath43 one .",
    "the properties of the high @xmath43 overshooting region are in agreement with the theoretical analysis @xcite . the turbulent variables ( turbulent kinetic energy @xmath12 , turbulent heat flux @xmath60 and turbulent temperature fluctuation @xmath45 ) decrease exponentially in the high @xmath43 overshooting region .",
    "the properties of the low @xmath43 overshooting region are very different from the high @xmath43 one . in the low @xmath43 overshooting region ,",
    "the turbulent variables decrease super - exponentially and are finally cut - off .",
    "the diffusions of @xmath60 and @xmath45 are not taken into account in this paper because of some problems of numerical calculations .",
    "however , @xmath15 of the calibrated stellar models for hy vir should not change significantly if those diffusions are present .",
    "those diffusions may affect the calibrated results mainly on two ways : ( i ) modifying the turbulent heat flux and ( ii ) affecting the core overshooting mixing which plays an important role on the stellar evolution .",
    "although those diffusions can redistribute @xmath60 in the stellar interior , they shouldt significantly change the integral value of @xmath60 .",
    "the effective temperature of stellar models should be insensitive to those diffusions .",
    "the diffusion of @xmath60 is ignorable in the region of @xmath61 @xcite , thus it does nt affect the properties of the core convection and overshooting .",
    "the diffusion of @xmath45 can affects the exponential index of the turbulent kinetic energy @xmath62 .",
    "the solar value for the diffusion of @xmath45 is small that @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "it should modify the turbulent properties in the core overshooting region slightly .",
    "@xmath15 of the calibrated model should change a little if the diffusion of @xmath45 is present . however , since the relative standard error of @xmath15 is about 60% , the solar value @xmath64 should also reproduce the required radius and effective temperature of hy vir in @xmath65 .    in other treatments of overshooting with incomplete mixing mentioned in section 2.1 ,",
    "there is no information on how the temperature gradient profile is modified near the convective boundary .",
    "the helioseismic investigation by @xcite ca nt judge which of them is suitable for the solar case .",
    "however , the mixing can affect the sound speed profile .",
    "it is well known that , in the standard solar model , there is a bump of sound speed difference below the solar convection zone . in order to eliminate the bump ,",
    "the proper diffusion coefficient at the base of the solar convection zone is on the magnitude order of @xmath66 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the mixing should be effective in about @xmath67 , which is the width of the bump , below the base of convection zone .",
    "the helioseismic inversion requires the diffusion coefficient to satisfy those conditions in the solar case .",
