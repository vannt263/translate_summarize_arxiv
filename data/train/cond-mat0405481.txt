    "an important qualitative deviation of the full bdg solution from the uniform-@xmath7 results comes at high fields near @xmath102 . the critical field for the full bdg solution ( solid circles in fig .",

    ", we consider the ginzburg - landau theory with an order parameter of zero total angular momentum , as is usual in the literature  @xcite ; ( see appendix  [ app : glt ] ) .",
    "the order parameter couples to the external field only through @xmath130 and does not have any information about the angular momenta of constituent electrons in cooper pairs .",

    "when the @xmath134-term is included on top of the orbital coupling , its effect becomes significantly smaller than in eq .",

    "since the level spacing of the transverse modes is inversely proportional to the effective mass ( @xmath141 ) , the effect of the discrete levels will be strong for systems of small effective mass or low transition temperature .",
    "[ fig : delr20 ] shows the spatial variation of the order parameter in this regime .",
    "a close examination reveals two characteristic length scales in @xmath53 .",
    "the shorter length scale ( with rapid oscillations more apparent at large radius ) is given in terms of the fermi velocity , i.e. , @xmath142 .",
    "as the fermi velocity ( or the carrier density ) grows , @xmath41 oscillates more rapidly",
    ".    apart from the structures corresponding to the fermi wavelength , there are more interesting and slowly varying spatial modulations , particularly near @xmath124 . although these modulations also appear for large diameters ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : delr ] ) , their relative importance grows in the smaller diameter wires .",
    "this spatial structure arises from the small number of transverse modes within the energy window @xmath56 $ ] . as can be seen from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : gap ] , [ app : gap ] ) , the energy levels close to the fermi energy contribute strongly to the order parameter @xmath7 .",
    "since the density of states is peaked at the transverse energy levels ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : dos ] ) , the resulting order parameter has larger amplitude for the states with @xmath143 , @xmath144 and displays the spatial characteristics of those transverse modes . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : mesh ] , the states within the @xmath27-space shell of area @xmath145 contribute most strongly to the order parameter .",
    "although we have used sharp energy cut - offs at @xmath57 , they are not expected to impose a significant quantitative change because the weight factor in the gap equation , @xmath146 ( cf .",
    "( [ app : uv ] ) ) , is small near the cutoff .",
    "the ratio of @xmath147 for @xmath148 to @xmath149 is approximately @xmath150 .",
    "the shape of the order parameter is determined by which states happen to fall into the @xmath27-space shell .",
