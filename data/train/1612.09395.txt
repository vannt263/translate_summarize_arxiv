    "the measurement of sfrs in galaxies can give clues to the physical processes in shaping galaxies .",
    "as the improvements of new observations over the past decades , large - scale sfrs can be traced by many indicators at different wavelengths , ranging from the x - ray to the radio , and using both continuum and nebular recombination emission lines ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for reviews ) .    among many sfr indicators , the ultraviolet ( uv ) continuum of galaxies",
    "is directly tied to the photospheric emission of young stellar population formed over the past 100 myr , and hence serves as one of the most powerful probes of sfrs in galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    ". however , the main disadvantage of this tracer is its sensitivity to dust attenuation .",
    "nebular recombination lines such as h@xmath1 trace ionized gas surrounding stars with masses of @xmath4 10@xmath5 and lifetimes of @xmath2 3 - 10myr , and represent a nearly instantaneous measure of the sfr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "they are also affected by active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and metallicity @xcite .",
    "the starlight absorbed at uv and optical wavebands by the interstellar dust is re - emitted in infrared ( ir ) , so the ir emission can be used as a sensitive tracer of the young stellar population formed over a period of 0@xmath6100 myr @xcite .",
    "the major systematic errors of ir based sfrs come from the missing unattenuated starlight and dust heating from evolved stars . besides that ,",
    "composite multiwavelength tracers are applied to construct dust - corrected sfrs , such as the combination of uv and ir observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    ".    apart from the above tracers , the _ u_-band ( @xmath7 355 nm ) luminosity of a galaxy is dominated by young stars of ages @xmath4 1 gyr , and has been proved to be a reasonable star - formation indicator @xcite .",
    "although the _ u_-band traces more evolved stars than other tracers , its advantages over other tracers are that ( 1 ) high - quality images of _ u_-band are easier to be obtained from ground - based telescopes , ( 2 ) large sky surveys can accumulate much more _",

    "<S> the ir - corrected _ u _ luminosities are derived based on the correlations between the attenuation of _ u_-band luminosities and _ wise _ 12 ( or 22 ) @xmath3 m luminosities , and then calibrated with the balmer - corrected h@xmath1 luminosities . </S>",
    "<S> the systematic residuals of these calibrations are tested against the physical properties over the ranges covered by our sample objects . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the best - fitting nonlinear relations are better than the linear ones and recommended to be applied in the measurement of sfrs . </S>",
    "<S> the systematic deviations mainly come from the pollution of old stellar population and the effect of dust extinction ; therefore , a more detailed analysis is needed in the future work .    </S>"
