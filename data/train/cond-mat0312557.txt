    "europium chalcogenides are prospective candidates to serve as spin - filters in prototype spintronic devices @xcite and novel magneto - optical devices ( tunable lasers , detectors and modulators ) @xcite , where the principal source of the interesting physical properties is the _ d - f _ exchange interaction between band - edge electrons and localized eu@xmath4  spins .",
    "the optical properties of europium chalcogenides have already been investigated some 20 - 30 years ago , and it was established that the band - edge absorption spectrum is associated with a @xmath7 electronic transition ( surveys are given in refs .",
    "the experiments were performed on powders @xcite , polycrystalline thin layers @xcite and bulk crystals @xcite , whereby the @xmath0  absorption spectrum is characterized by a very broad band - full width at half maximum of almost @xmath81  ev .",
    "this absorption band was analyzed by some researchers @xcite in terms of an excitonic transition extending mainly in the nearest neighbor eu sites , with an exciton binding energy dependence on external fields and temperature that is governed by the _",
    "d - f _ exchange interaction between the electron and the eu@xmath4  spins in the lattice ( the magnetic exciton model ) .",
    "the large breadth of the absorption line , however , has remained unexplained @xcite , and it has lead some researches to propose , instead , that the absorption spectrum is associated with a transition to extended conduction band states @xcite .",
    "the photoluminescence of europium chalcogenides was also studied , and it is described by a broad line ( full width at half maximum fwhm=150  mev in eute ) with a large stokes shift ( photon energy @xmath9  ev in eute ) @xcite .    recently , molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) was used to produce eute , which has lead to the observation of a much narrower photoluminescence line ( full width at half maximum fwhm=10  mev ) , and at a much photon higher energy ( @xmath10  ev ) @xcite than in previous investigations .",
    "the photoluminescence line displays a giant red shift ( 34  mev / t ) when a magnetic field is applied .",
    "this sensitivity was interpreted in the framework of the magnetic exciton model @xcite .",
    "the theory relies on such basic parameters as the _ d - f _ exchange interaction energy and effective bohr radius , whose accepted values vary within a large interval . for example , the _ d - f _ exchange interaction energy , @xmath11 in eute , has been estimated to be ( a ) 0.35  ev , based on measurements on the temperature dependence of the optical absorption edge @xcite , ( b ) 0.11  ev from the red shift of the faraday rotation spectrum , and also of the optical band - edge , when a high magnetic field is applied @xcite , ( c ) 0.17  ev from theoretical calculations @xcite .    in this work we studied the @xmath0  optical absorption of epitaxial layers of eute grown by mbe , using circularly polarized light and high magnetic fields . at zero magnetic field ,",
    "the optical absorption spectrum is described by a sharp threshold around 2.25  ev .",
    "when the intensity of the applied magnetic field is increased above 6  t , a very sharp symmetric absorption line ( full width at half maximum of 41  mev ) appears at the low energy side of the absorption onset in one of the photon polarizations ( @xmath3 ) . with increasing magnetic field",
    "this absorption line displays a huge red shift , which saturates when the eu@xmath4  spins in the crystal arrange ferromagnetically .",
    "the peak position dependence on the magnetic field fits very well into the model of a localized excitation whose energy is tunable through the _ d - f _ exchange interaction . from the absorption line shift with magnetic field we obtained an estimate of the _ d - f _ exchange interaction energy , @xmath12  ev , with an uncertainty less than 10% .",
    "the optical absorption dependence on magnetical field was also studied for a pb@xmath1eu@xmath2te sample .",
    "the optcial absorption of pb@xmath13eu@xmath14te for @xmath15 is eute - like , i.e. it is associated with an @xmath7 electronic transition , whose energy is pinned at 2.3  ev for @xmath16@xcite . in the pb@xmath1eu@xmath2te sample ,",
    "the same absorption line seen in eute was detected in high magnetic fields ( above 6  t ) , however , the maximum red shift of the line was smaller , due to a smaller concentration on eu@xmath4 in the lattice .",
    "in addition , the width of the absorption line ( 43  mev ) was larger than in eute ( 41  mev ) . assuming that the increase in the breadth of the line is due to alloy disorder",
    ", the radius of localization of the excitation is estimated to be @xmath810 .",
    "recent investigations of the photoluminescence spectrum of eute grown by mbe have discovered almost the same red shift of the optical line ( 34  mev / t ) when a magnetic field is applied , as in this work .",
    "it should be pointed out , however , that the physical mechanisms involved in the photoluminescence could be much more complex than in the optical absorption . according to the franck - condon principle @xcite , whereas absorption occurs when the crystal lattice is undistorted , emission occurs when the atoms surrounding the excitation move to their new equilibrium positions , and in eute a large distortion occurs due to the a large charge transfer from to excited eu@xmath4  to the surrounding atoms @xcite ; in addition to the mechanical distortion , an alignment of the eu@xmath4  spins inside the excitation radius ( forming a magnetic exciton ) , would also contribute to reduce the energy of the excitation .",
    "the amount by which energy is reduced could be dependent on the intensity of the magnetic field applied , due to a changing size of the excitation , making the magnetic field induced red shift seen in the pl much more complex than the red shift of the absorption spectrum reported in this work , in which the positions of the atoms in the lattice , and their spin orientations , are fixed at the unperturbed crystal state .",
    "eute and pb@xmath1eu@xmath2te epitaxial layers ( @xmath17 m thick ) were grown by molecular beam epitaxy ( riber 32p mbe ) onto freshly cleaved ( 111 ) baf@xmath18 substrates . in the case of eute",
    ", the constituents ( eu and te ) were sublimated from elemental sources , while a pbte source was used for the pb@xmath1eu@xmath2te  growth .",
    "pb@xmath13eu@xmath14te crystallizes in the rock salt structure , and its lattice mismatch to the baf@xmath18 substrate ( fluoride structure ) varies from 4 to 6% , with increasing eu content in the ternary compound . in addition , the thermal expansion coefficient of baf@xmath18 is well matched to those of pbte and eute , thus preventing the build up of high thermal strains when cooling the samples to cryogenic temperatures .",
    "the eu content values in the pb@xmath1eu@xmath2te sample was determined by magnetization squid measurements , with an estimated uncertainty of less than one percent .",
    "the crystalline quality was investigated by measuring the x - ray rocking curve of the ( 222 ) bragg reflection of the samples .",
    "the peak position corresponded to the bulk lattice parameter of 6.600 , and the full width at half maximum of the eute diffraction peak was about 400 arcsec , which is indicative of a good structural quality ( for pb@xmath1eu@xmath2te  the fwhm of the peak was larger than in eute by about 100  arcsec , due to alloy disorder ) .",
    "pl measurements at t=2k were made , using the 488 nm line of an ar laser , and the sharp luminescence ( fwhm@xmath810  mev ) at 1.922  ev was detected , demonstrating the high optical quality of the samples @xcite .",
    "the optical absorption spectra of eute samples and pb@xmath1eu@xmath2te   were measured at 1.8k , using left and right circularly polarized light , in magnetic fields of intensity up to 17 teslas . the sample ( square shaped , of side length 2.5  mm ) , was immersed in superfluid helium , and light was conveyed to the sample , and collected from the sample , in the faraday configuration , using optical fibers coupled to _ in situ _ miniature focusing optics and circular polarizers .",
    "the absorption spectrum taken at zero field shows the characteristic absorption onset at @xmath82.3 ev ( see fig.[fig : fig1 ] ) , which is associated with the @xmath0  transition @xcite . in the transparency region ,",
    "the absorption coefficient shows weak oscillations , due to the effect of fabri - perot interference in the thin epitaxial film .",
    "when a magnetic field is applied , the absorption edges taken in both polarizations show remarkably different behaviours . in the @xmath19 polarization",
    "there is simply a red shift of the absorption edge , which saturates when the applied field , @xmath20 , reaches 8.3  t. in the @xmath3 polarization , however , the absorption spectrum does not red shift as a whole , but develops a new sharp absorption peak that emerges from the main absorption edge . with increasing magnetic field the new absorption peak gains intensity , and it red shifts , until saturation is reached at @xmath20=8.3  t. the same absorption spectra were measured for a number of eute samples of various thickness in the range of 1 - 3@xmath21 m , some of which contained a baf@xmath18 protective layer , some of which did not .",
    "the position and width of the peak was the same in all samples , and the optical density of the sharp absorption peak was proportional to the thickness of the eute epitaxial layer , demonstrating that the absorption line is originated in the bulk of eute .",
    "for our sample geometry ( a thin layer of eute subject to a perpendicular magnetic field ) , the internal field will be given by @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the magnetization of the sample , and @xmath24 varies linearly with @xmath20 and saturates to @xmath25  t at @xmath26  t @xcite , meaning that @xmath20=8.3  t corresponds to an internal field equal to the well known critical field value of 7.2  t for eute .",
    "we have employed fields as large as 17  t , but no further changes were seen in the absorption spectra .",
    "the absorption spectra at @xmath20=9.6  t in both polarizations are shown in figure  1 .    to show the evolution of the absorption spectra taken in the @xmath19 and @xmath3 polarizations when",
    "the applied magnetic field is increased from zero , a contour plot of the absorption spectra is shown in figure 2 .",
    "this figure shows that in the @xmath19 polarization the absorption edge red shifts almost linearly with the field intensity , until saturation is reached .",
    "in contrast , the evolution of the absorption spectrum in the @xmath3 polarization does not show a linear red shift of the absorption edge , but rather the changes in the spectrum are described by the emergence of a sharp absorption line at the low energy side of the spectrum .",
    "when @xmath27 is less than the saturation value , the strength of the sharp absorption line increases with @xmath27 , and it red shifts , leading to a completely resolved line at the highest fields .",
    "the red shift of the sharp peak is described by a huge value of 35  mev / t , which is about the same value seen in the shift of excitonic pl @xcite .",
    "notice also that the main absorption edge remains nearly in the same place as at @xmath28 .",
    "the peak position and full width at half maximum of the sharp absorption peak seen in the @xmath3  polarization at fields above 8.3  t were obtained from a fit of the absorption spectrum with a linear combination of a gaussian curve and a straight line ( see fig.[fig : fig3 ] ) . for eute ,",
    "the maximum occurs at 2.169  ev ( the peak is shifted by @xmath29 ev from the main @xmath0  absorption ) , and the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) equals to 41  mev .",
    "the pb@xmath1eu@xmath2te  sample showed the same qualitative behavior as seen in eute , but the low energy side peak was broader than for eute , and centered at a higher energy , as shown in the right panel of fig.[fig : fig1 ] .",
    "the absorption maximum is seen at 2.181  ev , i.e. an energy 12  mev greater than for eute , and the fwhm=43  mev , greater by 2  mev compared to the same value for eute ( see right panel in fig.[fig : fig3 ] ) .",
    "the magnetic field dependence of the newly discovered absorption line will be discussed in the framework of the @xmath30 exchange interaction .",
    "the @xmath30 exchange interaction energy operator is given by @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the @xmath30 exchange interaction constant , @xmath33 is the creation operator of a wannier function centered at the @xmath34th eu@xmath4  with spin @xmath21 , @xmath35 is a pauli spin operator , and @xmath36 the spin of the @xmath34th eu@xmath4 .",
    "we treat @xmath37 as a perturbation over a photoexcited electron in a @xmath38band with definite spin , whose wave function is given by @xmath39 .",
    "the spin of the photoexcited electron is subject to the constraint that it must be parallel to the eu@xmath4  spin at the site where the excitation occurred @xcite .",
    "we assume that the wave function describing the excited state encloses a large number of eu@xmath4  sites , hence at zero magnetic field ( t=0k ) , when the arrangement of the eu ions is antiferromagnetic , ( the eu spins lie in the ( 111 ) plane @xcite ) , the @xmath30 interaction energy of the photoexcited electron averages out to zero .",
    "as the magnetic field applied normal to the ( 111 ) increases , the eu@xmath4  spins ca nt in the magnetic field direction , the _ d - f _ exchange interaction energy increases and at arbitrary field it will be given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the angle between the sublattice spin directions , determined by @xcite @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the saturation field for eute @xcite .",
    "fig.[fig : fig4 ] shows the measured position of the side peak as a function of applied magnetic field both for eute and pb@xmath1eu@xmath2te . the same peak position dependence on magnetic field as for the eute sample shown in figure  [ fig : fig4 ]",
    "was obtained for a second eute sample , whose epitaxial layer thickness was 1.75@xmath21 m . the solid lines in fig.[fig : fig4 ]",
    "were obtained by a simultaneous fit of all of the experimental values shown to the equation @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the position of the excitonic line at @xmath28 , @xmath46 is the molar fraction of eu in the pb@xmath13eu@xmath14te sample , and @xmath47 is given by eq.([eq : deltae ] ) . equation ( [ eq : deltaex ] ) should be valid in the range @xmath16 , where the pb@xmath13eu@xmath14te gap is eute - like and nearly constant @xcite . in the fitting procedure ,",
    "the spin of the eu@xmath4  was fixed at @xmath48 , and the @xmath30 exchange interaction constant , @xmath32 , and @xmath45 were the fitting parameters , leading to the best fit values of @xmath45=2.321  ev and @xmath5  ev .    for pb@xmath1eu@xmath2te , the energy position of the side peak is greater than in eute , which is due to a lower density of spins in the lattice .",
    "then , assuming that in going from eute to pb@xmath1eu@xmath2te , the increase in the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the side peak is due to inhomogeneous broadening , caused by random fluctuations in the local eu concentration , the number of eu@xmath4  spins inside the exciton radius can be estimated through @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the shift in the position of the maximum of the excitonic line and the change in eu molar fraction on going from eute to pb@xmath13eu@xmath14te , respectively . using the results obtained for eute and pb@xmath1eu@xmath2te",
    ", we find @xmath52 , which justifies the assumption made above that the exciton is large , and means that the exciton sphere encloses about 10 conventional unit cells of the fcc structure .",
    "this estimate puts the exciton diameter at approximately 18 .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have studied the optical band - edge absorption in eute and pb@xmath1eu@xmath2te  grown by mbe at low temperatures and high magnetic fields . under @xmath3 polarization",
    ", we detect a well - resolved sharp peak ( full width 0.041  ev ) .",
    "the sharp absorption line displays a huge red shift of about 35  mev / t when the magnetic field increases , and its separation from the main absorption band reaches @xmath8 0.2 ev at the saturation field . in pb@xmath1eu@xmath2te , the same absorption line was also detected , but it is broader , which is an indication of a localized excitation .",
    "the displacement of the absorption line with magnetic field fits very well into a model of a localized excitation whose energy is tuned by the _",
    "d - f _ exchange interaction . from a fit of the experimental points to the theory we obtain a direct estimate of the _ d - f _ exchange interaction energy , @xmath53=0.15@xmath540.01  ev .",
