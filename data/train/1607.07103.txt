    "one of the direct proofs of the zero - point fluctuations predicted by quantum physics is the _ dynamical casimir effect _ ( dce )  a rather broad term that denotes the creation of quanta from the vacuum state of some field due to fast changes of the geometry or internal properties of macroscopic or mesoscopic objects ( see @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "although originally ascribed to the generation of photons due to the accelerated motion of a single mirror @xcite or some cavity wall ( where the photons can be accumulated @xcite ) , this phenomenon has been extended to a variety of other systems , for instance , the phonon analogues in a bose - einstein condensate @xcite , quantum fluid of light @xcite or atomic gas with time - dependent effective charge @xcite . recently",
    "two different groups implemented dce analogues in the circuit quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) architecture @xcite , where the periodic motion of the boundary was simulated by driving magnetic flux through the squids ( superconducting quantum interference devices ) located at the end @xcite or within the coplanar waveguide @xcite .",
    "it has been predicted @xcite that the circuit qed architecture also allows for the implementation of dce analogue using a single _ artificial atom _  a macroscopic superconducting circuit composed of several josephson junctions that has discrete energy levels , exhibits coherent quantum oscillations between these levels and can strongly couple to the electromagnetic field cir3,atoms0,atoms1,atoms2,atoms4 .",
    "the internal properties of the artificial atom can be controlled _ in situ _ by applying external electric and magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "hence , the generation of photons from vacuum via the modulation of parameters of a single two - level atom ( _ qubit _ ) , also initiated in the ground state , would prove that dce is an intrinsic effect of the light ",
    "matter interaction , originating from the counter - rotating terms in the interaction hamiltonian . indeed , within a toy model for dce inside a cavity @xcite , the modulation of the material properties of a mesoscopic dielectric slab can be modeled by time - dependent transition frequencies of @xmath0 atoms , while the slab s oscillation can be viewed as varying atom  field coupling strengths .",
    "the idea of using qubits with rapidly varying parameters goes beyond the simple verification of photon generation from vacuum due to the counter - rotating terms . by carefully adjusting the form of modulation , the intrinsic nonlinearities in the light ",
    "matter interaction @xcite may give rise to novel applications in quantum - information processing , quantum simulations and engineering of nonclassical states of light and matter @xcite .",
    "along with creation of photon pairs , one can engineer effective interactions that lead to simultaneous generation of photons and atomic excitations @xcite or coherent annihilation of the system quanta from a known initial state igor , diego .",
    "an intuitive explanation for such behaviors is the modulation - induced selective coupling between the bare atom ",
    "field dressed states @xcite .",
    "the photon generation and annihilation rates can be enhanced by using a set of @xmath0 identical noninteracting qubits , when novel interaction regimes can be induced as a consequence of a richer spectrum of the composite system @xcite .    although the qubit parameters can be readily tuned in the circuit qed setup @xcite , one is still left with the technical difficulty of imposing a periodic modulation with frequency of the order @xmath5 , where @xmath6ghz is the cavity frequency .",
    "so the goal of this paper is to discover whether one could use the halved modulation frequencies @xmath7 to achieve similar phenomena via the second - order resonances .",
    "it will be shown analytically in section [ desc ] that the answer is yes , and the modulation of the atomic transition frequency is more efficient than the modulation of the coupling strength to implement the second - order resonances , whereas for the first - order resonances they are of the same order @xcite . moreover , in section [ disc ] we shall perform numerical simulations in the presence of dissipation to assess whether the second - order resonances are feasible with the current parameters @xcite . as demonstrated in [ apa ] ,",
