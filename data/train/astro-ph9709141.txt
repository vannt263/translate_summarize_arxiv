    "the molecular interstellar medium ( ism ) in galaxies at redshifts up to z@xmath40.9 has been studied through the use of absorption of molecular rotational transitions ( cf . wiklind & combes 1996a ,",

    "allows a derivation of accurate excitation temperatures , column densities and abundance ratios ( wiklind & combes 1994 , 1995 , 1996a , b ) .",
    "four molecular absorption line systems are known to date ; in two of them the absorption occurs in the host galaxy to the agn and two represent truly intervening galaxies .",
    "since the distribution of molecular gas in galaxies is usually centrally concentrated , the likelihood to encounter a molecular cloud is higher if the line of sight passes close to the center of an intervening galaxy .",
    "this means that also the likelihood for gravitational lensing is high and , indeed , in each of the two systems where absorption occurs in an intervening galaxy , that galaxy acts as a gravitational lens to the background source ( wiklind & combes 1995 , 1996a )    the use of molecular absorption lines is manifold .",
    "apart from studying the physical and chemical properties of molecular gas in distant galaxies , they can be used as probes of very small scale structures in the molecular gas .",
    "they can also be used as cosmographic probes , to set upper limits to the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation and to constrain the geometry in gravitationally lensed systems .",
    "the molecular ism is probed on a scale of a few tenths of a parsec , limited only by the angular extent of the background source .",
    "the main uncertainty in the molecular gas properties derived from the absorption lines is due to our ignorance of possible small scale structures in the ism on scales smaller than the angular extent of the background source ( e.g. wiklind & combes 1997 ) .    in this article",
    ", we concentrate on the absorption line system originating in a galaxy which plays the role of a gravitational lens at z@xmath00.886 ( wiklind & combes 1996a ) .",

    "this radio source has long been considered a gravitational lens candidate on basis of the radio structure ( rao & subrahmanyan 1988 ; jauncey et al .",
    "1991 ) . since optical and near  infrared searches for an optical counterpart to the radio source",
    "as well to the lensing galaxy have remained unsuccessful ( cf .",

    "1992 ) , the modeling of the lensing system was lacking redshift information ( kochanek & narayan 1992 ; nair , narasimha & rao 1993 ) .",
    "the galaxy at z@xmath00.886 was discovered by searching for molecular absorption lines in the 3 and 2mm band ( wiklind & combes 1996a ) .",
    "a second intervening system has been reported at z@xmath00.193 , seen through 21 cm hi absorption by lovell et al .",

    "we present new molecular absorption data on the galaxy at z@xmath00.886 as well as upper limits to molecular absorption and emission on the z@xmath00.193 system .",
    "we also discuss what can be inferred regarding the mass of the lensing galaxy and the redshift of the background source .",
    "our data were obtained using the iram millimeter wave interferometer situated on plateau de bure in france , the single dish iram 30m telescope on pico veleta in spain and the 15m sest ( swedish eso submillimeter telescope ) on la silla in chile .",
    "the interferometer observations were done on several occasions during 1995 and 1996 .",
    "the single dish observations were likewise obtained during several observing runs in 1995 and 1996 .    at the iram 30m telescope we used 3 , 2 , and 1.3mm sis receivers tuned to the redshifted frequency of the observed transition .",
    "the observations were made using a nutating subreflector with a frequency of 0.5hz and with a throw of @xmath690  in azimuth .",
    "typical system temperatures in the @xmath7 scale were 400600k .",
    "the weather conditions were good on most observing sessions .",
    "pointing , focusing and calibration were done before each observation . as backends we used narrow band autocorrelators , giving a velocity resolution of approximately 0.7kms@xmath3 and a bandwidth of 400kms@xmath3 . at the sest we used 3 , and 2mm sis receivers with typical system temperatures 200300k .",
    "here we used an aos with a bandwidth of 1200kms@xmath3 and a velocity resolution of 0.7kms@xmath3 .",
    "these observations were done in a dual beamswitch mode , where the beam is displaced 12 in azimuth at a frequency of 6hz .",
    "the sest data was obtained under good weather conditions .",
    "pointing and calibration where done as at iram .",
    "the interferometer data were made with the standard bc configuration ( see guilloteau et al .",
    "the array comprised 4 15m telescopes .",
    "the receivers were 3mm sis , giving a typical system temperature of 400500k .",
    "pks1830211 itself was used as a phase reference , while bandpass and amplitude calibrations were done using also nrao 530 , 3c454.3 and w3oh .",
    "the data reduction was made with the standard clic software . due to the low elevation of the pks1830211",
    ", we obtained a beam of 6 x 2.4 arcsec .",
    "this appears insufficient to resolve two images separated by only one arcsec ; but due to the high signal  to  noise ratio , we were able to fit the integrated line profile and the phase center , as a function of frequency , directly from the visibilities .",
    "we also made a two point sources fit , which gave the relative positions of the two images and their relative fluxes .",
    "the accuracy of the measurement depends on the inherent uncertainty in the chopper ",
    "wheel calibration method as well as the pointing of the telescope .",
    "the overall accuracy for a single observation on the intensities are around 510% for the interferometer data and 1020% for the single dish data .",
    "in our first study of the molecular absorption line system towards pks1830211 we found that the hco@xmath1(2@xmath21 ) , hcn(2@xmath21 ) and , possibly , the hnc(2@xmath21 ) lines were heavily saturated ( wiklind & combes 1996a ) . yet , the depths of these absorption lines were only 36% of the total continuum . since the magnification ratio derived from long wavelength interferometer data is 1.8 ( nair et al . 1993 ) , corresponding to a flux fraction of @xmath836% for the sw and 64% for the ne core , respectively , we concluded that the molecular gas only covers the sw core , with a high covering factor ( close to 100% ) .",
    "the present interferometric results confirm that only the sw component is absorbed around @xmath9 .    in fig.1",
    "we show the hco@xmath1(2@xmath21 ) spectrum obtained with the plateau de bure interferometer .",
    "the low declination of pks1830211 makes imaging difficult , partly due to a north - south elongated beam , and to the large air  mass .",
    "the continuum is , however , strong enough to allow a self  calibration of the data .",
    "we made a gaussian fit of the source directly from the visibility data , and traced the location of the phase ",
    "center as a function of frequency .",
    "the accuracy is very good in ra ( @xmath80.05  ) and slightly worse in dec ( @xmath80.1  ) .",
    "the two top panels in fig.1 show the relative phase in ra and dec as a function of velocity across the absorption profile . from the data obtained in september and october 1995 ,",
    "the maximum shifts are @xmath10 and @xmath11 . from the april",
    "1996 data we get @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( see also fig.3 ) .",
    "if the flux fraction from the ne and sw cores are @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively ( @xmath16 ) , the shift of the phase  center along the line joining the cores is @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the fraction of continuum flux from the sw core that is covered by optically thick molecular gas of velocity @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the separation of the two components and @xmath21 is the position angle of the line joining the two cores , measured from north to east . from the 15ghz vla continuum map presented by subrahmanyan et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , we derive @xmath22 and @xmath23 . expressing the flux fractions in terms of the magnification ratio @xmath24 , we get @xmath25 . using the magnification ratio @xmath26 derived from long wavelength interferometry of 1.8 ( nair et al .",
    "1993 ) and assuming that the covering factor @xmath27 is 100% for the sw component , the phase ",
    "center should shift @xmath28 and @xmath29 , which is consistent with the shift that we see in fig",
    "frye , welch & broadhurst ( 1997 ) observed pks1830211 with the bima interferometer and derived a magnification ratio of @xmath30 by resolving the two continuum components . since the hco@xmath1(2@xmath21 )",
    "line is manifestly optically thick , as seen through the detection of the h@xmath31co@xmath1(2@xmath21 ) line ( wiklind & combes 1996a ) , such a low magnification ratio indicates that the covering factor @xmath27 of the sw core is only 8084% .",
    "however , they measure a total flux of 2.25 jy in march 96 ( 1 march and 20 march ) , much larger than ours of @xmath32 jy on 28 february and @xmath33 jy on 14 april 96 ) .",
    "measurements made with the owens valley interferometer on 1 march gave @xmath34 jy ( s. aalto priv . comm . ) .",
    "it thus appears that the continuum is overestimated by a factor 1.41.5 in frye et al .",
    "we stress that calibration is quite delicate since there exist significant rapid variations in the continuum levels of the two images .",
    "given the high signal  to  noise of the plateau de bure observations , we have tried to retrieve the magnification ratio from a two point sources fit of the visibility data .",
    "the fits were very robust , completely independent of the initial parameters , and revealed an ra and dec separation between the two images exactly consistent with @xmath35 and @xmath36 in all the 136 channels without absorption . in table 1",
    "we show the magnification ratios obtained at the various epochs .",
    "although the absolute calibration is not so precise , we believe that the relative ratios between the two components is accurate . although the magnification ratio has changed from @xmath37 to @xmath38 between october 1995 and april 1996 , in concordance with the value derived by frye et al , the lower continuum level measured by us is in agreement with a covering factor @xmath81 for the sw component ( see sect.4.2 ) .",
    "we have detected a second absorption component situated at a velocity @xmath39147kms@xmath3 relative to the main hco@xmath1(2@xmath21 ) absorption at z@xmath00.88582 .",
    "the second component is hereafter refered to as the ` satellite ' .",
    "the hco@xmath1(2@xmath21 ) line has been observed extensively during a monitoring campaign at both the iram 30m and sest 15m telescope .",
    "averages of data obtained during 1996 are shown in fig.2 , where the two dashed vertical lines mark zero velocity and @xmath40kms@xmath3 in a heliocentric velocity scale in the restframe of the z@xmath00.88582 absorber .",
    "the satellite line is not seen in the hco@xmath1(3@xmath22 ) spectrum .",
    "frye et al ( 1997 ) could have detected this component in march 96 ( since the line was present at this epoch , see fig .",
    "3 ) , but their lower signal - to noise ratio prevented the detection .",
    "could the second absorption line be associated with the z@xmath00.193 hi absorber rather than the one at z@xmath00.886 ?",
    "the only line at z@xmath00.193 which could be in the ` vicinity ' of the observed frequency of the satellite line at 94.635ghz is the redshifted co(10 ) line at 96.650ghz .",
    "the difference is in excess of 2ghz , corresponding to a velocity difference of @xmath86200kms@xmath3 in the restframe of the z@xmath00.193 absorber .",
    "it is therefore highly unlikely that the satellite absorption is associated with this system .",
    "we conclude that the satellite line is a second hco@xmath1(2@xmath21 ) line at a blueshifted velocity of @xmath40kms@xmath3 relative to the redshift z@xmath00.88582 ( corresponding to a redshift of z@xmath41 ) .",
    "whereas the main absorption line at @xmath9 has a depth of 3840% of the total continuum , the satellite line has a depth of only 7% .",
    "measured in antenna temperature , this corresponds to 1.5mk and 6mk in the sest and iram data , as of april 96 .",
    "the actual opacity , however , depends on the surface covering factor of the absorption .",
    "the separation of the ne and sw continuum components is 0.98  , corresponding to a distance of 5.6kpc , measured in the plane of the sky ( h@xmath42kms@xmath3mpc@xmath3 , q@xmath43=0.5 ) .",
    "the satellite absorption can therefore be associated with only one of the continuum sources . since the flux contribution from the ne and sw components are @xmath860% and @xmath840% , respectively , the satellite absorption line is either optically thin or has a very small covering factor .",
    "the satellite absorption line is clearly seen in the interferometer data ( fig.3 ) .",
    "the relative location of the phase ",
    "center for @xmath44 is shown in the top panel .",
    "in addition to the positive shift of the phase  center already established for the main absorption around @xmath9kms@xmath3 , a shift is also seen at the velocity of the satellite line , but this time towards negative values .",
    "this shows that the phase ",
    "center moves partly towards the sw continuum component at the velocity of the satellite absorption .",
    "the second absorption component must therefore originate in front of the ne continuum core .",
    "we are thus seeing molecular gas from two different parts of the intervening galaxy .",
    "two absorption components , separated by 330kms@xmath3 , are also seen at z@xmath00.673 towards the radio source b31504 + 377 ( wiklind & combes 1996b ) . in this case",
    "the absorption occurs in the galaxy hosting the radio source .",
    "the galaxy is close to edge  on and the separation of the two absorption lines are caused by non ",
    "circular velocities along a single line of sight within the disk of the host galaxy , most likely caused by the presence of a barred potential .",
    "the line of sight to the two images of the continuum core of pks1830 - 211 passes through the intervening galaxy at @xmath81.8 and @xmath83.8kpc ( sw and ne components ) from the lens center ( nair et al .",
    "1993 ) . a normal rotation curve ( and circular orbits )",
    "are sufficient here to account for the observations .",
    "we derived column densities using the formalism presented in wiklind & combes ( 1995 , 1997 ) .",
    "the hco@xmath1 column density of the satellite absorber , derived using 60% of the total flux , is only @xmath45@xmath46 ( however we can not exclude the case of a highly saturated line with a small covering factor ) . using 40% of the total flux for the main line , we find an hco@xmath1 column density @xmath47@xmath46 .",
    "this value is derived from the averaged monitoring data for 1996 and is slightly higher than the column density reported in wiklind & combes ( 1996a ) . since the main line is heavily saturated , the difference is due to the much better signal  to  noise ratio of the new data .",
    "the column densities have been derived using an excitation temperature @xmath48k . integrating the j@xmath03@xmath22 spectrum over the extent of",
    "the j@xmath02@xmath21 line sets a 3@xmath49 upper limit to the excitation temperature of 8k ( a 2@xmath49 limit implies @xmath50k ) .",
    "we searched for redshifted co(1@xmath20 ) absorption and/or emission as well as hco@xmath1(2@xmath21 ) absorption at z@xmath00.19267 .",
    "neither emission nor absorption was found .",
    "the co and hco@xmath1 spectra are shown in fig.4 .      the continuum level at the redshifted frequency of the co(1@xmath20 ) and hco@xmath1(2@xmath21 )",
    "lines are 50mk and 26mk , at the sest telescope . however , when deriving upper limits to the column density for molecular absorption we have to take the separate flux contributions into account . while the 21 cm hi absorption only occurs over the ne component ( lovell et al .",
    "1996 ) , putative molecular absorption can occur in front of both components .",
    "in table2 we give upper limits for three cases ; ( 1 ) the total continuum flux , ( 2 ) 60% of the flux , corresponding to the ne component , and ( 3 ) 40% , corresponding to the sw component . in all cases",
    "we assume an excitation temperature of 6k .",
    "the ratio of the upper limits of the molecular column density to that of the hi is done for the ne component , since this line of sight causes the atomic absorption at z@xmath00.193 .",
    "we derived the hi column density from the spectra presented in lovell et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , by fitting two gaussian profiles .",
    "the resulting column density is @xmath51@xmath46 , where @xmath52 is the spin temperature and @xmath53 is the area filling factor .",
    "since the hi absorption is only seen towards the ne component @xmath54 , where the factor 0.6 corresponds to the flux contribution of the ne component and @xmath55 is the area covering factor of atomic gas for this component . assuming a spin temperature of 100k , which is typical for atomic hydrogen gas in the milky way , the column density of atomic gas is @xmath56@xmath46 . for the abundance ratios given in table1 we set @xmath57 .",
    "using a typical value for @xmath58 of @xmath59 , the abundance ratio of molecular and atomic hydrogen is @xmath60 in the z@xmath00.193 absorber .",
    "this limit is not very illuminating , since the column density of atomic gas is relatively low , corresponding to an extinction @xmath61mag ( e.g. savage et al .",
    "since co becomes self  shielded only at @xmath62mag ( e.g. lucas & liszt 1994 ) we do not expect a significant amount co at these low hi column densities . molecular hydrogen , however , can still be present , since it becomes self  shielded at lower @xmath63 .",
    "our co(10 ) spectra of the z@xmath00.193 hi absorption can also be used to derive an upper limit to the global molecular mass content of any intervening galaxy at this distance .",
    "the single dish telescope beam has a fwhp size of 52  at a frequency of 96.65ghz , corresponding to @xmath8143kpc at z@xmath00.193 .",
    "since atomic gas disks are considerably smaller than this , an intervening galaxy causing the 21 cm hi absorption at z@xmath00.193 must be within our telescope beam .",
    "the effective beam of the interferometer data is 6@xmath652.4 ",
    "( 16.5@xmath656.6 kpc ) with a noise rms of 10mjy / beam .",
    "the field of view is the same as for the single dish observation , since 15m telescopes were used in both cases .",
    "the single dish co spectrum shown in fig.4 has a channel  to  channel noise rms of 1.0mk when binned to a resolution of 17kms@xmath3 .",
    "no emission is evident in the spectrum and we derive a 3@xmath49 upper limit to the integrated co intensity by assuming a linewidth of 200kms@xmath3 to be @xmath660.17kkms@xmath3 .",
    "the co(10 ) spectrum does have a high frequency baseline curvature , which has been removed in the spectrum shown in fig.4 .",
    "the uncertainty in the derived integrated intensity is limited by this curvature , but only for emission more extended than 1000kms@xmath3 .",
    "since such wide emission profiles are rarely encountered , we believe that the baseline curvature is of little concern in this case . the interferometer data does not suffer from any baseline curvature and gives a 3@xmath49 upper limit to the integrated co intensity of @xmath660.09kkms@xmath3    the co line luminosity , expressed in kkms@xmath3pc@xmath67 , can be written as @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the luminosity distance , @xmath70 is the velocity integrated co intensity expressed in kkms@xmath3 , and @xmath71 is the solid angle of the source brightness distribution convolved with the telescope beam , @xmath72 . for distant sources and single dish telescopes , this convolution is dominated by the solid angle of the beam and we can approximate it with @xmath73 , ( e.g. solomon et al .",
    "1997 ) , where @xmath74 is the full width at half power of the telescope beam measured in arcseconds .",
    "the mass of molecular gas is obtained by assuming a conversion factor between co luminosity and the column density of h@xmath5 : @xmath75 .",
    "we use a standard milky way conversion factor @xmath76m@xmath77  ( kkms@xmath3  pc@xmath67)@xmath3 ( e.g. solomon et al .",

    "in addition to the 12 absorption lines presented in wiklind & combes ( 1996a ) we have detected additional absorption lines from co(4@xmath23 ) , h@xmath5co(@xmath80 ) and h@xmath31cn(2@xmath21 ) .",

    "the redshift of the absorber is such that the three first rotational transitions of co fall at frequencies unfavorable for ground based observations .",
    "the co(4@xmath23 ) line , however , is shifted into the 1mm band .",
    "we observed this line with the iram 30m telescope in may 1996 and the spectrum is presented in fig.5a .",
    "the line is rather strong , with a depth almost equal to that of the saturated transitions of hco@xmath1 and hcn . using 40% of the total flux and an excitation temperature of 6k ,",
    "the co column density is @xmath81@xmath46 .",
    "should @xmath82 be higher , say 20k , the column density becomes @xmath83@xmath46 . for higher excitation temperatures the column density increases again .",
    "the main uncertainty in this derivation is the continuum flux . due to",
    "unstable weather conditions it was not possible to derive @xmath84 .",
    "we have used the continuum flux determined from the 3 and 2mm bands , which corresponds to 1.2jy and converted this to antenna temperature in the 1mm band .",
    "although indirect , the energy distribution of the radio source pks1830211 is flat enough to make this approach viable . the excitation temperature of co can be higher than the low values found for hco@xmath1 , hcn , n@xmath5h@xmath1 , cs , etc .",
    "( see wiklind & combes 1996a ) .",
    "the reason is the lower electric dipole moment of co , making it more easily collisionally excited and giving co a higher level population at rotational levels j@xmath853 than do hco@xmath1 and hcn .",
    "different excitation temperatures for co and the other molecular species is consistent with the ` weak lte ' conditions assumed when deriving the excitation temperature , where it is assumed that the level population of each molecule is characterized by a unique temperature ( that is : @xmath86 ) , but this temperature can be different from one molecular species to another ( see wiklind & combes 1995 , 1997 ) .",

    "the detection of a second absorption line component at a redshift z@xmath00.886 , shifted in velocity relative to the main one and associated with the ne image of the background source , opens up a unique possibility to derive the dynamical mass of the central few kpc of the lensing galaxy .",
    "this is valuable information when modelling the lens , specifically when using time delay measurements to derive cosmographic parameters such as the hubble constant . at the present",
    "this is hampered by the non  detection of the lensing galaxy at optical and infrared wavelengths ( e.g. djorgovski et al .",
    "this is likely to change with new and more powerful infrared detectors .",
    "it is , however , possible to use very simple but powerful arguments , based on the assumption that the lensing galaxy is a ` normal ' disk galaxy , to get reasonable ranges for the mass of the lensing galaxy as well as the redshift of the background radio source already from the present data .    the observed line of sight velocity in a disk galaxy of inclination @xmath94 , having a rotational velocity @xmath95 is @xmath96 where @xmath26 is the galactocentric radius in the plane of the galaxy and @xmath97 is the angle from the line of nodes , as measured in the plane of the galaxy . @xmath26 and @xmath97 are related to the radius @xmath20 and angle @xmath98 measured in the plane of the sky through @xmath99 if we assume ( it will be justified below ) that @xmath94 is small ( i.e. @xmath100 ) , the differences between radii and angles measured in the plane of the sky and those in the plane of the galaxy are small ( @xmath101 0.87 )",
    "this is a reasonable assumption since , as we will show below , the dynamical mass required to cause the image separation of pks1830211 implies that the rotational velocity of the lensing galaxy is more than twice larger than the observed velocity separation of the main and satellite absorption lines ( e.g. @xmath102 , and @xmath103 ) .",
    "if we also make the assumption that the rotation curve is similar in shape to those found in nearby galaxies , we can assert that the rotational velocity is approximately constant at radii @xmath104kpc .",
    "this is seen from inspection of the rotation curves derived for all different types of spiral galaxies by rubin et al .",

    "they both agree that the center of the lensing galaxy is close to the center of the ring seen in radio interferometer data and that the lens has a small eccentricity .",
    "the model of nair et al .",
    "places the center of the lens somewhat closer to the sw image than that of kochanek & narayan . in the former case the sw and ne cores are seen at projected distances of 1.8kpc and 3.8kpc from the center . in the model by kochanek & narayan , both cores are @xmath83kpc from the center of the lens . in either case , it is reasonable to assume that the rotational velocity of the lensing galaxy has reached a relatively constant value at the projected location of both the sw and ne cores ; @xmath105 .",
    "the observed velocity difference between two points in the galaxy is then @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the angle between the line of nodes and the line joining the center of the lens with the point where the line of sight crosses the disk , measured east of north .",
    "the angles @xmath107 are 52@xmath108 and 204@xmath108 for the ne and sw components , respectively .",
    "this gives a simple relation between the maximum velocity @xmath109 , the inclination @xmath94 and the observed velocity separation of the absorption lines : @xmath110 , where @xmath21 is the position angle of the major axis of the lensing galaxy .",
    "geometrical considerations of the lensing morphology implies that the position angle is either @xmath111 or @xmath112 ( kochanek & narayan 1992 ; nair et al .",
    "the mass inside a radius @xmath26 is given by the virial theorem @xmath113 where @xmath27 is the factor depending on the position angle of the lens : @xmath114 for @xmath115 and @xmath116 for @xmath117 .",
    "we will adopt a position angle @xmath115 in the following , keeping in mind that values can change by at most 20% should the position angle be @xmath118 . in the last equality we used @xmath119kms@xmath3 and @xmath120kpc .",
    "the two radio  components in pks1830211 have almost identical substructure , suggesting that the components are two parity  reversed images of the background quasar caused by a nearly perfect alignment of the lens and the source ( e.g. nair et al .",
    "the separation of the ne and sw images can therefore to first order be described as the effect of a single point mass deflector of mass @xmath121 , with the image separation given by the ` einstein angle ' @xmath122 @xmath123 in the last equality @xmath121 is expressed in solar mass and the distance parameter @xmath124 in gpc ; @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is the distance between the observer and the lens , @xmath127 the distance between observer and the source , and @xmath128 the distance between the lens and the source , all measured as angular size distances ( e.g. schneider , ehlers & falco 1992 ) . the last equation yields : @xmath129 ( @xmath124 in gpc ) , and with the virial theorem : @xmath130 in fig.6 we plot @xmath124 as a function of the source redshift for a fixed lens redshift of z@xmath00.88582 . the distances are derived using h@xmath42kms@xmath3mpc@xmath3 and for q@xmath131 ( full  drawn line ) and q@xmath132 ( dotted line ) .",
    "@xmath124 remains larger than 2 for all source redshift less than z@xmath47 .",
    "this , together with the last equation , means simply that the observed image separation of @xmath81 \" already requires a massive galaxy for the lens : for a redshift of the background source @xmath133 , the required rotational velocity is 350kms@xmath3 , corresponding to a massive early type spiral .",
    "lower redshifts for the background source would require higher rotational velocities , corresponding to an even more massive galaxy , which is not realistic for spirals ( unless several galaxies are considered to contribute to the lensing ) .",
    "rotational velocities typical for late type spirals can be excluded , since the redshift of the background source becomes forbiddingly large .",
    "now , using the relation @xmath134 derived above , with @xmath135 = 147kms@xmath3 and @xmath109 = 350kms@xmath3 , yields an inclination of @xmath94 = 16@xmath136 .",
    "how sensitively do these conclusions depend on the assumptions ? ( 1 ) the approximation of the lensing mass as a singular point mass is only correct to first order if the lens and the background source are aligned .",
    "this is approximately true for pks1830211 .",
    "( 2 ) the derivation of inclination assumes that the absorbing gas is on circular orbits .",
    "if it has non  circular motion with an amplitude comparable to the rotational velocity , this simple approach is not valid .",
    "however , the lens model of kochanek & narayan ( 1993 ) independently finds a low inclination .",
    "( 3 ) the presence of an absorber at z@xmath00.193 introduces extra shear and , possibly , convergence of the ray bundles .",
    "however , given the relatively simple image configuration it is not likely that the extra mass concentration at low redshift adds to the image multiplicity .",
    "it can , however , influence the interpretation of time delay measurements and garrett et al .",
    "( 1996 ) find from vlbi observations that the ne core component has a more extended and complex morphology than the sw component , which could be caused by the extra mass at z@xmath00.193 .",
    "hence , our results regarding the mass of the lens at z@xmath00.886 and the lower limit to the redshift of the source are quite robust and we can make the following postulates :    1 .",
    "the lensing galaxy is an early type spiral galaxy seen at a low inclination ( @xmath137 ) .",
    "the mass within a radius of @xmath83kpc is in the range @xmath138m@xmath77 , which is similar , within a factor 2 , to the milky way galaxy .",
    "the redshift of the background source is large , most likely z@xmath139 .",
    "frye et al . (",
    "1997 ) observed pks1830211 with the bima millimeter array and found hco@xmath1(2@xmath21 ) absorption only over the sw component , as we do .",
    "however , the absorption line over this region did not reach zero level , indicating a filling factor of 70 - 80% .",
    "this would mean that the prospect of using single dish instruments to monitor the continuum and depth of saturated absorption lines with the aim of deriving the time delay between the ne and sw components can lead to ambiguities .",
    "however , interferometric imaging of an object at low elevations is difficult in the millimeter band and it is unclear how the accuracy of the interferometer data can be assessed . the flux ratio between the ne and sw continuum components in the bima data is @xmath30 . ]",
    "( frye et al . 1997 ) , compatible with our value at the same epoch , but their total flux is much higher that what we find , either with plateau de bure , iram30 m or sest . in any case",
    ", the covering factor is quite high , almost 1 for our measurements ( see table 1 ) , and is also compatible within 1 for the data of frye et al ( 1997 ) when their noise level is taken into account or if their continuum level is overestimated by a factor @xmath81.4 .",
    "we do not think that this uncertainty is the main one in the time ",
    "delay determination , the major uncertainty being the continuum level measurement .",
    "it is not unexpected that a molecular cloud covers entirely one of the pks1830211 image .",
    "the angular extent of the continuum emission region in the millimeter regime is not well known .",
    "the sw image remains unresolved in 15ghz vlba observations ( garrett et al .",
    "1996 ) at a resolution of @xmath140milliarcseconds ( mas ) .",
    "the ne component , however , is resolved with a complex structure .",
    "an angular extent of 0.2mas corresponds to @xmath81.1pc but the size of the continuum source at millimeter wavelengths can be considerably smaller .",
    "millimeter vlbi of the bl lac 3c446 found an upper limit to the angular extent of 30@xmath141arcseconds ( lerner et al .",
    "1993 ) .    in fig.7",
    "we show the spectrum of the hco@xmath1(2@xmath21 ) absorption obtained with the plateau de bure interferometer with a velocity resolution of 0.5kms@xmath3 .",
    "the profile is asymmetric with an extension towards negative velocities .",
    "this part of the profile is either optically thin or has a covering factor less than the narrow component .",
    "saturated absorption lines of a finite width should be flat  bottomed when viewed with a high velocity resolution .",
    "the bottom of the narrow profile shown in fig.7 appears to be deeper at negative velocities than at positive .",
    "the effect is only at the 1 - 2% level .",
    "however , a similar asymmetry is seen in the lower resolution hco@xmath1(2@xmath21 ) spectra obtained from both the iram 30m and sest telescopes ( fig.2 ) .",
    "this asymmetry could represent small differences in the covering factor of the saturated absorption , corresponding to linear dimensions of @xmath85% of the extent of the continuum source .",
    "we have reported further molecular lines in absorption towards pks1830211 , and in particular co(4@xmath23 ) , the first co line .",
    "molecular abundances are compatible with milky way values .",
    "we have also carried out interferometric measurements at three different epochs , and found that the magnification ratio between the two images has decreased from 1.8 to 1.0 during one year .",
    "these measurements confirm that the main v=0 absorbing component covers the sw image .",
    "we report about the detection of a second component at v=147.5kms@xmath3 , which covers only the ne image .",
    "the presence of two absorption lines , one corresponding to the sw image of the background source and the other to the ne component , implies that the background radio source is situated at a redshift @xmath133 , and is consistent with the lensing galaxy being an early type spiral seen almost face  on ( @xmath142 ) .",
    "a first determination of the time delay of 44@xmath69 days has been reported by van ommen et al .",
    "( 1995 ) . given the model dependence of this measurement",
    ", it will be quite useful to try other independent determinations at various frequencies .",
    "we confirm here that with the sw component being nearly completely absorbed at 3 mm , single dish measurements are rapid and effective for this experiment .",
    "it will however be necessary to confirm from time to time that the filling factor is still @xmath4 1 through interferometric measurement ( but this has not varied in the past year ) .",
    "the lens geometry could be made more complex by the presence of another galaxy on the line of sight , detected by hi absorption by lovell et al ( 1996 ) at z=0.1927 .",
    "we detect neither molecular absorption nor emission at this redshift ; the galaxy might not be exactly aligned with the quasar , which would minimise its lensing effect . alternatively , since the hi absorption is seen only towards the ne image , and molecular absorption has now been detected towards this component also , this z=0.1927 absorption could be re  interpreted as the absorption of a heavier molecule at z=0.88489 , the measured molecular redshift towards this ne component . exactly coinciding with this frequency",
    "we find the ( 7 - 1,0,7,6 ) transition of the ps molecule , in a low enough excitation state .",
    "this interpretation is not likely , however , due to the expected low abundance of ps in the ism .",
