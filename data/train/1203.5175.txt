    "the present paper studies interesting connections between abstract polytopes and edge - colored graphs .",
    "every properly edge - colored regular graph naturally gives rise to a simple abstract polytope , called its _ colorful polytope _ , built by following precise instructions encoded in the graph .",
    "we investigate several such families of polytopes and the interplay between their geometric , combinatorial , or algebraic properties and the combinatorial or algebraic structure of the underlying graph .",
    "the key idea of associating a combinatorial structure or a topological space with a properly edge - colored regular graph is not new and has been successfully exploited , usually in the dual setting , in the topological study of colored triangulations and crystallization of manifolds ( see bracho & montejano  @xcite , ferri , gagliardi & graselli  @xcite , pezzana  @xcite , lins & mandel  @xcite , vince  @xcite , and khnel  @xcite ) .",
    "here we take a polytopes approach and investigate these structures as simple abstract polytopes rather than simplicial complexes or triangulations , focussing on their geometric , combinatorial , and algebraic symmetry rather than their topology .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ secbasnot ]",
    "we review basic concepts for edge colorings of graphs and for abstract polytopes .",
    "then , in sections  [ polsfromgraphs ] and  [ autgrcol ] , we establish that the combinatorial structure derived from a properly edge - colored regular graph is an abstract polytope with @xmath3-skeleton isomorphic to the given graph , and determine its automorphism group . in section  [ flagpo ]",
    "we describe a colorful polytope , the _ flag adjacency polytope _ , associated with the flag graph of a given abstract polytope ; this flag graph is a combinatorial map in the sense  @xcite .",
    "then , in section  [ colcay ] , colorful polytopes of cayley graphs are investigated .",
    "in particular , we revisit the graphicahedron explored in @xcite .",
    "finally , section  [ mono ] explains how the flag - adjacency polytope of a given polytope is related to another colorful polytope , the _ monodromy polytope _ , of the monodromy group of the given polytope ( see hartley  @xcite and hubard , orbanic & weiss  @xcite ) .",
    "we begin by briefly reviewing some of the terminology for graphs and abstract polytopes . for further basic definitions and terminology",
    "see chartrand & lesniak  @xcite and mcmullen & schulte  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath1 be a finite connected simple graph , without loops or multiple edges and with vertex set @xmath4 and edge set @xmath5 .",
    "an _ edge coloring _ of @xmath1 is an assignment of colors to the edges of @xmath1 such that adjacent edges are colored differently .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath6 is a set of @xmath0 _ colors _ , then an _ @xmath0-edge coloring _ of @xmath1 with _ color set _",
    "@xmath6 is a mapping @xmath7 such that @xmath8",
    "if @xmath9 and @xmath10 are adjacent edges of @xmath1 . then the pair @xmath11 , usually simply denoted by @xmath1 , is called an _",
    "@xmath0-edge colored graph_. the graph @xmath1 is _",
    "@xmath0-edge colorable _ if there exists an @xmath0-edge coloring of @xmath1 .",
    "the minimum number @xmath0 for which @xmath1 is @xmath0-edge colorable is called its _ edge chromatic number _ , or _",
    "chromatic index _",
    ", in the literature usually denoted by @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath13 denote the maximum degree among the vertices of @xmath1 .",
    "clearly , @xmath14 . by a well - known result of vizing  @xcite",
    ", we also have @xmath15 .",
    "thus there are two kinds of graphs , those with @xmath16 , here said to be of _ type  1 _ , and those with @xmath17 , here said to be of _ type  2_. it was proved in erds & wilson  @xcite that the probability for a graph on @xmath18 vertices to be of type  1 approaches 1 as @xmath18 approaches @xmath19 .",
    "hence in general there are considerably more graphs of type 1 than graphs of type 2 .",
    "however , the problem of determining which graphs are of which type is unsolved .    the edge chromatic number of an @xmath20-regular graph @xmath1 is @xmath20 or @xmath21 .",
    "if @xmath1 is of type 1 , then any @xmath20-edge coloring determines @xmath20 edge - disjoint @xmath3-factors ( perfect matchings ) of @xmath1 , each given by one color class of edges ; in fact , each vertex of @xmath1 lies in exactly one edge of each color .",
    "conversely , it is easy to see that a connected @xmath20-regular graph whose edge set can be partitioned into @xmath20  @xmath3-factors ( that is , a _ 1-factorable graph _ ) is of type 1 .",
    "thus a connected @xmath20-regular graph is of type 1 if and only if it is 1-factorable .",
    "our main interest is in connected @xmath20-regular graphs @xmath22 of type @xmath3 , with vertex set @xmath4 , edge set @xmath5 , and an @xmath20-edge coloring map @xmath7 with color set @xmath6 .",
    "we refer to these as _ well _ ( _ edge _ ) _ colored @xmath20-regular graphs _ , or simply _ properly ( edge ) colored graphs_. we sometimes abuse notation and also denote by @xmath1 the underlying  uncolored \" graph of a properly ( edge ) colored graph . the complete graphs @xmath23 with an even number @xmath18 of vertices , the @xmath18-cycles @xmath24 with @xmath18 even and @xmath25 , and the regular bipartite graphs such as the heawood graph , and some other nice examples like the coxeter graph , are all examples of properly ( edge ) colored graphs ( see figure  [ heawood ] ) . moreover , every planar connected @xmath20-regular graph with @xmath26 is a properly ( edge ) colored graph ( see @xcite ) .",
    ".,width=680 ]    for a properly ( edge ) colored @xmath20-regular graph @xmath1 we let @xmath27 denote the graph automorphism group of the underlying `` uncolored '' graph , that is , the subgroup of permutations of the vertex set @xmath4 that preserve the edge set @xmath5 .",
    "there are two subgroups of @xmath27 that are associated with the @xmath20-edge coloring map @xmath7 and are of particular interest for us .",
    "they are obtained as follows .",
    "we say that an automorphism @xmath28 in @xmath27 is _ color preserving _ if @xmath28 maps every edge of @xmath1 to an edge with the same color ; that is , @xmath29 for each @xmath9 in @xmath5 . on the other hand",
    ", we say that an automorphism @xmath28 in @xmath27 is _ color respecting _ if any two edges of @xmath1 with the same color are mapped to edges that also have the same color ( which may be distinct from the first color ) ; that is , @xmath30 whenever @xmath31 are edges in @xmath5 with @xmath32 .",
    "naturally we now obtain two special subgroups of @xmath27 , namely the subgroup @xmath33 consisting of all color preserving automorphisms of @xmath1 , and the subgroup @xmath34 consisting of all color respecting automorphisms of @xmath1 .",
    "clearly every color preserving automorphism is also color respecting , so @xmath33 is a ( generally proper ) subgroup of @xmath35 .    in this paper",
    "we construct abstract polytopes from properly ( edge ) colored graphs . an ( _ abstract _ ) _ polytope of rank _",
    "@xmath0 , or simply an _ @xmath0-polytope _ , is a partially ordered set @xmath36 with a strictly monotone rank function with range @xmath37 satisfying the following conditions .",
    "the elements of rank @xmath38 are called the _",
    "@xmath38-faces _ of @xmath36 , or _",
    "vertices _ , _ edges _ and _ facets _ of @xmath36 if @xmath39 , @xmath3 or @xmath40 , respectively . each _ flag _ ( maximal totally ordered subset ) of @xmath36 contains exactly @xmath41 faces , including a unique minimal face @xmath42 ( of rank @xmath43 ) and a unique maximal face @xmath44 ( of rank @xmath0 ) .",
    "further , we ask that @xmath36 be _ strongly flag - connected _ , meaning that any two flags @xmath45 and @xmath46 of @xmath36 can be joined by a sequence of flags @xmath47 , all containing @xmath48 , such that @xmath49 and @xmath50 are _ adjacent _ ( differ by exactly one face ) for each @xmath51 .",
    "finally , @xmath52 satisfies the _ diamond condition _",
    ", namely if @xmath53 is a @xmath54-face and @xmath55 a @xmath56-face with @xmath57 , then there are exactly two @xmath38-faces @xmath58 such that @xmath59 .    when @xmath53 and @xmath55 are two faces of a polytope @xmath36 with @xmath60 , we call @xmath61 a _ section _ of @xmath36 .",
    "we usually identify a face @xmath53 with the section @xmath62 . for a face @xmath53 the section @xmath63",
    "is called the _ co - face of @xmath36 at _",
    "@xmath53 , or the _ vertex - figure at _",
    "@xmath53 if @xmath53 is a vertex .",
    "an abstract polytope is _ simple _ if all its vertex - figures are simplices .",
    "an _ automorphism _ of a polytope @xmath52 is a bijection of the set of faces of @xmath52 that preserves the order .",
    "the ( _ combinatorial _ ) _ automorphism group _ of an abstract polytope @xmath36 will be denoted by @xmath64 .",
    "as before , let @xmath1 denote a properly ( edge ) colored @xmath20-regular graph with an @xmath20-edge coloring map @xmath7 with color set @xmath6 of cardinality @xmath20 .",
    "the main goal of this section is to construct a simple abstract polytope @xmath2 of rank @xmath20 from @xmath1 in such a way that @xmath1 is the @xmath3-skeleton ( edge graph ) of @xmath2 .",
    "these polytopes are essentially the duals of the colored simplicial complexes or triangulations studied in bracho & montejano  @xcite .",
    "we begin by defining the face set and the partial order of @xmath2 , and then establish that this determines an abstract polytope of rank @xmath20 . to begin with",
    ", we require the following relations @xmath65 on @xmath4 , with @xmath66 , which are easily seen to be equivalence relations .",
    "two vertices @xmath67 and @xmath68 in @xmath4 are said to be _",
    "@xmath69-equivalent _ , or @xmath70 for short , if there exists an edge path of @xmath1 from @xmath67 to @xmath68 whose edges are colored with colors from @xmath69 .",
    "the face structure of the polytope @xmath2 can now be described as follows .    in describing the face structure of @xmath2 .",
    "it is convenient to initially suppress the face of rank @xmath43 and concentrate entirely on faces of non - negative ranks ; the missing @xmath71-face will be appended at the end .",
    "accordingly , we define the faces of rank @xmath72 by saying that the vertex set of a typical @xmath38-face @xmath53 of @xmath2 consists of all those vertices of @xmath1 that are connected to a given vertex @xmath67 of @xmath1 by an edge path using only colors from a given set @xmath69 of @xmath38 colors ; that is , the vertex set of @xmath53 consists of those vertices of @xmath1 that are equivalent to @xmath67 under @xmath65 . when @xmath73 this determines the vertices of @xmath74 and establishes @xmath4 as the full vertex set of @xmath74 ; and when @xmath75 we obtain the unique @xmath20-face @xmath76 ( with vertex set @xmath4 ) .",
    "thus , a typical @xmath38-face @xmath53 of @xmath2 can be represented as a pair @xmath77 , where @xmath67 is a vertex of @xmath1 and @xmath69 is a @xmath38-subset of @xmath6 .",
    "we then write @xmath78",
    ". it will become clear that , once the partial order on the faces of @xmath74 has been defined , the vertex set of a face @xmath53 coincides precisely with the @xmath79-faces of @xmath74 incident to @xmath53 . in general",
    ", a face of @xmath74 can have many possible designations .",
    "in fact , @xmath80 if and only @xmath81 and @xmath67 can be obtained from @xmath68 ( and hence @xmath68 from @xmath67 ) by a path of edges involving only colors from @xmath69 .    given a @xmath38-face @xmath78 and a @xmath82-face @xmath83 of @xmath2 as above , we say that @xmath84 if and only if the vertex set of @xmath53 is contained in the vertex set of @xmath55 ; that is , @xmath84 if and only if @xmath85 ( and hence @xmath86 ) and @xmath67 can be obtained from @xmath68 by a path involving only edges with colors from @xmath87 .",
    "this is consistent with our definition of equality of faces .    proceeding with the general discussion",
    ", we can immediately make one observation .",
    "if @xmath78 and @xmath83 are two faces of @xmath2 of non - negative rank with @xmath84 , then necessarily @xmath88 ; in other words , in designating the larger face we may replace @xmath68 by @xmath67 .",
    "this immediately follows from the definition of the partial order , since @xmath84 implies that @xmath67 can be obtained from @xmath68 by moving along a path involving only edges with colors from @xmath87 . as an important consequence ,",
    "any chain of mutually incident faces of @xmath2 of non - negative rank can be represented in such a way that their second components all coincide with the second component of the smallest face in this chain . in particular",
    ", this applies to representations of flags ( for now , flags do not contain the @xmath71-face ) .",
    "we claim that @xmath2 , partially ordered as described , is an abstract polytope of rank @xmath20 .",
    "clearly , the rank of @xmath2 is @xmath20 .",
    "in fact , every flag is of the form @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is a @xmath38-face for each @xmath91 , with @xmath92 and @xmath67 independent of @xmath38 .",
    "a _ maximal nested _ family of subsets of a given finite set is a flag in the boolean lattice associated with this set .",
    "( we use this terminology to avoid confusion with the flags of @xmath2 . )",
    "our previous considerations show that each flag @xmath45 of @xmath2 is determined by two parameters , a single vertex @xmath67 of @xmath1 and a maximal nested family @xmath93 of subsets of the color set @xmath6 .",
    "we then write @xmath94    it is also immediate that each flag @xmath95 has exactly one _ @xmath38-adjacent _ flag @xmath96 for each @xmath97 , differing from @xmath45 in just the @xmath38-face . when @xmath98 , any flag @xmath38-adjacent to @xmath45 can be represented with the same second parameter , @xmath67 , and the same color sets except for the color set at position @xmath38 . since @xmath99 is a @xmath54-subset of the @xmath56-subset @xmath100 , there are exactly two @xmath38-subsets @xmath69 such that @xmath101 , one given by @xmath102 itself .",
    "hence , there is just one flag @xmath38-adjacent to @xmath45 , namely the flag determined by the other @xmath38-subset @xmath69 .",
    "this settles the case @xmath98 .",
    "now when @xmath39 , suppose that @xmath68 is the vertex of @xmath1 adjacent to @xmath67 by the edge colored with the single color from @xmath103 .",
    "then @xmath104 is a flag @xmath79-adjacent to @xmath45 , and this is the only such flag .",
    "it remains to establish the strong flag - connectedness of @xmath2 .",
    "here it is helpful to know the structure of the vertex - figures of @xmath2 .",
    "now , if @xmath105 is any vertex of @xmath2 and @xmath77 and @xmath106 are two faces incident with @xmath105 , then @xmath107 in @xmath2 if and only if @xmath85 .",
    "hence , the vertex - figure of @xmath2 at @xmath105 is isomorphic to the @xmath108-simplex , or equivalently , the boolean lattice on the color set @xmath6 .",
    "thus , all vertex - figures of @xmath2 are @xmath108-simplices and in particular are flag - connected .",
    "[ flagconn ] @xmath2 is strongly flag - connected .",
    "we need to establish that , if @xmath45 and @xmath46 are two flags of @xmath2 , then there exists a sequence of successively adjacent flags @xmath109 of @xmath2 such that @xmath110 for all @xmath111",
    ".    let @xmath112 and @xmath113 be two flag of @xmath74 , where @xmath114 and @xmath115 are two maximal nested families of subsets of @xmath6 .",
    "define @xmath116 and observe that @xmath117 since @xmath118 .",
    "let @xmath119 denote the smallest suffix in @xmath120 .",
    "we now exploit the connectedness of @xmath1 to construct the sequence of flags .",
    "since @xmath121 , we know that @xmath122 and that @xmath67 can be joined to @xmath68 by a path of length @xmath18 ( say ) involving only edges of @xmath1 with colors from @xmath123 . if @xmath124 , then necessarily @xmath125 and @xmath126 . if @xmath127 , then only the edge colored with the color in @xmath103 is involved in the path and we may take @xmath128",
    ".    the proof proceeds by induction on @xmath18 .",
    "when @xmath126 , the vertices @xmath67 and @xmath68 of @xmath1 coincide , so we can simply appeal to the strong flag - connectedness of the vertex - figure of @xmath74 at @xmath105 to find the desired sequence of flags .",
    "now , let @xmath129 .",
    "then necessarily @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "suppose @xmath132 is the sequence of successively adjacent vertices in a path from @xmath67 to @xmath68 in @xmath1 all of whose edges are colored with colors from @xmath123 .",
    "the key inductive step in the proof is to first join the given flag @xmath95 , by a suitable sequence of successively adjacent flags , to a new flag @xmath133 associated with the vertex @xmath134 and with a maximal nested family @xmath135 of subsets of @xmath6 .",
    "once this has been accomplished , we then further extend this first sequence by a suitable second sequence of successively adjacent flags joining @xmath136 and @xmath46 ; the existence of this second sequence is guaranteed by the inductive hypothesis for @xmath137 , applied to @xmath136 and @xmath46 . finally , when concatenated , these two sequences yield the desired sequence joining @xmath45 to @xmath46 .",
    "we begin by constructing @xmath136 .",
    "let @xmath138 denote the color of the edge joining @xmath67 to @xmath139 . then notice that in @xmath2 we have @xmath140 since @xmath141 ( recall the definition of @xmath119 ) and @xmath142 and @xmath67 are joined by an edge colored @xmath143 .",
    "we now proceed in three steps .",
    "first , by ( [ obs ] ) we can find a flag @xmath144 ( say ) which has @xmath145 as its @xmath79-face and @xmath146 as its @xmath3-face and also includes the entire set @xmath48 ; when @xmath127 we can take @xmath147 . then , since @xmath45 and @xmath144 share a vertex and the vertex - figures are strongly flag - connected , we can join @xmath45 and @xmath144 by a sequence of successively adjacent flags , all containing @xmath148 and hence also @xmath48 .",
    "second , replace the @xmath79-face of @xmath144 by @xmath149 to obtain a new flag @xmath150 which is @xmath79-adjacent to @xmath144 . then extend the already existing sequence of flags joining @xmath45 to @xmath144 by this new flag @xmath150 .",
    "third , take any maximal nested family @xmath151 of subsets of @xmath6 with @xmath152 and @xmath153 for each @xmath154 , and define @xmath155 note that a maximal nested family @xmath135 of this kind exists since @xmath156 and @xmath157 for each @xmath154 .",
    "then it is immediately clear that @xmath136 shares a vertex with @xmath150 and also contains @xmath158 ; here the latter follows from the fact that @xmath159 for each @xmath154 . now we can complete the argument by appealing once more to the flag - connectedness of the vertex - figures .",
    "in fact , since @xmath136 and @xmath150 have a vertex in common , we can find a sequence of successively adjacent flags from @xmath150 to @xmath136 , which all contain @xmath160 and hence also @xmath48 .",
    "we now have connected @xmath45 and @xmath136 by a flag sequence , via @xmath144 and @xmath150 .",
    "it is immediately clear from the construction that the @xmath3-skeleton of @xmath2 is isomorphic to @xmath1 . in our subsequent discussion",
    "we usually identify the @xmath3-skeleton of @xmath2 with @xmath1 and simply denote its vertices @xmath105 and edges @xmath161 by @xmath67 or @xmath162 , respectively .",
    "notice also that the vertex - figures of @xmath74 are @xmath108-simplices , so in particular each vertex of @xmath2 is contained in @xmath163 flags .",
    "each facet of @xmath2 is of the form @xmath164 , where @xmath165 is a color in @xmath6 and @xmath67 is a vertex of @xmath1 .",
    "the pair @xmath166 determines a connected properly ( edge ) colored @xmath108-regular graph @xmath167 with color set @xmath168 , namely the connected component of @xmath67 in the new graph @xmath169 obtained from @xmath1 by deleting all the edges of @xmath1 colored @xmath165 .",
    "then the facet @xmath164 of @xmath2 is isomorphic to the colorful polytope @xmath170 of rank @xmath171 associated with this graph @xmath167 .",
    "conversely , given any color @xmath165 of @xmath6 and any vertex @xmath67 of @xmath1 , the corresponding connected component of @xmath67 in @xmath172 gives rise to a facet of @xmath2 of the form @xmath164 in this manner .    in summary ,",
    "we have established the following theorem .",
    "[ mainthm ] let @xmath1 be a connected properly ( edge ) colored @xmath20-regular graph .",
    "then @xmath2 is an abstract polytope of rank @xmath20 , called the _ colorful polytope associated with @xmath1_. in particular , @xmath2 is a simple polytope with @xmath3-skeleton isomorphic to @xmath1 .",
    "the facets of @xmath2 are in one - to - one correspondence with the colorful polytopes of rank @xmath171 associated with the connected components of the graph obtained from @xmath1 by the deletion of the edges in a single color class .",
    "figures  [ k4 ] and  [ botella ] illustrate two small examples of colorful polyhedra ( polytopes of rank @xmath173 ) .",
    "the first is the hemi - cube @xmath174 , a regular map on the projective plane obtained from the properly ( edge ) colored @xmath173-regular graph given by the ( unique ) @xmath3-factorization of @xmath175 .",
    "note here that the colorful polyhedron @xmath176 is not ( isomorphic to ) a convex polyhedron , although the underlying graph @xmath175 does of course occur as the 1-skeleton of a convex polyhedron , namely the tetrahedron .",

    "similarly , the first edge @xmath218 and the last edge @xmath219 in ( [ epath ] ) are not edges of @xmath229 .",
    "hence , if our previous observations are applied with @xmath230 and @xmath231 or @xmath232 , we immediately see that the edges @xmath218 and @xmath219 must be colored with the color not being used on @xmath229 . more explicitly , if @xmath233 ( say ) , then @xmath234 , as desired .",
    "this concludes the proof in the special case when none of the edges @xmath220 in ( [ epath ] ) has the color @xmath192 .",
    "finally , in the general case we can simply view the sequence in ( [ epath ] ) as a concatenation of subsequences in which only the first edge and the last edge have the same color @xmath192 as @xmath9 and @xmath213 ( in particular , none of the intermediate edges in a subsequence has color @xmath192 ) .",
    "in fact , if @xmath235 with @xmath236 , are all the edges of the sequence ( [ epath ] ) which have color @xmath192 , then for every @xmath237 the subsequence @xmath238 is of the required type and hence @xmath239 .",

    "in particular , if @xmath2 is regular , then the natural homomorphism @xmath241 defined earlier is surjective , so every permutation of colors in @xmath6 can be realized by an automorphism of @xmath1 ( and @xmath36 ) .",
    "it would be interesting to know which properly ( edge ) colored graphs have maximum possible symmetry of this kind .",
    "every abstract polytope naturally gives rise to a colorful polytope , its flag - adjacency polytope , that is closely related to its monodromy polytope describe in section  [ mono ] .",
