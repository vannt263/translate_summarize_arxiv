    "the large - momentum divergence in the cooper pair ( cp ) problem @xcite was originally eliminated by a momentum - space cutoff introduced in what is now known as the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) model interaction which was also successfully used by bcs in the study of conventional low - temperature superconductors @xcite . on the other hand , the short coherence length of some high-@xmath0 superconductors @xcite possibly implies a stronger interfermion interaction .  in the limit of very strong",
    "coupling one gets well - isolated `` diatomic molecules '' or dimers of fermions , as opposed to strongly overlapping cps in the weak - coupling limit of bcs superconductivity @xcite . in strong coupling",
    "these dimers can conceivably undergo bose - einstein ( be ) condensation ( bec ) .",
    "although there is considerable controversy over the precise pairing dynamics in so - called `` exotic '' @xcite  superconductors , tracking this many - body problem from strong to weak coupling  known as the bcs - bose crossover  has promoted the understanding of various properties of exotic materials @xcite .    here",
    "we focus on how cooper pairing itself evolves from weak to strong coupling .",
    "we also study the excitation of cps with nonzero center - of - mass momentum ( cmm ) , which should play an important role in a superconducting or superfluid transition of the many - fermion system simultaneously exhibiting both bcs and be condensates as in the formulation by friedberg and lee @xcite and more generally by tolmachev @xcite .",
    "the bcs model interaction simulates a phonon - mediated force which is effective in explaining the isotopic effect by appropriate momentum - space cutoffs placed symmetrically on either side of the fermi surface @xcite",
    ". however , exotic materials do not exhibit such systematic isotopic effects . also , as coupling increases the chemical potential @xmath1 decreases in value from the ( positive ) fermi energy @xmath2 ( its value at zero temperature and zero interaction ) , and even turns negative as the so - called bose regime is entered @xcite .",
    "the fermi surface then washes out , eliminating any physical motivation for the bcs model interaction with fermi - surface dependent cutoffs .",
    "alternatively , in the bcs - bose crossover a renormalization procedure @xcite may be used to handle the large - momentum divergences .",
    "this leads to a renormalized dynamical model expressible in terms of physical observables of the system rather than _ ad hoc _ cutoffs .    here",
    "we derive renormalized @xmath3-matrix and cooper equations for a pair of fermions which move in vacuum and in the fermi sea , respectively . in three dimensions ( 3d )",
    "cooper binding is expressed in terms of the two - fermion scattering length in vacuum . for a cp with a nonzero cmm",
    "we define a pair excitation energy as the ( positive ) difference between the cp binding energy at zero and at a finite cmm . for high fermion density and any coupling only a _ linear _ term in cmm",

    "@xcite , p. 33).at",
    "any coupling and for vanishing fermion - number density a _ quadratic _",
    "term dominates which is just the kinetic energy of the composite pair .",
    "the crossover from a linear to a quadratic dispersion for the pair excitation energy is then illustrated via numerical calculations .",
    "the cp dispersion relation enters the be distribution function of the boson number equation from which @xmath0 is extracted @xcite . the linear cp dispersion relation for weak coupling leads to novel phase - transition properties in either a heuristic @xcite or a first - principles @xcite bec picture of superconductivity as be - condensing cps .",
    "it is common knowledge that bec is possible only for dimensions @xmath4 for bosons with quadratic dispersion ; this limitation reappears in virtually all bec schemes thus far applied to explain superconductivity @xcite .",
    "but for bosons with a _ linear _ dispersion relation found here in weak and medium coupling , bec can now occur for all @xmath5 .",

    "such an interaction model may mimic a wide variety of short - range effective interactions : a force mediated by phonons , plasmons , excitons , magnons , etc . or even a purely electronic interaction .",

    "( [ 11 ] ) which we take both for a small but non - zero @xmath87 and for @xmath69 , and then subtract one equation from the other . a small - cmm expansion of the resultant equation leads to the weak coupling expression @xmath88 where a positive _ cp excitation energy _",
    "@xmath89 has been defined , and the fermi velocity @xmath90 is given by @xmath91 .",
    "the coefficient of the linear term depends _ only _ on properties of the fermi sea and not on any parameters of the potential .",
    "in contrast , the complete excitation energy does depend on the coupling parameter @xmath92    it is this excitation energy that must enter the be distribution function in determining the critical temperature in a picture of superconductivity as a bec of cps @xcite .",
    "the leading term in ( [ dk3 ] ) is linear in the cmm , followed by a quadratic term .",
    "but it is only for sufficiently small fermion density , i.e. , when @xmath42 or @xmath93 , and for _ any _ nonzero coupling , that the quadratic term dominates , viz . , @xmath94 the familiar nonrelativistic kinetic energy of the composite pair of mass @xmath95 and cmm h-.2em.2em @xmath86 .",
    "as mentioned , it is this dispersion relation that has been assumed in virtually all bec studies of superconductivity @xcite .",
    "however , recent calculations of root - mean - square radii in two ( 2d ) and three ( 3d ) dimensions in the bcs - bose crossover scheme , when compared with experimental coherence lengths of several typical 2d cuprates @xcite as well as of 3d materials @xcite , suggest that they are describable well within the bcs ( weak - coupling ) regime and away from the bose ( strong - coupling ) one .",
    "this implies that the _ linear _ approximation to the dispersion relation would be relevant in these cases , and that perhaps a more general description of the bec of cps for all coupling might require the exact dispersion relation .    in fig .",

    "1 . the linear approximation eq .",
    "( [ dk3 ] ) is valid only in the very weak - coupling and/or high fermion density limit .",
    "the quadratic term dominates only at vanishing density , for any nonzero coupling . for finite - range interaction the crossover in fig .",
    "2 is characterized by an inflection point with positive slope while for zero - range there is no such inflection point .",
    "the single - cp problem treated here may appear academic at first .",
    "however , it has serious consequences .",
    "our cps are taken as `` bosonic '' even though they do _ not _ obey ( ref.@xcite p. 38 ) bose commutation relations .",
    "this is because for a given @xmath86 they have _ indefinite _ occupation number since for fixed @xmath86 there are ( in the thermodynamic limit ) an indefinitely large number of allowed ( relative wavenumber ) @xmath32 values .",
    "hence , for any coupling  and thus any degree of overlap between them ",
    "cps do in fact obey the bose - einstein distribution from which bec is determined .",
    "there have been attempts @xcite to formulate the superfluid and superconducting transition problem in a many - fermion system by accommodating both be and bcs condensed phases . in these studies ,",
    "the bcs ( be ) condensed phase dominates for weak ( strong ) coupling . for intermediate coupling one could have both types of condensation with a certain density of cp bosons ( fermions ) available for be ( bcs ) condensation",
    "however , the full boson dispersion relation should be used to calculate the bec transition temperature .",
    "the linear dispersion relation of a cp _ should not _ be confused with the linear dispersion of anderson - bogoliubov - higgs ( abh ) many - body excitation phonon - like modes .",
    "collective modes in a superconductor were studied since the late 1950 s by several workers .  a more recent treatment for 1d , 2d and 3d is available @xcite which confirms the linear abh form @xmath105 for @xmath106 = 1 , 2 or 3 in the zero - coupling limit .",
    "abh phonons ( like photons or plasmons , etc . )",
    "_ can not _ suffer a bec as their number is always indefinite .",
    "the number of cps , on the other hand , is _ fixed _ , say , at half the number of ( pairable ) fermions if all of these are imagined paired .",
    "the above crossover of linear to quadratic forms of the cp dispersion relation was also found in 2d @xcite so that we include both 2d and 3d cases in the following discussion of the bec transition temperature @xmath0 .",
    "the 2d case is specially interesting as @xmath0 is zero for the usual quadratic dispersion relation of cp bosons but _ nonzero _ for linear dispersion .",
    "the general bec @xmath0 formula for bosons in any dimension @xmath106 and with a general boson dispersion relation @xmath107 , for @xmath108  @xmath109 , is  given @xcite for @xmath110 by @xmath111 ^{s / d } ,   \\label{gentc}\\ ] ] but _ vanishes _ for @xmath112 .",

    "@xmath119 ( [ gentc ] ) leads to the familiar @xmath0 formula @xmath120 @xcite and to the fact that @xmath121 for all @xmath122 .",
    "for the _ linear _ dispersion case @xmath123 , and consequently @xmath121 for all @xmath124 and @xmath125 for all @xmath126 .",
    "the latter is precisely the range of effective dimensionalities for all known superconductors if one includes the quasi-1d organo - metallic bechgaard salts @xcite .    before discussing the consequences of the @xmath0 formula ( [ gentc ] ) with @xmath123 in superconductivity",
    ", we stress its limitations .",
    "firstly , this @xmath0 formula with @xmath123 is derived with the linear dispersion relation predominant for weak to moderate coupling , while the full correct dispersion relation should be used in general .",
    "secondly , in deriving this formula we have taken the full momentum space of cp bosons so that the momentum integrals run from 0 to @xmath127 , whereas we have seen that the cps break up above some specific momentum value so the integrals should run only from 0 to the breakup @xmath128 .",
    "thirdly , the effect of unpaired fermions in the background is ignored .",
    "nevertheless , preliminary study shows @xcitethat once we remove these three limitations the result ( [ gentc ] ) for @xmath129 does not change drastically .    if one assumes that _ all _ fermions are paired into cp bosons so that the boson density @xmath113 is @xmath130 with @xmath131 @xmath132 the fermion density in the normal state , eq .",
    "( [ gentc ] ) with @xmath123 leads to huge values of @xmath0 @xmath133 k for weak to intermediate coupling  the region of interest in superconductivity even though @xmath0 empirically is at most about @xmath134 @xmath135 k. however , the number of paired fermions vulnerable to bec is strongly coupling - dependent and generally @xcite  is only a small fraction of all the fermions so that @xmath113 in eq .",
    "( [ gentc ] ) is effectively much smaller than @xmath130 .",
    "thus , a realistic @xmath0 is certainly feasible . in the extreme weak coupling limit @xmath136 ,",
    "driving the bec @xmath0 to zero and allowing the bcs theory to be recovered from analyses as in refs .",
    "@xcite . for higher",
    "coupling @xmath113 increases so that one accommodates both be and bcs condensates .",
    "one can surmise that in a realistic theory of superconductivity be and bcs condensates play their respective roles .",
    "elaborate calculations must still be performed with the exact cp dispersion in order to find a more accurate @xmath0 for this many - body system .",
    "the single cp problem with non - zero cmm is studied as it evolves ( or _ crosses _ _ over _ ) by varying the interfermion short - range pair interaction from weak to strong .",
    "the cp excitation energy is exhibited as a function of its cmm . for weak coupling",
    "the correct excitation energy is a _ linear _ dispersion relation in the cmm , which changes gradually to a _",
    "quadratic _ relation as coupling increases and/or density is reduced to the vacuum limit .",
    "these results will play a critical role in a model of superconductivity that includes both bcs and be condensates @xcite . with a quadratic dispersion the bec @xmath121 in 2d , from which one might infer that bec is irrelevant for quasi-2d cuprate superconductivity .",
    "however , even in 2d , nonzero bec transition temperatures emerge for weak and medium coupling where the linear dispersion relation is found to dominate @xcite , thus vindicating the relevance of bec for such materials . the pioneering attempts @xcite developing a model of superconductivity accommodating be and bcs condensates both assumed the quadratic dispersion relation for _ unbreakable _ cps for all coupling . it would be interesting to reformulate those studies using the proper dispersion relation with a _ finite _ breakup momentum .",
    "lastly , although our study is based on a separable potential we expect our conclusions on the cp dispersion to be valid more generally , and applicable to superconductivity , and to neutral - atom superfluidity such as in liquid @xmath137he and in trapped fermi gases@xcite .",

    "( [ 9 ] ) can be written as @xmath138 where @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",

    "for @xmath146 , @xmath147 , one root of the two pairs is positive and the other negative .",

    "<S> a coupling - independent _ linear _ term in the cmm dominates the pair excitation energy in weak coupling and/or high fermion density , while the more familiar quadratic term prevails only in the extreme low - density ( i.e. , vacuum ) limit for any nonzero coupling . </S>",
    "<S> the linear - to - quadratic crossover of the cp dispersion relation is analyzed numerically , and is expected to play a central role in a model of superconductivity ( and superfluidity ) simultaneously accommodating a bcs condensate as well as a bose - einstein condensate of cp bosons .    </S>",
