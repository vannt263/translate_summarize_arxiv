    "the qsh state was first predicted  @xcite and observed  @xcite in hgte / cdte quantum wells .",
    "electron - hole hybridization and the indication of a topological insulator phase were reported in inas / gasb quantum wells in recent transport experiments  @xcite .",
    "one important requirement to observe the 2d ti phase in electronic transport is to fabricate devices smaller than the inelastic scattering length ( l@xmath0 ) . in reality , due to limited material quality often bulk transport is relevant and masks edge channel transport  @xcite .",
    "moreover , edge scattering originating from rough edges as a result of fabrication processes , can also be detrimental to the observation of helical edge states  @xcite .",
    "apart from being an emerging candidate for 2d ti , this system offers the potential to observe several physical phenomena such as exciton condensation  @xcite , majorana fermions  @xcite , or edge mode superconductivity  @xcite . in comparison to the hgte / cdte system , inas /",

    "the electronic confinement in narrow 2degs depends a lot on the material system and particularly on the fabrication processes .",
    "for example , quasi-1d channels fabricated by reactive ion etching ( rie ) in inas 2degs  @xcite show a degradation of the mobility due to surface damage caused by the energetic ions along with lateral side wall depletion .",
    "electronic transport in sub - micron devices of inas  @xcite and insb  @xcite based 2d systems were studied extensively . however , mesoscopic transport in inas / gasb systems is relatively unexplored . compared to the pure inas well , the presence of a gasb layer may change the depletion width and the confinement potential .",
    "hence , it is necessary to explore the mesoscopic properties of inas / gasb devices for reaching an optimized fabrication recipe .    here , we present a detailed characterization of a series of mesoscopic hall bar devices made by dry and wet etching processes ( see table  i for details ) . the effective electronic width ( @xmath12 )",
    "was determined by measuring the low field magneto - resistance peak appearing due to partially diffusive boundary scattering  @xcite .",

    "transport measurements on large hall bars ( @xmath31m@xmath32 m ) fabricated by both dry and wet etching possess similar carrier - mobilities and gate tunability as in ref .  .",

    "this results in a positive zero - field mr reaching a maximum at a field @xmath10 ( indicated by arrows in figure  1c and 1d ) when the ratio of the wire width ( @xmath12 ) and the cyclotron radius ( @xmath35 ) follows the relation  @xcite @xmath36 , where @xmath37 , is the fermi wave vector . in the top left inset of figure  2a",

    "boundary scattering was observed mainly for high mobility electrons as @xmath13 exceeds the device dimension only for densities larger than @xmath43 @xmath6 .",
    "no ballistic effects were observed for holes in this temperature range due to the low mobility and high effective mass .",
    "the roughness of the boundary can qualitatively be evaluated by calculating the quantity @xmath44",
    "@xcite , where , @xmath45 , which is zero for completely specular boundary scattering . from figure  1c and 1d , we see that @xmath44 is @xmath46 for device  d1 and @xmath47 for device  d9 , confirming the smoother edge for the wet etched device ( see table  i for other devices ) .",
    "next we concentrate on the density ( @xmath39 ) dependence of the electronic width ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "figure  2a shows the density dependence of three dry - etched devices ( devices d1 , d2 , d4 ) with mean @xmath1 @xmath48 m , @xmath49 m and @xmath50 m , respectively .",
    "for all the three devices , @xmath12 was found to decrease with decreasing electron density . for device",
    "d2 ( @xmath51 m ) , @xmath12 saturates at around @xmath52 m above a density @xmath53 @xmath6 and decreases to @xmath54 m at @xmath55 @xmath6 , the lowest density where the mr peak was observed . below this density",
    "the holes start populating the gasb layer and transport is governed by both electrons and holes , where we see the signature of two band transport in both longitudinal and hall resistance  @xcite . for devices  d1 and d4 ( @xmath56 m ) , the saturation was not observed due to the limited gate range , however , a similar decrease in @xmath12 was observed .",
    "figure  2b shows the density dependence of @xmath12 for all the wet - etched devices with a mean @xmath1 ranging between @xmath57 m . for devices with @xmath58 m ( device  d7 ) and @xmath59 m ( device  d6 ) ,",
    "@xmath12 was found to be @xmath60 m and @xmath61 m , respectively , with little variation with density . for devices",
    "d9 ( @xmath62 m ) and d10 ( @xmath63 m ) , @xmath12 shows a similar value @xmath64 m . due to the larger etching depth for device d9 ( @xmath65 m ) the side wall etching is expected to be more compared to device  d10 ( etching depth @xmath66  nm ) and may provide coincidentally similar @xmath12 .",
    "the density dependence of @xmath67 ( figure  2 ) suggests a steeper confinement potential for wet - etched devices compared to the dry - etched ones ( see insets of figure  2a and 2b ) , however , the exact shape of the confinement potential is difficult to model .    the depletion width is often used in literature to judge the quality of etching processes , defined as @xmath68 .",
    "as @xmath12 varies with density for dry - etched devices , the depletion width is also not constant unlike for wet - etched devices , where @xmath12 remains constant with density . to get a reasonable comparison for the depletion width values ,",
    "we have plotted average @xmath12 as a function of @xmath1 only for the wet - etched devices in the top inset of figure  2b .",
    "the red dashed line indicates the line corresponding to @xmath69 . in wet etching",
    "we often find double step and corrugation at the edges due to the different etching rates for layers with different materials , in contrary to the dry etching where the etching is uniform ( see figure  1a and 1b ) .",
    "this may lead to a larger uncertainty in determining the actual @xmath1 for the wet - etched devices .",
    "we find @xmath70 to be in the range @xmath71 m , which is rather large compared to the pure inas quantum well devices  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the lateral depletion was found to increase for wider devices , which is counterintuitive .",
    "we also looked at the @xmath70 as a function of etching depth .",
    "however , no systematic dependence of @xmath70 with etching depth was observed in these four devices .",
    "qualitatively , in these devices we found that the gate capacitance per unit area ( @xmath72 ) decreases for narrower devices .",
    "for a narrow channel with an ideal edge , one expects to have enhanced gate tunability due to the fringing field lines near the edge .",
    "we speculate that due to the etching process there could be depositions of non - volatile components , ionic charges _ etc .",
    "_ ,  @xcite",
    ". these etchant residues may create charge traps near the edges which may be populated by the application of gate voltage .",
    "these trapped charges may screen the gate voltage , as well as modify the confinement potential in the lateral direction .",
    "we plan to look into the influence of etching processes on the local and non - local electronic transport properties .",
    "further work is necessary to reduce the bulk conduction either by improving the material quality or impurity doping  @xcite to observe the quantum spin hall effect in this system .",
    "in conclusion , we have been able to fabricate and characterize mesoscopic devices of inas / gasb quantum well , made by two different etching processes .",
    "the electronic width was obtained from the low field magneto - resistance peak appearing due to boundary scattering . for dry - etched devices",
    "the electronic width decreases with lowering electron density , whereas , it remains constant for wet - etched devices .",
    "our observations suggest that wet chemical etching is less invasive compared to the dry - etching and could be preferable to produce mesoscopic devices for studying topological insulators .",
