    "progress in the next decade ( and most probably even longer ) in high energy physics will be totally overshadowed by the results expected from the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern ( geneva ) where high energy protons will collide at an unprecedented center of mass energy of 14 tev , any time soon .",
    "for quite some time , theorists claim that the success of the standard model ( sm ) of the unified electroweak interactions and of strong interactions can not be understood , unless it is a low energy realization of a more sophisticated construct , which should manifest itself already at tev scales .",
    "it still remains to be seen whether the standard model higgs , whose mass is constrained by precision electroweak measurements  @xcite , is realized in nature .",
    "a low mass of the sm higgs , about 120 gev , creates the so - called hierarchy problem , that is the need at high energy for a tremendous fine - tuning of quantum - loop corrections to keep the higgs mass light enough for it to be relevant for electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the favored candidates for the new horizon are supersymmetric ( susy ) theories and/or theories with universal extra - dimensions ( ued ) .",
    "there are many realizations of these theories ( see  @xcite for a recent overview ) .",
    "their common denominator is the appearance of new particles or states , which will be signaled by a departure of the measured cross sections from expectations of the sm .",
    "the generic lhc signatures of susy models are isolated leptons , few energetic jets and , for @xmath2-parity conserving susy , large missing transverse energy  @xcite . similar signatures may be expected in the various realizations of the ued theories  @xcite .",
    "these signatures may also originate from the sm , dominated by hard qcd interactions . in the context of lhc physics",
    ", qcd constitutes the background ( though for many it is in itself a interesting laboratory for the dynamics of high energy qcd ) .",
    "the question is then how reliable is the background estimate .",
    "this is where the qcd studies at the hera @xmath3 collider become very relevant , though the energy scales are mostly lower than the ones expected at lhc .",
    "the same could be said of the tevatron @xmath4 collider studies , if not for the fact that the problems encountered at the tevatron can only become worse at the lhc . and this is because of the composite nature of hadrons , nucleons in this particular case , which have a rich dynamical internal structure , that can not be derived from perturbative qcd .",
    "this structure is directly probed in the deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) of leptons on hadrons .",
    "the reactions that will be mostly investigated at the lhc are hard @xmath5 interactions in which partons in the proton , quarks and gluons , interact producing either high transverse momentum partons that materialize in the form of hadronic jets or new heavy particles which decay into leptonic and/or hadronic final states .",
    "the cross section for the hard interactions can be calculated in perturbative qcd , though to a limited precision due to higher order corrections .",
    "the hadronization process is soft in nature and requires modeling . due to the complicated nature of resulting final states , even the expectations from pure qcd processes require mc simulation , which limit the precision with which the qcd background can be estimated .",
    "there are the following four components in modeling hadronic final states in hard @xmath5 collisions  @xcite : + * 1 .",
    "the hard subprocess at the parton level*. at leading order it is a @xmath6 process and the cross section is expressed through @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the transverse momentum of the outgoing partons @xmath9 and @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the squared center of mass energy of the partonic scattering , with @xmath12 the @xmath5 center of mass energy squared and @xmath13 the fraction of the proton momenta carried by the incoming partons @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the cross section for parton scattering is given by @xmath16 , calculable in perturbative qcd , and the probability of finding the partons in the proton is given by the parton density functions ( pdf ) @xmath17 , where the hard scale @xmath1 is assumed to be @xmath18 .",
    "the variables @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the usual mandelstam variables ; + * 2 .",
    "initial and final state gluon radiation * from the interacting partons , which is meant to mimic higher order qcd processes ; + *",
    "3 . additional semi - hard or hard interactions * between the remaining partons .",
    "they arise naturally in that the integrated cross section given by  ( [ eq : sigma ] ) diverges for low @xmath8 values and @xmath22 becomes bigger than the total cross section , unless multi - parton interactions ( mpi ) are introduced ; + * 4 .",
    "hadronization * , the formation of hadrons from partons and from beam remnants .",
    "each of these steps is subject to modeling and various monte carlo generators  @xcite adopt different approaches , in particular for the last three steps .",
    "each one of the modeling steps is accompanied by uncertainties that are hard to quantify . in the following ,",
    "the discussion will focus on the extraction of parton density functions which are essential for the calculation of the cross sections and on the validity of the dglap evolution in describing the qcd dynamics at high energy .",
    "there are many parameterizations of the proton pdfs derived in global fits of the nlo dglap evolution equations to the proton structure functions and hard scattering measurements .",
    "the most commonly used are the ones provided by the mrst(mstw )  @xcite and the cteq groups  @xcite .",
    "they incorporate not only the dis data , but also data from hadron - hadron interactions . a big effort is now vested in quantifying the uncertainties  @xcite for the precision measurements at the lhc .",
    "the worrisome part is that these uncertainties usually come out smaller than the differences between the various groups and this is particularly true with the gluon distribution , the contribution of which dominates the qcd cross section at lhc .     at @xmath23 and",
    "right  the result of fitting pdfs to the combined measurements of @xmath24 at the same @xmath1 value.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ]   at @xmath23 and right  the result of fitting pdfs to the combined measurements of @xmath24 at the same @xmath1 value.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ]    recently , the two hera experiments , h1 and zeus , provided the most precise pdfs by combining their herai measurements of the @xmath24 structure function of the proton  @xcite .",
    "the `` cross - calibration '' reduces dramatically the systematic uncertainties , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : herapdf ] .",
    "soon , one may expect even better precision , when the high luminosity measurements of neutral current and charged currents @xmath25 interactions from heraii become available .",
    "the extraction of pdfs assumes the validity of the dglap evolution equation in the full range probed by the data , including the very low @xmath0 regime of hera .",
    "the only marker justifying this approach is the good @xmath26 of the global fit .",
    "however many parameters are involved and the lever arm at low @xmath0 is relatively small ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : xq2plane ] ) .     and",
    "@xmath1 plane by existing measurements and the expected coverage in the lhc @xmath5 experiments.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    a large fraction of the low @xmath0 cross section in @xmath3 scattering is due to heavy flavor production , in particular @xmath27 pairs . a compilation of hera measurements  @xcite of @xmath28 , the contribution of charm production to @xmath24 , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : f2cc ] .",
    "the treatment of heavy flavor contribution to @xmath24 is constantly evolving  @xcite and even within the same scheme there are large differences in the expectations of various groups , which must affect the uncertainty on the gluon distribution .     as a function of @xmath1 for different values of @xmath0 , compared to expectations of two particular pdfs obtained with the fixed flavor scheme.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    in the dglap evolution equations ,",
    "large gluon densities are expected at low @xmath0 .",
    "if the gluon density per unit area becomes large , the probability of recombination of gluons becomes high and non - linear effects in the evolution may show up  @xcite which would slow down the increase of the gluon density .",
    "in addition coherent effects may be expected  @xcite .",
    "it is quite clear by now , that the hera data do not have the power to rule out or confirm the presence of such effects .",
    "however , there are indications in the hera data that the low @xmath0 regime of dis scattering may not be fully described by the dglap dynamics .",
    "this is exemplified by the large fraction of diffractive - like events as well as by the observation of an excess of forward jets in the low @xmath0 regime .",
    "if particle production in hard scattering is driven by the dglap evolution , large rapidity gaps ( lrg ) between hadrons are exponentially suppressed . yet , at hera , about 10% of the dis events have a large rapidity gap , which separates the initial proton from the rest of the hadronic final state  @xcite .",
    "it is conceivable that the origin of these lrg is soft in nature and that their presence is accounted for in the initial conditions of the evolution , which would preserve the validity of the dglap dynamics in sufficiently hard processes .",
    "the presence of lrg at high energy is associated with diffractive scattering which , in soft hadron - hadron collisions , is believed to be due to the exchange of a regge trajectory  @xcite with vacuum quantum numbers - the pomeron ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "the @xmath29 trajectory is characterized by two parameters , the intercept @xmath30 and the slope @xmath31 .",
    "both have been determined in soft interactions and the most commonly cited values are @xmath32  @xcite and @xmath33  @xcite .",
    "the intercept drives the energy dependence of the total cross section , @xmath34 .",
    "the value of @xmath35 was later updated  @xcite to @xmath36 .",
    "the measurements of the diffractive cross section in dis can be used to extract the value of @xmath30  @xcite . a compilation based on the zeus measurements  @xcite",
    "is presented in fig .",

    "the extracted value of @xmath30 is shown as a function of @xmath1 and no dependence on @xmath1 is observed .",
    "the averaged value of @xmath30 in dis tends to lie above the one derived from soft hadron - hadron interactions .",
    "a larger value of @xmath30 would imply a faster growth of the cross section with energy and diffractive scattering in dis a harder process than in hadron - hadron scattering .",
    "the diffractive contribution to the inclusive structure function @xmath24 is called @xmath37 .",
    "in addition to the usual dis variables , @xmath37 also depends on variables which describe the diffractive final state , @xmath38 here @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively denote the proton four - vector before and after the scattering , @xmath41 is the four - vector of the virtual photon @xmath42 with @xmath43 .",
    "the variable @xmath44 is the square of the four - momentum exchanged in the proton vertex .",
    "the variable @xmath45 is the fractional proton momentum which participates in the interaction with @xmath42 ( sometimes denoted by @xmath46 ) , @xmath47 is the equivalent of bjorken @xmath0 but relative to the exchanged object and @xmath48 .",
    "qcd factorization is expected to hold for @xmath49  @xcite and it may then be decomposed into diffractive parton distributions ( dpdf ) , @xmath50 , in a way similar to the inclusive @xmath24 , @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the universal structure function for dis on parton @xmath14 , @xmath53 is the factorization scale at which @xmath50 are probed and @xmath54 is the fraction of momentum of the proton carried by the diffractive parton @xmath14 .",
    "diffractive partons are to be understood as those partons in the proton from which the scattering leads to a diffractive final state .",
    "the dglap evolution equation applies in the same way as for the inclusive case . for a fixed value of @xmath45 ,",
    "the evolution in @xmath0 and @xmath1 is equivalent to the evolution in @xmath47 and @xmath1 .",
    "if , following ingelman and schlein  @xcite , one further assumes the validity of regge factorization , @xmath49 may be decomposed into a universal @xmath29 flux and the structure function of the @xmath29 , @xmath55 where the normalization of either of the two components is arbitrary .",
    "it implies that the @xmath45 and @xmath44 dependence of the diffractive cross section is universal , independent of @xmath1 and @xmath47 , and given by @xmath56 one of the expectations which agrees with the measurements as discussed in the previous section .    in this approach , the mechanism for producing lrg",
    "is assumed to be present at some scale and the evolution formalism allows to probe the underlying partonic structure .",
    "the latter depends on the coupling of quarks and gluons to the pomeron .",
    "an example of diffractive parton distributions derived by the h1 experiment is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dpdf ]  @xcite .    , and the gluon distribution in diffractive parton distributions as a function of the fraction @xmath54 of the momentum of the colorless exchange responsible for the lrg and for different @xmath1 values .",

    "they are further constrained by diffractive jet  @xcite and heavy flavor  @xcite production .",
    "the fact that all diffractive dis data can be accommodated by the same set of dpdf lands support to qcd factorization .",
    "gluons constitute a large fraction ( about 70% ) of the diffractive exchange , implying that dis induced by gluons is more likely to lead to a diffractive final state . in the black - body limit",
    "the fraction of diffractive events can not exceed 50%  @xcite . at hera ,",
    "this limit is far from being reached , however the dominance of gluons in diffractive scattering indicates that the onset of unitarity effects may first show up in the gluon .",
    "qcd factorization in diffractive scattering is expected to break down in hadron - hadron interactions  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the measurements of diffractive dijet production in @xmath4 interactions at the tevatron  @xcite indicate that their rate is by factor 5 to 10 lower than expected from the dpdf extracted at hera .",

    "the explanation may lie in the preliminary measurements of the h1 experiment  @xcite where the cross section for diffractive dijet production in @xmath57 is compared to expectations ( assuming qcd factorization ) as a function of the highest transverse energy of the two jets , @xmath58 . as shown in fig .",

    "in fact , a closer inspection of the cdf results ( see fig .  [",

    "the lrg suppression seems stronger at high @xmath47 , that is lower diffractive masses and therefore lower @xmath59 jets .",
    "the selection of higher @xmath59 jets may be a way of selecting a ( transversely ) smaller partonic configuration of the dissociating particle , for which by virtue of color screening the probability of rescattering becomes smaller .",
    "the comparison of the diffractive measurements at hera and at the tevatron leads to the following puzzle .",
    "of the order of 10% of events observed in @xmath3 collisions can not be accounted for in @xmath4 collisions , yet inclusive factorization seems to be preserved ( universality of proton pdf ) .",
    "the only explanation is that the mechanism of rescattering somehow preserves the total cross section .",
    "this must have implications for multi - parton interactions , one of the big unknowns at lhc .",
    "a small fraction of diffractive events in @xmath3 scattering at hera consist of exclusive vector meson or single photon ( deeply virtual compton scattering dvcs ) production . at the high center of mass energies of hera and in the presence of a large scale , these exclusive processes are believed to be mediated by two gluon exchange  @xcite .",
    "the cross section for the exclusive processes is expected to rise with center of mass energy @xmath60 , with the rate of growth increasing with the value of the hard scale .",

    "the universal value of @xmath74 corresponds roughly to a radius of 0.6 fm which is smaller than the charge radius of the proton which is 0.8 fm .",

    "<S> over the last two decades , the hera collider has provided a large amount of new information about qcd dynamics at high energy . while the most appreciated are the measurements of the proton structure functions in a wide range of parton momentum @xmath0 and virtuality @xmath1 , it is hard to believe that some of the observations at hera which do not fit the simple picture of dglap dynamics would not get amplified at the lhc , possibly rendering certain approaches to searches beyond the standard model inadequate . </S>"
