    "samples where single - electron tunneling through donor - bound electronic states was observed were prepared by flash annealing a commercial n - type ( arsenic doped ) silicon wafer with resistivity @xmath125 ohm - cm to a temperature @xmath126 @xmath127c for 10 seconds , a total of 3 times .",
    "after the final flash anneal , the temperature was rapidly quenched to 800 @xmath127c , followed by slow ( 1 @xmath127c / s ) cooling to 340 @xmath127c , producing a @xmath128 surface reconstruction .",
    "hydrogen passivation was carried out by dosing with 9 monolayers of atomic hydrogen .",
    "this flash anneal procedure is known from secondary ion mass spectroscopy to deplete the upper @xmath8 nm of the wafer of arsenic dopants@xcite , but is shallow enough to maintain sufficient coupling to the conduction impurity band to obtain a measurable single - electron tunneling current through donor - bound states .",

    "no donors were found for samples flashed 3 times at 1200 @xmath127c , which are expected to have too deep ( @xmath129 nm ) a surface depletion and too few residual arsenic dopants@xcite .",

    "the signature of bound states is the localized protrusion seen in figure a.1 . as apparent from figure 1b in the main text , localized states at @xmath132 v , @xmath133 v and @xmath134 v all contribute to the constant current image obtained at @xmath11 v. moreover , the continuum into which above band - edge tunneling necessarily occurs in constant current imaging is typically disturbed by the presence of impurities@xcite .",

    "<S> the observed valley interference will render two - qubit exchange gates sensitive to atomic - scale variations in positions of subsurface donors . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , these results will also be of interest to emerging schemes proposing to encode information directly in valley polarization .    </S>",
    "<S> fabrication of devices@xcite , spin readout@xcite , and quantum control of spins@xcite in silicon has been accomplished at the single - donor level . </S>",
    "<S> however , addressable control and coupling within qubit arrays requires local gates and control interfaces , whose atomic - scale potentials strongly influence electronic valley degrees of freedom@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while these unconventional orbital degrees of freedom play no role in conventional silicon microelectronics , they invariably arise in quantized states in indirect gap materials , and are pervasive in quantum electronics . in silicon , </S>",
    "<S> valley physics determines qubit relaxation rates@xcite and are predicted to strongly influence two qubit gates@xcite . moreover </S>",
    "<S> , valley degrees of freedom in alas@xcite , silicon@xcite , diamond@xcite , and graphene@xcite can play a role similar to spin in condensed matter systems . </S>",
    "<S> encoding of information within valley polarization has been proposed in alas@xcite , silicon@xcite and diamond@xcite , and within polarization of chiral valley pseudospin in carbon - based nanostructures@xcite .    here , individual states of subsurface donors were measured using cryogenic scanning tunneling spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> quantum mechanical valley interference patterns were observed in real space , associated with linear quantum superpositions of wavevectors in the six conduction band valleys of silicon . </S>",
    "<S> enabled by high - accuracy empirical determination of donor depth and electric field , we perform a parameter - free comparison with atomistic theory establishing that the z - valley population is @xmath3 for a @xmath4 nm deep donor , perturbed by only @xmath5 compared with @xmath6 for a donor in bulk silicon . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , donors more than @xmath7 nm deep should not experience a significant valley - repopulation induced increase in spin - lattice relaxation . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the nearly bulk - like valley interference observed will render two - qubit exchange gates sensitive to atomic variations in donor position@xcite , even for subsurface donors . </S>",
    "<S> measurements of valley quantum interference presented herein address spatial aspects of the now 60-year old theory of shallow impurities in silicon@xcite that are essential for engineering spin qubit arrays leveraging silicon s exceptional coherence@xcite .        </S>",
    "<S> we employed unconventional scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts)-based spatially - resolved single - electron transport to measure , in real space , valley interference in single quantum states of subsurface arsenic donors . </S>",
    "<S> ultra - high vacuum annealing , with parameters targeted to deplete the upper @xmath8 nm of donors@xcite , was performed on a highly arsenic - doped silicon wafer ( see methods ) . </S>",
    "<S> spatially well - isolated residual donors ( density @xmath9 @xmath10 ) were found in the depletion region by subsurface imaging@xcite at @xmath11 v.    the electronic isolation of donor - bound states within the depletion region was quantified as illustrated in figure 1a , by single - electron transport spectroscopy employing the scanning tunneling microscope tip , at 4.2 k. the measured differential conductance @xmath12 above donor 1 ( figure 1b , blue squares ) exhibited single electron tunneling peaks , from the substrate s impurity band@xcite , to the subsurface donor brought into the bias window by tip - induced band bending , to the tip . </S>",
    "<S> fitting of the first two peaks to single - electron transport theory@xcite(figure 1b , red line ) established a coupling @xmath13 @xmath14ev for donor 1 , similar to states in single atom transistors@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the lowest energy peak ( @xmath15 v ) was found to be bound to donor 1 in spatially resolved @xmath12 ( figure 1c ) . </S>",
    "<S> higher energy peaks ( @xmath16 v ) in figure 1b and 1c are two - electron states ( see supplementary information ) .    spatially resolved measurements of donor - bound states were carried out using an unconventional scheme . </S>",
    "<S> constant current imaging of single dopants ( see [ ] , references therein , and [ ] ) was avoided since it necessarily measures multiple states . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , measurement of @xmath12 vs. @xmath17 on a two - dimensional spatial grid would be impractically time consuming for the spatial frequency range @xmath18 necessary to avoid frequency aliasing , and desired resolution @xmath19 to resolve band structure components . </S>",

    "<S> the feedback loop was turned off for the second pass , and the tip position set to @xmath25 , @xmath26 nm closer to the sample relative to the first line ( topography ) . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath27 was chosen such that @xmath28 , or equivalently , @xmath29 . in this regime , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the central coordinate of the tip apex orbital@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for donor 1 , the measured @xmath20 and @xmath30 are shown in figure 1d and figure 1e , respectively . in figure 1e </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath23 vanishes away from the donor , as expected for a measurement of a single bound quantum state .        to investigate valley interference of donor 1 </S>",
    "<S> , we numerically evaluated the two - dimensional fourier representation of the measured @xmath30 , shown in figure 2a . </S>",

    "<S> a depth @xmath44 nm ( @xmath45 lattice planes ) for donor 1 was empirically obtained by fitting the spatially resolved spectral shift of the conduction band edge to a dielectric screened coulomb potential@xcite ( see supplementary information ) . shown for comparison in figure 2b </S>",
    "<S> is the fourier transform of the vacuum tail of the ground state probability density @xmath46 obtained by sp@xmath47d@xmath48s@xmath49 tight - binding ( see methods ) . </S>",
    "<S> the predicted ellipsoids and probability envelope features are in very good agreement with measurements in figure 2a .    </S>",
    "<S> as follows from the discussion below , the ellipsoids and probability envelope features are produced by quantum interference processes associated with quantum superpositions of momenta in six different valleys , in the donor ground state . </S>",
    "<S> such a state can be written as@xcite @xmath50 , where @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) are the valley quantum numbers , and as illustrated in figure 2c , @xmath53 is the the reciprocal space distribution of the wavefunction over the bloch functions @xmath54 about minima @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> the full fourier representation of the state is obtained by substituting the representation for the bloch functions , such that@xcite @xmath56 , where @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59=[0,0,0 ] , [ 1,1,1 ] , [ 2,0,0 ] , [ 2,2,0],[3,1,1], ... $ ] ( units : @xmath60 ) and their equivalents are the reciprocal lattice vectors with nonzero bloch amplitudes @xmath61 in silicon@xcite .    since @xmath62 , ellipsoid features in @xmath63 at @xmath64 and @xmath65 ( green ellipsoids ) are only present when @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively , while the projected ellipsoid at @xmath68 ( yellow circle ) is only present when @xmath69 . for a donor in bulk silicon , </S>",
    "<S> the ground state is a spin degenerate valley singlet with @xmath70 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the calculated ground state fourier amplitudes @xmath71 presented in figure 2d for a depth @xmath72 are in good agreement with the expected reciprocal space representation for a bulk - like donor with valley configuration similar to @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> the singlet , whose ionization energy is @xmath74 mev for an arsenic donor , lies 22 mev below a spin - degenerate excited valley triplet with @xmath75 $ ] , @xmath76 $ ] , and @xmath77 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the constructive valley interference of the singlet at the arsenic site ( the central cell ) is responsible for the energy difference . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite     for donor ground state , along 110 direction in reciprocal space . </S>",
    "<S> the height of the central peak ( @xmath78 ) relative to side peaks ( @xmath79 ) increases with decreasing depth from @xmath80 ( black line ) , @xmath81 ( green line ) , @xmath72 ( red line ) , to @xmath82 ( blue line ) , indicating repopulation from @xmath83 and @xmath84 valleys into @xmath85 valleys with decreasing depth . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated first excited state , shown for @xmath82 ( blue dashed line ) , populates only the @xmath85 valley , and hence , has no side lobes . ]        </S>",
    "<S> two quantum interference processes are of particular interest in the fourier representation of figure 2a and 2b , which maps components @xmath86 in @xmath87 and @xmath88 in @xmath89 to @xmath90 in @xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> first , ellipsoids at @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) in @xmath94 , overlaying atomistic calculations in figure 2e , arise from cross - product terms of @xmath85 valleys and @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) valleys . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the ellipsoids in the fourier decomposition of @xmath23 are direct evidence for the presence of all three valleys in the measured ( figure 2a ) and atomistically calculated ( figure 2b ) subsurface donor ground state . from the same mapping </S>",
    "<S> , it follows that @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 valleys contribute to the peak at @xmath78 , while only @xmath83 and @xmath84 valleys contribute to the side peak at @xmath79 .    </S>",
    "<S> the relative heights of the central and side peaks in the measured and calculated probability envelopes were compared to characterize the deviation of donor 1 from the @xmath95 ( bulk ) valley configuration . the electric field in experiments , estimated in the supplementary information to be @xmath96 mv / m using tip - height dependent @xmath12 measurements , is low enough to be safely neglected in calculations of donor - bound states@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> calculations for decreasing depths @xmath80 to @xmath82 presented in figure 3 demonstrate an increasing contribution of the central peak signaling an increase in the @xmath85-valley population relative to @xmath83 and @xmath84 valleys . </S>",
    "<S> this arises from the competition between the interface , which introduces a valley - orbit potential@xcite and depopulates the @xmath83 and @xmath84 valleys with lighter masses parallel to the interface , and the donor ion s valley - orbit potential , which equalizes all six valleys . </S>",
    "<S> the side peak amplitude saturates at @xmath81 indicating that the valleys approach the bulk configuration . </S>",
    "<S> shown in figure 3 ( green diamonds ) , the measured donor s profile agrees well with calculations for @xmath72 at zero field , in excellent agreement with the empirically determined depth @xmath97 of donor 1 . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate that the @xmath85-valley configuration of the measured donor differs by only @xmath98 compared to a donor in bulk silicon ( @xmath99 ) , since states calculated for @xmath81 and @xmath72 depths have @xmath85-valley populations of @xmath100 and @xmath101 , respectively ( see supplementary information ) . </S>",
    "<S> the wider central peak in measurements could be the result of enhanced lateral localization due to image charges associated with dielectric mismatch for the 3 nm deep donor , not taken into account in the theory . </S>",
    "<S> overall , the agreement of the reciprocal space profile with the theoretical description from the calculations is remarkable . </S>",
    "<S> note that low - pass response of the stm tip orbital is not expected for such low spatial frequencies @xmath102 ( @xmath103 nm ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the real - space representation of the ellipsoids , shown in figure 4a and obtained by digital fourier filtering , resembles a low frequency s - like envelope modulated by x and y - directed standing wave patterns with wavelength @xmath104 nm . as described above , the ellipsoids in @xmath46 arise from cross terms between the @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) valleys , which oscillate at @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) , and the @xmath85 valley . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , their real - space representation can be easily shown ( see supplementary information ) to have the form @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the donor ground state envelope function . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum of the real - space oscillation pattern , labelled with a red cross in figure 4 , identifies the position of the ion . </S>",
    "<S> notably , the appearance of elongation along [ 100 ] and [ 010 ] directions ( figure 4a ) is also predicted by atomistic theory ( figure 4b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the oscillations observed in figure 4a/4b are associated with superpositions of momenta , not unlike friedel oscillations of metallic surface states observed by stm at impurities and step edges@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the present case differs because the superpositions occupy six valleys along three orthogonal [ 001 ] directions , rather than a two - dimensional fermi surface .    like the ellipsoids , the probability envelope feature introduced in the discussion of figure 2 arises from valley interference . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is not surprising that the real - space representation of the probability envelope in figure 4c has an unusual shape characterized by a node along @xmath107 . </S>",
    "<S> this node , predicted by calculations ( figure 4d ) , contrasts the simple envelope of oscillations in figure 4a/4b . </S>",
    "<S> notably , a survey of fifty subsurface donors with indistinguishable spectral signatures revealed 24 `` type - a '' envelopes typified by donor 1 in figure 4c/4d , and 26 `` type - b '' envelopes typified by donor 2 in figure 4e/4 g . while the ellipsoid interference pattern of the type - b donor ( figure 4e ) resembles that of type - a donor ( figure 4a ) , the probability envelope of the type - b donor ( figure 4 g ) has a protrusion along @xmath107 . </S>",
    "<S> the depth of donor 2 was not measured due to a technical problem .    </S>",
    "<S> the type - a and type - b probability envelopes are at first peculiar . </S>",
    "<S> an examination of tight - binding calculations of @xmath23 for donors occupying successively deeper planes revealed a sequence a , a , b , b , a , a , b , b for donor depths @xmath108 , @xmath82 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath72 , @xmath112 , and @xmath113 . </S>",
    "<S> both the calculated ellipsoids ( figure 4f ) and probability envelope ( figure 4h ) of the @xmath113 type - b donor are in excellent agreement with measurements in figure 4e and figure 4 g , respectively . moreover , the calculated probability envelope for a fixed donor depth was found to depend sensitively on the lattice plane below the surface where it was evaluated . </S>",
    "<S> the two different probability envelopes are therefore a manifestation of ( 1 ) rapid spatial variation of @xmath23 along @xmath85 with lattice and valley spatial frequencies ( and their harmonics ) , and ( 2 ) the relative sensitivity of the tip to the topmost atomic planes . nevertheless , the spatial average of type - a and type - b probability envelopes is s - like , as expected from effective mass@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we found an uncertainty @xmath114 in the depth determination , considerably larger than the uncertainty @xmath115 required to assign a donor to a crystal lattice plane . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the empirically observed 48@xmath116 / 52@xmath116 distribution is consistent with theory , assuming ( as expected ) a random distribution of donor depths .    </S>",
    "<S> any interface - induced mixing with excited valley - orbit states enhances the spin - lattice relaxation rate@xcite . the nearly bulk - like valley interference pattern observed for @xmath117 </S>",
    "<S> nm deep donors is a direct indication of small mixing with valley - orbit excited states . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore expect that arsenic donors whose depth exceeds 3 nm ( approximately 1 effective bohr radius ) would have spin - lattice relaxation rates @xmath118 only slightly larger than bulk donors . for magnetic fields of practical interest@xcite , @xmath119 of subsurface donors </S>",
    "<S> will still greatly exceed the spin coherence time of electrons in isotope purified silicon@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , proximity to non - ideal interfaces could introduce other relaxation or decoherence processes . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the observed interference in figure 4 is precisely the phenomena predicted to render two - qubit gates sensitive to atomic - scale variations in donor position@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this can be thought of as a direct consequence of phase mismatch in interfering terms in the exchange interaction @xmath120 between donors separated by a displacement @xmath121 , each having lattice - incommensurate ( @xmath122 nm ) spatial oscillations .    </S>",
    "<S> the spatially resolved single electron transport demonstrated herein provides a new level of access to valley physics . </S>",
    "<S> we have observed electronic valley quantum interference for a single donor atom whose depth and electric field have been independently empirically determined , capabilities not available in single - electron transport spectroscopy of donors in nanoscale transistors@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have identified that a donor @xmath1 nm from an interface and in a low field @xmath123 mv / m has an electronic valley population deviating by only @xmath124% compared with a donor in bulk silicon . </S>",
    "<S> this new level of understanding is essential to the engineering of addressable single - qubit two - qubit operations in silicon donor devices@xcite , in order to exploit silicon s </S>",
