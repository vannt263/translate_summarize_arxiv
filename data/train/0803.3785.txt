    "the approach proposed in  @xcite is based on the critical full scaling limit and the  poissonian marking \" of some special (  macroscopically pivotal \" ) points , and it leads to a conceptual framework that can in principle describe not only the scaling limit of near - critical percolation but also of related two - dimensional models such as dynamical percolation , the minimal spanning tree and invasion percolation ( see  @xcite ) .    in this note , we consider the collection of all percolation interfaces and show how one can use known scaling relations for percolation to prove that , besides the trivial scaling limit corresponding to subcritical and supercritical percolation , there are only two other alternatives , that we call _ critical _ and _ near - critical _ scaling limits , and for which we give a geometric characterization .",
