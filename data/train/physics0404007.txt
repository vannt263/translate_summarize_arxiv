    "the influence of the spatial confinement on the physical properties , such as electronic spectra of nanostructured systems , is a topic of growing interest . among the several kinds of confined systems one can detach low dimensional electronic gases and impurity atoms in metallic or semiconductor mesoscopic structures,@xcite as also atoms , ions and molecules trapped in microscopic cavities,@xcite where the effects of the confinement become important when the typical quantum sizes - such as fermi wavelength - reach the same order of magnitude as the sizes of the cavities .",
    "however , the energy spectrum of such systems is not only determined by the spatial confinement and the geometric shape , but also by environmental factors such as electric and magnetic fields .",
    "it is also defined by many - body effects as electron - electron interaction , which may even become more important than the confinement itself . in all cases ,",
    "a correct description of the physical properties of the problem requires the system wavefunction to reflect , in an appropriated way , the presence of both confinement , internal and external interactions , and the corresponding boundary conditions .",
    "we should also mention the existence of other confined systems , for example , the ones constituted by phonons,@xcite plasmons@xcite or confined bosonic gases.@xcite    low dimensional electronic gases are defined in semiconductor structures when the bulk translation symmetry is broken in one or more spatial dimensions , giving origin to 2d ( quantum wells ) , 1d ( quantum wires ) or 0d ( quantum dots ) systems .",
    "in such structures , the charged carriers loose , for some interval of energy , the characteristic of being delocalized in both three spatial dimensions and become confined in regions of mesoscopic sizes inside the crystal .",
    "this fact transforms the continua energy bands into broken subbands and energy - gaps , or even into fully discrete energy states as for example in semiconductor quantum dots ( qds ) , which are the main type of confined system to be addressed in this work .",
    "an important point to have in mind is that the usual charging model,11,12,13,14 which reduces the electron - electron interaction inside the dot to a constant proportional to its electronic occupation , is able to reasonably reproduce the experimental findings for metallic dots .",
    "however , in order to obtain a more realistic description of many - particle semiconductor dots , their relatively lower electronic density makes imperative to consider the electron - electron interaction under a microscopic point of view . in strong confinement regimes",
    ", it may even be included in a perturbative scheme .",
    "various are the approaches that have been used to deal with many - particle qds . among them",
    ", one can cite charging model , correlated electron model,29 green functions,@xcite lanczos algorithm,@xcite monte carlo method,@xcite hartree - fock calculations@xcite and density functional theory.@xcite it is useful to emphasize that not only the many - body effects but also the spatial symmetry ( geometric confinement ) become indispensable ingredients for a precise determination of quantum effects in the electronic structure of semiconductor qds .    among the several kinds of geometries confining a qd ,",
    "maybe the most common be a two - dimensional one defined by a parabolic potential.costa,51,52,53,54 here we will consider a three - dimensional qd defined by an infinite spherical potential .",
    "the former describes qds lithographically defined in the plane of a two - dimensional electron gas , while the latter describes qds grown inside glass matrices .",
    "some of the commonly studied topics in 3d qds are the formation of energy shells in their spectra,43 the control of electronic correlations,@xcite the formation of wigner molecules in the system,@xcite and the influence of the coulomb interaction in their spectra.@xcite in such spherically defined 3d qd , both spin and orbital angular momenta are good quantum numbers , and the many - particle eigenstates can be labelled according to the usual @xmath2-coupling scheme,@xcite where the exact analytic many - particle eigenstates are given as a sum over appropriated slater determinants .",
    "however , in order to deal with qds having higher occupation , the @xmath2-coupling is no longer appropriated .",
    "therefore , we have chosen to use in this paper the roothaan and pople - nesbet matrix formulations@xcite of the single determinant self - consistent hartree - fock formalism , respectively appropriated for handling closed and open shell configurations . with them",
    ", we also calculate the qd addition spectrum and show how a magnetic field is able to violate the hund rule . here",
    "we consider a qd populated with up to @xmath3 electrons under the presence of a magnetic field , and expand our basis in a set of properly optimized gaussian functions . as a note",
    "one could , in principle , also include spin - orbit coupling in the model , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 would then no longer be good quantum numbers , but for an infinite spherical potential such coupling yields no contribution to the total energy of the system .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section ii , for completeness and in order to introduce our notation , both restricted and unrestricted formalisms are resumed . in section iii",
    "we show the hamiltonian model and discuss how both qd chemical potential and charging energy are calculated ; also , we present details on how the inclusion of a magnetic field changes the previous formalisms , as well as how the gaussian basis set is constructed . finally , in section iv we show our results and we use section v to line up our conclusions .",

    "notice that @xmath226 increases linearly as the occupation gets higher inside a given shell .",
    "when such shell is totally filled , there is an abrupt change in @xmath227 indicating that the following shell starts its occupation ; observe that the higher the occupation , the larger is the changing .",
    "an anomalous behavior seems to occur for the @xmath162 shell , whose @xmath228 value is larger than the one for the @xmath163 shell ( that has higher energy ) . the charging energy is another way to verify not only the presence of shell structure for the spectrum , but also the validity of hund s rule for the filling of such shells . in principle",
    ", @xmath229 must present larger ( smaller ) peaks when the total ( half ) occupation of a given shell is achieved ; the first fact is due to the higher difficulty to the addition of an extra electron to a qd when a filled shell state is reached .",
    "the second one refers to hund s rule , which establishes that electrons must be added to the system with their spins being parallel , until all possible orbitals inside a given shell be occupied ; this makes the total energy of the system smaller since this procedure maximizes the negative exchange contribution .",
    "however , some violations of this rule can be verified in @xmath229 : the smaller peak of @xmath230 occurs here at @xmath231 , and the larger peak of @xmath213 has a negative value .",
    "  gaas qd without magnetic field . in the upper left panel",
    "we compare the unrestricted and the non - interacting energies , where the qd energy shell structure is visible .",
    "the bottom left panel shows qd chemical potential ( left scale ) and charging energy ( right scale ) ; the former displays abrupt change always that a new shell starts to be populated , while the latter presents larger ( smaller ) peaks when a shell is filled ( half - filled ) , a direct consequence of the hund rule . the bottom and upper right panels show , respectively , the @xmath232-evolution of the expected values of total spin @xmath5 and its projection @xmath233 . ]",
    "the bottom and upper right panels of figure [ fig3 ] show respectively the evolution of the total spin @xmath5 and its projection @xmath234 as a function of qd population , calculated from eqs .",
    "( [ s2 ] ) and ( [ sz ] ) for the unrestricted energies .",
    "notice that , without magnetic field , the hund rule seems to be followed for all states with up to 40 electrons .",
    "the @xmath234 expected value oscillates from @xmath214 in a filled shell to its maximum in a half - filled shell , when it starts to decrease again on the way to the closing of the shell ; the maxima are @xmath235 , @xmath236 , @xmath237 and @xmath238 for @xmath182 , @xmath239 , @xmath240 and @xmath22 shells , respectively .",
    "the @xmath5 expected value yielded by the unrestricted formalism is also very reasonable ; discrepancies are only observed at @xmath241 , where @xmath242 , and at @xmath243 , where @xmath244 .",
    "we believe that both discrepancies related to the @xmath162 shell or to its surroundings - @xmath228 larger than the one of @xmath163 shell , negative peak for @xmath213 in @xmath229 , and almost doubled @xmath5 expected value for @xmath243 - are caused by the non - reasonable gaussian reproduction of this orbital , as visible in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "these same qualitative results are observed for an insb qd without magnetic field .",
    "  gaas qd of the previous figure .",
    "the panels show the successive occupation ( indicated in the upper right corner of each panel ) of the @xmath160 shell , assuming that the @xmath159 shell remains populated by one spin - up and one spin - down electron .",
    "the possible spin configurations for given @xmath6 are indicated by @xmath245 ( spin - up ) and @xmath246 ( spin - down ) . for @xmath247",
    "the spin sequence is @xmath248 , while at fields higher than @xmath249 t it changes to @xmath250 .",
    "it is interesting to observe that a magnetic field is able to suppress the energy triplets and quartets of @xmath239-shells from the qd spectrum . ]    by focusing on the @xmath160 shell we show in figure [ fig4 ] , for the same qd of the previous figure , how a finite magnetic field is able to violate hund s rule in the system .",
    "panels from left to right and from up to bottom show the successive ground state energies from @xmath251 to @xmath252 as this shell is filled , always considering that the @xmath159 shell remain fully occupied by two electrons , one spin - up and one spin - down ; the distinct possible spin configurations for each @xmath6 are indicated by @xmath245 ( spin - up ) and @xmath246 ( spin - down ) .",
    "in addition to the small zeeman effect present in all occupations , there is a change of ground state spins at @xmath253 , @xmath215 and @xmath254 as the field is increased .",
    "notice that at zero field the spin sequence is @xmath255 ; in a field above @xmath249 t it becomes @xmath250 , meaning that quartets and triplets are suppressed by the magnetic field , and the ground state of the system starts to oscillate only between singlets and doublets at high fields as @xmath6 increases .",
    "when this @xmath160 shell is half - filled ( @xmath222 ) , the ground state goes from a quartet to a doublet at @xmath256 t ; when it has one electron more ( @xmath257 ) or less ( @xmath253 ) than that , it goes from a triplet to a singlet at @xmath258 t.    at last , we have compared the results from both rhf and uhf self - consistent matrix formulations with the ones obtained from the @xmath0-coupling scheme used in ref .",
    "[ ] , where a gaas qd having @xmath259   was considered , and the quadratic term in @xmath173 was neglected since only small magnetic fields were considered .",
    "also , only @xmath204 and @xmath251 occupations were calculated , since the states were constructed analytically ( not only a single slater determinant ) , and the electron - electron interaction was included by using perturbation theory , that is justified at such radius . at zero field",
    "the energies for @xmath204 are @xmath260 mev ( @xmath261 ) and @xmath262 mev ( rhf ) , while for @xmath251 they are @xmath263 mev ( @xmath0 ) and @xmath264 mev ( uhf ) .",
    "therefore , both roothaan and pople - nesbet formalisms indeed give smaller ground state energies than the @xmath0 perturbative scheme .",
    "we have also checked the validity of neglecting the diamagnetic term ( quadratic in @xmath173 ) for fields smaller than @xmath209 t. we may emphasize here that a disadvantage of the uhf approach is , in principle , that one is never sure to get trustable information about the expected values for @xmath4 and @xmath5 in a given qd state . on the other hand ,",
    "the applicability of the @xmath0 scheme is cumbersome and becomes very complicated to be handled analytically as the qd occupation increases .",
    "we have shown how the mean - field roothaan and pople - nesbet formalisms applied to a spherical quantum dot confined system under applied magnetic field yield a fairly good description of its energy shell structure . for a maximum population of @xmath1 electrons considered , the appropriated gaussian basis",
    "set for each radius has been found .",
    "we have seen how a magnetic field influences the total energy of ground states even in closed shell configurations .",
    "we have also shown how both chemical potential and charging energy reproduce the closing and half - closing structures of the quantum dot energy shells . with the calculation of the total spin expected value for each occupation , in a given radius",
    ", we have observed that hund s rule is satisfied at zero field . however , under finite magnetic field , we have shown that its applicability is violated and , at given values of the field , which depend on quantum dot radius and material parameters , there are transitions that change a given ground state symmetry .    this work has been supported by fundao de amparo  pesquisa do estado de so paulo ( fapesp ) and by conselho nacional de desenvolvimento cientfico e tecnolgico ( cnpq ) , brazil .",
    "also we are in debt with c. trallero - giner for long discussions on this subject ."
