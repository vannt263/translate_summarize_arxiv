    "the connection between star - formation and nuclear activity in galaxies has been the subject of a number of recent studies . on the theoretical side",
    ", models such as those of perry & dyson ( 1985 ) and norman & scoville ( 1988 ) propose that a nuclear young stellar cluster is the reservoir of fuel for the agn in the nucleus .    on the observational side , terlevich , diaz & terlevich(1990 )",
    "have argued that for a number of seyfert2 galaxies , circumnuclear starbursts are necessary to explain the strength of the caii triplet ( at @xmath58500 ) in absorption .",
    "starbursts have also been proposed as the source of the blue unpolarized continuum observed in seyfert2 galaxies ( fc2 , tran 1995a , b , c ) by cid fernandes & terlevich ( 1992 , 1995 ) .",
    "heckman et al . (",
    "1995 ) have proposed the same on the basis of the iue spectra of the brightest seyfert2 galaxies in the uv .",
    "detailed studies of individual cases have been performed by heckman et al .",
    "( 1997 ) who have shown hst uv images and spectra of the circumnuclear starburst around mrk477 , and gonzlez delgado et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , who has analyzed similar data for the starbursts around the seyfert2 nuclei of ngc7130 , ngc5135 and ic3639 .",
    "the latter studies have shown the most unambiguous signatures of massive starbursts around these nuclei , but have been performed for only 4 galaxies .",
    "our main goal in this work is to extend to a larger sample the search of such nuclear starbursts signatures in agn s .",
    "recent works ( e.g. gonzlez delgado , leitherer & heckman 1999 ) have pointed out that some of the best spectral features to date starbursts are found in the blue - near uv spectral region ( 34004200 ) , the strongest being the higher order balmer absorption lines ( hereafter hobl ) .",
    "these features seem indeed to be present in the spectra of most starburst galaxies , as can be observed in the sample of storchi - bergmann , kinney & challis ( 1995 ) .",
    "bica , alloin & schmitt ( 1994 , hereafter bas94 ) have also pointed out the importance of this spectral range for the interpretation of composite stellar populations because of the signatures of the younger components ( e.g. balmer lines and balmer jump ) , and the 4000  break related to the old and intermediate age ( @xmath115gyr ) populations .",
    "they studied near - uv / blue spectra of star clusters of all ages , and analyzed equivalent widths of a number of features and continuum fluxes as a function of age and metallicity .",
    "fig . 1 of bas94 is particularly illustrative of the variation of the hobl as a function of age and metallicity .    in order to look for starbursts in seyfert s",
    ", one has to take into account the contribution of the underlying bulge population .",
    "simulations of starburst spectra superimposed on older stellar populations , for the spectral range 37009600  were carried out by bica , alloin & schmidt ( 1990 , hereafter bas90 ; see also schmidt , alloin & bica 1995 ) . for 3 relative amounts of mass stocked in star formation events , they combined a bulge spectrum with spectra of star cluster templates of different ages to simulate the evolution of equivalent widths and continuum fluxes . in the present study",
    ", we construct similar models in the range 36004100  which is particularly important for the seyfert  2 issue .",
    "the present models represent an improvement relative to bas90 in the sense that the templates incorporate the high s / n near - uv range constructed from the star cluster spectra of bas94 .",
    "we then apply the results of the above simulations to the nuclear spectra of 20 seyfert2 galaxies in order to quantify the contribution of a possible nuclear starburst to the spectrum .",
    "the data used here are the nuclear spectra of the 20 seyfert2 s of the sample of cid fernandes , schmitt & storchi - bergmann ( 1998 ) .",
    "schmitt , storchi - bergmann & cid fernandes ( 1999 ) have performed a spectral synthesis using these spectra , but most features used in the synthesis have @xmath6 4000 .",
    "our goal here is to take a close look at the near - uv region .",
    "the aperture used in the extraction of the nuclear spectra ( 2@xmath72 ) corresponds at the galaxy to regions within a radius 200300pc from the nucleus , which are of the order of the nuclear starburst sizes investigated in detail by gonzlez delgado et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "the second goal of the present study is to compare the results obtained for the seyferts with those for normal galaxies of the same hubble type .",
    "cid fernandes et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have shown that in many seyfert2 s the blue nuclear continuum seems to be absent , when one takes into account the surrounding stellar population .",
    "in other words , they have found that the nuclear stellar population is varied , and usually differs from that of an elliptical galaxy , as adopted in early works .",
    "the blue continuum artificially appears when one subtracts an elliptical galaxy template from the nuclear spectrum of a galaxy containing some contribution of younger stars ( storchi - bergmann , cid fernandes & schmitt 1998 ) .",
    "the spectral syntheses of schmitt et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have further shown that the main difference between the nuclear stellar population of seyfert2 s and that of an elliptical galaxy is an excess contribution of a @xmath1100myr stellar population .",
    "these findings point to fc2 as due to young stars in several cases , but another important question is whether the contribution of young stars in seyfert nuclei is larger than that in normal galaxies of the same hubble type . since seyfert nuclei as a rule occur in spiral galaxies , some contribution of young stars is expected . in order to access this aspect , it is necessary to compare the nuclear stellar population characteristics of the seyfert s with those of normal galaxies .",
    "we thus assume the spectral study of bica & alloin ( 1987 ) as representative of the results obtained for normal galaxies to make such a comparison .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we discuss the near - uv features and adopted templates ; in sec .",
    "3 we present the spectral models ; in sec .",
    "4 we compare the nuclear seyfert2 spectra with the models ; in sec .",
    "5 we compare our results with those of similar studies ; in sec .",
    "6 we discuss the degeneracy problem between a featureless power - law and a very young starburst continuum ; in sec .",
    "7 we compare the results for the seyfert s with those for normal galaxies of the same hubble type , and finally in sec .",
    "8 we present our conclusions .",
    "the spectral features in the near - uv for a red ( old / intermediate age ) stellar population are markedly different from those of younger stellar populations .",
    "this can be observed in fig . 1 ( see also fig . 2 of bas94 ) , where we show the stellar population templates used in this blue - violet study .",
    "the star cluster and early - type galaxy bulge ( e2e5 of bas94 ) templates used here incorporate observations from near - uv and visible ( bica & alloin 1986 , 1987 ) domains .",
    "the templates also extend further to the uv and near - ir domains , which can be used as additional constraints in the analysis .",
    "a detailed description of these templates is given by bica and collaborators in section 4.1 of leitherer et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . to represent a 3myr stellar population",
    "we adopt the integrated spectrum of 30 doradus ( bas94 , bica & alloin 1986 ) .    in the old stellar population template ,",
    "typical of elliptical galaxies or of the bulge of spirals , the main absorption features are the caii k(@xmath23933 ) and h(@xmath23970 ) lines and a blend of absorptions due to cn , mgi , sii and fei .",
    "for the younger stellar populations , with ages between 10myr and 1gyr , the main features are , apart from the caiik and h lines with varying strengths , the high order balmer lines in absorption , in particular h@xmath8(@xmath24102 ) , h@xmath9 ( @xmath23970 ) , h8(@xmath23889 ) , h9(@xmath23835 ) and h10(@xmath23797 ) .",
    "detection of the latter lines in a spectrum is thus a strong signature of the presence of a blue ( young ) stellar population , except when the burst is younger than 5myrs , in which case these absorptions are filled by emission .",
    "following bas90 , we have used the template bulge spectra in combination with varying proportions of the younger templates in order to build simple model spectra representative of composite populations .",
    "we have combined the bulge component with 0.1% , 1% and 10% mass contributions locked in the younger components , to construct the models shown in figs . 2 , 3 and 4 .",
    "the adopted mass - to - light ratios in v ( bas90 ) for the templates representing bursts of different ages , together with the relative luminosities at @xmath24020   l@xmath10 for bursts of equal masses , are listed in table 1 . this table can be used to find the contribution in flux at @xmath24020  corresponding to a given mass proportion .",
    "for example , in order to construct the model combining the bulge with 0.1% in mass of the 10myr population , we have multiplied l@xmath10 of the 10myr template by 0.1% to obtain 3.354 , which is the normalization factor of the template at @xmath24020 .",
    "subsequently it is added to the bulge template normalized to 1 at this same wavelength .",
    "notice that for equal masses , the 10myr cluster l@xmath10 value is higher than that of the 3myr cluster embedded in the hii region because of the appearance of supergiants .    by examining the characteristic features of the young stars in figs . 2 , 3 , and 4 , in particular the absorption lines h8 ,",
    "h9 and h10 ( the hobl )  which are the ones less affected by emission in seyfert s , see below  it can be concluded that : ( i ) if the starburst is very young , with ages of a few myrs , the hobl are filled by emission ; in this case , the hii region emission spectrum may be used as constraint ; ( ii ) for a small starburst , so that its mass is @xmath10.1% of that of the bulge , the hobl can be detected for young starbursts with ages from 10 to 50myrs ; ( iii ) for a starburst corresponding to 1% of the mass of the old stars , the above features can be observed for ages from 10 to 500myrs ; ( iv ) for a stronger starburst , corresponding to 10% of the mass of the bulge , the features are observed for ages from 10myrs up to 1 gyr .    in order to quantitatively characterize stellar populations ,",
    "bas94 have proposed the use of a few continuum points , whereby a continuum is traced ( connecting these points using straight lines ) to measure the equivalent widths ( hereafter represented by w ) of a number of features .",
    "however , in seyferts , many of these features are filled by emission lines and can not be used . by comparing the above stellar population templates with typical seyfert spectra , we conclude that the windows which are usually free from emission - lines are @xmath038103822(centered on a continuum point ) , @xmath038223858(centered on h9 ) and @xmath039083952(centered on the caiik line ) .",
    "we have thus followed the bas90 s method to construct the continuum , and measured the w s within the three windows above , hereafter identified as w@xmath11 , w@xmath12 and w@xmath13 , respectively .",
    "5 illustrates the continuum and windows used for three seyfert2 s with distinct near - uv spectra .",
    "the near - uv w s and continuum ratio @xmath23660/@xmath24020 ( hereafter cr ) were measured for the models .",
    "we show in fig . 6 cr , w@xmath11 and w@xmath14 as a function of the young component s age , for the three proportions in mass above .",
    "it can be concluded that cr ( f@xmath15 ) is a powerful star - formation tracer for very young stellar populations , varying from 1.4 for a 3myr stellar population down to 0.6 for 50 myrs or older . w@xmath11 and w@xmath16 are better age indicators for older bursts , but can trace stellar populations of all ages , from 3myr to 1gyr .",
    "we recall that blue - violet metal lines in composite spectra are age indicators because of the dilution effects caused by hot main sequence stars ( bica & alloin 1986 ) .",
    "regarding h9 , we conclude that its profile , together with those of the other hobl are better age indicators than w@xmath12 .",
    "a number of seyfert2 galaxies present a polarized blue continuum with a power - law spectrum ( tran 1995a , b , c ; storchi - bergmann et al .",
    "we have thus also constructed a second set of models combining the bulge template and a power - law @xmath17(hereafter pl ) , which is typical of the polarized continuum found by tran ( 1995a , b , c ) . as the mass proportions used above have no meaning for the pl",
    ", we have used combinations with varying proportions of the pl in flux at @xmath24020 .",
    "the cr , w@xmath11 and w@xmath18 measured for the models combining the bulge template with the pl are plotted in fig .",
    "7 , as a function of the pl percent contribution in flux at @xmath24020 . as a comparison",
    ", we also plot the w values from models combining a bulge with the same flux contribution from a 10myr stellar population and a 100myr population .",
    "combination with older populations produce similar cr values as the latter , as can be seen in fig .",
    "fig . 7 shows that cr is the most powerful discriminator between a pl and bursts of @xmath1100myr or older . on the other hand",
    ", it shows also that a pl is hardly distinguishable from a 10myr burst on the basis of the cr and w values , a problem which has been already pointed out by several authors and by ourselves in schmitt et al .",
    "we discuss this problem further in sec .",
    "the seyfert sample used in this work is the same as that of schmitt et al .",
    "( 1999 , hereafter ssc99 ) except for one radio - galaxy ( with had a low signal - to - noise ratio spectrum in the near - uv ) , and consists of the 20 seyfert2 s and 3 radio - galaxies from the larger sample of cid fernandes et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . as in ssc99 , we use here only the nuclear spectra , extracted using windows of 2@xmath72 , which correspond at the galaxy to regions of typical diameters of a few hundred parsecs .",
    "these spectra are plotted in figs .",
    "8 to 12 , separated according to the hubble types .",
    "here we have made use of the updated morphological classifications of our sample of seyfert2 s in the malkan et al .",
    "( 1998 ) hst optical imaging survey , due to the better spatial resolution and dynamical range of their images as compared with those upon which the previous classifications ( rc3 , de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "1991 ) are based .",
    "we found an interesting result : out of the 20 galaxies in our sample , 10 have new classifications when compared with those of rc3 , _ always to later hubble types _ , as shown in table 3 .",
    "in particular , two of the galaxies with the most obvious signatures of recent star formation , ngc5135 and ngc7130 ( gonzlez delgado et al . 1998 ) , previously classified as sab and sa , respectively , have been re - classified as sc and sd by malkan et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "the galaxies cr , w s and scales ( pc / arcsec ) are listed in table 2 .",
    "typical errors are @xmath190.01 in cr and @xmath31  in the w s . in cid",
    "fernandes et al .",
    "( 1998 ) we have noticed that the nuclear spectra of these galaxies were in most cases redder than the extranuclear neighboring spectra , a result that we have attributed to reddening . indeed , in the spectral syntheses performed by ssc99 , they usually found significant reddenings ( 0.1@xmath3e(b  v)@xmath30.60 ) .",
    "we have thus corrected the nuclear spectra by the reddening ( seaton 1979 ) found by ssc99 before tracing the continuum and measuring the near - uv w s and cr .",
    "notice however that the reddening corrections are not critical for cr due to the proximity of the continuum wavelengths @xmath23660and @xmath24020 .",
    "we now compare the near - uv nuclear spectra of our sample with the synthetic spectra derived from the cr and w s listed in table 2 , using the model values from figs . 6 and 7 .",
    "as the templates have lower spectral resolution ( @xmath115 ) than the seyfert spectra ( @xmath15 ) , we present here the models compared with the seyfert spectra smoothed to better match the template resolution .",
    "the smoothing may cause loss of information , particularly when there are faint emission lines superimposed on the hobl .",
    "we have thus always checked for these emission lines at full resolution and have not included in the fit the absorption features affected by line emission .",
    "the most frequent case is the contamination of the caiih + h@xmath9 absorption by neiii@xmath23968 + h@xmath9 emission .",
    "our goal with these comparisons is not a perfect match of the nuclear spectrum , but to identify the unambiguous signatures of the different components to the nuclear spectrum , looking in particular for the characteristic star - formation features hobl ( h8 , h9 and h10 in absorption ) , using the simple models as a guide . with this approach",
    ", we also check if these simple models are a good representation of the nuclear stellar population . in applying the models of figs . 6 and 7 ,",
    "it can be noted that the cr s and w s are compatible in several cases with more than one model . in these cases ,",
    "the adopted model is the one which gives the best fit to the overall spectrum .",
    "the quality of the fit is inspected in regions free from emission lines , and the best fit is the one which gives the smaller residuals between the observed and model spectra in these regions .    as pointed out above , it is not possible to distinguish a pl continuum from that of a template of age 10myr or younger , for flux contributions smaller than 40% at @xmath24020 .",
    "when such a continuum is needed we will call it pl / ys , meaning power - law or young stars .",
    "the nature of this component is further discussed in sec .",
    "if the seyfert2 has strong balmer emission - lines , the balmer continuum in emission may be important in the near - uv region , diluting the w values calculated above . from the emission - line fluxes",
    ", we found that the balmer continuum only contributes significantly ( with more than 5% to the flux ) for @xmath20 , for the galaxies ic1816 , mcg05 - 27 - 013 , mrk348 , mrk573 and mrk1210 . in these cases",
    "we have considered also the contribution of the balmer continuum , calculated as in osterbrock ( 1989 ) , and normalized according to the fluxes of the balmer emission lines .      in order to verify the applicability of the templates as a basis to synthesize the seyfert spectra , which were observed with the ctio 4 m blanco telescope ( cid fernandes et al .",
    "1998 ) , we have first applied the models to the normal elliptical galaxy ic4889 , observed with the same telescope , as a test to the method . in addition , we apply the models to three radio elliptical galaxies .",
    "the spectra and models are illustrated in fig .",
    "the near - uv w s and cr agree very well with those of the bulge template , and indicate no need of bluer components , as expected .",
    "13a illustrates the observed spectrum as compared with the bulge template , showing a very good match of the observed spectrum to the template , indicating that we can use the templates constructed from the cluster spectra to synthesize the seyfert nuclear spectra .",
    "small differences are apparent in the caiik and h lines , which are deeper in the galaxy spectrum , even though the w s are the same as in the bulge template .",
    "we attribute this effect to a residual difference in spectral resolution between our spectrum and the bulge template .",
    "this is a radio galaxy with near - uv w values smaller than those of the bulge template , indicating the presence of some contribution of a blue component .",
    "the best fit for the spectrum is obtained with the combination of a bulge plus 10% in mass of a population of 1gyr , although the nuclear spectrum of the galaxy is still somewhat bluer for @xmath213660 .",
    "an improved fit to the blue end of the spectrum is obtained by adding a 5% contribution in flux at @xmath24020 of the pl / ys component .",
    "the hobl are at the detection limit ( fig . 13b ) .",
    "neiii@xmath23968 + h@xmath9 emission can be observed filling the caiih + h@xmath9 absorption .",
    "this radio galaxy has a small dilution of the w s when compared with the elliptical template values .",
    "the overall spectral distribution is best reproduced by the combination of the bulge with 10% flux contribution of the pl / ys component at @xmath24020(fig .",
    "the difference in the depth of the caiik line is similar to that observed in ic4889 and thus due to the better spectral resolution of the radio galaxy spectrum relative to the template .",
    "it is not possible to identify the hobl .",
    "neiii@xmath23968 + h@xmath9 emission is filling the caiih + h@xmath9 absorption .      here the case is similar to the one above , with a somewhat larger dilution in the continuum window and somewhat larger cr .",
    "the cr value indicates a 15% pl / ys contribution , in agreement with the w values and overall spectral distribution ( fig . 13d ) . the same remark above about the caiik line applies here .",

    "the cr of 0.7 indicates the presence of a pl / ys continuum contributing with @xmath130% to the flux at @xmath24020 , in agreement also with the w values .",
    "some contribution of an intermediate population is also possible , and a model including 10% mass contribution of a 1gyr stellar population , combined with 20% in flux of a pl gives a slightly improved fit in the h9h10 region , as shown in fig .",

    "the near - uv w s , cr and spectral distribution are well represented by a bulge template plus 1% mass contribution of a 50myr stellar population .",
    "again , we attribute the poor fit of the caiik line mostly to the lower metallicity of the young templates as compared to the nuclear region of the galaxy .",
    "there is contamination of the caiih + h@xmath9 absorption by neiii@xmath23968 + h@xmath9 emission .",
    "the near - uv w s , cr and spectrum are best reproduced by a bulge plus 10% mass contribution of a 1gyr stellar population ( fig .",
    "the spectrum is somewhat noisy in the region , and thus the hobl can not be unambiguously identified .",
    "neiii@xmath23968 + h@xmath9 emission are filling the caiih + h@xmath9 absorption .      cr is 0.7 for this galaxy suggesting a 20% contribution of a pl / ys component .",
    "the spectrum is dominated by line emission , including in the high order balmer lines and the blue end of the spectrum is noisy .",
    "it is not possible to identify the hobl in absorption ( fig .",
    "16e ) .    in summary , for the five sab , sb and sbc s , ngc7582 presents the hobl signatures of a nuclear starburst , ngc1386 , mrk607 and possibly also ngc6890 have 10% contribution in mass of intermediate age 1gyr stars and the cr of mcg-05 - 27 - 013 and ngc6890 suggest the presence of a pl / ys component contributing with 20% in flux at @xmath24020 .",
    "the hobl are clear in the spectrum .",
    "the w s , cr and other features of the spectrum can be approximately reproduced by the combination of 50% each in flux at @xmath24020 of two of our models : the first is the bulge template combined with 1% in mass of a 10myrs stellar population , and the second is the bulge template combined with 1% in mass of a 100myrs stellar population ( fig .",
    "there is some line emission of h@xmath9+neiii@xmath23968 , h8 and possibly h9 .",
    "the starburst in this galaxy has been extensively studied by gonzlez delgado et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and gonzlez delgado , heckman & leitherer ( 2000 ) , hereafter gd98 and gd00 . gd98",
    "have shown that the uv spectrum presents clear signatures of o and b stars , estimating an age between 3 and 5 myr for the burst , while gd00 concluded that there is also a similar contribution in flux from an intermediate age population and a small contribution of an old component .",
    "our model is consistent with the latter mixture .",
    "the near - uv w s , cr and spectrum can be best reproduced by the combination of the bulge template plus 1% in mass of a 100myr stellar population , except for the caii k line , mostly due to the lower metallicity of the young template , as discussed previously .",
    "the hobl can be identified ( fig .",
    "neiii@xmath23968 + h@xmath9 emission are almost filling the caiih + h@xmath9 absorption .",
    "the near - uv w s , cr and spectral distribution are best reproduced by a mixture of a bulge template plus 10% mass contribution of a 1gyr stellar population .",
    "the model is compared with the data in fig .",
    "17c , where the hobl are at the limit of detection .",
    "fig 17d shows the clear hobl in this spectrum , another case of nuclear starburst well studied by gd98 and gd00 .",
    "the latter authors have suggested the same population as that derived for ngc5135 .",
    "although the w s support the same population , the bluer continuum of ngc7130 suggests a somewhat younger population , or a mixture including a larger proportion of the younger components .",
    "the model we show in the figure is the same composite model as the one adopted for ngc5135 , with a somewhat larger contribution in flux at @xmath24020 of the bulge combined with the 10myr stellar population : 75% , while the bulge combined with the 100myr population contributes with 25% of the flux .    in summary , for the 4 sc and sd seyfert s , three present recent episodes of star formation in the nuclear region , with the hobl clearly visible in the spectra , while one presents @xmath110% mass contribution of an intermediate age population .",
    "the above results can be compared with those from the synthesis of ssc99 .",
    "there is good agreement for most galaxies for which the hobl are observed in the spectra : the young components in our simple models coincide , approximately , with the dominant young components obtained by ssc99 .",
    "one systematic difference seems to be the contribution of the intermediate age components , found to be present in most cases by ssc99 , but only in approximately half of the sample here .",
    "we attribute this difference to two factors : ( 1 ) the models of ssc99 were not as strongly constrained in the blue end of the spectrum as in the present work , provinding an optimized representaion of the data over the espectral range @xmath037007000 ; ( 2 ) the lower metallicity of some of the star clusters used to construct the 1gyr template , which is a mixture of spectra of lmc and milky way disk clusters , while the synthesis performed by ssc99 is based on a grid of parameters including the high metallicity end .",
    "gonzlez delgado et al . ( 2000 , gd00 ) have recently finished a similar spectral study in which they investigate the age of the stellar population at and around the nucleus of a sample of ( also ) 20 seyfert2 galaxies .",
    "they cover the spectral region @xmath03700 - 4400at a similar spectral resolution to our observed spectra , but using models with the same resolution .",
    "this better resolution in the modeling allows the detection of the hei absorption ( e.g. @xmath23819 , 4387 adn 4922 ) in some cases , providing a better dating of the starbursts .",
    "the higher spectral resolution also allows a more precise evaluation of the emission - line contamination in the high order balmer lines .",
    "gd00 find signatures of recent star formation in the nuclear spectrum of 6 galaxies plus 3 or 4 cases in which these signatures are found once the nebular balmer emission lines are subtracted .",
    "in two other cases they find significant contribution of intermediate age stars .",
    "there are 5 galaxies in the sample of gd00 in common with the present study : mrk348 , mrk573 , ngc1386 , ngc5135 and ngc7130 .",
    "similarly to what we have found , they conclude that mrk348 , mrk573 and ngc1386 have a dominant old stellar population , and that the near - uv nuclear spectrum of ngc5135 and ngc7130 is dominated by light from young and intermediate age stars .",
    "as pointed out above , there is a degeneracy between the power - law and starburst continua for ages @xmath310myrs .",
    "this occurs for mass contributions of the young component much smaller than those in the models of fig .",
    "6 : for example , for a typical 30% flux contribution of pl / ys at @xmath24020 , if it is due to the continuum of a 10myr stellar population , the corresponding mass contribution is only @xmath10.015% that of the bulge .",
    "this degeneracy is illustrated in fig .",
    "18 , where we plot the combined spectrum of a bulge and a pl contributing with 20% and 40% in flux at @xmath24020 , together with the combined spectra of the bulge and a 10myr star cluster template , for the same proportions in flux as the pl , and with the combined spectrum of the bulge and a 3myr star cluster contributing in flux with half the proportions above , namely 10% and 20% .",
    "a young starburst in nature will most probably present a spread in age , and the spectral distribution will probably be more similar to a combination of the 3 and 10myr templates .    it can be observed that , for @xmath223500 , the combination with a pl can hardly be distinguished from that with the young burst templates if their contribution to the flux is 20% . the only constraint here could be the strength of the emission lines .",
    "figure 18 shows that contributions in flux @xmath2340% at @xmath24020and good signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio spectra are necessary to allow the distinction between a featureless pl and a young starburst in terms of continuum features , such as the hobl .",
    "additional constraints could be the emission - line strengths and the uv spectrum slope .",
    "the uv spectrum can be observed rising much more steeply for the 10myr stellar population than for the pl .",
    "unfortunately our data do not extend enough to the uv to allow the use of this constraint .    in our sample ,",
    "the pl / ys contribution is always smaller than or equal to 30% , and it is thus not possible to determine its origin from the near - uv features alone . in storchi - bergmann et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , we have discussed the origin of the near - uv continuum of mrk348 and mrk573 : in the former , from the work of tran ( 1995a , b , c ) , @xmath110% of the flux is due to scattered light , and thus the remainder could be due to young stars .",
    "population synthesis has indeed shown that a mixture of a 10myr and a 3myr stellar population can reproduce the continuum . in mrk573 , at least part of the blue continuum is also due to scattered light , as revealed by the images of pogge & de robertis ( 1993 ) , but we have no constraint on its value .    the only constraint we could try to use here is the strength of the emission - lines ; for example , if the near - uv continuum were entirely due to a very young starburst ( the 3myr one ) , the equivalent widths w@xmath24 s of the balmer emission lines in the nuclear spectra should be similar to that of the model combining the bulge and the 3myr template .",
    "most frequent in nature is however the case in which there is some spread in age for the starburst so that the blue continuum is also due to non - ionizing ( ageing ) blue stars , and the w@xmath24 s should then be smaller than in the simple model with the 3myr template .",
    "we have measured the equivalent width w@xmath25 of the nuclear h@xmath26 emission line and found that it was smaller than in the simple model above for the 2 radio galaxies pks0349 - 27 , pks0634 - 20 and for ngc6890 , and about the same order for ngc3081 . in all other cases",
    " 3c33 , mrk348 , mrk573 , and mcg05 - 27 - 13 , the observed nuclear w@xmath25 s are larger than in the model .",
    "we can thus conclude that , if a starburst is the origin of the blue continuum in the above galaxies , it is an ageing one ( age@xmath2310myr ) for the first three above , and could be a very young ( @xmath13myr ) in the other cases .",
    "but we also remark that , although the blue continuum could be due to young stars , the emission - line ratios in all cases ( and even the w s in the last three cases ) require additional ionizing sources  in other words , the starburst continuum can not account alone for the emission - line ratios ( and emission - line luminosities in the last three cases ) .",
    "a comparison can be made between the near - uv properties of the seyfert s above and non - seyfert s of the same hubble type . using the caiik w s values from bica & alloin ( 1987 ) as representative of a sample of normal galaxies , we obtain the following typical values , calculated as averages from approximately 30 galaxies of each hubble type : ( i ) for sa s , w@xmath27=16.5@xmath281.6 ; ( ii ) for sb s , w@xmath27=13.8@xmath284.2  and ( iii ) for sc s , w@xmath27=9.9@xmath284.9 .",
    "note that for later types , the spread of w s increases , simply reflecting the variety of mixtures of old ( bulge ) stellar population and star - forming events in the central region of these galaxies . for ellipticals and s0 s , similar values to those of sa",
    "galaxies are obtained . from the 20 seyfert s ,",
    "11 are early - type galaxies , classified as s0 or sa ; in ngc1358 and fairall316 , w@xmath27 is typical of early - type galaxies ; in the other 9 , the w s are smaller , indicating the need of a blue continuum .",
    "this blue continuum is clearly due to recent ( age @xmath29myr ) enhanced star - formation in eso362-g8 and in mrk1210 , and to intermediate age stars in iras11215 - 2806 , and eso417-g6 . for mrk348 , mrk573 and ngc3081 , a pl",
    "/ ys component is favored .",
    "this component is at least partially due to scattered light observed as polarized light in mrk348 and mrk573 , but the unpolarized flux could be partially originated in the continuum of a nuclear starburst younger than 10myr .",
    "nine sample galaxies have later hubble types , from sb to sd .",
    "contrarily to the earlier types , the w@xmath27 values are within the range observed for non - seyfert s .",
    "four of these galaxies present recent ( age @xmath4500myr ) episodes of star - formation in the nuclei as revealed by the hobl in ngc7582 , ngc5643 , ngc5135 and ngc7130 .",
    "ngc1386 , ngc6300 and mrk607 are cases in which there is enhanced contribution of an intermediate age population of @xmath11gyr .",
    "mcg5 - 27 - 13 and ngc6890 are cases in which a pl / ys is necessary .    in summary ,",
    "recent star formation episodes have been found in the nuclei of 2 of the 11 early type seyfert s and 4 of the 9 late type seyfert s , showing a tendency of these episodes to be found more frequently in late - type seyfert s .",
    "we have constructed models combining spectral distributions of a typical bulge plus a young stellar population template in the spectral range @xmath03600 - 4100  in order to investigate the detectability of recent star - formation episodes in the nuclear region of seyfert galaxies , which usually have prominent bulges .",
    "the high order balmer lines ( hobl ) are good indicators of the presence of young to intermediate age populations as far as the mass contribution of these young components , as compared with the bulge mass , is larger than 1% for ages of @xmath1100myr , or larger than @xmath10.1% for ages of @xmath110myr .",
    "we conclude in addition that the continuum ratio cr=@xmath23660/@xmath24020 is an important discriminator of very young stellar populations , as its value can only be larger than cr=0.6 for models including stellar populations younger than 50myr .",
    "if the flux contribution at @xmath24020 of these very young populations is smaller than 40% ( corresponding to 0.02% of the mass of the bulge for the 10myr template ) , it is not possible to distinguish its spectral signatures ( e.g. , the hobl ) from a featureless power - law .",
    "thus , the problem of degeneracy between the featureless agn continuum and the continuum of a stellar population of 10myr or younger still remains at the above flux levels .    by comparing the nuclear spectrum of a sample of 20 seyfert2 s and 3 radio - galaxies with the models above , signatures of recent to intermediate age star - formation in the form of high - order balmer absorption lines ( hobl ) have been found in 9 seyfert2 s . from previous analyses of the emission - line features , enhanced recent",
    "star - formation has been found also in mrk1210 . in summary ,",
    "half of our seyfert2 sample show signatures of young to intermediate stars . in six cases ( 30% of the sample ) , the starburst is younger than 500myrs : eso362-g8 , ngc7582 , ngc5135 , ngc5643 and ngc7130 . in the cases of eso417-g6 ,",
    "iras11215 - 2806 ngc1386 and ngc6300 the hobl are due to a large contribution of intermediate age ( 1gyr ) stars .",
    "intermediate age stars seem to contribute also to the nuclear spectrum of ic1816 , ngc6890 and the radio galaxy 3c33 .",
    "the incidence of recent star formation seems to be related to the hubble type in our sample of 20 seyfert2 s : signatures from young components with ages @xmath4500myr have been found in 4 of the 9 late - type galaxies , but only in 2 of the 11 early - type galaxies .",
    "this tendency seems to be present also in the sample of gonzzlez delgado et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .      out of the nine early - type galaxies without recent central star - formation",
    ", the stellar population is well reproduced by the bulge template in two of them , by the bulge plus 10% contribution in mass of an intermediate population in other three , while in the remaining four , a power - law seems to be necessary .",
    "the nature of the latter component requires further investigation , due to its degeneracy with very young ( @xmath310myr ) stellar population spectra in the wavelength range investigated here .",
    "if such component were due to very young stars in all cases , then the number of seyfert2 with significant contribution from young stars to the nuclear spectra would increase to 12 ( 60% ) , in our sample of 20 seyfert2 s .",
    "it is essential to continue the present investigation along two lines : ( 1 ) assess the statistical significance of our findings observing a larger and well defined sample of seyfert2 s , together with a comparison sample of normal galaxies of the same hubble types ; ( 2 ) investigate the nature of the power - law continuum .",
    "the degeneracy of this continuum with those from very young stellar populations could be raised , in principle , in the uv spectral region .",
