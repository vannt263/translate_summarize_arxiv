    "the discovery by hst and large ground - based telescopes , of a large population of superstar clusters ( sscs ) in a large variety of galaxies ( see ho 1997 , martn hernndez et al . 2005 , and melo et al . 2005 ) , has driven the community to speculate about the impact that these new units of star formation may have on the ism of their host galaxies .",
    "sscs with a mass , m@xmath1 , ranging from a few @xmath2 m@xmath3 to up to 6 @xmath4 m@xmath3 ( see walcher et al .",
    "2004 ; pasquali et al .",
    "2004 ) all within a small volume of radius 3 to 10 pc , are indeed some of the most energetic entities within galaxies .",
    "their large uv photon output and mechanical energy are now believed to be the largest negative feedback agents in starburst galaxies , leading not only to a large - scale structuring of the ism and to limit star formation , but also to be the agents capable of establishing as in m82 a supergalactic wind , thereby removing processed material from galaxies and causing the contamination of the igm ( tenorio - tagle et al .",
    "2003 ) .    in the present series of papers however",
    ", we have shown that there is a threshold limit that massive and energetic compact clusters may cross to find out that radiative cooling inhibits their stationary outflow condition ( silich et al . , 2004 ) and then the matter ejected by the stellar sources , unable to escape , is to accumulate within the star cluster volume ( tenorio - tagle et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the facts in such cases are that radiative cooling drastically diminishes the sound speed and the pressure gradient within the thermalized ejected matter , inhibiting the possibility of a wind .",
    "radiative cooling upsets the stationary condition in which the deposited matter ( @xmath5 ) has to equal , at all times , the amount of matter streaming out of the sc volume , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the amount of energy injected by stellar winds and sne , @xmath8 is the local sound speed at the sc surface and @xmath9 is the resultant wind terminal speed in the absence of radiative cooling .",
    "as soon as this happens , the ejecta begins to accumulate , promoting larger densities and an even faster cooling within the ssc volume .",
    "the location of the threshold line in the @xmath7 _ vs _ size ( @xmath10 ) diagram ( see figure 1 ) , the line that defines whether or not a wind is inhibited , depends on several variables .",
    "it depends on the size of the star - forming region ( @xmath10 ) , the metallicity of the ejected gas , which has a strong impact on the cooling curve ( see paper iii ) .",
    "it also depends on the assumed @xmath11 or adiabatic terminal speed ( @xmath12 ) of the wind .",
    "the latter is also bound to the usual assumption that the energy deposited by sn is always @xmath13 erg but the mass of potential sne within the cluster ranges from , say , 100 m@xmath3 to 8 m@xmath3 and so the injection speed ( similar to @xmath12 ) and the deposited amount of matter are also functions of time .",
    "another factor that strongly affects the location of the threshold line is the thermalization efficiency ( @xmath14 ) which simply defines the fraction of the mechanical energy that can be evenly spread within the cluster volume .",
    "estimates of @xmath14 by several authors lead to values between 1 ( chevalier & clegg ; 1985 ) to 0.03 ( see melioli & del pino 2004 and references therein ) and depends simply on the proximity of the sources undergoing winds and sne , which through radiation may reduce the amount of energy available after thermalization .",
    "we have shown that there are three different types of solutions : sscs far away from the threshold line ( low mass , low energy clusters ) undergo a quasi - adiabatic evolution well described by the chevalier & clegg ( 1985 ) and cant et al .",
    ", ( 2000 ) solution .",
    "more energetic clusters are to have strongly radiative winds .",
    "cooling hardly affects their velocity ( @xmath15 ) and density distribution ( @xmath16 ) , but their temperature instead of falling as @xmath17 , it falls rapidly to @xmath18 k close to the sc boundary and the more so , the closer they are to the threshold line .",
    "the strongly radiative winds around such clusters lead , compared to the adiabatic solution , to very much reduced x - ray envelope sizes .",
    "the third solution is for clusters above the threshold line .",
    "these would have their winds inhibited and as shown below , this turns them into very efficient positive feedback star - forming agents .    here",
    "we follow the evolution of a massive and compact cluster and show the fate of the mass reinserted back , through winds and sne , into the sc volume .",
    "section 2 and 3 give a full description of ssc as positive feedback agents and section 4 summarizes our conclusions .",
    "here we follow the evolution of a stellar cluster , assumed to be the result of an instantaneous or coeval burst of star formation .",
    "the cluster has an initial total mass in stars ( @xmath19 ) equal to 10@xmath20 m@xmath3 within an @xmath10 = 5 pc . we assume a standard salpeter imf and an upper and lower mass limits equal to 100 m@xmath3 and 1 m@xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the mechanical energy of the cluster @xmath21erg s@xmath22 places our example cluster in the zone where stationary superwinds are inhibited ( see figure 1 ) and thus the mass returned by the stars ( @xmath5 ) begins immediately to accumulate within the star cluster volume , favoring an even faster cooling .",
    "figure 2 shows how the density of the accumulating gas ( @xmath23 ; where @xmath24 the evolution time ) , grows as a function of time within the ssc volume .",
    "following this trend , clearly there is a moment when the density of the accumulating gas will exceed the gravitational instability criteria @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the jeans density and @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the boltzmann constant , gravitational constant , mean mass per particle and the ratio of specific heats ( 5/3 ) , respectively and @xmath29 is the ssc radius in pc units . at that moment , when @xmath30 collapse will inevitably proceed .",
    "the initial ample supply of uv photons ( @xmath31 = 10@xmath32 photons s@xmath22 , see figure 3a ) , exceeds at first the number of recombinations within the volume occupied by the reinserted gas and the resultant hii region , given the large metallicities of the ejecta , is here assumed to rapidly approach an equilibrium temperature @xmath33 a few @xmath34 k. at these temperatures the sound speed ( @xmath35 10 km s@xmath22 ) remains well below the escape speed ( @xmath36 km s@xmath22 ) and the reinserted gas would inevitably continue to accumulate to rapidly ( within @xmath37 yr ) reach the value of the jeans density for a gas at say , @xmath38 = 5000 k , and collapse into a new stellar generation .",
    "the event gives rise to a new phase of matter accumulation , which once more will rapidly approach @xmath26 ( for @xmath39= 5000 k ) and undergo collapse within a free - fall time , of the order of 10@xmath40 yr , while transforming @xmath41 m@xmath3 into stars .",
    "all stellar generations resultant from mass accumulation within the ssc volume have here been assumed to also acquire a salpeter imf with similar upper and lower mass limits as those imposed to the main superstar cluster , and their resultant properties ( mechanical energy and uv photon output ) have been added to those produced by the main cluster .    a few , almost identical , stellar generations are expected from the accumulation process ( solid rising lines in figure 2 ) , every time that the accumulated gas density @xmath42 reaches @xmath43 ( dashed line in figure 2 ) .",
    "the situation changes slightly when the number of ionizing photons ( @xmath31 ) , despite the added contribution of secondary stellar generations , becomes insufficient to fully ionize the accumulated matter within the star cluster volume .",
    "this is due to the evolution of the main cluster , whose uv photon output begins to fall as @xmath44 after @xmath45 3.5 myr ( dotted line in figure 3a ) .",
    "figure 2 shows @xmath46 ( thin solid line ) , the maximum density within the accumulating volume that can be supported fully ionized by the uv radiation produced by the evolving cluster ( @xmath47 ; where @xmath48 and @xmath49 , the recombination coefficient to all levels above the ground level = 2.59 @xmath50 @xmath51 s@xmath22 ) . during the accumulation process ,",
    "once @xmath42 exceeds @xmath46 , the ionized volume begins to shrink to end up as a collection of ultra compact hii regions around the most massive stars left within the cluster , while the bulk of the ejected material , now recombined , continues to cool , approaching rapidly ( within a time - scale of less than 1000 yr ) a temperature @xmath45 100 k. matter is at all times uniformly replenished within the whole ssc volume , and thus the gas density presents an almost uniform value .",
    "however , the accumulating gas now has two different temperatures ( @xmath38 and 100 k ) and as @xmath42 grows and the fraction of the ionized volume ( @xmath52 ) shrinks , the size of cold condensations ( at 100 k ) able to become gravitationally unstable and their free - fall time also become smaller .",
    "the drop in the number of ionizing photons ( figure 3a ) and the consequent growth of the neutral volume ( figure 3b ) lead then to a second important condition in which the characteristic accumulation time @xmath53 becomes equal to the free - fall time @xmath54 .",
    "this condition defines @xmath55 , the density above the jeans instability limit for a neutral condensation at 100 k ( @xmath26(100k ) ) : @xmath56^{1/3 }   r_{sc}^{-2 } = \\frac{1.15 \\times 10^{-18}}{(1 - f_{hii})^{2/3 } }                 \\left(\\frac{\\dot m}{1m_\\odot yr^{-1 } }                 \\right)^{2/3 } \\left(\\frac{r_{sc}}{1pc}\\right)^{-2 } , \\ ] ] and thus once @xmath42 ( see figure 2 ) becomes equal to @xmath55 , a new stationary solution becomes possible .",
    "everything happens very rapidly , compared to the evolution time - scale of the parental cluster ( @xmath45 40 myr ) , and almost at the same time .",
    "the ejected matter is thermalized within the ssc volume and immediately begins to cool . at the same time that it accumulates making cooling even faster .",
    "this allows it to rapidly reach the required @xmath55 value , above the jeans instability limit , that warrants its collapse in a similar time - scale , while the collapsing material is replenished by the newly ejected matter .",
    "when this happens , the mass deposition rate from the cluster becomes equal to the rate of star formation .",
    "gravitational collapse and star formation within the star cluster volume and with the matter injected by all sources , drive in this way a new stationary condition through a new era of quasi - continuous star formation in which @xmath0 is equal now to the star formation rate ( sfr ) .",
    "all new generations of stars are due to deposit their ejecta from winds and sne during @xmath57 myr , the expected duration of the type ii sn phase in coeval star clusters ( leitherer & heckman 1995 ) , and at a rate that depends only on the mass of the stellar generation .",
    "re - processing leads to an escalating @xmath0 , as this is directly proportional to the total mass in stars @xmath58 created within the star cluster volume ; where @xmath59 marks the start of the quasi - continuous star - forming phase and @xmath19 accounts for the initial mass in stars and for all generations prior to the quasi - continuous star formation phase ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "this promotes a larger star formation rate , and a faster fulfillment of the collapse conditions ( @xmath60 , and @xmath61 ) . under these conditions",
    "the sfr is : @xmath62 this equation has an exponential solution : @xmath63 } , \\ ] ] where the characteristic time @xmath64 .",
    "equation ( [ sf.b ] ) remains valid during the supernovae phase of the parental cluster . within this time interval , the continuous re - processing of the ejected material drives , as shown in figure 4 , the star formation rate to grow exponentially : @xmath65 } .\\ ] ] note that the characteristic time @xmath66 is defined by the coeval star cluster model and is applicable to both the initial cluster and also to every new generation of stars formed from the re - ejected material .",
    "if one assumes that the energy and mass deposition rates remain constant during a star cluster life time and that @xmath12 , the resultant terminal speed in the absence of radiative cooling , equals 1500 km s@xmath22 for all clusters , upon normalizing to the energy deposition rate adopted for the parental 10@xmath20 m@xmath3 cluster ( @xmath67 erg s@xmath22 ) , then @xmath68 yr , where @xmath69 is the mass in each stellar generation , including the initial or parent cluster .",
    "the total mass in stars born within the star cluster volume , over the characteristic time @xmath70 myr , is given by equation ( [ sf.b ] ) .",
    "we have here shown that massive and compact coeval clusters instead of driving a superwind able to disperse the surrounding ism and even channel its way into the igm , events that have make them been regarded as negative feedback agents , they are in fact extreme examples of positive star formation feedback .",
    "massive and compact coeval clusters appear in the @xmath71 _ vs _ size diagram above the threshold line , in the region where radiative cooling inhibits the development of stationary superwinds .",
    "we have here shown that in such cases the matter reinserted , through stellar winds and supernovae , is unable to escape and that after a short phase of matter accumulation , a new stationary solution in which @xmath0 becomes equal to the sfr is rapidly met . a positive feedback condition in which new stellar generations result in situ , from the collapse of the matter reinserted by the sources evolving within the star cluster volume .",
    "the secondary star formation process while causing a faster mass deposition rate , drives the sfr to grow from 0.1 to 0.25 m@xmath3 yr@xmath22 over the parent cluster supernova phase ( @xmath72 40 myr ) .",
    "the continuous re - processing of the ejected material leads effectively to a continuous transformation of the high mass stars into a low mass ( @xmath73 8 m@xmath3 ) population , keeping constant the total mass of the stellar component . in this way",
    "massive clusters may survive as gravitationally bound systems ( see discussion in dale et al .",
    "2005 and martn - hernndez et al .",
    "2005 and references therein ) .",
    "a central issue , regarding ism studies , is the fact that the more massive and compact clusters ( as those detected by hst and large ground - based telescopes ) , are unable to generate superwinds and shed their metals into the ism or the igm .",
    "their evolution leads to many stellar generations and thus to a mixture of stellar populations , all contaminated by the products from former stellar generations .",
    "exacerbated episodes of star formation that leave no trace of their evolution in the ism .",
    "clearly , if the most massive star formation events do not contribute to the chemical evolution of their parent galaxy , then several issues , such as the mass - metallicity relationship between galaxies , ought to be revised .",
