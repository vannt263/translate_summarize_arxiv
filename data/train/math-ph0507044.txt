    "in very rough terms , the scaling law devised by kolmogorov and obukhov for turbulent 3d fluids ( usually referred as k41 , see  @xcite and a detailed discussion in  @xcite ) , says that @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the second order structure function and @xmath2 is the mean energy dissipation rate .",
    "moreover , it is specified that this law is valid at very high reynolds numbers and for distances @xmath3 in a certain range between the integral range and the kolmogorov dissipation scale , having the order @xmath4 .",
    "although the numerical essence of these claims may be clear , their precise mathematical interpretation is not necessarily unique and could change a little bit depending on new discoveries .",
    "the purpose of this note is to give one possible precise mathematical formulation of this scaling law and to discuss it from a number of viewpoints .",
    "we immediately stress that we can not prove its validity for the 3d navier - stokes equations , but nevertheless we obtain a number of insights that seem worth to be known .",
    "some of our considerations are true for quite general families of probability measures ; others will be specific to the stochastic navier - stokes equations on the torus @xmath5   ^{d}$ ] , @xmath6 , @xmath7 with @xmath8 and periodic boundary conditions , with suitable vector fields @xmath9 and independent brownian motions @xmath10 ( the torus instead of a more realistic framework has been chosen for mathematical simplicity ) .",
    "we consider this equation in the limit @xmath11 .",
    "since the force does not vanish as @xmath12 , this is a singular limit problem much like the boundary layer one , and so may be considered as a prototype of high reynold number singular limit problem , with some mathematical simplification due to the advantages produced by stochastic analysis . it should be noted that another possible and interesting approach to the zero - viscosity limit is the one adopted in  @xcite ( for the @xmath13 case ) , where the amplitude of the forcing noise is proportional to the square - root of the viscosity .    in the following",
    "we shall use the parameter @xmath14 in place of the reynolds number ; this simplification is justified in our model since the force and the domain are given , so the reynolds number goes to infinity if and only if @xmath12 .",
    "we shall denote by @xmath15 the natural space of finite energy velocity fields on the torus and we shall introduce a space @xmath16 of probability measures on @xmath15 having certain symmetries and regularities ( precise definitions are given in the next section ) . on the fields @xmath17 we shall assume conditions such that there exists at least one stationary probability measure @xmath18 associated to ( [ stochns ] ) ( stationary measures will be defined in the next section ) .",
    "we use the notation @xmath19   : = \\int_{h}f\\left (   u\\right ) d\\mu\\left (   u\\right)\\ ] ] whenever the integral is well defined .    for every @xmath18",
    "we introduce the _ second order structure function _",
    "@xmath20 \\label{struct}\\ ] ] for some coordinate unitary vector @xmath21 , with @xmath22 ( the results proved below extend to the so called longitudinal structure function ; we consider ( [ struct ] ) to fix the ideas ) .",
    "the measures of @xmath16 are supported on continuous vector fields , so the pointwise operations in ( [ struct ] ) are meaningful .",
    "moreover , the symmetries in @xmath16  imply that @xmath23 is independent of the coordinate unitary vector @xmath21 ( in addition most of the estimates proved in the sequel extend to every unitary vector @xmath21 ) .",
    "we are going to define k41 scaling law for a set @xmath24 .",
    "the reason is that equation ( [ stochns ] ) may have ( a priori ) more than one stationary measure for any given @xmath25 and in certain claims it seems easier to consider a set of measures for a given @xmath25 . given @xmath26 we use the notation @xmath27 for the set section @xmath28 .",
    "given @xmath29 , we define the _ mean energy dissipation rate _ as @xmath30   ^{d}}\\left\\|   du\\left (   x\\right )   \\right\\|   ^{2}dx\\right ]   .\\ ] ]    if @xmath31 is a stationary measure of ( [ stochns ] ) and a mean energy _ equality _ ( coming from it formula )  can be rigorously proved , one can show that @xmath2 does not depend on @xmath32 .    given @xmath29",
    ", we also define the quantity @xmath33    in case of equations ( [ stochns ] ) , @xmath34 is a length scale : @xmath25 has dimension @xmath35   ^{2}\\left [   t\\right ]   ^{-1}$ ] , @xmath2 has dimension @xmath35   ^{2}\\left [   t\\right ]   ^{-3}$ ] , so @xmath34 has dimension @xmath35   $ ] .",
    "the only combination of @xmath25 and @xmath2 in powers , having dimension @xmath35   $ ] , is the @xmath34 above .",
    "this is the simplest reason to choose @xmath34 as a length scale involved in k41 theory .",
    "more refined arguments may be found in  @xcite and related references .",
    "let us come to the definition of k41 scaling law chosen in this work . here and in the sequel ,",
    "when we talk about a set @xmath36 , we tacitly assume that @xmath37 since otherwise several definitions and statements would be just empty .",
    "[ defk41]we say that a scaling law of k41 type holds true for a set @xmath36 if there exist @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and a monotone function @xmath41\\rightarrow\\mathbb{r}_{+}$ ] with @xmath42 and @xmath43 , such that the bound @xmath44 holds for every pair @xmath45 and every @xmath3 such that @xmath46 $ ] and @xmath47    for simplicity we could have asked the scaling property for @xmath48 for a constant @xmath49 ( a measure of the integral scale ) .",
    "however , such a formulation could be too restrictive .",
    "on the other hand , it is necessary that the range of @xmath3 s increases to infinity ( relative to @xmath34 ) as @xmath12 , otherwise the property becomes trivial , see remark [ local property ] .",
    "this is the mathematical formulation of k41 theory that we analyse in this note .",
    "here is a list of facts we can prove around it . in summary , they have the structure of certain _ necessary conditions _ for k41 , and certain almost _ equivalent conditions_.    * we introduce a measure @xmath50 of the length scale where dissipation takes place , defined as @xmath51   ^{d}}\\left\\|   du\\left ( x\\right )   \\right\\|   ^{2}dx\\right ]   } { \\mu\\left [   \\int_{\\left [   0,1\\right ] ^{d}}\\left\\|   d^{2}u\\left (   x\\right )   \\right\\|   ^{2}dx\\right ]   } \\label{theta}\\ ] ] and prove a claim of the following form ( theorem [ theorem on theta ] ) :  if a scaling law holds on a range @xmath52 , then @xmath53 in other words , the scale at which dissipation dominates can not overlap with the range over which a fractal scaling law holds . * since @xmath50 is constant ( with respect to @xmath25 )  for both the 2d stochastic navier - stokes equations and the stokes ( linear )  equations , we can rule out k41 scaling law for such systems . for the theory of 2d stochastic navier - stokes equations",
    "this seems a remarkable fact .",
    "moreover , these facts tell us that , in case definition [ defk41 ] holds true in the 3d case , it is strictly due to _ 3d nonlinear _ effects .",
    "this is further emphasised by the following result .",
    "* for the 3d stochastic navier - stokes equations we prove that , if k41 holds , then the _ mean vortex stretching _",
    "@xmath54\\ ] ] ( where we set @xmath55 ) must be very large , essentially at least as large as @xmath56 .",
    "see corollaries   [ stretching under additional hp ] and  [ 3dsecondcorollary ] .",
    "vortex stretching is thus a basic mechanism in k41 theory .",
    "* we apply a known scaling transformation ( see  @xcite ) and introduce an auxiliary family [ e : sns ] of stochastic navier - stokes equations with modified domain and viscosity .",
    "then we introduce a condition on this family of equations , called _",
    "condition  [ conda ] _ , and prove it is equivalent to the scaling law of k41 type .",
    "this is conceptually interesting since condition  [ conda ] is of rather qualitative nature , while its consequence ( the scaling law of k41 type ) is more quantitative .",
    "more specifically , the behaviour @xmath57 , and also the exponent @xmath58 in the definition of @xmath34 , arise from the stochastic navier - stokes equations themselves , through a scaling transformation , when certain bounds ( without special exponents ) are fulfilled for the auxiliary family . *",
    "we give other necessary and sufficient conditions for k41 , starting from condition  [ conda ] . in plain words , they state that the large structures of @xmath59 have bounded mean square gradients ( or bounded mean enstrophy ) , while the small structures have bounded mean energy . * as a mild support to the belief that all these conditions could be true in dimension @xmath60 , we finally exhibit a random field that satisfies them , and was constructed independently from this purpose in  @xcite as a model of turbulent fluid inspired by the vortex structures usually observed in numerical simulations .",
    "the remainder of the article is structured as follows .",
    "the remainder of the present section introduces the notations that will be used throughout this work . in section  [ sec : neccond ] , we draw several conclusions from our formulation of the k41 scaling law that allow us to give stringent necessary conditions for it to hold .",
    "these conditions are sufficient to rule out any non - trivial scaling law in the 2d case .",
    "we proceed in section  [ sec : necsuf ] to find a condition that turns out to be equivalent to k41 .",
    "this condition is then shown in section  [ sec : eddy ] to hold for a random eddy model introduced in @xcite .",
