    "the x  ray source 2xmm j011028.1460421 ( better known as hlx1 ) @xcite has attracted attention because it is positionally coincident with the outer regions of the edge  on spiral galaxy eso 24349 @xcite at a redshift of 0.0224 . the detection at the position of hlx1 of a narrow @xmath3 emission line with redshift corresponding to that of eso 24349 @xcite has been seen as confirming the association of hlx1 with this galaxy , although the association of this line with the accretion flow emitting the x  rays has still to be conclusively demonstrated .",
    "the assumption that hlx1 is physically associated with this galaxy ( at a distance @xmath4  mpc ) has far  reaching consequences .",
    "it implies an unabsorbed isotropic 0.210  kev luminosity for hlx1 of @xmath5  ergs@xmath6 at maximum , making it the brightest known hyperluminous x  ray source ( hlx ) .",
    "the additional assumptions that the source radiates at no more than ten times the standard eddington luminosity @xcite , and that its emission is isotropic , would give a minimum accretor mass @xmath7 in this sense hlx1 is the best current candidate for an intermediate  mass black hole ( imbh ) .",
    "observations of hlx1 place tight constraints on models .",
    "the source shows a sequence of near  regular outbursts lasting @xmath8 days .",
    "for the four outbursts between 2009 and 2012 the recurrence time was @xmath9 days , but the 2013 outburst started about 1 month ` late ' @xcite .",
    "multiwavelength observations of hlx1 during 20092013 reveal outburst properties resembling those of low  mass x ",
    "ray binaries ( lmxbs : e.g. remillard & mcclintock 2006 ) in several respects .",
    "it is widely accepted that these outbursts are well described by the thermal  viscous disc instability model ( tvdim , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , when account is taken of self  irradiation of the disc by the central x  rays ( cf * ? ? ?",
    ". however @xcite showed that a disc instability model with an imbh accretor could not explain the light curve of hlx1 if the system was assumed to be at the 95  mpc distance implied by the putative association with eso 24349 .",
    "in fact all such models require the source to be well within the local group , and to have a stellar mass accretor @xcite .    given this difficulty ,",
    "more unusual models have appeared .",
    "these inevitably pay the price of requiring very special conditions .",
    "@xcite suggested that the outbursts might be periodic mass transfer events on to an imbh accretor , triggered when a star on an eccentric orbit about the black hole fills its tidal lobe at pericentre .",
    "the problem here is that the @xmath10 decay time of the light curve is presumably viscous , and so requires a small disc radius @xmath11 @xcite . but to give the nearly periodic repetitions of the outbursts , the orbital period must be of order 1  yr , implying a semi  major axis @xmath12 , and so an orbital eccentricity @xmath13 improbably close to unity ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "there are problems with the stability of such an orbit , but worse , the 1month ` delay ' of the 2013 outburst is very hard to reconcile with the eccentric binary picture .",
    "further , the observed outburst rise times of only a few days appear to require an accretion disc structure very different from anything so far considered @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed a modified version of the imbh  enhanced mass - transfer model in which a high - mass giant star has had most of its envelope tidally stripped by an imbh in hlx1 only @xmath15 years ago .",
    "the remaining core plus low  mass hydrogen envelope is assumed to be currently feeding the imbh via an ( unrealistically ) strong wind .",
    "this model produces a disc smaller than in the roche ",
    "lobe overflow case but the rise  time and x / v delay still require non  standard disc physics . in addition , we must be viewing this system at an extremely unusual epoch .",
    "but there is a simple alternative model compatible with the 95 mpc distance .",
    "we take hlx1 as the brightest known ultraluminous x  ray source ( ulx ) . a commonly  accepted model for ulxs",
    "is that they are stellar  mass x ",
    "ray binaries with such high mass transfer rates that this leads to geometrical collimation or beaming of most of their emission @xcite . in this picture",
    "the emitted fluxes are highly anisotropic , and multiplying them by @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the source distance , overestimates the intrinsic source luminosity by the inverse beaming factor @xmath18 .",
    "this picture is known to work well in explaining the majority of observed ulxs ( see below ) , so it is worth asking if it can also explain hlx1 .",
    "we consider this idea here , and see that it leads to a suggestive analogy between hlx1 and the well  known extreme galactic binary ss433 , often believed to be a ulx system viewed from outside the beaming angle .",
    "@xcite used the observed scaling between soft x  ray luminosity and temperature in a class of ulxs to deduce the relation @xmath19 between the beaming factor @xmath20 and the eddington ratio @xmath21 , assumed @xmath22 .",
    "we define the latter as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the mass transfer rate feeding the accretion disc at large radii , @xmath25 the eddington luminosity of the mass  gaining compact object , and we have assumed an accretion efficiency @xmath26 .",
    "although the form ( [ beam ] ) is derived from considering a specific radiation component , the beaming represented by @xmath20 is assumed to be geometric , and to apply to photons of all energies emitted close to the accretor .",
    "@xcite shows that the expression ( [ beam ] ) agrees with theoretical expectations .",
    "combining ( [ beam ] ) with the usual expression for the accretion luminosity at high eddington ratios @xmath27 @xcite gives the apparent ( i.e. assumed isotropic ) luminosity of a ulx as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the accretor mass in solar units ( some authors insert dimensionless factors of order unity , or the disc aspect ratio @xmath30 , in front of the @xmath31 term here .",
    "however the dominant scaling is in the @xmath32 term expressing the beaming . )",
    "this expression implies a luminosity function for ulxs in good agreement with observations of ulxs in the local group @xcite .",
    "the majority of ulxs have moderate eddington factors @xmath33 , and so @xmath34 ( from [ lum ] ) .    applying ( [ lum ] ) to hlx1 ( @xmath35 ) and assuming that the accretor is a @xmath36 black hole , gives an eddington factor @xmath37",
    "since the eddington accretion rate for this black hole mass is @xmath38 this implies a mass transfer rate @xmath39 for hlx1 .",
    "this is similar to that inferred for ss433 @xcite .",
    "mass is transferred on the thermal timescale of the donor star , which is more massive than the compact accretor .",
    "this is a natural stage in the evolution of high  mass binaries , and directly follows the standard high  mass x  ray binary phase once the expanding donor star fills its roche lobe .",
    "the possible identification with a system like ss433 is attractive , but must pass several tests before we can accept it as a model for hlx1 .",
    "the first of these concerns the relation between beaming and distance",
    ". the eddington factor ( [ edd ] ) implies from ( [ beam ] ) a beaming factor @xmath40 , and by elementary geometry , a beam opening angle @xmath41 . we must first check that we do not require a cosmic conspiracy to be sitting in such a narrow beam , but instead that hlx1 is at a sufficiently large distance , with so many similarly  beamed systems within this volume of space that we would expect to be in the beam of at least one of them purely by chance .",
    "specifically , we consider a population of similarly  beamed systems whose host galaxies have space density @xmath42  mpc@xmath43 .",
    "we assume that each host contains @xmath44 such systems , with radiation beams oriented randomly . to be in the beam of one such object one has to search through @xmath45 galaxies , i.e. a space volume @xmath46 .",
    "the nearest suitably - oriented system of this type is thus at a distance @xmath47 where @xmath48 , and we have assumed @xmath49 , similar to l * galaxies , at the second step .",
    "( note that the corresponding equation [ 15 ] ) in @xcite has the coefficient misprinted as 660 rather than 260 . )",
    "we assume @xmath50 , i.e. that the number density @xmath51 of randomly  oriented systems with @xmath52 is similar to that of l * galaxies , but note that the result ( [ dmin ] ) is fairly insensitive to the combination @xmath51 in any case .",
    "since the distance @xmath53  mpc suggested for hlx1 is bigger than the minimum distance @xmath54 , an ss433like identification of hlx1 is so far not implausible .",
    "encouragingly , @xmath17 also does not exceed @xmath54 by large factors , which would require a further stringent constraint on the system visibility in addition to beaming to prevent us seeing systems closer to @xmath54 .",
    "of course there actually is an obvious extra constraint of this kind , but it is relatively mild  the emission of hlx1 varies in time .",
    "we consider this next .",
    "x  rays from hlx1 are bright for a significant fraction of its @xmath0  yr cycle .",
    "this makes it plausible that it should be found at a distance @xmath17 not vastly greater than the minimum distance @xmath54 .",
    "the source is apparently never undetectable , varying by a factor @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "we ascribe the variation to the same underlying process inferred for ss433 , namely that the central disc funnels collimating the radiation ( and any material jet ) precess approximately periodically . in ss433",
    "we do not look down the funnels , and the x ",
    "rays are very weak , probably representing a small component from the jets themselves ( cf * ? ? ?",
    "instead the precession is mainly seen in the radial velocity measurements of the red and blue  shifted @xmath56 lines tracing the jets .",
    "the precession period in ss433 appears to vary over a range of a few days around some mean value @xmath57  d.    we assume that the collimation of the disc funnels is purely geometrical .",
    "then the x  ray light curve of hlx1 simply reflects the motion and inherent variation of the precessing funnel visible to us .",
    "since we have worked out that the beam of hlx1 is rather narrow ( @xmath41 ) , the significant x  ray duty cycle @xmath58 must mean that the angle @xmath59 between the beam and precession axes is itself comparable to the beam angular size @xmath60 .",
    "indeed if @xmath61 , i.e. we always see x  rays from the precessing funnel , we must have @xmath62 .",
    "if instead we assume there are epochs with no beamed x  rays ( either zero x  ray flux , or a low  level unbeamed flux ) , then @xmath63 .",
    "a possible source of a relatively constant low  level flux is x  ray emission from the jets themselves .",
    "simple geometry , assuming a circular beam , gives @xmath64 for duty cycles @xmath65 respectively for the bright  phase emission .",
    "by contrast , if the precession angle @xmath59 were as large as in ss433 ( @xmath66 ) , the duty cycle would be only @xmath67 , assuming the same @xmath21 and thus @xmath20 .",
    "these estimates illustrate how easily even small changes in geometry can alter the x  ray light curves quite significantly , even with a fixed beam size .",
    "in fact we should _ expect _ variations in the light curves : the simple fact that the beams ( and any jets ) move at all means that they can not be anchored in structures with high inertia , such as the black hole spin axis or the innermost disc plane , which is closely tied to this spin axis through the lense  thirring effect @xcite .",
    "instead they must result from gaseous structures within a disc deformed by a process such as radiation warping @xcite and so subject to constant variation .",
    "the difficulty of calculating such effects means we can not give a simple argument why the precession angle in hlx1 should be rather smaller ( factors 2  3 ) than in ss433 .",
    "an obvious physical cause of inherent beam size variations is the sensitivity of the beam opening angle to accretion rate ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "a beam narrowed by an increased accretion rate would for example cause the steep rise in the x  ray light curve to be significantly delayed , as recently observed . if we crudely model this as a change in bright  phase x ",
    "ray duty cycle from @xmath69 to @xmath70 ( a @xmath71 one  month delay ) we find this requires a change in @xmath72 corresponding to a change of only a factor 1.36 in @xmath21 .",
    "an interesting question is what causes the bright  phase x ",
    "ray emission to have a characteristic rapid rise and slower decay .",
    "we must be looking directly down the x  ray beam at maximum , suggesting that the rapid rise corresponds to the funnel axis aligning with the line of sight .",
    "if this sharp collimation was the only modulation of the x  rays , we would see just a square  wave light curve ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "a simple interpretation of the slower decay we actually observe is that some scattering structure , perhaps a jet , gradually invades the line of sight as the beam precesses .",
    "a small offset of the jet from the beam axis is reasonable , since the reason for the jet precession ( and its relatively low velocity ) in ss433 is that a jet launched in a fixed direction ( the black  hole spin axis ) is deflected by a precessing gas structure @xcite .",
    "we note that all the considerations above are purely geometrical . as a result",
    "they say nothing about the x  ray spectra or state changes seen in hlx1 .",
    "however the interpretation of the system as one with a highly super  eddington mass transfer rate means that the accretion disc structure here is very different from that normally considered .",
    "there must be outflow of almost all of the transferred mass from all disc radii @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the black hole schwarzschild radius . a disc like this is well represented by a slim  disc model @xcite .",
    "we have suggested that hlx1 may be a stellar  mass binary system like ss433 , but seen along its x  ray beams .",
    "the precession of these beams gives the @xmath0  yr characteristic timescale of the light curve , while the significant x  ray duty cycle means that the precession angle must be comparable with the beam opening angle . as a consistency check ,",
    "the distance @xmath2  mpc suggested for hlx1 is only a few times larger than the minimum distance giving a reasonable chance of seeing such a highly  beamed system .",
    "put another way , we know that ss433 is simply a fairly normal high  mass binary in a very short  lived phase of its evolution , defined by the condition that the expanding blue supergiant companion is more massive than the compact accretor and currently fills its roche lobe .",
    "mass is then transferred on the thermal timescale of the supergiant .",
    "this phase automatically follows the high  mass x ",
    "ray binary ( hmxb ) phase .",
    "any galaxy with recent star formation can host systems like this  the recently  discovered system mq1 in the galaxy m83 @xcite may reveal another one @xcite .",
    "so we would expect eventually to see an example with its radiation beam pointing towards us if we search a large enough sample of galaxies , that is , out to a sufficient distance ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "since ss433 has one of the highest mass transfer rates likely to be observable in a stellar  mass binary , systems like it are the best stellar  mass candidates for the most extreme ulxs . these must be the shortest  lived , most tightly beamed , and brightest of the ulx population ( both apparently and intrinsically ) .",
    "we should then ask what the less luminous ulxs represent .",
    "all those with red companion stars  a large fraction ( middleton , private communication ) are probably soft x ",
    "ray transients in the course of long  lasting disc outbursts ( the so  called ` grs 1915like ' systems of king , 2002 ) .",
    "ulxs with blue companions are probably instead systems which are either evolving towards the ss433/hlx1 state or have just left it .",
    "the first group are moving from the wind  capture accretion of the hmxb phase towards the ss433/hlx1 state , established once the nuclear expansion of the high  mass companion makes it fill its roche lobe .",
    "the second group may have recently reversed their binary mass ratios through mass loss and transfer , so that the mass transfer process now stabilizes at a lower level than in the ss433/hlx1 state .",
    "the mq1 system referred to above may be a system like this @xcite .",
