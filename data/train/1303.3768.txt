    "realizing a sizable and stable entanglement between distant qubits is a crucial stage in performing quantum information and communication tasks  @xcite . in the ground state of noncritical strongly correlated systems with short - range interactions",
    "the 2-points correlation functions and thus the entanglement between spins vanish exponentially with the distance  @xcite .",
    "to overcome this problem , a possibility is to mediate indirect interactions between distant qubits by a suitable quantum many - body medium .",
    "for instance , one can exploit impurities weakly coupled to the ends of a spin chain to create a strong long - distance entanglement between them  @xcite . indeed",
    "a relatively large family of many - body systems allows for this possibility  @xcite .",
    "however , for most of these systems the energy gap is exponentially decreasing in the size of the system , so that even for short chains the mechanism becomes thermally unstable : very small thermal fluctuations are sufficient to mix the ground state with higher energy eigenstates and suppress the entanglement between the end impurities . one can introduce systems with interaction patterns such that the gap closes algebraically with the distance  @xcite at the price of letting the end - to - end entanglement become weakly decreasing with the size of the system  @xcite .",
    "even if all these results can be extended to higher dimensional systems  @xcite this appears to be the unavoidable limit of a purely static , ground - state approach  @xcite on the other hand , it is well known that properly tailored time evolutions can propagate entanglement through many - body systems  @xcite . in particular , global  @xcite or local quantum quenches  @xcite can create long - distance entanglement .",
    "apart from certain perturbative proposals that suffer from a very slow convergence  @xcite , the dynamical schemes in general do not require the weak end coupling assumption  @xcite and hence they hold a greater resistance against thermal instability but at the price of a much more elaborate control on the system . in conclusion , entangling distant qubits can be realized either via static or dynamic approaches , however , either at the price of a strong thermal instability or an excessively demanding control . in the present work we introduce a scheme that combines the modular - static and the quench - dynamic approaches to entanglement generation and distribution among distant qubits .",
    "the proposed mixed scheme strongly reduces the drawbacks of both approaches and realizes a novel mechanism of entanglement amplification starting from weakly entangled inputs . in our model ,",
    "a quantum spin chain is split into two elementary bulk modules .",
    "two end impurities are attached to each module with couplings of arbitrary strength .",
    "this initial static configuration is then evolved through a sudden quench of the bond connecting the two modules .",
    "we show that the generated end - to - end entanglement across the entire system is always larger than the initial entanglement at the ends of each module and that this _ entanglement amplification _ can always be achieved for all parameter ranges .",
    "as the length of each module is half the total size of the system and the impurity couplings are non perturbative , the energy gap remains sizable and thus thermal stability is assured .",
    "moreover , by exploiting just a single bond quench for inducing a nontrivial dynamics , the required control is minimal .",
    "this mechanism can demonstrate an entanglement router which unlike previous proposals neither needs ac - control of the couplings  @xcite nor the presence of both ferromagnetic and anti - ferromagnetic couplings simultaneously  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the entanglement amplification mechanism finds a clear physical explanation in the quantum interference between only two eigenvectors of the final hamiltonian .     between the impurities at the module - module boundary.,width=264,height=226 ]",
    "we consider two chains of qubits , the _ modules _ , each constituted by a bulk of spins coupled at both ends with two impurities .",

    ", one can increase @xmath21 arbitrarily and create large entanglement between the two impurities by decreasing @xmath16 .",
    "however , by decreasing @xmath16 the energy gap of the system also decreases , at best algebraically  @xcite ; when the thermal energy @xmath26 becomes comparable with the gap , the state of the system becomes a mixed thermal state with no entanglement between the end impurities . in fig .",

    "this is of course related to the concurrence  @xcite of the two impurities @xmath50 via @xmath51 and always give a lower value with respect to concurrence .",
    "we first study the case of @xmath33 and @xmath34 both sufficiently small so that the pairs of end impurities in each module are initially highly entangled ( strong initial end - to - end entanglement in both modules ) .",
    "in this situation , in each module the impurities are effectively decoupled from the rest of the system and resorting to the schrieffer - wolff transformation  @xcite one obtains an effective interaction hamiltonian for the impurities in each module @xmath52 where the effective coupling is linear in the energy gap : @xmath53 with @xmath54 . fixing the inter - module interaction bond at @xmath55 , as shown in fig .",

    "by considering many - body media with static structures of bulk modules and by engineering suitably quenched local interaction dynamics between different modules , we have introduced a method for the generation and amplification of entanglement between distant and non - interacting quantum objects .",
    "the method is intrinsically non - perturbative and does not require sophisticated controls of the system dynamics . indeed , we showed that the end - to - end entanglement initially present in the ground state of a modular many - body system is amplified by the quenched dynamics whenever all the values of the hamiltonian parameters are far from the perturbative regime .",
    "the ensuing entangling dynamics is fast and robust against thermal fluctuations as well as against the presence of noise in the amplitude interactions .",
    "the occurrence of such dynamical mechanism of entanglement amplification finds a simple and beautiful explanation in the constructive interference of only two energy eigenstates of the driving hamiltonian .",
    "this opens potentially many new perspective for studying entanglement generation , distribution , and manipulation across arbitrary distances in a many - body systems .",
    "our minimal control strategy applies immediately to the demonstration of an entanglement router capable of distributing entanglement simultaneously between multiple users .",
    "indeed , consider a setup in which every user controls one impurity in a module which extends from its position to a common dispatching center where the other impurities are controlled . in the dispatching center",
    ", one can switch on the interaction between any pair of impurities of different modules and induce the entangling dynamics in those particular chains , thus creating entanglement directly between the two users .",
    "the main advantage of such an entanglement router is the minimal control needed ( a single bond quench ) that , at variance with previous router proposals , neither requires ac - control of the couplings  @xcite nor the introduction of many different couplings  @xcite .",
