    "carbon nanotubes which are members of the fullerene family , have novel properties that make them potentially useful in many applications in electronics , optics , and other fields of nanotechnology and materials science .",
    "their strength is extraordinary , they possess unique electrical properties , and are efficient thermal conductors .",
    "the nanotube diameter is on the order of a few nanometers and the nanotube length several millimeters .",
    "nanotube ends might be capped with a hemisphere of the buckyball structure or some other material providing a potential barrier for the carrier electrons on the nanotube . furthermore , there may be a coupling between a particle s intrinsic ( spin ) and its extrinsic ( orbital motion ) degrees of freedom , thereby giving rise to a spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) term in the hamiltonian describing the energy eigenstates of the nanotube",
    ". the soi may be due to the electromagnetic interaction between the electron s spin and the nucleus electric field through which the electron moves.@xcite as a matter of fact , the soi on the nanotube is of the same type as the rashba soi at a hetrojunction of two types of semiconductors which has given rise to many interesting properties such as spontaneous spin effects in a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg).@xcite    detailed theoretical studies of the spin - orbit coupling in graphene and carbon nanotubes have been carried out recently.@xcite this work was done in conjunction with recent experiments which have shown that a gate voltage applied perpendicular to the axis of a carbon nanotube can cause an observable soi.@xcite these studies were stimulated by the consequences of the presence of soi on transport properties in carbon nanotubes .",
    "the origin of soi is that , when electrons moving in an electrostatic potential @xmath0 ( due to ions or gate fields ) experience an effective magnetic field , @xmath1 in their rest .",
    "for graphene , intrinsic soi comes from next - neighbor interactions and is therefore small ( @xmath2 mk= @xmath3 mev ) .",
    "@xcite however , nearest - neighbor terms are nonzero when external ( rashba ) electric fields or curvature - induced overlap changes break the symmetry which is responsible for the vanishing of the nearest - neighbor hopping .",
    "therefore , dominant soi in the absence of external fields is naturally present in carbon nanotubes . for nanotubes",
    ", the rashba field gives a small effect since it is averaged over the circumference .",
    "@xcite however , when electrostatic gates are applied to carbon nanotubes , and in the vicinity of a van hove singularity,@xcite the rashba soi is enhanced and could lead to observable effects .",
    "we will assume that the nanotube we are dealing with is of high quality but will investigate the role played by disorder within the potential barrier on the electron transport .",
    "the electron eigenstates are labeled by quantum numbers representing its two degrees of freedom.@xcite these are the wave number @xmath4 along the axis of the nanotube and the angular momentum quantum number @xmath5 around its axis .",
    "the soi shifts and splits the energy levels giving eigenstates which may be interpreted as a superposition of the @xmath6 and @xmath7 spin states . with this background information",
    ", we are motivated to consider a problem involving spin currents@xcite along the surface of a nanotube and the associated transmission and reflection probabilities from a potential barrier .",
    "the potential barrier may be produced by an electrostatic gate voltage , whose electric field has the ability to act as an extra control parameter to exclude electrons from a region of the nanotube , thereby producing a potential barrier .",
    "multiple gates ( three top gates and a back gate ) have been reported to be deposited on the surface of carbon nanotubes to produce quantum dots.@xcite sharma@xcite has reviewed a method for generating spin currents and discusses ways in which to overcome some obstacles .",
    "there have been several recent papers dealing with the penetration of spin - currents through a potential barrier in a 2deg .",
    "@xcite in this regard , we consider an electron with linear wave number @xmath8 and angular momentum quantum number @xmath9 having probability amplitude @xmath10 in the @xmath6 state and probability amplitude @xmath11 in the @xmath7 state .",

    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "we consider the effect of disorder arising from impurities , defects , or by the atoms / molecules composing the nanotube which simply oscillate around their equilibrium positions has on the scattering process .",
    "we first calculate the tunneling and reflection probabilities in the absence of disorder . in principle , these calculations require a knowledge of the electron eigenstates in the presence of soi .",
    "for the ballistic transport , we assume that the electron mean free path is much longer than the diameter of the nanotube so that the electron s motion is only altered by interaction with the potential barrier .",
    "we then outline and employ a phenomenological theory to analyze the effect due to disorder on the tunneling .",
