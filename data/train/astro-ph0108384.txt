    "atmospheric erenkov technique ( act ) is a well established and unique method for the investigation of celestial tev @xmath1 rays .",
    "it is mainly based on the effective detection of erenkov light emitted by the secondary particles produced in the extensive air showers initiated by a primary @xmath1 ray[@xcite ] and reconstructing its direction of arrival in space accurately .",
    "the signal to noise ratio of such an experiment[@xcite ] is given by @xmath2 where a is the physical area of the telescope , t is the time of observations , @xmath3 is the field of view of the telescope , @xmath4 is the background cosmic ray flux and @xmath5 the flux of @xmath6 rays from the source . in order to achieve high s / n one can either increase the numerator or decrease the denominator in equation(1 ) . for a given exposure and resources one can possibly increase s / n by optimising @xmath3 , the telescope aperture , keeping in mind the finite opening angle of the erenkov cone .",
    "it is possible if the direction of arrival of the shower is determined accurately , i.e. the error in the estimation of arrival angle has to be very small or angular resolution has to be high .",
    "the arrival direction of a shower is determined by measuring the relative arrival time of erenkov photon front at each of the spatially sparated telescopes accurately and reconstructing the shower front .",
    "the angular resolution [ @xcite ] is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the zenith angle , d the average distance between the telescopes and @xmath9 t the accuracy in timing measurement .",
    "the two factors which contribute to @xmath9@xmath8 are the average distance , d , between the telescopes and the uncertanity in the measurement of arrival time of photons .",
    "so , if we have a large number of telescopes separated by large distances , which measure the relative arrival time of photons , then the shower front could be reconstructed and the direction of the arrival of the shower could be estimated fairly accurately . here",
    "we describe the method of analysis adopted for the estimation of arrival direction of the incident primary using pachmarhi array of erenkov telescopes ( pact ) , which is currently in operation .",
    "the experimental set - up of pact has been explained in detail elsewhere [ @xcite ] .",
    "briefly , it consists of a 5 x 5 array of atmosphereic erenkov telescopes deployed in the form of a rectangular matrix with a separation of 25 m in the n - s direction and 20 m in the e - w direction .",
    "each telescope consists of 7 parabolic mirrors of 0.9 m diameter with a focal length of 90 cm .",
    "each mirror is viewed by a fast emi 9807b photomultiplier tube behind a 3@xmath10 circular mask .",
    "the movement of the telescopes is remotely controlled by a low cost control system called automatic computerized telescope orientation system ( actos ) [ @xcite ] .",
    "the alignment of the mirrors is checked with a bright star ( typically of @xmath11 @xmath12 2 to 3 ) scan . using this method",
    "it is ensured that the optic axes of all the 7 mirrors(labelled a to g ) in a telescope are parallel to each other within an error of about @xmath13 the system can orient to the putative source with an accuracy of @xmath14 .",
    "the source tracking is monitored with an accuracy of @xmath15 and corrected in real time .",
    "the array has been divided into 4 sectors with six telescopes in each  and the data are acquired in each sector as well as in central master signal processing centre separately .",
    "the pulses from 7 pmts in a telescope are added linearly to form a telescope trigger pulse called ` royal - sum ' pulse . each ` royal - sum ' pulse from all the 6 telescopes in a sector",
    "are suitably discrminated to yield a count rate of @xmath12 30 - 40 khz .",
    "an event trigger is generated by a coincidence of any 4 of the 6 telescope triggers in a sector which gives an event trigger rate of @xmath12 2 - 5 hz .",
    "in each sector the timing and density information of erenkov photons incident on the 6 peripheral mirrors of six telescopes as well as the timing information on six ` royal - sum ' telescope pulses are recorded .",
    "also , in the central control room the relative arrival times of all 24 telescope trigger pulses and sectorwise house - keeping information are recorded .",
    "the accuracy in timing measurement , @xmath9 t , is estimated as follows . to determine the arrival time of photons accurately a fast low noise photomultiplier with high gain and minimum timing jitter",
    "the intrinsic timing jitter of the signals from the pmts limit the resolution of timing measurements(0.8 ns ) .",
    "the event trigger is used as a start pulse to the fast time to digital convertors(tdc ) .",
    "the individual pmt and ` royal - sum ' pulses are delayed using ecl based delay generetors and then fed as tdc stops .",
    "the tdc modules ( lecroy and philips scientific make ) were operated with a full scale setting of 500 ns which means a delay of 0.25 and 0.2 ns per count respectively .",
    "data were collected with all telescopes in the vertical direction . the variance @xmath16 or the width of the distribution of difference in relative arrival times of signals ( @xmath17 ) of respective tdc channels is an indication of the limiting accuracy of timing measurement , provided the signals originate from pmt s located nearby.[@xcite ] to minimise the effects due to fluctuations in the arrival time of erenkov photons , which depends upon the core distance [ @xcite ] only those combinations corresponding to neighbouring pmt s are considered . using this method the limiting accuracy of timing measurement ( @xmath18 )",
    "is estimated to be 1 ns .",
    "the arrival direction of a shower is determined by measuring the relative arrival time of erenkov photon front at each telescopes accurately and reconstructing the shower front .",
    "a spherical shape represents the erenkov photon shower front fairly accurately , as also demonstrated from monte carlo simulations [ @xcite ] .",
    "however , the algorithm and the analysis technique to determine the shower core in our experiment is under development[@xcite ] . in the absence of the knowledge on the shower core",
    ", we assume the front to be a plane and fit the measured relative arrival time of erenkov photons to a plane , normal to which gives the direction of shower axis .",
    "such an assumption introduces a systematic error in the estimation of arrival direction .",
    "the relative arrival time of pulses as measured in the experiment is not the relative arrival time of erenkov photons at the pmt , which is needed for reconstructing the shower front .",
    "a finite but constant delay between pulses from different pmt s ( channels ) arise due to unequal cable lengths , differences in electronic propagation delays and differences in photomultiplier transit time etc .",
    "these are termed as t0 or time - offsets .",
    "thus the measured relative arrival times have to be corrected for this time - offsets to get the relative arrival time of erenkov front at the pmt .",
    "the average relative time delays between two pmts(or telescopes ) , from a large sample of data , is entirely due to difference between the two time - offsets . in our experiment ,",
    "the average separation between pmt s in a telescope is of the order of a metre but the separation between the telescopes in a sector is about 35 m small enough to be ignored .",
    "the difference in rms fluctuations in arrival time of photons is negligible at this distance separation for any core distance.[@xcite ] if @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the time offsets for the pmts i and j , we can write an equation of the form @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the mean delay between a pair of pmt s i and j after correcting for the time difference due to difference in height ( z - coordinates ) of pmt s if any .    for each pair of pmt s",
    "an equation of the form    @xmath23    can be written , where @xmath24s are the statistical weight factors , ( @xmath24=1/@xmath25 ) , where @xmath16 is the uncertainity in determining @xmath22 . using @xmath26 minimisation one",
    "gets an estimate of these time - offsets .      using the plane front approximation the arrival direction of the shower is estimated as follows [ @xcite][@xcite ] .",
    "if @xmath27,@xmath28,@xmath29 are the coordinates of the @xmath30 pmt , @xmath31 the direction cosines of the shower axis and @xmath32 the arrival time of the photons at this pmt then the equation relating them is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the time at which the shower front passes through the origin of the coordinate system .",
    "then the arrival direction of the shower can be estimated by a @xmath26 minimisation where @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the statistical weight factor given to the @xmath30 timing mesurement .",
    "the values of @xmath31 and @xmath34 are calculated using the equations @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "fig.1 shows the zenith and azimuthal angle distributions of the reconstructed arrival directions using the procedure explained above .",
    "the reconstruction of shower front was done using 24 telescopes for the data collected with telescopes in the vertical position .",
    "the angular resolution of pact has been estimated by using the _ divided array _ method . in the data recorded in the central control room one has information on 24 telescopes .",
    "the array is divided into two independent parts of 12 telescopes each , say sectors 1 and 2 and sectors 3 and 4 . the arrival direction is estimated for each shower from these two independent arrays . the distribution of space angle between these two estimates is a measure of the accuracy with which one can estimate the arrival direction ( figs 2 ) .",
    "since one has two independent estimates of the direction the angular resolution will be given by the peak of the distribution of space angle between the two directions as @xmath41 .",
    "similar analysis was performed by dividing the array using various combinations of telescopes to study the dependence of angular resolution as a function of max .",
    "separation between telescopes and number of telescopes used in the fit .",
    "the results are summarised in table # 1 .",
    "the term ` odd - even ' refers to 3 telescopes each from sector 3 and 4 grouped into one set and the remaining 6 grouped into another .",
    ".angular resolution of pact using royal sums from control room data [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     table # 2 shows that in both the sectors as the number of detectors used in the fit go up the angular resolution does improve . on an average 13 to 14 mirrors in a sector",
    "have valid tdc information available for fitting the angle and hence increase in n , the number of detectors is @xmath12 2.2 . from the angular resolution computed as one goes from 6 to 12 mirrors",
    "it is seen that the improvement in angular resolution goes as @xmath12 @xmath42 . a conservative estimate for the angular resolution(@xmath43 ) of the array",
    "is obtained from table 2 which is @xmath43 = @xmath44/@xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47 or @xmath48 .",
    "we have made a detailed analysis on the angular resolution of pact using data collected with telescopes in vertical position .",
    "the improvement in angular resolution with longer baseline between detectors and with increase in the number of degrees of freedom has been established .",
    "the angular resolution of pact has been estimated to be @xmath49 using royal sum tdc information .",
    "the angular resolution from a sector has been estimated to be @xmath50 using individual pmt information .",
    "so a conservative estimate of the array is @xmath48 .",
    "this is the best angular resolution achieved so far in the world among all the contemporary atmospheric erenkov telescopes .",
    "while the angular resolution of the imaging telescopes are limited by the pmt sizes , only the future imaging telescope arrays ( like veritas [ @xcite ] or hess ) claim a better angular resolution .",
    "pact is able to achieve this because of the multiple sampling technique in a distributed array of acts .",
