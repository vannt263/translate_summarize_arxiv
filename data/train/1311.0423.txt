    "scanners do not satisfy the cs conditions , like the nullspace property and the _ restricted isometry property ( rip ) _ , that guarantee accurate recovery of sparse ( or compressible ) signals . in fact , these recovery conditions predict a quite poor worst - case performance of tomographic measurements , due to the high nullspace sparsity of a tomographic projection matrix @xmath25 .",

    "we give a theoretical relation between the image _ cosparsity _ and sufficient sampling , validate it empirically and conclude that tv - reconstructions of a class of synthetic phantoms exhibit a well - defined recovery curve similar to the study in @xcite .",
    "empirical evidence for the recovery of piecewise constant functions from few tomographic measurements was already observed in @xcite .",
    "the first theoretical guarantees that have been obtained for recovery from noiseless samples of images with exactly sparse gradients via total variation minimization , date back to the beginnings of cs @xcite .",
    "however , the measurements considered were incomplete fourier samples , and images were not sampled along lines in the spatial domain , but along few radial lines in the frequency domain .",
