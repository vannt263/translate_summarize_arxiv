    "the measurement of the inclusive decay @xmath15 , first reported by the cleo collaboration in 1995 @xcite , has received a resounding reception in the interested theoretical physics community , both as a precision test of the standard model in the flavour sector and as a harbinger of new physics , in particular supersymmetry @xcite . in the meanwhile ,",
    "the branching ratio for this decay has become quite precise through the subsequent measurements by the cleo @xcite , aleph @xcite and belle @xcite collaborations , with the babar measurements keenly awaited .",
    "the present experimental average of the branching ratio @xmath16 is in good agreement with the next - to - leading order prediction of the same in the standard model ( sm ) , estimated as @xmath17 @xcite for the pole quark mass ratio @xmath18 , rising to @xmath19 @xcite , if one uses the input value @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the charm quark mass in the @xmath22-scheme , evaluated at a scale @xmath23 in the range @xmath24 .",
    "the inherent uncertainty reflects in part the present accuracy of the theoretical branching ratio , which is limited to @xmath25 , and in part the imprecise measurements of the photon energy spectrum in @xmath15 decays . despite the current theoretical dispersion on the branching ratio ,",
    "the agreement between experiment and the sm is quite impressive and this has been used to put non - trivial constraints on the parameters of models incorporating beyond - the - sm physics , in particular supersymmetry ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent analysis in a supersymmetric scenario ) . while the measurement of the decay @xmath15 is being consolidated , several",
    "other radiative and semileptonic rare @xmath12-decays are being searched for . in particular ,",
    "first measurements of semileptonic rare @xmath12-decays have been recently reported in the @xmath26 and @xmath27 modes by the belle collaboration @xcite , and upper limits have been put in a number of other related decay modes @xcite .",
    "the current measurements of the exclusive modes are in agreement with the expectations in the sm @xcite , calculated in next - to - leading logarithmic ( nlo ) approximation , taking into account the experimental and theoretical errors .",
    "this , for example , can be judged from the comparison of the combined branching ratio for the decay modes @xmath28 , @xmath29 , reported by the belle collaboration @xmath30 with the light - cone qcd sum rule based estimates of the same , @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "the upper limits on the inclusive decays @xmath32 and the exclusive decays @xmath33 are now approaching their respective sm - based estimates , as we also show quantitatively in this paper .    with increased statistical power of experiments at the @xmath12 factories in the next several years",
    ", the decays discussed above and related rare @xmath12 decays will be measured very precisely . on the theoretical side , partial results in next - to - next - to - leading logarithmic ( nnlo ) accuracy",
    "are now available in the inclusive decays @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "recalling that the lowest order contribution for these decays starts at @xmath34 , as opposed to the decay @xmath35 , which starts at @xmath36 , the nnlo accuracy in @xmath37 amounts to calculating explicit @xmath38 improvements .",
    "the same accuracy in @xmath39 amounts to calculating the decay @xmath35 in nlo .",
    "we also recall that power corrections in @xmath40 @xcite and in @xmath41 @xcite are also known .",
    "what concerns the exclusive decays , some theoretical progress in calculating their decay rates to nlo accuracy in the @xmath42 @xcite , and to nnlo accuracy in @xmath43 @xcite decays , including the leading @xmath44 , has been reported .",
    "comparisons of these theoretical estimates with data on @xmath45 decays @xcite have led to important inferences on the magnetic moment form factor .",
    "our purpose in this paper is to incorporate these theoretical improvements , carried out in the context of the sm , and phenomenological implications from the observed radiative decays , and examine the quantitative _ rapport _ between the sm and current measurements of the semileptonic rare @xmath12-decays .",
    "an equally important undertaking of our analysis is to investigate the impact of the current experimental measurements on the parameters of the possible supersymmetric extensions of the sm .",
    "the question which we address in this context is the following : do the current measurements in semileptonic rare @xmath12-decays already provide more restrictive constraints on the parameters of the supersymmetric models than are provided by the @xmath15 measurements ? we find that the decays @xmath46 do provide additional constraints in some parts of the supersymmetric space , though with the current experimental knowledge the decay @xmath15 remains more restrictive over most of the supersymmetric space .",
    "this is expected to change with improved precision on the semileptonic rare @xmath12-decays , which we illustrate in a number of supersymmetric scenarios .",
    "our analysis is carried out in the effective hamiltonian approach , obtained by integrating out the heavy degrees of freedom , defined below ( see eq .",
    "( [ heff ] ) ) . however , we make the tacit assumption that the dominant effects of an underlying supersymmetric theory can be implemented by using the sm operator basis for the effective hamiltonian .",
    "thus , supersymmetric effects enter in our analysis through the modifications of the wilson coefficients which in the sm are calculated at some high scale , denoted generically by @xmath47 , with the sm anomalous dimension matrix controlling the renormalization of these coefficients to a lower scale , typically @xmath48 . restricting the operator basis to the one in the sm",
    "obviously does not cover the most general supersymmetric case , but we think that it covers an important part of the underlying parameter space , and hence can be employed to undertake searches for supersymmetric effects in rare @xmath12-decays . within this operator basis , we have split our analysis in two parts . in the first part we update the branching ratios for the decays @xmath49 , @xmath50 , in the standard model . in doing this",
    ", we work out the parametric uncertainties due to the scale  dependence , top quark mass , @xmath51 , and the ratio of the quark masses @xmath52 . combining the individual errors",
    "@xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 in quadrature , we find that the resulting theoretical uncertainties are @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the corresponding theoretical uncertainties on the exclusive decay branching ratios are larger , due to the form factors , and estimated at typically @xmath58 .",
    "using this updated theoretical framework , we extract model - independent constraints that current data ( summarized below in eqs .",
    "( [ bsgexp])([bseeexp ] ) ) provides on the wilson coefficients @xmath59  @xmath11 , which appear in the effective hamiltonian .",
    "we first work out the constraints on @xmath8 and @xmath9 implied by the @xmath5 measurement .",
    "to that end , we define the quantities @xmath60 , and work out bounds on them .",
    "data on @xmath35 allows both @xmath61 and @xmath62 solutions , which we show in terms of the allowed regions in the @xmath63,@xmath64 and @xmath65,@xmath66 planes .",
    "we then transcribe the impact of the @xmath67 experimental data on the allowed regions in the @xmath68 $ ] plane . depending on the two branches for the quantities @xmath69 , we display the constraints in terms of @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "we show that the sm solution ( corresponding to the point @xmath72 in this plane for the case @xmath73 ) is allowed by present data .",
    "more importantly , from the point of view of supersymmetry , our analysis shows the allowed region in the @xmath68 $ ] plane , which leaves considerable room for beyond - the - sm contributions to these quantities .",
    "in fact , in some allowed regions , phenomenological profiles of semileptonic rare @xmath12-decays can measurably differ from the corresponding ones in the sm .",
    "the second part of our supersymmetric analysis deals with specific susy models and we quantify the additional constraints that the generic @xmath74 data implies for the parameters of these models . we show that no useful bounds beyond what are already known from the @xmath75 analysis are at present obtained in the so  called minimal flavour violating models ( including the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model mssm ) @xcite .",
    "this reflects the generically small deviations to the sm rates and distributions anticipated in these models , as the allowed supersymmetric parameters are already highly constrained . working in the mass insertion approximation @xcite",
    ", we show that insertions in the down ",
    "squark sector ( that enter principally through the gluino penguin and box diagrams ) are not constrained either from present data . on the other hand , insertions in the up ",
    "squark sector get in some parts of the susy parameter space genuinely new constraints . to show possible supersymmetric effects that precise measurements in semileptonic rare @xmath12-decays may reveal , we work out the forward - backward asymmetry in @xmath32 for four illustrative points in the @xmath76 plane , representing solutions in the four allowed quadrants in this space .",
    "however , a high density scan over all the parameter space shows that the allowed solutions in the models considered by us are scattered mostly around the @xmath77 region , for the two branches for the quantities @xmath69 , i.e. for @xmath61 and @xmath62 . we present the resulting constraints on the supersymmetric masses @xmath78 ( mass of the lighter of the two stop mass eigenstate ) , @xmath79 ( the charged higgs boson masses ) and @xmath80 ( ratio of the two higgs vacuum expectation values ) , in the context of the mfv - mssm framework , and on the mass insertion parameter @xmath81 in the mia framework .",

    "scanning over the following parameter space [ mfvps ] we find that the allowed @xmath10 and @xmath11 ranges are : a_7^tot<0 .",

    "let us show in more detail the impact of @xmath184 on mfv models .",
    "the scatter plot presented in fig .",
    "[ bsg ] is obtained varying the mfv susy parameters according to the above ranges and shows the strong correlation between the values of the wilson coefficients @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "in fact , the susy contributions to the magnetic and chromo  magnetic coefficients differ only because of colour factors and loop - functions . in figs .  [",
    "fig : r7h ] and [ fig : r7ch ] we present the dependence of the charged higgs and chargino contributions to @xmath8 on the relevant mass parameters ( that are the charged higgs mass for the former and the lightest chargino and stop masses for the latter ) .",
    "note that we plot the susy wilson coefficients at the scale @xmath185 normalized to the sm values . in the chargino case we are able to exploit the @xmath179 and @xmath177 dependence since ( for non negligible values of the stop mixing angle ) the chargino contribution is essentially proportional to @xmath186 .",
    "indeed , the various curves are very stable with respect to variations of @xmath187 and @xmath179 according to the ranges specified in eq .",
    "( [ mfvps ] ) ; in order not to complicate unnecessarily the figure we show the actual spread for the @xmath188 case only ( note that according to the above discussion we require @xmath189 ) .",
    "in order to show the full strength of these figures let us entertain a scenario in which @xmath8 has the same sign as in the sm . in this situation",
    "large contributions to @xmath8 are completely ruled out .",
    "this means that , looking at figs .  [ fig : r7h ] and [ fig : r7ch ] , it is possible to obtain lower bounds on some susy particles .",
    "note that has very strong consequences .",
    "assuming for instance @xmath190 we see that the ratio @xmath191 is of order 0.2 .",
    "if we then allow for larger values of the stop mixing angle and of @xmath177 , the contribution can easily violate the @xmath192 constraint by more than one order of magnitude ( e.g. for @xmath193 and @xmath194 we obtain something of order 6 that is orders of magnitude above the current limit ) .",
    "gluino contributions to @xmath10 and @xmath11 are governed by mass insertions in the down squark mass matrix . from the analysis presented in",
    "we see that the dominant diagrams involve the parameter @xmath195 and that large deviations from the sm are unlikely .",
    "the impact of @xmath196 is negligible for the following two reasons .",
    "first of all , contributions to either @xmath10 or @xmath11 are obtained by @xmath197 transitions and lr insertions can therefore enter only at the second order in the mass insertion expansion .",
    "more importantly , the insertion @xmath196 gives a contribution to the coefficient @xmath8 that is two orders of magnitude bigger than the sm one .",
    "the bottom line of this discussion is that @xmath196 contributions to the semileptonic wilson coefficients are extremely suppressed .",
    "moreover , there are no gluino box diagrams and the @xmath198penguins are enhanced with respect to the @xmath199ones so that only contributions to @xmath10 are non vanishing .",
    "their explicit expression is ( see for the analytical equations ) : c_9^g , mi=-0.93 ( 250 m_q)^2 f_8^mi ( x_gq ) 1/3 ( ^d_23)_ll , where @xmath200 , the @xmath201 loop - function is always smaller than @xmath202 and can be found in appendix  [ loopfunctions ] .",
    "the situation is thus similar to the mfv case and the same conclusions hold .",
    "a basically different scenario arises if chargino ",
    "mediated penguin and box diagrams are considered . as can be inferred by table  4 in , the presence of a light @xmath203 generally gives rise to large contributions to @xmath10 and especially to @xmath11 . in the following ,",
    "we will concentrate on the so  called extended mfv ( emfv ) models that the two of us described in and that we will briefly summarize below . in these models",
    "we can fully exploit the impact of chargino penguins with a light @xmath204 still working with a limited number of free parameters .",
    "emfv models are based on the heavy squarks and gluino assumption . in this framework ,",
    "the charged higgs and the lightest chargino and stop masses are required to be heavier than @xmath205 in order to satisfy the lower bounds from direct searches .",
    "the rest of the susy spectrum is assumed to be almost degenerate and heavier than @xmath206 .",
    "the lightest stop is almost right  handed and the stop mixing angle ( which parameterizes the amount of the left - handed stop @xmath207 present in the lighter mass eigenstate ) turns out to be of order @xmath208 ; for definiteness we will take @xmath209 .",
    "the assumption of a heavy ( @xmath210 tev ) gluino totally suppresses any possible gluino  mediated susy contribution to low energy observables .",
    "note that even in the presence of a light gluino ( i.e. @xmath211 ) these penguin diagrams remain suppressed due to the heavy down squarks present in the loop . in the mia approach ,",
    "a diagram can contribute sizably only if the inserted mass insertions involve the light stop .",
    "all the other diagrams require necessarily a loop with at least two heavy ( @xmath212 ) squarks and are therefore automatically suppressed .",
    "this leaves us with only two unsuppressed flavour changing sources other than the ckm matrix , namely the mixings @xmath213 ( denoted by @xmath214 ) and @xmath215 ( denoted by @xmath216 ) .",
    "we note that @xmath214 and @xmath216 are mass insertions extracted from the up  squarks mass matrix after the diagonalization of the stop system and are therefore linear combinations of @xmath217 , @xmath218 and of @xmath219 , @xmath220 , respectively .",

    "u(c)_l t_2 .",
    "the phenomenological impact of @xmath221 has been studied in and its impact on the @xmath182 and @xmath74 transitions is indeed negligible .",
    "therefore , we are left with the mia parameter @xmath222 only .",
    "thus , the susy parameter space that we have to deal with is : @xmath23 , @xmath176 , @xmath80 , @xmath178 , @xmath223 , @xmath79 , @xmath224 and @xmath222 .",

    "note that these susy models can account only for a small part of the region allowed by the model independent analysis of current data .",

    "this has allowed us to carry out a theoretical analysis of the radiative decays @xmath35 and the mentioned semileptonic decays to the same order in @xmath39 .",
    "in addition , we have included the leading power corrections in @xmath228 and @xmath229 in the inclusive decays .",
    "the dilepton invariant mass spectrum is calculated in the nnlo precision in the low dilepton invariant mass region , @xmath230 .",
    "the spectrum for @xmath231 calculated to the same theoretical accuracy is not yet available .",
    "we estimate the spectrum in this range from the known partial nnlo , by noting that the dilepton mass spectrum in the full nnlo is close to the partial nnlo spectrum in the range @xmath232 for the choice of the scale @xmath233 gev . following this observation",
    ", we use the partial nnlo spectrum with this scale to estimate the central value of the full nnlo spectrum for @xmath231 .",
    "the branching ratios in the nnlo accuracy in the sm are calculated to have the values @xmath234 and @xmath235 .",
    "they are lower by typically 12% and 20% , respectively , compared to their nlo estimates for the central values of the input parameters , and are approximately a factor 2 to 4 away from their respective experimental upper limits .",
    "hence , current b factory experiments will soon probe these decays at the level of the sm sensitivity . in view of the fact that the dilepton mass spectrum is calculated to the nnlo accuracy only for @xmath230 , and the long - distance effects",
    "are not expected to be dominant , we stress the need to measure the inclusive decays @xmath32 in this dilepton mass range .",
    "in fact , as shown in this paper , such a measurement is theoretically as robust as the inclusive radiative decay @xmath35 .    in the second part of this paper",
    ", we have used our improved theoretical calculations to extract from the current data , listed in eqs .",
    "( [ bsgexp ] )  ( [ bseeexp ] ) , the allowed ranges of the effective wilson coefficients @xmath236  @xmath237 . in doing this , we have first determined the ranges on the wilson coefficients @xmath238 and @xmath239 from @xmath35 decay , and then determined the allowed ranges of the coefficients @xmath240 and @xmath241 ( at 90% c.l . ) .",
    "since the decays @xmath28 are now measured by the belle collaboration , they carve out an inner region in the ( @xmath240,@xmath241 ) plane , allowed previously . under the assumption that the sm - operator basis of the effective hamiltonian is sufficient to incorporate also the beyond - the - sm physics effects , the analysis presented in this paper is model independent .",
    "we find that all current data are consistent with the sm .",
    "however , present experimental measurements allow considerable room for beyond - the - sm effects , which we have worked out in specific supersymmetric contexts . for this purpose",
    ", we have used the mfv model , and an extended - mfv model introduced in ref .",
    "the resulting constraints on the supersymmetric parameters are worked out , in particular on the charged higgs mass , @xmath79 , the lighter of the two stop masses , @xmath242 , the ratio of the two higgs vacuum expectation values , @xmath80 , and the mia parameter @xmath81 . with more data , expected from the leptonic and hadronic @xmath12 factories , these constraints will become either much more stringent , pushing the supersymmetric frontier further , or else , more optimistically , new data may lead to impeccable evidence for new physics effects .",
    "we have illustrated this using the forward - backward asymmetry in @xmath32 decays .",
