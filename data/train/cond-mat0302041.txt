    "the notion of energy ( fitness ) landscapes has played a crucial role in the development of many areas of physics and biology such as disordered systems , neural networks , combinatorial optimization problems @xcite , rna folding @xcite , and evolutionary change @xcite , to mention only a few . in particular ,",
    "considerable effort has been devoted to the study of the interplay between the geometry of the landscape and the nature of the relaxation dynamics , searching heuristic or evolutionary process unfolding on the landscape .",
    "however , the inherent high - dimensionality of these landscapes poses a serious hindrance to the characterization of their topology .",
    "in fact , most of the studies have focused on the statistical characterization of a few local properties of the landscape by looking at , e.g. , the auto - correlation function of unbiased walks over the configuration space @xcite or the energy distribution of local minima @xcite , while a satisfactory description of a landscape should address also the ( relative ) energy differences of the local minima , the height of the barriers between these minima , as well as the distribution of saddle - points @xcite .",
    "the idea of condensing all the landscape information into a tree structure , termed _",
    "barrier tree _ , was introduced in the context of rna and protein folding @xcite , and spin - glass models @xcite . the advantage of barrier trees , whose leaves represent the local minima and the internal nodes the lowest - energy saddles connecting those minima , is that they are both visually appealing ( much information can be obtained from just looking at them , see figure [ fig : btree ] ) , as well as mathematically well - defined , lending themselves to rigorous analysis @xcite .",
    "however , a general quantitative measure to characterize unambiguously different kinds of barrier trees ( and hence energy landscapes ) remains to be obtained .",
    "for instance , the size - frequency distribution of low energy saddles @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the fraction of minima that can be connected through saddle @xmath3 , does not provide a good measure because @xmath4 regardless of whether the barrier tree results from a spin - glass landscape or whether it is generated randomly @xcite .",
    "the situation seems to be similar in the analysis of phylogenetic trees , where it is also believed that the shape of the tree contains valuable clues about the evolutionary process @xcite , but so far no _",
    "single _ satisfactory measure of tree - shape has been constructed @xcite . in this contribution",
    "we apply five measures of tree shape that were originally used to study phylogenetic trees ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) to barrier trees resulting from the ising @xmath0-spin model .",
    "these measures provide statistical information about the shape of the barrier tree , mainly its symmetry or balance , but ignore the lengths of the branches , i.e. , the height of the barriers between minima .",
    "while the extreme statistics of these heights provide useful information on the performance of local search algorithms such as simulated annealing @xcite , a measure based solely on the shape of the barrier tree seems more adequate to classification purposes since the shape is probably insensitive to variations in minor details of the underlying energy landscape .",
    "tree shapes are important in the biological context also because many methods of phylogeny estimation , including parsimony , do not produce branch lengths .",
    "we find that all five measures can be used to tell random from spin - glass trees , but only one measure can distinguish between different spin - glass trees .",
    "a few cautionary remarks regarding the relevance of the concept of energy landscape to the understanding of the thermodynamic properties of spin glasses are in order .",
    "the characterization of an energy landscape is usually based on a few key elements  local minima , energy barriers and saddles  which , in turn , are rigorously defined in terms of the spin configuration space , the energy assignment to each spin configuration , and the neighborhood relation in the configuration space ( see , e.g. , sec .",
    "[ sec : energylandscapes ] ) . however , there seems to be no simple relation between those elements and the thermodynamic phases ( equilibrium states ) of the spin - glass model , since these phases are clearly independent of the neighborhood relation between spin configurations or the relaxation dynamics . to illustrate this point , we note that though the landscape of the ising spin glass with short - ranged interactions in three dimensions is as complex as its counterpart of infinite - range interactions @xcite , its thermodynamics can be successfully studied under the assumption of a trivial ergodicity breaking at low temperature , in which there is a single thermodynamic phase .",
    "( we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for a lucid discussion of these controversial issues . )",
    "nonetheless , the study of the organization of the metastable states ( local minima ) of spin glass models has a long tradition in the physics literature of disordered systems , beginning with the work of bray and moore more than two decades ago @xcite .",
    "it is from this perspective that the statistical studies of energy landscapes in general , and the present work in particular , should be considered .    in the next section , a brief overview of the ising @xmath0-spin model and energy landscapes",
    "section [ sec : barriertrees ] then reviews the notion of barrier trees . in section [ sec : phylogenetictrees ] , phylogenetic trees and several tree shape statistics used to study them are discussed . in particular , we point out that the subtree that connects two leaves in a barrier tree corresponds to the evolutionary path of minimum fitness cost , in contrast with the traditional phylogenetic trees for which the subtrees are determined by the similarity between the leaves , regardless of the barrier height between them .",
    "the results of applying these measures to barrier trees of @xmath0-spin energy landscapes are presented in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "the main conclusions are then summarized in the final section of the paper .",
    "consider a system of @xmath5 ising spins @xmath6 where @xmath7 , with the following energy function @xmath8 here , @xmath9 and the @xmath10 are i.i.d .",
    "random variables from a gaussian distribution with mean 0 and variance @xmath11 .",
    "thus , each of the @xmath12 possible spin configurations is assigned an energy value that is completely specified by the ( magnetic ) interactions within all possible subsets of @xmath0 spins .",
    "this spin glass is known as the @xmath0-spin model @xcite . in the regime of large @xmath0 and @xmath5 with @xmath13",
    "the energies of any two distinct spin configurations become independent random variables , distributed by a gaussian of mean @xmath14 and variance @xmath5 , so that the random energy model ( rem ) is recovered in this limit @xcite . here",
    "the scaling of the variance with @xmath5 guarantees the extensivity of the free - energy .",
    "another important limiting case is @xmath15 , which corresponds to the sherrington - kirkpatrick ( sk ) model @xcite .",
    "we call two spin configurations @xmath3 and @xmath16 _ neighbors _ if they differ in only one of the @xmath5 spins , i.e. , when @xmath17 . in other words ,",
    "neighboring configurations can be turned into each other by a single spin flip .",
    "when @xmath0 is small , neighboring spin configurations will have highly correlated energy values , since the one spin @xmath18 that is different between the two configurations only influences a small number of the possible subsets of @xmath0 spins .",
    "when @xmath0 increases , the energy values of neighboring spin configurations will become less correlated , becoming completely uncorrelated in the limit @xmath19 .",
    "the energy landscape of a @xmath0-spin model consists of the configuration space @xmath20 of the @xmath12 possible spin configurations , with the single spin flip neighborhood relation imposed on it , and where the energy value @xmath21 of each spin configuration @xmath3 is considered to be its `` height '' .",
    "this gives rise to the intuitive image of a more or less mountainous landscape with peaks , valleys , and saddle points .",
    "a `` walk '' on this landscape consists of moving from one neighboring spin configuration to another , climbing up a peak or going down a valley , or perhaps just moving around randomly .",
    "a local search algorithm such as simulated annealing can be seen as performing such a walk , in search of the lowest valley .",
    "in addition , @xmath0-spin landscapes have been used to model evolutionary processes ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) since they form a class of tunably rugged landscapes similar to kauffman s nk - model @xcite . in this context",
    ", evolution is described as an `` adaptive '' walk on the energy landscape .     and @xmath15 . the local minima",
    "are labeled 1 to 10 , and the height of the barriers is shown along some of the branches .",
    "the actual energy values can be read from the scale on the left.,width=384,height=288 ]",
    "a _ local minimum _ in a @xmath0-spin energy landscape is simply a spin configuration @xmath3 that has a lower energy than all of its neighbors .",
    "a _ path _ @xmath22 between two configurations @xmath3 and @xmath16 is a sequence of neighboring configurations , starting at @xmath3 and ending at @xmath16 . in other words , it represents a series of single spin flips that transforms configuration @xmath3 into @xmath16 . note that there exist multiple paths between any pair of configurations @xmath3 and @xmath16 .",
    "a _ saddle point _ between two local minima @xmath3 and @xmath16 is then defined as the minimum from the set of maximum energy values along each possible path @xmath22 between @xmath3 and @xmath16 ; see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "so , the energy value @xmath23 $ ] of this saddle point is @xmath24 = \\min_{\\vec{p}_{st } } \\left\\ { \\max_{z \\in \\vec{p}_{st } } \\left\\ {     h_p(z ) \\right \\ } \\right\\ } .\\ ] ] the _ barrier _ @xmath25 of a local minimum @xmath3 is defined as the height of the lowest saddle point that connects @xmath3 with a local minimum @xmath16 of lower energy , @xmath26 - h_p(s ) | h_p(t ) <",
    "h_p(s ) \\right \\ } .\\ ] ] the information about the energy values of a landscape s local minima and the barriers that connect these local minima can be represented by a _",
    "barrier tree_. in such a tree , the leaves of the tree represent the local minima , and the internal nodes represent the saddles , with the barrier sizes given by the length of the branches connecting the local minima to their corresponding saddles .",
    "figure [ fig : btree ] shows an example of a barrier tree for an @xmath27 and @xmath15 @xmath0-spin landscape .",
    "there are 10 local minima in this landscape ( labeled 1 to 10 in the tree ) , with 9 saddle points ( the internal nodes ) .",
    "the length of each branch in the tree indicates the height of the corresponding barrier ( this value is shown along the branch ) .    the algorithm for constructing these barrier trees",
    "is presented in @xcite .",
    "it is implemented in the ` barriers ` program , which constructs the tree from a sorted list of energy values of all spin configurations in the landscape .",
    "the program ` barriers ` is used here to generate barrier trees of @xmath0-spin landscapes , see also @xcite for applications to spin glass problems .",
    "phylogenetic trees are often used to study the historical relations within or between groups of biological species ; see e.g.@xcite . the currently existing species ( or subspecies )",
    "form the leaves of the tree , and two related species are linked through their last common ancestor , which forms an internal node in the tree .",
    "the length of the branch between a species and its ancestor indicates how long ago the speciation event occurred that led to the current species .",
    "`` dead - ends '' in this tree represent extinction events .",
    "so , the shape of a phylogenetic tree contains information about patterns of speciation and extinction ( and possibly about the rates of these occurrences ) , and thus tells us something about the evolution of different species .        the traditional approaches to reconstruct or infer a phylogenetic tree given the extant species ( i.e. , the leaves ) are based on sequence similarity , i.e. , configurational overlap only , which can be justified by the ( usually implicit ) assumptions of a flat fitness landscape and a diffusive behavior in sequence space @xcite .",
    "however , it seems intuitive that , regardless of the similarity between two sequences , if the fitness costs of all possible evolutionary paths connecting them are high , they must be put far apart in the phylogenetic tree . in the barrier tree approach both similarity and fitness cost are taken into account to yield the evolutionary path of _ minimum fitness cost _ connecting two species .",
    "thus it may be viewed as a generalization of the maximum parsimony principle to rugged fitness landscapes .",
    "we recall that maximum parsimony chooses the tree ( or trees ) that require the fewest evolutionary changes ( spin flips , in the present context ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : arbol ] we give an example in which the distance - based tree and barrier tree have different topologies .",
    "various methods have been proposed to analyze phylogenetic trees . here , we consider five statistics that were used in @xcite to measure tree symmetry and balance .",
    "the trees are assumed to be binary trees with @xmath28 leaves ( or species ) and thus @xmath29 internal nodes , with the root being the last common ancestor of all @xmath28 species .",
    "let @xmath30 be the graph - theoretical distance between two nodes of the tree , i.e. , the number of edges along the path that connects them .",
    "furthermore , we denote the root of the tree by @xmath31",
    ". the _ height _ of a leaf @xmath32 is @xmath33 .",
    "equivalently , @xmath34 is the number of internal nodes between leaf @xmath32 and the root @xmath31 ( inclusive ) . for each interior node @xmath35",
    "we have two subtrees with @xmath36 and @xmath18 leaves , respectively .",
    "we assume @xmath37 .",
    "the _ subtree - height _ of an interior node @xmath35 is @xmath38 where the maximum is taken over all leaves @xmath32 in the subtree @xmath39 below @xmath35 , i.e. , the subtree of which @xmath35 is the root .    with this notation",
    "we may define the following five characteristic values for the shape of a binary rooted tree :    1 .",
    "@xmath40 is the _ average height _ of a leaf in the tree . ] .",
    "@xmath41 , is the standard deviation of the leaf height .",
    "3 .   @xmath42 is a measure for the _ imbalance _ of the tree .",
    "up to normalization it is the same as colless s imbalance measure @xcite .",
    "a closely related measure of this type , which we will not use here , essentially amounts to averaging @xmath43 instead , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "@xmath44 is the average inverse subtree height , where the sum is taken over all @xmath45 internal nodes @xmath35 excluding the root @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath46 is an alternatively weighted average leaf - height .    in @xcite the variance @xmath47",
    "was considered , but here we will use the standard deviation . both @xmath48 and @xmath49 have larger values for more asymmetric trees . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that the expected value of @xmath50 for random trees with @xmath28 leaves .",
    "values of @xmath48 larger than this indicate trees more asymmetric than a random tree . for a completely symmetric tree , @xmath51 , while it has a maximum value for a completely asymmetric tree .",
    "the imbalance measure @xmath52 examines the internal nodes of a tree .",
    "it `` weighs '' the subtrees branching out from each internal node by counting and comparing the number of leaves in each subtree .",
    "these weight differences are then averaged and normalized over all internal nodes of the tree . the value of @xmath52 increases from 0 for a completely symmetric tree to 1 for a completely asymmetric tree . the quantity @xmath53 looks at the longest possible path @xmath54 from each internal node @xmath35 to any of the leaves in its subtree",
    "the statistic @xmath55 is based on an index of information content . for highly asymmetric trees @xmath55 will quickly converge to a value of 2 . for a completely symmetric tree",
    ", it will be equal to @xmath56 , where @xmath28 is the number of leaves in the tree .",
    "both @xmath53 and @xmath55 have smaller values for increasingly asymmetric trees .",
    "here , we apply the statistics presented in the previous section to barrier trees that result from @xmath0-spin energy landscapes .",
    "the parameter values used are @xmath27 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 , and @xmath15 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 ( rem ) . for each combination of @xmath5 and @xmath0 , @xmath64 independent landscapes",
    "were generated randomly , and the barrier trees for each of these landscapes were constructed .",
    "the tree statistics reported here are the averages of the 100 trees for each parameter combination .",
    "three of the statistics ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath53 ) are exponential in @xmath5 , the number of spins .",
    "for example , the relation between @xmath48 and @xmath5 is @xmath65 for @xmath15 .",
    "the data for @xmath48 ( symbols ) and the exponential fits ( solid lines ) are shown in a semi - log plot in figure [ fig : ncb]a for the different values of @xmath0 .",
    "the data for @xmath49 and @xmath53 ( not shown ) are similar , but with different slopes .",
    "it turns out that the average number of leaves , @xmath28 , in the barrier trees is also exponential in the number of spins @xmath5 , with the same slope as for @xmath48 .",
    "analytical values for this exponent , defined as @xmath66 , for the @xmath0-spin models are derived e.g.  in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the numerical values from the simulations reported here are compiled in table [ tab : slopes ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     > from these plots it is clear that the structure of subtrees does not reflect the structure of the tree as a whole . instead , there is a rather well - defined dependence on the structure of a subtree and its _ depth _ in the tree , i.e. , the energy value of the internal node that forms its root .",
    "the landscape structure around local minima and saddle points with a relatively high energy value is therefore significantly different from the structure around local minima and saddle points with a low energy . since this structure",
    "is correlated with the energy value of the local minima and saddle points , this information could possibly be used to guide local search algorithms .",
    "one of the main outcomes of the mean - field ( replica ) theory of spin glasses was the prediction that , in the low - temperature phase , the phase space is broken into infinitely many pure states or valleys @xcite .",
    "finding universal , in the sense of model independent , features of the distribution of valleys is one of the main goals of the theory @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the concept of valley in the replica theory is not easily related to the more tangible concepts of local minima and saddles commonly used to characterize complex landscapes .",
    "the reason being that the replica valleys are weighted by their boltzmann factors which , at least for gaussian distributed couplings , results in a single valley ( up to an overall spin flip ) at zero temperature , thus contrasting with the exponentially large number of local minima of the landscape . in that sense , the replica theory is of little use in the characterization of energy landscapes of spin - glass models . to investigate the organization of the local minima one has then to resort either to the annealed estimates of the correlations between local minima in the thermodynamic limit @xcite or to the exact numerical calculation of the barrier trees for relatively small system sizes @xcite .",
    "as pointed out before , the latter seems a more convenient approach for the purpose of classifying families of landscapes or spin - glass models .",
    "furthermore , the barrier tree also contains information about the structure of subspaces in the landscape around local minima and saddle points , since the structure and symmetry of the subtrees are clearly correlated with their depth in the tree ( or the energy level of the node that forms the root of the subtree ) .",
    "this information can probably be used to guide local search algorithms such as simulated annealing in their search for the lowest ( or global ) minimum .    in searching for efficient measures to characterize landscapes",
    ", it was recently shown that the size - frequency distribution of the number of leaves @xmath67 connected by a saddle - point @xmath3 is too robust to be a useful measure , as it yields the same power - law @xmath68 for both @xmath0-spin barrier trees and random trees @xcite . in this contribution , we improve considerably the landscape systematics by considering five measures proposed originally to characterize the shape of phylogenetic trees @xcite .",
    "three of the measures used , namely , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath53 were proved independent of the underlying spin - glass landscape when plotted against the number of leaves @xmath28 , as evidenced by the `` data collapse '' illustrated in figure [ fig : n_]a .",
    "only one of the measures , the imbalance @xmath52 , can be used to differentiate between , e.g. , @xmath15-type and @xmath69-type energy landscapes .",
    "it is remarkable , however , that all five measures yield completely different results for random trees , owing to a different scaling with @xmath28 . in particular , barrier trees generated from energy landscapes of @xmath0-spin models appear to be much more asymmetric than random trees , and the asymmetry increases with increasing @xmath5 ( the number of spins ) or @xmath28 ( the number of leaves ) . it remains a challenge to find ( if it exists ) a disordered spin system whose associated barrier trees exhibit balance and symmetry properties akin to those of the random trees or , perhaps an easier task , that violate the scaling law shown in figure [ fig : n_]a .",
