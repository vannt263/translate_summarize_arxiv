    "in his 1905 paper on special relativity  @xciteeinstein showed that time dilatation ( td ) and the lorentz - fitzgerald contraction ( lfc ) , which had previously been introduced in a somewhat _ ad hoc _ way into classical electrodynamics , are simple consequences of the lorentz transformation ( lt ) , that is , of the geometry of space - time .",
    "as an example of the lfc einstein stated that a sphere moving with velocity @xmath3 would , ` viewed from the stationary system ' , appear to be contracted by the factor @xmath4 in its direction of motion where @xmath5 is the velocity of light in free space .",
    "it was only pointed out some 54 years later that if ` viewed ' was interpreted in the conventional sense of ` as seen by the eye , or recorded on a photograph ' then the sphere does not at all appear to be contracted , but is still seen as a sphere with the same dimensions as a stationary one and at the same position  @xcite !",
    "it was shown in general  @xcite that transversely viewed moving objects subtending a small solid angle at the observer appear to be not distorted in shape or changed in size , but rather rotated , as compared to a similarly viewed and orientated object at rest .",
    "this apparent rotation is a consequence of three distinct physical effects :    * the lfc .",
    "* optical aberration . *",
    "different propagation times of photons emitted by different parts of the moving object .    the effect ( ii ) may be interpreted as the change in direction of photons , emitted by a moving source , due to the lt between the rest frames of the source and the stationary observer . correcting for ( ii ) and ( iii ) , the lfc can be deduced as a physical effect , if not directly observed .",
    "it was also pointed out by weinstein  @xcite that if a single observer is close to a moving object then , because of the effect of light propagation time delays , it will appear elongated if moving towards the observer and contracted ( to an extent greater than the lfc ) if moving away .",
    "only an object moving strictly transversely to the line of sight of a close observer shows the lfc .",
    "however , the lfc itself is a physical phenomenon similar in many ways to ( iii ) above . the human eye or a photograph taken with a fast shutter record , as a sharp image , the photons incident on it during a short resolution time @xmath6 .",
    "that is , the image corresponds to a projection at an almost fixed time in the frame s of observation .",
    "this implies that the photons constituting the observed image are emitted at different times from the different parts,_along the line of sight _ , of an extended object .",
    "as shown below , the lfc is similarly defined by a fixed time projection in the frame s.",
    "the lt then requires that the photons constituting the image of a moving object are also emitted at different times , in the rest frame s of the object , from the different parts _ along its direction of motion_. in the following s will , in general , denote the reference frame of a ` stationary ' observer ( space - time coordinates x , y , z , t ) while s refers to the rest frame of an object moving with uniform velocity @xmath3 in the direction of the positive x axis relative to s ( space - time coordinates x,y,z,t ) .    the purpose of this paper is to point out that the @xmath7 projection of the lfc ( see section 2 below ) and the @xmath8 projection of td ( see section 3 below ) are not the only physically distinct space - time measurements possible within special relativity .",
    "in fact , as will be demonstrated below , there are two others : space dilatation ( sd ) , the @xmath9 projection and time contraction ( tc ) , the @xmath10 projection .",
    "all four ` effects ' are pure consequences of the lt .",
    "the additional effects of optical aberration and light propagation delays on the appearance of moving objects and synchronised clocks have been extensively discussed elsewhere  @xcite .    although each of the four effects may be simply derived from the projective geometry of the space time lt ,",
    "the lfc and td give rise to more easily observable physical effects , so it is not surprising that they are better known , for example the lfc is essential for the physical interpretation of the michelson - morley experiment , and td is necessary to describe the observed lifetimes of unstable particles decaying in flight .",
    "in contrast , the two new effects sd and tc seem to have no similar simple observational consequences .",
    "as pointed out below , the most interesting effects are likely to result from sd , which is necessary to describe observations of , for example , a rotating extended object moving with a relativistic transverse velocity .",
    "it is easy to conceive a simple experiment involving the observation of two synchronised clocks in space , to test the tc effect .",
    "although it is clearly of interest to work out in more detail such examples , there is no attempt to do so in the present paper , which is devoted to the precise definition of the four possible space - time projections of the lt and a discussion of their interrelations .",
    "the @xmath7 projection of the lfc is the space - time measurement appropriate to the ` moving bodies ' of einstein s original paper and to the photographic recording technique .",
    "this medium has no intrinsic time resolution and relies on that provided by a rapidly moving shutter to provide a clear image . the lfc ` works ' as a well defined physical phenomenon because the ` measuring rod ' or other physical object under observation is assumed to be illuminated during the whole time interval required to make an observation , and so constitutes a continuous source of emitted or reflected photons , such that some are always available in the different space ( @xmath11 ) and time ( @xmath12 ) intervals in s for every position of the rod corresponding to the time interval @xmath13 around the fixed time @xmath14 in the observer s frame s during which the observation is made .",
    "if , however , the physical object of interest has internal motion ( rotation , expansion or contraction ) or is only illuminated , in its rest frame s , during a short time interval , the above conditions , that assure that the @xmath7 projection gives a well defined space - time measurement no longer apply .",
    "all such objects , uniformly illuminated for a restricted time @xmath0 ( their ` luminous proper time ' ) in their rest frames , may be called ` transient luminous objects ' . for such objects",
    "it is natural to define a length measurement by taking the @xmath9 projection in s. the observation , from the stationary frame s , of such objects is discussed in section 2 below .    in section 3 time measurements other than the conventional td of special relativity",
    "are considered .",
    "the td phenomenon refers only to a local clock , in the sense that its position in the frame s is invariant ( say at the spatial origin of coordinates @xmath15 ) .",
    "however , the time recorded by any synchronised clock in the same inertial frame is , by definition , identical .",
    "einstein used such an array of ` equivalent clocks ' situated at different positions in the same inertial frame in his original discussion of the relativity of simultanaeity  @xcite .",
    "the question addressed in section 3 is : what will an observer in s see if he looks not only at a given local clock in s , but also at other , synchronised , equivalent clocks at different positions in s , in comparison to a standard clock at rest in his own frame ? it is shown that such equivalent clocks may be seen to run slower than , or faster than , the td prediction for a local clock . in particular they may even appear to _ run faster than the standard clock_. this is an example of the time contraction effect mentioned above .    in section 4 the analogy between the lorentz - fitzgerald contraction effect and linear perspective in two spatial dimensions",
    "is described .",
    "the final section points out how all four space - time ` effects ' ( observed distortions of space - time ) in special relativity may be described in a unified way in terms of projective geometry , in close analogy with the effect of linear perspective in the perception of space .",
    "consider a square planar object centered at the origin of the moving frame s as shown in fig 1a .",
    "the points p(@xmath16 , @xmath17 ) and q(@xmath18 , @xmath17 ) lie on the vertical edges of the square of side @xmath19 whose boundary is shown in fig 1a as the short dashed lines .",
    "suppose now that the square is uniformly illuminated in the time interval @xmath20 to give the ` transient luminous object ' indicted by the zig - zag lines .",
    "the proper time interval @xmath0 is the ` luminous proper time ' of the object .",
    "for example , the surface of the square may be covered with a mosaic of light - emitting diodes that are simultaneously switched on during a time @xmath0 .",
    "the object as seen by an observer , at rest in the stationary system s , viewing the object in a direction perpendicular to the plane @xmath21 , is given by the lt connecting space time points in the frame s to those in s : @xmath22 where @xmath23 it is assumed that the stationary observer is sufficiently distant from the object that the effects of light propagation times are negligible , and that the object is diffusely illuminated so that optical aberration effects may be neglected  @xcite . in this case any changes in the appearance of the moving object when viewed from the frame s are due solely to the lt .",
    "the results of the transformation for @xmath24 and @xmath25 are given in table 1 .",
    "it can be seen that the points p,o,q are observed at different times in the frame s. this is the well known effect of the relativity of simultanaeity first pointed out in einstein s classic paper  @xcite .",
    "it can also be seen from table 1 that the distance between the positions of p and q as observed in s is @xmath26 ; that is , the object will appear to be elongated if it is viewed with a time resolution larger than the difference in time , @xmath27 , between the observations in s of the space time points p and q that are simultaneous in the frame s. this is the ` space dilatation ' ( sd ) effect .",
    "it will now be discussed in more detail , taking into account the non zero luminous proper time @xmath0 of the transient luminous object as well as the resolution time @xmath6 of the observer , so that the general conditions under which the sd effect occurs are established .",
    "space time points of the transient luminous object may be observed at the fixed time @xmath14 in s provided that : @xmath28 where @xmath29 in ( 2.3 ) it is assumed that @xmath30 , @xmath31 . the general condition relating @xmath0,@xmath19 , @xmath3 and @xmath5 ensuring the validity of this assumption will be discussed below . using ( 2.1 ) the co - ordinates in s corresponding to @xmath32 and @xmath33",
    "are found to be : @xmath34 thus the width @xmath35 of the transient luminous object observed at time @xmath14 in s ( indicated by the zig - zag lines in fig1b ; the actual boundary is shown by the short dashed lines ) is : @xmath36 while , as can be seen from ( 2.4 ) and ( 2.5 ) , the observer in s sees a luminous object that moves with velocity @xmath37 , i.e. faster than than the velocity of light . in the case of continous illumination of the object ( @xmath38 )",
    "the upper and lower limits of the object observed at the fixed time @xmath14 in s will correspond to the physical boundaries @xmath39 , @xmath40 . denoting by @xmath41 , @xmath42 the times in s corresponding to the observation of these boundaries at time @xmath14 in s , then , instead of ( 2.3 ) , the following relation is obtained : @xmath43 using ( 2.1 ) , the boundaries of the object observed in s at time @xmath14 are then : @xmath44 the width of the object as seen in s is then @xmath45 , the well known lfc effect . as can be seen from ( 2.8 ) and ( 2.9 ) the object",
    "is now observed to move in s with velocity @xmath3 .",
    "thus , in the limit @xmath38 ( continous illumination of the object ) the usual results of special relativity are recovered .    using ( 2.1 ) and ( 2.2 ) the upper ( u ) and lower ( l ) limits of the space time region in the stationary frame s swept out by the moving transient luminous object in fig 1b are : @xmath46 taking account of the inequality : @xmath47",
    "it can be seen that if @xmath48 the terms containing @xmath0 in ( 2.10)-(2.13 ) may be neglected , so that : @xmath49 thus the space dilatation effect of table 1 is recovered in the limit @xmath50 . on the other hand , because of the inequality : @xmath51 then , if @xmath52 , the terms containing @xmath19 in ( 2.10)-(2.13 ) may be neglected , leading to the relations : @xmath53        i thank g.barbier and c.laignel for their valuable help in the preparation of the figures , and an anonymous referee whose pertinent and constructive criticism has allowed me to much improve the presentation of section 2 .    99 a.einstein,`zur elektrodynamik bewegter krper ' , annalen der physik * 17 * ( 1905 ) , 891 .",
