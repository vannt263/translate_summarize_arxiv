    "one of the surprising results of the hitherto largest wide - field spectroscopic survey for metal - poor stars , the hk survey ( beers _ et al .",

    "a different scenario for the origin of carbon in these stars is that proposed for the moderately metal - poor , classical ch stars ( @xmath10}\\sim -1.5 $ ] ) , in which the carbon - enhanced star is a member of a wide binary system that accreted material from a former primary , during the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase of the latter , as described by mcclure & woodsworth ( 1990 ) .",
    "however , while all ch stars are indeed members of binary systems ( mcclure & woodsworth 1990 ) , and radial velocity variations have been reported ( and periods determined ) for some carbon - enhanced metal - poor ( hereafter cemp ) stars ( norris _ et al .",

    "we discuss our interpretation of these results in  [ disc ] .",
    "a total of 18 spectra of he  0024@xmath12523 have been collected during several runs using three different instrument - telescope combinations : uves at vlt - ut2 kueyen ( dekker _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) , hires at keck i ( vogt _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 ) , and the double spectrograph at the hale 5-m telescope at palomar mountain ( oke & gunn , 1982 ) .",
    "the uves observations were carried out during two different runs , on august 27@xmath20 2001 , and between october 23@xmath21 and 27@xmath20 2001 .",
    "three metal - poor field stars , g4 - 37 , g126 - 62 and g141 - 19 , were observed with the same setup , so that they could be used as templates to measure rotational velocities .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio for the template spectra is @xmath22 per resolution element .",
    "the spectra have a resolution of @xmath23 , where @xmath24 refers to the width of the resolution elements .",
    "a dichroic beam - splitter was employed , which distributed the light gathered with the telescope to the blue and red arms of uves , covering a range from 3600 to 4800 and from 5700 to 9500 , respectively .",
    "the slit width was fixed at 1 arcsec and the binning used 1@xmath252 , where 1 refers to the dispersion direction and 2 to the spatial one .",
    "the spectra were extracted and wavelength calibrated using the standard uves pipeline .",
    "the bias and scattered light were subtracted from the spectra , flat - fielding was applied , and the extracted spectra were wavelength calibrated with arc - lamp spectra taken during the same observing run ; then the orders were blaze corrected and merged .",
    "the keck i hires spectra are described in detail in paper i. they have a wavelength coverage from 3850 to 5400 , and were observed with a slit width of 0.86 arcsec and 1@xmath252 binning on the ccd chip .",
    "the first five spectra were all collected during a single night , september 24@xmath20 2000 .",
    "two more spectra were obtained , one on the 27@xmath20 , and the other on the 30@xmath20 of september 2001 .",
    "all the spectra have a resolution of @xmath26 , and their extraction and wavelength calibration were performed using figaro ( shortridge , 1993 ) .",
    "the reduction was similar to that performed on the uves spectra , but in this case the orders were not merged .",
    "the palomar spectra were obtained during four consecutive nights , from october 24@xmath20 to october 27@xmath20 2001 , with a 1.0 arcsec slit and 0.6 pixels , yielding a spectral resolution of @xmath273,500 over the spectral region 6100 to 6700  , with h@xmath17 the major spectral feature present in that range .",
    "figaro was again used to extract and wavelength calibrate the spectra .",
    "several radial velocity standards ( hd  2796 , hd  38230 , hd  171232 , and cs  22950 - 046 ) were also observed in order to test the reliability of our measurements .",
    "further details on the observations are listed in table [ obs ] .",
    "radial velocities were measured by fitting gaussians to several prominent lines in different orders and adding the appropriate barycentric correction .",
    "the values measured for the radial velocity standards showed a systematic offset in the palomar spectra of @xmath284.8 km  s@xmath3 , which was added to the measured radial velocities as a correction for instrumental effects .",
    "the measured heliocentric radial velocities are given in table [ obs ] .",
    "as mentioned in paper i , the spectra of he  0024@xmath12523 were characterized by broader lines than those of the other program stars , suggesting a non- negligible rotational velocity . in paper",
    "i , we roughly estimated v@xmath29 to be @xmath28 8 km  s@xmath3 .    here",
    "we improve upon this measurement .",
    "the rotational velocity was measured using a cross - correlation technique ; the spectrum of the program star was cross - correlated against a few template spectra of non - rotating stars with similar atmospheric parameters .",
    "the cross - correlation peaks were fit with a gaussian curve ; from the resulting fwhm the value of @xmath30 was calculated according to a relation calibrated on several other stars with well - known rotational velocities .",
    "a more detailed description of the procedure used can be found in lucatello & gratton ( 2002 ) .",
    "the spectrum used for this purpose was that with the highest signal - to - noise ratio , the uves spectrum taken on august 27@xmath20 2001 . only the blue part was used to measure rotation , as it is not affected by telluric lines and",
    "exhibited the strongest signatures in the cross - correlations .",
    "the spectrum was first divided into single orders .",
    "each order was then cross - correlated against the corresponding orders of the three different templates using the iraf task _",
    "rv.fxcor_. from the resulting average fwhms , after subtracting all the _ external _ sources of broadening ( _ e.g. _ template contribution , instrumental broadening , etc . )",
    ", we obtained a value of _ v @xmath31 _",
    "= 9.7@xmath321.5 km  s@xmath3  .",
    "this value is strictly an upper limit , as it includes also non - rotational intrinsic stellar broadening , such as macro - turbulence .",
    "however , as shown in lucatello & gratton ( 2002 ) , this procedure provides a good estimate of the value of the true _ v @xmath31 _ when its value is larger than @xmath33  km  s@xmath3 .      in order to compute the orbital parameters for he  0024@xmath12523 , which for the sake of clarity we will refer to as the _ primary star _",
    "hereafter ( the companion will be called the _ secondary _ ) , we employed the program _",
    "orbitsolver _ by j. s. varga , g. a. radford , d. w. beggs , r. e. m. griffin and j. r. lewis ( r. e. m. griffin , priv . comm . ) .",
    "this program adjusts all the elements of the orbit simultaneously in a least - squares solution ( griffin & cornell , 1998 ) .",
    "the measurements of the radial velocities were fed into the program , along with the corresponding mjd of each of the observations .",
    "the values of the velocities were weighted according to their errors of observation . however , note that we did not use the individual errors , but rather an estimate of the average errors , @xmath34 km  s@xmath3 for hires and uves data , and @xmath35 km  s@xmath3 for the palomar data .",
    "the initial values of the parameters were provided from direct examination of the data .",
    "the initial period was assumed to be four days , since we noticed that the radial velocity was very similar for the two uves observations taken at mjd= 52206.014 and 52210.021 . for the initial semi - amplitude of the orbit we used half the difference between the highest and lowest velocity points , and for the epoch at zero phase we assumed the epoch of the first observation .",
    "a stable and reasonable solution was obtained after five iterations .",
    "initially , we assumed a circular orbit ( _ i.e. _ _ e_=0 ) ; after having refined the other orbital elements , we allowed the eccentricity to vary as well .",
    "our best solutions for circular and non - circular orbits are provided in table [ orbsol ] , along with their values before the last iteration .",
    "the short period suggests that the orbit should have an eccentricity close to zero .",
    "our computation of the orbital elements , solving for _ e _ as well , obtained a very small value for _ e _ , and did not significantly change the other orbital parameters with respect to those obtained when adopting a circular orbit . allowing",
    "the eccentricity to vary did not improve the solution significantly .",
    "in fact , the circular solution yielded smaller r.m.s .",
    "residuals , hence we adopted a circular orbit .",
    "figure [ radvelcur ] shows the radial - velocity data together with the adopted solution , while table [ vr ] lists the observed values for the radial velocities along with their expected value from our orbital solution .",
    "although the values of the individual masses are not known , we can derive useful limits on them through considerations based on the available photometric and spectroscopic information for he  0024@xmath12523 .",
    "we begin by considering the mass of the primary . if we assume a constant spatial density for the extreme halo population , which is reasonable for distances up to a few kpc , and a uniform mass function ( adopted since information on the mass of the observed star is lacking ) , then the probability of observing a star of a given mass at the measured magnitude and color can be expressed by the formula : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the time spent in the _ i_th phase ( with i=1 being the main - sequence phase and i=2 the subgiant phase ) by the star of _",
    "j_-th mass within the restricted evolutionary phase allowed by the atmospheric parameters .",
    "@xmath38_v(m ) _ is the volume sampled by stars of the measured luminosity , which on turn depends on the intrinsic luminosity of the object .",
    "the integral in the denominator normalizes @xmath39 .    in order to compute these quantities we used the y@xmath40 tracks ( yi _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 ) for a mass interval 0.4@xmath41 m / m@xmath425 with 0.1m@xmath43 bins , with a metallicity [ fe / h]@xmath44 , and [ @xmath17/fe]@xmath45 .",
    "we assumed the @xmath322@xmath46 range around the measured temperature of he  0024@xmath12523(__i.e . _",
    "_ 6425 to 6825k ) to specify the evolutionary phase , and computed the time spent in this range .",
    "in this way we obtained two permitted intervals for each mass , one on the main sequence and the other along the subgiant branch .",
    "the number of stars of the corresponding mass observable at the measured magnitude was calculated from the theoretical tracks , assuming a bolometric magnitude for the sun of @xmath47 and a bolometric correction for our star of bc(v)@xmath48 ( lejeune _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) .",
    "the final probabilities were evaluated according to eq .",
    "1 ; figure [ prob ] provides a graphical representation of the results . in this figure",
    "a value of zero for the probability of a given mass indicates that the track for that mass does not cross the allowed region in @xmath49 .",
    "this figure shows that the probability function drops abruptly at 0.9m@xmath43 , but seems to be roughly constant ( at low but non - zero values ) in the interval @xmath502.85 .",
    "this behavior arises because as the time spent in the observed temperature region decreases , the intrinsic luminosity increases , hence the volume of space in which stars of such luminosity are observed at the measured magnitude increases .",
    "application of the ionization equilibrium for fe supplies a further constraint , since it limits the acceptable values of surface gravity .",
    "the lower limit on the range of gravity may be obtained from the difference between the derived abundances of feii and fei .",
    "this difference is ( see table [ abu ] ) [ feii / h]-[fei / h]@xmath51 , where the uncertainty is the quadratic sum of @xmath46 of the measured feii abundance ( that of fei , being 0.02dex , is negligible when added in quadrature ) , and of the error on the fei abundance arising from uncertainties in the temperature ( see table 5 of paper ii and the discussion in  4.2 ) .",
    "thus , the maximum difference between the abundances of the ionized and neutral iron species is , at a 2@xmath46 confidence level , ( [ fe / h]ii-[fe / h]i)@xmath52 .",
    "according to the sensitivity of the abundances to the atmospheric parameters given in table 5 of paper ii , this corresponds to a lower limit for the gravity of @xmath53dex .",
    "taking into account this constraint , the probability for masses larger than 0.95m@xmath43 is reduced to about 0.003 ( since only the low - luminosity phase is acceptable for larger masses ) .",
    "thus , on the basis of these simple statistical considerations , it is reasonable to assume that the mass of the primary lies in the range 0.75 @xmath41m / m@xmath54 .",
    "it is very likely that the _ secondary _ star has undergone thermal pulses during its agb phase , as we observe the expected nucleosynthesis products ( see  [ abuan ] and following ) : the _",
    "s_-process elements that we detect in the _ primary _ star must have been produced in the _ secondary _ , as the _ primary _ seems to be presently on the main sequence . the agb - nucleosynthesis - enriched material was then transfered to the _ primary _ star , polluting its atmosphere .",
    "the minimum amount of material required to create the signatures characteristic of ch stars is quite small , as the polluted star is very metal poor .    the mass of the _ secondary _ , which is now likely a white dwarf , is likely to be consistent with the mass of the degenerate co core of the star in its agb phase .",
    "thus , based on this assumption , it is possible to obtain a reliable lower limit to the mass of this star . the minimum core mass for a star to experience third dredge - up is a ( theoretically ) very well - studied quantity over the metallicity range @xmath55[fe / h]@xmath56 ( herwig _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ; boothroyd & sackman 1988a , b , c , d ; marigo , girardi & bressan 1999 ) .",
    "however , no detailed computation has been performed for metallicities as low as that of he  0024@xmath12523 , hence extrapolation to such low metallicities might be premature .",
    "since we seek an upper limit for the value of @xmath31 , high precision is not crucial ; a reasonable estimate of this quantity can provide a meaningful constraint .",
    "hence we adopt the value of 0.6m@xmath43 from an _ ad - hoc _ computation ( straniero 2002 , priv .",
    "comm . ) .",
    "inversion of the expression for the mass function , @xmath57  ( which is known from the orbital solution ) , and substitution , for @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively , of the upper and lower limits estimated in the previous sections , we obtain : @xmath60{\\frac{(m_{1}+m_{2})^{2}}{m_{2}^{3 } } f(m)}=0.82\\ ] ] which corresponds to an inclination of _ i _ @xmath61 .",
    "it should be kept in mind that this is an upper limit to the angle and _ not _ an estimate of the angle itself .",
    "it is noteworthy that the value of @xmath31 is far more sensitive to the mass of the _ secondary _ than it is to the _ primary_.    on the basis of this upper limit on the orbital inclination angle , we can derive an upper limit to the value of the synchronous rotational velocity .",
    "a star is in a synchronous orbit if its rotational period is the same as its period of revolution .",
    "since the orbital period has been measured , we obtain , using the derived upper limit on @xmath31 for the upper limit of the projected value of the rotational velocity : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the upper limit of the value of the synchronous rotational velocity , r is the radius of the star , and p is the orbital revolution period . using the same y@xmath40 ( yi _ et al . _ , 2001 ) isochrone as that described in paper i , the value for the radius corresponding to the atmospheric parameters adopted was computed to be @xmath64 . substituting this value in eq .",
    "3 , we obtain an upper limit for the synchronous projected rotational velocity of @xmath65 km  s@xmath3 .",
    "the uncertainty is mainly due to the errors in the determination of the radius , since the period and the mass function are determined with a much higher degree of accuracy .",
    "the error of the radius depends on the uncertainties of the effective temperature and gravity .",
    "such uncertainties are , respectively , of about @xmath32100 k in @xmath49 ( which translates into an uncertainty of @xmath66 on the radius ) , and , as discussed in  3.3.1 , of @xmath320.3dex in @xmath67 ( about @xmath68 in the radius ) . the total error on the radius , and consequently on the @xmath69 , is @xmath70 ( 1 @xmath46 ) .",
    "the measured value of @xmath71 km  s@xmath3 , is compatible with the computed upper limit .",
    "since the value of the orbital semi - major axis is only a few times larger than the inferred radius , it is likely that tidal forces led the system to reach a state of synchronicity and a circular orbit , the latter of which has been derived from our observations",
    ". thus the orbit can be considered synchronous and the observed @xmath72 the true synchronous rotational velocity of the _",
    "primary_.    assuming synchronicity , we can derive the value of @xmath31 , hence a relationship between the values of the masses of the two components .",
    "this value is subject to the error computed for the upper limit of the angle ( see eq .",
    "2 ) , plus that due to that of the _ measured _ rotational velocity , which is @xmath73 . in this manner , using eq .",
    "3 and substituting @xmath72 for @xmath74 , we obtain @xmath31=0.59@xmath320.19 , corresponding to an angle of _ i_=(@xmath75)@xmath76 .",
    "the expression of the mass function links the values of the _ primary _ and the _ secondary _ masses , so that once one of them is known , under the hypothesis of a synchronous orbit , the other is uniquely determined .",
    "however , in this case this computation does not add any information , as the mass range of the _ secondary _ corresponding to that computed for the _ primary _ in  3.3.1  calculated from the mass function using for @xmath31 the maximum , minimum and mean value allowed in the case of synchronous orbit  covers the entire interval from 0.6m@xmath43 to ( and beyond ) the chandrasekar limit ( see table [ mass ] ) .",
    "thus , the only limits we are able to derive are @xmath77  and @xmath78 .",
    "paper ii described the results for the chemical composition of he  0024@xmath12523 from the hires spectra taken in september 2000 . in the following sections we present the results obtained from the abundance analysis from lines equivalent widths (  [ abuan ] ) and spectral syntheses (  [ synt ] ) for both the uves and hires spectra .",
    "for both purposes we used the uves spectrum with the highest signal - to - noise ratio ( _ i.e. _ that taken on august 27@xmath20 2001 ) and the sum of the hires spectra obtained in september 2000 .",
    "the addition of the uves spectrum to our data sample improves the signal - to - noise ratio , and permits the detection and measurement of lines that were not within the spectral range covered by the hires spectra .",
    "the procedure used to determine the atmospheric parameters for he  0024@xmath12523 have been thoroughly explained in paper i : @xmath49 is derived from broad - band colors , taking the mean of the de - reddened colors @xmath79 and @xmath80 ; once @xmath49 is specified , @xmath11(@xmath81 ) is obtained from the y@xmath40 isochrones .    with @xmath49  and @xmath11(@xmath81 ) fixed , [ fe / h ] is determined interactively by matching the observed equivalent widths ( ews ) to those computed by integrating the line profiles of the adopted atmospheric model , obtained from the equation of transport computed at different wavelengths along each line .",
    "the model atmosphere we adopt was extracted by interpolation from the kurucz grid of models ( kurucz cd - rom 18 , 1995 ) without overshooting .",
    "this model assumes a scaled solar composition : while this is not strictly appropriate in the case of he  0024@xmath12523 , modifications in the model structure are not very large . a crude estimate of these modifications on the model atmosphere due to the high carbon abundance ( [ c / fe]=+2.6 ) can be obtained with the following method .",
    "we measured the integrated absorption due to all of the spectral lines in the range between 4300 and 4335  , both in the program star and in another star of the keck pilot program ( he  2344@xmath12800 ) , which has almost identical atmospheric parameters .",
    "this interval was chosen as it is one of the spectral ranges most affected by the presence of ch .",
    "the resulting ratio of the summed absorption integrated over this spectral range is @xmath82 . as a very conservative estimate 2 . ]",
    ", we assumed that the ch absorption affects the model in the same way a spectral interval which accounts for _ ten _ times ( @xmath83 of the flux , obtained from the integration of the equation of the flux of a black body at the same temperature as he  0024@xmath12523 ) as much flux as that emitted in the range 4300 and 4335  ( @xmath84 of the flux ) . on this basis , _",
    "i.e. _ that the remaining spectral regions accounting for about 95% of the flux are negligibly affected , we deduced that the difference in the flux of the star with [ c / h]=+2.6 , with respect to that with scaled solar carbon abundance , is @xmath85 . at a metallicity of [ fe / h]=@xmath12.7 ,",
    "this translates into an error of 0.03dex , which is negligible compared to the errors of the abundances due to the uncertainties in the atmospheric parameters themselves .",
    "equivalent widths for the uves spectrum were measured in the same way as described in paper ii for the hires spectra .",
    "since the resolution of the uves spectrum is almost identical to that of the hires one , the signal - to - noise ratio only slightly better , and the procedure used for the measurements and selection of ews are identical , we expect the internal errors to be similar to those evaluated in paper ii .",
    "the same follows for the external errors ( see  3 of paper ii ) . a comparison between the ews obtained from the uves spectrum with those from the hires spectra showed that the ews from the vlt spectra are systematically larger than those measured from the keck spectra , as can be seen in the top panel of figure [ ew ] .",
    "the lower panel shows the uves ews _ vs. _ those obtained from hires ; the upper line is described by the equation @xmath86 , while the lower line is the best - fit relation , described by the equation : @xmath87 the r.m.s .",
    "scatter around the regression line is 6.8 m ; assuming that both sets have equal errors , we can estimate a typical error of 4.8 mfor our measurements in a single spectrum .",
    "this difference in the ews does not depend on the measurement procedure or on the continuum tracing .",
    "to show this , we compared several strong lines by superimposing some sample regions from the two spectra in figure [ lines ] ; the difference between the two spectra is directly visible there .",
    "a contribution due to inadequate subtraction of scattered light during the reduction does not seem likely . in the uves spectra , the o@xmath88 telluric",

    "we have no explanation at present for this difference , although it is noteworthy that the spectra were taken at different phases ( spaced roughly by a quarter of an orbit ) .    since not all the lines were detected and measured in both spectra , in order to calculate the ews to be used for the analysis , we computed an `` average '' correction , _",

    "the result by gratton et al . is based on a comparison of expected departures from lte with empirical determinations of fe ionization equilibrium for stars where departures from lte are expected to be much stronger than in turn - off stars , due to the combination of a stronger ionizing flux and low surface gravity , in particular rr lyrae .",
    "more recently , analysis of even hotter stars on the blue horizontal branch of several globular clusters ( at temperatures of about 8,000k ) by behr ( 1999 ) also confirms that a good equilibrium of ionization for fe can be obtained assuming lte ( and atmospheric parameters derived from the location of the star in the colour - magnitude diagram ) . according to gratton et al .",

    "our results clearly indicate that the chemical composition of the atmosphere of he  0024@xmath12523 is the outcome of an _",

    "s_-process nucleosynthesis is associated with the agb stage of evolution , during which the star is powered by hydrogen and helium burning in two shells located above a degenerate core ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , iben & renzini 1983 ) .",
    "late on the agb , intermediate mass stars undergo recurrent thermal instabilities of the he shell , in which partial he burning occurs convectively over short periods of time , sweeping across the whole region that lies between the h and the he shells . during this phase , the material from the he inter - shell that is enriched in c and _",
    "s_-process elements is taken to the surface by the extension of the envelope convection ( third dredge up ) . even later in the evolution , as the result of stellar winds which progressively strip its envelope , only the degenerate core is left and the star will become a white dwarf ( see busso _",
    "et al . _ , 2001 , for a thorough discussion of _ s_-process elements nucleosynthesis ) .",
    "as discussed in paper i , the observational data indicate that he  0024@xmath12523 is presently going through its upper main - sequence phase and thus is not capable of having produced the abundance pattern we have measured .",
    "the necessity of an external origin of some of the detected elements , and the clear binarity of the object , suggests that he  0024@xmath12523is an _ extrinsic _ ch star , _",
    "i.e. _ the atmosphere of the star observed has been polluted by material that has been processed by a more massive companion which already underwent its agb phase and is now a white dwarf ( and undetectable in our present observations ) .",
    "this model is further supported by consideration of the orbital solution , as discussed in  3.3 above .",
    "it is noteworthy that the orbital period of he  0024@xmath12523 is unusually short , compared with those typical of this class of object , which is several hundred days ( mcclure & woodsworth , 1990 ) .",
    "this anomaly suggests that he  0024@xmath12523 went through a common envelope phase at an earlier stage of the binary interaction , when the more massive component expands so rapidly that mass transfer is unstable , and the companion is engulfed in the atmosphere of the donor star .",
    "the ejection of the envelope requires energy to be removed from the orbit , and the latter shrinks , shortening its period ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , sandquist _",
    "et al . _ , 1998 ) .",
    "this picture could explain the peculiarity of this star as the result of a more pronounced difference between the original masses of the components of the binary , since the common envelope phase is the consequence of unstable mass transfer .",
    "this is consistent with the measured c isotopic ratio , which , as discussed later in this section , suggests an initial mass for the evolved companion of at least @xmath283m@xmath43 . had the stars been more similar in mass , the mass transfer might have taken place quiescently , and the orbit would have shrunk much less , probably reaching the typical ch star period .",
    "we now compare our measured abundances for the _",
    "s_-process elements to those predicted from an evolution model computed for a metallicity of [ fe / h]=@xmath12.6 and mass m=1.5m@xmath43 ( gallino 2002 , priv .",
    "comm . ) , which we consider here as representative of the now evolved - companion of the observed star .",
    "in order to compare the predictions with the observations , we assumed a _ dilution factor _ , the percentage of atmospheric material which has been accreted by the observed star from the donor star , of 10% .",
    "this assumption , while reasonable , is completely arbitrary , and was set to match the observed carbon abundance .",
    "we also made the natural assumption that the original ( _ i.e. _ pre - accretion ) abundance pattern of the observed star resembled that of a typical star of similar metallicity .",
    "for this purpose , we used the mean of the abundances measured in several stars at [ fe / h]@xmath1112.7 ( see  5.2 of paper ii for more details on the sample ) .",
    "the comparison is shown in figure [ theory ] .",
    "several elements shown have negligible contribution from the shell nucleosynthesis ( mg through fe ) , thus the fit is not very meaningful for them .",
    "the prediction in the case of pb and ba , produced exclusively by agb nucleosynthesis , is excellent , with the model falling well within the error bars . on the other hand",
    ", sr is not reproduced particularly well .",
    "however , it should be kept in mind that the contribution of the original ( pre - accretion ) sr content to the final one has to be considered as well ; the measured sr abundance in metal - poor stars is known to have a large scatter .",
    "thus , it is possible that the average sr content that we assumed as representing the original abundance of this element does not pertain .",
    "the measured upper limits for the abundances of eu , la , y and zr are indicated by arrows .",
    "all of them are consistent with the model .    while the model seems to reproduce satisfactorily our measurements for _",
    "s_-process elements , it fails to explain the low @xmath6c/@xmath16c ratio , predicting a value of several hundred ( gallino 2002 , priv .",
    "comm . ) . the low measured ratio ( @xmath6c/@xmath16c = @xmath112 ) is quite unusual for _ s_-process enriched material . in fact",
    ", the _ primary _ source of neutrons is thought to be the @xmath16c(@xmath17 , n)@xmath18o reaction , hence @xmath16c is expected to be highly depleted .",
    "the value of the isotopic ratio is only marginally larger than that of cn cycle equilibrium value ( @xmath6c/@xmath16c@xmath113 ) , and seems to suggest a signature of hot bottom burning ( hbb hereafter ) .",
    "since the observed star is still on the main sequence , it has not gone through the first dredge - up and all the carbon observed , both @xmath16c and @xmath6c , presumably comes from the former agb donor star .",
    "on the basis of the hypothesis that the donor star underwent hbb before mass transfer took place , we can place a reasonable lower limit to the _ original _ mass of the donor star , which is the minimum mass for which hbb is expected to occur .",
    "this is @xmath114 ( marigo 2002 , private communication ) for the metallicity under discussion .",
    "this value is lower than the usual one , @xmath115 ( marigo 1998 ) , because , as metallicity declines , the mass at which the temperature necessary for igniting hbb is reached also decreases ( see siess , livio , & lattanzio 2002 for an extreme case at zero metallicity ) .",
    "it should be noted that the initial mass for the shell nucleosynthesis model we used for comparison , m=1.5m@xmath43 , is smaller than the lower limit placed when taking into account the low @xmath6c/@xmath16c .",
    "hbb , which would lower the above mentioned ratio , possibly approaching that of our measurement , is not achieved in the model .",
    "a recent paper by ventura , dantona , & mazzitelli ( 2002 ) presents the yields from agb stars with @xmath116 and @xmath117 } \\le -0.3 $ ] .",
    "their results seem to agree with our findings for he  0024@xmath12523 , both for the isotopic c ratio and c / o ratio .",
    "nevertheless , the n abundance and the n / o ratio are not reproduced in these models , which predict that the n abundance should be about an order of magnitude larger than that of c. as shown in fig [ theory ] , unlike the data in the literature , the extreme value of [ pb / ba ] for he  0024@xmath12523 is very well explained by models with the standard mass of the @xmath16c pocket ( busso _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 ) , which predict [ pb / ba]@xmath282 . on the other hand ,",
    "the values found in the literature ( see table [ chs ] ) are lower and , in order to be matched by the models , would require a reduction of the mass of the @xmath16c pocket by factors 6 to 24 ( aoki _ et al . _",
    "although the data for the @xmath6c/@xmath16c ratio in other similar stars are still very limited , it is noteworthy that the value for he  0024@xmath12523 is the lowest of the sample , consistent with the suggestion that the donor star had an unusually high initial mass , as discussed above .",
    "figure [ comp ] displays the ratio [ pb / ba ] for he  0024@xmath12523 and for data from the literature ( aoki _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 ; aoki _ et al .",
    "_ 2002b , c ) as a function of [ fe / h ] . aoki _",
    "( 2002c ) suggested that the available data might show evidence of a decreasing trend of [ pb / ba ] with decreasing [ fe / h ] .",
    "our analysis seems not to support this hypothesis , at least in all cases .",
    "it is quite clear from fig [ comp ] that , once the data point for he  0024@xmath12523 is added , no correlation seems to be present .",
    "however , caution should be exerted when drawing any conclusion from this apparent lack of correlation .",
    "he  0024@xmath12523 is the only star in the sample which likely went through a common envelope phase , which may well have influenced the nucleosynthesis history of the donor star .",
    "thus , the exceptionally high [ pb / ba ] for such a low metallicity ( [ fe / h]=@xmath12.7 ) , with respect to those found in the literature , could arise from the peculiar evolution of he  0024@xmath12523 , and not destroy the [ pb / ba ] vs [ fe / h ] correlation suggested by aoki _",
    "( 2002c ) .",
    "presumably , the addition of more stars with measured [ pb / ba ] , especially at the lowest metallicity , will help clarify the situation .",
    "another noteworthy feature seen in figure [ comp ] is the larger scatter in [ pb / ba ] about the regression line for stars with detected radial velocity variations . for these objects ,",
    "the observed _",
    "s_-process enrichment is a signature of the nucleosynthesis which took place on the companions during their agb phase and was then accreted by the observed stars .",
    "thus , our results indicate that the ratio [ pb / ba ] produced by the _",
    "s_-process in metal - poor stars ( [ fe / h]@xmath118 ) shows a large scatter .    a possible explanation for this scatter could be a correlation between the [ pb / ba ] ratio and the radial velocity variations . in fact",
    ", we could invoke the presence of a close companion as a factor affecting shell nucleosynthesis .",
    "if the orbital period is large , the donor star will undergo complete evolution along the agb , and the composition of the accreting star will be dominated by material lost by the evolved star just before the final thermal pulse and planetary nebula ejection . on the other hand , a very short period , like the one observed in the case of he  0024@xmath12523 , indicates a past common - envelope phase ; during this stage , a large amount of mass is lost by the system , leading to a premature end of the thermal pulse phase of the donor . in this case the chemical composition of the accreting star will be dominated by material lost by the evolved star during earlier phases of the evolution along the agb .",
    "this may have a big impact on hbb processes , affecting the abundances of @xmath6c , @xmath16c , n and possibly even o , and thus the entire _",
    "s_-process history , which relies on @xmath16c pocket as a neutron source .      a number of recent papers ( _ e.g. _ , preston & sneden 2000 ; carney _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 ; ryan _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 ) , considering a wide range of evidence ( _ e.g. _ , the observed high binary fraction amongst field blue stragglers , the distribution of observed orbital periods and eccentricities in metal - poor carbon - enhanced stars ) , have come to the conclusion that the formation of blue stragglers is closely connected to the presence ( now , or in the past ) of a companion star which has undergone mass transfer .",
    "( 2001 ) , in particular , have argued that li depletion in mass - transfer binaries ( even those which are presently too cool to be referred to as blue stragglers ) might account for the lack of li observed in the field blue stragglers that they have either already evolved into , or which they will eventually evolve into .",
    "( 2002 ) have recently provided clear evidence that a large fraction of halo main - sequence stars that exhibit extreme li depletion _ also _ have substantial axial rotation , with @xmath119 in the range @xmath120 km  s@xmath3 .",
    "one is thus tempted to consider the observed properties of he  0024@xmath12523 , and ask whether it might present an extreme example of these phenomena .    clearly , the presence of carbon - enhancement and _",
    "s_-process elements in he  0024@xmath12523 are consistent with previous episodes of mass transfer .",
    "the observed upper limit of the lithium abundance , ( @xmath110(li ) = + 1.4 , see section [ lisyn ] ) , is quite in line with the observed upper limits of the li - depleted stars discussed by ryan _",
    "( 2001 ) ( see their figure 2 ) .",
    "the estimated @xmath119 of he  0024@xmath12523 is at the high end ( though still consistent with ) the range of the ryan _",
    "( 2002 ) stars .",
    "the orbital eccentricities of the ryan _",
    "( 2002 ) li - depleted stars are low as well , @xmath121 ( one , bd@xmath122 , is very close to circular ) , as are the eccentricities of the field blue stragglers of carney _ et al . _",
    "( 2001 ) . in the case of the latter , @xmath123 .",
    "it is worth noting that several of the blue stragglers in the carney _",
    "( 2001 ) sample exhibit detectable axial rotation , on the order of 9 - 10 km  s@xmath3 , similar to what we observe in he  0024@xmath12523 . as has been emphasized by ryan _",
    "( 2002 ) , such high rotational velocities would not be naively expected for ( presumably ) quite ancient stars of the halo population , and must have resulted from some late - stage spin - up , quite likely at the time of mass transfer .    the one observable that clearly distinguishes he  0024@xmath12523 from the stars studied by ryan _",
    "( 2002 ) is its extremely short orbital period , @xmath1243.4 days , as compared to the typical orbital period of 200 - 700 days in the latter sample .",
    "however , there are three field blue stragglers in the carney _",
    "_ sample , cs  22170 - 028 , cs  22873 - 139 , and cs  22890 - 069 , which possess orbital periods of from 1 to 20 days , similar to he  0024@xmath12523 ( the rest of the carney et .",
    "sample exhibit orbital periods that are substantially longer ) .",
    "the axial rotations of these three stars have not been measured .",
    "the case of cs 22873 - 139 is particularly interesting , as this star was shown to be a double - line spectroscopic binary by preston ( 1994 ) , who argued that at least the primary of this system might be identified with the `` blue metal - poor main - sequence '' ( bmp ) population of halo stars noted by preston , beers , & shectman ( 1994 ) .",
    "these bmp stars are the very same population which preston & sneden ( 2000 ) showed to be dominated by binaries , presumably many of which either are , or will become , field blue stragglers . in a detailed high - resolution study by spite _",
    "et al . _ ( 2000 ) , this star was shown to exhibit an unusual pattern of elemental abundances , with strikingly low [ sr / fe ] ( @xmath125 ) , [ mg / fe ] ( @xmath126 ) , [ ca / fe ] ( + 0.16 ) , and [ al / fe ] ( @xmath10.80 ) , both compared to most other halo stars , and to he  0024@xmath12523 . there is no evidence of carbon enhancement in this star .",
    "the li doublet at 6707 was not detected , though spite _",
    "_ argued that the abundance of lithium might still be consistent with the primordial value , based on the quality of their available data .",
    "clearly , the abundance variations among the populations of stars that might be associated with the blue - straggler phenomenon has yet to be fully explored .",
    "the peculiarity of he  0024@xmath12523 , and the comparison of its measured abundances and orbital parameters with other metal - poor stars in the literature suggest a correlation between binarity and observed _ s_-process element patterns . this hypothesis is based on a very limited number of objects , and a larger sample of well - studied cemp stars is required to improve our knowledge of the different evolutionary states , formation scenarios , and nucleosynthesis histories of these objects . to this end , we have already obtained spectra with hires of four more examples of apparent cemp stars selected in the same way as described in paper i of this series .",
