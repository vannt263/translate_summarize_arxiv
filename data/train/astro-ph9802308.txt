    "a similar analysis has been carried out by dwek & slavin ( dwek & slavin 1994 ) . the inferred large values of the diffuse near - infrared background density extrapolated to the infrared would imply that it is virtually impossible to discover any extragalactic source above a few tev .",
    "however , biller et al . ( biller et al . 1995 ) correctly pointed out that unless the source spectrum is known , one measured tev source can only yield an upper limit , because the cut - off may be due to internal absorption at the source .",

    "the two outbursts of mkn421 in spring of 1995 and 1996 ( kerrick et al . 1995b , gaidos et al . 1996 , buckley et al . 1996 ) have shown , both objects also exhibit rapid variability with large amplitudes in the tev energy range .",
    "the hegra collaboration showed that between march 16 and march 20 ( about 27 hours observation time ) the mkn501 energy spectrum in the tev energy range extended beyond 10 tev without a visible break in the power law spectrum with a differential power law index of 2.49 @xmath11 0.11 ( stat . ) @xmath11 0.25 ( syst . )",

    "the current experimental and model situation regarding the dirb is summarized in fig .",
    "since the published energy spectra for both of the extragalactic sources show no spectral break we do not incorporate the claimed detections of the dirb density based on preliminary mkn421 spectra ( stecker et al .",

    "we include , however , the recent tentative detection of the far - infrared background radiation ( puget et al . 1996 ) by cobe which is an important step towards a direct measurement of the flux in the ir - regime and which is at the moment rather weakly constrained by the results given by hauser in calzetti et al .",
    "+ due to the cosmological implications of the dirb photon density a great number of diffuse ir models ranging from simple power laws to multicomponent spectra have been developed by many authors .",
    "a large number of parameters such as the star / galaxy formation rate , the number distribution of star masses , the dust content and all cosmological parameters enter into these models . in fig .",
    "[ dirb ] we show the predictions of two complex models : the model which we later employ for the numerical calculation is by macminn & primack ( macminn & primack 1996 ) who have calculated the dirb for various realizations of cosmological parameters and dark matter models .",
    "the results clearly depend on the set of parameters , and the flux predictions vary at most by a factor of 3 .",
    "accounting for the uncertainties of the model an average dirb spectrum is assumed in the following . the model by fall , charlot & pei ( fall et al .",
    "1996 ) is based on the assumption that the star formation rate is directly related to the consumption of neutral gas .",
    "the density of neutral gas can be determined from analyses of ly@xmath13 absorption lines as seen in distant quasar spectra thus leading to a cosmological rate of star formation out to distances of @xmath14 .",

    "petry ( petry 1997 ) and aharonian et al .",
    "( aharonian et al . 1997 ) have shown that the tev energy spectrum of mkn501 can be described by an unattenuated power law with differential indices of @xmath48 ( total error ) in 1996 and @xmath49 ( stat . ) in may 1997 , respectively .",

    "( 10 hours ) as measured with the hegra ct system we show the differential flux spectra in fig .",
    "[ spectrum2 ] .    from the observed unattenuated energy spectrum extending up to 10tev",
    "we conclude that the optical depth for this source is less than unity , i.e. , @xmath51 . to derive the upper limit on the dirb photon density we take @xmath52 and @xmath53 , and assume a specific shape of the ir - density .",
    "+ for the energy range @xmath54ev @xmath55ev we make an ansatz for the infrared spectrum based on the results of two different models ( outside this energy range only the macminn & primack model shown in fig .",
    "[ dirb ] is used ) : ( i ) @xmath56 with the pivot energy point @xmath57 and ( ii ) the shape of the spectrum in this energy range is assumed to be identical with the models by macminn & primack but its absolute level is varied in the calculation .",
    "the results for the first ansatz are presented in fig .",
    "[ irexcl ] where values of @xmath58 and @xmath59 below the curve are still allowed by the detection of mkn501 at 10tev . to illustrate the impact of a still not excluded observation of the unabsorbed spectrum extending up to 15tev , a second curve was added in the figure .    using the second model",
    "ansatz the observation of mkn501 at 10tev restricts the normalization @xmath60 of the spectral segment between @xmath61ev and @xmath62ev to @xmath63 ( times the flux assumed in this work ) . at the pivot energy point of @xmath64ev",
    "we thus determine upper limits of @xmath65ev/@xmath66 for the macminn & primack model and @xmath67ev/@xmath66 for the powerlaw ansatz and assuming the slope of the spectrum to be flat ( @xmath68 ) around the pivot point . a comparison with fig",
    ".  [ dirb ] , where we have added the upper limit curve derived using the macminn & primack ansatz , indicates that these limits are about two orders of magnitude below those accessible by direct measurements at this energy and that they are compatible with the tentative firas measurement of the ir density ( puget et al .",
    "as pointed out in the introduction , the measurement of single spectra , even if a break - off feature is observed , does not permit a determination of the actual level of the dirb density .",
    "up to the end of the 1997 observation period ( october 1997 ) the blazar mkn501 continued to be in a high state with respect to tev emission .",
    "the increasing statistics will enable erenkov telescope experiments to extend observations to higher energies and search for cut - off features .",
    "the relationship between the infrared photon density in the energy range from @xmath69 ev to @xmath70ev , assuming a powerlaw spectrum @xmath71 , and the maximum observable energy , i.e. , @xmath72 with optical depth @xmath73 = 1 , for different values of redshift @xmath3 is shown in fig .",
    "[ irul ] . if e.g.no cut - off is observed up to around 70tev we would thus derive , using the above described procedure , an upper limit on the dirb density of about 0.1 times the average macminn & primack model prediction .",
    "based on the observation of the _ unabsorbed _ mkn501 @xmath2-spectrum extending beyond 10tev ,",
    "we have derived a stringent upper limit on the extragalactic diffuse infrared photon energy density in the energy range from @xmath69 to @xmath70ev of 1.8 times the prediction of an average model by macminn & primack .",
    "this translates into an upper limit of the energy density at the used pivot energy point of @xmath64ev of @xmath65ev/@xmath66 . for the second ansatz ,",
    "i.e. , a power - law ansatz for the dirb around this pivot energy point , we determined upper limits on the normalization as a function of the spectral index , e.g.for a flat spectrum @xmath74 , the resulting upper limit is @xmath75ev/@xmath66 .",
    "these upper limits are about 2 orders of magnitude _ below _ upper limits derived from current direct measurements at this energy and are not in contradiction to a value of the dirb density derived from preliminary evidence of tev emission reported by meyer & westerhoff ( meyer & westerhoff 1996 ) .",
    "+ the results presented in this paper are well compatible with other analyses of the infrared photon density based on the hegra ct data of mkn501 ( mannheim 1997 , stanev & franceschini 1997 ) .",
    "they are also in good agreement with an empirical calculation of the dirb based on galaxy luminosity functions in the ir ( malkan & stecker 1997 ) which in turn is in good agreement with recent dirb models derived from star formation data ( guiderdoni et al ."
