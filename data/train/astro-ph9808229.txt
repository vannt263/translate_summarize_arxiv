    "observational studies of molecular gas in the milky way have clearly shown that stars are formed from dense cores of molecular clouds rather than their diffuse envelopes ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "hence it is essential to study the properties of dense molecular gas in order to understand star formation in galaxies , and particularly starburst phenomena .",
    "dense molecular material is investigated by observing the molecules referred as `` high density tracers '' , which require larger hydrogen density than that of co for their collisional excitation , such as hcn , hco@xmath8 , cs , and so on ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "for example ,",
    "co(1@xmath10 ) emission is excited even in low density molecular gas ( @xmath9 @xmath10 500 @xmath11 ) , whereas hcn(1@xmath10 ) emission traces very dense molecular clouds ( @xmath9 @xmath12 10@xmath13 @xmath11 ) due to its quite larger dipole moment ( @xmath14 = 3.0 debye , whereas @xmath15 = 0.10 debye ) .",
    "observational evidence suggesting a close relationship between dense molecular gas and massive star formation in various galaxies has been accumulated in recent years ; solomon et al .  (",
    "1992 ) reported a tight correlation between the hcn(1@xmath10 ) and far - infrared luminosity in 12 galaxies , suggesting that the star formation rate is tightly related to the amount of the dense molecular gas measured by hcn emission .",
    "this study has been expanded to larger samples ( @xcite ) .",
    "it has been also claimed that the hcn luminosity correlates with the h92@xmath16 recombination line luminosity , which is another tracer of massive star formation ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is then natural to expect that dense molecular gas has a similar spatial distribution as that of the massive star forming regions .",
    "indeed , a rough association between dense molecular complexes and star forming regions traced by radio continuum emission has been observed in the prototypical starbursts m82 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and ngc 253 ( @xcite ) . however , there are contradicting results on hcn  fir correlation ( e.g. @xcite ) , and only a few galaxies till present have been mapped in hcn emission with enough high spatial resolution to compare with the massive star forming regions .",
    "it is therefore necessary to observe hcn emission from the galaxies which have extended massive star forming regions .",
    "the formation mechanism of dense molecular clouds is another important issue . at large spatial scales , gravitational instabilities of the molecular gas ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) and the shocks associated with the orbit crowdings ( e.g. @xcite )",
    "are thought to be responsible for the dense gas formation .",
    "closer to the centers of galaxies , inner lindblad resonances ( ilrs ) are considered to be essential to explain the distribution and kinematics of molecular gas as well as star formation ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and therefore dense gas cloud formation .    in order to address the issues described above , we observed co(1@xmath10 ) and hcn(1@xmath10 ) emission in the central region of a nearby barred spiral galaxy , ngc 6951 , using the nobeyama millimeter array ( nma ) and the nobeyama 45 m telescope .",
    "optical and radio observations indicate a vigorous star formation in the circumnuclear region of this galaxy . both h@xmath16",
    "( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and 6 cm radio continuum emission ( @xcite ; @xcite ) are mainly concentrated in the central ( a few hundred parsec ) region of ngc 6951 , indicating that most of the star formation occurs in a circumnuclear ring structure ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the diameter of this circumnuclear star forming ring is about 6@xmath0 @xmath17 9@xmath0 ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the star formation rate of the ring estimated from the h@xmath16 luminosity is @xmath10 4 @xmath18 yr@xmath19 after correction for internal extinction ( table [ tbl1 ] ) , and is comparable to those in the central regions of nearby starburst galaxies , though the gas consumption timescale due to star formation is fairly longer than those in starbursts ( @xcite ) .",
    "we can therefore resolve spatially the distribution of dense molecular gas using a millimeter - wave interferometer , and compare it with the extent of the vigorous star forming regions .",
    "near - infrared photometry has revealed the presence of a large stellar bar with a semimajor radius of @xmath10 44@xmath0 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , which corresponds to @xmath10 5 kpc at the adopted distance of @xmath20 = 24.1 mpc .",
    "optical images show two straight dust lanes along the bar ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) which trace the shock front at the leading edges of the bar as predicted from numerical simulations ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "co(1@xmath10 ) emission has been mapped with the caltech millimeter array ( @xcite ) and show a `` twin peaks '' morphology .",
    "the positions of the ilrs deduced from their co rotation curve indicate that the two - armed co peaks would be explained as a result of orbit crowding near the outer ilr ( oilr ) .",
    "therefore , this circumnuclear ring of ngc 6951 provides us with an unique opportunity to investigate the relationship between the spatial variations of the physical conditions of molecular gas and its dynamics , especially concerned orbit resonances and associated shocks .",
    "in addition to the study of the star forming activity , in this object we can also address the relationship between an agn and molecular gas properties , because this galaxy hosts an active nucleus ( type-2 seyfert ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . as it has been reported in the recent literature , there seems to be a striking enhancement of the integrated hcn(1@xmath10 ) to co(1@xmath10 ) intensity ratio in brightness temperature scale ( hereafter @xmath2 ) toward the type-2 seyfert nucleus of ngc 1068 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and the low - luminosity active galactic nucleus in m51 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) ; the @xmath2 is as high as @xmath10 0.5 toward these two seyfert nuclei .",
    "these high @xmath2 values in a few hundred parsec scale region have never been found anywhere in the milky way , implying extreme conditions of the molecular gas in the circumnuclear region of seyfert galaxies .",
    "it is therefore quite exciting to explore whether such an extremely high @xmath2 is common or not in the circumnuclear regions of seyfert galaxies .",

    "we describe the observational parameters and results in section 2 , and present new co and hcn data of ngc 6951 in section 3 , which reveal the different distribution of hcn emission from co , namely , the spatial variation of physical condition in the circumnuclear molecular clouds . with these data ,",
    "we discuss about the possible cause of the variation and its relationship to the central activity of ngc 6951 in section 4 .",
    "finally we summarize the conclusions of this study in section 5 .",
    "the central region of ngc 6951 was observed in the j=1@xmath10 line of co and hcn with the nma .",
    "the nma consists of six 10 m dishes providing 15 baselines simultaneously .",
    "the observations were made during november 1995 to feburary 1996 in the three available array configurations ( ab , c , & d ) . due to the limitation of the minimum projected baseline length ( 10 m ) , extended structures larger than about 50@xmath0 in each channel map are not sampled in the observations .",
    "the front - end are tunerless sis receivers , whose receiver temperature is @xmath10 50 k in double side band , and the typical system noise temperature ( in single side band ) were 300  600 k for the hcn observations and 400  800 k for co the observations .",
    "a digital spectro - correlator fx was configured to cover 320 mhz with 1024 channels per baseline .",
    "sideband separation was achieved by 90@xmath21 phase switching .",
    "we observed a radio source 3c418 for 5 minutes every 30 minutes in order to calibrate temporal variations of the visibility amplitude and phase .",
    "the passband across 1024 channels was calibrated through observations of strong continuum sources 3c273 and nrao 530 .",
    "the flux density of the reference calibrator 3c418 was measured at 88 ghz from comparisons with planets of known brightness temperatures .",
    "the flux density of 3c418 at 114 ghz ( co observations ) was estimated by an extrapolation of its spectrum assuming a spectral index of -0.34 which was derived from the flux at 88 ghz and the lower frequency fluxes listed in the vla calibrator database .",
    "the uncertainty in the absolute flux scale is @xmath22 20 % .",
    "the raw data were calibrated and edited using the package uvproc - ii developed at nro and fourier transformed with natural _ uv _ weighting with the nrao aips .",

    "we used two cooled sis mixer receivers equipped with sideband rejection filters and observed both co and hcn line simultaneously .",
    "the beam squint of the two receivers had been aligned to less than 2@xmath0 .",
    "absolute pointing of the antenna was checked every hour using the sio maser source t - cep at 43 ghz , and was measured as accurate as @xmath10 2@xmath0 rms .",
    "system noise temperature for co and hcn observations were typically 750 k and 350 k in single side band , respectively .",
    "sky emission were subtracted by position switching with two off - source positions at offsets in azimuth of @xmath26 5@xmath27 from the observed position .",
    "spectra of co and hcn emission were obtained with 2048 channels acousto - optical spectrometers of 250 mhz bandwidth , corresponding to a velocity coverage of 650 km s@xmath19 for co observations , and 850 km s@xmath19 for hcn observations .",
    "only linear baselines were removed from the spectra and adjacent channels were binned to a velocity resolution of 10 km s@xmath19 and 20 km s@xmath19 for co and hcn spectra , respectively .",
    "the resultant noise level of the co spectrum was 9.5 mk rms in @xmath28 scale and 2.4 mk rms for the hcn spectrum .",

    "it is noteworthy that both co and hcn emission are weak near the systemic velocity ( @xmath30 km s@xmath31 ; table [ tbl4 ] ) , indicating that neither co nor hcn emission show significant concentration toward the seyfert nucleus of ngc 6951 .",

    "here we compare the co and hcn flux from our nma observations with single - dish observations in order to evaluate the missing flux of our interferometry .",

    "we detected a total hcn flux of 18.7 @xmath26 1.9 jy km s@xmath19 inside our field of view ( 84@xmath0 ) .",
    "since there are no data for hcn flux observed with any 10 m class single - dish telescope , we convolved our hcn data cube to 19@xmath0 resolution and compared them with the 45 m spectrum .",

    "co emission in the central region of ngc 6951 is confirmed to be dominated by two strong peaks on spiral arms ( hereafter the co arms ) , referred as `` twin - peaks '' by kenney et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , which are directly connected to the dust lanes along the bar .",
    "the inner part of the two co arms corresponds to the circumnuclear star forming ring .",
    "these features agree well with the previously reported one ( @xcite ) . on the other hand , as it can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , _ the distribution of the hcn emission is significantly different to that of co_. first , though the hcn emission also shows a twin peak morphology , the peaks are spatially shifted from those of co. if we assume that the spiral arms of ngc 6951 seen in optical images ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) are trailing as in case of almost all spiral galaxies , the rotation is clockwise as indicated by an arrow in the figure and the hcn emission is shifted downstream .",
    "moreover , the hcn peaks are located closer to the nucleus than the co peaks .",
    "about 44 % of the total co flux comes from the ring ( @xmath34 ) , whereas 60 % of the hcn emission is associated with it .",
    "namely , _ the hcn emission correlates better spatially with the massive star forming region than the co emission in ngc 6951_. although the presence of a strong and non - uniform extinction is reported from the h@xmath16/h@xmath35 ratio variations across the ring ( @xcite ) , both h@xmath16 and radio continuum show good agreement with the hcn emission .",
    "association between the hcn distribution and the massive star forming regions has been reported in prototypical starburst galaxies m 82 ( @xcite ; golla et al .",

    "30@xmath0 from the nucleus ( @xcite ; see also the co mosaic map in @xcite ) .",
    "accordingly , the hcn emission may correlate better spatially with the star formation than the co emission in ic 342 , as in the case of ngc 6951 . ]",
    "we note that the fir / hcn luminosity ratio @xmath36 in ngc 6951 is about 400 ( table [ tbl2 ] ) , which is similar to the values in ultra - luminous ir galaxies , whereas @xmath37 @xmath10 40 is about 5 times smaller than those in ultra - luminous ir galaxies ( solomon et al .  1992 ) .",
    "these comparisons support the results of solomon et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , which have shown that @xmath36 is independent of the @xmath38 , whereas @xmath37 increases with @xmath38 .",
    "interestingly , there is no central peak in hcn emission .",

    "the mass of molecular gas is estimated from the co emission assuming the galactic @xmath39(co ) to @xmath40(h@xmath41 ) conversion factor . adopting a conversion factor of @xmath42 @xmath43 ( k km s@xmath19)@xmath19 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , the mass of molecular hydrogen is @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the co flux density .",
    "taking into account that the mass of molecular contents including he and other elements as @xmath46 , the total mass of molecular gas detected in our integrated intensity map is @xmath47 @xmath18 , and the molecular gas mass within @xmath34 , the radius of the circumnuclear ring , is @xmath48 @xmath18 .    the surface mass density of molecular hydrogen on the galaxy plane",
    "is calculated as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the inclination of the galaxy ( @xmath50 = 42@xmath21 for ngc 6951 ) . in case of our co observations ,",

    "as seen in the previous section , the distribution of dense molecular gas correlates very well with the massive star forming region in the center of ngc 6951 , and the @xmath2 ratio is also enhanced at the circumnuclear ring where vigorous star formation occurs . a spatial coincidence of the hcn cloud complex and nuclear massive star forming regions , and an enhancement of @xmath2 there ,",

    "considering the fact that stars are formed in the _ dense molecular cores _ rather than the diffuse envelopes of the molecular clouds in the milky way ( e.g. @xcite ) , these quantitative and spatial correlation seem to indicate that the presence of dense molecular gas in these a few hundred parsec scale in the central regions of galaxies could be a _ cause _ of massive star formation .",
    "therefore , it is now essential to address the formation mechanism of dense molecular clouds in order to explain the varieties of star formation in the central regions of galaxies .",
    "what kind of physical processes govern the spatial variation of @xmath2 , namely , the distribution of dense molecular gas in the circumnuclear region of ngc 6951 ?",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed to explain dense molecular gas cloud formation in the circumnuclear rings within the ilrs .",
    "one is the shocks along the orbit crowding ; a crowding of gas stream lines will cause frequent collisions of the molecular gas clouds and shocks there , which can eventually form dense molecular gas ( @xcite ) .",
    "another scenario is the gravitational instability of the accumulated gas near the ilrs ( @xcite ) . in order to address this issue , we first compared the distribution of @xmath2 with the maps of the total gas surface density and the gas velocity dispersion , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig16 ] . in this comparison",
    ", we see the following two features , ( i ) in spite of the significant co concentration , @xmath2 is _ not _ enhanced in the crowding regions of @xmath101 orbits , and ( ii ) there exists a possible anti - correlation between @xmath2 and the gas velocity dispersion . any scenarios to explain dense molecular gas formation",
    "should also account for these observed features . in the following section",
    ", we will discuss about the several possible scenarios .",
    "it appears to be evident that a dense cloud formation scenario by shocks along the orbit crowding can not explain the observed feature ( i ) .",
    "dust lanes and the molecular gas spirals located at the leading edges of stellar bars are considered to trace shocks associated with the orbit crowding of the distinct gas orbit families , @xmath102 and @xmath103 ( e.g. @xcite ) . in the case of ngc 6951",
    ", we find a possible infalling motion along the bar , and an enhancement of the co velocity dispersion there , which may support the interpretations since these agree well with the theoretical predictions .",
    "we therefore conclude that the shocked regions along the leading edges of the bar does not promote the formation of _ dense _ molecular gas efficiently but enhance the presence of low density gmcs .",
    "similar situations can be found in the central regions of other galaxies ; in the center of ic 342 , a ring - like structure with two offset ridges of molecular gas is observed in co emission ( @xcite ) , while hcn emission is detected only in the central ring - like region ( @xcite ) . the ring - like gas distribution and two offset gas ridges are due to ilrs with a stellar bar ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "high co brightness temperature , large gas velocity dispersion , and deviations from circular motions observed in the offset co ridges strongly suggest the presence of shocks there ( @xcite ) , however , the @xmath2 ratio is as small as @xmath10 0.05 compared with the central ring region where @xmath2 values are enhanced to @xmath10 0.12 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is also the case in another barred spiral galaxy ngc 1530 ( @xcite ) . as pointed out by downes et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and reynaud & downes ( 1997 ) , these shocks along the orbit crowding regions may be too turbulent to form dense molecular gas and the dense molecular gas fraction remains rather low there . this would account for the low star formation efficiencies ( sfes ) of the molecular gas along the dust lanes in the bar because the dense molecular gas fraction is considered to correlate with the sfes ( solomon et al .",
    "1992 ) .",
    "another possibility is gravitational instabilities of the molecular gas .",
    "especially , the observed feature ( ii ) , that is a possible anti - correlation between the distribution of @xmath2 and the gas velocity dispersion , implies that the large velocity dispersion in the orbit crowding region prevents the molecular gas from collapsing into the dense molecular clumps through the gravitational instabilities of the gas .",
    "in order to check whether gravitational theory can successfully explain the spatial variation of the @xmath2 or not , we estimated the toomre @xmath4 parameter ( toomre 1964 ) in the circumnuclear region of ngc 6951 .",
    "the toomre @xmath4 parameter characterizes the criteria for local stability in thin isothermal disks and is expressed as @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the molecular gas surface density @xmath106 , and @xmath107 is the critical surface density , given by @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the velocity dispersion in the radial direction , and @xmath110 is the epicyclic frequency . if the gas surface density @xmath105 exceeds the critical surface density @xmath107 , then an uniform gas disk is unstable to form rings or clumps which can ultimately collapse into dense molecular gas fragments and form stars . here",
    "we assume an isotropic velocity dispersion , namely , the velocity dispersion in the radial direction @xmath109 is the same as the one - dimensional velocity dispersion @xmath97 .",
    "at the radius of the ring , @xmath111 or 470 pc , we find @xmath107 is @xmath112 and an azimuthally averaged gas surface density @xmath113 m@xmath52 pc@xmath53",
    ". then we obtain the @xmath4 value of 0.6 , indicating that the molecular gas in the ring is gravitationally unstable .",
    "therefore dense molecular clouds could be formed via gravitational instability of the molecular gas in the circumnuclear star forming ring of ngc 6951 .",
    "it is then quite interesting to evaluate @xmath4 values in the outer regions of the ring where less active star formation occurs despite of strong co emission , but it appears to be no longer valid to apply the toomre s @xmath4 stability analysis in these regions because the gas morphology is far from an axisymmetric disk and the deviations of the gas orbits from circular motion are also significant there .",
    "we speculate that the molecular gas in the co peaks may not be gravitationally unstable , probably due to the very large velocity dispersion there .",
    "next , we evaluated the time scale of the gravitational instability .",
    "the growth rate of the gravitational instability can be estimated as the jeans time scale ( e.g. @xcite ) , @xmath114 for the averaged @xmath97 and @xmath105 at the radius of the ring .",
    "the rotation velocity at this radius is @xmath10 160 km s@xmath19 from fig .",

    "the time scale of the instability @xmath116 does not conflict with the observed offset between the co and hcn peaks , which is @xmath117 yrs at the radius of the ring .",
    "in consequence , the gravitational instability scenario could nominally explain the features ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "we therefore suggest that _ gravitational instabilities of molecular gas are responsible for the dense molecular gas formation and successive star formation in the circumnuclear region of ngc 6951_. this is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig17 ] ; the molecular gas along the dust lanes and successive co arms are too turbulent to form dense molecular clouds , although the largest co concentrations appear there .",
    "some of the molecular gas escaped from the @xmath3 shocked regions is driven into the @xmath103 orbits , and become unstable ( @xmath118 ) because of the smaller velocity dispersion on the @xmath103 orbit ring .",

    "kennicutt ( 1989 ) has successfully explained the threshold gas surface density for the star formation in the disk of galaxies via gravitational instabilities of the gas .    although kennicutt ( 1989 ) assumed a constant gas velocity dispersion in his work , variation of gas velocity dispersion may be intimately related to the gravitational instability of the gas as pointed out by sakamoto ( 1996 ) .",
    "contini et al .",

    "<S> we present high resolution ( 3@xmath0  5@xmath0 ) observations of co(j=1@xmath10 ) and hcn(j=1@xmath10 ) emission from the circumnuclear star forming ring in the barred spiral galaxy ngc 6951 , a host of a type-2 seyfert nucleus , using the nobeyama millimeter array and the nobeyama 45 m telescope .    </S>",
    "<S> we find that the distribution of the hcn emission is different from that of co in the circumnuclear region of ngc 6951 ; it is confirmed that co emission is dominated by `` twin peaks '' morphology with two spiral arms , which are connected to the dust lanes , as reported by kenney et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1992 ) . on the other hand , although the hcn emission also shows a twin peaks morphology , the hcn peaks are spatially shifted downstream compared with the co peaks . </S>",
    "<S> most of the hcn emission is associated with the circumnuclear ring , where vigorous star formation occurs . </S>",
    "<S> the hcn to co integrated intensity ratio in the brightness temperature scale , @xmath2 , is also enhanced in the star forming ring . </S>",
    "<S> the peak value of the @xmath2 is about 0.16  0.18 , which is comparable to the @xmath2 in the starburst regions of ngc 253 and m82 . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the hcn emission spatially correlates better with the massive star forming regions than the co emission in the circumnuclear region of ngc 6951 .    </S>",
    "<S> the formation mechanism of dense molecular gas has been investigated . </S>",
    "<S> no significant enhancement of @xmath2 is observed at the co peaks , which are interpreted as @xmath3 orbit crowding regions . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the shocks along the orbit crowding do not promote the formation of dense molecular gas effectively but enhance the presence of low density gmcs in ngc 6951 . instead </S>",
    "<S> , gravitational instability can account for the dense molecular gas formation in the circumnuclear star forming ring because toomre s @xmath4 value is below unity there .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath2 toward the type-2 seyfert nucleus of ngc 6951 is 0.086 averaged over central @xmath5 @xmath6 120 pc region . </S>",
    "<S> this is a rather normal value compared with non - active galaxies such as the milky way , and quite different from other type-2 seyfert galaxies ngc 1068 and m51 where extremely high @xmath2 of @xmath7 have been reported . </S>",
    "<S> the variety of @xmath2 values in these seyfert nuclei would be attributed to the different physical conditions of the molecular gas around the nuclei . </S>"
