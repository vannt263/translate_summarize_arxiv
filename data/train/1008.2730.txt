    "one of the signatures suggested for the formation of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) in relativistic heavy ion collisions is the suppressed production of @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "this was based on the idea that once the qgp is formed in heavy - ion collisions , the @xmath2 produced from initial hard scattering would be dissociated in the qgp because of the color screening between its charm and anticharm quark , reducing thus the number of produced @xmath2 .",
    "however , recent results from lattice quantum chromodynamics ( lqcd ) calculations have suggested that @xmath2 can exist above the critical temperature for the phase transition between the qgp and the hadron gas ( hg )  @xcite .",
    "this thus not only reduces the dissociation of @xmath2 but also can lead to the production of @xmath2 from the recombination of charm and anticharm quarks in qgp  @xcite .",
    "the latter effect becomes more important when the collision energy is high as more charm and anticharm quarks are produced from initial hard scattering .    experimentally , suppressed production of @xmath2 in heavy - ion collisions compared with that is expected from initial hard scattering has been observed at both super proton synchrotron ( sps ) and relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) @xcite .",
    "many theoretical explanations have been proposed to understand these experimental observations  @xcite . among them",
    "are the two - component model  @xcite and the statistical model  @xcite . in the two - component model , some of the initially produced @xmath2",
    "were found to survive during the collision if the @xmath2 dissociation temperature is sufficiently high  @xcite . in the statistical model , it is assumed , however , that all initially produced @xmath2 are dissociated in qgp and the detected @xmath2 are entirely due to regeneration from charm and anticharm quarks in the qgp  @xcite .",
    "both models have been able to successfully reproduce the measured nuclear modification factor @xmath0 of @xmath2 as a function of the number of participants  @xcite as well as of the transverse momentum of @xmath2  @xcite . in the two - component model ,",
    "the number of regenerated @xmath2 is smaller than that in the statistical model , because not all charm quarks produced in a collision are thermalized in qgp , the finally produced @xmath2 include , however , those produced from initial hard scattering and having survived thermal decay in the produced hot dense matter .",
    "although the transverse momentum of thermally produced @xmath2 in the statistical model is smaller than that of @xmath2 produced from initial hard scattering , it is enhanced by the transverse flow of @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to discriminate the two models based on the number of finally produced @xmath2 and their transverse momentum distribution .",
    "previously , two of us have studied in the two - component model the @xmath0 of @xmath2 as a function of the number of participants in heavy - ion collisions @xcite . in that study ,",
    "the initial local temperature of produced qgp was determined from the local entropy density , which was taken to be proportional to the linear combination of the number of participants and the number of binary collisions in that region .",
    "the initial fireball thus separates into two regions with temperatures higher and lower than the dissociation temperature of @xmath2 .",
    "while the survival rate of initially produced @xmath2 vanishes in the high temperature region , its value in the low temperature region is finite and depends on the temperature .",
    "the different values of the @xmath2 survival rate in the two regions were found to give rise to a kink in the dependence of the @xmath0 of @xmath2 on the number of participants as seen in the experimental data . in the above mentioned work , both the screening mass between charm and anticharm quark and the relaxation factor of charm quarks in qgp were calculated in the leading order in pqcd , while the dissociation cross section of charmonia in qgp were calculated up to the next - to - leading order in pqcd . according to lqcd",
    ", the strong coupling constant remains large up to around 2 @xmath3 , so below this temperature the qgp is nonperturbative and higher - order corrections in pqcd may not be negligible .",
    "the higher - order corrections are expected to enhance in qgp both the thermal decay rate of charmonia , which would decrease the number of initially produced @xmath2 , and the relaxation of charm quarks , which would increase the number of regenerated @xmath2 .",
    "the cancelation of these two effects is probably one of the reasons that both the two - component model and the statistical model can reproduce the measured @xmath0 of @xmath2 as a function of the number of participants in heavy - ion collisions .    in the present work ,",
    "we improve our previous two - component model in two ways .",
    "firstly , instead of assuming that the transverse acceleration of produced fireball is constant and then vanishes at a certain time as in the previous work , the acceleration in the present work is obtained from the pressure of the fireball and continues to be present until the fireball freezes out .",
    "secondly , we take into account the azimuthally anisotropic expansion in noncentral collisions by using a simple parametrization with a transverse - momentum - dependent flow velocity to reproduce the measured @xmath1 of light hadrons .",
    "this schematic fireball expansion model is then applied to study the @xmath0 of @xmath2 as a function of both the number of participants and the transverse momentum of @xmath2 as well as to study the @xmath1 of @xmath2 . for the chemical and thermal freeze - out temperatures , we follow those used in the statistical model . in this model ,",
    "the chemical freeze - out occurs at temperature around 160 mev , after which chemical equilibrium is reached and no additional effective chemical reactions are present and the kinetic freeze - out takes place later when the temperature drops to 120 mev . since the kinetic freeze - out depends on the elastic scattering cross sections of hadrons and unlike light hadrons , the elastic scattering cross sections of @xmath2 in hadronic matter are small , we assume that the kinetic freeze - out temperature for @xmath2 is the same as the chemical freeze - out temperature . finally , we take into account the higher - order corrections by multiplying the pqcd cross sections with arbitrary constants to study their effects on the @xmath0 and @xmath1 of @xmath2 .",
    "as shown later , although the fraction of @xmath2 produced from regeneration increases with increasing larger higher - order corrections , the resulting @xmath0 of @xmath2 remains essentially unchanged . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath1 of @xmath2 at low transverse momentum becomes more negative with larger higher - order corrections .",
    "therefore , studying the @xmath1 of @xmath2 can help to discriminate between the two @xmath2 production mechanisms of from initial hard scattering and regeneration in the qgp .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .  [ two ] , we briefly describe the two - component model used in ref .  @xcite .",

    "in the two - component model for @xmath2 production in relativistic heavy ion collisions , some of initially produced @xmath2 from hard scattering can survive through the collisions and contribute to the final observed @xmath2 in experiments , besides those regenerated from the charm and anticharm quarks in the produced qgp . in this section ,",
    "we briefly describe the method used in ref  @xcite to evaluate these two contributions .",
    "the number of initially produced @xmath2 in a heavy ion collision at impact parameter @xmath4 can be determined by using the glauber model , that is @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the cross section for @xmath2 production in a @xmath7 collision , which has a value of 0.774 @xmath8 per rapidity near midrapidity at collision energy @xmath9 gev @xcite , and a is the mass number of colliding nuclei .",
    "the overlap function @xmath10 in the above equation is defined by @xmath11 in terms of the thickness function @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the nucleon distribution in the colliding nucleus .",
    "the survival rate of initially produced @xmath2 in relativistic heavy ion collisions is then given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the time the @xmath2 is produced from initial hard scattering and @xmath16 is the time the @xmath2 freezes out from the hot dense matter .",
    "the @xmath2 survival rate depends on its thermal decay width @xmath17 in the produced hot dense matter , @xmath18 in the above , the summation is over the particle species @xmath19 , which includes the quark and gluon in qgp as well as the baryon and meson in hg , with its density denoted by @xmath20 ; @xmath21 is the relative velocity between the @xmath2 and the particle ; and @xmath22 is the dissociation cross section of the @xmath2 by the particle .",
    "since some directly produced @xmath2 are from the decay of directly produced excited charmonium states @xmath23 and @xmath24 , the survival rate of all initially produced @xmath2 from thermal decay is the linear combination of the survival rates for @xmath2 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , that is @xmath25 where we have assumed that 25% and 8% of @xmath2 are , respectively , from the feed - down of @xmath23 and @xmath24 as usually adopted in the literature @xcite .",
    "we note that in ref  @xcite the dissociate cross sections of charmonia in qgp were calculated in pqcd up to the next - to - leading order and those in hg were calculated via the factorization formula with the bethe - salpeter amplitude for the bound charmonium states  @xcite .      for regenerated @xmath2 , their number",

    "in our previous work @xcite , it was assumed for simplicity that the fireball formed in heavy - ion collisions expands transversely with constant acceleration of 0.1 @xmath46/fm until certain time . besides , the expansion is assumed to be azimuthally isotropic even in noncentral collisions , neglecting thus the initial elliptic shape of the collision geometry . since the transverse acceleration of the fireball is expected to be a smooth and continuous function of time and also to be azimuthally anisotropic in non - central collisions , we improve the treatment of the acceleration of the fireball by using the thermodynamical consideration and also introduce a simple parametrization with a transverse - momentum - dependent flow velocity for the anisotropic expansion .      to treat dynamically the transverse acceleration of the fireball formed in relativistic heavy ion collisions , we consider the pressure inside the fireball . in terms of the energy density @xmath47 , entropy density @xmath48 , and temperature @xmath49 of the fireball as well as the chemical potential @xmath50 and number density @xmath51 of particle species @xmath19 in the fireball at a certain time , the pressure @xmath52 is given by @xmath53 the outward force due to the pressure is then @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the area of the cylindrical side of the fireball .",

    "it is assumed in the above that the fireball is globally in thermal equilibrium .",
    "we have thus ignored the fact that in more realistic hydrodynamic approach only local thermal equilibrium is achieved and each fluid element of the fireball moves collectively . assuming the transverse acceleration @xmath59 acts in the local frame , the transverse velocity of the boundary of the fireball in the laboratory frame at `` i+1''th time step can then be obtained from its value at `` i''th time step by adding the effect of acceleration relativistically , i.e. , @xmath60 where @xmath61 .    for the thermal quantities in eq .",

    "our results reproduce the experimental data for peripheral and mid - central collisions . for central collisions",
    ", the two - component model overestimates the measured average squared transverse momentum of @xmath2 .",
    "one possible reason for this is that we may have overestimated the diffusion of charm quarks in the fireball .",
    "the number of charm quarks produced in heavy - ion collision is proportional to the number of binary collisions of nucleons , which is more concentrated in the central region of the fireball .",
    "the number of light quarks is , on the other hand , proportional to the number of participants .",
    "since the relative concentration of the number of binary collisions to the number of participants is larger in central collisions than in semi - central or peripheral collisions , charm quarks are initially more concentrated in the central region than light quarks .",
    "if the diffusion of charm quarks is slow , they would remain near the central region even at hadronization and their transverse velocity would then be smaller than those of light quarks .",
    "the elliptic flow @xmath1 of @xmath2 in the two - component model can be different from that of light hadrons as a result of following two effects .",
    "firstly , @xmath2 s are produced from two different mechanisms : the initial hard scattering and the regeneration , while light hadrons are produced only through regeneration .",
    "secondly , the freeze - out temperature for @xmath2 could be different from that of light hadrons .",
    "since initially produced @xmath2 s have transverse momenta that are azimuthally isotropic , they are expected to have vanishing @xmath1 . however , the anisotropic expansion of the fireball could give rise to nonzero @xmath1 for @xmath2 .",
    "in noncentral collisions , the size of the fireball is shorter in the @xmath108-direction than in the @xmath87-direction . as a result",
    ", the survival rate of @xmath2 moving in the @xmath108-direction will be higher than that moving in the @xmath87-direction . in this case",
    ", the @xmath1 of @xmath2 is positive , because the number of @xmath2 moving in the @xmath108-direction is more than that moving in the @xmath87-direction . on the contrary ,",
    "the @xmath1 of regenerated @xmath2 is negative at low @xmath132 for the following reason .",
    "assuming particles are locally thermalized , they then have a thermal distribution in the local frame .",
    "since the thermal distribution is peaked at @xmath178 , where @xmath49 and @xmath179 are the temperature and mass of the particle , respectively , more massive particles thus peak at higher momenta .",
    "if the thermalized matter is boosted with a certain velocity , the peak is shifted to higher momentum in the laboratory frame . in noncentral collisions ,",
    "the difference in the length of the overlapping region in the @xmath108-direction and the @xmath87-direction leads to a difference in the pressure gradient and as a result a difference in fluid velocity along these two directions .",
    "because the length of the overlapping region is shorter in the @xmath108-direction , the fluid velocity is higher and the peak of the momentum distribution is more shifted in that direction . as the peak shifts to higher momentum , the number density at momentum lower than the peak momentum becomes smaller than the number density in the unshifted or less shifted momentum distribution , while the number density at momentum higher than the peak becomes larger . as a result",
    ", the number density of @xmath2 moving in the @xmath108-direction is smaller than that of @xmath2 moving in the @xmath87-direction at small @xmath132 , and this becomes opposite at high @xmath132 , leading thus to a negative @xmath1 .     of @xmath2 for collisions at @xmath131 fm in the two - component model .",
    "the dashed , dotted and solid lines are , respectively , the @xmath1 of initially produced , regenerated and total @xmath2.,width=302 ]    figure  [ v2-jpsi1 ] shows the results from the two - component model for the @xmath1 of initially produced , regenerated and total @xmath2 in au+au collisions at @xmath177 gev and @xmath131 fm .",
    "these results are obtained with the high-@xmath132 correction to the flow velocity as in the case for light hadrons .",
    "it is seen that the @xmath1 of initially produced @xmath2 is essentially zero , whereas the @xmath1 of regenerated @xmath2 has a minimum value of @xmath180 at @xmath181 gev .",
    "the @xmath1 of total @xmath2 is , however , slightly negative , because only 12% of @xmath2 are from regeneration for collisions at @xmath131 fm in the two - component model .",
    "we note that the @xmath1 of @xmath2 has been recently measured by the phenix collaboration for au+au collisions at 20 - 60% centralities @xcite and it has a value of -0.15@xmath970.12 between @xmath182 and @xmath183 gev , which is much much more negative than our value .",
    "in our two - component model , the screening mass between charm quarks and the thermal decay widths of charmonia as well as the relaxation factor of charm quarks in qgp are calculated in pqcd .",
    "specifically , the dissociation cross section of charmonium used for determining its thermal decay width is calculated up to the next - to - leading order , and the elastic cross section of charm quarks for calculating the relaxation factor , and the screening mass are calculated in the leading order . since it is known that pqcd is not reliable up to around @xmath184 , corrections due to higher orders are expected to be important for the temperature regime considered in the present study .",
    "the higher - order correction for the dissociation cross sections of charmonia is expected to suppress the survival rate of charmonia in hot dense nuclear matter while the correction for the relaxation factor of charm quarks would enhance the regeneration of charmonia .",
    "therefore , there could be a balance between the dissociation and the regeneration of charmonia in calculations including higher - order corrections . to include higher - order corrections , we simply introduce in the present study some multiplication factors to the dissociation cross sections of charmonia and to the elastic cross section of charm quarks as following : @xmath185 where @xmath55 and @xmath186 are arbitrary constants .     of @xmath2 as a function of the number of participants with different values of the multiplicative parameteres ( a , b)=(1,1 ) , ( 2,2 ) , ( 5,4 ) and ( 10,6.5 ) for including the effect of higher - order corrections in pqcd .",

    "these results show that higher - order corrections do not change much the value of the @xmath0 of @xmath2 even with a large correction factor of ten .",
    "this is so because of the balance between the dissociation and the regeneration of @xmath2 as mentioned previously , with the suppression of @xmath2 caused by enhanced dissociation compensated by the enhancement of regenerated @xmath2 .",

    ", we note that the kink in the curve is caused by the discontinuity in the survival rate of @xmath2 in the region of the fireball where the temperature is higher than the dissociation temperature and in the region where the temperature is lower than the dissociation temperature .",
