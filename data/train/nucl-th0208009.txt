    "heavy - ion collisions at relativistic energies offer a unique environment for the creation and study of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) phase of nuclear matter . in the collision process",
    "the system may go through a phase transition whereby it evolves from a very hot and dense qgp state to normal hadronic matter .",
    "a characteristic feature of this process is that the system experiences large event - by - event fluctuations in thermodynamic quantities such as temperature , number density etc .",
    "our ability to observe a characteristic fluctuation in various observables , in present day experiments , has been facilitated by the large number of particles produced in the relativistic heavy - ion collisions at the super proton synchrotron ( sps ) and the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) along with the advent of large acceptance detectors at these experiments  @xcite .",
    "the near gaussian distributions of the experimental observables like multiplicity , transverse energy  @xcite , transverse momentum and particle ratios  @xcite have provided an opportunity to relate these quantities to thermodynamical properties of matter , such as specific heat  @xcite and matter compressibility  @xcite .",
    "fluctuations as a signature of quark - hadron phase transition has been experimentally studied extensively but no definite signature has been observed in this sector so far  @xcite .",
    "the main task for using fluctuation as a probe of qgp phase transition would be to identify an observable whose fluctuation will survive from the time of formation of plasma till they get detected after the freeze - out . in this context , it was suggested that the study of the fluctuation in conserved quantities _",
    "e.g. _ net baryon number , net charge or net strangeness will be very useful  @xcite .",
    "the fluctuation in any conserved quantity ( @xmath0 ) is given by  @xcite @xmath1 where , @xmath2 is the associated chemical potential and @xmath3 is the temperature of the system under consideration . here",
    "@xmath4 represents the mean value of the conserved quantity over a large number of events and @xmath5 denotes the deviation of its value from the mean , event - by - event .",
    "it has been shown that the fluctuation in these conserved quantities with and without qgp formation are very different .",
    "hence , study of fluctuations in these conserved quantities can be a good signature of transition from confined to de - confined state of matter .",
    "however , in the earlier calculations  @xcite ideal gas eos for both the qgp and hadronic gas was considered . for the qgp initial state ,",
    "the evolution of fluctuation during mixed phase have also not been taken into account .",
    "finally , modifications of hadronic spectral functions in the thermal bath was ignored .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the evolution of the fluctuation in conserved quantities from time of formation to the time of detection .",
    "in addition to the qgp and hadronic initial state we consider an important case where the hadrons are formed at the initial stage but the spectral function of the hadrons are different from their vacuum properties .",
    "we also discuss the sensitivity of the results on different eos . here",
    "we concentrate only on the net baryon number fluctuation and the results are presented in terms of the experimentally measured quantity , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the number of baryons and @xmath8 is the fluctuation in the net baryon number .    the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we discuss the possible evolution scenarios .",
    "then the initial conditions used for solving the evolution equations for various evolution scenarios are presented in section iii . in section",
    "iv we study the evolution of the system .",
    "section v and vi is devoted for the results at the freeze - out for sps and rhic energies respectively . and",
    "finally in section vii we present the summary and conclusions .",
    "we consider the following three possible evolution scenarios .    1 .   : the system starts evolving from an initial qgp state formed at a time @xmath9 and temperature @xmath10 .",
    "it then expands , hence cools and reaches the critical temperature @xmath11 at a time @xmath12 . in the mixed phase the cooling due to expansion",
    "is compensated by the heating of the system due to the liberation of the latent heat in a first order phase transition .",
    "hence the temperature remains constant at @xmath11 ( super - cooling is neglected here ) .",
    "after the mixed phase ends at a time @xmath13 , further expansion takes place and finally the system disassembles at a time @xmath14 and temperature @xmath15 . at this stage ,",
    "called the freeze - out stage , the mean free path of the particles are too large to have any further interactions , and those are detected experimentally .",
    "the hot and dense system is formed in the hadronic state at a time @xmath9 and temperature @xmath16 and the system expands from the initial to freeze - out state ( at time @xmath14 when the temperature is @xmath15 ) without a phase transition .",
    ": the other possibility is that the system may form in the hadronic state as in ( 2 ) above , but the spectral function of the hadrons are different from their vacuum counterparts . among others ,",
    "in the present case we will consider the shift of the pole of the hadronic spectral function according to the universal scaling law proposed by brown and rho  @xcite : @xmath17 where @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) is the in - medium ( vacuum ) mass of the hadrons ( except pseudo - scalar ) and the index @xmath20 takes a value between 0 and 1 .",

    "for example the above ratio is 3.6 ( 7.5 ) for 140 mev pions ( 938 mev protons ) at a temperature of 200 mev .",
