    "as a new paradigm of mitigating interference , interference alignment ( ia ) has attracted increasing attentions @xcite . in ia , the transmitters utilize the channel state knowledge to precode their signaling vectors .",
    "the aim of this precoding is that at each receiver , interfering signals are purposely aligned in a minimized signal subspace , while the desired signals independent of interference signals are delivered in a maximized signal subspace . to implement the ia technique in practical systems ,",
    "the major challenge is the need of the perfect , and sometimes global , channel state information at the transmitters ( csit ) .",
    "it is recently shown @xcite that the restricted condition of perfect csit can be relaxed if the coherent blocks of the receivers display certain heterogeneous patterns .",
    "consider the example of a @xmath5-user @xmath6 multiple - input single - output ( miso ) broadcasting ( bc ) channel , in which one base station with @xmath7 transmit antennas broadcasts information data to @xmath8 single - antenna users .",
    "if the coherent time @xmath9 experienced by one user is a multiple of the coherent time @xmath10 experienced by the other user , forming a specially staggered pattern , the outer bound value of @xmath2 degrees of freedom ( dof ) is attainable by interference alignment with no csit .",
    "the interference alignment without csit is also referred to as _ blind interference alignment _",
    "( bia ) . in order to obtain the staggered channel pattern which is amiable to bia , jafar _",
    "_ @xcite propose to mount a configurable multi - mode antenna at each user , and artificially manipulate the channel state to construct a similar heterogeneous block fading channel by switching the antenna mode at some / all users .    in this paper , instead of applying complex receivers or presuming the heterogeneous block fading channel model",
    ", we study a @xmath1 bc channel with @xmath11 users which follow the same temporal correlated fading model and thus have the same coherent time . to distinguish the heterogeneous block fading channel where @xmath12",
    ", we refer to this channel as _ homogeneous _ block fading model . for the homogeneous bc channel with @xmath13",
    ", we propose a scheme to achieve the optimal @xmath2 dof by using bia .",
    "our analysis further shows that in this homogeneous bc channel , if @xmath14 , the chance is larger than @xmath15 that the base station find two mobile users to form a 2-user @xmath1 miso bc channel , and the formed channel can achieve the optimal @xmath2 dof by using bia . when @xmath16 , the chance is almost one .",
    "consider a @xmath0-user @xmath1 miso bc channel which consists of a two - antenna transmitter and two single - antenna receivers . referring to fig .",
    "[ fig : system.model ] , let @xmath17 , @xmath18 , denote the channel coefficient linking the transmit antenna @xmath19 to the receiver @xmath20 . further define the coefficient vector @xmath21^{t}$ ] for @xmath20 , where @xmath22 is the discrete - time index .",

    ", we consider the bc channel with @xmath26 , referred to as homogeneous block fading . without loss of generality ,",
    "let @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "so , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : system.model ] , the constant coefficient during a coherent block gives @xmath29 for all @xmath30 and @xmath31 ; @xmath32 for @xmath33 , and @xmath34 for all @xmath30 and @xmath35 .",
    "it is known that the optimal achievable dof , also known as multiplexing gain , is @xmath2 for @xmath0-user @xmath1 miso bc channels @xcite .",
    "the interference alignment approach achieving the optimal dof by using symbol extension is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : ia.x.chnl ] . in this figure , given three arbitrary time slots @xmath36  they are not necessary to be consecutive  as well as the corresponding channel coefficients    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     .",
    "+    naturally , by using this construction method the pairs in @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 can form @xmath40 type-@xmath41 pattern blocks .    similarly ,",
    "three sets with @xmath42 pairs each can be collected , i.e. , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure : proof.thm01 ] . the same constructive procedure over the three sets can generate @xmath42 type-@xmath41 pattern blocks . repeating the same approach , we group three sets with @xmath46 pairs each as @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 ; three sets with @xmath42 pairs each as @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the constructive procedure will generate @xmath53 and @xmath42 type-@xmath41 pattern blocks from @xmath54s and @xmath55s , respectively .",
    "the channel from @xmath37 to @xmath52 forms a block of @xmath56 symbols , and the channel pattern of the @xmath56 symbols repeats over time .",
    "every such a @xmath56-symbol block can be decomposed into @xmath57 type-@xmath41 pattern blocks as described previously . therefore",
    ", the channel with @xmath58 can be decomposed into type-@xmath41 pattern blocks , and thus achieves the optimal @xmath2 dof by applying bia to each type-@xmath41 pattern block .",
    "according to theorem 1 , the coherent block offset @xmath58 between two receivers is sufficient for bia to achieve the optimal dof . in practice ,",
    "the channel coefficients within a coherent block are not exactly the same , but only highly correlated @xcite .",
    "there is no unique way to divide a block fading channel into coherent blocks over time .",
    "if the two users experience the same temporal correlated block fading , we can always divide the link of the second user into coherent blocks by selecting a @xmath59 satisfying @xmath58 .",
    "therefore , in practical systems a @xmath0-user @xmath1 miso bc channel with homogeneous block fading can obtain the optimal @xmath2 dof by bia .",
    "note that each true channel coefficient in a coherent block can be decoupled into the constant channel efficient characterizing the block plus a distortion .",
    "how the distortion affects the achieved dof is interesting but beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "physically , it is justified to model @xmath59 as a uniformly distributed random variable over @xmath60 .",
    "then the chance for such a 2-user channel to achieve @xmath2 dof by bia is @xmath61 .",
    "now , consider a @xmath1 bc network with @xmath62 mobile users experiencing homogeneous block fading .",
    "suppose the time offset of the link for @xmath20 ( @xmath63 ) is uniformly distributed over @xmath64 , with respect to @xmath27 .",
    "now , we examine _ how big the chance is that the @xmath0-antenna transmitter can find two users among the @xmath3 users to form a 2-user miso bc channel which is able to achieve the optimal dof @xmath2 by using bia_. we first present a lemma .",
    "[ lm1 ] suppose there are @xmath57 boxes forming a ring .",
    "cast a ball into one box and denote the box as the @xmath65th box , then cast other @xmath66 balls randomly into the @xmath57 boxes . define the distance of any two balls as the smallest number of boxes separating them along the ring .",
    "let @xmath67 be the number of the events in which the distance of any pair of balls is less than @xmath68 . then @xmath69 with @xmath70 .",
    "starting from the @xmath65th box , we clockwise number the boxes by integers in ascending order , until the @xmath71th box is reached .",
    "in addition , still from the @xmath65th box , we counter - clockwise label the boxes by decreasing integers , until the label @xmath72 is reached .",
    "we first count the events in which the distance between two ends of the shortest arc of boxes containing all the @xmath3 balls is @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) . given the @xmath65th box being one end",
    ", the other end could be either the @xmath73th box or the @xmath75th box , the next @xmath76 balls can be randomly assigned to the boxes between the @xmath65th box and the other end box , resulting in totally @xmath77 events .",
    "if the @xmath78th box ( @xmath79 ) is one end , then the other end is determined to be the @xmath80th box , the other @xmath81 balls ( note that the @xmath65th box already has one ball ) can be assigned in @xmath82 ways , and thus the number of events with such two ends are @xmath83 . totally the number of the events with two ends distanced by @xmath73 is @xmath84 .    by summing the number over @xmath85 and adding one event in which all balls are in the @xmath65th box",
    ", we obtain the total number of events in which any two balls are distanced by less than @xmath86 @xmath87 which proves this lemma .    from the lemma",
    "above , we can prove the following theorem .    given the @xmath1 bc network with @xmath3 users ,",
    "let @xmath88 be the probability that the transmitter finds two users among the @xmath3 users to form a 2-user @xmath1 miso bc channel which can achieve the optimal dof @xmath2 by using bia .",
    "then @xmath89    let @xmath90 be the relative time offset between the user @xmath78 and the user @xmath91 .",
    "distributing @xmath25 ( @xmath63 ) over @xmath64 uniformly is equivalent to casting @xmath66 balls uniformly into the ring of @xmath57 boxes .",
    "furthermore , the event of @xmath92 for all @xmath93 is equivalent to the event in which any two balls among @xmath3 balls in lemma [ lm1 ] are distanced less than @xmath94 .",
    "therefore , the probability that @xmath95 for all @xmath93 is @xmath96 .",
    "so , the probability that there exists @xmath97 for some @xmath93 , that is , the transmitter and the users @xmath78 and @xmath91 form a miso bc channel achieving @xmath2 dof by bia , is @xmath98 .",
    "finally , substituting into @xmath88 proves the inequality .",
    "as a function of user number @xmath3 . ]    the lower bound of @xmath88 in is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : lb.pnk ] as a function of @xmath3 for @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 .",
    "it is observed the probability of finding 2 users among @xmath102 users to facilitate bia is @xmath103 for all @xmath104 .",
    "the chance of finding such two users among @xmath16 users is almost one .",
    "it is also notable that the lower bound is not sensitive to @xmath57 when @xmath104 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that regardless of the coherent time experienced by @xmath3 homogeneous users , if @xmath4 , it is almost guaranteed that the two - antenna transmitter can find two users among the @xmath3 users to form a bia - favored 2-user @xmath1 miso bc channel .    in summary , this paper shows that in a practical @xmath0-user @xmath1 miso bc channel with homogeneous block fading , interference alignment can achieve the optimal @xmath2 dof without the need of csit . under the assumption that the coherent blocks of @xmath11 homogeneous single - antenna users are randomly offset with uniform distribution",
