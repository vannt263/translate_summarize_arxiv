    "we consider the random forced burgers equation @xmath1 that describes weak 1d acoustic perturbations in the reference frame moving with the sound velocity @xcite .",
    "the external force @xmath2 in this frame is generally short - correlated in time , so let us assume that @xmath3 then the statistics of @xmath2 can be thought gaussian and therefore is completely characterized by ( [ phipc ] ) .",
    "we are interested in turbulence with a large value of reynolds number @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the characteristic scale of the stirring force correlator @xmath6 .",
    "this problem was intensively studied during the last years @xcite .",
    "the main feature of burgers turbulence is the formation of shock waves with large negative velocity gradient inside and small viscous width of the front .",
    "the positive velocity gradients are decreased by the dynamics of burgers equation due to self - advection of velocity . on the contrary the increasing of negative gradients",
    "could be stopped only by viscosity .",
    "the motion of shock waves leads to a strong intermittency , the pdf of velocity gradients @xmath7 is strongly non - gaussian .",
    "the one way to describe the intermittency is to study rare events with large fluctuations of velocity , that give the main contribution to the high momenta @xmath8 or to the pdf tails .",
    "the right tail ( positive large @xmath9 ) of pdf @xmath10 was first found by feigelman @xcite for the problem of charge density wave in an impurity potential .",
    "later it was recovered using operator product expansion @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , instanton calculus @xcite , minimizers approach @xcite and mapping closure @xcite .",
    "the left tail in the inviscid limit seems to be algebraic , probably @xmath11 .",
    "the large negative gradients exist practically only inside the shock waves .",
    "the maximal value of gradient is proportional to the square of the velocity jump on the shock wave : @xmath12 .",
    "then roughly the tail of the shock wave amplitude pdf has the form @xmath13 .",
    "the analysis of the instanton structure predicts the value @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "this prediction is consistent with the assumption , that the tails of @xmath15 should not depend on the viscousity @xmath16 .",

    "the probability @xmath19 decays very fast while @xmath21 increases , i.e. the contribution of events with gradient greater than @xmath21 somewhere is highly suppressed .",

    "also should be large , and the probability of such fluctuation @xmath2 is low .",
    "the weight @xmath26 $ ] may not contain a large parameter , but it should have fast tails , e.g. exponential ones .",
    "then the concurrence between statistical weight and the value of calculated quantity makes the contributing realizations of @xmath27 rather determined .",
    "this approach was introduced by lifshitz @xcite .",
    "later it was applyed to determine high order correlation functions in field theory @xcite and in the systems of hydrodynamic type : simultaneous ( see , e.g. @xcite ) and non - simultaneous @xcite ones .",

    "the asymptotics of @xmath19 at large @xmath36 is determined by the saddle - point configuration of fields @xmath18 , @xmath37 ( and also parameter @xmath31 ) , near which the variation of the integrand is equal to zero @xcite .",
    "the saddle - point configuration ( sometimes called classical trajectory or instanton ) is governed by the following equations @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the convolution @xmath40 the solution should satisfy boundary conditions @xmath41 the value of @xmath31 is tuned in such a way that the condition @xmath20 holds .",

    "the instanton equations ( [ ie1],[ie2 ] ) are hamiltonian : @xmath63 the hamiltonian @xmath64 is the integral of motion , i.e. @xmath65 . since both @xmath66 and @xmath67 tend to zero at @xmath68 we have @xmath69 . from the instanton equations and the condition",

    "its contribution to the action is of the same order as other terms . if @xmath74 is a powerlike function : @xmath75 , then one has @xmath76 .",
    "the high momenta can be calculated by the instanton method in a following way .",
    "because @xmath77 is a narrow function for large @xmath78 , and only narrow velocity interval , which position depends on @xmath78 , contributes to @xmath79 .",
    "the position of this interval is exactly the saddle - point in the integral @xmath80 ( see ( [ lnps ] ) ) , that satisfies the equation @xmath81 combining it with @xmath82 we again get ( [ fsa ] ) . to get the instanton equations for the average @xmath79 one should only substitute @xmath31 in ( [ ie2 ] ) for @xmath83 .",
    "then the instanton equations become the same as in @xcite .",
    "one also should consider fluctuations near the instanton as a background .",
    "the way how the fluctuations can be taken into account is unknown yet but their influence to @xmath74 due to their phase volume is small in comparison with @xmath84 while @xmath85 . at smaller gradients",
