    "the visibility of pulsar emission is a geometric problem : to identify the `` visible point '' in the pulsar magnetosphere that an observer can see . a standard model for pulsar visibility",
    "is based on three assumptions : ( i ) at the source , the emission is confined to a narrow beam around the direction tangent to the local magnetic field line , ( ii ) the magnetic field is dipolar , and ( iii ) emission occurs only within the open - field region .",
    "let the visible point be described by its spherical polar coordinates , @xmath2 relative to the rotation axis , or @xmath3 relative to the magnetic axis .",
    "two angles are assumed to be given for a pulsar : the obliquity angle , @xmath4 , between the magnetic axis and the rotation axis , and the viewing angle , @xmath5 , between the line of sight and the rotation axis .",
    "the height of the emission point , described by the radial distance @xmath1 , is not well determined , and one considers the location of the visible point on a sphere of radius @xmath1 .",
    "the geometric problem is to determine the visible point in terms of @xmath6 or @xmath7 for given @xmath8 as a function of rotational phase , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the angular speed of rotation .",
    "it is not widely recognized that two different geometric models are used for different purposes .",
    "we refer to these as the rvm ( rotating vector model ) and the tangent model .",
    "the rvm was used by @xcite to identify the s - shaped swing in the position angle ( pa ) of the plane of linear polarization , and the rvm continues to be used for this purpose . in the rvm the line of sight",
    "is assumed to pass through the center of the star , and the visible point is identified as its intersection with the sphere of radius @xmath1 .",
    "the rvm should be regarded as an approximation to the standard model because the fixed line of sight through the center of the star is not tangent to the field line ( with the exception of the special case where the line of sight also intersects the magnetic pole ) .",
    "the tangent model , which was analyzed by @xcite , is exact in the sense that the line of sight varies so that it is always tangent to the field line .",
    "the error introduced by use of the rvm may be understood as follows .",
    "for an observer at infinity , @xmath5 specifies a direction , and hence an infinite set of parallel lines .",
    "one of these lines , the one that passes through the center of the star , is chosen in the rvm , and another of these lines , the one that instantaneously satisfies ( i ) , is chosen in the tangent model . as the pulsar rotates , the line in the rvm remains fixed , implying that the visible point is stationary ( fixed @xmath6 ) . in the tangent model , the line through the visible point changes with @xmath0 .",
    "the path on the sphere is the trajectory , described by @xmath6 as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "compared with the tangent model , the rvm introduces an angular error .",
    "one estimate of this error is the angle between the magnetic field line and the radial vector ( the assumed line of sight in the rvm ) at the emission point : the rvm is valid only to zeroth order in an expansion in this angle.\\approx\\theta_b/2 $ ] for @xmath11 . ]",
    "another estimate of the angular error introduced is @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the perpendicular displacement between the lines to the observer in the two models .",
    "the rvm also introduces a conceptual error : that the visible point is fixed . in the tangent model , the visible point moves , and its motion defines a trajectory on the sphere of radius @xmath1 .",
    "our main purpose of this paper is to discuss the implications , for the interpretation of pulsar radio emission , of the existence of this trajectory and the motion of the visible point around it .",
    "( note that neither the trajectory nor the associated motion around it exists in the rvm . ) besides application to conventional observations ( duty cycle , interpulse , drifting subpulses , swing of pa ) , a new possibility is direct measurement of the motion of the visible point .",
    "recent detection of motion with sub - nano - arcsecond accuracy using interstellar holography @xcite shows that this is a realistic possibility .",
    "these authors claim that the `` direct observable is the apparent motion of the emission region as a function of pulse phase . ''",
    "this ( plausibly ) corresponds to a direct measurement of the velocity of the visible point , projected along scattering axis .",

    "the pa change illustrated by curve iii in figure  [ fig - pa_three ] is similar to that observed from psr j0738 - 4042 and psr j1243 - 6423 @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of pa curves suggests that effects other than geometry alone can be significant : ` reversed ' pa curves indicate that pulsars rotate in the direction opposite to that we assume , and other unusual pa curves may be an indication of non - dipolar field structure , small scale distortions in the open - field region , or interstellar scattering effects @xcite .      in the rvm",
    "the pa swing is calculated based on the path of the line of sight through the center of the star as the open - field region sweeps across it @xcite .",
    "an example of the path implied by the rvm is the red curve in figure [ fig - viewgeo_d ] , which is clearly different from the trajectory in the tangent model , shown by the black curve .",
    "further examples showing the difference between the two models are illustrated by the red and black curves , for two different choices of parameters , in figure [ fig - twotrajs ] .",

    "the criterion for emission to be visible is that the line of sight , which is independent of @xmath1 in both models , intersects the open - field region , which broadens with increasing @xmath1 . in both models there",
    "is a minimum visible height , at which the line of sight intersects the boundary of the open - field region . above this height",
    ", there is a range of @xmath0 for which emission is visible . in figure [ fig - varyemheights ]",
    "we fix this height at a specific value , @xmath113 , so that this corresponds to the emission height at the two extrema in @xmath0 that define the edges of the pulse window . for @xmath0 between these extrema emission",
    "is visible from a range of heights @xmath114 with this range increasing to a maximum at @xmath46 , midway between the edges .",
    "figure [ fig - varyemheights ] compares the pulse window and the range of visible heights within the window for this particular example .",
    "the most obvious feature is that the rvm underestimates the size of the pulse window , compared with the tangent model .",
    "how significant is the error introduced by using the rvm to determine the swing in pa ? to answer this question",
    "we calculate the swing in pa for both models with given values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the results are shown in figures [ fig - trajpa1 ] - [ fig - trajpa4 ] .",
    "the error introduced is small near @xmath46 , and indeed so small that we need to displace the curves , by @xmath115 , in order to distinguish between the two models .",
    "one can conclude that the rvm is an excellent approximation for the purposes of calculating the pa swing , provided that the pulsar has a narrow pulse window .",
    "the difference in the pa curves between the two models increases as the pulse window increases .",
    "the range of @xmath0 predicted by the rvm is narrower than that predicted by the tangent model , and this difference can be substantial for a broad pulse .",
    "the largest difference between the two models occurs for large @xmath102 .    in summary ,",
    "the error introduced by assuming that the line of sight passes through the origin include an underestimation of the height of emission , and hence either to an overestimation of @xmath4 , for @xmath110 , or to an underestimation of @xmath4 , for @xmath116 .",
    "the integrated pulse profiles of some pulsars show an interpulse ( ip ) , which is separated from the main pulse by approximately half the rotation period .",
    "similar to main pulses , interpulses may also exhibit such phenomena as mode - changing , pulse - to - pulse intensity modulation and subpulse drifting @xcite . assuming that the emission mechanism for the near and far magnetic poles is the same and both are actively radiating",
    ", the conditions that determine the visibility for the near magnetic pole also apply to visible emission from the far ( opposite ) pole .",
    "the analytic solution in section  [ sect : trajectory ] involves solving a quartic equation , and there are four solutions .",
    "two of the solutions correspond to emission in the observer s hemisphere , and the condition for an interpulse is that both be visible .",
    "( the other two solutions correspond to emission in the opposite hemisphere to the observer and are of no interest . )",
    "the visibility conditions for an interpulse are that a portion of the trajectory of the visible point near the far pole is within the open field region , and that this occurs above the minimum visible height , @xmath117 .",
    "figures [ fig - vis_mpip_z10 ]  [ fig - vis_mpip_z90 ] apply in the special case @xmath46 , when the magnetic axis , the rotation axis and the line of sight are in the same plane .",
    "these figures show the variations in @xmath74 and @xmath117 , where ip refers to interpulse , as predicted in both the rvm and the tangent model as function of @xmath4 for three values of @xmath5 .",
    "two emission heights are selected , at @xmath118 and @xmath119 , with the range of @xmath120 from which emission is visible restricted to between the curves , which are symmetric about the horizontal axis .",
    "three features are apparent from figures [ fig - vis_mpip_z10 ]  [ fig - vis_mpip_z90 ] .",
    "first , the far pole is visible only for large @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and large heights .",
    "second , from figure  [ fig - vis_mpip_z90 ] one infers that the rvm underestimates the range of @xmath121 over which the far pole is visible .",
    "third , from figure  [ fig - vis_mpip_z10 ] it is evident that the rvm incorrectly predicts a range of small @xmath4 and @xmath5 where the far pole is visible .",
    "these differences illustrate the errors that can be introduced by using the rvm away from @xmath122 , where the error is small .     for @xmath61 when looking down from the rotation axis showing the dipolar structure for @xmath123 .",
    "the tangent model for the visibility of pulsar radio emission @xcite is widely accepted , but its implications are not widely recognized . the tangent model is inconsistent with the earlier rvm , which continues to be used , especially in connection with the swing of pa . in this paper",
    ", we use an analytic solution for the tangent model to demonstrate some of its implications , and to compare the predictions based on it with predictions based on the rvm . before summarizing our results in dot - point form ,",
    "we comment on limitations on the tangent model in the form assumed here .",
    "the tangent model we explore neglects many physical effects , with the most important being retardation and aberration @xcite .",
    "the exact solution for a rotating magnetic dipole includes the dipolar term , @xmath15 , which is the only term we retain , and the inductive ( @xmath124 ) and radiative ( @xmath125 ) terms ( collectively the retarded terms ) that we ignore .",
    "inclusion of the retarded terms leads to well - known distortions in the field @xcite , compared with the dipolar term .",
    "the distortions are a strong function of @xmath4 ( being absent for @xmath57 ) , and we illustrate their magnitude by plotting , in figure  [ fig - flsa90_ind2 ] , some of the exact field lines for the special case of @xmath48 . based on our calculations , and on the work of others , e.g. , @xcite , we estimate that these distortions are relatively unimportant for @xmath123 . an exact analytic solution for the trajectory",
    "is not feasible when the retarded terms are included .",
    "it is possible to complement the exact solution for a dipolar field by a perturbation approach to include the effects of retardation .",
    "for example , @xcite included retardation effects as a perturbations to the rvm .",
    "the perturbations should be applied to the tangent model , and not to the rvm , but we do not do so here . similarly , other field line distortions , the finite size of the emission cone and aberration may be included as perturbation corrections to the exact solution . again , such perturbations should be applied to the exact solution , and not to the rvm .      *",
    "the older model for the visibility of pulsar radio emission @xcite is incompatible with the widely accepted model @xcite in which radiation is beamed along the magnetic field line at the point of emission .",
    "we refer to the two models as the rvm and the tangent model , respectively . *",
    "the tangent model ( but not the rvm ) implies that the visible point moves around a trajectory as the pulsar rotates .",
    "the size of the trajectory and the speed of the motion of the visible point around it depend on @xmath4 and @xmath5 . *",
    "the requirement that emission come only from open field lines sets a minimum height for visible emission , and this is different in the two models . *",
    "the geometry alone strongly favors visible radio emission being originating at a heights more than ten percent of the light - cylinder distance .",
    "* the size of the pulse window is different in the two models , with the rvm typically underestimating the range of @xmath0 for which emission is visible .",
    "* the errors introduced by using the rvm are particularly notable when considering the visibility of the opposite pole , and hence of an interpulse .",
    "* the swing of pa is similar in the two models provided the pulse window is narrow , but the rvm becomes increasingly unreliable as the size of the pulse window increases .",
