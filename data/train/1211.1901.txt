    "giving a general definition of what homogenization is is difficult , because of the various meanings attached to it .",
    "the physics at stake is the situation when a wave illuminates a complicated object , generally consisting of a periodic set of scatterers , contained in some domain @xmath0 and gives rise to a diffracted field @xmath1 . loosely speaking ,",
    "the homogenization problem consists in identifying _",
    "homogeneous _ constitutive relations such that the same domain @xmath0 inside which these constitutive relations hold , leads to a diffracted field @xmath2 such that @xmath1 and @xmath3 are close to each other , in some meaning to be specified .",
    "this can be done reasonably only if the wavelength @xmath4 is larger than the period @xmath5 .",
    "this identifies a small parameter @xmath6",
    ".    having been educated by mathematicians , the definition that i would consider the best one is the following : consider a partial differential equation @xmath7 with oscillating coefficients @xmath8 .",
    "consider a solution @xmath9 of the equation : @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is some convenient source term .",
    "then the goal of homogenization theory is to find a convenient topology in which @xmath9 converges to a function @xmath12 satisfying an equation : @xmath13 .",
    "the operator @xmath14 is called the homogenized operator @xcite .",
    "this definition is quite clear and at the end , it leads to results such as : `` when @xmath15 tends to @xmath16 , @xmath9 tends to @xmath12 in some specific meaning '' .",
    "the point of being able to specify a convergence is very interesting , in that it gives a clear meaning to the question `` how close are @xmath1 and @xmath3 ? '' .    in the metamaterials community , it is not rare that the notion of parameters extraction be used as a homogenization scheme @xcite .",
    "in that situation the structure is considered a black box ( or rather a black slab ! ) .",
    "this pragmatic approach , although it might be useful , can not be considered a homogenization procedure .",
    "sometimes the bloch spectrum is used as well .",
    "however , care should be taken because of the following result :    given any isofrequency dispersion curves given implicitly in the form @xmath17 , there exists a spatially and temporally dispersive permittivity @xmath18 reproducing these curves .",
    "write : @xmath19 and define : @xmath20 , where @xmath21 .",
    "this shows that given any dispersion curves , it is always possible to reproduce it by using a spatially dispersive permittivity .",
    "however , nothing can be said on the complete electromagnetic field inside the medium : the bloch diagram only accounts for the plane wave part of the field .",
    "the introduction of spatial dispersion should only be made with great care @xcite .",
    "sketch of the structure under study .",
    "it is made of a stack of gratings , each consisting of periodically disposed scatterers.,height=226 ]    in the following , the structure considered as a model problem is a periodic set of 2d scatterers ( cf . fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) ) .",
    "the medium is infinite in the @xmath22 direction and it is made out of a stack of basic layers made of an infinite number of rods periodically disposed at points @xmath23 .    in the following ,",
    "three different points of view are given on the homogenization of this structure : multiple scattering , double - scale , micro - local .",
    "the approach proposed here is reminiscent of that in @xcite , although it is rather different because here no averaged field is defined . it would be interesting to make a connection between these two approaches .",
    "+ our point is to describe the electromagnetic behavior of one line of scatterer ( a grating ) alone .",
    "each scatterer `` n '' is characterized by a scattering coefficient @xmath24 . when it is illuminated by an incident field @xmath25 ,",
    "it gives rise to a field @xmath26 where @xmath27 .",
    "for the infinite set of scatterers , this gives a diffracted field that reads : u^s=_n b_n h_0(k_0|r - r_n| ) the field diffracted by the n@xmath28 scatterer is obtained by writing that it is the response to the incident field @xmath25 and the field difffracted by the other scatterers : b_n = s_0 ( e^i(n)+_m n b_m h_0(k_0|m - n|d ) ) if the incident field is pseudo - periodic , i.e. @xmath29 , then it holds : b_0= the series that enters this relation can be written : @xmath30 an asymptotic analysis of this series @xcite allows to write the following expansion :    _ n>0 ( + - ) = o[(k_0d)^2 ]    above the grating , the propagative part of the electric field reads as : @xmath31 and below it reads @xmath32 where : @xmath33 and @xmath34    energy conservation implies that : @xmath35 and therefore the following representation holds :    there exists a real function @xmath36 such that : @xmath37    energy conservation shows that : @xmath38 , the theorem follows by defining : @xmath39 .    for the propagative part of the field , the grating is equivalent to an infinitely thin slab whose transfer matrix is : t_g= (    cc 1 & 0 + & 1    ) where @xmath40 .",
    "when the ratio @xmath41 is very small , it holds : @xmath42    the electric field is continuous , the matrix @xmath43 is obtained by computing the jump of the normal derivative of the field : @xmath44 . using proposition 1 , we get : @xmath45 . hence : @xmath46 .",
    "a layer of the structure can thus be described by this slab surrounded by homogeneous layers of height @xmath47 , the transfer matrix of this basic sandwich structure ( cf .",
    "( [ fig2 ] ) ) being : @xmath48 , where : t(h/2)= (    cc ( _ 0 h/2 ) & ( _ 0 h/2)/_0 + -_0 ( _ 0 h/2 ) & ( _ 0 h/2 )    ) a simple calculation shows that : t= (    cc ( _ 0 h ) + & + + - _ 0 ( _ 0 h ) & ( _ 0 h ) +    ) the transfer matrix is known to be an unstable object for numerical purposes .",
    "the preferred quantity is the scattering matrix @xcite .",
    "therefore , the homogenization is now performed numerically by searching for a permittivity @xmath49 such that the scattering matrix of a homogeneous slab with this permittivity fits that of the sandwich structure .",
    "specifically , the cost function is : @xmath50=|r_{g}-r_{\\rm eff}|^2+|t_g - t_{\\rm eff}|^2\\ ] ] where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the reflection and transmission coefficients of the sandwich structure and @xmath53 that of the homogeneous slab .     the homogenization of the sandwich structure .",
    "the horizontal black line represents the grating.,height=226 ]      first the scatterer in the basic cell is a dielectric rod with permittivity @xmath54 and radius @xmath55 , i.e. the rods are touching . in that case , the low - frequency behavior is well - known : the sandwich structure is equivalent to a homogeneous slab with permittivity : @xmath56 .     the reflection spectrum for the homogenized structure ( dashed ) and the sandwich structure ( continuous ) .,height=226 ]    this serves to test the proposed approach and also to evaluate the spatial dispersion effect in the medium .",
    "the reflection spectra for a plane wave in normal incidence and for both the sandwich structure and the homogeneous slab are given in fig .",
    "( [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "it can be shown that the homogenization works very well for @xmath57 .",
    "the resulting homogenized permittivity , depending on both the frequency and the horizontal bloch vector , is given in fig.([fig4 ] ) .",
    "the averaged value is @xmath58 .",
    "the value obtained numerically for @xmath59 is : @xmath60 .",
    "the homogenized permittivity was calculated for two angles of incidence @xmath16 and @xmath61 : it can be seen that the effects of spatial dispersion are quite small .",

    "the continuous curve corresponds to @xmath62 and the dashed one to @xmath63 .",

    ", height=226 ]    second , we choose a resonant scatterer with a scattering coefficient of the form @xmath65 where @xmath66 is regular and satisfy @xmath67 as @xmath68 .",
    "this pole - and - zero form is quite a common one .",
    "the sandwich structure air - grating - air can be replaced by a slab with permittivity @xmath69 obtained from the optimisation procedure described above .",
    "the effective permittivity obtained by using the cost function ( [ opt ] ) for a grating of resonant scatterers with scattering coefficient given by ( [ polo]).,height=226 ]    the reflection spectrum is given in fig .",
    "( [ fig5 ] ) , the homogenization procedure works very well for @xmath70 .",
    "the effective permittivity obtained by using the cost function ( [ opt ] ) .,height=226 ]    the corresponding homogenized permittivity is given in fig.([fig6 ] ) .",
    "the spatial dispersion effects are negligible in that situation .",
    "interestingly , it seems that resonant structures can be homogenized at smaller ratio @xmath71 than non resonant ones .",
    "in this section , a homogenization approach inspired by @xcite is given .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , the theory is specialized to the helmholtz equation : @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the dielectric function of the structure in fig.([fig1 ] ) .",
    "let us define by @xmath74 the operator such that : @xmath75 .",
    "it is a pseudo - differential operator @xcite whose symbol is denoted @xmath76 .",
    "the following form of @xmath77 holds : @xmath78 the symbol is the response of the system for a plane wave source .",
    "it can be shown that it has an expansion in terms of the bloch spectrum @xcite : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is such that : @xmath81 is periodic and @xmath82 .",
    "+ let us now consider the periodic medium with basic cell @xmath83 .",
    "the polarization field is : @xmath84 .",
    "define the average field through : @xmath85 and the average of the polarization field : @xmath86 the effective permittivity is then @xmath87 , that is : @xmath88 it is interesting to note that the expression above is regular whatever @xmath89 , despite the fact that the symbol has poles . in the very low frequency domain ,",
    "one obviously has : @xmath90    this approach could probably be made better by using a multiple scale expansion of the symbol in the form : @xmath91 .",
    "besides , it would also be interesting to recover the classical homogenization results for the case of a magnetic field linearly polarized along the wires .",
    "work is in progress in that direction .",
    "this final approach is largely used in the mathematical community @xcite , also it is practically ignored by physicists @xcite . by its very definition ,",
    "it is the only one that can give a clear meaning to the notion of convergence of the fields .",
    "i will only give a sketch in a well - known situation , but i will give a new framework by using differential forms @xcite , because the structure of the theory is very nice then .",
    "maxwell equations are written by using differential forms : d e^=i _0 h^ , d h^=-i _ e^ where @xmath5 denotes the exterior derivative , @xmath92 and @xmath93 are 1-forms ( obtained from the usual vector fields by means of the @xmath94 operator and a flat metric @xcite ) and @xmath95 stands for the hodge operator .",
    "the starting point is to assume the following expansions for @xmath96 and @xmath97 : @xmath98 where the fields @xmath99 depend upon two sets of variables @xmath100 .",
    "this can be justified in the framework of double - scale convergence @xcite but this would take us to far",
    ".    there is a nice mathematical structure linked to the multiscale expansion .",
    "the projection : : e_0(x , y ) _ y e_0(x ,",
    "y ) dy defines a fiber bundle .",
    "where the fiber is the cotangent bundle to the flat torus : @xmath101 and the base is the cotangent bundle to the ambient space : @xmath102.its trivialization is as follows : ^-1(u ) ~f where @xmath103 is an open neighborhood in the base .",
    "the @xmath104 variable plays the role of a hidden variable that accounts for the microscopic behavior inside the basic cell .",
    "the expansion ( [ 2scale ] ) induces the following splitting of operator @xmath5 : @xmath105 .",
    "we arrive directly at the systems satisfied by the microscopic fields , holding on @xmath83 : @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the exterior co - derivative .",
    "the first system involves the electric field alone and is of purely electrostatic nature . because the limit field only depends microscopically on @xmath108 , one",
    "immediately obtains : @xmath109 .",
    "moreover the transverse microscopic electric field @xmath110 is exact on the basic cell @xmath83 .",
    "this implies that @xmath111 reads as : e^0_(x,)=e_(x)+d_y ( ) and therefore the effective electric field @xmath112 belongs to the first de rham cohomology space @xmath113 , a space isomorphic to @xmath114 .",
    "the complete solving of the miscropic system is done by a linear decomposition : @xmath115 , where the functions @xmath116 satisfy : @xmath117 this leads to the linear relation : @xmath118 , where : @xmath119    the second system shows that the magnetic field is both exact and co - exact , implying that @xmath120 does not depend on @xmath104 .",
    "we denote : @xmath121 .",
    "finally , the macroscopic equations read as : @xmath122 after averaging on @xmath83 , one obtains : @xmath123 where @xmath124 .",
    "the usual anisotropic permittivity tensor is found .",
    "generalizations and details can be found in @xcite .",
    "the method can be extended to deal with resonant structures @xcite and obtain a homogenization result for higher bands that the first one , also it is sometimes wrongly believed that this approach can only deal with quasistatic problems .",
    "it is interesting to note that the degree of the forms involved can be a clue to the definition of the averaged field @xcite .",
    "we have described three different approaches to the homogenization of a two dimensional dielectric metamaterial .",
    "the micro - local approach is less developed than the other but still seems quite interesting , and in need of mathematical development .",
    "our preferred one still is the multiple scale approach because it can deal with the notion of convergence and the boundary conditions naturally .",
    "however , it is also in need of mathematical development in order to take spatial dispersion into account .",
