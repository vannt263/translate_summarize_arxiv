    "massless triangle feynman diagrams occur in field theoretical perturbative calculations , being one of the primary divergent ( one - particle irreducible ) graphs for the non - abelian gauge theories such as yang - mills fields .",
    "this makes this kind of perturbative calculation the more interesting and necessary once we want to check the higher order quantum corrections for many physical processes of interest .",
    "two decades ago , boos and davydychev @xcite were the first to obtain the analytic formulae for the one - loop massless vertex diagram using the mellin - barnes complex contour integral representation for the propagators .",
    "later on , suzuki , santos and schmidt @xcite reproduced the same result making use of the negative dimensional integration method ( ndim ) technique of halliday and ricotta @xcite for feynman integrals , where propagators are initially taken to be finite polynomials in the integrand , and once the result is obtained , analytically continued to the realm of positive dimensions .",
    "these two widely different methods of calculation yielding the same answer lends to the analytic result obtained a degree of certainty as far as the mathematical soundness is concerned .",
    "however , here i argue that mathematical soundness only is not enough when we are interested in processes of physical content .",
    "neither the mellin - barnes formulation of boos and davydychev nor the ndim technique employed by suzuki _ et al _ to evaluate the massless triangle graph take into account the basic physical constraint imposed on such a diagram due to the momentum conservation flowing in the three legs .",
    "momentum ( that is , energy and three - momentum ) conservation is one of the basic , fundamental tenets of modern natural sciences , and plays a key role in determining the final form for the analytic result for the massles one - loop vertex correction .    the system of coupled , simultaneous partial differential equations : @xmath1\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x } - ( \\alpha+\\beta+1)y\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial y}-\\alpha \\beta z =   0 \\nonumber \\\\",
    "y(1-y)\\frac{\\partial^2 z}{\\partial y^2}-x^2\\frac{\\partial^2 z}{\\partial x^2}-2xy\\frac{\\partial^2 z}{\\partial x \\partial y } + [ \\gamma\\hspace{.05cm}'-(\\alpha+\\beta+1)y]\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial y } - ( \\alpha+\\beta+1)x\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x}-\\alpha \\beta z   = 0 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] has a solution which consists of a linear combination of four hypergeometric functions of type @xmath0 , as follows @xcite : @xmath2 where it is implicit that @xmath3 and @xmath4 are independent variables .    now the analytic solution for the massless triangle feynman diagram given by boos and davydychev @xcite and suzuki _ et al _ @xcite has exactly the same structure as the above solution for the simultaneous partial differential equation",
    ". however , the variables @xmath3 and @xmath4 for the triangle feynman diagram are given by ratios of momentum squared , such as @xmath5 and @xmath6 where @xmath7 , so that the variables @xmath8 and @xmath9 are not independent , but constrained by momentum conservation .",
    "therefore , the solution for the feynman diagram can not be a linear combination of four linearly independent hypergeometric functions @xmath0 , but a linear combination of _ three _ linearly independent hypergeometric solutions @xmath0 .",
    "one of the simplest examples where the four - term hypergeometric combination above mentioned does not reproduce the correct result is when it is embedded in a higher two - loop order calculation .",
    "consider , for example , the diagrams of figure 1 .        for neither of the diagrams the four - term solution for the triangle when embedded into the two - loop graph yields the correct answer .",
    "the right result can only be achieved when we use a three - term triangle solution embedded into the two - loop structure @xcite .",
    "one could use the analytic continuation formula for the @xmath0 function @xcite in order to reduce the number of independent functions to three ; however , one has at least two possibilities to do this : either combining ( [ a ] ) and ( [ c ] ) or combining ( [ b ] ) and ( [ d1 ] ) , so that , for example , for the former case @xmath10    therefore , which three of those @xmath0 s should be considered can not be determined by the momentum conservation only ; it needs another physical input to this end .    in order to determine the exact structure and content of the analytic result for the triangle diagram i employ the analogy that exists between feynman diagrams and electric circuit networks .",
    "the conclusion of the matter can be summarized as follows : since there is a constraint ( call it either a initial condition or a boundary condition ) to the momenta flowing in the legs of a triangle diagram , it means that the overall analytic answer obtained via mellin - barnes or ndim technique , which comes as a sum of four linearly independent hypergeometric functions of type @xmath0 , in fact must contain only three linearly independent ones . which three of these should be is determined by the momentum conservation flowing through the legs of the diagram , _ and _ , by the circuit analogy , by the equivalence between the `` y - type '' and `` @xmath11-type '' resistance networks through which _ conserved _ electric current flows .",
    "although known for a long time and mentioned sometimes in the literature of field theory , the analogy between electric circuit networks and feynman diagrams , more often than not stays as a mere curiosity or at a diagrammatic level in which the drawing is only a representation that helps us out in the `` visualization '' of a given physical process .",
    "there is , however , a few exceptions to this . the earliest one that i know of is by mathews @xcite as early as 1958 where he deals with singularities of green s functions and another one by wu @xcite in 1961 , where he gave an algebraic proof for several properties of normal thresholds ( singularities of the scattering amplitudes ) in perturbation theory",
    "what i am going to do here is just to state the well - known result for the equivalence between `` @xmath12''- and `` @xmath11-circuits '' which is used , for example , in analysing the `` kelvin bridge '' in relation to the more commom `` wheatstone brigde '' .",
    "the equivalence i consider is for the network of resistors , where energy is dissipated via joule effect .",
    "then with this in hands i argue which three out of the overall four hypergeometric functions @xmath0 present in the one - loop vertex obtained via mellin - barnes or via ndim should be considered as physically meaningful .",
    "consider then the `` @xmath12''- and `` @xmath11-circuits '' of figure 2 .",
    "these two network of resistors are related to each other ; for example , the `` delta - circuit '' can be made equivalent to the `` y - circuit '' when resistors obey the following equations @xcite : @xmath13    in electric circuits a general theorem guarantees that the current density in a conductor distributes itself in such a way that the generation of heat is a minimum @xcite . strictly speaking , since i consider the `` y''- and `` delta - networks '' by themselves and not embedded within an electrical circuit , i can not consider the minimum of power generation , but still i can consider the equivalence between the power generated in one of them  say `` y - circuit ''  as compared to the power generated in the other one , the `` delta - circuit '' .    labelling the currents that flow through resistors",
    "@xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 of the `` y - circuit '' by @xmath9 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively , by reason of current conservation we have that , for example @xmath19    each of these currents will generate heat according to joule s law and the corresponding power will be given by ohm s law .",
    "so in each leg , the product of the resistance times the square of the current will give the power generated by the current flowing through it .",
    "the overall power generated in the `` y - network '' is therefore : @xmath20 from this we have the following system of equations : @xmath21 where for convenience i have defined @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .    multiplying the last equation by @xmath26 and comparing with ( [ d ] ) , @xmath27 it follows that the coefficient of @xmath15 is @xmath28 .    multiplying ( [ d ] ) by @xmath29 and comparing with ( [ e ] ) , @xmath30 it follows that the coefficient of @xmath16 is @xmath31 .",
    "finally , multiplying ( [ f ] ) by @xmath32 and comparing with ( [ d ] ) , @xmath33 it follows that the coefficient of @xmath14 is @xmath34 .    on the other hand ,",
    "in the `` delta - network '' , let @xmath35 label the current flowing through resistance @xmath36 , so that the power generated in this resistor is , using ( [ ra ] ) @xmath37    now , as the resistances follow the equivalence defined by ( [ ra ] ) , the current @xmath35 that flows through @xmath36 must be such that : @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40    therefore , the solution for the one - loop triangle feynman diagram must be such that it contains three terms which are proportional to `` currents '' @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "this solution is exactly achieved when i combine ( [ b ] ) and ( [ d1 ] ) in a similar way as was done in ( [ anacont ] ) . combination of ( [ a ] ) and ( [ c ] ) as in ( [ anacont ] ) leaves the term ( [ d1 ] ) in the solution , which is proportional to @xmath44 , and therefore not suitable since it violates the equivalence above demonstrated .",
    "explicit analytic solution for the one - loop massless triangle feynman diagram reads therefore @xmath45 where @xmath46 with @xmath47 being the dimensional regularization parameter .",
    "one notes that the variables for the last @xmath0 , though related to those that appear in the first and second @xmath0 s , differ from them .",
    "using the basic physical principle of momentum conservation i deduced the correct analytic result for the one - loop massless triangle feynman diagram in terms of three linearly independent hypergeometric functions @xmath48 .",
    "the reason why there must be only three linearly independent functions in the solution is due to the fact that the variables @xmath26 and @xmath49 are such that implicit in them is a momentum conservation constraint that must be taken into account properly .",
    "the set of which three linearly independent functions @xmath0 should be is given by another physical input , deduced in analogy to the equivalence between `` y''- and `` delta - network '' of electrical resistance circuits .",
    "with the conservation of momentum correctly taken into account , the final result for the mentioned feynman diagram is the physically correct and relevant analytic solution to the problem , having only a combination of three linearly independent @xmath0 functions in it .",
