    "the fact that most of the universe is dark and composed of new , exotic components has been established over the years by means of various sets of observations , which recently have converged into a consistent picture where the universe is about critical and dominated by an exotic form of matter and by an unexpected type of dark energy . in terms of the density parameter @xmath0 , the current view can be summarized as follows : the total amount of matter / energy of the universe is @xmath1 at the 10% level and this is composed of a matter component @xmath2 and a vacuum ",
    "energy component @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the existence of both dark exotic matter and dark energy asks for extension of the standard model of fundamental interactions , since no known particle or field can represent either of these components . in this paper , we will deal with the problem of explaining the observed amount of dark matter , which we can summarize as : @xmath4 , and with the studies related to the searches for dark matter particles . for an updated review on these subjects ,",
    "supersymmetric models with @xmath5parity conservation naturally predict the existence of a stable relic particle . the nature and the properties of this particle",
    "depend on the way supersymmetry is broken .",
    "in particular , the neutralino happens to be the dark matter candidate in models where supersymmetry is broken through gravity ( or anomaly ) mediated mechanisms .",
    "the actual implementation of a specific susy scheme depends on a number of assumptions on the structure of the model and on the relations among its parameters .",
    "this induces a large variability on the phenomenology of neutralino dark matter .",
    "the simplest and most direct implementation of supersymmetry is represented by the _ minimal supergravity _ ( msugra ) scheme , where gauge coupling constants are unified at the gut scale and at the same scale also the susy  breaking mass parameters are universal .",
    "the low  energy sector is obtained through renormalization group evolution of all the parameters of the model , and this also induces the breaking of the electroweak symmetry in a radiative way .",
    "this model is very predictive , since it relies only on four free parameters .",
    "however , neutralino phenomenology is quite constrained @xcite and also quite sensitive to some standard model parameters , like the mass of the top and bottom quarks ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) and the strong coupling constant @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "less constrained susy implementations are obtained by relaxing the universality conditions ( _ non  universal sugra models _",
    "@xcite ) or by defining the relevant susy framework directly at the electro  weak scale as an effective low  energy theory ( _ low  energy minimal supersymmetric standard model _",

    "a careful and exhaustive modeling of the galactic halo properties has been performed in obtaining the region showed in fig .",
    "[ fig : sugra_sigma ] @xcite .",
    "the question whether current direct detection sensitivities are probing dominant or subdominant relic neutralinos may be answered in terms of the plot shown if fig.[fig : sugra_rho_omega ] , which translates directly in terms of astrophysical and cosmological quantities the direct detection results @xcite . by considering the current interval of sensitivities on the quantity",
    "@xmath27 $ ] , the calculation of @xmath28 allows us to determine the values of @xmath20 which are required , for each susy configuration , in order to provide a detectable signal @xcite .",
    "fig.[fig : sugra_rho_omega ] shows the calculated values of @xmath20 vs. the neutralino relic abundance , for the msugra scheme .",
    "we see that a fraction of susy models overlap with the region of main cosmological and astrophysical interest : @xmath29 and @xmath30 . for points in this region ,",
    "the neutralino is the dominant component of dark matter both in the universe and at the galactic level . for points which fall inside the band delimited by the slant dot  dashed lines",
    ", the neutralino would provide only a fraction of the cold dark matter density both at the level of local density and at the level of the average @xmath0 , a situation which would be possible if the neutralino is not the unique cold dark matter particle component . on the other hand , configurations above the upper dot ",
    "dashed line and below the upper horizontal dashed line would imply the somewhat more unlikely situation of a stronger clustering of neutralinos in our halo as compared to their average distribution in the universe .",
    "finally , configurations above the upper horizontal line are incompatible with the upper limit on the local density of dark matter in our galaxy .",
    "we can certainly define the following items as the current main issues and open problems in particle dark matter studies : _ i ) _ to explain the observed amount of dark matter in the universe ( @xmath4 ) by finding suitable particle candidates ; _ ii ) _ to detect a relic particle .",
    "we have shown that for both of these issues , there appear to be good prospects of success , especially for the most studied candidate which is the neutralino .",
    "in particular , there are many susy schemes where relic neutralinos can provide enough cosmological abundance to explain the observed amount of dark matter , and at the same time they can have detection rates large enough to be accessible to detection . clearly",
    "the occurrence of this particularly interesting situation depends on the actual realization of supersymmetry .",
    "the observation of a signal from dark matter , like for instance in the case of the annual modulation effect observed by the dama / nai collaboration or of signals which could hopefully come in future experiments , can be very important not only for astrophysics and cosmology but also for particle physics , since the need to explain such effects can help in deriving properties of particle physics models and possibly discriminate among different realizations , for instance of supersymmetry .",
