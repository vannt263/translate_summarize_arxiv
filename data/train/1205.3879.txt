    ", we use this approach for suppression of dissipation and cavity induced feedback in cascaded opo that leads to increasing the level of three - photon - number correlation .",
    "in this section we briefly describe the cascaded optical parametric oscillator ( opo ) with a triply resonant optical ring cavity driven by a sequence of laser pulses .",
    "the semiclassical and quantum theories of this device for the monochromatic pump field were developed in refs . @xcite and here we only add some important details regarding cascaded opo under laser pulses with gaussian time - dependent envelopes .",

    "we consider below the case of high cavity losses for the pump mode @xmath11 , when the pump mode is eliminated adiabatically in non - depletion approximation . in this case",
    ", the effective interaction hamiltonian in the rotating wave approximation reads as @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 ( i=1,2 ) are the operators of the modes at the frequencies @xmath3 and @xmath4 and the coupling constants between the modes are expressed through the fourier spectra of the second - order susceptibilities of nonlinear crystals of the length @xmath15 @xmath16 we assume collinear , one - dimensional on @xmath17 quasi - phase - matching with the phase mismatch vectors @xmath18 @xmath19 analyzed in the details @xcite .    in this regime , the stochastic equations of motion for the complex c - number variables @xmath20 and @xmath21 corresponding to the operators @xmath22 and @xmath23 , have the following form @xmath24 @xmath25 the equations for @xmath26 are obtained from ( 8) , ( 9 ) by exchanging the subscripts @xmath27 .",

    "thus , remarkable feature of opo under monochromatic pump is comparatively low generation threshold that depends from the second - order susceptibility in comparison with the scheme of direct intracavity three - photon down - conversion , where the pump power threshold is determined by the third - order susceptibility @xcite .",

    "the analysis of stochastic equations shows that similar to the standard opo with monochromatic pump field amplitude , the periodically pulsed opo also exhibits threshold behavior , which is easily described through the period averaged pump field amplitude @xmath38 .",

    "thus , we modify the above results considering three - wave interaction with the indexes of polarization states . looking further applications of above results for intracavity three - photon down - conversion in collinear configuration of cascading processes we concentrate on consideration of non - product states that are entangled only on polarization degree of freedom but not on spatial variables . thus , including into consideration the polarization states of the photons we assume that the type - ii process @xmath70 create the pair of photons with @xmath71 vertical @xmath72 and horizontal @xmath73 polarizations in collinear configuration .",

    "the next process is considered as the type - i parametric process . in type - i conversion ,",
    "photon pairs are created with the same polarization state , but ortogonal to the input mode .",

    "thus , we demonstrate that in this collinear , one - dimensional cascaded scheme triple photons can constitutes the polarization entangled ( non - product ) states of light .",
    "it should be noted that under cavity feedback effects the non - product quantum state can not be described by this simple expression and we should include the higher - order terms of the perturbation expansion into consideration .",

    "<S> generating multi - photon entangled states is a primary task for applications of quantum information processing . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate production of photon - triplet in a regime of light amplification in second - order nonlinear media under action of a pulsed laser beam . for this goal the process of cascaded three - photon splitting in an optical cavity driven by a sequence of laser pulses with gaussian time - dependent envelopes </S>",
    "<S> is investigated . </S>",
    "<S> considering production of photon - triplet for short - time regime and in the cascaded three - wave collinear configuration we shortly analyze preparation of polarization - non - product states looking further applications of these results in the cascaded optical parametric oscillator . </S>",
    "<S> it is also demonststed the nonclassical characteritics of the photon - triplet in phase - space on the base of the wigner function . calculating the normalized third - order correlation functions below - and at the generation threshold of cascaded optical parametric oscillator </S>",
    "<S> , we demonstrate that in the pulsed regime , depending on the duration of pulses and the time - interval separations between them , the degree of three - photon - number correlation essentially exceed the analogous one for the case of continuous pumping . </S>"
