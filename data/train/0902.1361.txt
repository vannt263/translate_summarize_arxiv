    "the nature of spin and/or charge inhomogeneities , especially in the form of stripes , in some cuprates and their involvement to high - temperature superconductivity are currently debate issues .",
    "@xcite the stripe state is characterized by the self - organization of the charges and spins in the cuo@xmath7 planes in a peculiar manner , where the doped holes are arranged in one - dimensional ( 1d ) lines and form the so - called `` charge stripe '' separating the antiferromagnetic domains .",
    "the stripe - ordered state minimizes the energy of the hole - doped antiferromagnetic system , thus leading to an inhomogeneous state of matter .",
    "static one - dimensional charge and spin stripe order have been observed experimentally in a few special cuprate compounds , specifically in la@xmath8nd@xmath9sr@xmath10cuo@xmath11  @xcite and la@xmath12ba@xmath10cuo@xmath11 with @xmath13 .",
    "@xcite similar signatures identified in la@xmath12sr@xmath10cuo@xmath11 ( lsco )  @xcite and other high temperature superconductors  @xcite point to the possible existence of stripes , albeit of a dynamical or fluctuating nature .",
    "a pivotal issue about this new electronic state of matter concerns whether it is compatible with superconductivity , and possibly even essential for the high transition temperatures , or it competes with the pairing correlations .",
    "a prerequisite for addressing these issues is to understand the electronic structures of various stripe states in different cuprates , and to answer the question whether the stripe phase is intrinsically `` metallic '' or `` insulating '' , given its spin- and charge - ordered nature .",

    "@xcite    meanwhile , optical conductivity measurements on the systems with a stripe phase also display the divergent results . in la@xmath24nd@xmath15sr@xmath19cuo@xmath11",
    "@xcite and la@xmath18ba@xmath25sr@xmath10cuo@xmath11 ,  @xcite a finite frequency absorption peak with almost disappearance of the drude mode in the low - frequency conductivity in several experiments has been interpreted as collective excitations of charge stripes or as charge localization from the disorder created by nd or ba substitutions .",
    "these observations may support the suggestion that such stripe - ordered state should be `` insulating '' in nature .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , optical experiment on la@xmath18ba@xmath19cuo@xmath11  @xcite has observed a residual drude peak with a loss of the low - energy spectral weight below the temperature corresponding to the onset of charge stripe order , which indicates that stripes are compatible with the so - called nodal - metal state .",
    "@xcite    although , there have been some theoretical studies on the spectral and optical properties in the stripe phase in the past years ,  @xcite the contradictory observations in recent experiments as mentioned above have yet not been explained consistently in theoretical frame by adopting a realistic stripe model . in this paper , by using a stripe model in which the experimentally observed spin and charge structures at 1/8 doping are well reflected , we show that the spin domain - derived scattering will depress the zero - energy spectral weight around the nodal regions , while the charge domain - derived scattering will suppress mostly those around the antinodal regions and the hot spots . compared to the arpes data , this suggests that the different spectral weight distribution may result from the different relative strength of the spin and charge domain - derived scattering potentials inherently existing in these compounds .",
    "meanwhile , a finite frequency peak in the optical conductivity appears with the disappearance of the drude peak in the case of the dominant spin domain - derived scattering . while , when the charge domain - derived scattering is comparable to the spin one , a residual drude peak exists with the disappearance of the finite energy peak",
    "this suggests that both the `` insulating '' and `` metallic '' properties are intrinsic to the stripe state without introducing another distinct metallic phase .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the model hamiltonian and carry out the analytical calculations . in sec .",
    "iii , we present the numerical calculations and discuss the results . in sec .",
    "iv , we present the conclusion .",
    "as the above discussed compounds have a doping density at or near 1/8 , we will in this paper consider the 1/8 doping antiphase vertical stripe state . a schematic illustration of its charge and spin pattern is presented in fig .",
    "1 . the charge stripes , with a unit cell of 8 lattice sites ( note for 1/8 doping , there is one hole for every two sites along the length of a charge stripe ) , act as antiphase domain walls for the magnetic order , so that the magnetic unit cell is twice as long as that for charge order . due to the periodical modulation of the stripe order ,",
    "the electrons moving in the state will be scattered by the modulation potentials .",
    "after fourier transformation , the potential @xmath26 can be written as the scattering term between the state @xmath27 and those at @xmath28 with @xmath29 .",
    "following ref .  , we expect that the terms @xmath30 and @xmath31 will be the dominant spin and charge domain - derived scattering term , and will be relabeled as @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the following , respectively .",
    "the weaker higher harmonic terms will be neglected here . in the coexistence with the superconducting ( sc ) order ,",
    "the model hamiltonian can be written as a @xmath32 matrix for @xmath27 in the reduced brillouin zone , @xmath33 where , the prime denotes the summation over the reduced brillouin zone .",
    "@xmath34 is a column vector with its elements @xmath35 for @xmath36 , and @xmath37 for @xmath38 .",
    "both @xmath39 and @xmath40 are @xmath41 matrix with    @xmath42    and    @xmath43    as for the tight - binding energy band , we will choose the following form ,  @xcite @xmath44 where , @xmath45 is the doping density , and a @xmath46-wave sc order parameter @xmath47 is assumed .",
    "generally , the charge modulation will induce the modulation of the sc order leading to the finite momentum pairs .",
    "however , in the present study , one of our aim is to examine the effect of the spin ( charge ) domain - derived scattering on the sc order .",
    "in this regard , the average value of the sc order parameter is relevant and the modulation of the sc order will be ignored .",
    "we have checked the effect of this modulation and found no qualitative change in the results presented in fig .",
    "2 . in the following",
    ", @xmath48 is taken as the energy unit , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "this dispersion can be derived from the slave - boson mean - field calculation of the @xmath52 model  @xcite , and in this way the parameters @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are determined self - consistently .",
    "here we take it as a phenomenological form . in a self - consistent calculation ,",
    "the hamiltonian is first diagonalized by a unitary matrix @xmath56 with a set of trial values of @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 for given potentials @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "then @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are self - consistently calculated by using the relations : @xmath57 ( to get the @xmath46-wave pairing , the sign before @xmath53 takes @xmath58 for @xmath59 and @xmath60 for @xmath61 , where @xmath62 and @xmath63 denote the unit vectors along @xmath64 and @xmath65 directions , respectively . ) , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 , respectively .",
    "reformularization of the expressions of @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 in terms of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the hamiltonian , one obtains the self - consistency relations    @xmath68 \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\chi_{0}&=&\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{k}(\\cos k_{x}+\\cos k_{y})\\sum^{16}_{m=1}u_{1m}(k)u^{\\dag}_{m1}(k)f[e_{m}(k ) ] \\nonumber \\\\ n&=&\\frac{2}{n}\\sum_{k}\\sum^{16}_{m=1}u_{1m}(k)u^{\\dag}_{m1}(k)f[e_{m}(k)],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where , @xmath69 is the eigenvalue of the hamiltonian , @xmath70 the elements of the matrix @xmath56 , and @xmath71 $ ] is the fermi - dirac distribution function .",
    "then , the single particle green functions @xmath72 can be expressed as @xmath73 and the spectral functions is @xmath74",
    "we first present in fig .",
    "2 the self - consistent results of the sc order parameter as a function of @xmath0 and @xmath1 . while the scattering from both spin and charge domain - derived scattering potentials in the stripe state leads to the suppression of the sc order parameter , the charge domains are more compatible with superconductivity than spin domains , as can be seen from fig .",
    "this may support the statement that the sc pairing in the stripe state occurs most strongly within the charge stripes .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , an interesting feature is that the sc order parameter will be zero at the spin domain - derived scattering potential @xmath75 in the absence of the charge domain - derived scattering , however , it will develop a noticeable value after turning on the charge domain - derived scattering potential , as shown in fig .",
    "this shows that the charge domain - derived scattering will lead to the emergency of the sc order which is otherwise destroyed by the spin only scattering .      in fig .",
    "3 , we present the distribution of the low - energy spectral weight in the original brillouin zone ( integrated over an energy window @xmath76 about @xmath77 ) in the 1/8 antiphase stripe state for different spin ( charge ) domain - derived scattering potential @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "let us first look at the limit where only the spin domain - derived scattering is included , i.e. , @xmath78 with @xmath79 , one will find that the spectral weight around the nodal region is suppressed heavily[see fig .",
    "3(a ) ] . at another limit where only the charge domain - derived scattering is included ( @xmath80 with @xmath81 ) ,",
    "the spectral weight around the nodal region is recovered and those around the hot spot ( the cross of the fermi surface with the line @xmath82 ) and near the antinodal region are suppressed[see fig .",
    "3(b ) ] . starting from the limit of @xmath78 and fixing @xmath79 , the spectral weight will redistribute gradually from the antinodal region to the nodal region with the increase of the charge domain - derived scattering potential @xmath1 , as shown in figs",
    ". 3(c ) and ( d ) .",
    "when two scattering potentials are comparable , the strongest spectral weight situates around the nodal region , and at the meantime noticeable spectral weights along the whole fermi surface is presented .",
    "therefore , the divergent features observed in arpes measurements by zhou _",
    "et al . _ in ( la@xmath14nd@xmath15sr@xmath83)cuo@xmath11  @xcite in which the low - energy excitations near the nodal region are depleted , and by valla _",

    "this consistent accounting enables us to propose that the spin domain - derived scattering dominates over the charge one in the former system while the scattering strengthes of them are comparable in the latter system .    in the presence of the spin ( charge ) domain - derived potential ,",
    "quasiparticles near the fermi surface will be scattered from @xmath84 to @xmath85 ( n=1 for the spin domain - derived potential , n=2 for the charge one ) , for the 1/8 antiphase vertical stripe configuration shown as fig .",
    "1 . this gives rise to two scattering channels from the spin domain with potential @xmath0 , @xmath86 and two scattering channels from the charge domain with potential @xmath1 , @xmath87 strong potential scattering will destruct those parts of the fermi surface connected by the above mentioned scattering wave vectors .",
    "because the scattering wave vectors @xmath88 and @xmath89 are close to the transferred momenta from the node to node scattering , so it will lead to a depletion of the spectral weight near the nodal region as shown in fig .",
    "3(a ) . on the other hand , the scattering wave vectors",
    "@xmath90 and @xmath91 , which is near the connecting wave vectors between the two approximately parallel segments of the fermi surface near the antinodal and hot spot region , the scatterings with these wave vectors will suppress the spectral weights around the antinodal and hot spot regions [ fig .",
    "3(b ) ] .      now",
    ", we turn to the discussion of the in - plane optical properties in the 1/8 antiphase stripe state , and to see how they are influenced by the scattering from the spin and charge domains .",
    "we will fix the temperature at @xmath92 in all calculations , in order to avoid the influence from the temperature induced change in the scattering rate .",
    "we consider an electric field applied in the @xmath64 direction , which is perpendicular to the stripe . from the kubo formula for the optical conductivity , the real part of the optical conductivity is @xmath93/\\omega$ ] .",

    "4(a)-4(d ) show the results for the optical conductivity calculated with the same scattering potentials as used to get fig .",
    "3(a)-3(d ) . with only spin domain - derived scattering[fig .",
    "4(a ) ] , no drude - like component appears at zero frequency in the optical conductivity , instead a finite frequency conductivity peak occurs around 0.3 .",
    "this indicates that the system exhibits the `` insulating '' property .",
    "@xcite when only charge domain - derived scattering is considered[fig .",
    "4(b ) ] , the drude - like peak shows up and at the meantime the finite frequency peak remains .",
    "optical conductivity involves the contribution from the quasiparticle excitations along the whole fermi surface weighted by the quasiparticle group velocity . due to the relative flat band structure near the antinodal region for the high-@xmath6 cuprates ,",
    "the zero frequency optical conductivity mainly comes from the quasiparticle excitations around the nodal region . in the case of",
    "only spin domain - derived scattering , the nodal region of the fermi surface is gapped and therefore the quasiparticle spectral weight is suppressed around the nodal region as shown in fig .",
    "3(a ) , so that the zero - frequency drude - like peak is absent and a finite frequency peak with its position being equal to the gap ( @xmath98 ) occurs .",
    "for the charge domain - derived scattering , the gap opens around the hot spots and near the antinodal , but a large spectral weight situates around the nodal region , as can be seen from fig .",
    "thus , the drude - like peak emerges and the finite frequency peak remains ( it is now situates at @xmath99 ) . as shown in fig .",
    "3(c ) , with the increase of the charge domain - derived scattering @xmath1 , the gap near the nodal region which is resulted from the spin domain - derived scattering will be suppressed gradually and correspondingly the spectral weight will be enhanced . as a result , the finite frequency peak in the optical conductivity",
    "is shifted to lower frequency and the zero frequency component is lifted up gradually[fig .",
    "when the charge domain - derived scattering is comparable to the spin one , the quasiparticles have noticeable spectra weight along the entire fermi surface with its largest weight around the nodal region[fig .",
    "3(d ) ] , then the drude - like mode occurs at the zero frequency , and the finite frequency peak fades away and merges into the drude - like peak , as shown in fig .",
    "the calculated results for the optical conductivity presented in figs .",
    "4(c ) and 4(d ) are consistent well with the experimental observations in the stripe state of la@xmath24nd@xmath15sr@xmath19cuo@xmath11  @xcite and la@xmath18ba@xmath19cuo@xmath11  @xcite , respectively .",
    "we now discuss the implication of our theoretical results .",
    "as noted in the introduction , in la@xmath24nd@xmath15sr@xmath19cuo@xmath11 system , arpes experiment has found that there is little or no low - energy spectral weight near the nodal region ,  @xcite and optical conductivity experiment has observed a finite frequency peak with almost the disappearance of the drude mode , indicating an `` insulating '' stripe state .  @xcite these spectroscopic features can be reproduced here with a strong spin domain - derived scattering potential @xmath79 and a weak charge domain - derived potential @xmath100 and @xmath78 , as shown in figs .",
    "3(a ) , 3(c ) , 4(a ) and 4(c ) . interestingly , in this parameter regime for the spin and charge domain - derived scattering , the sc order is destroyed as can be seen from fig .",
    "this is in consistent with the experimental fact that la@xmath24nd@xmath15sr@xmath19cuo@xmath11 is nonsuperconducting . in another cuprate la@xmath18ba@xmath19cuo@xmath11",
    ", arpes spectra have identified the existence of high spectral intensity around the nodal region ,  @xcite and the optical conductivity measurement has observed a residual drude peak without the finite frequency peak ,  @xcite pointing to a so - called nodal metal state .",
    "@xcite when comparable spin and charge domain - derived scattering potentials are assumed such as @xmath79 and @xmath80 , we can reproduce these features consistently , as shown in figs . 3(d ) and 4(d ) . on the other hand ,",
    "a weak superconductivity emerges in the otherwise nonsuperconducting regime ( when only spin scattering potential @xmath101 is considered ) with the increase of the charge domain - derived scattering potential[see fig .",
    "this suggests that the weak superconductivity in la@xmath18ba@xmath19cuo@xmath11 is likely beneficial from the metallic behaviors of the stripe state originated from a sufficient charge domain - derived scattering .",
    "the above mentioned consistent accounting for both divergent spectroscopic features observed in two families of high-@xmath6 cuprates indicates that the stripe state may be intrinsically `` insulating '' or `` metallic '' , depending on the relative strength of the spin and charge domain - derived scattering potentials . specifically , a large spin domain - derived scattering potential favors the `` insulating '' state , while a large charge domain - derived scattering potential the `` metallic '' state .",
    "we have calculated the sc order parameter , the spectral function and the optical conductivity in a stripe model with spin and charge domain - derived scattering potentials ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) .",
    "the self - consistent calculation of the sc order parameter shows that the charge domain - derived scattering is less effective than the spin scattering on the suppression of superconductivity , and may even lead to the emergency of the sc order which is otherwise destroyed by the spin only scattering . for @xmath2 , the zero - energy spectral weight disappears around the nodal points , and a finite energy peak appears in the optical conductivity with almost the disappearance of the drude peak .",
    "but for @xmath4 , the spectral weight concentrates on the nodal region , and a residual drude peak exists in the optical conductivity without the finite energy peak",
    ". these results consistently account for the divergent spectroscopic properties observed experimentally in two families of high-@xmath6 cuprates , and demonstrate that both the `` insulating '' and `` metallic '' behavior may be the intrinsic properties of the stripe state , depending on the relative strength of the spin and charge domain - derived scattering potentials .",

    "<S> the spectral weight concentrates on the ( @xmath3 ) antinodal region , and a finite energy peak appears in the optical conductivity with the disappearance of the drude peak . </S>",
    "<S> but for @xmath4 , the spectral weight concentrates on the ( @xmath5 ) nodal region , and a residual drude peak exists in the optical conductivity without the finite energy peak </S>",
    "<S> . these results consistently account for the divergent observations in the arpes and optical conductivity experiments in several high-@xmath6 cuprates , and suggest that the `` insulating '' and `` metallic '' properties are intrinsic to the stripe state , depending on the relative strength of the spin and charge domain - derived scattering potentials . </S>"
