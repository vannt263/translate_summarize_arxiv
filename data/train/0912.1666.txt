    "water is essential in biology , because it participates in nearly every process necessary for life ( including cell metabolism , transport of nutrients and residues , protein conformation changes , etc . ) , and is the most common solvent in chemistry .",
    "it regulates a large variety of processes , including atmospheric phenomena , the formation of geophysical structures , the propagation of cracks in stones and cement , the sliding of glaciers , the transport in plants , and is ubiquitous in the universe as ice in the interstellar space . in all these examples the properties of water are essential to understand what is observed .",
    "nevertheless , water has proven to be a complex puzzle to many researchers for its anomalous thermodynamic and dynamic properties at room temperature and pressure .",
    "for example , by decreasing temperature @xmath0 at pressure @xmath1  atm , water s volume fluctuations , proportional to the isothermal compressibility @xmath2 , increase below @xmath3c , and entropy fluctuations , proportional to the isobaric specific heat @xmath4 increase below @xmath5c , while in normal liquid any fluctuation decreases when @xmath0 is decreased @xcite .",
    "these water s anomalies grow upon cooling and increase in number .",
    "for example below @xmath6c the cross - fluctuation of volume and entropy , proportional to the isobaric thermal expansion coefficient @xmath7 , becomes negative @xcite , while it is always positive in normal liquids where the entropy decreases when the volume decreases @xcite .    by decreasing @xmath0",
    "even more , it is experimentally possible to supercool liquid water down to @xmath8c at 1 atm and to @xmath9c at 2000 atm , where the liquid is metastable with respect to crystal phases @xcite .",
    "these extreme conditions are not unusual in nature , where water exists in its liquid form at @xmath10c in insects , @xmath11c in clouds or @xmath12c in plants @xcite .",
    "below @xmath13 the homogeneous nucleation of crystal ice occurs in a time too short to allow any measurements .",
    "but even the crystal phase of water is not simple .",
    "in fact , water is a polymorph with at least sixteen forms of crystal ices , the last one , ice xv , was discovered in 2009 @xcite .",
    "however , at very low @xmath0 , crystal water is not the only possible kind of ice . by rapidly quenching liquid water below @xmath14c @xcite , or by condensing the vapour at low @xmath0 @xcite , or by compressing crystal ice at low @xmath0 @xcite , or by irradiation ( with ions for example @xcite ) , it is possible to solidify water as an amorphous , or glass , i. e. a form that has the elastic properties of a solid , but the structure of a liquid with no long - range order @xcite . as for the crystal state ,",
    "the amorphous state of water is also not unique .",
    "water is a polyamorph with at least three different amorphous states : low  density amorphous ( lda ) , discovered in 1935 @xcite , high  density amorphous ( hda ) , discovered in 1984 @xcite , and very high - density amorphous ice ( vhda ) , discovered in 2001 @xcite .",
    "all these anomalies of water are a consequence of the properties of the hydrogen bond network that they form .",
    "the hydrogen bond interaction is characterized by a preferred geometrical configuration , that at low @xmath0 and @xmath15 is approximately a tetrahedron of four molecules around a central one , with an angle varying around @xmath16 ( slightly smaller than a tetrahedral angle of @xmath17 ) and a distance oscillating around @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "the local arrangement , including the number of nearest neighbours , can change with @xmath0 and @xmath15 .",
    "in particular , in 2000 soper and ricci observed at @xmath19  k , compressing from @xmath20 to @xmath21  mpa , a continuous transformation from low ",
    "density liquid ( ldl ) local arrangement of water with an open , hydrogen - bonded tetrahedral structure , to high  density liquid ( hdl ) local arrangement with nontetrahedral o - o - o angles and a collapsed second coordination shell with broken hydrogen bonds , and a change in density of about 73% @xcite .",
    "all the above results are consistent with theories that propose different mechanisms and different phase behaviors in the supercooled region .",
    "they can be summarized in four possible scenarios for the @xmath22 phase diagram .",
    "\\(i ) in the _ stability limit _ ( sl )",
    "scenario  @xcite the behavior of the superheated liquid spinodal , i. e. the limit of stability of the liquid with respect to the gas , and the stretched water , i. e. water under tension as in a plant fibers , are related . in particular , it is hypothesized that the limits of stability of these two regions are continuously connected at negative pressure , forming a re - entrant curve toward the positive @xmath15 region below @xmath23 .",
    "the response functions , including @xmath2 , @xmath4 and @xmath7 , diverge when @xmath0 is decreased a positive @xmath15 as a consequence of the approaching of the re - entrant spinodal line .",
    "\\(ii ) in the _ liquid  liquid critical point _ ( llcp ) scenario @xcite it is hypothesized the existence of a ldl  hdl first ",
    "order phase transition line with negative slope in the @xmath22 plane and terminating in a critical point @xmath24 . below the critical pressure",
    "@xmath25 the response functions increase on approaching the widom line ( the locus of correlation length maxima emanating from @xmath24 into the one  phase region ) @xcite , and for @xmath26 by approaching the hdl  to  ldl spinodal line .",
    "the possibility with @xmath27 have also been proposed  @xcite .",
    "\\(iii ) in the _ singularity  free _ ( sf ) scenario  @xcite it is hypothesized that the low-@xmath0 anticorrelation between volume and entropy gives rise to response functions that increase upon cooling and display maxima at non ",
    "zero @xmath0 , but do not display any singular behavior .",
    "specifically , sastry et al .",
    "@xcite show that this is a direct consequence of the fact that water s line of temperatures of maximum density ( tmd ) has a negative slope in the @xmath28 plane .",
    "\\(iv ) in the  _ critical  point free _ ( cpf ) scenario @xcite it is hypothesized that a first  order phase transition line separates two liquid phases and extends to @xmath29 toward the superheated limit of stability of liquid water .",
    "this scenario effectively predicts a continuous locus of stability limit spanning the superheated , stretched and supercooled state , because the spinodal associated with the first ",
    "order transition will intersect the liquid ",
    "gas spinodal at negative pressure .",
    "no critical point is present in this scenario .",
    "since all these scenarios are consistent with the available experimental data , a natural question is if we can design an experiment that would discriminate among them .",
    "unfortunately , many scientists have discovered that an answer to this question is a difficult challenge @xcite .",
    "in fact , experiments on bulk water are hampered by freezing below @xmath13 , and no measurements on bulk liquid water can be performed with our present technology below this temperature . nevertheless , the different proposed theories have different implications on phenomena such as the cold denaturation ( and stop of activity ) of proteins at low @xmath0 , an important issue in cryopreservation , cryonics , cryostasis and cryobiology .",
    "one possible strategy to probe supercooled water at very low @xmath0 is to consider water at an interface .",
    "water adsorbed onto the surface of proteins or confined in nanopores freezes at much lower @xmath0 than bulk water , giving access to a low - temperature region where interfacial water is still liquid , while bulk water would not be @xcite . in many cases of interest for practical purposes in biology , geology or industrial applications , water is hydrating a surface or is confined . as a consequence , fundamental research in physics and",
    "chemistry has been performed in recent years with experiments @xcite , theories and simulations @xcite .    during the last years experiments on water in vycor micropores @xcite , in nanopores of mcm-41 silica @xcite , of sol  gel silica glass @xcite , of naa zeolites @xcite , or of double - wall carbon nanotubes @xcite",
    "have contributed to the investigation of water dynamics in confinement .",
    "in particular , confinement in hydrophilic mcm-41 silica nanopores of @xmath30 and @xmath31  nm diameter allows to study water dynamics down to @xmath32  k where quasielastic neutron scattering reveals a crossover at @xmath33  k in the average translational relaxation time from a non - arrhenius behavior at high @xmath0 to an arrhenius behavior at low @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "a similar crossover is also observed for the self - diffusion coefficient of water by nuclear magnetic resonance at @xmath34  k @xcite . by increasing from @xmath21  bars to @xmath35",
    "bars the external pressure applied on a sample of mcm-41 silica nanopores with @xmath31  nm diameter at full hydration level of @xmath36 g of h@xmath37o per g of silica , it has been observed that the crossover occurs at lower @xmath0 , reaching @xmath38  k at @xmath39  bars and disappears at higher @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "quasielastic neutron scattering experiments show the same crossover for the average translational relaxation time of at least three different systems : ( i ) water hydrating lysozymes , at hydration level @xmath40 g of h@xmath37o per g of dry lysozyme , for @xmath41  k , a temperature below which the protein has a glassy dynamics @xcite , ( ii ) dna hydration water , at hydration level corresponding to about 15 water molecules per base pairs , for @xmath42  k , at which dna displays the onset of anharmonic molecular motion @xcite , and ( iii ) rna hydration water , at a similar hydration level , for @xmath41  k , where both rna and its hydration water exhibit a sharp change in slope for the mean - square displacements of the hydrogen atoms @xcite ,    all these results can be interpreted as a consequence of a structural rearrangement of water molecules associated with a ldl - hdl critical point @xcite . in fact , along the widom line in the supercritical region of the ldl - hdl critical point , the changes in the hydrogen bond network are consistent with the dynamic behavior observed in the experiments , as we will discuss in the following sections",
    ".    this interpretation has been criticized @xcite on the base of similar crossover observed for water confined in molecular sieves @xcite or for water mixtures @xcite and water solutions @xcite .",
    "it has also been proposed a possible interpretation as a consequence of the dynamics of ( bjerrum - type ) defects due to orientationally disordered water molecules that are hydrogen bonded to less than four other water molecules @xcite .",
    "@xmath43h - nmr studies on hydrated proteins , at a comparable hydration level as in @xcite , show no evidence for the crossover at @xmath44  k and indicate that water performs thermally activated and distorted tetrahedral jumps at @xmath45  k , which may be related to a universal defect diffusion @xcite .",
    "also , dielectric spectroscopy studies of hydrated protein show a smooth temperature variations of conductivity at @xmath44  k and ascribe the crossover observed in neutron scattering to a secondary relaxation that splits from the main structural relaxation @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , numerical simulations for bulk water show that crossing the widom line emanating from a ldl - hdl critical point , the structural change in water is maximum , as emphasized by the maximum in specific heat , and the diffusion constant has a crossover @xcite .",
    "this result is observed also in water hydrating lysozyme or dna , where the dynamic transition of the macromolecules occurs at the temperature of dynamic crossover in the diffusivity of hydration water and also coincides with the maximum change in water structure @xcite .",
    "a crossover from high-@xmath0 non - arrhenius to low-@xmath0 arrhenius behavior is observed also in simulation of water hydrating lysozyme powder in the translational correlation time and in the inverse of the self - diffusion constant , in agreement with the neutron scattering experiments , at about @xmath46  k @xcite . the activation energy for the arrhenius regime",
    "is found to be of about @xmath47  ev , as in the neutron scattering experiments @xcite .",
    "also , simulations of water hydrating elastin - like and collagen - like peptides show this crossover , but with a weaker change in the slope and an arrhenius activation energy of about @xmath48  ev , consistent with dielectric spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance studies @xcite .",
    "it is therefore difficult not only in the experiments , but also in the models to get a clear answer about the relevant dynamic mechanisms and their relation with the thermodynamics in water at interfaces .",
    "moreover , the relation between confined water and bulk water remains not fully understood .",
    "for this reason models that are tractable with a theoretical approach are particularly appealing in this context . with these models , in fact , simulations can be compared with analytic calculations to develop a consistent theory .",
    "we consider the case of water in two dimensions ( 2d ) .",
    "this case can be considered as an extreme confinement of one single layer of water between two repulsive ( hydrophobic ) walls when the distance between the walls is such to inhibit the crystal formation @xcite .",
    "in fact , it has been shown that the relevant parameter to avoid the transition to a crystal phase is the distance between the confining wall and not the characteristics of the hydrophobic interaction with the wall @xcite .",
    "another case in which the study of a monolayer of water is relevant is when a substrate of protein powder is , on average , hydrated only by a single layer of water , and the proteins do not undergo any configurational transformation and/or large scale motion @xcite . in these conditions , for a hydrophilic protein surface , we can assume that the effect of the water ",
    "protein interaction is to attract water on a surface that , by constraining the water molecule positions , inhibits its crystallization .",
    "a very desirable feature of a model for a liquid is transferability .",
    "the parameters and effective interactions of a model are optimized to precisely reproduce static and dynamic properties of the liquid at one particular thermodynamic state point .",
    "the quality of the model is measured by the range of validity of its predictions in other state points .",
    "unfortunately , there is no water model that is truly transferable , nor can reproduce all the properties of water  @xcite .",
    "many routes have been explored to solve this issue .",
    "molecular polarizability  @xcite is one way to introduce effects not considered by standard pairwise additive potentials . however , polarizable models are computationally very expensive and provide only a partial solution  @xcite .",
    "an alternative way is to include many ",
    "body effects into the potential . in the following",
    "we define a model with an effective many ",
    "body interaction introduced through a cooperative hydrogen bond term .",
    "we consider @xmath49 molecules in a volume @xmath50 with periodic boundary conditions ( p.b.c . ) in two dimensions , and the size of about one single molecule ( and no p.b.c . ) in the third dimension .",
    "we initially consider the case in which the molecules are distributed in a homogeneous way , with each molecule @xmath51 $ ] occupying the same volume @xmath52 larger than a hard  core volume @xmath53  @xmath54 due to short - range electron clouds repulsion .",
    "we consider the case in which each molecule has coordination number four , consistent with the tendency of a water molecule to minimize its energy by forming four hydrogen bonds .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian for water molecules is  @xcite @xmath55 where @xmath56 denotes the sum of all the isotropic interactions ( e. g. van der waals ) between molecules at distance @xmath57 , represented by a lennard  jones potential with attractive energy @xmath58 plus a hard  core at distance @xmath59 .    the second term ( with @xmath60",
    "if @xmath61 and @xmath62 otherwise , and @xmath63 denoting that @xmath64 and @xmath65 are nearest  neighbors ) accounts for the directional contribution to the hydrogen bond energy with strength @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is a ( potts ) variable representing the orientational state of the hydrogen ( or the lone e@xmath68 ) of molecule @xmath64 facing the lone e@xmath68 ( or the hydrogen , respectively ) of the molecules @xmath65 . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we do not distinguish between hydrogen and lone e@xmath68 , associating to each molecule four equivalent bond indices @xmath69 .",
    "we choose the parameter @xmath70 by selecting 30@xmath71 as the maximum deviation from a linear bond , i. e. the o ",
    "h .... o angle is less than 30@xmath71 , as estimated from debye - waller factors @xcite .",
    "hence , @xmath72 and every molecule has @xmath73 possible orientations .",
    "the effect of choosing a different value for @xmath70 has been analyzed in  @xcite .    the third term ( with @xmath74 indicating each of the six different pairs of the four bond indices of molecule @xmath64 ) represents an interaction accounting for the hydrogen bond cooperativity and giving rise to the o  o  o correlation  @xcite , locally driving the molecules toward an ordered ( tetrahedral in the bulk ) configuration with lower energy .",
    "by defining the energy per hydrogen bond ( between @xmath69 and @xmath75 ) as the sum of the interactions in which two bonded molecules ( @xmath64 and @xmath65 ) are participating , we obtain @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the number of cooperative interactions in which that bond variables ( @xmath69 and @xmath75 ) are partaking .",
    "if we choose as parameters @xmath78  kj / mol ( consistent with the value @xmath79 kj / mol of the estimate of the van der waals attraction based on isoelectronic molecules at optimal separation @xcite ) , @xmath80 kj / mol and @xmath81 kj / mol , the values of @xmath82 ranges between @xmath83 and @xmath84 kj / mol depending on @xmath85 .",
    "however , a definition of @xmath82 based on a cluster of @xmath86 or @xmath87 bonded molecules in @xmath883-dimensions increases this range up to @xmath89 or @xmath90 kj / mol , respectively .",
    "therefore , @xmath82 depends on the environment ( the value of @xmath85 and the number of molecules bonded in a cluster ) , as observed in computer simulation of the crystalline phases of ice @xcite , and has values within the range 6.3 @xcite 23.3 kj / mol @xcite , proposed on the base of experiments .",
    "experiments show that formation of the hydrogen bonds leads to an open locally tetrahedral structure that induces an increase of volume per molecule  @xcite .",
    "this effect is incorporated in the model by considering that a full bonded molecule , i. e. a molecule with four hydrogen bonds , has a molecular volume larger than a non - bonded molecule by an amount @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the volume increase per h bond .",
    "hence , if @xmath93 is the total number of hydrogen bonds in the system , the hydrogen bond contribution to the total volume is @xmath94 we adopt @xmath95    consistent with the expected value of the van der waals radius @xcite , and @xmath96 , with @xmath97 , corresponding to a maximum hydrogen bond distance of about @xmath98   , consistent with the range of a water molecule s first coordination shell , @xmath99   , as determined from the oxygen - oxygen radial distribution function @xcite .",
    "the model is studied using both mean  field ( mf ) analysis and monte carlo ( mc ) simulations .",

    "it consists of expressing the molar gibbs free energy in terms of an exact partition function for a portion of the system made of a treatable number of degrees of freedom .",

    "to elucidate the relation between the protein dynamic crossover at about @xmath44  k and the dynamic crossover observed for the average translational correlation time in the first layer of protein hydration water @xcite , we perform mf calculations and mc simulations of the cooperative model of water of section 2.1 .",
    "since we are interested in cases at low humidity , we consider the case of a water monolayer hydrating an immobile surface of globular protein that , forcing the water molecules out of place with respect to crystal configurations , inhibits the crystallization .",
    "we focus on the hydrogen bonds dynamics , regardless if the hydrogen bonds are formed with the protein or among water molecules .      following the work of kumar et al .",
    "@xcite , mazza et al .",
    "@xcite study the orientational correlation time @xmath145 associated with the hydrogen bond dynamics of the model is in section 2.1 .",
    "they confirm the occurrence of a dynamic crossover at a temperature of about @xmath146 corresponding to the @xmath0 of maximum variation of the number of hydrogen bonds , that in turn corresponds to the widom line .",
    "they also confirm that the crossover is from a non  arrhenius behavior at high @xmath0 to another non  arrhenius behavior @xcite , that closely resembles an arrhenius behavior around the crossover .",
    "these results are consistent with those from simulations of other models for hydrated proteins where a crossover in the translational dynamics is observed @xcite .",
    "the difference here is that ( i ) the crossover is for the dynamics of the hydrogen bonds , ( ii ) in the cooperative water model the crossover can be calculated from mf and an exact relation can be found between the crossover and the widom line , and ( iii ) the model can test different hypotheses . in particular ,",
    "kumar et al . have shown that the crossover at @xmath146 is independent of whether water at very low temperature is characterized by a llcp or is sf .",
    "in fact , the crossover is a consequence of the sharp change in the average number of hydrogen bonds at the temperature of the specific heat maximum , that occurs in both scenarios .",
    "kumar et al .",
    "were able also to make predictions about the @xmath15dependence of quantities characterizing the crossover at @xmath146 : ( i ) the time scale of the crossover , showing that it is independent of @xmath15 ( isochronic crossover ) ; ( ii ) the activation energy of the apparent arrhenius behavior at low @xmath0 and ( iii ) the crossover temperature , showing that both ( ii ) and ( iii ) decrease linearly upon increasing @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "these predictions have been confirmed by chu et al .",
    "@xcite in a study on the dynamics of a hydrated protein under moderately high pressures at low temperatures using the quasielastic neutron scattering method .",
    "they relate these predictions ( i)(iii ) to the mechanical response of the protein to an external force , that is the average elastic constant calculated from the mean square displacement of the protein atoms . in particular , the degree of `` softness '' of the protein , related to the enzymatic activity , is preserved at lower @xmath0 if the pressure is increased @xcite . however , a criterion proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite for discriminating which scenario better describe water on the basis of the crossover at @xmath146 , can not be tested in the experiments since the predicted difference between the two scenarios ( of the order of 1% ) is within the error bars of the measurements @xcite .",
    "the answer to the puzzle of which of the scenarios better describe water might be related to the very recent experimental discovery of another crossover for the hydrogen bond @xmath145 to an arrhenius behavior at very low @xmath0 , of the order of @xmath147  k at hydration @xmath40 g h@xmath37o / g .",
    "this crossover has been observed by mazza et al . at @xmath148 @xcite , in relation to an ordering process of the hydrogen bonds leading to the hdl - ldl critical point .",
    "the study has been possible thanks to the use of a highly efficient cluster mc dynamics @xcite .",
    "this very  low @xmath0 crossover would reduce even more the @xmath0 at which the proteins preserve their `` softness '' , essential for their correct functionality .      by considering partially hydrated hydrophobic plates at a distance such to inhibit the crystallization of water at low @xmath0 , franzese and de los santos @xcite",
    "have show that water has a glassy behavior @xcite for both the translational and rotational degrees of freedom when cooled down to a low @xmath15 .",
    "this result is consistent with simulations of tip4p water forming a quasi-2d amorphous when confined in a hydrophobic slit pore with wall - to - wall separation just enough to accommodate two molecular layers @xcite .    at higher @xmath15",
    "the hydrogen bond network builds up in a less gradual way , allowing the system to equilibrate the rotational degrees of freedom also at very low @xmath0 , but not the translational degrees of freedom .",
    "this effect is emphasized by the appearance of many dehydrated regions @xcite , as also observed in water confined between two protein - like hydrophobic flattened surfaces at distances ranging from @xmath149 to @xmath150  nm @xcite .",
    "when @xmath15 is close to the llcp value , the cooperativity of the hydrogen bond network induces a strong non - exponential behavior @xcite for the hydrogen bond correlation function .",
    "however , both rotational and translational degrees of freedom equilibrate within the simulation time . at higher @xmath15",
    "the rotational correlation function recovers the exponential behavior and the diffusion of the system allows the formation a large dry cavity , while the rest of the surface is well hydrated .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the cooperative model allows to calculate , in the mf approximation , the diffusion constant at any @xmath0 and @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the hydrophobic confinement has effects also on water thermodynamics .",
    "it shifts the hdl - ldl phase transition to lower temperature and lower pressure compared to bulk water when the confinement is between plates @xcite .",
    "moreover , it shifts both the line of maximum density and the liquid - to - gas spinodal toward higher pressures and lower temperatures with respect to bulk when the confinement is in a hydrophobic disordered matrix of soft spheres @xcite .",
    "this result is confirmed also in the analysis performed by using the cooperative water model in confinement between hydrophobic hard spheres @xcite .",
    "however , the effect of the matrix on the hdl - ldl critical point is less clear and is presently under investigation .",
    "the effect of confinement is of great interest to biology , chemistry , and engineering , yet the recent experimental and simulations results are object of an intense debate .",
    "a better understanding of the physico  chemical properties of liquid water at interfaces is important to provide accurate predictions of the behavior of biological molecules @xcite , including the folding - unfolding transitions seen in proteins @xcite , and the dynamical behavior of dna  @xcite .",
    "however , it is still unclear whether such behaviors are inherent in the structure of such molecules , or an effect of water in which they are always found , or due to the interactions between the two .    to get insight into this subject the formulation of a model that allows",
    "the development of a theory could be useful to find functional relations connecting different observables .",
    "the advantage of this approach is to have two independent ways of approaching the problem , one theoretical and the other numerical .",
    "we have presented here several recent results obtained with a cooperative water model suitable for studies with mean field theories and with @xmath49 , @xmath15 , @xmath0 simulations with thousands of molecules . the model has been studies in the context of water monolayers on hydrated proteins , between hydrophobic surfaces or in a hydrophobic matrix .    some of the conclusions reached with this model are the following .    * the different scenarios proposed to interpret the low-@xmath0 behavior of water are instances of the same mechanism , with different values of the directional ( covalent ) strength and the cooperative ( many - body ) interaction of the hydrogen bonds .",
    "the parameters that can be estimated from the experiments suggest that the scenario with the llcp is the most plausible for water .",
    "* previous experiments showing one dynamic crossover in the water monolayer hydrating proteins , rna and dna are consistent with ( at least ) two scenarios . *",
    "the possibility of a second dynamic crossovers detectable at lower @xmath0 and lower hydration level would be consistent only with the llcp scenario , because its origin would be related to the ordering of the hydrogen bond network .",
    "* a consequence of the occurrence of a llcp should be detectable when the translational and rotational dynamics of water are studied for a monolayer in a hydrophobic confinement .",
    "in particular , the rotational dynamics should appear with the strongest non - exponential behavior in the vicinity of the llcp , as an effect of the cooperativity .",
    "moreover , the slow increase of the number of hydrogen bonds at ow @xmath0 and low @xmath15 is the cause of the formation of an amorphous glassy state when the confinement is such that to inhibit the crystallization of water . under this conditions ,",
    "the dehydration of hydrophobic surfaces is characterized by the appearance of heterogeneities and cavitation . *",
    "the hydrophobic confinement affects the thermodynamics of water by lowering the @xmath0 and increasing the @xmath15 of the liquid - gas phase transition and of the tmd line .",
    "it also affects the ldl - hdl phase transition in a way that is possibly more complex .",
    "all these results are potentially relevant in problems such as the protein denaturation or the protein aggregation .",
