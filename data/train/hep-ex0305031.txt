    "many searches for massive new particles predicted by extensions to the standard model ( sm ) assume that these particles decay promptly at the primary interaction vertex .",
    "such searches are not sensitive to long - lived heavy particles which do not decay within the detectors .",
    "there exist , however , a number of models which predict such long - lived particles .",
    "for example , in the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model ( cmssm ) , for certain choices of the parameters , sleptons or charginos could be long - lived  @xcite .",
    "r - parity violating supersymmetric ( susy ) models  @xcite also allow for long - lived heavy particles and a fourth - generation heavy lepton could be stable  @xcite . in gauge - mediated supersymmetry , if the susy - breaking energy scale is sufficiently high  @xcite , sleptons could be long - lived . some models beyond the sm",
    "also predict the existence of particles with fractional electric charge .",
    "previous searches for long - lived massive charged particles have been performed by the lep collaborations with data taken at the z@xmath87 resonance  @xcite , as well as with data taken at higher centre - of - mass energies , up to 209  gev  @xcite .",
    "this paper describes an update to a search for long - lived particles , referred to here as x@xmath88 , with @xmath89 , and charge @xmath0  =  1 or 2/3 , pair - produced in the reaction @xmath90 .",
    "this search has been described in detail in  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we also search for particles with fractional charges 4/3 and 5/3 .",
    "all fractionally - charged particles are assumed to be colourless and non - strongly - interacting . to make the search for these particles as model independent as possible ,",
    "only minimal calorimetric information has been used . due to their large mass",
    "these particles would have anomalously high or low ionization energy loss @xmath91 in the tracking chambers .",
    "this search is therefore primarily based on the precise @xmath91 measurement provided by the opal jet chamber .",
    "the data were collected by the opal detector during 1995 - 2000 , at centre - of - mass energies from 130  gev to 209  gev corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of 693.1  pb@xmath92 as reported in table  [ tab : cands ] .",
    "a complete description of the opal detector can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "only a brief overview is given .",
    "the central detector comprised a system of tracking chambers , providing track reconstruction over 96% of the full solid angle inside a 0.435  t uniform magnetic field parallel to the beam axis .",
    "it consisted of a two - layer silicon microstrip vertex detector , a high - precision vertex drift chamber ( cv ) with axial and stereo wires , a large - volume jet chamber and a set of @xmath93-chambers measuring the track coordinates along the beam direction .",
    "the jet chamber ( cj ) is the most important detector for this analysis .",
    "it was divided into 24 azimuthal sectors , each equipped with 159 sense wires . up",
    "to 159 position and @xmath91 measurements per track were thus possible , with a precision of @xmath94 m and @xmath95  6  cm . when a track was matched with @xmath93-chamber hits and hits on the stereo wires of the vertex chamber ( cv ) , the uncertainty on its @xmath93 coordinate was @xmath96  1  mm .",
    "the tracking detectors , located inside the magnet coil , provided a track momentum measurement with a resolution of @xmath97 for tracks with the full number of hits ( @xmath98 , in gev , is the momentum transverse to the beam direction ) and a resolution on the ionization energy loss measurement of approximately @xmath99 for @xmath100 events with a large number of usable hits for @xmath91 measurement  @xcite .",
    "a lead - glass electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecal ) located outside the magnet coil covered the full azimuthal range with good hermeticity in the polar angle range of @xmath101 .",
    "the magnet return yoke was instrumented for hadron calorimetry covering the region @xmath102 and was surrounded by four layers of muon chambers .",
    "electromagnetic calorimeters close to the beam axis completed the geometrical acceptance down to 24 mrad on both sides of the interaction point .",
    "the ionization energy loss @xmath91 produced by a charged particle is a function of the electric charge @xmath103 and of @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the momentum and @xmath106 the mass of the particle  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : dedx - demo ] shows the distribution of @xmath91 as a function of the apparent momentum , @xmath107 .",
    "standard particles of charge @xmath51 ( e , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , p , k ) with high momentum ( @xmath110 ) have @xmath91 between 9 and 11  kev / cm .",
    "massive particles with charge @xmath51 are expected to yield @xmath111  kev / cm for high - mass values , @xmath112 , or @xmath113  kev / cm for low - mass values , @xmath114 .",
    "the @xmath91 measurement therefore provides a good tool for particle identification in these high- and low - mass regions .",
    "massive particles with charge @xmath52/3 would have @xmath111  kev / cm for high mass values , @xmath115 or @xmath113  kev / cm for low - mass values , @xmath116 .",
    "the expected @xmath91 for massive particles of charge @xmath54/3 and @xmath55/3 is greater than 11 kev / cm for all mass ranges .",
    "the search for massive particles with charge @xmath51/3 was not possible because the typical @xmath91 deposit of these particles would be too close to the instrumental noise level .",
    "several different monte carlo programs were used to generate the signal process @xmath117 .",
    "signal events of the type @xmath118 ( @xmath119 being a charged scalar lepton ) were generated at several centre - of - mass energies up to 206 gev using susygen  @xcite .",
    "the generated charged scalar leptons are not allowed to decay , therefore simulating a signal from heavy charged stable scalar particles .",
    "similarly , events of the type @xmath120 and @xmath121 , where l@xmath88 are stable heavy spin-1/2 leptons , and q ,  @xmath122 are colourless stable heavy spin-1/2 particles with charge 2/3 , 4/3 , and 5/3 , were generated at the same energies , using the exotic  @xcite generator .",
    "all signal samples were generated with 1000 events per mass point with mass @xmath123 ranging from 45  gev to the kinematic limit for the centre - of - mass energy considered .",
    "the mass points were generated every 5 gev with a finer binning of 1 gev in the mass regions where we expect lower selection efficiencies .",
    "for the purpose of detector simulation and particle interactions , all particles were treated as heavy muons .",
    "the simulation of @xmath91 in the central jet chamber of opal accounted for the charge , mass and momentum of the particle , as described above .",
    "the background was estimated using simulations of all standard model processes ( two - fermion , four - fermion and two - photon processes ) for all centre - of - mass energies from 130 to 206  gev .",
    "small differences in the centre - of - mass energies of data and background monte carlo samples have a negligible effect on the analysis .",
    "the contribution to the background from two - fermion final states was estimated using bhwide  @xcite for the @xmath4 final states and koralz  @xcite and kk2f  @xcite for the @xmath100 and @xmath124 states .",
    "hadronic two - fermion events , @xmath125 , were simulated using pythia  @xcite .",
    "for the two - photon background , the pythia  @xcite , phojet  @xcite and herwig  @xcite monte carlo generators were used for @xmath126 final states and the vermaseren  @xcite and the bdk  @xcite generators for all @xmath127 final states .",
    "four - fermion final states were simulated with grc4f  @xcite , which takes into account interference between all diagrams . all generated signal and background events were processed through the full simulation of the opal detector  @xcite ; the same event analysis chain was applied to the simulated events and to the data .",
    "pair - produced stable or long - lived massive charged particles would manifest themselves in events with two back - to - back tracks . assuming they would not interact strongly , these particles would not produce hadronic showers . since they are massive , they would not produce electromagnetic showers either . for these reasons , the considered events would be very similar to @xmath100 events , the only difference being the higher mass of the particles , which yields a different @xmath91 for the same momentum .",
    "a preselection similar to the one described in  @xcite is used for the analyses .",
    "several criteria have been loosened in order to increase the sensitivity to high - mass particles .",
    "the criteria are listed below :    * events are rejected if the total multiplicity of tracks in the central detector and clusters in the ecal is greater than 26 .",
    "cosmic ray events are rejected as in  @xcite .",
    "bhabha events are identified by requiring two energetic and collinear clusters in the electromagnetic calorimeter , these events are then rejected .",
    "* events are required to contain at least two tracks in the central detector , each satisfying basic quality criteria and having a momentum @xmath128 , a momentum transverse to the beam axis @xmath129 , a polar angle satisfying @xmath130 and at least 20 cj hits usable for @xmath91 measurement .",
    "the two selected tracks are required to have opposite electric charge . * to reduce background from two - photon events , the total visible energy of the event is required to be @xmath131 and the acoplanarity angle , is defined as 180@xmath132 minus the angle between the two tracks in the @xmath133 plane . ] between the two tracks is required to be @xmath134 .",
    "* events containing an isolated ecal cluster with an energy greater than 5  gev are rejected to reduce background from events with initial state radiation .",
    "isolation is defined as an angular separation of more than @xmath135 from the closest track . *",
    "it is required that @xmath136 , where @xmath137 are the momenta of the two selected tracks and @xmath138 denote the energies of the ecal clusters associated to the tracks .",
    "this further reduces the contribution from bhabha scattering events .",
    "no other tracks with @xmath139  gev and no unassociated clusters with @xmath140  gev should be found in a cone of @xmath141 half - opening angle around each of the two selected tracks .",
    "criterion p5 is not used in the fractionally - charged particles analysis since their interaction properties with the calorimeters are unknown .",
    "this reduces the dependence on calorimeter response around the candidate tracks .    after the preselection , the background is dominated by @xmath142 events , with a small contribution from @xmath143 and two - photon @xmath144 events .",
    "the effect of the preselection cuts on the all data samples and various monte carlo background processes , for the search for @xmath145  1 particles , is shown in table  [ tab : cutflow206.6 ] .    .",

    "all results obtained are valid for non - strongly - interacting colourless particles with a lifetime longer than 10@xmath6  s. this lifetime restriction is obtained by considering the heaviest ( and therefore slowest ) particles excluded by this search , and then requiring that the decay probability of these particles at a flight distance larger than 3.0  m be greater than 95% . for lower mass values",
