    "how genotypes map onto phenotypes is one of the central questions in biology .",
    "developmental and systems biologists seek to understand the physical , biochemical and physiological basis of the genotype - phenotype map , while evolutionary biologists study its evolutionary causes and consequences @xcite .",
    "to predict the evolutionary fate of a genotype it is essential to understand how genotypes map onto fitness  the basic predictor of an organism s evolutionary success .",
    "this has led to the notion of a fitness landscape @xcite , which is a mapping from the multidimensional genotype space to a real - valued measure of fitness .",
    "graphical renderings often depict the fitness landscape as a surface above a two - dimensional base plane symbolizing the genotype space , but it is clear that such a low - dimensional representation is generally inadequate to provide more than a rather superficial , metaphoric description of the evolutionary process ( for an alternative visualization see fig.[fig:1 ] ) .",
    "the limitations of the two - dimensional representation have spawned much fundamental criticism of the fitness landscape concept . here , rather than abandoning the concept altogether ,",
    "we take the view that _  fitness landscapes ... should be studied in less picturesque but more quantitative ways  _ @xcite .    within the fitness landscape metaphor ,",
    "adaptation is imagined as a hill - climbing process leading the population to a fitness peak , with distinct roles for both natural selection and genetic drift @xcite .",
    "the structure of the fitness landscape can range from smooth with few accessible peaks to rugged with multiple peaks separated by valleys of low fitness . whether the landscape is smooth or rugged",
    "has important consequences for evolution @xcite .",
    "for instance , the topography of the fitness landscape affects speciation via reproductive isolation @xcite , the evolutionary benefits of sex and recombination @xcite , the evolution of genetic robustness and evolvability @xcite , and the predictability of evolution @xcite .",
    "little is known about the factors that determine the topography of a fitness landscape , beyond the general notion that _ epistasis _ is involved .",
    "the term epistasis as defined by fisher @xcite includes all deviations from the additive effects of alleles at different loci , and is usually considered for two alleles only . to understand the role of epistasis in shaping the structure of fitness landscapes we need to distinguish between _ magnitude _ and _ sign",
    "_ epistasis @xcite .",
    "magnitude epistasis is present when the fitness effect of a mutation at a given locus has a definite sign ( beneficial or deleterious ) irrespective of the alleles at other loci , while the magnitude depends on the genetic background .",
    "magnitude epistasis does not constrain accessibility of mutational trajectories in an absolute sense and only affects the curvature of a landscape , which can be quantified by a quadratic regression of mean fitness on mutation number . on the other hand ,",
    "sign epistasis occurs when mutations are beneficial in some genetic backgrounds , but not in others .",
    "hence , the sign ( positive or negative ) of an allelic effect changes with the presence of an allele at another locus .",
    "sign epistasis causes pathways to become inaccessible by natural selection and thus introduces ruggedness into the landscapes @xcite . a special case of sign epistasis , called reciprocal sign epistasis ,",
    "occurs when the sign of both alleles fitness effects changes with a change of alleles at the other locus .",
    "reciprocal sign epistasis is a prerequisite for the occurrence of multiple fitness peaks @xcite .",
    "a related but distinct classification of epistatic interactions discerns between unidimensional and multidimensional epistasis @xcite . in the unidimensional case fitness",
    "can be written in terms of a scalar function of the genotype , such as the number of loci carrying a mutation , whereas multidimensional epistasis includes all allelic interactions .",
    "generic fitness landscapes are expected to display both sign epistasis and multidimensional epistasis .",
    "nevertheless , in empirical studies a unidimensional fitness function has often been _ assumed _ by averaging over different allelic combinations carrying the same number of mutations .",
    "such an approach can be misleading , because a seemingly additive unidimensional fitness landscape may result from the cancellation of multidimensional epistatic interactions @xcite .",
    "genotypes are represented by binary sequences , where 0 ( 1 ) indicates the absence ( presence ) of the corresponding mutation .",
    "arrows point in the direction of increasing fitness , and underlined nodes correspond to fitness maxima .",
    "colored arrows point towards the fittest neighbor , forming the basins of attraction of a steepest ascent ( `` greedy '' ) adaptive walk .",
    "( a ) fitness landscape based on four beneficial mutations in the bacterium _ methylbacterium extorquens _",
    "@xcite ( landscape a in tables [ table1 ] and [ table2 ] ) .",
    "( b ) fitness landscape based on four mutations in a malaria drug resistance gene @xcite .",
    "the fourfold mutant @xmath0 confers maximal drug resistance but does not optimize the growth rate in the absence of the drug , which is the quantity used here as a proxy for fitness ( landscape d in tables [ table1 ] and [ table2 ] ) . ]    in theory , with full knowledge of a fitness landscape , one overlooks all possible evolutionary pathways connecting two genotypes , and would be able to determine the likelihood that particular pathways are taken .",
    "this would render evolution predictable in a restricted ( i.e. , _ a posteriori _ ) sense .",
    "however , these predictions are valid for a specific combination of genotype and environment , and also depend on population dynamic parameters such as population size and mutation rate .",
    "another limitation is that one can only study a tiny part of sequence space explicitly , because the number of genotypes grows beyond comprehension with the number of loci considered . even for a single gene of 1000 base - pairs and when allowing only point mutations , the number of possible genotypes ( @xmath1 ) is larger than the total number of particles in the universe , as sewall wright @xcite realized .",
    "this scale problem has two immediate implications .",
    "first , it emphasizes the fundamentally stochastic nature of evolution , given how little of genotype space has been probed by life since it exists .",
    "second , if we are to use the growing amount of information about the genetic make - up of organisms to understand and ultimately predict evolution , we need to invoke models of fitness landscapes parametrized by empirical observations .",
    "the purpose of this review is to compare the topographies of empirical fitness landscapes that recently have been published . before doing so , we briefly survey the main models of fitness landscapes in which ruggedness can be tuned , as well as the different approaches to study fitness landscapes empirically .",
    "recent efforts have been directed towards constructing all @xmath2 possible genotypes containing combinations of a limited set of @xmath3 mutations , and measuring their fitness or a proxy thereof @xcite , see fig.[fig:1 ] for two examples .",
    "first , we compare different measures of ruggedness and sign epistasis derived from the available landscapes , and find that these correlate well and thus appear to be equivalent .",
    "second , using these robust measures of ruggedness we can compare the ruggedness of different empirical landscapes despite of methodological differences and the variety of biological systems involved .",
    "we find that those landscapes built from mutations that are known to have a combined beneficial effect are less rugged than those built from mutations that are selected without regard to their combined effect , in particular when they are deleterious .",
    "third , we compare the empirical fitness landscapes to a simple statistical one - parameter model , the rough mt .",
    "fuji model , which combines a linear fitness trend with uncorrelated random fitness variations .",
    "we find that this model captures the features of the empirical landscapes surprisingly well .",
    "until recently empirical information about the structure of fitness landscapes was largely unavailable , and the number of studies is currently still small . therefore , past studies of fitness landscapes have been mostly restricted to theoretical work .",
    "the models proposed in this context are based on very different - and sometimes even contradicting - intuitions . in this section ,",
    "we give a brief overview of the most popular models . throughout",
    "we represent genotypes by binary strings @xmath4 of length @xmath3 , where @xmath5 ( 1 ) if the mutation at the @xmath6-th locus is absent ( present ) , compare to fig.[fig:1 ] .",
    "if a given gene @xmath8 , when expressed , produces an essential protein that requires the presence of another protein produced by gene @xmath9 to function properly , these two genes interact epistatically . when gene @xmath8 is expressed independently of gene @xmath9 , an organism with a defective mutation in gene @xmath9 incurs the cost of producing the protein from gene @xmath8 without experiencing its beneficial effect . the mutation in gene @xmath9 can thus change the fitness contribution of gene @xmath8 from beneficial to deleterious , resulting in sign epistasis .",
    "the main motivation of the @xmath7 model model ' .",
    "the present designation , first adopted in @xcite , is motivated by the fact that the letter @xmath10 denotes population size in much of the population genetic literature .",
    "the number of loci is therefore more appropriately named @xmath3 .",
    "] as proposed by kauffman and weinberger @xcite is to capture such strong , sign - epistatic effects of single mutations in interacting genes on fitness in a statistical sense , without attempting a detailed biochemical description .",
    "the interactions are modeled as evenly spread across the entire genome .",
    "the genome is represented as a binary sequence of length @xmath3 and the interactions take the form of a set of sites called interaction partners @xmath11 associated with each site @xmath6 of the genome .",
    "the number @xmath12 of interaction partners is kept constant .",
    "how partner sites are assigned has implications for search strategies for the global optimum on the landscapes @xcite , but most often the interaction partners are chosen by picking them uniformly and independently at random ( making sure that no site appears twice in a given set @xmath13 ) .",
    "the fitness of an organism with genome @xmath14 is then the sum of the individual fitness contributions , @xmath15 the single site contributions @xmath16 are independent and identically distributed random variables ( i.i.d .",
    "rv s ) associated with each of the @xmath17 possible states of the argument . if a mutation hits part of the sequence that does not appear in the argument of @xmath18 , i.e. if the mutation does not involve the site @xmath6 or any of the associated partner sites in @xmath19 , the fitness contribution @xmath16 remains unchanged , otherwise it is replaced by an independent random number .    for @xmath20 , each contribution",
    "@xmath16 can only take two possible values , corresponding to @xmath21 or @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "thus each site has one state that is more beneficial than the other and since the fitness of a sequence is the sum over the site contributions , the global optimum is at the state with all sites in their ` beneficial ' position .",
    "the global optimum can be reached from any initial configuration by mutating sites into their beneficial state in a random order , which implies that all mutational pathways are accessible and sign epistasis is absent .",
    "conversely , when @xmath23 , the entire sequence appears in the argument of each single site contribution .",
    "thus any mutation replaces the sum ( [ lk_fitness_sum ] ) by a sum over a different set of i.i.d .",
    "rv s , which is equivalent to replacing one i.i.d .",
    "rv by another .",
    "the number of sites in the partner set , denoted by @xmath12 , thus allows one to tune the strength of epistatic interactions from the non - epistatic limit @xmath20 to the maximally epistatic case @xmath23 .",
    "the @xmath20 limit of the @xmath7 model can be compared to a smooth ( though not necessarily symmetric ) mountain much like the mt .",
    "fuji volcano in japan .",
    "this type of fitness landscape is therefore sometimes referred to as ` mt fuji ' landscape .",
    "the other extreme ( @xmath23 ) corresponds to a maximally rugged landscape of independent fitness contributions and is referred to as ` house of cards ' ( hoc ) landscape @xcite - model is a close relative of the @xmath24-spin model @xcite . ] .",
    "intermediate values of @xmath12 correspond to an intermediate degree of ruggedness .",
    "an alternative way to obtain landscapes with intermediate ruggedness is to pick one genotype @xmath25 as point of reference and then impose an external ` fitness field ' of strength @xmath26 favoring this reference configuration on top of random i.i.d .  contributions .",
    "then the fitness of a genotype @xmath14 is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes the hamming distance between the two configurations and @xmath29 is a random variable picked independently for each genotype .",
    "this is a simplified version of the rough mount fuji model as originally introduced in @xcite , which has also been used in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . if the i.i.d .",
    "part of the fitness fluctuates on a scale @xmath30 , the landscape will be dominated by the external field and appear like a smooth landscape for @xmath31 , while the random contributions will dominate for @xmath32 , making the landscape appear maximally rugged .",
    "note that the model assumes that the mean fitness profile ( averaged over the random fitness component @xmath33 ) is linear , and thereby ignores unidimensional magnitude epistasis .",
    "however , since our main interest is in measures of landscape ruggedness , the mean curvature of the landscape is not relevant . in section [ subsec:3.2 ]",
    ", we will compare measures of epistasis and landscape ruggedness for empirical data to those obtained for landscapes constructed with the rmf model ( [ rmf_fitness_sum ] ) , choosing a gaussian distribution with standard deviation @xmath30 for the i.i.d .",
    "random variables @xmath29 .",
    "a different intuition than used for the @xmath7 and rmf models is that the actual fitness matters little compared to the question whether or not a given organism is viable at all .",
    "the genome is composed of a large number of mutually interacting elements and a random mutation in any given gene can alter gene function up to the point where a gene does no longer function .",
    "it has therefore been postulated that fitness landscapes are dominated by large valleys of lethality and extended ridges of viability @xcite . in the simplest",
    "setting each genotype @xmath14 has either fitness @xmath22 ( i.e.  is viable ) with probability @xmath24 or has fitness @xmath34 ( not viable ) with probability @xmath35 , independent of other states .",
    "the resulting fitness landscape is then equivalent to a realization of the site percolation problem @xcite on an @xmath3-dimensional hypercube @xcite .",
    "this type of model can be combined with the models described in the preceding subsections by introducing a fraction of non - viable genotypes in addition to the epistatically interacting viable genotypes , see @xcite .",
    "the models described so far intend to incorporate known aspects of the biochemical or biological interactions shaping the fitness of a given organism while keeping the number of parameters to a minimum .",
    "another strategy is to explicitly incorporate physical , chemical and biological mechanisms underlying epistasis into an explicit genotype - phenotype map @xcite .",
    "such models have been based , for example , on the thermodynamics of rna secondary structure @xcite or the biophysics of binding between a transcription factor and its binding site @xcite .",
    "while the development of such models constitutes an active branch of research , they are too complex and specific for the type of analyses that are of interest in the context of this review .",
    "several approaches have been used to infer topographical properties of real fitness landscapes from empirical observations ; these can be roughly classified into three categories .",
    "studies in the first category use the repeatability of adaptation observed in microbial evolution experiments to qualitatively assess local ruggedness of fitness landscapes .",
    "studies in the second category focus on detecting sign epistasis between mutations to infer local ruggedness .",
    "the third category includes a limited , but growing number of studies that explicitly quantify the multidimensional fitness landscape by considering all @xmath2 combinations of a small set of @xmath3 mutations .",
    "the topographical information revealed by the first two approaches is necessarily limited , but reflects the contribution of a large number of mutations , while the third category yields more detailed information , but from a tiny predefined part of genotype space . in the next section",
    ", we will briefly review several studies from the first two categories , and then present a more extensive analysis of available studies from the third category .      by allowing replicate populations of microbes to evolve under identical conditions in the laboratory ,",
    "the dynamics and repeatability of adaptation can be quantified and used to infer the general ruggedness of the fitness landscape involved @xcite .",
    "one expectation is that a rugged landscape leads to a stronger and more sustained divergence of fitness trajectories than a smooth landscape .",
    "this has been found when comparing bacteria evolving in a structured and a non - structured habitat @xcite , or in a complex relative to a simple nutrient environment @xcite .",
    "another expectation is that only on rugged landscapes the ability to adapt depends on the local mutational neighborhood of a genotype .",
    "in contrast , all genotypes except the globally optimal genotype are able to adapt on a smooth single - peaked landscape .",
    "support for this expectation comes from a study with rna bacteriophage @xmath366 , where only one of two related genotypes was able to adapt under identical conditions @xcite , and from a study with hiv-1 where adaptation to one host - cell type could only be realized indirectly through adaptation to another host - cell environment @xcite .",
    "another prediction for rugged landscapes is that higher levels of adaptation diminish the ability to adapt to different niches , which was found in a study with biofilm - producing bacteria @xcite .",
    "finally , the short adaptive walks found in recent experiments with fungi @xcite also suggest that their fitness landscape is rugged @xcite .",
    "attempts to infer topographical information from the dynamics and repeatability of adaptation necessarily suffers from being non - systematic . because such studies reveal only those parts of the fitness landscape that have actually been probed , they are unable to quantify the ruggedness of the landscape .",
    "for instance , the observed adaptive dynamics may suggest that there are no strong epistatic constraints , while the population may have traveled along a rare ridge of high fitness within a rugged landscape .",
    "conclusions also depend on the type of mutations used by evolution , which are specific for the population dynamic regime that prevailed .",
    "for instance , in large populations where clonal interference plays a major role , large - effect mutations will dominate @xcite and their epistatic properties may be different from smaller - effect beneficial mutations , or even neutral or deleterious mutations that may contribute under different conditions @xcite . on the other hand , these approaches may probe a more extended area of genotype space than the more systematic approach of mutant construction involving a predefined and small set of mutations , which is discussed in sect .",
    "[ subsec:3.2 ] .",
    "epistasis has a clear link to ruggedness of fitness landscapes .",
    "several studies confirmed the role of epistasis in causing adaptive constraints and local ruggedness by using isolated or constructed mutants in replay experiments to test their evolutionary consequences @xcite .",
    "studies which examine pairwise interactions within sets of mutations often detect sign epistasis , and also provide information regarding its frequency @xcite , implying that local ruggedness is not uncommon .",
    "for example , a study on beneficial mutations that increase the growth rate of the ssdna microvirid bacteriophage id11 found significant evidence for sign epistasis in six out of 18 constructed combinations @xcite .",
    "a study by sanjuan et al .",
    "@xcite on vesicular stomatitis virus identified five out of 15 cases in which the combination of two mutations was less fit than either of the single mutants .",
    "apart from studies that focus on a relatively small number of well - characterized mutations , the ubiquity of ( pairwise ) epistatic interactions has also been documented in recent genome - wide surveys @xcite .",
    "mutation combinations for which sign epistasis is identified point to the local ruggedness of the fitness landscape , but do not reveal the global structure of the landscape @xcite .",

    "the existence of sign epistatic interactions between mutations reveals that landscape topography can be rugged , but a more systematic approach is required to quantify the degree of ruggedness of fitness landscapes , and to determine how this constrains evolution .",
    "given the large number of publications on fitness landscapes , the number of studies on empirical fitness landscapes is remarkably small .",
    "full information is available when the fitness of all @xmath2 combinations of a set of @xmath3 mutations is known . at present ,",
    "available empirical landscapes stem from a variety of systems and involve small numbers ( i.e. , 4 - 9 ) of mutations ( see table [ table1 ] ) . in reality ,",
    "adaptation proceeds by selection on all possible mutations in the genome and is not necessarily limited to such a small subset .",
    "these landscapes thus only offer a glimpse of the ruggedness within the immense genotype space . given this limitation , we can not compare ruggedness between different empirical fitness landscapes without a clear view on which mutations are involved and which part of genotype space is being mapped .",
    "as it turns out - despite of their low number - the available landscapes are rather different in several aspects , and include mutations in single genes versus whole genomes , with fitness effects that in some cases are known _ a priori _ to be beneficial or deleterious ( for individual mutations or for the combination studied ) and in other cases emerge only _ a posteriori_. for each of the empirical landscape studies included in our analyses ( and a few which we did not include ) , table [ table1 ] summarizes the main characteristics .",
    "various statistical measures have been proposed to quantify the ruggedness of fitness landscapes .",
    "most studies focused on different aspects of landscape topography and a variety of measures has consequently been applied . here",
    ", we aim to analyze all landscapes using a common and standardized selection of measures .",
    "this enables a comparison between landscapes , but also allows us to verify whether model landscapes actually capture the topography of the empirical landscapes .",
    "furthermore , we explore the correlations between the different measures of ruggedness to see whether they are equivalent or yield complementary information about the topography of real fitness landscapes . in total , we use six measures for our analyses :    * the _ roughness to slope ratio _ , @xmath38 , was introduced in @xcite and used in @xcite .",
    "this ratio measures how well the landscape can be described by a linear model , which corresponds to the purely additive ( non - epistatic ) limit . it is obtained by fitting a multidimensional linear model to the empirical fitness landscape by means of a least - square fit .",

    "recall that the increase of @xmath26 from 0 to @xmath86 corresponds to the transformation from a completely rugged to a perfectly additive landscape .",

    "subgraph analysis of fitness landscapes was introduced in @xcite as a means to probe the effect of the mutational distance scale within a fitness landscape . here a subgraph of size @xmath89 is the hypercube spanned by all @xmath90 combinations of @xmath89 out of @xmath3 mutations . for landscapes of size",

    "for the landscapes of size @xmath88 ( a , c , and d ) the calculated values refer to the complete landscape .",
    "furthermore , one should keep in mind that the fit to the multi - dimensional linear model and the fourier analysis presume that mutations interact additively in absence of epistasis .",
    "how the effects of mutations add up in the interaction free case will , however , depend on the quantity one measures as a proxy of fitness .",
    "for example , when the linear model is fitted to the landscape e of @xcite , which is based on measures of the minimal inhibitory concentration ( mic ) of an antibiotic , systematic deviations from the measured landscape result .",
    "a much better fit was obtained by considering the logarithms of the same mic values , implying that , in this case , the interaction - free landscape is closer to a multiplicative than an additive model ( see fig .  [ fig:3 ] ) .",
    "since there is no general theory predicting how mutational effects should combine for the different proxies of fitness , we consistently applied the logarithmic transformation .",
    "for all fitness measurements based on concentrations of drugs or toxins that limit growth or survival , like mic values , the logarithms much improve the fit to the linear model . in the other cases",

    "the cause is either non - viability of those genotypes ( dataset h ) or unobserved genotypes ( dataset i - j ) . in the latter case , we assume that the unobserved genotypes were missed by chance @xcite .",
    "we therefore replaced the missing measurements by values obtained from the fitted multidimensional linear model and subsequently performed the logarithmic transformation .",

    "genotypes on the basis of a statistical analysis @xcite .",
    "a non - viable genotype would imply a logarithmic fitness equal to minus infinity . to circumvent this issue",

    "is expected to have a trade - off in the absence of the drug and since growth rates were determined under these conditions , the included mutations are no longer beneficial . given the tendency that landscapes from beneficial mutations are more smooth , it is not surprising that the growth rate landscape d is more rugged than the resistance landscape c. landscapes e and f are based on a genotype with multiple mutations that is selected because of the increased resistance to a particular @xmath37-lactam antibiotic , cefotaxime .",
    "the fitness proxy used to construct landscape e is cefotaxime resistance , whereas in landscape f it is resistance to another antibiotic , piperacillin , which was not involved in the selection of the genotypes . however , the reason why they were measured in the piperacillin environment ( with inhibitor ) is because resistance in this environment showed an overall trade - off with cefotaxime resistance .",

    "we thereby fixed the parameter controlling the roughness of the landscape to @xmath94 , and calculated all measures for various choices of the slope @xmath26 .",

    "the letters represent the measurements from the experimental landscapes ( see table [ table2 ] ) .",
    "the close correspondence between the letters and the line indicates that the rmf model captures the different ruggedness measures and their correlations observed for the experimental landscapes surprisingly well .",
    "the relatively large deviations for landscapes c and d from @xcite are most likely due to the fact that this is a 4-locus landscape and measurements are thus based on a single observation , rather than being an average over multiple subgraphs of size @xmath92 as is the case for the larger landscapes .",
    "we also note that the number of crossing paths @xmath81 observed in the empirical landscapes appears to be systematically smaller than predicted by the rmf model , a deviation which coincides with the relatively low rank correlation of this measure compared to the other measures ( fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] ) .",
    "in this review , we have first established a set of standardized measures to determine the ruggedness of fitness landscapes .",
    "we then use these measures to compare the ruggedness of ten available empirical landscapes , and to compare the empirical landscapes to predictions generated by the rough mount fuji ( rmf ) model , a model with tunable ruggedness .",
    "our rank analyses show that the selected measures correlate very well , and thus appear to capture the same underlying feature of the landscape . in a sense , they all capture the amount of epistasis in a particular landscape .",
    "what is quite remarkable is that not all measures are sensitive to detect all types of epistasis .",
    "the fourier analysis and the @xmath38 ratio are sensitive to magnitude epistasis , sign epistasis and reciprocal sign epistasis . the local epistasis measure , @xmath98 , and measures of accessible pathways are insensitive to magnitude epistasis , while the number of local fitness maxima is only sensitive to detect reciprocal sign epistasis .",
    "the fact that the rank correlations between the different measures are still high could either mean that the effects of sign epistasis dominate the measures that are sensitive to magnitude epistasis or that the three types of epistasis co - occur .",
    "the above also implies that the measure of epistasis among two loci ( @xmath98 ) contains similar information as the more global measures of epistasis ( involving 4 loci ) .",
    "sampling local interactions can be done by detection of pairwise interactions between mutations , which is experimentally more straightforward than building multidimensional landscapes of connected genotypes . on the other hand",
    ", the fourier analysis shows that higher - order interactions between mutations ( @xmath99 , etc . )",
    "play a significant role , especially in the more rugged landscapes .",
    "this information can only be detected by the construction of such landscapes .    before we discuss",
    "which characteristics of mutations are either linked with smooth or rugged landscapes , we need to emphasize that the small number of available landscapes only allows for preliminary conclusions and that the comparison is complicated by differences in the methodologies involved to measure fitness .",
    "nevertheless , general patterns do emerge as well as gaps in our knowledge .",
    "all empirical landscapes are relatively small in size and a specific set of mutations is used to construct the genotypes .",
    "these mutations fall into different classes .",
    "unfortunately , few representatives are available per class , and worse : we lack any data for other classes .",
    "for example , no landscapes are available using mutations known to be beneficial by themselves in a particular wildtype , nor do we know of any studies that constructed landscapes from deleterious mutations in a single gene .",
    "this necessarily limits the interpretation and generality of our findings .",
    "a first characteristic of a mutation which affects ruggedness is whether the mutation is deleterious @xcite or beneficial @xcite . among the available landscapes , those that are constructed using beneficial mutations ( a - c and e - f in table 2 ) are smoother than those using deleterious mutations ( g - h ) .",
    "although beneficial mutations are much rarer than deleterious ones @xcite , most studies focus on beneficial mutations .",
    "this seems justified given that beneficial mutations do account for a large fraction of the mutations that contribute to long - term evolution @xcite . both types of mutations are intrinsically linked , since each fixed beneficial mutation becomes a potential deleterious mutation when the direction of selection reverses . in that global sense",
    ", it does not matter which type we are dealing with . however , there is the possibility that deleterious and beneficial mutations have intrinsically different statistical properties , including epistatic interactions , because they sample different parts of the local fitness landscape .",
    "similarly , the position of the wild type is of influence .",
    "for example , the beneficial mutations in the tem-1 @xmath37-lactamase fitness landscape e increase resistance to the antibiotic cefotaxime @xcite .",
    "the tem-1 wild type incurs a very low resistance towards this antibiotic , and the fittest genotype has approximately a 100,000-fold higher resistance .",
    "this clearly differs from the study by chou et al .",
    "@xcite ( landscape a ) in which a new metabolic pathway is introduced into a strain of _ methylobacterium extorquens _ and the fittest genotype displays a @xmath100 ( i.e.  @xmath101-fold ) fitness increase .",
    "note also that the empirical fitness landscapes include mutations that are known to alter fitness ( individually or collectively ) , and mutations with an individually neutral effect are excluded .",
    "still , neutral mutations make up a significant portion of all available mutations @xcite , and are known to contribute to long - term adaptation @xcite .",
    "a second characteristic that appears to influence the degree of ruggedness is whether the individual or the combined effect ( beneficial or deleterious ) is known .",
    "for example , the mutations that were studied by chou et al .",
    "@xcite and khan et al.@xcite ( landscape b ) collectively produced a well - adapted genotype after many generations of evolution , whereas the mutations studied by @xcite ( landscape h ) were _ a priori _ only known to have a deleterious effect in the wild - type background . in the first category",
    ", all intermediates are constructed between two points in genotype space that are connected by at least one accessible pathway ( otherwise the higher - fitness genotype would not have been found ) . in the second category , the genotype that combines all mutations is not necessarily accessible from the wildtype , and does not even have to be better adapted .",
    "consistent with an expected greater bias against ( sign ) epistasis in the first category , the landscapes based on genome - wide collectively beneficial mutations show less epistasis than those based on individually deleterious mutations ( see table [ table2 ] ) .",
    "a better direct test would be a comparison between mutations with known collective or individual effect of the same fitness sign ( all beneficial or all deleterious ) within the same biological system , but we presently lack such data .    a third distinction that affects ruggedness of empirical fitness landscapes is the level at which the mutations interact .",
    "the included mutations can for example affect fitness @xcite , can operate in a common genetic pathway @xcite , or can even be located in the same gene @xcite .",
    "the landscapes constructed from beneficial mutations located in different genes ( a - b ) are smoother than those from beneficial mutations located in the same gene ( c and e - f ) .",
    "when epistasis is detected between mutations in different genes , this information has traditionally been used to infer their combined contribution to a metabolic pathway .",
    "the reverse is also true : when empirical fitness landscapes combine mutations that operate in a common genetic pathway , finding epistasis becomes more likely .",
    "this becomes even more prominent when mutations are located in a single gene .",
    "epistasis among mutations in different genes can result from functional constraints caused by interactions in a metabolic network @xcite , whereas intragenic epistasis can also result from structural constraints when nucleotide positions in a single gene have a combined effect on protein shape , enzyme activity , or folding - stability @xcite .",
    "this relates to the type of epistasis that one expects to find .",
    "magnitude epistasis is often associated with mutations in different genes in a metabolic network @xcite , whereas sign epistasis is expected to occur more often between positions in a single gene @xcite .",
    "the expectation of a greater contribution of epistasis to landscapes based on mutations in a single gene versus in different genes is supported by our analysis ( see table [ table2 ] ) .",
    "note however , that compensatory mutations are often located in different genes @xcite , and that sign epistasis between deleterious mutations has also been shown to occur at a genome - wide scale @xcite .    having in mind all complicating differences between the various fitness proxies and the diverse set of biological organisms used for testing , it is all the more surprising",
    "how well the simple model ( [ rmf_fitness_sum ] ) seems to capture features of the real landscapes .",
    "however , we emphasize that we studied averaged quantities of small ( i.e. 4-locus ) subgraphs of the landscapes in order to standardize our measures and compare them to model predictions .",
    "hence information contained in the full landscape might have been overlooked in these analyses .",
    "for example , the considerations in the previous paragraph suggest that the level of interaction between mutants should be distributed very inhomogeneously on large enough landscapes , consistent with predictions from metabolic models @xcite .",
    "this means that the landscapes can be decomposed into subgraphs , some of which contain much , others little or no epistasis .",
    "such a decomposition would reflect the strength of interactions between specific combinations of mutations .",
    "for instance , one would expect that mutations changing the same functional part of one protein should highly influence the impact of one another on the function . on the other hand",
    ", the impact of mutations altering different proteins , which do not interact , should be independent of each other .",
    "searching for such patterns by looking at distributions of epistasis measures instead of their mean , is a promising direction for future study .",
    "if the existence of genetic modules with different levels of epistasis can be established empirically , it will be a challenge for future models of fitness landscapes to take this realism into account , and study its evolutionary consequences .",
    "in fact , the @xmath7 model [ 27 , 28 ] was introduced with the idea of incorporating such structures .",
    "however , these models make very specific assumptions about the distribution of the size and coupling of different epistastic modules , and these should be compared to measures based on empirical landscapes . where systematic deviations are observed , the empirical information",
    "may then be used to adapt the models .",
    "much of the progress in understanding fitness landscapes and their evolutionary implications , therefore , depends on the availability of additional empirical landscapes from various systems  particularly from those classes where we lack any information .",
