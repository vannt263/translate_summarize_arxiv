    "since the remarkable founding paper by einstein in 1905  @xcite , followed closely by two seminal papers respectively by smoluchowski  @xcite and langevin  @xcite , random walks and the associated continuous - time brownian motion have remained as fundamental cornerstones of statistical physics with an amazingly impressive number of applications  @xcite that range from traditional ` natural ' sciences such as physics , chemistry , biology , mathematics and astronomy all the way to ` man - made ' subjects such as computer science and finance . even though many aspects of this classical subject are extremely well understood and form text book materials , it is fascinating that new questions with non trivial answers , arising from new applications , continue to spring unexpected surprises .    in these lectures",
    "i will discuss some of these recent applications .",
    "the general area of random walks is vast with an enormous literature .",
    "my goal for these lectures is rather modest .",
    "i will just focus on a rather simple and restricted model : a discrete - time random hopper on a continuous line .",
    "starting from the origin @xmath4 , the position of the particle at step @xmath1 evolves via the markov rule , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 s denote the random jumps at different time steps .",
    "these jumps are independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "random variables , each drawn from the same distribution @xmath7 which is symmetric and continuous .",
    "if the walk evolves up to step @xmath1 , one generates a sequence or a discrete - time series : @xmath8 .",
    "clearly the members of this sequence are _ correlated _ random variables .",
    "such a sequence is perhaps the simplest possible correlated sequence that appears rather naturally in many different contexts .",
    "a classic example of such a walk can be found in bacterial chemotaxis , where a bacteria , in search of food , jumps from one position to another at discrete time steps  @xcite . in the context of queueing theory",
    "@xmath9 represents the length of a single queue at time @xmath1  @xcite . in the context of the evolution of stock prices @xmath9 represents the logarithm of the price of a stock at time @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "it can also represent the @xmath10 coordinates of the beads of a rouse polymer chain in thermal equilibrium in @xmath11-dimensions ( when the jump distribution is gaussian )  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "when the jump distribution has a power law tail with a divergent second moment , @xmath12 , this sequence represents a lvy flight which also has enormous number of applications  @xcite .    here",
    "i will focus on two _ extreme _ observables associated with such a correlated sequence : ( i ) the global maximum @xmath13 of the sequence and the associated time step @xmath14 at which this maximum is realized in a given sample ( ii ) the number and ages of records of this sequence where a record is set to happen at step @xmath3 if @xmath2 is bigger than all the previous values : @xmath15 for all @xmath16 .",
    "age of a record is simply the number of steps up to which this record survives , i.e , till it gets surpassed by the next record breaking event .",
    "now , if the number of steps @xmath1 of the sequence is large and if the second moment of the jump length distribution @xmath17 is finite , one would expect , correctly , to recover the continuous - time limit results of the brownian motion as a consequence of the central limit theorem , at least for the global maximum ( records are not very well defined in the continuous - time limit ) .",
    "however , it turns out , as i will show here in some detail , that many properties associated with extreme events such as the global maximum or the number of records are _ completely universal for all _ @xmath1 , i.e. , they do not depend on the jump length distribution @xmath7 at all whatever be the value of @xmath1 , as long as @xmath7 is symmetric and continuous .",
    "note , in particular , that this universality does not even require a finite @xmath18 , e.g. , it holds even for long range lvy flights .",
    "in fact , this universality has nothing to do with the central limit theorem .",
    "instead , it will turn out to be a consequence of the sparre andersen theorem  @xcite concerning the first - passage properties of such a random walk sequence  @xcite .",
    "this is a rather deep combinatorial theorem and the final result looks deceptively simple though its derivation is far from simple . here",
    "i will provide a derivation of this result using another result on the generating function of the maximum of such a sequence , known as the pollaczek - spitzer formula  @xcite .",
    "somehow these results are not so well known among physicists .",
    "so , i ll discuss these results in some detail and use them to derive some universal and some nonuniversal properties associated with the statistics of the maximum and the records of this random walk sequence .    in the latter half of my lectures in the school",
    ", i also discussed the statistical properties of the functionals of brownian motion via the feynman - kac formula and in particular , various interesting applications of the so called first - passage brownian functionals , where one considers the brownian motion till its first - passage time .",
    "they turn out to have various applications : in queueing theory , in finance , in simple models of particle moving in a disordered random potential and in astrophysics where one is interested in the distribution of the life time of a comet in the solar system .",
    "however , i will not include this interesting topic in these lecture notes , as i have already discussed it in another article  @xcite .",
    "the interested readers may consult this article and also another review on brownian functionals with interesting applications in the localisation theory  @xcite .",
    "this article is organised as follows . in section",
    "ii , i define the model precisely and review some basic preliminaries to remind the readers the central limit theorem and the lvy stable laws . in section iii ,",
    "i discuss the first - passage properties associated with the random walk sequence and discuss the pollaczek - spitzer formula and how this formula leads to the sparre andersen theorem .",
    "section iv is devoted to the statistics of the global maximum and the universal statistics of the time of its occurrence where we use the sparre andersen theorem . in section",
    "v , we discuss the statistics of the number of records and their ages and show how universal properties emerge again as a consequence of the sparre andersen theorem . finally , i conclude in section vi with a summary and some open problems .",
    "let us start with a simple discrete - time random walker moving on a continuous line .",
    "the position @xmath9 of the walker after @xmath1 steps evolves for @xmath19 via , @xmath20 starting at @xmath4 , where the step lengths @xmath6 s are i.i.d .",
    "random variables with zero mean and each drawn from a normalized ( to unity ) distribution @xmath7 which is symmetric , @xmath21 ( see fig .",
    "0.2 cm    few examples of the jump length distribution @xmath7 are : 0.3 cm    \\(i ) @xmath22 ( exponential )    0.3 cm    \\(ii ) @xmath23 ( gaussian )    0.3 cm    \\(iii ) @xmath24 $ ] ( uniform )    0.3 cm    \\(iv ) @xmath25 for large @xmath26 with @xmath27 such that @xmath28 does not exist ( lvy flights )    0.3 cm    \\(v ) @xmath29 ( lattice random walk where the lattice spacing is unity ) .    0.3 cm    in first @xmath30 of these examples , the cumulative jump distribution @xmath31 is a continuous function . in the last example ( v ) , where the walker is restricted to move on a one dimensional lattice with unit lattice spacing ,",
    "the cumulative jump distribution @xmath32 is a non - continuous function .",
    "we will see later that this continuity property of @xmath32 will play an important role .",
    "note further that in examples ( i)-(iii ) and ( v ) , the variance of the step length , @xmath33 is finite .",
    "we will see that in such cases the central limit theorem holds . in the lvy case ( iv ) , the central limit theorem breaks down .",
    "a trajectory of a random walker starting at the initial position @xmath34 and evolving with the number of steps @xmath1.,width=529,height=377 ]    0.3 cm the evolution equation is markovian since the position @xmath9 at step @xmath1 depends only on the position at just the previous time step @xmath35 ( and not on the full history before the @xmath36-th step ) and on the current noise , i.e. , the noise @xmath6 at step @xmath1 .",
    "this markovian property makes life simple as we will see later . as a simple example of a non - markovian evolution consider the rule @xmath37 where @xmath6 s are again i.i.d random variables",
    "this is just the discrete - time version of the continuous - time random acceleration problem : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a gaussian white noise with zero mean @xmath40 and delta correlator @xmath41 .",
    "it turns out that the first - passage properties of even this simple non - markovian evolution is highly nontrivial  @xcite .",
    "we will not consider non - markov evolution rules further in these lectures and focus only on the markov evolution .",
    "for the first - passage properties of non - markovian stochastic processes see  @xcite and references therein .",
    "iterating the markov evolution rule up to @xmath1 steps , it follows that the position @xmath9 of the walker after @xmath1 steps , starting at @xmath4 , is simply a sum of @xmath1 i.i.d .",
    "random variables @xmath42 in the case when @xmath18 is finite , using the independence property of the step lengths @xmath43 s , it follows that the mean square displacement of the particle after @xmath1 steps , for all @xmath1 , is simply @xmath44    0.3 cm * brownian limit : * at this point , it is useful to consider the continuous - time limit where the random walk reduces to a brownian motion",
    ". let us define @xmath45 as a small time interval and set @xmath46",
    ". then gives @xmath47 if one now takes the limit @xmath48 , it follows that @xmath49 also in order that @xmath50 remains finite at finite time @xmath51 .",
    "thus , to have a meaningful continuous - time limit , the mean square step length @xmath52 as @xmath53 with a finite diffusion constant @xmath54 , leading to the diffusive law of brownian motion @xmath55 for all @xmath51 . in this continuous - time limit , one can also rewrite the markov evolution rule as @xmath56 where @xmath39 is random noise with zero mean that is uncorrelated at two different times , @xmath57 for @xmath58 . at the same time instant ,",
    "however , @xmath59 .",
    "thus , as @xmath48 , @xmath60 diverges .",
    "a useful physicist s way of writing this correlation function of the noise is @xmath61 . in this limit",
    "it is called the white noise and one writes as a stochastic langevin equation @xmath62 where @xmath39 is the white noise with zero mean and a correlator @xmath63 .",
    "note that for all practical purposes , such as in numerical simulation , one will interpret the delta function as @xmath64 .",
    "we will see later that in the brownian limit many properties of the walk , such as its first - passage probability , become much simpler .",
    "in contrast , for discrete time evolution , even though the process is markov , some of these properties are quite nontrivial .",
    "let us get back to our basic discrete - time markov evolution . in this subsection ,",
    "let us compute a basic object namely the free ( bare ) green s function @xmath65 defined as the probability density of the position of the walker after step @xmath1 at @xmath10 , given that it started from @xmath34 at step @xmath66 .",
    "using the markov property , one can easily write down a recursion relation for the evolution of @xmath65 @xmath67 which counts the event of particle jumping from its position @xmath68 at step @xmath69 to its position @xmath10 at step @xmath1 by an amount @xmath70 drawn from the distribution @xmath71 .",
    "this is called the _ forward _ kolmogorov equation , since one considers the current position @xmath10 of the walker as a variable .",
    "alternatively , one can also write down a _ backward _ kolmogorov equation where one considers the starting position of the walker @xmath34 as a variable @xmath72 here one considers the displacement of the particle at the first step from @xmath34 to @xmath73 and for the subsequent evolution up to @xmath36 steps the starting position of the walker is at @xmath73 .",
    "both equations are completely equivalent to each other .",
    "we will see later , however , that for certain first - passage related quantities , the backward equation is often computationally more advantageous than the forward one .",
    "these integral equations or can be easily solved using fourier transforms .",
    "for example , for the forward equation , we define @xmath74 and use the convolution form of to get @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the fourier transform of @xmath77 . iterating @xmath1 times and using the initial condition , @xmath78 and hence @xmath79 one gets @xmath80^n e^{ikx_0}$ ] .",
    "inverting the fourier transform one obtains the exact green s function @xmath81^n\\ ,   e^{-ik(x - x_0)}\\ , \\frac{dk}{2\\pi } \\label{green1}\\ ] ] let us now see what happens for large @xmath1 . in cases where @xmath18 is finite , one has , for small @xmath82 , @xmath83 .",
    "now , for large @xmath1 , the dominant contribution to the integral in comes from small @xmath82 region . substituting the small @xmath82 behavior , exponentiating and performing the gaussian integral , one gets , for large @xmath1 , the standard gaussian behavior @xmath84 \\label{clt1}\\ ] ] which is essentially the statement of the central limit theorem ( clt ) .",
    "note that the universal gaussian form holds only near the central peak but not at the tails which are described by nonuniversal large deviation function that i will not discuss here  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , for jump distributions with a divergent @xmath18 ( such as for lvy flights in example ( iv ) ) , the clt breaks down  @xcite . for lvy flights",
    ", one can write for small @xmath82 , @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the lvy index and @xmath87 is a microscopic length . substituting this in and rescaling @xmath88 one gets , for large @xmath1 , @xmath89 where the function @xmath90 is called the lvy stable function of index @xmath91  @xcite . note that this function @xmath92 , for large @xmath93 , has the same power law tail , @xmath94 as the jump distribution itself .",
    "for some special values of @xmath91 , one can compute this function explicitly  @xcite .",
    "thus , the result in is the statement of lvy stable law  @xcite : the sum of i.i.d lvy distributed variables is itself lvy distributed ( up to a rescaling by @xmath95 ) , i.e. , the lvy distribution is stable under addition  @xcite .",
    "this is thus the counterpart of the clt which is the analogous statement for the sum of i.i.d random variables with a finite @xmath18 : the stable law for clt is gaussian .",
    "note that from it follows that the typical distance traversed by the particle in step @xmath1 scales super - diffusively : @xmath96 for @xmath97 .    0.3 cm    * brownian limit : * in the continuous - time limit , when @xmath18 is finite and hence the clt holds , the integral equations or reduce to partial differential equations .",
    "for example , given the langevin evolution in , the forward kolmogorov equation reduces to @xmath98 expanding the green s function on the rhs in a taylor series , keeping terms up to @xmath99 and using the property that @xmath100 , one gets , taking @xmath48 , the well known diffusion equation for the green s function @xmath101 starting from the initial condition , @xmath78 .",
    "similarly one can write down a backward diffusion equation with @xmath10 in replaced by @xmath34 .",
    "the solution of the forward ( or the backward ) diffusion equation can be easily found using fourier transforms and one recovers , as expected , the gaussian behavior @xmath102 . \\label{gauss1}\\ ] ]    for lvy flights , where @xmath18 is infinite and the clt breaks down , one can still _ formally _ define a continuous - time limit , and obtain the so called lvy fractional diffusion equation ( for a review and discussion , see  @xcite ) .",
    "this simply follows by rewriting the basic recursion relation as @xmath103 next we write @xmath104 and substitute it in .",
    "this gives @xmath105 following similar arguments as in the brownian case , in the large @xmath1 limit , one needs to keep only the small @xmath82 contribution of @xmath106 in .",
    "this gives @xmath107 now , we need to divide both sides by the time increment @xmath45 and take the limit @xmath53 . to obtain a sensible limit",
    ", one needs to take @xmath108 limit as well , keeping the ratio @xmath109 fixed .",
    "this gives a continuous - time integro - differential equation @xmath110 where the integral in the @xmath82 space can be _ formally _ interpreted as a fractional derivative .",
    "note that for @xmath111 , one recovers the standard diffusion equation .",
    "but for @xmath112 , one still needs to solve an integral equation even in the continuous - time limit .",
    "thus for the lvy walks , even though one can formally write down a continuous - time equation , it is not as useful as the ordinary brownian case where one has a true differential equation in real space whose solution can be easily obtained .",
    "this continuous - time fractional diffusion equation has been studied extensively in the recent past ( for a review see @xcite ) and many interesting results , in particular concerning first - passage properties have been derived ( see for instance @xcite ) . however , in these lectures i will not use this approach and will rather stick to the discrete - time evolution .",
    "having done with these standard basic preliminaries , let us now turn to the first - passage properties of a random walk evolving in discrete time via the markov rule with arbitrary symmetric jump length distribution @xmath7 .",
    "we first define the restricted green s function @xmath113 as the probability ( density ) that the walker , starting at @xmath114 at step @xmath66 , reaches the position @xmath115 at step @xmath1 but _ without crossing the origin _ in between , i.e. , it stays positive at all intermediate steps and lands at @xmath10 exactly at the @xmath1-th step @xmath116 . \\label{rgreen}\\ ] ] using the markov property of the evolution , one can again write down the evolution equation for the restricted green s function , both _ forward _ and _ backward _ as in case of free green s function in the previous subsection @xmath117 the interpretation is as before . for example , in the forward case , one considers the walker reaching @xmath68 at step @xmath36 ( staying positive always ) and then making a final jump @xmath118 at step @xmath1 by drawing a random length @xmath119 from the distribution @xmath7 .",
    "similarly , in the backward equation , the particle at step @xmath120 jumps from its initial position @xmath34 to a new position @xmath73 and subsequently evolves for @xmath36 steps starting from this new initial position @xmath73 while staying positive all along .",
    "one then integrates over all possible jumps at the first step , but making sure that @xmath73 is positive .",
    "the _ survival probability _ or the _ persistence _ is defined as the probability @xmath121 that the particle survives ( i.e. stays positive ) up to step @xmath1 , no matter what the final position @xmath10 at step @xmath1 is .",
    "thus @xmath122= \\int_0^{\\infty }   g^{+}(x , x_0,n)\\ , dx \\label{pers1}\\ ] ] thus , one can either solve first the forward equation , obtain the restricted green s function @xmath113 for all @xmath10 and then integrate over @xmath10 in to obtain the survival probability @xmath121 .",
    "alternatively , and in a much easier way , one can integrate the backward equation over @xmath10 and write directly a backward evolution equation for the survival probability itself @xmath123 thus one saves an extra integration step and just needs to solve only the integral equation starting from the initial condition @xmath124 for all @xmath125 .",
    "this initial condition follows from the fact that the walker definitely ( with probability @xmath120 ) does not cross @xmath66 in @xmath66 step .",
    "one thus sees why the backward equation is more advantageous compared to the forward equation , atleast as far as the persistence properties are concerned .",
    "once we have obtained the survival probability @xmath121 , the _ first - passage probability _ can be easily computed from it .",
    "the first - passage probability @xmath126 is defined as the probability that the walker , starting initially at @xmath34 , _ crosses the origin for the first time _ immediately after step @xmath69 ( i.e. , it is positive at step @xmath69 , but becomes negative at step @xmath1 ) .",
    "it then follows that @xmath127 as it counts the fraction of paths that survived up to step @xmath36 , but not up to step @xmath1 .",
    "so , to compute the first - passage or the survival probability , we need to solve the integral equations , or just directly .",
    "note the important differences in these equations compared to the free green s functions in and : they look almost similar , but not quite . in equations , or ,",
    "the limit of integration on the rhs is from @xmath66 to @xmath128 , as opposed to @xmath129 to @xmath128 in the free green s function equations and .",
    "this makes a huge difference !",
    "the reason is , even though apparently seems to have a convolution form , the limit of integration is only over half - space @xmath130 $ ] and not the full space @xmath131 $ ] . if the limits were over the full space , as in the case of free green s functions , one can simply use the fourier transform methods .",
    "but for the half - space problem , unfortunately one can not use simple fourier transform technique .",
    "in fact , such half - space integral equations have been well studied in mathematics and are known as wiener - hopf integral equations  @xcite . for a general kernel @xmath71 , they are notoriously difficult to solve !",
    "however , for the particular case where the kernel @xmath71 has the interpretation of a probability density function ( i.e. , non - negative and normalizable function ) , one can obtain explicit solution  @xcite ( as discussed later ) .",
    "the discussion above makes it clear the technical reason as to why computing the first - passage properties of even a simple random walker ( but with arbitrary jump distribution @xmath7 ) is nontrivial .",
    "before we write the solution explicitly , let us see first how this problem simplifies in the continuous - time brownian limit",
    ".    0.3 cm    * brownian limit : * in the brownian limit , one can reduce the discrete time backward _ integral _",
    "equation for the survival probability into a partial differential equation .",
    "let us consider the survival probability @xmath132 up to time @xmath133 .",
    "let us break the interval @xmath134 $ ] into two intervals @xmath135 $ ] and @xmath136 $ ] .",
    "in the first small interval the particle evolves from its initial position @xmath34 to a new random position @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the initial noise in the langevin equation .",
    "subsequently the particle evolves in the interval @xmath139 $ ] starting from its new initial position @xmath137 .",
    "thus , the analogue of is @xmath140 expanding in a taylor series as in the case of free green s function and using the properties of the white noise , one then gets the backward fokker - planck equation for the survival probability @xmath141 valid for all @xmath125 and to be solved with the boundary conditions : ( a ) @xmath142 for all @xmath51 and ( b ) @xmath143 for all @xmath51 and subject to the initial condition @xmath124 for all @xmath114 .",
    "thus in the brownian limit , we are able to reduce the wiener - hopf integral equation into a partial differential equation ( pde ) : that s already a big simplification !",
    "the solution to this pde can be obtained by various standard methods .",
    "let me just mention here a slightly non - standard but quick method .",
    "clearly , using the diffusive scaling @xmath144 , it follows that the function @xmath145 must have a scaling form : @xmath146 . substituting this scaling form in the pde",
    "one obtains an ordinary differential equation ( that s what scaling always does : reduces a function of two variables into a function of a single scaled variable ) valid for @xmath147 @xmath148 the initial and the boundary conditions of the pde translates into two boundary conditions : @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "the solution can be easily obtained : @xmath151 .",
    "thus we get the explicit well known solution  @xcite @xmath152 note that even though we had assumed scaling ( without really proving it ! ) , the solution is exact for all @xmath51 as one can directly verify by substituting it in the pde .",
    "one also sees that for large @xmath51 and fixed @xmath34 the survival probability decays as a power law @xmath153 the first - passage probability is given by @xmath154 which is just the continuous - time limit of .",
    "using one then gets @xmath155 which decays , for large @xmath51 and fixed @xmath34 , as @xmath156 with the famous first - passage exponent @xmath157  @xcite .",
    "let us now go back to the basic wiener - hopf integral equation that describes the evolution of the survival probability @xmath121 . as mentioned before , the solution is nontrivial for a general kernel @xmath71 .",
    "however , when the cumulative distribution @xmath158 is a continuous function such as in examples ( i)-(iv ) in section - i ( but not for lattice random walk ( v ) where @xmath159 is a discontinuous function ) , an explicit solution was first found by pollaczek  @xcite and later independently by spitzer  @xcite in a slightly different context .",
    "pollaczek was interested in finding the distribution of the ordered partial sums of a set of i.i.d .",
    "variables , whereas spitzer was interested in finding the distribution of the maximum of the set of partial sums , which is related ( see later ) to the survival probability .",
    "spitzer s derivation was more combinatorial .",
    "the same integral equation also appeared previously in a variety of half - space transport problems in physics and astrophysics ( see @xcite and references therein ) and several other derivations of the solution of this equation , mostly algebraic in nature , are known  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , all these derivations , both the combinatorial as well as the algebraic ones , are highly technical in nature and there is no easy way",
    "! here i will avoid these technical steps and instead just state the final result and discuss its applications .",
    "readers who are interested in the algebraic derivation may consult  @xcite where we have listed systematically the steps that lead to the final solution .",
    "the solution of , with the initial condition @xmath124 for all @xmath114 , is in terms of a double laplace transform of @xmath121 @xmath160\\ ,   e^{-p\\,x_0}\\ , dx_0= \\frac{1}{p\\sqrt{1-s}}\\ , \\exp\\left[-\\frac{p}{\\pi } \\int_0^{\\infty } \\frac{\\ln \\left(1-s { \\tilde \\phi}(k)\\right)}{p^2+k^2}\\ , dk   \\right ]   \\label{psp1}\\ ] ] where @xmath161 is the fourier transform of the jump length distribution .",
    "we will refer this solution in as the pollaczek - spitzer formula .",
    "let us now discuss some consequences of this explicit result .",
    "although the survival probability @xmath121 for arbitrary @xmath34 depends explicitly on the jump length distribution @xmath7 as evident in , it turns out that @xmath162 ( the survival probability of the particle up to @xmath1 steps starting at the origin ) becomes , somewhat miraculously , _",
    "independent _ of the distribution @xmath7 as long as it is a continuous function . to see this ,",
    "let us take the @xmath163 limit in . making a change of variable @xmath164 on the lhs of and taking @xmath165 limit",
    ", the lhs reduces , to leading order , to @xmath166 . on the rhs ,",
    "taking @xmath163 limit gives @xmath167 .",
    "equating the leading order terms ( of @xmath168 for large @xmath169 ) on both sides gives the identity , for all @xmath170 , @xmath171 equating powers of @xmath170 one gets the sparre andersen theorem  @xcite @xmath172 where we have used , for convenience , a shorthand notation @xmath173 for @xmath162 .",
    "thus , quite amazingly , the survival probability @xmath174 ( starting from the origin ) is completely _",
    "universal _ and that too _ for all _ @xmath1 ( and not just for large @xmath1 ) .",
    "no matter whether the jump length distribution is exponential , gaussian or uniform , @xmath173 is the same and is given by the simple formula in .",
    "sparre andersen derived this formula originally using rather involved combinatorial approach .",
    "this simple looking formula is however a bit deceptive and led several authors to try to derive it in a ` simple ' way !",
    "unfortunately , all attempts led to equally complicated derivation ( see @xcite and references therein ) . deriving this formula as a special case of the pollaczek - spitzer solution is instructive as it shows that the role of the starting point @xmath4 is important for this _",
    "universality_. one looses this universality",
    "the moment @xmath34 is nonzero .",

    "thus , the age of the longest record ( @xmath338 ) is much large than the typical age ( @xmath339 ) for large @xmath1 .    for the shortest lasting record @xmath340 , it is also useful to consider the cumulative distribution @xmath341 $ ] given @xmath1 .",
    "this event is equivalent to having the lengths , @xmath342 for all @xmath343 . following similar procedure as in the case of the longest lasting record",
    ", one finds the generating function @xmath344 one can then extract , in a similar way , the asymptotic large @xmath1 behavior of @xmath345  @xcite .",
    "thus , the mean age of the shortest lasting record grows in a similar way as that of a typical record , i.e. , as @xmath228 , albeit with a smaller prefactor @xmath346 compared with @xmath347 .      in the discussion above for the statistics of records",
    ", we had assumed that the jump length distribution @xmath7 is symmetric and continuous . however , the basic renewal equation is valid for continuous but asymmetric jump distribution as well .",
    "the only difference is that we have to use the appropriate expressions for @xmath293 and @xmath288 from the generalized sparre andersen theorem .",
    "for example , the generating function for the distribution @xmath316 for the number of records up to step @xmath1 is given by the asymmetric version of @xmath348^{r-1}\\ , { \\tilde q}_{-}(s)= \\left[1-(1-s ) { \\tilde q}_{-}(s)\\right]^{r-1}\\,{\\tilde   q}_{-}(s ) \\label{nore3}\\ ] ] where @xmath290 is given by .",
    "indeed , for the special case of a random walk sequence in presence of a drift @xmath91 and cauchy distributed jumps as in , one can obtain explicit results  @xcite for @xmath316 in .",
    "using one gets the exact generating function : @xmath349 and substituting this in gives @xmath350^{r-1}}{(1-s)^{\\zeta_{- } } } \\label{cauchy6}\\ ] ] from which it follows that the average number of records grows anomalously @xmath351 for large @xmath1 .",
    "using @xmath352 , one sees that as @xmath203 ( positive drift away from the origin ) , @xmath353 and thus the average number of records grows linearly with the number of steps @xmath1 , i.e. , at every step a new record happens on an average .",
    "of course , this is expected in presence of an infinite drift since the particle moves ballistically in the positive semi - axis .",
    "on the other hand , as @xmath205 , @xmath354 indicating that the average number of records do not grow with @xmath1 for large @xmath1 .",
    "this is also expected since the particle mostly stays on the negative side of the origin when @xmath205 and thus hardly ever makes a positive record .",
    "these results were then used to understand the anomalous avalanche size distribution in a model of a particle moving in a random potential  @xcite .",
    "another interesting generalization of these results emerged from the following observation : it turns out that the constant @xmath355 that appears as the prefactor of the linear growth of the longest lasting record in also appears in the excursion theory of brownian motion  @xcite . let us consider a brownian motion over a time interval @xmath356 $ ] and consider the set of successive zero crossing intervals or excursions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cartoon ] ) .     a trajectory of a brownian motion over [ 0,t ] with",
    "@xmath357 completed excursions of lengths @xmath358 $ ] and the last incomplete excursion of length @xmath359.,width=529,height=377 ]    let us denote the maximum excursion length up to time @xmath51 by @xmath360 @xmath361 where @xmath359 denotes the length of the last interval before @xmath51 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : cartoon ] ) .",
    "let @xmath362 $ ] denote the probability the last incomplete excursion is the longest one .",
    "then it turns out  @xcite that @xmath363 tends , for large @xmath51 , to the same constant @xmath364 as in eq . .",
    "we were able to understand recently why this same constant @xmath365 appears in apparently different observables namely ( i ) in the length of the longest lasting record and ( ii ) the probability @xmath363 that the last excursion is the longest  @xcite .",
    "this understanding led us to study the statistics of @xmath360 and that of @xmath363 for generic stochastic processes going beyond the simple brownian motion  @xcite .",
    "the statistics of @xmath360 turns out to have interesting universal features that allowed us to distinguish between stochastic processes that are smooth ( i.e. with a finite density of zero crossings ) versus the ones that are rough ( where the density of zero crossings is infinite as in the case of the brownian motion )  @xcite .",
    "in summary , i have discussed the universal first - passage properties associated with a discrete - time random walk sequence consisting of @xmath1 steps , where the walker starts at the origin @xmath4 and at each step jumps by a random amount drawn independently at each step from a symmetric and continuous distribution @xmath7 .",
    "the first - passage probability is universal , i.e. , independent of the jump length distribution due to the sparre andersen theorem .",
    "we have then used the consequence of this result on the statistics of two extreme random variables : ( i ) the global maximum of the walk and the step at which it occurs and ( ii ) the number and ages of records .",
    "we have seen that the distribution of the time of the maximum as well as the record statistics become universal as a consequence of the sparre andersen theorem .    the distribution of the value of the maximum , however , is non - universal and depends explicitly on @xmath7 .",
    "the random variables belonging to this sequence are correlated . for the distribution of the maximum , the standard evs of i.i.d .",
    "random variables does not apply due to these correlations .",
    "the computation of the distribution of the maximum for this discrete - time sequence is thus nontrivial due to these correlations , even though in the corresponding continuous - time brownian motion it is easy to compute .",
    "however , thanks to the pollaczek - spitzer formula , one knows , at least in principle , how to compute the generating function of this maximum distribution for arbitrary symmetric and continuous @xmath7 . the leading large @xmath1 behavior of the moments of the maximum can be extracted relatively easily from this explicit pollaczek - spitzer formula . however , extracting the subleading finite size correction term turns out to be much trickier . at least for the expected maximum",
    ", we have seen how to compute exactly the leading finite size correction term , for the case when the jump distribution has a finite variance and also for the case of lvy flights with index @xmath366 .",
    "these results are interesting because the expected maximum of a discrete - time random walk is exactly related to the perimeter of the convex hull of a planar random walk which has important applications in the estimation of home range of animals in ecology  @xcite",
    ".    it would also be interesting to compute the expected maximum and the distribution of the time of its occurrence in presence of a drift . in the brownian limit , in presence of a drift",
    ", the distribution of the time at which the maximum occurs has been computed using a path integral method  @xcite , with interesting applications in finance .",
    "however , for the discrete - time case , i am not aware of any result so far and it would be interesting to compute this distribution .",
    "there are interesting generalizations of the results presented here .",
    "for example , concerning the statistics of records , we have studied only the statistics of ` positive ' records , i.e. , when the value @xmath2 of a record that occurs at step @xmath3 is bigger than all previous values , given that the sequence started at @xmath4 . it would be interesting to investigate the statistics of the records of the absolute values of the sequence , i.e. , of @xmath367 which , to my knowledge , has not yet been studied  @xcite .",
    "as i already mentioned , the record statistics of this markov sequence has been studied in presence of a constant drift with interesting applications in avalanche dynamics  @xcite . in particular , we have seen one case , namely the cauchy distribution with drift , where the average number of records grows with the sequence size @xmath1 anomalously with a nontrivial drift - dependent exponent  @xcite .",
    "it would not be difficult to compute the distribution of the ages of records in this particular case .",
    "the study of the age distribution of records for arbitrary asymmetric jump distribution remains an open problem .",
    "another interesting generalization is to consider the markov sequence generated by the recursion : @xmath368 where @xmath369 is a parameter and @xmath6 s are , as before , symmetric i.i.d .",
    "noise variables .",
    "this is just a discrete - time analogue of the continous - time orstein - uhlenbeck ( ou ) process of a particle moving in a harmonic potential .",
    "this is seen by writing , @xmath370 which , in the continuous - time limit ( alongwith @xmath371 limit ) , becomes the process ou process , @xmath372 where @xmath39 is a zero mean gaussian white noise .",
    "this discrete - time sequence has many applications , e.g. , it appears in the context of the practical sampling of experimental data on the persistence of a stochastic process  @xcite and also in the simple system of a ball bouncing non - elastically on a noisy platform  @xcite . in the latter context",
    ", the parameter @xmath373 represents the coefficient of restitution of the collision of the ball with the platform  @xcite and the brownian limit @xmath374 corresponds to elastic collision .",
    "the first - passage properties of this sequence for generic @xmath375 turns out to be highly nontrivial even for a gaussian noise distribution  @xcite . explicit exact result is known only for the exponential noise distribution  @xcite . while , for generic @xmath375 , these first - passage properties are nonuniversal , one recovers several interesting universal properties in the elastic limit @xmath376  @xcite . it would be interesting to study the statistics of the maximum and that of the records in this simple markov sequence for arbitrary @xmath377 and arbitrary noise distribution .    in conclusion , there are still many unresolved questions associated with even simple one dimensional random walks .",
    "depending on the new applications , new questions emerge requiring new techniques to solve them which are often nontrivial and interesting .",
