    "now , by weinstein s neighbourhood theorem for lagrangian submanifolds  @xcite , a small cotangent disc bundle of @xmath351 embeds symplectically into @xmath352 .",

    "the intersection argument that we used in the proof of our main theorem in order to show that the spheres in our moduli space are simple no longer applies , since the hypersurface @xmath369 is not contained in  @xmath127 .",
    "instead however , we may reason as in example  ( 2 ) that a class @xmath370 can be regarded as a class in @xmath371 . from @xmath372)=\\omega_{\\operatorname{fs}}([f])=\\pi$ ] ( with @xmath373 ) , and the observation that @xmath263 takes values in @xmath374 on spherical classes , we conclude that spheres in the class @xmath301 $ ] are simple . also as in example  ( 2 ) we see that semi - positivity ( which is automatic on @xmath127 for dimensional reasons ) carries over to the relevant @xmath375-dimensional cobordism .",
