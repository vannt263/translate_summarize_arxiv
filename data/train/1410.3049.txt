    "as one of the most promising solid - state candidates for quantum information processing [ 1,2 ] , the physical system composed of circuit cavities and superconducting qubits is of particular interest .",
    "this is because : ( i ) superconducting qubits and microwave resonators ( a.k.a .",
    "cavities ) can be fabricated using modern integrated circuit technology , and their properties can be characterized and adjusted in situ , ( ii ) superconducting qubits have relatively long decoherence times [ 3,4 ] , and ( iii ) a superconducting microwave cavity or resonator plays a role of quantum bus  which can mediate long - range and fast interaction between distant superconducting qubits [ 5 - 7 ] .",
    "moreover , the strong coupling between the cavity field and superconducting qubits , which is difficult to implement with atoms in a microwave cavity , was earlier predicted in theory [ 1,8 ] and has been experimentally demonstrated [ 9,10 ] . because of these features , circuit qed has been widely utilized for quantum information processing . based on circuit qed",
    ", many theoretical proposals have been presented for realizing two - qubit gates [ 5,11 - 18 ] and multiple qubit gates [ 19 - 20 ] with superconducting qubits . moreover ,",
    "experimental demonstration of two - qubit gates [ 6,7,21,22 ] and three - qubit gates [ 23 - 25 ] with superconducting qubits in circuit qed has been also reported .",
    "the interest in quantum computation is stimulated by the discovery of quantum algorithms [ 26,27 ] which can solve problems of significance much more efficiently than their classical counterparts . among important quantum algorithms ,",
    "there exist the deutsch algorithm [ 28 ] , the deutsch - jozsa algorithm [ 29 ] , the shor algorithm [ 30 ] , the simon algorithm [ 31 ] , the quantum fourier transform algorithm , and the grover search algorithm [ 32 ] . as is well known , the deutsch algorithm and the deutsch - jozsa algorithm were the first two that make use of the features of quantum mechanics for quantum computation . compared with other quantum algorithms , these two algorithms are easy to be implemented and thus have been considered as the natural candidates for demonstrating power of quantum computation .",
    "we note that with superconducting qubits coupled to a circuit cavity , a _ two - qubit _ _ deutsch - jozsa _ quantum algorithm and a two - qubit grover search quantum algorithm were previously demonstrated in experiments [ 7 ] .",
    "however , after a thorough investigation , we note that how to implement a _ three - qubit _ deutsch - jozsa ( dj ) quantum algorithm with superconducting qubits or qutrits in circuit qed has not been reported in both theoretical and experimental aspects .",
    "as is known , the experimental realization of the three - qubit dj algorithm with a cavity - superconducting - device system is important because it would be an important step toward more complex quantum computation in circuit qed .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a protocol to construct the 35 @xmath0-controlled phase gates of a three - qubit refined dj algorithm , by using single - qubit @xmath2 gates , two - qubit cp gates , and two - target - qubit cp gates .",
    "it should be noted that a two - target - qubit cp gate consists of two sequential controlled @xmath3 gates , which have a common control qubit but a different target qubit . the protocol is quite general and can be applied to implement the three - qubit dj algorithm in various of physical systems .",
    "based on this protocol , we further discuss how to implement the three - qubit refined dj algorithm with superconducting transmon qutrits resonantly coupled to a single cavity .",
    "our numerical calculation shows that implementation of this quantum algorithm is feasible within the present circuit qed technique .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we review the refined dj algorithm . in sec .",
    "iii , we present a protocol to construct the 35 @xmath0-controlled phase gates . in sec .",
    "iv , we discuss how to implement this dj algorithm with superconducting transmon qutrits coupled to a cavity via resonant interaction , and analyze the experimental feasibility . a concluding summary is given in sec .",
    "the dj algorithm is aimed at distinguishing the constant function from the balanced functions on @xmath4 inputs .",
    "the function @xmath5 takes either @xmath6 or @xmath7 for the constant function , the function values are constant ( @xmath6 or @xmath8 ) for all @xmath4 inputs .",
    "in contrast , for the balanced function , the function values are equal to 1 for half of all the possible inputs , and @xmath6 for the other half . using the dj algorithm , whether the function is constant or balanced",
    "can be determined by only one query . however",
    ", a classical algorithm would require @xmath9 queries to answer the same problem , which grows exponentially with input size .",
    "-qubit deutsch - jozsa algorithm.,width=12 ]    the refined dj algorithm was proposed by collins _",
    "et al . _ in 2001 [ 33 ] , which is illustrated in fig .  1 .",
    "this refined dj algorithm is described below :    \\(i ) each input query qubit is prepared in the initial state @xmath10    \\(ii ) perform a hadamard transformation @xmath11 on each qubit , resulting in @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) . as a result ,",
    "the @xmath14-qubit initial state @xmath15 changes to the state @xmath16 ( denoted as @xmath17)@xmath18    \\(iii ) apply the @xmath0-controlled phase shift @xmath19 , described by @xmath20 which leads the state @xmath21 to the state @xmath22 ( denoted as @xmath23 ) .",
    "\\(iv ) perform another hadamard transformation @xmath11 on each qubit . as a result ,",
    "the state @xmath23 becomes @xmath24    \\(v ) measure the final state of the @xmath14 qubits .",
    "if the @xmath14 qubits are measured in the state @xmath25 then @xmath26 is constant . however , if they are measured in other @xmath14-qubit computational basis states , then @xmath5 is balanced .",
    "this is because the amplitude @xmath27 of the state @xmath28 is given by @xmath29 which is @xmath30 for a constant @xmath5 while @xmath6 for a balanced @xmath5 .",
    "one can see that when compared with the original dj algorithm [ 29 ] , this refined dj algorithm does not need an auxiliary working qubit .",
    "hence , it requires one qubit fewer than the original dj algorithm .",
    "consequently , its physical implementation requires one fewer two - state system .",
    "for a @xmath14-qubit dj algorithm , there are a total of @xmath31 balanced functions , among which only @xmath32 balanced functions are nontrivial if the symmetry is taken into account .",
    "for the three - qubit dj algorithm , i.e. , @xmath33 there thus exist @xmath34 nontrivial balanced functions @xmath35 ( see table i ) . in this section ,",
    "we show how to construct the 35 @xmath0-controlled phase gates , by using single - qubit @xmath36 gates , two - qubit cp gates , and two - target - qubit cp gates .    a single qubit @xmath36 gate results in the transformation @xmath37 while @xmath38 a two - qubit cp gate @xmath39 on qubits @xmath40 and @xmath41 considered here is described as follows @xmath42 which implies that if and only if the control qubit @xmath40 ( the first qubit ) is in the state @xmath43 , a phase flip happens to the state @xmath43 of the target qubit @xmath41 ( the second qubit ) , but nothing happens otherwise . in addition , a two - target - qubit cp gate @xmath44 with the control qubit @xmath40 and the two target qubits @xmath41 and @xmath45 is defined below @xmath46 which shows that if and only if the control qubit @xmath40 ( the first qubit ) is in the state @xmath47 a phase flip happens to the state @xmath43 of the target qubit @xmath41 ( the second qubit ) and the state @xmath43 of the target qubit @xmath48 ( the last qubit ) .",
    "the construction for each of the 35 @xmath0-controlled phase gates is listed in table ii .",
    "one can see from table ii that the 35 @xmath0-controlled phase gates @xmath49 are classified into the following four types : ( i ) type 1 includes seven @xmath0-controlled phase gates each constructed with single - qubit @xmath36 gates only ; ( ii ) type 2 contains twelve  @xmath0-controlled phase gates each constructed with single - qubit @xmath36 gates and one two - qubit cp gate ; ( iii ) type 3 has twelve @xmath0-controlled phase gates each constructed by using single - qubit @xmath36 gates and a two - target - qubit cp gate ; and ( iv )  type 4 involves four @xmath0-controlled phase gates each implemented with single - qubit @xmath36 gates , a two - qubit cp gate , and a two - target - qubit cp gate at most .",
    "using the protocol , we now discuss how to implement the three - qubit refined dj algorithm with three superconducting transmon qutrits ( @xmath50 ) each having three levels ( i.e. , the ground @xmath51 the first excited @xmath52 and the second excited level @xmath53 ) .",
    "we then estimate the fidelity of the operation , which is performed in a setup composed of three phase qutrits and a one - dimensional coplanar waveguide resonator .",
    "since the @xmath0-controlled phase gates belonging to type 1 are constructed using single - qubit gates only , their implementation does not require entanglement and thus can be realized in a classical way .",
    "therefore , in the following we focus on the @xmath0-controlled phase gates belonging to type 2 , type 3 , and type 4 . without loss of generality , let us consider the three @xmath0-controlled phase gates @xmath54 ( belonging to type 2)@xmath55 @xmath56(belonging to type 3)@xmath55 and @xmath57 ( belonging to type 4 ) . by comparing them with other @xmath0-controlled phase gates in the same types , it can be found that these three unitary gates @xmath58 and @xmath57 contain the same number of two - qubit cp gates or / and two - target - qubit cp gates but a greater or equal number of single - qubit gates than the other @xmath0-controlled phase gates in the same types .",
    "hence , if the three @xmath0-controlled phase gates @xmath54 , @xmath59 , and @xmath57 can be implemented , then other @xmath0-controlled phase gates in the same types can be achieved with a higher or equal fidelity . in this sense , to see how well the proposal works , it would be sufficient to explore the implementation feasibility of the following three joint quantum operations , described by @xmath60 where the gate operation sequence is from right to left .",

    "one can employ the drag pulse [ 34,35 ] , which can reduce the gate error by an order of magnitude relative to the state of the art , all based on smooth and feasible pulse shapes [ 34 ] .",
    "in addition , to shorten the gate time , the three  joint hamardard gates @xmath68 in eq . ( 4 ) are performed simultaneously , which can be achieved by turning on and off the pulses applied to the three qutrits at the same time . in the same manner ,",
