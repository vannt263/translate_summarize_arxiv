    "we believe that if @xmath3 contains an asymptotic value of @xmath4 then , similar to the case of exponential maps , there is no conjugacy between @xmath4 and any ( suitable ) disjoint type map @xmath6 on their escaping sets ; this is work in progress .",
    "however , we have no indication of what to expect for maps whose julia sets contain no asymptotic values but sequences of points with unbounded local degree",
    ". it would be very interesting to explore this problem , in particular since there are prominent examples of such maps like _ poincar functions _ corresponding to certain hyperbolic polynomials ; an elaboration of such an example is given in appendix b.      in section [ sec associate ] we develop the concept of orbifolds _ dynamically associated _ to a strongly subhyperbolic map @xmath4 ; the main consequence is that we obtain a hyperbolic orbifold @xmath47 such that @xmath4 is expanding with respect to the corresponding hyperbolic metric .",
