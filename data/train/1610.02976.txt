    "in the standard boltzmann - gibbs formulation of equilibrium statistical mechanics , time plays no role .",
    "once @xmath0 , the set of configurations ( or microstates ) of the system of interest is chosen , the energy functional ( hamiltonian ) @xmath1 is provided , and the conditions for equilibrium are specified , then @xmath2 , the probability for finding the system in @xmath3 is known . this structure is built on boltzmann s fundamental hypothesis : @xmath4 for an isolated system with total energy @xmath5 . from here , various other ensembles and their associated @xmath6 s follow .",
    "the main task is to compute averages of various observable quantities @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "the boltzmann - gibbs paradigm is clearly inadequate to describe many stochastic processes in nature .",
    "in addition to a need to describe time dependent phenomena ( e.g. , autocorrelations ) , there are many systems which interact with the environment in a manner that _ violates _ time reversal .",
    "in particular , _ all _ biological systems consume nutrients and discard waste , with processes that clearly can not be reversed in time . in this case , the system settles into _ non - equilibrium steady states _ ( ness ) , with characteristics absent from systems in thermal equilibrium .",
    "chief among these are the presence of probability currents and loops @xcite , much like those in magnetostatics . in this brief note , we report some observable consequences of these current loops , in both manifestly cyclic behavior and more subtle realizations .",
    "we will also point to the notion of probability angular momentum  and relate it to a more familiar quantity : the two point correlation at _ unequal _ times .    for the simplest stochastic process that leads to ness",
    ", we may start with a master equation for the time dependent @xmath9 , with rates that violate detailed balance ( db ) .",
    "in general , this equation takes the form @xmath10 \\nonumber \\\\      & \\equiv & \\sum_{q ' } k(q ' \\rightarrow q ) ,      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the transition rate for the system in @xmath12 to become one in @xmath3 and @xmath13 is the _ net _ probability current from @xmath12 to @xmath3 .",
    "now , db is often displayed as @xmath14 $ ] , so that , for a system in thermal equilibrium with stationary @xmath15 , the currents @xmath16 vanish identically .",
    "( note that quantities in the stationary state are associated with @xmath17 . ) by contrast , for processes modeled by @xmath18 s that violate db , some @xmath16 s in the ness must be non - zero and must form closed loops .",
    "though the master equation is the most general formulation for this class of stochastic processes , we will restrict ourselves , for simplicity , to configuration spaces described by continuous variables , @xmath19 ( or just @xmath20 ) in arbitrary dimensions , and evolution controlled by the fokker - planck equation ( fpe ) : @xmath21 here , @xmath22 and @xmath23 represent the diffusive and drift aspects , respectively .",
    "a more intuitive description , as well as rules for coding simulations , is the langevin equation @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a gaussian noise with @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "as the fpe is just a continuity equation , we can identify the probability current here as @xmath28 .",
    "of course , the stationary distribution , @xmath29 , satisfies @xmath30 , i.e. , @xmath31 . in this approach ,",
    "the dynamics satisfies db provided @xmath32",
    "^{\\gamma \\alpha } \\left ( \\partial^{\\beta } d_{\\alpha \\beta } -v_{\\alpha } \\right ) $ ] is the gradient of some scalar function @xmath33 , i.e. , @xmath34 .",
    "then , it is straightforward to show that @xmath35 with @xmath36 .",
    "our interest here are processes which violate this condition , when @xmath37 is non - trivial .",
    "being divergenceless , it can be expressed ( in 3 dimensions ) as curl of @xmath38 , the stream function ( in the language of fluid dynamics ) , while @xmath39 is known as the vorticity , @xmath40 .",
    "angular momentum , a familiar concept from textbooks on classical mechanics and fluid dynamics , is associated with mass in motion : @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 ( where @xmath44 is the fluid current ) .",
    "we transfer this fluids concept to probability by considering the mapping @xmath45 , so that @xmath46 is a quantity of interest and naturally named probability angular momentum .   of course",
    ", in arbitrary dimensions , rotations and angular momenta are not vectors , but pseudo tensors .",
    "thus , instead of a vector @xmath47 , we should consider a matrix @xmath48 , with elements @xmath49 and @xmath50 note that , due to the normalization condition @xmath51 , our mass  is unity , so that the unit of @xmath48 is just @xmath52 , precisely that of diffusion .",
    "this remarkable feature is not coincidental , as the intimate connection between them will be shown in the next section .",
    "we further note that , in a ness , we have @xmath53 , so that @xmath54 is independent of the choice of the origin of @xmath20 ( and is just the total vorticity ) .",
    "other familiar concepts such as angular velocity @xmath55 and inertia tensor , @xmath56 , also have analogs .",
    "specifically , we see that @xmath57 maps to the two point correlation @xmath58 . meanwhile , in analog with @xmath59",
    ", we can define our angular velocity via @xmath60 @xcite and come up with the equivalent of @xmath61 .",
    "we end this section with a not - so - familiar generalization of angular momentum .",
    "if the trajectory of a point mass @xmath62 is known , then we may consider the quantity @xmath63 , the magnitude of which is just the area of the parallelogram spanned by the two vectors .",
    "clearly , it is related to the angular momentum by @xmath64 .",
    "the analogous generalization to @xmath65 here is a special two point correlation function : @xmath66,\\ ] ] where @xmath67 is the _ joint _ probability .",
    "if @xmath68 , then @xmath67 is the product of the conditional probability , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 . regarding the fpe ( eq .  [ eq : fpe ] ) as a schrdinger equation",
    ", @xmath71 is the familiar propagator in quantum mechanics . as in the point mass case , we have @xmath72 meanwhile , we see that @xmath73 is just twice the antisymmetric part of the two point correlation at arbitrary times , @xmath74 .",
    "being antisymmetric , it is necessarily odd under exchange @xmath75 . in the stationary state ,",
    "translation invariance prevails and so , @xmath76 depends only on the difference @xmath77 .",
    "since it is _ odd _ under time reversal , @xmath78 is a concrete measure of db violation and irreversibility in a stationary state .    while the framework presented above",
    "is valid for all stochastic processes , it is valuable to illustrate these ideas in an explicitly solvable system : the linear gaussian model ( lgm ) @xcite . in an lgm ,",
    "@xmath79 ( elements of @xmath80 ) are constants , while @xmath81 is linear in @xmath20 , as in generalized simple harmonic oscillators ( sho ) : @xmath82 .",
    "( refer to eqs .",
    "[ eq : fpe ] and [ eq : langevin ] . )",
    "thus , the model is completely defined by two matrices , @xmath80 and @xmath83 . of course",
    ", @xmath80 must be positive symmetric , while the real parts of the eigenvalues of @xmath83 must be negative ( for the stability of the process ) . if @xmath84 is symmetric , then db is satisfied and the scalar @xmath85 is @xmath86 . if not , then the stationary @xmath29 is still a gaussian@xcite : @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is fixed by @xcite @xmath89 = -\\mathbb{d}$ ] and @xmath90 stands for the symmetric part of .   clearly , @xmath88 is the covariance matrix in the steady state , i.e. , the equal time two point function .",
    "( note that @xmath88 is not the same as @xmath91 ! )",
    "meanwhile , we have @xmath92 , which leads to @xmath93 \\vec{\\nabla}p^{\\ast}$ ] . since @xmath94 $ ]",
    ", the sum @xmath95 $ ] is @xmath96 $ ] , the _ antisymmetric _ part of @xmath97 .",
    "thus , @xmath37 is manifestly divergence free while the stream function ( a matrix here ) can be identified as @xmath98 p^{\\ast}$ ] .",
    "moreover , it is straightforward to obtain an explicit expression for @xmath54 : @xmath99    \\label{l*}\\ ] ] and its generalization : @xmath100\\]]in this setting , we see that diffusion ( @xmath80 ) and angular momentum ( @xmath101 ) are just the symmetric and antisymmetric parts of one matrix : @xmath102 .",
    "thus , they must have the same units , and play complementary roles in any stochastic process .",
    "finally , note that the angular velocity matrix is given by @xmath103 @xcite , while @xmath104 is the analog of @xmath105 .",
    "having established that there must be some cyclic behavior in any ness , we ask if this feature is displayed ( a ) prominently and manifestly , or ( b ) in some obscure and subtle way .",
    "to answer which category a system belongs to , we must go beyond the average values of angular momenta ( eqs .  [ lab ] and",
    "[ l * ] ) and study the full distribution : @xmath106 \\right)$ ] . for simplicity ,",
    "let us consider a two - dimensional @xmath20-space , so that there is only one independent component in any antisymmetric matrix , e.g. , @xmath107 .",
    "then , our task simplifies to the study of @xmath108 . from simulations ,",
    "it can be obtained by computing @xmath109 from a long trajectory @xmath110 ( in the steady state ) , and compiling a histogram .",
    "apart from these simple examples , we have recently studied other systems in ness , including an epidemic model with asymmetric infection rates @xcite and a heterogeneous non - linear q - voter model @xcite .",
    "both settle into ness that display only very subtle cyclic behavior . here , let us present preliminary results concerning a much larger and complex system : variations in the heat content of our oceans . as a stochastic process , the oceans are heated in the tropical regions and suffer loss mostly from the polar regions , forming clearly a non - equilibrium system . over long periods",
    ", it appears quasi - stationary and may be regarded as a ness .",
    "unfortunately , high quality data for these anomalies in the real oceans form only a small set and date from about half a century ago  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we can combine the data into two time series , @xmath133 and @xmath134 , and study both @xmath135 and @xmath108 .",
    "the results are very similar to those of the sho s in fig .  1 .",
    "the details are quite complicated and will be published elsewhere  @xcite . here",
    ", we turn to a much longer ( about a millennium ) data set , created using the state - of - the - art community earth system model  @xcite . though non - trivial complications concerning the analysis also exist here @xcite , the results are consistent with the those from real data . illustrating with a small portion of this trajectory and showing the @xmath136 in fig .",
    "2 , we recognize that these ness aspects are similar to those in the two - temperature sho case . however , there is a subtle difference : @xmath137 is negative , a sign naively opposite to that in the sho s .",
    "this difference indicates that temperature difference is not the only controlling factor for the sign of @xmath130 .",
    "the more significant factor is the level of the noise associated with each degree of freedom .",
    "details of this kind of analysis and understanding will be presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the angular momenta @xmath54 and the two point correlation at unequal times @xmath138 are , for _ any _ ness , excellent measures of the underlying time - reversal and db violating dynamics . beyond these simplest quantities , any multipoint correlation functions at unequal times",
    "will provide a platform for measuring such characteristics . in recent years",
    ", there has been other attempts to characterize cyclic behavior in ness , e.g. , those by russell and blythe @xcite .",
    "these approaches rely on the properties of angular displacements ( in conffiguration space ) rather than angular momenta . while there are some advantages to the former ( e.g. , intuitively understandable , independence of the scales of @xmath20 ) , there are also disadvantages ( e.g. , over - emphasis of motion near the origin , non - anayticity at @xmath139 ) . by contrast",
    ", @xmath48 is analytically tractable , while it also enjoys intimate relationships with other key quantities , such as the probability current @xmath140 , the two point function @xmath141 , and the diffusion matrix @xmath80 .",
    "we have also shown that , for certain systems in ness , db violation is so patently obvious that the irreversible nature is prominent and manifest .",
    "for example , hares do _ not _ prey on lynxes ! on the other hand , many ness do not display such clear behavior , as the time - reversal violating aspects are more obscure and subtle .",
    "clearly , it is desirable to understand more deeply the mechanisms which control the outcomes of a system .",
    "what are the parameters which , when varied continuously , will take a system from category ( a ) to ( b ) ? is the transitionabrupt and discontinuous ? or smooth and continuous ?",
    "is it possible that @xmath136 displays a combination of both components ?",
    "we believe this is a promising and rich avenue for future research , both as a novel measure to characterize different systems in ness and as a possible step towards a overarching framework for the foundations of non - equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "we are grateful to a mellor , m mobilia , a d nelson , b schmittmann and u c tuber for enlightening discussions .",
