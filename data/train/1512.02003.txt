    "with the rich _ kepler _ dataset , much progress has been made recently in measuring precise radii and masses of sub - neptune mass exoplanets .",
    "both measurements are essential for characterizing planetary bulk densities and modeling bulk compositions .",
    "the _ kepler _ mission has substantially increased the number of characterized sub - neptune mass planets .",
    "the sub - neptune regime in mass is of particular interest because it includes the transition from rocky planets to worlds that retain deep atmospheres .",
    "planetary radii relative to the host star are directly measured from the depth of transit , and precision in absolute planetary radii rests largely on how well the host star can be characterized . radial velocity spectroscopy ( rv )",
    "has provided the bulk of mass measurements of transiting exoplanets ( @xcite ) . however , among sub - neptune mass planets , rv mass detections are limited to planets on short orbital periods , because the rv signal depends on the strength of planet - star interactions and declines with orbital distance .",
    "@xcite conducted an rv survey of  bright \" stars with short - period sub - neptune - size planets in the kepler field , and among planets below 10 @xmath3 they found strong detections up to around 16 days for kepler-102 e ( koi-82.01 ) and kepler-96 b ( koi-261.01 ) , as well as useful upper limits within this mass range as far out as 69 days ( kepler-409 b , koi-1925.01 ) . using the known sample of exoplanets characterized with rv",
    ", @xcite found that most planets larger than 1.6 @xmath4 with orbital periods up to @xmath550 days are likely volatile rich .    complementing this sample , transit timing variations ( ttv ) probe interplanetary perturbations ( @xcite ) and are more readily detectable at longer orbital periods .",
    "however , the diminishing likelihood of transiting at longer orbital periods , coupled with the four - year _ kepler _ baseline limits the orbital period of planets that have been characterized by transit timing .",
    "ttvs have measured planetary masses below 10 @xmath3 with orbital periods ranging from around 7.6 days ( kepler-18 c , @xcite ) to almost venus - like distances at 191 days ( kepler-87 c , @xcite ) .",
    "ttvs have constrained the masses of non - transiting planets even further out , e.g. , at kepler-419 , which has a likely massive planet beyond 660 days @xcite .",
    "the strongest detections of dense exoplanets , mostly in rv but also including kepler-36 b @xcite , indicate a primarily rocky compositions for planets up to @xmath6 @xmath4 in size @xcite .",
    "however , strong mass upper limits on the weaker detections of slightly larger planets include several low - mass planets that are too low in bulk density to be rocky ( e.g. , kepler-11 b and kepler-11 f , @xcite ) .",
    "there are clear differences in the properties of planets that are characterized by ttv from those characterized by rv",
    ". some of this may be due to target selection and/or detection biases in rv .",
    "in particular , most _ kepler _ targets with rv follow - up have been selected based on their size @xcite . additionally , the majority of planets below 10 @xmath3 that have been characterized by rv have incident fluxes above 100 times that of earth .",
    "this sample includes low - mass planets that are unlikely to retain deep atmospheres .",
    "however , the sensitivity of ttv to low mass planets beyond the range of rv has enabled the characterization of volatile rich planets that are far enough from their hosts to have avoided significant mass loss .",
    "the precise ttv mass detections to date show a remarkably diversity in planetary density in the mass range from 2 - 8 @xmath3 ( @xcite ) .",
    "_ kepler _ identified over 100 multi - planet systems with transit timing variations caused by mutually perturbing , transiting exoplanets ( @xcite ) .",
    "only a small fraction have been analyzed in detail using the complete seventeen quarters of _ kepler _ data from 2009 to 2013 ( q17 ) with short cadence data if available .",
    "these include the three planets of kepler-138 @xcite .",
    "other studies have measured precise masses using the data through q16 ( kepler-79 , @xcite ) , q14 ( kepler-11 , @xcite ) , or earlier datasets , as well as q17 data in long cadence ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in this paper , we analyze ttvs to provide robust planetary mass measurements using the _ kepler _ dataset of transit times .",
    "our method of light curve analysis and measurements of transit times ( @xcite ) followed by detailed fitting of transit times with dynamical models has been demonstrated to invert the ttv signal and recover exoplanet masses that are reproducible and in many cases are insensitive to uncertainties in the data set being analyzed . in @xcite ,",
    "the solutions of ttv inversion were used to generate synthetic transit times with uncertainties .",
    "the recovery of the synthesized dynamical masses and orbital parameters validated both the measurement of the transit times from the light curve and ttv inversion with dynamical fitting . here",
    "we characterize 18 transiting planets in systems where detected ttvs are attributable to mutually perturbing transiting planets .",
    "we also test the sensitivity of our solutions to the choice of eccentricity priors and the possibility of non - gaussian timing uncertainties ( e.g. , outliers ) .",
    "the structure of this paper are as follows . in section 2",
    ", we describe our procedure for fitting transit timing data and exploring posteriors for parameter estimation , our tests for sensitivity to outlying transit times , our tests against different priors on orbital eccentricity , tests against independently measured transit times , and our tests for long term stability . in section 3",
    "we present our ttv results for each planetary system . in section 4",
    "we explore whether there is any evidence of likely apsidal alignment among our solutions given that ttv degeneracies can favor apsidally - aligned configurations . in section 5",
    "we present our analysis of stellar parameters to characterize true planetary masses given our ttv solutions , and in section 6 we compare our well - characterized planets to others on mass - radius - flux diagrams .",
    "we simulate planetary orbits with an eighth order dormand - prince runge - kutta integrator ( @xcite ) and compare simulated transit times to the observed transit times .",
    "ttvs are expressed as the difference between the observed transit time and a calculated linear fit to the transit times ( o - c ) . in each case",
    ", we have assumed coplanar orbits since ttv amplitudes change only to second - order in mutual inclinations ( @xcite ) .    for planet pairs with large orbital period ratios",
    ", ttvs can be sensitive to mutual inclinations , but mutual inclinations do not make a major contribution to ttvs of planets near low - order mean motion resonances @xcite , which dominate the ttvs in our sample .",
    "furthermore , the distribution of transit duration and orbital period ratios among _ kepler _ s multi - planet systems imply that typical inclinations in _ kepler _ s population of multi - transiting systems are a few degrees or less @xcite .",
    "we assume all the ttvs are attributable to mutual perturbations between the known transiting planet candidates . in some multi - planet models",
    ", we exclude transiting planets that have no observed and no expected ttvs given the ratio of their orbital periods with the planets that have detected ttvs . in these cases we performed integrations including all known planets to verify the accuracy of this approximation .      for any multi - planet model",
    ", we fit five parameters per planet : the orbital period ( @xmath7 ) , the time of the first transit ( @xmath8 ) after our chosen epoch ( bjd-2,455,680 ) , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and the ratio of the planet masses to their host , which we refer to as `` dynamical mass '' throughout .",
    "we express dynamical masses in the form @xmath11 for easy conversion to earth - masses for any estimate of stellar mass .",
    "we evaluated the goodness of fit to the transit timing data ( * x * ) for each simulated model @xmath12 for a choice of parameters @xmath13 using the likelihood function @xmath14 } { \\sqrt { 2\\pi \\sigma_{i}^2 } } \\label{likelihoodfn}\\ ] ] where there are @xmath15 observed transit times , and * y * are simulated transit times associated with the model parameters @xmath13 . to minimize numerical round - off error in this product , we calculate the familiar @xmath16 statistic for all model evaluations : @xmath17 in comparing any two models , the ratio of log - likelihoods is proportional to the difference in @xmath18 , and the summation in equation  [ chisq ] cancels .",
    "we adopt uniform priors in dynamical masses , assumed to be positive definite , and uniform priors in orbital periods and the time after first transit after epoch for all planets .",
    "we fixed all orbital inclinations at 90@xmath19 .",
    "we adopted gaussian priors in the eccentricity vector components ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) , which effectively induce a rayleigh distribution prior on scalar eccentricity .",
    "we choose @xmath20 and @xmath21 as our eccentricity variables instead of @xmath22 and @xmath23 , since this increases the rate of convergence for planets with small eccentricities where @xmath23 is poorly constrained ( @xcite ) .",
    "since ttvs are sensitive to orbital eccentricity , we repeated our analysis with two choices of eccentricity prior , as we explain in the following subsection .        for our primary results in table  [ tbl - results ] ,",
    "we have assumed a gaussian prior on each of the eccentricity vector components ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) with a mean of zero and variance 0.1 .",
    "this corresponds to a rayleigh distribution with scale width 0.1 as the prior for scalar eccentricity .",
    "this is consistent with the distribution of eccentricities amongst _ kepler _ s exoplanets found by @xcite using an independent analysis of measured transit durations .",
    "this wide distribution is also consistent with the known eccentricities of giant rv planets ( @xcite ) . a narrower eccentricity distribution of characteristic width@xmath26 was found by @xcite by comparing a sample of well - characterized transiting exoplanet hosts with their inferred photometric densities .    an even narrower eccentricity distribution ( of characteristic width @xmath27=0.02 ) was found for a sample of compact multi - planet systems with ttvs by @xcite .",
    "while this is the most relevant sample for our purposes , we adopt the wider prior to test where the ttvs can provide tight constraints on eccentricity .",
    "where eccentricities are poorly constrained by the ttvs , we compare our dynamical masses with solutions from a narrower eccentricity prior ( with scale length 0.02 ) , to test whether our masses and orbital solutions are robust against the choice of prior for eccentricity .    in most cases",
    ", we found that individual eccentricities are weakly constrained , with the posterior for the eccentricity vector components being strongly affected by our prior .",
    "however , we have inferred tight constraints on relative eccentricity vectors since the vector components are highly correlated . this correlation is expected for near first - order mean motion resonant ttvs , as can be seen from the analytical solutions derived by @xcite .",
    "the solution breaks the eccentricity vector up into the sum of two component vectors : a free component that is constant for timescales that are short compared to apsidal precession , and a forced component that varies over the coherence time of near - resonant perturbations .",
    "each planet s free eccentricity vector can be expressed in complex notation ( @xmath28 ) , although the periodic ttv signal is not sensitive to these directly .",
    "rather , the amplitude of a sinusoidal ttv signal caused by a mutually interacting pair near first - order resonance depends on the mass of the perturber , the orbital periods of both planets , and the conjugate of the complex sum of free eccentricities , @xmath29 , where , given the free eccentricity of an inner planet @xmath30 , and an outer planet @xmath31 , @xmath32 here , the coefficients @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the sums of laplace coefficients of order unity and solved to first order by @xcite as a function of orbital period ratios .",
    "the ttvs are sensitive to the complex conjugate of the expression in equation  [ eqn : zfree ] , @xmath35 .",
    "since @xmath36 , @xmath35 is the difference between eccentricity vector components scaled by the coefficients @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and hence approximately proportional to the relative eccentricity .",
    "this leads to an eccentricity - eccentricity degeneracy in ttvs , where the relative eccentricities between planets may be well - constrained , but their absolute eccentricity vector components are poorly constrained . with @xmath35 constant , the derivatives of the vector components of the outer planet with respect to the same component of the inner planet , depends only on laplace coefficients .",
    "the gradients are : @xmath37 hence , if the orbital periods are known precisely , one can easily predict the correlation between the eccentricity vector components of neighboring planets that have detected ttvs .",
    "figure  [ fig : residuals ] shows the distribution of residuals for all measured and model transit times in this study at the best fit solution for each planet , with comparisons to three normalized and symmetric statistical distributions , a gaussian , and student t - distributions with 2 and 4 degrees of freedom , respectively .",
    "the central peak slightly exceeds a gaussian distribution , consistent with moderate over - fitting in our best fit models , but unlikely to affect our mcmc posteriors . on the other hand ,",
    "the wings of the distribution reveal far more outliers than expected from gaussian uncertainties on measured transit times .",
    "these data have more leverage in model fitting .",
    "hence , to check the robustness of our results against these outliers , we repeated our analysis assuming measurement uncertainties followed a student - t distribution with 2 degrees of freedom . in this case , the likelihood function is : @xmath38 and the log of the likelihood becomes @xmath39      for the systems studied in this paper , the majority of transit times are measured from short cadence data . all raw kepler photometry was read from fits files retrieved from mast .",
    "q1-q14 photometry was based on data release 21 , q15 , q16 and q17 used data releases 20 , 22 and 23 respectively .",
    "all extracted and reported time stamps have barycentric times reported in terrestrial dynamic time ( tdb ) .",
    "multiple methods have been employed to detrend _ kepler _ light curves , fit transit models and measure transit times with their uncertainties .",
    "@xcite compared the transit times of three independent analyses of the light curve of kepler-11 to identify outliers . for this study",
    ", we modeled the light curves using the methods described in @xcite , using _ kepler _",
    "s complete dataset of 17 quarters including both long cadence and any available short cadence transit data .",
    "we test the sensitivity of our results by repeating our analysis using the transit times from the q17 holczer et al .",
    "ttv catalog , with short cadence times included where available ( holczer et al .",
    "2015 , submitted ) . where dynamical masses were found to be discrepant between datasets of measured transit times , the planetary masses were deemed `` not secure '' and excluded from the mass - radius diagram .",
    "the systems were found by identifying appropriate period ratios of all planet pairs in the online exoplanet database at the nasa exoplanet archive .",
    "we chose suitable systems for measuring dynamical masses by performing maximum - likelihood fits to the long cadence transit timing data of all known systems with one or more pairs of planets with near - resonant orbital periods , using the levenberg - marquardt algorithm , and with measured transit times from @xcite .",
    "the levenberg - marquardt algorithm efficiently converges to a local minimum near the initial values for free parameters .",
    "one can estimate uncertainties from the local curvature of the @xmath18 surface at the local minimum .",
    "however , a major limitation of this method for estimating uncertainties is that it approximates the @xmath18 surface as parabolic and unimodal in the dimensions of all free parameters .",
    "we tested this assumption for our ttv models by searching for regions of high likelihood using repeated levenberg - marquardt minimization starting with initial values of @xmath24 and @xmath25 along a grid for each planet .",
    "we used a single set of values for the initial orbital periods and phases since these quantities are tightly constrained by the transit times . in all cases , we found multiple but statistically consistent solutions near the overall best fit .    performing initial fits on this sample of systems , we sought systems with likely detections of low - mass exoplanets .",
    "we selected systems with a wide range of orbital periods , including systems with apparent synodic chopping ( including kepler-26 and kepler-177 ) .",
    "we rejected systems where known stellar rotation periods are nearly commensurate with a planetary orbital period , including kepler-128 ( koi-274 ) , whose 13.6 day rotation period has a near 5:3 commensurability with the orbital period of kepler-128 c , since this could cause spurious ttv signals that would affect our mass measurements .",
    "we rejected systems where the posterior did not provide useful lower bounds on planetary masses .",
    "however , we included the three - planet system kepler-105 that included two weak detections , because the third planet was well - constrained in our levenberg - marquardt fits , and the planets have particularly short orbital periods compared to most planets with ttv analyses , which may make this system a viable target for rv follow - up .",
    "kepler-26 , kepler-29 , kepler-49 and kepler-57 were amongst the first systems to have planets confirmed via anti - correlated ttv signals ( @xcite ) .",
    "we identified kepler-177 as having a particularly strong chopping signal , deep transits and low masses , indicative of likely extremely low planetary densities .",
    "we also noted strong ttvs at kepler-60 possibly due to librations within a three - body laplace - like resonance chain @xcite .      to appropriately estimate relevant parameters with their uncertainties , we explored regions of interest that had been found via our initial fits using a differential evolution markov chain monte carlo algorithm ( de - mcmc @xcite ) .",
    "using mcmc allows for the exploration a region of interest without becoming trapped in shallow local minima . of the many variants of mcmc ,",
    "the differential evolution mcmc algorithm is particularly efficient for exploring posteriors of correlated variables , which as we shall see , is common in the high dimensional modeling of ttv systems .",
    "it employs multiple `` walkers '' exploring the region of interest in parallel , with proposals calculated from the displacement vectors between other walkers chosen at random , increasing the likelihood that a proposal will be roughly parallel to the direction of correlation between variables .",
    "we employed three times as many walkers as free parameters in our model fitting ; i.e , 30 walkers for the two - planet systems and 45 walkers for the three - planet systems .      for planet pairs near first - order mean motion resonances , the ttvs are dominated by the sinusoidal signal expressed in the approximations of @xcite , from which we identify the degeneracy in mass and eccentricity in ttv inversion . in some cases , however , the degeneracy can be broken where high frequencies ttvs are detected , like the so - called  chopping \" at synodic frequencies ( @xcite ) .    for two systems that we include here ,",
    "kepler-26 and kepler-177 , we test our results with the analytical solutions of @xcite .",
    "these are accurate to first - order in planet - star mass ratios , first - order in eccentricity and assume co - planarity .",
    "accuracy to first order in eccentricities is satisfied if eccentricities @xmath40 , which is likely given the narrow dispersion in eccentricities among kepler s multi - planet systems ( @xcite ) . where there is a second - order dependence on eccentricity , e.g. , near second - order mean motion resonances",
    ", the solutions of @xcite provide an even more general analysis of ttv frequencies .",
    "our analytical fits used an affine - invariant markov chain monte carlo routine in order to determine parameter estimates and uncertainties @xcite .",
    "we integrated samples of our posteriors for 1 myr using the hnbody symplectic integrator code @xcite to determine if the requirement of long - term stability places additional constraints on the masses and orbits of the planetary systems . here",
    "we make a compromise between testing stability as long as numerically feasible for one solution ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and testing for stability for a sample from our posteriors .",
    "for this study , since many of the eccentricity posteriors were poorly constrained , we chose to integrate samples of 50 sample solutions for the two - planet systems and 45 solutions for the three - planet models for 1 myr ( from the last generation of walkers in the de - mcmc chains ) .",
    "we defined systems as unstable if any planet was expelled during the simulation , but none were found to be unstable .",
    "our summary statistics from ttv analysis are the medians and the 68.3% and 95.5% credible intervals for dynamical masses , with high and low posterior tails of equal likelihood excluded from the credible intervals .",
    "we also report calculated radii from analysis of light curve transit profiles .",
    "we converted dynamical mass posteriors to actual mass posteriors by drawing from posteriors of the mass of each planet s host star , and the mean and variance of planetary radii are calculated by sampling posteriors of stellar radii .",
    "the resulting planetary masses , radii , and density medians and credible intervals are summarized in table  [ tbl - results ] .",
    "we also report credible intervals on incident flux , following sampling of stellar effective temperature and @xmath41 posteriors measured from light curve fitting .",
    "kepler-26 has four known transiting planets ( in ascending order of orbital period , they are named kepler-26 d , b , c and e ) , although only the intermediate pair ( kepler-26 b and c ) show significant ttvs @xcite .",
    "the period ratio between the innermost pair is 3.46 and that for the outermost pair is 2.71 , which are far enough from any first or second order mean motion resonance to make any detectable ttvs unlikely .",
    "we therefore expect no ttvs in kepler-26 d or e and we detect none . furthermore , as these are the smallest two of the four planets , at 1.2 and 2.1 @xmath4 respectively , they are likely to be less massive than the interacting pair , and hence we exclude them from our nominal ttv model .",
    "the intermediate pair of planets orbit near the second - order 7:5 mean motion resonance , with an expected ttv period of 658 days , easily discernible in figure  [ fig:250-sim ] .    in table",
    "[ tbl - koi0250 ] , we include our adopted parameters from model fitting and the results of various tests on our measured dynamical masses , following posterior sampling with an alternative eccentricity prior , robust fitting with a student - t@xmath42 distribution on uncertainties , a four - planet model that includes the two planets that show no ttvs , analytical modeling of the chopping signal , and using the alternative measured times of the holczer catalogue . with one exception ,",
    "all tests showed close agreement with our adopted parameters .",
    "we found that the analytical formula of @xcite yielded solutions that are discrepant at the 1@xmath27 level .",
    "however , the first - order formula for this system is likely inadequate because the planets are near the 7:5 ( second - order ) mean motion resonance .",
