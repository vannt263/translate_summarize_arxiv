    "while cosmologists have accumulated extensive evidence for an early - universe inflationary period , the cause and dynamical specifics of that epoch remain unclear .",
    "current and upcoming measurements will provide increasingly precise measurements of the effects of inflation , demanding that theorists persist in relating these observations to inflation s underlying mechanism .",
    "primordial non - gaussianity is a popular discriminant among the proposed models of inflation ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the scalar curvature perturbation , @xmath7 , which appears in the space - space part of the metric in a suitable gauge as @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 is the robertson - walker scale factor ) , is a convenient quantity relating the observables such as the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and the large - scale structure ( lss ) of the universe to the primordial perturbations generated during inflation . in particular , this quantity is conserved outside the horizon for single - field inflation ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we shall define the two - point function ( power spectrum , denoted as @xmath10 ) and the three - point function ( bispectrum , denoted as @xmath11 ) of @xmath7 in fourier space as follows : @xmath12 the current data constrain the shape of @xmath10 as @xmath13 with @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the so - called local - form bispectrum defined as @xcite @xmath15 , \\label{eq : localform}\\ ] ] is particularly interesting , both because a detection of the primordial bispectrum at the level of @xmath16 would disfavor single - field inflation @xcite and because it is easy to measure the primordial signal since few late - time effects can produce the local - form bispectrum .",
    "the most important contamination of @xmath17 known to date is due to the lensing - integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect bispectrum @xcite , which can be calculated precisely and removed .",
    "the contamination of @xmath17 due to non - linearity in the photon - baryon fluid has been shown to be at most one @xcite .",
    "the local - form bispectrum has the largest signal in the so - called `` squeezed triangle configuration , '' for which one of the wavenumbers , say , @xmath0 , is much smaller than the other two , @xmath18 .",
    "this can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : localform ] ) : as @xmath19 for a scale - invariant spectrum ( @xmath20 ) , the bispectrum is maximized when @xmath0 is taken to be small . in this limit ,",
    "one finds : @xmath21 for a scale - invariant spectrum .",
    "recently , agullo and parker have shown that a non - standard initial state of quantum fluctuations generated during single - field inflation can enhance the bispectrum in the squeezed configuration by a factor of @xmath5 , i.e. , @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "this would have profound implications for observations of the bispectrum in the squeezed configuration .",
    "for example , the signature in the bispectrum of cmb of this model was investigated in a paper by one of the authors @xcite , who found that the model could produce a measurable local @xmath23 signal in the cmb .",
    "the primordial bispectrum in the squeezed configuration was initially constrained mostly by measurements of the temperature anisotropy of the cmb @xcite . however , over time , tools for observing the bispectrum have proliferated , providing a variety of ways to compare inflationary models . in this paper",
    ", we will explore two such methods :    * in the large scale - structure ( lss ) of the universe , the local - form bispectrum leaves a signature by contributing a scale - dependence to the halo bias , @xmath24 @xcite . for the local - form bispectrum ,",
    "the scale dependence goes as @xmath25 ; however , for a modified initial state , this scale dependence can become @xmath26 .",
    "* anisotropy in the so - called @xmath2-type distortions of the black - body spectrum of the cmb can be correlated with the cmb temperature anisotropy measured on large scales .",
    "this correlation can be used to measure the bispectrum in the squeezed configuration but with a larger value of @xmath5 than previously thought possible @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : reviewing - model ] , we review the model under consideration . in section  [ sec : calculation ] , we give the form of the bispectrum and comment on potential uncertainties in the results . in section  [ sec : approximation ] , we discuss a useful approximation to the bispectrum in the squeezed configuration . in section  [ sec : scale - dpdt - bias ] , we calculate the signal of this model in the scale - dependent bias of lss . in section [ sec : mu - distortion ] , we calculate the signal of this model in the @xmath2-type distortion of the cmb black - body spectrum , correlated with the cmb temperature anisotropy on large scales .",
    "finally , we conclude in section [ sec : discussion ] .    throughout this paper",

    "we consider here single - field slow - roll inflation with a canonical kinetic term , where the action ( to lowest order in slow - roll ) can be written as @xcite @xmath34,\\cr    s_3 = & \\int d^4x \\frac{\\dot \\phi^4}{h^4 } a^5 h \\dot \\zeta^2 \\partial^{-2 } \\dot \\zeta.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we expand the curvature perturbation into creation , @xmath35 , and annihilation , @xmath36 , operators ( not to be confused with the robertson - walker scale factor , @xmath9 ) : @xmath37.\\ ] ] usually , one chooses an initial state so that a comoving observer in the approximately de sitter spacetime observes no particles ( i.e. , for this observer @xmath38 ) .",
    "this implies a positive - frequency mode function given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the conformal time ; for future reference , we note @xmath41    while this is certainly a reasonable assumption , it is an assumption , and all assumptions must be tested by observations .",
    "thus , a responsible scientist should ask :  _ if the initial state of @xmath7 was not in this preferred vacuum state ( known as the bunch - davies state ) , what are the implications for observations ?  _ our goal in this paper is not to construct candidate models of a modified initial state , but to study phenomenological consequences of such a modification , i.e. , to let our observations tell us about the initial state of quantum fluctuations .    once we adopt this approach , the next question is : `` how should we parametrize a modified initial state ? ''",
    "we will represent a modified initial state as a bogoliubov transformation of the above bunch - davies mode function : @xmath42 this is not the most general form one can write down ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , but it provides us with a reasonable starting point . in line with our previous goal",
    ", we will take the bogoliubov coefficients as given rather than trying to derive them from a fundamental theory . from the commutation relation of creation and annihilation operators , the coefficients @xmath43 and @xmath44 must satisfy @xmath45 .",
    "we also find that the occupation number of particles @xmath46 , i.e. , the expected number density of particles with momentum @xmath0 , is given by @xmath47 .",
    "these bogoliubov coefficients , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , encode information about physics on scales where we have limited information ; thus , they can vary widely without inconsistency .",
    "however , we can place some constraints on the coefficients by demanding that the theory reproduce the observed power spectrum ( including the spectral tilt , @xmath14 ) and that the energy in the fluctuations not back - react on the background inflaton dynamics @xcite .",
    "these requirements can be satisfied in a fairly natural way if we suppose that the coefficients are such that @xmath48 , where the cutoff momentum @xmath49 must be specified .",
    "the values allowed for @xmath50 depend on the value of @xmath49 @xcite ; for @xmath51 , i.e. , the scale of inflation , @xmath50 can be of order unity . additionally ,",
    "if we suppose that the smallest primordial scales observable today come from momenta sufficiently smaller than @xmath49 , then @xmath52 , i.e. , roughly constant in @xmath0 . remembering that @xmath53 and that only the relative phase between @xmath43 and @xmath44 is significant , we parametrize @xmath54    there is still uncertainty with respect to @xmath55 . as explained further in @xcite , we identify two scenarios as plausible behaviors : 1 ) @xmath56 , where @xmath57 for relevant @xmath0 , and 2 ) @xmath58 . in the latter scenario , one can tune the value of @xmath59 to give larger effects",
    "; we will generally show results that assume the value of @xmath59 that gives the largest signal . in this sense ( and for another reason discussed in @xcite ) , we consider the former scenario to be more conservative .",
    "the power spectrum of @xmath7 on super - horizon scales , @xmath60 , which seeds the observed fluctuations , is given simply by @xmath61 @xcite , i.e. , @xmath62 which becomes ( using eq .",
    "( [ eq : parm_al_bet ] ) ) @xmath63    the calculation of the bispectrum requires more thought .",

    ", there is an accepted prescription for calculations : we take @xmath77 , giving @xmath72 an imaginary component when its absolute value is large @xcite .",
    "the exponential terms in the integrand like @xmath78 ( see ( [ eq : bd_mode_fcn_deriv ] ) for their origin ) would ordinarily oscillate rapidly at very early times but are suppressed by the imaginary part of @xmath69 .",
    "note that this suppression depends on @xmath79 .",
    "however , when we allow for a more general initial state , we can have @xmath80 resulting in terms like @xmath81 , @xmath82 , etc .",
    "furthermore , one may object ( e.g. , for reasons of renormalizability ) to setting initial conditions in the infinite past , especially if some of the modes are excited ( i.e. , @xmath80 ) ; instead , one might prefer that initial conditions be set at some finite time . if we ignore this objection for a moment , one can still suppose that @xmath83 . by triangle inequalities ( e.g. , @xmath84 , etc . ) , the exponentials are still suppressed except at the precise folded limit @xmath85 ( note that this would result in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nbd - bisp ] ) but without the exponentials ) .    in this paper ,",
    "however , we will generally take the objection seriously and suppose that initial conditions were not set infinitely far in the past .",
    "unfortunately , this draws us into an area of active research which does not offer a definite formalism for calculations . here , as in @xcite ( though see @xcite ) , we will adopt the `` boundary effective field theory '' approach to non - bunch davies initial conditions @xcite , which like the other available approaches is not without problems ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in this approach ,",
    "one cuts off the integral given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : in - in - formalism ] ) at a finite @xmath69 , where the initial conditions are set .",
    "we shall assume that for excited modes @xmath0 ( i.e. , where @xmath86 ) , @xmath57 so that @xmath0 was deep inside the horizon at the initial time .",
    "this can be explained as expressing the requirement that the process for mode excitation was causal and thus , could only excite subhorizon modes .    performing the integral given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : integral ] ) , one obtains the bispectrum @xcite @xmath87,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath88 for @xmath89 , @xmath90 ; @xmath91 gives information about the initial conditions at @xmath69 .",
    "note that we ignore a field redefinition term ( derived in @xcite ) that is negligibly small for the purposes of this paper .",
    "first , note that we recover the standard bunch - davies result @xcite if we set @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 . in the squeezed limit , @xmath1",
    "and we get @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the slow - roll parameter , which is equivalent to @xmath97 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : locallimit ] ) ) .",
    "if we restore the field - redefinition piece we ignored , we obtain the full standard squeezed - limit bispectrum : @xmath98 @xcite .",
    "since we have assumed @xmath57 , the exponentials in the bispectrum ( [ eq : nbd - bisp ] ) oscillate rapidly and can , to a decent approximation , be ignored .",
    "then , one sees that the bispectrum peaks in the so - called `` folded triangle configuration , '' where one of the wavenumbers is approximately equal to the sum of the other two , i.e. , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , or @xmath101 ; this was noted earlier by @xcite . since the local bispectrum has no corresponding peak , this regime provides a way to distinguish the shape of this bispectrum from a purely local form .",
    "we shall come back to this point in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we can also investigate the squeezed configuration @xmath1 ; this configuration is in fact a special case of the folded limit @xmath102 when we additionally suppose that @xmath0 is much smaller than @xmath103 or @xmath104 . in this limit ,",
    "the third and fourth terms are larger than the first and second by a factor of @xmath105 ; the bispectrum becomes @xmath106 ( with a proportionality factor @xmath107 $ ] ) .",
    "note that this is enhanced relative to the local form in the squeezed configuration @xcite .",
    "we should highight that the exponential terms can not be completely ignored @xcite because they prevent the bispectrum from blowing up in the folded limit . in particular , the factor @xmath108 $ ] , which seems to blow up in the folded limit if one ignores the exponential , actually goes as @xmath109 .",
    "accounting for this behavior plays a role in the usefullness of the approximation we demonstrate in the next section .",
    "while the full form of the bispectrum given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : nbd - bisp ] ) is complicated , the observables that we shall discuss in this paper ( the scale - dependent halo bias in lss and the anisotropy in the @xmath2-type distortion of the cmb black - body spectrum ) depend primarily on the squeezed configuration , @xmath1 . therefore , it is useful to find an accurate approximation to the bispectrum in the squeezed configuration .",
    "in @xcite , the author expanded to the lowest order in @xmath0 ( @xmath0 here is equal to @xmath110 in @xcite ) after averaging over the exponential .",
    "specifically , he approximated @xmath111 this result is also consistent with a prescription of ignoring oscillating terms by taking @xmath83 for large @xmath112 , as discussed in the previous section .",
    "when we do not ignore oscillating terms , the approximation demonstrates the correct scaling on large scales but it is off by a factor .",
    "this arises because the approximation does not properly account for the oscillatory behavior of eq .   at small @xmath0 .",
    "fortunately , we can come up with a better approximation .",
    "observe that , when calculating observables , the bispectrum is usually multiplied by a function and then integrated over some of the wavenumbers ( see , e.g. , eq .   below ) .",
    "let us focus on the integral over @xmath104 .",
    "note that the limits of integration for @xmath104 are @xmath113 $ ] ; in the squeezed limit , the function multiplying the bispectrum will vary little over this small range , while the oscillatory terms like the left hand side of eq .",
    "will vary very rapidly .",
    "thus , we can perform the @xmath104 integral only over the rapidly oscillating term , e.g. , @xmath114 for this integral , we find @xmath115 + i \\operatorname{si}(-2 k \\eta_0)\\cr     & \\approx \\gamma - \\operatorname{ci}(-2 k \\eta_0)+\\log(-2 k \\eta_0)\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath116 is euler s constant , @xmath117 is the cosine integral , and @xmath118 is the sin integral ( which is @xmath119 for @xmath120 ) ; in the last line , we have dropped the second term since it becomes increasingly unimportant for large @xmath121 .",
    "if we perform this new approximation , we find that , for @xmath122 , the chief contributor to the squeezed bispectrum looks like @xmath123.\\cr\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath58 , we find @xmath124\\cr     & \\times \\frac12        [ \\gamma - \\operatorname{ci}(-2 k \\eta_0)+\\log(-2 k \\eta_0)].\\cr\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these two equations provide useful approximations to the bispectrum from a modified initial state in the squeezed configuration .    note that we can also view this approximation as finding a sort of average for the left hand side of ( [ eq : orig - approx ] ) , i.e. , that @xmath125_{avg}\\cr     & \\hspace{4em}\\equiv \\frac{1}{2k } \\int_{k_1-k}^{k_1+k } dk_2 \\frac{1-e^{i(k_1-k_2+k)\\eta_0 } } { k_1-k_2+k }        \\cr     & \\hspace{4em}\\approx \\frac{\\gamma - \\operatorname{ci}(-2 k \\eta_0)+\\log(-2 k \\eta_0)}{2k}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , ignoring the oscillating terms in the bispectrum ( as in @xcite ) is equivalent to neglecting a factor @xmath126 $ ] , so that the regime investigated in @xcite differs from the one here by a factor of order unity .",
    "how can we measure @xmath11 observationally ?",
    "obvious observables are the bispectrum of the cmb temperature and polarization anisotropy , and that of the matter density distribution in lss .",
    "these observables are ( in linear theory ) related to @xmath11 in a straightforward way @xcite .",
    "a much less obvious observable is the _ power spectrum _ of dark matter halos ( in which galaxies and clusters of galaxies would be formed ) .",
    "dark matter halos are formed only at the locations of peaks of the underlying matter distribution . while the power spectrum of the underlying matter distribution is insensitive to the bispectrum , the power spectrum of _ peaks _ is sensitive to the bispectrum as well as to higher - order correlation functions @xcite .",
    "this leads to a remarkable prediction : one can use the observed power spectrum of the distribution of galaxies ( and of clusters of galaxies ) to measure the bispectrum of primordial fluctuations @xcite .    in general , as the power spectrum of peaks ( hence halos )",
    "is different from that of the underlying matter distribution , we say that halos are biased tracers of the underlying matter distribution @xcite .",
    "the degree of bias is often parametrized by the so - called `` bias factor , '' @xmath24 , defined as @xmath127 alternatively , one may define @xmath24 as the ratio of the matter - halo cross power spectrum to the matter power spectrum .",
    "on large scales , where the matter density fluctuations are still in the linear regime , @xmath24 approaches a constant for gaussian matter density fluctuations , @xmath128 .",
    "however , the presence of the primordial bispectrum leads to a non - trivial @xmath0-dependence in @xmath24 , and this is called a `` scale - dependent bias . ''",
    "building on the previous work on the peak statistics @xcite , desjacques , jeong , and schmidt arrived at the following formula for @xmath24 @xcite : @xmath129,\\\\ \\label{eq : bias}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 is related to the mass of halos under consideration as @xmath133 , and @xmath134 is the present - day critical density of the universe .",
    "the various functions are defined by @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the linear transfer function normalized such that @xmath137 for @xmath138 , and @xmath139 is the growth factor of linear density fluctuations normalized such that @xmath140 during the matter era .",
    "( for example , @xmath141 for @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath142 . )",
    "before we show the numerical calculations , we will first try to analytically explore eq .",
    "( [ eq : bias ] ) for the case of a modified initial state , allowing us to estimate the bispectrum shape .",
    "an important observation in what follows is that @xmath143 oscillates rapidly for @xmath144 , so that the integral of @xmath145 is dominated by @xmath146 .",
    "therefore , when we are interested in @xmath147 , the integral of @xmath145 is dominated by the squeezed configuration , and is approximated as @xmath148 we can insert the squeezed configuration local bispectrum and calculate @xmath149 the second term in the parenthesis in eq .  ( [ eq : bias ] ) vanishes for this case and we find @xmath150 @xcite .    for the bispectrum for a modified initial state , which goes as @xmath151 ,",
    "we instead find @xmath152 where @xmath153 one may interpret @xmath154 as a characteristic wavenumber for the short - wavelength mode in the squeezed configuration .",
    "thus , we expect the modified - state bispectrum to produce a scale - dependent bias which grows faster ( by a factor of @xmath155 ) for small values of @xmath0 than that for the local - form bispectrum .    what about the second term in the brackets in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bias ] ) ? if we note that the extra @xmath0 factor in the integrand of eq .",
    "( [ eq : k1 ] ) ( as compared with the integrand for @xmath156 ) is evaluated at roughly @xmath157 , we get @xmath158 and @xmath159 .    on the other hand , @xmath156 is dominated by the power spectrum of matter density fluctuations at @xmath160 . approximating the power spectrum of matter density fluctuations as a power - law near @xmath161 , i.e. , @xmath162 , one obtains @xmath163/2 $ ] .",
    "for example , @xmath164 , @xmath165 , and @xmath166 for @xmath167 , 5 , and 10  @xmath168  mpc ( or @xmath169 , @xmath170 , and @xmath171 ) , respectively .    therefore , while this second term changes the amplitude of @xmath172 by a factor of @xmath173\\delta_c(b_1 - 1)}$ ] , it does not change the @xmath0-dependence of @xmath172 .",
    "we thus expect the @xmath0-dependence of the scale - dependent bias for a modified initial state to be given by @xmath174 .",
    "this scaling was also predicted by @xcite .    in principle , the second term can change the amplitude of @xmath172 by a large factor for low - mass halos whose bias is closer to unity @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , as we are focused on the shape of @xmath172 rather than on the amplitude , we will ignore this factor .",
    "then , eq .  ( [ eq : bias ] ) simplifies to @xmath175which agrees with the formula first derived by @xcite . here , @xmath176 , which is independent of @xmath177 .",
    "to evaluate eq .",
    "( [ eq : bias - formula ] ) we will use @xmath178  mpc ( corresponding to @xmath179 ) . also , in order to determine the factor @xmath180 which appears in the bispectrum , we use the wmap 5-year normalization , @xmath181 for @xmath182 @xcite , in eq .",

    "according to @xcite , double - compton scattering ( @xmath195 ) is an effective thermalization process for @xmath196 .",
    "after this epoch , however , this process shuts off and the spectral distortions from diffusion damping can not be smoothed from the cmb spectrum . since elastic compton scattering ( @xmath197 ) continues to be effective until @xmath198 , the photons can still achieve equilibrium but with a conserved photon number . the result is a bose - einstein distribution with a non - zero chemical potential , @xmath2 ( rescaled by @xmath199 to be dimensionless ) , an effect known as the `` @xmath2-type distortion '' of the black - body spectrum of the cmb , and it affects the distribution by @xmath200 a positive @xmath2 reduces the number of photons at low frequencies . finally , after @xmath201 , even elastic compton scattering is inefficient and photons fall out of kinetic equilibrium with electrons , leaving only the so - called `` @xmath202-type distortion '' .",

    "<S> we investigate the phenomenological consequences of a modification of the initial state of quantum fluctuations of a single inflationary field . while single - field inflation with the standard bunch - davies initial vacuum state does not generally produce a measurable three - point function ( bispectrum ) in the so - called squeezed triangle configuration ( where one wavenumber , @xmath0 , is much smaller than the other two , @xmath1 ) , allowing for a non - standard initial state produces an exception . here </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate the signature of an initial state modification in single - field slow - roll inflation as it would appear in both the scale - dependent bias of the large - scale structure ( lss ) and @xmath2-type distortion in the black - body spectrum of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) . </S>",
    "<S> we parametrize the initial state modifications and identify certain choices of parameters as natural , though we also note some fine - tuned choices that can yield a larger bispectrum . in both cases , </S>",
    "<S> we observe a distinctive @xmath3 signature in lss ( as opposed to the @xmath4 of the so - called local - form bispectrum ) . as a non - zero bispectrum in the squeezed configuration correlates one long - wavelength mode with two short - wavelength modes , it induces a correlation between the cmb temperature anisotropy observed on large scales with the temperature - anisotropy - squared on very small scales ; this correlation persists as the small - scale anisotropy - squared is processed into the @xmath2-type distortion of the black - body spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> while the correlation induced by the local - form bispectrum turns out to be too small to detect in near future , a modified initial vacuum state enhances the signal by a large factor owing to an extra factor of @xmath5 compared to the local form . </S>",
    "<S> for example , a proposed absolutely - calibrated experiment , pixie , is expected to detect this correlation with a signal - to - noise ratio greater than 10 , for an occupation number of about @xmath6 in the observable modes . </S>",
    "<S> relatively - calibrated experiments such as planck and litebird should also be able to measure this effect , provided that the relative calibration between different frequencies meets the required precision . </S>",
    "<S> our study suggests that the cmb anisotropy , the distortion of the cmb black - body spectrum , and the large - scale structure of the universe offer new ways to probe the initial state of quantum fluctuations . </S>"
