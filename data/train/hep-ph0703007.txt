    "there are five categories of fundamental particles that we have known today : ( a ) charged leptons @xmath6 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 ; ( b ) neutrinos @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 ; ( c ) up - type quarks @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 ; ( d ) down - type quarks @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 ; ( e ) gauge bosons @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the particles belonging to category ( e ) are the carriers of electromagnetic ( @xmath16 ) , weak ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) and strong ( @xmath19 ) forces , respectively . in comparison , the particles belonging to categories ( a )  ( d ) are the building blocks of the world of matter .",
    "but we have no idea about what constitutes the cold dark matter of the universe .",
    "the afore - mentioned fermions have three families : the first family includes @xmath10 , @xmath13 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 ; the second family contains @xmath11 , @xmath14 , @xmath0 and @xmath8 ; and the third family is composed of @xmath12 , @xmath15 , @xmath1 and @xmath9 .",

    "in other words ,  who ordered that ? \" ) , a sister of the electron , was discovered from cosmic rays in 1936 . ]",
    "although the definite answer to this fundamental question has been lacking , some people have speculated the possibility that there might exist certain hidden flavor quantum numbers or flavor symmetries which distinguish one family from another .",
    "the mysterious koide relation for the pole masses of three charged leptons can be taken as a good example to illustrate the puzzles of flavors @xcite : @xmath20 given the experimental values @xcite @xmath21 eq .",
    "( 1 ) holds up to the accuracy of @xmath22 ; i.e. , @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "this precision is so amazing that i can not help to ask what the underlying physics is behind the koide relation .",
    "as pointed out by koide himself in this workshop @xcite , eq .",
    "( 1 ) might naturally stem from a kind of flavor symmetry , such as the discrete s(3 ) symmetry .",
    "i stress that one has to distinguish between the concepts of running and pole masses of fermions when building models at certain energy scales , where certain flavor symmetries exactly exist .",
    "needless to say , flavor symmetries may serve as a promising guiding principle for model building and their spontaneous or explicit breaking schemes may help understand the observed mass spectra and flavor mixing patterns of leptons and quarks @xcite . here",
    "let me focus on neutrino mixing , which is described by the @xmath24 maki - nakagawa - sakata ( mns ) matrix @xcite at low energy scales .",
    "in september 1996 , fritzsch and i proposed the so - called  democratic \" neutrino mixing pattern by starting from the @xmath25 symmetry of the charged - lepton mass matrix and the s(3 ) symmetry of the neutrino mass matrix @xcite : @xmath26 a few years later , harrison , perkins and scott @xcite advocated the so - called  tri - bimaximal \" neutrino mixing pattern , @xmath27 which can be derived from certain discrete flavor symmetries ( such as the non - abelian @xmath28 symmetry @xcite ) . in comparison with @xmath29 , @xmath30 is much more compatible with today s solar @xcite , atmospheric @xcite , reactor @xcite and accelerator @xcite neutrino oscillation data . and",
    "@xmath30 have been analyzed by luo , mei and me @xcite from a superhigh energy scale to the electroweak scale . ] in particular , the large - mixing - angle mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) solution @xcite to the solar neutrino problem can simply be accommodated and the very special values of two mixing angles @xmath31 and @xmath32 are closely related to the @xmath0-@xmath1 permutation symmetry .",
    "in the limit of @xmath0-@xmath1 permutation symmetry , the ( effective ) majorana neutrino mass matrix @xmath33 takes the form @xmath34 here and hereafter we work in the basis where the flavor eigenstates of charged leptons are identified with their mass eigenstates .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath33 is invariant under the @xmath0-@xmath1 permutation , which is equivalent to the transformation @xmath35 with @xmath36 after a straightforward diagonalization of @xmath33 , one may obtain @xmath31 and @xmath32 for the mns matrix @xmath37 .",
    "the solar neutrino mixing angle @xmath38 is not fixed , nevertheless .",
    "the breaking of @xmath0-@xmath1 symmetry will in general lead to @xmath39 , @xmath40 and a non - trivial cp - violating phase @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "if the @xmath0-@xmath1 symmetry is softly broken , however , @xmath31 or @xmath32 might survive .",
    "for instance , it is possible to break the @xmath0-@xmath1 symmetry in a proper way such that the resultant mns matrix takes one of the following two forms @xcite : @xmath42 from which @xmath39 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 can be predicted .",
    "here @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are defined .",
    "the angle @xmath49 depends closely on the parameters of @xmath0-@xmath1 symmetry breaking .",
    "an example for the soft @xmath0-@xmath1 symmetry breaking will be given in section 5 of my talk .",
    "a generic parametrization of the @xmath24 majorana neutrino mixing matrix needs three mixing angles ( @xmath38 , @xmath50 , @xmath4 ) and three cp - violating phases ( @xmath41 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 ) @xcite : @xmath53 one usually refers to @xmath41 as the  dirac \" phase , because it is also present in the @xmath24 dirac neutrino mixing matrix . in comparison ,",
    "@xmath51 and @xmath52 are commonly referred to as the  majorana \" phases , which do not manifest themselves in neutrino oscillations and can be rotated away if neutrinos are dirac particles . a complex @xmath0-@xmath1 symmetry breaking scheme is possible to generate both non - trivial @xmath41 and non - trivial @xmath51 and @xmath52 in a given neutrino mass model .",
    "this talk will focus on a new kind of flavor symmetry , the so - called friedberg - lee ( fl ) symmetry @xcite , to discuss the neutrino mass matrix and neutrino mixing .",
    "one will see that the well - known @xmath0-@xmath1 symmetry can also manifest itself in the neutrino mass operator with the fl symmetry .",
    "the effective neutrino mass operator proposed recently by friedberg and lee @xcite is of the form @xmath54 where @xmath55 , @xmath15 , @xmath11 and @xmath56 are all assumed to be real .",
    "a salient feature of @xmath57 is its partial translational symmetry ; i.e. , its @xmath55 , @xmath15 and @xmath11 terms are invariant under the transformation @xmath58 ( for @xmath59 ) with @xmath60 being a space - time independent constant element of the grassmann algebra .",

    "this interesting result leads us to the following observations @xcite :    \\(1 ) if @xmath67 holds , @xmath68 will reproduce the exact tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing pattern @xcite .",

    "non - vanishing but small @xmath49 predicts @xmath69 , implying @xmath70 for @xmath3 . on the other hand , @xmath50 will mildly deviate from its best - fit value @xmath32 if @xmath49 ( or @xmath4 ) takes non - zero values .",
    "\\(2 ) the limit @xmath71 results from @xmath72 .",
    "when @xmath73 holds , it is straightforward to see that the neutrino mass operator @xmath57 has the exact @xmath0-@xmath1 symmetry ( i.e. , @xmath57 is invariant under the interchange of @xmath0 and @xmath1 indices ) . in other words ,",
    "the tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing is a natural consequence of the @xmath0-@xmath1 symmetry of @xmath33 in the fl model .",
    "then @xmath39 and @xmath40 measure the strength of @xmath0-@xmath1 symmetry breaking , as many authors have discussed in other neutrino mass models .",
    "note that @xmath57 is only valid for dirac neutrinos .",
    "recently zhang , zhou and i have generalized @xmath74 to describe majorana neutrinos @xcite .",
    "in particular , we allow @xmath55 , @xmath15 , @xmath11 and @xmath56 to be complex so as to accommodate leptonic cp violation .",
    "two special scenarios have been discussed in detail . in scenario ( a )",
    ", we require that @xmath55 and @xmath56 be real and @xmath75 be complex .",
    "we find that the @xmath0-@xmath1 symmetry of @xmath33 is softly broken in this case , leading to the elegant predictions @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath44 .",
    "two majorana cp - violating phases @xmath51 and @xmath52 keep vanishing . in scenario ( b ) , we assume that @xmath55 , @xmath15 and @xmath11 are real but @xmath56 is complex .",

    "the dirac cp - violating phase @xmath41 remains vanishing .    to see the point of the fl symmetry more clearly ,",
    "let me switch off the term proportional to @xmath56 and then rewrite @xmath74 for majorana neutrinos : @xmath79 + { \\rm h.c . } \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath55 , @xmath15 and @xmath11 are in general complex , and @xmath80 ( for @xmath81 , @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) .",

    "( 9 ) the fl symmetry is broken by @xmath89 , hence all the three neutrinos are massive .",
    "one may wonder whether it is possible to break the fl symmetry but keep @xmath90 or @xmath91 unchanged .",
    "the answer to this question is actually affirmative , as one will see in the subsequent section .",
    "is it really possible to break the fl symmetry in @xmath92 but keep @xmath90 or @xmath91 unchanged ?",
    "luo and i @xcite have found that the simplest way to make this possibility realizable is to transform one of the neutrino fields @xmath93 into @xmath94 with @xmath95 .",
    "given @xmath96 as an example , the resultant majorana neutrino mass operator reads @xmath97 + { \\rm h.c . } \\ ; . \\ ] ] accordingly , the neutrino mass matrix is given by @xmath98 we are then left with @xmath99 , which is independent of the magnitude and phase of @xmath100 .",
    "thus we obtain either @xmath90 or @xmath101 from @xmath102 .",
    "the effect of @xmath103 is referred to as the  oblique \" symmetry breaking , because it breaks the fl symmetry but keeps the lightest neutrino to be massless .",
    "my next step is to show that a generic bi - large neutrino mixing pattern can be derived from @xmath102 .",

    "one can see that @xmath115 , which is a clear reflection of the @xmath0-@xmath1 permutation symmetry in @xmath116 or @xmath102 , leads to @xmath67 or equivalently @xmath32 and @xmath117 .",

    "can easily be tested in the near future .",

    "( 18 ) allows us to achieve @xmath125 by using the @xmath126 confidence - level ranges of @xmath38 and @xmath50 ( i.e. , @xmath127 and @xmath128 ) @xcite , we obtain @xmath129 from eq .",
    "( 19 ) and @xmath130 from eq .",

    "a careful analysis shows that neither @xmath133 nor @xmath134 with @xmath95 , which automatically breaks the @xmath0-@xmath1 permutation symmetry , is favored to reproduce the exactly or approximately tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing pattern .",
    "although the above discussions are based on the assumption of real @xmath55 , @xmath15 and @xmath11 , they can easily be extended to the case of complex @xmath55 , @xmath15 and @xmath11 in order to accommodate cp violation .",
    "for simplicity of illustration , here we assume that @xmath55 remains real but @xmath75 is complex .",
    "we may then simplify the expression of @xmath112 by taking into account @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",

    "two immediate but important observations are in order :    \\(1 ) in this simple scenario @xmath37 contains two nontrivial cp - violating phases : @xmath139 ( when @xmath140 ) or @xmath141 ( when @xmath142 ) and @xmath143 . both of them are attributed to the purely imaginary term @xmath144 .",

    "\\(2 ) @xmath149 or @xmath32 can be achieved , although the effective majorana neutrino mass operator @xmath150 does not possess the exact @xmath0-@xmath1 permutation symmetry .",
    "the reason is simply that @xmath151 holds in our scenario . in other words ,",
    "the phase difference between @xmath15 and @xmath11 signifies a kind of soft @xmath0-@xmath1 symmetry breaking which can keep @xmath32 but cause @xmath39 .",
    "finally i like to point out that it is possible to derive the majorana neutrino mass operator @xmath150 from the minimal seesaw model ( msm ) @xcite , a canonical extension of the standard model with only two heavy right - handed majorana neutrinos . the neutrino mass term in the msm",
    "can be written as @xmath152 where @xmath153 and @xmath154 denote the column vectors of @xmath155 and @xmath156 fields , respectively .",
    "provided the mass scale of @xmath157 is considerably higher than that of @xmath158 , one may obtain the effective ( left - handed ) majorana neutrino mass matrix @xmath102 from eq . ( 22 ) via the well - known seesaw mechanism @xcite : @xmath159 .",
    "as @xmath157 is of rank 2 , @xmath160 holds and @xmath90 ( or @xmath101 ) is guaranteed .",
    "we find that the expression of @xmath102 given in eq .",
    "( 16 ) can be reproduced from @xmath158 and @xmath157 if they take the following forms : @xmath161 where @xmath162 characterizes the mass scale of @xmath158 .",
    "such textures are by no means unique , but they may serve as a good example to illustrate how the seesaw mechanism works to give rise to @xmath102 or @xmath116 in the msm .",
    "i have argued that the observed flavor structures of leptons and quarks might imply the existence of certain flavor symmetries .",
    "a flavor symmetry itself is far away from a flavor theory , but it might be taken as a reasonable starting point to build a realistic flavor model towards deeper understanding of the fermion mass spectra and flavor mixing patterns . the @xmath0-@xmath1 permutation symmetry has been taken as an example to interpret the almost maximal atmospheric neutrino mixing angle ( @xmath163 ) and the strongly suppressed chooz neutrino mixing angle ( @xmath132 ) .",
    "the effect of @xmath0-@xmath1 symmetry breaking could even show up in the ultrahigh - energy neutrino telescopes @xcite .",
    "let us anticipate that icecube @xcite and other second - generation neutrino telescopes @xcite are able to detect the fluxes of ultrahigh - energy ( uhe ) @xmath7 ( @xmath164 ) , @xmath8 ( @xmath165 ) and @xmath9 ( @xmath166 ) neutrinos generated from very distant astrophysical sources .",
    "for most of the currently - envisaged sources of uhe neutrinos @xcite , a general and canonical expectation is that the initial neutrino fluxes are produced via the decay of pions created from @xmath167 or @xmath168 collisions and their flavor content can be expressed as @xmath169 where @xmath170 ( for @xmath59 ) denotes the sum of @xmath93 and @xmath171 fluxes , and @xmath172 is the total flux of neutrinos and antineutrinos of all flavors . due to neutrino oscillations ,",
    "the flavor composition of such cosmic neutrino fluxes to be measured at the detector of a neutrino telescope has been expected to be @xcite @xmath173 however , it is worth remarking that this naive expectation is only true in the limit of @xmath0-@xmath1 symmetry ( or equivalently , @xmath174 and @xmath175 ) . starting from the hypothesis given in eq .",
    "( 24 ) and allowing for the slight breaking of @xmath0-@xmath1 symmetry , i have shown that @xcite @xmath176 holds to an excellent degree of accuracy , where @xmath177 with @xmath178 characterizes the effect of @xmath0-@xmath1 symmetry breaking ( i.e. , the combined effect of @xmath179 and @xmath180 ) .",
    "i obtain @xmath181 from the present neutrino oscillation data @xcite .",
    "it would be fantastic if @xmath182 could finally be measured at a @xmath183-scale neutrino telescope in the future .",
    "the main body of this talk is actually to highlight the fl symmetry and its oblique breaking scheme .",
    "i have emphasized that the fl symmetry is a new kind of flavor symmetry applicable to the building of neutrino mass models . imposing this symmetry on the effective majorana neutrino mass operator , luo and",
    "i have shown that it can be broken in such a novel way that the lightest neutrino remains massless but an experimentally - favored bi - large neutrino mixing pattern is achievable .",
    "this phenomenological scenario predicts a testable relationship between the unknown neutrino mixing angle @xmath4 and the known angles @xmath38 and @xmath50 in the cp - conserving case : @xmath184 .",
    "such a result is suggestive and interesting because it directly correlates the deviation of @xmath4 from zero with the deviation of @xmath50 from @xmath185 .",
    "we have discussed a simple but instructive possibility of introducing cp violation into the majorana neutrino mass operator , in which the soft breaking of @xmath0-@xmath1 symmetry yields @xmath186 ( or @xmath187 ) but keeps @xmath188 .",
    "we have also discussed the possibility of incorporating our scenario in the msm .    in conclusion",
    ", the fl symmetry and its breaking mechanism may have a wealth of implications in neutrino phenomenology .",
    "the physics behind this new flavor symmetry remains unclear and deserves a further study .",
