    "the predominance of spin singlet superconductors over their triplet counterparts has , in part , lead to the belief that superconductivity and magnetism are mutually exclusive  the upper critical field of a singlet superconductor is bounded by the pauli paramagnetic limit .",
    "one might expect that a ferromagnet would be the natural stage for spin triplet superconductivity , where we could overcome pauli limiting effects .",
    "but , until recently , there were no examples of ` ferromagnetic superconductivity ' ( fmsc)the coexistence of itinerant ferromagnetism ( fm ) and superconductivity ( sc ) in a single bulk phase  @xcite .",
    "this situation has changed with the observation of fmsc in uge@xmath0  @xcite , urhge  @xcite and zrzn@xmath0  @xcite .",

    "be it electron / hole density  @xcite or external pressure  @xcite physicists are now able to access regimes where magnetic fluctuations become quantum critical .",
    "we choose here to concentrate on the case of uge@xmath0 , because whilst sc is only measurable in the ferromagnetic state ( in common with urhge and zrzn@xmath0 ) , uge@xmath0 seems to posess particularly low electronic dimensionality , uniaxial magnetisation , and revealing features in the temperature - pressure phase diagram which we now review .",

    "this @xmath3 shows up in measurements of lattice expansion  @xcite , as a jump in the low temperature @xmath9 component of the resistivity  @xcite , as a small enhancement in specific heat  @xcite , as a kink in resistivity  @xcite and as a change in the character of the fermi surface as measured in de haas van alphen experiments  @xcite .",
    "most importantly for this work , @xmath3 also appears as a slight jump in magnetisation  @xcite which is sharpened at lower temperatures such that the low temperature moment has a step at pressure @xmath5 in addition to the step at the quantum phase transition pressure , @xmath10 ( see fig .",
    "[ uge2phasefig ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we note the close proximity of the @xmath11 line to the peak in @xmath1 .",
    "most theories which describe ferromagnets close to a quantum phase transition have predicted that the superconducting transition temperature , @xmath1 should be at least as high in the paramagnetic state as it is in the ferromagnetic state .",
    "these theories have considered a electronically three - dimensional ferromagnet , either magnetically isotropic  @xcite or uniaxial  @xcite . where theoretical models have predicted an enhancement of @xmath1 in the ferromagnetic regime , their basis seems unjustified in the case of uge@xmath0 .",
    "kirkpatrick and coworkers  @xcite have predicted an enhancement of the superconducting @xmath1 due to the coupling of magnons to the longitudinal magnetic susceptibility .",
    "however , the ferromagnetic state of uge@xmath0 is so magnetically anisotropic that the presence of transverse magnons seems an unlikely primary explanation for the enhancement of @xmath1at 4.2k and an external magnetic field of 4 t , the magnetisation along the easy axis is about 20 to 30 times that along either of the other crystallographic axes  @xcite .",
    "other authors have drawn their inspiration from bandstructure calculations .",
    "bandstructure analyses  @xcite of uge@xmath0 seem to indicate that lowering temperature sparks the evolution of a quasi - two - dimensional majority carrier fermi surface sheet below @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore there is the possibility that large sections of the quasi - two - dimensional fermi surface may be parallel , making it almost one - dimensional . until now",
    ", this low - dimensional magnetism has pushed authors in the direction of postulating the existence of a charge- or spin - density - wave state ( cdw or sdw ) below @xmath6  @xcite , sometimes by analogy with the @xmath12 phase of uranium .",
    "watanabe and miyake  @xcite have postulated that the interplay of cd or sd fluctuations at high wavevector will couple to the magnetisation , @xmath4 in such a way as to enhance it at some critical value , @xmath13 mode , watanabe and miyake s model is reminiscent of the spin - bag mechanism of nodeless superconductivity proposed by schrieffer et al . in the context of the cuprates  @xcite . ] .",
    "however , spin density fluctuations have yet to be observed in neutron experiments on uge@xmath0 .",
    "we turn to the low dimensional bandstructure for a different effect . the key idea will be that in a ferromagnet , somewhat uniquely , the magnetisation acts as a tuning parameter which can subtly change the topology of the _ anisotropic _ fermi surfaces of different spin species .",
    "by contrast , in a rigid band picture of a paramagnetic metal , the fermi surface is fixed .",
    "the added topological possibilities for a ferromagnet should be viewed as a useful tool  and as a reason for observing the enhancement of features , such as @xmath1 , within the ferromagnetic phase .",
    "this paper is planned as follows : firstly , we show that an electronic density of states ( dos ) which has two peaks can reproduce the two steps in the observed low temperature magnetisation .",
    "we then show that the necessary form of dos arises naturally from a low ( quasi - one- ) dimensional bandstructure and that the magnetisation resulting from this bandstructure has a jump in the ferromagnetic state which is coincident with the maximum in a superconducting instability , mediated by spin fluctuations .",
    "the simplest stoner theory of magnetism is long - known to be inadequate in describing the temperature dependence of the magnetisation even of magnetically isotropic , electronically 3-dimensional ferromagnets , where spin fluctuations have to be taken into account .",
    "there , a fluctuation - averaged equation of state method , in the spirit of lonzarich and taillefer  @xcite or yamada  @xcite would be a improved model of magnetism at finite temperature , where we expect the temperature dependence of @xmath4 to arise from the fluctuation response , rather than just the fermi functions included in stoner theory .",
    "the pronounced magnetic anisotropy of uge@xmath0 might ordinarily simplify matters , as the consequent absence of transverse spin modes will make a stoner approach more valid , especially at low temperatures .",
    "however the reduced electronic dimensionality of uge@xmath0 will probably heighten the importance of spin fluctuations at finite temperatures .",
    "we therefore circumvent finite temperature concerns by employing a _ zero _ temperature stoner theory , with the first aim being to reproduce the step in @xmath14 at @xmath15 .",
    "we consider the action of pressure to be akin to that of varying the exchange energy , @xmath16 in a stoner model of the one - electron energy of separated majority ( say , @xmath17 ) and minority ( say , @xmath18 ) spin sheets : @xmath19 in this description , the occupation of each spin sheet @xmath20 is @xmath21 , where @xmath22 . here",
    "@xmath23 is the bottom of the band , and spin @xmath20 occupies energy states up to @xmath24 .",
    "the dos is given by @xmath25 .",
    "we consider the total number of spins , @xmath26 to be fixed .",
    "the chemical potential , @xmath24 of each spin sheet is therefore completely determined by the particular magnetisation and chosen electron number .",

    "most phenomenological expansions of this energy density have included terms even in @xmath4 , up to order @xmath29 .",
    "this can give one first order transition in @xmath30 .",
    "however , we are looking for an additional transition , corresponding to @xmath15 , and believed to be first order  @xcite , although there is some controversy over this  @xcite . to have the possibility of an additional _ first _ order transition",
    ", we need the next even term in the landau free energy expansion , thus obtaining an @xmath31 theory  @xcite .",
    "we now show that a dos with two peaks generically brings about the @xmath32 term in @xmath33 $ ] by allowing a scenario where the global magnetisation can change rapidly , twice .",
    "we begin by taking a one - band dos comprised of two lorenztians , normalised such that the maximum number of electrons of each spin in the band is 1 :    @xmath34    where @xmath35 where we can vary @xmath36 to adjust the sharpness of the two humps and @xmath37 to adjust their position .",

    "we plot both the normalised density of states and the resultant @xmath30 curve .",
    "if the two peaks in the dos are too far apart , a saturated magnetic state is favoured .",
    "if the two peaks are too smooth , the transitions in @xmath30 are weakened .",
    "the bandstructure parameters used in each case are indicated , together with the range of number of spins , @xmath43 , used in the calculations of @xmath30 . ]    for each set of parameters , we show the effect of varying the paramagnetic fermi level , that is to say , the number of spins , @xmath43 in the system , in the neighbourhood of half - filling .",
    "this places the paramagnetic fermi level , @xmath44 between the two dos peaks . on increasing the exchange term , @xmath16 ,",
    "the spin sea is polarised and the majority fermi level moves up from that of the paramagnetic state and the minority level moves down .",
    "the onset of ferromagnetism is governed by the usual stoner criterion , @xmath45 in the case of a second order onset , or by the finite - magnetisation stoner criterion @xcite for a first order onset : @xmath46 the finite magnetisation criterion holds for all @xmath4 once the system is polarised , irrespective of the order of the onset .",
    "each fermi level feels the effect of the density of states peaks at different @xmath16 , as long as the paramagnetic fermi level is off - centre with respect to the two dos peaks .",
    "the main result is that , by making the density of states peaks sufficiently sharp and close together , _ we can obtain two magnetic transitions , one from the paramagnetic state and another within the ferromagnetic state . _",
    "if the dos peaks are too far apart , a saturated magnetic state is favoured ; if the peaks are too smooth , the transitions in @xmath30 are weakened and if the starting paramagnetic level is too close to the half - way point between the two peaks ( @xmath43 too close to 1 ) then only one transition is observed .",
    "therefore , to observe two transitions , the paramagnetic filling level should be between the dos peaks , but off - centre with respect to them .",
    "having shown that a double - humped dos is perhaps key to understanding the magnetic properties of uge@xmath0 at low temperatures , we now set about working towards a tight - binding picture of the bandstructure of this compound which can reproduce both its magnetic and superconducting properties .",
    "there have been two major efforts towards bandstructure calculations of uge@xmath0 .",
    "the first , originally on a crystal structure with an incorrect space group was performed by yamagami et al .",
    "@xcite and has since been revised  @xcite .",
    "this produced spin - separated fermi sheets in the ferromagnetic state , centred on the @xmath47 point , with the majority sheet strongly nested .",
    "the second approach , already mentioned , has been an lda @xmath48 method , by shick and pickett  @xcite , using @xmath49 as a fitting parameter for the zero temperature , ambient pressure magnetisation .",
    "again , strongly nested fermi sheets were obtained , but they were of mixed spin type and the sheet considered by those authors as being most important for superconductivity is centred on the crystallographic @xmath4 point in their model .",
    "furthermore , there was initial disagreement on the direction of the nesting vector @xmath50 relative to the easy axis of magnetisation @xmath51  both are ` in - plane ' , but yamagami considered @xmath52 whilst shick found @xmath53 . in summary , we take the following minimal , but key ingredients in our model :    * quasi - one - dimensional bandstructure ( crucial to what follows ) * strong uniaxial magnetic anisotropy and * spin - split fermi sheets ( even in the lda @xmath48 work  @xcite , there is a large exchange splitting , of the order of 1 @xmath54 ) .    in our model , we utilise the interaction potential for spin fluctuation mediated pairing in the ferromagnetic state , as derived by fay and appel  @xcite .",
    "we also follow their sign convention , namely that an attractive potential between like spins is positive .",
    "the interaction potential is heavily dependent on the lindhard response , @xmath55 for the bandstructure under consideration : @xmath56 where @xmath16 is again the repulsive hubbard - type contact interaction acting between opposite spins and @xmath55 is given by @xmath57 @xmath58 being the fermi occupation function for spin @xmath20 which is at chemical potential @xmath24 ( @xmath24 is defined previously ) . according to our chosen interaction mechanism , eq .",
    "[ fayappelv ] , a large @xmath55 might naively be expected to lead to an enhanced @xmath1 .",
    "however , the subtlety here is that the interaction potential in the ferromagnetic state mixes longitudinal susceptibilities of majority and minority spin sheets so the effect is not so clear - cut .",
    "we recall that in the free electron model , only in electronic dimensions less than two , there can be a peak in @xmath55 at non - zero @xmath59  @xcite . in that case",
    ", we might expect that when one sheet of the fermi surface is at optimal nesting , then perhaps @xmath60 will be highest .",
    "the problem with this argument is that a @xmath61 dominated by high-@xmath50 modes would normally lead to very weak triplet pairing and in tight - binding approaches , finite @xmath59 peaks in @xmath55 are possible in two and three dimensions .",
    "the approach we take is to look for density of states - driven superconductivity , where the large density of states giving rise to the magnetisation step at @xmath62 is also able to enhance superconductivity in the ferromagnetic state . in tight - binding theory in two dimensions and lower ,",
    "the peak in the density of states comes from the presence of a van hove singularity .",
    "the simplest , familiar tight - binding bandstructure for the cuprates is of the form @xmath63 with @xmath64 and @xmath65 less than 1 .",
    "this corresponds to equal nearest neighbour hopping in each of the two dimensions , and includes the next - nearest neighbour term , @xmath66 .",
    "this structure , as shown in figure [ vannestingfig](a ) , has one van hove singularity and is therefore of little use in studying the magnetic properties of uge@xmath0as we have already found , we require _ two _ density of states peaks .",
    "however , as we will now show , if we now reduce the amplitude of the @xmath67 term , we cross over into quasi - one - dimensions and begin to lift the degeneracy of the van hove contours , giving two of the them , with adjustable separation .     with @xmath64 and @xmath68 is shown .",
    "this is a structure most often studied in connection with the cuprates . in ( b )",
    "we show the quasi - one - dimensional structure of eq .",
    "[ org1d ] with @xmath69 . in ( c ) , higher harmonics in the principal direction are included ( eq . [ ugmyband ] ) with @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "we see that in ( a ) there is one ( degenerate ) van hove contour , but on going into quasi - one - dimensions , we lift this degeneracy and find two van hove contours and hence two maxima in the density of states .",
    "furthermore , the choice of bandstructure in ( c ) has an optimal nesting scenario ( shown in blue ) which is separate from both of the van hove contours , due to the elimination of the @xmath74 term in the bandstructure . ]",
    "the most common quasi-1d bandstructure in the literature is probably @xmath75 which is used to describe some organic superconductors . here",
    ", @xmath76 is 1 and @xmath77 is less than 1 and the model corresponds to nearest neighbour hopping in each of the two dimensions .",
    "this bandstructure has two van hove contours ( see figure [ vannestingfig](b ) and hence two density of states peaks .",
    "thus , on tuning our magnetisation , we can observe in both spin types the transition through a van hove singularity in the density of states at the fermi level , provided , as stated before , that our paramagnetic fermi level is between the two peaks in the density of states .",
    "the problem arises that when the peaks are close enough together to cause an effect in the magnetisation curves , the variation of the dos in between them is not very rapid .",
    "this leads to a weakening of the transitions in @xmath30 as found with a slowly varying lorentzian dos in the last section .",
    "however , if we assume a quasi - one - dimensional dispersion of the form    @xmath78    with @xmath70 and @xmath65,@xmath79 , and @xmath80 all less than unit magnitude , _ we will be able to explore the possibility of two , first order jumps in @xmath30_.    the higher harmonics in the principal direction @xmath81 and the next - nearest term , @xmath66 which appear in eq .",
    "[ ugmyband ] are not unreasonable in a system which we know to be strongly one - dimensional in character .",
    "the nearest neighbour term in @xmath82 has been reduced to zero . as shown in figure [ vannestingfig](c ) , this dispersion relation yields two van hove contours ( and hence maxima in electronic density of states ) , and also goes through a perfect nesting scenario.(c ) .",
    "by contrast , the optimal nesting fermi surface of a two - dimensional square lattice in a nearest - neighbour tight - binding model is a diamond shape , with parallel surfaces at 45 degrees to the brillouin zone axes . as shown in figure [ vannestingfig](a ) , this fermi surface also corresponds to the van hove point and density of states maximum .",
    "] we note that our choice of bandstructure is based on an extrapolation from the one point ( @xmath83 , @xmath84 ) of the phase diagram calculated in refs .",
    "@xcite , with the idea being that there should be strong nesting present at full magnetisation in our model , to match the bandstructure calculations",
    ". indeed , the high energy contours of this dispersion are fairly well nested ( figure [ vannestingfig](c ) ) . to achieve a magnetically saturated state which does not completely fill the band , we require less than half - filling of the band in the paramagnetic state , a requirement which is in line with the demands of the @xmath30 profile from section [ model ] . our choice of bandstructure will ultimately help to link @xmath5 , the maximum in @xmath1 and the mass enhancement observed in de haas van alphen measurements .",

    ", the paramagnetic fermi level sits in between the two peaks in the dos .",
    "initial polarisation at @xmath88 ( labelled by analogy with @xmath10 in experiment ) is first order  this is due to the minority sheet approaching the lower van hove peak as polarisation commences .    , where both the possibility of tuning the magnetisation through a van hove singularity and a perfect nesting condition are present .",

    "the tight - binding parameters for our dispersion , @xmath89 are indicated . as in fig .",
    "[ combilorfig ] , two magnetic transitions are often visible . ]    there are several features to be noted from the plots in fig .",
    "[ uge2mybandfig ] .",
    "firstly , as in fig .",
    "[ combilorfig ] , if @xmath43 is below half - filling , a second magnetic transition can occur when the majority spin sheet feels the effect of the upper peak in the dos .",
    "however , when n is too close to half filling , or when the dip between the two density of states peaks is too sharp , we get only one first order transition , which can even be straight to saturation magnetisation . once again , in order to observe the _ two _ transitions seen in uge@xmath0 , one should have a paramagnetic fermi level which is off - centre with respect to two dos peaks .",
    "secondly , the upper transition ( which we henceforth label @xmath90 by analogy with @xmath15 from experiment ) , can either be to finite magnetisation ( and either first order or beyond the first order critical point ) or can be first order to saturation magnetisation . according to eq .",
    "[ fayappelv ] , a transition to saturation magnetisation would naturally kill any magnetically - mediated superconductivity due to the lack of one spin species .",
    "thus we turn our attention to an upper transition not of saturating nature , and which could be first order , or close to first order , as the latter would allow the fermi surface sheet configurations to be explored as the magnetisation is tuned by temperature or pressure , allowing the presence of sharp peaks in the density of states to be observed in measurements such as heat capacity and resistivity .",
    "the above considerations make the second example in fig .",
    "[ uge2mybandfig ] a most useful candidate , as we have the option of the upper transition being first order or close to first order , depending on @xmath43 , and the magnetisation does not saturate at the upper transition . henceforth , we take @xmath71 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "interestingly , the magnetic phase diagram in the @xmath93 plane seems to contain a line of first order transitions corresponding to @xmath94 .",
    "this line terminates at a critical point at a value of @xmath43 of about 0.76 . for values of @xmath43 below this ,",
    "the transition in @xmath30 is smooth and can be described as close to first order .",
    "this is perhaps best seen in figure [ combisuscfig](a ) , where we show the longitudinal susceptibility , @xmath95 as a function of @xmath16 for @xmath71 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 , taking different values of @xmath43 .",
    "we take the longitudinal susceptibility from the stoner forms :    @xmath96    in the paramagnetic ( fermi level @xmath44 ) and ferromagnetic states , respectively .",
    "as seen in figure [ combisuscfig](a ) , the susceptibility at @xmath97 grows as we move closer to the critical point ; the resulting ( approximate ) phase diagram in @xmath98 space is shown in figure [ combisuscfig](b ) .",

    "the transitions at the curie onset , @xmath99 are also first order . this can be seen in the behaviour of ( a ) the longitudinal susceptibility and ( b ) the resulting ( approximate ) phase diagram .",
    "the tight - binding parameters used here are @xmath71 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 , in line with what follows . ]",
    "it has also been found that the features associated with @xmath6 and @xmath100 can be recovered at pressures above @xmath15 and @xmath10 respectively by the application of a magnetic field . in our model , this metamagnetism arises as a direct consequence of having spin - split fermi surfaces , with the spin species being governed by number conservation and the free energy of the form given in eq .",
    "[ freeenergy ] . as shown in fig .",
    "[ magfieldeffectfig ] , turning on the magnetic field , @xmath28 , pushes both the magnetisation jump at @xmath88 ( the curie transition ) and at @xmath97 ( within the ferromagnetic state ) to lower values of @xmath16 , or equivalently , higher pressures .",

    "a reasonable estimate of the strength of triplet pairing can be gained from examining the relative magnitudes of the mass renormalisation parameter @xmath103 and interaction parameter @xmath104 , defined as    @xmath105    where each integration is over the fermi surface ( @xmath106 ) either in @xmath107 or @xmath108 space .",

    "the sharpness of the van hove singularities is useful in providing the magnetisation behaviour shown in section [ jumps ] .",

    "this procedure maintains the order of the magnetic transition at @xmath90 , although it does mean that the effective density of states , @xmath118 is inconsistent with that used to find @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath116 is calculated on a @xmath119 by @xmath119 grid for @xmath107 and @xmath108 points in the brillouin zone .",
    "the agreement is close away from the van hove regions .    in order to have two first order magnetic phase transitions ( see fig .",
    "[ combisuscfig](b ) ) , we take @xmath120 in what follows , and examine majority sheet , spin triplet superconductivity . the final refinement to the model",
    "comes in the form of adjusting the @xmath59-dependence of @xmath16 at this stage . until now , we have considered a @xmath59-independent stoner factor which arises from on - site repulsion of like - spin electrons . however , @xmath16 should really convey some of the physics of electron - electron interactions at finite distances , and so , in calculations of the superconducting potential , we convert to the following form : @xmath121 which effectively reduces high-@xmath59 modes in the system , in line with the ferromagnetism of the real compound .",
    "this is the simplest , first approximation of such effects .    in fig .",
    "[ lambdadiag ] we show a measure of the superconducting interaction strength , @xmath122 , for various values of @xmath123 , our stoner ` structure factor ' .",

    "@xmath90 , the value of i for the second jump in magnetisation , akin to the pressure identified as @xmath15 in uge@xmath0 , gives rise to the peak at @xmath125 .",
    "also shown is the magnetisation , scaled down by a factor of two in the dimensionless units we are using .",
    "the inset shows the ratio @xmath126 is always less than 1 , as expected . in both plots ,",
    "we show the results for different values of ` stoner structure factor ' , @xmath123 ( eq . [ stonerstruc ] ) .",

    "this quantity peaks in the ferromagnetic state and remains high with decreasing @xmath16 into the paramagnetic state .",
    "again , we show the results for different values of ` stoner structure factor ' , @xmath123 .",
    "the tight - binding parameters used here are again @xmath71 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "the number of spins , @xmath120 . ]    of course , @xmath127 is not the full story when one considers how the superconducting transition temperature @xmath1 should behave as a function of @xmath16 . roughly speaking , @xmath128 ( see , for example , fay and appel  @xcite ) and",
    "there is substantial variation of @xmath129 , the paramagnon energy with @xmath16 , especially when soft magnetic modes are present .",
    "the paramagnon energy can be expanded as @xmath130 where @xmath131 and @xmath132 are temperature dependent parameters , equivalent to @xmath79 and @xmath132 in the work of lonzarich  @xcite . as developed by brinkman and engelsberg @xcite and implemented by fay and appel",
    ", the @xmath129 prefactor will substantially reduce superconductivity at the ferromagnetic @xmath99 and the same argument should apply around the secondary transition at @xmath90 , although in both cases this effect is more drastic for a second order magnetic transition ( where the susceptibility diverges , i.e. @xmath133 ) than for the first order cases here . what remains important , therefore , is the _ stable region of superconductivity in the ferromagnetic state _",
    ", where @xmath122 is approximately flat and high , especially for higher stoner structure factor , @xmath123 .",
    "we might reasonably ask what it is that enhances superconductivity in the region between @xmath97 and @xmath88 . in this range of @xmath16",
    ", the majority fermi level sits between the two van hove peaks , and an examination of the @xmath113 dependence of the interaction potential , eq .",
    "[ fayappelv ] reveals that there is a region of high , sustained zero @xmath113 pairing for @xmath134 .",
    "@xcite at both @xmath99 and @xmath90 , @xmath135 is broad and high around @xmath136 .",
    "outwith the region @xmath134 the pairing potential is smaller and more localised around zero @xmath113 .",
    "furthermore , in the region between @xmath99 and @xmath90 , the mass renormalisation , represented by @xmath103 is also approximately flat and high .",
    "this mass enhancement , shown in fig .",
    "[ massfig ] compares well with the high effective mass plateau found in de haas van alphen measurements on the ferromagnetic state between pressures @xmath7 and @xmath15 .",
    "lastly we note that the order parameter , @xmath109 favoured on tuning @xmath16 , changes as we go through @xmath97 .",
    "this makes sense from the point of view of the fermi surface topology , as depicted in figure [ topologyfig ] .",
    "@xmath137 is favoured when the majority spin sheet is open  for all @xmath138and the @xmath139 order parameter becomes favoured for the closed surfaces for @xmath140 .",
    "as already stated , these are overly simplified gap functions , so this change of symmetry may well be more gradual or masked in a non - unitary representation .    .",
    "also shown is the order parameter used , which changes from @xmath141 for @xmath138 to @xmath139 for @xmath140 .",
    "the tight - binding parameters used here are again @xmath71 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 , and the number of spins , @xmath120 . ]",
    "in this paper we have proposed that the unusual phase diagram of uge@xmath0 is a result of a novel tuning of the fermi surface topology by the magnetisation of the ferromagnetic state .",
    "we have constructed a model for this which illustrates how superconductivity , the tunable magnetization features and the quasiparticle mass are related by a twin - peak density of states feature , consistent with experiment .",
    "indeed , the twin - peak dos feature is also apparent in the most recent lda @xmath48 calculations of the non - magnetic state  @xcite .",
    "we have first looked for an explanation of the two transitions in the low temperature magnetisation of uge@xmath0 . we have shown how a density of states with two peaks as a function of energy will give rise generically to a zero temperature magnetisation which has two transitions as the ratio of stoner exchange energy to bandwidth is tuned .",
    "we have demonstrated how this interesting form of dos arises when the bandstructure is quasi - one - dimensional , as is believed to be the case for uge@xmath0 .",
    "we are thus able to propose a mechanism for the asymmetry of the superconducting @xmath1 with respect to the magnetic quantum phase transition associated with the curie temperature , shifting the focus of our attention away from @xmath7 towards @xmath15 as the magnetic transition point of interest with regard to superconductivity . in our model , a large density of states at the majority spin fermi surface is associated with the @xmath6 transition and is also driving superconductivity .",
    "this causes superconductivity to be favoured in the ferromagnetic state relative to the paramagnetic state in a natural and previously overlooked way , and could also be a reason for the enhancement of superconductivity in the ferromagnetic state of other materials .",
    "we further note that , in a real system , the presence of impurities will probably enhance further the relative tendency to formation of the superconducting state in the ferromagnetic phase .",
    "there is also a straightforward explanation in the band magnetism scenario for the observed metamagnetic behaviour and a large , constant mass enhancement between @xmath90 and @xmath99 , consistent in form with de haas van alphen measurements .",
    "potentially we may have a reason for the disappearance of dhva signal between @xmath15 and @xmath7 , which would here be due to the fermi surface becoming open .",
    "however , we should note that only one set of authors have observed such disappearance of dhva signal  @xcite .",
