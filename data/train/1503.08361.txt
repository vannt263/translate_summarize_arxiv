    "we reduce this wave equation to a purely radial differential equation and show how this radial equation can be transformed to a confluent heun equation .",

    "we have further shown that using an analytic continuation procedure the bounded domain of convergence of the local solution ( i.e. , the unit circle around the horizon in the complex plane ) can be expanded to the entire open interval between the origin and spatial infinity .",
    "it is a remarkable feature that the structure of the radial equations in ef and pg coordinates is the same .",
    "both cases belong to the class of confluent heun equations and can be solved using frobenius series at the regular singularity at @xmath131 that can analytically be continued up to , but not in general including , spatial infinity .",
    "the equations in pg coordinates are somewhat more complicated and we recommend , thus , to treat all these perturbations in ef coordinates .",

    "this solution can be used to investigate various phenomena concerning massless bosonic waves on schwarzschild background and can be adopted to a broad range of initial or boundary value conditions .",
