    "in contrast with the standard model ( sm ) , the exotic gauge particles such as leptoquarks and bileptons , predicted in many extensions of the sm , carry global quantum numbers .",
    "the bileptons are defined as bosons carrying two units of lepton number and are present in the @xmath11 model .",
    "the version of the @xmath11 model with right - handed neutrinos @xcite predicts the existence of single - charged and neutral bileptons .",
    "the family lepton number violation offers a clear signature for the bileptons detection @xcite .",
    "the possibility of detecting neutral bileptons in future colliders has not been studied in the literature .    in the present work",
    "we obtain the partial and the total width of the neutral bilepton @xmath10 , two elementary distributions , the total cross section and some final bilepton distributions for lhc energy regime .",
    "this version of the model includes right - handed neutrinos for each leptonic family and two quark generations ( @xmath12 ) belong to anti - triplet and the other to triplet representation @xmath13    the new quarks @xmath14 and @xmath15 carry @xmath16 and @xmath17 , @xmath7 units of positron charge .",
    "the gauge sector has an extra neutral boson ( @xmath6 ) and bileptons ( @xmath18 and @xmath10 ) .",
    "the important relation , used in the present work , between @xmath6 and the bileptons ( @xmath18 and @xmath10 ) masses is : @xmath19    the neutral current interactions involving quarks and @xmath5 or @xmath20 is given by @xmath21 where the couplings @xmath22 and @xmath23 can be found in @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian for the interaction between the quarks and the @xmath10 is : @xmath24",
    "let us consider first the partial and total width of the @xmath10 .",
    "the main decay modes are @xmath25 ( @xmath26 carries two units of lepton number ) and @xmath27 .",
    "fixing the exotic quark masses equal to @xmath28 gev , we obtain the following values for @xmath29 : @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 gev for @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 gev respectively .    the main contributions for @xmath10 pair production in @xmath36 collision depend on the initial quark @xmath37 charge .",
    "when @xmath38 , only @xmath5 and @xmath39 _ via _ s - channel contribute and , on the other hand , when @xmath40 we have an additional t - channel heavy quark exchange contribution . in our calculations",
    "we employed the comphep package @xcite .",
    "beginning with the dominant elementary process @xmath41 and @xmath42 , we find some final bileptons distributions . in the figure 1 , for example",
    ", we display the @xmath10 angular distribution relative to the initial beam direction .",
    "these distributions were calculated by imposing the cuts on the final states    @xmath43 gev .",
    "we note that the angular distribution shapes are different for @xmath44 and @xmath45 initial quarks .",
    "this is expected because @xmath42 receives an additional heavy quark @xmath8channel contribution , leading to a more asymmetric distribution .",
    "now for @xmath46 collisions at @xmath47 tev , we employ the cteq661 @xcite structure functions .",
    "we show in figure 2 the resulting @xmath10 angular distribution relative to the initial beam direction and the @xmath10 rapidity distribution .",
    "the angular distribution shape is almost flat and are independent of @xmath20 mass , while the @xmath10 rapidity distribution is more concentrate for higher @xmath20 masses . finally , we show in the figure 3 the differential cross section as a function of the invariant @xmath10 pair mass .",
    "we note that the this distribution decreases when @xmath48 increases .",
    "in this work we have presented some initial results for the production of neutral bileptons predicted in the version of the 3 - 3 - 1 model with right - handed neutrinos .",
    "we have shown some distributions for the elementary process in @xmath49 collisions .",
    "the inclusion of heavy quarks leads to unique signature and the @xmath10 decay into two leptons , via bileptoquark and charged bilepton . for an annual luminosity at the lhc ( @xmath50 fb@xmath51 )",
    "we find @xmath52 @xmath10 pairs produced _ per _ year .",
    "the next step in our analysis is to consider the @xmath10 decay into leptons in order to compare it with @xmath5 decay .",
    "this comparison can possibly reveal a signature of the neutral bilepton production .",
