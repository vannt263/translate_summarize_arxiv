    "spontaneous emission of light from initially excited atoms became one of the corner stones of our understanding of the interaction of light and matter , soon after the introduction of the `` photon '' .",
    "it was introduced phenomenologically by einstein @xcite through his famous @xmath0-coefficient that gives the rate of spontaneous de - excitation of an excited atom .",
    "later , spontaneous emission was understood through the theory of wigner and weisskopf @xcite as the result of the perturbation of an atom through the vacuum - fluctuations of the electromagnetic field surrounding the atom .",
    "the infinitely large number of modes involved in the process leads to effectively irreversible behavior .",
    "once this mechanism was understood , it became clear that the rate with which the excitation of an atom in a given state decays is not a natural constant for this atom , but can be influenced by its environment . by engineering the mode - structure of the electromagnetic environment of an atom , in particular through modifying the density of states of the field modes at the resonance frequency ,",
    "spontaneous emission can be enhanced ( in the case of an increased density of states ) , or reduced ( in the opposite case ) , as first found by purcell in the context of nuclear resonance @xcite .",
    "this important insight is now routinely used in photonic crystals , where an electromagnetic band - structure can be designed at will and used for creating e.g.  a band gap around the resonance frequency , resulting in largely increased lifetime of an excited atom , inverted spin , exciton , or plasmonic excitation @xcite . + even earlier , dicke studied spontaneous emission of several atoms in close vicinity of each other , and found that in such a case spontaneous emission becomes a cooperative effect in which the amplitudes of all atoms emitting simultaneously interfere . depending on the initial collective internal state of the atoms ,",
    "emission can be largely enhanced ( superradiance ) , or reduced ( subradiance ) @xcite .",
    "superradiance developed to a large research field in its own right @xcite , culminating recently in matter - wave superradiance in cold atomic gases @xcite .",
    "it was soon realized that dipole - dipole interactions between atoms can significantly alter these cooperative processes @xcite , but can also be exploited for a variety of purposes , such as the ( partial ) trapping of light @xcite or the implementation of quantum gates using the dipole blockade  @xcite .    in this paper , we reveal yet a third mechanism how spontaneous emission can be influenced : collective emission can be largely `` quantum programmed '' by engineering the external quantum state of motion of the atoms . to this end ,",
    "we derive a master equation that fully takes into account the quantum nature of the atomic motion and , when relevant , the indistinguishability of atoms .",
    "this is essential when the atoms form a bose - einstein condensate or are loaded in an optical lattice .",
    "for example , when two fermionic atoms are placed in the same potential well and motional state , one in the internal excited state and the other in the ground state , the pauli exclusion principle forbids the main decay channel , and leads to an increased lifetime of the atomic excited state  ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , it has been known for a long time that the coherence of radiation scattering off atoms in a solid ( e.g.  in x - ray or neutron scattering ) can be influenced through the thermal motion of the atoms .",
    "this results in the debye - waller factor @xcite that describes the reduction of visibility of interference maxima as function of temperature .",
    "but while in a solid one has in general little influence on the state of motion of the atoms ( apart from controlling the temperature of the lattice ) , a whole new world has opened up in the physics of ion - traps and cold atoms . there",
    ", the external motional state can now be very well controlled and engineered , to the extent that quantum gates coupling internal states of the atoms originally relied heavily on the use of precise states of this external `` quantum bus '' @xcite , even though this requirement could be relaxed later @xcite .",
    "thus , the quantum nature of the atomic motion appears to be an efficient way to influence the internal dynamics of atoms and its engineering has a wide range of potential applications  @xcite .",
    "however , it turns out that most of the methods used to describe the internal dynamics of atoms including a quantum treatment of their motion are either restricted to the lamb - dicke regime @xcite or do not account for both recoil and indistinguishability  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it appears worthwhile to develop a general theory of spontaneous emission of an ensemble of atoms valid for arbitrary quantum states of motion , which is the purpose of this paper .",
    "the master equation we derive constitutes a powerful tool to study the combined effects of the recoil and the indistinguishability of atoms on both their dissipative and conservative internal dynamics , even beyond the lamb - dicke regime .",
    "the dependence of the dipole - dipole interactions as well as the life - time under spontaneous emission on the motional state of the atoms might be observable in dense rydberg gases , which are under intense current experimental and theoretical investigation @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present our model . in section iii , we derive a general master equation for the internal dynamics of atoms valid for arbitrary motional states . in section iv , we provide general expressions for the dipole - dipole shifts and decay rates which determine the conservative and dissipative part of the master equation , and discuss the effects of the indistinguishability of atoms on these quantities . in section",
    "v , we calculate explicitly the decay rates and the dipole - dipole shifts for particularly relevant motional states ( gaussian states , fock states and thermal states ) , both for distinguishable and indistinguishable atoms .",
    "we consider @xmath1 identical two - level atoms spontaneously emitting photons due to their interaction with the free electromagnetic field initially in vacuum , and treat their motion quantum - mechanically . in the point of view of power - zienau - wolley ( multipolar coupling scheme @xcite ) , the hamiltonian describing the composite system is @xmath2 with @xmath3 the hamiltonian of the atoms , @xmath4 the hamiltonian of the free field , and @xmath5 the interaction hamiltonian responsible for emission / absorption of photons and field - mediated interactions between atoms .    in eq .",
