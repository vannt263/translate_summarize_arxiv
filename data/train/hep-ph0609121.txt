    "the original motivation @xcite to consider heavy quarkonium production in a region of color deconfinement was the realization that the number of charm pairs initially produced in a central heavy collision will be at least of order 10 @xcite at rhic 200 energy .",
    "preliminary model estimates indicated that interactions of a quark and antiquark which were not produced in the same nucleon - nucleon collision ( the so - called off - diagonal pairs ) will result in formation of additional ( now called recombination ) which would mask the expected suppression @xcite due to medium effects .",
    "however , these model estimates proved to be very sensitive to details of various parameters which control the recombination process @xcite .",
    "phenix results have now provided a first look at the total population in terms of the ratio over a large range of collision centrality @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , one sees a suppression factor which is very close to that observed at sps energy .",
    "a number of models predicted that there would be substantially more suppression at rhic , and all were thus incompatible with these initial results .",
    "however , models in which some sort of in - medium recombination process is included find a total population which is not incompatible with the phenix results .",
    "this can be taken as evidence that the recombination process is indeed significant at rhic energy .",
    "however , one must have confidence that the suppression parameters used are indeed appropriate at rhic , which at this time has no independent confirmation .",
    "in fact , there is a proposed alternate scenario @xcite in which the observed suppression at both sps and rhic energies is entirely due to dissociation of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 which would otherwise have provided additional from decay feed - down .",
    "we show in figure [ raaplot ] some model predictions with and without recombination compared with the initial phenix measurements .",
    "the set of model parameters was motivated in @xcite which uses an initial temperature @xmath2 = 500 mev and @xmath3 initially - produced @xmath4 pairs for central collisions , where the charm quark momentum distribution is calculated in pqcd .",
    "the prediction for no recombination ( stars ) leads to almost complete suppression of initially - produced .",
    "inclusion of in - medium charm quark recombination ( blue circles ) dominates over almost the complete centrality range , and the sum ( green diamonds ) is seen to follow the trend of the measured points fairly well .",
    "we note that since the normalization of was not contained in the model predictions , we choose to normalize to unity at the most peripheral points .",
    "to illustrate the fragility of such an interpretation , we also show model predictions in which no recombination process occurs and the initial temperature is decreased to 350 mev .",
    "the resulting ( black squares ) is also seen to be roughly compatible with the data .",
    "thus in the absence of independent information on the initial temperature parameter in this model , we can not use the measurements to make a definitive statement .",
    "fortunatately , the transverse momentum spectra of the surviving are also measured , and we can use this additional information to test the various scenarios . in the next section we review the use of spectra as a signal of the production mechanism .",
    "the following section summarizes the crucial role of centrality dependence and presents a comparison with the phenix measurements .",
    "finally , we include for the first time the effects of nuclear absorption on these signals , and illustrate the experimental precision necessary for a definitive result .",
    "the number of formed in a medium via recombination of pairs of @xmath5 and @xmath6 quarks is determined by the competition between the recombination and dissociation cross sections . in the case where the total number @xmath7 is much less than the initial number of quark pairs @xmath8",
    ", the solution is of the form    @xmath9^{-1}\\ , dt } ] , \\label{eqbeta}\\ ] ]    where @xmath10 and @xmath11 define the lifetime of the deconfined region , and @xmath12 are the formation and dissociation cross section reactivities , respectively , and @xmath13 is the ( expending ) volume of the deconfinement region .",
    "note that the function @xmath14 would be the suppression factor in this scenario if the formation mechanism were neglected .",
    "one sees that the second term , quadratic in @xmath8 , is precisely the total number of possible recombinations which could occur in the deconfinement volume , modified by the factor @xmath15 , which is just the suppression factor for formed between times @xmath16 and @xmath11 . to calculate the transverse momentum or rapidity spectra of the formed via recombination",
    ", one must use a version of this solution which is differential in the momentum .",
    "since the cross section used here is simple gluo - ionization of the bound state by the interaction of its color dipole with free gluons in the medium , the differential cross section expression is trivial . to solve the equation",
    ", we first generate a set of @xmath4 pairs according to pqcd amplitudes @xcite to fix the kinematic distributions of the recombining quarks .",
    "the resulting spectra of the is then    @xmath17    where the sum over all @xmath4 pairs incorporates the total formation reactivity .",
    "the charm quark spectra we calculate from pqcd have used collinear parton interactions only . to simulate the effects of confinement in nucleons , and more importantly the initial state broadening due to multiple scattering of nucleons",
    ", we have supplemented the quark pair distributions by adding a transverse momentum kick to each quark in a diagonal pair , chosen from a gaussian distribution with width characterized by @xmath18 .",
    "this effect is magnified in the difference between diagonal and off - diagonal pairs .",
    "since the azimuthal direction of the @xmath19 is uncorrelated from pair - to - pair , an off - diagonal pair with initial @xmath20 will inherit an increase of 2 @xmath18 .",
    "however , the azimuthal correlation inherent in the diagonal pair will result in an increase 4 @xmath18 .",
    "this effect is evident when we investigate the @xmath18 dependence of charm quark pairs and formed from recombination .",
    "we find that :    * @xmath21  = 0.8 + 4 @xmath18 gev@xmath22 * @xmath23  = 4.9 + 2 @xmath18 gev@xmath22 * @xmath24  = 2.4 + @xmath18 gev@xmath22    we use reference data on @xmath25 production in pp interactions @xcite , which of course involves diagonal pairs , to fix @xmath26 gev@xmath22 .",
    "the corresponding value in nuclear interactions depends on the centrality , which we determine in the next section .",
    "we use the standard random walk picture of initial state nn interactions to model the transverse momentum broadening in pa and aa interactions @xcite .",
    "this uses a parameter @xmath27 , which is _ proportional _ to the average @xmath18 per initial state collision ( a factor of 0.5 times the probability for initial state parton elastic scattering in a given inelastic nn collision is conventionally absorbed in the definition ) .",
    "the net broadening in a pa collision can be parameterized in terms of the product of this @xmath27 and @xmath28 , the average number of inelastic collisions each nucleon incurs _ before _",
    "the interaction in which the charm quark pair is produced . in terms of the total number of collisions per initial state nucleon ( n ) , this number is @xmath29    we extract @xmath30 gev@xmath22 from the nuclear broadening measurements of produced in minimum bias d - au interactions @xcite .",
    "the corresponding @xmath31 is then calculated as a function of centrality , parameterized by the total number @xmath32 of binary collisions .",
    "the final results for @xmath20 of initially - produced from diagonal @xmath4 pairs and @xmath20 of formed in - medium are shown in figure [ directvsformationpt2 ] .",
    "one sees that they differ by increasing amounts as centrality increases , which is a direct consequence of their different @xmath4 pair precursors ( diagonal or off - diagonal ) .",
    "we note that the initial production curve ( higher @xmath20 ) should describe the sequential production scenario , in which all observed originate from unsupressed direct production @xcite .",
    "the in - medium production curve ( lower @xmath20 ) would describe a situation in which all of the initially - produced have been screened away , and thus all observed are due to in - medium formation processes .",
    "we should stress that these calculations of @xmath20 use the charm quark momentum distributions which follow from initial production via pqcd amplitudes .",
    "one might expect that the actual physical situation would be some weighted sum of these two extreme cases .",
    "( for a discussion of comparison with preliminary data , see @xcite . )",
    "we should stress that these calculations of @xmath20 use the charm quark momentum distributions which follow from initial production via pqcd amplitudes .",
    "there is an additional effect on the spectrum of directly - produced due to their interaction in cold nuclear matter which they encounter on their path out of the interaction region .",
    "we note that this effect can not modify the formed via recombination in the medium , since the formation process takes place at a later stage .",
    "one could include the nuclear absorption effect in a full glauber calculation of the initial production of , but for simplicity we here extract a correction factor for the spectra using an effective absorption cross section in a path length geometry .",
    "this will involve an extension of the random - walk picture of individual nn collisions which occur both before and after the point at which a hard interaction produces the @xmath4 pair which eventually emerges as a @xmath25 .",
    "what we wish to calculate in this picture is the average number of such nn collisions which occur _ before _ the collision in which the @xmath25 production is initiated . in the absence of nuclear absorption ,",
    "the relative probability of observing a @xmath25 will be independent of the spatial position of its production point .",
    "this leads to the expression in eq .",
    "[ collisionpoint ] . with nuclear absorption",
    ", however , one must weight each of the possible production points by the probability that the @xmath25 produced at a given position will survive to be observed in the final state .",
    "let @xmath33 be the relative probability that the @xmath25 survives its path through the remaining nuclear matter , where n is the total number of nn interactions and m specifies the number in this sequence at which the @xmath25 production point occurs .",
    "we parameterize this in a simple straight - line trajectory model , to obtain    @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the average absorption factor encountered by the @xmath25 in each path length between nn collisions . here",
    "@xmath36 is the density of nuclear matter and @xmath37 is the absorption cross section .          in the limiting case of zero nuclear absorption , @xmath33 = 1",
    ", @xmath40 = n , and one recovers @xmath41 . in the opposite limit of infinite absorption ,",
    "@xmath33 vanishes unless m = n , resulting in @xmath28 = n-1 .",
    "this correctly describes the effective number of initial state collisions for a @xmath25 which is produced in the final collision point at the back of the nucleus , the only possibility which avoids complete absorption .",
    "we show in figure [ infiniteabs ] the corresponding ( maximum ) increase in @xmath20 .    for finite nuclear absorption in terms of @xmath42 , a numerical evaluation yields @xmath43 , for @xmath44 .",
    "we show in figure [ pt2andnucabs ] the predicted @xmath20 spectra of initially produced diagonal @xmath4 pairs , as appropriate for initial production of @xmath25 in au - au interactions .",
    "one sees that the effect of nuclear absorption always results in increased @xmath20 , which enhances the difference with respect to in - medium @xmath25 production .",
    "even the smallest absorption cross section considered ( 3 mb ) shifts the prediction upward to an extent which may prove difficult to reconcile with preliminary phenix data at both forward and mid rapidity @xcite .",
