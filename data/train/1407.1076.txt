    "we measure equivalent widths ( ews ) for 246 fei and 22 feii lines in iraf and keep only lines where the ew is less than @xmath0 100 m as larger ews are prone to errors in the dampening coefficient and enhanced contribution from the wings .",
    "we also remove lines that are below 5 m due to noise contamination , lines which are affected by cosmic ray hits , or lines that are too badly blended to contribute believable ews . for these reasons ,",
    "no two stars have the same final line list , and the final line list for our moving group stars averaged 158 fei lines and 12 feii lines .",
    "we chose to use the tgvittakeda / tgv/ ] code ( takeda et al . 2002 , takeda et al . 2005 ) which uses the typical excitation and ionization balance in an iterative procedure to solve for the above parameters . to produce precise results",
    ", we use a bootstrap method by randomly selecting 90@xmath10 of the fei and feii lines , executing tgvit , running the automated _ checkup _ tool which removes lines that differ by @xmath112.5@xmath12 , and repeated this process four times to ensure no lines are driving a bad fit .",
    "we run 150 iterations for each star .",
    "the archetype of this procedure is shown in figure [ bootstrap ] .",
    "the errors involved in this method are from two main sources : the ews and the iteration process in tgvit .",
    "we estimate a generous 5@xmath10 error in our ews based on continuum placement and snr .",
    "this error is implemented in our bootstrap code via a random error between 0 and 5% on the input ew .",
    "tgvit determines errors in the program by individually adjusting each parameter until one of the following conditions is not satisfied : abundance vs. excitation potential independence , abundance vs. equivalent width independence , or ionization balance .",
    "these errors are independent of each other and thus we add in quadrature the standard deviation of the bootstrap method to the average error found in tgvit and report them in table [ param ] . after a detailed analysis",
    ", it was found that covariance errors were negligible since tgvit varies temperature and surface gravity simultaneously .",
    "full treatment can be seen in appendix a.    in addition to the above technique , we also performed an analysis using the 2013 version of moogchris / moog.html ] ( sneden 1973 ) using the same line list and atomic parameters as were used in the tgvit analysis .",
    "our procedure is as such : ( 1 ) run moog under the abfind setting , utilizing interpolated kurucz atlas9 models ( castelli & kurucz 2004 ) with no convective overshoot and an initial estimate of the parameters given by tgvit ; ( 2 ) clip features whose abundance varies by 2.5@xmath12 and iterate until no lines are above this threshold ; ( 3 ) adjust each parameter until achieving the minimum slope in abundance of fei ( a(fei ) ) vs. excitation potential to find t@xmath1 and a(fei ) vs. reduced equivalent width to find v@xmath2 , and achieve ionization balance between a(fei ) and a(feii ) to find log(g ) and [ fe / h ] .    figure [ vf_comp ] display the results of both techniques performed on the vf05 sample .",
    "these results indicate that moog typically gives slightly smaller values for t@xmath1 and [ fe / h ] and significantly smaller values for log(g ) .",
    "lower surface gravities using moog are also found in tsantaki et al .",
    "( 2013 ) and sousa et al .",
    "( 2008 ) who compare surface gravities from moog to those derived from hipparcos parallaxes ( van leeuwen 2007 ) and find that moog underestimates surface gravities by as much as 0.5 dex near log(g ) @xmath0 4.5 .",
    "we therefore do not use the moog values and only report those found using the tgvit bootstrap method ; however , we would like to note that agreement with vf05 does not imply correctness .",
    "to further evaluated moog vs. tgvit surface gravities , we test masses derived using both methods to masses derived using torres et al . ( 2010 ) with corrections from santos et al .",
    "( 2013 ) in section 3.2 .      once these initial parameters are found , we use the prescription in mccarthy & white ( 2012 ) to solve for the radius .",

    "2000 ) , giving tycho @xmath14 and @xmath15 values which are converted into v magnitudes using the method in bessell ( 2000 ) .",
    "all but two stars ( bd-04 1063 and bd-09 1034 ) have updated hipparcos parallaxes ( van leeuwen 2007 ) ; for the other two , we use the distances listed in torres et al .",
    "( 2008 ) which are derived from a convergence method outlined in torres et al .",
    "bolometric corrections for the v band ( bc@xmath16 ) are found using the coefficients in table 1 of torres ( 2010 ) . when applied to our solar spectrum , we find bc@xmath17 = -0.07 , corresponding to a solar bolometric magnitude of m@xmath18 = 4.74 ( flower 1996 ) .",
    "all of this information produced the luminosities for each star .",
    "the luminosities coupled with our computed temperatures are used to determine the final radius values .",
    "we calculate the mass for each star using @xmath19 where m is the mass of the star , g is the surface gravity , r is radius , and g is the gravitational constant .",
    "this method has been tested using main sequence evolutionary models in vf05 and sousa et al .",
    "these studies found that masses derived from spectroscopic features are typically overestimated in when m @xmath11 1 m@xmath9 and underestimated when m @xmath20 1 m@xmath9 . in figure [ masscomp ]",
    "we compare the masses found from the 12 vf05 stars using the spectroscopic technique in section 3.1 with vf05 masses derived from evolutionary models .",
    "we find a 6@xmath10 scatter between our values and vf05 with a minor offset of + 0.05 m@xmath9 .",
    "this scatter is nearly identical to the average internal error in our derived vf05 masses of 0.06 m@xmath9 ; therefore , we believe the bootstrap tgvit method gives better estimates of the surface gravity which is the driving parameter in mass determination .    to further evaluate our mass estimates , we compared our masses for the vf05 stars to masses derived following torres et al .",
    "( 2010 ) with corrections made by santos et al .",
    "( 2013 ) . after removing the giants from our sample",
    ", we found our masses were 0.01 @xmath4 0.09 m@xmath9 larger than the torres et al .",
    "( 2010 ) study , similar to the comparison against the vf05 evolutionary model masses . when applying the correction from santos et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , we found a difference of 0.09 @xmath4 0.09 m@xmath9 , still in agreement with our previous comparison .",
    "in addition to the tgvit bootstrap values , we also found masses using the moog atmospheric parameters .",

    "( 2013 ) correction , masses still differed by -0.21 @xmath4 0.13 m@xmath9 .",
    "we therefore find the masses using the tgvit parameters to be more physically accurate than those using moog parameters .",
    "errors listed for the radii and masses in table [ param ] are from four sources : the tycho-2 colors , parallax estimates , t@xmath1 and log(g ) .",
    "we use standard error propagation formalism to find the final uncertainties .",
    "the first three sources of error primarily manifest themselves in the bolometric magnitude uncertainties which directly correspond to luminosity errors .",
    "these luminosity errors are the dominate source of error in the radius .",
    "surface gravity errors are the dominate source of error in the mass .      before the procedure in section 3.1 was implemented , we measured the radial velocity ( rv ) of each star to determine the observed wavelength for each iron line .",
    "rvs were calculated by tame ( kang & lee 2012 ) , an automated ew estimator which allows the user to adjust the continuum level interactively .",
    "occasionally blending will be so bad that tame is not able to pick out the correct line .",
    "we take this into account by running an idl procedure to remove lines whose rv s are greater than 2.5@xmath12 away from the median value of all fe lines .",
    "we then calculate the ratio of the ew found from tame to the ew of the sun ( found in iraf ) and plot this against the excitation potential of the line .",
    "a linear trend is fit to remove the temperature dependence and we select only lines which fall within 2.5@xmath12 of this slope .",
    "the final rv is taken from the remaining lines .",
    "the average standard deviation between our method and vf05 is 0.8 km s@xmath3 and our radial velocities are slightly larger with an average difference of + 0.6 km s@xmath3 .",
    "vsin(i ) values are estimated using a @xmath8 method comparing the observed data against interpolated model spectra from the kurucz atlas9 model atmospheres and using spectrum ( gray & corbally 1994 ) to produce a high resolution synthetic spectrum .",
    "the synthetic spectra were degraded in resolution to match the fwhm of the thar emission features for each echelle order and a vsin(i ) profile was convolved with spectrum as outlined by gray ( 1992 ) in steps of 1.5 km s@xmath3 .",
    "we found the minimum @xmath8 for 10 isolated fei lines and averaged to find the final vsin(i ) for the star .",
    "figure [ vsini ] presents this method where the top panel shows the @xmath8 for the particular line and the bottom panel displays the observed data in a solid line with the synthetic data in a dashed line .",
    "the middle spectral line is the best fit to the data .",
    "occasionally , an observed feature will have a cosmic ray in its spectrum .",
    "this results in a very poor estimate of the feature and can skew the final result considerably .",
    "we account for this in the final stage by removing any feature whose vsin(i ) is greater than 2@xmath12 deviant from the average .",
    "our errors are the 1@xmath12 deviation in vsin(i ) measurements .",
    "lithium ews are found by measuring the @xmath21li 6708 line in iraf .",
    "we estimate the same 5% error on our measurements here as we did in section 3.1 .",
    "nearby young moving groups provide an excellent testbed for the chemical homogeneity of a molecular cloud .",
    "it is presumed that each star in a moving group formed from the same parent molecular cloud , and thus the differences in elemental abundance can relay meaningful insights on how well each element is mixed .",
    "these abundances also provide information regarding potential planet hosting stars .",
    "fischer & valenti ( 2005 ) showed that higher metalicity stars are more likely to harbor planets while more recent studies by kang et al .",

    "ews for all lines are measured in iraf and fed into moog under the _ abfind _ setting with interpolated atlas9 model atmospheres .",
    "we perform this analysis on the solar spectrum taken during our observing run and the final [ x / h ] are the averaged line - to - line abundance differences between the star and the sun .",

    "errors from the line - to - line scatter were added in quadrature to the errors caused by the atmospheric parameters .",
    "when only one line was available , the uncertainties given are 0.10 dex .    of the abd sample listed in tables [ abun ] and [ ctd ] ,",
    "there are 2 stars with noticeable abundance differences .",
    "the first is bd-04 1063 which has the lowest fe abundance in the sample .",
    "this star has significantly lower [ na / h ] , [ tii / h ] and [ ni / h ] , while having slightly larger [ al / h ] . in figure [ abdormetals ] , this star is typically equal to or above trends in [ x / fe ] vs. [ fe / h ] .",
    "it is possible that our measured fe abundance is too low star for this star , and that if the abundance were solar , this star would follow most of the trends with the exception of na , tii , mn , and ni .",
    "the other outlier is bd-15 200 which , conversely , has the largest fe abundance .",
    "while it remains consistent with the usual trends in [ x / fe ] , it does have a noticeably lower mg abundance and larger mn abundance .",
    "bd-15 200 ( hd 6569 ) was also observed in ba13 and they found similar results with moderate exceptions in al , si , and mn and a large exception in cr .",
    "interestingly , in the ba13 study , bd-15 200 was barely able to be claimed as chemically coherent with two other abd stars which raises a flag about its membership in the group .    in figure [ abdormetals ]",
    "we display the abd sample of elemental abundances .",
    "the error bars are the average standard deviation given by moog .",
    "this plot displays the trends in [ x / fe ] vs. [ fe / h ] .",
    "the two stars mentioned earlier ( bd-04 1063 and bd-15 200 ) are significant outliers in [ fe / h ] and possible outliers in other elements . if we assume each element has an equal weight in the overall metal abundance of a star , we calculate @xmath23>$ ] = -0.03 @xmath4 0.06 both including and excluding bd-04 and bd-15 .",

    "it is likely that the average elemental abundances are consistent for all abd stars .",
    "therefore , if a star is found to not be chemically consistent with these results it should raise questions about its membership ( such as bd-04 1065 and bd-15 200 ) .",
    "figure [ vfmetals ] shows a comparison of our metal abundances vs. those found in vf05 to ensure our procedure is working properly .",
    "the vf05 study only found the abundance for na , si , ti , fe , and ni , therefore we consider this a `` spot check '' of all metal abundances .",
    "the average difference between our values and vf05 regardless of the element is @xmath24 [ x / h ] = 0.01 @xmath4 0.04 , where the error comes from the standard deviation .",
    "it is no surprise the best agreement is found in ni as this element has @xmath0 35 measurable spectral features and the worst agreement is in na since there are only 3 lines .",
    "in addition to chemical homogeneity , stars of the same moving group should have a common origin .",
    "estimating the inception of a moving group involves mapping a galactic potential and using current uvw velocities and xyz positions to trace the motion back in time .",
    "this method is commonly referred to as a kinematic traceback ( ktb ) .",
    "to traceback abd , we use the equations of motion outlined by asiain et al .",
    "( 1999 ) in section 2 of that paper . in brief",
    ", it is assumed that the galactic potential only consists of the halo , bulge , and disk components with no contribution from other potentials such as spiral arms or the bar , nor do we consider effects cause by heating processes .",
    "we use the heliocentric coordinates @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 which are co - moving with the sun where @xmath25 is positive toward the galactic anti - center , @xmath26 is positive in the direction of the suns orbit , and @xmath27 is positive coming out of the galactic plane .",
    "the epicyclic approximation is used over more complex treatment as these stars are in nearly circular orbits and do not have large peculiar velocities .",
    "the equations of motion are found from equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) of asiain et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . for our calculations ,",
    "the epicyclic frequency and vertical frequency are roughly 40.0 km s@xmath3kpc@xmath3 and 73.5 km s@xmath3kpc@xmath3 respectively .",
    "the galactic variables used in our ktb code are found in table [ gal ] .",
    "table [ uvw ] displays the initial positions and velocities of our stars .",
    "using parallaxes and ra / dec coordinates from hipparcos and rvs from this work , uvw space motions are found using the publicly available _ galuvw _ idl program and xyz positions are calculated from a self produced idl routine . for bd-04 1063 and bd-09 1034 , the two stars not listed in hipparcos , we use distances from torres et al .",

    "we follow the procedure outlined in ortega et al .",
    "( 2007 ) to find the present velocity and positions for the pleiades and use the values listed in torres et al . (",
    "2008 ) for abd .",
    "errors present are from hipparcos data and our rvs .",

    "( 150 myr ) the size of the points represent the standard deviation among final positions the 1,000 trajectories ; typical errors are @xmath28 75 pc .",
    "likewise , the errors listed in table [ uvw ] are the standard deviation of the 1,000 initial positions and velocities for each star .    from figure [ abdtrace ] , there are 8 stars which share similar tracebacks and 7 stars which occupy the same location at 125 myr .",
    "these 7 stars are kinematically consistent with the general motion of abd and were likely formed at the same time ; therefore , we consider this the `` locus '' of our sample . in the 125 myr panel ,",
    "the outlying stars from left to right are bd+37 604 a , bd-15 200 , and bd+41 4749 .",
    "bd+37 604 a has a slightly more negative u velocity and rv as well as slightly smaller v and w velocities than the bulk of abd , likely attributing to its deviant motion .",
    "interestingly , this star appears to follow more closely to the pleiades than to abd .",
    "the star which follows a completely separate trajectory from abd is bd+41 4749 .",
    "this is likely due to its large negative radial velocity and smaller u velocity .",
    "though this star is wildly inconsistent with the other abd members in the traceback , its surface gravity and lithium abundance show its youth and therefore we do not dismiss this star from the group based on one test ; however , it does raise questions about its membership .",
    "in addition to tracing the orbits of individual stars , figure [ flyby ] displays the distance from each star to the bulk motion of abd ( top ) and the pleiades ( bottom ) .",
    "our sample diverges rapidly from the pleiades , implying abd is its own separate group . in the top panel",
    ", there are 7 stars which converge to less than 100 pc from abd between 123 - 130 myr , the exact time scale predicted by luhman et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , ortega et al . ( 2007 ) , and ba13 .",
    "this convergence has been refereed to as the `` focusing phenomena '' in yuan ( 1977 ) and yuan & waxman ( 1977 ) . while this data is suggestive of a @xmath0125 myr group , soderblom ( 2010 ) notes a fundamental limitation on kinematic ages of 20 - 30 myr due to interactions with massive objects ( e.g. molecular clouds or other stars ) as stars go through their orbits .",
    "we therefore proceed with caution when making claims of the age of abd using the ktb .",

    "this star remains close to abd for 100 myrs before dramatically deviating from the rest of the group . as noted in section 4 , this star has the largest metal abundance in our sample .",
    "one conjecture for its deviation at 100 myrs is this star formed at a later epoch of star formation , after the most massive stars enriched the environment with more metals .",
    "this type of age separation has been observed by palla et al .",
    "( 2007 ) in the orion nebula cluster , finding an older population ( 10 - 30 myr ) along with a younger population ( 1 - 2 myr ) , implying a time - dependent pattern of star formation .",
    "often times directly determining the mass or radius of a star is not possible as the star may not have a companion or the separation of its companion is too far to measure accurate orbital parameters .",
    "heavy emphasis is then placed on stellar evolutionary models to estimate the mass and radius .",
    "main sequence models have been empirically refined thanks to long baseline interferometers such as the chara array ( ten brummelaar et al .",
    "2005 ) which can resolve stellar radii down to @xmath0 0.34 milli - arcseconds ( baines et al .",
    "2012 ) , enough to resolve the radius of individual stars or determine orbital elements of nearby binary stars ( see raghavan et al .",
    "2009 , white et al .",
    "however , in the pms regime there are upwards of 10 evolutionary models , all with different input physics leading to systematic differences in radius and mass between 50 - 200 % depending on the choice of model ( hillenbrand & white 2004 ) . using nearby ,",
    "young moving groups is pivotal for constraining pms models since we can accurately determine temperatures and luminosities , place the stars on an hrd and thus provide an empirical test of the models .",
    "this way , when the pms models are applied to fainter groups , the only uncertainties will be from observations , not from the models .    to begin this empirical test , in figure [ iso_paper ] we display evolutionary models from 3 prominent groups , siess et al .",
    "( 2000 , sdf00 ) in the top left panel , baraffe et al .",
    "( 1998 , bcah98 ) in the top right , and yrec ( in prep ) in the bottom two panels .",
    "our sample of 10 abd stars is plotted on top of these models .",
    "there is a thin isochrone of 8 abd stars around the 100 myr , consistent with previous estimates for the moving groups age ( see ortega et al .",
    "2007 , ba13 ) .",
    "two stars lie above this isochrone around 60 myr .",
    "this elevation could be caused by errors in the parameters of these stars , formation in a later epoch , or potentially not being associated with the moving group entirely .",
    "the latter hypothesis is likely for the hottest outlying star , bd-04 1063 , whose age is nearly 60 myr .",
    "this star is also the most metal poor of our sample and it is possible that it could be a member of a slightly younger , less metal rich moving group . the other outlying star is bd+23 296 a who has a k4 companion at @xmath29 ( torres et al .",
    "while the tycho-2 catalog can resolve separations of @xmath30 , it could be possible that its companion or a potentially unresolved companion and is adding flux into the v band which would lift the star above the isochrone .",
    "it could also be that the parallax is incorrect .",
    "the original hipparcos parallax is 30.99 milli - arcseconds ( mas ) ( perryman & esa 1997 ) ; however , the updated parallax in van leeuwen ( 2007 ) places this star 4 pc farther away with a parallax of 27.3 mas which consequently leads to a larger luminosity . placing the star 4",
    "pc closer has a profound effect on the luminosity , but it does not completely rectify the problem . in order for bd+23 296 a to fall along the same isochrone as abd , it would have to be 10 pc closer than the van leeuwen ( 2007 ) distance , therefore it may be a combination of incorrect parallaxes and additional binary flux that leads to this stars elevation on the hrd .",
    "in addition to moving group membership , these plots also give important information regarding the evolutionary models themselves .",
    "the thin 100 myr isochrone places these stars on the bottom of the main sequence and provides a firm lower limit on where the pms models should reach .",
    "it is clear that neither the sdf00 nor bcah98 models accurately predict the transition from pms to zams .",
    "the models which best fit the data are those from yrec .",
    "while the [ m / h ] = 0.0 models empirically match the abd data , the [ m / h ] = -0.1 provide the best fit to the data .",
    "the best fit was determined by finding the mean minimum distance from each star ( exculding the two above ) to the 100 myr isochrone on the hrd .",
    "this result is generally consistent with our findings in section 4 that the group is slightly less metal abundant than the sun . at the moment",
    ", the yrec models most accurately describe the transition from pms to zams . in order to make further claims ,",
    "several moving group with different ages should be tested against these models to see how well each model matches the empirical data .",
    "_ bd-04 1063 _ : this star is peculiar in nearly every facet of this study , beginning with its fundamental parameters .",
    "the surface gravity of this star ( log(g ) = 4.366 ) is much lower than all other members of abd , and its radius is 1.12 r@xmath9 while its mass is slightly lower ( 1.03 m@xmath9 ) , indicative of a younger star .",
    "this conjecture is supported by its placement on the hr diagram , as seen in figure [ iso_paper ] , as being nearly 60 myr .",
    "in addition , the chemical composition of this star is much lower than the rest of our abd sample .",
    "while this star does traceback with abd , the other aspects of this study warrant a younger , more metal poor moving group , and thus we do not consider bd-04 1063 as a member of the abd moving group .",
    "it is also important to comment on the distance to this star .",
    "as mentioned in section 3.2 and section 5 , this star does not have a hipparcos parallax estimate , therefore the distance is from torres et al .",
    "this distance estimate assumes that bd-04 1063 is a member of abd . with this vital criteria in question",
    ", we found a previous distance estimate to this star which uses photometric data to calculate a distance of 61 pc ( cutispoto et al .",
    "this is a much closer distance than the 78 pc given in torres et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and when applied , changes the radius and mass estimates to 0.83 r@xmath9 and 0.58 m@xmath9 respectively .",
    "the closer distance also lowers the luminosity to 0.59 l@xmath9 and allows the star to fall along the same isochrone as the rest of abd .    _",
    "bd-15 200 _ : the ba13 study also analyzed this star using high resolution spectroscopy and found nearly identical fundamental parameters and chemical composition .",
    "this star has a very similar surface gravity , radius , mass , and lithium abundance to the rest of the moving group , however , its chemical composition is slightly askew .",
    "it has a much larger metallicity ( [ m / h ] = 0.03 ) as compared to the rest of the cluster .",
    "in addition , this star diverges from the abd orbit around 100 myr which could be a sign that this is a younger , more enriched star associated with the same molecular cloud .    _",
    "bd+23 296 a _ : this star is the most enigmatic of our sample .",
    "it has a relatively close k4 binary companion with a separation of @xmath29 and is labeled in simbad as a giant type star , even though its temperature coupled with membership in abd should place it on the zams .",
    "casagrande et al . ( 2011 ) computed the age of this star using main sequence evolutionary models and found an age of 13.8 gyr .",
    "the giant status is seen in figure [ iso_paper ] where the star is lifted off of the ms , making it appear much younger .",
    "apart from its position on the hrd , its surface gravity , chemical composition , and traceback are consistent with other abd members .",
    "we therefore believe this elevation is due to its k4 companion or an unresolved companion adding flux , an incorrect parallax , or some combination of the two .    _",
    "bd+41 4749 _ : this star follows nearly every trend in abd except the ktb where it deviates quite drastically from the rest of the group .",
    "this is likely attributed to its low u velocity and low rv ( -19 km s@xmath3 ) , causing the epicyclic frequency to be different from other stars in the subsample .",
    "due to its similarities with other members in age , chemical composition , and mass and radius , we are hesitant to demote this star from membership , though we note its peculiar space motion and origin .    _",
    "bd-09 1034 _ : like bd-04 1063 , this star does not have a hipparcos distance estimate and instead we use the torres et al .",
    "( 2008 ) distance which assumes membership in abd .",
    "membership appears to be a valid assumption since the stars surface gravity and chemical abundance , tests which are independent of distance , match with the majority of our sample . to ensure this distance estimate is reasonable",
    ", we estimated the distance to this star by assuming its radius is the same as 3 other abd stars in the sample with temperatures @xmath05550 k ( bd+41 4749 , is eri , and v577 per a ) . using the average radius of 0.80 r@xmath9",
    ", we calculated the luminosity and m@xmath16 , added the bc@xmath16 , and found that for v = 9.98 , the distance is 78 pc .",
    "this is slightly closer than the torres et al .",
    "( 2008 ) estimate of 88 pc .",
    "the corresponding mass estimate is 0.70 m@xmath9 .",
    "_ comparison to ba13 _ : this work and the ba13 study are complimentary to one another .",
    "only one star overlaps both samples , yet many of the same results for the chemical analysis and kinematics were found in both studies , including nearly identical metal abundances for each abd sample ( [ m / h ] = 0.01 ) .",
    "in addition to the large scale results , several smaller trends exist between the two studies .",
    "first , in ba13 there are 5 stars with [ fe / h ] = -0.04 or -0.03 and 3 stars with [ fe / h ] = 0.02 , 0.05 , and 0.06 ( with [ fe / h ] = 0.06 corresponding to bd-15 200 ) .",
    "apart from probable systematic differences , this matches the 8 stars in our sample with [ fe / h ] between -0.01 and 0.01 and 1 star with [ fe / h ] = 0.07 .",
    "therefore , in table [ chemba13 ] we build a sample of chemically coherent stars in abd using both studies as well as highlight the outliers .",
    "in addition , bd-03 4778 from the ba13 study has a surface gravity and chemical composition ( log(g ) = 4.31 , [ fe / h ] = -0.09 ) which looks similar to bd-04 1063 ( log(g ) = 4.37 , [ fe / h ] = -0.08 ) .",
    "this could be an indicator that bd-03 4778 is also not truly a member of abd .",
    "we have investigated 10 proposed members of the abd stream to identify bulk characteristics of the moving group so that in the future , these will be used in conjunction with other techniques such as x - ray emission , li depletion , and h@xmath5 emission to classify whether future proposed members belong in the moving group . using tgvit and moog together ,",
    "these stars have precise spectroscopic parameters ( t@xmath1 , log(g ) , [ fe / h ] , @xmath31 ) along with radii , spectroscopic masses , and chemical abundances .",
    "we also find that @xmath23>$ ] = -0.03 @xmath4 0.06 , consistent with previous results ( biazzo et al .",
    "2012 , ba13 ) , suggesting this is characteristic of abd as a whole .",
    "along with other recent age estimates , our results verify that abd falls along the 100 myr isochrone and traces back to 125 myr . after investigating three different evolutionary models ,",
    "we have found the yrec models to best fit our observational data .",
    "our method has shown bd-04 1063 is most likely not a member of the moving group based on surface gravity , chemical composition , and position on the hr diagram .",
    "our findings also confirm the ba13 results for the fundamental parameters and chemical composition of bd-15 200 ( hd 6569 ) , and it is possible this is a younger star in the abd moving group . finally , bd+23 296 a has an odd placement on the hrd which is likely due to a companion ( either known or unresolved ) or incorrect parallax estimate .",
    "the overall procedure presented in the work is a valuable tool for analyzing other , younger moving groups .",
    "however , to truly utilize this procedure , we will compile another line list which allows the investigation of faster rotating stars ( vsin(i ) @xmath0 30 km s@xmath3 ) as younger groups have not had enough time to spin down .",
    "in fact , eggenberger et al . (",
    "2012 ) showed that once the debris disk evaporate from a star , angular momentum from the still collapsing core is able to spin up the surface of the star .",
    "this effect makes the youngest available moving groups ( e.g. tw hydrae and @xmath32 pictoris ) more difficult to analyze as they have recently left their disk - locking phase and have large vsin(i ) .",
    "we therefore find it important to future characterization of younger moving groups to find a robust line list capable of this analysis .",
    "these young moving groups are pivotal for constraining pms evolutionary models .",
    "as mentioned briefly in section 6 , there is large variance in ages and masses between pms evolutionary models and with upwards of 10 models available , large inconsistencies arise in the literature .",
    "we are currently observing many nearby clusters with varying ages to begin constraining the models in the f , g , and early k spectral regime .",
    "this type of constraint can be achieved using the procedure outlined in sections 3.1 and 3.2 of this work by finding spectroscopic masses for several stars in a gambit of moving groups and observing how stars of the same mass evolve as a function of age .",
    "abd already places constraints on where the main sequence should begin , however , this is only a small part of a larger picture .",
    "we are grateful for the observational assistance provided by david doss at the mcdonald observatory .",
    "we would also like to thank josh schlieder for constructive criticism and ideas and jennifer johnson for her expertise in moog .",
    "we also thank the anonymous referee for a thorough read of the manuscript as well as suggestions which improved the paper .",
    "in order to calculate the covariance between the stellar parameters , we used the bootstrap method outlined in section 3.1 and found the covariant terms using :      where @xmath34 is the covariance between t and logg .",
    "we then follow the outline of johnson et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , particularly equation ( 2 ) , to find total errors in the parameters . for temperature and mictroturbulence , it was necessary to find the logarithmic uncertainty and convert back to the original units to avoid scaling effects .",
    "a sample equation is      where @xmath36 is the log form or the errors assigned in table 1 . for the star bd+23 296 a , the random temperature errors are @xmath4 32 k which corresponds to a logarithmic temperature error of 2.624 * 10@xmath37 dex .",
    "the total covariant error sums up to 3.447 * 10@xmath38 and only effects the uncertainty by 0.04 k and we therefore deem this as insignificant .",
    "the largest covariant uncertainty was found in logg with an error of 0.00235 dex , still below the threshold to make any significant contribution to the random error .",
    "therefore , tgvit produces highly uncorrelated parameters since it varies temperature and surface gravity simultaneously .",
