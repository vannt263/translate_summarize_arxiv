    "the bunimovich stadium @xmath1 is a planar domain given by the union of a rectangle @xmath17 , \\",
    "y \\in [ -\\beta,\\beta ] \\}$ ] with two `` wings , '' i.e. the two semicircular regions centered at @xmath18 with radius @xmath19 which lie outside @xmath4 .",
    "geodesic flow in @xmath1 ( obeying the law of reflection at the boundary ) was proved to be ergodic by bunimovich @xcite .",
    "it follows from this and from results of schnirelman @xcite , zelditch @xcite and colin de verdire @xcite that the stadium is quantum ergodic .",
    "this means that there is a density one sequence of dirichlet eigenfunctions which becomes uniformly distributed ; in particular , along this density one sequence the weak limit of the @xmath8 mass distribution becomes uniform .",
    "one can ask whether the entire sequence of eigenfunctions becomes uniformly distributed ; if so , the domain is called quantum unique ergodic ( que )",
    ". it has been conjectured by rudnick and sarnak that complete surfaces with negative curvature which are classically ergodic are que ; this has been proved recently by lindenstrauss @xcite for arithmetic surfaces .",
    "the bunimovich stadium , by contrast , is generally believed to be non - que ; it is thought that there is a sequence of eigenfunctions that concentrates in the rectangle @xmath4 .",
    "little is currently understood about the way in which such eigenfunctions would concentrate , however",
    ". for example their ( hypothetical ) rate of decay outside @xmath4 is unclear .",
    "the result in the present paper is intended to shed some light on this question : we show that any sequence of eigenfunctions ( or quasimodes ) can not concentrate very rapidly inside @xmath4 , by obtaining lower bounds ( tending to zero as @xmath20 , but only polynomially ) on the @xmath8 mass inside the wings @xmath21 .",
    "let @xmath22 denote the ( nonnegative ) laplacian on @xmath1 with dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "we denote by @xmath23 the norm in @xmath24 , and by @xmath25 the outward pointing normal derivative of @xmath26 at @xmath27 we consider a @xmath11 dirichlet quasimode @xmath0 for @xmath28 , by which we mean that we have a sequence @xmath29 of real numbers and a corresponding sequence @xmath30 satisfying @xmath31 where @xmath32 we more generally define a @xmath33 or @xmath34 quasimode by modifying the right - hand side of accordingly .",
    "of course a sequence of eigenfunctions is a @xmath34 quasimode for any @xmath35 .",
    "it is easy to see that a @xmath36 quasimode can be localized to a small rectangle of the form @xmath37 \\times [ -\\beta , \\beta]$ ] , where @xmath37 $ ] is an arbitrary subinterval of @xmath38 $ ] ; indeed the family @xmath39 is ( after normalization ) such a quasimode , where @xmath40 is any nonzero smooth function supported in @xmath37 $ ] . by constrast , an @xmath11 quasimode can not be so localized : burq - zworski @xcite have shown that the @xmath8 norm of @xmath0 is controlled by ( that is , bounded above by a constant times ) its @xmath8 norm in the union of any two rectangles of the form @xmath41 \\times [ -\\beta , \\beta ] ) \\cup ( [ \\gamma_2 , \\alpha ] \\times [ -\\beta , \\beta])$ ] .",
    "in particular , for a @xmath11 quasimode , the @xmath8 mass can not shrink to a closed region disjoint from the wings of the stadium as @xmath6 .",
    "although the stadium is classically ergodic , there is a codimension one invariant set for the classical flow , consisting of vertical `` bouncing ball '' orbits parallel to the @xmath42-axis and within the rectangle @xmath4 , and the union of these orbits is the most likely place where localization of eigenfunctions , or more generally @xmath11 quasimodes , can occur .",
    "there is a rather convincing plausibility argument in the physics literature due to heller and oconnor @xcite which indicates that a density - zero sequence of eigenfunctions , with eigenvalues @xmath43 , does concentrate to some extent at these bouncing - ball orbits .",
    "the rigorous essence of this argument has been developed by donnelly @xcite who showed that there are sequences of functions lying in the range of spectral projectors @xmath44 , where @xmath45 are intervals of the form @xmath46 $ ] which concentrate at the bouncing - ball orbits . on the other hand",
    ", the result of burq - zworski @xcite shows that such localization can not be too extreme : the control region must extend to the boundary of the rectangle .",
    "our main result here is that we may in fact push our control region outside the rectangle altogether and into the wings , in return for a loss , either from restriction to the boundary , or of powers of @xmath47 to state this concisely , it is convenient to introduce an auxiliary coordinate in the wings given by @xmath48 thus @xmath15 is nonnegative on the wings and vanishes exactly on the vertical lines @xmath49    [ ourtheorem ] there is a @xmath50 , depending only on @xmath51 , such that any family @xmath0 satisfying obeys the estimates @xmath52 @xmath53 and @xmath54    therefore , if @xmath0 is a @xmath11 quasimode , we have for sufficiently large @xmath55 @xmath56 while if @xmath0 is a @xmath10 quasimode ( e.g.  an eigenfunction ) , @xmath57    note that the results of theorem  [ ourtheorem ] still leave open the possibility of quasimodes concentrated along bouncing - ball orbits in the rectangle with @xmath11 mass in the wings .",
    "they also do not rule out the possibility that all the energy in the wings may asymptotically concentrate in a boundary layer near @xmath58",
    "our main tool is positive commutator estimates , which we use in the following form :    [ lemma : rellich ] let @xmath59 be real , equal to zero at @xmath60 and satisfy @xmath61 where @xmath62 is smooth .",
    "then for any real vector field @xmath63 , @xmath64u \\rangle   =    \\langle ( 2 au+ ( { \\operatorname{div}}a ) u , f \\rangle + \\int_{{{\\partial}}s } ( \\partial_n u ) au \\ , dl .",

    "we also record here an inequality that will be of use in estimating derivative terms .",
    "[ lemma : gradientestimate ] let @xmath67 @xmath62 be as in lemma  [ lemma : rellich ] .",
    "then for all @xmath68 for @xmath55 sufficiently large , @xmath69    we compute @xmath70 applying cauchy - schwarz to @xmath71 gives the estimate .",
    "it suffices to prove under the assumption that @xmath0 , and hence @xmath72 , are real , since we can treat the real and imaginary parts separately .",
    "we make this assumption from now on .",

    "of course @xmath80 annihilates @xmath77 now since @xmath81 is tangent to the upper and bottom sides of the rectangle we find that the boundary integral in is only over @xmath82 moreover , as @xmath81 is tangent to the top and bottom of the circles forming the boundaries of the wings , we have @xmath83 on @xmath84 hence we have shown that @xmath85 we may absorb the @xmath86 term , then apply the poincar inequality , and absorb the @xmath87 to obtain @xmath88 which is the first part of our theorem , as we took @xmath59 to be @xmath8-normalized .      to prove this estimate we start from @xmath89 which follows directly from the considerations of the previous section , and estimate the boundary integral term .",
    "we    shall obtain upper bounds of the form @xmath90 and @xmath91 thus proving and .    we shall perform this estimate in three separate regions in the wing .",
    "region i is the near - rectangular region , in a boundary layer where @xmath92 region ii will be outside the boundary layer , where @xmath93 region iii will be the far outer region @xmath94    ]    we begin with region iii , far away from the rectangle . in this case",
    "we employ lemma  [ lemma : rellich ] where @xmath63 is the operator @xmath95 , where @xmath40 is supported where @xmath96 , say , equal to @xmath97 where @xmath98 , and with @xmath99 . then gives us , with @xmath100 $ ]",
    ", @xmath101 note that @xmath102 . thus the lhs is bounded ( @xmath103 ) by @xmath104 ( where of course @xmath105 depends on @xmath106 ) .",
    "we can add the positive term @xmath107 to this estimate .",
    "integrating by parts in @xmath42 gives us @xmath108 using the positivity of the integrand , we thus obtain an estimate @xmath109 with @xmath105 depending on @xmath110    now we work on region i , within a @xmath111 boundary layer along the rectangle .",
    "we again apply lemma  [ lemma : rellich ] , this time with @xmath112 since @xmath63 is a tangential vector plus a positive multiple of @xmath113 all along @xmath114 we obtain @xmath115u\\rangle } \\right\\rvert } } + 2 { { \\left\\lvert { \\langle u , f \\rangle } \\right\\rvert}}+ 2 { { \\left\\lvert{{{\\left\\langle{au , f}\\right\\rangle}}}\\right\\rvert}}.\\ ] ] using @xmath116 = 2\\delta$ ] and cauchy - schwarz this becomes @xmath117 restricting to @xmath118 in the integrand , we can estimate @xmath15 in @xmath119 by @xmath120 , and this gives @xmath121 using lemma  [ lemma : gradientestimate ] , we may estimate @xmath122 by @xmath123 .",
    "hence we may finally write @xmath124 note that in the above construction , @xmath125 can in fact be chosen independent of @xmath126    finally , we estimate in region ii . to begin with",
    ", we note that for @xmath127 , we can estimate @xmath128 by @xmath129 , so we have @xmath130 here we take @xmath131 supported in @xmath132 , and equal to @xmath133 for @xmath134 and @xmath135 for @xmath136 , so that @xmath137 is a positive multiple of @xmath113 plus a tangential component on @xmath138 to estimate further , we employ lemma  [ lemma : rellich ] with the commutant @xmath139 the point of this commutant is that we have given ourselves two powers of @xmath15 which will `` absorb '' two integrations by parts in @xmath140 _ without any boundary terms at @xmath141 _ ; this is crucial since we know of no way to deal with such boundary terms .",
    "( on the other hand , we pay the price of additional powers of @xmath55 with this gambit . )",
    "thus we obtain , setting @xmath142 $ ] , @xmath143 we can estimate the second term on the rhs by @xmath144 .",
    "now consider the terms involving the operator @xmath145 .",
    "this is given by @xmath146 where @xmath147 is the heaviside step - function , @xmath148 for @xmath149 and @xmath97 for @xmath150 .",
    "to treat the terms involving one derivative , e.g. the third term above , we integrate by parts : @xmath151 which is therefore estimated by @xmath152 .",
    "the fourth term is estimated in exactly the same way .",
    "thus we are left to estimate @xmath153 integrating the first term by parts in @xmath140 and the second term by parts in @xmath42 gives us two principal terms @xmath154 together with two other terms @xmath155 which are estimated in the same way as the first order terms above .",
    "we apply cauchy - schwarz to the first term in , while in the second term , which is positive , we replace @xmath156 by @xmath128 ( which is larger , up to a constant multiple ) and then integrate by parts again , getting ( up to another first - order term estimated as above ) an upper bound for of the form @xmath157 now we integrate by parts again , getting @xmath158 writing @xmath159 , we can estimate the integrand of by @xmath160 hence we may estimate , by as @xmath161    the term @xmath162 is bounded in a similar manner : by cauchy - schwarz we may estimate it by @xmath163 or by @xmath164 as we prefer .",
    "our estimate for turns the latter estimate into @xmath165 on the other hand , treating @xmath166 in the same manner gives a bound by @xmath167    on the support of @xmath131 and at the boundary , @xmath168 is a positive multiple of @xmath169 .",
    "so the upshot is that now gives @xmath170 and @xmath171    at last we can estimate the boundary integral term in by a combination of , , and / , obtaining @xmath172 and @xmath173 here @xmath105 depends on @xmath174 @xmath175 but @xmath125 is independent of @xmath126 we now combine this with . absorbing the @xmath176 and @xmath177 terms on the lhs by taking @xmath175 and",
    "@xmath106 sufficiently small , we obtain , .",
    "the estimates presented here are certainly not optimal . the powers of @xmath55 appearing in theorem  [ ourtheorem ]",
    "can probably be improved using refinements of the methods used here , but it seems unlikely that one could achieve an optimal result with them .",
    "we have not , therefore , attempted to obtain the best possible powers of @xmath55 , but have rather tried to present a poynomial lower bound on @xmath178 with a simple proof .",
    "it would be of great interest to obtain a polynomial lower bound on the @xmath8 mass of @xmath0 in a subregion of @xmath5 which is a positive distance from @xmath4 ( i.e. region iii of the previous section ) .",
    "we do not know whether such a bound holds , but it does not seem to be obtainable using the methods of this paper ; possibly it might yield to the use of more sophisticated tools from microlocal analysis ."
