    "the atlas muon spectrometer consists of a system of superconducting air - core toroid coils generating a magnetic field delivering field integrals of about 2.5  tm in the barrel part and up to 7  tm in the end caps .",
    "the muon trajectories in the muon spectrometer are measured with three layers of so - called monitored drift - tube ( mdt ) chambers whose shapes and relative positions are monitored by a system of optical sensors with micrometer accuracy .",
    "the mdt chambers are built of two quadruple layers of cylindrical drift tubes in the innermost layer and of two triple layers of drift tubes in the remaining two layers .",
    "the tubes have an outer diameter of 30  mm and a 400  @xmath3 m thick tube walls made of aluminium .",
    "they are filled with a gas mixture of argon and carbon dioxide in the mixing ratio of 93:7 at an absolute pressure of 3  bar .",
    "the anode wire of 50  @xmath3 m diameter is set to a voltage of 3080  v with respect to the tube walls leading to a gas gain of 20,000 and an average spatial single - tube resolution better than 100  @xmath3 m .",
    "this corresponds to a spatial resolution of the chambers of better than 40  @xmath3 m as required for 10% momentum resolution at 1  tev / c @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field in the muon spectrometer is non - uniform , also within the muon chambers .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath4 influences the electron drift inside the tubes : the maximum drift time @xmath5  ns increases by approximately 70  @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath4 varies by up to @xmath7  t along the tubes of chambers mounted near the magnet coils which translates into a variation of @xmath8 with an amplitude of 45  ns @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the space drift - time relationship must be taken into account in track reconstruction .",
    "test - beam measurements presented in this article were needed to model this dependence with the required accuracy of 1  ns @xcite .",
    "the operating conditions of the mdt chambers at the lhc design luminosity of 10@xmath9  @xmath10s@xmath11 are characterized by unprecedentedly high neutron and much higher @xmath0 background fluxes .",

    "the choice of the ar : co@xmath12 gas mixture and the use of silicon free components in the gas system prevents the mdt chambers from aging @xcite .",
    "the high radiation background is known to degrade the spatial resolution of the tubes and the muon detection efficiency .",
    "the performance of the drift tubes at high @xmath0 irradiation background was studied with single tubes and preliminary read - out electronics for the first time in the late 1990s @xcite .",
    "measurements with a large standard mdt chamber and the final read - out electronics could only be performed in 2003 @xcite ; these measurements are consistent with the earlier measurements using single tubes .",
    "they were followed up by measurements of the drift - tube behaviour in magnetic fields in 2004 @xcite .",
    "the present article summarizes the studies published in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite and extends them by detailed comparisons of the measurements with predictions of the garfield drift chamber simulation programme @xcite .",
    "the measurements discussed in this article were made at the gamma irradiation facility ( gif ) at cern @xcite which provided a 90 gev muon beam and a 664  gbq @xmath13cs source emitting 66  kev @xmath0 rays used to simulate the atlas radiation background .",
    "the flux of @xmath0 rays to which the drift tubes were exposed during the measurements could be adjusted with movable lead filters in front of the opening of the source .",
    "two experimental set - ups were installed in the gif , one in 2003 , the other in 2004  see figures  [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] .",

    "a small bundle of short drift tubes is mounted on a rotation table in the middle of the beam hodoscope inside a large dipole magnet .",
    "a bundle of 3.8  m long drift tubes is installed in front of the source outside the magnet for high - rate studies . ]",
    "the beam hodoscope consists of two times three silicon strip detectors of 5@xmath145  @xmath15 active area 60  cm apart .",
    "each of the four inner strip detectors measures the lateral positions of the incident muons with 10  @xmath3 m accuracy .",
    "the two outermost detector planes measure the vertical muon positions with the same accuracy . in 2004",
    "one of these vertical detectors had to be turned off due to very high leakage currents .",
    "the beam hodoscope is enclosed by two fast scintillation counters with the same active area as the silicon detectors .",
    "a coincidence of these two counters with a 10@xmath1410  @xmath16 scintillator counter mounted upstream in the beam and protected from the radiation of the @xmath0 source provides the trigger and the start time for the drift - time measurements in the tubes .",
    "the jitter of the trigger time of less than 0.5  ns is negligible with respect to the time resolution of the drift tubes of about 3  ns .    in 2003",
    "one of the largest atlas mdt chambers was operated in the gif with final read - out electronics .",
    "this chamber contains 432 tubes of 3.8  m length in two triple layers separated by 317  mm .",
    "it was installed at 2  m distance from the radioactive source . in the final mdt chamber",
    "read - out scheme each drift tube is connected to a chain of an amplifier , shaper , and discriminator @xcite capacitively coupled to the sense wire . a time - to - digital converter measures",
    "the arrival times of the signal with respect to the trigger time for each tube in a group of 24 .",
    "bipolar shaping is used with at peaking time of 15  ns .",
    "the discriminator threshold is adjustable and set to a value corresponding to 5 times the thermal noise created by the 383  @xmath17 termination resistor on the high - voltage side of the tubes .",
    "the pulse heights of the signals are measured by an analog - to - digital converter in each of the 24 channels .",
    "bipolar shaping was chosen in order to avoid baseline shifts of the analog signals caused by multiple hits in the presence of high radiation background in the atlas muon spectrometer .",
    "a consequence of bipolar shaping are multiple threshold crossings of the discriminator threshold .",
    "the secondary threshold crossings can be masked by an artificial dead time of 790  ns after the detected hit @xcite .",
    "this is the baseline for the operation in atlas at the lhc .",
    "the dead time is adjustable between 200  ns and 790  ns .",
    "while we used the baseline value of 790  ns in 2003 , we also used the minimum dead time of 200  ns in 2004 .    in 2004 a bundle of 24 3.8  m long drift tubes was installed at 1.5  m distance from the source to study the drift tube performance with the minimum dead time of the electronics .",
    "the other important goal of the 2004 test - beam programme was the precision measurement of the influence of the magnetic field on the space drift - time relationship of the tubes .",
    "for this measurement , a chamber with 3@xmath143 15  cm long atlas drift tubes in the middle of the beam hodoscope was operated in a 0 - 0.9  t dipole field measured with a hall probe on the chamber .",
    "the orientation of the magnetic field vector @xmath18 with respect to the direction of the anode wires of the tubes could be changed by rotating the chamber inside the magnet .",
    "in this section , the space drift - time relationship , the spatial resolution , the pulse - height spectra , and the drift - tube efficiency will be discussed for the operation of the mdt chambers in the absence of @xmath0 radiation background .",
    "we first present our studies for the operation without magnetic field and then the analysis of the measurements with magnetic field .      throughout the analysis muon trajectories",
    "are reconstructed with the data of the beam hodoscope independently of the muon chambers .",
    "the high spatial resolution of the silicon strip detector planes of the hodoscope leads to a precise knowledge of the muon position inside the drift tubes with a resolution much better than the spatial resolution of the drift tubes .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the drift time measured by a tube traversed by the muons as a function of the distance of the reconstructed hodoscope trajectory from the anode wire of the tube .",
    "most of the data points populate a dark band whose contour reflects the space drift - time relationship .",
    "the space drift - time relationship is approximately linear for radii less than 5  mm with an average drift velocity of 0.05  mmns@xmath11 .",
    "the drift velocity drops continously with increasing radius above 5  mm and has a mean value of about 0.017  mmns@xmath11 there .",
    "the width of the dark band is a measure for the drift time resolution which is of the order of a couple of nanoseconds .",
    "7% of the data points lie below the dark band .",
    "these entries are caused by @xmath19 electrons which are knocked out of the tube walls by the incident muons leading to hit times before the muon hits .",

    "we begin the detailed analysis of the data with a comparison of the measured space drift - time relationship to the prediction of the drift - chamber simulation programme `` garfield '' .",
    "we use garfield versions 8 and 9 . the main and most important difference between the two versions",
    "are the cross sections for the collisions of the drifting electrons with the carbon dioxide molecules in the chamber gas . in the cross sections provided to garfield-8 by",
    "the magboltz-2 programme @xcite rotational excitations of co@xmath12 molecules by impinging electroncs are neglected .",
    "they are taken into account by magboltz-7 @xcite used in garfield-9 .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows the deviation of the measured space drift - time relationship @xmath20 from the space drift - time relationships predicted by the two garfield versions as a function of the distance of the muon trajectory from the anode wire .",
    "the prediction by garfield-9 agreed with the measured space drift - time relationship on the level on 1  ns .",
    "garfield-8 , however , predicts a too small drift velocity for the electroncs leading to deviations @xmath21 of up to 8  ns at large radii .",
    "this is caused by the underestimation of the electron - co@xmath12 cross section due to the neglection of rotational excitations of the co@xmath12 molecules whose energy levels are of the same order as the kinetic energy of the drifting electrons .",
    "one can make the garfield-8 prediction match the measured space drift - time relationship by increasing the co@xmath12 content from its correct value of 7% to 7.08% . yet also after this tuning garfield-8 fails to correctly describe the magnetic - field dependence of the space drift - time relationship as we shall see in the next section .",

    "unless stated otherwise , garfield-9 is used in the analysis of our test - beam data from now on .    before investigating the spatial resolution of the drift tubes",
    "we shall briefly discuss the drift velocity of the electrons .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows the electron drift velocity as a function of @xmath23 as obtained by differantiating the nineth order polynomial fitter to the contour of the dark band in figure  [ fig3 ] . as mentioned above , the drift velocity is about 0.05  mmns@xmath11 for @xmath24  mm .",
    "it has a minimum at @xmath25  mm which is caused by the so - called ramsauer minimum in the cross section for the elastic scattering of electrons on argon atoms .",
    "the drift velocity decreases with increasing radius for @xmath26  mm . on the right hand side of figure  [ fig5 ]",
    "we plot @xmath27 as a function of @xmath23 to illustrated the radial dependence of the drift velocity @xmath28 : @xmath27 is rising linearly for @xmath29 $ ] reflecting that @xmath28 can be approximated by a constant . at larger radii @xmath27 is roughly constant which is equivalent to the statement that @xmath30 for @xmath26  mm to certain approximation .",

    "we define the spatial resolution of the drift tube at a given radius @xmath33 as the standard deviation of the normal distribution fitted to the @xmath34 distribution where @xmath35 denotes the drift radius measured by the tube and @xmath33 is given by the beam hodoscope .",
    "to prevent @xmath19  electron hits from spoiling the fit a cut on @xmath36  mm is applied before the fit .",

    "a better understanding of the shape of the spatial resolution @xmath37 can be obtained by comparing it to the garfield predictions .",
    "the results of this comparison become more intuitive when one looks at the drift - time resolution @xmath41 which is related to the spatial resolution by the equation @xmath42 , @xmath43 being the drift velocity of the electrons in the ar : co@xmath12 gas mixture .",
    "comparison of the measured drift - time resolution with garfield predictions . a discriminator threshold corresponding to 11 times the signal of a single primary electron is used in the garfield simulation .",
    "the noise level in the simulation is set to @xmath44 of the threshold . ]",
    "figure  [ fig7 ] contains three time - resolution curves calculated with garfield .",
    "the open circles show the resolution which is obtained when diffusion in the electron drift and noise are turned off in the simulation programme , but a gas gain of 20,000 is applied .",
    "the time resolution improves significantly with increasing distance of the muon track from the anode wire for @xmath45  mm and saturates to a constant value for @xmath46  mm .",
    "this behaviour can be explained by a simple geometrical model in combination with the radial dependence of the drift velocity of the electrons .",
    "the discriminator threshold is set to a value corresponding to the signal of @xmath47 primary electrons .",
    "so the drift - time fluctuation is caused by the fluctuation of the arrival times of the @xmath48 primary electron at the anode wire .",
    "let @xmath49 be the mean muon track length between @xmath50 primary ionizations .",
    "then the @xmath48 primary electron travels the distance @xmath51 the actual distance between @xmath50 primary ionizations fluctuates around the mean value @xmath49 by @xmath52 .",
    "hence the distance the @xmath48 primary electrons drifts fluctuates by @xmath53 from one muon track to the other .",
    "the fluctuation of the arrival times of the @xmath48 primary electrons is given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 has been approximated by @xmath23 .",
    "the drift velocity @xmath43 is constant for @xmath56  mm to good approximation , so @xmath57 falls off like @xmath58 .",
    "@xmath59 is proportional to @xmath58 for @xmath60  mm making @xmath57 a constant .",

    "the garfield prediction of the most probable charge measurement at a given radius presented in figure  [ fig8 ] shows such a behaviour when diffusion is turned off .",
    "diffusion enlarges the spread of the arrival times of the primary electrons for large drift distances . as a consequence",
    "less primary electrons arrive at the anode wire within the adc gate and the measured charge decreases with increasing radius for @xmath76  mm",

    "the dependence of the deviations of the measured drift times from the expected drift times @xmath78 on the ratio @xmath85 shown in figure  [ fig9 ] exhibits the predicted linear dependence of the time walk on the ratio @xmath85 .",

    "the spatial resolution obtained with the time - slewing correction is compared to the spatial resolution without time - slewing corrections in figure  [ fig10 ] .",
    "the time - slewing correction improves the spatial resolution at all track impact radii , by about 50  @xmath3 m at small radii , by about 10  @xmath3 m at large radii ( reflecting the decrease of the drift velocity with increasing radius ) .",

    "we close this section with the measurement of the muon detection efficiency of the tubes .",
    "we distinguish two kinds of efficiencies : ( 1 ) the tube efficiency is defined as the probability that a tubes gives a hit when traversed by a muon within the sensitive volume of the tube ( @xmath86  mm ) .",
    "( 2 ) the 3@xmath87  efficiency requires in addition that the drift time associated with the the hit corresponds to a radius @xmath35 which agrees with the track distance @xmath33 from the anode wire of the tube within 3 times the spatial resolution at @xmath33 .",
    "the measurement of both quantities is presented in figure  [ fig11 ] .",
    "the tube efficiency is 100% for radii less than 14.2  mm .",
    "it drops to 0 from 14.2  mm to 14.6  mm radial distance because of the decreasing number of primary ionization electrons as a consequence of the decreasing muon track length in the gas volume .",
    "the overall 3@xmath87  efficiency is only 93% .",
    "it is lower than the tube efficiency due to the @xmath19  electrons knocked out of the tube wall by the impinging muon and passing the wire at a smaller distance than the muon .",
    "the 3@xmath87  efficiency drops with increasing track impact radius because of the rising probability of a @xmath19  electron hit masking a muon hit .",
    "a part of the masked muon hits can be recovered by operating the read - out electronics at the minimum dead time of 200  ns and considering second hits . as the drift time",

    "so far we have discussed the operation of the mdt chambers in regions of no magnetic fields as is the case in the end caps of the muon spectrometer . in the barrel part of the muon spectrometer ,",
    "however , the chambers are operated in a magnetic field of about 0.5  t. figure  [ fig12 ] shows a schematic of the field configuration in the barrel region of the muon spectrometer .",
    "the magnetic field produced by the superconducting coils is toroidal inside the coils and very non - uniform outside the coils .",

    "the acceleration @xmath95 of the electrons is small compared to the electric pull @xmath96 such that the drift velocity equals @xmath97 to good approximation .",
    "the interpretation of equation ( [ eqn1 ] ) is that the electrons acquire their kinetic energy in between the collisions with the gas molecules or gas atoms by which they are slowed down .",
    "this interpretation indicates that the time between collisions or , equivalently , the collision rate can not be the only quantity determining the drift velocity besides the electric field . for assume that there were two different gases in which the electron s drift velocity at a given field were the same , but that in one of the two gases the collisions of the electrons with the gas molecules were purely elastic while in the other they were , at least partially , inelastic . in the second case the electrons would lose more energy in a single collision than in the first case . as a consequence ,",
    "less collisions lead to the observed drift velocity in the first second case than in the first case .",
