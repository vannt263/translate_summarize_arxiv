    "the determination of cluster masses has a long story ( see , e.g. * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "it dates back to @xcite s and @xcite s preliminary estimates of the masses of the coma and the virgo cluster .",
    "these early estimates were based on the virial theorem , using galaxies as unbiased tracers of the cluster potential ( i.e. the _ light traces mass _ hypothesis ) . @xcite and @xcite were among the first to point out that cluster masses were in fact poorly known , since relaxing the _ light traces mass _ assumption widens the range of allowed mass models considerably . however , the limited amount of redshift data made it very difficult , if not impossible , to constrain the relative distributions of cluster mass and cluster light .    with the advent of multi - object spectroscopy ,",
    "a large number of redshifts for cluster galaxies became available .",
    "in particular , the two main catalogs of redshifts of cluster galaxies became available , viz .",
    "the eso nearby abell cluster survey ( enacs , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , and the canadian network for observational cosmology ( cnoc , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "moreover , field galaxy surveys also contributed to increase the number of redshifts for cluster galaxies , in particular , the century survey @xcite , and the two degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter dp02 ) .",
    "these new data - bases prompted new more detailed investigations in the issue of the cluster mass determination . with a significant number of galaxy redshifts per cluster",
    ", it became possible to determine the cluster mass profile by solving the jeans equation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for the equilibrium of member galaxies in the cluster gravitational potential .",
    "often , several cluster samples have been combined to improve the statistics , by making the implicit assumption of cluster homology .    from the analysis of @xmath3 galaxies in the cnoc clusters , combined to form a single cluster ,",
    "@xcite concluded that galaxies trace the mass to within @xmath4% , and that the cluster mass profile is well described by a ( * ? ? ?",
    "* nfw hereafter ) profile , or by a @xcite profile .",
    "their results have substantially been confirmed by the more detailed analysis of ( * ? ? ? * hereafter vdm00 ) . found that the mass - to - light ratio is almost independent of radius , and the profile is an adequate fit to the data , but other density profiles are equally acceptable , depending on the orbital anisotropy of cluster galaxies . @xcite",
    "have recently applied the technique of @xcite to a sample of @xmath5 galaxies in @xmath6 groups from the cnoc2 .",
    "they found a strongly increasing mass - to - light ratio with radius , a result at variance with that found by @xcite .",
    "a detailed analysis of the mass and anisotropy profiles of clusters from enacs is ongoing ( katgert , biviano & mazure , in preparation ) .",
    "a new technique for the determination of cluster mass profiles has recently been introduced by @xcite and ( * ? ? ? * hereafter d99 ) .",
    "it is based on the determination of the amplitude of the caustics in the space of velocities and clustercentric radii .",
    "applications of this technique include @xcite s and @xcite s determination of the coma cluster mass profile out to 14 @xmath7 mpc , @xcite s determination of the mass profile of abell  576 out to 6 @xmath7 mpc , and @xcite s determination of the mass of the shapley supercluster .",
    "the profile was found to provide a consistent fit to the mass profiles .",
    "interestingly , @xcite found a decreasing mass - to - light profile in abell  576 while @xcite found a constant mass - to - light profile in coma .    from a theoretical point of view , both decreasing and increasing mass - to - light profiles have been predicted .",
    "a decreasing mass - to - light profile could result from the tidal stripping of galaxy halos in the cluster centers @xcite .",
    "an increasing mass - to - light profile could instead result from the combined effects of dynamical friction and galaxy merging @xcite .",
    "in general , galaxies are unlikely to be distributed exactly like the mass , if anything because different galaxy populations have different distributions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this paper",
    "we determine the mass profile of an ensemble cluster built from the combined data of 43 clusters extracted from the 2dfgrs @xcite , using the techniques described by and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also ) . since the 2dfgrs is a field survey , only a small fraction of the 2dfgrs galaxies are cluster members .",
    "our final sample contains 1345 cluster members only , a number comparable to that of cluster members in the cnoc and smaller than that of cluster members in the enacs .",
    "the main advantage of using the 2dfgrs for the determination of the cluster mass profile is the possibility of sampling the cluster dynamics to a large distance from the cluster center .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in   [ data ]",
    "we describe the data sample , how we assign the cluster membership and how we combine the 43 cluster data - sets into a single ensemble cluster . in ",
    "[ mprof ] we determine the ensemble cluster mass profile . in   [ mton ]",
    "we use this mass profile to determine the mass - to - number density profile . in   [ disc ]",
    "we discuss our results and compare them with previous determinations of cluster mass and mass - to - light profiles .",
    "finally , in   [ summ ] we present a summary of our results .",
    "a hubble constant of 100 @xmath8 km  s@xmath9mpc@xmath10 is used throughout .",
    "the data sample we use is the 2dfgrs public release version of june , 30@xmath11 , 2001 .",
    "it contains @xmath12 redshifts and spectral types as well as @xmath13 photometry for @xmath14 objects .",

    "we exclude those clusters whose central regions are not evenly sampled in the 2dfgrs public release , and those which , according to the authors themselves , have less than 20 members with redshifts in the 2dfgrs",
    ". of course , we also get rid of double entries in s list ( such as , e.g. , apm  309 which corresponds to aco  3062 ) .",

    "we apply the selection procedure of cluster members of @xcite and @xcite . first",
    ", we apply @xcite s one - dimensional algorithm based on the adaptive kernel technique ( see also appendix a of @xcite ) .",
    "the adaptive kernel technique is a nonparametric method for the evaluation of the density probability function underlying an observational discrete data set .",
    "the method returns a list of all density peaks detected , as well as their probabilities , and the objects associated to each peak .",
    "we apply this method to the velocity distribution of all galaxies projected within @xmath19 of each cluster center .",
    "we select as significant those peaks with @xmath20% probability . when adjacent peaks have 20% or more of their objects in common , we join them together if they are closer in velocity than 1500 km  s@xmath10 .",
    "when one peak is closer than 1500 km  s@xmath9to two other peaks , themselves separated by more than 1500 km  s@xmath10 , we join the central peak to the one which is closest , and leave the third peak separate .",
    "quite often , several significant density peaks are found in a single cluster region . among the significant peaks",
    ", we choose that one which is closest to the mean cluster velocity , as given by . in this way we avoid possible mis - identifications , since sometimes the search region around each cluster ( a circle of @xmath19 radius ) is wide enough to contain another cluster .",
    "we identify 75 clusters with a significant density peak in the velocity space and at least 20 galaxies associated to that peak . in one case ( aco - s1155 )",
    ", no significant peak is found , and in another 15 cases , there are less than 20 galaxies in the peak corresponding to the cluster .",
    "these 16 clusters are excluded from our sample .",
    "we re - define the centers of the 75 clusters .",
    "we define the new cluster center as the position of the highest density peak found with a two - dimensional adaptive kernel technique . in order to avoid mis - identifications",
    ", we only use galaxies less distant than 0.5 @xmath7 mpc @xmath21from the old cluster center listed by . using these new center determinations ,",
    "we apply the shifting - gap method @xcite to get rid of the remaining interlopers .",
    "the shifting - gap method makes use of both galaxy velocities and clustercentric distances .",
    "galaxies are sorted in order of increasing distance from their cluster centers . among samples of galaxies in ( overlapping and shifting ) bins of 0.4 @xmath7 mpc",
    "@xmath21from the cluster center ( or wide enough to contain @xmath22 galaxies each ) , gaps @xmath23 km  s@xmath9are identified in the galaxy velocity distribution .",
    "these gaps define the edges of the galaxy velocity distribution .",
    "outliers from this distribution are flagged as interlopers .",
    "having excluded the interlopers , we make a new estimate of the cluster mean velocities , @xmath24 s , and velocity dispersions , @xmath25 s , ( and hence @xmath26 s ) .",
    "the velocity moments are estimated with the robust methods of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) .",
    "velocity dispersions are corrected for the velocity errors and moved to the cluster rest - frames @xcite .",
    "these new @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 estimates are the starting values for an iterative procedure .",
    "we consider only the cluster members within a distance @xmath27 from the cluster center to recalculate @xmath24 and @xmath25 . if the difference between the new estimate of @xmath25 and the previous one is @xmath28% , the procedure is halted",
    "otherwise , we iterate , by recalculating @xmath24 and @xmath25 on the members within a distance of @xmath27 from the cluster center , where the new value of @xmath26 is used . with this iterative procedure ,",
    "we eliminate 7 of the initial 75 clusters , because they are left with less than 5 members within @xmath26 at any of the iteration steps .    with the new center and @xmath26 determinations",
    ", we then iterate the adaptive - kernel procedure and the shifting - gap method for the selection of cluster members .",
    "this time , we extend the search region to @xmath29 , in order to ensure that we will be covering a region of at least @xmath19 radius when the final definitive estimate of @xmath26 is done . on the selected galaxies",
    "we re - determine @xmath24 and @xmath25 via the iterative procedure described above .",
    "we are left with a sample of 67 clusters , after eliminating one because it contains less than 5 members within @xmath26 .    in order to determine the mass profile of galaxy clusters to sufficiently large distances , it is wise to exclude interacting clusters , whose dynamics is difficult to model .",
    "say @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 are , respectively , the mean velocity , velocity dispersion , and virial radius of cluster @xmath33 , and @xmath34 is the projected distance between the centers of clusters @xmath33 and @xmath35 ; we say cluster @xmath33 and cluster @xmath35 are interacting if the following two conditions apply : @xmath36 @xmath37 we eliminate 24 interacting clusters , and we are thus left with a sample of 43 reasonably isolated clusters",
    ".    before we can construct azimuthally averaged profiles , we must verify that the circular region of @xmath19 radius around each cluster center is fully covered in the 2dfgrs public release data sample .",
    "this is indeed the case for all the clusters in our sample , except two , apm  715 and aco  892 .",
    "for these two clusters we define an angular sector which excludes the region not covered in the 2dfgrs public release data sample , and we consider only the galaxies within this sector .    using a two - dimensional kolmogorov - smirnov test ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) we also verify that the spatial distributions of galaxies with and without redshifts are not significantly different , at least out to @xmath38 .",
    "there are only four clusters for which there is a marginal ( @xmath39% ) evidence of a difference : aco  957 , aco  1750 , aco  2734 , edcc  153 . for these clusters",
    "the redshift completeness is not homogeneous within @xmath19 , and decreases outside .",
    "only 9% ( respectively 2% ) of all the galaxies in our sample occupy regions where the completeness in redshift is significantly below ( respectively 50% ) the average completeness for their cluster .",
    "we therefore deem it unnecessary to correct for this incompleteness . in summary , thanks to the quality of the 2dfgrs , our final sample is almost unaffected by problems of radial incompleteness .",
    "our final sample contains 3602 field galaxies and 1345 cluster members with redshifts , within @xmath19 from the centers of 43 clusters .",
    "the absolute @xmath13 magnitudes of the 1345 cluster members , k - corrected as described by @xcite , range from @xmath40 to @xmath41 .",
    "the different clusters are sampled down to different absolute magnitude limits , since they lie at different redshifts , from a limiting @xmath41 in aco  s301 , to a limiting @xmath42 in apm  294 .",
    "the 43 clusters have an average @xmath25 of 490 km  s@xmath10 .",
    "this is significantly lower than the average @xmath25 estimated by for the same clusters , 776 km  s@xmath10 .",
    "interestingly , our velocity dispersion estimates and those of are significantly correlated ( 97% probability according to a spearman rank correlation test ) , which suggests that the difference in @xmath25 is systematic .",
    "we believe that s @xmath25 s are systematically overestimated , for the following reasons .",
    "first , s highest value of @xmath25 among the 43 clusters is 1620 km  s@xmath10 , higher than any of the @xmath25 values found in the complete cluster sample of @xcite . for comparison ,",
    "the hottest x - ray cluster known , 1e0657 - 56 , has a velocity dispersion of @xmath43 km  s@xmath10@xcite .",
    "second , s @xmath25-estimates are too large when compared to the cluster richnesses .",
    "this can be seen by considering the 27 aco clusters in our sample , whose average richness count is 41 .",
    "the 27 aco clusters have an average @xmath25 of 493 km  s@xmath10according to our analysis , or 822 km  s@xmath10according to .",
    "the former value is as expected on the basis of the cluster richness - velocity dispersion correlation @xcite , while the latter value is certainly too high .",
    "finally , our @xmath25-estimates are in better agreement than those of , with the values given in the literature for five of the 43 clusters @xcite .",
    "the mean difference between our @xmath25-estimates and those of the literature is @xmath44 km  s@xmath10 , that between s @xmath25-estimates and those of the literature is @xmath45 km  s@xmath10 .",
    "our cluster sample is presented in table  [ tabsample ] .",
    "we list in column ( 1 ) the cluster name ( as given in the list of ) , in columns ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) the coordinates of the cluster center , in column ( 4 ) the number of member galaxies within @xmath19 , in column ( 5 ) the number of member galaxies within @xmath26 , in column ( 6 ) the mean cluster velocity , and in column ( 7 ) the cluster velocity dispersion ( computed using the robust estimators of @xcite ) .",
    "in order to put significant constraints on the cluster mass profile we need a sufficiently large data - set .",
    "we therefore join together the 43 clusters into a single ensemble cluster . to this aim , we scale the projected distances of galaxies from their cluster centers , @xmath46 s , by @xmath26 ( see   [ data ] ) which is an approximate estimate of @xmath47 .",
    "we scale the line - of - sight velocities of the galaxies relative to the cluster mean velocity , @xmath48 , with the global velocity dispersions @xmath25 of their parent clusters .",

    "large dots indicate cluster members .",
    "it is easy to spot a few apparent outliers that have been classified as cluster members , mostly at large distances from the cluster center .",
    "these possible misidentifications are due to the difficulty of the shifting - gap procedure in rejecting interlopers in regions of low galaxy density . in order to avoid possible problems of wrong membership assignments",

    "the determination of the mass profile can in principle be obtained by a straightforward application of the jeans equation .",
    "a reasonable assumption must however be made on the orbital anisotropy of the tracers of the gravitational potential .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) . by excluding late - type spirals from our sample we are therefore confident that we can assume isotropic orbits for the remaining cluster galaxies . in order to exclude late - type spirals we impose an upper limit on the spectral type parameter provided by the 2dfgrs , @xmath49",
    "( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    as explained in",
    "  [ mprof ] , our membership assignment may not be very robust beyond @xmath26 .",
    "we therefore restrict the jeans analysis to the sample of cluster members with @xmath50 .",
    "additional motivations for this choice are :    * reducing the effect of possible anisotropies .",
    "in fact , galaxies infalling into a cluster are likely to lose their radial anisotropy when crossing the denser central regions @xcite . * reducing the influence of possible subclustering .",
    "in fact , the central cluster regions are a hostile environment for the survival of substructures @xcite . * satisfying the condition of dynamical equilibrium , needed for the application of the jeans equation .",
    "in fact , @xmath51 delimits the region of virialization .    in total",
    ", we have 642 cluster members with @xmath50 and @xmath52 .",
    "their distribution in the space of clustercentric distances and velocities is shown in figure  [ f - rvj ] ( bottom panel ) .",
    "their normalized velocity - distribution is not significantly different from a gaussian , according to a kolmogorov - smirnov test .",
    "this suggests that our assumption of isotropy is acceptable .",
    "we solve the jeans equation under the isotropic assumption for the sample of 642 cluster members .",
    "for this , we follow the method of @xcite and .    first , we determine the projected number density profile , @xmath53 of cluster members out to @xmath19 ( late - type spirals excluded ) with the maximum penalized likelihood ( mapeln ) method of @xcite .",
    "we fit the observed profile with a multi - parameter function of the form suggested by ( see eq.[2 ] in , and figure  [ f - ir ] ) .",

    ", we must rely on methods that do not assume the cluster dynamical equilibrium , since this is unlikely to hold in the external cluster regions .",
    "the method we use is that of @xcite and .",
    "these authors have shown that the velocity field in the cluster outskirts is determined by the cluster mass distribution , via @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the amplitude of the caustics described by the galaxy distribution in the space of normalized clustercentric distances and velocities , and @xmath92 is a function of the gravitational potential and the anisotropy profile .",
    "we determine the caustics with an adaptive kernel method , as described in ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite , we scale the smoothing - window sizes along the axes of clustercentric distance and velocities before applying the adaptive kernel method , in such a way as to give equal weights to the typical uncertainties of normalized clustercentric distances and velocities . in our sample",
    "the median velocity uncertainty is 90 km  s@xmath10 , or 0.2 in normalized units .",
    "the positional uncertainty of a galaxy is of the order of the galaxy size , i.e. about 20 @xmath7 kpc , or 0.02 in normalized units .",
    "we therefore take @xmath93 as the ratio between the smoothing - window sizes on the two axes . @xcite",
    "have shown that the mass profile determination is largely independent on the precise choice of @xmath94 . as in @xcite , we symmetrize the caustics with respect to the mean cluster velocity .",
    "following and @xcite , we choose the caustic that minimizes the function : @xmath95 the @xmath96 term is determined from the caustic amplitude , and @xmath97 is the normalized velocity dispersion of the cluster members contained within @xmath98 , the average clustercentric distance of all cluster members . as described in   [ jeans ] our fiducial sample of cluster members does not include late - type spirals and is restricted to galaxies within @xmath26 .",
    "we show in figure  [ f - caustic ] the caustic that minimizes the @xmath99 function ( see eq .  [ eq4 ] ) .",
    "hereafter , we refer to this caustic as the optimal caustic.    in order to translate the optimal caustic amplitude into a mass profile , we must know the function @xmath92 .",
    "this function actually depends on the gravitational potential one is willing to determine .",
    "however , numerical simulations show that this dependence is small at sufficiently large distances from the cluster center . @xcite and @xcite used the simple approximation @xmath100 , but this is not really supported by the results of ( see figure  3 in s paper ) . in our analysis we adopt a non - constant @xmath92 ( see figure  [ f - fbeta ] ) which is a smooth approximation of the result obtained by for a @xmath2cdm cosmology . the resulting mass function is shown in figure  [ f - mass ] ( top panel ) .",
    "the c.l.s on this mass function are determined as in @xcite . for the sake of comparison",
    ", we also show the mass function one would obtain by adopting @xmath101 .",
    "as can be seen from the top panel of figure  [ f - mass ] , the mass profiles determined from the same optimal caustic , using different @xmath92 functions , can differ considerably . as a matter of fact",
    ", the choice of @xmath92 constitutes the dominant source of uncertainty in this method .",
    "note however that the mass profile determined using a non - constant @xmath92 is in remarkable consistency with the mass profile determined via the jeans analysis ( see   [ jeans ] ) .    in order to reduce the systematic errors in the mass profile , it is better to avoid using the caustic method in the central cluster regions .",
    "in fact , the main advantage of the caustic method lies in its applicability beyond the virialized central region , where classical methods fail , but classical methods may prove superior in the central region , where the caustic method suffers from the uncertainty in the function @xmath92 .",
    "we can therefore take advantage of the constraints imposed by the jeans analysis on the mass interior to @xmath26 , and compute the mass from the caustic method only at @xmath102 ( i.e. we set @xmath103 in eq .",
    "[ eqdiaf ] ) . by doing this",
    "we reduce the uncertainty in the mass profile determined via the caustic method , because the radial dependence of @xmath92 is much smaller at large radii than in the central region ( see figure  2 in ) . the combined mass profile from the jeans and",
    "the caustic approach is shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ f - mass ] .",
    "clearly , the mass profiles determined with different choices of @xmath92 are now in good agreement , since we compute them only for @xmath104 .",
    "the uncertainty on the total mass at @xmath105 is @xmath106% .",
    "we note that the mass profile determined by the caustic method follows very closely the extrapolation of the best - fit @xmath59-profile out to @xmath105",
    ". the best - fit @xmath57-profile is somewhat steeper , but well within the 68% confidence region of the caustic mass profile .",
    "in   [ caustic ] we have determined the average cluster mass profile out to @xmath105 .",
    "we obtain the average cluster mass density profile , @xmath107 , by numerical differentiation of the mass profile shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ f - mass ] ( indicated by the solid line up to @xmath108 , and by the dash - dotted line at larger radii ) . we determine the 68% confidence interval on this density profile by constructing a set of density profiles which are built non - parametrically from the differentiation of several mass profiles spanning the allowed 68% confidence region . in building these density profiles",
    "we impose the physical condition of a negative logarithmic derivative of the mass density at all radii .    in order to determine the 3-dimensional number density profile , @xmath109 ( and its confidence intervals ) , up @xmath105 , we use mapeln . in this case",
    "we do not exclude late - type spiral members , since we are interested in the total number of galaxies in the cluster , irrespective of their kinematics .",
    "since the 2dfgrs is complete in _ apparent _ magnitude , and our 43 clusters span a significant redshift range ( 0.020.13 ) , we need to impose an _ absolute _ magnitude limit to ensure the same sampling of the luminosity functions of all our 43 clusters .",
    "we therefore select the 399 cluster members brighter than the k - corrected @xcite absolute magnitude @xmath110 , which is the magnitude of the faintest member of the most distant among our 43 clusters , apm  294 ( see   [ data ] ) .",
    "this magnitude is sufficiently bright as to avoid possible problems related to the increase in the number of dwarf galaxies with clustercentric distance ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since the cluster membership assignment is problematic beyond @xmath26 , we correct the mapeln density profile at larger distances , by making use of the optimal caustic . specifically , beyond @xmath26 we multiply the mapeln density profile by the fraction of cluster members which are contained within the optimal caustic in each given radial bin .",
    "this fraction is 0.8 on average , i.e. @xmath111% of our ( presumed ) cluster members beyond @xmath26 could be interlopers .",
    "the mass - to - number density ratio as a function of the clustercentric radial distance is shown in figure  [ f - dmdn ] ( upper panel ) .",
    "the vertical scale in this plot is in normalized units ( see   [ jeans ] ) .",
    "the irregular behavior at radii larger than @xmath26 is due to the use of a non - parametric mass profile estimator ( the caustic method ) .",
    "the bump at @xmath112 is related to the fact that we have joined the mass profile determined from the jeans analysis and the mass profile determined from the caustic method , without imposing a continuous derivative .",
    "apart from obvious irregularities , one can notice an almost monotonous decrease from @xmath113 to the outermost radius .",
    "we test the null hypothesis of a constant mass - to - number density profile by the @xmath64 method .",
    "the null hypothesis is fully consistent with the data ( 3.7% c.l . ) when only the inner @xmath86 region is considered , but it is rejected ( 99.9% c.l . ) over the full radial range ( @xmath114 ) .",
    "had we not corrected for the presence of doubtful cluster members at radii larger than @xmath26 , the decrease would have been ( marginally ) even stronger .    in figure",
    "[ f - dmdn ] ( lower panel ) we also plot the mass - to - number density ratio for the sample of 299 early - type , i.e. @xmath115 @xcite , cluster members brighter than @xmath42 .",
    "the mass - to - number density profile is somewhat flatter , as expected , since the early - type cluster galaxies have the steepest number density profile among cluster galaxy populations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this case",
    ", the mass - to - number density profile is consistent with being constant , not only within the central @xmath116 region ( 0.2% c.l . ) , but also up to @xmath19 ( 74.2% c.l . ) .",
    "in our analysis we have determined the mass and mass - to - number density profiles of galaxy clusters out to @xmath117 .",
    "we find that both cuspy profiles and profiles with a core are acceptable .",
    "best - fits to the inner @xmath118 region are found for a @xmath57-profile ( see eq .",
    "[ eq2 ] ) with @xmath75 and @xmath119 , or a @xmath59-profile ( see eq .",

    "density profiles with very large core - radii ( @xmath123 ) are ruled out ( 90% c.l . ) .",
    "the density profiles that provide the best - fits to the data in the inner @xmath118 region , also provide a reasonable description of the cluster gravitational potential at larger radii , out to @xmath117 .",
    "let us compare our results with previous mass - profile determinations . from the analysis of the cnoc cluster survey data - set @xcite and conclude that the average mass profile of galaxy clusters is well described by the s analytic form , with a scale @xmath124 , although other profiles are equally acceptable .",
    "their best - fit scale is slightly larger than ours , but not significantly so .",
    "note anyway that the cnoc clusters are on average more massive than the 43 clusters in our sample , so they are expected to be less concentrated and have a larger scale .",
    "@xcite find that the profile provides a good fit to the coma mass profile , while a softened isothermal sphere does not .",
    "similarly , @xcite are able to rule out a singular isothermal sphere for the mass profile of the cluster a576 , while a profile is a good fit to the observed mass profile .",
    "both the results of @xcite and those of @xcite are based on the caustic analysis .",
    "similar conclusions about the cluster mass profile are reached by @xcite using x - ray data .",
    "both the cluster a2199 and the cluster a496 have mass profiles remarkably well approximated by models , and deviate from the isothermal mass profile ( which is too steep ) . on the other hand , @xcite",
    "find that about half of 22 nearby clusters of galaxies have an x - ray determined mass density profile which is better fitted by a @xcite s rather than a model . in their x - ray analyses of 12 galaxy clusters ,",
    "@xcite find that the king profile provides a good fit to the mass density distribution , but with very small core - radii ( @xmath125 @xmath7 kpc ) .",
    "useful constraints are derived from the gravitational lensing analysis .",
    "most authors @xcite conclude in favor of a mass profile and against an isothermal sphere mass distribution , except perhaps @xcite .",
    "our results are in agreement with the claims in support of a mass density profile and against both a softened - profile with @xmath126 . ] and a singular isothermal sphere mass profiles , which both increase faster with radius than our observed cluster mass profile .",
    "we stress however that our data do not rule out the presence of a core in galaxy clusters , although this core has to be very small , of the order of the size of a galaxy .",
    "interestingly , our formal best - fit for a profile is obtained for @xmath122 , which is mid - way between the formal best - fit obtained for the cnoc clusters by and the formal best - fit obtained for the poor galaxy systems by @xcite . since our clusters are of intermediate mass between the cnoc clusters and the poor systems of galaxies of @xcite , a scaling of @xmath127 with the mass of the system",
    "is suggested , as expected from numerical simulations .",
    "our most intriguing result is the significant decrease of the mass - to - number density ratio at radii greater than @xmath128 .",
    "the mass per galaxy at @xmath129 is only about half the mass per galaxy in the cluster central regions . although we do not derive the mass - to - light profile ( which would require an analysis of the cluster luminosity function and it is beyond the scope of this paper ) , this is unlikely to be constant .",
    "in fact , for the mass - to - light profile to be flat , a strong luminosity segregation over the entire radial range out to @xmath117 is required .",
    "apart from the segregation of the very bright galaxies , which only concerns the cluster cores ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , luminosity segregation in clusters is also observed as a change of the number ratio of dwarf to giant galaxies with radius(e.g .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the luminosity segregation of dwarf galaxies is not relevant in our case , since our number density profile is determined only on galaxies brighter than @xmath130 , which is only @xmath131 magnitudes fainter than @xmath132 in the schechter luminosity function for early - type galaxies @xcite .",
    "we do not find evidence of luminosity segregation in our sample of members brighter than @xmath130 , as their absolute magnitudes and clustercentric distances are uncorrelated ( 52% c.l .",
    ", according to a spearman rank correlation test ) .",
    "our mass - to - number density profile implies a mass distribution more concentrated than the galaxies . since the hot x - ray emitting gas is less concentrated than the galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , our result also implies that the _ dark _ matter distribution is more concentrated than the _ baryonic _ matter distribution .",
    "previous determinations of the mass - to - light ( or mass - to - number ) profiles have provided evidences both in favor @xcite and against @xcite a constant mass - to - light profile .",
    "@xcite find an increasing mass - to - light profile in the poor cluster awm7 , from the center to @xmath133 @xmath7 mpc .",
    "such an increase is also seen in our data ( see figure  [ f - dmdn ] ) but it is not significant .",
    "@xcite find that the mass - to - light profile decreases with clustercentric radius , in consistency with our finding .",
    "@xcite find an increasing mass - to - light profile in galaxy groups . clearly , a general consensus on the relative distribution of dark and baryonic matter in galaxy systems is still lacking .",
    "part of the discrepancy among different authors can arise from the use of different photometric bands @xcite .",
    "cluster members are redder in the cluster center , so that blue - band selected cluster samples ( like ours ) should be characterized by flatter number density profiles , and hence _ steeper _ mass - to - number density profiles , as compared to samples selected in the near - infrared .",
    "our mass - to - number density profile indeed becomes flatter , and consistent with being constant , when only early - type ( and hence redder ) cluster members are considered ( see fig .",
    "[ f - dmdn ] ) .    does our result invalidates the use of simple mass estimators based on the _ light traces mass _ hypothesis ?",
    "probably not .",
    "in fact , our mass - to - number density profile does not significantly deviate from a constant when we restrict the analysis to the virialized region ( @xmath134 ) , or when only the early - type galaxies are considered .",
    "we use the june  2001 public release of the 2dfgrs to construct a sample of 4947 galaxies with redshifts in the region of 43 clusters , reaching out to @xmath117 .",
    "1345 cluster members are selected with the method of @xcite .",
    "we build an ensemble cluster profile from this sample , using @xmath47 and @xmath25 of each cluster to normalize the clustercentric radii and velocities of all galaxies .",
    "we determine the mass profile of this ensemble cluster by two independent methods , namely those of and .",
    "the method of is based on the solution of the jeans equation , and can only be applied in conditions of dynamical equilibrium .",
    "we therefore apply it on the subsample of cluster members within the virial radius , @xmath47 .",
    "we exclude late - type spirals from this sample since these galaxies have been shown in the literature to be characterized by anisotropic orbits ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the method of can usefully be applied to the whole sample of galaxies in the cluster region , since it does not require dynamical equilibrium .",
    "we use it to constrain the cluster mass profile beyond the virial radius , and out to the limit we imposed on our sample , @xmath117 .",
    "we find very good agreement between the mass profiles determined using the two methods .",
    "the mass profile from the center to @xmath117 is remarkably well fitted by a @xmath59-model ( eq .  [ eq1 ] ) with @xmath135 and @xmath66 , but many other models provide acceptable fits , including models and models with a small core ( @xmath136 ) .",
    "we find an uncertainty on the total mass of @xmath137% at the virial radius , and @xmath138% at two virial radii .",
    "we determine the mass - to - number density profile of the ensemble cluster .",

    "<S> we use the public release of @xmath0 galaxies of the _ two degree field galaxy redshift survey _ ( 2dfgrs ) to analyze the internal dynamics of galaxy clusters . </S>",
    "<S> we select 43 non - interacting clusters which are adequately sampled in the 2dfgrs public release . </S>",
    "<S> members of these clusters are selected out to @xmath1 virial radii . </S>",
    "<S> we build an ensemble cluster by stacking together the 43 clusters , after appropriate scaling of their galaxy velocities and clustercentric distances . </S>",
    "<S> we solve the jeans equation for the hydrostatic equilibrium for the member galaxies within the virial radius of the ensemble cluster , assuming isotropic orbits . </S>",
    "<S> we constrain the cluster mass profile within the virial radius by exploring parameterized models for the cluster mass - density profile . </S>",
    "<S> we find that both cuspy profiles and profiles with a core are acceptable . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the concentration parameter of the best fit nfw model is as predicted from numerical simulations in a @xmath2cdm cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> density profiles with very large core - radii are ruled out . beyond the virial radius </S>",
    "<S> , dynamical equilibrium can not be taken for granted , and the jeans equation may not be applicable . in order to extend our dynamical analysis out to @xmath1 virial radii , we rely upon the method which uses the amplitude of caustics in the space of galaxy clustercentric distances and velocities . </S>",
    "<S> we find very good agreement between the mass profile determined with the caustic method and the extrapolation to @xmath1 virial radii of the best - fit mass profile determined by the jeans analysis in the virialized inner region . </S>",
    "<S> we determine the mass - to - number density profile , and find it is fully consistent with a constant within the virial radius . </S>",
    "<S> the mass - to - number density profile is however inconsistent with a constant when the full radial range from 0 to @xmath1 virial radii is considered , unless the sample used to determine the number density profile is restricted to the early - type galaxies . </S>"
