    "the performance of linear error - correcting codes ( and low - density parity - check ( ldpc ) codes in particular ) under iterative decoding depends on the choice of the parity - check matrix of the code .",
    "more precisely , the error rate of a code is influenced by a class of combinatorial entities determined by the choice of the parity - check matrix , such as stopping  @xcite and trapping sets  @xcite . stopping and trapping sets",
    "are defined in terms of constraints on the weights of rows in the parity - check matrix induced by subsets of its columns .",
    "certain such restrictions on the weight distributions of the rows can only be satisfied if the parity - check matrix of the code has a sufficiently large number of judiciously chosen rows .",
    "thus , recent work focused on introducing redundant rows into parity - check matrices of a code in order to ensure that the size of their smallest stopping sets are sufficiently large or equal to the minimum distance of the code  @xcite .",
    "since adding redundant rows to the parity - check matrix increases the decoding complexity of the code , it is important to understand the inherent trade - off between the size of the smallest stopping set and the number of rows in a parity - check matrix .",
    "several ideas for addressing these issues that exploit properties of orthogonal arrays and covering arrays  @xcite were described in  @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the contributions of this work are three - fold .",
    "first , we generalize the notion of the stopping redundancy for the case of trapping sets , and term this combinatorial number the _ trapping redundancy_. second , we describe simple probabilistic and deterministic methods for upper - bounding the trapping redundancy of binary linear block codes .",
    "third , we present new analytical techniques for estimating the sizes of small trapping sets in the family of projective geometry ( pg ) codes and the margulis @xmath0 $ ] code , and compare these estimates with the upper bounds .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : definitions ] provides relevant definitions and introduces the terminology used throughout the paper .",
    "section  [ sec : analytical_study ] contains the main results  probabilistic and constructive upper bounds on the trapping redundancy of codes .",
    "section  [ sec : analytical_comparisons ] describes the relationship between trapping sets and arcs in pg codes . in the same section ,",
    "numerical results for the trapping redundancy of the margulis @xmath0 $ ] and the family of pg codes are compared with results concerning arcs and elementary trapping sets in the family of margulis codes .",
    "concluding remarks are given in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we start by introducing trapping sets and elementary trapping sets , and then proceed to define the notions of the restriction of ( redundant ) parity - check matrices . based on the notion of the restriction , we state the central definition of the paper , pertaining to the trapping redundancy of a linear block code .",
    "decoding of ldpc codes is usually performed in an iterative manner , using the suboptimal belief - propagation ( bp ) algorithm .",
    "this decoding approach , also known as message passing , can be seen as the process of exchanging reliability messages along the edges of a bipartite tanner graph .",
    "the incidence matrix of the tanner graph corresponds to the parity - check matrix used for decoding , so that the code variables index the vertices on the left hand side of the graph , while the parity - check equations index the right hand side vertices of the graph . for a more comprehensive treatment of ldpc codes and iterative",
    "decoding , the interested reader is referred to  @xcite .",
    "the error - floor phenomenon of iterative decoders was first described by mackay and postol in  @xcite , who observed that the bit error rate curve of the @xmath0 $ ] margulis code exhibits a sudden change of slope at signal - to - noise ratios approximately equal to @xmath1 db .",
    "this change of slope was attributed to the existence of _ near - codewords _ in the tanner graph of the margulis code with a parity - check matrix @xmath2 described in @xcite . near",
    "codewords are error vectors @xmath3 of small weight , with syndromes @xmath4 that also have small weight . in his seminal paper  @xcite",
    ", richardson analyzed the effect of near - codewords on the performance of various classes of decoders and for a group of channels .",
    "he also introduced the notion of _ trapping sets _ to describe configurations of variable nodes in tanner graphs of codes that cause failures of specific decoding schemes .",
    "there exist many different groups of trapping sets .",
    "for example , trapping sets of maximum likelihood decoders are sets of variables containing the supports of _ codewords _ of the code ; trapping sets of iterative decoders used for messages transmitted over the binary erasure channel are stopping sets  @xcite . for the additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channel and bp decoding , no simple characterization of trapping sets is known .",
    "nevertheless , extensive computer simulations revealed that a large number of trapping sets for this channel / decoder combination can be described in a simple and precise setting .",
    "henceforth , we use the notion `` trapping set '' to refer exclusively to sets of the form described below . to define trapping sets ,",
    "we first introduce the notion of the restriction of a matrix .    for a given @xmath5 matrix @xmath6 with @xmath7 , @xmath8 , the restriction of a set of @xmath9 columns indexed by @xmath10",
    "is defined as an @xmath11 sub - matrix of @xmath2 consisting of the elements @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 .    for a given linear @xmath15 $ ] code @xmath16 , with parity - check matrix @xmath2 and corresponding tanner graph @xmath17 , trapping sets",
    "are defined as follows .",
    "an @xmath18 trapping set @xmath19 is a collection of @xmath20 variable nodes for which the subgraph in @xmath21 induced by @xmath19 and its neighbors contains @xmath22 odd - degree check nodes corresponds to codewords .",
    "henceforth , we consider the case @xmath23 only . ] .",
    "equivalently , an @xmath18 trapping set @xmath19 of @xmath2 is a set of @xmath20 columns with a restriction that contains @xmath24 odd - weight rows .    the class of trapping sets that exhibits the strongest influence on the performance of iterative decoders is the class of _ elementary _ trapping sets .",
    "an elementary @xmath18 trapping set is a set @xmath25 for which all check nodes in the subgraph induced by @xmath25 and its neighbors have either degree one or two , and there are exactly @xmath24 degree - one check nodes . alternatively , an elementary @xmath18 trapping set is a trapping set for which all non - zero rows in the restriction have either weight one or two , and exactly @xmath24 rows have weight one .    for a fixed value of the parameter @xmath20 ( or @xmath24 ) , the problem of finding the trapping set with smallest parameter @xmath24 ( or @xmath20 ) in a given parity - check matrix",
    "is np - hard , and np - hard to approximate  @xcite .",
    "this makes a general and complete characterization of the trapping set sizes and trapping redundancy prohibitively complex .",
    "we therefore focus our attention on deriving upper bounds on the trapping redundancy with set sizes restricted to @xmath26 only , where @xmath27 denotes the minimum distance of the code , and in particular , elementary trapping sets  @xcite .",
    "this is motivated by the recent studies that suggest that trapping sets most detrimental to the code performance are elementary , and that they have small @xmath18 parameters , usually such that @xmath28  @xcite .      for every linear @xmath15 $ ] code @xmath29 ,",
    "there exist many choices for parity - check matrices , although for iterative decoding not all of them may be adequate .",
    "this is due to the fact that some parity - check matrices have irregular row- and column - weights and that they contain a large number of stopping and trapping sets  @xcite . in order to mitigate this problem ,",
    "one may resort to the use of _ redundant _ parity - check matrices , i.e. , matrices that contain more than @xmath30 rows , although they have row - rank equal to @xmath30 .",
    "examples of the use of redundant parity - check matrices for signaling over the binary erasure channel can be found in  @xcite .    henceforth , we use the phrase _ redundant parity - check matrix _ to refer to a parity - check matrix with row - rank @xmath30 that has more than @xmath30 rows .",
    "a redundant parity - check matrix contains rows that are linear combination of other rows that represent a basis of the dual code @xmath31 . for a fixed basis ,",
    "rows of this form are referred to as redundant rows .",
    "on the other hand , a parity - check matrix of full row - rank and dimension @xmath32 is simply termed a _",
    "parity - check matrix_. redundant parity - check matrices are used to impose specific constraints on the structure of their corresponding tanner graphs . as was shown in  @xcite ,",
    "even one judiciously chosen redundant row can be used to lower the error floor of the margulis code .",
    "this is achieved in terms of rendering the structure of a selected small trapping set so as to increase the number of its corresponding unsatisfied parity - check equations . from an application point of view , it is of interest to identify one or a few redundant rows that can be added to the parity - check matrix in order to eliminate a trapping set causing a special instant of decoding failure .",
    "note that one or a few redundant rows of low weight do not significantly alter the performance of a code in the waterfall region , although they may have a significant bearing on its performance in the error - floor region . in what follows ,",
    "we consider the more general theoretical problem of determining the smallest number of redundant rows needed to _ simultaneously _ eliminate the negative effect of classes of trapping sets on the performance of iterative decoders . in this context ,",
    "our results can be seen as a generalization of the findings in  @xcite for the case of trapping sets .",
    "an analytical study of the trapping redundancy is presented in the following section .",
    "we investigate the fundamental theoretical trade - offs between the number of rows in a redundant parity - check matrix of a code and the size of its smallest trapping set with a given set of parameters .      in all our subsequent derivations , we make use of the following definition .",

    "consequently , there are @xmath47 rows in the restriction of the @xmath20 columns that have even weight and @xmath47 rows that have odd weight .    however , it is of much larger importance to determine if there exist parity - check matrices with a number of rows significantly smaller than @xmath41 that are free of trapping sets with fixed parameters @xmath49 , for all @xmath50 . for this purpose ,",

    "the goal of the comparative study is to both assess the tightness of the bounds of section  [ sec : analytical_study ] and to demonstrate that structured ldpc codes with redundant parity - check matrices can avoid small trapping sets in their tanner graphs .",
    "note that the presented results only capture the trade - off between the smallest size of general and elementary trapping sets and the number of rows in the corresponding ( redundant ) parity - check matrix , without taking into consideration other important matrix properties such as variable and check nodes degree , girth , and cycle length distribution .",
    "numerical values of the trapping redundancy derived in section  [ sec : analytical_study ] for the @xmath0 $ ] margulis code are listed in tables  [ table : ts_bounds_margulis ] and  [ table : ts_bounds_margulis_elementary ] .",
    "the labels _ lll ( std ) _ , _ lll ( hp ) _ refer to the bounds based on lll in standard form and its high - probability variation , respectively .",
    "the symbol @xmath52 denotes the number of rows required by the lll approach , while @xmath195 refers to the number of rows of a redundant , rank @xmath30 parity - check matrix , which is an upper bound on the trapping redundancy , @xmath196 .",
    "as the exact minimum distance is not known for this code , a method  @xcite for approximating the minimum distance , proposed in  @xcite , was used instead .",
    "the estimate at hand is @xmath197 , and we restrict our attention to values of the parameter @xmath20 strictly ( and significantly ) smaller than @xmath198 .",
    "the full - rank @xmath199 parity - check matrix @xmath2 of the margulis code , constructed in the standard manner  @xcite , contains no cycles of length less than eight , but includes a large number of @xmath200 and @xmath201 elementary trapping sets  @xcite .",
    "the lll - based bounds reveal that there exists a matrix of full rank with at most @xmath202 rows that does not contain @xmath203 elementary trapping sets , with @xmath204 , and that adding at most @xmath205 additional rows ensures that the matrix does not contain @xmath200 trapping sets either .",
    "it can also be seen from table  [ table : ts_bounds_margulis ] that there exists a matrix of row - rank @xmath30 with @xmath206 rows that is free of trapping sets of size @xmath207 , @xmath208 .",
    "however , for a parity - check matrix free of elementary trapping sets of the same parameters , table  [ table : ts_bounds_margulis_elementary ] shows that only @xmath209 rows are needed .",
    "these bounds cover the case of fixed @xmath20 values only .",
    "note that finding analogs of these results that cover a _ range _ of general trapping set sizes @xmath20 instead may be desirable for certain practical applications .",
    "due to the monotonic increase of the trapping redundancy with the value of the parameter @xmath20 , one can see that if a set of rows , randomly drawn from the codewords of the dual code , does not contain trapping sets of size @xmath20 with high probability , then this set is also very unlikely to support trapping sets of size smaller than @xmath20 .",
    "for example , to obtain a matrix free of @xmath203 trapping sets , @xmath208 , according to the high - probability version of lll with @xmath210 one needs @xmath211 rows , so that @xmath212 . with _ high probability _ , this matrix does also avoid @xmath213 trapping sets , @xmath208 , due to the lll - based study .    note",
    "that for elementary trapping sets , table  [ table : ts_bounds_margulis ] indicates that the larger the value of the parameter @xmath20 , the smaller the number of redundant rows that is needed to eliminate such trapping sets .",
    "this result may seem counterintuitive , but it follows from the fact that trapping sets are deemed elementary only as their restriction does not contain rows of weight larger than two - an event that becomes less likely with the increase of the parameter @xmath20 .",
    ".[table : ts_bounds_margulis ] upper bounds on the @xmath18 trapping redundancy @xmath51 of the margulis code .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^ , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     although there exist parity - check matrices for the @xmath214 codes that have smaller row - redundancy and do not contain elementary trapping sets of small sizes , the matrix defined by the @xmath214 construction presents a way to generate a parity - check matrix with limited redundancy , small row - weight , and therefore few short cycles , which also performs well in the waterfall region . as can be seen from the comparison table , @xmath214 codes represent an attractive systematic construction of ldpc codes without small trapping sets , whose redundancy lies between the bounds based on the standard case and the high - probability version of lll .",
    "we introduced the notion of the @xmath18 trapping redundancy of a code , representing the smallest number of rows in any parity - check matrix of the code that avoids @xmath49 trapping sets with @xmath215 .",
