    "qcd confines color , but color confinement mechanism is not yet clarified .",
    "a promising picture is the dual meissner effect due to condensation of some color magnetic quantity @xcite .",
    "this picture is realized in the confinement phase of lattice compact qed@xcite .",
    "especially interesting are the following facts : + 1 ) a dual transformation can be done , leading us to an action describing a monopole coulomb gas @xcite .",
    "monopole condensation is shown to occur in the confinement phase from energy - entropy balance .",
    "+ 2 ) the monopole contribution alone can reproduce the full value of the string tension@xcite .    in the case of qcd",
    ", there is a difficult problem .",
    "we have to find a color magnetic quantity in qcd .",
    "the thooft idea of abelian projection of qcd@xcite is very interesting in this respect .",
    "the abelian projection of qcd is to extract an abelian theory performing a partial gauge - fixing such that the maximal abelian torus group remains unbroken . after the abelian projection",
    ", @xmath1 qcd can be regarded as a @xmath2 abelian gauge theory with magnetic monopoles and electric charges .",
    "t hooft conjectured that the condensation of the abelian monopoles is the confinement mechanism in qcd@xcite .",
    "there are , however , infinite ways of extracting such an abelian theory out of @xmath1 qcd .",
    "it seems important to find a good gauge in which the conjecture is seen clearly to be realized .",
    "a gauge called maximally abelian ( ma ) gauge has been shown to be very interesting @xcite . in the ma gauge , there are phenomena which may be called abelian dominance @xcite . especially the string tension in @xmath3 qcd is well reproduced by wilson loops composed of abelian link fields alone in the ma gauge . moreover the monopole current @xmath4 can be defined similarly as in compact qed@xcite .",
    "it is shown in the ma gauge that the abelian monopoles are dense and dynamical in the confinement phase , whereas they are dilute and static in the deconfinement phase@xcite .",
    "recently we have derived an effective @xmath5 monopole action in the ma gauge and in @xmath3 qcd@xcite .",
    "entropy dominance over energy of the monopole loops , i.e. , condensation of the monopole loops seems to occur in the confinement phase if extended monopoles@xcite are considered@xcite .",
    "after the abelian projection in the ma gauge , infrared behaviors of @xmath3 qcd may be described by a compact - qed like @xmath5 theory with the running coupling constant instead of the bare one and with the monopole mass on a dual lattice .    if the monopoles alone are responsible for the confinement mechanism , the string tension which is a key quantity of confinement must be explained by monopole contributions alone .",
    "this is realized in compact qed @xcite .",
    "the aim of this note is to show that the same thing happens also in @xmath3 qcd by means of evaluating monopole and photon contributions to abelian wilson loops .",
    "preliminary results are reported by the present authors@xcite and other group@xcite .",
    "we adopt the usual su(2 ) wilson action .",
    "the maximally abelian gauge is given @xcite by performing a local gauge transformation @xmath6 such that    @xmath7 is maximized . here",
    "@xmath8 after the gauge fixing is over , there still remains a @xmath5 symmetry .",
    "we can extract an abelian link gauge variable from the @xmath3 ones as follows ; @xmath9 where @xmath10 is diagonal and @xmath11 has off - diagonal components .",
    "it is easy to show that the above fields @xmath10 and @xmath12 behave under the residual @xmath5 transformation @xmath13 as an abelian gauge field and charged matters , respectively : @xmath14    let us repeat that a @xmath5 invariant quantity written in terms of the abelian link variables @xmath10 after an abelian projection can be rewritten in a @xmath3 invariant ( but complicated ) form using the original link variables @xmath15@xcite .",
    "the gauge function @xmath6 which maximizes @xmath16 is a functional of @xmath15 .",
    "first study the transformation property of @xmath6 under any @xmath3 transformation @xmath17 , fixing the @xmath5 ambiguity of @xmath6 in some way . considering that a gauge - fixed quantity does not transform ,",
    "we see    @xmath18    where @xmath19 ensures the form invariance of @xmath20 and @xmath6 and is determined uniquely by @xmath6 and @xmath17 . using the definition ( [ vuv ] ) and the transformation property ( [ vw ] )",
    ", we get @xmath21 for any @xmath3 transformation @xmath17 . hence all @xmath5 invariant quantities composed of @xmath22 ( and @xmath10 ) are automatically @xmath3 invariant after the abelian projection .    as an example , consider a @xmath5-invariant @xmath23 plaquette variable @xmath24 composed of @xmath10 alone . using ( [ vuv ] ) and ( [ au ] ) , we get @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a modified link field defined by @xmath27 and @xmath28 . under an arbitrary @xmath3 transformation @xmath17 ,",
    "we see from ( [ atrans ] ) , ( [ vw ] ) and ( [ uw ] ) @xmath29 namely , @xmath26 transforms like the corresponding original link field @xmath15 .",
    "the @xmath3 invariance of @xmath24 is seen also from this property .",
    "moreover , it is seen how different the abelian plaquette variable is from the full one .",
    "@xmath24 in a different abelian projection corresponds to a differently modified full plaquette variable composed of @xmath26 .",
    "we show an abelian wilson loop operator written in terms of @xmath10 alone after the abelian projection is given by a product of monopole and photon contributions . here",
    "we take into account only a simple wilson loop , say , of size @xmath30 .",
    "then such an abelian wilson loop operator is expressed as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is an external current taking @xmath33 along the wilson loop and @xmath34 is an angle variable defined from @xmath10 as follows : @xmath35 since @xmath32 is conserved , it is rewritten for such a simple wilson loop in terms of an antisymmetric variable @xmath36 as @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is a backward derivative on a lattice .",
    "@xmath36 takes @xmath33 on a surface with the wilson loop boundary .",
    "although we can choose any surface of such a type , we adopt a minimal surface here .",
    "we get @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 is a forward derivative on a lattice .",
    "the gauge plaquette variable can be decomposed into @xmath42 where @xmath43 $ ] corresponds to a field strength and @xmath44 is an integer - valued plaquette variable denoting the dirac string .",

    "since @xmath36 and @xmath44 are integers , the latter does not contribute to eq .",
    "( [ w ] ) . hence @xmath46 in eq .",
    "( [ w ] ) is replaced by @xmath47 . using a decomposition rule @xmath48,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "we get @xmath49 where a monopole current @xmath4 is defined as @xmath50 following degrand - toussaint@xcite .",
    "@xmath51 is the lattice coulomb propagator . since @xmath47 corresponds to the field strength of the photon field , @xmath52 is the photon ( the monopole ) contribution to the wilson loop . to study the features of both contributions , we evaluate the expectation values @xmath53 and",
    "@xmath54 separately and compare them with those of @xmath55 .",
    "the monte - carlo simulations were done on @xmath56 lattice from @xmath57 to @xmath58 .",
    "all measurements were done every 30 sweeps after a thermalization of 1500 sweeps .",
    "we took 50 configurations totally for measurements .",
    "the gauge - fixing criterion is the same as done in ref .",
    "@xcite . using gauge - fixed configurations , we evaluated monopole currents and obtained the ensemble of monopole currents .",
    "as shown in the previous note@xcite , type-2 extended monopole loops with @xmath59 seem to condense , where @xmath60 for @xmath61 extended monopoles and @xmath62 is the lattice constant .",
    "so we measure @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) extended monopoles with @xmath65 of the type-2@xcite as well as usual smallest ones .",
    "the extended monopole of the type-2 is defined on an extended cube as the sum of the smallest ones included in the cube as shown in fig .",
    "note that the definition of the type-2 extended monopoles corresponds to making a block spin transformation of the monopole currents with the scale factor @xmath66 .",
    "hence the effective lattice volume is reduced .",
    "we call the effective lattice as a renormalized lattice .",
    "we evaluate the averages of @xmath55 using abelian link variables ( called abelian ) on the original lattice , of @xmath67 ( photon part ) , and @xmath68 ( monopole part ) on each renormalized lattice , separately .",
    "the results are shown in the following :    1 .",
    "the monopole contributions to wilson loops are obtained with relatively small errors .",
    "surprisingly enough , the creutz ratios @xmath69 of the monopole contributions having small errors are almost independent of the loop size for example as shown in fig .  [ chi ] .",
    "this means that the monopole contributions are composed only of an area , a perimeter , and a constant terms without a coulomb term .",
    "2 .   assuming the static potential is given by a linear + coulomb + constant terms",
    ", we try to determine the potential using the least square fit .",
    "there are various ways , but we adopt a method similar to that@xcite using the creutz ratios .",
    "the assumption of the form of the static potential leads us to the creutz ratio @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the string tension and @xmath72 corresponds to the coulomb coefficient of the static potential . using the fitted values of @xmath71 and @xmath72 , we can reproduce each static potential .",
    "+ we plot their data in fig .",
    "[ pot25 ] ( at @xmath73 ) and in fig .",
    "[ pot26 ] ( at @xmath74 ) .",
    "we find the monopole contributions are responsible for the linear - rising behaviors .",
    "when the @xmath63 extended monopoles are used , we obtain almost the same results .",
    "the photon part contributes only to the short - ranged region .",
    "there seems to exist a small discrepancy between the abelian and the monopole + photon parts for @xmath75 , but finite - size effects are expected there . moreover",
    ", the assumption of the form of the static potential looks too simple .",
    "similar data are obtained for @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "this is seen more clearly from the data of the string tensions which are determined from the static potentials .",
    "they are shown in fig .",
    "[ sigma ] .",
    "the full and the abelian string tensions have large errors but they are seen to be well reproduced by the monopoles alone for @xmath78 and the photon part has almost vanishing string tensions .",
    "the string tensions from the monopoles and the photons of various sizes are plotted in fig .",
    "[ sigma2 ] .",
    "it is interesting to see that they are almost independent of the extendedness contrary to our preliminary data on a smaller lattice@xcite , although the monopole actions determined in @xcite depend on the extendedness .",
    "note that the extended monopoles of the type-2 are composed of the sum of the smallest monopoles .",
    "hence even when the extended monopoles alone look to condense , the smallest monopoles also have some information of the condensation .",
    "we have derived also coulomb coefficients from the static potentials as shown in fig .",
    "[ coulomb ] .",
    "the monopole part has almost vanishing coulomb coefficients which is in agreement with the constant behaviors of the creutz rations of the monopole part as shown above .",
    "the @xmath45 photon part has large coefficients and they reproduce well the coefficients of the abelian static potentials .",
    "we also measured the coulomb coefficients of the photon parts on each renormalized lattice .",
    "the values depend on the extendedness .",
    "but the following fact is interesting .",
    "the photon parts are evaluated on a renormalized lattice with @xmath60 .",
    "hence they have different values of @xmath79 for different extendedness .",
    "the coulomb coefficients of the photon parts are well reproduced by the @xmath3 running coupling constants @xmath80 with @xmath60 , i.e. , @xmath81 , where @xmath82 the scale parameter @xmath83 determined is @xmath84 which is quite near to the value @xmath85 fixed from the monopole action@xcite .    in conclusion",
    ", our analyses done here strongly suggest that abelian monopoles are responsible for confinement in @xmath3 qcd and condensation of the monopoles is the confinement mechanism if the abelian projection is done in the ma gauge . to extend our method to a finite - temperature system and",
    "also to @xmath1 with or without dynamical quarks is very interesting .",
    "these studies are also in progress .",
