    "the bulk of the gamma - ray emission from the monoceros snr is most likely from @xmath44 decay produced by the interactions of protons with ambient hydrogen .",
    "it is then reasonable to explain the gamma - ray spectrum of the rosette nebula by the same process .",

    "the resulting total proton energy , @xmath56  erg , is about 2% of that for the @xmath44-decay model of the snr , which is reasonable considering the solid angle of the rosette nebula with respect to the snr and uncertainty of the matter density .",
