    "it was shown @xcite that our semfis ( semiempirical formula based on fission theory ) and univ ( universal curve ) are the best among 18 calculations methods of @xmath8  decay half - lives . for some isotopes of even heavier shs , with @xmath11 ,",
    "there is a good chance for cluster decay modes to compete @xcite .",
    "there are many sources of experimental values for half - lives , @xmath12 , of shs against spontaneous fission , e.g. , @xcite . among them",
    "we found @xmath13 for @xmath14cn and @xmath15 for @xmath0fl .",
    "calculations have been also performed with different models @xcite .",
    "fission dynamics with werner - wheeler nuclear inertia tensor @xcite is not leading closer to experiment due to a too small value of inertia ; we tried to improve the agreement between theory and experiment for @xmath16cn by using different laws of variation of mass parameter with fragment separation distance .",
    "better results are obtained for @xmath17cn with cranking inertia @xcite by assuming the most effective split to be @xmath18 .    in the present work",
    "we continue to use the cranking inertia @xcite introduced by inglis @xcite .",
    "this time we try to find out the least action trajectory in the plane of two independent variables @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the separation distance of the fragments and @xmath19 is the mass asymmetry with @xmath20 the mass numbers of the parent and nuclear fragments .",
    "we assume @xmath21 hence @xmath22 .",
    "consequently both potential energy surfaces and contour plots ( figures like figs .",
    "[ pesflc ] , [ cflc ] , [ blg ] ) , function of @xmath5 , will not have the mirror part corresponding to @xmath23 .",
    "there are two main terms in the action integral allowing to calculate the half - life : the total deformation energy and the cranking inertia , both functions of @xmath5 .",
    "we are using the macroscopic - microscopic method @xcite to estimate the deformation energy , expressed as a sum of yukawa - plus - exponential ( y+em ) @xcite phenomenological energy , @xmath24 , and the shell plus pairing corrections , @xmath25 based on the asymmetric two center shell model ( atcsm ) @xcite : @xmath26 we shall briefly outline the model and discuss the obtained results .",
    "by choosing four independent deformation parameters @xmath27 @xcite during the deformation from one parent nucleus to two fission fragments , the surface equation in cylindrical coordinates @xmath28 is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the position of the crossing plane .",
    "the semiaxes ratio of spheroidally deformed fragments are denoted by @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "the scalar , @xmath33 , is determined by the components of the nuclear inertia tensor and the derivatives with respect to @xmath6 : @xmath34    when the two fragments are spheres , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , meaning that @xmath37 and the above equation becomes @xmath38 the derivative @xmath39 depends only on geometry .",
    "it is a negative quantity since @xmath7 decreases exponentially with @xmath6 ; its absolute values are rather small .    for a given mass asymmetry",
    "the final value of the radius of the light fragment @xmath40 is well determined .",
    "we assume an exponential law for the variation with @xmath6 : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is equal to the radius of the parent , and the initial and touching point separation distances are @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the radius constant in y+em is @xmath45  fm and @xmath46 we use this particular value in order to obtain @xmath47 for @xmath48 very close to the final value @xmath49 .",
    "when @xmath50 , we get @xmath51 , meaning an accuracy of 1.8  % . an even larger value of @xmath52 would increase the accuracy but it will also increase the nuclear inertia , because the shape variation will be faster .",
    "nuclear inertia is already too large , hence we would not like to increase it further .            for any @xmath7 and @xmath59",
    ", the matching condition at the intersection plane of the two spheres , gives the solution @xmath60 where @xmath30 is the distance of the intersection plane from the center of the heavy fragment .      for binary fragmentation with different charge densities , @xmath61 and @xmath62 @xcite , of the y+em deformation energy we gave the details of calculations in refs .",

    "@xcite : @xmath72 the relative yukawa and coulomb energies @xmath73 , @xmath74 are functions of the nuclear shape ; with axially - symmetric shapes they are expressed by triple integrals . in a similar way the coulomb relative energy is given by @xmath75 where again one can see the self - energies @xmath76 and the interaction @xmath77 .",
    "the input is obtained from the atcsm @xcite ; at every pair of coordinates @xmath5 we get a sequence of doubly degenerate discrete energy levels @xmath78 in units of @xmath79 , arranged in order of increasing energy . in units of @xmath80 the shell corrections are determined as @xmath81 with @xmath82 particles and @xmath83 the total energy of the uniform level distribution calculated with strutinsky s @xcite procedure",

    "two deep minima in the shell plus pairing correction energy correspond to the doubly magic fragments @xmath118sn ( near symmetry ) and @xmath119pb ( at a value of @xmath3 about 0.5 ) which are responsible for spontaneous fission and cluster decay , respectively .",
    "even along the least action trajectory the zero - point vibration energy remains too high , showing that this kind of parametrization with two deformation coordinates in which @xmath7 is varied exponentially from an initial value @xmath122 to @xmath53 , is not suitable .",
    "the reason is that the deepest minimum of deformation energy ( fig .",
    "[ fl0 ] ) , determining the first turning point of the action integral , is obtained in the deformation space where the nuclear inertia ( see fig .  [ crm ] ) is too large . by trying a linearly decreasing law of @xmath7",

    ", it seems that by keeping @xmath123  constant we can find a fission trajectory ( a given @xmath124 or @xmath3 ) along which the reproduction of experimental half - life would be possible with a reasonable value of @xmath112 . by comparing the optimum values of zero - point vibration energy from table  [ tab2 ] ( two deformation parameters with exponential decrease of @xmath7 ) with those from table  [ tab3 ] ( one deformation parameter with @xmath125  constant ) it is clear that the simplest parametrization is more appropriate because @xmath112 ( smallest value 1.34  mev ) is about three times smaller than 4.27  mev .",
    "the detailed potential barriers for ten different light fragments of fissioning @xmath0fl are shown in fig .",
    "[ 10b ] .    perhaps besides the inappropriate shape parametrization",
    "one should also consider another reason for this discrepancy : the strength parameters of the spin - orbit * l**s * and * l*@xmath126 terms of the atcsm are taken to obtain a proton magic number @xmath127  exactly the case of @xmath0fl .    in conclusion , with our method of calculating the spontaneous fission half - life including macroscopic - microscopic method for deformation energy based on asymmetric two - center shell model , and the cranking inertia for the dynamical part",
    ", we may find a sequence of several trajectories one of which gives the least action .    assuming spherical shapes , we have tried four laws of variation of the radius of the light fragment from the initial value at @xmath128 to the final one at the touching point @xmath129 : exponentially and linearly decreasing , linearly increasing and @xmath125  constant .",
    "the shape parametrization with linearly increasing @xmath7 is more suitable to describe the fission process of shs in comparison with that of exponentially or linearly decreasing law .",
    "it is in agreement with the microscopic finding concerning the preformation of a cluster at the surface , which then penetrates by quantum tunneling the potential barrier .",
    "as far as the potential barrier shape at a given mass asymmetry , there is a transition from a two hump at lower values to one hump at higher values around @xmath2 .",
    "the dominant macroscopic component at a high mass asymmetry , comes from the presence of the businaro - gallone mountain .",
    "the touching point deformation energy versus mass asymmetry shows the three minima , produced by shell effects , corresponding to three decay modes : spontaneous fission , cluster decay , and @xmath4  decay .",
    "all calculations were performed for spherical fragments ( the semiaxes ratios of spheroidally deformed fragments are equal to unity ) . by considering in the future the deformed fragments we trust the method could be further improved ."
