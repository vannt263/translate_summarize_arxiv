    "dilute , repulsively interacting bose gases in a three - dimensional harmonic trap have been at the focus of attention of the theoretical physics community since the experimental realization of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in 1995 @xcite .",
    "a vast amount of literature has been published recently on this topic based on the mean - field approach .",
    "it is however known that mean - field theory is not appropriate near the critical temperature because the fluctuations dominate the mean field in this region .",
    "this follows from applying the so - called ginzburg criterion @xcite and has triggered several attempts to go beyond mean - field theory near the critical region by means of various renormalization group ( rg ) techniques in the homogeneous interacting bose gas @xcite .",
    "this recent work was added to a significant amount of existing literature on the application of rg methods to interacting bose gases , that was written when such systems were only an interesting theoretical problem @xcite .",
    "all these studies so far concern the homogeneous case ; the real challenge however is to apply renormalization techniques to the experimentally relevant system , the trapped bose gas @xcite .",
    "this challenge is met here for the first time , at least when we approach the transition region from above the critical temperature ( symmetric phase ) . in this case",
    "the theoretical treatment is simpler than in the symmetry - broken phase and allows us to see how to apply renormalization techniques . in particular",
    ", we shall use a method similar to what in the homogeneous case is known as momentum - shell renormalization @xcite . in the trapped case it is energy shells instead of momentum shells that we will be integrating out .",
    "of course , since we are dealing here with a finite system , there is , strictly speaking , no phase transition @xcite .",
    "however , as we approach the thermodynamic limit , a quasi - phase transition develops , and renormalization methods are expected to enable us to study non - universal properties such as the critical temperature and its dependence on the scattering length .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii develops the theoretical methods necessary to apply the renormalization procedure to the weakly interacting , trapped bose gas . starting from a high - energy cutoff",
    ", we successively integrate out energy shells thus perturbatively creating an effective action for the low - energy field .",
    "this effective action is then cast into the form of the original action . in sec .",
    "iii , we derive the renormalization group equations for the chemical potential , the interaction , and the grand - canonical thermodynamic potential .",
    "we also refine our results by means of a first - order @xmath0-expansion .",
    "it is shown that , in the thermodynamic limit , the flow equations for the chemical interaction and the interaction have the same form as for a homogeneous interacting bose gas .",
    "all nonuniversal properties , that are due to the presence of the harmonic trap , enter through the flow equation for the thermodynamic potential .",
    "section iv is devoted to the study of a particular non - universal property , namely the transition temperature and its dependence on the scattering length in the thermodynamic limit . after a short summary in sec .",
    "v , we discuss in appendix a how the thermodynamic limit affects the relevant density of states entering the renormalization group equations of sec .",
    "appendix b contains a discussion of numerical methods we used for obtaining the results presented in sec .",

    "the coupling constant for the short - range , repulsive interaction potential is denoted by @xmath14 . for a dilute bose gas , it has to renormalize to the two - body @xmath15-matrix when all two - body scattering processes are taken into account @xcite .",
    "thus , in three spatial dimensions , at zero energy and in lowest order perturbation theory , this coupling constant is related to the @xmath10-wave scattering length @xmath16 by @xmath17 .",
    "an improved relation for the scattering length @xmath16 is discussed later [ compare with eq .",

    "we proceed to the one - loop calculation of the effective theory for the low - energy field by integrating out the high - energy field .",
    "analogously to the homogeneous case @xcite , we thus obtain an effective action of the form @xmath46 = s[\\phi _ { < } , \\phi_{<}^ { * } ] + { \\textstyle \\frac{1}{2 } } { \\rm tr}[\\ln(1 - \\hat{g}^ { > } \\hat{\\sigma } ) ] .",

    "this expansion is particularly well justified in the context of the rg procedure used here , because the self - energy is multiplied by the high - energy propagator which is inversely proportional to the largest energy scale of the system , the cutoff energy @xmath51 .",

    "( [ scaledbose ] ) must remain positive so that the particle density remains positive .",
    "the second difference is due to the fact that in the trapped case the energy spectrum is discrete . although we replaced the sum over @xmath30 by an integral over @xmath30 we kept the sums in the expression for @xmath131 of eq .",
