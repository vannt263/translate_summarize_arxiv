    "as it is expected , the large hadron collider ( lhc ) will be able to detect quantum gravitational effects .",
    "theoretically , the high - energy particle beam at the lhc can cool by boiling off gravitons into the extra space - like dimensions.@xcite more exotic gravitational objects , such as micro black holes , are assumed to be also produced at the tev energies ( see refs.@xcite and references therein ) . in fact the lhc can explore these additional dimensions through apparent breaking the energy conservation , as well as the appearance and disappearance of gravitons from extra dimensions as envisioned by the superstring theory .",
    "expectations to observe strongly gravitational effects at the tev energies mainly follow from ref.@xcite , where it is supposed that the electroweak scale @xmath1  gev is the only fundamental short distance scale in nature .",
    "if the gravity is unmodified down to the planck length , one might assume that the fundamental mass @xmath2 in @xmath3-dimensional theory is of @xmath4 order at the some value of @xmath5 ( the number of the compactified extra dimensions within the framework of kaluza - klein scenario ) . as is pointed out in ref.@xcite , to satisfy this requirement",
    ", parameter @xmath5 should be equal to 2 . at @xmath6 , the usual plank mass , @xmath7  gev ,",
    "is restored .",
    "moreover , such an approach allows one to determine the fundamental scale @xmath8 of extra dimensions : @xmath9    because the inverse square law of gravitational attraction has only been verified at distances greater than @xmath10  mm ( see ref.@xcite and references therein ) , it is now suggested that the huge disparity in interaction strengths is caused by the `` leaking '' of gravitational field into the extra dimensions which can be as large as @xmath10  mm without violating known laboratory , astrophysical , or cosmological data . in this picture , the particles and forces are confined to a 3-brane embedded into multi - dimensional universe , the only force in the higher - dimensional bulk is gravity .",
    "since there is no evidence of the presence of extra dimensions in low - energy ( classical and quantum ) processes , one can assume that an appearance of them is induced by the highly dense state of energy and matter like a thermalized quark - gluon plasma , predicted by quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "thus , the purpose of this paper is to determine the probability of creation of additional dimensions in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the mechanism of creation of extra dimensions can be divided in two steps : i ) generating the gravitational field in our three spatial dimensions by the matter source ; ii ) transferring the part of energy of this field component into the extra dimensions , where new ( extra ) modes of gravitational field arise .",
    "such a mechanism is similar to the transfer of the `` shaking '' ( deformation ) between slices within the elasticity theory .",
    "note that this analogy looks straightforward because there is mathematical relation between general relativity and elasticity theory.@xcite    here we develop the phenomenological model including the matter source , described by the bag model , and the gravitational field , represented by two scale factors reflecting two physically different groups of dimensions , the topology of which is fixed .",
    "the coupling constant ( gravitational constant in @xmath3-dimensional space - time ) in this model is defined from eq .",
    "( [ mass ] ) .",
    "although we will apply the methods and achievements of quantum cosmology , but there are several differences between it and our model . here",
    "we assume that the 4-dimensional universe already exists while the quantum cosmology is dealing with the creation and evolution of universe from `` nothing '' .",
    "let us focus on formulation of the model containing two interacting participants : gravitational field and the dense matter being in the quark - gluon phase . as usual",
    ", we will assume that the homogeneous and isotropic matter lives in 3-dimensional space while the gravitational field propagates in @xmath0 dimensions .",
    "of course , the one time - like evolution parameter is also presented in the model and is common for matter and field .",
    "we then can imagine that the dense matter , produced in nuclear collisions , plays the role of source of gravitational field in three dimensions , whose excitation induces an emergence of the gravitational field modes in extra dimensions , the number of which we would like to estimate .",
    "let the matter be concentrated in the fireball of radius @xmath11  fm , and all of three - dimensional phenomena under our consideration are carried out in the bulk of this region .",
    "the thermodynamic properties ( pressure @xmath12 and energy density @xmath13 ) of the quark - gluon phase are described within the framework of the bag model,@xcite taking into account only light quarks ( and gluons ) , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the temperature , @xmath16 is degeneracy factor , @xmath17  mev is the bag constant .    to evaluate the probability of creation of extra spatial dimensions , we should obviously to appeal to the quantum picture which provides the appropriate framework to reach this goal .",
    "more precisely , we should deal with the case of quantum gravity and/or cosmology in order to find quantum states of ( micro ) universe and to calculate an amplitude of transition between 3- and @xmath0-dimensional spaces .    here",
    "we will not account for the topology and geometry variations of extra space , which may emerge . even making use of the gravitational path integral ,",
    "the sum over all topologies is not computable , since there is no algorithm for deciding whether two @xmath0-dimensional manifolds have the same topology .",
    "moreover , there is the problem ( even in dimension two ) that there exist many more geometries of complicated topology than there exist of simple topology .",
    "it makes impossible to define the theory non - perturbatively in an unambiguous and physically satisfactory manner . in higher dimensions these problems",
    "are unmanagable . for these reasons",
    "we are forced to consider the model with the fixed topology of ( extra ) space , what allows us to apply canonical quantization of gravitational field .",
    "note that canonical quantization is useful for investigations of the system dynamics , although it requires to impose boundary conditions and to solve the problem of the operator ordering .",
    "these problems are general for quantum cosmology ( minisuperspace ) models , based on wheeler  dewitt equation , and have conceptual meaning in the context of the universe evolution understanding .",
    "coming back to the problem of fixing topology , let the extra dimensions be compactified and described by periodic variables @xmath18 , where @xmath8 is the fundamental length of the higher dimensional theory , @xmath19 .",
    "then extra @xmath5-dimensional manifold @xmath20 is compact and isomorphic to @xmath21    recall that in the original kaluza - klein models , space - time was taken to be , at least locally , a product manifold of the form @xmath22 , where @xmath20 is some compact `` internal space '' , in the first instance a circle .",
    "the effective space - time @xmath23 must thus be identified with the quotient of the higher dimensional space - time with respect to @xmath20 .    for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we can exploit a common scale factor , say @xmath24 , for additional dimensions .",
    "if @xmath25 , these dimensions are absent , and we concern with the theory in four - dimensional space - time . such an approximation does not permit us to investigate the geometry variations for the given topology . nevertheless , it may be effective if the sizes of dimensions are roughly of the same order .",
    "similarly , it is possible to introduce a common scale factor for our three dimensions . in the other words ,",
    "it means that the 3-space is supposed to be conformally flat and isotropic .    at @xmath26 , where the matter is highly dense ,",
    "the potentials of homogeneous gravitational field , @xmath27 and @xmath24 , are introduced as follows @xmath28 where we use the gauge - fixing condition ( @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the lapse function ) resulting in the formalism with `` hubble time '' .    on the other hand ,",
    "the metric becomes asymptotically minkowskian and @xmath6 ( and @xmath25 ) at @xmath31 .",
    "the quantum states of this model are described by wave function @xmath32 dependent on @xmath5 .",
    "therefore the amplitude of transition @xmath33 at the fixed @xmath24 , playing role of parameter , is defined as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the integration measure .",
    "having got the normalized wave function @xmath32 , we can also find more probable values of @xmath24 at the fixed @xmath27 and @xmath5 from the probability density profile , @xmath36    another possibility to describe extra dimensions consists in the finding of the wave function @xmath37 dependent on @xmath38 scale factors .",
    "such an approach could be used to study the different configurations ( geometries ) of @xmath0-dimensional space .",
    "however , we limit ourselves here by the simple case depicted before .",
    "in this section , starting from an action of relativistic system `` gravitational field+ideal fluid '' , we reformulate the dynamics in the terms of canonical variables needed for further canonical quantization .    as mentioned in previous section",
    ", we assume that the matter is located in the region of 3-dimensional space at @xmath26 . therefore there is the following energy conservation in three spatial dimensions : @xmath39 where the dot means derivative with respect to @xmath40 .    since the thermodynamic properties of the matter are described by eqs .",
    "( [ matter ] ) , resulting in equation of state , @xmath41 integrating eq .",
    "( [ law ] ) , one obtains that the dependence of the energy density @xmath13 on the scale factor is @xmath42 where @xmath43 , and the scale factor at @xmath44 is assumed to be @xmath45 .",
    "thus , the action functional of the ( quark - gluon ) ideal fluid in the rest frame of the matter is of the form : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the fireball volume .",
    "note that the successive derivation of @xmath48 can be done , for instance , by means of formalism elaborated in ref.@xcite    to write down the action functional for the gravitational field , we have to find the scalar curvature of @xmath3-dimensional space - time .",
    "the term containing the four - dimensional curvature is often missing from the action",
    ". however , in general , this term seems to be essential since it is generated as a quantum correction to the matter action .",
    "note that this quantum correction typically involves an infinite number of terms of higher order in curvature .",
    "nevertheless , these terms are completely suppressed in our consideration and the action functional is formulated in accordance with einstein .",
    "the non - vanishing cristoffel symbols of second kind are @xmath49 and the ricci scalar is presented in the following form : @xmath50=g[a , b]+\\frac{2}{a^3b^d}\\frac{d^2(a^3b^d)}{dt^2},\\ ] ] where one can ignore the last term in r.h.s . , resulting in total derivative with respect to evolution parameter .",
    "we have introduced the notation : @xmath51=-6\\frac{\\dot a^2}{a^2}-6d\\frac{\\dot a}{a}\\frac{\\dot b}{b}-d(d-1)\\frac{\\dot b^2}{b^2}.\\ ] ]    as was discussed above , the gravitational field is supposed to be homogeneous and non - trivial inside three - dimensional fireball while the metric in the space beyond fireball tends asymptotically to the usual minkowskian one ( without additional dimensions ) .",
    "therefore it is possible to limit the region of integration in the action functional by the volume filled by the quark - gluon matter .",
    "such an approximation means that we are neglecting by the surface contribution , where the gradient of pressure , gravitational potentials and curvature , in principal , can be large enough .",
    "this approximation is valid , if the profiles of matter distribution and scale factors are preserved .",
    "it is easy to understand that the matter distribution changes are related with longitudinal hydrodynamic waves , propagating with the sound speed @xmath52 .",
    "then the characteristic time of these changes can be evaluated as @xmath53  fm / c and is approximately equal to the life - time of fireball .",
    "therefore we conclude the time of process must be limited , @xmath54 .",

    "if it is possible to change @xmath5 continuously , the topology ( [ top ] ) of extra dimensions becomes also fractal .",
    "however , we will not discuss here aspects of the fractal topology construction .    in some cases of @xmath79 ,",
    "these equations can be solved exactly . however , since @xmath80 is quite large in our consideration , the quasiclassical wkb approximation is applicable enough .",
    "note also that , we are not imposing boundary conditions in our minisuperspace model .",
    "hence such a problem formulation can be treated as pseudo - euclidean analogy of the hartle  hawking `` no boundary '' proposal .    in the next subsections",
    "we will investigate the particular regimes of the bag model equation of state .",
