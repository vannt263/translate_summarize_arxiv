    "last decade results from the new facilities : very energetic radiation imaging telescope array system ( veritas ) and major atmospheric gamma - ray imaging cherenkov ( magic ) telescope have significantly stimulated an interest to vhe gamma ray observations .    in particular , the veritas collaboration has reported the pulsed gamma ray emission from the crab pulsar above @xmath1gev @xcite , which later have been confirmed by the magic observations @xcite .",
    "it is obvious that such energetic photons are emitted by vhe particles . on the other hand ,",
    "the pulsar magnetosphere is mainly composed of electron - positron pairs which , by means of the centrifugal mechanism of acceleration might achieve extremely high energies in the light cylinder area ( a hypothetical zone , where the linear velocity of rotation exactly equals the speed of light ) @xcite .",
    "usually , the major question which arises in the context of these observations is to understand and identify concrete mechanisms responsible for generation of vhe photons .",
    "in general , it is strongly believed that vhe gamma - rays are produced either by the inverse compton or by the curvature radiation mechanism .",
    "in particular , on the light cylinder surface in the magnetospheres of the crab - like pulsars the magnetic field is of the order of @xmath2 g , which efficiently suppresses the synchrotron mechanism of radiation .",
    "indeed , the cooling timescale for this process is given by @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the lorentz factor of an electron , @xmath5 is the electron s mass , @xmath6 is the speed of light , @xmath7 is the electron s synchrotron emission power , @xmath8 is the electron s charge and @xmath9 is the pitch angle .",
    "the above expression for @xmath10 applied to the relativistic electrons with @xmath11 @xcite for @xmath12 leads to the cooling timescale of the order of @xmath13s , which is by many orders of magnitude less than the kinematic timescale , or the escape timescale @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the light cylinder radius and @xmath16s is the crab pulsar s rotation period .",
    "this means that particles very rapidly transit to the ground landau states and as a result the emission process should damp .    in a series of papers @xcite",
    "the authors have shown that the pulsar magnetospheres might provide necessary conditions for keeping the pitch angles from damping , thus , maintaining the synchrotron mechanism .",
    "the major process responsible for keeping the synchrotron emission from damping is the qld . in particular , @xcite have shown that plasmas with strong magnetic field may generate very unstable cyclotron waves , which in turn , via the qld influence the particle distribution across the magnetic field lines @xcite .",
    "this process inevitably leads to the creation / maintaining of the pitch angles making the synchrotron radiation a working mechanism despite the efficient energy losses .",
    "another interesting feature of this mechanism is that the qld provides emission in two different frequency bands : one generated by the cyclotron modes and another produced directly by the synchrotron radiation .    in general , distribution of particles",
    "might be influenced not only by the cyclotron waves but also by the cherenkov - drift waves , finally driving the synchrotron process .",
    "in particular , in our recent work @xcite we have considered the synchrotron emission , generated by means of the feedback of cherenkov drift waves on the particle distribution in the active galactic nuclei . it has been argued that in the light cylinder area the cherenkov drift instability is strong enough to prevent the pitch angles from damping , keeping the synchrotron mechanism active and providing strongly correlated emission in different energy bands .    in the present paper",
    "we consider the crab - like pulsars and study the synchrotron process maintained by means of the qld driven by the cherenkov drift instability .",
    "the paper is arranged in the following way . in section  ii",
    ", we introduce the theory of the cherenkov driven synchrotron emission . in section  iii , we apply the model to crab - like millisecond pulsars and obtain results and in section  iv , we summarize them .",
    "in this section we consider the light cylinder area of magnetospheres of the crab - like pulsars and develop the model of synchrotron emission maintained by means of the feedback of the cherenkov drift instability .",
    "it is strongly believed that in the mentioned zone by means of a direct centrifugal mechanism of acceleration electrons might achieve lorentz factors of the order of @xmath17 @xcite . in the framework of the paper",
    "we suppose that the magnetospheric particles are distributed according to the fig .",
    "the distribution function is composed of two major parts .",
    "the narrower `` region '' represents the primary beam components and the wider `` area '' is a result of the pair cascading processes , which is considered in detail by @xcite . by @xmath18",
    "we indicate the lorentz factor of the beam component , @xmath19 is the lorentz factor of the tail and @xmath20 represents the lorentz factor in the wider `` section '' of the plot .    particles moving in a medium with curved magnetic field lines experience drift across the plane of the curvature and the corresponding velocity is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 represents the cyclotron frequency and @xmath23 is the curvature radius of the field line . from the above equation it is clear that for ultra relativistic electrons the drift velocity might become relativistic as well and as is shown by @xcite , under these circumstances",
    "the chdi arises with the following resonance condition @xmath24 where by @xmath25 and @xmath26 we denote the wave vector s and velocity s longitudinal ( along the magnetic field line ) components respectively and @xmath27 is the wave vector s component along the drift .",
    "according to the theory developed by @xcite the plasma component with the lorentz factor @xmath20 and the beam component with @xmath18 lead to the unstable cherenkov drift waves with the increment given by @xmath28 where by @xmath29 we denote the frequency of cherenkov emission , @xmath30 is the plasma frequency of the beam component and @xmath31 is the corresponding number density @xcite .    for considering the qld one has to note that it is governed by two forces .",
    "one is the synchrotron radiation reaction force with the following components @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are transversal and longitudinal components of momentum respectively and @xmath35 . on the other hand , the relativistic particles moving in a non uniform magnetic field experience another force responsible for the conservation of the adiabatic invariant @xmath36 .",
    "the corresponding components of this force are given by @xcite @xmath37 it can be shown that for relatively small pitch angles when the following condition @xmath38 is satisfied , the kinetic equation governing the qld writes as @xcite @xmath39\\textit{f } ^{0}\\right )      = \\frac{1}{p_{\\perp}}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_{\\perp}}\\left(p_{\\perp } d_{\\perp,\\perp}\\frac{\\partial\\textit{f } ^{0}}{\\partial p_{\\perp}}\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where by @xmath40 we denote the distribution function of electrons , @xmath41 is the transversal coefficient of diffusion and @xmath42 @xcite .    by combining eqs .",
    "( [ f],[hper ] ) and by taking into account that the pitch angle @xmath9 is given by @xmath43 one can derive for the typical parameters of crab - like pulsars the following relation between the corresponding components of the forces @xmath44 @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the pulsar s rotation period , @xmath47 is the modulus of its time derivative , @xmath48ss@xmath49 is the corresponding value for the crab pulsar and we have taken into account that the magnetic field has a dipolar behavior and close to the pulsar s surface its induction is given by @xmath50 g @xcite . from the above estimation it is clear that @xmath51 can be neglected for the realistic physical parameters .",
    "therefore eq . ( [ ratio ] ) for the stationary regime @xmath52 reduces to the equation @xmath53 with the following solution @xcite @xmath54 where @xmath55 since the particles are distributed with the transverse momentum , it is worthwhile to define the average value of the pitch angles @xmath56 leading to the following energy of synchrotron photons @xcite @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the gamma function .",
    "in this section we apply the theoretical model to the crab - like pulsars .",
    "since the qld is a result of the chdi , it is important to know how efficient is the corresponding process . by considering the so - called beam and plasma components , one obtains from eq .",
    "( [ incr ] ) @xmath59 it is clear that for the typical parameters of the crab - like pulsars the instability timescale @xmath60s , which is much less than the kinematic timescale , which indicates the high efficiency of the chdi , generating the relatively low energy photons with energies ( see eq .",
    "( [ om ] ) ) @xmath61    as we see , in the magnetospheres of crab - like pulsars the cherenkov drift resonance might lead to the hard @xmath0-rays . in the previous section",
    "we have seen that this emission inevitably leads to the non vanishing pitch angles ( see eq .",
    "( [ eps ] ) ) , generating the synchrotron emission . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show the behavior of energy of synchrotron photons , @xmath62 versus @xmath18 in the interval @xmath63\\times 10 ^ 7 $ ] for different values of lorentz factors of the plasma component : @xmath64 ( solid line ) , @xmath65 ( dashed line ) , @xmath66 ( dashed - dotted line ) .",
    "we have taken into account the dipolar character of the magnetic field , @xmath67 g @xcite , where @xmath68 cm is the neutron star s radius . the rest of the parameters is : @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the goldreich - julian number density @xcite . as it is evident from the plots by increasing @xmath20 , the resulting emission energy increases as well , which directly follows from the analytical behaviour , @xmath73 ( this can be seen by combining eqs .",
    "( [ dkoef],[pp0]-[eps ] ) ) .",
    "we see that the qld by means of the feedback of chdi guarantees the synchrotron emission over @xmath1gev .",
    "we can roughly estimate the possible vhe luminosity by multiplying the number of particles involved in the process with the single emission power , @xmath74 .",
    "it is worth noting that the thickness of the layer , @xmath75 , where the electrons accelerate to the highest energies , is of the order of @xmath76 .",
    "then , by taking into account the corresponding number of particles , @xmath77 , one can show that in the emission energy band @xmath78gev the highest energy electrons lead to the bulk luminosity of the order of @xmath79erg s@xmath49 which is in a good agreement with observations @xcite .",
    "an interesting feature of this mechanism is that the vhe radiation is strongly linked to the lower energy emission provided by the chdi . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show plots for @xmath80 for three values of the beam lorentz factors @xmath81 ( solid line ) , @xmath82 ( dashed line ) , @xmath83 ( dashed - dotted line ) .",
    "the set of the parameters is : @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath84 , @xmath68 cm and the plasma component lorentz factor varies in the interval @xmath85 $ ] .",
    "we see that for the mentioned physical parameters the cherenkov drift photons have energies in the interval @xmath86$]kev , which are strongly correlated with the vhe emission in the energy band @xmath87$]gev .",
    "it is interesting to study the generation of vhe synchrotron emission for a variety of crab - like pulsars . for this purpose in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we show the dependence of energy of synchrotron photons on pulsar s period for different values of @xmath20 : @xmath64 ( solid line ) , @xmath65 ( dashed line ) , @xmath66 ( dashed - dotted line ) .",
    "the set of the parameters is : @xmath88s$ ] , @xmath83 , @xmath70 , @xmath84 , @xmath68 cm . from the figure it is clear that depending on the period , for the above parameters , the synchrotron emission might provide energies up to @xmath89gev .",
    "the investigation shows that the crab - like pulsars might provide vhe synchrotron radiation strongly connected with the cherenkov drift emission .",
    "the main aspects of the present work can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "we have studied the vhe synchrotron emission process driven by the feedback of the chdi on the distribution function of electrons in the crab - like pulsars .",
    "2 .   considering the two component magnetospheric plasmas ,",
    "we have developed the analytical model for studying the qld . for this purpose the kinetic equation governing the mentioned process has been applied and analysed for the light cylinder zone . it has been found that under certain conditions the chdi is very efficient , resulting in the creation of the pitch angles , which in turn prevents the synchrotron mechanism from damping despite the strong magnetic field .",
    "3 .   analyzing the radiation mechanism versus several physical parameters , we have shown that the crab - like pulsars might provide synchrotron photons with @xmath1s of gev strongly correlated with the cherenkov drift emission from the extreme uv ( @xmath90ev ) to the hard @xmath0-rays ( @xmath91kev ) .",
