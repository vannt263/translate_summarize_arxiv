    "the central point of these lectures is the availability of a field theoretical framework for the strong interactions .",
    "it is the nonabelian gauge theory based on the color symmetry group @xmath0 with @xmath1 = 3 .",
    "this theory , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) underlies the strong interactions of which the existence is known since the thirties . at that time the goal was to understand the forces in the atomic nucleus .",
    "the experimental results of many experiments revealed the existence of a rich spectrum of hadrons , baryons and mesons .",
    "the presence of these excitation spectra and also explicit measurements of the charge and current distributions of the hadrons revealed the composite nature of hadrons .",
    "the quark model brought some order into this situation , describing baryons as composite systems of three valence quarks and mesons as a composite system of a valence quark and antiquark .",
    "valence refers here to the fact that these quarks are the contributors to the quantum numbers ( upness , downness , strangeness , etc . ) of the hadrons .",
    "the symmetry considerations based on flavor @xmath2 and flavor - spin @xmath3 are the basis of the success of the quark model . color was introduced in a rather early stage to solve a number of problems such as the fermion statistics of the quarks .",
    "the experimental results of the slac - mit deep inelastic electron scattering experiments , which indicated the existence of hard point - like constituents in the nucleon and the field - theoretical developments in nonabelian gauge theories , specifically the notion of asymptotic freedom and the proof of renormalizability , led to the natural emergence of qcd as the theory for the strong interactions between the quarks and gluons .",
    "the important feature of qcd is the fact that the force becomes weaker at short distances .",
    "this anti - screening behavior or asymptotic freedom is a unique feature of non - abelian gauge theories .",
    "qcd is part of the standard model that describes the strong and electroweak forces .",
    "all forces in the standard model are described within the framework of nonabelian gauge theories , based on a gauge symmetry . for testing directly qcd ,",
    "one preferably avoids the presence of hadrons , as these constitute complex bound state systems .",
    "useful scattering processes for this purpose are    aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabbbbbbbb @xmath4 ( inclusive annihilation ) , + @xmath5 jets ( jet production ) , + @xmath6 ( inclusive leptoproduction ) .    analyzing jets produced in @xmath7 scattering represent , modulo complications arising from hadronization , hard scattering processes @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9 , @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath10 , etc . for these processes perturbative qcd can be used to do reliable calculations .",
    "similarly one can use perturbative qcd to study the @xmath11 dependence of the elementary @xmath12 @xmath8 @xmath13 cross sections that are important in leptoproduction .",
    "the properties of hadrons are poorly described directly starting from qcd .",
    "they require a nonperturbative approach in quantum field theory .",
    "this has led to the use of models that incorporate some features like confinement and asymptotic freedom and symmetries of the underlying theory , such as quark potential models , bag models or chiral models .",
    "most promising from a fundamental point of view are lattice gauge approaches .    controlling and selectively probing the nonperturbative regime in high energy scattering processes is the key to study the structure of hadrons in the context of qcd .",
    "the control parameters for the target and the probe are the spin and flavor , which in combination with the kinematical flexibility in scattering processes is used to select the observable and its gluonic or quarkic nature .",
    "examples are    aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa = bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb = cccccccccccc @xmath14 ( elastic leptoproduction ) ( spacelike ) form factors , + @xmath15 ( inclusive leptoproduction ) distribution functions , + @xmath16 ( 1-particle inclusive distribution and + leptoproduction ) fragmentation functions , + @xmath17 ( annihilation into @xmath18 ) ( timelike ) form factors , + @xmath19 ( 1-particle inclusive fragmentation functions , + annihilation ) + @xmath20 ( drell - yan scattering ) distribution functions .",
    "these notes consist of two parts . after this introduction",
    "we discuss the basic formalism to deal with the beforementioned processes , introducing the hadron tensor , form factors , structure functions .",
    "these are needed to write down general expressions for the electroweak cross sections .",
    "the second part reviews the introduction of parton distribution and fragmentation functions that enable a systematic treatment of the structure functions at high energies and/or momentum transfer .",
    "for the process @xmath21 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] ) , the cross section can be separated into a lepton and hadron part .",

    "we have omitted target mass effects of order @xmath36 .      in order to write down the cross section",

    "we have included here the ( longitudinal ) lepton polarization ( @xmath37 ) . for later convenience",
    "it is useful to rewrite this tensor also in terms of the space - like and time - like vectors @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "it is a straightforward exercise to get k^= q^+ t^+ ^ , where @xmath40 is the perpendicular direction defining the lepton scattering plane ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this perpendicular direction becomes relevant only if other vectors than @xmath29 and @xmath28 are present , e.g. a spin direction in polarized scattering or the momentum of a produced hadron in 1-particle inclusive processes .",

    "the use of polarization in leptoproduction provides new ways to probe the hadron target . for a spin 1/2 particle",
