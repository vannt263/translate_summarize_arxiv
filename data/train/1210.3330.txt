    "this is two orders of magnitude lower than the flux of the agn and about fifty times lower than that of the soft component detected in the _ xmm - newton_data in the 0.32 kev range .",
    "it therefore seems most likely that the variability we have observed is intrinsic to the agn and is simply an unexplained facet of the soft excess .",
    "a weakening or strengthening of the soft excess has been seen in other agns , however in most cases it also involved a change in flux state .",
    "for example , markowitz & reeves ( 2009 ) reported that ngc 4593 had a soft excess that weakened by a factor of 20 between an _ xmm - newton _   observation and a _ suzaku _",
    "observation 5 years later which caught the source in a low hard x - ray flux state .",
    "however , it has been observed that variations in the soft excess can be independent of those in the hard power - law ( e.g. , edelson et al .",
    "2002 ) , suggesting the possibility of independent physical mechanisms at work",
    ". we can rule out blurred reflection from an ionized medium ( such as the reflion model from ross & fabian 2005 ) as a source of the soft excess in this case since our _ suzaku_data clearly show reflection but no soft excess .",
    "a simple blackbody soft excess component provides a good fit to the _ xmm - newton_data , however this model has been shown to clash with theoretical predictions for disk temperatures ( e.g. gierliski & done 2006 ) .    a recent _ xmm - newton _   monitoring campaign of mkn 509 by mehdipour et al .",

    "mehdipour et al .",
    "( 2011 ) were able to successfully apply models describing the soft excess as being produced by thermal comptonization by a warm ( 0.2 kev ) optically thick ( @xmath70 ) corona surrounding the inner regions of the disk .",
    "this is an important result that may reveal a long sought - after link between the x - ray spectral properties of a source and the optical / uv thermal accretion disk emission and could explain the extreme behavior in mkn  590 . if a soft excess was present in the past and has recently vanished , then we would expect to see a significant drop in the uv flux of this source if this link exists .",
    "unfortunately , there was no optical / uv observation simultaneous with the _ suzaku_observation .",
    "future monitoring of this source with simultaneous uv and x - ray instruments would be required to confirm or exclude this hypothesis .",
    "further monitoring would also add to the small but growing number of observations tracking variations in the soft excess that are independent of variations displayed by the hard x - ray coronal power law .",
    "mehdipour et al .",
    "( 2011 ) found a variability range of 11.7@xmath71 erg s@xmath10 for mkn 509 over the course of 36 days .",

    "edelson et al .  ( 2002 ) noted a qualitatively similar trend for the nlsy1 ton s180 with systematic trends on timescales of days  weeks in the soft band independent of variations exhibited above 2 kev .",
    "it should be noted that since both ark 564 and ton s180 are narrow line seyferts they are likely in a different luminosity regime ( relative to eddington ) and may be experiencing different physical processes , particularly with regards to the compton up - scattered component of the soft excess ( done et al .",
    "2012 ) and direct comparison with these objects should be done with caution .",
    "nevertheless , understanding how the soft excess varies over a range of timescales could help pin down the source of this feature .",

    "<S> the compton reflection strength was measured to be in the range 0.21.0 depending on the model used . </S>",
    "<S> a moderately strong fe k@xmath0emission line was detected with an equivalent width of @xmath1120@xmath2 ev and an fe k@xmath3line was identified with an equivalent width of @xmath130@xmath4 ev , although we could not rule out contribution from ionized fe emission at this energy . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , we found no evidence for soft excess emission . comparing our results with a 2004 observation from _ xmm - newton_we found that either the soft excess has decreased by a factor of 2030 in 7 years or the photon index has steepened by 0.10 ( with no soft excess present ) while the continuum flux in the range 210 kev has varied only minimally ( 10% ) . </S>",
    "<S> this result could support recent claims that the soft excess is independent of the x - ray continuum . </S>"
