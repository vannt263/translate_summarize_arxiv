    "an analogous situation occurs when we deal with the ( 2 + 1 ) dirac equation , therefore one has to apply numerical and approximate techniques in order to compute the energy spectrum and the corresponding wave functions .    in order to compute the energy spectrum of the relativistic hydrogen atom we have at our disposal different numerical and semi - analytic methods . the kato and and lehman - maelhy methods",

    "unfortunately , just like in the non - relativistic@xcite and klein - gordon@xcite cases , the quasiexactly solvable energies do not correspond to the ground state .    since the energy spectrum for the ground state , in the pure magnetic field regime does not depend on @xmath63 ( [ energyo ] ) , the variational energy slightly deviates from the numerical value for strong magnetic fields . regarding the methods and results presented in this article we have to emphasize that we do not require any special identification between small and large components of the dirac spinor , a condition that is present in most of the alternative variational methods available in the literature .",
    "the electromagnetic configuration given by eq.([5 ] ) presents the interesting feature of combining a coulomb potential with a magnetic field in a way that makes unsuitable a single trial - function approach .",
    "the accuracy of the mixed - basis approach can be improved when one uses a many - terms basis , nevertheless this one introduces higher order @xmath55 matrices and further complications in the computation of the energy eigenvalues .",
    "regarding the range of validity of variational and non relativistic approximation , we have that both methods give very good results for values of @xmath102 , which correspond , for the hydrogen atom , to @xmath103 g , a value that is far from the values of @xmath63 that one create in a laboratory@xcite",
    ".    however strong fields can be mimicked in nanomaterials like gaas or insb with very small effective masses , where the methods and techniques of quantum effects in the presence of strong fields can be applied @xcite . in this physical scenario",
