    "recently , it has been suggested that the change of behaviour of the missing energy density might be controlled by the change in the equation of state of the background fluid instead of the form of the potential , avoiding in this way fine - tuning problems @xcite . in the framework of friedmann - robertson - walker cosmology ,",
    "this is achieved considering an exotic background fluid , the chaplygin gas , described by the equation of state    @xmath7    with @xmath8 and a a positive constant .",
    "introducing this equation of state into the equation resulting from the covariant conservation of the energy - momentum tensor for an homogeneous and isotropic spacetime , leads to a density evolving as    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the scale factor of the universe and @xmath11 an integration constant .",
    "it is remarkable that this simple model smoothly interpolates between a dust dominated phase where @xmath12 and a de sitter phase where @xmath13 , through an intermediate regime described , for @xmath14 , by the equation of state for stiff matter , @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "it is interesting that the chaplygin gas admits a brane interpretation as eq .",
    "( [ eqstate ] ) , with @xmath14 , is the equation of state associated with the parametrization invariant nambu - goto @xmath16-brane action in a @xmath17 spacetime .",
    "this action leads , in the light - cone parametrization , to the galileo - invariant chaplygin gas in a @xmath18 spacetime and to the poincar - invariant born - infeld action in a @xmath18 spacetime ( see @xcite and references therein ) .    in what follows we discuss the results of our research on the generalized chaplygin gas with @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "we consider , as first discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the lagrangian density for a massive complex scalar field , @xmath19 , @xmath20 this scalar field , with mass @xmath21 , can be expressed as @xmath22 .",
    "so that , on the mass shell , @xmath30 . hence , the energy - momentum tensor built from the lagrangian density eq .",

    "( [ pardensity ] ) , ( [ parpressure ] ) and ( [ phidens ] ) into the lagrangian density ( [ thomas - fermi ] ) , shows that it is possible to establish a brane connection to this model , as the resulting lagrangian density has the form of a _ generalized _ born - infeld theory :                            where @xmath44 is given by eq .",
    "( [ genevolden ] ) , @xmath45 is the density contrast . using the perturbed friedmann equations , and the unperturbed raychaudhuri equations , we have solved @xmath45 @xcite as a function of @xmath10 for different values of @xmath46 which we have plotted in figure [ fig : pert ] .",
    "hence , we verify for any @xmath46 the claim of refs .",
    "@xcite , for @xmath14 , that the density contrast decays for large @xmath10 .",
    "figure [ fig : pert ] also shows the main difference in behaviour of the density contrast between a universe filled with matter with a `` soft '' or `` stiff '' equations of state as the former resembles more closely the @xmath47cdm .",
    "research on further observational implications of our results is under way and will be presented elsewhere ."
