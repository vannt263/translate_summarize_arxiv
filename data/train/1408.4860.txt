    "main - belt comets ( mbcs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are objects that exhibit cometary activity as a result of the sublimation of volatile ice , yet occupy stable orbits in the main asteroid belt .",
    "they have attracted interest , particularly in astrobiology , due to the possibility that icy material from the main belt region could have been a significant primordial source of terrestrial water ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and their potential as compositional probes of the early inner solar system in general ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "mbcs comprise a subset of the group of objects known as active asteroids , which are objects with asteroidal orbits ( defined as having tisserand parameter values of @xmath9 ) that exhibit comet - like activity , typically in the form of dust emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the classification of active asteroids also includes disrupted asteroids ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , which are otherwise inert objects that exhibit comet - like mass loss as a result of collisional or rotational disruption ( cf .",
    "* ) .    in general",
    ", direct confirmation of mbc sublimation via spectroscopic detections of gas emission is beyond the capabilities of current facilities due to the extremely weak sublimation rates of these objects . practically speaking",
    ", this inability to directly detect sublimation means that none of the objects currently considered to be mbcs can be definitively confirmed as cometary bodies .",
    "however , @xcite outlined a range of methods that can be used to infer the most likely cause of observed dust emission , and therefore distinguish likely mbc candidates ( hereafter referred to simply as `` mbcs '' ) and disrupted asteroid candidates ( hereafter , `` disrupted asteroids '' ) .",
    "these methods include monitoring to search for persistent or increasing activity ( although this condition alone is insufficient proof of sublimation - driven activity without other supporting evidence ) , deep high - resolution imaging to search for unusual morphology that could indicate the action of non - cometary causes of activity , numerical dust modeling , and long - term monitoring to search for repeated activity over multiple orbits , which is naturally explained as a result of sublimation - driven activity , but would be highly implausible for activity generated via other mechanisms .",
    "detection of recurrent activity is currently considered to be the most reliable method of indirectly identifying sublimation - driven activity ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    ". however , making such a detection requires waiting for at least an entire orbit period ( @xmath105 - 6 years for most of the currently known mbcs ) , and potentially more depending on observational circumstances , to elapse following the discovery of activity in a new mbc before repetition of activity can be confirmed or ruled out .",
    "as such , recurrent activity has only been successfully confirmed to date for mbcs 133p / elst - pizarro and 238p / read @xcite , although unsuccessful attempts to detect recurrent activity for mbc 176p / linear have also been made @xcite .    while even recurrent activity",
    "does not ensure that any observed activity is actually sublimation - driven , the recent spectroscopic confirmation of water vapor outgassing on ( 1 ) ceres by the _ herschel space observatory _",
    "@xcite has unequivocally demonstrated that currently sublimating icy material is in fact present in the main asteroid belt .",
    "this water vapor detection strongly supports the physical plausibility of sublimation - driven cometary activity on other main - belt objects , such as the mbcs .",
    "additionally , spectroscopic features attributed to water ice frost have been reported for main - belt asteroid ( 24 ) themis @xcite and outer main - belt asteroid ( 65 ) cybele @xcite .",
    "these results are particularly interesting in the context of this work because mbcs 133p , 176p , 288p , and possibly 238p @xcite have all been dynamically linked to the themis asteroid family , of which themis is the largest member . despite these recent discoveries of corroborating evidence of water ice in the asteroid belt ,",
    "however , it is important to note that ceres ( 952 km in diameter * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , themis ( 202 km in diameter ; * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and cybele ( 273 km in diameter ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are all much larger than the largest known mbcs ( cf .",
    "section  [ section : mbc_comparison ] ) and therefore likely differ significantly from the mbcs in both their thermal evolutionary history and present - day geophysical nature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as such , any comparisons between such large asteroids and the km - scale mbcs must be regarded with caution .",
    "the fifth mbc to be discovered was comet p/2010 r2 ( la sagra ) , which was found on 2010 september 14.9 ( ut ) by the 0.45  m telescope at la sagra observatory in southern spain @xcite .",
    "numerical modeling of the object s dust emission indicated that the observed mass loss was best simulated by anistropic comet - like dust emission at a level of @xmath103 - 4  kg  s@xmath11 persisting for at least 7 months following perihelion , with the apparent source of emission located near the south pole of the nucleus and the object having an obliquity near 90@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "additional analysis of precovery and follow - up observations revealed an increase of @xmath131  mag in the comet s brightness between 2010 august and december , indicating the presence of ongoing dust production , consistent with sublimation - driven activity and inconsistent with impulsive activity generation mechanisms such as an impact @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic observations produced no evidence of gas emission , but were still used to place an upper limit on the comet s cn production rate of @xmath14  mol  s@xmath11 . assuming average cn / h@xmath15o ratios measured for previously observed comets @xcite , this result corresponds to an upper limit h@xmath15o production rate of @xmath16  mol  s@xmath11 .",
    "thermal modeling by @xcite indicates that all other volatile material except for water ice may become severely depleted over the lifetime of a mbc , however , suggesting that the ratio of cn to h@xmath15o in mbcs may be much lower than in classical comets from the outer solar system .",
    "if this is true , then the upper limits on the h@xmath15o production rates of p / la sagra and other mbcs inferred from observations of cn emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) may in fact be far larger than reported .",
    "@xcite additionally reported that numerical dynamical simulations of the object indicated that the region in orbital element space occupied by p / la sagra is largely stable , despite being crossed by the 13:6 mean - motion resonance with jupiter and the @xmath17 three - body mean - motion resonance with jupiter and saturn .",
    "these results imply that the object is likely to be native to its present - day location , and that its physical properties therefore may be similar of those of other objects in that region of the asteroid belt .",
    "however , given the moderately chaotic nature of the region ( due to the presence of nearby resonances ) and the possibility of the influence of non - gravitational forces ( which were not included in the dynamical analysis ) , the possibility that p / la sagra could have formed elsewhere and recently dynamically evolved onto its current orbit could not be definitively ruled out .",
    "in fact , preliminary results from dynamical simulations including the yarkovsky effect @xcite indicate that yarkovsky - induced drift of the semimajor axis of p / la sagra ( estimated to be on the order of @xmath18  au  myr@xmath11 ) could indeed affect its long - term dynamical stability @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , non - gravitational accelerations as large as @xmath19  m  s@xmath20 have been inferred for 133p based on astrometric measurements @xcite , though the effect of non - gravitational accelerations of this magnitude on the dynamical stability of mbcs has not yet been well - studied .",
    "the physical characterization of the nuclei of individual mbcs and mbc candidates that have been previously observed to be active is extremely important for improving our understanding of how the active mbc population relates to the inactive background population .",
    "physical studies of mbc nuclei indicate what characteristics dormant mbcs might have , allowing us to better estimate the size of the population of inactive but icy asteroids , constrain thermal modeling studies of mbcs aimed at better understanding volatile preservation in small inner solar system bodies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and enable quantitative analyses of total dust productivity and photometric searches for low - level activity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". physical characterization of mbc activity is also important for improving our understanding of other characteristics of the population , such as peak activity levels , typical duration of activity , and relative activity strength levels from one orbit to the next , that could ultimately shed light on key issues such as potential mechanisms for producing and sustaining activity , the degree of variation in volatile content within the mbc population , and prospects for using mbcs as tracers of the abundance and distribution of ice in the present - day asteroid belt . with these issues in mind",
    ", we set out in this work to measure the size of p / la sagra s nucleus and analyze previously reported data obtained when p / la sagra was active in order to quantitatively characterize its activity strength and compare it to other mbcs .",
    "we observed p / la sagra using the 8.1  m gemini north telescope ( programs gn-2011b - q-17 and gn-2013a - q-102 ) on mauna kea in hawaii .",
    "observations were made using the imaging mode of the gemini multi - object spectrograph ( gmos ; image scale of @xmath21  pixel@xmath11 ; * ? ? ? * ) and a sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xmath22 filter .",
    "non - sidereal tracking at the apparent rate and direction of motion of p / la sagra on the sky was used for all observations .",

    ", width=576 ]    intriguingly , there is a clear trend of increasing peak @xmath24 values with decreasing nucleus radius ( figure  [ figure : size_vs_activity]a , upper panel ) .",
    "the cause of this trend is evident from the lower panel of figure  [ figure : size_vs_activity]a , where we can see that while the minimum and maximum @xmath24 values measured for mbcs differ by over three orders of magnitude , @xmath25 values vary by less than two orders of magnitude , or if a single outlier ( p / la sagra ) is removed from consideration , less than one order of magnitude . as such ,",
    "the strong anti - correlation of @xmath24 with nucleus size is due nearly entirely to the fact that almost all of the mbcs appear to eject nearly identical quantities of dust , despite varying by nearly three orders of magnitude in volume ( and therefore in inferred mass ) .",
    "this consistency among the inferred total dust masses measured for the first five known mbcs was first noted in @xcite , and so it is interesting that it appears to remain viable for the present sample of seven of the eight currently known mbcs . as noted by @xcite , however , the interpretation of this trend is not straightforward .",
    "the total dust mass observed for each object is essentially the net dust production rate ( i.e. , the difference between the mass loss rate of the nucleus and the rate at which the ejected dust is dispersed by radiation pressure to the point of non - detectability ) integrated over the period starting from the start of dust emission until the time of observation , where in principle , the mass loss rate of the nucleus is related to the effective size of the active area on the mbc ( i.e. , the area of exposed volatile material available for sublimation ) .",
    "however , a large mass loss rate could be coupled with a rapid dust dissipation rate to produce the same net dust production rate ( and therefore the same total observed dust mass ) as an object with a smaller mass loss rate coupled with a slower dust dissipation rate . since the known mbcs",
    "are all observed to be active at similar heliocentric distances , one might expect dissipation rates to also be similar .",
    "other factors can also affect dust observability , however .",
    "for instance , dust confined to an object s orbit plane will have a greater optical depth when viewed edge - on than when viewed at a non - zero angle to the orbit plane . therefore ,",
    "dust emitted from a low - inclination mbc ( such as 133p or 176p ; @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively ) should remain observable for a longer period of time than dust from a high - inclination mbc ( such as p / la sagra or 259p ; @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively ) .",
    "given the numerous factors that can influence the observed appearance of dust emission , numerical dust modeling is typically employed to infer properties of interest , such as ejection velocities and mass loss rates .",
    "the determination of the dust production rate of a mbc in this manner , though , is highly parameter - dependent , where final results can vary widely due to different assumptions of parameters such as the optically dominant grain size and bulk densities of nucleus and dust material . converting dust production rates to sublimation rates and then to an active surface area",
    "is also complicated by such factors as the typical lack of observational constraints on gas - to - dust ratios and the thermal parameters of the surface material in question , the possible action of jets ( cf .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the time - dependent activity - quenching effects of mantling ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "finally , it is possible that the apparent trend of similar dust masses is an observational selection effect , and that mbcs exhibiting smaller total dust masses are simply not easily discovered by currently available facilities ( even though lower levels of activity can be observed once an object is known to be active and is therefore specifically targeted for monitoring ) .    despite the many caveats that must be considered , for reference",
    ", we follow the procedure used by @xcite to compute the area - dependent sublimation rates of surface ice at perihelion for the known mbcs , and then compare them to available reported mass loss rates @xcite , to compute equivalent active areas and active fractions ( table  [ table : mbcdata ] ) . finally , we plot these values as functions of nucleus radius in figure  [ figure : size_vs_activity]b . for these calculations",
    ", we use the following energy balance equation for the equilibrium temperature , @xmath30 , of a sublimating surface : @xmath31\\ ] ] where @xmath32  w  m@xmath20 is the solar constant , @xmath33 is the heliocentric distance of the object in au , @xmath34 is the assumed bond albedo of the body , @xmath35 is the assumed effective infrared emissivity , @xmath36 is the stefan - boltzmann constant , @xmath37  mj  kg@xmath11 is the latent heat of sublimation for water ice , @xmath38 is the temperature - dependent mass loss rate of water ice due to sublimation , and @xmath39 describes the distribution of solar heating over an object s surface , assumed here to be @xmath40 ( between the so - called subsolar and isothermal extremes of @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively ) .",
    "we then compute the active surface area needed to produce the model - determined mass loss rates using @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the dust - to - gas production rate ratio ( by mass ) . dust - to - gas ratios of @xmath45 are often assumed for comets , but as discussed in @xcite , values of @xmath46 are physically possible when ejected dust carrying more mass than escaping gas travels at much slower velocities than the gas , thus conserving momentum . like p / la sagra , 2p",
    "/ encke has been observed to exhibit dust emission determined to be dominated by mm - sized grains , and ultraviolet and infrared observations have constrained its dust - to - gas ratio to @xmath47 @xcite . for our analysis here , we assume @xmath48 ( cf . * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "finally , we compute the active surface fraction using @xmath49    we find that all of the inferred active surface areas computed here are within two orders of magnitude of each other , suggesting that if impact activation is indeed responsible for mbc activity ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the active areas on all of the mbcs considered here could have been excavated by similarly sized impactors .",
    "meanwhile , we note that 133p , 238p , p/2006 vw@xmath23 , and p/2012 t1 have similar inferred active surface fractions within an order of magnitude , while p / la sagra s active fraction is about an order of magnitude larger than those of the other mbcs , and 176p s active fraction is roughly an order of magnitude smaller .",
    "the active surface areas and active surface fractions inferred here are also all at least an order of magnitude smaller than those of the vast majority of classical comets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although mbc perihelion distances are also all generally larger than those of most jupiter family and long - period comets that are observed .",
    "considering the numerous caveats detailed above , we consider a more detailed investigation of the particular implications of the inferred active areas and active fractions of mbcs to be premature , but suggest that continued attention to inferred active surface areas as more mbcs are discovered and physically characterized could provide valuable insights into the origin and evolution of mbc activity .      as discussed above ( section  [ section : background ] ) , the detection of recurrent activity for a main - belt object during subsequent orbit passages is currently considered one of the most reliable indicators of sublimation - driven activity @xcite .",
    "p / la sagra will make its first return to perihelion since its 2010 discovery on 2015 november 30 , and so monitoring of the object around that time will be extremely important for clarifying the nature of its activity .",
    "fortunately , unlike 259p , which had limited visibility during its first post - discovery perihelion passage in 2013 january 25 @xcite , p / la sagra will be well - placed for observations to search for recurrent activity during its upcoming perihelion passage .",

    "it then will be observable from the north again from 2016 june to 2017 march over a true anomaly range of @xmath54 .",
    "due to its extremely northerly declination ( @xmath55 ) in during the 2016 - 2017 observing window , however , it will not be well - placed for observing from the south during this time period .    for reference",

    "we note though that we do not expect activity to be limited to that range .",
    "p / la sagra was observed to be active as early as @xmath56 during its 2010 active period @xcite , which it will reach again on 2016 january 20 .",
    "however , considering that the comet was already strongly active at the time of its discovery , and that 133p and 238p have both been observed to exhibit pre - perihelion activity , we expect that a much earlier turn - on point for p / la sagra could be possible .",
    "@xcite reported that _ wide - field infrared survey explorer _ observations of p / la sagra from 2010 june 9 - 11 , when the object was at @xmath57 , showed no clear evidence of activity , but this non - detection could be attributable to insufficient image sensitivity .",
    "238p was observed to be active as early as @xmath58 @xcite , which p / la sagra will reach on 2015 april 19 .",
    "as such , monitoring p / la sagra starting at least this early would be highly desirable . in that regard ,",
    "the nucleus size determination for the comet reported here will be extremely useful , as it will enable early detection of activity to be accomplished via photometric analysis even if resolved activity is not immediately observable .    some deviations ( which should average to zero for a sufficiently large data set ) from the magnitude predictions plotted in figure  [ figure : magnitude_predictions ] are expected due to rotational brightness variations of the nucleus . however , photometric measurements made for the comet that are consistently brighter than expected will represent strong evidence for the presence of unresolved activity .",
    "analogous analyses were used to discover the activity of 95p/(2060 ) chiron @xcite , detect the reactivation of 67p / churyumov - gerasimenko in 2007 @xcite , and to confirm the absence of recurrent activity for 176p in 2011 @xcite .",
    "if resolved cometary activity is immediately observable , use of this technique of using photometry to detect activity will of course be unnecessary . in this case",
    ", however , it will still be useful to monitor p / la sagra through both observing windows shown in figure  [ figure : magnitude_predictions ] and determine the amount of dust present at any given time ( using the nucleus size measured in this work ) . doing so will enable us to monitor changes over time and also to enable comparisons to be made between p / la sagra s activity strength over successive orbit passages , which will in turn allow us to better understand the rate of mbc devolatization and set limits on their active lifetimes .",

    "following its 2010 september discovery , p / la sagra continued to exhibit a dust trail , likely composed of large dust particles remaining from the 2010 active period , as late as 2011 december 31 , when the comet was at @xmath59 .",
    "no activity was observed by the time of our next observations on 2013 march 3 , when the comet was at @xmath60 , or just before aphelion . using only photometry measured when the comet was observed to be inactive , we find best - fit iau phase function parameters of @xmath0  mag and @xmath1 , corresponding to an effective nucleus radius of @xmath2  km ( assuming @xmath3 ) .",

    "<S> we also compute the inferred peak total active surface area and active surface fraction for p / la sagra , finding @xmath6  m@xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively . finally , we discuss p / la sagra s upcoming perihelion passage , particularly focusing on the available opportunities to conduct follow - up observations in order to search for recurrent activity and , if recurrent activity is present , to search for changes in p / la sagra s activity strength on successive orbit passages that should provide insights into the evolution of mbc activity over time . </S>",
