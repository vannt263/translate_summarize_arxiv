    "excitation of solar - type oscillations is attributed to turbulent movements in the outer convective zone of intermediate mass stars .",
    "accurate measurement of the rate @xmath0 at which acoustic energy is injected into such oscillations will be possible with the future seismic missions ( e.g. corot and eddington ) .",
    "comparison between measured and theoretical values of @xmath0 obtained with different models of turbulent convection will then provide valuable information about the properties of stellar convection zones .",
    "models for stochastic excitation have been proposed by several authors ( e.g. ; ; ) . in the present work ,",
    "we consider the formulation of @xcite ( 2001 , paper  i hereafter ) .",
    "constraints on the time averaged properties of the solar turbulent medium are obtained from a 3d simulation .",
    "they allow us to compute @xmath0 and compare it with solar seismic observations and results obtained with s formulation of the mixing - length theory ( gmlt hereafter ) .",
    "according to paper  i , the rate at which a given mode with frequency @xmath5 is excited can be written as : @xmath6 in eq .",

    "expressions for @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath13 are given in paper  i.    the driving sources @xmath24 and @xmath25 include the turbulent kinetic energy spectrum @xmath26 , the turbulent spectrum of the entropy fluctuations @xmath27 and @xmath28 the frequency - dependent part of the turbulent spectra which model the correlation time - scale of an eddy with wavenumber @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath28 is modeled here with a non - gaussian function constraint from the 3d simulation .",
    "we consider a 3d simulation of the upper part of the solar convective zone as obtained by .",

    "the simulation data are used to determine the quantities @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath22 , @xmath31 and @xmath18 involved in the theoretical expressions for @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath0 .",

    "the value of the mixing - length parameter , @xmath42 , is imposed by a solar calibration of the 1d gmlt model . the value of @xmath43 -  hence of @xmath44  - is obtained from the 3d simulation .",
    "the above analytical @xmath29-dependency of @xmath45 and @xmath46 reproduce the global features of @xmath45 and @xmath47 derived from the 3d simulation .",

    "we then assume two different values for @xmath18 : @xmath48 ( * dot dashed curves * ) and @xmath49 ( * dashed curves * ) . the value @xmath48 used in the gmlt model provides the best fit between computed solar damping rates and the measured ones by .    without any adjustement of scaling parameters and instead using all the constraints inferred from the 3d simulation",
    ", we find a maximum of @xmath0 much larger ( @xmath2 times larger ) than is obtained using a 1d gmlt solar model with @xmath50 .",
    "this difference is mainly due to the assumed value for @xmath18 in the excitation region . indeed ,",

    "when @xmath49 is used to compute the excitation rate with the gmlt model , @xmath0 comes close to @xmath0 calculated with the 3d simulation constraints .",
    "our result then shows that the values of @xmath18 found for the solar gmlt model when adjusted on the damping rates is not compatible with the actual properties of turbulent medium in the excitation region .",
    "an improvement could come from a consistent calculation which would assume a depth dependent @xmath52 , as suggested by the simulation , in both damping and excitation rates computation .",
    "our calculations using the 3d constraints bring @xmath4 , the @xmath0 maximum , closer to the solar seismic measurements but still under - estimates them by a factor @xmath53 .",
    "more sophisticated assumptions for @xmath54 and @xmath55 will likely lead to a better agreement with the observations .",
    "we consider two sets of stellar models previously investigated by : models in the first set are computed with the classical mlt whereas those belonging to the the second set are computed with gmlt .",
    "we find that the maximum of @xmath0 , @xmath4 , scales as @xmath56 for the first set and scales as @xmath57 for the second one ( @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 have their usual meaning ) .",
