    "single atom two - photon rabi frequencies of around 100 khz are achieved .",
    "the excitation lasers are pulsed for up to @xmath75 , after which the rydberg atoms are field ionized and the ions are detected by a channeltron .",
    "for the two - photon excitation , a laser beam at 421  nm is detuned around 0.51  ghz from the @xmath76 transition , and an infra - red beam of wavelength 10131015  nm provides the second step to the rybderg state @xmath77 .",
    "both of these beams are controlled using acousto - optic modulators ( aoms ) with a rise - time of around 80  ns .",
    "both lasers are stabilised to a scanning fabry - perot cavity to prevent long - term frequency drift .",
    "we estimate that the two - photon linewidth on the timescale of the excitation pulses is around 300  khz . in order to achieve reliable statistics ,",
    "the excitation sequence is repeated up to a few hundred times with the repetition rate limited to @xmath78 hz in order to avoid a buildup of charge on the quartz cell surrounded by the external field plates @xcite .",
    "the complete acquisition procedure takes around 30  s. the detection efficiency for ions in our experiment is around @xmath79 .",
    "+ in order to verify that the observed sub - poissonian statistics for resonant excitation is actually due to collective rydberg excitations and not an artefact of the limitations of the experimental apparatus , we performed a series of additional experiments .",
    "most importantly , we performed an experiment that interpolated between poissonian and sub - poissonian statistics for a fixed average number of rydberg excitations , thus ruling out a spurious effect due to a saturation of the channeltron . to that end",
    ", the volume of the mot was varied using a combination of magnetic field gradients , trapping beam sizes and laser powers chosen such as to keep the number of excited rydberg atoms constant . as expected",
    ", for a small cloud the rydberg dynamics was in the highly collective regime and a negative @xmath19 was measured . as the volume increased with the number of rydberg excitations kept fixed , the excitation dynamics tended to a poissonian distribution with @xmath80 .",
    "moreover , we performed experiments in which the first step laser was tuned to resonance with the @xmath76 transition so that atoms were directly ionized through the absorption of two photons at 421 nm . up until counting saturation , this process was found to obey poissonian statistics with @xmath81 .",
    "+ the creation of spurious ions , that is , those not created by field ionization of rydberg atoms , is a delicate issue in studies of the dipole blockade . the stark shift due to a single ion is larger than the van - der - waals interaction between two atoms in the investigated @xmath82 state .",
    "thus the creation of one ion in the sample can lead to a blockade due to coulomb interactions which suppresses the excitation of other rydberg atoms and thus mimicks the dipole blockade . a possible cause for the presence of spurious ions",
    "is the absorption of two 421  nm photons leading to direct ionization from the intermediate 6@xmath83p@xmath21 state @xcite . by detuning the blue laser 1  ghz from this state excitation",

    "@xcite ; however , the excitation and ionization is performed within @xmath89s and thus should have negligible impact on the counting statistics .",
    "finally , at the typical atomic densities used in the experiment the decay process is not affected by super - radiance . any loss from the initially prepared state will , therefore , follow poissonian statistics .",
    "in a many - body system with interactions , the mean - field theory replaces all interatomic interactions with an average or effective interaction , reducing the many - body problem to an effective one - body problem . within this approach",
    "the rydberg state energy is shifted by the vdw interaction characterized by the parameter @xmath90 given by a sum over all the rydberg pairs inside the atomic cloud , see @xcite . for instance , in a medium with uniform atomic density @xmath1 and for a @xmath68 interaction depending as @xmath91 on the interatomic distance @xmath43 , @xmath53 is approximatively @xmath92 .",

    "<S> we treat it perturbatively , with a limitation on the temporal evolution imposed by the spectral linewidth @xmath64 of the excitation laser . </S>",

    "<S> clearly , the salient features of the experiment are reproduced well by our model , both in the dynamics and in the dependence on the detuning . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the off - resonant behaviour of the @xmath10-factor , which in the experimental data features two symmetric peaks , is also visible in the simulation . </S>",

    "<S> perfect quantitative agreement between experiment and theory is not expected as the dicke model does not , at this time , include the spatially varying atomic density of the mot , doppler broadening , the spatial inhomogeneity of the excitation lasers , the full manifold of sublevels of the rydberg states , and the effects of magnetic and possible residual electric fields , all of which might contribute to the larger linewidth observed experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the dip in the rydberg number around zero detuning seen in fig.[fig_scan ] ( a ) could be smoothed out when taking into account the density variation over the cloud . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , figure 3 shows that the variation of @xmath10 with the detuning depends strongly on the density ( or , equivalently , on the @xmath68 coefficient that describes the van - der - waals interaction between rydberg atoms ) . </S>",
    "<S> as the density is increased , the value of @xmath10 on resonance goes from zero to a limiting value of around @xmath35 , whereas the position and height of the off - resonant peaks symmetric around zero detuning increase steadily . in order to get better agreement </S>",
    "<S> , one could either perform experiments with close to uniform atomic densities ( e.g. , using flat - top excitation beams much smaller than the atomic sample ) or develop a theoretical description that allows for the non - uniform density to be included . </S>",
    "<S> + in summary , we have shown clear evidence of sub - poissonian counting statistics of rydberg excitations in an ultra - cold atomic sample , which are a clear signature of many - body quantum correlations in such a system . </S>",
    "<S> we have characterized both the dynamics and the dependence on the detuning of the @xmath10-parameter and reproduced the main features of both using a novel model . in future studies </S>",
    "<S> , it will be interesting to look directly at the spatial correlations between rydberg excitations  @xcite , at the counting statistics for the antiblockade regime of  @xcite , and at other , more indirect , signatures of rydberg - rydberg interactions , for example in eit experiments  @xcite . + this work was supported by the e.u . through grants no . </S>",
