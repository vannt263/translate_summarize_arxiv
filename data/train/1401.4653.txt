    "as a powerful tool to reach a more detailed understanding of the structure of hadrons , single - spin asymmetry ( ssa ) appearing in high energy scattering processes has attracted extensive attention in the last two decades @xcite . in recent years , substantial ssas for the electroproduction of pions and kaons in semi - inclusive deep - inelastic scattering ( sidis ) were measured by several collaborations , such as the hermes collaboration  @xcite , the jefferson lab ( jlab )  @xcite and the compass collaboration  @xcite . in a particular case of ssas ,",
    "an asymmetry with a @xmath8 modulation ( the so - called beam ssa ) has been observed in sidis by colliding the longitudinal polarized electron  @xcite or positron beam  @xcite on the unpolarized nucleon target . since the magnitude of the observed asymmetry with several percents",
    "can not be explained by perturbative qcd @xcite , several mechanisms have been proposed to generate such asymmetry .",
    "one mechanism involves the @xmath1 term  @xcite , which indicates that the asymmetry is resulted from the coupling of the distribution @xmath9  @xcite with the collins fragmentation function ( ff ) @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "another mechanism relates to the @xmath11 term  @xcite , which suggests that the beam ssa is contributed by the convolution of the boer - mulders function @xmath12  @xcite and the ff @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "apart from the above two mechanisms , a new source giving rise to the beam ssa at the twist-3 level has been found through model calculations  @xcite .",
    "this mechanism involves a new twist-3 transverse momentum dependent ( tmd ) distribution function ( df ) @xmath14  @xcite , which appears in the decomposition of the quark correlator if the dependence on the light - cone vector is included . as a @xmath15-odd and chiral - even tmd ,",
    "@xmath14 can be regarded as an analog of the sivers function  @xcite at the twist-3 level , because both of them require quark transverse motion as well as initial- or final - state interactions  @xcite via soft - gluon exchanges to receive nonzero contributions .",
    "therefore , studying beam ssas may provide a unique opportunity to unravel the role of quark spin - orbit correlation at twist 3 .    in a recent work  @xcite",
    ", we studied the impact of @xmath3 on the beam ssa for neutral pion production . for this we calculated @xmath14 of valence quarks inside the proton using a spectator model  @xcite with scalar and axial - vector diquarks . by comparing our results with the experimental data measured by clas  @xcite and hermes  @xcite",
    ", we found that the @xmath15-odd twist-3 df @xmath14 may play an important role in the beam ssa in sidis . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we extended the calculations on the twist-3 tmd dfs @xmath9 and @xmath14 in the context of different spectator models for comparison .",
    "we considered two options for the propagator of the axial - vector diquark , as well as two different relations between quark flavors and diquark types , to obtain two sets of tmd dfs . using the model results , we estimated the beam ssas for neutral and charged pions at hermes and clas , by considering the @xmath1 term and @xmath2 term simultaneously .",
    "our numerical results shows that different choices for the diquark propagator will lead to different magnitudes and signs for the distribution functions , and can result in different sizes of the asymmetries .",
    "the contributions to the beam ssas given by the @xmath1 term and @xmath2 term are also quite different even in different sets .",
    "most recently , new preliminary measurements on the beam ssas of charged hadrons with increased statistics were performed by the hermes collaboration  @xcite , not only from a proton target , but also from a deuteron target .",
    "especially , the beam ssas of @xmath16 , @xmath17 , proton and antiproton have been measured for the first time .",
    "the new experiments adopted different kinematics from the ones in ref .",
    "@xcite and extended the measurements to larger @xmath18 and @xmath19 regions .",
    "the preliminary data shows that the beam ssas for the charged pions off the proton target are slightly positive , which are consistent with our theoretical results  @xcite calculated from the tmd dfs in set 1 . for the events of charged kaons , proton and antiproton production , the data indicate that the beam ssas are consistent with zero . in this work , we will confront the spectator model results@xcite on the beam ssas with the preliminary data from hermes . especially , we will not only present the beam ssas for the charged pions with the new kinematic cuts at hermes , but also give the theoretical results for the charged kaons , the proton and the antiproton , which has not been done before . in the calculation we only consider the contribution from tmd dfs of valence quarks , therefore , the analysis on the charged kaons can be used to test the role of the sea quarks in the beam ssa .",
    "furthermore , we will calculate the asymmetries with both the proton and deuteron targets .",
    "it is supposed that the contributions from the @xmath1 term are small in the case of the deuteron target , thus the measurement with a deuteron target may provide clean evidence of the @xmath2 term to the beam ssa , similar to the case of neutral pion production .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section .",
    "ii , we present the formalism of beam ssa in sidis . in section .",
    "iii , we use two sets of tmd dfs resulted from two different spectator models to calculate the beam ssas for charged hadrons at the new kinematic region of hermes .",
    "we also present the predictions on the beam ssas in the electroproduction of different charged hadrons at jlab with a 12 gev electron beam .",

    "we adopt the reference frame where the momentum of the virtual photon defines the @xmath20 axis , as shown in fig .",

    "we point out that our calculation on the structure function @xmath39 is based upon a generalization of the tmd factorization to the twist-3 level .",
    "therefore the correctness of our results relies on the validation of the twist-3 tmd factorization .",
    "however the tmd factorization formalism in qcd at twist 3 , or at order @xmath40 , has not been established yet .",
    "the main challenge is that , the extension of the twist-2 factorization formula to twist 3 at high orders of @xmath41 is not trivial  @xcite .",
    "also , for the t - odd twist-3 observables , direct calculation shows that there are light - cone divergences  @xcite for which it has not been understood how to control them at order @xmath40 .",
    "this does not necessarily mean that the twist-3 tmd factorization can not be developed .",
    "further study is needed to overcome this difficulty .",
    "nevertheless , we will still use eq .",
    "( [ flu ] ) as our starting point to study the beam ssa .",
    "the beam ssa @xmath42 as a function of @xmath19 therefore can be written as @xmath43 the @xmath18-dependent and the @xmath20-dependent asymmetries can be defined in a similar way .",
    "( [ flu ] ) shows that there are four terms giving contributions to the structure function @xmath44 , which are expressed as the convolutions of the twist-3 tmd dfs or ffs with the twist-2 ones . in the following calculation",
    ", we will neglect the @xmath45 term and the @xmath46 term , based on the wandzura - wilczek approximation  @xcite .",
    "thus , there are two remained terms that may give contributions to the structure function @xmath44 .",
    "one is the @xmath1 term , which has been applied to analyze the beam ssa of @xmath47 production in refs .",
    "the other is the @xmath2 term that has been adopted to calculate the beam ssa of neutral and charged pion production  @xcite recently . in this work ,",

    "@xcite , while set 2 is from the spectator diquark model used in ref .",
    "there are two differences between these two models .",
    "one is the choice of the propagator of the axial - vector diquark , which corresponds to the different sum of the polarization of the axial - vector diquark .",
    "the other is the relation between quark flavors and diquark types . in this work",
    "we will adopt both the two sets of tmd dfs to calculate beam ssas for comparison .",

    "we explain some details on how to obtain the above mentioned two sets of tmd dfs . in the calculation of set 1 tmd dfs , we choose the following form for the propagator of the axial - vector diquark  @xcite @xmath51 ^ 2 } \\,n_{-\\mu } n_{-\\nu } , \\label{d1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is the summation over the light - cone transverse polarizations of the axial - vector diquark  @xcite . at the same time",

    "@xcite , where they were fixed by reproducing the parametrization of unpolarized  @xcite and longitudinally polarized  @xcite parton distributions . to calculate set 2 tmd dfs , we adopt an alternative form for @xmath60  @xcite @xmath61 while for the relation between quark flavors and diquark types , we employ the commonly used approach in the previous spectator models calcuations  @xcite @xmath62 here the coefficients in front of @xmath63 are obtained from the su(4 ) spin - flavor symmetry of the proton wave function .",
    "it is worthwhile to point out that another propagator of the axial - vector diquark is investigated in  @xcite , in which a complete polarization sum has been considered .",
    "as for the collins function @xmath64 , we adopt the following relations for charged pions : @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the favored and unfavored collins functions , for which we apply the fitted results from ref .  @xcite .",
    "since currently there are no parameterized collins functions for kaons  @xcite and proton / antiproton , we assume that they satisfy the following relations @xmath68 for the favored ffs and @xmath69 for the unfavored ffs , which means that the ratios of favored and unfavored collins function of the kaon and proton / antiproton are proportional to the ratios of the favored and unfavored unpolarized ffs of the pion . for mesons , the relations in eqs .",
    "( [ kfav ] ) , ( [ kunfav ] ) and ( [ kunfav1 ] ) may be motivated by the artru model  @xcite , which suggests that all the favoured ( or unfavoured ) collins function describing fragmentation into spin - zero mesons have the same sign . for the collins functions of quarks fragmenting into spin-@xmath70 hadrons , currently there is no any theoretical implication or experimental constraint . as a first approximation",
    ", we assume that they can be connected to the collins fragmentation of mesons through eqs .",
    "( [ col - up ] ) and ( [ col - dp ] ) . for the tmd unpolarized ff @xmath71 , we assume its @xmath72 dependence has a gaussian form @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the gaussian width for @xmath75 .",
    "we choose @xmath76 @xmath77 in the calculation , following the fitted result in ref .",
    "@xcite . for the integrated ffs @xmath78 for different hadron production ,",
    "we adopt the leading order set of the dss parametrization  @xcite .         finally ,",
    "in this work , we consider the following kinematic constraints  @xcite on the intrinsic transverse momentum of the initial quarks throughout our calculation : @xmath79 they are obtained by requiring the energy of the parton to be less than the energy of the parent hadron ( the first constraint ) and the parton should move in the forward direction with respect to the parent hadron ( the second constraint )  @xcite . for the region @xmath80 , there are two upper limits for @xmath81 at the same time ; it is understood that the smaller one should be chosen .",
    "to perform numerical calculation on beam ssas of charged hadron production in sidis at hermes , we adopt the following kinematic cuts  @xcite : @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the invariant mass of the hadronic final states , and where @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the energies of the electron beam and the detected final - state hadron in the target rest frame , respectively .    in the left , central , and right panels of fig .",

    "the curves are compared to the preliminary hermes results on the asymmetries using the data collected during the years 1998 - 2007  @xcite . to distinguish different origins of the asymmetry , we use the dashed and dotted curves to show the contributions from the @xmath1 term and @xmath2 term , while the solid curves stand for the total contribution .    by comparing the theoretical results with the preliminary experimental data",
    ", we find that for @xmath47 production , the result in set 2 shows a positive asymmetry at the magnitude of @xmath86 to @xmath87 , which can well describe the preliminary hermes data . for @xmath88 production ,",
    "the model result from set 1 is positive , agreeing with the sign of the preliminary hermes data that demonstrate slightly positive asymmetry , although the calculation overestimates the data at large @xmath18 and large @xmath19 regions .",
    "our new results are the predictions on charged kaons , proton and anti - proton production , for which we obtain rather small asymmetries in both sets .",
    "these results are consistent with the preliminary hermes data , although the uncertainties are large .",
    "this indicates that the valence quark approximation could be valid in the asymmetries for charged kaon , proton and anti - proton produced at hermes .",
    "furthermore , the contributions from the @xmath1 term are almost negligible in both sets .",
    "one of the main results in this work is our prediction for the beam ssas of charged hadrons production with a deuteron target at hermes , as shown in fig .",
    "[ hermesb ] .",
    "again we plot the asymmetries for charged pions , charged kaons and proton / anti - proton production in the the left , central , and right panels .",
    "the sizes of the asymmetries are similar to the case of the proton target . for the pion asymmetries on the deuteron target , we find that the calculation in set 1 can well describe the preliminary data , especially for the @xmath88 production . also , the agreement between the theoretical curves and the preliminary data is better than that on the proton target .",
    "another difference from the proton target is that the dominant contributions are given by the @xmath2 term for almost all hadrons , while the contributions from the @xmath1 term are small compared to the @xmath2 term .",
    "the dominance of the @xmath2 term is more evident in set 1 .",
    "this is not surprising because in the case of the deuteron target the @xmath1 term contributes in the following way : @xmath89 where @xmath90 corresponds to the sum of the favored collins function and the unfavored one . since the favored and the unfavored collins functions are similar in size but opposite in sign",
    ", the @xmath1 term contribution for the deuteron target is largely suppressed . in the case of the charged hadron production",
    ", it would be more ideal to probe the distribution @xmath14 using the deuteron target than the proton target at hermes .                in this subsection",
    ", we present our predictions on the beam ssas for charged hadron production at jlab with a @xmath91 longitudinally polarized electron beam scattered off nucleon targets , which could be performed in the near future .",
    "we adopt the constraints on @xmath92 given in eq .",
    "( [ constraints ] ) and apply the following kinematic cuts in the calculation  @xcite : @xmath93    in fig .",

    "here we show the beams ssas for @xmath47 and @xmath88 in set 1 and set 2 , in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ clas12a ] .",
    "the result for @xmath47 production at jlab 12 gev in set 1 shows that the asymmetries contributed by two different sources almost cancel , leading to a rather small total asymmetry . in the other cases the pion asymmetries do",
    "no vanish .",
    "similarly , we plot the asymmetries for @xmath6 and @xmath7 in the central and the right panel of fig .",
    "[ clas12a ] .",
    "we find that the asymmetries for @xmath6 and @xmath7 in set 1 are quite sizable , while the the asymmetries for those hadrons in set 2 are consistent with zero .",
    "therefore , the precise measurements on the beam ssas for @xmath6 and @xmath7 production at jlab 12 gev could be used to distinguish different spectator models . for completeness , in fig .",
    "[ clas12b ] we plot the same asymmetries for different charged - hadron production at jlab 12 gev , but on the deuteron target , in the case that a deuteron target would be available .",
    "we find that the size and the sign of the asymmetries on the deuteron target is similar to the case of the proton target .",
    "in this work , we performed an analysis on the beam ssas for @xmath95 , @xmath96 , proton and antiproton in sidis at the kinematics of hermes , as well as at the kinematics of jlab 12 gev .",
    "we considered the case that the nucleon target is a proton or a deuteron . in our calculation",
    "we employed the contributions from the @xmath1 term and the @xmath2 term , and we used two sets of tmd dfs calculated from two different spectator models .",
    "we compared the theoretical curves with the preliminary data recently obtained by the hermes collaboration .",
    "we find that for pion production , two sets of tmd dfs lead to rather different results , also , the roles of the @xmath1 term and the @xmath2 term are different in different sets . the asymmetries for charged kaons , proton and antiproton are small in both sets and are consistent with the preliminary hermes data .",
    "for the deuteron target , we find that the role of the @xmath1 term is small compared to the @xmath2 term .",
    "therefore , the contribution to beam ssas related to the @xmath2 term could be studied without a significant background from the mechanism related to the @xmath1 term .",
    "finally , the analysis on the beam asymmetries of charged hadron production at jlab indicates that the precise measurement on the beam ssas of @xmath6 and @xmath7 production , which can be performed at jlab with a 12 gev electron beam in the near future , could be used to distinguish different spectator models and shed light on the mechanism of the beam ssas in terms of tmd dfs .",

    "<S> we study the beam single - spin asymmetries @xmath0 for charged hadrons produced in semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering process , by considering the @xmath1 term and the @xmath2 term simultaneously . besides the asymmetries for charged pions , for the first time we present the analysis on the asymmetries in the production of charged kaons , protons and antiprotons by longitudinally polarized leptons scattered off unpolarized proton and deuteron targets . in our calculation we use two sets of transverse momentum dependent distributions @xmath3 and @xmath4 calculated from two different spectator models , and compare the numerical results with the preliminary data recently obtained by the hermes collaboration . </S>",
    "<S> we also predict the beam spin asymmetries for @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 electroproduction in semi - inclusive deep - inelastic scattering of 12 gev polarized electrons from unpolarized proton and deuteron targets . </S>"
