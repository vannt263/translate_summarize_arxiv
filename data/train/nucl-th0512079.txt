    "the @xmath0 state has first been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the authors followed the idea of ref .",
    "@xcite and estimated the qcd van der waals attractive force of the @xmath0 system .",
    "they claimed that the qcd van der waals attractive force , mediated by multi - gluon exchanges , can be strong enough to form a bound @xmath0 state with a binding energy of about @xmath8 mev . at the same time they pointed out that it is possible to search for such a bound state using the @xmath9 meson below threshold quasi - free photo - production kinematics experimentally . using a simple model , the authors calculated the rate for such subthreshold quasi - free production process using a realistic jefferson laboratory luminosity and a large acceptance detection system .",
    "they concluded that such an experiment is feasible . to our way of thinking , it is necessary and desirable to study the possibility of the @xmath0 bound state via different theoretical approaches .",
    "the @xmath0 is a light quark system and the study based on the constituent quark model seems to be significant and indispensable .",
    "furthermore , since the @xmath10 and @xmath9 are two color singlet hadrons with no common flavor quarks , there is no one gluon exchange ( oge ) interaction between these two clusters , thus the @xmath0 system is really a special case to examine the quark - quark interactions and further the interactions between these two hadrons .",
    "it is a general consensus that the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is the underlying theory of the strong interaction .",
    "however , as the non - perturbative qcd ( npqcd ) effect is very important for light quark systems in the low energy region and it is difficult to be seriously solved , people still need qcd - inspired models to be a bridge connecting the qcd fundamental theory and the experimental observables . among these phenomenological models ,",
    "the chiral su(3 ) quark model has been quite successful in reproducing the energies of the baryon ground states , the binding energy of the deuteron , the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath3 ) scattering phase shifts , and the hyperon - nucleon ( @xmath4 ) cross sections @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the quark - quark interaction containing confinement , oge and boson exchanges stemming from scalar and pseudoscalar nonets , and the short range quark - quark interaction is provided by oge and quark exchange effects .",
    "actually it is still a controversial problem for low - energy hadron physics whether gluon or goldstone boson is the proper effective degree of freedom besides the constituent quark .",
    "glozman and riska proposed that the goldstone boson is the only other proper effective degree of freedom @xcite .",
    "but isgur gave a critique of the boson exchange model and insisted that the oge governs the baryon structure @xcite .",
    "anyway , it is still a challenging problem in the low - energy hadron physics whether oge or vector - meson exchange is the right mechanism or both of them are important for describing the short - range quark - quark interaction .",
    "thus the chiral su(3 ) quark model has been extended to include the coupling of the quark and vector chiral fields .",
    "the oge that plays an important role in the short range quark - quark interaction in the original chiral su(3 ) quark model is now nearly replaced by the vector meson exchanges .",
    "this model , named the extended chiral su(3 ) quark model , has also been successful in reproducing the the energies of the baryon ground states , the binding energy of the deuteron , and the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath3 ) scattering phase shifts @xcite .",
    "recently , we have extended both the chiral su(3 ) quark model and the extended chiral su(3 ) quark model from the study of baryon - baryon scattering processes to the baryon - meson systems by solving a resonating group method ( rgm ) equation @xcite .",
    "we found that some results are similar to those given by the chiral unitary approach study , such as that both the @xmath11 system with isospin @xmath12 and the @xmath13 system with @xmath14 have quite strong attractions @xcite . in the study of the @xmath15 scattering @xcite",
    ", we get a considerable improvement not only on the signs but also on the magnitudes of the theoretical phase shifts comparing with other s previous work .",
    "we also studied the phase shifts of @xmath16 @xcite , and got reasonable fit with the experiments in the low energy region .",
    "all these achievements encourage us to investigate more baryon - meson systems by using the same group of parameters .    in this work ,",
    "we dynamically study the @xmath0 interaction in both the chiral su(3 ) quark model and the extended chiral su(3 ) quark model by using the rgm .",
    "all the model parameters are taken from our previous work .",
    "the channel coupling of @xmath0 and @xmath17 is considered , and the effect of the tensor force which makes for the mixing of @xmath6 and @xmath7 waves is also investigated . in the next section the framework of the chiral su(3 ) quark model and the extended chiral su(3 ) quark model",
    "are briefly introduced .",
    "the results for the @xmath0 state are shown in sec .",
    "iii , where some discussion is presented as well . finally , the summary is given in sec .",
    "the chiral su(3 ) quark model and the extended chiral su(3 ) quark model has been widely described in the literature @xcite , and we refer the reader to those works for details . here",
    "we just give the salient features of these two models .",
    "in these two models , the total hamiltonian of baryon - meson systems can be written as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the kinetic energy operator for the center - of - mass motion , and @xmath20 and @xmath21 represent the quark - quark and quark - antiquark interactions , respectively , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the oge interaction , and @xmath24 is the confinement potential .",
    "@xmath25 represents the chiral fields induced effective quark - quark potential . in the chiral su(3 ) quark model , @xmath25 includes the scalar boson exchanges and the pseudoscalar boson exchanges , @xmath26 and in the extended chiral su(3 ) quark model , the vector boson exchanges are also included , @xmath27 here @xmath28 are the scalar nonet fields , @xmath29 the pseudoscalar nonet fields , and @xmath30 the vector nonet fields .",
    "the expressions of these potentials can be found in the literature @xcite .",
    "@xmath31 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) includes two parts : direct interaction and annihilation parts , @xmath32 with @xmath33 and @xmath34 here @xmath35 represents the g parity of the @xmath36th meson .",
    "the @xmath37 annihilation interactions , @xmath38 , are not included in this work because they are assumed not to contribute significantly to a molecular state or a scattering process which is the subject of our present study .",
    "all the model parameters are taken from our previous work @xcite , which gave a satisfactory description of the energies of the baryon ground states , the binding energy of the deuteron , and the @xmath3 scattering phase shifts . here",
    "we briefly give the procedure for the parameter determination .",
    "the three initial input parameters , i.e. the harmonic - oscillator width parameter @xmath39 , the up ( down ) quark mass @xmath40 and the strange quark mass @xmath41 , are taken to be the usual values : @xmath42 fm for the chiral su(3 ) quark model and @xmath43 fm for the extended chiral su(3 ) quark model , @xmath44 mev , and @xmath45 mev .",
    "the coupling constant for scalar and pseudoscalar chiral field coupling , @xmath46 , is fixed by the relation @xmath47 with the empirical value @xmath48 .",
    "the coupling constant for vector coupling of the vector - meson field is taken to be @xmath49 , the same as used in the @xmath3 case @xcite .",
    "the masses of the mesons are taken to be the experimental values , except for the @xmath50 meson .",
    "the @xmath51 is adjusted to fit the binding energy of the deuteron .",
    "the oge coupling constants and the strengths of the confinement potential are fitted by baryon masses and their stability conditions .",
    "all the parameters are tabulated in table i , where the first set is for the original chiral su(3 ) quark model , the second and third sets are for the extended chiral su(3 ) quark model by taking @xmath52 as @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively . here",
    "@xmath55 is the coupling constant for tensor coupling of the vector meson fields .",
    ".[para ] model parameters .",
    "the meson masses and the cutoff masses : @xmath56 mev , @xmath57 mev , @xmath58 mev , @xmath59 mev , @xmath60 mev , @xmath61 mev , @xmath62 mev , @xmath63 mev , @xmath64 mev , @xmath65 mev , @xmath66 mev , and @xmath67 mev . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     since the threshold of @xmath5 is only 49 mev higher than that of @xmath0 , the channel coupling effect of these two channels would be un - negligible .",
    "this effect is considered by solving a coupled - channel rgm equation for the bound state problem , and the calculated binding energies are shown in table ii .",
    "one sees that in model i , the @xmath0 states are yet unbound for both spin @xmath68 and @xmath69 channels , while in model ii and iii , the @xmath0 states are weakly bound with the binding energies of about 3 and 1 mev for @xmath68 and 9 and 6 mev for @xmath69 , respectively .",
    "these results tell us that the effect of the channel coupling between @xmath70 and @xmath5 is considerable and it can make the @xmath0 binding energies a little bit larger .",
    "we also study the effect of the tensor force from oge , pseudo - scalar and vector field coupling , which results in the mixing of @xmath6 and @xmath7 waves .",
    "our results show that the tensor force in the @xmath0 system is very small and its effect can be neglected .",
    "this can be understood easily because in the @xmath0 system the tensor force from oge and @xmath71 and @xmath72 exchanges are absent and only @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 exchanges with the quark exchange can offer tiny tensor force .    as mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite , in the @xmath0 system , the oge is not allowed since the two color - singlet clusters have no common flavor quarks , and the attraction between @xmath10 and @xmath9 comes from the qcd van der waals interaction mediated by multi - gluon exchanges . in the chiral su(3 ) quark model , there is also no contributions from oge , while the @xmath50 exchange dominantly provides the @xmath77 attractive interaction . as regards in the extended chiral su(3 ) quark model , there is no contribution from @xmath72 , @xmath78 and @xmath9 exchanges , and the attraction in this special system also dominantly comes from @xmath50 exchange . in our calculation , the model parameters are fitted by the @xmath3 scattering phase shifts , and the mass of @xmath50 is adjusted by fitting the deuteron s binding energy , thus the value of @xmath79 is somewhat different for the cases i , ii and iii . in model ii the mass of the @xmath50 meson is smaller than those in model i and iii , which means that in model ii @xmath0 gets more attraction than those in model i and iii , thus much more binding energy of @xmath0 is obtained in model ii than in model i and iii .    actually , all of the results including the estimation from color van der waals force in ref .",
    "@xcite are model and parameter dependent .",
    "however while the results obtained from different theoretical approaches are qualitatively similar , then it would make sense and this special system becomes more interesting . at the same time",
    ", an experimental measurement of the @xmath0 binding energy to examine whether the @xmath0 system can be bound would be very important for getting more knowledge of the coupling between quark and @xmath50 chiral field .",
    "in this work , we dynamically study the @xmath0 state in the chiral su(3 ) quark model as well as in the extended chiral su(3 ) quark model by solving the rgm equation .",
    "all the model parameters are taken from our previous work , which can give a satisfactory description of the energies of the baryon ground states , the binding energy of the deuteron , and the @xmath3 scattering phase shifts .",
    "the channel coupling of @xmath0 and @xmath5 is considered and the effect of the tensor force is also studied .",
    "the calculated results show that the @xmath0 state has an attractive interaction , dominantly provided by the @xmath50 exchange , for both spin @xmath68 and @xmath69 channels .",
    "the effect of the channel coupling of @xmath0 and @xmath5 is shown to be considerable , while the tensor force is displayed to be so small that can be neglected . in the extended chiral su(3 ) quark model , the @xmath0 attractive interaction plus the coupling to the @xmath5 channel can make for an @xmath0 quasi - bound state with several mev binding energy . experimentally whether their is an @xmath0 quasi - bound state or resonance state can help us to test the strength of the coupling of the quark and @xmath50 chiral field .",
