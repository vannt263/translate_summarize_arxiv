    "black holes are among the most fascinating and mysterious objects in physics and are subject to an intense theoretical and observational research activity .",
    "astrophysical black holes , whose masses typically range from few solar masses to billions of solar masses , are pretty well described by general relativity . there might exist , however , a new breed of black holes with masses below @xmath4 , that have been produced in early universe epochs due to the extreme matter density fluctuations @xcite and/or for quantum mechanical decay of desitter space @xcite .",
    "such black holes , one can term microscopic black holes , have sizes of elementary particles and are subject to quantum mechanical effects . even if the existence of microscopic black holes still needs corroboration from experiments and observations ,",
    "they are extremely interesting since they represent one of the crucial challenges to our understanding of fundamental physics . in the mid 1970 s",
    ", hawking showed that quantum effects allow black holes for evaporating , _",
    "i.e. _ , emitting a thermal spectrum of particles like a black body @xcite .",
    "this fact has supported the idea of black hole thermodynamics .",
    "black holes have a temperature proportional to their surface gravity and an entropy proportional to their horizon area .",
    "such an intriguing scenario is , however , not free of problems .",
    "static , spherically symmetric black holes have a negative heat capacity .",
    "this is equivalent to saying that , while emitting particles , they shrink and become hotter and hotter .",
    "the process is runaway and the destiny of an evaporating black hole is , in general , still unknown .",
    "another issue concerns the statistical interpretation of the black hole entropy . we still miss a complete understanding of the microscopic degrees of freedom that support the entropy / area law in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "a related problem concerns the information loss .",
    "this arises already at classical level .",
    "the collapsing star microstates become inaccessible when the event horizon forms . the hawking radiation",
    ", however , aggravates the situation .",
    "the initial stellar particle pure state would evolve into a mixed state of thermally distributed particles , in marked contrast with one of the principles of quantum mechanics ( see @xcite for recent discussions on the topic ) .",
    "it is believed that the open problems listed above can only be solved by the ultraviolet completion of the gravitational field . in other words , at short scales , _ i.e _ , lengths of the order of the planck length , the spacetime description in terms of general relativity breaks down and a quantum theory of gravity must be invoked .",
    "this explains the great interest in new black hole models able to account for quantum gravity effects in place of the classical curvature singularity ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that these models tend to converge towards a unique scenario : the singularity is removed or softened ; the evaporating black hole undergoes a phase transition prior the final stages of evaporation , switching from a negative heat capacity warming to a positive heat capacity cooling down .",
    "ultimately the black hole approaches a zero temperature stable black hole remnant configuration .",
    "alternatives to the above scenario are offered by the planck star @xcite and by some models inspired by the generalized uncertainty principle that allow for either the formation of hot remnants @xcite or of sub - planckian black holes @xcite ( for recent reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "recently there has been a growing conviction that black holes might have an intrinsically new description ( known as quantum @xmath0-portrait ) , alternative and complementary to what one can deduce from a semiclassical , geometric arguments .",
    "theoretical evidence is supporting the idea that a black hole is a bound state or better a condensate of @xmath0 gravitons , whose quantum interaction strength is @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "this conjecture is reminiscent of the fuzzball proposal for black holes , whose entropy is described in terms of a bound ( bps ) state of parallel @xmath6 branes @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath0 is related to the pixelization of the event horizon in fundamental qubits , as it emerges from the black hole holographic entropy @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the size of the black hole and @xmath9 is the planck length .",
    "accordingly one finds @xmath10 and the black holes mass @xmath11 , with @xmath12 the planck mass . in this picture",
    ", the hawking radiation corresponds to the quantum depletion of the condensate that produces a thermal spectrum with @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the black - hole - condensate is supposed to be formed in an extreme energy graviton scattering process @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "more precisely the black hole is an intermediate state between two asymptotic states , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "both quantum field theory and string theory calculations in the large @xmath0 limit confirm that each final state in the reverse process @xmath17 is exponentially suppressed by a factor depending on the black hole entropy @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the above scenario is supposed to affect all black hole formation mechanisms .",
    "these also include the gravitational collapse that in its final stages concerns matter and energy interacting at length scales of the order of the planck length , @xmath9 . as a result ,",
    "the quantum @xmath0-portrait efficiently describes black holes in all mass regimes - black hole macroquantumness @xcite - including those one typically encounters in astrophysics .    the quantum @xmath0-portrait proposal has generated a considerable follow - up work , most notably in relation to the so called `` horizon wave function '' ( hwf ) formalism .",
    "the latter is a formulation in which one attributes to any quantum mechanical particle a wave function for the gravitational radius @xcite . in doing so ,",
    "one obtain probabilistic conditions to distinguish black holes from elementary particles ( for a recent review see @xcite ) . as a by product ,",
    "the hwf naturally encodes the generalized uncertainty principle for the particle position and the black hole decay rate .",
    "interestingly , the black hole quantum @xmath0-portrait helps to understand the very nature of gravity , that is _ self - complete _ in the ultraviolet regime .",

    "both quantum field theory and string theory calculations in the large @xmath0 limit show that the black hole configuration dominates over other non - black hole classical states @xcite .",
    "the higher is the energy @xmath20 , the higher is the occupation number @xmath0 of non - propagating gravitons and the larger are the probed length scales .",
    "accordingly also the problem of gravity bad short distance behavior , _",
    "i.e. _ curvature singularities , is ultimately circumvented .    within the black hole quantum @xmath0-portrait paradigm , one recovers , in the large @xmath0-limit , the geometric picture of black holes in terms of the schwarzschild metric @xcite .",
    "on the ground of mere geometric considerations , the schwarzschild metric is , however , in conflict with the self - complete character of gravity .",
    "solutions of einstein equations can exist irrespective of any lower bound for the black hole mass . for @xmath21 ,",
    "there is a scale ambiguity , due to the coexistence of compton wavelengths and schwarzschild radii . in principle",
    ", a schwarzschild black hole can probe sub - planckian length scales by decaying through the hawking radiation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bhdecay ] left ) .",
    "of course , this scenario can not be fully trusted due to a breakdown of the semiclassical description at the planck scale .",
    "one expects that in the strong coupling regime , gravity actually deviates from einstein gravity . to this purpose",
    ", an array of formulations have been proposed to consistently modify the einstein - hilbert action , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the covariant dalembertian and dots stand for higher derivative terms ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "accordingly , the geometric picture is also supposed to depart from the schwarzschild geometry . in the absence of further indications from the quantum @xmath0-portrait beyond the large @xmath0 limit",
    ", one can only rely on ultraviolet improved gravity theories to draw scenarios of black holes close to the planck scale .",
    "given such a background , a new metric , obtained by a process of black hole engineering , has recently been proposed in order to capture all the _ desiderata _ of the quantum @xmath0-portrait for any @xmath0 @xcite . in a nutshell ,",
    "such a metric , known as holographic metric , enjoys the following properties :    a.   the metric admits an extremal configuration for a black hole mass @xmath24 and radius @xmath25 ; b.   the extremal configuration represents the fundamental qubit of the system ; any larger black holes are governed by a unique universal parameter @xmath0 , which is set via a holographic relation similar to that between voxels and pixels @xcite ; c.   the metric coincides with the schwarzschild metric away from the planck scale , _",
